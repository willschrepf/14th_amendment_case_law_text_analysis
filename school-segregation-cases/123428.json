(“Pfizer”) and Purdue Pharma L.P. (“Purdue”), to the Office of Inspector General\n\n(“OIG”) of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), as part of the\n\ncompanies’ compliance with settlement agreements arising from the companies’ illegal off-label\n\npromotion of drugs reimbursed by federal health care programs. 1 Between forty and one\n\nhundred times each year over the last decade, HHS’ OIG has participated in such settlement\n\nagreements by entering into Corporate Integrity Agreements (“CIAs”) with companies seeking to\n\n1\n  Off-label marketing of drugs for non-FDA approved uses is “considered by the FDA to be a violation of the Food\nDrug and Cosmetic Act,” and is “dangerous for the public health” due to the “lack of supporting data for the off-\nlabel uses and exposure of patients “to risk of serious adverse effects without any clear evidence that the drug will\nbe effective for the intended purpose.” Declaration of Aaron Kesselheim, M.D., J.D., M.P.H., Asst. Professor of\nMedicine, Harvard Medical School, (“Kesselheim Decl.”) ¶ 8, ECF No. 26-2.\n\n                                                          1\n\fresolve civil and administrative health care fraud cases and avoid costly exclusion from\n\nparticipation in Federal health care programs. See Declaration of Gregory E. Demske, Asst.\n\nInspector General for Legal Affairs, OIG, HHS, (“Demske Decl.”) ¶¶1-2, ECF No. 22-1. In\n\nreturn for these benefits, under the CIA, the companies must agree to enhanced compliance\n\nmeasures, subject to auditing by an outside independent party and monitoring by the OIG. Id. ¶\n\n2.\n\n       Public Citizen is a “nonprofit public interest organization,” which has, inter alia, “fought\n\nfor safe, effective, and affordable drugs and medical devices; responsible controls over the\n\ndelivery of health care; consumer access to health care information,” and issued publications on\n\nthese topics. Declaration of Sidney Wolfe, M.D., Public Citizen Health Research Group\n\nDirector, (“Wolfe Decl.”) ¶ 2, ECF No. 26-1. Noting that Pfizer has entered into three serial\n\nCIAs with HHS’ OIG, due to the company engaging in allegedly illegal behavior at the same\n\ntime it was subject to a CIA, the plaintiff filed the FOIA requests at issue in the instant suit to\n\naddress “a serious question about the adequacy of OIG oversight of companies during the CIA\n\nprocess.” Id. ¶¶ 11, 14; see also Declaration of Edward Nowicki, Pfizer Vice-President and\n\nAsst. General Counsel, Deputy Compliance Officer – Global Programs, (“Nowicki Decl.”) ¶ 4,\n\nECF No. 22-1 (“The 2004 CIA expired in 2009. Since that time, Pfizer entered into a new CIA\n\nwith HHS in 2009.”). The plaintiff explains that “[t]o the extent that the annual reports [required\n\nby the CIA] reveal instances of illegal activity by the companies, the public has a strong interest\n\nin knowing that OIG had access to this information and in knowing whether OIG acted\n\nforcefully in responding to it.” Wolfe Decl. ¶ 14.\n\n       HHS has withheld the bulk of the requested records on grounds that they contain\n\nconfidential, commercial information exempt from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 4 and\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\fprivate, personal information exempt from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 6. 5 U.S.C. §\n\n552(b)(4) and (6). The plaintiff challenges HHS’ withholdings for eight categories of records, as\n\nwell as the adequacy of HHS’ search for records pertaining to one of the companies. Pending\n\nbefore the Court, are cross-motions for summary judgment by HHS and the defendant-\n\nintervenors Pfizer and Purdue, and by the plaintiff. For the reasons stated below, these motions\n\nare granted in part and denied in part.\n\nI.      BACKGROUND\n\n        A.       Annual Reports Required To Be Submitted Under Corporate Integrity\n                 Agreements With Pfizer And Purdue\n\n        In May 2004, Pfizer entered into a CIA with HHS’ OIG as part of a larger settlement\n\nagreement with the United States and various States “related to Pfizer’s promotional practices of\n\na Pfizer product.” Nowicki Decl. ¶ 4; see also Def.’s Mot. Summ. J., Ex. 1 (“Pfizer Corporate\n\nIntegrity Agreement”) (“Pfizer CIA”) at 1, ECF No. 22-1. This CIA superseded a prior CIA that\n\nPfizer had entered with HHS’ OIG in October 2002. Id. “Among other things, the CIA required\n\nPfizer to implement, update and/or review its policies and procedures relating to compliance with\n\nrelevant federal regulations,” and to submit to the OIG annually over the five-year period while\n\nthe CIA was in force an Annual Report that addressed at least twenty enumerated items.\n\nNowicki Decl. ¶ 4; Pfizer CIA at 24–27. Pfizer claims these annual reports “contain highly\n\nsensitive, confidential commercial information,” and, consequently, marked the documents\n\nsubmitted as “Confidential and FOIA Exempt.” Nowicki Decl. ¶ 14. The 2004 Agreement\n\nexpired in 2009. 2 Id. ¶ 4.\n\n        In May 2007, Purdue entered into a CIA with HHS “contemporaneously with a\n\nsettlement agreement between Purdue and the United States which resolved an investigation by\n\n2\n Although Pfizer entered into a new CIA in 2009, the FOIA request at issue was limited to the 2004 CIA.

Id. ¶ 1. Purdue also claims these reports contain\n\n“highly confidential and proprietary information,” and, consequently, marked the Annual\n\nReports at issue as “Confidential and FOIA Exempt.” Id. ¶¶ 1, 9.\n\n       Both Pfizer and Purdue agreed to the terms set forth in their respective CIAs with the\n\nOIG “as part of the resolution of civil and administrative health care fraud cases.” Demske Decl.\n\n¶ 2. They both contain the standard provisions that “the OIG agrees not to seek an exclusion of\n\nthat entity from participation in Federal health care programs,” on condition that the company\n\nsubject to the CIA “adopts measures designed to promote compliance,” with Federal laws and\n\nregulations, including “hiring [] a compliance officer, establish[ing] a code of conduct and\n\npolicies and procedures, employee training, confidential disclosure mechanisms, and reporting of\n\nviolations of law.” Id. Also, both CIAs require review of the company’s compliance with these\n\nmeasures by an independent party, called an Independent Review Organization (“IRO”), which\n\nsubmits annually to the company a report “addressing the requirements of the CIA and including\n\nthe results of the audits and reviews.” Id. ¶ 3. The IRO Report is later submitted to the HHS as\n\npart of the company’s Annual Report, along with any responses to IRO Report’s findings from\n\nthe company. Id.; Purdue CIA at 28; Pfizer CIA at 25. The CIAs themselves are posted on the\n\nHHS website. Demske Decl. ¶ 3.\n\n       As part of the CIAs, the companies are given the opportunity to “clearly identify any\n\nportions of its submissions that it believes are trade secrets, or information that is commercial or\n\nfinancial and privileged or confidential, and therefore potentially exempt from disclosure under\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fthe Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. § 552.” Def. Mot. Summ J., Ex. 6 (“Corporate\n\nIntegrity Agreement between the [OIG] of the [HHS] and Purdue Pharma L.P.”) (“Purdue CIA”)\n\nat 30, ECF No. 22-2; see also Pfizer CIA at 28. At the same time, the CIAs direct that the\n\ncompany “shall refrain from identifying any information as exempt from disclosure if that\n\ninformation does not meet the criteria for exemption from disclosure under FOIA.” Id. HHS is\n\nnot obligated to accept the companies’ designation of any document as FOIA exempt. Indeed,\n\nbased on the materials released, HHS disagreed with the companies’ designations, at least in\n\npart, with respect to certain documents, which have been partially released to the plaintiff. See,\n\ne.g., Declaration of Julie A. Murray, Counsel for Public Citizen, (“Murray Decl.”) Ex 3 Attachs.\n\nA, D, E, F, G, H, ECF No. 26-3 (released documents bearing legend “Confidential and FOIA\n\nExempt.”). 3\n\n         B.       The Plaintiff’s FOIA Request\n\n         On November 12, 2009, the plaintiff submitted a FOIA request to HHS seeking “all\n\nannual reports submitted to the [OIG] by Purdue Pharma L.P. pursuant to the May 2007\n\nCorporate Integrity Agreement between OIG and Purdue Pharma L.P,” and “by Pfizer, Inc.\n\npursuant to the May 2004 Corporate Integrity Agreement between OIG and Pfizer.” Decl. of\n\nRobin R. Brooks, HHS OIG FOIA Officer, (“Brooks Decl.”) Ex. A at 1, ECF No. 22-1. 4 In\n\nresponse, HHS conducted a search of its CIA database and “the Compliance File room where\n\nactive compliance case files and Implementation and Annual Reports are maintained.” Brooks\n\n\n3\n  In connection with Pfizer’s submission of documents pursuant to an earlier CIA executed on October 24, 2002,\nHHS was prompted to caution the company that “[t]o date almost all of the documents submitted pursuant to the\nCIA have been stamped ‘FOIA exempt.’ As a result we would like to advise you that in the event that Pfizer’s CIA\nmaterials are requested under FOIA, such materials may not be fully exempt as you have noted . . . . Therefore, you\nshould not assume that all of Pfizer’s reports and other documents submitted pursuant to the CIA will be exempt\nfrom a FOIA request.” Murray Decl., Ex. 3 Attach. G (HHS letter, dated November 19, 2003, to Pfizer) at 1–2, ECF\nNo. 26-3.\n4\n  Public Citizen’s request for a fee waiver was granted, following an administrative appeal of HHS’s initial denial of\nthis request. See Brooks Decl. ¶¶ 4, 6, 8, 11.\n\n                                                          5\n\fDecl. ¶ 13. HHS’s FOIA liaison also “confirmed with the attorneys monitoring the CIA’s [sic]\n\nthat all responsive records had been accounted for.” Id.\n\n       Under Executive Order 12,600, HHS was required to “notify submitters of records\n\ncontaining confidential commercial information . . . when those records are requested under the\n\n[FOIA].” 52 Fed. Reg. 23,781 § 1 (June. 23, 1987). HHS regulations also require such a\n\n“predisclosure notification.” See 45 C.F.R. § 5.65(d); Brooks Decl. ¶ 24. Consequently, HHS\n\nnotified Pfizer and Purdue of the plaintiff’s request and consulted with them “regarding the\n\nrelease of their information.” Brooks Decl. ¶ 24.\n\n       On June 22, 2010, HHS notified the plaintiff that it had “located 1177 pages of records\n\nresponsive” to the Purdue portion of the FOIA request. Brooks Decl. Ex. J. Of those pages,\n\n1,093 were withheld in their entirety under FOIA Exemptions 4 and 6, see 5 U.S.C. §§ 552(b)(4),\n\n(b)(6), while 84 pages were partially released with portions redacted under the same exemptions.\n\nId. With respect to the Pfizer portion of the FOIA request, HHS notified the plaintiff, on\n\nSeptember 21, 2010, that 9,432 pages of responsive records had been located, with 5,216 pages\n\nwithheld in their entirety as well as portions of 4,216 pages, under FOIA Exemptions 4 and 6.\n\nBrooks Decl. Ex. L; see also Fed. Def.’s Combined Reply Supp. Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. and\n\nOpp’n to Pl.’s Cross Motion for Summ J. (“Def.’s Reply”) at 2, ECF No. 29 (noting that search\n\n“netted more than 9000 pages of records and more than 4,200 of those pages were released to the\n\nplaintiff, with portions withheld under Exemptions 4 and 6”). The plaintiff appealed these\n\nwithholding determinations under Exemptions 4 and 6 to HHS. See Brooks Decl. Exs. K, M.\n\nOn April 12, 2011, HHS denied the plaintiff’s appeal of the Purdue withholdings and redactions.\n\nBrooks Decl. Ex. N. “A decision was not made on the appeal regarding Pfizer’s documents prior\n\nto the filing of this lawsuit.” Brooks Decl. ¶ 20.\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\f         C.       Procedural History\n\n         The plaintiff filed the instant lawsuit on September 16, 2011, against HHS. See Compl. ¶\n\n1. The unopposed motions of Pfizer and Purdue to intervene were granted on November 18 and\n\nDecember 7, 2011, respectively. See Minute Orders dated November 18, 2011 and Dec. 7, 2011.\n\nHHS thereafter filed two Vaughn indices, one pertaining to Pfizer and one pertaining to Purdue,\n\non March 7, 2012. See Vaughn Index of Withheld Pfizer Inc. Documents (“Pfizer Vaughn\n\nIndex”), ECF No. 18; Vaughn Index of Withheld Purdue Pharma L.P. Documents (“Purdue\n\nVaughn Index”), ECF No. 19.\n\n         The plaintiff now challenges the adequacy of HHS’s search for “Pfizer IRO responses\n\nand corrective action plans,” which the plaintiff claims “were not clearly identified in the\n\nVaughn Index of withheld Pfizer documents.” Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. and Opp’n\n\nto Def.’s and Def.-Intervenor’s Mots. Summ. J. (“Pl.’s Mem.”) at 38, ECF No. 26. In addition,\n\nthe plaintiff challenges HHS’s withholdings under Exemptions 4 and 6 of the following eight\n\ncategories of records included in the Annual Reports: (1) “Reportable Events”; 5 (2) Disclosure\n\nLog summaries; 6 (3) screening and removal of Ineligible Persons; 7 (4) summaries of government\n\ninvestigations or legal proceedings; (5) communications with the Food and Drug Administration\n\n5\n  The CIAs define “Reportable Events” as “anything that involves a matter . . . that a reasonable person would\nconsider a probable violation of criminal, civil, or administrative laws applicable to any Federal health care program\nand/or any FDA requirements relating to the labeling or promotion of products for which penalties or exclusion may\nbe authorized.” Purdue CIA at 19–20; see Pfizer CIA at 21.\n6\n  Each company was required by its CIA to “maintain a disclosure log, which shall include a record and summary of\neach disclosure received (whether anonymous or not), the status of the respective internal reviews, and any\ncorrective action taken in response to the internal reviews.” Purdue CIA at 17; Pfizer CIA at 19. The referenced\ndisclosures were made in connection with “a disclosure program,” which “includes a mechanism . . . to enable\nindividuals to disclose, to the Compliance Officer or some other person who is not in the disclosing individual’s\nchain of command, any identified issues or questions associated with Pfizer’s policies, conduct, practices, or\nprocedures with respect to a Federal health care program requirements [sic] or FDA requirements believed by the\nindividual to be a potential violation of criminal, civil, or administrative law.” Pfizer CIA at 18; see also Purdue\nCIA at 16 (same).\n7\n  An “Ineligible Person” “is currently excluded, debarred, suspended, or otherwise ineligible to participate in Federal\nhealth care programs or in Federal procurement or nonprocurement programs; or has been convicted of a criminal\noffense that falls within the ambit of 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7(a), but has not yet been excluded, debarred, suspended, or\notherwise declared ineligible.” Pfizer CIA at 19; Purdue CIA at 17\n\n                                                          7\n\f(“FDA”) about off-label promotion; (6) portions of Pfizer’s off-label findings and detailing\n\nsessions; 8 (7) portions of IRO reports pertaining to, inter alia, the IRO’s findings and\n\nrecommendations, the companies’ compliance programs, “corrective action taken by the\n\ncompany,” and the “IRO’s description of the company’s systems, policies, procedures, and\n\npractices,” Pl.’s Mem. at 28–29; 9 and (8) Purdue’s supplement, dated June 18, 2009, to its first\n\nAnnual Report, which was submitted on September 25, 2008 (“2009 Purdue Supplement”). 10\n\nSee Pl.’s Mem. at 9–13 & n.3, ECF No. 27.\n\n        With the exception of the 2009 Purdue Supplement, the parties have not identified the\n\nspecific documents in the Vaughn indices that are covered by each of the broad challenged\n\ncategories and, thus, has left the Court to speculate as to which specific withheld documents are\n\nactually at issue in this lawsuit and which documents the parties agree were appropriately\n\nwithheld. Certainly, the combined use Vaughn indices and detailed declarations is an acceptable\n\npractice for an agency to justify its application of an exemption. See Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\n\nFDA, 449 F.3d 141, 148 (D.C. Cir. 2006) ( agency’s “decision to tie each document to one or\n\nmore claimed exemptions in its index and then summarize the commonalities of the documents\n\nin a supporting affidavit is a legitimate way of serving the same functions” of the Vaughn index\n\nby “organiz[ing] the withheld documents in a way that facilitates litigant challenges and court\n\nreview of the agency’s withholdings”). Nevertheless, the declarations are most helpful when tied\n\n8\n  “Detailing sessions” are mandated intensive reviews of commercially available records Pfizer was required to\nobtain to determine the content of any discussions between Pfizer sales representatives and health care providers\nregarding potential off-label uses for Pfizer medications during a one week period each quarter. See Pfizer CIA at\n22–23. Pfizer was required to make findings based on this review and take any corrective action necessary. Id. at\n23. The findings and corrective actions were required to be submitted to the OIG. Id. Purdue’s CIA did not contain\nthis requirement.\n9\n  Pfizer and Purdue were required to retain “Independent Review Organizations” to “assess[] and evaluate[] [their]\nsystems, processes, policies, and practices” relating to certain programs. Pfizer CIA at 14; see also Purdue CIA at\n14.\n10\n   The plaintiff refers to this document as a “cover memorandum for a supplement to its first annual report,” Pl.’s\nMot. at 2, ECF No. 26, and attached the heavily redacted released copy of the document as an exhibit. Murray Decl.\nEx. 3, Attach. E at 30-37, ECF No. 26-3.\n\n                                                        8\n\fto the specific documents described in the indices. See id. at 150 (remanding case for further\n\nexplanation, noting that “[p]roving the merits of the exemption does no good if the court cannot\n\ntie the affidavits to the documents”); Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 800 F. Supp.\n\n2d 202, 214 (D.D.C. 2011) (finding “that the DOJ’s Vaughn indices and declarations are\n\nadequate” where “declarations work in conjunction with the Vaughn indices by dividing the\n\nwithheld documents into specific categories based on the nature of the document (the category\n\nnumbers are cross-referenced accordingly in the Vaughn indices), linking each category (and in\n\nturn each document) to a particular FOIA exemption, and articulating what the documents in\n\neach group reflect and why they fall within the specified FOIA exemption”). The lack of\n\nspecificity in this case regarding both the identification of withheld documents in the Vaughn\n\nindices that are at issue and the precise connection between the documents discussed in the\n\ndeclarations and the documents listed in the Vaughn indices, has significantly complicated the\n\nCourt’s task of resolving the plaintiff’s challenge.\n\nII.    LEGAL STANDARD\n\n       Congress enacted the FOIA as a means “to open agency action to the light of public\n\nscrutiny.” Am. Civil Liberties Union v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 655 F.3d 1, 5 (D.C. Cir. 2011)\n\n(quoting Dep’t of Air Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. 352, 361 (1976)). As the Supreme Court has\n\n“consistently recognized [] the basic objective of the Act is disclosure.” Chrysler Corp. v.\n\nBrown, 441 U.S. 281, 290 (1979). At the same time, the statute represents a “balance [of] the\n\npublic’s interest in governmental transparency against legitimate governmental and private\n\ninterests that could be harmed by release of certain types of information.” United Techs. Corp. v.\n\nU.S. Dep’t of Def., 601 F.3d 557, 559 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (“United Technologies”) (internal\n\ncitations omitted). Reflecting that balance, the FOIA contains nine exemptions set forth in 5\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fU.S.C. § 552(b), which “are explicitly made exclusive and must be narrowly construed.” Milner\n\nv. U.S. Dep’t of Navy, 131 S. Ct. 1259, 1262 (2011) (internal quotations and citations omitted)\n\n(citing FBI v. Abramson, 456 U.S. 615, 630 (1982)); see also Pub. Citizen v. Ofc. of Mgmt. and\n\nBudget, 598 F.3d 865, 869 (D.C. Cir. 2010). “[T]hese limited exemptions do not obscure the\n\nbasic policy that disclosure, not secrecy, is the dominant objective of the Act.” Rose, 425 U.S. at\n\n361.\n\n       The agency invoking an exemption to the FOIA has the burden “to establish that the\n\nrequested information is exempt.” Fed.

Cir. 2003) (holding that the agency “bears the burden of establishing the applicability of\n\nthe claimed exemption”). In order to carry this burden, an agency must submit sufficiently\n\ndetailed affidavits or declarations, a Vaughn index of the withheld documents, or both, to\n\ndemonstrate that the government has analyzed carefully any material withheld, to enable the\n\ncourt to fulfill its duty of ruling on the applicability of the exemption, and to enable the adversary\n\nsystem to operate by giving the requester as much information as possible, on the basis of which\n\nhe can present his case to the trial court. Oglesby v. United States Dep't of the Army, 79 F.3d\n\n1172, 1176 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (“The description and explanation the agency offers should reveal\n\nas much detail as possible as to the nature of the document, without actually disclosing\n\ninformation that deserves protection…[which] serves the purpose of providing the requestor with\n\na realistic opportunity to challenge the agency's decision.”); Tax Analysts v. IRS, 410 F.3d 715,\n\n720 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (noting that, to avoid voluminous Vaughn index submissions, court\n\npermissibly relied on a mix of deposition testimony, declarations, a Vaughn index, and in camera\n\nreview to evaluate agency’s withholding determinations).\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\f       A district court must review the Vaughn index and any supporting declarations “to verify\n\nthe validity of each claimed exemption.” Summers v. Dep’t of Justice, 140 F.3d 1077, 1080\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1998). The FOIA provides federal courts with the power to “enjoin the agency from\n\nwithholding records and to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld from\n\nthe complainant.” 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(B). Moreover, a district court has an “affirmative duty” to\n\nconsider whether the agency has produced all segregable, non-exempt information. Elliott v.\n\nU.S. Dep’t of Agric., 596 F.3d 842, 851 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (referring to court’s “affirmative duty to\n\nconsider the segregability issue sua sponte”) (quoting Morley v. CIA, 508 F.3d 1108, 1123 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2007)); Stolt-Nielsen Transp.

DISCUSSION\n\n         The plaintiff raises two issues regarding HHS’s response to its FOIA request: the\n\nadequacy of the defendant’s search and the appropriateness of the Exemption 4 withholdings. 11\n\nEach of these issues is addressed seriatim below.\n\n         A.       The Adequacy of HHS’s Search\n\n         The plaintiff contends that the defendant’s search for records responsive to the request for\n\nPfizer Annual Reports was inadequate because certain documents referenced in released\n\ndocuments were not identified in the Vaughn Index of withheld Pfizer documents or released to\n\nthe plaintiff. See Pl.’s Mem. at 38. Specifically, the plaintiff contends that Pfizer stated in each\n\nof its Annual Reports that the company’s response to the IRO’s findings and recommendations,\n\nand any other observations, would be provided to the OIG, as necessary, under separate cover, at\n\n\n11\n  All of the documents withheld by the defendant under Exemption 6, which exempts from disclosure “personnel or\nmedical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy,” 5\nU.S.C. § 552(b)(6), are also withheld under Exemption 4. In construing Exemption 6, the D.C. Circuit has held that\n“the disclosure of names and addresses is not inherently and always a significant threat to the privacy of those listed;\nwhether it is a significant or a de minimis threat depends upon the characteristic(s) revealed by virtue of being on the\nparticular list, and the consequences likely to ensue.” Nat’l Ass’n of Retired Fed. Employees v. Horner, 879 F.2d\n873, 877 (D.C. Cir. 1989). “Exemption 6’s requirement that disclosure be ‘clearly unwarranted’ instructs us to ‘tilt\nthe balance (of disclosure interests against privacy interest) in favor of disclosure.’” Morley, 508 F.3d at 1127 (D.C.\nCir. 2007) (quoting Wash. Post Co. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health and Human Servs., 690 F.2d 252, 261 (D.C. Cir. 1982)).\nHere, the defendant’s declarant states that the only information withheld under Exemption 6 consists of “employee\nnames and personal identifying information, such as telephone numbers and email addresses.” Brooks Decl. ¶ 27.\nThe plaintiff has clarified that it is not challenging the withholding of names, phone numbers, signatures, or email\naddresses of any individuals. Pl.’s Mem. at 36. Thus, given that the plaintiff is not contesting the application of\nExemption 6 to the information withheld on this basis, no Exemption 6 challenge is before the Court.\n\n                                                          12\n\fa later date. Murray Decl., Ex. 3 Attach. H (containing Pfizer’s statements regarding later\n\nsubmission of CIA Section III.D Responses in Annual Reports submitted for 2004-2009, at OIG-\n\n000066; OIG-001862; OIG-003715; OIG-005864; OIG-007893). These responses were\n\nspecifically required by Section V.B.6 of Pfizer’s CIA (“Section V.B.6 documents”). Pfizer CIA\n\nat 25. The plaintiff contends that the Section V.B.6 documents, which Pfizer was required to\n\nsubmit, and presumably did submit to the OIG, are “missing” and the defendant “does not appear\n\nto have acknowledged these missing documents or attempted a follow-up search to find them.”\n\nId. at 38. The defendant does not dispute that Pfizer submitted to the OIG its comments\n\nresponding to the IRO Reports, as required in Section V.B.6 of the CIA and referenced in each\n\nAnnual Report, or that such documents are responsive to the FOIA request. Rather, the\n\ndefendant disputes that Pfizer’s Section V.B.6 documents are missing and instead asserts that\n\nthey were identified in the search and withheld, as described in the Pfizer Vaughn index entries\n\n174, 175 and 176. See Def.’s Reply at 5.\n\n       In support of its position that “the very information that Plaintiff claims establishes that\n\nthe search was inadequate is accounted for in the Vaughn index,” the defendant highlights the\n\ninformation set forth in the Pfizer Vaughn index entries 174, 175 and 176. Id. These three\n\nentries, 174, 175 and 176, describe three letters, which were released with virtually all text\n\nredacted, from Pfizer’s counsel to the OIG, dated February 13, 2006, February 19, 2008 and\n\nNovember 11, 2009, respectively, as follows: “This letter and the accompanying attachments\n\ncontain confidential information related to communication with the OIG regarding Pfizer’s\n\nresponses to the OIG’s review of Pfizer’s Annual Report. These documents contain confidential\n\ninformation regarding IRO reviews and reports as well as Pfizer’s responses thereto and\n\nexcerpts from certain Pfizer policies and verbatim.” Id. (emphasis in original).\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\f       The defendant’s response that the plaintiff’s challenge to the adequacy of the search for\n\nPfizer documents “fails as a factual matter,” Def.’s Reply at 5, has two fundamental problems.\n\nFirst, the documents described in the Pfizer Vaughn Index entries 174, 175 and 176 relate only to\n\nthe first, third, and possibly the final 2009 Annual Reports. See Supplemental Decl. of Julie\n\nMurray, Counsel to Public Citizen, (“Murray Suppl. Decl.”) Ex. 1, Attachs. D, E, F, ECF No. 34-\n\n1 (Feb. 13, 2006 letter states submission is “regarding Pfizer’s first Annual Report;” Feb. 19,\n\n2008 letter states “Re: Follow-up to the Third Annual Report;” and the last letter is dated Dec.\n\n11, 2009 letter, which is after submission of fifth Annual Report). Thus, the Section V.B.6\n\ndocuments released in part and described in the Pfizer Vaughn index are only for three Annual\n\nReports (first, third and last), even though the company indicated in its Annual Reports for all\n\nfive years that it was filing Section V.B.6 documents. Nowicki Decl. ¶ 12. Thus, it appears that\n\nPfizer’s Section V.B.6 documents for at least two years were neither released to the plaintiff nor\n\nreferenced in the Vaughn index and, thus, are correctly deemed “missing” by the plaintiff. Pl.’s\n\nMem. at 38.\n\n       Second, the plaintiff challenges whether the documents described at Pfizer Vaughn Index\n\nentries 174, 175 and 176, which the defendant points to as evidence of the adequacy of its search,\n\nare actually the Section V.B.6 documents. See Pl’s Reply in Supp. Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. (“Pl.’s\n\nReply”) at 20–21, ECF No. 34. The plaintiff’s declarant submitted copies of the heavily redacted\n\nversions of the documents corresponding to Vaughn index numbers 174, 175 and 176. See\n\nMurray Suppl. Decl., Ex. 1 Attachs. D, E, and F (Bates Nos. OIG-009386, OIG-009420, OIG-\n\n009428). The opening paragraphs of each letter indicate that Pfizer is responding to specific\n\nOIG requests for additional information, but nowhere indicate that this information is provided to\n\ncomply with the CIA’s Section V.B.6. The plaintiff claims that these documents “provide only\n\n\n\n                                                14\n\f‘supplemental information that [OIG] requested’ in response to Pfizer’s annual reports,” Pl.’s\n\nReply at 20, rather than submitting Pfizer’s own independent “review [of] the Internal Review\n\nOrganizations findings and recommendations, and any other observations . . . pursuant to Section\n\nIII.D” of the CIA. See, e.g., Murray Decl. Ex. 3 Attach. H, Bates No. OIG-003715; Murray\n\nSuppl. Decl. Ex. 1 Attach. F, Bates No. OIG-009428. Thus, as a factual matter, the plaintiff has\n\nraised a significant question as to whether the letters listed in the Vaughn index entries 174, 175\n\nand 176 actually correspond to the information referenced in the CIA’s Section V.B.6.\n\n          The defendant nowhere adequately explains these factual discrepancies. Rather, the\n\ndefendant’s fallback position is that the law does not require the agency to do any more\n\nsearching since the agency has demonstrated in affidavits that it “conducted a reasonable\n\nsearch,” and no bad faith has been alleged. Def.’s Reply at 4. While “the adequacy of a FOIA\n\nsearch is generally determined not by the fruits of the search, but by the appropriateness of the\n\nmethods used to carry out the search,” see Iturralde v. Comptroller of Currency, 315 F.3d 311,\n\n315 (D.C. Cir. 2003), “if a review of the record raises substantial doubt, particularly in view of\n\n‘well defined requests and positive indications of overlooked materials, summary judgment is\n\ninappropriate,” Valencia-Lucena v. U.S. Coast Guard, 180 F.3d 321, 326 (D.C. Cir. 1999)\n\n(quoting Founding Church of Scientology v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, 610 F.2d 824, 837 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1979)).\n\n          In this case, the defendant concedes the existence of Pfizer Section V.B.6 documents\n\nrequired to be submitted to the OIG on an annual basis under the CIA, by pointing to the three\n\nheavily redacted letters described in the Pfizer Vaughn Index entries 174, 175 and 176.\n\nMoreover, the existence of these documents is confirmed by the released portions of five annual\n\nreports referencing the “later” submission of the Section V.B.6 documents. See Murray Decl. Ex.\n\n\n\n                                                 15\n\f3 Attach. H (Bates Nos. OIG-000066, OIG-001862, OIG-003715, OIG-005864 and OIG-\n\n007893). Therefore, at a minimum, Pfizer’s Section V.B.6 documents for two annual reports,\n\nwhich the defendant does not dispute should exist and should have been accounted for, are not\n\nrepresented in the Vaughn index, nor has the defendant provided any explanation as to what steps\n\nit undertook to track down these missing documents.\n\n       That the defendant was under an obligation to do so is made clear in Campbell v. United\n\nStates Department of Justice, 164 F.3d 20, 28 (D.C. Cir. 1998). In Campbell, the D.C. Circuit\n\nheld that an agency must “revise its assessment of what is [a] ‘reasonable’ [search] in a particular\n\ncase to account for leads that emerge during its inquiry.” Id. at 28. In other words, when leads\n\nto other documents arise during the course of a search for responsive records, the agency must\n\nexpand the scope of its search. Id. This does not mean that “mere reference to other files” that\n\nare relevant to a FOIA request triggers an obligation for the agency to expand a search since “[i]f\n\nthat were the case, an agency responding to FOIA requests might be forced to examine virtually\n\nevery document in its files, following an interminable trail of cross-referenced documents like a\n\nchain letter winding its way through the mail.” Steinberg v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 23 F.3d 548,\n\n552 (D.C. Cir. 1994); see also Morley, 508 F.3d at 1121. Yet, when, as here, the agency\n\nconcedes that responsive documents exist and, further, that its search should have recovered\n\nthose documents, by stating as a factual matter that they were, in fact, located, summary\n\njudgment is inappropriate when the plaintiff raises substantial factual questions about those\n\nassertions. Indeed, the D.C. Circuit has instructed that “a court may place significant weight on\n\nthe fact that a records search failed to turn up a particular document in analyzing the adequacy of\n\na records search.” Iturralde, 315 F.3d at 315 (citing Krikorian v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 984 F.2d\n\n461, 468 (D.C. Cir. 1993)). As the D.C. Circuit explained in Valencia-Lucena, “what causes us\n\n\n\n                                                16\n\fto conclude that the search was inadequate arises from the fact that the record itself reveals\n\npositive indications of overlooked materials.” 180 F.3d at 326 (internal quotations omitted).\n\n         Here, there can be no doubt that, in the course of a search for responsive records, the\n\ndefendant was or became aware that Pfizer’s Section V.B.6 documents for five annual reports,\n\nnot just three such reports, should exist. Yet, the defendant offers no explanation, and cites to no\n\nproduced document, to account for the missing records for at least two annual reports. Although\n\nthe defendant is correct that “a search is not unreasonable simply because it fails to produce all\n\nrelevant material,” Meeropol v. Meese, 790 F.2d 942, 952-53 (D.C. Cir. 1986), the defendant\n\nwas affirmatively obligated to make an effort to find the two missing year’s responses when the\n\n“leads” to those documents are obvious. See Campbell, 164 F.3d at 28.\n\n         Moreover, neither the redacted records produced nor the Pfizer Vaughn Index sufficiently\n\nindicates that entries 174, 175 and 176 are actually the Section V.B.6 documents that Pfizer was\n\nrequired to produce under Section III.D and Section V.B.6 of the CIA, as all three letters appear\n\nto be responding to direct questions from the OIG, rather than Pfizer’s own findings and\n\nrecommendations in response to an IRO Report. Therefore, the defendant has not sustained its\n\nburden of showing the adequacy of its search and may either supplement its declarations to\n\naddress the factual questions raised by the plaintiff about the Pfizer Section V.B.6 documents or\n\nperform an additional search to locate the missing records. 12\n\n\n\n\n12\n  The defendant also argues that because no challenge to the adequacy of the search was raised during the\nadministrative appeal, the plaintiff has failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. See Def.’s Reply at 5 n.1. As\nthe plaintiff rightfully points out, however, the inadequacy of the defendant’s search was not apparent until after the\nagency filed its Vaughn indices, which show that Pfizer Section V.B.6 documents for at least two, if not all five,\nannual reports are missing. The Court, therefore, rejects this defense to the plaintiff’s challenge to the adequacy of\nthe search.\n\n                                                          17\n\f         B.       Exemption 4 Withholdings\n\n         Under the FOIA, “trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a\n\nperson” that is “privileged or confidential” may be withheld from disclosure. 5 U.S.C. §\n\n552(b)(4). 13 If the documents are not trade secrets, to sustain the burden of showing that\n\nExemption 4 was properly applied, an agency must establish that the withheld records are “(1)\n\ncommercial or financial, (2) obtained from a person, and (3) privileged or confidential.” Pub.\n\nCitizen Health Research Grp. v. FDA, 704 F.2d 1280, 1290 (D.C. Cir. 1983). No party to this\n\naction disputes the second prong of this test, nor could they, as the statute makes clear that a\n\n“person includes an individual, partnership, corporation, association, or public or private\n\norganization other than an agency.” 5 U.S.C. § 551(2) (emphasis added). Nor do the defendant\n\nand defendant-intervenors claim that the withheld documents are “financial.” See Def. Mem.\n\ngenerally; Declaration of Peter J. Claude, Partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP (“Claude\n\nDecl.”), ECF No. 22-2; Mem. Supp. Def.-Intervenor Pfizer’s Mot. Summ. J. (“Pfizer Mem.”),\n\nECF No. 23-1, generally.\n\n         The parties contest only whether, under the first and third prongs of the test, the eight\n\ncategories of challenged, withheld documents are “commercial” materials and, if so, whether\n\nthey are “privileged or confidential.” To resolve this dispute, the Court will first examine the\n\nscope of the term “commercial” in the FOIA context and address the plaintiff’s contention that\n\nany document referring to illegal or potentially illegal activity falls outside the meaning of this\n\n\n13\n   Although neither of the companies whose documents are at issue have claimed trade secret protection, the\ndefendant HHS has asserted, with only limited evidentiary support and no further discussion, that “the materials\nwithheld under Exemption 4 also constitute trade secrets.” Def. Mem., 8 n.1, ECF No. 22; see also Declaration of\nPeter J. Claude, Partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“Claude Decl.”) ¶ 13, ECF No. 22-2 (“In addition to being\ncommercially valuable, some of these procedures should be considered to contain trade secrets, as I understand that\nterm is defined by the OIG. These procedures are the product of innovation and are developed through substantial\neffort.”). These conclusory statements, without any effort to show that the documents satisfy the requisite elements\nfor trade secret protection, are wholly insufficient to support such a finding. Thus, as do the parties, the Court will\nfocus on whether the withheld records are “commercial” information.”\n\n                                                          18\n\fterm. Next, the Court will review each category of documents at issue and assess whether the\n\ndefendant and defendant-intervenors have met their burden of showing that challenged, withheld\n\nrecords contain commercial information. Finally, for any category of documents found to\n\ncontain commercial information, the Court will evaluate whether the information is confidential\n\nor privileged.\n\n                  1.       Scope of “Commercial” Information.\n\n         The term “commercial” is not defined in the FOIA. 14 Absent a precise statutory\n\ndefinition or clarity from the legislative history, the D.C. Circuit has “consistently held that [this]\n\nterm . . . in [Exemption 4] should be given [its] ordinary meaning[].” Pub. Citizen Health\n\nResearch Group, 704 F.2d at 1290; see also Nat’l Ass’n of Home Builders v. Norton, 309 F.3d\n\n26, 38 (D.C. Cir. 2002); Bd. of Trade v. Commodity Futures Trading Co., 627 F.2d 392, 403-404\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1980) abrogated on other grounds by U.S. Dep’t of State v. Wash. Post Co., 456 U.S.\n\n595 (1982); accord Perrin v. United States, 444 U.S. 37, 42 (1979) (“A fundamental canon of\n\nstatutory construction is that, unless otherwise defined, words will be interpreted as taking their\n\nordinary, contemporary, common meaning.”). “[I]nformation is commercial under this\n\nexemption if, in and of itself, it serves a commercial function or is of a commercial nature.”\n\nNat’l Ass’n of Home Builders, 309 F.3d at 38 (citing Am. Airlines, Inc. v. Nat’l Mediation Bd.,\n\n588 F.2d 863, 870 (2d Cir. 1978)) (internal quotations omitted). Thus, “records that actually\n\nreveal basic commercial operations, such as sales statistics, profits and losses, and inventories, or\n\nrelate to the income-producing aspects of a business,” fall within the scope of “commercial”\n\ninformation. See Pub. Citizen Health Research Grp., 704 F.2d at 1290. For instance, documents\n14\n   The D.C. Circuit has concluded that the legislative history about the meaning of the key terms used in Exemption\n4 is “unhelpful,” since while “Congress clearly indicated that Exemption 4 as a whole could cover such materials as\n‘business sales statistics, inventories, customer lists, [and] scientific or manufacturing processes or developments,’\nH.R. REP. No. 1497, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 10, reprinted in 1966 U.S. CODE CONG. & AD.

Supp. 4, 6 (D.D.C. 1981) (finding\n\nthat Exemption 4 shielded information “much more sensitive than mere prices,” such as “audits\n\nof private concessions in national parks; technical proposals for development of a system to\n\nanalyze gases generated by petroleum refineries; general selling prices, inventory balances, profit\n\nmargins, purchase activity, freight charges, costs of goods sold, and customer names, obtained\n\nfrom a utility in the course of a government investigation; appraised value for customs duty\n\nassessment purposes of imported machinery parts; design recommendations, design concepts, a\n\ncustomer list, and biographical data on key employees; and computer usage, manpower\n\nallocation, travel costs, biographical data on employees, and detailed cost data from a contract\n\nwith the Government”) (internal citations omitted).\n\n       The scope of “commercial” information has also been applied more broadly to records\n\ncontaining information in which the provider of the records has “a commercial interest.” Baker\n\n& Hostetler LLP v. U.S. Dep’t of Commerce, 473 F.3d 312, 319 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (finding letters\n\ndescribing favorable market conditions for domestic lumber companies “plainly contain\n\ncommercial information within the meaning of Exemption 4”). For example, in Public Citizen\n\nHealth Research Group, the court found that “documentation of the health and safety experience\n\nof [the company’s] products” was commercial because such documentation was “instrumental in\n\ngaining marketing approval for their products.” 704 F.2d at 1290. At issue in Public Citizen\n\n\n\n                                                20\n\fHealth Research Group were reports submitted to the FDA about the safety of certain medical\n\ndevices in order to show the products were sufficiently safe to enter the marketplace. Id.\n\nAlthough not “commercial” in the sense of reflecting sales or profit-and-loss figures, the court\n\nfound that the reports fit comfortably within the broader definition of “commercial” that\n\nexamines whether the provider has a commercial interest in the documents because they are\n\nhelpful or “instrumental” to its business interests. Id.; see also Critical Mass Energy Project v.\n\nNuclear Regulatory Comm’n, 830 F.2d 278, 281 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (holding that non-profit\n\norganization’s reports describing the operations of members’ nuclear power plants contained\n\n“commercial” information since disclosure of health and safety problems resulting from\n\noperation of nuclear power facilities could materially affect “commercial fortunes” of members).\n\n        Pfizer urges an even broader construction of Exemption 4, stating that “a company has a\n\n‘commercial interest’ in all records that relate to every aspect of the company’s trade or\n\nbusiness.” Pfizer’s Mem. in Opp’n to Pl.’s MSJ & Reply in Supp. of Def.’s MSJ (“Pfizer\n\nReply”) at 6, ECF No. 31. This is plainly incorrect. See, e. g., Getman v. NLRB, 450 F.2d 670,\n\n673 (D.C. Cir. 1971) (“a bare list of names and addresses of employees which employers are\n\nrequired by law to give the [agency] . . . cannot be fairly characterized as . . . ‘financial’ or\n\n‘commercial’ information”); Nat’l Bus. Aviation Ass’n v. FAA, 686 F. Supp. 2d 80, 86–87\n\n(D.D.C. 2010) (list of aircraft registration numbers was not sufficiently “commercial” to qualify\n\nfor Exemption 4 withholding even though certain commercial information could be deduced\n\nfrom other publicly available sources in conjunction with the requested documents); Chicago\n\nTribune Co. v. FAA, No. 97 C 2363, 1998 WL 242611 at *3 (N.D. Ill. May 7, 1998) (finding that\n\nFederal Aviation Administration records pertaining to in-flight medical emergencies did not have\n\na sufficiently “direct relationship with the operations of a commercial venture” to qualify for\n\n\n\n                                                  21\n\fwithholding under Exemption 4). Indeed, the D.C. Circuit has explained that “the reach of the\n\nexemption for ‘trade secrets or commercial or financial information’ is not necessarily\n\ncoextensive with the existence of competition in any form.” Wash. Research Project, Inc. v. U.S.\n\nDep’t of Health, Educ. and Welfare, 504 F.2d 238, 244 (D.C. Cir. 1974). Thus, the D.C. Circuit\n\nhas cautioned that, consistent with the narrow construction given to FOIA exemptions, “[n]ot\n\nevery bit of information submitted to the government by a commercial entity qualifies for\n\nprotection under Exemption 4.” Pub. Citizen Health Research Grp., 704 F.2d at 1290.\n\n       The plaintiff argues that many of the challenged withheld documents fail to qualify as\n\n“commercial” information because “[i]nformation about a company’s violation of laws and\n\nregulations is not commercial in nature.” Pl.’s Mem. at 17. In support, the plaintiff seizes upon\n\nlanguage in Critical Mass Energy Project v. Nuclear Regulatory Comm’n, 975 F.2d 871 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1992) (en banc) (“Critical Mass”), generally describing the exemptions in the FOIA as\n\ndesigned to protect “legitimate governmental and private interests.” Id. at 872. Thus, according\n\nto the plaintiff’s argument, the FOIA necessarily excludes from the coverage of Exemption 4\n\n“information about suspected or confirmed illegal conduct by the companies or their employees\n\nand the companies’ corrective action . . . to comply with applicable laws,” Pl.’s Mem. at 17,\n\nbecause protecting against the disclosure of potential illegal conduct is a non-legitimate goal.\n\n       The defendant counters that commercial information does not lose the protection of\n\nExemption 4 “even when that information was directly related to the potential wrongdoing.”\n\nDef.’s Reply at 8. The Court agrees with the defendant for three reasons. First, the language\n\nfrom Critical Mass relied upon by the plaintiff is too thin a reed to support the weight of its\n\nargument. The D.C. Circuit’s use of the qualifying word “legitimate,” referred to the interests\n\nserved by the entire FOIA, not just Exemption 4. See Critical Mass, 975 F.2d at 872. This\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\fjudicial qualifier does not apply as an over-arching limit on the scope of any particular term used\n\nin the FOIA and, thus, cannot be read to limit the types of “commercial” activities subject to\n\nExemption 4.\n\n         Second, the plaintiff’s proposed construction of Exemption 4 would impose on this\n\nstatutory provision a limitation which is simply not supported by the plain text. On the contrary,\n\nthe term “commercial” is generally defined to mean “engaged in commerce” or “having\n\nreference to, or bearing on commerce.” Commercial, NEW OXFORD AM. DICTIONARY at 341 (2d\n\nEd. 2005) (“concerned with or engaged in commerce; making or intending to make a profit”);\n\nCommercial, MERRIAM-WEBSTER’S COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY at 231 (10th Ed. 1999) (“occupied\n\nwith or engaged in commerce or work intended for commerce; viewed with regard to a profit”);\n\nCommercial Activity, BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY at 38, (9th Ed. 2009) (“An activity, such as\n\noperating a business, conducted to make a profit); see also Carlson v. U.S. Postal Serv., 504 F.3d\n\n1123, 1129 (9th Cir. 2007) (“[I]nformation is commercial if it relates to commerce, trade, or\n\nprofit”) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Thus, using its ordinary meaning, the\n\nterm “commercial” is not limited only to lawful activities but also extends more broadly to any\n\ntype of activity bearing on commerce.\n\n         Several of the cases cited by the defendant support this plain text meaning of the term\n\n“commercial.” 15 In ISC Group, Inc. v. United States Department of Defense, Civ. A. No. 88-\n\n0631, 1989 WL 168858, at *2-3 (D.D.C. May 22, 1989), the court found that “financial\n\nsummaries and forecasts, inventory and labor data, and other financial analyses” contained in a\n\n\n15\n   Two of the cases relied upon by the defendant are unhelpful since the parties in those cases did not dispute\nwhether the requested documents were “commercial;” consequently, the courts did not confront, let alone consider,\nthe issue of whether documents containing information about illegal conduct could also qualify as “commercial”\nunder Exemption 4. See Am. Mgmt. Servs., LLC v. Dep’t of the Army, 842 F. Supp. 2d 859, 880 (D.D.C. 2012) (“It\nis undisputed that the information in question is ‘commercial or financial.’”); Hersh & Hersh v. U.S. Dep’t of Health\nand Human Servs., C 06-4234, 2008 WL 901539, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 31, 2008) (“[S]ince there is no other dispute\nas to whether the information qualifies as commercial or financial . . . .”).\n\n                                                         23\n\freport investigating potential fraud in Department of Defense contracts were “commercial or\n\nfinancial” information subject to Exemption 4. The fact that certain of this financial information\n\nalso reflected fraudulent activity was not a disqualifier for withholding. See also M/A-Com Info.\n\nSys., Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health and Human Servs., 656 F. Supp. 691, 692 (D.D.C. 1986)\n\n(holding that the agency properly withheld under Exemption 4 documents containing\n\n“accounting and other internal procedures [the submitting company] was willing to undertake to\n\nobtain by consent dismissal of the debarment action without admission of liability or resolution\n\nof the facts in dispute.”).\n\n        Similarly, in Watkins v. United States Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, 643\n\nF.3d 1189 (9th Cir. 2011), the Ninth Circuit rejected a FOIA requester’s contention that\n\n“Notices of Seizures” for allegedly counterfeit goods were not “commercial” because they\n\npertained to “the unlawful importation of counterfeit goods, and not any sort of legitimate\n\ncommercial activity.” Id. at 1195. Noting that such Notices are not “final determinations that\n\ngoods seized are counterfeit,” but are more “akin to a finding of probable cause,” the court\n\nexplained that “we cannot conclude that information contained in a Notice of Seizure is non-\n\ncommercial just because it’s likely — perhaps even very likely — that the merchandise seized is\n\ncounterfeit.” Id. Since the Notices disclose “intimate aspects of an importers business such as\n\nsupply chains and fluctuations of demand for merchandise,” the court further found that they\n\n“contain plainly commercial information.” Id.\n\n        Finally, the third reason to reject the plaintiff’s argument to exclude from the scope of\n\n“commercial” any “suspected or confirmed unlawful conduct,” Pl.’s Mem. at 1, is that it is based\n\non an error of reasoning by fallaciously imputing the properties of a “part” to the properties of\n\nthe “whole.” Specifically, the overall commercial nature of an undertaking is not altered when\n\n\n\n                                                 24\n\fsome aspect of that activity is suspected to constitute, or actually results in, a violation of a rule,\n\nregulation or statutory requirement. This is particularly true in the context of a heavily regulated\n\nindustry, such as pharmaceuticals. The Ninth Circuit in Watkins implicitly recognized the\n\nfundamental unfairness that would result if the protection of Exemption 4 were unavailable to\n\nwithhold otherwise confidential commercial documents of a company simply because the\n\ncompany was accused of wrongdoing, noting that, in some cases, “importers sometimes\n\nacquiesce in the Agency’s seizure and forfeiture of legitimate goods,” even without proof of\n\nlegal violation. 643 F.3d at 1195 (emphasis in original).\n\n        Although the Court finds unpersuasive the plaintiff’s argument that any information\n\nrelated to potential wrongdoing categorically falls outside Exemption 4, this does not mean that\n\nall of the withheld information submitted pursuant to the CIAs is automatically commercial. The\n\ndefendant must provide sufficient justification about each category of challenged documents to\n\nshow that the withheld documents are, indeed, “commercial” within the meaning of Exemption\n\n4. As discussed in more detail below, the Vaughn indices and declarations fall short in many\n\ninstances of the level of specificity the FOIA requires.\n\n                2.      Sufficiency of Showing That Withheld Documents Are “Commercial”\n\n        Set against the broad scope of the term “commercial,” the Court next examines each\n\nchallenged category of withheld documents to determine whether they meet this prerequisite for\n\napplication of Exemption 4. In this regard, the Court is mindful that the defendants bear the\n\nburden of establishing the applicability of this exemption and that “conclusory and generalized\n\nallegations of exemptions are unacceptable.” Morley, 508 F.3d at 1115 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). With respect to each category of withheld documents, the defendant makes only the\n\nconclusory statement that “[t]he records contain Pfizer and Purdue’s commercial or financial\n\ninformation.” Brooks Decl. ¶ 25. The Vaughn indices offer no additional details on this critical\n                                                   25\n\fquestion. See Pfizer Vaughn Index, Purdue Vaughn Index, generally. Consequently, as set forth\n\nbelow, the Court relies primarily upon the declarations of the defendant-intervenors to tease out\n\nany information regarding whether the withheld documents are “commercial” for the purposes of\n\nExemption 4.\n\n                       a. Reportable Event Summaries\n\n       Under the terms of the CIAs, Reportable Events are those events where “a reasonable\n\nperson would consider a probable violation of criminal, civil, or administrative laws applicable\n\nto any Federal health care program and/or any FDA requirements relating to the labeling or\n\npromotion of products for which penalties or exclusion may be authorized.” Purdue CIA at 19–\n\n20; see also Pfizer CIA at 21. Each company was required to notify the OIG within 30 days of\n\n“determining that the Reportable Event exists.” Purdue CIA at 20; Pfizer CIA at 21. In those\n\nreports, the companies were required to provide “a complete description of the Reportable Event,\n\nincluding relevant facts, persons involved, and legal and Federal health care program authorities\n\nimplicated,” “a description of [the company’s] actions taken to correct the Reportable Event,”\n\nand “any further steps [the company] plans to take to address the Reportable Event and prevent it\n\nfrom recurring.” Pfizer CIA at 21–22; see also Purdue CIA at 20.\n\n       Similarly to HHS, Purdue’s declarant does not discuss whether the Reportable Event\n\nsummaries are commercial at all but merely skips over this critical factor to focus on the “highly\n\nconfidential and privileged” nature of this information. See Weinstein Decl. ¶ 25 (“Because a\n\nReportable Event is the subject of highly confidential and privileged internal investigations\n\nundertaken at Purdue to determine the underlying facts and potential violations, public disclosure\n\nof the event would cause Purdue commercial injury.”); Brooks Decl. generally. Pfizer’s\n\ndeclarant states that “[t]he Reportable Event summary logs contain highly sensitive commercial\n\ninformation about the Reportable Event itself as well as Pfizer’s internal investigation of the\n                                                26\n\fReportable Event and any corrective actions taken.” Nowicki Decl. ¶ 26. More specifically,\n\n“[t]he Reportable Event summaries often contain sales and marketing tactics, analysis of\n\ncompliance with the CIA and any corrective actions taken.” Id. ¶ 27 (emphasis added). The\n\nimport of this statement is that Pfizer’s summaries do not always contain information regarding\n\n“sales and marketing.”\n\n       The Court could speculate that Reportable Event summaries could reveal information\n\nabout the companies’ activities in a specific place, at a specific time, and involving specific\n\nactivity with respect to a particular product and customer, all of which could in context be\n\nconsidered “commercial” information. Such speculation is not the Court’s job, however. See\n\nCoastal States Gas Corp. v. U.S. Dep’t of Energy, 617 F.2d 854, 870 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (“The\n\ncourts will not speculate as to whether [the] Exemption [] might, under some possible\n\ncongruence of circumstances not proven or even asserted be properly applied to these\n\ndocuments, nor will we assume that all the necessary conditions are met merely because the\n\nagency invokes an exemption.”); Founding Church of Scientology, 603 F.2d at 949 (“The\n\nreviewing court should not be required to speculate on the precise relationship between each\n\nexemption claim and the contents of the specific document.”).\n\n       Without more information about the commercial nature of the information contained in\n\nthe Reportable Event summaries, the Court has insufficient information to evaluate whether the\n\nsummaries contain commercial information and are being properly withheld. Consequently, the\n\nCourt denies summary judgment to the plaintiff and the defendants regarding the challenged\n\ncategory of withheld documents containing Reportable Event summaries.\n\n                       b. Disclosure Log Summaries\n\n       The companies were required by their CIAs to “maintain a disclosure log, which shall\n\ninclude a record and summary of each disclosure received” by the company’s compliance officer\n                                                 27\n\fregarding the potential violation of “criminal, civil, or administrative law.” See Purdue CIA at\n\n16–17; Pfizer CIA at 18–19. As described by Pfizer’s declarant, “[t]he Disclosure Logs contain\n\ninformation regarding reports (some of which are made anonymously) by individuals to Pfizer’s\n\nCompliance Officer (or his designee) regarding potential violations of criminal, civil or\n\nadministrative laws as required by the CIA. The Disclosure Logs contain summaries of reports\n\nmade, status of the internal review of the issue(s) raised in the reports, and any corrective actions\n\ntaken in response.” Nowicki Decl. ¶ 32.\n\n        The declarants for the defendants focus on the highly confidential nature of the disclosure\n\nlog summaries, but do not address the key issue of whether this category of withheld documents\n\ncontains commercial information. Id. (“This information is highly confidential”); Weinstein\n\nDecl. ¶ 22 (“The Disclosure Log is maintained in a proprietary and highly confidential\n\ndatabase.”). Again, the Court will not speculate. See Coastal States Gas Corp., 617 F.2d at 870;\n\nFounding Church of Scientology, 603 F.2d at 949. Without more information about the\n\ncommercial nature of the information contained in the disclosure log summaries, the Court has\n\ninsufficient information to evaluate whether these documents are being properly withheld.\n\nConsequently, the Court denies summary judgment to the plaintiff and the defendants regarding\n\nthe challenged category of withheld documents containing the disclosure log summaries.\n\n                          c. Ineligible Persons Information\n\n        Each company is required by their CIA to “ensure that all current Covered Persons 16 are\n\nnot Ineligible Persons,” meaning that they are not “currently excluded, debarred, suspended, or\n\notherwise ineligible to participate in the Federal health care programs or in Federal procurement\n\nor nonprocurement programs” or have “been convicted of a criminal offense that falls within the\n\n16\n  A “Covered Person” is defined in Purdue’s CIA to “include[]: all owners, officers, directors and employees [of the\ncompany]” and all contractors, not including part time employees or people not involved in the business operations\nof the company. See Purdue CIA at 2–3. The definition in Pfizer’s CIA is similar. See Pfizer CIA at 2–3.\n\n                                                        28\n\fambit of 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7(a), but ha[ve] not yet been excluded, debarred, suspended, or\n\notherwise declared ineligible.” Pfizer CIA at 19–20; Purdue CIA at 17–18. The companies are\n\nrequired to include in their Annual Reports two key items of information relating to enforcement\n\nof the CIAs provisions regarding Ineligible persons: (1) “any changes to the process by which\n\n[the company] fulfills” the Ineligible Persons requirement, and (2) “the name, title, and\n\nresponsibilities of any person who is determined to be an Ineligible Person.” Purdue CIA at 28;\n\nPfizer CIA at 25.\n\n       Purdue’s declarant does not address this category of withheld documents except to say\n\nPurdue’s “proposed actions regarding ineligible persons[] all directly relate to Purdue’s\n\ncompliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and are proprietary in nature.” Weinstein\n\nDecl. ¶ 15. Pfizer’s declarant offers a similarly general statement that “[t]his information reflects\n\nPfizer’s internal business processes and judgments made to develop and implement the Ineligible\n\nPerson Management process as well as confidential information related to Pfizer’s screening and\n\nremoval of Ineligible Persons.” Nowicki Decl. ¶ 29.\n\n       With respect to the first item of information, which requires the defendant-intervenors to\n\nnotify the OIG of “any changes to the process by which [the company] fulfills the requirements\n\nof [the CIA] regarding Ineligible Persons,” Pfizer CIA at 25, Purdue CIA at 28, such\n\nmodifications to internal processes are sufficiently commercial to qualify for Exemption 4\n\nbecause they involve the process by which the companies make decisions about managing and\n\nconducting their business operations. Such information is “instrumental” to conducting business\n\nbecause such individuals must be vetted and, when necessary, removed from the defendant-\n\nintervenors’ employ to allow the company to continue a significant part of its business with\n\nfederal health care programs. Pfizer CIA at 20; Purdue CIA at 18–19. Consequently,\n\n\n\n                                                 29\n\finformation concerning changes to processes regarding the screening or removal of Ineligible\n\nPersons amounts to “commercial” information under Exemption 4. 17\n\n         By contrast, the second item of information relating to Ineligible Persons consists only of\n\nthe “name, title, and responsibilities of any person who is determined to be an Ineligible Person.”\n\nPfizer CIA at 25 (Section V.B.11), Purdue CIA at 28 (Section V.B.12). This information is static\n\nand does not appear to have anything to do with the ongoing creation or selling of products, nor\n\ndoes this information appear to be “instrumental” to conducting commerce. Indeed, no\n\ndefendant declarant has provided any information revealing how such information could be\n\n“commercial.” Accord Getman, 450 F.2d at 673 (holding that list of names and addresses of\n\nemployees are not ‘commercial’ information”); Comptel v. F.C.C., 910 F. Supp. 2d 100, 116\n\n(D.D.C. 2012) (“The FCC has not met its burden to show that names and contact information\n\nshould be exempt as confidential commercial or financial information. . . . While the Court\n\nassumes corporations can have a commercial interest in the names of certain staff, it is not a\n\ncertainty that a corporation would have a commercial interest in the names of every one of its\n\nemployees.”). Consequently, the Court grants summary judgment to the plaintiff and orders the\n\nrelease of any documents withheld under Exemption 4 because they contain the “title and\n\nresponsibilities of any person who is determined to be an Ineligible Person.” 18 See Pfizer CIA\n\n(Section V.B.11); Purdue CIA (Section V.B.12).\n\n                           d. Investigations Or Legal Proceedings\n\n         The CIAs require the companies to, “[w]ithin 30 days after discovery . . . notify OIG, in\n\nwriting, of any ongoing investigation or legal proceeding . . . conducted or brought by a\n\n17\n   The Court must still determine, as discussed in Section III.B.3.b, infra, whether these withheld documents are\n“privileged or confidential” for application of Exemption 4.\n18\n   The plaintiff has made clear that it is not seeking “names, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, or signatures of\nindividuals named in withheld documents.” Pl.’s Mem. at 2. Any such personally identifiable information may be\nredacted from released documents.\n\n                                                         30\n\fgovernmental entity or its agents involving an allegation that [the company] has committed a\n\ncrime or has engaged in fraudulent activities.” Purdue CIA at 19 (Section III.G); see also Pfizer\n\nCIA at 21 (Section III.G). The “notification shall include a description of the allegation, the\n\nidentity of the investigating or prosecuting agency, and the status of such investigation or legal\n\nproceeding.” Purdue CIA at 19 (Section III.G); see also Pfizer CIA at 21 (Section III.G).\n\nAdditionally, the companies are to “provide written notice to OIG within 30 days after the\n\nresolution of the matter, and shall provide OIG with a description of the findings and/or results\n\nof the investigation or proceedings, if any.” Purdue CIA at 19; see also Pfizer CIA at 21.\n\n       The reporting requirement for investigatory or legal proceedings consists of three parts:\n\n(1) the description of the allegation; (2) the identity of the agency conducting the investigation;\n\nand (3) the status of the investigation or proceeding. The defendants’ declarants do not expressly\n\naddress the commercial nature of any part of this category of withheld documents. Instead,\n\nPurdue’s declarant stresses that “[p]ublic disclosure of this information, which includes non-\n\npublic legal and/or regulatory actions, such as with a Reportable Event, would certainly have\n\nnegative commercial consequences for Purdue.” Weinstein Decl. ¶ 26. Similarly, Pfizer’s\n\ndeclarant states that “release of such information would cause Pfizer competitive harm and could\n\nbe useful to Pfizer’s adversaries in current litigation.” Nowicki ¶ 28.\n\n       The legal proceedings described in this category of withheld document pertain to\n\nallegations of the company’s criminal or fraudulent conduct. Although the defendants do not\n\nexpressly say so, common sense dictates that such allegations about the company itself relate to\n\nthe conduct of employees and/or policies and practices of management in the operation of the\n\ncompanies’ business and thereby implicate the companies’ “commercial interests.” While the\n\nsupport for this conclusion in the declarations from the defendant and defendant-intervenors is\n\n\n\n                                                 31\n\fthin, the definition of the reporting requirement in the CIAs provides sufficient context for the\n\nCourt to reach this conclusion. Therefore, the first part of the reporting requirement regarding a\n\ndescription of the allegation is “commercial” under Exemption 4.\n\n       The other two parts of this reporting requirement, however—the identity of the agency\n\nconducting the investigation and the status of the investigation—do not appear to be\n\n“commercial,” and nothing in the declarations is provided to assist the Court is reaching any\n\nother conclusion. The identify of an outside agency conducting an investigation and that\n\ninvestigation’s status (e.g., closed, ongoing, active, stayed, dormant, etc.) would not, standing\n\nalone, reveal any information about the business operations or other commercial activities of the\n\ndefendant-intervenors. While the defendant-intervenors’ declarants indicate that release of the\n\nbroad category of information would cause competitive harm or be of some use to “adversaries\n\nin current litigation,” Nowicki Decl. ¶ 28, the basis for these assertions is unexplained. While\n\nthe Court appreciates that revealing the existence of an investigation, even if the status is closed,\n\nmay be embarrassing or harmful to the reputation of a company, the law is well-settled that this\n\npotential consequence of a disclosure does not convert the information into “commercial” under\n\nExemption 4. The D.C. Circuit made this point clearly in United Technologies. There, defense\n\ncontractors sought to use Exemption 4 to shield the release of information on the ground that\n\nthey would suffer competitive harm because “their competitors will use the documents to\n\ndiscredit them in the eyes of current and potential customers” and their “reputation will suffer as\n\na result.” United Technologies, 601 F.3d at 563. The court bluntly rejected this argument, stating\n\n“Exemption 4 does not protect against this species of harm,” and further explaining that\n\n“[c]alling customers’ attention to unfavorable agency evaluations or unfavorable press does not\n\namount to an ‘affirmative use of proprietary information by competitors.’” Id. at 563–64. In\n\n\n\n                                                 32\n\fshort, “Exemption 4 does not guard against mere embarrassment in the marketplace or\n\nreputational injury.” Id. at 564; see also Occidental Petroleum Corp. v. SEC, 873 F.2d 325, 341\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1989) (holding that a submitter’s “right to an exemption, if any, depends upon the\n\ncompetitive significance of whatever information may be contained in the documents, not upon\n\nwhether its motive is to avoid embarrassing publicity”); CNA Fin. Corp. v. Donovan, 830 F.2d\n\n1132, 1154 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (noting that public embarrassment to a corporation does not warrant\n\nwithholding material under Exemption 4).\n\n       The identities of the agencies conducting the investigations and the status of those\n\ninvestigations are not “commercial” for Exemption 4 purposes. Therefore, the Court grants\n\nsummary judgment to the plaintiff and orders the release of any documents withheld because\n\nthey contain the identity of the agency conducting the investigation and the status of the\n\ninvestigation or proceeding.\n\n                       e. Company Communications with FDA About Off-Label Promotions\n\n       The CIAs require each company to provide copies of communications from the FDA that\n\n“substantively discuss . . . unlawful or improper promotion of [the company’s] products or the\n\nmisbranding of [the company’s] products.” Purdue CIA at 20; see Pfizer CIA at 22; Nowicki\n\nDecl. ¶ 30 (clarifying that this provision of Pfizer’s CIA is limited to “unlawful or improper\n\npromotion of [the company’s] products,” and does not include “misbranding”). Although the\n\ndefendants’ declarants say nothing about the commercial nature of these communications, again,\n\nthe Court may rely on the definition in the CIA to determine that the subject matter of the\n\ncommunications expressly relates to promotion of the companies’ products. Since this category\n\nof withheld documents pertains to the marketing and sale of the companies’ products, the Court\n\nfinds that these documents are “commercial” within the meaning of Exemption 4.\n\n\n\n                                                33\n\f                        f. Pfizer’s Off-Label Findings And Detailing Sessions\n\n        Pfizer, and not Purdue, was required to “provide to OIG a list and explanation of all\n\nactively promoted Pfizer products and, if available from third parties, information about the\n\nestimated relative usage . . . of those products for off-label purposes.” Pfizer CIA at 22.\n\nFurthermore, in each Annual Report, “Pfizer shall obtain commercially available non-Pfizer\n\nrecords reflecting the purported content and subject matter of detailing interactions between sales\n\nrepresentatives and [health care providers] for the Covered Products.” Id. After obtaining these\n\nthird party records, “Pfizer shall review the records . . . and shall identify any instances in which\n\nthe records appear to indicate that Covered Person may have discussed and/or disseminated\n\ninformation about off-label uses of the Covered Products.” Id. at 23. “Pfizer shall make findings\n\nbased on its review . . . and shall take any responsive action it deems necessary.” Id. Pfizer was\n\nrequired to provide these underlying documents and findings as part of its Annual Report. Id.\n\n        Pfizer’s declarant explains that the details it provides to the OIG about its “Review of\n\nDetailing Sessions . . . includes detailed information regarding Pfizer’s internal review and\n\nmonitoring of sales representative activities that are designed to ensure compliance with FDA\n\npromotional and other legal requirements.” Nowicki Decl. ¶ 33. This declarant further states\n\nthat this information also describes “the manner in which Pfizer addresses potential violations of\n\nCompany policies and procedures.” Id. The description of the subject matter of this category of\n\nchallenged, withheld documents is sufficiently specific to demonstrate that these documents\n\npertain to sales representative activities, and reflect activities “instrumental” to Pfizer’s\n\ncommercial operations because compliance with FDA regulations is required for Pfizer to sell its\n\nproducts. Therefore, the Court finds that the category of withheld documents regarding Pfizer’s\n\noff-label findings and detailing sessions are “commercial” for purposes of Exemption Four.\n\n\n\n                                                  34\n\f                       g. Independent Review Organization Reports\n\n       The CIAs require each company to engage an IRO to review its transactions, systems,\n\nand compliance activities. See Purdue CIA at 14; Pfizer CIA at 14. The IROs are required to\n\nprovide the companies with detailed reports regarding the IRO’s findings and, in turn, the\n\ncompanies are required to provide summaries and assessments of changes made as a result of the\n\nIRO findings. See Purdue CIA at 15; Pfizer CIA at 16–18. Pfizer’s declarant explains that the\n\nIRO’s role “is to make an independent evaluation of Pfizer’s ‘Promotional and Product Related\n\nFunctions.’” Nowicki Decl. ¶ 21. In performing this task, the IRO reports contain detailed\n\ninformation about Pfizer’s “managed care contracting process,” policies and procedures “relating\n\nto responses to financial programs” and “policies and procedures relating to responses for\n\nmedical information requests.” Def.’s Mem. at 18. Pfizer’s declarant further describes the\n\ncontents of the IRO reports as containing information “related to Pfizer’s internal structure and\n\noperations, how the company interacts with [health care providers] and the medical community,\n\nand Pfizer’s policies governing the selling, detailing, marketing, advertising, promoting and\n\nbranding of . . . all Pfizer human pharmaceutical products.” Nowicki Decl. ¶ 22. Purdue’s\n\ndeclarant states that the IRO report contains “an extensive, probing review of Purdue’s\n\nconfidential business systems and policies, as well as selected samples of individual\n\ntransactions.” Weinstein Decl. ¶ 20. These reports contain such information as the identity of\n\ncustomers and the underlying business practices that gave rise to the need for corrective action.\n\nId.\n\n       This description of the information contained in the IRO reports is sufficiently detailed to\n\nleave the Court no doubt that these documents include extensive information about the\n\ndefendant-intervenors’ marketing and sales programs and contracting processes, and,\n\nconsequently, are commercial under Exemption 4.\n                                                35\n\f                       h. 2009 Purdue Supplement\n\n       The plaintiff challenges the withholding of the 2009 Purdue Supplement, which it\n\ndescribes as the “transmittal memorandum and supplement to Purdue’s first annual compliance\n\nreport.” Pl.’s Mem. at 26. According to the plaintiff this “cover memorandum” to OIG was\n\nproduced only in heavily redacted form. Id. The Purdue Vaughn Index states that the “withheld\n\nportions of the document [under Exemption 4] contain information regarding Purdue’s\n\npromotional monitoring program and other confidential and proprietary policies and\n\nprocedures.” Purdue Vaughn Index No. 22. A promotional monitoring program falls within the\n\nscope of commercial information under Exemption 4 because it pertains directly to the methods\n\nby which Purdue sells its products.\n\n       Yet, the vague reference in the Purdue Vaughn Index to “other confidential and\n\nproprietary policies” is insufficient to allow the Court to determine whether those portions of the\n\ndocument are commercial under Exemption 4. Purdue Vaughn Index No. 22. Thus, to the extent\n\nthat the 2009 Purdue Supplement pertains to its promotional monitoring program, the Court finds\n\nthat it is “commercial” within the meaning of Exemption 4. Given the paucity of information\n\nprovided in the declarations and Purdue Vaughn Index about the other portions of the document,\n\nhowever, it is impossible for the Court to determine whether the entire document contains\n\ncommercial information and whether any non-commercial information can be segregated from\n\nthe commercial information. Therefore, the Court denies summary judgment to all parties\n\npertaining to the “other confidential and proprietary policies” as to the segregable parts of the\n\n2009 Purdue Supplement.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 36\n\f                                         *       *      *\n\n       In sum, the following categories, or sub-parts of categories, of challenged, withheld\n\ndocuments are not “commercial,” and the Court grants summary judgment to the plaintiff with\n\nrespect the portions of the Annual Reports that require the defendant-intervenors to report on: (1)\n\nthe “name, title, and responsibilities of any person determined to be an Ineligible Person,”\n\npursuant to the Purdue CIA §§ III.F and V.B.12, and the Pfizer CIA §§ III.F and V.B.11; and (2)\n\nthe identity of the agency conducting, and status of, an investigation or proceeding, pursuant to\n\nthe Purdue CIA §§ III.G and V.B.13, and the Pfizer CIA §§ III.G and V.B.15.\n\n       Due to the insufficiency of the declarations and Vaughn indices, the Court is unable to\n\nassess for the following categories, or sub-parts of categories, of challenged, withheld documents\n\nwhether the subject matter is “commercial” for the purpose of Exemption 4: (1) Reportable\n\nEvent summaries, submitted pursuant to §§ III.H and V.B.9 of the Purdue CIA, and §§ III.H and\n\nV.B.12 of the Pfizer CIA; (2) disclosure log summaries, submitted pursuant to the §§ III.E and\n\nV.B.10 of the Purdue CIA, and §§ III.E and V.B.14 of the Pfizer CIA ; and (3) references to\n\n“other confidential and proprietary policies” in the 2009 Purdue Supplement. The Court will\n\ngive the defendant and defendant-intervenors the opportunity to supplement their declarations\n\nand/or Vaughn indices to sustain their burden of showing the commercial nature of these\n\ndocuments or, alternatively, to release them. See Comptel v. FCC, No. 06-1718, 2013 WL\n\n2171793, at *7 (D.D.C. May 20, 2013) (after denying summary judgment without prejudice to\n\ngive agency opportunity to file supplemental information, court reviewed amended declarations\n\nand Vaughn index, stressing that agency “has the burden to show that the information redacted is\n\ncommercial or financial, in addition to demonstrating that it was obtained from a person and is\n\nprivileged or confidential”).\n\n\n\n                                                37\n\f         The Court has been able to conclude, based upon the context and the CIAs’ definitions, in\n\nconjunction with the declarations and Vaughn indices, that the following categories, or sub-parts\n\nof categories, of challenged, withheld documents are “commercial” for the purposes of\n\nExemption 4: (1) changes to the processes by which the companies fulfill the Ineligible Persons\n\nrequirement in Section III.F of the Purdue and Pfizer CIAs; (2) the description of the allegations\n\nsubject to investigations or legal proceedings required to be included in the Annual Reports,\n\npursuant to § III.G of the Purdue and Pfizer CIAs; (3) company communications with the FDA\n\nregarding off-label promotions required to be included in the Annual Reports, pursuant to § III.I\n\nof the Purdue and Pfizer CIAs; (4) Pfizer’s off-label findings and detailing sessions required to\n\nbe included in the Annual Reports, pursuant to §§ III.J and V.B.17 of the Pfizer CIA; (5) IRO\n\nreports required to be included in the Annual Reports, pursuant to §§ III.D and V.B.5-8 of the\n\nPurdue CIA, and §§ III.D and V.B.6-9 of the Pfizer CIA; and (6) the portions of the 2009 Purdue\n\nSupplement addressing Purdue’s promotional monitoring program. The Court next examines the\n\nsufficiency of the showing that these commercial documents are confidential to warrant\n\napplication of Exemption 4.\n\n                  3.        Sufficiency of Showing That Commercial Documents Are Confidential\n\n         A “commercial” document may only be withheld under Exemption 4 if it is\n\n“privileged” 19 or “confidential.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4). A two prong test is used to determine\n\n\n19\n    Pfizer argues that all of the challenged documents fall under the “self-evaluation and self-critical reports”\nprivilege for Exemption 4 purposes. Pfizer Mem. at 22. The Court is not persuaded by Pfizer’s tortured reading of\nCircuit precedent. Pfizer cites only a single, unpublished district court case from this Circuit to support its\nproposition that “courts have long recognized” a self-evaluative privilege. Id. (citing Washington Post Co. v. Dep’t\nof Justice, Civil Action No. 84-3581, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14936, at *21 (D.D.C. Sept. 25, 1987)). As Pfizer\npoints out, that case was reversed on other grounds. See Wash. Post Co. v. Dep’t of Justice, 863 F.2d 96, 99 (D.C.\nCir. 1988). Indeed, in remanding that case for consideration of the applicability of a FOIA exemption other than\nExemption 4, the D.C. Circuit court reserved judgment as to whether Exemption 4 encompasses a self-evaluative\nprivilege. Id. (“We will decide the exemption (4) question” if “the report [at issue] is not shielded under exemption\n(7)(B)”). Notably, the D.C. Circuit has rejected the use of the “self-evaluative privilege in the context of private\nlitigation . . . where… the documents in question have been sought by a governmental agency,” FTC v. TRW, Inc.,\n\n                                                         38\n\fwhether information involuntarily submitted to a Federal agency is “confidential” for FOIA\n\npurposes. “Commercial or financial matter is ‘confidential’ for purposes of the exemption if\n\ndisclosure of the information is likely to have either of the following effects: (1) to impair the\n\nGovernment’s ability to obtain necessary information in the future; or (2) to cause substantial\n\nharm to the competitive position of the person from whom the information was obtained.” Nat’l\n\nParks and Conserv. Ass’n v. Morton, 498 F.2d 765, 770 (D.C. Cir. 1974) (“National Parks”); see\n\nalso B.d of Trade v. Commodity Futures Trading Com., 627 F.2d 392, 404 (D.C. Cir. 1980). As\n\ndiscussed below, the Court examines the sufficiency of the showing by the defendant and\n\ndefendant-intervenors that the release of the withheld commercial documents would either\n\n“impair the Government’s ability to obtain necessary information in the future,” id., or “cause\n\nsubstantial harm to the competitive position” of Pfizer or Purdue. 20\n\n\n\n628 F.2d 207, 210 (D.C. Cir. 1980), and has cautioned that “federal courts should not create evidentiary privileges\nlightly . . . and we would unlikely fashion a privilege lacking in historical or statutory basis,” First E. Corp. v.\nMainwaring, 21 F.3d 465, 467 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). As this Court noted in\nMahnke v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, the “self-evaluative” privilege is “rarely recognized”\nand “[c]ourts are ‘reluctant to expand [the privilege] beyond cases involving public health or safety.’” 821 F. Supp.\n2d 125, 150 n.16 (D.D.C. 2011) (citations omitted) [alterations in the original]. No case from any federal court has\nbeen cited by the parties in which the “self-evaluative privilege” was successfully used to justify the withholding of\ndocuments under Exemption 4. The Court declines to extend whatever self-evaluative privilege may exist in the\ncivil discovery context to shield from disclosure under Exemption 4 reports involuntarily provided to a government\nagency and, thus, only considers whether the commercial documents withheld in this case are also confidential.\n20\n   The bar is lower for withholding confidential information voluntarily provided to the Government: voluntarily\nsubmitted information need only be “of a kind that would customarily not be released to the public by the person\nfrom whom it was obtained” to be withheld as confidential. Critical Mass, 975 F.2d at 878. While HHS and\nPurdue, which joined HHS’ arguments, concede that the companies’ submissions to OIG were involuntary, Pfizer\ncontends that because it entered into its CIA with HHS voluntarily, the information required by the CIA was also\nproduced voluntarily. See Pfizer Mem. at 16–17. Pfizer’s argument is contrary to the law of this Circuit. “For\npurposes of Exemption 4, information provided to the government because it is required for participation in a\nvoluntary government program is treated as a mandatory, as opposed to a voluntary, submission of information.”\nJudicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of the Treasury, 796 F. Supp. 2d 13, 35 n.8 (D.D.C. 2011); see also Ctr. for Auto\nSafety v. Nat’l Highway Traffic Safety Admin., 244 F.3d 144, 149 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (holding that when an agency has\n“actual legal authority” to compel production of information, such production is not voluntary for the purposes of\nthe FOIA); Pub. Citizen Health Research Grp. v. F.D.A., 964 F. Supp. 413, 414 n.1 (D.D.C. 1997) (“Information is\nsubmitted involuntarily, however, if it is supplied pursuant to statute, regulation or some less formal mandate.”).\nPfizer does not dispute that the documents at issue were “submitted to the OIG in accordance with the terms of the\n2004 CIA.” Pfizer Mem. 16. As such, the information was submitted involuntarily because it was submitted\n“pursuant to statute, regulation, or some less formal mandate.” Pub. Health Research Grp., 964 F. Supp. at 414 n.1.\nTherefore, the Court will apply the more stringent confidentiality standard applicable to involuntarily submitted\ndocuments recognized in National Parks and Critical Mass.\n\n                                                         39\n\f                        a. The Government’s Ability to Obtain Necessary Information\n\n        The defendant argues that the release of the withheld documents would harm the\n\ngovernment’s interest in two ways. “First, health care providers currently under CIAs would be\n\nreluctant to provide complete information,” citing as an example that “providers may hesitate to\n\nfully explain the circumstances or submit their full investigative reports if they are concerned\n\nthat the public may have access to that information [regarding instances of possible\n\nnoncompliance].” Def.’s Mem. at 26. “Second, the OIG’s inability to prevent the disclosure of\n\nconfidential proprietary information would severely impair [HHS’s] ability to negotiate\n\nmeaningful CIAs in the future.” Id. Neither argument is persuasive.\n\n        First, the Court is skeptical of the defendant’s contention that release of the withheld\n\ncommercial information could jeopardize the government’s ability to obtain full and complete\n\nreporting as required under the CIAs. The court in Critical Mass was similarly skeptical about\n\nimpairment of the government’s ability to obtain information when the submission was required.\n\nCritical Mass, 975 F.2d at 878 (“because the concessioners [were] required to provide this\n\nfinancial information . . . there is presumably no danger that the public disclosure will impair the\n\nability of the Government to obtain this information in the future”) (alteration in original).\n\nInstead, the D.C. Circuit explained that the focus is on the risk that disclosure may adversely\n\naffect the “continued reliability” or “quality” of the information obtained by the government, not\n\nits availability. Id.\n\n        With respect to the “quality” of the submissions, the government is well-protected by the\n\npenalty terms of the CIAs for breaches of the reporting requirements. The CIAs contain\n\nextensive monetary and injunctive penalties for violations of the agreement, including exclusion\n\nfrom federal health care programs, the so-called “death penalty.” See Purdue CIA at 32–38;\n\nPfizer CIA at 30–36. For instance, if Pfizer were to fail “to report a Reportable Event and take\n                                                 40\n\fcorrective action, as required in Section III.H,” Pfizer could be considered in material breach of\n\nthe agreement. Pfizer CIA at 33 (Section X.D.1.a) “The parties agree that a material breach of\n\nthe CIA by Pfizer constitutes an independent basis for Pfizer’s exclusion from participation in\n\nthe federal health care programs.” Id. at 34 (Section X.D.2). Other failures to adhere fully to the\n\nCIA can lead to substantial monetary penalties. See Pfizer CIA at 31–32 (Section X.A); Purdue\n\nCIA at 32–33 (Section X.A). Thus, the defendant has a variety of methods by which to\n\nguarantee the continued completeness and accuracy of the reports submitted by these and other\n\ncompanies subject to CIAs.\n\n        The defendant’s second argument about future trouble negotiating CIAs is similarly\n\nunavailing, and largely for the same reason: namely, that the alternative to full compliance with\n\nthe CIAs is a potentially draconian penalty. CIAs are entered into as part of “the resolution of\n\ncivil and administrative health care fraud cases.” Demske Decl. ¶ 2. The incentive to enter into\n\nsuch an agreement is that “the OIG agrees not to seek an exclusion of that entity from\n\nparticipation in Federal health care programs.” Id. Exclusion from Federal health care programs\n\nis such a severe penalty that it is known in the healthcare industry as “a corporate death\n\nsentence.” Kesselheim Decl. ¶ 9. It strains credulity to believe that the specter of potential\n\ndisclosure under the FOIA of certain information required to be submitted to the agency pursuant\n\nto a CIA’s requirements would lead a pharmaceutical company to choose instead the risk of\n\nexclusion from federal drug reimbursement programs. Indeed, “nearly every” Department of\n\nJustice investigations into the types of behavior that led to Pfizer and Purdue’s original CIAs\n\n“has resulted in a settlement with the defendant pharmaceutical manufacturer, with\n\n\n\n\n                                                41\n\fmanufacturers choosing not to risk a finding of guilt at trial and exclusion from engaging in\n\nfederal health programs.” Id. 21\n\n         Purdue’s declarant seeks to bolster the defendant’s impairment argument by stating that\n\n“It was critical to Purdue during negotiation of the CIA with OIG that the materials Purdue\n\nwould submit to OIG would be kept confidential and not subject to disclosure under FOIA.”\n\nSupplemental Declaration of Bert Weinstein, Vice-President of Corporate Compliance, Purdue\n\nPharma, (“Weinstein Suppl. Decl.”) ¶ 2, ECF No. 29-1. This is belied by other language\n\nincluded in the CIA, however, which makes clear that submitted information may be subject to\n\ndisclosure under the FOIA. While the CIA permits Purdue to “clearly identify any portions of its\n\nsubmissions that it believes are trade secrets, or information that is commercial or financial and\n\nprivileged or confidential, and therefore potentially exempt from disclosure under the Freedom\n\nof Information Act,” Purdue CIA at 30, the final determination must be left up to the agency.\n\nSee 5 U.S.C. § 552(a). In any event, merely because it was important to Purdue “that the\n\nmaterials Purdue would submit to OIG” be shielded from disclosure is not the same as saying\n\nPurdue would not have signed the CIA without such assurances. Purdue, notably, never makes\n\nsuch an argument, nor does the defendant agency.\n\n\n\n\n21\n  The defendant briefly cites two cases for its position that the first prong of the National Parks test is met and\nrelease of the documents would impair the government’s ability to secure CIAs with companies in the future, but\nneither case is persuasive. The context in Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Export-Import Bank, 108 F. Supp. 2d 19 (D.D.C.\n2000), differs materially from the instant case. In Judicial Watch, the Export-Import Bank established that if\ndisclosure of the withheld records at issue were required, the “Bank’s function of providing insurance would be\nundermined” and its ability “to fulfill its statutory purpose” would be impaired. Id. at 29–30. The defendant here\nnowhere claims that disclosure would have such dire results as impairing its ability to carry out its statutory purpose.\nThe other case cited by the defendant is likewise inapposite. In Hersh and Hersh v. United States Department of\nHealth and Human Services, No. C 06-4234, 2008 WL 901539 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 31, 2008), the court deferred to the\nagency’s assertion about impairment of the government interest, as was appropriate since, unlike in the instant case,\nthat assertion was not substantively challenged. Id. at *7 (“Plaintiff, moreover, presents no adequate grounds to hold\notherwise,” noting that the plaintiff’s only argument was that certain information submitted under the CIA had been\ntemporarily, inadvertently disclosed and the erroneous belief that the CIA report at issue had been publicly filed\nwith the SEC).\n\n                                                          42\n\f        The defendant’s concern about its ability to negotiate future CIAs is, at most, minor,\n\nsince the enticement for companies to enter into CIAs to avoid the “corporate death sentence”\n\nwill continuing to be compelling. “A minor impairment cannot overcome the disclosure mandate\n\nof FOIA.” Wash. Post Co. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health and Human Servs., 690 F.2d 252, 269 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1982). Therefore, the Court finds that the defendant has not shown how the release of the\n\nwithheld documents will “impair the Government’s ability to obtain necessary information in the\n\nfuture.” National Parks, 498 F.2d at 770.\n\n                          b. Competitive Harm\n\n        The Court next examines the second prong of the National Parks test: whether the agency\n\nhas sufficiently shown that release of the withheld information is likely to “cause substantial\n\nharm to the competitive position of the person from whom the information was obtained.” Id. at\n\n770; see also Pub. Citizen Health Research Grp. v. FDA, 704 F.2d at 1290-91 (D.C. Cir. 1983);\n\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. U.S. Dep’t of Air Force, 375 F.3d 1182, 1187 (D.C. Cir. 2004)\n\n(party invoking Exemption 4 is not required “to prove disclosure certainly would cause it\n\nsubstantial competitive harm, but only that disclosure would ‘likely’ do so”). Not all harm to the\n\ninformation provider qualifies as “competitive harm.” As noted, the D.C. Circuit has made clear\n\nthat, “[i]n this inquiry, it is simply irrelevant that” confidential treatment of the documents would\n\navoid disclosure of information “that might be damaging to [the provider’s] reputation.”\n\nOccidental Petroleum Corp., 873 F.2d at 341 (D.C. Cir. 1989). To qualify as “substantial\n\ncompetitive harm,” the harm must be “limited to harm flowing from the affirmative use of\n\nproprietary information by competitors.” Pub. Citizen Health Research Grp., 704 F.2d at 1291\n\n& n.30 (emphasis in the original). 22\n\n\n22\n  The defendant spills a great deal of ink on the argument that “when a company invests time and other resources\ninto developing policies and procedures, among other things, they will face competitive harm if those products are\n\n                                                        43\n\f         Based upon the Court’s foregoing analysis, the following challenged records are\n\n“commercial” and must meet this second prong of the National Parks test to be appropriately\n\nwithheld under Exemption 4: (1) changes to the processes by which the intervenor-defendants\n\nfulfill the Ineligible Persons requirement; (2) the description of the allegations subject to\n\ninvestigations or legal proceedings; (3) company communications with the FDA regarding off-\n\nlabel promotions; (4) Pfizer’s off-label findings and detailing sessions; (5) IRO reports; and (6)\n\nthe portions of the 2009 Purdue Supplement addressing Purdue’s promotional monitoring\n\nprogram. Each of these categories of commercial documents is examined below to evaluate the\n\nsufficiency of the showing that disclosure would cause substantial competitive harm to the\n\ndefendant-intervenors.\n\n         In reviewing the sufficiency of the declarations and Vaughn indices, the Court is mindful\n\nthat merely conclusory statements about competitive harm, even if repeated numerous times, are\n\nnot sufficient. See Pub. Citizen Health Research Grp., 704 F.2d at 1290-1291 (“Conclusory and\n\ngeneralized allegations of substantial competitive harm, of course, are unacceptable and cannot\n\nsupport an agency's decision to withhold requested documents.”); Occidental, 873 F.2d at 342\n\n(requiring more than “conclusory statement” regarding substantial competitive harm); Wash.\n\nPost Co., 690 F.2d at 269 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (“[T]he government produced no evidence except a\n\nconclusory affidavit by the HHS director of personnel policy. Thus, the government has not yet\n\nestablished its Exemption 4 claim.”); Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Air Force, 566 F.2d\n\nreleased to the public.” Def.’s Reply at 15 (alterations in original omitted). The level of resource expenditures may\nbe relevant to evaluating the proprietary nature of information, but it is not necessarily a measure of competitive\nharm for purposes of Exemption 4. Rather, it is the prospect of the affirmative use of the disclosed information by\ncompetitors that makes release of the information competitively harmful. See Pub. Citizen Health Research Grp.,\n704 F.2d at 1291. The defendant’s argument is a virtual non-sequitur in this case, because the primary argument\nraised by the plaintiff is not about the level of resource expenditures in the creation of the withheld records, but\nrather that release of these records would not constitute competitive harm because they could not be used\naffirmatively by the defendant-intervenors’ competitors. See Pl.’s Reply at 12. Furthermore, to the extent the\nplaintiff “ignore[d]” the resource expenditure defense to disclosure, as the defendant contends, Def.’s Reply at 15,\nthis does not amount to “concession” since the level of expenditures is irrelevant.\n\n                                                         44\n\f242, 258 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (“An agency cannot meet its statutory burden of justification by\n\nconclusory allegations of possible harm.”); Comptel, 910 F. Supp. 2d at 117 (“[C]onclusory\n\nassertions, without any additional description of the contents of the redacted information or\n\nreasons for non-disclosure, are insufficient to show that Exemption 4 was appropriately\n\ninvoked.”); Biles v. U.S. Dep’t of Health and Human Servs., No. 11-1997, 2013 WL 1154207, at\n\n*9 (“[C]onclusory claims of commercial harm . . . are therefore insufficient to establish HHS’\n\nburden of proof”). Even with deference given to agency declarations, “deference does not mean\n\nblind acceptance.” Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander & Ferdon v. U.S. Int’l Trade Comm’n, 846\n\nF.2d 1527, 1532 (D.C. Cir. 1988).\n\n       First, to support the contention that disclosure of the changes implemented by the\n\ndefendant-intervenors for screening and removing Ineligible Persons would cause substantial\n\ncompetitive harm, Pfizer’s declarant explains that “[t]his information reflects Pfizer’s internal\n\nbusiness processes and judgments made to develop and implement the Ineligible Person\n\nManagement process . . . .” Nowicki Decl. ¶ 29. Purdue’s declarant mentions only that “the\n\ndetermination, screening and training of relevant covered persons/vendors, as well as its\n\nproposed actions regarding ineligible persons, all directly relate to Purdue’s compliance with\n\nlegal and regulatory requirements, and are proprietary in nature.” Weinstein Decl. ¶ 15. These\n\nprocess changes reflect the companies’ views of effective ways in which to ferret out Ineligible\n\nPersons, in the context of the companies’ particular organizational structure and operations.\n\nAlthough the declarations provide only slim support, the Court finds that disclosure of these\n\nprocess changes may risk competitive harm by revealing confidential information about the\n\ncompanies’ broader structure and operations in which the changes to Ineligible Persons processes\n\nare implemented. See United Technologies, 601 F.3d at 564 (finding proprietary manufacturing\n\n\n\n                                                 45\n\fand quality control processes were subject to withholding under Exemption 4 since “[o]nce\n\ndisclosed, competitors could, it appears, use the information to improve their own manufacturing\n\nand quality control systems, thus making ‘affirmative use of proprietary information’ against\n\nwhich Exemption 4 is meant to guard.”). Consequently, the Court grants summary judgment to\n\nthe defendant and defendant-intervenors as to the withholding under Exemption 4 of documents\n\nreflecting “changes in process” pertaining to Ineligible Persons.\n\n       Second, regarding the likely competitive harm posed by disclosure of documents\n\ncontaining the description of the allegations subject to investigations or legal proceedings, the\n\ndefendant and defendant-intervenors have not provided a sufficient showing to sustain summary\n\njudgment. Pfizer’s declarant states only that “the summary information that Pfizer submits to\n\nOIG is highly sensitive, confidential information that Pfizer does not publicly release.” Nowicki\n\nDecl. ¶ 28. This conclusory statement says nothing about how the revelation of these\n\ndescriptions of allegations, now dating back to at least several years ago, would be used by\n\ncompetitors affirmatively to harm Pfizer. Purdue’s declarant does no better by stating “[p]ublic\n\ndisclosure of this information, which includes non-public legal and/or regulatory actions, such as\n\nwith a Reportable Event, would certainly have negative commercial consequences for Purdue.”\n\nWeinstein Decl. ¶ 26. This is a conclusory statement that, again, does nothing to show why or\n\nhow competitors will be able to use this information affirmatively cause to harm to Purdue. As\n\nnoted, Exemption Four does not shield embarrassing information or information that may cause\n\nreputational harm, but only information that can be affirmatively used by a competitor. See CNA\n\nFin. Corp. v. Donovan, 830 F.2d at 1154 & n.158; Pub. Citizen Health Research Grp., 704 F.2d\n\nat 1291 n.30. Therefore, the Court denies summary judgment to all parties regarding the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 46\n\fdescriptions of allegations contained in the summaries of legal and investigatory inquiries\n\nprovided by the defendant-intervenors in their Annual Reports.\n\n       Third, the defendant-intervenors’ communications with the FDA regarding off-label\n\nmarketing are at least partially non-confidential. Pfizer’s declarant makes this clear when he\n\nstates that “Pfizer’s communications with the FDA are usually confidential commercial\n\ninformation that Pfizer maintains under strict confidentiality.” Nowicki Decl. ¶ 30 (emphasis\n\nsupplied). This statement implicitly acknowledges that these communications are not always\n\nstrictly confidential, which is further confirmed by the declarant’s statement that some\n\ncommunications, such as Warning Letters from the FDA, are publicly available. Id. Purdue’s\n\ndeclarant says nothing to address this category of records. Neither the Vaughn indices nor the\n\ndeclarations provide sufficient specificity for the Court to determine which documents may\n\ncontain confidential commercial information and which do not. Therefore, summary judgment\n\nas to the company communications with the FDA will be denied to all parties.\n\n       Fourth, Pfizer’s off-label findings and detailing sessions are the murkiest of the withheld\n\nrecords requested by the plaintiff. Pfizer’s declarant does little to shed light on what the\n\ndetailing sessions are, how they are conducted, and from where the records are derived. He\n\nmerely states that the information “is highly confidential and includes detailed information\n\nregarding Pfizer’s internal review and monitoring of sales representative activities,” but neither\n\nPfizer nor the defendant has explained how Pfizer obtains the underlying documents on which\n\nthese analyses are based. See Nowicki Decl. ¶ 33. Nevertheless, since the off-label findings by\n\nPfizer reflect the company’s “findings” about its own sales force’ activities, the potential risk of\n\ncompetitive harm from disclosure of what those activities are is plain. Therefore, as to Pfizer’s\n\n\n\n\n                                                 47\n\foff-label findings, the Court grants summary judgment to the defendant and defendant-\n\nintervenors.\n\n        The documents reflecting “detailing sessions” are more difficult, particularly given the\n\nlack of information provided to the Court about the precise nature of these documents. The CIA\n\nrequires Pfizer to obtain “commercially available non-Pfizer records” to conduct its review.\n\nPfizer CIA at 22. If these detailing session documents are commercially available from third\n\nparties, it is unclear what the basis is at all for Pfizer’s assertion of confidentiality. In any event,\n\nthe level of specificity provided as to the nature of the detailing session documents is too\n\nminimal to demonstrate, as is the agency’s burden, that the release of this information would\n\ncause competitive harm. Therefore, summary judgment is denied to all parties as to the\n\ndocuments containing detailing sessions.\n\n        Fifth, the IRO Reports present “an extensive, probing review of Purdue’s confidential\n\nbusiness systems and policies, as well as selected samples of individual transactions,” Weinstein\n\n¶ 20, and “Pfizer’s internal structure and operations, how the company interacts with HCPs and\n\nthe medical community, and Pfizer’s policies governing the selling, detailing, marketing,\n\nadvertising, promoting and branding of Government Reimbursed Projects, meaning all Pfizer\n\nhuman pharmaceutical products promoted or sold by Pfizer in the United States that are\n\nreimbursable by Federal health care programs,” Nowicki Decl. ¶ 22. These details make clear\n\nthat competitive harm would result from their disclosure. For instance, Purdue’s declarant states\n\nthat the reports contain “selected samples of individual transactions . . . which may contain\n\nprivate patient information as well as . . . the identity of Healthcare Professionals who are\n\ncustomers.” Weinstein ¶ 20. It is thus obvious that the release of such information would be\n\nakin to releasing customer lists which could easily be used affirmatively by competitors to harm\n\n\n\n                                                   48\n\fPurdue. Similarly, a competitor could certainly use internal details of the sale and marketing of\n\nPfizer’s products against it a number of ways, such as setting prices, competing for ad space, or\n\nidentifying areas of strength or weakness. Therefore, the Court finds that information pertaining\n\nto the IRO Reports, responses, and corrective action taken in response to the IRO Reports were\n\nproperly withheld under Exemption 4, and summary judgment is granted to the defendant and\n\ndefendant-intervenors on this category of information.\n\n       Finally, Purdue’s declarant makes only a single conclusory statement about the potential\n\ncompetitive harm that could be caused by the release of the 2009 Purdue Supplement, stating that\n\nthe promotional monitoring program “is considered proprietary and highly confidential. Thus, it\n\nwould be detrimental to Purdue if these documents were publicly disclosed.” Weinstein Decl. ¶\n\n29. These nineteen words provide only slim support for a finding that competitive harm is likely\n\nto result from revelation of this promotional monitoring program. Nevertheless, the subject\n\nmatter plainly relates to core aspects of the company’s marketing and sales efforts and, thus, how\n\nPurdue conducts those activities in compliance with applicable regulations and laws. Similar to\n\nthe changes in business processes that the defendant-intervenors use to fulfill the Ineligible\n\nPersons requirement, disclosure of how Purdue has continued to perfect its promotional\n\nmonitoring program could be put to affirmative use by its competitors, thus making it\n\nconfidential under the terms of Exemption 4. Therefore, summary judgment is granted to the\n\ndefendant and defendant-intervenors on the withholding of Purdue’s promotional monitoring\n\nprogram information contained in the 2009 Purdue Supplement.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 49\n\f                                          *      *       *\n\n       In sum, of the six categories, or sub-parts of categories, found to contain commercial\n\nmatter, the Court concludes that there is sufficient support for finding that the following withheld\n\ndocuments are also confidential: (1) changes to the processes by which the companies fulfill the\n\nIneligible Persons requirement in § III.F of the Purdue and Pfizer CIAs; (2) Pfizer’s off-label\n\nfindings required to be included in the Annual Reports, pursuant to §§ III.J and V.B.17 of the\n\nPfizer CIA; (3) IRO reports required to be included in the Annual Reports, pursuant to §§ III.D\n\nand V.B.5-8 of the Purdue CIA and §§ III.D and V.B.6-9 of the Pfizer CIA; and (4) the portions\n\nof the 2009 Purdue Supplement addressing Purdue’s promotional monitoring program.\n\nTherefore, this information was properly withheld under Exemption 4, and summary judgment is\n\ngranted to the defendant and defendant-intervenors as to these documents. The declarations and\n\nVaughn indices submitted to support the withholding of the remaining commercial documents\n\nare insufficient for the Court to assess whether the documents warrant confidential treatment and\n\nqualify for withholding under Exemption 4. Thus, summary judgment is denied to all parties\n\nwith respect to the following documents containing commercial matter: (1) the description of the\n\nallegations subject to investigations or legal proceedings required to be included in the Annual\n\nReports, pursuant to § III.G of the Purdue and Pfizer CIAs; (2) company communications with\n\nthe FDA regarding off-label promotions required to be included in the Annual Reports, pursuant\n\nto § III.I of the Purdue and Pfizer CIAs; and (3) Pfizer’s detailing sessions required to be\n\nincluded in the Annual Reports, pursuant to §§ III.J and V.B.17 of the Pfizer CIA. As to these\n\ndocuments, the defendant and defendant-intervenors may submit supplemental declarations\n\nand/or Vaughn indices demonstrating that disclosure of the withheld documents would likely\n\ncause competitive harm or, alternatively, release the withheld documents.\n\n\n\n                                                 50\n\f       Finally, any supplemental support for continued withholding of any of the challenged\n\ndocuments must also address whether any reasonably segregable portions of withheld documents\n\nhave been released, keeping in mind that an “‘agency cannot justify withholding an entire\n\ndocument simply by showing that it contains some exempt material.’” Hodge v. FBI, 703 F.3d\n\n575, 582 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (quoting Stolt-Nielsen Transp. Grp., 534 F.3d at 734).\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n       The fundamental problem in this case is the lack of detail provided in the defendants’\n\ndeclarations and the Vaughn indices. Mere conclusory statements regarding the alleged\n\ncommercial nature and confidentiality of the records withheld is not sufficient to allow this Court\n\nto determine whether the withheld information is properly exempt under FOIA’s Exemption 4.\n\n       For the reasons explained above, the Motion for Summary Judgment of the defendant and\n\ndefendant-intervenors is denied in part and granted in part. This motion is DENIED, without\n\nprejudice, because the Court has insufficient information to determine if the disputed records are\n\n“commercial” within the meaning of Exemption 4 with respect to (1) the Reportable Events\n\nsummaries required by § V.B.9 of the Purdue CIA and § V.B.12 of the Pfizer CIA; (2) the\n\nDisclosure Log summaries required by § V.B.10 of the Purdue CIA and § V.B.14 of the Pfizer\n\nCIA; (3) the title and responsibility information of Ineligible Persons required by § V.B.11 of the\n\nPfizer CIA and § V.B.12 of the Purdue CIA; (4) information pertaining to the agency conducting\n\nan investigation and the status of that investigation required by § V.B.13 of the Purdue CIA and\n\n§ V.B.15 of the Pfizer CIA; and (5) reasonably segregable information in the 2009 Purdue\n\nSupplement that does not pertain to its promotional monitoring program. The defendant and\n\ndefendant-intervenors’ Motion is also DENIED, without prejudice, because the Court does not\n\nhave sufficient information to determine if the disputed records are confidential within the\n\n\n\n                                                51\n\fmeaning of Exemption 4 with respect to (6) the summaries of legal and investigatory inquiries\n\nrequired by § V.B.13 of the Purdue CIA and § V.B.15 of the Pfizer CIA; (7) company\n\ncommunications with the FDA as required by § V.B.14 of the Purdue CIA and § V.B.16 of the\n\nPfizer CIA; and (8) the “underlying records reflecting the content of detailing sessions between\n\nHCPs and Covered persons” as required in § V.B.17 of the Pfizer CIA.\n\n       The Motion for Summary Judgment of the defendant and defendant-intervenors is\n\nGRANTED with respect to the following records, which the Court finds were properly withheld\n\nunder Exemption 4 as commercial and confidential: (1) the records reflecting “changes in\n\nprocess” of the monitoring and removal of Ineligible Persons required by § V.B.11 of the Purdue\n\nCIA and § V.B.10 of the Pfizer CIA; (2) the Off-Label Findings and summary of responsive\n\naction taken by Pfizer required by § V.B.17 of the Pfizer CIA; (3) the IRO reports required by §§\n\nV.B.5–8 of the Purdue CIA and §§ V.B.6–9 of the Pfizer CIA; and (4) the portions of the 2009\n\nPurdue Supplement pertaining to its promotional monitoring program.\n\n       The plaintiff’s Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment is granted in part and denied in part.\n\nThe Cross-Motion is GRANTED as to the inadequacy of the defendant’s search for responsive\n\nrecords regarding the Pfizer Section V.B.6 documents; and as to the following records, which the\n\nCourt finds were not properly withheld under Exemption 4 and must be released to the plaintiff:\n\n(1) the titles and responsibilities of Ineligible Persons removed required by § V.B.12 of the\n\nPurdue CIA and § V.B.11 of the Pfizer CIA; and (2) the identity of the investigatory agency and\n\nstatus of any investigations required by § V.B.13 of the Purdue CIA and § V.B.15 of the Pfizer\n\nCIA. In all other respects, the plaintiff’s Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED,\n\nwithout prejudice.\n\n\n\n\n                                                52\n\f       For the remaining records at issue, the parties are directed to meet and confer and, by\n\nNovember 8, 2013, provide the Court with (1) a status report that sets forth a list of the records\n\nthat remain in dispute, in light of this Memorandum Opinion, and that identifies each such\n\ndisputed record by a Bates number, or other unique identifier, and by citation to the particular\n\npage(s) of the Vaughn index where the disputed record is described; and (2) a proposed briefing\n\nschedule for any further proceedings in this matter, including deadlines for the submission of any\n\nrenewed dispositive motions, supplementary Vaughn indices, and/or supplementary declarations.\n\n       An appropriate Order accompanies this decision.\n\n\n                                                                       Digitally signed by Beryl A.

Noting that Pfizer has entered into three serial\n\nCIAs with HHS’ OIG, due to the company engaging in allegedly illegal behavior at the same\n\ntime it was subject to a CIA, the plaintiff filed the FOIA requests at issue in the instant suit to\n\naddress “a serious question about the adequacy of OIG oversight of companies during the CIA\n\nprocess.” Id. ¶¶ 11, 14; see also Declaration of Edward Nowicki, Pfizer Vice-President and\n\nAsst. General Counsel, Deputy Compliance Officer – Global Programs, (“Nowicki Decl.”) ¶ 4,\n\nECF No. 22-1 (“The 2004 CIA expired in 2009. Since that time, Pfizer entered into a new CIA\n\nwith HHS in 2009.”). The plaintiff explains that “[t]o the extent that the annual reports [required\n\nby the CIA] reveal instances of illegal activity by the companies, the public has a strong interest\n\nin knowing that OIG had access to this information and in knowing whether OIG acted\n\nforcefully in responding to it.” Wolfe Decl. ¶ 14.\n\n       HHS has withheld the bulk of the requested records on grounds that they contain\n\nconfidential, commercial information exempt from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 4 and\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\fprivate, personal information exempt from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 6. 5 U.S.C. §\n\n552(b)(4) and (6). The plaintiff challenges HHS’ withholdings for eight categories of records, as\n\nwell as the adequacy of HHS’ search for records pertaining to one of the companies. Pending\n\nbefore the Court, are cross-motions for summary judgment by HHS and the defendant-\n\nintervenors Pfizer and Purdue, and by the plaintiff. For the reasons stated below, these motions\n\nare granted in part and denied in part.\n\nI.      BACKGROUND\n\n        A.       Annual Reports Required To Be Submitted Under Corporate Integrity\n                 Agreements With Pfizer And Purdue\n\n        In May 2004, Pfizer entered into a CIA with HHS’ OIG as part of a larger settlement\n\nagreement with the United States and various States “related to Pfizer’s promotional practices of\n\na Pfizer product.” Nowicki Decl. ¶ 4; see also Def.’s Mot. Summ. J., Ex. 1 (“Pfizer Corporate\n\nIntegrity Agreement”) (“Pfizer CIA”) at 1, ECF No. 22-1. This CIA superseded a prior CIA that\n\nPfizer had entered with HHS’ OIG in October 2002. Id. “Among other things, the CIA required\n\nPfizer to implement, update and/or review its policies and procedures relating to compliance with\n\nrelevant federal regulations,” and to submit to the OIG annually over the five-year period while\n\nthe CIA was in force an Annual Report that addressed at least twenty enumerated items.\n\nNowicki Decl. ¶ 4; Pfizer CIA at 24–27. Pfizer claims these annual reports “contain highly\n\nsensitive, confidential commercial information,” and, consequently, marked the documents\n\nsubmitted as “Confidential and FOIA Exempt.” Nowicki Decl. ¶ 14.

Purdue also claims these reports contain\n\n“highly confidential and proprietary information,” and, consequently, marked the Annual\n\nReports at issue as “Confidential and FOIA Exempt.” Id. ¶¶ 1, 9.\n\n       Both Pfizer and Purdue agreed to the terms set forth in their respective CIAs with the\n\nOIG “as part of the resolution of civil and administrative health care fraud cases.” Demske Decl.\n\n¶ 2. They both contain the standard provisions that “the OIG agrees not to seek an exclusion of\n\nthat entity from participation in Federal health care programs,” on condition that the company\n\nsubject to the CIA “adopts measures designed to promote compliance,” with Federal laws and\n\nregulations, including “hiring [] a compliance officer, establish[ing] a code of conduct and\n\npolicies and procedures, employee training, confidential disclosure mechanisms, and reporting of\n\nviolations of law.” Id. Also, both CIAs require review of the company’s compliance with these\n\nmeasures by an independent party, called an Independent Review Organization (“IRO”), which\n\nsubmits annually to the company a report “addressing the requirements of the CIA and including\n\nthe results of the audits and reviews.” Id. ¶ 3. The IRO Report is later submitted to the HHS as\n\npart of the company’s Annual Report, along with any responses to IRO Report’s findings from\n\nthe company. Id.; Purdue CIA at 28; Pfizer CIA at 25. The CIAs themselves are posted on the\n\nHHS website. Demske Decl. ¶ 3.\n\n       As part of the CIAs, the companies are given the opportunity to “clearly identify any\n\nportions of its submissions that it believes are trade secrets, or information that is commercial or\n\nfinancial and privileged or confidential, and therefore potentially exempt from disclosure under\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fthe Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. § 552.” Def.

At the same time, the CIAs direct that the\n\ncompany “shall refrain from identifying any information as exempt from disclosure if that\n\ninformation does not meet the criteria for exemption from disclosure under FOIA.” Id. HHS is\n\nnot obligated to accept the companies’ designation of any document as FOIA exempt. Indeed,\n\nbased on the materials released, HHS disagreed with the companies’ designations, at least in\n\npart, with respect to certain documents, which have been partially released to the plaintiff. See,\n\ne.g., Declaration of Julie A. Murray, Counsel for Public Citizen, (“Murray Decl.”) Ex 3 Attachs.\n\nA, D, E, F, G, H, ECF No. 26-3 (released documents bearing legend “Confidential and FOIA\n\nExempt.”). 3\n\n         B.       The Plaintiff’s FOIA Request\n\n         On November 12, 2009, the plaintiff submitted a FOIA request to HHS seeking “all\n\nannual reports submitted to the [OIG] by Purdue Pharma L.P. pursuant to the May 2007\n\nCorporate Integrity Agreement between OIG and Purdue Pharma L.P,” and “by Pfizer, Inc.\n\npursuant to the May 2004 Corporate Integrity Agreement between OIG and Pfizer.” Decl. of\n\nRobin R. Brooks, HHS OIG FOIA Officer, (“Brooks Decl.”) Ex. A at 1, ECF No. 22-1. 4 In\n\nresponse, HHS conducted a search of its CIA database and “the Compliance File room where\n\nactive compliance case files and Implementation and Annual Reports are maintained.” Brooks\n\n\n3\n  In connection with Pfizer’s submission of documents pursuant to an earlier CIA executed on October 24, 2002,\nHHS was prompted to caution the company that “[t]o date almost all of the documents submitted pursuant to the\nCIA have been stamped ‘FOIA exempt.’ As a result we would like to advise you that in the event that Pfizer’s CIA\nmaterials are requested under FOIA, such materials may not be fully exempt as you have noted . . . . Therefore, you\nshould not assume that all of Pfizer’s reports and other documents submitted pursuant to the CIA will be exempt\nfrom a FOIA request.” Murray Decl., Ex. 3 Attach. G (HHS letter, dated November 19, 2003, to Pfizer) at 1–2, ECF\nNo. 26-3.\n4\n  Public Citizen’s request for a fee waiver was granted, following an administrative appeal of HHS’s initial denial of\nthis request. See Brooks Decl. ¶¶ 4, 6, 8, 11.\n\n                                                          5\n\fDecl. ¶ 13. HHS’s FOIA liaison also “confirmed with the attorneys monitoring the CIA’s [sic]\n\nthat all responsive records had been accounted for.” Id.\n\n       Under Executive Order 12,600, HHS was required to “notify submitters of records\n\ncontaining confidential commercial information . . . when those records are requested under the\n\n[FOIA].” 52 Fed. Reg. 23,781 § 1 (June. 23, 1987). HHS regulations also require such a\n\n“predisclosure notification.” See 45 C.F.R. § 5.65(d); Brooks Decl. ¶ 24. Consequently, HHS\n\nnotified Pfizer and Purdue of the plaintiff’s request and consulted with them “regarding the\n\nrelease of their information.” Brooks Decl. ¶ 24.\n\n       On June 22, 2010, HHS notified the plaintiff that it had “located 1177 pages of records\n\nresponsive” to the Purdue portion of the FOIA request. Brooks Decl. Ex. J. Of those pages,\n\n1,093 were withheld in their entirety under FOIA Exemptions 4 and 6, see 5 U.S.C. §§ 552(b)(4),\n\n(b)(6), while 84 pages were partially released with portions redacted under the same exemptions.\n\nId. With respect to the Pfizer portion of the FOIA request, HHS notified the plaintiff, on\n\nSeptember 21, 2010, that 9,432 pages of responsive records had been located, with 5,216 pages\n\nwithheld in their entirety as well as portions of 4,216 pages, under FOIA Exemptions 4 and 6.\n\nBrooks Decl.

The plaintiff appealed these\n\nwithholding determinations under Exemptions 4 and 6 to HHS. See Brooks Decl. Exs.

Procedural History\n\n         The plaintiff filed the instant lawsuit on September 16, 2011, against HHS. See Compl. ¶\n\n1. The unopposed motions of Pfizer and Purdue to intervene were granted on November 18 and\n\nDecember 7, 2011, respectively. See Minute Orders dated November 18, 2011 and Dec. 7, 2011.\n\nHHS thereafter filed two Vaughn indices, one pertaining to Pfizer and one pertaining to Purdue,\n\non March 7, 2012. See Vaughn Index of Withheld Pfizer Inc. Documents (“Pfizer Vaughn\n\nIndex”), ECF No. 18; Vaughn Index of Withheld Purdue Pharma L.P. Documents (“Purdue\n\nVaughn Index”), ECF No. 19.\n\n         The plaintiff now challenges the adequacy of HHS’s search for “Pfizer IRO responses\n\nand corrective action plans,” which the plaintiff claims “were not clearly identified in the\n\nVaughn Index of withheld Pfizer documents.” Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. and Opp’n\n\nto Def.’s and Def.-Intervenor’s Mots. Summ. J. (“Pl.’s Mem.”) at 38, ECF No. 26. In addition,\n\nthe plaintiff challenges HHS’s withholdings under Exemptions 4 and 6 of the following eight\n\ncategories of records included in the Annual Reports: (1) “Reportable Events”; 5 (2) Disclosure\n\nLog summaries; 6 (3) screening and removal of Ineligible Persons; 7 (4) summaries of government\n\ninvestigations or legal proceedings; (5) communications with the Food and Drug Administration\n\n5\n  The CIAs define “Reportable Events” as “anything that involves a matter . . . that a reasonable person would\nconsider a probable violation of criminal, civil, or administrative laws applicable to any Federal health care program\nand/or any FDA requirements relating to the labeling or promotion of products for which penalties or exclusion may\nbe authorized.” Purdue CIA at 19–20; see Pfizer CIA at 21.\n6\n  Each company was required by its CIA to “maintain a disclosure log, which shall include a record and summary of\neach disclosure received (whether anonymous or not), the status of the respective internal reviews, and any\ncorrective action taken in response to the internal reviews.” Purdue CIA at 17; Pfizer CIA at 19. The referenced\ndisclosures were made in connection with “a disclosure program,” which “includes a mechanism . . . to enable\nindividuals to disclose, to the Compliance Officer or some other person who is not in the disclosing individual’s\nchain of command, any identified issues or questions associated with Pfizer’s policies, conduct, practices, or\nprocedures with respect to a Federal health care program requirements [sic] or FDA requirements believed by the\nindividual to be a potential violation of criminal, civil, or administrative law.” Pfizer CIA at 18; see also Purdue\nCIA at 16 (same).\n7\n  An “Ineligible Person” “is currently excluded, debarred, suspended, or otherwise ineligible to participate in Federal\nhealth care programs or in Federal procurement or nonprocurement programs; or has been convicted of a criminal\noffense that falls within the ambit of 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7(a), but has not yet been excluded, debarred, suspended, or\notherwise declared ineligible.” Pfizer CIA at 19; Purdue CIA at 17\n\n                                                          7\n\f(“FDA”) about off-label promotion; (6) portions of Pfizer’s off-label findings and detailing\n\nsessions; 8 (7) portions of IRO reports pertaining to, inter alia, the IRO’s findings and\n\nrecommendations, the companies’ compliance programs, “corrective action taken by the\n\ncompany,” and the “IRO’s description of the company’s systems, policies, procedures, and\n\npractices,” Pl.’s Mem. at 28–29; 9 and (8) Purdue’s supplement, dated June 18, 2009, to its first\n\nAnnual Report, which was submitted on September 25, 2008 (“2009 Purdue Supplement”). 10\n\nSee Pl.’s Mem. at 9–13 & n.3, ECF No. 27.\n\n        With the exception of the 2009 Purdue Supplement, the parties have not identified the\n\nspecific documents in the Vaughn indices that are covered by each of the broad challenged\n\ncategories and, thus, has left the Court to speculate as to which specific withheld documents are\n\nactually at issue in this lawsuit and which documents the parties agree were appropriately\n\nwithheld.

DISCUSSION\n\n         The plaintiff raises two issues regarding HHS’s response to its FOIA request: the\n\nadequacy of the defendant’s search and the appropriateness of the Exemption 4 withholdings. 11\n\nEach of these issues is addressed seriatim below.\n\n         A.       The Adequacy of HHS’s Search\n\n         The plaintiff contends that the defendant’s search for records responsive to the request for\n\nPfizer Annual Reports was inadequate because certain documents referenced in released\n\ndocuments were not identified in the Vaughn Index of withheld Pfizer documents or released to\n\nthe plaintiff. See Pl.’s Mem. at 38. Specifically, the plaintiff contends that Pfizer stated in each\n\nof its Annual Reports that the company’s response to the IRO’s findings and recommendations,\n\nand any other observations, would be provided to the OIG, as necessary, under separate cover, at\n\n\n11\n  All of the documents withheld by the defendant under Exemption 6, which exempts from disclosure “personnel or\nmedical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy,” 5\nU.S.C. § 552(b)(6), are also withheld under Exemption 4. In construing Exemption 6, the D.C. Circuit has held that\n“the disclosure of names and addresses is not inherently and always a significant threat to the privacy of those listed;\nwhether it is a significant or a de minimis threat depends upon the characteristic(s) revealed by virtue of being on the\nparticular list, and the consequences likely to ensue.” Nat’l Ass’n of Retired Fed. Employees v. Horner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526427\"><a href=\"/opinion/526427/national-association-of-retired-federal-employees-v-constance-horner/\"><span class=\"volume\">879</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">873</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 877 (D.C. Cir. 1989). “Exemption 6’s requirement that disclosure be ‘clearly unwarranted’ instructs us to ‘tilt\nthe balance (of disclosure interests against privacy interest) in favor of disclosure.’” Morley, 508 F.3d at 1127 (D.C.\nCir. 2007) (quoting Wash. Post Co. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health and Human Servs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"409411\"><a href=\"/opinion/409411/the-washington-post-company-v-united-states-department-of-health-and-human/\"><span class=\"volume\">690</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 261 (D.C. Cir. 1982)).\nHere, the defendant’s declarant states that the only information withheld under Exemption 6 consists of “employee\nnames and personal identifying information, such as telephone numbers and email addresses.” Brooks Decl. ¶ 27.\nThe plaintiff has clarified that it is not challenging the withholding of names, phone numbers, signatures, or email\naddresses of any individuals. Pl.’s Mem. at 36. Thus, given that the plaintiff is not contesting the application of\nExemption 6 to the information withheld on this basis, no Exemption 6 challenge is before the Court.\n\n                                                          12\n\fa later date. Murray Decl., Ex. 3 Attach. H (containing Pfizer’s statements regarding later\n\nsubmission of CIA Section III.D Responses in Annual Reports submitted for 2004-2009, at OIG-\n\n000066; OIG-001862; OIG-003715; OIG-005864; OIG-007893). These responses were\n\nspecifically required by Section V.B.6 of Pfizer’s CIA (“Section V.B.6 documents”). Pfizer CIA\n\nat 25. The plaintiff contends that the Section V.B.6 documents, which Pfizer was required to\n\nsubmit, and presumably did submit to the OIG, are “missing” and the defendant “does not appear\n\nto have acknowledged these missing documents or attempted a follow-up search to find them.”\n\nId. at 38. The defendant does not dispute that Pfizer submitted to the OIG its comments\n\nresponding to the IRO Reports, as required in Section V.B.6 of the CIA and referenced in each\n\nAnnual Report, or that such documents are responsive to the FOIA request. Rather, the\n\ndefendant disputes that Pfizer’s Section V.B.6 documents are missing and instead asserts that\n\nthey were identified in the search and withheld, as described in the Pfizer Vaughn index entries\n\n174, 175 and 176. See Def.’s Reply at 5.\n\n       In support of its position that “the very information that Plaintiff claims establishes that\n\nthe search was inadequate is accounted for in the Vaughn index,” the defendant highlights the\n\ninformation set forth in the Pfizer Vaughn index entries 174, 175 and 176. Id. These three\n\nentries, 174, 175 and 176, describe three letters, which were released with virtually all text\n\nredacted, from Pfizer’s counsel to the OIG, dated February 13, 2006, February 19, 2008 and\n\nNovember 11, 2009, respectively, as follows: “This letter and the accompanying attachments\n\ncontain confidential information related to communication with the OIG regarding Pfizer’s\n\nresponses to the OIG’s review of Pfizer’s Annual Report. These documents contain confidential\n\ninformation regarding IRO reviews and reports as well as Pfizer’s responses thereto and\n\nexcerpts from certain Pfizer policies and verbatim.” Id. (emphasis in original).\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\f       The defendant’s response that the plaintiff’s challenge to the adequacy of the search for\n\nPfizer documents “fails as a factual matter,” Def.’s Reply at 5, has two fundamental problems.\n\nFirst, the documents described in the Pfizer Vaughn Index entries 174, 175 and 176 relate only to\n\nthe first, third, and possibly the final 2009 Annual Reports. See Supplemental Decl. of Julie\n\nMurray, Counsel to Public Citizen, (“Murray Suppl. Decl.”) Ex. 1, Attachs. D, E, F, ECF No. 34-\n\n1 (Feb. 13, 2006 letter states submission is “regarding Pfizer’s first Annual Report;” Feb. 19,\n\n2008 letter states “Re: Follow-up to the Third Annual Report;” and the last letter is dated Dec.\n\n11, 2009 letter, which is after submission of fifth Annual Report). Thus, the Section V.B.6\n\ndocuments released in part and described in the Pfizer Vaughn index are only for three Annual\n\nReports (first, third and last), even though the company indicated in its Annual Reports for all\n\nfive years that it was filing Section V.B.6 documents. Nowicki Decl. ¶ 12. Thus, it appears that\n\nPfizer’s Section V.B.6 documents for at least two years were neither released to the plaintiff nor\n\nreferenced in the Vaughn index and, thus, are correctly deemed “missing” by the plaintiff. Pl.’s\n\nMem. at 38.\n\n       Second, the plaintiff challenges whether the documents described at Pfizer Vaughn Index\n\nentries 174, 175 and 176, which the defendant points to as evidence of the adequacy of its search,\n\nare actually the Section V.B.6 documents. See Pl’s Reply in Supp. Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. (“Pl.’s\n\nReply”) at 20–21, ECF No. 34. The plaintiff’s declarant submitted copies of the heavily redacted\n\nversions of the documents corresponding to Vaughn index numbers 174, 175 and 176. See\n\nMurray Suppl. Decl., Ex. 1 Attachs. D, E, and F (Bates Nos. OIG-009386, OIG-009420, OIG-\n\n009428). The opening paragraphs of each letter indicate that Pfizer is responding to specific\n\nOIG requests for additional information, but nowhere indicate that this information is provided to\n\ncomply with the CIA’s Section V.B.6. The plaintiff claims that these documents “provide only\n\n\n\n                                                14\n\f‘supplemental information that [OIG] requested’ in response to Pfizer’s annual reports,” Pl.’s\n\nReply at 20, rather than submitting Pfizer’s own independent “review [of] the Internal Review\n\nOrganizations findings and recommendations, and any other observations . . . pursuant to Section\n\nIII.D” of the CIA. See, e.g., Murray Decl. Ex. 3 Attach. H, Bates No. OIG-003715; Murray\n\nSuppl. Decl. Ex. 1 Attach. F, Bates No. OIG-009428. Thus, as a factual matter, the plaintiff has\n\nraised a significant question as to whether the letters listed in the Vaughn index entries 174, 175\n\nand 176 actually correspond to the information referenced in the CIA’s Section V.B.6.\n\n          The defendant nowhere adequately explains these factual discrepancies. Rather, the\n\ndefendant’s fallback position is that the law does not require the agency to do any more\n\nsearching since the agency has demonstrated in affidavits that it “conducted a reasonable\n\nsearch,” and no bad faith has been alleged. Def.’s Reply at 4. While “the adequacy of a FOIA\n\nsearch is generally determined not by the fruits of the search, but by the appropriateness of the\n\nmethods used to carry out the search,” see Iturralde v. Comptroller of Currency, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780370\"><a href=\"/opinion/780370/guillermo-felipe-duenas-iturralde-v-comptroller-of-the-currency/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">311</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n315 (D.C. Cir. 2003), “if a review of the record raises substantial doubt, particularly in view of\n\n‘well defined requests and positive indications of overlooked materials, summary judgment is\n\ninappropriate,” Valencia-Lucena v.

Cir.\n\n1979)).\n\n          In this case, the defendant concedes the existence of Pfizer Section V.B.6 documents\n\nrequired to be submitted to the OIG on an annual basis under the CIA, by pointing to the three\n\nheavily redacted letters described in the Pfizer Vaughn Index entries 174, 175 and 176.\n\nMoreover, the existence of these documents is confirmed by the released portions of five annual\n\nreports referencing the “later” submission of the Section V.B.6 documents. See Murray Decl. Ex.\n\n\n\n                                                 15\n\f3 Attach. H (Bates Nos. OIG-000066, OIG-001862, OIG-003715, OIG-005864 and OIG-\n\n007893). Therefore, at a minimum, Pfizer’s Section V.B.6 documents for two annual reports,\n\nwhich the defendant does not dispute should exist and should have been accounted for, are not\n\nrepresented in the Vaughn index, nor has the defendant provided any explanation as to what steps\n\nit undertook to track down these missing documents.\n\n       That the defendant was under an obligation to do so is made clear in Campbell v. United\n\nStates Department of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184712\"><a href=\"/opinion/184712/campbell-james-v-doj/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 28 (D.C. Cir. 1998). In Campbell, the D.C. Circuit\n\nheld that an agency must “revise its assessment of what is [a] ‘reasonable’ [search] in a particular\n\ncase to account for leads that emerge during its inquiry.” Id. at 28. In other words, when leads\n\nto other documents arise during the course of a search for responsive records, the agency must\n\nexpand the scope of its search. Id. This does not mean that “mere reference to other files” that\n\nare relevant to a FOIA request triggers an obligation for the agency to expand a search since “[i]f\n\nthat were the case, an agency responding to FOIA requests might be forced to examine virtually\n\nevery document in its files, following an interminable trail of cross-referenced documents like a\n\nchain letter winding its way through the mail.” Steinberg v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"669641\"><a href=\"/opinion/669641/michele-steinberg-v-united-states-department-of-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n552 (D.C. Cir. 1994); see also Morley, 508 F.3d at 1121. Yet, when, as here, the agency\n\nconcedes that responsive documents exist and, further, that its search should have recovered\n\nthose documents, by stating as a factual matter that they were, in fact, located, summary\n\njudgment is inappropriate when the plaintiff raises substantial factual questions about those\n\nassertions. Indeed, the D.C. Circuit has instructed that “a court may place significant weight on\n\nthe fact that a records search failed to turn up a particular document in analyzing the adequacy of\n\na records search.” Iturralde, 315 F.3d at 315 (citing Krikorian v. U.S. Dep’t of State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599116\"><a href=\"/opinion/599116/van-z-krikorian-v-department-of-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 468 (D.C. Cir. 1993)). As the D.C. Circuit explained in Valencia-Lucena, “what causes us\n\n\n\n                                                16\n\fto conclude that the search was inadequate arises from the fact that the record itself reveals\n\npositive indications of overlooked materials.” 180 F.3d at 326 (internal quotations omitted).\n\n         Here, there can be no doubt that, in the course of a search for responsive records, the\n\ndefendant was or became aware that Pfizer’s Section V.B.6 documents for five annual reports,\n\nnot just three such reports, should exist. Yet, the defendant offers no explanation, and cites to no\n\nproduced document, to account for the missing records for at least two annual reports. Although\n\nthe defendant is correct that “a search is not unreasonable simply because it fails to produce all\n\nrelevant material,” Meeropol v. Meese, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"469998\"><a href=\"/opinion/469998/michael-meeropol-aka-rosenberg-v-edwin-meese-iii-attorney-general-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">790</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">942</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 952-53 (D.C. Cir. 1986), the defendant\n\nwas affirmatively obligated to make an effort to find the two missing year’s responses when the\n\n“leads” to those documents are obvious. See Campbell, 164 F.3d at 28.\n\n         Moreover, neither the redacted records produced nor the Pfizer Vaughn Index sufficiently\n\nindicates that entries 174, 175 and 176 are actually the Section V.B.6 documents that Pfizer was\n\nrequired to produce under Section III.D and Section V.B.6 of the CIA, as all three letters appear\n\nto be responding to direct questions from the OIG, rather than Pfizer’s own findings and\n\nrecommendations in response to an IRO Report. Therefore, the defendant has not sustained its\n\nburden of showing the adequacy of its search and may either supplement its declarations to\n\naddress the factual questions raised by the plaintiff about the Pfizer Section V.B.6 documents or\n\nperform an additional search to locate the missing records. 12\n\n\n\n\n12\n  The defendant also argues that because no challenge to the adequacy of the search was raised during the\nadministrative appeal, the plaintiff has failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. See Def.’s Reply at 5 n.1. As\nthe plaintiff rightfully points out, however, the inadequacy of the defendant’s search was not apparent until after the\nagency filed its Vaughn indices, which show that Pfizer Section V.B.6 documents for at least two, if not all five,\nannual reports are missing. The Court, therefore, rejects this defense to the plaintiff’s challenge to the adequacy of\nthe search.\n\n                                                          17\n\f         B.       Exemption 4 Withholdings\n\n         Under the FOIA, “trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a\n\nperson” that is “privileged or confidential” may be withheld from disclosure. 5 U.S.C. §\n\n552(b)(4). 13 If the documents are not trade secrets, to sustain the burden of showing that\n\nExemption 4 was properly applied, an agency must establish that the withheld records are “(1)\n\ncommercial or financial, (2) obtained from a person, and (3) privileged or confidential.” Pub.\n\nCitizen Health Research Grp. v. FDA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"416834\"><a href=\"/opinion/416834/public-citizen-health-research-group-v-food-and-drug-administration/\"><span class=\"volume\">704</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1280</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1290 (D.C. Cir. 1983). No party to this\n\naction disputes the second prong of this test, nor could they, as the statute makes clear that a\n\n“person includes an individual, partnership, corporation, association, or public or private\n\norganization other than an agency.” 5 U.S.C. § 551(2) (emphasis added). Nor do the defendant\n\nand defendant-intervenors claim that the withheld documents are “financial.” See Def. Mem.\n\ngenerally; Declaration of Peter J. Claude, Partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP (“Claude\n\nDecl.”), ECF No. 22-2; Mem. Supp. Def.-Intervenor Pfizer’s Mot. Summ. J. (“Pfizer Mem.”),\n\nECF No. 23-1, generally.\n\n         The parties contest only whether, under the first and third prongs of the test, the eight\n\ncategories of challenged, withheld documents are “commercial” materials and, if so, whether\n\nthey are “privileged or confidential.” To resolve this dispute, the Court will first examine the\n\nscope of the term “commercial” in the FOIA context and address the plaintiff’s contention that\n\nany document referring to illegal or potentially illegal activity falls outside the meaning of this\n\n\n13\n   Although neither of the companies whose documents are at issue have claimed trade secret protection, the\ndefendant HHS has asserted, with only limited evidentiary support and no further discussion, that “the materials\nwithheld under Exemption 4 also constitute trade secrets.” Def. Mem., 8 n.1, ECF No. 22; see also Declaration of\nPeter J. Claude, Partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“Claude Decl.”) ¶ 13, ECF No. 22-2 (“In addition to being\ncommercially valuable, some of these procedures should be considered to contain trade secrets, as I understand that\nterm is defined by the OIG. These procedures are the product of innovation and are developed through substantial\neffort.”). These conclusory statements, without any effort to show that the documents satisfy the requisite elements\nfor trade secret protection, are wholly insufficient to support such a finding. Thus, as do the parties, the Court will\nfocus on whether the withheld records are “commercial” information.”\n\n                                                          18\n\fterm. Next, the Court will review each category of documents at issue and assess whether the\n\ndefendant and defendant-intervenors have met their burden of showing that challenged, withheld\n\nrecords contain commercial information. Finally, for any category of documents found to\n\ncontain commercial information, the Court will evaluate whether the information is confidential\n\nor privileged.\n\n                  1.       Scope of “Commercial” Information.\n\n         The term “commercial” is not defined in the FOIA. 14 Absent a precise statutory\n\ndefinition or clarity from the legislative history, the D.C.

Citizen Health Research Grp., 704 F.2d at 1290.\n\n       The plaintiff argues that many of the challenged withheld documents fail to qualify as\n\n“commercial” information because “[i]nformation about a company’s violation of laws and\n\nregulations is not commercial in nature.” Pl.’s Mem. at 17. In support, the plaintiff seizes upon\n\nlanguage in Critical Mass Energy Project v. Nuclear Regulatory Comm’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"591123\"><a href=\"/opinion/591123/critical-mass-energy-project-v-nuclear-regulatory-commission/\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">871</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C.\n\nCir. 1992) (en banc) (“Critical Mass”), generally describing the exemptions in the FOIA as\n\ndesigned to protect “legitimate governmental and private interests.” Id. at 872. Thus, according\n\nto the plaintiff’s argument, the FOIA necessarily excludes from the coverage of Exemption 4\n\n“information about suspected or confirmed illegal conduct by the companies or their employees\n\nand the companies’ corrective action . . . to comply with applicable laws,” Pl.’s Mem. at 17,\n\nbecause protecting against the disclosure of potential illegal conduct is a non-legitimate goal.\n\n       The defendant counters that commercial information does not lose the protection of\n\nExemption 4 “even when that information was directly related to the potential wrongdoing.”\n\nDef.’s Reply at 8. The Court agrees with the defendant for three reasons. First, the language\n\nfrom Critical Mass relied upon by the plaintiff is too thin a reed to support the weight of its\n\nargument. The D.C. Circuit’s use of the qualifying word “legitimate,” referred to the interests\n\nserved by the entire FOIA, not just Exemption 4. See Critical Mass, 975 F.2d at 872. This\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\fjudicial qualifier does not apply as an over-arching limit on the scope of any particular term used\n\nin the FOIA and, thus, cannot be read to limit the types of “commercial” activities subject to\n\nExemption 4.\n\n         Second, the plaintiff’s proposed construction of Exemption 4 would impose on this\n\nstatutory provision a limitation which is simply not supported by the plain text. On the contrary,\n\nthe term “commercial” is generally defined to mean “engaged in commerce” or “having\n\nreference to, or bearing on commerce.” Commercial, NEW OXFORD AM.

United States Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"216306\"><a href=\"/opinion/216306/watkins-v-us-bureau-of-customs-and-border/\"><span class=\"volume\">643</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1189</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2011), the Ninth Circuit rejected a FOIA requester’s contention that\n\n“Notices of Seizures” for allegedly counterfeit goods were not “commercial” because they\n\npertained to “the unlawful importation of counterfeit goods, and not any sort of legitimate\n\ncommercial activity.” Id. at 1195. Noting that such Notices are not “final determinations that\n\ngoods seized are counterfeit,” but are more “akin to a finding of probable cause,” the court\n\nexplained that “we cannot conclude that information contained in a Notice of Seizure is non-\n\ncommercial just because it’s likely — perhaps even very likely — that the merchandise seized is\n\ncounterfeit.” Id. Since the Notices disclose “intimate aspects of an importers business such as\n\nsupply chains and fluctuations of demand for merchandise,” the court further found that they\n\n“contain plainly commercial information.” Id.\n\n        Finally, the third reason to reject the plaintiff’s argument to exclude from the scope of\n\n“commercial” any “suspected or confirmed unlawful conduct,” Pl.’s Mem. at 1, is that it is based\n\non an error of reasoning by fallaciously imputing the properties of a “part” to the properties of\n\nthe “whole.” Specifically, the overall commercial nature of an undertaking is not altered when\n\n\n\n                                                 24\n\fsome aspect of that activity is suspected to constitute, or actually results in, a violation of a rule,\n\nregulation or statutory requirement. This is particularly true in the context of a heavily regulated\n\nindustry, such as pharmaceuticals. The Ninth Circuit in Watkins implicitly recognized the\n\nfundamental unfairness that would result if the protection of Exemption 4 were unavailable to\n\nwithhold otherwise confidential commercial documents of a company simply because the\n\ncompany was accused of wrongdoing, noting that, in some cases, “importers sometimes\n\nacquiesce in the Agency’s seizure and forfeiture of legitimate goods,” even without proof of\n\nlegal violation. 643 F.3d at 1195 (emphasis in original).\n\n        Although the Court finds unpersuasive the plaintiff’s argument that any information\n\nrelated to potential wrongdoing categorically falls outside Exemption 4, this does not mean that\n\nall of the withheld information submitted pursuant to the CIAs is automatically commercial. The\n\ndefendant must provide sufficient justification about each category of challenged documents to\n\nshow that the withheld documents are, indeed, “commercial” within the meaning of Exemption\n\n4. As discussed in more detail below, the Vaughn indices and declarations fall short in many\n\ninstances of the level of specificity the FOIA requires.\n\n                2.      Sufficiency of Showing That Withheld Documents Are “Commercial”\n\n        Set against the broad scope of the term “commercial,” the Court next examines each\n\nchallenged category of withheld documents to determine whether they meet this prerequisite for\n\napplication of Exemption 4. In this regard, the Court is mindful that the defendants bear the\n\nburden of establishing the applicability of this exemption and that “conclusory and generalized\n\nallegations of exemptions are unacceptable.” Morley, 508 F.3d at 1115 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). With respect to each category of withheld documents, the defendant makes only the\n\nconclusory statement that “[t]he records contain Pfizer and Purdue’s commercial or financial\n\ninformation.” Brooks Decl. ¶ 25. The Vaughn indices offer no additional details on this critical\n                                                   25\n\fquestion. See Pfizer Vaughn Index, Purdue Vaughn Index, generally. Consequently, as set forth\n\nbelow, the Court relies primarily upon the declarations of the defendant-intervenors to tease out\n\nany information regarding whether the withheld documents are “commercial” for the purposes of\n\nExemption 4.\n\n                       a. Reportable Event Summaries\n\n       Under the terms of the CIAs, Reportable Events are those events where “a reasonable\n\nperson would consider a probable violation of criminal, civil, or administrative laws applicable\n\nto any Federal health care program and/or any FDA requirements relating to the labeling or\n\npromotion of products for which penalties or exclusion may be authorized.” Purdue CIA at 19–\n\n20; see also Pfizer CIA at 21. Each company was required to notify the OIG within 30 days of\n\n“determining that the Reportable Event exists.” Purdue CIA at 20; Pfizer CIA at 21. In those\n\nreports, the companies were required to provide “a complete description of the Reportable Event,\n\nincluding relevant facts, persons involved, and legal and Federal health care program authorities\n\nimplicated,” “a description of [the company’s] actions taken to correct the Reportable Event,”\n\nand “any further steps [the company] plans to take to address the Reportable Event and prevent it\n\nfrom recurring.” Pfizer CIA at 21–22; see also Purdue CIA at 20.\n\n       Similarly to HHS, Purdue’s declarant does not discuss whether the Reportable Event\n\nsummaries are commercial at all but merely skips over this critical factor to focus on the “highly\n\nconfidential and privileged” nature of this information. See Weinstein Decl. ¶ 25 (“Because a\n\nReportable Event is the subject of highly confidential and privileged internal investigations\n\nundertaken at Purdue to determine the underlying facts and potential violations, public disclosure\n\nof the event would cause Purdue commercial injury.”); Brooks Decl. generally. Pfizer’s\n\ndeclarant states that “[t]he Reportable Event summary logs contain highly sensitive commercial\n\ninformation about the Reportable Event itself as well as Pfizer’s internal investigation of the\n                                                26\n\fReportable Event and any corrective actions taken.” Nowicki Decl. ¶ 26. More specifically,\n\n“[t]he Reportable Event summaries often contain sales and marketing tactics, analysis of\n\ncompliance with the CIA and any corrective actions taken.” Id. ¶ 27 (emphasis added). The\n\nimport of this statement is that Pfizer’s summaries do not always contain information regarding\n\n“sales and marketing.”\n\n       The Court could speculate that Reportable Event summaries could reveal information\n\nabout the companies’ activities in a specific place, at a specific time, and involving specific\n\nactivity with respect to a particular product and customer, all of which could in context be\n\nconsidered “commercial” information. Such speculation is not the Court’s job, however. See\n\nCoastal States Gas Corp. v. U.S. Dep’t of Energy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"375896\"><a href=\"/opinion/375896/coastal-states-gas-corporation-v-department-of-energy/\"><span class=\"volume\">617</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">854</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 870 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (“The\n\ncourts will not speculate as to whether [the] Exemption [] might, under some possible\n\ncongruence of circumstances not proven or even asserted be properly applied to these\n\ndocuments, nor will we assume that all the necessary conditions are met merely because the\n\nagency invokes an exemption.”); Founding Church of Scientology, 603 F.2d at 949 (“The\n\nreviewing court should not be required to speculate on the precise relationship between each\n\nexemption claim and the contents of the specific document.”).\n\n       Without more information about the commercial nature of the information contained in\n\nthe Reportable Event summaries, the Court has insufficient information to evaluate whether the\n\nsummaries contain commercial information and are being properly withheld. Consequently, the\n\nCourt denies summary judgment to the plaintiff and the defendants regarding the challenged\n\ncategory of withheld documents containing Reportable Event summaries.\n\n                       b. Disclosure Log Summaries\n\n       The companies were required by their CIAs to “maintain a disclosure log, which shall\n\ninclude a record and summary of each disclosure received” by the company’s compliance officer\n                                                 27\n\fregarding the potential violation of “criminal, civil, or administrative law.” See Purdue CIA at\n\n16–17; Pfizer CIA at 18–19. As described by Pfizer’s declarant, “[t]he Disclosure Logs contain\n\ninformation regarding reports (some of which are made anonymously) by individuals to Pfizer’s\n\nCompliance Officer (or his designee) regarding potential violations of criminal, civil or\n\nadministrative laws as required by the CIA. The Disclosure Logs contain summaries of reports\n\nmade, status of the internal review of the issue(s) raised in the reports, and any corrective actions\n\ntaken in response.” Nowicki Decl. ¶ 32.\n\n        The declarants for the defendants focus on the highly confidential nature of the disclosure\n\nlog summaries, but do not address the key issue of whether this category of withheld documents\n\ncontains commercial information. Id. (“This information is highly confidential”); Weinstein\n\nDecl. ¶ 22 (“The Disclosure Log is maintained in a proprietary and highly confidential\n\ndatabase.”). Again, the Court will not speculate. See Coastal States Gas Corp., 617 F.2d at 870;\n\nFounding Church of Scientology, 603 F.2d at 949. Without more information about the\n\ncommercial nature of the information contained in the disclosure log summaries, the Court has\n\ninsufficient information to evaluate whether these documents are being properly withheld.\n\nConsequently, the Court denies summary judgment to the plaintiff and the defendants regarding\n\nthe challenged category of withheld documents containing the disclosure log summaries.\n\n                          c. Ineligible Persons Information\n\n        Each company is required by their CIA to “ensure that all current Covered Persons 16 are\n\nnot Ineligible Persons,” meaning that they are not “currently excluded, debarred, suspended, or\n\notherwise ineligible to participate in the Federal health care programs or in Federal procurement\n\nor nonprocurement programs” or have “been convicted of a criminal offense that falls within the\n\n16\n  A “Covered Person” is defined in Purdue’s CIA to “include[]: all owners, officers, directors and employees [of the\ncompany]” and all contractors, not including part time employees or people not involved in the business operations\nof the company. See Purdue CIA at 2–3. The definition in Pfizer’s CIA is similar. See Pfizer CIA at 2–3.\n\n                                                        28\n\fambit of 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7(a), but ha[ve] not yet been excluded, debarred, suspended, or\n\notherwise declared ineligible.” Pfizer CIA at 19–20; Purdue CIA at 17–18. The companies are\n\nrequired to include in their Annual Reports two key items of information relating to enforcement\n\nof the CIAs provisions regarding Ineligible persons: (1) “any changes to the process by which\n\n[the company] fulfills” the Ineligible Persons requirement, and (2) “the name, title, and\n\nresponsibilities of any person who is determined to be an Ineligible Person.” Purdue CIA at 28;\n\nPfizer CIA at 25.\n\n       Purdue’s declarant does not address this category of withheld documents except to say\n\nPurdue’s “proposed actions regarding ineligible persons[] all directly relate to Purdue’s\n\ncompliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and are proprietary in nature.” Weinstein\n\nDecl. ¶ 15. Pfizer’s declarant offers a similarly general statement that “[t]his information reflects\n\nPfizer’s internal business processes and judgments made to develop and implement the Ineligible\n\nPerson Management process as well as confidential information related to Pfizer’s screening and\n\nremoval of Ineligible Persons.” Nowicki Decl. ¶ 29.\n\n       With respect to the first item of information, which requires the defendant-intervenors to\n\nnotify the OIG of “any changes to the process by which [the company] fulfills the requirements\n\nof [the CIA] regarding Ineligible Persons,” Pfizer CIA at 25, Purdue CIA at 28, such\n\nmodifications to internal processes are sufficiently commercial to qualify for Exemption 4\n\nbecause they involve the process by which the companies make decisions about managing and\n\nconducting their business operations. Such information is “instrumental” to conducting business\n\nbecause such individuals must be vetted and, when necessary, removed from the defendant-\n\nintervenors’ employ to allow the company to continue a significant part of its business with\n\nfederal health care programs. Pfizer CIA at 20; Purdue CIA at 18–19. Consequently,\n\n\n\n                                                 29\n\finformation concerning changes to processes regarding the screening or removal of Ineligible\n\nPersons amounts to “commercial” information under Exemption 4. 17\n\n         By contrast, the second item of information relating to Ineligible Persons consists only of\n\nthe “name, title, and responsibilities of any person who is determined to be an Ineligible Person.”\n\nPfizer CIA at 25 (Section V.B.11), Purdue CIA at 28 (Section V.B.12). This information is static\n\nand does not appear to have anything to do with the ongoing creation or selling of products, nor\n\ndoes this information appear to be “instrumental” to conducting commerce. Indeed, no\n\ndefendant declarant has provided any information revealing how such information could be\n\n“commercial.” Accord Getman, 450 F.2d at 673 (holding that list of names and addresses of\n\nemployees are not ‘commercial’ information”); Comptel v. F.C.C., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">910</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 116\n\n(D.D.C. 2012) (“The FCC has not met its burden to show that names and contact information\n\nshould be exempt as confidential commercial or financial information. . . . While the Court\n\nassumes corporations can have a commercial interest in the names of certain staff, it is not a\n\ncertainty that a corporation would have a commercial interest in the names of every one of its\n\nemployees.”). Consequently, the Court grants summary judgment to the plaintiff and orders the\n\nrelease of any documents withheld under Exemption 4 because they contain the “title and\n\nresponsibilities of any person who is determined to be an Ineligible Person.” 18 See Pfizer CIA\n\n(Section V.B.11); Purdue CIA (Section V.B.12).\n\n                           d. Investigations Or Legal Proceedings\n\n         The CIAs require the companies to, “[w]ithin 30 days after discovery . . . notify OIG, in\n\nwriting, of any ongoing investigation or legal proceeding . . . conducted or brought by a\n\n17\n   The Court must still determine, as discussed in Section III.B.3.b, infra, whether these withheld documents are\n“privileged or confidential” for application of Exemption 4.\n18\n   The plaintiff has made clear that it is not seeking “names, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, or signatures of\nindividuals named in withheld documents.” Pl.’s Mem. at 2. Any such personally identifiable information may be\nredacted from released documents.\n\n                                                         30\n\fgovernmental entity or its agents involving an allegation that [the company] has committed a\n\ncrime or has engaged in fraudulent activities.” Purdue CIA at 19 (Section III.G); see also Pfizer\n\nCIA at 21 (Section III.G). The “notification shall include a description of the allegation, the\n\nidentity of the investigating or prosecuting agency, and the status of such investigation or legal\n\nproceeding.” Purdue CIA at 19 (Section III.G); see also Pfizer CIA at 21 (Section III.G).\n\nAdditionally, the companies are to “provide written notice to OIG within 30 days after the\n\nresolution of the matter, and shall provide OIG with a description of the findings and/or results\n\nof the investigation or proceedings, if any.” Purdue CIA at 19; see also Pfizer CIA at 21.\n\n       The reporting requirement for investigatory or legal proceedings consists of three parts:\n\n(1) the description of the allegation; (2) the identity of the agency conducting the investigation;\n\nand (3) the status of the investigation or proceeding. The defendants’ declarants do not expressly\n\naddress the commercial nature of any part of this category of withheld documents. Instead,\n\nPurdue’s declarant stresses that “[p]ublic disclosure of this information, which includes non-\n\npublic legal and/or regulatory actions, such as with a Reportable Event, would certainly have\n\nnegative commercial consequences for Purdue.” Weinstein Decl. ¶ 26. Similarly, Pfizer’s\n\ndeclarant states that “release of such information would cause Pfizer competitive harm and could\n\nbe useful to Pfizer’s adversaries in current litigation.” Nowicki ¶ 28.\n\n       The legal proceedings described in this category of withheld document pertain to\n\nallegations of the company’s criminal or fraudulent conduct. Although the defendants do not\n\nexpressly say so, common sense dictates that such allegations about the company itself relate to\n\nthe conduct of employees and/or policies and practices of management in the operation of the\n\ncompanies’ business and thereby implicate the companies’ “commercial interests.” While the\n\nsupport for this conclusion in the declarations from the defendant and defendant-intervenors is\n\n\n\n                                                 31\n\fthin, the definition of the reporting requirement in the CIAs provides sufficient context for the\n\nCourt to reach this conclusion. Therefore, the first part of the reporting requirement regarding a\n\ndescription of the allegation is “commercial” under Exemption 4.\n\n       The other two parts of this reporting requirement, however—the identity of the agency\n\nconducting the investigation and the status of the investigation—do not appear to be\n\n“commercial,” and nothing in the declarations is provided to assist the Court is reaching any\n\nother conclusion. The identify of an outside agency conducting an investigation and that\n\ninvestigation’s status (e.g., closed, ongoing, active, stayed, dormant, etc.) would not, standing\n\nalone, reveal any information about the business operations or other commercial activities of the\n\ndefendant-intervenors. While the defendant-intervenors’ declarants indicate that release of the\n\nbroad category of information would cause competitive harm or be of some use to “adversaries\n\nin current litigation,” Nowicki Decl. ¶ 28, the basis for these assertions is unexplained. While\n\nthe Court appreciates that revealing the existence of an investigation, even if the status is closed,\n\nmay be embarrassing or harmful to the reputation of a company, the law is well-settled that this\n\npotential consequence of a disclosure does not convert the information into “commercial” under\n\nExemption 4. The D.C. Circuit made this point clearly in United Technologies. There, defense\n\ncontractors sought to use Exemption 4 to shield the release of information on the ground that\n\nthey would suffer competitive harm because “their competitors will use the documents to\n\ndiscredit them in the eyes of current and potential customers” and their “reputation will suffer as\n\na result.” United Technologies, 601 F.3d at 563. The court bluntly rejected this argument, stating\n\n“Exemption 4 does not protect against this species of harm,” and further explaining that\n\n“[c]alling customers’ attention to unfavorable agency evaluations or unfavorable press does not\n\namount to an ‘affirmative use of proprietary information by competitors.’” Id. at 563–64. In\n\n\n\n                                                 32\n\fshort, “Exemption 4 does not guard against mere embarrassment in the marketplace or\n\nreputational injury.” Id. at 564; see also Occidental Petroleum Corp. v. SEC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522131\"><a href=\"/opinion/522131/occidental-petroleum-corporation-v-securities-and-exchange-commission/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 341\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1989) (holding that a submitter’s “right to an exemption, if any, depends upon the\n\ncompetitive significance of whatever information may be contained in the documents, not upon\n\nwhether its motive is to avoid embarrassing publicity”); CNA Fin. Corp. v.

Cir. 1987) (noting that public embarrassment to a corporation does not warrant\n\nwithholding material under Exemption 4).\n\n       The identities of the agencies conducting the investigations and the status of those\n\ninvestigations are not “commercial” for Exemption 4 purposes. Therefore, the Court grants\n\nsummary judgment to the plaintiff and orders the release of any documents withheld because\n\nthey contain the identity of the agency conducting the investigation and the status of the\n\ninvestigation or proceeding.\n\n                       e. Company Communications with FDA About Off-Label Promotions\n\n       The CIAs require each company to provide copies of communications from the FDA that\n\n“substantively discuss . . . unlawful or improper promotion of [the company’s] products or the\n\nmisbranding of [the company’s] products.” Purdue CIA at 20; see Pfizer CIA at 22; Nowicki\n\nDecl. ¶ 30 (clarifying that this provision of Pfizer’s CIA is limited to “unlawful or improper\n\npromotion of [the company’s] products,” and does not include “misbranding”). Although the\n\ndefendants’ declarants say nothing about the commercial nature of these communications, again,\n\nthe Court may rely on the definition in the CIA to determine that the subject matter of the\n\ncommunications expressly relates to promotion of the companies’ products. Since this category\n\nof withheld documents pertains to the marketing and sale of the companies’ products, the Court\n\nfinds that these documents are “commercial” within the meaning of Exemption 4.\n\n\n\n                                                33\n\f                        f. Pfizer’s Off-Label Findings And Detailing Sessions\n\n        Pfizer, and not Purdue, was required to “provide to OIG a list and explanation of all\n\nactively promoted Pfizer products and, if available from third parties, information about the\n\nestimated relative usage . . . of those products for off-label purposes.” Pfizer CIA at 22.\n\nFurthermore, in each Annual Report, “Pfizer shall obtain commercially available non-Pfizer\n\nrecords reflecting the purported content and subject matter of detailing interactions between sales\n\nrepresentatives and [health care providers] for the Covered Products.” Id. After obtaining these\n\nthird party records, “Pfizer shall review the records . . . and shall identify any instances in which\n\nthe records appear to indicate that Covered Person may have discussed and/or disseminated\n\ninformation about off-label uses of the Covered Products.” Id. at 23. “Pfizer shall make findings\n\nbased on its review . . . and shall take any responsive action it deems necessary.” Id. Pfizer was\n\nrequired to provide these underlying documents and findings as part of its Annual Report. Id.\n\n        Pfizer’s declarant explains that the details it provides to the OIG about its “Review of\n\nDetailing Sessions . . . includes detailed information regarding Pfizer’s internal review and\n\nmonitoring of sales representative activities that are designed to ensure compliance with FDA\n\npromotional and other legal requirements.” Nowicki Decl. ¶ 33. This declarant further states\n\nthat this information also describes “the manner in which Pfizer addresses potential violations of\n\nCompany policies and procedures.” Id. The description of the subject matter of this category of\n\nchallenged, withheld documents is sufficiently specific to demonstrate that these documents\n\npertain to sales representative activities, and reflect activities “instrumental” to Pfizer’s\n\ncommercial operations because compliance with FDA regulations is required for Pfizer to sell its\n\nproducts. Therefore, the Court finds that the category of withheld documents regarding Pfizer’s\n\noff-label findings and detailing sessions are “commercial” for purposes of Exemption Four.\n\n\n\n                                                  34\n\f                       g. Independent Review Organization Reports\n\n       The CIAs require each company to engage an IRO to review its transactions, systems,\n\nand compliance activities. See Purdue CIA at 14; Pfizer CIA at 14. The IROs are required to\n\nprovide the companies with detailed reports regarding the IRO’s findings and, in turn, the\n\ncompanies are required to provide summaries and assessments of changes made as a result of the\n\nIRO findings. See Purdue CIA at 15; Pfizer CIA at 16–18. Pfizer’s declarant explains that the\n\nIRO’s role “is to make an independent evaluation of Pfizer’s ‘Promotional and Product Related\n\nFunctions.’” Nowicki Decl. ¶ 21. In performing this task, the IRO reports contain detailed\n\ninformation about Pfizer’s “managed care contracting process,” policies and procedures “relating\n\nto responses to financial programs” and “policies and procedures relating to responses for\n\nmedical information requests.” Def.’s Mem. at 18. Pfizer’s declarant further describes the\n\ncontents of the IRO reports as containing information “related to Pfizer’s internal structure and\n\noperations, how the company interacts with [health care providers] and the medical community,\n\nand Pfizer’s policies governing the selling, detailing, marketing, advertising, promoting and\n\nbranding of . . . all Pfizer human pharmaceutical products.” Nowicki Decl. ¶ 22. Purdue’s\n\ndeclarant states that the IRO report contains “an extensive, probing review of Purdue’s\n\nconfidential business systems and policies, as well as selected samples of individual\n\ntransactions.” Weinstein Decl. ¶ 20. These reports contain such information as the identity of\n\ncustomers and the underlying business practices that gave rise to the need for corrective action.\n\nId.\n\n       This description of the information contained in the IRO reports is sufficiently detailed to\n\nleave the Court no doubt that these documents include extensive information about the\n\ndefendant-intervenors’ marketing and sales programs and contracting processes, and,\n\nconsequently, are commercial under Exemption 4.\n                                                35\n\f                       h. 2009 Purdue Supplement\n\n       The plaintiff challenges the withholding of the 2009 Purdue Supplement, which it\n\ndescribes as the “transmittal memorandum and supplement to Purdue’s first annual compliance\n\nreport.” Pl.’s Mem. at 26. According to the plaintiff this “cover memorandum” to OIG was\n\nproduced only in heavily redacted form. Id. The Purdue Vaughn Index states that the “withheld\n\nportions of the document [under Exemption 4] contain information regarding Purdue’s\n\npromotional monitoring program and other confidential and proprietary policies and\n\nprocedures.” Purdue Vaughn Index No. 22. A promotional monitoring program falls within the\n\nscope of commercial information under Exemption 4 because it pertains directly to the methods\n\nby which Purdue sells its products.\n\n       Yet, the vague reference in the Purdue Vaughn Index to “other confidential and\n\nproprietary policies” is insufficient to allow the Court to determine whether those portions of the\n\ndocument are commercial under Exemption 4. Purdue Vaughn Index No. 22. Thus, to the extent\n\nthat the 2009 Purdue Supplement pertains to its promotional monitoring program, the Court finds\n\nthat it is “commercial” within the meaning of Exemption 4. Given the paucity of information\n\nprovided in the declarations and Purdue Vaughn Index about the other portions of the document,\n\nhowever, it is impossible for the Court to determine whether the entire document contains\n\ncommercial information and whether any non-commercial information can be segregated from\n\nthe commercial information. Therefore, the Court denies summary judgment to all parties\n\npertaining to the “other confidential and proprietary policies” as to the segregable parts of the\n\n2009 Purdue Supplement.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 36\n\f                                         *       *      *\n\n       In sum, the following categories, or sub-parts of categories, of challenged, withheld\n\ndocuments are not “commercial,” and the Court grants summary judgment to the plaintiff with\n\nrespect the portions of the Annual Reports that require the defendant-intervenors to report on: (1)\n\nthe “name, title, and responsibilities of any person determined to be an Ineligible Person,”\n\npursuant to the Purdue CIA §§ III.F and V.B.12, and the Pfizer CIA §§ III.F and V.B.11; and (2)\n\nthe identity of the agency conducting, and status of, an investigation or proceeding, pursuant to\n\nthe Purdue CIA §§ III.G and V.B.13, and the Pfizer CIA §§ III.G and V.B.15.\n\n       Due to the insufficiency of the declarations and Vaughn indices, the Court is unable to\n\nassess for the following categories, or sub-parts of categories, of challenged, withheld documents\n\nwhether the subject matter is “commercial” for the purpose of Exemption 4: (1) Reportable\n\nEvent summaries, submitted pursuant to §§ III.H and V.B.9 of the Purdue CIA, and §§ III.H and\n\nV.B.12 of the Pfizer CIA; (2) disclosure log summaries, submitted pursuant to the §§ III.E and\n\nV.B.10 of the Purdue CIA, and §§ III.E and V.B.14 of the Pfizer CIA ; and (3) references to\n\n“other confidential and proprietary policies” in the 2009 Purdue Supplement. The Court will\n\ngive the defendant and defendant-intervenors the opportunity to supplement their declarations\n\nand/or Vaughn indices to sustain their burden of showing the commercial nature of these\n\ndocuments or, alternatively, to release them.

FCC, No. 06-1718, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">2171793</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7 (D.D.C.

The Court next examines the\n\nsufficiency of the showing that these commercial documents are confidential to warrant\n\napplication of Exemption 4.\n\n                  3.        Sufficiency of Showing That Commercial Documents Are Confidential\n\n         A “commercial” document may only be withheld under Exemption 4 if it is\n\n“privileged” 19 or “confidential.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4). A two prong test is used to determine\n\n\n19\n    Pfizer argues that all of the challenged documents fall under the “self-evaluation and self-critical reports”\nprivilege for Exemption 4 purposes. Pfizer Mem. at 22. The Court is not persuaded by Pfizer’s tortured reading of\nCircuit precedent. Pfizer cites only a single, unpublished district court case from this Circuit to support its\nproposition that “courts have long recognized” a self-evaluative privilege. Id. (citing Washington Post Co. v. Dep’t\nof Justice, Civil Action No. 84-3581, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist. LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">14936</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *21 (D.D.C. Sept. 25, 1987)). As Pfizer\npoints out, that case was reversed on other grounds. See Wash. Post Co. v.

Indeed, in remanding that case for consideration of the applicability of a FOIA exemption other than\nExemption 4, the D.C. Circuit court reserved judgment as to whether Exemption 4 encompasses a self-evaluative\nprivilege. Id. (“We will decide the exemption (4) question” if “the report [at issue] is not shielded under exemption\n(7)(B)”). Notably, the D.C. Circuit has rejected the use of the “self-evaluative privilege in the context of private\nlitigation . . . where… the documents in question have been sought by a governmental agency,” FTC v. TRW, Inc.,\n\n                                                         38\n\fwhether information involuntarily submitted to a Federal agency is “confidential” for FOIA\n\npurposes. “Commercial or financial matter is ‘confidential’ for purposes of the exemption if\n\ndisclosure of the information is likely to have either of the following effects: (1) to impair the\n\nGovernment’s ability to obtain necessary information in the future; or (2) to cause substantial\n\nharm to the competitive position of the person from whom the information was obtained.” Nat’l\n\nParks and Conserv.

No case from any federal court has\nbeen cited by the parties in which the “self-evaluative privilege” was successfully used to justify the withholding of\ndocuments under Exemption 4. The Court declines to extend whatever self-evaluative privilege may exist in the\ncivil discovery context to shield from disclosure under Exemption 4 reports involuntarily provided to a government\nagency and, thus, only considers whether the commercial documents withheld in this case are also confidential.\n20\n   The bar is lower for withholding confidential information voluntarily provided to the Government: voluntarily\nsubmitted information need only be “of a kind that would customarily not be released to the public by the person\nfrom whom it was obtained” to be withheld as confidential. Critical Mass, 975 F.2d at 878. While HHS and\nPurdue, which joined HHS’ arguments, concede that the companies’ submissions to OIG were involuntary, Pfizer\ncontends that because it entered into its CIA with HHS voluntarily, the information required by the CIA was also\nproduced voluntarily. See Pfizer Mem. at 16–17. Pfizer’s argument is contrary to the law of this Circuit. “For\npurposes of Exemption 4, information provided to the government because it is required for participation in a\nvoluntary government program is treated as a mandatory, as opposed to a voluntary, submission of information.”\nJudicial Watch, Inc. v.

As such, the information was submitted involuntarily because it was submitted\n“pursuant to statute, regulation, or some less formal mandate.” Pub. Health Research Grp., 964 F. Supp. at 414 n.1.\nTherefore, the Court will apply the more stringent confidentiality standard applicable to involuntarily submitted\ndocuments recognized in National Parks and Critical Mass.\n\n                                                         39\n\f                        a. The Government’s Ability to Obtain Necessary Information\n\n        The defendant argues that the release of the withheld documents would harm the\n\ngovernment’s interest in two ways. “First, health care providers currently under CIAs would be\n\nreluctant to provide complete information,” citing as an example that “providers may hesitate to\n\nfully explain the circumstances or submit their full investigative reports if they are concerned\n\nthat the public may have access to that information [regarding instances of possible\n\nnoncompliance].” Def.’s Mem. at 26. “Second, the OIG’s inability to prevent the disclosure of\n\nconfidential proprietary information would severely impair [HHS’s] ability to negotiate\n\nmeaningful CIAs in the future.” Id. Neither argument is persuasive.\n\n        First, the Court is skeptical of the defendant’s contention that release of the withheld\n\ncommercial information could jeopardize the government’s ability to obtain full and complete\n\nreporting as required under the CIAs. The court in Critical Mass was similarly skeptical about\n\nimpairment of the government’s ability to obtain information when the submission was required.\n\nCritical Mass, 975 F.2d at 878 (“because the concessioners [were] required to provide this\n\nfinancial information . . . there is presumably no danger that the public disclosure will impair the\n\nability of the Government to obtain this information in the future”) (alteration in original).\n\nInstead, the D.C. Circuit explained that the focus is on the risk that disclosure may adversely\n\naffect the “continued reliability” or “quality” of the information obtained by the government, not\n\nits availability. Id.\n\n        With respect to the “quality” of the submissions, the government is well-protected by the\n\npenalty terms of the CIAs for breaches of the reporting requirements. The CIAs contain\n\nextensive monetary and injunctive penalties for violations of the agreement, including exclusion\n\nfrom federal health care programs, the so-called “death penalty.” See Purdue CIA at 32–38;\n\nPfizer CIA at 30–36. For instance, if Pfizer were to fail “to report a Reportable Event and take\n                                                 40\n\fcorrective action, as required in Section III.H,” Pfizer could be considered in material breach of\n\nthe agreement. Pfizer CIA at 33 (Section X.D.1.a) “The parties agree that a material breach of\n\nthe CIA by Pfizer constitutes an independent basis for Pfizer’s exclusion from participation in\n\nthe federal health care programs.” Id. at 34 (Section X.D.2). Other failures to adhere fully to the\n\nCIA can lead to substantial monetary penalties. See Pfizer CIA at 31–32 (Section X.A); Purdue\n\nCIA at 32–33 (Section X.A). Thus, the defendant has a variety of methods by which to\n\nguarantee the continued completeness and accuracy of the reports submitted by these and other\n\ncompanies subject to CIAs.\n\n        The defendant’s second argument about future trouble negotiating CIAs is similarly\n\nunavailing, and largely for the same reason: namely, that the alternative to full compliance with\n\nthe CIAs is a potentially draconian penalty. CIAs are entered into as part of “the resolution of\n\ncivil and administrative health care fraud cases.” Demske Decl. ¶ 2. The incentive to enter into\n\nsuch an agreement is that “the OIG agrees not to seek an exclusion of that entity from\n\nparticipation in Federal health care programs.” Id. Exclusion from Federal health care programs\n\nis such a severe penalty that it is known in the healthcare industry as “a corporate death\n\nsentence.” Kesselheim Decl. ¶ 9. It strains credulity to believe that the specter of potential\n\ndisclosure under the FOIA of certain information required to be submitted to the agency pursuant\n\nto a CIA’s requirements would lead a pharmaceutical company to choose instead the risk of\n\nexclusion from federal drug reimbursement programs. Indeed, “nearly every” Department of\n\nJustice investigations into the types of behavior that led to Pfizer and Purdue’s original CIAs\n\n“has resulted in a settlement with the defendant pharmaceutical manufacturer, with\n\n\n\n\n                                                41\n\fmanufacturers choosing not to risk a finding of guilt at trial and exclusion from engaging in\n\nfederal health programs.” Id. 21\n\n         Purdue’s declarant seeks to bolster the defendant’s impairment argument by stating that\n\n“It was critical to Purdue during negotiation of the CIA with OIG that the materials Purdue\n\nwould submit to OIG would be kept confidential and not subject to disclosure under FOIA.”\n\nSupplemental Declaration of Bert Weinstein, Vice-President of Corporate Compliance, Purdue\n\nPharma, (“Weinstein Suppl. Decl.”) ¶ 2, ECF No. 29-1. This is belied by other language\n\nincluded in the CIA, however, which makes clear that submitted information may be subject to\n\ndisclosure under the FOIA. While the CIA permits Purdue to “clearly identify any portions of its\n\nsubmissions that it believes are trade secrets, or information that is commercial or financial and\n\nprivileged or confidential, and therefore potentially exempt from disclosure under the Freedom\n\nof Information Act,” Purdue CIA at 30, the final determination must be left up to the agency.\n\nSee 5 U.S.C. § 552(a). In any event, merely because it was important to Purdue “that the\n\nmaterials Purdue would submit to OIG” be shielded from disclosure is not the same as saying\n\nPurdue would not have signed the CIA without such assurances. Purdue, notably, never makes\n\nsuch an argument, nor does the defendant agency.\n\n\n\n\n21\n  The defendant briefly cites two cases for its position that the first prong of the National Parks test is met and\nrelease of the documents would impair the government’s ability to secure CIAs with companies in the future, but\nneither case is persuasive.

In Judicial Watch, the Export-Import Bank established that if\ndisclosure of the withheld records at issue were required, the “Bank’s function of providing insurance would be\nundermined” and its ability “to fulfill its statutory purpose” would be impaired. Id. at 29–30. The defendant here\nnowhere claims that disclosure would have such dire results as impairing its ability to carry out its statutory purpose.\nThe other case cited by the defendant is likewise inapposite.

Cir. 2004)\n\n(party invoking Exemption 4 is not required “to prove disclosure certainly would cause it\n\nsubstantial competitive harm, but only that disclosure would ‘likely’ do so”). Not all harm to the\n\ninformation provider qualifies as “competitive harm.” As noted, the D.C. Circuit has made clear\n\nthat, “[i]n this inquiry, it is simply irrelevant that” confidential treatment of the documents would\n\navoid disclosure of information “that might be damaging to [the provider’s] reputation.”\n\nOccidental Petroleum Corp., 873 F.2d at 341 (D.C. Cir. 1989). To qualify as “substantial\n\ncompetitive harm,” the harm must be “limited to harm flowing from the affirmative use of\n\nproprietary information by competitors.” Pub. Citizen Health Research Grp., 704 F.2d at 1291\n\n& n.30 (emphasis in the original). 22\n\n\n22\n  The defendant spills a great deal of ink on the argument that “when a company invests time and other resources\ninto developing policies and procedures, among other things, they will face competitive harm if those products are\n\n                                                        43\n\f         Based upon the Court’s foregoing analysis, the following challenged records are\n\n“commercial” and must meet this second prong of the National Parks test to be appropriately\n\nwithheld under Exemption 4: (1) changes to the processes by which the intervenor-defendants\n\nfulfill the Ineligible Persons requirement; (2) the description of the allegations subject to\n\ninvestigations or legal proceedings; (3) company communications with the FDA regarding off-\n\nlabel promotions; (4) Pfizer’s off-label findings and detailing sessions; (5) IRO reports; and (6)\n\nthe portions of the 2009 Purdue Supplement addressing Purdue’s promotional monitoring\n\nprogram. Each of these categories of commercial documents is examined below to evaluate the\n\nsufficiency of the showing that disclosure would cause substantial competitive harm to the\n\ndefendant-intervenors.\n\n         In reviewing the sufficiency of the declarations and Vaughn indices, the Court is mindful\n\nthat merely conclusory statements about competitive harm, even if repeated numerous times, are\n\nnot sufficient. See Pub. Citizen Health Research Grp., 704 F.2d at 1290-1291 (“Conclusory and\n\ngeneralized allegations of substantial competitive harm, of course, are unacceptable and cannot\n\nsupport an agency's decision to withhold requested documents.”); Occidental, 873 F.2d at 342\n\n(requiring more than “conclusory statement” regarding substantial competitive harm); Wash.\n\nPost Co., 690 F.2d at 269 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (“[T]he government produced no evidence except a\n\nconclusory affidavit by the HHS director of personnel policy. Thus, the government has not yet\n\nestablished its Exemption 4 claim.”); Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Air Force, 566 F.2d\n\nreleased to the public.” Def.’s Reply at 15 (alterations in original omitted). The level of resource expenditures may\nbe relevant to evaluating the proprietary nature of information, but it is not necessarily a measure of competitive\nharm for purposes of Exemption 4. Rather, it is the prospect of the affirmative use of the disclosed information by\ncompetitors that makes release of the information competitively harmful. See Pub. Citizen Health Research Grp.,\n704 F.2d at 1291. The defendant’s argument is a virtual non-sequitur in this case, because the primary argument\nraised by the plaintiff is not about the level of resource expenditures in the creation of the withheld records, but\nrather that release of these records would not constitute competitive harm because they could not be used\naffirmatively by the defendant-intervenors’ competitors. See Pl.’s Reply at 12. Furthermore, to the extent the\nplaintiff “ignore[d]” the resource expenditure defense to disclosure, as the defendant contends, Def.’s Reply at 15,\nthis does not amount to “concession” since the level of expenditures is irrelevant.\n\n                                                         44\n\f242, 258 (D.C.

Cir. 1988).\n\n       First, to support the contention that disclosure of the changes implemented by the\n\ndefendant-intervenors for screening and removing Ineligible Persons would cause substantial\n\ncompetitive harm, Pfizer’s declarant explains that “[t]his information reflects Pfizer’s internal\n\nbusiness processes and judgments made to develop and implement the Ineligible Person\n\nManagement process . . . .” Nowicki Decl. ¶ 29. Purdue’s declarant mentions only that “the\n\ndetermination, screening and training of relevant covered persons/vendors, as well as its\n\nproposed actions regarding ineligible persons, all directly relate to Purdue’s compliance with\n\nlegal and regulatory requirements, and are proprietary in nature.” Weinstein Decl. ¶ 15. These\n\nprocess changes reflect the companies’ views of effective ways in which to ferret out Ineligible\n\nPersons, in the context of the companies’ particular organizational structure and operations.\n\nAlthough the declarations provide only slim support, the Court finds that disclosure of these\n\nprocess changes may risk competitive harm by revealing confidential information about the\n\ncompanies’ broader structure and operations in which the changes to Ineligible Persons processes\n\nare implemented. See United Technologies, 601 F.3d at 564 (finding proprietary manufacturing\n\n\n\n                                                 45\n\fand quality control processes were subject to withholding under Exemption 4 since “[o]nce\n\ndisclosed, competitors could, it appears, use the information to improve their own manufacturing\n\nand quality control systems, thus making ‘affirmative use of proprietary information’ against\n\nwhich Exemption 4 is meant to guard.”). Consequently, the Court grants summary judgment to\n\nthe defendant and defendant-intervenors as to the withholding under Exemption 4 of documents\n\nreflecting “changes in process” pertaining to Ineligible Persons.\n\n       Second, regarding the likely competitive harm posed by disclosure of documents\n\ncontaining the description of the allegations subject to investigations or legal proceedings, the\n\ndefendant and defendant-intervenors have not provided a sufficient showing to sustain summary\n\njudgment. Pfizer’s declarant states only that “the summary information that Pfizer submits to\n\nOIG is highly sensitive, confidential information that Pfizer does not publicly release.” Nowicki\n\nDecl. ¶ 28. This conclusory statement says nothing about how the revelation of these\n\ndescriptions of allegations, now dating back to at least several years ago, would be used by\n\ncompetitors affirmatively to harm Pfizer. Purdue’s declarant does no better by stating “[p]ublic\n\ndisclosure of this information, which includes non-public legal and/or regulatory actions, such as\n\nwith a Reportable Event, would certainly have negative commercial consequences for Purdue.”\n\nWeinstein Decl. ¶ 26. This is a conclusory statement that, again, does nothing to show why or\n\nhow competitors will be able to use this information affirmatively cause to harm to Purdue. As\n\nnoted, Exemption Four does not shield embarrassing information or information that may cause\n\nreputational harm, but only information that can be affirmatively used by a competitor. See CNA\n\nFin. Corp. v. Donovan, 830 F.2d at 1154 & n.158; Pub. Citizen Health Research Grp., 704 F.2d\n\nat 1291 n.30. Therefore, the Court denies summary judgment to all parties regarding the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 46\n\fdescriptions of allegations contained in the summaries of legal and investigatory inquiries\n\nprovided by the defendant-intervenors in their Annual Reports.\n\n       Third, the defendant-intervenors’ communications with the FDA regarding off-label\n\nmarketing are at least partially non-confidential. Pfizer’s declarant makes this clear when he\n\nstates that “Pfizer’s communications with the FDA are usually confidential commercial\n\ninformation that Pfizer maintains under strict confidentiality.” Nowicki Decl. ¶ 30 (emphasis\n\nsupplied). This statement implicitly acknowledges that these communications are not always\n\nstrictly confidential, which is further confirmed by the declarant’s statement that some\n\ncommunications, such as Warning Letters from the FDA, are publicly available. Id. Purdue’s\n\ndeclarant says nothing to address this category of records. Neither the Vaughn indices nor the\n\ndeclarations provide sufficient specificity for the Court to determine which documents may\n\ncontain confidential commercial information and which do not. Therefore, summary judgment\n\nas to the company communications with the FDA will be denied to all parties.\n\n       Fourth, Pfizer’s off-label findings and detailing sessions are the murkiest of the withheld\n\nrecords requested by the plaintiff. Pfizer’s declarant does little to shed light on what the\n\ndetailing sessions are, how they are conducted, and from where the records are derived. He\n\nmerely states that the information “is highly confidential and includes detailed information\n\nregarding Pfizer’s internal review and monitoring of sales representative activities,” but neither\n\nPfizer nor the defendant has explained how Pfizer obtains the underlying documents on which\n\nthese analyses are based. See Nowicki Decl. ¶ 33. Nevertheless, since the off-label findings by\n\nPfizer reflect the company’s “findings” about its own sales force’ activities, the potential risk of\n\ncompetitive harm from disclosure of what those activities are is plain. Therefore, as to Pfizer’s\n\n\n\n\n                                                 47\n\foff-label findings, the Court grants summary judgment to the defendant and defendant-\n\nintervenors.\n\n        The documents reflecting “detailing sessions” are more difficult, particularly given the\n\nlack of information provided to the Court about the precise nature of these documents. The CIA\n\nrequires Pfizer to obtain “commercially available non-Pfizer records” to conduct its review.\n\nPfizer CIA at 22. If these detailing session documents are commercially available from third\n\nparties, it is unclear what the basis is at all for Pfizer’s assertion of confidentiality. In any event,\n\nthe level of specificity provided as to the nature of the detailing session documents is too\n\nminimal to demonstrate, as is the agency’s burden, that the release of this information would\n\ncause competitive harm. Therefore, summary judgment is denied to all parties as to the\n\ndocuments containing detailing sessions.\n\n        Fifth, the IRO Reports present “an extensive, probing review of Purdue’s confidential\n\nbusiness systems and policies, as well as selected samples of individual transactions,” Weinstein\n\n¶ 20, and “Pfizer’s internal structure and operations, how the company interacts with HCPs and\n\nthe medical community, and Pfizer’s policies governing the selling, detailing, marketing,\n\nadvertising, promoting and branding of Government Reimbursed Projects, meaning all Pfizer\n\nhuman pharmaceutical products promoted or sold by Pfizer in the United States that are\n\nreimbursable by Federal health care programs,” Nowicki Decl. ¶ 22. These details make clear\n\nthat competitive harm would result from their disclosure. For instance, Purdue’s declarant states\n\nthat the reports contain “selected samples of individual transactions . . . which may contain\n\nprivate patient information as well as . . . the identity of Healthcare Professionals who are\n\ncustomers.” Weinstein ¶ 20. It is thus obvious that the release of such information would be\n\nakin to releasing customer lists which could easily be used affirmatively by competitors to harm\n\n\n\n                                                   48\n\fPurdue. Similarly, a competitor could certainly use internal details of the sale and marketing of\n\nPfizer’s products against it a number of ways, such as setting prices, competing for ad space, or\n\nidentifying areas of strength or weakness. Therefore, the Court finds that information pertaining\n\nto the IRO Reports, responses, and corrective action taken in response to the IRO Reports were\n\nproperly withheld under Exemption 4, and summary judgment is granted to the defendant and\n\ndefendant-intervenors on this category of information.\n\n       Finally, Purdue’s declarant makes only a single conclusory statement about the potential\n\ncompetitive harm that could be caused by the release of the 2009 Purdue Supplement, stating that\n\nthe promotional monitoring program “is considered proprietary and highly confidential. Thus, it\n\nwould be detrimental to Purdue if these documents were publicly disclosed.” Weinstein Decl. ¶\n\n29. These nineteen words provide only slim support for a finding that competitive harm is likely\n\nto result from revelation of this promotional monitoring program. Nevertheless, the subject\n\nmatter plainly relates to core aspects of the company’s marketing and sales efforts and, thus, how\n\nPurdue conducts those activities in compliance with applicable regulations and laws. Similar to\n\nthe changes in business processes that the defendant-intervenors use to fulfill the Ineligible\n\nPersons requirement, disclosure of how Purdue has continued to perfect its promotional\n\nmonitoring program could be put to affirmative use by its competitors, thus making it\n\nconfidential under the terms of Exemption 4. Therefore, summary judgment is granted to the\n\ndefendant and defendant-intervenors on the withholding of Purdue’s promotional monitoring\n\nprogram information contained in the 2009 Purdue Supplement.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 49\n\f                                          *      *       *\n\n       In sum, of the six categories, or sub-parts of categories, found to contain commercial\n\nmatter, the Court concludes that there is sufficient support for finding that the following withheld\n\ndocuments are also confidential: (1) changes to the processes by which the companies fulfill the\n\nIneligible Persons requirement in § III.F of the Purdue and Pfizer CIAs; (2) Pfizer’s off-label\n\nfindings required to be included in the Annual Reports, pursuant to §§ III.J and V.B.17 of the\n\nPfizer CIA; (3) IRO reports required to be included in the Annual Reports, pursuant to §§ III.D\n\nand V.B.5-8 of the Purdue CIA and §§ III.D and V.B.6-9 of the Pfizer CIA; and (4) the portions\n\nof the 2009 Purdue Supplement addressing Purdue’s promotional monitoring program.\n\nTherefore, this information was properly withheld under Exemption 4, and summary judgment is\n\ngranted to the defendant and defendant-intervenors as to these documents. The declarations and\n\nVaughn indices submitted to support the withholding of the remaining commercial documents\n\nare insufficient for the Court to assess whether the documents warrant confidential treatment and\n\nqualify for withholding under Exemption 4. Thus, summary judgment is denied to all parties\n\nwith respect to the following documents containing commercial matter: (1) the description of the\n\nallegations subject to investigations or legal proceedings required to be included in the Annual\n\nReports, pursuant to § III.G of the Purdue and Pfizer CIAs; (2) company communications with\n\nthe FDA regarding off-label promotions required to be included in the Annual Reports, pursuant\n\nto § III.I of the Purdue and Pfizer CIAs; and (3) Pfizer’s detailing sessions required to be\n\nincluded in the Annual Reports, pursuant to §§ III.J and V.B.17 of the Pfizer CIA. As to these\n\ndocuments, the defendant and defendant-intervenors may submit supplemental declarations\n\nand/or Vaughn indices demonstrating that disclosure of the withheld documents would likely\n\ncause competitive harm or, alternatively, release the withheld documents.\n\n\n\n                                                 50\n\f       Finally, any supplemental support for continued withholding of any of the challenged\n\ndocuments must also address whether any reasonably segregable portions of withheld documents\n\nhave been released, keeping in mind that an “‘agency cannot justify withholding an entire\n\ndocument simply by showing that it contains some exempt material.’” Hodge v. FBI, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">703</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">575</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 582 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (quoting Stolt-Nielsen Transp. Grp., 534 F.3d at 734).\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n       The fundamental problem in this case is the lack of detail provided in the defendants’\n\ndeclarations and the Vaughn indices. Mere conclusory statements regarding the alleged\n\ncommercial nature and confidentiality of the records withheld is not sufficient to allow this Court\n\nto determine whether the withheld information is properly exempt under FOIA’s Exemption 4.\n\n       For the reasons explained above, the Motion for Summary Judgment of the defendant and\n\ndefendant-intervenors is denied in part and granted in part. This motion is DENIED, without\n\nprejudice, because the Court has insufficient information to determine if the disputed records are\n\n“commercial” within the meaning of Exemption 4 with respect to (1) the Reportable Events\n\nsummaries required by § V.B.9 of the Purdue CIA and § V.B.12 of the Pfizer CIA; (2) the\n\nDisclosure Log summaries required by § V.B.10 of the Purdue CIA and § V.B.14 of the Pfizer\n\nCIA; (3) the title and responsibility information of Ineligible Persons required by § V.B.11 of the\n\nPfizer CIA and § V.B.12 of the Purdue CIA; (4) information pertaining to the agency conducting\n\nan investigation and the status of that investigation required by § V.B.13 of the Purdue CIA and\n\n§ V.B.15 of the Pfizer CIA; and (5) reasonably segregable information in the 2009 Purdue\n\nSupplement that does not pertain to its promotional monitoring program. The defendant and\n\ndefendant-intervenors’ Motion is also DENIED, without prejudice, because the Court does not\n\nhave sufficient information to determine if the disputed records are confidential within the\n\n\n\n                                                51\n\fmeaning of Exemption 4 with respect to (6) the summaries of legal and investigatory inquiries\n\nrequired by § V.B.13 of the Purdue CIA and § V.B.15 of the Pfizer CIA; (7) company\n\ncommunications with the FDA as required by § V.B.14 of the Purdue CIA and § V.B.16 of the\n\nPfizer CIA; and (8) the “underlying records reflecting the content of detailing sessions between\n\nHCPs and Covered persons” as required in § V.B.17 of the Pfizer CIA.\n\n       The Motion for Summary Judgment of the defendant and defendant-intervenors is\n\nGRANTED with respect to the following records, which the Court finds were properly withheld\n\nunder Exemption 4 as commercial and confidential: (1) the records reflecting “changes in\n\nprocess” of the monitoring and removal of Ineligible Persons required by § V.B.11 of the Purdue\n\nCIA and § V.B.10 of the Pfizer CIA; (2) the Off-Label Findings and summary of responsive\n\naction taken by Pfizer required by § V.B.17 of the Pfizer CIA; (3) the IRO reports required by §§\n\nV.B.5–8 of the Purdue CIA and §§ V.B.6–9 of the Pfizer CIA; and (4) the portions of the 2009\n\nPurdue Supplement pertaining to its promotional monitoring program.\n\n       The plaintiff’s Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment is granted in part and denied in part.\n\nThe Cross-Motion is GRANTED as to the inadequacy of the defendant’s search for responsive\n\nrecords regarding the Pfizer Section V.B.6 documents; and as to the following records, which the\n\nCourt finds were not properly withheld under Exemption 4 and must be released to the plaintiff:\n\n(1) the titles and responsibilities of Ineligible Persons removed required by § V.B.12 of the\n\nPurdue CIA and § V.B.11 of the Pfizer CIA; and (2) the identity of the investigatory agency and\n\nstatus of any investigations required by § V.B.13 of the Purdue CIA and § V.B.15 of the Pfizer\n\nCIA. In all other respects, the plaintiff’s Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED,\n\nwithout prejudice.\n\n\n\n\n                                                52\n\f       For the remaining records at issue, the parties are directed to meet and confer and, by\n\nNovember 8, 2013, provide the Court with (1) a status report that sets forth a list of the records\n\nthat remain in dispute, in light of this Memorandum Opinion, and that identifies each such\n\ndisputed record by a Bates number, or other unique identifier, and by citation to the particular\n\npage(s) of the Vaughn index where the disputed record is described; and (2) a proposed briefing\n\nschedule for any further proceedings in this matter, including deadlines for the submission of any\n\nrenewed dispositive motions, supplementary Vaughn indices, and/or supplementary declarations.\n\n       An appropriate Order accompanies this decision.\n\n\n                                                                       Digitally signed by Beryl A.
