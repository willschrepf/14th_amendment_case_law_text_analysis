The items involved include land used as a garage, office building, and a steam plant building and equipment. This property had been regularly assessed by the State Tax Commission for the year 1945 at a total valuation of $39,470, along with other items not here involved. The City of Laurel, acting upon the assumption that the location of the specific items in Jones County and the City of Laurel authorized assessment by it, fixed same at $111,014. The question involves a construction chiefly of Constitution 1890, Section 112, and Code 1942, Sections 9825, 9826, 9829, 9833 and 9836.</p>\n<p>Section 112 of our Constitution provides as follows: \"The legislature may provide for a special mode of valuation and assessment for railroads, and railroad and other corporate property, or for particular species of property belonging to persons, corporations or associations not situated wholly in one county. But all such property <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 153</span> \nshall be assessed at its true value, and no county shall be denied the right to levy county and special taxes upon such assessment as in other cases of property situated and assessed in the county.\"</p>\n<p>Code Section 9825 provides that: \"The members of the state tax commission are constituted state assessors of railroads and other public service corporations, and they shall . . . assess the property of . . . electric power and light companies . . . liable to taxation in the state.\"</p>\n<p>Code Section 9826 provides for the assessment, by the said assessing body, of railroads and Section 9835 provides that a \". . . corporation owning or operating a . . . electric power and/or electric light company owning property not situated wholly in one county\" shall file the same schedule required of railroads. Section 9829 requires the State Railroad Assessors to make out assessment roll for each county having \"any . . . electric power and/or electric light company property not situated wholly in one county . . .\" This section provides for the apportionment of assessed valuations in the following cases (1) when all the property of such public utility is located within the limits of a county; (2) when such property is located in more than one county; and (3) when such property is located in more than one state. The appellant is disclosed to own and operate such public utility in twenty-three counties in this State and the office building located in the city of Laurel is supervisory headquarters for five counties.</p>\n<p>After, and in disregard of, the assessment by the members of the State Tax Commission acting as railroad assessors, the appellee made its own assessment, fixing same at the figures applicable the preceding year. Objections filed by appellant were overruled by the City Commissioners, whose finding that the City had authority to assess such items located therein was affirmed by the Circuit Court.

In this transition stage with complete dismantling imminent the valuation of the steam plant equipment was estimated by the railroad assessors on the basis of discarded or junk material. It was in fact disconnected from the company's line during 1944 and sold.

If the premise were correct so would be also the conclusion. The statute, Code, 1942, Sec. 9833, uses this language both in its title and in its text, stating, \". . . an electric light company owning property not situated wholly in one county, shall be assessed . . .\" By borrowing this language neither we nor the legislature were ignoring the fact that the assessment is in rem. On the other hand, it is thereby emphasized that the \"company\" is the sum total of its properties, and is therefore appraised and assessed with reference to its status as an integrated, homogeneous unit, which includes all of the component items of property necessary or expedient to the operation of such unit.</p>\n<p>The contention still insisted upon, that the assessed items had been discontinued as operating components, is not borne out by the record, and if sustained, would of itself suggest the impropriety of an assessment thereof on the basis of valuation applicable to its appraisement as a functioning component of an operating unit.
