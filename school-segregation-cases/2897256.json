Civil Action No. 04-cv-01697)\n                District Judge: Honorable Peter G. Sheridan\n\n\n               Submitted Pursuant to Third Circuit LAR 34.1(a)\n                              February 1, 2008\n\n        Before: SLOVITER, BARRY and GREENBERG, Circuit Judges\n\f                             (Opinion filed: February 4, 2008)\n\n\n\n                                         OPINION\n\n\nPER CURIAM\n\n       Bernard Laufgas appeals pro se from the District Court’s entry of partial summary\n\njudgment and from its entry of judgment on a jury verdict. For the reasons that follow,\n\nwe will affirm.1\n\n                                              I.\n\n       This matter arises from Laufgas’s four-month incarceration at the Passaic County\n\nAdult Correctional Institution, where he was serving a sentence for contempt of court\n\nduring Chancery Division proceedings not relevant to the present appeal.2\n\n       Prior to his incarceration, Laufgas sent a letter to the Warden of the Passaic\n\nCounty jail to notify the prison of his special needs. In the letter, Laufgas provided his\n\nphysician’s name, listed his daily medications and dietary restrictions, and indicated that\n\nhe would need access to the prison law library. Laufgas further noted that, “[i]f for some\n\nreason you will deny me those basic Constitutional rights, I assure you, once I get out I\n\nwill institute legal action in the United States District Court against each of you, your\n\n\n\n   1\n    We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n   2\n   The full history of the underlying action is set forth in Amoresano v. Laufgas, 796\nA.2d 164 (N.J. 2002).\n\n                                              2\n\fdepartment, and Passaic County.” (Compl., at Ex. A.)\n\n       Laufgas’s sentence began on February 8, 2002. Immediately upon his arrival at\n\nthe Passaic County prison, Laufgas was dissatisfied with the conditions of his\n\nconfinement. His primary complaint was that the prison failed to provide him with meals\n\ntailored to his medical conditions; according to Laufgas, he could not tolerate salt, fried\n\nfoods, milk, eggs, coffee, or sugar. Because the Passaic County defendants failed to meet\n\nthese restrictions, Laufgas commenced a hunger and medication strike that lasted for\n\nseveral days. In the following weeks, Laufgas carried out two more hunger and\n\nmedication strikes. After Laufgas’s third strike, prison officials took Laufgas to St.\n\nMary’s Hospital for a psychiatric evaluation.3\n\n       Over the course of his incarceration, Laufgas lodged various additional complaints,\n\nincluding complaints about the law library, his prison cell, and his telephone access. In\n\nthe end, Laufgas filed approximately 150 Ombudsman Request Forms demanding various\n\npersonal items, privileges, or other treatment. Laufgas was released on April 14, 2002.\n\n                                             II.\n\n       On April 15, 2004, Laufgas filed a complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of New Jersey concerning the treatment he\n\nreceived at the Passaic County jail. The complaint named as defendants the following\n\nPassaic County employees: Jerry Speziale, Passaic County Sheriff; Charles S. Meyers,\n\n\n   3\n    Laufgas was temporarily transferred to the Ann Klein Forensic Center before he\nreturned to the Passaic County jail.\n\n                                              3\n\fprison warden; Brian S. Bendel, deputy warden; Officer Hector Hernandez; and Magdy\n\nWahba, Director and Head Physician (the “Passaic County defendants”). The complaint\n\nalso named as defendants St. Mary’s Hospital and two doctors at St. Mary’s Hospital’s\n\nPsychiatric Emergency Services (the “St. Mary’s defendants”).4\n\n       In the complaint, Laufgas first alleged that prison officials were deliberately\n\nindifferent to his needs by: failing to honor his dietary restrictions; failing to provide two\n\nhot meals a day; housing him in unsanitary conditions; denying him use of his pre-paid\n\nphone card; subjecting him to second-hand smoke; depriving him of recreational\n\nfacilities; depriving him of proper bedding; depriving him of a shower and clean clothing;\n\nand disposing of his personal belongings. Next, Laufgas alleged that his constitutional\n\nrights were violated when he—a Jewish individual—was housed with individuals from\n\nArab countries and of Muslim faith. Laufgas further alleged that he was deprived of his\n\nright of access to the courts because he was prevented from using the law library, the law\n\nlibrary was “outdated,” and he was denied use of his pre-paid phone card. In a related\n\nclaim, Laufgas alleged that his incoming mail was censored. Next, Laufgas stated claims\n\nfor “ombudsman abuse” and “denial of request for indigent status.” In his final three\n\nclaims, Laufgas alleged that he was forced to undergo an unwarranted psychiatric\n\nevaluation, that the prison had conspired with St. Mary’s Hospital to deprive him of his\n\n“basic human needs,” and that various supervisory employees at the prison were liable for\n\n\n\n   4\n    Laufgas also named several fictitious parties as defendants.\n\n                                               4\n\fthe alleged constitutional violations under a theory of respondeat superior.\n\n       After discovery had been completed, the Passaic County defendants filed a motion\n\nfor summary judgment. On August 31, 2006, following oral argument, the District Court\n\nentered an order granting in part and denying in part the motion. Specifically, the District\n\nCourt dismissed with prejudice 13 of Laufgas’s 17 claims, but permitted four claims to\n\nproceed. (App. at pp. 3-25.) Soon thereafter, the District Court dismissed the St. Mary’s\n\ndefendants from the suit.5 (App. at pp. 29-33.)\n\n       On October 30, 2006, a jury trial commenced on Laufgas’s remaining claims,\n\nwhich appear to have been condensed into the following two issues: (1) whether the\n\nPassaic County defendants acted with deliberate indifference and deprived Laufgas of a\n\nspecial diet for his medical condition; (2) whether the Passaic County defendants\n\nseriously deprived Laufgas of basic human necessities while incarcerated. (Verdict\n\nSheet.) On November 8, 2006, following a four-day trial, the jury returned a verdict of\n\n“no cause for action” in favor of the defendants. The present appeal followed.\n\n                                             III.\n\n       A.     Claims Dismissed on Summary Judgment\n\n       Laufgas first appeals from the District Court’s August 31, 2006 summary\n\njudgment order dismissing the majority of his claims. In its opinion, the District Court\n\n\n\n   5\n    Laufgas does not refer to this order in his notice of appeal or otherwise challenge it in\nhis appellate brief. Accordingly, we will not review the District Court’s order dismissing\nthe St. Mary’s defendants from the case.\n\n                                              5\n\ffound that Laufgas failed to provide sufficient evidence to withstand summary judgment\n\non his claims that the Passaic County defendants violated his constitutional rights when\n\nthey: interfered with his access to the courts; exposed him to second-hand smoke; and\n\nhoused him with individuals from Arab countries and of Muslim faith. Next, the District\n\nCourt dismissed as frivolous Laufgas’s claims that the Passaic County defendants\n\nviolated his constitutional rights when they: failed to provide him two hot meals a day;\n\ndeprived him of his personal property; subjected him to an unwarranted psychiatric\n\nevaluation; precluded him from using pre-paid phone cards to telephone home; denied\n\nhim use of recreational facilities; and generally conspired with St. Mary’s Hospital to\n\ndeprive him of his constitutional rights. The District Court also dismissed Laufgas’s\n\nclaims for “ombudsman abuse,” “denial of request for indigent form,” and “superior\n\nrespondent” on the ground that they were not separate causes of action.\n\n       We review a District Court’s grant of summary judgment de novo. Pennsylvania\n\nCoal Ass’n v. Babbitt, 63 F.3d 231, 236 (3d Cir. 1995). Summary judgment is proper\n\nonly if it appears “that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the\n\nmoving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Carrasca\n\nv. Pomeroy, 313 F.3d 828, 832-33 (3d Cir. 2002). If a motion for summary judgment\n\ndemonstrates that no genuine issue of material fact exists, the nonmoving party must set\n\nforth specific facts showing a genuine material issue for trial and may not rest upon the\n\nmere allegations or denials of its pleadings. Connors v. Fawn Mining Corp., 30 F.3d 483,\n\n489 (3d Cir. 1994) (internal quotations omitted). We agree with the District Court’s\n\n                                              6\n\freasons for dismissing all of these claims, and will only summarize them here.\n\n       First, the District Court properly entered summary judgment against Laufgas on\n\nhis access to the courts claim. In the complaint, Laufgas alleged that he was unable to\n\nsubmit a timely brief in his pending habeas action because he was prevented from using\n\nthe law library, the library collection was “outdated,” he was denied use of his pre-paid\n\nphone card, and because the prison prevented him from receiving the paper and pencils\n\nthat a friend had mailed to him.6 According to Laufgas, this amounted to interference\n\nwith his constitutional right of access to the courts.\n\n       In order to survive summary judgment, however, Laufgas had to provide evidence\n\nthat he was actually injured by the Passaic County defendants’ alleged interference. See\n\nLewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 349-55 (1996). Actual injury can be demonstrated by\n\nshowing that the defendants’ action hindered the prisoner’s ability to pursue a legal claim.\n\nOliver v. Fauver, 118 F.3d 175, 177-78 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal quotations omitted).\n\nLaufgas failed to provide any evidence that Judge Bassler’s decision to dismiss Laufgas’s\n\nhabeas petition was impacted by the belated filing of Laufgas’s brief. To the contrary,\n\nJudge Bassler dismissed the petition because it wholly lacked merit. Therefore, we\n\nbelieve the District Court properly granted summary judgment on this claim.7\n\n\n   6\n   The District Court treated Laufgas’s mail censorship claim as part of his claim that he\nwas denied access to the courts.\n   7\n    The record shows that Laufgas was able to correspond with Judge Bassler throughout\nhis incarceration to complain of his inability to file his brief on time. Indeed, due to\nLaufgas’s complaints, Judge Bassler granted him an extension and then issued an order\n\n                                               7\n\f       We also agree with the District Court that Laufgas failed to provide a sufficient\n\nevidentiary basis on which a jury could find in his favor on his allegation that he had been\n\nharmfully exposed to second-hand cigarette smoke. In order to withstand summary\n\njudgment on this claim, Laufgas had to create a genuine issue of fact as to whether he was\n\nbeing exposed to dangerously high levels of environmental tobacco smoke, and whether\n\nprison authorities were deliberately indifferent to his exposure. See Helling v.\n\nMcKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 35-37 (1993). As the District Court found, Laufgas failed to\n\noffer any evidence to support either prong under Helling.\n\n       Next, we address Laufgas’s claim that his constitutional rights were violated when\n\nhe was housed with individuals from Arab countries and of Muslim faith. According to\n\nLaufgas, the Passaic County defendants deliberately deprived him of his constitutional\n\nrights when they placed him with “detainees from Arab and or Muslim Countries, in a\n\nhostile environment, since Plaintiff is a Jew and immigrated from Israel.” (Compl. at ¶\n\n305.) Although prison authorities may, in very limited circumstances, “take into account\n\nracial tensions in maintaining security, discipline, and good order in prisons and jails,”\n\nJohnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499, 506-07 (2005) (internal quotation omitted), Laufgas\n\nfailed to provide any evidence that the Passaic County defendants had reason to believe\n\nthat segregation was appropriate here. Therefore, we agree with the District Court that\n\nthe Passaic County defendants were entitled to summary judgment on this claim as well.\n\n\n\ndirecting the prison to permit him to use the law library.\n\n                                              8\n\f       We also agree with the District Court’s dismissal of Laufgas’s claim that the\n\nprison’s failure to provide two hot meals a day constituted a violation of his constitutional\n\nrights. As the District Court stated, while prisoners are guaranteed a nutritionally\n\nadequate diet under the Eighth Amendment, see Ramos v. Lamm, 639 F.2d 559, 571\n\n(10th Cir. 1980), there is no constitutional right to hot meals. See Brown-El v. Delo, 969\n\nF.2d 644, 648 (8th Cir. 1992) (finding frivolous prisoner’s claim that his constitutional\n\nrights were violated when he was served cold food).\n\n       Next, the District Court properly dismissed Laufgas’s claim that prison officials\n\nimpermissibly disposed of his personal property, as a prisoner’s cause of action based on\n\nunauthorized deprivation of property by a state actor is not actionable under section 1983\n\nunless there is no adequate post-deprivation remedy available. See Parratt v. Taylor, 451\n\nU.S. 527, 542 (1981), overruled on other grounds by Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327\n\n(1986). As noted by the District Court, Laufgas failed to show that a conversion claim\n\nunder state law would have provided an inadequate remedy.\n\n       The District Court also correctly concluded that the Passaic County defendants\n\nwere entitled to qualified immunity for their decision to take Laufgas to St. Mary’s\n\nHospital for a psychological evaluation. A government official is entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity if his “conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional\n\nrights of which a reasonable person would have known.” Berg v. County of Allegheny,\n\n219 F.3d 261, 272 (3d Cir. 2000) (internal quotations omitted). As the District Court\n\nnoted, Laufgas’s “indisputably strange behavior” gave prison officials ample reason to\n\n                                              9\n\frequest a psychiatric evaluation.\n\n       The District Court also properly dismissed Laufgas’s claim that he was deprived of\n\nbasic recreational facilities. The District Court concluded that although lack of physical\n\nexercise can, under certain circumstances, constitute a constitutional violation, see\n\nPeterkin v. Jeffes, 855 F.2d 1021, 1031-32 (3d Cir. 1988), Laufgas did not allege facts\n\nsufficient to make out a such a claim. Specifically, Laufgas failed to allege the amount of\n\nexercise in which he engaged, the extent to which the Passaic County defendants\n\nallegedly precluded exercise, or any specific physical injury resulting from lack of\n\nexercise. Therefore, we agree with the District Court.8\n\n       Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court’s entry of partial summary\n\njudgment in favor of the Passaic County defendants.\n\n       B.     Claims Dismissed Pursuant to Jury Verdict\n\n       In his appellate brief, Laufgas also challenges the jury’s verdict on his remaining\n\nclaims. Laufgas, however, fails to specify any points of error at the trial. Rather, he\n\nmerely re-argues the merits of his claims, and baldly states that the jury committed “plain\n\nerror.” Given that Laufgas fails to direct us to any errors, we have no reason to question\n\nthe jury’s verdict.\n\n                                            IV.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court’s order granting partial\n\n\n   8\n    As for Laufgas’s remaining claims, we have carefully reviewed the record and agree\nwith the District Court’s disposition of these claims.\n\n                                             10\n\fsummary judgment. We will also affirm the District Court’s entry of judgment on the\n\njury verdict.\n\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\f",

For the reasons that follow,\n\nwe will affirm.1\n\n                                              I.\n\n       This matter arises from Laufgas’s four-month incarceration at the Passaic County\n\nAdult Correctional Institution, where he was serving a sentence for contempt of court\n\nduring Chancery Division proceedings not relevant to the present appeal.2\n\n       Prior to his incarceration, Laufgas sent a letter to the Warden of the Passaic\n\nCounty jail to notify the prison of his special needs. In the letter, Laufgas provided his\n\nphysician’s name, listed his daily medications and dietary restrictions, and indicated that\n\nhe would need access to the prison law library. Laufgas further noted that, “[i]f for some\n\nreason you will deny me those basic Constitutional rights, I assure you, once I get out I\n\nwill institute legal action in the United States District Court against each of you, your\n\n\n\n   1\n    We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n   2\n   The full history of the underlying action is set forth in Amoresano v. Laufgas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2054510\"><a href=\"/opinion/2054510/amoresano-v-laufgas/\"><span class=\"volume\">796</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">164</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (N.J. 2002).\n\n                                              2\n\fdepartment, and Passaic County.” (Compl., at Ex. A.)\n\n       Laufgas’s sentence began on February 8, 2002. Immediately upon his arrival at\n\nthe Passaic County prison, Laufgas was dissatisfied with the conditions of his\n\nconfinement. His primary complaint was that the prison failed to provide him with meals\n\ntailored to his medical conditions; according to Laufgas, he could not tolerate salt, fried\n\nfoods, milk, eggs, coffee, or sugar. Because the Passaic County defendants failed to meet\n\nthese restrictions, Laufgas commenced a hunger and medication strike that lasted for\n\nseveral days. In the following weeks, Laufgas carried out two more hunger and\n\nmedication strikes. After Laufgas’s third strike, prison officials took Laufgas to St.\n\nMary’s Hospital for a psychiatric evaluation.3\n\n       Over the course of his incarceration, Laufgas lodged various additional complaints,\n\nincluding complaints about the law library, his prison cell, and his telephone access. In\n\nthe end, Laufgas filed approximately 150 Ombudsman Request Forms demanding various\n\npersonal items, privileges, or other treatment. Laufgas was released on April 14, 2002.\n\n                                             II.\n\n       On April 15, 2004, Laufgas filed a complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of New Jersey concerning the treatment he\n\nreceived at the Passaic County jail. The complaint named as defendants the following\n\nPassaic County employees: Jerry Speziale, Passaic County Sheriff; Charles S. Meyers,\n\n\n   3\n    Laufgas was temporarily transferred to the Ann Klein Forensic Center before he\nreturned to the Passaic County jail.\n\n                                              3\n\fprison warden; Brian S. Bendel, deputy warden; Officer Hector Hernandez; and Magdy\n\nWahba, Director and Head Physician (the “Passaic County defendants”). The complaint\n\nalso named as defendants St. Mary’s Hospital and two doctors at St. Mary’s Hospital’s\n\nPsychiatric Emergency Services (the “St. Mary’s defendants”).4\n\n       In the complaint, Laufgas first alleged that prison officials were deliberately\n\nindifferent to his needs by: failing to honor his dietary restrictions; failing to provide two\n\nhot meals a day; housing him in unsanitary conditions; denying him use of his pre-paid\n\nphone card; subjecting him to second-hand smoke; depriving him of recreational\n\nfacilities; depriving him of proper bedding; depriving him of a shower and clean clothing;\n\nand disposing of his personal belongings. Next, Laufgas alleged that his constitutional\n\nrights were violated when he—a Jewish individual—was housed with individuals from\n\nArab countries and of Muslim faith. Laufgas further alleged that he was deprived of his\n\nright of access to the courts because he was prevented from using the law library, the law\n\nlibrary was “outdated,” and he was denied use of his pre-paid phone card. In a related\n\nclaim, Laufgas alleged that his incoming mail was censored. Next, Laufgas stated claims\n\nfor “ombudsman abuse” and “denial of request for indigent status.” In his final three\n\nclaims, Laufgas alleged that he was forced to undergo an unwarranted psychiatric\n\nevaluation, that the prison had conspired with St. Mary’s Hospital to deprive him of his\n\n“basic human needs,” and that various supervisory employees at the prison were liable for\n\n\n\n   4\n    Laufgas also named several fictitious parties as defendants.\n\n                                               4\n\fthe alleged constitutional violations under a theory of respondeat superior.\n\n       After discovery had been completed, the Passaic County defendants filed a motion\n\nfor summary judgment. On August 31, 2006, following oral argument, the District Court\n\nentered an order granting in part and denying in part the motion. Specifically, the District\n\nCourt dismissed with prejudice 13 of Laufgas’s 17 claims, but permitted four claims to\n\nproceed. (App. at pp. 3-25.) Soon thereafter, the District Court dismissed the St. Mary’s\n\ndefendants from the suit.5 (App. at pp. 29-33.)\n\n       On October 30, 2006, a jury trial commenced on Laufgas’s remaining claims,\n\nwhich appear to have been condensed into the following two issues: (1) whether the\n\nPassaic County defendants acted with deliberate indifference and deprived Laufgas of a\n\nspecial diet for his medical condition; (2) whether the Passaic County defendants\n\nseriously deprived Laufgas of basic human necessities while incarcerated. (Verdict\n\nSheet.) On November 8, 2006, following a four-day trial, the jury returned a verdict of\n\n“no cause for action” in favor of the defendants. The present appeal followed.\n\n                                             III.\n\n       A.     Claims Dismissed on Summary Judgment\n\n       Laufgas first appeals from the District Court’s August 31, 2006 summary\n\njudgment order dismissing the majority of his claims. In its opinion, the District Court\n\n\n\n   5\n    Laufgas does not refer to this order in his notice of appeal or otherwise challenge it in\nhis appellate brief. Accordingly, we will not review the District Court’s order dismissing\nthe St. Mary’s defendants from the case.\n\n                                              5\n\ffound that Laufgas failed to provide sufficient evidence to withstand summary judgment\n\non his claims that the Passaic County defendants violated his constitutional rights when\n\nthey: interfered with his access to the courts; exposed him to second-hand smoke; and\n\nhoused him with individuals from Arab countries and of Muslim faith. Next, the District\n\nCourt dismissed as frivolous Laufgas’s claims that the Passaic County defendants\n\nviolated his constitutional rights when they: failed to provide him two hot meals a day;\n\ndeprived him of his personal property; subjected him to an unwarranted psychiatric\n\nevaluation; precluded him from using pre-paid phone cards to telephone home; denied\n\nhim use of recreational facilities; and generally conspired with St. Mary’s Hospital to\n\ndeprive him of his constitutional rights. The District Court also dismissed Laufgas’s\n\nclaims for “ombudsman abuse,” “denial of request for indigent form,” and “superior\n\nrespondent” on the ground that they were not separate causes of action.\n\n       We review a District Court’s grant of summary judgment de novo.

Summary judgment is proper\n\nonly if it appears “that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the\n\nmoving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Carrasca\n\nv. Pomeroy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780178\"><a href=\"/opinion/780178/marco-antonio-carrasca-fidel-figueroa-abimael-figueroa-rigoberto-vales/\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">828</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 832-33 (3d Cir. 2002). If a motion for summary judgment\n\ndemonstrates that no genuine issue of material fact exists, the nonmoving party must set\n\nforth specific facts showing a genuine material issue for trial and may not rest upon the\n\nmere allegations or denials of its pleadings. Connors v. Fawn Mining Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"675115\"><a href=\"/opinion/675115/no-93-3301/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n489 (3d Cir. 1994) (internal quotations omitted). We agree with the District Court’s\n\n                                              6\n\freasons for dismissing all of these claims, and will only summarize them here.\n\n       First, the District Court properly entered summary judgment against Laufgas on\n\nhis access to the courts claim. In the complaint, Laufgas alleged that he was unable to\n\nsubmit a timely brief in his pending habeas action because he was prevented from using\n\nthe law library, the library collection was “outdated,” he was denied use of his pre-paid\n\nphone card, and because the prison prevented him from receiving the paper and pencils\n\nthat a friend had mailed to him.6 According to Laufgas, this amounted to interference\n\nwith his constitutional right of access to the courts.\n\n       In order to survive summary judgment, however, Laufgas had to provide evidence\n\nthat he was actually injured by the Passaic County defendants’ alleged interference. See\n\nLewis v. Casey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118054\"><a href=\"/opinion/118054/lewis-v-casey/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 349-55 (1996). Actual injury can be demonstrated by\n\nshowing that the defendants’ action hindered the prisoner’s ability to pursue a legal claim.\n\nOliver v. Fauver, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"743496\"><a href=\"/opinion/743496/lorenzo-oliver-v-william-fauver-commissioner-of-department-of-corrections/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">175</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 177-78 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal quotations omitted).\n\nLaufgas failed to provide any evidence that Judge Bassler’s decision to dismiss Laufgas’s\n\nhabeas petition was impacted by the belated filing of Laufgas’s brief. To the contrary,\n\nJudge Bassler dismissed the petition because it wholly lacked merit. Therefore, we\n\nbelieve the District Court properly granted summary judgment on this claim.7\n\n\n   6\n   The District Court treated Laufgas’s mail censorship claim as part of his claim that he\nwas denied access to the courts.\n   7\n    The record shows that Laufgas was able to correspond with Judge Bassler throughout\nhis incarceration to complain of his inability to file his brief on time. Indeed, due to\nLaufgas’s complaints, Judge Bassler granted him an extension and then issued an order\n\n                                               7\n\f       We also agree with the District Court that Laufgas failed to provide a sufficient\n\nevidentiary basis on which a jury could find in his favor on his allegation that he had been\n\nharmfully exposed to second-hand cigarette smoke. In order to withstand summary\n\njudgment on this claim, Laufgas had to create a genuine issue of fact as to whether he was\n\nbeing exposed to dangerously high levels of environmental tobacco smoke, and whether\n\nprison authorities were deliberately indifferent to his exposure. See Helling v.\n\nMcKinney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112888\"><a href=\"/opinion/112888/helling-v-mckinney/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 35-37 (1993). As the District Court found, Laufgas failed to\n\noffer any evidence to support either prong under Helling.\n\n       Next, we address Laufgas’s claim that his constitutional rights were violated when\n\nhe was housed with individuals from Arab countries and of Muslim faith. According to\n\nLaufgas, the Passaic County defendants deliberately deprived him of his constitutional\n\nrights when they placed him with “detainees from Arab and or Muslim Countries, in a\n\nhostile environment, since Plaintiff is a Jew and immigrated from Israel.” (Compl. at ¶\n\n305.) Although prison authorities may, in very limited circumstances, “take into account\n\nracial tensions in maintaining security, discipline, and good order in prisons and jails,”\n\nJohnson v. California, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137748\"><a href=\"/opinion/137748/johnson-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 506-07 (2005) (internal quotation omitted), Laufgas\n\nfailed to provide any evidence that the Passaic County defendants had reason to believe\n\nthat segregation was appropriate here. Therefore, we agree with the District Court that\n\nthe Passaic County defendants were entitled to summary judgment on this claim as well.\n\n\n\ndirecting the prison to permit him to use the law library.\n\n                                              8\n\f       We also agree with the District Court’s dismissal of Laufgas’s claim that the\n\nprison’s failure to provide two hot meals a day constituted a violation of his constitutional\n\nrights. As the District Court stated, while prisoners are guaranteed a nutritionally\n\nadequate diet under the Eighth Amendment, see Ramos v. Lamm, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">639</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">559</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 571\n\n(10th Cir. 1980), there is no constitutional right to hot meals. See Brown-El v. Delo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586948\"><a href=\"/opinion/586948/keith-brown-el-v-paul-k-delo-donald-roper-larry-scott-james/\"><span class=\"volume\">969</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">644</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 648 (8th Cir. 1992) (finding frivolous prisoner’s claim that his constitutional\n\nrights were violated when he was served cold food).\n\n       Next, the District Court properly dismissed Laufgas’s claim that prison officials\n\nimpermissibly disposed of his personal property, as a prisoner’s cause of action based on\n\nunauthorized deprivation of property by a state actor is not actionable under section 1983\n\nunless there is no adequate post-deprivation remedy available. See Parratt v. Taylor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110478\"><a href=\"/opinion/110478/parratt-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 542 (1981), overruled on other grounds by Daniels v.

As noted by the District Court, Laufgas failed to show that a conversion claim\n\nunder state law would have provided an inadequate remedy.\n\n       The District Court also correctly concluded that the Passaic County defendants\n\nwere entitled to qualified immunity for their decision to take Laufgas to St. Mary’s\n\nHospital for a psychological evaluation. A government official is entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity if his “conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional\n\nrights of which a reasonable person would have known.” Berg v. County of Allegheny,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769512\"><a href=\"/opinion/769512/raymond-a-berg-jr-v-county-of-allegheny-allegheny-county-adult/\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">261</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 272 (3d Cir. 2000) (internal quotations omitted). As the District Court\n\nnoted, Laufgas’s “indisputably strange behavior” gave prison officials ample reason to\n\n                                              9\n\frequest a psychiatric evaluation.\n\n       The District Court also properly dismissed Laufgas’s claim that he was deprived of\n\nbasic recreational facilities. The District Court concluded that although lack of physical\n\nexercise can, under certain circumstances, constitute a constitutional violation, see\n\nPeterkin v. Jeffes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"510971\"><a href=\"/opinion/510971/peterkin-otis-h-albrecht-alfred-f-truesdale-mack-maxwell-frederick/\"><span class=\"volume\">855</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1021</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1031-32 (3d Cir. 1988), Laufgas did not allege facts\n\nsufficient to make out a such a claim. Specifically, Laufgas failed to allege the amount of\n\nexercise in which he engaged, the extent to which the Passaic County defendants\n\nallegedly precluded exercise, or any specific physical injury resulting from lack of\n\nexercise. Therefore, we agree with the District Court.8\n\n       Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court’s entry of partial summary\n\njudgment in favor of the Passaic County defendants.\n\n       B.     Claims Dismissed Pursuant to Jury Verdict\n\n       In his appellate brief, Laufgas also challenges the jury’s verdict on his remaining\n\nclaims. Laufgas, however, fails to specify any points of error at the trial. Rather, he\n\nmerely re-argues the merits of his claims, and baldly states that the jury committed “plain\n\nerror.” Given that Laufgas fails to direct us to any errors, we have no reason to question\n\nthe jury’s verdict.\n\n                                            IV.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court’s order granting partial\n\n\n   8\n    As for Laufgas’s remaining claims, we have carefully reviewed the record and agree\nwith the District Court’s disposition of these claims.\n\n                                             10\n\fsummary judgment. We will also affirm the District Court’s entry of judgment on the\n\njury verdict.\n\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\f</pre>",
