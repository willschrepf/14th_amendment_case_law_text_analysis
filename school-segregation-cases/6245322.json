Marks\n\nWebb, James Berl Marks, Linda Murray, Thomas Wayne Marks, Donald Leman Whited,\n\nMichael Ray Whited, Terry Lee Whited and Sherry Lynn Whited Salsbury (collectively \"Third\n\nParty Defendants\"). Having considered the Motion, the response thereto, the admissible\n\nevidence, the other papers on file in this matter, and the arguments of counsel, the Court hereby\n\nGRANTS the Motion in part and makes the following findings and orders:\n\n       The Court finds that attorney William J. Brotherton violated Texas Civil Practices and\n\nRemedies Code Chapter 10 in signing the Original Petition in Intervention, the First Amended\n\n                                                1\n                                                                          EXHIBIT\n                                                                              1\n\f Case 2:16-cv-09951 Document 34-1 Filed 02/14/17 Page 2 of 3 PageID #: 2105\n\n                                      No. C-1-PB-16-002348\n\n\nPetition in Intervention and Third Party Petition, Second Amended Petition in Intervention and\n\nThird Party Petition, the Third Amended Petition in Intervention and Third Party Petition, and\n\nthe Fourth Petition in Intervention filed in this matter. In particular, the Court finds that Mr.\n\nBrotherton violated Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code § 10.001 by signing these\n\npleadings because each of them contained the claim that Deborah Cortez was entitled to all\n\nassets from The William D. Short and Phyllis D. Short Revocable Living Trust (the \"Trust\")\n\nupon the death of Phyllis Short because Deborah was over the age of 35 when Ms. Short died.\n\nThe Court finds that the plain language of the Trust foreclosed such a claim and that this claim\n\nwas not warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for the extension, modification,\n\nor reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.\n\n       The Court further finds that attorney William J. Brotherton should have known that as of\n\nSeptember 16, 2016, his legal position regarding postponement of the trust was untenable. By\n\nmaintaining that legal position in his Fourth Petition in Intervention, he caused the Third Party\n\nDefendants to incur additional attorneys' fees in responding to attorney William J. Brotherton' s\n\nclaim regarding postponement of the trust.\n\n       The Court hereby sanctions William J. Brotherton and the Brotherton Law Firm, jointly\n\nand severally, in the amount of $31,150.76 for fees incurred for work done by Brian Thompson\n\nand his associates at Hopper Mikeska, PLLC and $33,980.00 for fees incurred by Aaron Boone\n\nand his associate attorney at Bowles Rice, LLP, for a total of $65,130.76. The Court orders that\n\nthis amount be paid to the Third Party Defendants within 30 days of the entry of this order. The\n\nCourt finds that there is a direct relationship between the sanctions being imposed and Mr.\n\nBrotherton's sanctionable conduct, in that the aforesaid amount represents reasonable and\n\nnecessary attorneys' fees expended by attorneys for the Third Part Defendants to defend against\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f Case 2:16-cv-09951 Document 34-1 Filed 02/14/17 Page 3 of 3 PageID #: 2106\n\n                                     No. C-1-PB-16-002348\n\n\nthe frivolous claims advanced by William J. Brotherton and the Brotherton Law Firm; that the\n\nsanctions are not excessive; and that these sanctions will appropriately deter other attorneys from\n\nsigning pleadings containing claims that violate Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code\n\nChapter 10.\n\n       The Court hereby modifies its judgment entered on December 19, 2016, to include this\n\naward of sanctions.\n\n       Signed this 10th day of February, 2017.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f Case 2:16-cv-09951 Document 34-2 Filed 02/14/17 Page 1 of 2 PageID #: 2107\n\n\n\n\n                                CAUSE NO.

After considering the Motion for Summary Judgment, the response,\n\nall admissible summary judgment evidence, the arguments of counsel, and the other papers on\n\nfile with the Court, the Court GRANTED the_ Motion for Summary Judgment in its entirety and\n\nORDERED, that Mateo Cortez's claims against Third Party Defendants be dismissed in their\n\nentirety. In particular, the Court dismissed any and all claims that Mateo Cortez, in his individual\n                                                 1\n                                                                           EXHIBIT\n                                                                                2\n\f Case 2:16-cv-09951 Document 34-2 Filed 02/14/17 Page 2 of 2 PageID #: 2108\n\n\n\n\ncapacity or in his capacity as personal representative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez, had to any\n\nassets of T he William D.

After considering the Motion to Sever, the response, the arguments of counsel, and the\n\nother papers on file with the Court, the Court GRANTED the Motion to Sever in its entirety and\n\nORDERED that Mateo Corez's claims against Third Party Defendants in this lawsuit be severed\n\nin their entirety and assigned the new cause number C-1-PB-1 6-002348.\n\n        On January 16, 20 17, Third Party Defendants filed their Motion to Modify Judgment to\n\nInclude Sanctions Award (the \" Motion to Modify\"), which extended the plenary power of the\n\nCourt to modify its judgment.

Short\n\n    and Phyllis D. Short Revocable Living Trust dated April 30, 1991 (the ''Trust'~. and to drive up\n\n    the costs of this litigation for the Trust's true beneficiaries. Cortez's motion should be denied. and\n\n    his counsel should be sanctioned for knowingly filing frivolous papers with this Court.\n\n\n                                             INTRODUCTION\n\n                     Cortez was the husband of Deborah Cortez (nee Short), and is her sole heir at law\n\n   and the administrator of her estate. Cortez has been a party to this case since November 10, 2015\n\n   (the date of filing), but made zero effort to join \"the Estate of Deborah Cortez'• as a party, or to\n\n   suggest that it should be made a party, until after this Court granted summary judgment against\n\f, Jun/23/2017 2:09:06 PM                              Bowles Rice 3044205587                                            3/23\n\n\n\n\n      him on September 15, 2016. 1 At all times, Cortez had actual knowledge of this case and sole\n\n     control over \"the Estate of Deborah Cortez\" as its administrator, and was represented by the same\n\n     lawyers who now seek to appear and re~litigate this case on behalf of \"the Estate of Deborah\n\n     Cortez.\" Indeed, both before this Court and the Texas court, Cortez argued prior to judgment that\n\n     the entirety of the Trust belongs to him personally as the sole heir of his late wife. Now, nine\n\n     months after this Court granted summary judgment against him1 and two weeks before the Court\n\n     talces up the Trustee's motion to distribute the Trust to its rightful beneficiaries! Cortez attempts\n\n     to reargue the same baseless claims that this Court and the Texas court both rejected.\n\n\n                        Of course, as this Court ruled in its September 15, 2016 order granting partial\n\n     summary judgment, neither Cortez nor \"the Estate of Deborah Cortez\" have any interest in the\n\n     Trust. By the plain language of the Trust instrument, Deborah Cortez only had an interest in the\n\n     Trust during her life, and that interest extinguished upon her death. The Trust assets now belong\n\n     to the heirs at law of William D. Short and Phyllis D. Short; Cortez and ''the Estate of Deborah\n\n     Cortez\" are not heirs at law of either settlor, and have zero interest in the Trust. Both this Court\n\n     and the Texas court reached this conclusion as a matter of law.\n\n\n                        On December 19, 2016, the Texas court also granted summary judgment against\n\n     Cortez on all of his claims, concluding as a matter of law that Cortez and \"the Estate of Deborah\n\n     Cortez)j have zero interest in the Trust:\n\n\n\n\n              1 Cortez moved to alter or amend the  Court's judgment, arguing in part that the Court failed to join \"the Estate\n     of Deborah Cortez\" as an indispensable party. Cortez failed to raise this defense prior to judgment, and thus waived\n     it. See W.Va. R. Civ. P. l2(h)(2) (stating that defense offailure to join an indispensable party may only be made \"in\n     any pleading permitted or ordered under Rule 7(a), or by motion for judgment on the pleadings, or at the trial on the\n     merits.\"). In any event, Cortez's interests and \"the Estate of Deborah Corte:t's\" interests are identical, so ''the Estate\"\n     was neither necessary nor indispensable to this case.\n\n\n                                                                 2\n\fJun/23/2017 2:09:06 PM                      Bowles Rice 3044205587                            4/23\n\n\n\n\n                   On this day, the Court considered the Traditional and No Evidence\n                   Motion for Summary Judgment (the \"Motion\") filed by Third Party\n                   Defendants . . . Connie [Lou] Keith Barry ... all in their individual\n                   capacities. Having considered the Motion, the response, all\n                   admissible summary judgment evidence, the arguments of counsel,\n                   and the other papers on file with the Court, the Court hereby\n                   GRANTS the Motion in its entirety.\n\n                    It is therefore, ORDERED, that Mateo Cortez's claims against Third\n                    Party Defendants in this lawsuit are dismissed in their entirety. In\n                    particular, tlie Court liereby dismisses any and all claims that\n                   Mateo Cortez, in Ids indlvidugl cqpacitv or in his cgpacitv as\n                   l!,,r,rsonal representative ofthe Estate o[.Deborali Cortez. has to any\n                    assets of The William D. Short and Phyllis D. Short Revocable\n                   Living Trust (the \"Trust,,), other than his claim for undistributed\n                    income from the Trust during the life of Deborah Cortez. This\n                   judgment has no effect on Mateo Cortez's breach of fiduciary duty\n                   against Linda Murray, in her capacity as trustee of the Trust.\n\n   Exhibit A, Order Granting Third Party Defendants' Traditional and No Evidence Motion for\n\n   Summary Judgment, Civil Action No. C-l·OB~14~1564 (Tex. Probate Ct. Dec. 19, 2016)\n\n   (emphasis added). The Texas court subsequently amended its judgment to include sanctions\n\n   against Cortez's lawyers, finding that Cortez's argument that \"the Estate of Deborah Cortez', was\n\n   entitled to the assets of the Trust was frivolous:\n\n\n                  The Court finds that attorney William J. Brotherton violated Texas\n                  Civil Practices and Remedies Code Chapter 10 in signing the\n                  Original Petition in Intervention [and subsequent pleadingsJ filed in\n                  this matter. In particular, the Court finds that Mr. Brotherton\n                  violated Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code§ 10.001 by\n                  signing these pleadings because eac/1 of them contained the claim\n                  that Debora/, Cortez was entitled to all assets from [the Trust).\n                  1hr Court finds that the plain language of tlie Trmt fQredg$_ed\n                  such a claim and that this claim was not warranted by existing law\n                  or by a non-frivolous argument for the extension, modification, or\n                  reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.\n\n                  The Court further finds that William J. Brotherton should have\n                  known that as of September 16, 2016, his legal position regarding\n                  postponement of the trust was untenable ....\n\n\n\n\n                                                        3\n\f, Jun/23/2017 2:09:06 PM                     Bowles Rice 3044205587                                   5/23\n\n\n\n\n     Exhihit B, Order on Third Parr; Defendants' Motion to Modify Judgment to Include Sanctions\n\n     Award, Civil Action No. C~l~OB-14-1564 (Tex. Probate Ct. Feb, 10, 2017) (emphasis added).\n     The Texas court sanctioned Cortez's lawyers in the amount of $65,130.76 for driving up Mrs.\n\n     Barrf s legal fees in Texas with his frivolous claims.\n\n\n                    Although Cortez seeks to \"intervene\" on behalf' 1ofthe Estate of Deborah Cortez,\"\n\n     in reality he seeks to hide behind a nominal party to avoid this Court's judgment, and to reargue\n\n     in West Virginia the same ridiculous and insupportable legal theories that led to sanctions against\n\n     his lawyers in Texas. The Court should deny Cortez's motion (and all of his other frivolous claims\n\n     for relief), and sanction his counsel for wasting the Court's time and the parties' resources.\n\n                                                 ARGUMENT\n\n     A.      CORTEZ'S ATTEMPT TO i 41NTERVENE ON BEHALF OF THE ESTATE OF\n             DEBORAH CORTEZ\" SHOULD BE DENIED.\n\n                    Cortez's motion to intervene is frivolous and should be denied. Rule 24 of the West\n\n     Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure states:\n\n\n                    (a) Intervention of Right. Upon timely application anyone shall be\n                    permitted to intervene in an action: (1) when a statute of this State\n                    confers an unconditional right to intervene; or (2) when the applicant\n                    claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the\n                    subject of the action and the applicant is so situated that the\n                    disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede\n                    the applicant's ability to protect that interest, unless the applicant's\n                    interest is adequately represented by existing parties.\n\n     W.Va. R. Civ. P. 24. \"West Virginia Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2) allows intervention of right\n\n     in an action if an applicant meets four conditions: (1) the application must be timely; (2) the\n\n     applicant must claim an interest relating to the property or transaction whlch is the subject of the\n\n     action; (3) disposition of the action may. as a practical matter. impair or impede the applicant's\n\n\n                                                       4\n\fJun/23/2017 2:09:06 PM                     Bowles Rice 3044205587                                  6/23\n\n\n\n\n    ability to protect that interest; and (4) the applicant must show that the interest will not be\n\n    adequately represented by existing parties.\" Syl. Pt. 2, State ex rel. Ball v. Cummings. 208 W.Va.\n\n    393,540 S.E.2d 917 (1999). For obvious reasons, Cortez cannot meet a single one of these criteria.\n\n\n                   First, Cortez's motion is untimely. \"While Rule 24 of the West Virginia Rules of\n\n    Civil Procedure provides for the intervention of parties upon a timely application, the timeliness\n\n   of any intervention is a matter of discretion with the trial court.\" Syl. Pt. 3, State ex rel. Ball v,\n\n   Cummings, 208 W.Va. 393,540 S.E.2d 917 (1999). Cortez had actual notice of this suit in 2015,\n\n   and knew or should have known at that time that he needed to \"intervene on behalf of the Estate\n\n   of Deborah Cortez\" if he or his lawyers believed \"the Estate\" had an interest in this litigation.\n\n   Instead, Cortez fought this case on other grounds, and specifically argued that he was personally\n\n   entitled to the proceeds from the Trust. Cortez did not move to \"intervene on behalf of the Estate\"\n\n   until nine months after this Court rejected his claim to the Trust and granted summary judgment\n\n   against him. The Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia has upheld refusals to grant\n\n   intervention where the movant had knowledge of a case but failed to move for intervention until\n\n   after entry ofjudgment. See West Virginia Public Employees Ins. Bd. v. Blue Cross Hosp. Service,\n\n   Inc .• 180 W.Va. 177, 375 S.E.2d 809 (1988) (motion to intervene untimely when filed three months\n\n   after entry of dismissal order and movants knew or had reason to know of the pendency of the\n\n   action prior to judgment); Pauley v. Bailey, 171 W.Va. 651, 301 S.E.2d 608 (1983) (permissive\n\n   intervention) (motion to intervene untimely when filed almost one year after evidentiary hearings\n\n   had closed and seven months after court's orders). This Court should similarly deny Cortez's\n\n   motion as untimely.\n\n\n                  Next, \"the Estate of Debot'ah Cortez\" has absolutely no interest in the Trust. Under\n\n   the second and third pro11gs of Rule 24(a)(2), the movant must demonstrate both \"an interest\n\n\n                                                     5\n\fJun/23/2017 2:09:06 PM                      Bowles Rice 3044205587                                  7/23\n\n\n\n\n    relating to the property ... which is the subject of the action\" and that disposition of the action may\n\n    \"impair or impede the applicanf s ability to protect that intel'est.\" W.Va. R. Civ. P. 24. Mrs. Barry\n\n    will not belabor points which have already been established by this Court and the Texas court as a\n                    0\n    matter of law. The Estate of Deborah Cortez\" has no interest in the Trust because the plain and\n\n    unambiguous language of the Trust instrument affords no interest to Deborah Cortez upon her\n\n   death. Deborah Cortez only possessed a life interest in the Trust income, which extinguished when\n\n   she died. The disposition of this action will not impair the ability of\"the Estate of Deborah Cortez\"\n\n   to protect its interest in the Trust because \"the Estate of Deborah Cortez\" has no interest to protect.\n\n   This Court has already ruled on that issue and need not revisit it.\n\n\n                   Finally, \"the Estate of Deborah Cortez\" was adequately represented in this litigation\n\n   by Cortez himself, who is the administi·ator and sole heir of the estate. As to adequacy of\n\n   representation by existing parties, \"generally courts compare the interests asserted by the proposed\n\n   intervenor with the interests of the existing party. If the proposed intervenor's interest is not\n\n   represented by the existing party, or the existing party's interests are adverse to those of the\n\n   proposed intervenor, intervention should be granted.... [However], if the interests are identical,\n\n   intervention should be denied unless there is a compelling showing as to why the existing\n\n   representation is inadequate.\" State ex rel. Ball v. Cummings, 208 W.Va. 393,403, 540 S.E.2d\n\n   917, 927 (1999) (internal citations omitted). Cortez and \"the Estate of Deborah Cortez\" have\n\n   identical interests in the Trust (zero) and identical interests in this litigation: they both seek to\n\n   obtain the entirety of the Trust proceeds, either through direct distribution to Cortez personally or\n\n   through distribution to ''the Estate of Deborah Cortez,\" which would then flow through to Cortez\n\n   personally as its sole heir. Cortez and \"the Estate's\" ider1tity of interest is clear from the simple\n\n   fact that Cortez controls every decision made by \"the Estate of Deborah Cortez,\" and is the only\n\n\n\n                                                      6\n\fJun/23/2017 2:09:06 PM                       Bowles Rice 3044205587                              8/23\n\n\n\n\n    person that benefits from \"the Estate.\" Indeeds Cortez and \"the Estate of Deborah Cortez,, 9!!\n\n    represented by the same ler,al counsel in this case, which would violate the West Virginia Rules\n\n    of Professional Conduct if their interests were adverse in any way. See W.Va. R. Prof. Conduct\n\n    § 1.7 (simultaneous representation of adverse parties in litigation is a non.waivable conflict of\n\n    interest). \"The Estate of Deborah Cortez\" cannot deny that Cortez himself, as the administrator\n\n    and sole heir, had every opportunity to represent its claimed interest in this litigation.\n\n\n   B.      THE COURT SHOULD SANCTION CORTEZ'S COUNSEL FOR ATTEMPTING\n           TO OBSTRUCT THIS CASE WITH FRIVOLOUS FILINGS.\n\n                   Although Cortez ostensibly seeks to protect the interests of \"the Estate of Deborah\n\n   Cortez/' both this Court and the Texas court have already rejected Cortez's claim that the Trust\n\n   should have terminated, passed to Deborah Cmtez, and ultimately inherited by Cortez personally\n\n   as the sole beneficiary of \"the Estate of Deborah Cortez.\" Exhibit A. In fact, the Texas court\n\n   futther found in February of2017 that Cortez's claim was frivolous and sanctionable. Exliibit B.\n\n                   The truth is that Cortez only filed his most recent round of West Virginia motions\n\n   to obstruct or delay the Court's upcoming hearing on the Trustee's motion for summary judgment.\n\n   Cortez's filings are clearly frivolous, and his attorneys should be sanctioned in West Virginia for\n\n   the same reasons they were sanctioned in Texas. HThere is authority in equity to award to the\n\n   prevailing litigant his or her reasonable attorney's fees as 'costs/ without express statutory\n\n   authorization, when the losing party has acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly or for oppressive\n\n   reasons.''

Yokum, 179 W.Va. 48,365 S.E.2d 246 (1986).\n\n\n                   Parties whose interest in the legal process is to oppress or cheat\n                   othe1·s should be discouraged. Non-disputes should, of course, be\n                   filtered out of the legal process by the subjective decision of the\n                   litigants themselves or else by thefr attorneys.

Mrs. Barry fully intends to\n   seek recovery of all her attorneys' fees and costs in this action as a result of Cortez's frivolous and vexatious conduct,\n   which inc]udes not only filing frivolous claims to the Trust proceeds, but also improvidently removing the case to\n   federal court to create additional delay, and filing additional frivolous motions to prevent the Court from reaching the\n   merits of the Trustee's summary judgment motion.\n\n\n                                                               8\n\fJun/23/2017 2:09:06 PM                     Bowles Rice 3044205587                              10/23\n\n\n\n\n    distribution of the Trust to its rightful beneficiaries. The true purpose of Cortez's motion is\n\n    obvious: Cortez hopes to delay or obstruct the Court's disposition of the Trustee's summary\n\n   judgment motion by arguing that the Court must first rule on his new filings.\n\n\n                   Indeed, Cortez's lawyers made no effort to conceal the improper purpose of his\n\n   filings. By letter dated June 15, 2017, Cortez's counsel specifically requested that the Trustee\n\n   reschedule the upcoming hearing on her summary judgment motion in light of Cortez's new\n\n   filings:\n\n\n                  I called your office yesterday to confer regarding whether or not you\n                  and your clients wished to consider scheduling our motion to\n                  intervene and motion to dismiss for the 27th and reschedule the\n                  motion for summary judgment after the court has ruled on our\n                  motions. That would appear to be the best process for judicial\n                  economy.\n\n   Exltlbit C, Letter dated June 15, 2017 from William J. Brotherton to Robert S. Fluharty, Jr. This\n\n   Court and the Texas court have already rejected Cortez's position. His remedy under the law is to\n\n   take an appeal of those decisions. Instead, Cortez continues to present frivolous filings, with the\n\n   stated purpose of delaying this Court's consideration of the Trustee's summary judgment motion.\n\n   Cortez's conduct smacks of bad faith, and the Court has inherent equitable authority under Sally-\n\n   Mike Properties, and sua sponte authority under Rule ll(c)(l)(B), to sanction Cortez and his\n\n   lawyers for their wrongful conduct. Accordingly, Mrs. Bany requests that the Court award Mrs.\n\n   Barry and the Trustee all of their attorneys' fees and costs incurred in this action as a sanction\n\n   against Cortez and his lawyers for their conduct in obstructing this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    9\n\fJun/23/2017 2:09:06 PM   Bowles Rice 3044205587                               11/23\n\n\n\n\n                                      .._/4. .Q . b\n                                      Aaron C.

Having considered the Motion, the response thereto, the admissible\n\n       evidence, the other papers on file in this matter, and the arguments of counsel, the Court hereby\n\n       GRANTS the Motion in part and makes the following findings and orders:\n\n              The Court finds that attorney William J. Brotherton violated Texas Civil Practices and\n\n       Remedies Code Chapter 10 in signing the Original Petition in Intervention, the First Amended\n\n                                                         1         EXHIBIT\n                                                                        B\n\fJun/23/2017 2:09:06 PM                       Bowles Rice 3044205587                              15/23\n\n\n\n\n                                             No, C-1-PB-16-002348\n\n       Petition in Intervention and Third Party Petition, Second Amended Petition in Intervention and\n\n       Third Party Petition, the Third Amended Petition in Intervention and Third Party Petition, and\n\n       the Fourth Petition in Intervention filed in this matter. In particular, the Court finds that Mr.\n\n       Brotherton violated Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code § I 0.001 by signing these\n\n       pleadings because each of them contained the claim that Deborah Cortez was entitled to all\n\n       assets from The William D. Short and Phyllis D. Short Revocable Living Trost (the \"Trost\")\n\n       upon the death of Phyllis Short because Deborah was over the age of 35 when Ms. Short died.\n\n       The Court finds that the plain language of the Trust foreclosed such a claim and that this claim\n\n       was not warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for the extension, modification,\n\n       or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.\n\n              The Court further fmds that attorney William J. Brotherton should have known that as of\n\n       September 16, 2016, his legal position regarding postponement of the trust was untenable. By\n\n       maintaining that legal position in his Fourth Petition in Intervention, he caused the Third Party\n\n       Defendants to incur additional attorneys' fees in responding to attorney William J. Brotherton's\n\n       claim regarding postponement of the trust.\n\n              The Court hereby sanctions William J. Brotherton and the Brotherton Law Firm, jointly\n\n      and severally, in the amount of $31,150.76 for fees incutted for work done by Brian Thompson\n\n       and his associates at Hopper Mikeska, PLLC and $33,980.00 for fees incurred by Aaron Boone\n\n      and his associate attorney at Bowles Rice, LLP, for a total of $65,130.76.

Although presented\n                                                         11\n   as a motion to dismiss \"for lack of jurisdiction'' or failure to state a claim,\" Cortez has simply\n\n   repackaged the same forum non conveniens arguments that this Court and the Supreme Court of\n\n   Appeals of West Virginia rejected last year. Indeed, the Texas court has specifically stated that it\n\n   would not interfere with this Court•s jurisdiction: \"THE COURT: I'm not going to prohibit them\n\n   from proceeding, I'm not going to order them to dismiss in West Virginia. You all can go to\n\n   West Virginia and argue.\" First, Cortez lacks standing to assert a Rule 12(b) Motion to Dismiss\n\n   because judgment has already been entered against him. Second, notwithstanding his lack of\n\n   standing, Cortez's motion is based on the false premise that Texas is now administering the\n\fJun/23/2017 2:54:24 PM                     Bowles Rice 3044205587                                3/20\n\n\n\n\n    Trust. Lastly, given that the instant motion is frivolous, and filed solely to delay this Honorable\n\n    Court's efforts, sanctions should be assessed against Cortez's counsel.\n\n\n                                             ARGUMENT\n\n   A.      CORTEZ'S MOTION SHOULD BE DENIED BECAUSE POST-JUDGMENT\n           MOTIONS TO ABSTAJN ARE NOT PERMITTED BY THE RULES OF CIV1L\n           PROCEDURE.\n\n                  On September 15, 2016, this Court entered judgment against Cortez, dismissing\n\n   any and all claims that Cortez has to the Trust. Order Granting Motion for Partial Summary\n\n   Judgment, Wirt County Civil Action No. 15-C-28 (September 15, 2016). As discussed below,\n\n   Cortez's motion to dismiss seeks to re-litigate his argument that this Court should decline\n\n   jurisdiction in deference to parallel proceedi11gs in Tex.as. Cortez, however, has no legal right to\n\n   ask this court to abstain post~judgment. W.Va. R. Civ. P. 12(h) (defenses other than lack of\n\n   subject matter jurisdiction are waived unless raised prior to judgment).       Moreover, Cortez's\n\n   arguments are not only untenable, they are based on false and intentionally misleading premises.\n\n\n   B.     CORTEZ'S MOTION SHOULD BE DENIED BECAUSE THE TEXAS COURT IS\n          NOT ACTIVELY ADMINISTERING THE TRUST.\n\n                  Cortez bases his motion on the Princess Lida doctrine, which is not a\n\n   jurisdictional doctrine, but rather an abstention doctrine based on 75-year old dicta. See al-\n\n   Abood ex rel. Al-Abood v. El-Shamari, 217 F.3d 225 (4th Cir. 2000) (citing cases holding that\n\n   the Princess Lida doctrine is based on abstention and not lack of jurisdiction).          See also\n\n   Crawford v. Courtney, 451 F.2d 489, 491-92 (4th Cir. 1971) (describing the Princess Lida\n\n   doctrine as dicta).    Like forum non conveniens, abstention doctrines are not mandatory\n\n   jurisdictional limitations on a court; they are discretionary doctrines; grounded in equitable\n\n   concerns regarding comity between courts of concurrent jurisdiction.         See Quackenbush v.\n\n\n                                                    2\n\fJun/23/2017 2:54:24 PM                             Bowles Rice 3044205587                                          4/20\n\n\n\n\n   Allstate Ins. Co., S17 U.S. 706, 722 (1996) (abstention and forum non conveniens doctrines\n\n   proceed from the same premise that in rare circumstances, courts can relinquish their jurisdiction\n\n   in favor of another forum).\n\n\n                       The premise of Cortez's instant motion, and the premise of Cortez's earlier and\n\n   unsuccessful forum non conveniens motion, are identical. Cortez argues that a Texas court is\n\n   exercising concurrent jurisdiction over the parties• dispute, therefore this West Virginia Court\n\n   should \"step aside''. Cortez filed a \"Petition in Intervention\" in Texas on behalf of \"the Estate of\n\n   Deborah Cortez,\" in which he sought a declaratory judgment regarding the distribution of the\n\n   Trust assets. 1 Cortez, however, intentionally omitted from his motion to dismiss that: (1) no\n\n   other party asked the Texas court to decide how the Trust should be distributed or to assume\n\n   control over the Trusti and, more importantly, (2) the Texas court dismissed all of Cortez's\n\n   claims in their entirety.       The fact that no party other than Cortez asked the Texas court to\n\n   administer the Trust is critical because, on December 19, 2016, the Texas court granted summary\n\n   judgment against Cortez on all of the claims alleged in his \"Petition in Intervention,\" concluding\n\n   as a matter of law that Co1tez and 0 the Estate of Deborah Cortez\" have zero interest in the Trust:\n\n\n                       On this day, the Court considered the Traditional and No Evidence\n                       Motion for Summary Judgment (the ''Motion'•) filed by Third\n                       Party Defendants ... Connie [Lou) Keith Ban·y ... all in their\n                       individual capacities. Having considered the Motion, the response,\n                       all admissible summary judgment evidence, the arguments of\n                       counsel, and the other papers on file with the Court, the Court\n                       hereby GRANTS the Motion in its entirety.\n\n                       It is therefore, ORDERED, that Mateo Cortez's claims against\n                       Third Party Defendants in this lawsuit are dismissed in their\n                       entirety. In particular, the C9urt herebJ?, dismisses any and all\n\n           1 Corte2: filed his \"Petition in Intervention° to establish a defense against the Trustee's tort claims against\n  him for stealing from the Trust. Cortez has since pointed to his \"Petition in Intervention\" a.s the reason for why this\n  case should be dismissed and litigated in Texas.\n\n\n                                                             3\n\fJun/23/2017 2:54:24 PM                   Bowles Rice 3044205587                              5/20\n\n\n\n\n                  claims tl,at Mateo Corte;, in liis indi}!idual cagqcitv or in Ms\n                  capacity as personal representative of the Estate o( Debora/,\n                  Cortez, has to any assets of The William D. Short and Phyllis D.\n                  Short Revocable Living Trust (the \"Trust,'), other than his claim\n                  for undistributed income from the Trust during the life of Deborah\n                  Cortez. This judgment has no effect on Mateo Cortez's breach of\n                  fiduciary duty against Linda Murray, in her capacity as trustee of\n                  the Trust.\n\n   Exhibit A, Order Granting Third Party Defendants' Traditional and No Evidence Motion for\n\n   Summary Judgment, Civil Action No. C-1-0B-14-1564 (Tex. Probate Ct. Dec. 191 2016).\n\n\n                  Mol'eover, the Texas court subsequently amended its judgment to include\n\n   sanctions against Cortez's lawyers, finding that Cortez's claims were :frivolous and were not\n\n   warranted by existing law; the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law; or the\n\n   establishment of new law. Exhibit B, Order on Third Party Defendants' Motion to Modify\n\n   Judgment to Include Sanctions Awardi Civil Action No. C-1-0B-14-1564 (Tex. Probate Ct. Feb.\n\n   10, 2017). Pertinent to this motion, the Texas court found that sanctions were appropriate\n\n   because \"attorney William J. Brotherton should have known that as of September 16, 2016, his\n\n   legal position regarding postponement of the trust was untenable.\" Exhibit B. The date\n\n   referenced in the Texas court's sanction order is the day after this Cburt granted summary\n\n   judgment against Cortez, which proves that the Texas court agrees that the Trustee's claims\n\n   were properly brought in West Virginia. Otherwise, the Texas court obviously would not have\n\n   deferred to the findings in this Court's September 15~ 2016 order granting summary judgment.\n\n\n                  In sum, Cortez claims that the Princess Ltda doctrine applies and deprives this\n\n   Court of jurisdiction. Again, there is no claim before a Texas court to administer the Trust.\n\n   Even if Cortez's \"Petition in Intervention\" did implicate the Princess Lida doctrine, his claims\n\n   have been dismissed in their entirety, which undel' Texas law is final for collateral estoppel\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fJun/23/2017 2:54:24 PM                               Bowles Rice 3044205587                                            6/20\n\n\n\n\n    purposes irrespective of his right to appeal. See Scurlock Oil Co. v. Smithwick, 724 S.W.2d 1\n\n    (Tex. 1986) (judgment is final for purposes of issue and claim preclusion despite taking of\n\n    appeal). 2 Although Cortez claims that the Texas court has taken a number of steps to administer\n\n   the Trust, none of his claims are true. Neither the Trustee, nor any of the rightful beneficiaries of\n\n   the Trust, have asked the Texas court to detennine how the Trust should be distributed. That\n\n   claim is only pending here in West Virginia, and the Texas court has stated that it won't inte1fere\n\n   with this Court's adjudication of the issues before it: \"THE COURT: I'm not going to prohibit\n\n   them from proceeding, I'm not going to order them to dismiss in West Virginia. You all can go\n\n   to West Virginia and argue.\"                Exhibit C, Transcript Excerpt, Application for Temporary\n\n   Restraining Order and Injunctive Relief, at p. 25, Civil Action No. C-1-OB-14-1564 (Tex.\n\n   Probate Ct. Dec. 18, 2015). Accordingly, the Court should reject Cortez's arguments, and reject\n\n   his attempt to further delay and obstruct the Trustee's efforts to distribute the Trust to its rightful\n\n   beneficiaries.\n\n\n   C.       CORTEZ AND HIS LAWYERS SHouio BE SANCTIONED FOR FILING\n            FRIVOLOUS PAPERS TO OBSTRUCT OR DELAY THIS CASE.\n\n                      For the same reasons stated in Defendant Connie Lou Keith Barry's Response in\n\n   Opposition to Motion to Intervene and Request for Sanctions, Cortez and his lawyers should be\n\n   sanctioned for the filing of their Motion to Dismiss, which is frivolous and filed for the sole\n\n   purpose of delaying further action in this Court.\n\n                      DATED this 23ro day of June 2017.\n\n\n            2 The  Texas court's order granting summary judgment against Cortez meets the remaining elements of\n   collateral estoppel. The elements of collateral estoppel are that: \"(1) the facts sought to be litigated in the first action\n   were fully and fairly Jitigated in the prior action; (2) those facts were essential to the judgment in the first action; and\n   (3) the parties were cast as adversaries in the first action.\" Eagle Properties, Ltd v.

In particular) the Court finds that Mr.\n\n          Brotherton violated Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code § 10.001 by signing these\n\n          pleadings because each of them contained the claim that Doborah Cortez was entitled to all\n\n          assets ftom The William D. Short and Phyllis D. Short Revc,cable Living Trust {the 0 Trust\")\n\n          upon the death of Phyllis Short because Deborah was over the age of 35 when Ms. Short died.\n\n          The Court finds that the plain language of the Trust foreclosed such a claim and that this claim\n\n          was not warranted by existing law or by a non•mvolous argument for the extension, modification,\n\n          or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.\n\n                 The Court further finds that attomoy William J. Brotherton should have known that as of\n\n         September 16, 2016, his legal position regarding postponement of the trust was untenable. By\n\n         maintaining that legal position in his Fourth Petition in Intervention, he caused the Third Party\n\n         Defendants to incur additional attorneys' fees in responding to attorney William J. Brotherton's\n\n         claim regarding postponement of the trust.\n\n                 The Court hereby sanctions William J. Brotherton and the Brotherton Law Firm, jointly\n\n         and severally, in the amount of $31,150.76 for fees incurred for work done by Brian Thompson\n\n         and his associates at Hopper Mikeska, PLLC and $33,980.00 for fees incurred by Aaron Boone\n\n         and his associate attorney at Bowles Rice, LLP, for a total of $65,130.76. The Court orders that\n\n         this amount be paid to the Third Party Defendants within 30 days of the entry of this order.

SHORT\n               AND PHYLLIS D. SHORT REVOCABLE LIVING TRUST,\n                 TO THE MOTION TO INTERVENE FILED BY THE\n                        ESTATE OF DEBORAH CORTEZ\n\n\n              Comes now Linda Murray, in her capacity as Successor Trustee of the William D.\n\nShort and Phyllis D. Short Revocable Living Trust, and files her Response to the Estate of Deborah\n\nCortez' Motion to Intervene.\n\n              The Movant has filed a Motion to Intervene in the case at bar relying upon Rule\n\n24(a)(2) of the West Virginia Rules of Procedure. Rule 24(a)(2) provides:\n\n              (a) Intervention of Right- Upon timely application anyone shall\n              be permitted to intervene in an action: (2) when the applicant claims\n              an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject\n              of the action and the applicant is so situated that the adjudication of\n              the action may as a practicable matter impair or impede the\n              applicant's ability to protect that interest, unless the applicant's\n              interest is adequately represented by existing parties.\n\n              The timeliness of an application to intervene is a matter of discretion with the trial\n\ncourt. Syllabus Point 10, Pioneer Co. v. Hutchinson, 220 S.E.2d. 894 (1975), overruled on other\n\n                                                 1\n\fgrounds; Syllabus Point, West Virginia Public Employees Insurance Board v. Blue Cross Hospital\n\nService, Inc., 180 W.Va. 178 (1988). In the West Virginia Public Employees Insurance Board\n\ncase, the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals applied the same standard for review of the\n\ntimeliness of a motion to intervene as applied in Federal Court Review of such decisions.\n\n               \"The same standard has been applied in federal review of such\n               decisions. In NAACP v. State ofNew York, 413 U.S. 345, 93 S.Ct.\n               2591, 37 L.Ed. 2d. 648 (1973), the party moving to intervene filed\n               its motion just four days after the entry of the summary judgment\n               order, yet the United States Supreme Court affirmed the trial judge's\n               denial intervention. The court enumerated the criteria for\n               reviewing a trial judge's discretionary decision to deny motion to\n               intervene. Three areas were considered by the court: whether the\n               underlying action had progressed to a point that intervention would\n               substantially affect the parties to the original action; whether\n               unusual circumstances exist which establish that the interest the\n               movant alleges was inadequately protected; and whether the movant\n               knew or should have known of the pendency of the action.\"\n               NAACP, 413 U.S. at 366-69, 93 S.Ct. at 2602-04, 37 L.Ed. 2d. at\n               662-64, West Virginia Public Employees Insurance Board, supra, at\n               pg. 814.\n\n               Based upon review and analysis of the areas to be considered by this Court in ruling\n\nupon the pending motion, the motion should be denied for the following reasons:\n\n                                                  I.\n                       The Estate of Deborah Cortez bas no standing to\n                                Intervene in this civil action.\n\n               It is axiomatic that the \"Estate of Deborah Cortez\" is not a proper party to this\n\naction, has no right to intervene and properly not named as a party. Estates are not natural or\n\nartificial persons, and they lack legal capacity to sue or to be sued, an action against an estate must\n\nbe brought against an administrator or executor as a representative of the estate. 31 Am.Jur.2d,\n\nExecutors and Administrators.§ 1141 (2016) The Estate of Deborah Cortez is non sui juris, as\n\nsuch it lacks the legal capacity to intervene in this action. This principle is clearly recognized in\n\n                                                  2\n\f the proposed intervenor hails.\n\n                It is well settled that \"an 'Estate' is not an entity that can be a party to litigation. It\n\nis the personal representative of the estate, in a representative capacity, that is the proper party.\"\n\nGavishev. Spence, 129 S.W.Jd 701, 704n.l (Tex. App. 2004). Defendant's estate was not a legal\n\nentity and could not be sued as such. Henson v. Estate ofCrow, 734 S. W.2d 648, Supreme Court\n\nof Texas (1987). Price v. Estate ofAnderson, 522 S.W.2d 690,691 (Tex. 1975).\n\n\n                                                   II.\n                                      The Motion Is Untimely\n\n               This case was initially filed on November 20, 2015, nearly 19 months prior to the\n\nfiling of the intervenor's motion. In the original Complaint filed in this action, Mateo Cortez,\n\nnow the Personal Representative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez, was named as an individual\n\ndefendant. Paragraph 13 of the Complaint stated:\n\n               \"13. Mateo Cortez, the surviving spouse of Deborah Ann (Short)\n               Cortez, claims that as the surviving spouse of Deborah Ann (Short)\n               Cortez he is entitled to the Trust proceeds. His claim is without\n               legal merit, nevertheless, in order that he may appear and protect his\n               interest, if any, he is named as a defendant herein.\"\n\n               Mateo Cortez was not named as a defendant in his capacity as Personal\n\nRepresentative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez in the Complaint for the reason that at the time\n\nfiling of the Complaint there was no on-going administration of the Estate of Deborah Cortez.\n\nOver three and one-half years prior to the filing of the Complaint, on February 21, 2012, two and\n\none-half months after the death of Deborah Cortez, the movant, Mateo Cortez filed a Small Estate\n\nAffidavit in the Probate Court of Travis County, Texas. A copy of the Affidavit is attached\n\nhereto, marked as Exhibit A and made part hereof. In his Affidavit, Mateo Cortez swore that the\n\n\n                                                    3\n\ftotal value of all known assets of the decedent, as of the date of her death, not including the\n\nhomestead and exempt property, does not exceed $50,000.00. The Affidavit stated that there was\n\nno petition for appointment of a personal representative pending, nor had one been granted.\n\n               In the civil action sub judice, the defendant Mateo Cortez has repeatedly claimed\n\nthat: (I) he was married to Deborah Cortez; (2) Deborah Cortez died intestate and without issue;\n\nand (3) he is the sole heir at law of Deborah Cortez. Mateo Cortez is the individual who had a\n\nright to open the estate of Deborah Cortez, V. T. C.A., Estate Code §304.00 I. He failed to do that\n\nwith the result that he was the only person who could be served with the legal process intended to\n\nnotify the heirs of Deborah Cortez of this litigation. The interests of Mr. Cortez are identical to\n\nthe interest of\"the estate of Deborah Cortez\". Mr. Cortez should not be heard to complain about\n\nwhat he caused by willfully misrepresenting to the Texas Probate Court the extent of the assets of\n\nDeborah Cortez.\n\n               The movant has been aware of the pendency of this action since its initial filing.\n\nMateo Cortez did not become appointed as the Personal Representative of the Estate of Deborah\n\nCortez until well after the filing of the Complaint. The movant has no justification, other than\n\nmalicious interference, for the delay in filing the Motion to Intervene as the Personal\n\nRepresentative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez.\n\n\n                                            III.\n                The Estate of Deborah Cortez has no interest in the Property\n                               which is subiect of this action.\n\n              The Estate of Deborah Cortez has no interest in the property which is the subject of\n\nthis action. This has been specifically found by the Travis County Probate Court. In a parallel\n\ncase filed in the State of Texas, styled Mateo Cortez, as Representative of the Estate of Deborah\n\n                                                  4\n\f Cortez, Plaintiff, vs. Sandra Fleshman Brown, et al., Travis County Probate Court No. l, Cause\n\nNo. C-l-PB-16-002348, Judge Guy Hannon on February 10, 2017, entered an Amended Final\n\nJudgment ordering that the claim of Mateo Cortez as Personal Representative of the Estate of\n\nDeborah Cortez be dismissed in its entirety. The Judgment Order states in pertinent part:\n\n               \"In particular, the court dismissed any and all claims that Mateo\n               Cortez, in his individual capacity or in his capacity as personal\n               representative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez, (emphasis added)\n               had to any assets of the William D. Short and Phyllis D. Short\n               Revocable Living Trust (the Trust), other than his claim for\n               undistributed income from the Trust during the life of Deborah\n               Cortez.\"\n\n               In its Amended and Final Judgment, the Texas Probate Court imposed sanctions\n\nupon the attorney for Mateo Cortez, William J. Brotherton and the Brotherton Law Firm, jointly\n\nand severally, in the amountof$65,130.76. The defendants in the Texas litigation had previously\n\nfiled a Motion to Modify Judgment to include the sanctions award. The Court in its Order\n\ngranting the Motion found that William J. Brotherton violated Texas Civil Procedure Remedies\n\nCode Chapter 10 in signing the original Petition in Intervention, the First Amended Petition in\n\nIntervention and the Third Party Petition, Second Amended Petition in Intervention and the Third\n\nParty Petition, the Third Amended Petition in Intervention and the Third Party Petition and the\n\nFourth Petition in Intervention filed in this matter. In particular, the Court found that \"Mr.\n\nBrotherton violated Texas Civil Procedure and Practices Remedies Code § l 0.001 by signing these\n\npleadings because each of them contained the claim that Deborah Cortez was entitled to all the\n\nassets from the William D. Short and Phyllis D. Short Revocable Living Trust (the Trust) upon the\n\ndeath of Phyllis Short because Deborah was over the age of 35 when Ms. Short died. The court\n\nfinds that the plain language of the Trust foreclose such claim and that this claim does not warrant\n\n\n                                                 5\n\f by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversing of\n\n existing law or the establishment of new law.\" Copies of the Amended Final Judgment entered in\n\nthe Travis County Probate Court litigation on February I0, 2017, and the Order on Third Party\n\nDefendant's Motion to Modify Judgment and Include Sanction Award dated February 10, 2017,\n\nare attached hereto, marked as Exhibits A and B, and made part hereof.\n\n\n\n                                              IV.\n                 The Movant's interest in the proceeding bas been adequately\n                    represented by the original defendant, Mateo Cortez.\n\n                Mateo Cortez was originally named as a defendant in this proceeding and has\n\nheretofore been dismissed from this action by this Court. By Order entered by this Court on\n\nSeptember 15, 2016, the Court found that \"Mateo Cortez is not a beneficiary of the Trust and is not\n\nentitled to share in the distribution of Trust assets.\"\n\n                The Movant's claimed interest in the property set out in his Motion to Intervene is\n\nidentical to the claim made by Mateo Cortez in his individual capacity. Mateo Cortez is the sole\n\nbeneficiary of the Estate of Deborah Cortez. The claim now being advanced by Mateo Cortez in\n\nhis capacity as the Personal Representative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez is identical in all\n\nrespects to the claim made by Mateo Cortez in his individual capacity. With both claims, Mateo\n\nCortez is ultimately seeking an Order from the Court that he is entitled to distribution of all the\n\nassets of the Short Trust The Court has already fully considered his claim as to Mateo Cortez in\n\nhis individual capacity and found it to be without any merit whatsoever and dismissed Mateo\n\nCortez as a party to this action. Now, Mateo Cortez, wearing a different hat, is simply attempting\n\nto re~litigate his dismissal. The Motion is frivolous and is filed in violation of Rule 11 of the West\n\n\n                                                   6\n\fVirginia Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n\n                                                    V.\n                  Intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication\n                       of the rights of the remaining parties to this action.\n\n                The controversy giving rise to this proceeding has been the subject of extensive\n\nlitigation in this Court, the Travis County Probate Court in the State of Texas, the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, and the West Virginia Supreme Court of\n\nAppeals at considerable time and expense to the parties. All aspects of this case have been\n\nreviewed in detail by the various Courts. In each instance of court review, the Movant has been\n\nrendered an adverse ruling. The Motion before the Court is simply another effort by the Movant,\n\nMateo Cortez, and his sanctioned counsel, William J. Brotherton, to delay the ultimate conclusion\n\nof this case, all to the prejudice of the real parties in interest.\n\n\n\n                                                  VI.\n                                               Conclusion\n\n                For all the above-stated reasons, Linda Murray, in her Capacity as Successor\n\nTrustee of the William D.

Yokum, 179 W. Va. 48, 365 S.E.2d 246 (1986).\n\n\n                                   I.      INTRODUCTION\n\n               Mateo Cortez, for years, never claimed that he or the Estate of Deborah Cortez\n\nwere the sole beneficiaries to the Trust. However, as soon as Mateo Cortez and his counsel\n\ndiscovered that the Trust contained 5.2 Million in assets, they immediately concocted meritless\n\narguments to suggest that he was the sole beneficiary to the Trust Assets. This forced Mrs. Barry\n\nto hire counsel to refute these claims. However, even after winning judgment against Mateo\n\nCortez on September 15, 2016, Mrs. Barry had to expend tens of thousands of additional dollars\n\nin litigation costs solely to respond to further, frivolous filings that were submitted solely to:\n\f (a) delay this Court's consideration of the Trustee's motion for summary judgment, and (b) to\n\n drive up Mrs. Barry's litigation costs and deplete the Trust Assets. Accordingly, this Court\n\n should sanction Mateo Cortez and his counsel, and order them, jointly and severally, to pay any\n\n and all costs incurred on behalf of Mrs. Barry, at a minimum, since September 15, 2016.\n\n\n                                II.    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n                1.      \"There is authority in equity to award to the prevailing litigant his or her\n\n reasonable attorney's fees as 'costs,' without express statutory authorization, when the losing\n\nparty has acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly or for oppressive reasons.\" Syl. Pt. 3, Sally-\n\nMike Properties v. Yokum, 179 W.Va. 48, 365 S.E.2d 246 (1986).\n\n\n                2.      \"In formulating the appropriate sanction, a court shall be guided by\n\nequitable principles.    Initially, the court must identify the alleged wrongful conduct and\n\ndetermine if it warrants a sanction. The court must explain its reasons clearly on the record if it\n\ndecides a sanction is appropriate. To determine what will constitute an appropriate sanction, the\n\ncourt may consider the seriousness of the conduct, the impact the conduct had in the case and in\n\nthe administration of justice, any mitigating circumstances, and whether the conduct was an\n\nisolated occurrence or was a pattern of wrongdoing throughout the case.\" Sy!. Pt. 2, Bartles v.\n\nHinkle, 196 W.Va. 381,472 S.E.2d 827 (1996).\n\n\n               3.       \"Before imposing sanctions for filing frivolous pleadings and advancing\n\nfrivolous arguments, a trial court must give the alleged contemnor notice and an opportunity to\n\nbe heard on the questions of frivolousness, appropriate sanctions, and, if an award of attorney's\n\nfees is to be made, on the necessity and reasonableness of such fees. At the conclusion of such\n\nhearing, the trial court must make sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law to enable the\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f appellate court to conduct a meaningful review.\" Sy!. Pt. 6, Czaja v. Czaja, 208 W.Va. 62, 537\n\n S.E.2d 908 (2000).\n\n\n            Ill.        STATEMENT OF CONDUCT GIVING RISE TO SANCTIONS\n\n                                             Background\n\n                   4.     This action involves the proper distribution of the assets of the \"William\n\n D. Short and Phyllis D. Short Revocable Living Family Trust Dated April 30, 1991 ,\" as amended\n\nand restated by the \"Second Amendment and Restatement of The William D. Short and Phyllis\n\nD. Short Revocable Living Trust\" dated January 5, 2000 (collectively, the \"Trust\").\n\n\n                   5.     On December 9, 2011, Deborah Cortez, the sole daughter of William D.\n\nShort and Phyllis D. Short died.\n\n\n                   6.     On February 23, 2012, Mateo Cortez, the widower of Deborah Cortez,\n\nfiled a Small Estate Affidavit (Exl,ibit A - Small Estate Affidavit, Cause No. C-1-PB-12-338,\n\nProbate Court of Travis County, Texas), confirming that he was the sole heir to the Estate of\n\nDeborah Cortez, and confirming that the Estate of Deborah Cortez had less than $50,000 in\n\nassets.\n\n\n               7.         On August 28, 2014, the Trustee, Linda Murray, filed an action in the\n\nProbate Court of Travis County, Texas, asserting, inter alia, that Mateo Cortez and/or Deborah\n\nCortez had misappropriated certain trust assets during Deborah's lifetime.\n\n\n               8.         On October 3, 2014, Mateo Cortez filed \"Mateo Cortez's Original\n\nAnswer\" (Exliibit B - Mateo Cortez's Original Answer, Cause No. C-l-PB-14-1564, Probate\n\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\f Court of Travis County, Texas) to the Trustee's action. In his Answer, Mateo Cortez did not\n\n claim that he or the Estate of Deborah Cortez was entitled to the entirety of the Trust Assets.\n\n\n                   9.      On March 16, 2015, Mateo Cortez filed \"Mateo Cortez's First Amended\n\n Answer\" (Exhibit C - Mateo Cortez's First Amended Answer, Cause No. C-l-PB-14-1564,\n\n Probate Court of Travis County, Texas) to the Trustee's action. In his Amended Answer, Mateo\n\n Cortez did not claim that he or the Estate of Deborah Cortez was entitled to the entirety of the\n\n Trust Assets. 1\n\n\n                   10.     On June 19, 2015, counsel for Mateo Cortez deposed the Trustee. During\n\nthis deposition, the Trustee revealed, for the first time to Mateo Cortez and his counsel, that the\n\nTrust contained approximately 5.2 Million in assets.\n\n\n                   11.     On June 26, 2015, Mateo Cortez and his counsel (the Law Firm of\n\nWilliam Brotherton) filed their Original Petition in Intervention 2, arguing (for the first time,\n\never) that Mateo Cortez and/or the Estate of Deborah Cortez were the sole beneficiaries to the\n\nTrust and were, therefore, entitled to the entirety of the Trust Assets.\n\n\n\n\n         1 Of note, \"Mateo Cortez's Original Answer\" and \".Mateo Cortez's First Amended Answer\" were signed by\n\nAttorney John Clark Long IV of Dallas, Texas (Texas State Bar No. 12520500). The signature line for these two\npleadings suggests that Mr. Long was not directly affiliated with the Brotherton Law Firm at this time because Mr.\nLong had a mailing address separate from the Brotherton Law Finn, and because Mr. Long's email address was\njohn@johnlonglawyer.com. However. when Mateo Cortez flied his \"Original Petition in Intervention,\" Mr. Long\nwas directly affiliated with the Brotheron Law Finn because Mr. Long's name appeared directly underneath William\nBrotherton's name, because Mr. Long no longer had a separate mailing address, and because Mr. Long's email\naddress was john@brothertonlawfrrm.com.\n        2\n          Mrs. Bany believes that most, if not all, of the pleadings referenced herein have previously been\nsubmitted to this Court. As such, unless otherwise indicated, they will not be attached as exhibits to this Motion.\nNotwithstanding, Mrs. Barry submits all prior pleadings in further support of her Motion for Sanctions as though\nthey were specifically attached hereto.\n\n\n\n                                                        4\n\f                 12.     On November 20, 2015, the Trustee filed her Complaint in the Circuit\n\n Court of Wirt County, West Virginia, asking this Honorable Court to determine who were the\n\n rightful beneficiaries to the Trust.\n\n\n                 13.     On September 15, 2016, this Court granted Mrs. Barry's motion for partial\n\n sununary judgment, and dismissed Mateo Cortez as a defendant in this case based upon the\n\n findings, conclusions, and rulings reflected therein. Among other findings, the Court concluded\n\nthat the plain and unambiguous language of the Trust instrument provides that: (i) the net\n\nincome of the Trust would be paid to Mr. and Mrs. Short during their lives; (ii) upon Mr. and\n\nMrs. Short's death, the net income of the Trust would then be paid to their daughter, Deborah\n\nCortez, during her life; and then, (iii) upon Deborah's death, any remaining Trust assets would\n\nbe distributed to the \"heirs of law\" of Mr. and Mrs. Short, and not to Cortez. The Court also\n\nrejected Mateo Cortez's arguments that the Trust should have terminated upon the death of Mrs.\n\nShort and its assets distributed to Deborah during her life; and as a result the Trust assets should\n\nbe treated as an asset of Deborah's estate, of which Cortez is the sole heir and beneficiary.\n\n\n             Statement oftlie improper purposes underlvi11g Mateo Cortez's actions\n\n                14.     Following this Court's entry of summary judgment against him on\n\nSeptember 15, 2016, Mateo Cortez, in both his personal capacity and his capacity as the Personal\n\nRepresentative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez (collectively, \"Mateo Cortez\"), filed numerous\n\nadditional pleadings that are improper under the rules of procedure, that assert obviously\n\nfrivolous claims, and that were filed to obstruct further progression of this case and to drive up\n\nthe parties' litigation costs. These pleadings were filed for the following improper purposes:\n\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\f                             a.       The primary improper purpose of Mateo Cortez's frivolous post-\n\n          judgment filings was to delay this Court's consideration of the Trustee's motion for\n\n          summary judgment, filed September 21, 2016, the resolution of which would trigger the\n\n          parties' \"Rule 11 Agreement\" in Texas. (Exlzibit D - Rule 11 Agreement, Cause No. C-\n\n          l-PB-14-1564, Probate Court of Travis County, Texas) The \"Rule 11 Agreement\" was\n\n          executed by counsel for Mateo Cortez and the Trustee, and permits the Trustee to\n\n          distribute assets of the Trust \"as may be permitted by a final order by a court of\n\n          competent jurisdiction.\" Point being, once Judge Waters ruled on the Trustee's motion\n\n          for summary judgment, then the Trustee could distribute the Trust assets per the Rule 11\n\n          Agreement.\n\n\n                            b.       The secondary improper purposes of Mateo Cortez's frivolous\n\n         post-judgment filings were: (a) to drive up the litigation costs incurred by the Trustee\n\n         and the true beneficiaries of the Trust; (b) to deplete the Trust assets available for\n\n         distribution; and (c) to retaliate against individual beneficiaries (such as Mrs. Barry) for\n\n         asserting their rightful interests in the Trust.\n\n\n      Frivolous pleadings filed after Mrs. Barry obtained judgment against Mateo Cortez3\n\n                  15.      Mateo Cortez submitted the following frivolous filings after this Court\n\ngranted judgment against him:\n\n\n\n\n         :J To be clear, Mrs. Barry contends that, from the outset of litigation in West Virginia, Mateo Cortez and his\ncounsel have proffered meritless arguments not founded in Jaw or fact. As such. this Court has every right, under\nSally Mike Properties, to order Mateo Cortez and his counsel to pay all of Mrs. Barry's legal fees. However, this\nMotion for Sanctions will focus on why the pleadings filed after Mrs. Barry obtained judgment against Mateo\nCortez are particularly egregious.\n\n\n                                                          6\n\f                a.      Motion to Amend or Alter: On September 29, 2016, Mateo Cortez\n\n filed a motion to alter or amend the Court's summary judgment order against him.\n\n Although the motion was procedurally proper, the grounds for relief were frivolous and\n\n simply sought to rehash the Court's rulings under baseless alternate legal theories.\n\n\n                b.      Notice of Removal, Motion to Dismiss: On October 21, 2016,\n\n Mateo Cortez filed a notice of removal of this case to the United States District Court for\n\n the Southern District of West Virginia, despite the fact that he was no longer a party to\n\nthe case, there was no basis for invoking federal jurisdiction, and the time for removal\n\nhad expired nearly a year earlier. Mateo Cortez filed for removal two (2) days after the\n\nTrustee noticed her summary judgment motion for a hearing, and did so to prevent the\n\nCourt from holding that hearing and to delay the Court's disposition of his motion to alter\n\nor amend. Additionally, upon removing the case, Mateo Cortez attempted to collaterally\n\nattack this Court's rulings by filing a successive, post-judgment motion to dismiss in\n\nfederal court. On April JO, 2017, the Federal Court rejected Mateo Cortez's argument,\n\nand remanded this matter back to the Circuit Court of Wirt County, West Virginia.\n\n\n               c.      Motion to Dismiss & Motion to Intervene: On June 12, 2017,\n\nMateo Cortez filed (1) a second post-judgment motion to dismiss \"in his personal\n\ncapacity,\" and (2) a motion to intervene \"in his capacity as personal representative of the\n\nEstate of Deborah Cortez,\" along with a proposed intervenor complaint seeking to re-\n\nargue his entitlement to the Trust under yet another baseless legal theory. By letter to\n\ncounsel dated June 15, 2017, (Exhibit E - Brotherton June I 5, 2017 letter) counsel for\n\nMateo Cortez conceded that the intent of these two motions was to delay this Court's\n\nresolution of the Trustee's motion for summary judgment:\n\n\n                                         7\n\f                (Mr. Brotherton):       I called your office yesterday to confer\n                regarding whether or not you and your clients wished to consider\n                scheduling our motion to intervene and motion to dismiss for the\n                27th and reschedule the motion for summary judgment after the\n                court has ruled on our motions. That would appear to be the best\n                process for judicial economy.\n\n        E.xhibitE.\n\n          Notice to Mateo Cortez and his counsel that their conduct was sanctionable\n\n                I 6.   As mentioned below, counsel for Mateo Cortez has, on occasion, argued\n\nthat he should not be sanctioned because he was never given notice that his conduct was\n\nsanctionable. See infra. Accordingly, to demonstrate the efforts to avoid seeking the requested\n\nsanction in West Virginia, the following chronicles the various filings, letters, statements, and/or\n\nrulings placing Mateo Cortez and his counsel on notice that his claims have no merit and/or that\n\ncontinued litigation of his claims is oppressive, vexatious, and sanctionable:\n\n\n                       a.     September 15, 2016: In this Court's Order granting Mrs. Barry's\n\n       motion for partial summary judgment, this Court made clear that neither Mateo Cortez,\n\n       nor the Estate of Deborah Cortez, are entitled to take under the Trust.\n\n\n                       b.     November 7, 2016: In her November 7, 2016, Motion to Remand\n\n       and Award of Attorneys Fees and Costs, Mrs. Barry made clear that Mateo Cortez\n\n       removed this case to Federal Court solely to delay the proper administration of the Trust:\n\n\n               Additionally, Defendant Cortez did not seek to remove this case\n               until after the state court ruled that he is NOT entitled to a\n               distribution from the Trust. Therefore, it is clear from the timing\n               of this Notice of Removal that the purpose of removing to federal\n               court was solely to obstruct the progression of the state court case,\n               and to delay his obligation to appeal that court's judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\f          (See Document 8, Memorandum in support of Mrs. Barry's Motion to Remand, p. 2, not\n          auached4)\n\n                            c.      November 11, 2016:            In her November 11, 2016, Motion to\n\n          Remand and Award Attorney Fees and Costs, the Trustee made clear that Mateo Cortez\n\n          removed this case to Federal Court solely to delay the proper administration of the Trust:\n\n\n                  In the case at bar there is no reason, other than delay or\n                  obstruction, for Cortez to have waited until October 21, 2016, to\n                  seek to remove this proceeding from the state court to federal\n                  court.\n\n         (See Document 14, Memorandum in support of Plaintiffs Motion to Remand, p. 14, not\n         attached)\n\n                           d.       December 19, 2016: On December 19, 2016, the Texas court also\n\n         granted summary judgment against Mateo Cortez, dismissing \"any and all claims that\n\n         Mateo Cortez, in his individual capacity or in his capacity as personal representative of\n\n         the Estate of Deborah Cortez, has to any assets of The William D. Short and Phyllis D.\n\n         Short Revocable Living Trust (the 'Trust'), other than his claim for undistributed income\n\n         from the Trust during the life of Deborah Cortez.\" (See, Order Granting Third Party\n\n         Defendants' Traditional and No Evidence Motion for Summary Judgment, Cause No. C-\n\n         l-PB-14-1564, Probate Court of Travis County, Texas, Dec. 19, 2016, not attached).\n\n\n                          e.       January 30, 2017: During a sanctions hearing before the Probate\n\n         Court of Travis County, Texas, counsel for Mateo Cortez argued, incredulously, that they\n\n         were never informed that their arguments qualified as bad faith:\n\n\n\n         4\n           Mrs. Barry believes the pleadings in Federal Court have been transmitted to the Circuit Clerk and the\nCourt can consider the same as if they were attached hereto. Should the Court need courtesy copies of any pleading,\nFederal or other, please contact the office of Mrs. Barry's counsel.\n\n\n                                                         9\n\f                   (Mr. Ruback) If counsel believed that my client was making bad\n                   faith arguments from the initial filing in the case, from each\n                   hearing that this Court has heard in the case, why didn't counsel\n                   bring that to my client's attention? Why didn't counsel bring that\n                   to the Court's attention? Laches would bar the arguments they're\n                   making today. (Exhibit F - Transcript of January 30, 2017\n                   Hearing, Cause No. C-1-PB-16-2348, Probate Court of Travis\n                   County, Texas, p. I 55).\n\n          However, during this hearing, the undersigned made clear that counsel for Mateo Cortez\n\n          knew or should have known as early as February of 2016 that Mateo Cortez's claims\n\n          were sanctionable:\n\n\n                   (Mr. Ruback) Q: Mr. Boone, when did you first advise my clients\n                   that you believe their conduct was sanctionable?\n\n                   (Mr. Boone) A: I think when we had a hearing - I think it was\n                   back in February or March [of2016] there was a room full of heirs\n                   at law in West Virginia, and there was Judge Waters, there was\n                   myself, there was several other attorneys. And I - I believe the\n                   discussion about the claims raised by Mateo Cortez, the discussion\n                   how they were without any merit at all should have given notice to\n                   the Brotherton Law Firm that these claims should not have been\n                   continued.\n\n                   (Exhibit F, p. I 09)\n\n                           f.       February 10, 2017:           On February IO, 2017, the Texas court\n\n         awarded sanctions against Cortez's lawyers, finding that arguments advanced by Cortez\n\n         in Texas were frivolous.         (Exhibit G - Order on Third Party Defendants' Motion to\n\n         Modify Judgment to Include Sanctions Award, Cause No. C-I-PB-16-2348, Probate\n\n         Court of Travis County, Texas). The Texas court sanctioned Cortez's lawyers in the\n\n         amount of $65,130.76 for driving up Mrs. Barry's legal fees in Texas with frivolous\n\n         claims.\n\n         5 The entire transcript is attached as an exhibit to this Motion. Mrs. Bany asks thjs Court to take judicial\n\nnotice of this transcript, and to accept and consider same in support of this Motion.\n\n\n                                                         10\n\f                    g.    February 23, 2017: On February 23, 2017, the undersigned sent a\n\n letter to William J. Brotherton, with carbon copy to James W. Marshall, III, H. F.\n\n Salsbery, and Andrew R. Herrick of the law finn of Bailey and Wyant, demanding \"that\n\n Mateo Cortez and/or the Estate of Deborah Cortez immediately withdraw any and all\n\n claims to the Trust Assets,\" and explaining that if counsel for Mateo Cortez failed to\n\n immediately withdraw their claims to the Trust Assets, then the undersigned \"will take\n\n appropriate action to:     (a) seek additional sanctions against your firm and (b) seek\n\n sanctions against Mr. Mateo Cortez personally.\" (Exhibit H - Boone February 23, 2017\n\nletter) On March 1, 2017, William Brotherton rejected the undersigned's February 23,\n\n2017, demand, suggesting that the orders from Judge Waters and Judge Hennan are\n\n\"riddled with <>rrors and inaccuracies.\" (Exhibit I-Brotherton March I, 2017 letter).\n\n\n               h.        April 11, 2017:    On April 11, 2017, the United States District\n\nCourt for the Southern District of West Virginia remanded this matter back to the Circuit\n\nCourt of Wirt County, West Virginia, thereby rejecting the arguments proffered by Mateo\n\nCortez to justify removal. (See Document 36, Memorandum Opinion and Order, not\n\nattached)\n\n\n               i.        May 10, 2017: On May 10, 2017, the parties conducted mediation\n\nin Houston Texas. The matter did not resolve.\n\n\n              j.         June 26, 2017: By letter dated June 26, 2017, the undersigned\n\nagain warned Mateo Cortez's attorneys that their litigation tactics were frivolous and\n\ntaken in bad faith, and further warned that Mrs. Barry would seek sanctions against them\n\nif they refused to cease their obstruction of this case. (Exhibit J - Boone June 26, 2017\n\n\n\n                                           II\n\f         letter)        Mateo Cortez and his attorneys have nonetheless refused to withdraw their\n\n         frivolous claims.\n\n\n                                          IV.    ARGUMENT\n\n                   To recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs as a sanction, the prevailing\n\n litigant must show that the losing party \"acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly or for\n\n oppressive reasons.\" See Sy!. Pt. 3, Sally-Mike Properties v. Yokum, 179 W.Va. 48, 365 S.E.2d\n\n246 (1986). In order to determine whether the losing party's conduct rises to such a level, the\n\nCourt must evaluate \"(!) the seriousness of the misconduct; (2) the impact the conduct had in the\n\ncase and in the administration of justice; (3) whether there are mitigating circumstances; and\n\n(4) whether the conduct was an isolated occurrence or was a pattern of wrongdoing.\" Pritt v.\n\nSuzuki Motor Co., Ltd, 204 W.Va. 388, 397, 513 S.E.2d 161, 170 (1998) (citing Sy!. Pt. 2,\n\nBartles v. Hinkle, 196 W.Va. 381,472 S.E.2d 827 (1996)).\n\n\n        A.         The Seriousness of the Misconduct\n\n                   I.       Mateo Cortez And His Attorneys Began Their Vicious Assault On The\n                            Rightful Heirs Only After Discovering That The Trust Contained Over\n                            Five Million Dollars In Assets.\n\n                   From the outset, it is important to review the facts and circumstances surrounding\n\nthe genesis of Mateo Cortez's frivolous arguments. In 2012, Mateo Cortez filed a Small Estate\n\nAffidavit, for the Estate of Deborah Cortez, confirming that the Estate had less than $50,000.\n\n(Exhibit A). In 2014, when Mateo Cortez responded to allegations that he misappropriated\n\ncertain Trust Assets, he never claimed that he or the Estate of Deborah Cortez were the sole\n\nbeneficiaries to the Trust. In fact, Mateo Cortez and his counsel did not discover the sizeable\n\nnature of the Trust until the deposition of the Trustee on June 19, 2015.\n\n\n\n                                                   12\n\f                    During a hearing before the Probate Court, the Trustee testified regarding her\n\n experience during this June 19, 2015, deposition. 6 The Trustee testified that, during her\n\n deposition, it became clear Mateo Cortez and his counsel did not know the amount of the Trust\n\n prior to this deposition and that, upon learning the amount of the Trust, Mateo Cortez and his\n\n counsel became instantly enamored of the sizeable nature of the Trust.\n\n\n                   Q. (By Mr. Boone) Who was -- who was taking the deposition?\n\n                   A. Brotherton.\n\n                   Q. The Brotherton Law Firm? Someone from the Brotherton Law\n                   Firm?\n\n                   A. Yes, it was.\n\n                   Q. And Mateo Cortez was there?\n                   A. Yes.\n\n                  Q. All right.\n                  A. He was with them.\n\n                  Q. Okay. So when they asked you how much was in the trust did\n                  you know the answer?\n\n                  A. Yes, I did.\n\n                  Q. And did you tell them the answer?\n\n                  A. Yes, I did.\n\n                  Q. What was your answer?\n                  A. 5.2 million dollars.\n\n                  Q. What if any reaction did yon observe at that time?\n\n         6\n          As noted above, on February JO, 2017 1 the Honorable Guy Herman, Judge of the Probate Court of Travis\nCounty, Texas, sanctioned William Brotherton and the Brotherton Law Firm for filing frivolous claims, and ordered\nthem to pay $65,130.76 within 30 days to Mrs. Bany. In advance of this sanctions award, Judge Herman conducted\nan evidentiary hearing on January 30, 2017. At this evidentiary hearing, the Trustee testified regarding her efforts in\nTexas to recoup monies that were misappropriated by Mateo Cortez, including her experience sitting for her\ndeposition on June 19, 2015.\n\n\n\n                                                          13\n\f                 A. You could see eyes rolling.\n\n                 Q.Howso?\n\n                 A. Just so you could -- you could just see that they knew there\n                 was a lot of money. And then shortly after we had a break.\n\n                 Q. Shortly after that question there was a break?\n\n                A. Yes.\n\n                Q. And what do you mean by \"a break?\"\n\n                A. 15 minute break.\n\n                Q. Counsel left and --\n\n                A. Counsel left, we -- yes.\n\n                Q. And do you recall if there were many questions after the break\n                concluded?\n\n                A. No, there wasn't.\n\n                Q. And that deposition occurred on June 19th, 2015, correct?\n\n                A. That is correct.\n\n                Q. Now, did Mateo through his counsel make any claims after that\n                deposition that were new and different? Did they file any papers\n                or pleadings or anything after that deposition?\n\n               A. Oh, yes. They filed -- they filed saying that that money\n               belonged to Mateo Cortez and all -- and it was all of it. He -- Matt\n               said all of the money belonged to him.\n\n(Exhibit F, pp. 85-86)( emphasis added).\n\n\n               As such, in light of Mateo Cortez's filings in 2012 and 2014, and in light of the\n\nJune 19, 2015, deposition, it is clear that Mateo Cortez had no any idea regarding the sizeable\n\nnature of the Trust. In fact, it wasn't until seven (7) days after the June 19, 2015, deposition, did\n\nMateo Cortez first allege that he and/or the Estate of Deborah Cortez were entitled to the entirety\n\nof the Trust Assets; on that date, June 26, 2015, William Brotherton filed Mateo Cortez's\n\n\n\n                                                  14\n\f \"Original Petition in Intervention,\" claiming that Mateo Cortez is the sole heir to the Trust\n\n Assets.\n\n\n               Point being, it was only after learning that the Trust Assets contained 5.2 Million\n\ndid Mateo Cortez and his Legal Team begin to embark with their \"no holds bar\" quest to strip the\n\nrightful beneficiaries of their rights to the Trust Assets. Without question, the timing of their\n\nactions reveal that Mateo Cortez and his counsel have been motivated solely by greed, and not\n\nby any legitimate claim to the Trust Assets.\n\n\n               2.     Mateo Cortez And His Attorneys Filed Their Claims Without Any\n                      Justification In Fact Or Law.\n\n               The inability of Mateo Cortez's counsel to articulate any reasonable justification\n\nfor claiming Mateo Cortez is sole heir to the Trust Assets further demonstrates the seriousness of\n\nthe misconduct. At the January 30, 2017, hearing before the Probate Court, Texas Counsel for\n\nthe heirs-at-Jaw, Brian Thompson, examined Mr. Brotherton under oath, and asked Mr.\n\nBrotherton to explain why Mateo Cortez is entitled to take under the \"Postponement Section\" of\n\nthe Trust. (Exhibit F, pp. 37 - 48). As the record demonstrates, Mr. Brotherton could not\n\nsufficiently explain the basis for his claim. First, Mr. Brotherton rationalized his inability to\n\nfully explain the basis for Iris initial pleading with being preoccupied by a matter in North\n\nDakota.\n\n\n              Q. (Mr. Thompson) Okay. It seems to me that most of the claims\n              that you brought -- or all of the claims that you brought on behalf\n              of your client were based on Texas Jaw as it exists now. You\n              weren't saying that law should change, were you?\n\n              A. (Mr. Brotherton) Again -- and I've got to say over the last six\n              months I've spent most of my time in North Dakota so I haven't\n              been involved in this case in a little while. So you may want to\n              talk with Mr. Hester about some of those technical issues.\n\n\n                                               15\n\f (Exhibit F, p. 20).\n\n\n                Further, when pressed for a simple explanation as to why the Estate of Deborah\n\n Cortez is entitled to take under the Postponement Provision (Section D), Mr. Brotherton could\n\nnot provide an explanation:\n\n\n                Q. And again, back to my original question, is there any other\n                language in that D portion, the postponement of possession\n                portion, that you believe supports this postponement provision\n                claim?\n\n               A. You're talking about in the trust?\n\n               Q. Well, sir, the claim cites in every single one of the pleadings\n               that we looked at, the claim cites Article 8 Section D to support\n               this claim. And I'm asking you, can you point out what language\n               you believe in Article 8, Section D supports this claim? And that's\n               on Page 5 of the trust.\n\n               A. Well, I mean, whatever we put in our pleadings is -- is --\n               addresses that. I'm not going to sit here and try and explain it all\n               to you at this point because certainly we've outlined in our\n               pleadings, we've consulted with necessary experts and we believe\n               every claim we've made is colorable.\n\n               Q. Was Mr. Kelsey going to testify in this case if it had reached\n               trial as an expert?\n\n               A. I hadn't made that decision yet.\n\n               Q. He certainly was never designated as an expert, was he?\n\n               A. Correct.\n\n(Exhibit F, pp. 40-41).\n\n\n               In sum, Mr. Brotherton could not justify his argument that Mateo Cortez, pursuant\n\nto the Postponement provision, was entitled to the Trust Assets. As such, Judge Herman agreed\n\nthat Mr. Brotherton's conduct was sanctionable, and ordered Mr. Brotherton to pay $65,130.76\n\nto Mrs. Barry for her legal fees in Texas. (To date, Mr. Brotherton refuses to pay this sanctions\n\n\n                                                16\n\f award.) Mr. Brotheron testified that the arguments proffered in Texas were \"virtually identical\"\n\n to the arguments proffered in West Virginia. (Exhibit F, p. 42). As such, just as Judge Herman\n\n awarded sanctions against the Brotherton Law Firm for fees and costs expended by Mrs. Barry in\n\n Texas, so should this Honorable Court similarly award sanctions for fees and costs expended by\n\n Mrs. Barry in West Virginia.\n\n\n               3.     Mateo Cortez And His Attorneys Deliberately Filed Frivolous Pleadings\n                      With The Improper Purpose Of Obstructing The Progression Of This Case\n                      And Driving Up The Parties' Litigation Costs.\n\n               Each time the Trustee would notice her motion for summary judgment for a\n\nhearing, Mateo Cortez would initiate a new filing to delay this Court's consideration of the\n\nTrustee's motion. First, when the Trustee filed a notice on September 21, 2016, setting her\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment for hearing on November 3, 2016, Mateo Cortez removed this\n\ncase to Federal Court on October 21, 2016. Later (after remand), when the Trustee again filed a\n\nnotice on April 20, 2017, setting her motion for hearing on June 27, 2017, counsel for Mateo\n\nCortez filed a Motion to Dismiss and Motion to Intervene. Incredulously, a letter from William\n\nBrotherton confirms that the sole intent of these two motions was to delay consideration of\n\nTrustee's motion for summary judgment.\n\n\n              I called your office yesterday to confer regarding whether or not\n              you and your clients wished to consider scheduling our motion to\n              intervene and motion to dismiss for the 27th and reschedule the\n              motion for summary judgment after the court has ruled on our\n              motions. That would appear to be the best process for judicial\n              economy.\n\nExhibitE\n\n\n              The reason why Mateo Cortez has repeatedly attempted to derail consideration of\n\nthe Trustee's Motion for Summary Judgment is because once the Court grants the Trustee's\n\n\n                                              17\n\f motion for summary judgment, then the assets may be distributed. Pursuant to a Rule 11\n\n Agreement executed by counsel for Mateo Cortez and counsel for Trustee, the Trustee may\n\n distribute assets of the Trust \"as may be pennitted by a final order by a court of competent\n\njurisdiction.\" Exhibit D. Mateo Cortez has attempted to obstruct the proceedings in this Court\n\nprecisely because the declaratory relief requested by the Trustee (i.e., \"an order directing the\n\ndistribution of the assets of the Trust to those persons determined by this Court to be entitled to\n\nreceive the same\") would trigger the Rule 11 Agreement.\n\n\n               Additionally, Mateo Cortez has also filed these pleadings to drive up the costs of\n\nthis litigation, in a plan to deplete the Trust assets and to cause financial hann to the individual\n\nTrust beneficiaries. In West Virginia alone, the rightful beneficiaries of the Trust have been\n\nforced to defend against multiple motions, an extraordinary writ petition, and an improvident\n\npost-judgment case removal, to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees and nearly\n\ntwo years of delay. Each of Mateo Cortez's litigation tactics have been rejected by the court(s)\n\nthat have considered them, yet the Trustee and the true beneficiaries of the Trust have\n\nnonetheless suffered real financial hann in defending against them.\n\n\n       B.      The Conduct of Mateo Cortez and His Counsel has Impacted the Financial,\n               Physical and Emotional Wellbeing of the Parties.\n\n               I.     Mrs. Barry Has Expended Over Tens of Thousand Dollars Fighting\n                      Meritless Litigation.\n\n               The impact of Mateo Cortez's misconduct was the abuse of the legal system\n\nthrough the attempted prosecution of a series of baseless claims:\n\n\n               Although there is an undeniable interest in the maintenance of\n               unrestricted access to the judicial system, unfounded claims or\n               defenses asserted for vexatious, wanton, or oppressive purposes\n\n\n                                                18\n\f                place an unconscionable burden upon precious judicial resources\n                already stretched to their limits in an increasingly litigious society.\n                In reality to the extent that these claims or defenses increase delay\n                or divert attention from valid claims or defenses asserted in good\n                faith, they serve to deny the very access to the judicial system they\n                would claim as justification for their immunity from sanction.\n\nDaily Gazette Co. v. Canady, 175 W.Va. 249,252,332 S.E.2d 262,265 (1985). Mateo Cortez's\n\n misconduct also had a profound impact on Mrs. Barry, who has incurred tens of thousands of\n\ndollars in legal fees defending against baseless claims that never should have been pursued.\n\n\n                2.      The Trustee Has Suffered Emotionally And Physically.\n\n                During the January 30, 2017, hearing, the Trustee testified that the frivolous\n\nlitigation has adversely affected the Trustee's relationship with her family, and adversely\n\nimpacted her emotional and physical health.\n\n\n                Firstly, the litigation has adversely affected the Trustee's relationship with her\n\nfamily. Once Mateo Cortez argued that he was entitled to the entirety of the Trust Assets, the\n\nTrustee was forced to institute proceedings in West Virginia to detem1ine the rightful heirs.\n\nOnce the Trustee filed the Complaint in West Virginia, and served notice to her family members,\n\nher family members became unhappy with her. (Exhibit F, pp. 91-92). The Trustee testified\n\nthat the ongoing litigation has caused a strain with her sister and brother. (Exliibit F, pp. 91-92).\n\n\n               Secondly, the litigation has adversely affected the Trustee's physical and\n\nemotional health. The litigation has caused the Trustee to gain significant weight (Exhibit F, p.\n\n95) and has required her to take anti-anxiety medication (Exhibit F, p. 95).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 19\n\f                In sum, the conduct of Mateo Cortez and his counsel, in prosecuting his baseless\n\n claim, has adversely impacted the emotional and physical well-being of the Trustee, Linda\n\n Murray.\n\n\n        C.     There are No Mitigating Circumstances to Excuse the Misconduct\n\n               There are no mitigating circumstances that can justify Mateo Cortez's\n\nmisconduct. Every court to consider Mateo Cortez's claims to the Trust has rejected them.\n\nMoreover, on February 10, 2017, the Texas court sanctioned Mateo Cortez for the amount of\n\nMrs. Barry's accrued attorneys' fees and costs in Texas, finding that his claims in Texas (and\n\nwhich he has sought to litigate here) were frivolous and were not warranted by existing law; by\n\nthe extension, modification, or reversal of existing law; or by the establishment of new law.\n\nDespite one court already finding his litigation tactics frivolous as a matter of law, Mateo Cortez\n\nhas continued to pursue those claims in this Court.\n\n\n       D.      The Conduct of Mateo Cortez and His Counsel has Permeated the Entirety of\n               Litigation.\n\n               Mateo Cortez's misconduct was not an isolated occurrence, but has been a\n\nrepeated pattern of misconduct not only before this Court but also in the litigation in Texas.\n\nMateo Cortez has repeatedly attempted to distort the status of this case and the Texas case, the\n\nplain language of the Trust instrument, and the laws applicable to the Trust. He has abused the\n\nrules of procedure in West Virginia and in Texas in an effort to either convince a court to agree\n\nwith his distorted and frivolous view of the Tmst instrument, or to obstruct the lawful\n\nadministration of the Trust. As a result, the Trustee, Mrs. Barry, and others have expended an\n\nincredible amount of time, effort, and money in defending the plain language of the Tmst (and\n\nthe clear intent of the settlers) against a never-ending succession of bogus filings, filings\n\n\n                                               20\n\f submitted by a party that doesn't even have an interest in the Trust assets. Moreover, Mateo\n\n Cortez has continued to file frivolous pleadings in West Virginia and in Texas even after being\n\n specifically put on notice that his litigation conduct is being conducted in bad faith, and even\n\n after having been sanctioned in Texas.\n\n\n                                       V.     CONCLUSION\n\n                From the outset of this case, Mateo Cortez and his attorneys have wrongfully and\n\nunnecessarily forced Mrs. Barry and others to expend over tens of thousands of dollars in legal\n\nfees, over the course of nearly two years, defending against obviously frivolous claims. The sole\n\npurpose of this improper conduct is clear: to obstruct the administration of justice, to deplete the\n\nassets of a Trust to which he has zero claim, and to retaliate against the true beneficiaries of the\n\nTrust for defending their interests.\n\n\n               Although Mrs. Barry, as well as others, are arguably entitled under Sally Mike\n\nProperties for all their attorney fees expended in the case, Mrs. Barry is choosing to focus her\n\nmotion for sanctions on the conduct of Mateo Cortez and his counsel after this Court entered\n\njudgment against Mateo Cortez on September 15, 2016. The reason why Mrs. Barry is focusing\n\non the conduct after September 15, 2016, is because prior to September 15, 2016, Mateo Cortez\n\nwas responding to a Complaint filed in West Virginia that: (a) sought to determine who were the\n\nrightful beneficiaries under the Trust, and (b) specifically named Mateo Cortez as one of the\n\nindividuals laying claim to the Trust. Point being, it is not surprising Mateo Cortez, under those\n\ncircumstances, would respond to this Complaint and lob arguments (however tenuous) in\n\nresponse to the Trustee's Complaint.        However, once this Court entered its well-reasoned\n\ndecision on September 15, 2016, denying Mateo Cortez's claims, Mateo Cortez and his counsel\n\n\n\n\n                                                21\n\f were unequivocally placed on notice that their claims had zero merit, and that any further\n\nimproper behavior to frustrate the lawful administration of the Trust would not go unpunished.\n\n\n                  From September 15, 2016, forward, Mateo Cortez and his counsel engaged in\n\nimproper conduct intended solely to delay the proper administration of the Trust; to waste the\n\ntime and resources of Connie Barry, the Trustee and others; and to deplete the Trust Assets.\n\nFrom September 15, 2016, forward, despite repeated warnings, Mateo Cortez and his counsel\n\nengaged in willful, vexatious, and malicious litigation, entitling Mrs. Barry to an award of\n\nattorney fees. See Sy!. Pt. 3, Sally-Mike Properties v. Yokum, I 79 W.Va. 48, 365 S.E.2d 246\n\n(1986).     Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, Defendant Connie Lou Keith Barry\n\nrequests that the Court grant the following relief:\n\n\n                        a.      That the Court enter the attached proposed Order Setting Show\n\n          Cause Hearing on Issue of Sanctions, setting this matter for a hearing to show cause as to\n\n       why sanctions, in the form of paying, at a minimum, all of Mrs. Barry's reasonable\n\n       attorneys' fees and costs incurred in this lawsuit from September 15, 2016, forward,\n\n       should not issue against: (I) Mateo Cortez, in his personal capacity and his capacity as\n\n       the personal representative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez; (2) attorneys James W.\n\n       Marshall, III, H.F. Salsbery, Michael W. Taylor, William J. Brotherton (pro hac vice),\n\n       and Shawn M. Brotherton (pro hac vice); or (3) both, jointly and severally;\n\n\n                        b.      That at the conclusion of said hearing, the Court enter an order\n\n       granting Connie Lou Keith Barry's motion for sanctions and permit Mrs. Barry to submit\n\n       additional papers in support of her reasonable attorneys' fees and costs; and\n\n\n                        c.     For such further relief as the Court deems proper.\n\n\n                                                 22\n\f                 c_fi.c. 60~\n                 Aaron C.

Again, Your Honor, Brian\n\n24       Thompson on behalf of the third party defendants who are the\n\n25       second group of folks which you just read into the record.          As\n\n\n                                   MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                     (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                            6\n\n\n     1   you've said we're here today on a motion for sanctions.     This\n\n     2   is not a motion for sanctions against any of the parties\n\n     3   involved, this is a motion for sanctions against two of the\n\n     4   attorneys representing Mateo Cortez.\n\n     5                I think the Court's pretty familiar with the\n\n     6   background of this case so I won't go into it at length, but\n\n 7       as you know this is a trust dispute regarding the proper\n\n 8       interpretation of a trust document.    The matter is currently\n\n 9       pending in two different jurisdictions.    There is this case\n\n10       and as well there is a case up in West Virginia.\n\n11                   I'm joined here today with my co-counsel Aaron\n\n12       Boone who is West Virginia counsel for some similarly situated\n\n13       individuals up in West Virginia.   He will be participating in\n\n14       the hearing, he's been admitted pro hac vice by the Court\n\n15       already.\n\n16                   Your Honor, there were two main claims by Mateo\n\n17       Cortez in this matter that effect my clients.   There is the\n\n18       one argument that Deborah Cortez was her parents' sole heir at\n\n19       law and therefore under the terms of the trust she inherited\n\n20       everything upon the death of her mother Phyllis Short.    That\n\n21       argument was what I think took up most of the Court's\n\n22       attention and of course I think the lawyers' attention as well\n\n23       in the motion for reconsideration which I think the Court has\n\n24       in front of it by submission.\n\n25                   After reviewing that allegation, after reviewing\n\n\n                               MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                 (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                             7\n\n\n     1   some of the law on that we still feel like we are definitely\n\n 2       right and entitled to summary judgment on that claim.       But I\n\n 3       will tell you, I do think that that is a colorable claim and\n\n 4       so we are not going to be asking for sanctions today with\n\n 5       regard to that claim.     I am narrowing the scope of our\n\n 6       sanctions motion today.\n\n 7                    Where I will concentrate today on is what I call\n\n 8       the postponement provision argument.    And this is the argument\n\n 9       that under a particular section of the trust that I'm going to\n\n10       go through at length today, that -- this provision applied to\n\n11       beneficiaries who were under the age of 35 at the time they\n\n12       became entitled to distribution under the trust.    And this\n\n13       Court's familiar with those type of provisions.    It's usually\n\n14       put in trusts because there is an assumption I guess on some\n\n15       settlor's part that people under the age of 21, 35, 18,\n\n16       whatever it is, should not get their distribution outright,\n\n17       they may be too immature to be able to handle that kind of\n\n18       money.   And that of course was the intent behind this\n\n19       provision.\n\n20                    We believe that there is no colorable argument\n\n21       under Texas or Florida law, which are basically the same law\n\n22       here, on this issue.    It is very clear and I think all the\n\n23       parties agree that Ms. Cortez was well over the age of 35 not\n\n24       only when she became entitled to distribution under the trust,\n\n25       but even when this trust was actually executed.\n\n\n                                 MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                   (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                         8\n\n\n 1                Your Honor, we're proceeding today under Texas\n\n 2   Rule of Civil Procedure 13 as well as Civil Practice and\n\n 3   Remedies Code, Chapter 10.    As you know the triggering event\n\n 4   for a sanction under both of those sections is the attorney's\n\n 5   signing of a pleading that contains a sanctionable claim.     And\n\n 6   under CPRC Chapter 10 each and every claim must meet the\n\n 7   burden under that rule, and that burden is that each claim is\n\n 8   warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for\n\n 9   the extension and modification or reversal of existing law.\n\n10                I'm going to again narrow the scope of this a\n\n11   little bit and concentrate my efforts on Texas Civil Practice\n\n12   and Remedies Code, Chapter 10.    I think most courts who have\n\n13   interpreted Rule 13 and Chapter 10 say that they are certainly\n\n14   compatible, but I think you have a better chance in this type\n\n15   of situation under Chapter 10 so that's where I'm going to\n\n16   concentrate my efforts.    And we assert that the attorneys\n\n17   William Brotherton and Sean Hester should be sanctioned for\n\n18   violation of Chapter 10.\n\n19                We're going to offer their testimony today, Your\n\n20   Honor.   We're also going to offer the testimony of Linda\n\n21   Murray who is one of the folks that -- whose name you read\n\n22   into the record earlier.    She's both the trustee of the trust\n\n23   at issue as well as a defendant in this part of the case in\n\n24   her individual capacity as a beneficiary.   We're offering her\n\n25   testimony because unlike a lot of cases in civil litigation,\n\n\n                            MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                              (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                        9\n\n\n\n 1   Judge, this case involves real people, and she's kind of the\n\n 2   face of the real people that this case has effected.   And the\n\n 3   Texas Supreme Court has said that those type of stories are\n\n 4   relevant when you're trying to decide what sanctions to grant.\n\n 5               In the Low v. Henry case, and that's 221 S.W.3d,\n\n 6   609, it's a 2007 case out of the Supreme Court of Texas, the\n\n 7   Court cited the American Bar Association's report on standards\n\n 8   and guidelines for practice under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules\n\n 9   of Civil Procedure.   And that is similar to our Rule 13.    And\n\n10   in Footnote 5 of the Court's opinion the Court mentioned in SF\n\n11   that one of the things the Court can rely on in deciding\n\n12   whether to issue sanctions and how much sanctions to issue is,\n\n13   quote, \"The nature and extent of prejudice apart from out of\n\n14   pocket expenses offered by the offended person as a result of\n\n15   the misconduct.\"\n\n16               And so, Your Honor, we're going to offer\n\n17   Ms. Murray's testimony today under the auspices of that\n\n18   footnote from the Texas Supreme Court because she's going to\n\n19   tell the Court exactly how this conduct from Mateo Cortez'\n\n20   attorneys has effected her personally.\n\n21               And then finally we're going to wrap up with my\n\n22   testimony and Mr. Boone's testimony on our attorneys fees.\n\n23   Mr. Boone of course was -- has segregated his fees from this\n\n24   Texas part of the case from -- from what he did in\n\n25   West Virginia and we're only seeking the fees he's incurred\n\n\n                            MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                              (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                        10\n\n\n 1   here in Texas.\n\n 2                Before we get to the evidence, Your Honor, I want\n\n 3   to mention a procedural issue that was raised in the response\n\n 4   to our motion for sanctions which I think was filed late last\n\n 5   week.   The respondents allege that my clients have somehow\n\n 6   waived their right to seek sanctions because they didn't seek\n\n 7   sanctions before the judgment was entered in this matter.\n\n 8   They cite several cases in Footnote 10 of their response.\n\n 9               What they do not tell the Court is that every\n\n10   single one of those cases cited in Footnote 10 is a discovery\n\n11   sanctions case.    This is not a discovery sanctions case.      This\n\n12   is a case involving the substance of their pleadings under\n\n13   Chapter 10, under Rule 13.    And as this Court well knows the\n\n14   Court is free to modify its judgment post judgment to add an\n\n15   award of sanctions.\n\n16               We cited the Texas Supreme Court case on that in\n\n17   our motion and that's the Lane Bank Equipment Company versus\n\n18   Smith Southern Equipment, Inc. case.    That's 10, S.W. 3d, 308.\n\n19   And that case --\n\n20               THE COURT:    And you brought your cases with you?\n\n21               MR. THOMPSON:    I did.   I have one copy of this\n\n22   one, Your Honor.   Would you like me to approach with that?\n\n23               THE COURT:    I would.\n\n24               MR. THOMPSON:    Okay.\n\n25               THE COURT:    Do you need to use it as you're making\n\n\n                              MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                           11\n\n\n\n 1   your presentation?\n\n 2                  MR. THOMPSON:     I don't.   I have another copy of\n\n 3   it.   May I approach?\n\n 4                  THE COURT:     Yes, sir.\n\n 5                  MR. THOMPSON:     Your Honor, we cited this case in a\n\n 6   footnote in our motion stating that the Court -- that once\n\n 7   a -- that once a post -- a post judgment motion for sanctions\n\n 8   is filed that extends the Court's plenary power past 30 days\n\n 9   to decide that motion to essentially -- like a motion for new\n\n10   trial procedurally.     And this is a 2007 case from the Supreme\n\n11   Court that says that.       The Court did not make any issue about\n\n12   waiver or anything like that.       And so, Your Honor, this\n\n13   absolutely stands for the -- the purpose of what we're talking\n\n14   about here which is a post judgment motion to modify the\n\n15   judgment to include sanctions.\n\n16                  It also makes commonsense that you can bring such\n\n17   a motion, maybe not for discovery sanctions because discovery\n\n18   sanctions should be resolved pretrial.        For example, if you\n\n19   don't show up to your deposition the Court should order the\n\n20   person to show up to their deposition.        That's how you remedy\n\n21   a discovery sanction.       But this is based on the entirety of\n\n22   the case, the entirety of Mr. Cortez' case and the underlying\n\n23   substantive claims.     And the only way you're going to know the\n\n24   full extent of the damages caused by that type of sanction is\n\n25   after trial.    Otherwise you're never going to know the damage\n\n\n                                 MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                   (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                       12\n\n\n 1   that it caused.\n\n 2                And again -- so that's what the Lane Bank case\n\n 3   says.   The Lane Bank case says that, you know, post judgment\n\n 4   motion for sanctions is in the -- is in the nature of a motion\n\n 5   to modify and that extends the Court's plenary power.     If\n\n 6   waiver was an issue in that case it would have made much sense\n\n 7   for the Court to hold that.\n\n 8                In addition, Your Honor, this Court regularly\n\n 9   issues sanctions post judgment.   This Court, I believe the one\n\n10   that still stands is this Court's biggest sanctions award ever\n\n11   is the Pool versus Diana case that I was involved in which was\n\n12   upheld on appeal by the Third Court of Appeals.   Petition was\n\n13   denied at the Texas Supreme Court.   And in that case we moved\n\n14   for summary judgment and obtained it against Joe Pool and his\n\n15   clients.   And -- and then the Court a few weeks later issued a\n\n16   post judgment motion for sanctions award.   Nothing about\n\n17   waiver in that case either from the appellate decision.     And\n\n18   that was a much larger award, I believe about $107,000.     And\n\n19   in fact, if you remember the defendants in that case were\n\n20   actually sanctioned on their appeal as well.\n\n21                So I don't see anything in the -- in the appellate\n\n22   case law that says that you waive on substantive sanctions\n\n23   claims if you don't bring them before trial.   And again, it\n\n24   just wouldn't make good sense for that to be the rule because\n\n25   you don't know what the damages are going to be until trial is\n\n\n                            MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                              (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                              13\n\n\n     1   completed.\n\n 2                    And so, Your Honor, that being said, that's kind\n\n 3       of the roadmap of where we're going.      That's the procedural\n\n 4       issue.   I don't know if you want them to respond to the\n\n 5       procedural issue now or if you want to just --\n\n 6                    THE COURT:     I'll let them respond now.\n\n 7                    MR. THOMPSON:     Okay.\n\n 8                    THE COURT:     What is your response, Counselor?\n\n 9                    MR. RUBACK:     Good afternoon, Your Honor.   My name\n\n10       is Chad Ruback, I represent William Brotherton, Sean Hester\n\n11       and the Brotherton Law Firm.      I'm not representing Mr. Cortez.\n\n12       As this Court. correctly noted and counsel has confirmed,\n\n13       Mr. Cortez doesn't have a fight in the -- doesn't have a dog\n\n14       in the fight today, no one is seeking anything from -- he's\n\n15       not seeking anything from anybody.\n\n16                    My response procedurally is first off, the Supreme\n\n17       Court's language, the Supreme Court's pronouncements in a case\n\n18       that was about discovery indeed, didn't limit the Supreme\n\n19       Court's holding to discovery.     The Supreme Court stated, and I\n\n20       quote, \"Waiver bars a trial court from awarding post trial\n\n21       sanctions based on pretrial conduct of which a party was aware\n\n22       before trial,\" end quote.\n\n23                    Yes, admittedly it was a discovery case.      If the\n\n24       Supreme Court wanted to limit its holding to discovery\n\n25       matters, to discovery disputes it certainly could have done\n\n\n                                   MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                     (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                               14\n\n\n     1   so.   There was no limiting language in the Supreme Court's\n\n 2       holding.\n\n 3                    THE COURT:     Do you have a copy of that case for\n\n 4       the Court?\n\n 5                    MR. RUBACK:     I do not, Your Honor.   I believe that\n\n 6       that's a case that both sides had cited.\n\n 7                    THE COURT:     Right.   Okay.\n\n 8                    MR. RUBACK:     I do not have a copy of it.\n\n 9                    THE COURT:    We'll pull it up.\n\n10                    MR. RUBACK:     Furthermore, Your Honor, as counsel\n\n11       has argued, their motion for sanctions is regarding arguments\n\n12       made from the beginning of the case, the totality of the\n\n13       arguments made.    My clients didn't modify their arguments\n\n14       substantively.     They might have refined them somewhat, but my\n\n15       clients have made the same argument from day one in this case.\n\n16                    Admittedly this Court did not agree with my\n\n17       clients' arguments, admittedly this Court granted summary\n\n18       judgment as -- as to the arguments my clients made apparently\n\n19       finding those arguments ultimately not persuasive.         But just\n\n20       because this Court has held that my clients' arguments weren't\n\n21       persuasive, has held that my clients' arguments are wrong does\n\n22       not indicate that my client did not have the right to make\n\n23       those arguments.    Specifically based on counsel's argument\n\n24       that this is not just one argument we're talking about today,\n\n25       this was, you know, the whole conti~uum of arguments made\n\n\n                                   MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                     (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                           15\n\n\n     1   throughout the case.\n\n 2                     If counsel believed that my client was making bad\n\n 3       faith arguments from the initial filing in the case, from each\n\n 4       hearing that this Court has heard in the case, why didn't\n\n 5       counsel bring that to my client's attention?     Why didn't\n\n 6       counsel bring that to the Court's attention?     Laches would bar\n\n 7       the arguments they're making today.\n\n 8                     What they are saying today is my clients made\n\n 9       arguments that were sanctionable long, long ago, but, well,\n\n10       we're going to wait months and months and months to allow my\n\n11       clients to continue to make these arguments that are allegedly\n\n12       sanctionable until after there is a final judgment in the\n\n13       case, after the case is over.\n\n14                     So even if this Court does not believe that it is\n\n15       barred by the Supreme Court's Myer case, which waiver bars a\n\n16       trial court from awarding post trial sanctions based on\n\n17       pretrial conduct of which a party was aware before trial, even\n\n18       if the Court does not find that case persuasive laches would\n\n19       apply here.\n\n20                     There were no brand new arguments made in the\n\n21       case.   My clients have made the same arguments before this\n\n22       Court every time they've been before this Court, every\n\n23       pleading they filed in this case.     Admittedly refined a little\n\n24       bit, but these are the same arguments.\n\n25                     If this Court, who by anyone's estimation is\n\n\n                                 MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                   (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                         16\n\n\n 1   absolutely, positively an expert on trust law, on probate law,\n\n 2   if this Court believed that my client was making sanctionable\n\n 3   arguments as to what the law is from the start, presumably\n\n 4   this Court would have notified my clients, well, guys, you're\n\n 5   getting pretty close to sanctionable conduct here.      This Court\n\n 6   did not do so.\n\n 7               To the contrary in fact, even if this Court has\n\n 8   ruled against my clients' arguments on their substance, this\n\n 9   Court has on the record multiple times thanked my clients for\n\n10   making good arguments.     This Court didn't warn my clients they\n\n11   were on the verge of sanctionable conduct nor did opposing\n\n12   counsel ever warn my clients, ever let the Court know that\n\n13   opposing counsel believed my clients were on the verge of\n\n14   sanctionable conduct.\n\n15               So if my clients have made the same arguments in\n\n16   multiple filings, in multiple hearings before this Court and\n\n17   opposing counsel appears to have waited, let my clients make\n\n18   the same argument again and again and again, laid behind the\n\n19   log until after there is a final judgment in the case laches\n\n20   would bar sanctions in this situation, Your Honor.\n\n21               THE COURT:    Okay.   You want to get back now to\n\n22   your --\n\n23               MR. THOMPSON:    Well,   I want to point out first of\n\n24   all that laches has never been pled.     So this is the first\n\n25   time I've ever heard that argument about that.\n\n\n                              MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                             17\n\n\n 1                  THE COURT:     So noted.\n\n 2                  MR. THOMPSON:     And I have a copy of the Myer case\n\n 3   if you'd like to see it.\n\n 4                  THE COURT:     Okay.   Good.\n\n 5                  MR. THOMPSON:     And I've highlighted where the\n\n 6   Court says, you know, we -- in Rernmington Arms which is\n\n 7   another case I have I can give you, Judge -- in Remmington\n\n 8   Arms we explain the circumstances in which by failing to\n\n 9   obtain a pretrial ruling on a discovery dispute a party waives\n\n10   his or her claim for discovery abuse sanctions.         This whole\n\n11   case is about discovery.       Remmington Arms case that is cited\n\n12   there is all about discovery.         Every single one of the cases\n\n13   cited in their footnote, Judge, are about discovery.        And\n\n14   that's because they can't find a case regarding substantive\n\n15   claims, that type of sanctions that supports their waiver\n\n16   argument.     It would make absolutely no sense if that was the\n\n17   law.\n\n18                 THE COURT:     You may present you all's cases.     You\n\n19   may continue on with your argument.\n\n20                 MR. THOMPSON:     Your Honor, we'll call William\n\n21   Brotherton.\n\n22                 THE COURT:     How many witnesses are we going to\n\n23   have here today?\n\n24                 MR.

And do you agree with me that under both of those\n\n19   authorities the triggering event for sanctioning lawyers is\n\n20   the signing of a pleading that is sanctionable?\n\n21        A.     I believe that's correct.\n\n22        Q.     Do you understand that under Civil Practices and\n\n23   Remedies Code, Chapter 10 that when you sign a pleading you're\n\n24   certifying to the Court that each claim in that pleading\n\n25   was -- and I quote -- \"Warranted by existing law or by a\n\n\n                             MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                               (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                               20\n\n\n     1   non-frivolous argument for the extension, modification or\n\n 2       reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law,\" end\n\n 3       quote?\n\n 4             A.      If you've read that correctly, I have no reason to\n\n 5       deny that.\n\n 6             Q.      Okay.   Would you like to see it?\n\n 7            A.       No, that's fine.\n\n 8            Q.       Okay.   So you don't have any reason to doubt that\n\n 9       I read it accurately?\n\n10            A.       If you're essentially reading it out as -- and\n\n11       representing to the Court that that's what it is then I have\n\n12       no reason to doubt that.\n\n13            Q.       Okay.   And in looking at the pleadings in this\n\n14       matter I didn't see that your client had made any argument for\n\n15       the extension, modification or reversal of existing law or the\n\n16       establishment of new law.     Is that fair?\n\n17            A.       You know, I -- I couldn't say yes or no.\n\n18            Q.       Okay.   It seems to me that most of the claims that\n\n19       you brought      or all of the claims that you brought on behalf\n\n20       of your client were based on Texas law as it exists now.        You\n\n21       weren't saying that law should change, were you?\n\n22            A.       Again -- and I've got to say over the last six\n\n23       months I've spent most of my time in North Dakota so I haven't\n\n24       been involved in this case in a little while.     So you may want\n\n25       to talk with Mr. Hester about some of those technical issues.\n\n\n                                  MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                    (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                         21\n\n\n 1            Q.   Okay.   Well, you understand that you've signed\n\n 2   every pleading except for one with regard to the claims made\n\n 3   against my clients?\n\n 4        A.       Correct.\n\n 5            Q.   Whether you were in North Dakota or not?\n\n 6        A.       Correct.\n\n 7        Q.       And Mr. Hester signed one of them; is that right?\n\n 8        A.       Correct.\n\n 9        Q.       Okay.   And so I'm asking you, can you think of an\n\n10   example where you were asking this Court to change the law or\n\n11   to modify the law or any of those things in any of your\n\n12   pleadings?\n\n13        A.       I -- again, I wouldn't be able to say yes or no.\n\n14   I don't believe so but I can't say definitively.\n\n15        Q.       Okay.   Now, I'm going to hand you\n\n16                 MR. THOMPSON:    May I approach the witness, Your\n\n17   Honor?\n\n18                 THE COURT:    You may.\n\n19        Q.       (By Mr. Thompson)    I'm going to hand you a series\n\n20   of documents.    We don't have to mark them as an exhibit\n\n21   because they're pleadings.      But starting with the first\n\n22   document, you see the title of that is Original Petition In\n\n23   Intervention?\n\n24        A.       Yes.\n\n25        Q.       Okay.   Are you familiar with this document?\n\n\n                                MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                  (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                          22\n\n\n     1         A.    I am.\n\n     2         Q.    And if you turn to the next to last page which is\n\n     3   Page 5, is that your signature?\n\n     4         A.    Yes, it is.\n\n     5         Q.    Okay.   And if you look at Page 3 of this original\n\n     6   petition, petition in intervention, just below the middle of\n\n 7       the page there is a No. 2.     And you state -- and this is of\n\n 8       course under a heading that says \"declaratory judgment.\"\n\n 9       You're seeking a declaration that pursuant to the trust\n\n10       Article 8, Section D2, upon the death of Phyllis Short,\n\n11       Deborah Cortez as beneficiary under the trust was entitled to\n\n12       the balance of her trust share including both principal and\n\n13       any accrued and undistributed income because she was over the\n\n14       age of 35 years at the time.    Do you see that statement?\n\n15            A.     Yes.\n\n16            Q.     Can you explain to the Court in your words what\n\n17       you were alleging in that statement on behalf of your client?\n\n18            A.     Well, the trust essentially stated -- and I can\n\n19       give it to you in -- in the context of what I understand it to\n\n20       say, and as you've stated, there is a question of the\n\n21       interpretation as I think you testified, but the -- what we\n\n22       believed was a colorable argument was that Ms. Cortez was\n\n23       entitled to the contents of the trust once she reached\n\n24       35 years of age once her parents died.\n\n25            Q.     Okay.   And just to be sure, there is no question\n\n\n                                MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                  (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                          23\n\n\n 1   that Ms. Cortez was over the age of 35 at the time Phyllis\n\n 2   Short died, correct?\n\n 3         A.       I believe that's correct,    yes.\n\n 4         Q.      And it was Phyllis Short's death that then gave\n\n 5   Deborah Cortez the ability to seek distributions under the\n\n 6   trust?     I know we have a difference of opinion about what\n\n 7   those distributions were, but that was the triggering event,\n\n 8   correct?\n\n 9        A.       That's my understanding, yes.\n\n10                 MR. THOMPSON:    Okay.   May I approach, Your Honor?\n\n11                 THE COURT:    You may, sir.\n\n12        Q.        (By Mr. Thompson)   Mr. Brotherton,   I'm going to\n\n13   give you as what I've marked as Exhibit No. 1.       There you go.\n\n14   Are you familiar with the document I marked Exhibit l?\n\n15        A.       I have seen it, yes.\n\n16        Q.       And what is that document?\n\n17        A.       It's one of the versions of the revokable living\n\n18   trust, the Short -- William Short and Phyllis Short.\n\n19        Q.       Okay.   And I think that -- is it fair to say that\n\n20   this was the most recent version of that document?\n\n21        A.       I believe that's correct.\n\n22                 MR. THOMPSON:    Your Honor, we -- we offer\n\n23   Exhibit 1.\n\n24                 (Movant's Exhibit No. 1\n\n25                 was offered into evidence.)\n\n\n                                MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                  (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                                 24\n\n\n 1                    THE COURT:     Any objection?\n\n 2                    MR. RUBACK:     No objection, Your Honor.\n\n 3                    THE COURT:     No. 1 will be admitted.\n\n 4                    (Movant's Exhibit No. 1\n\n 5                    was admitted into evidence.)\n\n 6           Q.       (By Mr. Thompson)     and, Mr. Brotherton, I may\n\n 7   refer to this shorthand as \"the trust\" throughout today.               Is\n\n 8   that         you'll understand\n\n 9           A.       That's fine.\n\n10           Q.       Okay.   If you turn to Page 5 of Exhibit 1, if you\n\n11   look at Section D which I believe is Article 8, Section D,\n\n12   postponement of possession.          Do you see that?\n\n13           A.       I do.\n\n14           Q.      Okay.    Is that the provision and everything under\n\n15   it that you think supports the claim that we've been\n\n16   discussing?\n\n17           A.       I believe that's correct.\n\n18           Q.      And if I recall that, I think you guys have called\n\n19   it in the past the postponement provision claim?             Is that\n\n20   fair?    You'll understand what I'm talking about when I say\n\n21   that?\n\n22           A.      I think so, yes.\n\n23           Q.      Okay.    So do you see that this statement,\n\n24   postponement of possession, it says, \"If any beneficiary is\n\n25   under the age of 35 years at the time he or she becomes\n\n\n                                   MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                     (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                      25\n\n\n 1   entitled to distribution, his or her share shall be maintained\n\n 2   in a continuing trust which shall be administered as follows.\"\n\n 3   Do you see that statement?\n\n 4        A.     I do.\n\n 5        Q.     And again, there is no question in this case that\n\n 6   Deborah Cortez was not a beneficiary under the age of 35 years\n\n 7   at the time she became entitled to distribution from the\n\n 8   trust, correct?\n\n 9        A.     Rephrase your question?\n\n10        Q.     You see that this statement here says -- the\n\n11   qualifying language is that if any beneficiary is under the\n\n12   age of 35 y2ars at the time he or she becomes entitled to\n\n13   possession, then X, Y and Z.    Do you see that?\n\n14        A.     Entitled to distribution?\n\n15        Q.     Yes.\n\n16        A.     \"His or her share shall be maintained in a\n\n17   continuous -- in a continuing trust which shall be\n\n18   administered as follows.\"    Is that what you're referring to?\n\n19        Q.     Do you see that statement?\n\n20        A.     I do.\n21        Q.     Okay.   And there is no dispute in this matter that\n\n22   Deborah Cortez was over the age of 35 at the time she became\n\n23   entitled to distribution, correct?\n\n24        A.     I don't know if I can agree with that statement.\n\n25   I'm not sure what you're asking me to agree with.\n\n\n                            MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                              (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                        26\n\n\n 1           Q.    Okay.   Well, when was -- what was the\n\n 2   triggering -- I thought we'd been through this, but what was\n\n 3   the triggering event that entitled Deborah Cortez to a\n\n 4   distribution under this trust?     Was it not her mother's death?\n\n 5           A.    Correct.\n\n 6           Q.    Okay.   And is there any dispute that at the time\n\n 7   Phyllis Short died, Deborah Cortez' mother died, that Deborah\n\n 8   was over the age of 35?\n\n 9           A.    As I understand it, yes.\n\n10           Q.    Okay.   In fact, she was over the age of 35 when\n\n11   this document was executed, correct?\n\n12           A.    Correct.   Well, I believe so.\n\n13           Q.    Well, sir, I can actually point out in your\n\n14   pleadings where you stated this?\n\n15           A.    Okay.\n\n16           Q.    So do you disagree with me or no?\n\n17           A.    No.\n\n18           Q.    Okay.   So if this provision, the qualifying\n\n19   language of this provision is that you have to be under the\n\n20   age of 35 in order for all of these things to apply to you,\n\n21   how could you possibly think that this section applies to\n\n22   Deborah Cortez and entitles her to the entirety of the trust?\n\n23           A.   Well, there is -- there is a lot of language in\n\n24   here.    I think we've used several arguments in this.   We've\n\n25   consulted with a trust expert on this.     And so based on -- on\n\n\n                              MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                          27\n\n\n 1   the language in this, it's our contention that Deborah Cortez\n\n 2   was entitled to the trust proceeds.\n\n 3          Q.     What trust expert did you consult with on this?\n\n 4          A.     Dick Kelsey.\n\n 5          Q.     Okay.    And Mr. Kelsey told you that your\n\n 6   interpretation of this trust, this provision of this trust was\n\n 7   correct?\n\n 8          A.     That is correct.\n\n 9          Q.     Okay.    So you said there is some particular\n\n10   language in here that supports your argument.      Tell me what\n\n11   that language is.\n\n12          A.     Well,   there is -- there is certainly the\n\n13   provisions in regards to if any assets of the trust remained\n\n14   undistributed upon Deborah's death, or if she fails to survive\n\n15   us,   the remainder of the trust estate shall be distributed as\n\n16   follows.    And clearly Deborah Cortez was the beneficiary of\n\n17   the Shorts and was an heir at law.\n\n18          Q.     Okay.   Well, you understand that that -- that's\n\n19   kind of one of the claims that you made, but in the\n\n20   alternative you also made this claim about this 35 year-old\n\n21   provision, correct?\n\n22          A.     Well,   I think I -- like I say, I have been working\n\n23   out of state quite a bit and I think i t would be helpful if I\n\n24   had a copy of the -- of the claims that we've made because\n\n25   you're asking me to recollect a very complex document.        So I\n\n\n                               MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                 (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                           28\n\n\n     1   don't want to sit here and misstate --\n\n 2             Q.    Okay.\n\n 3             A.    -- what was in our pleadings.\n\n 4             Q.    Okay.    Well, sir, you have all of your pleadings\n\n 5       in front of you.    What I've given you is -- although we've\n\n 6       just been over the original petition in intervention and --\n\n 7       and in that section we went through this No. 2, which says\n\n 8       \"Pursuant to the trust, Article 8, Section D2, upon Phyllis\n\n 9       Short's death Deborah Cortez inherited the balance because she\n\n10       was over the age of 35.\"    I thought we agreed that that's\n\n11       basically the claim that we're talking about?\n\n12            A.     Okay.\n\n13            Q.     Okay.    So let's set aside the heir at law issue.\n\n14       As I told the Judge earlier I actually have been convinced now\n\n15       that that is a colorable claim.    I'm not asking for sanctions\n\n16       against you today because of that.   But I do want to\n\n17       concentrate on this Article 8, Section D2 provision.     And I\n\n18       thought you had said that in addition to the language that I\n\n19       have read in -- into the record, that there is additional\n\n20       language in here that you believe supports your position and I\n\n21       would like to know what that language is.\n\n22            A.     Well,   I need a few minutes to go through and look\n\n23       through    look through the petition.\n\n24            Q.     Okay.   And while you -- while you do that\n\n25       before you do that, and I'll give you all the time in the\n\n\n                                 MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                   (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                           29\n\n\n 1   world, will you agree with me that this claim -- maybe in\n\n 2   different words, but the gist of this claim has been in every\n\n 3   petition that you've filed since that original petition?\n\n 4           A.   I couldn't say yes or no.\n\n 5           Q.   Okay.   Well, while you're looking through the\n\n 6   trust document, look through those amended petitions that I\n\n 7   have for you up there and then you can answer that question as\n\n 8   well.\n\n 9                MR. THOMPSON:     Your Honor?\n\n10                THE COURT:     Yes.\n\n11                MR. THOMPSON:     May I be excused just to get some\n\n12   water very quickly while he's --\n\n13                THE COURT:    You may be.     We'll take a five minute\n\n14   recess.\n\n15                MR. THOMPSON:     Thank you, Judge.\n\n16                (Brief recess.)\n\n17                THE COURT:    Are you ready now?\n\n18                MR. RUBACK:     Yes.\n\n19                THE COURT:    Our witness will please come back up.\n\n20                MR. THOMPSON:     Judge, you had asked for case law.\n\n21   Can I approach with one more case?\n\n22                THE COURT:    Yes.     And if you'll give me your\n\n23   packet there that he was using.        Is there another copy of\n\n24   that?\n\n25                MR. THOMPSON:     Absolutely.    Give me one second.\n\n\n                               MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                 (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                              30\n\n\n 1   Well, I say that.      Are you\n\n 2                  THE COURT:     He took up his binder with the\n\n 3   pleadings.\n\n 4                  MR. THOMPSON:     Would you like his copy now?\n\n 5                  THE COURT:     Sure.\n\n 6                  MR. THOMPSON:     I think we'll be talking about the\n\n 7   same thing.\n\n 8                  THE COURT:    Right.\n\n 9                  MR. THOMPSON:     Just so you know, what that is is\n\n10   the original petition and then there were four amended.            So\n\n11   five in all.\n\n12                  THE COURT:    Right.      I'm aware.\n\n13                  MR. THOMPSON:     Okay.     May I proceed, Your Honor?\n\n14                  THE COURT:    Yes, sir.\n\n15        Q.        (By Mr. Thompson)      Mr. Brotherton, before the\n\n16   break I had given you a stack of pleadings that are the\n\n17   Original Petition in Intervention and then the first,          second,\n\n18   third and fourth amended version of that document.           Did you\n\n19   have a chance to review those?\n\n20        A.        Primarily the Motion to Reconsider.\n\n21        Q.        Okay.   My question before the break was whether\n\n22   you would agree with me that this postponement provision claim\n\n23   had been made in those five pleadings that I just named.           Will\n\n24   you agree with me to that now?           Or do we need to go through\n\n25   each and every one of these?\n\n\n                                 MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                   (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                       31\n\n\n 1         A.    Probably need to go through each and every one.\n\n 2   Because here is the thing       just to explain this, you know,\n\n 3   I've got six attorneys counting myself plus various other\n\n 4   attorneys that we use if -- if we need to -- to get special\n\n 5   legal counsel.   And so in this case -- this is obviously a\n\n 6   pretty complex case, and I'm not going to sit here and try and\n\n 7   be able to go through every page, line-by-line of every copy\n\n 8   of the pleadings and be able to talk just absolutely clear on\n\n 9   everything, especially in light of the fact that I'd been\n\n10   involved in some other substantial cases out of state.      So\n\n11   certainly I'll try to answer your question, but as far as\n\n12   going through every pleading and talking about what\n\n13   specifically in each pleading, we'll probably need to go\n\n14   through each one.\n\n15        Q.     Okay.   Well, will you agree with me that you\n\n16   signed all five of those pleadings as the attorney of record\n\n17   in this case for Mr. Cortez?\n\n18        A.     Well, again,    I'd say that as the lead counsel I\n\n19   have a number of people working for me and so yes\n\n20               MR. THOMPSON:     Objection, Your Honor,\n\n21   nonresponsive.\n\n22               THE COURT:     Sustain the objection.\n\n23        Q.     (By Mr. Thompson)     Sir, did you sign\n\n24        A.     I said yes.\n\n25        Q.     -- attorney of record -- I'm sorry?\n\n\n                              MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                         32\n\n\n 1         A.     I said yes.\n\n 2         Q.     I didn't hear you say yes to that.\n\n 3         A.     I did.\n\n 4         Q.     So I think we've established that it's in the\n\n 5   original petition.    Can we agree to that?\n\n 6         A.     I believe so.\n\n 7         Q.     The Original Petition in Intervention?\n\n 8        A.      I believe so.\n\n 9        Q.      Do you have the First Amended Petition in\n\n10   Intervention in front of you?\n\n11        A.      You know what, this -- this only starts on the\n\n12   fourth.\n\n13                MR. THOMPSON:    Your Honor, I can -- if you don't\n\n14   mind me standing beside him I can --\n\n15                THE COURT:    You can do that.\n\n16        Q.      (By Mr. Thompson)    Okay.   So I'm going to approach\n\n17   with the First Amended Petition in Intervention.      The first\n\n18   question I'm going to ask you is -- there is the title, First\n\n19   Amended Petition in Intervention and Third Party Petition\n\n20   filed on December 30th, 2015.     My first question for you, sir,\n\n21   is    Melissa, can you hear me okay?      On Page 8 is that your\n\n22   signature?\n\n23        A.      It is.\n\n24        Q.      And there you're signing on behalf of several\n\n25   lawyers but you're signing as the lawyer signing this\n\n\n                               MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                 (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                             33\n\n\n 1   petition; is that right?\n\n 2            A.   Right.\n\n 3            Q.   Okay.    If you look on Page 6, Section 2, there is\n\n 4   a statement I believe that is verbatim, identical to the\n\n 5   statement in the Original Petition in Intervention.          Can you\n\n 6   read that No. 2 into the record, please, sir?\n\n 7            A.   \"That pursuant to the trust, Article 3,\n\n 8   Section D2, upon the death of Phyllis D. Short, Deborah Cortez\n\n 9   as a beneficiary under the trust was entitled to the balance\n\n10   of her trust share including both principal and any accrued,\n\n11   undistributed income because she was over the age of 35 years\n\n12   at the tL.1e.\"\n\n13         Q.      Okay.    So we agree\n\n14                 THE COURT:     Now     now, let me stop a second.\n\n15   Would you look again?      It's not Article 3, but is it not\n\n16   Article 8?\n\n17                 THE WITNESS:     I -- I can't quite read it.     Let me\n\n18   check.\n\n19                 THE COURT:     You don't have your glasses on?\n\n20                 THE WITNESS:     Well, it's blocked.    All right.   Now\n\n21   I can see it.    Article 8.    Roman numeral eight.     Correct.\n\n22   Thank you, Judge.\n\n23        Q.       (By Mr. Thompson)      So now would you agree with me\n\n24   that we call the postponement provision claim is indeed in the\n\n25   First Amended Petition?\n\n\n                                MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                  (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                        34\n\n\n 1         A.     Correct.\n\n 2         Q.     Okay.    So now I'm going to approach with the\n\n 3   Second Amended Petition.     Same drill.     On Page 12 is that\n\n 4   again your signature signing as Mr. Cortez' attorney of\n\n 5   record?\n\n 6        A.      Correct.    Correct.\n\n 7        Q.      And if you will look at Page 8, this No. 2\n\n 8   paragraph here,    I believe again is the same statement that you\n\n 9   just read into the record.      Do you agree with me?\n\n10        A.      That is correct.\n\n11        Q.      Okay.    So again, this postponement provision claim\n\n12   appears in the Second Amended Petition in Intervention?\n\n13        A.      Correct.\n\n14        Q.      I'm going to approach with the Third Amended\n\n15   Petition.   And again, is that your signature on Page 26      --\n16        A.      It is.\n\n17        Q.           as Mr. Cortez' attorney?\n\n18        A.      Right.\n\n19        Q.      Okay.    This one may take me a second.    It's a\n\n20   little bigger.    Again, I think in the Paragraph 2 on\n\n21   Page 18 -- I'm sorry.    My apology.   If you read that -- you\n\n22   don't have to read it into the record, but will you agree with\n\n23   me that that's the same claim?\n\n24        A.      It is the same.\n\n25        Q.     Okay.     So again, just to make sure that that\n\n\n                              MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                              35\n\n\n     1   postponement provision claim also appears in the Third Amended\n\n 2       Petition?\n\n 3             A.       Correct.\n\n 4             Q.       Okay.   When did this North Dakota case start being\n\n 5       your main focus at work that took you away from this case?\n\n 6             A.       Late April.\n\n 7             Q.       Late April of 2016?\n\n 8            A.        '16.\n\n 9            Q.        Okay.   I'm going to approach with the Fourth\n\n10       Amended Petition in Intervention, Page 25.         Again, you're\n\n11       signing on behalf of your client Mateo Cortez, correct?\n\n12            A.        Correct.\n\n13            Q.        And again, if you look at this Paragraph 2, is\n\n14       that that same postponement      --\n15                      THE COURT:    What page?\n\n16                      MR. THOMPSON:    I'm sorry.    Page 17, Your Honor.\n\n17            Q.        (By Mr. Thompson)      Is that that same\n\n18       postponement    --\n19            A.        Appears to be the same.\n\n20            Q.        And this doesn't have a file stamp on it, but I\n\n21       want to point out the certificate of service on this document.\n\n22       November 2nd, 2016.       Do you see that?\n\n23            A.        Correct.\n\n24            Q.        And this is your signature here?\n\n25            A.        Yes.\n\n\n                                     MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                       (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                          36\n\n\n 1         Q.       And although it doesn't have a file stamp, can we\n\n 2   assume that this was filed on or about November 2nd, 2016?\n\n 3         A.       I believe that's fair.\n\n 4         Q.       Is it your practice to file things at the same\n\n 5   time or around the same time as the certificate of service\n\n 6   reflects?\n\n 7        A.        Correct.\n\n 8        Q.        Okay.   And so November of 2016 was well after you\n\n 9   had become involved in this North Dakota case, correct?\n\n10        A.        Correct.\n\n11        Q.        And you're still signing pleadings as the attorney\n\n12   of record on behalf of your client Mateo Cortez?\n\n13        A.        Well, I'm not up there full-time, but it's\n\n14   certainly       I've -- like any attorney you're involved in\n\n15   other cases.     And again, I've got a staff that did the\n\n16   research and was preparing the documents and I reviewed them.\n\n17   But certainly -- the reason I mentioned North Dakota is\n\n18   because I haven't been able to live and breathe this case\n\n19   probably as much as I would like.\n\n20        Q.        Okay.   I should have done this earlier but I'm\n\n21   just going to approach with\n\n22                  MR. THOMPSON:    If you don't mind, Your Honor, may\n\n23   I approach?\n\n24                  THE COURT:    You may.\n\n25                  MR. THOMPSON:    I'll give you a copy as well.\n\n\n                                 MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                   (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                         37\n\n\n 1         Q.       (By Mr. Thompson)   This is a copy of Chapter 10 of\n\n 2   the Civil Practices and Remedies Code which as I mentioned,\n\n 3   this is the authority we're relying on to seek sanctions.      In\n\n 4   Section 10.001 it states that the signing of a pleading\n\n 5   constitutes a certificate by the signatory, that due to the\n\n 6   signatory's best knowledge,    information and belief formed\n\n 7   after reasonable inquiry, and then No. 2, each claim in the\n\n 8   pleading is warranted by existing law, dot, dot, dot.      I think\n\n 9   I've been through this provision at nauseam.     Do you see that?\n\n10        A.       I do.\n\n11        Q.       Okay.   In signing these pleadings that we've just\n\n12   been through, did you understand that you were certifying to\n\n13   this Court that each claim in that pleading was warranted by\n\n14   existing law or by non-frivolous argument to the extension,\n\n15   modification or reversal of existing law?\n\n16        A.       Absolutely.   And they were colorable claims and I\n\n17   still believe that.\n\n18        Q.       Okay.   Regardless of your involvement in the\n\n19   North Dakota case you still believe that?\n\n20        A.       Correct.\n\n21        Q.       Okay.   What reasonable inquiry did you do to\n\n22   inform yourself of whether this postponement provision claim\n\n23   met the standards of the Civil Practices and Remedies Code,\n\n24   Chapter 10?\n\n25        A.       We did quite a bit of research, LexisNexis, talked\n\n\n                              MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                            38\n\n\n     1   with attorneys in the firm, we conferenced on it, and then we\n\n     2   went and met with one of the premiere trust attorneys in the\n\n 3       state.\n\n 4                Q.   And, I'm sorry, you said his name but can you say\n\n 5       it one more time?\n\n 6                A.   Dick Kelsey.\n\n 7                Q.   I'm sorry?\n\n 8            A.       Dick Kelsey.\n\n 9             Q.      Dick Kelsey.\n\n10             Q.      Is it K-e-1-s-e-y?\n\n11            A.       Correct.     He's in Denton.   I think he's board\n\n12       certified in four or five areas.\n\n13            Q.       Okay.   And I think you alluded to this, but am I\n\n14       correct that it's -- it's your belief that the specific\n\n15       language of Article 8, Section Dis what entitles Deborah\n\n16       Cortez to recover under this postponement claim; is that\n\n17       right?\n\n18            A.       That's my understanding, yes.\n\n19            Q.       Okay.   And I've been through some language, but I\n\n20       think before the break you had said there was some additional\n\n21       language in this section that you thought entitled her to\n\n22       distribution.    And I want to ask you again, can you show me in\n\n23       Exhibit 1\n\n24            A.       Well\n\n25            Q.       -- the language that you're relying on?\n\n\n                                    MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                      (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                         39\n\n\n     1         A.    -- the fact is she was the only child, she was the\n\n 2       only beneficiary, she was the only heir at law.\n\n 3             Q.    Okay.\n\n 4             A.    The trust specifically references that the trust\n\n 5       was -- was written solely for the benefit of Deborah Cortez\n\n 6       for health, safety, welfare.\n\n 7             Q.    Where does it say that last -- I want you to point\n\n 8       out in Exhibit 1 where this trust says it was written solely\n\n 9       for the benefit of Deborah Cortez.\n\n10            A.     I'm probably paraphrasing a little bit.\n\n11            Q.     Okay.    Well, show me the provision that you\n\n12       believe you're paraphrasing?\n\n13            A.     Well, take a second to look through the trust.\n\n14            Q.     Well, sir, I thought that's what we had taken a\n\n15       break to do earlier?\n\n16            A.     Well, you asked me to look at the pleadings.\n\n17            Q.     And you don't do that either, sir.\n\n18            A.     Well, I did.\n\n19            Q.     So show me where in this trust document it says\n\n20       that this trust is written exclusively for the benefit of\n\n21       Deborah Cortez, or whatever you think you've paraphrased.\n\n22            A.     Well, you could start with Article 2, family,\n\n23       children, \"We have one child of our marriage, Deborah A.\n\n24       Cortez, an adult.\"     In 10, \"Our primary concern during\n\n25       Deborah's life is for her health, support, education, welfare\n\n\n                                  MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                    (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                       40\n\n\n 1   and best interest, and the trustee need not consider the\n\n 2   interest of any other beneficiaries in making distributions to\n\n 3   her or on her behalf for those purposes under this paragraph.\"\n\n 4        Q.     Okay.    Let me ask you about that.   It says that\n\n 5   our primary concern during Deborah's life is for these things.\n\n 6   Doesn't that suggest that they had a different concern after\n\n 7   Deborah died?\n\n 8        A.     Are you saying it's ambiguous?\n\n 9        Q.     No,   sir.   I'm saying when this says \"our primary\n\n10   concern is this during Deborah's life,\" doesn't that suggest\n\n11   that there may be another primary concern after Deborah dies?\n\n12        A.     Not necessarily.\n\n13        Q.     Anything else that you can find that supports your\n\n14   statement that this trust was written solely for the benefit\n\n15   of Deborah Cortez?\n\n16        A.     Yeah, the 10 part is the biggest part.\n\n17        Q.     The part about Deborah's life?\n\n18        A.     Right.\n\n19        Q.     And again, back to my original question, is there\n\n20   any other language in that D portion,   the postponement of\n\n21   possession portion, that you believe supports this\n\n22   postponement provision claim?\n\n23        A.     You're talking about in the trust?\n\n24        Q.     Well, sir, the claim cites in every single one of\n\n25   the pleadings that we looked at, the claim cites Article 8,\n\n\n                              MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                              41\n\n\n     1   Section D to support this claim.       And I'm asking you, can you\n\n 2       point out what language you believe in Article 8, Section D\n\n 3       supports this claim?       And that's on Page 5 of the trust.\n\n 4             A.      Well,   I mean, whatever we put in our pleadings\n\n 5       is -- is      addresses that.     I'm not going to sit here and try\n\n 6       and explain it all to you at this point because certainly\n\n 7       we've outlined in our pleadings, we've consulted with\n\n 8       necessary experts and we believe every claim we've made is\n\n 9       colorable.\n\n10             Q.      Was Mr. Kelsey going to testify in this case if it\n\n11       had reached trial as an expert?\n\n12            A.       I hadn't made that decision yet.\n\n13            Q.       He certainly was never designated as an expert,\n\n14       was he?\n\n15            A.       Correct.\n\n16                     MR. THOMPSON:     I'm going to approach if you don't\n\n17       mind, Your Honor, with Exhibit 2?\n\n18                     THE COURT:    You may approach.\n\n19            Q.       (By Mr. Thompson} Now, Mr. Brotherton, you've made\n\n20       this same claim in a matter pending in a West Virginia court,\n\n21       correct?\n\n22            A.       Well -- and that's not a simple yes or no\n\n23       question.    As you know this whole lawsuit here was brought\n\n24       about by Ms. Murray filing suit against Mr. Cortez.      We again,\n\n25       doing our due diligence on this case and investigating and\n\n\n                                    MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                      (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                         42\n\n\n 1   doing everything we needed to do to determine that we had\n\n 2   claims that could be colorable on this, we filed our petition\n\n 3   in intervention.    During the course of the litigation in this\n\n 4   case, after Judge Herman directed that we bring in all the\n\n 5   third party defendants and the churches that were addressed in\n\n 6   the trust, suit was filed by Ms. Murray in West Virginia.      So\n\n 7   everything that was done in West Virginia was of course\n\n 8   similar to what we were doing here in addressing the same\n\n 9   claims.\n\n10               MR. THOMPSON:     I'm going to object to that as\n\n11   nonresponsive, Judge.\n\n12               THE COURT:     Sustained.\n\n13        Q.     (By Mr. Thompson)     Sir, did you allege in the\n\n14   West Virginia case that under Article 8, Section D2 of the\n\n15   trust, because Deborah was over the age of 35 when Phyllis\n\n16   Short died then she inherited all the trust assets and Cortez\n\n17   as her sole heir then inherited all the trust assets?\n\n18        A.     That's -- that's part of our claims, yes.\n\n19        Q.     In West Virginia?\n\n20        A.     Correct.\n\n21        Q.     Okay.   So that's virtually identical to the\n\n22   postponement claim we've been talking about here today?\n\n23        A.     Correct.\n\n24        Q.     Is that a yes?\n\n25        A.     That's the way I understand it, yes.\n\n\n                              MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                              43\n\n\n     1         Q.        Okay.   And the Judge in the West Virginia case\n\n     2   issued a summary judgment against that claim, correct?\n\n 3             A.        I believe so, yes.\n\n 4             Q.    Okay.       And do you recall the date of that being\n\n 5       September 15th, 2016?\n\n 6             A.        I -- I'm not sure.\n\n 7             Q.    Okay.       Exhibit 2 that I put in front of you is\n\n 8       actually a copy of that summary judgment, do you agree?        Do\n\n 9       you agree with me that that's a copy of the summary judgment?\n\n10             A.    If you are representing that it is I have no\n\n11       reason to doubt you.\n\n12                   MR. THOMPSON:      Your Honor, I have a copy for you\n\n13       if you'd like me to approach?\n\n14            Q.         (By Mr. Thompson)    Well, if you look at the last\n\n15       page of this document, Page 9, do you see that was entered on\n\n16       September the 15th, 2016 and purports to be signed by Robert\n\n17       A. Waters, Judge?\n\n18            A.     Correct.\n\n19            Q.     And is that the judge in the West Virginia case?\n\n20            A.     Correct.\n\n21                   MR. THOMPSON:      Your Honor, we'd ask for admission\n\n22       of Exhibit 2.     And counsel may not know, but the Court does\n\n23       have on file a certified copy of this with all the nuts and\n\n24       bolts that goes into that from an earlier hearing.       So we'd\n\n25       ask that Exhibit 2 be admitted.\n\n\n                                   MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                     (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                                 44\n\n\n     1                   (Movant' s Exhibit No. 2\n\n 2                   was offered into evidence.)\n\n 3                   THE COURT:      Any objection?\n\n 4                   MR. RUBACK:      No objection, Your Honor.\n\n 5                   THE COURT:      No. 2 is admitted.\n\n 6                   (Movant's Exhibit No. 2\n\n 7                   was admitted into evidence.)\n\n 8             Q.    (By Mr. Thompson)      All right.     If you turn to\n\n 9       Page 8 of Exhibit 2, Paragraph 29.         Do you see that\n\n10       Judge Waters recites Mateo Cortez' claim saying that Mateo\n\n11       Cortez argues that he is the sole beneficiary of the trust and\n\n12       entitled to the distribution of all trust asseta because\n\n13       Article 8, Section D2 of the trust states that when such\n\n14       beneficiary reaches the age of 35 -- and then it goes through\n\n15       that postponement provision.      Do you see that?\n\n16            A.     I do.\n\n17            Q.     Okay.     And do you see in the middle of that\n\n18       paragraph, starting with the plain language of Section D?          Do\n\n19       you see that?\n\n20            A.     I do.\n\n21            Q.     Can you read that sentence into the record,\n\n22       please?\n\n23            A.     \"The plain language of Section D of the trust,\n\n24       however, only applies if any beneficiary is under the age of\n\n25       35 years at the time he or she becomes entitled to\n\n\n                                  MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                    (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                     45\n\n\n 1   distribution.\"\n\n 2         Q.    And can you read the next sentence, please?\n\n 3         A.    \"Deborah was not entitled to distribution until\n\n 4   Ms. Short died, at which time Deborah was 54 years old and\n\n 5   thus none of the provisions of Section D applied to her\n\n 6   interest in the trust.\"\n\n 7        Q.     And the next sentence?\n\n 8        A.     \"Rather the plain language of the trust shows that\n\n 9   Section B governed Deborah's interests.\"\n\n10        Q.     And one last time, the next sentence?\n\n11        A.     \"Indeed, at the time the trust was executed\n\n12   Deborah was 42 years old.     This further demonstrates that\n\n13   Section D was not intended to apply to the trust created for\n\n14   Deborah, but instead to the alternate distribution to the\n\n15   heirs at law, Mr. and Mrs. Short under Section C of the\n\n16   trust.\"\n\n17        Q.     Okay.   Were you aware of Judge Waters' order and\n\n18   his findings in this Exhibit 2 on or about September 15th,\n\n19   2016 when it was entered?\n\n20        A.     I was there at the hearing.      I think I\n\n21   subsequently saw the order.    West Virginia has a little\n\n22   different rules on how they produce an order.\n\n23        Q.     Okay.   Well, but is it fair to say that you became\n\n24   aware of the findings in this document somewhere around\n\n25   September 15th, 2016?\n\n\n                             MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                               (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                         46\n\n\n     1         A.    I don't know if it was September 15th, but\n\n 2       sometime probably after that.\n\n 3             Q.    Okay.   And you disagree with Judge Waters'\n\n 4       findings here, I assume?\n\n 5             A.    That would be a fair assumption.\n\n 6             Q.    Okay.   I take it again you don't disagree with the\n\n 7       facts in here that Deborah was 54 at the time Ms. Short died\n\n 8       and she was 42 at the time the trust was executed?     I think we\n\n 9       got your agreement on that earlier?\n\n10            A.     If -- if those were the correct dates then I'll --\n\n11       I'll assume that also.\n\n12            Q.     You don't have any reason to doubt that?\n\n13            A.     I -- if you're representing that's the case then I\n\n14       have no reason to doubt it.\n\n15            Q.     Okay.   Why did you continue to pursue these same\n\n16       claims in this Court after they had already been rejected by\n\n17       Judge Waters in West Virginia?\n\n18            A.     I think you're asking me to give my legal theories\n\n19       on that.\n\n20            Q.     Okay.\n\n              A.     You know\n\n              Q.     Do you have one?\n\n23            A.        the fact is that the West Virginia case was\n\n24       filed after this case was filed by Ms. Farley in our petition\n\n25       in intervention and --\n\n\n                                  MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                    (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                       47\n\n\n 1         Q.    Let me just stop you there because I think I can\n\n 2   cut to the chase.    What substantive disputes do you have with\n\n 3   regard to what Judge Waters found?    I'm not talking about\n\n 4   procedure, but you said you disagreed with what he found in\n\n 5   this paragraph and I'd like to know what that disagreement is?\n\n 6        A.     Well, certainly, again, it's our position and I\n\n 7   think you've conceded at least one of the points is that\n\n 8   Deborah Cortez is entitled to the trust proceeds.\n\n 9        Q.     Well, I have certainly not conceded that and if\n\n10   that's what you think I said then I retract that.    I think\n\n11   what I said is that I withdrew our sanctions motion on that\n\n12   point because I think it is a colorable argument.    I certainly\n\n13   do not endorse your theory on that.    I think we were still\n\n14   entitled to summary judgment, absolutely.    But if there has\n\n15   been some confusion on that I want to set the record straight.\n\n16   And all I did was withdraw our sanctions motion on that point.\n\n17   I still think you were absolutely, totally wrong.\n\n18        A.     Well, certainly we have a difference of opinion\n\n19   because\n\n20        Q.     Sure.    And you and Judge Waters have a difference\n\n21   of opinion, correct?\n\n22        A.     Right.\n\n23        Q.     And I want to know, again, what the basis is for\n\n24   you disagreeing with Judge Waters' order here?\n\n25        A.     Because Deborah Cortez is entitled to the trust.\n\n\n                             MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                               (512) 854-9258\n\f     1            Q.   Okay.\n\n     2            A.   And I've already outlined the reasons why.\n\n     3            Q.   Well, sir,    you haven't.     In fact,   you told me you\n\n 4       can't outline it.     You said it's in the pleadings.        And,    sir,\n\n 5       you are the one here that we're seeking sanctions against.\n\n 6       And I've been through the pleadings and what they say.              Now I\n\n 7       need to hear what you say about it, sir.          And so my question\n\n 8       one last time is can you show me any language in Article 8,\n\n 9       Section D of Exhibit 1 that supports your theory?\n\n10            A.       I think I've already said that.\n\n11                     MR. THOMPSON:     Okay.     I'll pass the witness, Your\n\n12       Honor.\n\n13\n\n14                                  CROSS-EXAMINATION\n\n15       BY MR. ROBACK:\n\n16            Q.       Mr. Brotherton, counsel asked you if you're\n\n17       familiar with Rule 13.      He read to you some parts of Rule 13.\n\n18       He didn't read all of Rule 13.          Does Rule 13 in fact state,\n\n19       quote, \"Courts shall presume that pleadings, motions and other\n\n20       papers are filed in good faith,\" unquote?\n\n21            A.       That's correct.\n\n22            Q.       Counsel went over multiple filings in the case,\n\n23       the Original Petition in Intervention, the first amended, the\n\n24       second amended, the third amended and the fourth amended, went\n\n25       over each of those and had you confirm that there was a,\n\n\n                                    MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                      (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                       49\n\n\n 1   quote, unquote, postponement claim made in each of those\n\n 2   filings.   Is that your recollection?\n\n 3         A.    Correct.\n\n 4         Q.    And when was the first time counsel advised you or\n\n 5   anyone else advised you that counsel believed that that\n\n 6   statement, that that claim was sanctionable?\n\n 7         A.    I don't think I ever heard that --\n\n 8         Q.    So\n\n 9        A.          until this motion to modify.\n\n10         Q.    So if I'm understanding correctly, you filed an\n\n11   original petition, first amended, second amended, third\n\n12   amended and fourth amended, and the very first time counsel\n\n13   advised you that he believed your conduct was sanctionable was\n\n14   not until after the final judgment in that case?     Is this --\n\n15   is that correct?\n\n16        A.     That's correct.\n\n17        Q.     Interesting.    Counsel also read to you from\n\n18   Chapter 10 of the Civil Practices and Remedies Code,\n\n19   specifically Section 10.001.     I'd like to read a portion of i t\n\n20   that he hasn't to have you confirm that's correct.     To the\n\n21   signatory's best knowledge,    information, belief formed after\n\n22   reasonable inquiry and so on, when you filed all the documents\n\n23   at issue, did you make what you believed to be reasonable\n\n24   inquiry?\n\n25        A.     Absolutely.\n\n\n                            MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                              (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                          50\n\n\n     1         Q.      Prior to filing those documents?\n\n     2         A.      Absolutely.\n\n     3         Q.      By doing so did your reasonable inquiry include\n\n 4       assigning associates to do research on these legal issues?\n\n 5             A.      That's correct.\n\n 6             Q.      Did your reasonable inquiry include consulting\n\n 7       with a trust and estates expert before filing these documents?\n\n 8             A.      That's correct.\n\n 9             Q.     And did you to the, quote, unquote, best\n\n10       knowled~e,   information, belief of yourself truly believe you\n\n11       were acting in good faith at the time you filed these\n\n12       documents?\n\n13            A.      Absolutely.\n\n14            Q.      You had an honest belief you were acting in good\n\n15       faith at the time of the filing?\n\n16            A.      Yes.\n\n17            Q.      Did you intend to mislead this Court or counsel\n\n18       with any of the filings in this case?\n\n19            A.      Absolutely not.\n\n20            Q.      To the extent that hypothetically you were wrong\n\n21       on any claim you made, did you know at the time you made these\n\n22       claims in the filings you were wrong?   If hypothetically\n\n23       I'm not saying you were wrong -- but if hypothetically you had\n\n24       been wrong, would you have known at the time you filed these\n\n25       claims?\n\n\n                                MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                  (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                         51\n\n\n 1            A.   No.\n\n 2            Q.   Counsel also asked you to review the West Virginia\n\n 3   Judge's order granting a motion for personal            personal\n\n 4   summary judgment against your client.          Was that an\n\n 5   interlocutory order or a final order?\n\n 6            A.   Interlocutory.\n\n 7            Q.   And is it your understanding of the law that an\n\n 8   interlocutory order by a West Virginia judge is binding on\n\n 9   this Texas Court?\n\n10            A.   It is not.\n\n11            Q.   So you wouldn't have found anything at all wrong\n\n12   making an argument inconsistent with a West Virginia Judge's\n\n13   interlocutory order at the time you made your filing in this\n\n14   case?\n\n15           A.    That's correct.\n\n16                 MR. RUBACK:     I have no further questions, Your\n\n17   Honor.\n\n18                 MR. THOMPSON:     Nothing further.\n\n19                 THE COURT:    You may be seated.\n\n20                 Next witness.\n\n21                 MR. THOMPSON:     Sean Hester.\n\n22                 Your Honor, I'm going to approach because I was\n\n23   just handed the exhibits, I need to hand them back.\n\n24                 MR. HESTER:     May I borrow your glasses, William?\n\n25                 MR. BROTHERTON:     Oh, you can.\n\n\n                                MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                  (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                          52\n\n\n     1               MR. HESTER:     You may not need them but I do.\n\n     2               MR. BROTHERTON:     They are 1.25, the lowest --\n\n     3   lowest range.\n\n 4                   MR. THOMPSON:     There was a file stamped copy of\n\n 5       the trust document but I'm not finding it.\n\n 6                   THE COURT:     It's probably with me.     It is.\n\n 7                   MR. THOMPSON:     Okay.   There you go.\n\n 8                   MR. HESTER:     Thank you.\n\n 9\n\n10                                   SEAN HESTER,\n\n11       was called as a witness by the Movant having been first duly\n\n12       sworn, testified as follows:\n\n13\n\n14                                DIRECT EXAMINATION\n\n15       BY MR. THOMPSON:\n\n16            Q.     Mr. Hester, would you state your name for the\n\n17       Court, please?\n\n18            A.     Sean Walker Hester.\n\n19            Q.     And what do you do for a living?\n\n20            A.     I'm an attorney.\n\n21            Q.     How long have you been practicing law?\n\n22            A.     Since 1993.\n\n23            Q.     And you're one of the attorneys for Mateo Cortez\n\n24       in this matter; is that right?\n\n25            A.     That's correct.\n\n\n                                  MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                    (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                                53\n\n\n     1            Q.   Okay.     I'm going to try to get through this a\n\n 2       little more quickly so you don't have to wear those crooked\n\n 3       glasses for the next hour.          No offense, Mr. Brotherton.\n\n 4                     Are you familiar -- at least after today are you\n\n 5       familiar with Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 13 and Civil\n\n 6       Practices and Remedies Code, Chapter 10?\n\n 7                A.   Yes, I'm generally familiar with them.\n\n 8                Q.   Okay.     And I actually have Chapter 10 up there in\n\n 9       front of you.     It's not an exhibit but you may want to look at\n\n10       it.   And you understand that the triggering event for\n\n11       potential sanctions under those rules is an attorney signing a\n\n12       pleadi~g that is sanctionable?\n\n13             A.      That's what it says.\n\n14                Q.   Do you agree with me that you signed Intervenor's\n\n15       Amended Motion to Consider Order Granting Third Party\n\n16       Defendants' Traditional and No Evidence Motion for Summary\n\n17       Judgment?\n\n18             A.      I -- yes,       I'm sure I did.\n\n19             Q.      Okay.     I can give you a copy just to help us\n\n20       along.\n\n21                     MR. THOMPSON:       May I approach, Judge?\n\n22                     THE COURT:       You may.\n\n23                     THE WITNESS:        The titles get so long, I'm -- but\n\n24       I'm sure I did.       Okay.\n\n25             Q.      (By Mr. Thompson)        And this is a recently filed\n\n\n                                       MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                         (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                         54\n\n\n 1   pleading.     It looks like it was actually filed in two\n\n 2   different cause numbers but I think it was most recently filed\n\n 3   on the 23rd of January; is that right?\n\n 4         A.      Yeah, it probably got filed in the other cause\n\n 5   number since this case was severed.\n\n 6         Q.      Sure.\n\n 7         A.      I think there may have been some confusion.\n\n 8         Q.      I think we're all kind of confused about it.\n\n 9        A.       I   --   yeah, i t is a little confusing.\n\n10         Q.      I won't belabor it, but are you familiar with what\n\n11   I discussed with Mr. Brotherton is the postponement provision\n\n12   claim?\n\n13        A.       I am.\n\n14        Q.       And that's the claim of course that because\n\n15   Deborah Cortez was over the age of 35 at the time Phyllis\n\n16   Short died,   that she's entitled to all the trust assets,\n\n17   correct?\n\n18        A.       That's correct.\n\n19        Q.       Do you address that claim and ask the Court to\n\n20   reconsider its summary judgment on that claim in this amended\n\n21   motion to reconsider?\n\n22        A.       Yes.\n\n23        Q.       Okay.     And just to be sure, if you go to Page 22\n\n24   of this document, that is your signature there on Page 22; is\n\n25   that right?\n\n\n                                MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                  (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                             55\n\n\n 1            A.     I'll get there but, yes,     I'm sure it is.\n\n 2            Q.   Sure.\n\n 3            A.   Yes, it is.\n\n 4            Q.   Okay.     You understand that that claim was made\n\n 5   pursuant to the postponement provision in the trust which is I\n\n 6   believe marked as Exhibit 1 up there.         And that's on Page 5,\n\n 7   that's Article 8, Section D?\n\n 8        A.       I do.\n\n 9        Q.       And you understand when I say postponement\n\n10   provision that's what I'm speaking of?\n\n11        A.       I do.\n\n12        Q.       Okay.     Can you tell me the language in Article 8,\n\n13   Section D that you believe supports the postponement provision\n\n14   claim?\n\n15        A.       I can.     Let me get to it.\n\n16        Q.       Uh-huh.\n\n17        A.       The -- well, first of all -- let's see.          Okay.   So\n\n18   first of all it refers to any beneficiary.         And clearly in my\n\n19   mind Deborah Cortez was the only named beneficiary in this\n\n20   in this case.     So when I'm reading \"postponement of\n\n21   possession\" it says \"if any beneficiary,\" in my mind that has\n\n22   to apply to Deborah Cortez.\n\n23        Q.       Okay.     Let's talk about that.\n\n24        A.       Because she's -- because she's the only -- I mean,\n\n25   until she died she's the only beneficiary.\n\n\n                                MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                  (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                           56\n\n\n     1         Q.      Okay.   You're talking about right there at the\n\n 2       front end it says if any beneficiary is under the age of\n\n 3       35 years, dot, dot, dot?\n\n 4             A.      At the time he or she becomes entitled to\n\n 5       distribution, that's correct.\n\n 6             Q.      Okay.   That's the \"any beneficiary\" language\n\n 7       you're referring to?\n\n 8            A.       Correct.\n\n 9             Q.      Okay.   Do you not agree with me that this\n\n10       provision did not apply to Deborah Cortez because as has been\n\n11       admitted by your co-counsel she was over the age of 35 at the\n\n12       time she became entitled to distribution?\n\n13            A.       I don't agree.\n\n14            Q.       Okay.   And why not?\n\n15            A.       Because to me this postponement of possession\n\n16       would apply if she was under 35.     I think clearly if Deborah\n\n17       was under the age of 35 she would have had postponement of\n\n18       possession.    So the way it applies to me is if she's over\n\n19       35 then she would have been entitled to full distribution of\n\n20       the assets because there would not be a postponement of\n\n21       possession.\n\n22            Q.       Okay.\n\n23            A.       And that's what I've always argued.\n\n24            Q.       And does that stem from under Section 2,\n\n25       termination, the statement that \"When such beneficiary reaches\n\n\n                                  MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                    (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                          57\n\n\n     1   the age of 35 years the balance of his or her trust share,\n\n     2   including both principal and any accrued or undistributed\n\n     3   income shall be distributed to that beneficiary?\"      Is that\n\n 4       where that thinking comes from?\n\n 5             A.    I'm sorry, tell me which provision you just read.\n\n 6             Q.    If you go down to termination, No. 2?\n\n 7            A.     Okay.\n\n 8            Q.     And then on the third line?      I believe this is the\n\n 9       provision that you believe supports your theory?\n\n10            A.     Right.\n\n11            Q.     \"When such beneficiary reaches the age of 35 years\n\n12       his or her trust share shall be distributed to the\n\n13       beneficiary.\"   Do you see that?\n\n14            A.     Yes.\n\n15            Q.     Okay.    Is that the provision that you think\n\n16       supports your theory?\n\n17            A.     Well, I think      I wouldn't read it as --\n\n18       separately, but I think read as a whole in my opinion it -- it\n\n19       does support the -- the theory.\n\n20            Q.     Okay.    Do you not agree with me that when the\n\n21       trust says \"when such beneficiary reaches the age of 35\" it's\n\n22       talking about the beneficiaries that were under the age of\n\n23       35 at the time they were entitled to their distribution?\n\n24            A.     I would assume it was talking about any\n\n25       beneficiary because that's what's named.\n\n\n                                 MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                   (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                        58\n\n\n 1         Q.    Well, why would the document say \"such\n\n 2   beneficiary\" if it was talking about any beneficiary?      Doesn't\n\n 3   \"such\" qualify a beneficiary?\n\n 4        A.     To me it says \"if any beneficiary,\" and then you\n\n 5   read that and i t says \"when such beneficiary.\"\n\n 6         Q.    But, sir, i t doesn't say \"if any beneficiary.\"       It\n\n 7   says \"if any beneficiary is under the age of 35 years,\"\n\n 8   correct?\n\n 9        A.     Right.     Right.\n\n10        Q.     And under your theory we would totally throw that\n\n11   phrasing out the window because it doesn't matter if they're\n\n12   under or over age 35?\n\n13        A.     It does matter because --\n\n14        Q.     Okay.     Why does it matter?\n\n15        A.     Because if Deborah was under 35 she would have\n\n16   been subject to the postponement.\n\n17        Q.     Yes, she would.     But she's not subject to i t\n\n18   because she was over the age of 35, correct?\n\n19        A.     Which means there is no postponement.     That's what\n\n20   we've always argued.\n\n21        Q.     Okay.     And this is what Dick Kelsey told you was\n\n22   the correct interpretation of the trust?\n\n23        A.     Absolutely.\n\n24        Q.     Okay.\n\n25        A.     I mean,    I'm -- I'm not -- I understand that people\n\n\n                              MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                      59\n\n\n 1   have said we're wrong, but I still completely believe that\n\n 2   that's what the plain language says.\n\n 3         Q.     Again, like Mr. Brotherton you were part of the\n\n 4   team that raised this same argument in West Virginia, correct?\n\n 5   Were you involved in the West Virginia litigation?\n\n 6         A.     No.\n\n 7         Q.     You haven't done any research or   --\n 8         A.     I did some research.    We had West Virginia\n\n 9   counsel.\n\n10         Q.     Okay.\n\n11         A.     I believe Mr. Brotherton may have been up there,\n\n12   but\n\n13         Q.     Have you been to West Virginia for this case?\n\n14         A.     No.\n\n15         Q.     Has Mr. Brotherton?\n\n16         A.     I think he said he had.\n\n17         Q.     Okay.\n\n18         A.     I'm sure -- he did.    He said he had.\n\n19         Q.     So are you familiar with the order that's marked\n\n20   Exhibit 2?\n\n21         A.     Yes.    I'm familiar it exists.\n\n22         Q.     And again, to cut to the chase on Exhibit 2,\n\n23   Page 8, Paragraph 29, are you familiar with the fact that\n\n24   Judge Waters rejected this claim in the West Virginia matter?\n\n25         A.     Yes, I am, but there is a -- there is a caveat to\n\n\n                              MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                                    60\n\n\n     1   that.         But, yes, to answer your question.\n\n 2                Q.        I understand there is some dispute about the\n\n 3       capacity issues related to the West Virginia case.           I\n 4       understand that you only represent Mateo Cortez in his\n\n 5       individual capacity in West Virginia.           But on the substance,\n\n 6       the substance of the postponement provision claim that we've\n\n 7       referred to today, that's what Judge Waters is talking about\n\n 8       in Paragraph 29, correct?\n\n 9                A.       Okay.\n\n10                Q.       Do you agree with me?    And take your time to\n\n11       review it.\n\n12                A.       I mean, the first sentence says, \"The Court\n\n13       rejects Mateo Cortez' argument that he is the sole beneficiary\n\n14       of the trust.\"        I really don't believe we've ever argued that.\n\n15       I think we've always argued that the estate of Deborah Cortez\n\n16       was the sole beneficiary of the trust.\n\n17                Q.       Okay.   Well, even if that is so the Judge goes on\n\n18       to talk about his claim, Mateo Cortez in whatever capacity,               is\n\n19       that          because Article 8, Section D2 of the trust states\n\n20       that          and then it reads in the 35 year provision.        Do you\n\n21       see that?\n\n22               A.        Again, it says,   \"Mateo Cortez argues that he is\n\n23       the sole beneficiary of the trust.\"         I   just -- if that was\n\n24       argued in West Virginia that's not something we argued in\n\n25       Texas.        And I understand where the -- where some of the\n\n\n                                      MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                        (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                              61\n\n\n     1   confusion came with -- with the summary judgment as to whether\n\n 2       or not we were saying Mateo Cortez was a beneficiary or the\n\n 3       estate of Deborah Cortez, but I --\n\n 4                Q.   Well, it came from the fact that you waited a year\n\n 5       and a half to get your ducks in a row about the personal\n\n 6       representative issue, correct?\n\n 7               A.    Well, it -- it's my understanding that we've never\n\n 8       made a claim that Mateo Cortez was the beneficiary of the\n\n 9       trust.\n\n10               Q.    Okay.     So Judge Waters just got that one wrong in\n\n11       Exhibit 2?\n\n12               A.    I said that's my understanding.\n\n13               Q.    Okay.     Regardless of the capacity issue\n\n14               A.    I wasn't involved in the West Virginia so I don't\n\n15       know what      what Judge Waters had in front of him,      I don't\n\n16       know what he ruled.\n\n17               Q.    Okay.     But whatever he had in front of him he\n\n18       certainly says later on that the plain language of Section D\n\n19       of the trust only applies if any beneficiary is under the age\n\n20       of 35 at the time he or she becomes entitled to distribution\n\n21       and that Deborah could not have been entitled to distribution\n\n22       under that section because she was 45 years old when Ms. Short\n\n23       died?\n\n24               A.    42.     Or --\n\n25               Q.    I'm sorry.       54 years old.\n\n\n                                       MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                         (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                               62\n\n\n     1            A.       54.     Okay.    Sorry.\n\n     2            Q.       Is that right?\n\n     3            A.       Yeah.\n\n 4                Q.       Okay.     And you don't dispute that she was that age\n\n 5       at the time that Ms. Short died?\n\n 6                A.       Correct.\n\n 7                         MR. THOMPSON:       Pass the witness.\n\n 8\n\n 9                                         CROSS-EXAMINATION\n\n10       BY MR. RUBACK:\n\n11            Q.           Mr. Hester, is every pleading you filed -- I'm\n\n12       sorry.        Mr. Hester,    is the one pleading you signed in this\n\n13       case, the only pleading you signed in this case, is it based\n\n14       on your honest interpretation of the law and of the trust\n\n15       documents?\n\n16            A.           Yes, sir.\n\n17            Q.           Did you ever intend to mislead the Court with\n\n18       anything in the one filing you signed?\n\n19            A.           No.\n\n20            Q.           Did you rely upon research performed by yourself\n\n21       and by associates at your law firm in filing that document\n\n22       that you filed?\n\n23            A.          Absolutely.\n\n24            Q.           Did you rely upon the trust expert in Denton\n\n25       County in making the representations you made to the Court in\n\n\n                                       MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                         (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                        63\n\n\n 1   the one filing that you filed?\n\n 2         A.    Yes.\n\n 3         Q.    We've talked quite a bit about an interlocutory\n\n 4   order signed by a West Virginia judge in a related matter.        Do\n\n 5   you believe that an interlocutory order signed by a\n\n 6   West Virginia judge should be binding on this Texas Court?\n\n 7        A.     No.\n\n 8               MR.

Yes.     They came to me -- well, we were in\n\n 4   California.    My husband was in the service.       He was drafted\n\n 5   during the Vietnam war.       And they came from Parkersburg,\n\n 6   West Virginia to Fort Ord, California to visit us.        And while\n\n 7   they were out there they talked to me then that they were\n\n 8   thing about doing -- that -- the trust.\n\n 9          Q.

Now, to your knowledge did they have a\n\n16   trust at that -- do you know if they had a trust at that time?\n\n17          A.     No,    I don't think they did but it's not -- I don't\n\n18   know that knowledge.       They didn't share that with me if they\n\n19   did.\n\n20          Q.     Sure.    And did they mention to you the amount, the\n\n21   size of the trust in the 1970s?\n\n22          A.     No.\n\n23          Q.     All right.     Now,   let's fast forward to let's say\n\n24   the 1980s.    Did they have a special occasion where they talked\n\n25   to you further about the trust?\n\n\n                                MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                  (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                              68\n\n\n     1           A.

And they gave me a video to watch to see how a\n\n 4       trust works and also asked me if I would be willing to serve\n\n 5       as a co-trustee with Debbie if something happened to her and\n\n 6       William.\n\n 7               Q.    Okay.\n\n 8               A.    And if she was the last to go it was supposed to\n\n 9       be me that served on the trust as a co-trustee.\n\n10               Q.    Now, were they aware that you were in the banking\n\n11       industry?\n\n12               A.    Yes.    Yes, they come -- they were a customer of\n\n13       mine a lot.\n\n14               Q.    Proud of you for that?\n\n15               A.    Pardon me?\n\n16               Q.    Were they proud of you for that?\n\n17               A.    Oh, yes.     They always told me how proud they were\n\n18       for what I did with my education and working with the bank.\n\n19       And I enjoyed it.     I loved banking.\n\n20               Q.    Ma'am, I want to fast forward to January 5th,\n\n21       2000.    That's when William passed away, correct?\n\n22               A.    Yes.\n\n23               Q.    Now, was there a memorial service for Dorsey in\n\n24       West Virginia?\n\n25               A.    Yes.\n\n\n                                    MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                      (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                           69\n\n\n     1           Q.   Okay.     Now, what if anything or any meetings\n\n 2       happened around the time of this memorial service --\n\n 3               A.   Uh-huh.\n\n 4               Q.   -- as it relates to the trust?\n\n 5               A.   Yes.    I spoke with -- with Phyllis and Debbie at\n\n 6       that time at their hotel and we talked about the trust and she\n\n 7       wanted me to serve as the co-trustee.\n\n 8               Q.   In addition to asking you to serve as the\n\n 9       co-trustee did Phyllis, Aunt Phyllis talk about the goal, the\n\n10       purpose of the trust?\n\n11               A.   That she wanted it -- that once -- if Debbie --\n\n12       she wanted Debbie to be able to live comfortably.\n\n13               Q.   Okay.\n\n14               A.   And after Debbie's death then it was to be divided\n\n15       between the Whites -- the Whited and the Short families.\n\n16               Q.   All right.     So after William passed away did at\n\n17       some point you become a co-trustee?\n\n18               A.   Yes, I did.\n\n19               Q.   All right.    Now, you were co-trustee with who\n\n20       else?\n\n21               A.   With Deborah.\n\n22               Q.   All right.    Now, who is Bob Schlager (phonetic)?\n\n23               A.

Financial, yes.\n\n\n                                   MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                     (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                                 70\n\n\n     1           Q.     Okay.     And what if anything would he do or send\n\n     2   you as co-trustee?\n\n 3               A.     He would send me documents at different times.\n\n 4       Sometimes Phyllis would call and tell me they were sending\n\n 5       them and sometimes he called.           I'd sign them and send them\n\n 6       back.\n\n 7               Q.     But you were relying for the most part on what he\n\n 8       was sending you?\n\n 9               A.     Absolutely.        I -- they trusted him, I trust them\n\n10       and I trusted him.\n\n11               Q.     You're in West Virginia at the time?\n\n12               A.     Yes,    I am.\n\n13               Q.

She was in Florida when they prepared the trust\n\n22       and everything but then they moved to Texas because they were\n\n23       getting older.\n\n24               Q.     Okay.    All right.      So it's my understanding that\n\n25       in the span of 10, 11 months, all in one year both your\n\n\n                                        MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                          (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                            71\n\n\n\n     1   Aunt Phyllis and Deborah died.

He called me the morning that Debbie had passed\n\n13       away and he said       and he -- and I thought it was so strange\n\n14       and I said it to my husband.     He said, \"We were getting\n\n15       $15,000 a month and now that money is going to be yours.\"\n\n16            Q.     So Deborah and Mateo were getting $15,000 a month?\n\n17            A.     Yes.\n\n18            Q.     Okay.     And what was your reaction -- what did you\n\n19       think he meant by \"you're getting it now?\"\n\n20            A.     I said,    \"No, I will not be getting that money, it\n\n21       belongs to the trust.\"\n\n22            Q.

Finally after asking and asking and asking I\n\n 6   received a copy on February the 17th of 2012 that Mateo sent\n\n 7   to me and said he found it in the condo.\n\n 8         Q.     So Mateo gave you your first copy of the trust?\n\n 9        A.      Yes.\n\n10         Q.     Now, at that point did you know all of the\n\n11   accounts and annuities and life insurance policies and\n\n12   everything involved with the trust?\n\n13        A.      No, I had no idea.\n\n14        Q.      All right.

BOONE:     Yes.\n\n18                THE COURT:     Counselors?    Because you've got me\n\n19   confused.

There was a transfer form --\n\n18       I'm not exactly correct of what it was, but it was\n\n19       transferring the ownership and Aunt Phyl transferred it to me\n\n20       and Debbie on March -- March 31st of 2003.\n\n21                   THE COURT:     Okay.    So you -- when Debbie died you\n\n22       had this phone call saying that we've been getting $15,000.\n\n23       Were you directing the $15,000 or how did that money -- how\n\n24       were they getting -- or Debbie getting $15,000?\n\n25                   THE WITNESS:     She was -- the $15,000 was corning\n\n\n                                  MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                    (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                        74\n\n\n 1   out of the trust to Debbie that Robert Schlager set up to go\n\n 2   to her.\n\n 3               MR.

THOMPSON:     I don't know the answer to that\n\n12   th8n.\n\n13               THE WITNESS:     No, she never got that kind of money\n\n14   before Phyllis' death.     Not 15,000 a month.\n\n15               THE COURT:     Okay.   Because, I mean, you said --\n\n16   let me go back and look at this.       You said that he called\n\n17   you\n\n18               THE WITNESS:     On December the 9th of 2011.\n\n19               THE COURT:     Right after --\n\n20               THE WITNESS:     Debbie died.\n\n21               THE COURT:     Debbie died.     And he said, \"We've been\n\n22   getting $15,000.\"\n\n23               THE WITNESS:     Uh-huh.   Each month.\n\n24               THE COURT:     And I'm just trying to say who was\n\n25   directing that?     Because I don't read the trust to say that.\n\n\n                              MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                                   75\n\n\n     1                 THE WITNESS:     Because Debbie acted on her -- by\n\n 2       herself after Phyllis died.\n\n 3                     THE COURT:     No, before Phyllis -- okay.

And you believe that -- you were a\n\n 5       co-trustee?\n\n 6                     THE WITNESS:     Yes.\n\n 7                     THE COURT:     But you weren't authorizing any\n\n 8       payments?\n\n 9                     THE WITNESS:     No.\n\n10                     THE COURT:     That between the date of Phyllis'\n\n11       death and the date of Debbie's death, which was a period of\n\n12       11 months\n\n13                     THE WITNESS:     Uh-huh.\n\n14                     THE COURT:     -- at least according to Mateo he was\n\n15       receiving $15,000 a month for those 10 or 11 months?\n\n16                     THE WITNESS:     No, they didn't get it that -- that\n\n17       quickly.    Let me think.\n\n18                     THE COURT:     But were you directing that payment as\n\n19       co-trustee?\n\n20                     THE WITNESS:     No.\n\n21                     THE COURT:     Who do you think was directing that?\n\n22                     THE WITNESS:     Debbie set it up with the investors\n\n23       through Bob Schlager.\n\n24                     THE COURT:     Okay.    So she as a co-trustee\n\n25       contacted Mr. Schlager?\n\n\n                                    MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                      (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                           76\n\n\n 1                THE WITNESS:     And she set up these accounts with\n\n 2   the money that was in the trust.        She operated on her behalf.\n\n 3   I never did anything except sign some blank documents which I\n\n 4   knew nothing about.     I called Bob to say -- I called Bob\n\n 5   Schlager and asked him what -- I said, \"Why am I signing these\n\n 6   blank documents?\"     And there was a stack like this.\n\n 7   (Indicating.)   And he said, \"Do I have to get a plane and come\n\n 8   clear up the -- West Virginia to go over each and every one of\n\n 9   these documents?\"     And I told him, I said, \"I've worked in\n\n10   banking all my life and I was always told never to let anyone\n\n11   sign a document in blank.\"      But he was very, very rude and --\n\n12                THE COURT:     Okay.    So you -- well, you may have\n\n13   signed a blank document\n\n14                THE WITNESS:     Yes, I --\n\n15                THE COURT:     -- but you're telling me you didn't\n\n16   authorize any $15,000 a month payment?\n\n17                THE WITNESS:     Well, no, I did not but I signed the\n\n18   document .\n\n19                THE COURT:     Right.   You signed these blank\n\n20   documents but you didn't really know --\n\n21                THE WITNESS:     What was being done.\n\n22                THE COURT:     -- these payments were being done\n\n23   until Mateo called you.     And then he says you're going to be\n\n24   receiving these payments forward?\n\n25                THE WITNESS:     That is correct.\n\n\n                               MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                 (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                          77\n\n\n 1                 THE COURT:     Okay.\n\n 2           Q.     (By Mr. Boone)     Now, what conclusions did you --\n\n 3   let's go back to that $15,000 payment that Mateo said would be\n\n 4   coming to you as the trustee?\n\n 5           A.    Uh-huh.\n\n 6           Q.    What conclusions did you draw as to what Mateo\n\n 7   felt or thought about his entitlement to the trust at that\n\n 8   point?\n\n 9           A.    Well, he thought that the money was going to come\n\n10   to me because he thought I was the trust (sic) at that time\n\n11   and I was going to get all those          that money.    We gave\n\n12   Debbie -- because I was supposed to give Debbie 50,000, which\n\n13   I didn't know, I didn't have a copy of the trust so I had no\n\n14   idea.    And -- and Debbie did an automatic draft from one of\n\n15   the investments to her own checking account for the $50,000\n\n16   for the first year, and then would have been supposed to give\n\n17   her $25,000 for the second year.       But she didn't live to get\n\n18   the second.    But I did not know that\n\n19                 THE COURT:     Well, let me stop you.     You got a copy\n\n20   of this trust agreement when?\n\n21                 THE WITNESS:      February the 17th of 2016 from Mateo\n\n22   Cortez because I couldn't get anything from Bob Schlager.\n\n23                 THE COURT:     Okay.   Do you have that instrument\n\n24   down there?\n\n25                 THE WITNESS:     With me now?\n\n\n                                MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                  (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                            78\n\n\n 1                 MR. BOONE:     It would be Exhibit 2.\n\n 2                 THE WITNESS:     Yes, I do.\n\n 3                 THE COURT:     Okay.     Look at the provision about\n\n 4   what happens when Phyllis dies.\n\n 5                 MR. BOONE:     Is that Article 7, disposition after\n\n 6   death of second spouse?\n\n 7                 THE COURT:     Yes.\n\n 8        Q.       (By Mr. Boone)        That's on Page 4 of 14,\n\n 9   Ms. Murray.\n\n10        A.       Okay.   Disposition after the death of second\n\n11   spouse.    Debbie was -- well, we were          the trustee -- I mean,\n\n12   the two co-trustees were supposed to            \"On the death of the\n\n13   second spouse the trust shall be administered as follows;\n\n14   payment of expenses and taxes.         The trustee shall make\n\n15   provision out of the second spouse's separate share for the\n\n16   payments of the type described in Paragraph B of Article 5 if\n\n17   any required in connection with the estate of the second\n\n18   spouse.\"\n\n19                 \"Special testamentary power of appointment.        The\n\n20   trustee shall distribute such portion of the assets of the\n\n21   credit sheltered trust of the first spouse to die to such\n\n22   charitable institutions and to such persons who are\n\n23   descendants or the spouses of descendants of the first spouse\n\n24   to die as the second spouse may appoint by his or her will\n\n25   provided such will makes specific reference to this power of\n\n\n                                MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                  (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                            79\n\n\n 1   appointment and is duly admitted to probate.          In default of\n\n 2   the exercise of such power of appointment the remainder of the\n\n 3   trust estate shall be administered as described in Article 8\n\n 4   below.\"\n\n 5               THE COURT:     Okay.     Continue.   Well, one question.\n\n 6   Do you know whether or not those charities got whatever they\n\n 7   were entitled to?\n\n 8               THE WITNESS:     Yes.\n\n 9               THE COURT:     Okay.     Now let's go down to the next\n\n10   section.\n\n11               THE WITNESS:     Cash distribution -- cash\n\n12   distributions.   I can't talk.\n\n13               THE COURT:     Distribution.\n\n14               THE WITNESS:     Excuse me.     Okay.    \"Cash\n\n15   distribution to Deborah.     If our daughter Deborah A. Cortez is\n\n16   living and legally competent the trustee shall distribute to\n\n17   her the sum of $50,000 as soon as practicable after the death\n\n18   of the second one of us to die.        If Deborah is not there -- if\n\n19   Deborah is not then living or is not legally competent then\n\n20   this gift shall lapse and the remainder of the trust estate\n\n21   shall be administered as provided below.\"\n\n22               \"Continuing trust for Deborah.          If our daughter\n\n23   Deborah A. Cortez is living on the date of the death of the\n\n24   second one of us to die, then the remainder trust estate shall\n\n25   be administered as follows:        Number one, income commencing as\n\n\n                              MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                              80\n\n\n     1   of that date and during Deborah's life, the trustee shall\n\n 2       distribute to her or on her behalf if she becomes\n\n 3       incapacitated all of the net income of the trust at least\n\n 4       quarterly or at more frequent intervals at Deborah's request.\n\n 5       The term 'income' shall not include capital gains whether\n\n 6       short term or long term from the sale of assets of the trust.\"\n\n 7                     THE COURT:     Okay.     Let me look at that for a\n\n 8       minute.    I'm going to ask you a question.        So you were the\n\n 9       co-trustee upon Phyllis' death?\n\n10                     THE WITNESS:     Yes.\n\n11                     THE COURT:     Were you involved in making the\n\n12       $50,000 distribution?\n\n13                    THE WITNESS:      No, I was not.\n\n14                    THE COURT:      You didn't have a copy of this trust,\n\n15       did you?\n\n16                    THE WITNESS:      No.\n\n17                    THE COURT:      Then after that $50,000 distribution\n\n18       there was to be a second payment which would have been one\n\n19       year from the date of death of the second of us -- of one\n\n20       the second one of us to die.          So if Phyllis -- what's the date\n\n21       of Phyllis' death?\n\n22                    THE WITNESS:      Phyllis' death was January the 5th\n\n23       of 2011.\n\n24                    THE COURT:      Okay.    So as soon as practicable\n\n25       $50,000 was payable?\n\n\n                                    MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                      (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                                  81\n\n\n     1               THE WITNESS:     Right.\n\n 2                   THE COURT:     Then -- then there would be some\n\n 3       income during the period quarterly or more frequently at\n\n 4       Deborah's request.   Were you involved in any of that?\n\n 5                   THE WITNESS:     No, I was not.\n\n 6                   THE COURT:     Then there is to be another payment,\n\n 7       principal, of 25,000 one year after Deborah's death?\n\n 8                   THE WITNESS:     Right.\n\n 9                   THE COURT:     And that obviously never came to\n\n10       fruition so that would have never been made.           But there would\n\n11       have been some income during that time.           Now, when you say you\n\n12       signed these documents in blank, was that after Phyllis'\n\n13       death?\n\n14                   THE WITNESS:     That was after Phyllis' death.\n\n15                   THE COURT:     And -- but you -- there wasn't numbers\n\n16       iike here is the 50,000, here is income?\n\n17                   THE WITNESS:     They were completely blank.\n\n18                   THE COURT:     Okay.     Thank you.\n\n19                   THE WITNESS:     Okay.\n\n20                   THE COURT:     But you didn't act as the trustee\n\n21       even though you may have been the trustee you didn't have the\n\n22       agreement to know what you were to do?\n\n23                   THE WITNESS:     No, I had no idea about anything.\n\n24                   THE COURT:     Okay.     You may proceed.\n\n25                   MR. BOONE:     Thank you.\n\n\n                                  MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                    (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                                   82\n\n\n     1            Q.        (By Mr. Boone)      Ms. Murray, did you take greater\n\n     2   control over the trust once you became the sole trustee?\n\n     3            A.       Yes,    I did.\n\n 4                Q.       Tell the Judge about that.\n\n 5                A.       I had to -- once I was receiving statements and\n\n 6       stuff in the mail I contacted these companies -- well, first\n\n 7       of all, we contacted a bank local.              And with their help and\n\n 8       everything else going on I was able to get all of the money\n\n 9       transferred.        But when I talked to Bob Schlager to ask him to\n\n10       send me a copy of the trust, which I did not get, he said that\n\n11       he had some papers that he wanted me to fill out.             This was\n\n12       shortly after Debbie died.\n\n13                Q.       Okay.    And what did you --\n\n14                A.       I mean, not Debbie, Phyllis.\n\n15                Q.       What did you say in response to Bob's request to\n\n16       sign some more papers?\n\n17               A.        Pardon me?       I'm sorry.\n\n18               Q.        What did you say to Bob when he asked you to sign\n\n19       those papers?\n\n20               A.        I told him that I did not like signing papers\n\n21       blank.        But he told me he was trying to get it set up as soon\n\n22       as possible for Debbie to be able to start getting some money\n\n23       to live on.\n\n24               Q.        Okay.    I'm talking now about after Deborah passed\n\n25       away?\n\n\n                                        MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                          (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                        83\n\n\n 1         A.       Okay.\n\n 2         Q.       Okay?   What if any changes did you make to how you\n\n 3   handled your responsibilities as trustee after you became the\n\n 4   sole trustee?     How did you go about gathering all the\n\n 5   information to determine what was out there?\n\n 6        A.        We -- we had    the first trip to Texas down here,\n\n 7   we went through the condo.     And then it was 22 boxes shipped\n\n 8   to my house.\n\n 9        Q.        Okay.\n\n10        A.        And I went through all of those boxes to find the\n\n11   investments and anything -- we found bank statements and\n\n12   copies of checks and stuff.     There was so much -- and other\n\n13   material, quite a bit of other material in it also.      But the\n\n14   main portion we found a lot of investments in those boxes to\n\n15   be able to\n\n16        Q.        So those 22 boxes represented William and Phyllis'\n\n17   records over the years?\n\n18        A.        All over the years.   Right.   Because they had\n\n19   everything in there, letters, their whole life was in there.\n\n20        Q.        Did you get records from Wells Fargo?\n\n21        A.        Well, we got records from Wells Fargo but we had\n\n22   to argue and fight to be able to get those.      It took us\n\n23   forever and ever to get them.\n\n24        Q.        Now, at some point after gathering all this\n\n25   information, these records and documents, did you have\n\n\n                              MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                         84\n\n\n 1   concerns that there were funds missing that should have been\n\n 2   part of the trust?\n\n 3        A.     Yes,    I did, because when I talked to Bob Schlager\n\n 4   on the phone he told me there was approximately four million\n\n 5   dollars in the account.\n\n 6        Q.     Okay.     And --\n\n 7        A.     And so when I started through all of that stuff i t\n\n 8   didn't come up to no four million dollars.\n\n 9        Q.     Okay.     Now, at some point with the assistance of\n\n10   counsel did you file a -- excuse me.       Did you feel as though\n\n11   anyone in particular might be responsible for those missing\n\n12   funds?\n\n13        A.     Yes,    I felt like they were -- I hate to talk about\n\n14   them, but I felt like Debbie and Matt were taking those funds\n\n15   out of the account.\n\n16        Q.     Now, did you file any civil actions in Texas?\n\n17        A.     Yes.\n\n18        Q.     All right.       Linda, I don't want to get into the\n\n19   merits of that lawsuit,      the misappropriation lawsuit today.\n\n20   But I do want to draw your attention to one deposition.       Do\n\n21   you remember taking a deposition in that case?\n\n22        A.     Yes,    I do.\n\n23        Q.     Okay.     Just describe to the Judge how that\n\n24   deposition generally went?\n\n25        A.     I thought it was going really good until they come\n\n\n                                 MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                   (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                                85\n\n\n 1   to the point, they asked me how much money was in the trust.\n\n 2   And I didn't feel like it was any of their business because\n\n 3   the money didn't belong to them.            But I told them, it was\n\n 4   5.2 million.\n\n 5                     THE COURT:      Well, you need to stop.   I don't know\n\n 6   who the   11\n                    they\" is and the \"themn is.\n\n 7                     THE WITNESS:      Okay.\n\n 8        Q.

Someone from the\n\n12   Brotherton Law Firm?\n\n13        A.          Yes, it was.\n\n14        Q.          And Mateo Cortez was there?\n\n15        A.          Yes.\n\n16        Q.          All right.\n\n17        A.          He was with them.\n\n18        Q.          Okay.     So when they asked you how much was in the\n\n19   trust did you know the answer?\n\n20        A.          Yes, I did.\n\n21        Q.          And did you tell them the answer?\n\n22        A.          Yes,    I did.\n\n23        Q.          What was your answer?\n\n24        A.          5.2 million dollars.\n\n25        Q.          What if any reaction did you observe at that time?\n\n\n                                    MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                      (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                                 86\n\n\n     1            A.       You could see eyes rolling.\n\n 2                Q.       How so?\n\n 3                A.       Just so you could -- you could just see that they\n\n 4       knew there was a lot of money.          And then shortly after we had\n\n 5       a break.\n\n 6                Q.       Shortly after that question there was a break?\n\n 7                A.       Yes.\n\n 8                Q.       And what do you mean by \"a break?\"\n\n 9                A.       A 15 minute break.\n\n10                Q.       Counsel left and\n\n11                A.       Counsel left, we      yes.\n\n12                Q.       And do you recall if there were many questions\n\n13       after the break concluded?\n\n14                A.       No, there wasn't.\n\n15                Q.       And that deposition occurred on June 19th, 2015,\n\n16       correct?\n\n17                A.       That is correct.\n\n18                Q.       Now, did Mateo through his counsel make any claims\n\n19       after that deposition that were new and different?          Did they\n\n20       file any papers or pleadings or anything after that\n\n21       deposition?\n\n22            A.           Oh, yes.   They filed -- they filed saying that\n\n23       that money belonged to Mateo Cortez and all -- and it was all\n\n24       of it.        He -- Matt said all of the money belonged to him.\n\n25            Q.           And how did you      how did you feel when Mateo\n\n\n                                      MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                        (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                              87\n\n\n 1   argued that he was entitled to all of the trust?\n\n 2        A.     I knew it wasn't supposed to be that way because I\n\n 3   knew what Phyllis had told me at the hotel that day.             And I\n\n 4   know when me and -- when -- when Dorsey and Phyllis met with\n\n 5   me\n\n 6        Q.     Right?\n\n 7        A.     -- they had told me what their wishes were and\n\n 8   they told me that if -- if Phyllis died first it would go\n\n 9   to -- I'm sorry.     You have to excuse me.       I have\n\n10        Q.     That's okay.        You're doing just fine.    The\n\n11   question before you I think was how did you feel after Mateo\n\n12   argued that he was entitled to the trust?\n\n13        A.     I was really -- I was just sick.          Because I knew\n\n14   that it did not belong to him.\n\n15        Q.     Now, once you realized that there was now a\n\n16   dispute as to who was entitled to the       --   the trust assets, did\n\n17   you file any action in West Virginia?\n\n18        A.     No.\n\n19        Q.     File any legal action in West Virginia?\n\n20        A.     No,    I did not.\n\n21        Q.     Are you sure you didn't file a lawsuit in\n\n22   West Virginia?\n\n23        A.     About the -- about Matt wanting all of the money\n\n24   or\n\n25        Q.     Yeah.    Okay.      So --\n\n\n                              MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                         88\n\n\n 1         A.      I'm confused.     I'm sorry.\n\n 2         Q.      That's okay.\n\n 3                 MR. BOONE:     Judge, may I approach the witness?\n\n 4                 THE COURT:     You may.\n\n 5         Q.      (By Mr. Boone)     Linda, I'm going to show you a\n\n 6   document that's been filed\n\n 7        A.       Oh, yeah.\n\n 8        Q.       Okay.   Do you recognize this document?\n\n 9        A.       Yes, I do.\n\n10        Q.       All right.     Is your recollection refreshed as to\n\n11   what this document is?\n\n12        A.       This was our first filing for the -- for the --\n\n13   how the trust was supposed to be set up.        I mean, how the\n\n14   trust was set up and how it was -- all the heirs and\n\n15   everything.    And it took us hours to get all of this\n\n16   information together of all the heirs and everything to be\n\n17   able to file this document.\n\n18        Q.       I got you.     So why did you file -- so this\n\n19   document is asking the Court to determine who is entitled to\n\n20   what under the trust?\n\n21        A.       To the -- the heirs.\n\n22        Q.       The heirs.    Okay.   And why did you file in\n\n23   West Virginia?\n\n24        A.       Because the trust said that it's supposed to be\n\n25   into the state where most of the people -- the majority of the\n\n\n                                MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                  (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                              89\n\n\n     1   people lived.\n\n 2             Q.    All right.\n\n 3             A.    Of the heirs.\n\n 4                   THE COURT:     I'm going to ask another question.    So\n\n 5       you said there was 5.2 million dollars.       Is that lawsuit here\n\n 6       in the State of Texas when you're taking this deposition?\n\n 7                   THE WITNESS:     The deposition was here in the State\n\n 8       of Texas.\n\n 9                   THE COURT:     I mean, there is a lawsuit here other\n\n10       than this lawsuit?\n\n11                   THE WITNESS:     No.\n\n12                   MR. BOONE:     Judge, well, this account has been\n\n13       severed from the misappropriation lawsuit which was the\n\n14       genesis of this action.     There was a complaint filed by the\n\n15       trustee against Bob Schlager, Mateo Cortez essentially seeking\n\n16       some assets that --\n\n17                   THE COURT:     That's another lawsuit?\n\n18                   MR. THOMPSON:     You want me to address this?\n\n19                   MR. BOONE:     Yeah, why don't you --\n\n20                   MR. THOMPSON:     Your Honor, it was all the same\n\n21       lawsuit.\n\n22                   THE COURT:     Right.\n\n23                   MR. THOMPSON:     So Ms. Murray as trustee filed\n\n24       first against Mr. Cortez and some others about\n\n25       misappropriation.     Then Mr. Cortez counterclaimed and then\n\n\n                                  MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                    (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                                90\n\n\n 1   brought our clients in as third party defendants on the issues\n\n 2   we're talking about here today.\n\n 3                    THE COURT:     Okay.\n\n 4                    MR. THOMPSON:     The Court granted summary judgment\n\n 5   on those claims and we have severed those out.\n\n 6                    THE COURT:     Right.\n\n 7                    MR. THOMPSON:     And so when you say \"in this\n\n 8   matter 11   --\n\n\n\n\n 9                    THE COURT:     Well, okay.\n\n10                    MR. THOMPSON:           it's kind of halfway.\n\n11                    THE COURT:     Okay.     My question to you then is this\n\n12   i..isappropriation claim you have, how much is that fo'-·?\n\n13                    THE WITNESS:     $80,000.\n\n14                    THE COURT:     80,000.     Okay.     Thank you.\n\n15                    THE WITNESS:     Okay.     You're welcome.\n\n16                    MR. BOONE:     Okay.     May I approach?\n\n17                    THE COURT:     Yes.\n\n18          Q.        (By Mr. Boone)        I'm going to hand to you what I've\n\n19   marked as Exhibit 3.          Linda, do you recognize this?\n\n20         A.         Oh,   yes.\n\n21         Q.         What is this?\n\n22         A.

All right.      So this information was pulled from\n\n 2       the complaint that you filed in West Virginia, correct?\n\n 3                A.   Yes.\n\n 4                     MR.

(By Mr. Boone)      Now, Linda, the -- when you filed\n\n14       as trustee the lawsuit in West Virginia, how did your family\n\n15       react?\n\n16            A.       My family was not very happy with me.\n\n17            Q.       Why weren't they very happy with you, Linda?\n\n18            A.       They thought I was asking for too much money for\n\n19       commission.     They didn't think I should have any commission.\n\n20       They thought I should just do it, and I was double dipping\n\n21       taking heirship money and then taking commission also.\n\n22            Q.       Are you talking about the hours you noted in your\n\n23       complaint?\n\n24            A.       Yes.   Yes.\n\n25            Q.       Let's talk about your immediate family.

Yes.\n\n 9         Q.     All right.        Ma'am, after you filed the lawsuit in\n\n10    West Virginia did Mr. Mateo's efforts in Texas stop?\n\n11         A.     No.    No.\n\n12         Q.

And to your understanding were the heirs at law\n\n19    served with a copy of the complaint in West Virginia?\n\n20         A.     Yes, they were.\n\n21         Q,     All right.

And how did you feel after Judge Waters ruled that\n\n17   way?\n\n18          A.      I thought,    oh, maybe it's going to be over soon\n\n19   and I can have some time for myself.\n\n20          Q.    Okay.      But was it over?\n\n21          A.    No.\n\n22          Q.

Well, I just -- I can't get around anymore at all.\n\n 2   It's just been so much strain on me.        My doctors have all been\n\n 3   concerned about me.      I have had -- two of them at least have\n\n 4   said they have never ever seen me in this kind of shape.\n\n 5         Q.       Before this claim by Mateo Cortez did you exercise\n\n 6   on a somewhat regular basis?\n\n 7         A.       Oh, yeah, I walked five miles every morning and\n\n 8   I -- outside and -- and I walked two miles every evening on a\n\n 9   treadmill.\n\n10                  MR.

(By Mr. Boone)     Linda, could you take a look at\n\n13   this photograph, please?\n\n14        A.        Yes.\n\n15        Q.        Who is in this photograph?\n\n16        A.        My husband and myself.\n\n17        Q.        And, Ms. Murray, approximately when was this\n\n18   photograph taken?\n\n19        A.        It was taken in May, four years -- going to be\n\n20   four years.\n\n21        Q.        Okay.   Since Mateo Cortez asserting its claim,\n\n22   have you gained quite a bit of weight?\n\n23        A.        Yes.\n\n24        Q.        Have you had to increase medications for\n\n25   antianxiety?\n\n\n                                 MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                   (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                          96\n\n\n\n 1         A.    And depression.\n\n 2         Q.    Okay.\n\n 3         A.    It has put me into such a depression I -- they've\n\n 4   increased so much medicine on me a lot of times I           I just\n\n 5   get so confused.     And it's hurt my memory because of it all.\n\n 6   And I do the best I can because I promised Uncle Dorsey and\n\n 7   Aunt Phyl that I would do this.      And the doctors even told me\n\n 8   that I needed to get away from it.      But I can't because I\n\n 9   promised them.     They come to see me in California when he was\n\n10   in the service.     They were so good to me.   They had us out.\n\n11   And I was so close to Aunt Phyl and Dorsey and Debbie.        We\n\n12   spent a lot of weekends together at their house.      And I\n\n13   promised them I'd do it and I'm going to do it.\n\n14               MR. BOONE:     Okay.   Thank you, Ms. Murray.\n\n15               I pass the witness.\n\n16               THE COURT:     Any questions?\n\n17               MR.

Ms. Murray, we've gotten a little far afield as to\n\n22   whether or not my clients Mr. Brotherton and Mr. Hester have\n\n23   violated Texas Civil Practice and Remedies\n\n24               MR. THOMPSON:     Your Honor, I'm going to object to\n\n25   the sidebar and the -- construing her testimony.\n\n\n                              MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                           97\n\n\n 1               THE COURT:     That's proceed onward, please.

(By Mr. Ruback)     Ma'am, do you have any personal\n\n 5   knowledge of Mr. Brotherton's or Mr. Hester's intent at the\n\n 6   time they made the legal arguments they made?\n\n 7               MR. THOMPSON:      Objection, relevance.    This intent\n\n 8   thing is not a factor under the CPRC 10, Judge.\n\n 9               THE COURT:     Overrule the objection.\n\n10          Q.   (By Mr. Ruback)      Do you have any knowledge of\n\n11   their intent at the time they filed their pleadings?\n\n12          A.   Did I have any knowledge of what?        I don't\n\n13   understand the question.\n\n14          Q.   Of -- do you have any knowledge of whether or not\n\n15   they had good intent or bad intent in making certain legal\n\n16   arguments they made in this case?\n\n17          A.   I just thought they were way off.        I'm sorry.   I\n\n18   just\n\n19          Q.   Absolutely.     But -- but did you know what they\n\n20   were thinking at the time?\n\n21               MR. THOMPSON:      Objection, asked and answered.\n\n22               THE COURT:     Let's move along.\n\n23               MR. RUBACK:     Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n24          Q.   (By Mr. Ruback)      Do you know whether my clients\n\n25   performed any research before filing the documents they filed?\n\n\n                              MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                        98\n\n\n 1          A.      I do not know what they did.\n\n 2          Q.      Do you know if they consulted with any trust\n\n 3   experts before filing the filings that they did?\n\n 4          A.      No, I did not.\n\n 5          Q.      Okay.   You said that at your deposition it was\n\n 6   taken by the Brotherton Law Firm.      Wasn't your deposition in\n\n 7   fact taken by prior counsel with a gentleman named John Long?\n\n 8          A.      He was with the -- he was with the -- he is with\n\n 9   him.\n\n10          Q.      Was he with them at the time he took your\n\n11   deposition or was he a sole practitioner?\n\n12          A.      I have no idea.\n\n13          Q.      So you don't know whether your deposition, the one\n\n14   at issue that you talked at length about was taken by the\n\n15   Brotherton Law Firm or not?\n\n16          A.      No, I don't remember when he went with the\n\n17   Brotherton Law Firm.      I just know he was with the Brotherton\n\n18   Law Firm.   When I got the copy of the -- of the deposition\n\n19   myself I seen that it was signed by John Long.\n\n20          Q.      Okay.   So it was taken by John Long, not by\n\n21   Mr. Hester or Mr. Brotherton?\n\n22          A.      I -- to be honest I couldn't tell you what the man\n\n23   looked like.\n\n24          Q.      I understand completely, ma'am.

No.\n\n 3                    MR. RUBACK:     That is all, pass the witness, Your\n\n 4       Honor.\n\n 5                    THE COURT:     Anything further?\n\n 6                    MR. BOONE:     Judge, just a point of order.    I would\n\n 7       ask the Court to take judicial notice that's appropriate, that\n\n 8       among the names signed and featured under the signature of\n\n 9       Mr. Brotherton on the -- the Original Petition in Intervention\n\n10       is Mr. John C. Long, IV,     the gentleman\n\n11                    THE COURT:     So noted.\n\n12                    MR. BOONE:     Right.   But William Brotherton, of\n\n13       course, signed this document.\n\n14                    MR. RUBACK:     Just out of curiosity, I'm brand new\n\n15       to the case, do we have anything showing who took the\n\n16       deposition, whether it was associated with -- at the time they\n\n17       took the deposition?\n\n18                   MR. BOONE:     Yeah.     I can get you a copy of the\n\n19       transcript at some point, but as you'll see in the transcript,\n\n20       the copies that I have, the select documents, you'll see by\n\n21       Mr. Long.   \"I'm not asking $2,000, okay.\"\n\n22                   MR. RUBACK:     So it was definitely Mr. Long --\n\n23                   MR. BOONE:     Mr. Long --\n\n24                   MR.

THOMPSON:\n\n 7                  Judge, my name is Brian Thompson as the Court is\n\n 8   aware by now I'm sure.     I'm the attorney of record for the\n\n 9   third party defendants in this matter who are the movants in\n\n10   this motion.     I was licensed by the Supreme Court of Texas to\n\n11   practice law in the State of Texas in November of 2005 after\n\n12   completing my studies at the University of Texas School of\n\n13   Law.   Since that time I've practiced civil litigation in\n\n14   Travis County first with the law firm of McGinnis Lochridge       &\n\n15   Kilgore where I was a partner, now at the law firm of Hopper\n\n16   Mikeska which as this Court well knows is a law firm\n\n17   specializing in estate planning, administration, probate and\n\n18   trust litigation.\n\n19                  In my practice I've become familiar with customary\n\n20   rates for attorneys who practice in this area in Travis County\n\n21   and I believe that my rate charged in this matter falls within\n\n22   the range of reasonable fees.     My billable rate in this matter\n\n23   was set at $300 an hour except for all time after January 1st\n\n24   of this year has been charged at a rate of $325 per hour.\n\n25                  Your Honor, I would offer into evidence as\n\n\n                              MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                                102\n\n\n     1   Exhibit 5 a copy of my bills in this matter.\n\n     2                (Movant's Exhibit No. 5\n\n 3                   was offered into evidence.)\n\n 4                   THE COURT:     Any objection?\n\n 5                   MR. RUBACK:     No objection, Your Honor.\n\n 6                   THE COURT:     No. 5 will be admitted.\n\n 7                    (Movant's Exhibit No. 5\n\n 8                   was admitted into evidence.)\n\n 9                   MR.

THOMPSON:     Thank you, Judge.\n\n12                   As is set out in Exhibit 5 there is descriptions\n\n13       for all of the legal services that I have done in this case on\n\n14       behalf of my clients which I believe were reasonable and\n\n15       necessary in defending against the claims made by Mateo Cortez\n\n16       in this matter that implicated my clients.        In particular\n\n17       these fees were necessary in defending against Mateo Cortez'\n\n18       claim regarding the postponement provision.        And because this\n\n19       claim was inextricably intertwined with the other claim made\n\n20       by Cortez against my clients I have not been able to segregate\n\n21       the -- the fees between the two claims.        All of the time that\n\n22       I spent on one was spent on the other.\n\n23                   In addition, Mr. Boone is going to testify with\n\n24       regard to his fees.   I have reviewed those fees as well.         He\n\n25       will talk about those more in depth.     His rate is lower than\n\n\n                                  MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                    (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                        103\n\n\n 1   mine so I think it's also within the scope of reasonable fees\n\n 2   in Travis County in this area.     In addition I'll point out\n\n 3   that based on my review of Mr. Boone's fees he has segregated\n\n 4   out all of the time that he has spent with regard to the Texas\n\n 5   piece of the litigation versus the West Virginia piece.\n\n 6                Your Honor, my fees in this matter through\n\n 7   Thursday of last week, which is January the 26th, were\n\n 8   $49,800.   I believe I've spent an additional ten hours in\n\n 9   preparing for this hearing which would be an additional $3,250\n\n10   for a total of $53,000 -- $53,050.\n\n11                I will point out, because I do think it's\n\n12   important, that I incurred $18,650.04 before September\n\n13   the 15th, 2016 which was the date of Judge Waters' order out\n\n14   of West Virginia.   Thereafter I have incurred $34,399.96.        So\n\n15   if the Court puts some impetus on that West Virginia order\n\n16   that would be the amount we ask for.        But we're actually\n\n17   asking for the full $53,050 at this time.\n\n18               THE COURT:     Any questions?\n\n19               MR. RUBACK:     Yes.\n\n20\n\n21                             CROSS-EXAMINATION\n\n22   BY MR. RUBACK:\n\n23        Q.     Mr. Thompson, we keep hearing about Judge Waters'\n\n24   order, the interlocutory in West Virginia.       Do you believe\n\n25   that that order should be binding, that interlocutory order\n\n\n                              MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                           104\n\n\n     1   from West Virginia should be binding in this Court?\n\n 2                   MR. THOMPSON:     I'm going to object to the\n\n 3       relevance of that question as to my fees.\n\n 4                   THE COURT:     I'm going to overrule the objection.\n\n 5                   MR. THOMPSON:     No, in fact I actually stated that\n\n 6       in a pleading in this matter.     I stated that it is not binding\n\n 7       on this Court.    But I do think it is important to have shown\n\n 8       your clients' notice that that claim had already been decided\n\n 9       by another court in what I believe to be a very well reasoned\n\n10       opinion that cited not only the Texas and West Virginia law\n\n11       but also Florida law.    Under three different states' laws\n\n12       Judge Waters found that that claim had no merit and dismissed\n\n13       it.\n\n14             Q.    (By Mr. Ruback)     You mentioned the word \"notice\"\n\n15       in your last sentence, sir.     When did you first provide my\n\n16       clients' notice that you believed their conduct was\n\n17       sanctionable?    Was it right after their first alleged\n\n18       sanctionable conduct, their second, third, fourth,    fifth or\n\n19       not until after the final judgment in this case?\n\n20             A.    I believe that I've called this claim throughout\n\n21       my pleadings \"absurd.\"    That's a word that I've used\n\n22       frequently in this case regarding your clients' allegations.\n\n23       However, the first time I think that I stated that these were\n\n24       sanctionable under CPRC 10 and Rule 13 was upon the filing of\n\n25       my motion to modify judgment to include sanctions award which\n\n\n                                  MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                    (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                        105\n\n\n 1   was filed on January the 16th, 2017.\n\n 2        Q.      Okay.   So am my correct in understanding you\n\n 3   didn't bring the sanctionable nature of this conduct, alleged\n\n 4   sanctionable nature of this conduct to their attention after\n\n 5   any of these pleadings until there was a final judgment in\n\n 6   this case?\n\n 7        A.      I would -- I'm going to parse your statement.     I\n\n 8   mean, a final judgment, I think it -- I will agree with you\n\n 9   that it was not until after the summary judgment in this case.\n\n10   Whether that judgment was final or not I think somewhat relies\n\n11   on the outcome of this proceeding so --\n\n12        Q.      Okay.   Fair enough.    What you're saying is -- if\n\n13   I'm understanding you is you did not bring alleged\n\n14   sanctionable conduct to the attention of this Court or to my\n\n15   clients after any of these many documents were filed prior to\n\n16   the summary judgment having been signed by this Court?\n\n17        A.      I will agree with that statement.\n\n18                MR. RUBACK:     Thank you, sir.\n\n19                No more questions, Your Honor.\n\n20                THE COURT:    Anything further?\n\n21                Next witness?\n\n22                MR. THOMPSON:     Call Aaron Boone, Your Honor.\n\n23                THE COURT:    You can testify from there.\n\n24                MR. BOONE:    I'll do it.\n\n25                THE COURT:    Okay.\n\n\n                               MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                 (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                          106\n\n\n     1                               AARON BOONE,\n\n 2       was called as a witness by the Movant having been first duly\n\n 3       sworn, testified as follows:\n\n 4\n\n 5                                DIRECT EXAMINATION\n\n 6       BY MR. BOONE:\n\n 7                   Afternoon, Judge.     First off, thank you for the\n\n 8       courtesy of allowing me to appear before this Court.     My name\n\n 9       is Aaron Boone.   I'm with the law firm of Bowls Rice, LLP.\n\n10       Our main office is in Charleston, West Virginia.     My office is\n\n11       in Parkersburg, West Virginia.     I graduated William Mary\n\n12       undergrad law school at West Virginia University.     Been\n\n13       practicing since 2004.\n\n14                   I was contacted by a partner in my office who is\n\n15       an estate attorney, and he had been contacted by an estate\n\n16       lawyer in Florida for Connie Barry.     Connie Barry is one of\n\n17       the heirs at law that has been -- that had been identified in\n\n18       the complaint filed by the trustee in West Virginia.\n\n19                   My office was hired to defend Connie Barry's\n\n20       interests in West Virginia.     In doing so it became apparent\n\n21       that we needed to reach out to counsel in west -- in Texas,\n\n22       Austin, Texas in order to address the claims that Mateo Cortez\n\n23       had raised, including claims that he should have jurisdiction\n\n24       over the heirs at law, etcetera.\n\n25                   So my time has been spent not only defending the\n\n\n                                  MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                    (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                           107\n\n\n     1   efforts in West Virginia, the efforts of Mateo to convince the\n\n 2       West Virginia Court that he's entitled, but it's also been to\n\n 3       assist counsel here in Texas with defending the needs of the\n\n 4       heirs at law.\n\n 5                      Connie Barry is my only client but her interests\n\n 6       are aligned with the other heirs at law, therefore the work\n\n 7       I've done has been I think beneficial to all of them.     I'm the\n\n 8       one that facilitated the meetings, the agreements and just\n\n 9       kind of helped keep the wheels greased, you could say.\n\n10                      In preparation of today's motion for sanctions I\n\n11       have gone through all of my bills.     I have -- I have pulled\n\n12       out any entry that was clearly related to West Virginia.\n\n13       Okay?     To the extent there was an entry that was me talking\n\n14       about the West Virginia status and the Texas status I would\n\n15       just half that time, okay?\n\n16                      And so what I have for the Court's review are two\n\n17       statements.     The first -- the first statement is for activity\n\n18       beginning at the inception of my assistance which was on or\n\n19       about December 23rd, 2015, close to the time when that\n\n20       West Virginia action was filed, through January 27th of 2017.\n\n21       Those fees totaled $45,706.99.    As counsel mentioned my rate\n\n22       is 275.    I believe that is reasonable for my services knowing\n\n23       West Virginia but also to the extent they've been helpful here\n\n24       in this Court as well.\n\n25                      I have also prepared a statement for essentially\n\n\n                                  MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                    (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                        108\n\n\n 1   the time that we spent working this case in Texas, even after\n\n 2   Judge Waters entered very detailed findings of fact explaining\n\n 3   why Mateo should not be entitled to take under the trust.\n\n 4   Certainly at that point there was a very well reasoned\n\n 5   decision explaining why Mateo really should stop his claims.\n\n 6   And so I prepared a statement showing my fees from that moment\n\n 7   to January 27th, 2017 and that amount is $33,915.74.\n\n 8                 I had estimated my time since Friday through today\n\n 9   including the travel.       And that estimate, Judge, is $8,494.34.\n\n10   I'll mark that as Exhibit 8.\n\n11                 May I approach, Judge?\n\n12                 THE COURT:     Y0u may, sir.\n\n13                 MR. BOONE:     Judge, Mr. Thompson did a tally for\n\n14   you so I'll do the same.       If this Court is inclined to\n\n15   award -- award all the time from inception including the\n\n16   estimated time for this motion for sanctions, that comes up to\n\n17   $54,201.33.    Should the Court look instead to the time spent\n\n18   after the motion for summary judgment was vindicated in\n\n19   West Virginia that amount is $42,410.08.\n\n20                 Judge, at this time unless there is a question\n\n21   about those exhibits I'd move for those admissions.\n\n22                 (Movant's Exhibit Nos. 6, 7 and 8\n\n23                 were offered into evidence.)\n\n24                 THE COURT:    Any objection to 6, 7 and 8?\n\n25                 MR. ROBACK:    No objections, Your Honor.\n\n\n                                MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                  (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                           109\n\n\n     1               THE COURT:     6,   7 and 8 are admitted.\n\n 2                    (Movant's Exhibit Nos. 6, 7 and 8\n\n 3                   were admitted into evidence.)\n\n 4                   THE COURT:     And the last number you read out was\n\n 5       42,000 or 43,000 -- that is a combination of 7 and 8?\n\n 6                   MR. BOONE:     Yes, sir.\n\n 7                   THE COURT:     Thank you.\n\n 8                   Anything further?\n\n 9                   MR. BOONE:     No, thank you, Judge.\n\n10                   THE COURT:     Your witness.\n\n11\n\n12                                CROSS-EXAMINATION\n\n13       BY MR. RUBACK:\n\n14            Q.     Mr. Boone, when did you first advise my clients\n\n15       that you believed their conduct was sanctionable?\n\n16            A.     I think when we had a hearing -- I think it was\n\n17       back in February or March there was a room full of heirs at\n\n18       law in West Virginia, and there was Judge Waters, there was\n\n19       myself, there was several other attorneys.      And I -- I believe\n\n20       the discussion about the claims raised by Mateo Cortez, the\n\n21       discussion how they were without any merit at all should have\n\n22       given notice to the Brotherton Law Firm that these claims\n\n23       should not have been continued.\n\n24            Q.     So you did tell them you believed their claims had\n\n25       no merit, but did you tell them you believed that they were\n\n\n                                  MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                    (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                        110\n\n\n 1   sanctionable or violated Rule 13 or violated Chapter 10?\n\n 2          A.     No, sir.\n\n 3            Q.   And did you make clear to them that your arguments\n\n 4   in the West Virginia courtroom applied equally to all their\n\n 5   filings in this Texas case?\n\n 6          A.     I'm sorry.    Repeat that?\n\n 7          Q.     You indicated that in a West Virginia courtroom\n\n 8   you told them that their arguments that they'd been making\n\n 9   when you were in the West Virginia courtroom were meritless.\n\n10   Did you make very clear to them you felt the same way about\n\n11   the arguments they were making in their filings in this Texas\n\n12   Court?\n\n13          A.     Not specifically.\n\n14                 MR. RUBACK:     Thank you.   No further questions,\n\n15   sir.\n\n16                 THE COURT:    Do you rest?\n\n17                 MR.

RUBACK:     No, Your Honor.\n\n21                 THE COURT:    Do you rest?\n\n22                 MR. ROBACK:     No, Your Honor.\n\n23                 THE COURT:    Okay.   The Court is going to take this\n\n24   matter under advisement but I am denying the motion for\n\n25   rehearing my previous ruling.

Smith, Patricia Chapman, Betty J. Marks\n\nWebb, James Berl Marks, Linda Murray, Thomas Wayne Marks, Donald Leman Whited,\n\nMichael Ray Whited, Terry Lee Whited and Sherry Lynn Whited Salsbury (collectively \"Third\n\nParty Defendants\"). Having considered the Motion, the response thereto, the admissible\n\nevidence, the other papers on file in this matter, and the arguments of counsel, the Court hereby\n\nGRANTS the Motion in part and makes the following findings and orders:\n\n       The Court finds that attorney William J. Brotherton violated Texas Civil Practices and\n\nRemedies Code Chapter IO in signing the Original Petition in Intervention, the First Amended\n\n                                                I\n                                                              EXHIBIT\n                                                                  G\n\f                                       No. C-1-PB-16-002348\n\n\n Petition in Intervention and Third Party Petition, Second Amended Petition in Intervention and\n\n Third Party Petition, the Third Amended Petition in Intervention and Third Party Petition, and\n\nthe Fourth Petition in Intervention filed in this matter. In particular, the Court finds that Mr.\n\nBrotherton violated Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code § 10.001 by signing these\n\npleadings because each of them contained the claim that Deborah Cortez was entitled to all\n\nassets from The William D. Short and Phyllis D. Short Revocable Living Trust (the ''Trust\")\n\nupon the death of Phyllis Short because Deborah was over the age of 35 when Ms. Short died.\n\nThe Court finds that the plain language of the Trust foreclosed such a claim and that this claim\n\nwas not warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for the extension, modification,\n\nor reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.\n\n       The Court further finds that attorney William J. Brotherton should have known that as of\n\nSeptember 16, 2016, his legal position regarding postponement of the trust was untenable. By\n\nmaintaining that legal position in his Fourth Petition in Intervention, he caused the Third Party\n\nDefendants to incur additional attorneys' fees in responding to attorney William J. Brotherton's\n\nclaim regarding postponement of the trust.\n\n       The Court hereby sanctions William J. Brotherton and the Brotherton Law Firm, jointly\n\nand severally, in the amount of $31,150.76 for fees incurred for work done by Brian Thompson\n\nand his associates at Hopper Mikeska, PLLC and $33,980.00 for fees incurred by Aaron Boone\n\nand his associate attorney at Bowles Rice, LLP, for a total of$65,130.76. The Court orders that\n\nthis amount be paid to the Third Party Defendants within 30 days of the entry of this order. The\n\nCourt finds that there is a direct relationship between the sanctions being imposed and Mr.\n\nBrotherton's sanctionable conduct, in that the aforesaid amount represents reasonable and\n\nnecessary attorneys' fees expended by attorneys for the Third Part Defendants to defend against\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f                                     No. C-1-PB-16-002348\n\n\nthe frivolous claims advanced by William J. Brotherton and the Brotherton Law Finn; that the\n\nsanctions are not excessive; and that these sanctions will appropriately deter other attorneys from\n\nsigning pleadings containing claims that violate Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code\n\nChapter 10.\n\n       The Court hereby modifies its judgment entered on December 19, 2016, to include this\n\naward of sanctions.\n\n       Signed this 10th day of February, 2017.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f                                 CAUSE NO.

Waters's September 9, 2015, order concluding that neither Mateo\n  Cortez nor the Estate of Deborah Cortez is entitled to share in the trust:\n\n                     Because Deborah was over the age of 35 when Mrs. Short died,\n                     Cortez believes that the Trust should have immediately terminated\n                     and the entirety of the Trust assets distributed to Deborah, which\n                     Cortez would have then inherited from Deborah upon her death. . ..\n                     The Court cannot, and does not, accept Mateo Cmtez's reading of the\n                     Trust, which would nullify the provisions of Article VIII, Sections A-\n                     C.\n\n                                                               EXHIBIT\n                                                                    H\n\f                                                  41\\ Bowles Rice,,.\n William J. Brotherton, Esquire\n February 23,2017\n Page 2\n\n\n (Order, 09-09-2015, Circuit Court of Wood County). In sum, cornts in both Texas and West\n Virginia have now entered orders finding that neither the Estate of Deborah Cortez nor your client,\n Mateo Cortez, qualify as an heir-at-law entitled to take in the trust assets (\"Trust Assets\").\n\n                 Nevertheless, despite these losses, your client continues to pursue civil litigation\nbefore the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, in Charleston,\nWest Virginia, and an appeal before the Third Court of Appeals, in Austin, Texas. Undoubtedly,\nfurther litigation will cost my client, and the other heirs-at-law, significant legal fees. The purpose\nof this letter to demand that Mateo Cortez and/or the Estate of Deborah Cortez immediately\nwithdraw any and all claims to the Trust Assets.\n\n               As you may recall, at the January 30, 2017, hearing, your counsel argued,\nunsuccessfully, that sanctions should not be awru·ded against you, in part, because I never explicitly\nwarned you that I would file a motion for sru1ctions if you continued to pursue ·such claims.\nAlthough I (and apparently Judge Herman) disagree that a warning is necessary, I wish to now\nmake clear that if you and/or your client, Mateo Cortez (either personally or as representative of tile\nEstate of Deborah Cortez) do not immediately withdraw any and all claims to the Trust Assets, then\nI will take appropriate action to: (a) seek additional sanctions against your firm and (b) seek\nsanctions against Mr. Mateo Cortez personally. 1\n\n               1 recognize that Mateo Cortez ru1d the Trust have pending claims against one\nanother, including claims relating to proceeds from an asbestos settlement (\"Asbestos Claims\").\nNevertheless, there is no reason for Mr. Cortez, while resolving the Asbestos Claims, to continue to\npursue the meritless claim that he and/or the Estate of Deborah Cortez is entitled to the Trust\nAssets. Accordingly, I demand that yo1.1 immediately enter appropriate orders dismissing such\nclaims in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia and in the Third\nCourt of Appeals, in Austin, Texas, If you would like for me to prepru·e proposed dismissal orders,\nthen I would be happy to do so.\n\n               Finally, as you know, Judge Herman ordered you to pay the total sum of $65,130.76\nwithin thirty (30) days of his February 10, 201 7, order. Kindly submit $31,150.76 to I-lopper\n\n         1\n           Please remember that my client's Motion for Attorney Fees and Costs is pending before the United States\nDistrict Court of the Southern District of West Virginia, (Document No. 7). Additionally, please note that Rule 45 of\nthe Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure states:\n                 Rule 45: Damages for Frivolous Appeals in Civil Cases: If the court of appeals\n                 detennines that an appeal is frivolous, it may--on motion of any party or on its own\n                 initiative, after notice and a reasonable opportunity for response--award each\n                 prevailing party just damages. ln detennining whether to award damages, the court\n                 must not consider any matter that does not appear in the record, briefs, or other\n                 papers filed in tl1e court of appeals\n\nTex.

Short and Phyllis D. Short Revocable Living Trust including the Credit\n       Shelter Trust Created Therein v. Mateo Cortez and Wells Fargo Bank, NA.\n\n       Civil Action No. 2:16-cv-09951; Linda Murray v. Linda Lou Murray, et al.\n\n       Cause No. C-l-PB-16-002348; Cortez v. Brown et al.\n\nDear Mr. Boone:\n\n       We are in receipt of your letter dated February 23, 2017, in which your clients make\nthe demand that our client withdraws all of his claims to the Trust or your client will file\nadditional sanctions. We now respond to such demand.\n\n        First, the orders that your clients reference are not final orders. We completely\ndisagree with both orders as both orders are riddled with errors and inaccuracies. We stand\nfirm that the plain and clear language of the Trust entitled Deborah Cortez to receive all\nfunds of the Trust during her lifetime; therefore, a claim from the Estate was filed. Until\nrecently, there seemed to be some confusion regarding your clients' understanding of our\nclaims, which is reflected in both summary judgment motions and orders in the two Courts.\nWe do not believe either of the summary judgments will stand on appeal.\n\n        Second, our client will not simply waive the right to an appeal on such erroneous\nrulings. We will be taking the appropriate steps to proceed with correcting the errors in the\ntrial court; however, we are prepared to appeal if the trial court refuses to correct the errors.\nSince you, your clients, and Mr. Thompson have made this personal, you have left us with no\nchoice but to appeal the excessive and baseless sanctions order. We clearly met our burden\n\n\n\n                                           EXHIBIT\n                                                I\n\f Aaron C. Boone\n March 1, 2017\n Page 2\n\n\nregarding the sanctions, but it has been made clear by Mr. Thompson that he uses sanctions\nas a tactic in litigation and has been allowed to do so in the Travis County Courts. We\nbelieve that this tactic is a threat to all lawyers who practice in good faith in Texas and that it\nis a serious violation of public policy. It will absolutely be appealed.\n\n        Third, your letter seems to indicate that you want us to enter orders dismissing claims\nin the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia as well. We\nhave no claims in West Virginia. A review of the Court's record would clearly demonstrate\nthat Linda Murray filed that suit - just as she initiated the Texas litigation. However, if you\nwould like to do a joint dismissal in West Virginia and adhere to the Texas Courts'\njurisdiction, we would be happy to consider such. Please feel free to draft the agreed\ndismissal for our review.\n\n      Lastly, as stated above, we will be proceeding forward. At such time that the orders\nbecome final, we will be superseding the judgment during the appeal.\n\n\n\n\nWJB/ab\n\ncc:      Brian Thompson (via email: bthompson@hoppermikeska.com)\n         James W.

Linda Lou Mun-ay et al.\n                         Civil Action No. 15-C-28, Circuit Court of Wirt County, West Virginia\n\n Ladies & Gentlemen:\n\n               The purpose of this letter is to put you and your client on notice that my client intends\nto seek sanctions pursuant to Rule 11 of the West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure, or pursuant to\nthe Court's inherent authority to sanction bad faith litigation conduct, unless your client immediately\nceases and desists from continuing to pursue claims to the William D. Sh011 and Phyllis D. Short\nRevocable Living Trust Dated April 30, 1991, either in his personal capacity or by proxy through\n\"the Estate of Deborah Cortez.\"\n\n              The tenns of the Trust instrument are crystal clear, and have been ruled upon as a\nmatter oflaw by both the Circuit Court of Wirt County, West Virginia and the Probate Court of Travis\n\n\n                                                         EXHIBIT\n                                                              J\n\f                                            tJ' Bowles Rice,,.\n  BAILEY & WYANT, PLLC\n  BROTHERTON LAW FIRM\n  June 26, 2017\n  Page2\n\n\n\nCounty, Texas. The plain language of the Trust instrnment makes no provision for your client. Your\nclient has no claim to the Trust, either in his personal capacity or as representative of \"the Estate of\nDeborah Coitez.\" Your client's claims to the contrary lack any basis in the Trust instrument or\nsupport under the law, and have already been sanctioned in Texas. Unless your client withdraws his\nfrivolous pleadings, my client will seek the same sanctions in West Virginia.\n\n                The Circuit Court of Wirt County, West Virginia granted summary judgment against\nyour client on September 15, 2016. The Probate Court of Travis County, Texas followed suit on\nDecember I 9, 2016. Both courts rejected your client's claims, and pursuant lo the patties' Rule 11\nAgreement you are bound to abide by those rulings. Nonetheless, you continue to file :frivolous\npleadings in West Virginia, with the admitted purpose of obstructing the Court's resolution of the\nTrustee's motion for summary judgment. Moreover, it is clear that your client is intentionally driving\nup the cost of this litigation to retaliate against the Trnstee and the Trust's rightful beneficiaries.\n\n                The course of action you are pursuing in West Virginia has already been found by the\nTexas court to be frivolous as a matter of law. Moreover, there is sufficient evidence to make a\ncompelling case to the Court that your client's continued pursuit of this matter is being conducted in\nbad faith. If your client is unwilling to do the right thing and dismiss his frivolous claims to the Trust,\nthen my client has authorized me to aggressively pursue sanctions against you for facilitating his\nwrongful conduct.\n\n                This matter is set for heai-ing tomorrow in the Circuit Court of Wirt County, West\nVirginia. I strongly urge your client to immediately cease his frivolous and futile pursuit of the Trust,\nand to dismiss his claims with prejudice at tomo1Tow' s hearing.\n\n                                                        Sincerely,\n\n                                              ~- <!.             ;3o~\n                                                       Aaron C.

As it relates to the first prong under Rule 59(e), \"intervening change in\n\n controlling law\", Defendant Cortez identifies no intervening change in controlling law in either\n\n his Motion to Alter filed on September 29, 2016, or his oral arguments presented on June 27, 2017.\n\n As such, this Court CONCLUDES that it cannot alter or modify the subject Order based upon any\n\n alleged intervening change in law.\n\n\n                                   Second Prong under Rule 59(e)\n                               Mateo Cortez Identifies No New Evidence\n\n                   15.    As it relates to the second prong under Rule 59(e), \"new evidence\",\n\nDefendant Cortez identifies no new evidence in either his Motion to Alter or his oral arguments;\n\nas such, this Court CONCLUDES that it cannot alter or modify the subject Order based upon this\n\nprovision under Rule 59(e).\n\n\n                                    Third Prong under Rule 59(e)\n           Mateo Cortez Fails to Demonstrate this Court Committed Any Clear Error of Law\n\n                  16.    As it relates to the third prong under Rule 59(e), \"clear error oflaw\", Mateo\n\nCortez proffers several arguments to suggest that this Court committed clear error. First, Mateo\n\nCortez argues that this Court improperly refused to dismiss and/or abstain from adjudicating the\n\nComplaint. Second, Mateo Cortez argues this Court incorrectly concluded that Mateo Cortez\n\nand/or the Estate of Deborah Cortez is not a beneficiary under the Trust.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\f              17.     As it relates to the first alleged \"clear error\", namely refusal to dismiss\n\nand/or abstain, this Court CONCLUDES that this argument fails for several reasons:\n\n\n                      a.      First, the issue of whether this Court must abstain and/or defer to\n\n              Texas has been fully vetted by both this Court and the Supreme Court of Appeals\n\n              of West Virginia. Nothing presented by Mateo Cortez has persuaded this Court to\n\n              veer from its earlier determination (and/or from the Supreme Court of Appeals of\n\n              West Virginia's ruling), that the Circuit Court of Wirt County is permitted to\n\n              address the issues presented in the Complaint, including, but not limited to, the\n\n              critical issue of who does and does not qualify as a beneficiary under the Trust.\n\n\n                      b.      Second, in further support of Mateo Cortez's argument that this\n\n              Court has committed clear error in refusing to defer to Texas, Mateo Cortez argues\n\n              that circumstances have changed, ameliorating in favor of Texas now serving as the\n\n              sole arbiter.\n\n\n                              1.    Specifically, Mateo Cortez argues that, when this Court\n\n                      decided on March 16, 2016, to retain sole jurisdiction over this Complaint,\n\n                      this Court did so because Texas did not have jurisdiction over the numerous\n\n                      individuals identified in the Complaint. Mateo Cortez further argues that,\n\n                      subsequent to this Court's March 16, 2016, Order denying Mateo's Motion\n\n                      to Dismiss per Rule 12(b), and subsequent to this Court's September 15,\n\n                      2016 Order granting Connie Barry's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment,\n\n                      the Probate Court of Travis County, Texas, acquired jurisdiction over the\n\n                      heirs-at-law; as such, Mateo Cortez reasons, this Court should rescind its\n\n\n\n                                               5\n\fprior order granting summary judgment in favor of Connie Barry, dismiss\n\nand/or stay this action, and let the Probate Court of Travis County, Texas,\n\nhandle this case.\n\n\n         11.    However, this Court notes that, although the Probate Court\n\nof Travis County, Texas, did, for a period of time, obtain jurisdiction over\n\nmany of the individuals identified in the Complaint, the Probate Court's\n\nplenary power in that action has now expired, meaning it no longer has\n\njurisdiction over said individuals.\n\n\n        111.   Regardless, the decision of this Court to retain jurisdiction\n\nwas never solely predicated on whether the Probate County Court of Travis\n\nCounty, Texas, had jurisdiction over all the individuals identified the\n\nComplaint. Rather, this Court retained jurisdiction due to multiple factors\n\nthat weighed in favor of retaining jurisdiction and that continue to weigh in\n\nfavor of maintaining jurisdiction; those factors include, but are not limited\n\nto:\n\n\n               a)      West Virginia has jurisdiction over the real property\n\n        interests contained in the Trust.\n\n\n               b)      While it might be less convenient for Defendant\n\n        Cortez to proceed in West Virginia, it does not work a substantial\n\n        injustice to him to require him to adjudicate the distribution of the\n\n        Trust Assets where the majority of the potential beneficiaries reside\n\n\n\n\n                          6\n\f                 and where the Trust is actually administered, as required by the\n\n                 Trust instruments themselves.\n\n\n                        c)      The fact that the Trustee filed a tort action in Texas\n\n                 to stop misappropriation of the Trust Assets does not mean that the\n\n                 Trustee specifically availed herself of a Texas forum for any aspect\n\n                 of the Trust's administration.\n\n\n                        d)      Plaintiff Linda Murray is a resident of West Virginia,\n\n                 and administers the Trust from West Virginia. The situs of the\n\n                 Trust is located in West Virginia.\n\n\n                       e)      The fact that the Estates of William and Phyllis Short\n\n                 were probated in Texas, or that the Estate of Deborah Cortez is\n\n                located in Texas, is entirely irrelevant because the Trust is not part\n\n                of any of those Estates.\n\n\n        c.     Finally, although not dispositive, another reason to support this\n\nCourt's conclusion that no \"clear error\" has been made with respect to its decision\n\nto retain jurisdiction, this Court recognizes that its distinguished peer in Texas, the\n\nHon. Guy Herman, Judge, chose not to preclude, interrupt, or even object to West\n\nVirginia handling this case. At a December 18, 2015, hearing in the Probate Court\n\nof Travis County, Texas, which occurred over a month after the Trustee initiated\n\nthis action on November 20, 2015, the following verbal exchange occurred between\n\nJudge Herman and Counsel:\n\n\n\n\n                                  7\n\f               THE COURT: I'm not going to prohibit them from proceeding, I'm\n               not going order (sic) them to dismiss in West Virginia. You all can\n               go to West Virginia and argue.\n\n               MR. BROTHERTON: The problem is of course, Your Honor, is\n               our guy has limited funds and -\n\n               THE COURT: But he's got good lawyers, so - who are looking at\n               an opportunity if you're right of getting five million dollars.\n\n               MR. COHEN: Yeah.\n\n               THE COURT: I'm sure that you can ---\n\n               MR. COHEN: Should have signed a contingent fee.\n\n               THE COURT: --- make your way to West Virginia.\n\n(Exhibit C to Defendant's Response, Transcript of hearing of December 17, 2015, the Honorable\nGuy Herman, Judge, Travis County Probate Court, Travis County, Texas, Trial Court Cause No.\nC-1-PB-14-001564.)\n\n               18.    As it relates to the second alleged \"clear error\", namely that this Court\n\nincorrectly concluded that neither Mateo Cortez nor the Estate of Deborah Cortez are beneficiaries\n\nof the Trust, this Court CONCLUDES that this argument fails for several reasons:\n\n\n                      a.      At the outset, it is important to note that Mateo Cortez has proffered\n\n               multiple theories (at different stages in this case) in support of his singular claim\n\n              that he, as the sole heir to the Estate of his deceased-spouse Deborah Cortez, is the\n\n              sole beneficiary of the assets of the Trust.\n\n\n                               I.     First Theory:   In his May 9, 2016, Response to Connie\n\n                      Barry's Motion for Summary Judgment, Mateo Cortez argues that the\n\n                      \"Postponement of Possession,\" \"Termination\" paragraph under Article\n\n                      VIII, Section D, Subsection 2 supports his claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                                8\n\f                               ll.    Second Theory:      In his September 29, 2016, Motion to\n\n                      Amend or Alter, he argues that the \"Alternate Distribution\" paragraph under\n\n                      Article VIII, Section C supports his claim.\n\n\n                               m.     Third Theory:     During the June 27, 2017, hearing, he\n\n                      indicated he intends to argue (before the Probate Court of Travis County,\n\n                      Texas) that the \"Specific Distribution,\" \"Cash Distribution to Deborah\"\n\n                      paragraph under Article VIII, Section A, Subsection 2 supports his claim.\n\n\n                      b.      Furthermore, it is important to note that no one disputes that the\n\n              subject Trust is the legitimate, applicable, and controlling document expressing the\n\n              settlors' intent with respect to the Trust Assets. Additionally, there is no dispute\n\n              that, at all times pertinent, the Trust has been known to Mateo Cortez and his\n\n              counsel. Finally, there is no dispute that the Trust is unambiguous:\n\n\n              Defendant Barry is correct in that Mr. Cortez is not an heir at law\n              and correct in that the Trust expresses the true intent of the parties\n              and unambiguous language. Defendant Barry is incorrect, however,\n              in deducing what the meaning of the plain and unambiguous\n              language is.\n\n(Defendant Mateo Cortez's Response to Defendant Connie Lou Keith Barry's Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, p. 7.)\n\n              As such, this Court sees no reason why Mateo Cortez could not have proffered any\n\n              and all theories to support his singular claim prior to entry of this Court's decision\n\n              to grant partial summary judgment in favor of Connie Barry and against Mateo\n\n              Cortez on September 15~ 2016.\n\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\f       a.       Notwithstanding, this Court CONCLUDES that no theory expressed\n\nby Mateo Cortez could support his singular claim that he, as the sole heir to the\n\nEstate of his deceased-spouse Deborah Cortez, is the sole beneficiary of the assets\n\nof the Trust:\n\n\n                1.     As it relates to Mateo Cortez's first theory, this Court has\n\n       already explained why the \"Postponement of Possession,\" \"Termination\"\n\n       provision of the Trust does not support Mateo Cortez's claim. (Order\n\n       Granting Partial Summary Judgment, p. 8). In his Motion to Amend or\n\n       Alter, Mateo Cortez proffers no argument as to why this Court's decision\n\n       regarding the Postponement Provision qualifies as clear error.\n\n\n                11.   As it relates to Mateo Cortez's second theory, this Court\n\n       adopts the rationale espoused in the response of Connie Barry, namely that\n\n       the determination of who qualifies as an \"heir-at-law\", within the \"Alternate\n\n       Distribution\" paragraph under Article VIII, Section C, inherently includes\n\n       only those then-living at the time of the Deborah Cortez's death.\n\n       Accordingly, neither Mateo Cortez, nor the Estate of Deborah Cortez\n\n       qualify, as an heir-at-law within the \"Alternate Distribution\" paragraph\n\n       under Article VIII, Section C. To conclude otherwise would render the\n\n       Trust nonsensical and would run contrary to the clear intent of the settlors.\n\n       Moreover, Mateo Cortez admitted in his response to the motion for\n\n       summary judgment that he was not an heir at law of either settlor.\n\n\n\n\n                                10\n\f                                      111.    Additionally, although not dispositive, this Court recognizes\n\n                            that not only has it concluded that neither Mateo Cortez nor the Estate of\n\n                            Deborah Cortez are beneficiaries under the trust, but the Texas Court has\n\n                            also concluded that neither Cortez nor the Estate of Deborah Cortez are\n\n                            beneficiaries:\n\n\n                   It is therefore, ORDERED, that Mateo Cortez's claims against Third\n                   Party Defendants in this lawsuit are dismissed in their entirety. In\n                   particular, the Court hereby dismisses any and all claims that\n                   Mateo Cortez, in his individual capacity or in his capacity as\n                   personal representative ofthe Estate ofDeborah Cortez, has to any\n                   assets of The William D. Short and Phyllis D. Short Revocable\n                   Living Trust (the \"Trust\"), other than his claim for undistributed\n                   income from the Trust during the life of Deborah Cortez.\n\n(Exhibit B, Order Granting Third Party Defendants' Traditional and No Evidence Motion for\nSummary Judgment, Civil Action No. C-1-OB-14-1564 (Tex. Probate Ct. Dec. 19, 2016)\n(emphasis added). 2\n\n                                     1v.     Finally, as it relates to Mateo Cortez's third theory, this\n\n                           Court finds that regardless of whatever new and/or novel theory Mateo\n\n                           Cortez would seek to proffer, this Court has already determined, and today\n\n                           reaffirms, its conclusion that the Trust is unambiguous and clearly expresses\n\n                           the intent of the settlers that, upon the death of Deborah Short, the Trustee\n\n                           should distribute 1/2 of the remaining Trust Assets to the then-living heirs\n\n                           of William D. Short and 1/2 to then-living heirs of Phyllis D. Short.\n\n\n\n\n         2 The Texas court subsequently amended its judgment to include monetary sanctions against Mateo Cortez's\nattorneys, finding that the arguments which Mateo Cortez advanced in Texas were frivolous and were not warranted\nby existing law; the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law; or the establishment of new law. The Texas\ncourt sanctioned Mateo Cortez's attorneys in the amount of $65,130.76 for driving up Defendant Barry's legal fees in\nTexas with frivolous claims.\n\n\n                                                         11\n\f                                Fourth Prong under Rule 59(e)\n                             Mateo Cortez fails to demonstrate that\n       \"Manifest Injustice\" would occur if this Court denies his Motion to Amend or Alter\n\n                19.    Lastly, in his motion, Mateo Cortez suggests that manifest injustice would\n\noccur in denying his Motion to Amend, in part, because the Estate of Deborah Cortez is not a party\n\nto the lawsuit. Mateo Cortez failed to present this argument prior to judgment and therefore waived\n\nit. See W.Va. R. Civ. P. 12(h) (defenses other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction are waived\n\nunless raised prior to judgment). The Court also notes its prior rulings that the Estate of Deborah\n\nCortez has no interest in the Trust or the Trust assets, and therefore is neither necessary nor\n\nindispensable to this action.\n\n\n               20.     Moreover, this Court finds that the applicant was adequately represented by\n\nMateo Cortez, who is the administrator and sole heir of the Estate of Deborah Cortez.\n\n\n                       a.       As to adequacy of representation by existing parties, \"generally\n\n               courts compare the interests asserted by the proposed intervenor with the interests\n\n               of the existing party. If the proposed intervenor's interest is not represented by the\n\n               existing party, or the existing party's interests are adverse to those of the proposed\n\n               intervenor, intervention should be granted .... [However], if the interests are\n\n               identical, intervention should be denied unless there is a compelling showing as to\n\n               why the existing representation is inadequate.\" State ex rel.

Mateo Cortez, in both his personal capacity and in his capacity as\n\n               the Personal Representative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez, have identical\n\n               interests in this action: both seek an order directing that all the assets of the Trust\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\f                 be distributed to Mateo Cortez, either through direct distribution to Mateo Cortez\n\n                 personally or indirectly through distribution to the Estate of Deborah Cortez, which\n\n                then flows through to Mateo Cortez personally as its sole heir. This identity of\n\n                interest is clear from the undisputed fact that Mateo Cortez controls every decision\n\n                made on behalf of the Estate of Deborah Cortez, and is the only heir and beneficiary\n\n                of the estate.\n\n\n                        c.       Additionally, Mateo Cortez's attorneys represent him in both his\n\n                individual capacity and in his capacity as the Personal Representative of the Estate\n\n                of Deborah Cortez, which would violate the West Virginia Rules of Professional\n\n                Conduct if their interests were adverse in any way. See W.Va. R. Prof. Conduct§\n\n                1.7 (simultaneous representation of adverse parties in litigation is a non-waivable\n\n                conflict of interest).\n\n\n                21.     Accordingly, this Court CONCLUDES that manifest injustice would NOT\n\noccur by denying the Motion to Amend because (as Mateo Cortez argues), the Estate of Deborah\n\nCortez is not a party to this action.\n\n\n                                               Ruling\n\n                For the reasons set forth above, and as stated more fully upon the record, this Court\n\nDENIES the motion to amend or alter filed by Mateo Cortez.\n\n\n                The Court notes that Defendant Connie Lou Keith Barry has filed a motion for\n\nsanctions against Mateo Cortez, in either his personal capacity or in his capacity as the Personal\n\nRepresentative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez, and his attorneys.

After considering the Motion, the response of defendant\n\nConnie Barry, the response of the Trustee, the arguments of counsel, and the record, this Court\n\nhereby DENIES the Motion for the reasons stated on the record and more fully below.\n\n\n                                       Procedural Posture\n\n                1.      On June 12, 2017, Defendant Mateo Cortez filed Defendant Mateo Cortez's\n\nMotion to Dismiss and Memorandum of Law in Support Thereof (the \"Motion\"), requesting that\n\nthe Court dismiss this action pursuant to Rule 12(6) of the West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nMateo Cortez argues that this action should be dismissed because lhere is a previously-filed action\n\npending in Texas on the same subject matter between the same parties, and as a result the Texas\n\ncourt has exclusive jurisdiction.\n\n\n                2.      On June 22, 2017, Plaintiff Linda Murray, in her capacity as Successor\n\nTrustee of the Trust (the \"Trustee\"), filed a response in opposition to the Motion. On June 23,\n\n   FILED\nCircuit Court\nDate   Q-/tl-17\n     CLERK   if_\n\f2017, Defendant Connie Lou Keith Barry (\"Barry\"), liled u response in opposition to the Motion\n\nand a request for sanctions. On June 27, 2017, the Court conducted a hearing on the Motion and\n\nother matters. The Court has reviewed the Motion, supporting memorandum and exhibits, the\n\nTrustee and Barry's responses and supporting exhibits, the Trust instrument, and entertained the\n\narguments of the parties. The Court has also reviewed the entire record in this matter as part of its\n\nconsideration of this Motion and the other matters pending before it.\n\n\n                            Findings of Fact & Conclusions of Law\n\n               3.      This action involves the proper distribution of the assets of the \"William D.\n\nShort and Phyllis D. Short Revocable Living Family Trust Dated April 30, 1991,\" as amended and\n\nrestated by the \"Second Amendment and Restatement of The William D. Short and Phyllis D.\n\nShort Revocable Living Trust\" dated January 5, 2000 (collectively, the \"Trust\").\n\n\n               4.     This Court recognizes that, prior to instituting this action in Wirt County,\n\nWest Virginia, the Trustee asserted a claim in Texas.\n\n\n                      a.      On August 28, 2014, the Trustee filed an action against Mateo\n\n              Cortez in the Probate Court of Travis County, Texas, alleging that Mateo Cortez\n\n              conspired to misappropriate funds from the Trust.\n\n\n                      b.      On June 30, 2015, Mateo Cortez filed a petition in intervention\n\n              within the Trustee's misappropriation action in Texas, seeking a declaratory\n\n              judgment that Deborah Cortez was entitled to all of the Trust assets during her life,\n\n              and an order directing the Trustee to distribute the remaining Trust assets to the\n\n              Estate of Deborah Cortez.\n\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\f                          c.     On November 16, 2015, the Trustee filed a motion for summary\n\n                judgment in Texas, arguing that Mateo Cortez filed his petition in intervention\n\n                solely to avoid liability on the Trustee's misappropriation claim.\n\n\n                5.        On November 20, 2015, the Trustee filed this action in the Circuit Court of\n\n Wirt County, West Virginia, to obtain \"an order directing the distribution of the assets of the Trust\n\nto those persons determined by this Court to be entitled to receive the same in such proportions as\n\nmay be determined by this Court to be proper and in conformity with the intent of the settlors of\n\nthe Trust.\" The Trustee joined and served numerous defendants, including Mateo Cortez. The\n\nTrustee joined and served Mateo Cortez as a defendant because he \"claims that as the surviving\n\nspouse of Deborah Ann (Short) Cortez he is entitled to the trust proceeds. His claim is without\n\nlegal merit; nevertheless, in order that he may appear and protect his interest, if any, he is named\n\nas a defendant herein.\"\n\n\n               6.      On December 18, 2015, the Texas court held a hearing on a temporary\n\nrestraining order and request for injunctive relief filed by Mateo Cortez. As part of his request for\n\nrelief, Mateo Cortez sought an order from the Texas court enjoining the Trustee from proceeding\n\nany further in West Virginia and requiring her to dismiss this action. The Texas court refused to\n\ninterfere with the Trustee's claims in this court: \"THE COURT: I'm not going to prohibit them\n\nfrom proceeding, I'm not going to order them to dismiss in West Virginia. You all can go to West\n\nVirginia and argue.\"\n\n\n               7.      On December 28, 2015 Mateo Cortez filed a Rule 12(b) motion to dismiss\n\nthis action pursuant to the doctrine of forum non conveniens, arguing that this action should be\n\ndismissed because the Trustee's claims were currently being litigated in Texas.\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\f                        a.      In his motion, Mateo Cortez stated that he was seeking to administer\n\n                the Estate of Deborah Cortez in Texas, and stated that \"Mr. Cotiez filed an Original\n\n                Petition in intervention that seeks a declaratory judgment regarding the distribution\n\n                of the Trust to Mateo Cortez, the sole heir of the Estate of his late wife, Deborah\n\n                Cortez.\"\n\n\n                       b.      As an exhibit to his motion, Mateo Cortez attached a copy of his\n\n                pleading in Texas, which did not request that the court determine the proper\n\n               beneficiaries of the Trust in the event his declaratory claim failed.\n\n\n               8.      On March 16, 2016, this Court denied Mateo Cortez's motion to dismiss.\n\nOn June 14, 2016, the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia refused Mateo Cortez's petition\n\nfor an extraordinary writ prohibiting this Court from enforcing its order.\n\n\n               9.      On September 15, 2016, this Court granted Defendant Barry's motion for\n\npartial summary judgment, and dismissed Mateo Cortez as a defendant in this case based upon the\n\nfindings, conclusions, and rulings reflected therein.\n\n\n               10.     On December 19, 2016, the Texas court also granted summary judgment\n\nagainst Mateo Cortez on his declaratory claims to the Trust:\n\n\n               On this day, the Court considered the Traditional and No Evidence\n               Motion for Summary Judgment (the \"Motion\") filed by Third Party\n               Defendants ... Connie [Lou] Keith Barry ... all in their individual\n               capacities. Having considered the Motion, the response, all\n               admissible summary judgment evidence, the arguments of counsel,\n               and the other papers on file with the Court, the Court hereby\n               GRANTS the Motion in its entirety.\n\n               It is therefore, ORDERED, that Mateo Cortez's claims against Third\n               Party Defendants in this lawsuit are dismissed in their entirety. In\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\f                    particular, the Court hereby dismisses any and all claims that Mateo\n                    Cortez, in his individual capacity or in his capacity as personal\n                    representative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez, has to any assets of\n                    The William D. Short and Phyllis D. Short Revocable Living Trust\n                    (the \"Trust\"), other than his claim for undistributed income from the\n                    Trust during the life of Deborah Cortez. This judgment has no effect\n                    on Mateo Cortez's breach of fiduciary duty against Linda Murray,\n                    in her capacity as trustee of the Trust.\n\n                    11.      On June 12, 2017, Mateo Cortez filed this Motion, and attached as exhibits\n\nmultiple filings from Texas.\n\n\n                             a.       Mateo Cortez argues that the Texas filings attached to his Motion\n\n                   demonstrate that the Trust is being actively administered in Texas and that the\n\n                   claims pending before this Court are being litigated concurrently in Texas.\n\n\n                             b.       With the exception of Mateo Cortez's intervention pleadings, all of\n\n                   the attached filings from Texas relate to the administration of the Estates of William\n\n                   D. Short and Phyllis D. Short, which are legally distinct from the Trust. The\n\n                   remaining pleadings relate to Mateo Cortez's petition in intervention, which was\n\n                   dismissed by the Texas court on December 19, 2016. 1\n\n\n                            c.        None of the filings attached to Mateo Cortez's Motion seek relief\n\n                   that is the same or similar to the relief sought in this action, to-wit: \"an order\n\n                   directing the distribution of the assets of the Trust to those persons determined by\n\n                   this Court to be entitled to receive the same in such proportions as may be\n\n\n          1\n            Mateo Cortez also attached a pleading entitled Fifth Amended Petition in Intervention and Fourth Amended\nThird Party Petition, which was filed in Texas on May 25, 2017. As with his original intervention pleading, Mateo\nCortez's fifth amended intervention pleading seeks a declaratory judgment that Deborah Cortez was entitled to all of\nthe Trust assets during her life, and an order directing the Trustee to distribute the remaining Trust assets to the Estate\nof Deborah Cortez. Mateo Cortez's fifth amended intervention pleading does not request that the Texas court\ndetermine the proper beneficiaries of the Trust in the event his amended declaratory claim fails.\n\n\n\n                                                            5\n\f                  determined by this Court to be proper and in conformity with the intent of the\n\n                  settlors of the Trust.\" None of the other parties to the Texas action have requested\n\n                  that the Texas court determine the proper beneficiaries of the Trust or the proper\n\n                  distribution of the Trust assets. There is no claim of the Trustee pending in the\n\n                 Texas court that is duplicative of the Trustee's claim in this action.\n\n\n                                         Conclusions of Law\n\n                 12.     \"Every defense, in law or in fact, to a claim for relief in any pleading ...\n\nshall be asserted in the responsive pleading thereto if one is required, except that the following\n\ndefenses may at the option of the pleader be made by motion: (1) lack of jurisdiction over the\n\nsubject matter ... (6) failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted .... A motion making\n\nany of these defenses shall be made before pleading if a further pleading is permitted.\" W.Va. R.\n\nCiv. P. 12(b).\n\n\n                 13.    \"A defense of failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted ...\n\nmay be made in any pleading permitted or ordered under Rule 7(a), or by motion for judgment on\n\nthe pleadings, or at the trial on the merits.\" W.Va.

The principle announced in Princess Lida of Thurn & Taxis does not apply\n\nto suits \"instituted in order to determine the validity of claims against the estate or claimants'\n\ninterests therein. Such proceedings are not in rem; they seek only to establish rights; judgments\n\ntherein do not deal with the property and other distribution; they adjudicate questions which\n\nprecede distribution.\" Commonwealth Trust Co. of Pittsburgh v.

To the extent he\n\nseeks to dismiss this case on any basis other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction, Mateo Cortez's\n\nMotion is procedurally improper and therefore denied. See W.Va. R. Civ. P. 12(h) (defenses other\n\nthan lack of subject matter jurisdiction are waived unless raised prior to judgment). The Court\n\nwill therefore construe Mateo Cortez's Motion as challenging the Court's subject matter\n\njurisdiction.\n\n\n                20.     The Court finds that the principles announced in Berger and Princess Lida\n\nof Thurn & Taxis do not apply to this action and do not deprive this Court of subject matter\n\njurisdiction over the Trustee's claims.\n\n\n                        a.      First, the Trustee's claims in this action are not identical to the\n\n                claims filed in Texas. The Trustee filed this action seeking \"an order directing the\n\n                distribution of the assets of the Trust to those persons determined by this Court to\n\n                be entitled to receive the same in such proportions as may be determined by this\n\n                Court to be proper and in conformity with the intent of the settlors of the Trust.\" In\n\n                contrast, Mateo Cortez filed his intervention claims in Texas to obtain a declaration\n\n                that Deborah Cortez was entitled to all of the Trust assets during her life, and an\n\n                order directing the Trustee to distribute the remaining Trust assets to the Estate of\n\n                Deborah Cortez. Mateo Cortez did not request that the Texas court determine the\n\n                proper beneficiaries of the Trust in the event his declaratory claim failed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\f                         b.      Second, Mateo Cortez's intervention claims in Texas are in\n\n                 personam only, and do not affect this Court's jurisdiction. Mateo Cortez filed his\n\n                 intervention claims in Texas to establish the Estate of Deborah Cortez's \"right to\n\n                 participate in the res or as to [its] quantum of [its] interest in it,\" which falls under\n\n                 the rule set forth in Bradford and not the rule set forth in Princess Lida of Thurn &\n\n                 Taxis. The Texas court appears to be in agreement with this Court's conclusion,\n\n                 given its refusal to enjoin the Trustee from proceeding further with this action.\n\n                 Accordingly, even if the claims before this Court were identical to the claims filed\n\n                 in Texas, concurrent jurisdiction over those claims is proper until a judgment from\n\n                 one court operates as resjudicata in the other.\n\n\n                 21.     Additionally, even assuming that Mateo Cortez's intervention claims in\n\nTexas did implicate Princess Lida of Thurn & Taxis, his claims have been dismissed in their\n\nentirety by the Texas court. None of the other parties to the Texas proceedings have asked the\n\nTexas court to determine how the Trust should be distributed. That claim is only pending here in\n\nWest Virginia, and the Texas court has stated that it won't interfere with this Court's adjudication\n\nof that issue.\n\n\n                                                Ruling\n\n                 For the reasons set forth above, and as stated more fully upon the record, this Court\n\nDENIES the motion to dismiss filed by Mateo Cortez.\n\n\n                 The Court notes that Defendant Connie Lou Keith Barry has filed a motion for\n\nsanctions against Mateo Cortez, in either his personal capacity or in his capacity as the Personal\n\n\n\n\n                                                   9\n\f  '     w\n\n\n\n\n  Representative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez, and his attorneys. The Court's ruling in this Order\n\n  docs not address, moot, or otherwise resolve that motion.\n\n\n                 This Court ORDERS the Clerk to forward certified copies of this Order to all\n\n counsel of record and pro se parties.\n\n\n\n\n                                                         Robert A.

After considering the Motion, the response of\n\n       defendant Connie Barry (\"Response\"), the response of the Trustee, the arguments of counsel, and\n\n       the record, this Court hereby DENIES the Motion for the reasons stated on the record and more\n\n       fully below.\n\n\n                                             Procedural Posture\n\n                      1.      On June 12, 2017 Defendant Mateo Cortez, in his capacity as the Personal\n\n   Representative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez, filed The Estate of Deborah Cortez's Motion to\n\n   Intervene and Memorandum of Law in Support Thereof(the \"Motion\"), requesting that the Court\n\n   pennit the Estate of Deborah Cortez to intervene pursuant to Rule 24 of the West Virginia Rules\n\n   of Civil Procedure.\n\n\n                      2.      Mateo Cortez attached to the Motion u proposed intervenor cumplaiul\n\n  entitled The Estate o.f Deborah Cortez's Complaint Requesting Declarato,y Relief, in which\n\n\n   FILED\nCircuit Court\nDate C?-!tJ:lj\n  CLERK~.\n\f Mateo Cortez, in his capacity as the Personal Representative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez,\n\n seeks a declaratory judgment that all of the assets of the \"William D. Short and Phyllis D. Short\n\n Revocable Living Family Trust Dated April 30, 1991,\" as amended and restated by the \"Second\n\n Amendment and Restatement of The William D. Short and Phyllis D. Short Revocable Living\n\n Trust\" dated January 5, 2000 (collectively, the \"Trust\"), should have been inherited by Deborah\n\nCortez following the death of Phyllis D. Short, as the sole heir and beneficiary of Phyllis's estate.\n\nThe proposed intervenor complaint further requests an order directing that all the assets of the\n\nTrust be distributed to the Estate of Deborah Cortez.\n\n\n               3.      On June 22, 2017, Plaintiff Linda Murray, in her capacity as Successor\n\nTrustee of the Trust (the \"Trustee\"), filed a response in opposition to the Motion. On June 23,\n\n2017, Defendant Connie Lou Keith Barry (\"Barry\"), filed a response in opposition to the Motion\n\nand a request for sanctions. On June 27, 2017, the Court conducted a hearing on the Motion and\n\nother matters. The Court has reviewed the Motion, supporting memorandum and exhibits, the\n\nTrustee and Barry's responses and supporting exhibits, the Trust instrument, and entertained the\n\narguments of the parties. The Court has also reviewed the entire record in this matter as part of\n\nits consideration of this Motion and the other matters pending before it.\n\n\n                            Findings of Fact & Conclusions of Law\n\n               4.     On November 20, 2015, the Trustee filed this action to obtain \"an order\n\ndirecting the distribution of the assets of the Trust to those persons determined by this Court to\n\nbe entitled to receive the same in such proportions as may be determined by this Court to be\n\nproper and in conformity with the intent of the settlors of the Trust.\" (Complaint, p. 22). The\n\nTrustee joined and served Mateo Cortez as a defendant because he \"claims that as the surviving\n\nspouse of Deborah Ann (Short) Cortez he is entitled to the trnst proceeds.\" (Complaint,      ir 13).\n\n                                                2\n\f The docket sheet for this matter indicates that Mateo Cortez was served with process on\n\n December 4, 2015.\n\n\n                   5.       At all times relevant to this action, Mateo Cortez was the sole heir and\n\nbeneficiary of the Estate of Deborah Cortez, and had sole authority to act on its behalf. In both\n\nthis action and the proceedings in Texas, Mateo Cortez's personal counsel also represents him in\n\nhis capacity as the Personal Representative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez.\n\n\n                   6.      On December 28, 2015, Mateo Cortez filed a Rule 12(b) motion to dismiss\n\nthis action pursuant to the doctrine of forum non conveniens, arguing that this action should be\n\ndismissed because the Trustee's claims were currently being litigated in Texas. 1 In his motion,\n\nMateo Cortez stated that he was seeking to administer the Estate of Deborah Cortez in Texas,\n\nand stated that \"Mr. Cortez filed an Original Petition in Intervention that seeks a declaratory\n\njudgment regarding the distribution of the Trust to Mateo Cortez, the sole heir of the Estate of his\n\nlate wife, Deborah Cortez.\" However, Mateo Cortez did not argue that the Estate of Deborah\n\nCortez was a necessary or indispensable party to this action, did not seek to dismiss this action\n\nfor failure to join the Estate of Deborah Cortez as an indispensable party, and did not attempt to\n\njoin the Estate of Deborah Cortez as a party. On March 16, 2016, this Court denied Mateo\n\nCortez's motion to dismiss.\n\n\n                  7.       On April 8, 2016, Mateo Cortez filed his answer in this matter. In his\n\nanswer to paragraph 13 of the Trustee's complaint, Mateo Cortez admitted \"that he is the\n\nsurviving spouse and sole heir of Deborah Ann Cortez and that, as a surviving spouse and sole\n\nheir of Deborah Ann Cortez, that he is entitled to the trust proceeds.\" Mateo Cortez further\n\n\n       1 The   Trustee and Barry dispute Mateo Cortez's characterization of the claims before the Texas court.\n\n\n                                                         3\n\f stated in his answer to paragraph 13 of the Trustee's complaint that the Texas court \"has\n\njurisdiction to declare that the Estate of Deborah Cortez is entitled to all of the assets of the\n\ntrust.\" Mateo Cortez raised as his tenth defense to the Trustee's complaint that \"[t]he Plaintiff\n\nhas failed to join necessary and indispensable parties and thus this Complaint should be\n\ndismissed.\" However, Mateo Cortez did not allege that the Estate of Deborah Cortez was a\n\nnecessary or indispensable party to this action, did not seek to dismiss this action for failure to\n\njoin the Estate of Deborah Cortez as an indispensable party, and did not attempt to join the Estate\n\nof Deborah Cortez as a party.\n\n\n               8.      On April 11, 2016, Defendant Barry filed a motion for partial summary\n\njudgment that Mateo Cortez is not entitled to share in the distribution of any assets of the Trust.\n\nBarry argued that the Trust instrument is unambiguous and that, pursuant to the terms of the\n\nTrust instrument, any remaining assets of the Trust are to be distributed to the heirs at law of\n\nWilliam D. Short and Phyllis D. Short now that Deborah Cortez is deceased.\n\n\n               9.      On May 9, 2016, Mateo Cortez filed a response to Barry's motion for\n\npartial summary judgment. In his response, Mateo Cortez stated that he \"intends to conduct\n\ndiscovery to prove that as a surviving spouse of Deborah Cortez, he is entitled to the trust\n\nproceeds,\" and further argued he \"is entitled to receive trust assets because he is the sole heir of\n\nthe Estate of Deborah Cortez, the Shorts' only child.\" However, Mateo Cortez did not argue that\n\nthe Estate of Deborah Cortez was a necessary or indispensable party to this action, did not seek\n\nto dismiss this action for failure to join the Estate of Deborah Cortez as an indispensable party,\n\nand did not attempt to join the Estate of Deborah Cortez as a party.\n\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\f                   10.      On May 13, 2016, the Court conducted a hearing on Barry's motion for\n\n partial summary judgment and took the matter under advisement.\n\n\n                   11.     On April 29, 2016, Mateo Cortez filed a petition for a writ of prohibition\n\n with the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, seeking to prohibit execution of this\n\n Court's order denying his motion to dismiss. 2 In his petition, Mateo Cortez asserted that\n\n \"[u]nder Texas law, a sole heir may bring an action on behalf of the deceased's estate,\" and\n\n devoted several pages of his brief to discussing actions he had taken in Texas on behalf of the\n\n Estate of Deborah Cortez to adjudicate its interest in the Trust. The petition further asserted that\n\n\"Mateo Cortez, as Representative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez, subsequently filed an Original\n\n Petition in Intervention [in Texas] seeking declaratory judgment on the distribution of the Trust\n\nassets to the Estate of Deborah Cortez,\" and that \"the original Plaintiff/Petitioner in this matter is\n\nthe Estate of Deborah Cortez which filed its Original Petition in Intervention five (5) months\n\nprior to filing the duplicative litigation in West Virginia.\" However, Mateo Cortez did not argue\n\nthat the Estate of Deborah Cortez was a necessary or indispensable party to this action, or that\n\nthis action should be dismissed for failure to join the Estate of Deborah Cortez as an\n\nindispensable party. On June 14, 2016, the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia refused\n\nMateo Cortez's petition.\n\n\n                  12.      On September 15, 2016, this Court granted Defendant Barry's motion for\n\npartial summary judgment, and dismissed Mateo Cortez as a defendant in this case based upon\n\nthe findings, conclusions, and rulings reflected therein.\n\n\n\n\n          2 Per the requirements of the Appellate Rules of Procedure, this Court received a copy of Mateo Cortez's\n\npetition, as reflected on the certificate of service.\n\n\n                                                        5\n\f                13.     At no time prior to this Court's September 15, 2016, order granting\n\n Defendant Barry's motion for partial summary judgment did Mateo Cortez: (1) argue that the\n\n Estate of Deborah Cortez was a necessary or indispensable party to this action; (2) file a motion\n\n to dismiss this action for failure to join the Estate of Deborah Cortez as an indispensable party, or\n\notherwise argue that this action should be dismissed for failure to join the Estate of Deborah\n\nCortez as an indispensable party; or (3) attempt to join the Estate of Deborah Cortez as a party,\n\nor intervene as a party on behalf of the Estate of Deborah Cortez.\n\n\n                14.     On September 29, 2016, Mateo Cortez filed a motion to alter or amend\n\nthis Court's order granting Defendant Barry's motion for partial summary judgment, arguing that\n\nthe Court should vacate its order and dismiss this case with prejudice. Among other grounds for\n\ngranting his motion to alter or amend, Mateo Cortez argued for the first time that the Estate of\n\nDeborah Cortez is an indispensable party to this action.\n\n\n                15.    On December 19, 2016, the Probate Court of Travis County, Texas\n\ngranted summary judgment against Mateo Cortez, dismissing \"any and all claims that Mateo\n\nCortez, in his individual capacity or in his capacity as personal representative of the Estate of\n\nDeborah Cortez, has to any assets of The William D. Short and Phyllis D. Short Revocable\n\nLiving Trust (the 'Trust'), other than his claim for undistributed income from the Trust during\n\nthe life of Deborah Cortez.\" The Texas court subsequently amended its judgment to include\n\nmonetary sanctions against Mateo Cortez's attorneys, finding that the arguments which Mateo\n\nCortez advanced in Texas were frivolous and were not warranted by existing law; the extension,\n\nmodification, or reversal of existing law; or the establishment of new law. The Texas court\n\nsanctioned Mateo Cortez's attorneys in the amount of $65,130.76 for driving up Defendant\n\nBarry's legal fees in Texas with frivolous claims.\n\n\n                                                 6\n\f                                          Conclusions of Law\n\n                  16.     Mateo Cortez, in his capacity as the Personal Representative of the Estate\n\nof Deborah Cortez, seeks to intervene in this action as a matter of right, pursuant to Rule 24( a)(2)\n\nof the West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure. The rule states in pertinent part:\n\n\n                  (a) Intervention of Right. Upon timely application anyone shall be\n                  permitted to intervene in an action . . . (2) when the applicant\n                  claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is\n                  the subject of the action and the applicant is so situated that the\n                  disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or\n                  impede the applicant's ability to protect that interest, unless the\n                  applicant's interest is adequately represented by existing parties.\n\nW.Va. R. Civ. P. 24.\n\n\n                  17.    \"West Virginia Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2) allows intervention of\n\nright in an action if an applicant meets four conditions: (1) the application must be timely; (2) the\n\napplicant must claim an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the\n\naction; (3) disposition of the action may, as a practical matter, impair or impede the applicant's\n\nability to protect that interest; and (4) the applicant must show that the interest will not be\n\nadequately represented by existing parties.\" Syl.

First, the Court finds that the Motion is untimely.\n\n\n                         a.      \"While Rule 24 of the West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure\n\n                  provides for the intervention of parties upon a timely application, the timeliness of\n\n\n\n\n                                                   7\n\fany intervention is a matter of discretion with the trial court.\" Syl. Pt. 3, State ex\n\nrel. Ball v. Cummings, 208 W.Va. 393, 540 S.E.2d 917 (1999).\n\n\n        b.      The Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia has upheld\n\nrefusals to grant intervention where the applicant had actual knowledge of a case\n\nbut failed to move for intervention until after entry of judgment.         See West\n\nVirginia Public Employees Ins. Bd. v. Blue Cross Hosp. Service, Inc., 180 W. Va.\n\n177, 375 S.E.2d 809 (1988) (motion to intervene untimely when filed three\n\nmonths after entry of dismissal order and applicants knew or had reason to know\n\nof the pendency of the action prior to judgment); Pauley v.

It is undisputed that, at all times relevant to this action, Mateo\n\nCortez was the sole heir and beneficiary of the Estate of Deborah Cortez, and had\n\nsole authority to act on its behalf.\n\n\n       d.       It is also undisputed that Mateo Cortez had actual notice of this\n\naction as of December 4, 2015, but did not attempt to intervene on behalf of the\n\nEstate of Deborah Cortez, or argue that the Estate of Deborah Cortez was an\n\nindispensable party to this action, until after this Court granted summary\n\njudgment against him and dismissed him as a defendant.\n\n\n\n\n                                   8\n\f                        e.        It is also undisputed that Mateo Cortez did not actually attempt to\n\n               intervene in this matter on behalf of the Estate of Deborah Cortez until June 12,\n\n               201 7 - nine (9) months after entry of judgment against Mateo Cortez.\n\n\n                                   Second Prong under Rule 24(a)(2)\n                                  Applicant Does Not Have an Interest\n\n               19.      Second, the Court finds that the applicant does not have an interest in the\n\nproperty which is the subject of this action.\n\n\n                        a.       This action seeks to determine the proper distribution of the Trust\n\n               assets which remained after the death of Deborah Cortez. The applicant is Mateo\n\n               Cortez, in his capacity as the Personal Representative of the Estate of Deborah\n\n               Cortez, so the question is whether the Estate of Deborah Cortez has an interest in\n\n               the undistributed assets of the Trust.\n\n\n                        b.       However, as this Court and the Probate Court of Travis County,\n\n               Texas have already ruled, Mateo Cortez and the Estate of Deborah Cortez do not\n\n               have an interest in the assets of the Trust.\n\n\n                       c.        This Court has already ruled that Deborah Cortez's interest in the\n\n               Trust was governed by Article VIII, Section B of the Trust instrument, which\n\n               states that if Deborah \"is living on the date of the death of the second one of us to\n\n               die,\" then \"during Deborah's life\" she was entitled to an annual distribution of\n\n               $25,000.00 of the Trust principal, and a quarterly distribution of the net Trust\n\n              income.        Article VIII, Section C of the Trust instrument sets forth how the\n\n              remaining Trust assets are to be distributed upon Deborah's death, which is one-\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fhalf to the heirs at law of William D. Short and one-half to the heirs at law of\n\nPhyllis D. Short. Accordingly, the Estate of Deborah Cortez has no interest in the\n\nassets of the Trust because the plain and unambiguous language of the Trust\n\ninstrument afforded no interest to Deborah upon her death.\n\n\n        d.     Despite the fact that the Motion is not timely and despite the fact\n\nthe applicant does not have an interest in the subject property, the proposed\n\nintervenor complaint nonetheless alleges that the Estate of Deborah Cortez has an\n\ninterest in the Trust because Article VIII, Section A, Paragraph 2 of the Trust\n\ninstrument invalidated the remaining provisions of Article VIII.        This Court\n\ndisagrees.\n\n\n               1.     Article VIII, Section A sets forth a senes of one-time\n\n       distributions of cash, including a distribution to Deborah Cortez under the\n\n       following condition:\n\n\n       2.      Cash Distribution to Deborah. If our daughter,\n       DEBORAH A. CORTEZ, is living and legally competent,\n       the trustee shall distribute to her the sum of fifty thousand\n       dollars $50,000.00 as soon as practicable after the death of\n       the second one of us to die. If Deborah is not then living or\n       is not legally competent, then this gift shall lapse, and the\n       remainder of the trust estate shall be administered as\n       provided below.\n\n       The applicant alleges that the second sentence of this provision dictates\n\n       that the remainder of the Trust assets are only to be administered under the\n\n       subsequent sections of Article VIII if \"Deborah is not then living or is not\n\n      legally competent.\"     The applicant therefore alleges that \"the Trust is\n\n      ineffective for the disposition of the Trust assets at the time of Phyllis D.\n\n                                10\n\f                        Short's death since Deborah Cortez was alive and competent,\" that the\n\n                       remainder of the Trust therefore lapsed, and that all of the assets of the\n\n                       Trust passed by intestacy through the Estate of Phyllis D. Short to\n\n                       Deborah Cortez as her sole heir.\n\n\n                               11.     The Court, however, rejects this argument as frivolous and\n\n                       contravened by the plain language of the Trust instrument. By its terms,\n\n                       the second sentence of Article VIII, Section A, Paragraph 2 of the Trust\n\n                       instrument pertains solely to whether the cash distribution to Deborah\n\n                       under that paragraph lapses; and does not govern the \"Continuing Trust\n\n                       for Deborah\" established under Article VIII, Section B \"[i]f our daughter,\n\n                       Deborah A. Cortez, is living on the date of the death of the second one of\n\n                       us to die.\" It is undisputed that Deborah was alive when Phyllis D. Short\n\n                       died; the Court must give effect to the intent of the settlors in creating the\n\n                       Trust, and will not read the Trust instrument as \"ineffective for the\n\n                       disposition of the Trust assets\" when the plain language of the Trust does\n\n                       in fact provide for the disposition of the Trust assets.\n\n\n                                Third Prong under Rule 24(a)(2)\n        Disposition of the Action Does Not Impair Applicant's Ability to Protect Interest\n\n               20.     Third, the Court finds that its disposition of this action has not impaired or\n\nimpeded the applicant's ability to protect its interest in the property which is the subject of this\n\naction. This Court and the Texas court have already ruled that Mateo Cortez and the Estate of\n\nDeborah Cortez do not have an interest in the undistributed assets of the Trust. Pursuant to\n\nArticle VIII, Section B of the Trust instrument, Deborah Cortez only possessed a life interest in\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fthe assets of the Trust, and that interest extinguished when she died; and the Trust instrument\n\nmakes no provision for Mateo Cortez at all, despite the fact that the settlors clearly knew that\n\nMateo Cortez and Deborah were married.\n\n\n                               Fourth Prong under Rule 24(a)(2)\n                               Applicant Adequately Represented\n\n              21.     Fourth, the Court finds that the applicant was adequately represented by\n\nMateo Cortez, who is the administrator and sole heir of the Estate of Deborah Cortez.\n\n\n                      a.      As to adequacy of representation by existing parties, \"generally\n\n              courts compare the interests asserted by the proposed intervenor with the interests\n\n              of the existing party. If the proposed intervenor's interest is not represented by\n\n              the existing party, or the existing party's interests are adverse to those of the\n\n              proposed intervenor, intervention should be granted .... [However], if the interests\n\n              are identical, intervention should be denied unless there is a compelling showing\n\n              as to why the existing representation is inadequate.\"           State ex rel. Ball v.\n\n              Cummings, 208 W.Va. 393, 403, 540 S.E.2d 917, 927 (1999) (internal citations\n\n              omitted).\n\n\n                     b.      Mateo Cortez, in both his personal capacity and in his capacity as\n\n              the Personal Representative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez, have identical\n\n              interests in this action: both seek an order directing that all the assets of the Trust\n\n              be distributed to Mateo Cortez, either through direct distribution to Mateo Cortez\n\n              personally or indirectly through distribution to the Estate of Deborah Cortez,\n\n              which then flows through to Mateo Cortez personally as its sole heir.             This\n\n              identity of interest is clear from the undisputed fact that Mateo Cortez controls\n\n\n                                                12\n\f                every decision made on behalf of the Estate of Deborah Cortez, and is the only\n\n                heir and beneficiary of the estate.\n\n\n                       c.      Additionally, Mateo Cortez's attorneys represent him in both his\n\n                individual capacity and in his capacity as the Personal Representative of the\n\n                Estate of Deborah Cortez, which would violate the West Virginia Rules of\n\n                Professional Conduct if their interests were adverse in any way. See W.Va. R.\n\n                Prof. Conduct § 1. 7 (simultaneous representation of adverse parties in litigation is\n\n                a non-waivable conflict of interest).\n\n\n                                               Ruling\n\n                For the reasons set forth above, and as stated more fully upon the record, this\n\nCourt DENIES the Motion to Intervene filed by Mateo Cortez, in his capacity as the Personal\n\nRepresentative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez.\n\n\n               The Court notes that Defendant Connie Lou Keith Barry has filed a motion for\n\nsanctions against Mateo Cortez, in either his personal capacity or in his capacity as the Personal\n\nRepresentative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez, and his attorneys. The Court's ruling in this\n\nOrder does not address, moot, or otherwise resolve that motion.\n\n\n               This Court ORDERS the Clerk to forward certified copies of this Order to all\n\ncounsel of record and pro se parties.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\f PREPARED BY:\n\n\n\n\nAaron C.

Marks\n\nWebb, James Berl Marks, Linda Murray, Thomas Wayne Marks, Donald Leman Whited,\n\nMichael Ray Whited, Terry Lee Whited and Sherry Lynn Whited Salsbury (collectively \"Third\n\nParty Defendants\"). Having considered the Motion, the response thereto, the admissible\n\nevidence, the other papers on file in this matter, and the arguments of counsel, the Court hereby\n\nGRANTS the Motion in part and makes the following findings and orders:\n\n       The Court finds that attorney William J. Brotherton violated Texas Civil Practices and\n\nRemedies Code Chapter 10 in signing the Original Petition in Intervention, the First Amended\n\n                                                1\n                                                                          EXHIBIT\n                                                                              1\n\f Case 2:16-cv-09951 Document 34-1 Filed 02/14/17 Page 2 of 3 PageID #: 2105\n\n                                      No. C-1-PB-16-002348\n\n\nPetition in Intervention and Third Party Petition, Second Amended Petition in Intervention and\n\nThird Party Petition, the Third Amended Petition in Intervention and Third Party Petition, and\n\nthe Fourth Petition in Intervention filed in this matter. In particular, the Court finds that Mr.\n\nBrotherton violated Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code § 10.001 by signing these\n\npleadings because each of them contained the claim that Deborah Cortez was entitled to all\n\nassets from The William D. Short and Phyllis D. Short Revocable Living Trust (the \"Trust\")\n\nupon the death of Phyllis Short because Deborah was over the age of 35 when Ms. Short died.\n\nThe Court finds that the plain language of the Trust foreclosed such a claim and that this claim\n\nwas not warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for the extension, modification,\n\nor reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.\n\n       The Court further finds that attorney William J. Brotherton should have known that as of\n\nSeptember 16, 2016, his legal position regarding postponement of the trust was untenable. By\n\nmaintaining that legal position in his Fourth Petition in Intervention, he caused the Third Party\n\nDefendants to incur additional attorneys' fees in responding to attorney William J. Brotherton' s\n\nclaim regarding postponement of the trust.\n\n       The Court hereby sanctions William J. Brotherton and the Brotherton Law Firm, jointly\n\nand severally, in the amount of $31,150.76 for fees incurred for work done by Brian Thompson\n\nand his associates at Hopper Mikeska, PLLC and $33,980.00 for fees incurred by Aaron Boone\n\nand his associate attorney at Bowles Rice, LLP, for a total of $65,130.76. The Court orders that\n\nthis amount be paid to the Third Party Defendants within 30 days of the entry of this order. The\n\nCourt finds that there is a direct relationship between the sanctions being imposed and Mr.\n\nBrotherton's sanctionable conduct, in that the aforesaid amount represents reasonable and\n\nnecessary attorneys' fees expended by attorneys for the Third Part Defendants to defend against\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f Case 2:16-cv-09951 Document 34-1 Filed 02/14/17 Page 3 of 3 PageID #: 2106\n\n                                     No. C-1-PB-16-002348\n\n\nthe frivolous claims advanced by William J. Brotherton and the Brotherton Law Firm; that the\n\nsanctions are not excessive; and that these sanctions will appropriately deter other attorneys from\n\nsigning pleadings containing claims that violate Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code\n\nChapter 10.\n\n       The Court hereby modifies its judgment entered on December 19, 2016, to include this\n\naward of sanctions.\n\n       Signed this 10th day of February, 2017.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f Case 2:16-cv-09951 Document 34-2 Filed 02/14/17 Page 1 of 2 PageID #: 2107\n\n\n\n\n                                CAUSE NO.

After considering the Motion for Summary Judgment, the response,\n\nall admissible summary judgment evidence, the arguments of counsel, and the other papers on\n\nfile with the Court, the Court GRANTED the_ Motion for Summary Judgment in its entirety and\n\nORDERED, that Mateo Cortez's claims against Third Party Defendants be dismissed in their\n\nentirety. In particular, the Court dismissed any and all claims that Mateo Cortez, in his individual\n                                                 1\n                                                                           EXHIBIT\n                                                                                2\n\f Case 2:16-cv-09951 Document 34-2 Filed 02/14/17 Page 2 of 2 PageID #: 2108\n\n\n\n\ncapacity or in his capacity as personal representative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez, had to any\n\nassets of T he William D.

After considering the Motion to Sever, the response, the arguments of counsel, and the\n\nother papers on file with the Court, the Court GRANTED the Motion to Sever in its entirety and\n\nORDERED that Mateo Corez's claims against Third Party Defendants in this lawsuit be severed\n\nin their entirety and assigned the new cause number C-1-PB-1 6-002348.\n\n        On January 16, 20 17, Third Party Defendants filed their Motion to Modify Judgment to\n\nInclude Sanctions Award (the \" Motion to Modify\"), which extended the plenary power of the\n\nCourt to modify its judgment.

Short\n\n    and Phyllis D. Short Revocable Living Trust dated April 30, 1991 (the ''Trust'~. and to drive up\n\n    the costs of this litigation for the Trust's true beneficiaries. Cortez's motion should be denied. and\n\n    his counsel should be sanctioned for knowingly filing frivolous papers with this Court.\n\n\n                                             INTRODUCTION\n\n                     Cortez was the husband of Deborah Cortez (nee Short), and is her sole heir at law\n\n   and the administrator of her estate. Cortez has been a party to this case since November 10, 2015\n\n   (the date of filing), but made zero effort to join \"the Estate of Deborah Cortez'• as a party, or to\n\n   suggest that it should be made a party, until after this Court granted summary judgment against\n\f, Jun/23/2017 2:09:06 PM                              Bowles Rice 3044205587                                            3/23\n\n\n\n\n      him on September 15, 2016. 1 At all times, Cortez had actual knowledge of this case and sole\n\n     control over \"the Estate of Deborah Cortez\" as its administrator, and was represented by the same\n\n     lawyers who now seek to appear and re~litigate this case on behalf of \"the Estate of Deborah\n\n     Cortez.\" Indeed, both before this Court and the Texas court, Cortez argued prior to judgment that\n\n     the entirety of the Trust belongs to him personally as the sole heir of his late wife. Now, nine\n\n     months after this Court granted summary judgment against him1 and two weeks before the Court\n\n     talces up the Trustee's motion to distribute the Trust to its rightful beneficiaries! Cortez attempts\n\n     to reargue the same baseless claims that this Court and the Texas court both rejected.\n\n\n                        Of course, as this Court ruled in its September 15, 2016 order granting partial\n\n     summary judgment, neither Cortez nor \"the Estate of Deborah Cortez\" have any interest in the\n\n     Trust. By the plain language of the Trust instrument, Deborah Cortez only had an interest in the\n\n     Trust during her life, and that interest extinguished upon her death. The Trust assets now belong\n\n     to the heirs at law of William D. Short and Phyllis D. Short; Cortez and ''the Estate of Deborah\n\n     Cortez\" are not heirs at law of either settlor, and have zero interest in the Trust. Both this Court\n\n     and the Texas court reached this conclusion as a matter of law.\n\n\n                        On December 19, 2016, the Texas court also granted summary judgment against\n\n     Cortez on all of his claims, concluding as a matter of law that Cortez and \"the Estate of Deborah\n\n     Cortez)j have zero interest in the Trust:\n\n\n\n\n              1 Cortez moved to alter or amend the  Court's judgment, arguing in part that the Court failed to join \"the Estate\n     of Deborah Cortez\" as an indispensable party. Cortez failed to raise this defense prior to judgment, and thus waived\n     it. See W.Va. R. Civ. P. l2(h)(2) (stating that defense offailure to join an indispensable party may only be made \"in\n     any pleading permitted or ordered under Rule 7(a), or by motion for judgment on the pleadings, or at the trial on the\n     merits.\"). In any event, Cortez's interests and \"the Estate of Deborah Corte:t's\" interests are identical, so ''the Estate\"\n     was neither necessary nor indispensable to this case.\n\n\n                                                                 2\n\fJun/23/2017 2:09:06 PM                      Bowles Rice 3044205587                            4/23\n\n\n\n\n                   On this day, the Court considered the Traditional and No Evidence\n                   Motion for Summary Judgment (the \"Motion\") filed by Third Party\n                   Defendants . . . Connie [Lou] Keith Barry ... all in their individual\n                   capacities. Having considered the Motion, the response, all\n                   admissible summary judgment evidence, the arguments of counsel,\n                   and the other papers on file with the Court, the Court hereby\n                   GRANTS the Motion in its entirety.\n\n                    It is therefore, ORDERED, that Mateo Cortez's claims against Third\n                    Party Defendants in this lawsuit are dismissed in their entirety. In\n                    particular, tlie Court liereby dismisses any and all claims that\n                   Mateo Cortez, in Ids indlvidugl cqpacitv or in his cgpacitv as\n                   l!,,r,rsonal representative ofthe Estate o[.Deborali Cortez. has to any\n                    assets of The William D.

This\n                   judgment has no effect on Mateo Cortez's breach of fiduciary duty\n                   against Linda Murray, in her capacity as trustee of the Trust.\n\n   Exhibit A, Order Granting Third Party Defendants' Traditional and No Evidence Motion for\n\n   Summary Judgment, Civil Action No. C-l·OB~14~1564 (Tex. Probate Ct. Dec. 19, 2016)\n\n   (emphasis added). The Texas court subsequently amended its judgment to include sanctions\n\n   against Cortez's lawyers, finding that Cortez's argument that \"the Estate of Deborah Cortez', was\n\n   entitled to the assets of the Trust was frivolous:\n\n\n                  The Court finds that attorney William J. Brotherton violated Texas\n                  Civil Practices and Remedies Code Chapter 10 in signing the\n                  Original Petition in Intervention [and subsequent pleadingsJ filed in\n                  this matter. In particular, the Court finds that Mr. Brotherton\n                  violated Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code§ 10.001 by\n                  signing these pleadings because eac/1 of them contained the claim\n                  that Debora/, Cortez was entitled to all assets from [the Trust).\n                  1hr Court finds that the plain language of tlie Trmt fQredg$_ed\n                  such a claim and that this claim was not warranted by existing law\n                  or by a non-frivolous argument for the extension, modification, or\n                  reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.\n\n                  The Court further finds that William J. Brotherton should have\n                  known that as of September 16, 2016, his legal position regarding\n                  postponement of the trust was untenable ....\n\n\n\n\n                                                        3\n\f, Jun/23/2017 2:09:06 PM                     Bowles Rice 3044205587                                   5/23\n\n\n\n\n     Exhihit B, Order on Third Parr; Defendants' Motion to Modify Judgment to Include Sanctions\n\n     Award, Civil Action No. C~l~OB-14-1564 (Tex. Probate Ct. Feb, 10, 2017) (emphasis added).\n     The Texas court sanctioned Cortez's lawyers in the amount of $65,130.76 for driving up Mrs.\n\n     Barrf s legal fees in Texas with his frivolous claims.\n\n\n                    Although Cortez seeks to \"intervene\" on behalf' 1ofthe Estate of Deborah Cortez,\"\n\n     in reality he seeks to hide behind a nominal party to avoid this Court's judgment, and to reargue\n\n     in West Virginia the same ridiculous and insupportable legal theories that led to sanctions against\n\n     his lawyers in Texas. The Court should deny Cortez's motion (and all of his other frivolous claims\n\n     for relief), and sanction his counsel for wasting the Court's time and the parties' resources.\n\n                                                 ARGUMENT\n\n     A.      CORTEZ'S ATTEMPT TO i 41NTERVENE ON BEHALF OF THE ESTATE OF\n             DEBORAH CORTEZ\" SHOULD BE DENIED.\n\n                    Cortez's motion to intervene is frivolous and should be denied. Rule 24 of the West\n\n     Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure states:\n\n\n                    (a) Intervention of Right. Upon timely application anyone shall be\n                    permitted to intervene in an action: (1) when a statute of this State\n                    confers an unconditional right to intervene; or (2) when the applicant\n                    claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the\n                    subject of the action and the applicant is so situated that the\n                    disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede\n                    the applicant's ability to protect that interest, unless the applicant's\n                    interest is adequately represented by existing parties.\n\n     W.Va. R. Civ. P. 24. \"West Virginia Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2) allows intervention of right\n\n     in an action if an applicant meets four conditions: (1) the application must be timely; (2) the\n\n     applicant must claim an interest relating to the property or transaction whlch is the subject of the\n\n     action; (3) disposition of the action may. as a practical matter. impair or impede the applicant's\n\n\n                                                       4\n\fJun/23/2017 2:09:06 PM                     Bowles Rice 3044205587                                  6/23\n\n\n\n\n    ability to protect that interest; and (4) the applicant must show that the interest will not be\n\n    adequately represented by existing parties.\" Syl.

For obvious reasons, Cortez cannot meet a single one of these criteria.\n\n\n                   First, Cortez's motion is untimely. \"While Rule 24 of the West Virginia Rules of\n\n    Civil Procedure provides for the intervention of parties upon a timely application, the timeliness\n\n   of any intervention is a matter of discretion with the trial court.\" Syl.

Cortez had actual notice of this suit in 2015,\n\n   and knew or should have known at that time that he needed to \"intervene on behalf of the Estate\n\n   of Deborah Cortez\" if he or his lawyers believed \"the Estate\" had an interest in this litigation.\n\n   Instead, Cortez fought this case on other grounds, and specifically argued that he was personally\n\n   entitled to the proceeds from the Trust. Cortez did not move to \"intervene on behalf of the Estate\"\n\n   until nine months after this Court rejected his claim to the Trust and granted summary judgment\n\n   against him. The Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia has upheld refusals to grant\n\n   intervention where the movant had knowledge of a case but failed to move for intervention until\n\n   after entry ofjudgment.

This Court should similarly deny Cortez's\n\n   motion as untimely.\n\n\n                  Next, \"the Estate of Debot'ah Cortez\" has absolutely no interest in the Trust. Under\n\n   the second and third pro11gs of Rule 24(a)(2), the movant must demonstrate both \"an interest\n\n\n                                                     5\n\fJun/23/2017 2:09:06 PM                      Bowles Rice 3044205587                                  7/23\n\n\n\n\n    relating to the property ... which is the subject of the action\" and that disposition of the action may\n\n    \"impair or impede the applicanf s ability to protect that intel'est.\" W.Va. R. Civ. P. 24. Mrs. Barry\n\n    will not belabor points which have already been established by this Court and the Texas court as a\n                    0\n    matter of law. The Estate of Deborah Cortez\" has no interest in the Trust because the plain and\n\n    unambiguous language of the Trust instrument affords no interest to Deborah Cortez upon her\n\n   death. Deborah Cortez only possessed a life interest in the Trust income, which extinguished when\n\n   she died. The disposition of this action will not impair the ability of\"the Estate of Deborah Cortez\"\n\n   to protect its interest in the Trust because \"the Estate of Deborah Cortez\" has no interest to protect.\n\n   This Court has already ruled on that issue and need not revisit it.\n\n\n                   Finally, \"the Estate of Deborah Cortez\" was adequately represented in this litigation\n\n   by Cortez himself, who is the administi·ator and sole heir of the estate. As to adequacy of\n\n   representation by existing parties, \"generally courts compare the interests asserted by the proposed\n\n   intervenor with the interests of the existing party. If the proposed intervenor's interest is not\n\n   represented by the existing party, or the existing party's interests are adverse to those of the\n\n   proposed intervenor, intervention should be granted.... [However], if the interests are identical,\n\n   intervention should be denied unless there is a compelling showing as to why the existing\n\n   representation is inadequate.\" State ex rel. Ball v.

Cortez and \"the Estate of Deborah Cortez\" have\n\n   identical interests in the Trust (zero) and identical interests in this litigation: they both seek to\n\n   obtain the entirety of the Trust proceeds, either through direct distribution to Cortez personally or\n\n   through distribution to ''the Estate of Deborah Cortez,\" which would then flow through to Cortez\n\n   personally as its sole heir. Cortez and \"the Estate's\" ider1tity of interest is clear from the simple\n\n   fact that Cortez controls every decision made by \"the Estate of Deborah Cortez,\" and is the only\n\n\n\n                                                      6\n\fJun/23/2017 2:09:06 PM                       Bowles Rice 3044205587                              8/23\n\n\n\n\n    person that benefits from \"the Estate.\" Indeeds Cortez and \"the Estate of Deborah Cortez,, 9!!\n\n    represented by the same ler,al counsel in this case, which would violate the West Virginia Rules\n\n    of Professional Conduct if their interests were adverse in any way. See W.Va. R. Prof. Conduct\n\n    § 1.7 (simultaneous representation of adverse parties in litigation is a non.waivable conflict of\n\n    interest). \"The Estate of Deborah Cortez\" cannot deny that Cortez himself, as the administrator\n\n    and sole heir, had every opportunity to represent its claimed interest in this litigation.\n\n\n   B.      THE COURT SHOULD SANCTION CORTEZ'S COUNSEL FOR ATTEMPTING\n           TO OBSTRUCT THIS CASE WITH FRIVOLOUS FILINGS.\n\n                   Although Cortez ostensibly seeks to protect the interests of \"the Estate of Deborah\n\n   Cortez/' both this Court and the Texas court have already rejected Cortez's claim that the Trust\n\n   should have terminated, passed to Deborah Cmtez, and ultimately inherited by Cortez personally\n\n   as the sole beneficiary of \"the Estate of Deborah Cortez.\" Exhibit A. In fact, the Texas court\n\n   futther found in February of2017 that Cortez's claim was frivolous and sanctionable. Exliibit B.\n\n                   The truth is that Cortez only filed his most recent round of West Virginia motions\n\n   to obstruct or delay the Court's upcoming hearing on the Trustee's motion for summary judgment.\n\n   Cortez's filings are clearly frivolous, and his attorneys should be sanctioned in West Virginia for\n\n   the same reasons they were sanctioned in Texas. HThere is authority in equity to award to the\n\n   prevailing litigant his or her reasonable attorney's fees as 'costs/ without express statutory\n\n   authorization, when the losing party has acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly or for oppressive\n\n   reasons.''

The Court's ruling on the Trustee's motion will determine as a matter of law the finaJ\n\n\n            2 Due to the fact that Cortez filed his motions within two weeks of the Court's hearing, Mrs. Barry is unable\n   to provide the required twenty-one (21) day notice to file a Rule 11 sanctions motion in her own capacity before the\n   Court's hearing. However, the Court may still take up the issue of sanctio11s .sua sponte under Rule l l(c)(l)(B), and\n   always hqs equitable authority to sanction bad faith conduct mtder Sally-Mike Properties. Mrs. Barry fully intends to\n   seek recovery of all her attorneys' fees and costs in this action as a result of Cortez's frivolous and vexatious conduct,\n   which inc]udes not only filing frivolous claims to the Trust proceeds, but also improvidently removing the case to\n   federal court to create additional delay, and filing additional frivolous motions to prevent the Court from reaching the\n   merits of the Trustee's summary judgment motion.\n\n\n                                                               8\n\fJun/23/2017 2:09:06 PM                     Bowles Rice 3044205587                              10/23\n\n\n\n\n    distribution of the Trust to its rightful beneficiaries. The true purpose of Cortez's motion is\n\n    obvious: Cortez hopes to delay or obstruct the Court's disposition of the Trustee's summary\n\n   judgment motion by arguing that the Court must first rule on his new filings.\n\n\n                   Indeed, Cortez's lawyers made no effort to conceal the improper purpose of his\n\n   filings. By letter dated June 15, 2017, Cortez's counsel specifically requested that the Trustee\n\n   reschedule the upcoming hearing on her summary judgment motion in light of Cortez's new\n\n   filings:\n\n\n                  I called your office yesterday to confer regarding whether or not you\n                  and your clients wished to consider scheduling our motion to\n                  intervene and motion to dismiss for the 27th and reschedule the\n                  motion for summary judgment after the court has ruled on our\n                  motions. That would appear to be the best process for judicial\n                  economy.\n\n   Exltlbit C, Letter dated June 15, 2017 from William J. Brotherton to Robert S. Fluharty, Jr. This\n\n   Court and the Texas court have already rejected Cortez's position. His remedy under the law is to\n\n   take an appeal of those decisions. Instead, Cortez continues to present frivolous filings, with the\n\n   stated purpose of delaying this Court's consideration of the Trustee's summary judgment motion.\n\n   Cortez's conduct smacks of bad faith, and the Court has inherent equitable authority under Sally-\n\n   Mike Properties, and sua sponte authority under Rule ll(c)(l)(B), to sanction Cortez and his\n\n   lawyers for their wrongful conduct. Accordingly, Mrs. Bany requests that the Court award Mrs.\n\n   Barry and the Trustee all of their attorneys' fees and costs incurred in this action as a sanction\n\n   against Cortez and his lawyers for their conduct in obstructing this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    9\n\fJun/23/2017 2:09:06 PM   Bowles Rice 3044205587                               11/23\n\n\n\n\n                                      .._/4. .Q . b\n                                      Aaron C.

Brotherton violated Texas Civil Practices and\n\n       Remedies Code Chapter 10 in signing the Original Petition in Intervention, the First Amended\n\n                                                         1         EXHIBIT\n                                                                        B\n\fJun/23/2017 2:09:06 PM                       Bowles Rice 3044205587                              15/23\n\n\n\n\n                                             No, C-1-PB-16-002348\n\n       Petition in Intervention and Third Party Petition, Second Amended Petition in Intervention and\n\n       Third Party Petition, the Third Amended Petition in Intervention and Third Party Petition, and\n\n       the Fourth Petition in Intervention filed in this matter. In particular, the Court finds that Mr.\n\n       Brotherton violated Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code § I 0.001 by signing these\n\n       pleadings because each of them contained the claim that Deborah Cortez was entitled to all\n\n       assets from The William D. Short and Phyllis D. Short Revocable Living Trost (the \"Trost\")\n\n       upon the death of Phyllis Short because Deborah was over the age of 35 when Ms. Short died.\n\n       The Court finds that the plain language of the Trust foreclosed such a claim and that this claim\n\n       was not warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for the extension, modification,\n\n       or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.\n\n              The Court further fmds that attorney William J. Brotherton should have known that as of\n\n       September 16, 2016, his legal position regarding postponement of the trust was untenable. By\n\n       maintaining that legal position in his Fourth Petition in Intervention, he caused the Third Party\n\n       Defendants to incur additional attorneys' fees in responding to attorney William J. Brotherton's\n\n       claim regarding postponement of the trust.\n\n              The Court hereby sanctions William J. Brotherton and the Brotherton Law Firm, jointly\n\n      and severally, in the amount of $31,150.76 for fees incutted for work done by Brian Thompson\n\n       and his associates at Hopper Mikeska, PLLC and $33,980.00 for fees incurred by Aaron Boone\n\n      and his associate attorney at Bowles Rice, LLP, for a total of $65,130.76.

Although presented\n                                                         11\n   as a motion to dismiss \"for lack of jurisdiction'' or failure to state a claim,\" Cortez has simply\n\n   repackaged the same forum non conveniens arguments that this Court and the Supreme Court of\n\n   Appeals of West Virginia rejected last year. Indeed, the Texas court has specifically stated that it\n\n   would not interfere with this Court•s jurisdiction: \"THE COURT: I'm not going to prohibit them\n\n   from proceeding, I'm not going to order them to dismiss in West Virginia. You all can go to\n\n   West Virginia and argue.\" First, Cortez lacks standing to assert a Rule 12(b) Motion to Dismiss\n\n   because judgment has already been entered against him. Second, notwithstanding his lack of\n\n   standing, Cortez's motion is based on the false premise that Texas is now administering the\n\fJun/23/2017 2:54:24 PM                     Bowles Rice 3044205587                                3/20\n\n\n\n\n    Trust. Lastly, given that the instant motion is frivolous, and filed solely to delay this Honorable\n\n    Court's efforts, sanctions should be assessed against Cortez's counsel.\n\n\n                                             ARGUMENT\n\n   A.      CORTEZ'S MOTION SHOULD BE DENIED BECAUSE POST-JUDGMENT\n           MOTIONS TO ABSTAJN ARE NOT PERMITTED BY THE RULES OF CIV1L\n           PROCEDURE.\n\n                  On September 15, 2016, this Court entered judgment against Cortez, dismissing\n\n   any and all claims that Cortez has to the Trust. Order Granting Motion for Partial Summary\n\n   Judgment, Wirt County Civil Action No. 15-C-28 (September 15, 2016). As discussed below,\n\n   Cortez's motion to dismiss seeks to re-litigate his argument that this Court should decline\n\n   jurisdiction in deference to parallel proceedi11gs in Tex.as. Cortez, however, has no legal right to\n\n   ask this court to abstain post~judgment. W.Va. R. Civ. P. 12(h) (defenses other than lack of\n\n   subject matter jurisdiction are waived unless raised prior to judgment).       Moreover, Cortez's\n\n   arguments are not only untenable, they are based on false and intentionally misleading premises.\n\n\n   B.     CORTEZ'S MOTION SHOULD BE DENIED BECAUSE THE TEXAS COURT IS\n          NOT ACTIVELY ADMINISTERING THE TRUST.\n\n                  Cortez bases his motion on the Princess Lida doctrine, which is not a\n\n   jurisdictional doctrine, but rather an abstention doctrine based on 75-year old dicta.

El-Shamari, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769248\"><a href=\"/opinion/769248/kawther-al-abood-individually-and-on-behalf-of-her-minor-son-mahmoud/\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">225</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 2000) (citing cases holding that\n\n   the Princess Lida doctrine is based on abstention and not lack of jurisdiction).

Like forum non conveniens, abstention doctrines are not mandatory\n\n   jurisdictional limitations on a court; they are discretionary doctrines; grounded in equitable\n\n   concerns regarding comity between courts of concurrent jurisdiction.         See Quackenbush v.\n\n\n                                                    2\n\fJun/23/2017 2:54:24 PM                             Bowles Rice 3044205587                                          4/20\n\n\n\n\n   Allstate Ins. Co., S17 U.S. 706, 722 (1996) (abstention and forum non conveniens doctrines\n\n   proceed from the same premise that in rare circumstances, courts can relinquish their jurisdiction\n\n   in favor of another forum).\n\n\n                       The premise of Cortez's instant motion, and the premise of Cortez's earlier and\n\n   unsuccessful forum non conveniens motion, are identical. Cortez argues that a Texas court is\n\n   exercising concurrent jurisdiction over the parties• dispute, therefore this West Virginia Court\n\n   should \"step aside''. Cortez filed a \"Petition in Intervention\" in Texas on behalf of \"the Estate of\n\n   Deborah Cortez,\" in which he sought a declaratory judgment regarding the distribution of the\n\n   Trust assets. 1 Cortez, however, intentionally omitted from his motion to dismiss that: (1) no\n\n   other party asked the Texas court to decide how the Trust should be distributed or to assume\n\n   control over the Trusti and, more importantly, (2) the Texas court dismissed all of Cortez's\n\n   claims in their entirety.       The fact that no party other than Cortez asked the Texas court to\n\n   administer the Trust is critical because, on December 19, 2016, the Texas court granted summary\n\n   judgment against Cortez on all of the claims alleged in his \"Petition in Intervention,\" concluding\n\n   as a matter of law that Co1tez and 0 the Estate of Deborah Cortez\" have zero interest in the Trust:\n\n\n                       On this day, the Court considered the Traditional and No Evidence\n                       Motion for Summary Judgment (the ''Motion'•) filed by Third\n                       Party Defendants ... Connie [Lou) Keith Ban·y ... all in their\n                       individual capacities. Having considered the Motion, the response,\n                       all admissible summary judgment evidence, the arguments of\n                       counsel, and the other papers on file with the Court, the Court\n                       hereby GRANTS the Motion in its entirety.\n\n                       It is therefore, ORDERED, that Mateo Cortez's claims against\n                       Third Party Defendants in this lawsuit are dismissed in their\n                       entirety. In particular, the C9urt herebJ?, dismisses any and all\n\n           1 Corte2: filed his \"Petition in Intervention° to establish a defense against the Trustee's tort claims against\n  him for stealing from the Trust. Cortez has since pointed to his \"Petition in Intervention\" a.s the reason for why this\n  case should be dismissed and litigated in Texas.\n\n\n                                                             3\n\fJun/23/2017 2:54:24 PM                   Bowles Rice 3044205587                              5/20\n\n\n\n\n                  claims tl,at Mateo Corte;, in liis indi}!idual cagqcitv or in Ms\n                  capacity as personal representative of the Estate o( Debora/,\n                  Cortez, has to any assets of The William D. Short and Phyllis D.\n                  Short Revocable Living Trust (the \"Trust,'), other than his claim\n                  for undistributed income from the Trust during the life of Deborah\n                  Cortez. This judgment has no effect on Mateo Cortez's breach of\n                  fiduciary duty against Linda Murray, in her capacity as trustee of\n                  the Trust.\n\n   Exhibit A, Order Granting Third Party Defendants' Traditional and No Evidence Motion for\n\n   Summary Judgment, Civil Action No. C-1-0B-14-1564 (Tex. Probate Ct. Dec. 191 2016).\n\n\n                  Mol'eover, the Texas court subsequently amended its judgment to include\n\n   sanctions against Cortez's lawyers, finding that Cortez's claims were :frivolous and were not\n\n   warranted by existing law; the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law; or the\n\n   establishment of new law. Exhibit B, Order on Third Party Defendants' Motion to Modify\n\n   Judgment to Include Sanctions Awardi Civil Action No. C-1-0B-14-1564 (Tex. Probate Ct. Feb.\n\n   10, 2017). Pertinent to this motion, the Texas court found that sanctions were appropriate\n\n   because \"attorney William J. Brotherton should have known that as of September 16, 2016, his\n\n   legal position regarding postponement of the trust was untenable.\" Exhibit B. The date\n\n   referenced in the Texas court's sanction order is the day after this Cburt granted summary\n\n   judgment against Cortez, which proves that the Texas court agrees that the Trustee's claims\n\n   were properly brought in West Virginia. Otherwise, the Texas court obviously would not have\n\n   deferred to the findings in this Court's September 15~ 2016 order granting summary judgment.\n\n\n                  In sum, Cortez claims that the Princess Ltda doctrine applies and deprives this\n\n   Court of jurisdiction. Again, there is no claim before a Texas court to administer the Trust.\n\n   Even if Cortez's \"Petition in Intervention\" did implicate the Princess Lida doctrine, his claims\n\n   have been dismissed in their entirety, which undel' Texas law is final for collateral estoppel\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fJun/23/2017 2:54:24 PM                               Bowles Rice 3044205587                                            6/20\n\n\n\n\n    purposes irrespective of his right to appeal. See Scurlock Oil Co. v. Smithwick, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2434042\"><a href=\"/opinion/2434042/scurlock-oil-co-v-smithwick/\"><span class=\"volume\">724</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n    (Tex. 1986) (judgment is final for purposes of issue and claim preclusion despite taking of\n\n    appeal). 2 Although Cortez claims that the Texas court has taken a number of steps to administer\n\n   the Trust, none of his claims are true. Neither the Trustee, nor any of the rightful beneficiaries of\n\n   the Trust, have asked the Texas court to detennine how the Trust should be distributed. That\n\n   claim is only pending here in West Virginia, and the Texas court has stated that it won't inte1fere\n\n   with this Court's adjudication of the issues before it: \"THE COURT: I'm not going to prohibit\n\n   them from proceeding, I'm not going to order them to dismiss in West Virginia. You all can go\n\n   to West Virginia and argue.\"                Exhibit C, Transcript Excerpt, Application for Temporary\n\n   Restraining Order and Injunctive Relief, at p. 25, Civil Action No. C-1-OB-14-1564 (Tex.\n\n   Probate Ct. Dec. 18, 2015). Accordingly, the Court should reject Cortez's arguments, and reject\n\n   his attempt to further delay and obstruct the Trustee's efforts to distribute the Trust to its rightful\n\n   beneficiaries.\n\n\n   C.       CORTEZ AND HIS LAWYERS SHouio BE SANCTIONED FOR FILING\n            FRIVOLOUS PAPERS TO OBSTRUCT OR DELAY THIS CASE.\n\n                      For the same reasons stated in Defendant Connie Lou Keith Barry's Response in\n\n   Opposition to Motion to Intervene and Request for Sanctions, Cortez and his lawyers should be\n\n   sanctioned for the filing of their Motion to Dismiss, which is frivolous and filed for the sole\n\n   purpose of delaying further action in this Court.\n\n                      DATED this 23ro day of June 2017.\n\n\n            2 The  Texas court's order granting summary judgment against Cortez meets the remaining elements of\n   collateral estoppel. The elements of collateral estoppel are that: \"(1) the facts sought to be litigated in the first action\n   were fully and fairly Jitigated in the prior action; (2) those facts were essential to the judgment in the first action; and\n   (3) the parties were cast as adversaries in the first action.\" Eagle Properties, Ltd v.

In particular) the Court finds that Mr.\n\n          Brotherton violated Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code § 10.001 by signing these\n\n          pleadings because each of them contained the claim that Doborah Cortez was entitled to all\n\n          assets ftom The William D. Short and Phyllis D. Short Revc,cable Living Trust {the 0 Trust\")\n\n          upon the death of Phyllis Short because Deborah was over the age of 35 when Ms. Short died.\n\n          The Court finds that the plain language of the Trust foreclosed such a claim and that this claim\n\n          was not warranted by existing law or by a non•mvolous argument for the extension, modification,\n\n          or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.\n\n                 The Court further finds that attomoy William J. Brotherton should have known that as of\n\n         September 16, 2016, his legal position regarding postponement of the trust was untenable. By\n\n         maintaining that legal position in his Fourth Petition in Intervention, he caused the Third Party\n\n         Defendants to incur additional attorneys' fees in responding to attorney William J. Brotherton's\n\n         claim regarding postponement of the trust.\n\n                 The Court hereby sanctions William J. Brotherton and the Brotherton Law Firm, jointly\n\n         and severally, in the amount of $31,150.76 for fees incurred for work done by Brian Thompson\n\n         and his associates at Hopper Mikeska, PLLC and $33,980.00 for fees incurred by Aaron Boone\n\n         and his associate attorney at Bowles Rice, LLP, for a total of $65,130.76.

Rule 24(a)(2) provides:\n\n              (a) Intervention of Right- Upon timely application anyone shall\n              be permitted to intervene in an action: (2) when the applicant claims\n              an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject\n              of the action and the applicant is so situated that the adjudication of\n              the action may as a practicable matter impair or impede the\n              applicant's ability to protect that interest, unless the applicant's\n              interest is adequately represented by existing parties.\n\n              The timeliness of an application to intervene is a matter of discretion with the trial\n\ncourt.

The court enumerated the criteria for\n               reviewing a trial judge's discretionary decision to deny motion to\n               intervene. Three areas were considered by the court: whether the\n               underlying action had progressed to a point that intervention would\n               substantially affect the parties to the original action; whether\n               unusual circumstances exist which establish that the interest the\n               movant alleges was inadequately protected; and whether the movant\n               knew or should have known of the pendency of the action.\"\n               NAACP, 413 U.S. at 366-69, 93 S.Ct. at 2602-04, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108847\"><a href=\"/opinion/108847/naacp-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

In the original Complaint filed in this action, Mateo Cortez,\n\nnow the Personal Representative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez, was named as an individual\n\ndefendant. Paragraph 13 of the Complaint stated:\n\n               \"13. Mateo Cortez, the surviving spouse of Deborah Ann (Short)\n               Cortez, claims that as the surviving spouse of Deborah Ann (Short)\n               Cortez he is entitled to the Trust proceeds. His claim is without\n               legal merit, nevertheless, in order that he may appear and protect his\n               interest, if any, he is named as a defendant herein.\"\n\n               Mateo Cortez was not named as a defendant in his capacity as Personal\n\nRepresentative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez in the Complaint for the reason that at the time\n\nfiling of the Complaint there was no on-going administration of the Estate of Deborah Cortez.\n\nOver three and one-half years prior to the filing of the Complaint, on February 21, 2012, two and\n\none-half months after the death of Deborah Cortez, the movant, Mateo Cortez filed a Small Estate\n\nAffidavit in the Probate Court of Travis County, Texas. A copy of the Affidavit is attached\n\nhereto, marked as Exhibit A and made part hereof. In his Affidavit, Mateo Cortez swore that the\n\n\n                                                    3\n\ftotal value of all known assets of the decedent, as of the date of her death, not including the\n\nhomestead and exempt property, does not exceed $50,000.00. The Affidavit stated that there was\n\nno petition for appointment of a personal representative pending, nor had one been granted.\n\n               In the civil action sub judice, the defendant Mateo Cortez has repeatedly claimed\n\nthat: (I) he was married to Deborah Cortez; (2) Deborah Cortez died intestate and without issue;\n\nand (3) he is the sole heir at law of Deborah Cortez. Mateo Cortez is the individual who had a\n\nright to open the estate of Deborah Cortez, V. T. C.A., Estate Code §304.00 I. He failed to do that\n\nwith the result that he was the only person who could be served with the legal process intended to\n\nnotify the heirs of Deborah Cortez of this litigation. The interests of Mr. Cortez are identical to\n\nthe interest of\"the estate of Deborah Cortez\". Mr. Cortez should not be heard to complain about\n\nwhat he caused by willfully misrepresenting to the Texas Probate Court the extent of the assets of\n\nDeborah Cortez.\n\n               The movant has been aware of the pendency of this action since its initial filing.\n\nMateo Cortez did not become appointed as the Personal Representative of the Estate of Deborah\n\nCortez until well after the filing of the Complaint. The movant has no justification, other than\n\nmalicious interference, for the delay in filing the Motion to Intervene as the Personal\n\nRepresentative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez.\n\n\n                                            III.\n                The Estate of Deborah Cortez has no interest in the Property\n                               which is subiect of this action.\n\n              The Estate of Deborah Cortez has no interest in the property which is the subject of\n\nthis action. This has been specifically found by the Travis County Probate Court. In a parallel\n\ncase filed in the State of Texas, styled Mateo Cortez, as Representative of the Estate of Deborah\n\n                                                  4\n\f Cortez, Plaintiff, vs. Sandra Fleshman Brown, et al., Travis County Probate Court No. l, Cause\n\nNo. C-l-PB-16-002348, Judge Guy Hannon on February 10, 2017, entered an Amended Final\n\nJudgment ordering that the claim of Mateo Cortez as Personal Representative of the Estate of\n\nDeborah Cortez be dismissed in its entirety. The Judgment Order states in pertinent part:\n\n               \"In particular, the court dismissed any and all claims that Mateo\n               Cortez, in his individual capacity or in his capacity as personal\n               representative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez, (emphasis added)\n               had to any assets of the William D. Short and Phyllis D. Short\n               Revocable Living Trust (the Trust), other than his claim for\n               undistributed income from the Trust during the life of Deborah\n               Cortez.\"\n\n               In its Amended and Final Judgment, the Texas Probate Court imposed sanctions\n\nupon the attorney for Mateo Cortez, William J. Brotherton and the Brotherton Law Firm, jointly\n\nand severally, in the amountof$65,130.76. The defendants in the Texas litigation had previously\n\nfiled a Motion to Modify Judgment to include the sanctions award. The Court in its Order\n\ngranting the Motion found that William J. Brotherton violated Texas Civil Procedure Remedies\n\nCode Chapter 10 in signing the original Petition in Intervention, the First Amended Petition in\n\nIntervention and the Third Party Petition, Second Amended Petition in Intervention and the Third\n\nParty Petition, the Third Amended Petition in Intervention and the Third Party Petition and the\n\nFourth Petition in Intervention filed in this matter. In particular, the Court found that \"Mr.\n\nBrotherton violated Texas Civil Procedure and Practices Remedies Code § l 0.001 by signing these\n\npleadings because each of them contained the claim that Deborah Cortez was entitled to all the\n\nassets from the William D. Short and Phyllis D. Short Revocable Living Trust (the Trust) upon the\n\ndeath of Phyllis Short because Deborah was over the age of 35 when Ms. Short died. The court\n\nfinds that the plain language of the Trust foreclose such claim and that this claim does not warrant\n\n\n                                                 5\n\f by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversing of\n\n existing law or the establishment of new law.\" Copies of the Amended Final Judgment entered in\n\nthe Travis County Probate Court litigation on February I0, 2017, and the Order on Third Party\n\nDefendant's Motion to Modify Judgment and Include Sanction Award dated February 10, 2017,\n\nare attached hereto, marked as Exhibits A and B, and made part hereof.\n\n\n\n                                              IV.\n                 The Movant's interest in the proceeding bas been adequately\n                    represented by the original defendant, Mateo Cortez.\n\n                Mateo Cortez was originally named as a defendant in this proceeding and has\n\nheretofore been dismissed from this action by this Court. By Order entered by this Court on\n\nSeptember 15, 2016, the Court found that \"Mateo Cortez is not a beneficiary of the Trust and is not\n\nentitled to share in the distribution of Trust assets.\"\n\n                The Movant's claimed interest in the property set out in his Motion to Intervene is\n\nidentical to the claim made by Mateo Cortez in his individual capacity. Mateo Cortez is the sole\n\nbeneficiary of the Estate of Deborah Cortez. The claim now being advanced by Mateo Cortez in\n\nhis capacity as the Personal Representative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez is identical in all\n\nrespects to the claim made by Mateo Cortez in his individual capacity. With both claims, Mateo\n\nCortez is ultimately seeking an Order from the Court that he is entitled to distribution of all the\n\nassets of the Short Trust The Court has already fully considered his claim as to Mateo Cortez in\n\nhis individual capacity and found it to be without any merit whatsoever and dismissed Mateo\n\nCortez as a party to this action. Now, Mateo Cortez, wearing a different hat, is simply attempting\n\nto re~litigate his dismissal. The Motion is frivolous and is filed in violation of Rule 11 of the West\n\n\n                                                   6\n\fVirginia Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n\n                                                    V.\n                  Intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication\n                       of the rights of the remaining parties to this action.\n\n                The controversy giving rise to this proceeding has been the subject of extensive\n\nlitigation in this Court, the Travis County Probate Court in the State of Texas, the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, and the West Virginia Supreme Court of\n\nAppeals at considerable time and expense to the parties. All aspects of this case have been\n\nreviewed in detail by the various Courts. In each instance of court review, the Movant has been\n\nrendered an adverse ruling. The Motion before the Court is simply another effort by the Movant,\n\nMateo Cortez, and his sanctioned counsel, William J. Brotherton, to delay the ultimate conclusion\n\nof this case, all to the prejudice of the real parties in interest.\n\n\n\n                                                  VI.\n                                               Conclusion\n\n                For all the above-stated reasons, Linda Murray, in her Capacity as Successor\n\nTrustee of the William D.

INTRODUCTION\n\n               Mateo Cortez, for years, never claimed that he or the Estate of Deborah Cortez\n\nwere the sole beneficiaries to the Trust. However, as soon as Mateo Cortez and his counsel\n\ndiscovered that the Trust contained 5.2 Million in assets, they immediately concocted meritless\n\narguments to suggest that he was the sole beneficiary to the Trust Assets. This forced Mrs. Barry\n\nto hire counsel to refute these claims. However, even after winning judgment against Mateo\n\nCortez on September 15, 2016, Mrs. Barry had to expend tens of thousands of additional dollars\n\nin litigation costs solely to respond to further, frivolous filings that were submitted solely to:\n\f (a) delay this Court's consideration of the Trustee's motion for summary judgment, and (b) to\n\n drive up Mrs. Barry's litigation costs and deplete the Trust Assets. Accordingly, this Court\n\n should sanction Mateo Cortez and his counsel, and order them, jointly and severally, to pay any\n\n and all costs incurred on behalf of Mrs. Barry, at a minimum, since September 15, 2016.\n\n\n                                II.    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n                1.      \"There is authority in equity to award to the prevailing litigant his or her\n\n reasonable attorney's fees as 'costs,' without express statutory authorization, when the losing\n\nparty has acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly or for oppressive reasons.\" Syl.

Initially, the court must identify the alleged wrongful conduct and\n\ndetermine if it warrants a sanction. The court must explain its reasons clearly on the record if it\n\ndecides a sanction is appropriate. To determine what will constitute an appropriate sanction, the\n\ncourt may consider the seriousness of the conduct, the impact the conduct had in the case and in\n\nthe administration of justice, any mitigating circumstances, and whether the conduct was an\n\nisolated occurrence or was a pattern of wrongdoing throughout the case.\" Sy!.

At the conclusion of such\n\nhearing, the trial court must make sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law to enable the\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f appellate court to conduct a meaningful review.\" Sy!.

On December 9, 2011, Deborah Cortez, the sole daughter of William D.\n\nShort and Phyllis D. Short died.\n\n\n                   6.

In his Amended Answer, Mateo\n\n Cortez did not claim that he or the Estate of Deborah Cortez was entitled to the entirety of the\n\n Trust Assets. 1\n\n\n                   10.     On June 19, 2015, counsel for Mateo Cortez deposed the Trustee. During\n\nthis deposition, the Trustee revealed, for the first time to Mateo Cortez and his counsel, that the\n\nTrust contained approximately 5.2 Million in assets.\n\n\n                   11.     On June 26, 2015, Mateo Cortez and his counsel (the Law Firm of\n\nWilliam Brotherton) filed their Original Petition in Intervention 2, arguing (for the first time,\n\never) that Mateo Cortez and/or the Estate of Deborah Cortez were the sole beneficiaries to the\n\nTrust and were, therefore, entitled to the entirety of the Trust Assets.\n\n\n\n\n         1 Of note, \"Mateo Cortez's Original Answer\" and \".Mateo Cortez's First Amended Answer\" were signed by\n\nAttorney John Clark Long IV of Dallas, Texas (Texas State Bar No. 12520500). The signature line for these two\npleadings suggests that Mr. Long was not directly affiliated with the Brotherton Law Firm at this time because Mr.\nLong had a mailing address separate from the Brotherton Law Finn, and because Mr. Long's email address was\njohn@johnlonglawyer.com. However. when Mateo Cortez flied his \"Original Petition in Intervention,\" Mr. Long\nwas directly affiliated with the Brotheron Law Finn because Mr. Long's name appeared directly underneath William\nBrotherton's name, because Mr. Long no longer had a separate mailing address, and because Mr. Long's email\naddress was john@brothertonlawfrrm.com.\n        2\n          Mrs. Bany believes that most, if not all, of the pleadings referenced herein have previously been\nsubmitted to this Court. As such, unless otherwise indicated, they will not be attached as exhibits to this Motion.\nNotwithstanding, Mrs. Barry submits all prior pleadings in further support of her Motion for Sanctions as though\nthey were specifically attached hereto.\n\n\n\n                                                        4\n\f                 12.     On November 20, 2015, the Trustee filed her Complaint in the Circuit\n\n Court of Wirt County, West Virginia, asking this Honorable Court to determine who were the\n\n rightful beneficiaries to the Trust.\n\n\n                 13.     On September 15, 2016, this Court granted Mrs. Barry's motion for partial\n\n sununary judgment, and dismissed Mateo Cortez as a defendant in this case based upon the\n\n findings, conclusions, and rulings reflected therein. Among other findings, the Court concluded\n\nthat the plain and unambiguous language of the Trust instrument provides that: (i) the net\n\nincome of the Trust would be paid to Mr. and Mrs. Short during their lives; (ii) upon Mr. and\n\nMrs. Short's death, the net income of the Trust would then be paid to their daughter, Deborah\n\nCortez, during her life; and then, (iii) upon Deborah's death, any remaining Trust assets would\n\nbe distributed to the \"heirs of law\" of Mr. and Mrs. Short, and not to Cortez. The Court also\n\nrejected Mateo Cortez's arguments that the Trust should have terminated upon the death of Mrs.\n\nShort and its assets distributed to Deborah during her life; and as a result the Trust assets should\n\nbe treated as an asset of Deborah's estate, of which Cortez is the sole heir and beneficiary.\n\n\n             Statement oftlie improper purposes underlvi11g Mateo Cortez's actions\n\n                14.     Following this Court's entry of summary judgment against him on\n\nSeptember 15, 2016, Mateo Cortez, in both his personal capacity and his capacity as the Personal\n\nRepresentative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez (collectively, \"Mateo Cortez\"), filed numerous\n\nadditional pleadings that are improper under the rules of procedure, that assert obviously\n\nfrivolous claims, and that were filed to obstruct further progression of this case and to drive up\n\nthe parties' litigation costs. These pleadings were filed for the following improper purposes:\n\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\f                             a.       The primary improper purpose of Mateo Cortez's frivolous post-\n\n          judgment filings was to delay this Court's consideration of the Trustee's motion for\n\n          summary judgment, filed September 21, 2016, the resolution of which would trigger the\n\n          parties' \"Rule 11 Agreement\" in Texas. (Exlzibit D - Rule 11 Agreement, Cause No. C-\n\n          l-PB-14-1564, Probate Court of Travis County, Texas) The \"Rule 11 Agreement\" was\n\n          executed by counsel for Mateo Cortez and the Trustee, and permits the Trustee to\n\n          distribute assets of the Trust \"as may be permitted by a final order by a court of\n\n          competent jurisdiction.\" Point being, once Judge Waters ruled on the Trustee's motion\n\n          for summary judgment, then the Trustee could distribute the Trust assets per the Rule 11\n\n          Agreement.\n\n\n                            b.       The secondary improper purposes of Mateo Cortez's frivolous\n\n         post-judgment filings were: (a) to drive up the litigation costs incurred by the Trustee\n\n         and the true beneficiaries of the Trust; (b) to deplete the Trust assets available for\n\n         distribution; and (c) to retaliate against individual beneficiaries (such as Mrs. Barry) for\n\n         asserting their rightful interests in the Trust.\n\n\n      Frivolous pleadings filed after Mrs. Barry obtained judgment against Mateo Cortez3\n\n                  15.      Mateo Cortez submitted the following frivolous filings after this Court\n\ngranted judgment against him:\n\n\n\n\n         :J To be clear, Mrs. Barry contends that, from the outset of litigation in West Virginia, Mateo Cortez and his\ncounsel have proffered meritless arguments not founded in Jaw or fact. As such. this Court has every right, under\nSally Mike Properties, to order Mateo Cortez and his counsel to pay all of Mrs. Barry's legal fees. However, this\nMotion for Sanctions will focus on why the pleadings filed after Mrs. Barry obtained judgment against Mateo\nCortez are particularly egregious.\n\n\n                                                          6\n\f                a.      Motion to Amend or Alter: On September 29, 2016, Mateo Cortez\n\n filed a motion to alter or amend the Court's summary judgment order against him.\n\n Although the motion was procedurally proper, the grounds for relief were frivolous and\n\n simply sought to rehash the Court's rulings under baseless alternate legal theories.\n\n\n                b.      Notice of Removal, Motion to Dismiss: On October 21, 2016,\n\n Mateo Cortez filed a notice of removal of this case to the United States District Court for\n\n the Southern District of West Virginia, despite the fact that he was no longer a party to\n\nthe case, there was no basis for invoking federal jurisdiction, and the time for removal\n\nhad expired nearly a year earlier. Mateo Cortez filed for removal two (2) days after the\n\nTrustee noticed her summary judgment motion for a hearing, and did so to prevent the\n\nCourt from holding that hearing and to delay the Court's disposition of his motion to alter\n\nor amend. Additionally, upon removing the case, Mateo Cortez attempted to collaterally\n\nattack this Court's rulings by filing a successive, post-judgment motion to dismiss in\n\nfederal court. On April JO, 2017, the Federal Court rejected Mateo Cortez's argument,\n\nand remanded this matter back to the Circuit Court of Wirt County, West Virginia.\n\n\n               c.      Motion to Dismiss & Motion to Intervene: On June 12, 2017,\n\nMateo Cortez filed (1) a second post-judgment motion to dismiss \"in his personal\n\ncapacity,\" and (2) a motion to intervene \"in his capacity as personal representative of the\n\nEstate of Deborah Cortez,\" along with a proposed intervenor complaint seeking to re-\n\nargue his entitlement to the Trust under yet another baseless legal theory. By letter to\n\ncounsel dated June 15, 2017, (Exhibit E - Brotherton June I 5, 2017 letter) counsel for\n\nMateo Cortez conceded that the intent of these two motions was to delay this Court's\n\nresolution of the Trustee's motion for summary judgment:\n\n\n                                         7\n\f                (Mr. Brotherton):       I called your office yesterday to confer\n                regarding whether or not you and your clients wished to consider\n                scheduling our motion to intervene and motion to dismiss for the\n                27th and reschedule the motion for summary judgment after the\n                court has ruled on our motions. That would appear to be the best\n                process for judicial economy.\n\n        E.xhibitE.\n\n          Notice to Mateo Cortez and his counsel that their conduct was sanctionable\n\n                I 6.   As mentioned below, counsel for Mateo Cortez has, on occasion, argued\n\nthat he should not be sanctioned because he was never given notice that his conduct was\n\nsanctionable. See infra. Accordingly, to demonstrate the efforts to avoid seeking the requested\n\nsanction in West Virginia, the following chronicles the various filings, letters, statements, and/or\n\nrulings placing Mateo Cortez and his counsel on notice that his claims have no merit and/or that\n\ncontinued litigation of his claims is oppressive, vexatious, and sanctionable:\n\n\n                       a.     September 15, 2016: In this Court's Order granting Mrs. Barry's\n\n       motion for partial summary judgment, this Court made clear that neither Mateo Cortez,\n\n       nor the Estate of Deborah Cortez, are entitled to take under the Trust.\n\n\n                       b.     November 7, 2016: In her November 7, 2016, Motion to Remand\n\n       and Award of Attorneys Fees and Costs, Mrs. Barry made clear that Mateo Cortez\n\n       removed this case to Federal Court solely to delay the proper administration of the Trust:\n\n\n               Additionally, Defendant Cortez did not seek to remove this case\n               until after the state court ruled that he is NOT entitled to a\n               distribution from the Trust. Therefore, it is clear from the timing\n               of this Notice of Removal that the purpose of removing to federal\n               court was solely to obstruct the progression of the state court case,\n               and to delay his obligation to appeal that court's judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\f          (See Document 8, Memorandum in support of Mrs. Barry's Motion to Remand, p. 2, not\n          auached4)\n\n                            c.      November 11, 2016:            In her November 11, 2016, Motion to\n\n          Remand and Award Attorney Fees and Costs, the Trustee made clear that Mateo Cortez\n\n          removed this case to Federal Court solely to delay the proper administration of the Trust:\n\n\n                  In the case at bar there is no reason, other than delay or\n                  obstruction, for Cortez to have waited until October 21, 2016, to\n                  seek to remove this proceeding from the state court to federal\n                  court.\n\n         (See Document 14, Memorandum in support of Plaintiffs Motion to Remand, p. 14, not\n         attached)\n\n                           d.       December 19, 2016: On December 19, 2016, the Texas court also\n\n         granted summary judgment against Mateo Cortez, dismissing \"any and all claims that\n\n         Mateo Cortez, in his individual capacity or in his capacity as personal representative of\n\n         the Estate of Deborah Cortez, has to any assets of The William D. Short and Phyllis D.\n\n         Short Revocable Living Trust (the 'Trust'), other than his claim for undistributed income\n\n         from the Trust during the life of Deborah Cortez.\" (See, Order Granting Third Party\n\n         Defendants' Traditional and No Evidence Motion for Summary Judgment, Cause No. C-\n\n         l-PB-14-1564, Probate Court of Travis County, Texas, Dec. 19, 2016, not attached).\n\n\n                          e.       January 30, 2017: During a sanctions hearing before the Probate\n\n         Court of Travis County, Texas, counsel for Mateo Cortez argued, incredulously, that they\n\n         were never informed that their arguments qualified as bad faith:\n\n\n\n         4\n           Mrs. Barry believes the pleadings in Federal Court have been transmitted to the Circuit Clerk and the\nCourt can consider the same as if they were attached hereto. Should the Court need courtesy copies of any pleading,\nFederal or other, please contact the office of Mrs. Barry's counsel.\n\n\n                                                         9\n\f                   (Mr. Ruback) If counsel believed that my client was making bad\n                   faith arguments from the initial filing in the case, from each\n                   hearing that this Court has heard in the case, why didn't counsel\n                   bring that to my client's attention? Why didn't counsel bring that\n                   to the Court's attention? Laches would bar the arguments they're\n                   making today.

I 55).\n\n          However, during this hearing, the undersigned made clear that counsel for Mateo Cortez\n\n          knew or should have known as early as February of 2016 that Mateo Cortez's claims\n\n          were sanctionable:\n\n\n                   (Mr. Ruback) Q: Mr. Boone, when did you first advise my clients\n                   that you believe their conduct was sanctionable?\n\n                   (Mr. Boone) A: I think when we had a hearing - I think it was\n                   back in February or March [of2016] there was a room full of heirs\n                   at law in West Virginia, and there was Judge Waters, there was\n                   myself, there was several other attorneys. And I - I believe the\n                   discussion about the claims raised by Mateo Cortez, the discussion\n                   how they were without any merit at all should have given notice to\n                   the Brotherton Law Firm that these claims should not have been\n                   continued.\n\n                   (Exhibit F, p. I 09)\n\n                           f.       February 10, 2017:           On February IO, 2017, the Texas court\n\n         awarded sanctions against Cortez's lawyers, finding that arguments advanced by Cortez\n\n         in Texas were frivolous.         (Exhibit G - Order on Third Party Defendants' Motion to\n\n         Modify Judgment to Include Sanctions Award, Cause No. C-I-PB-16-2348, Probate\n\n         Court of Travis County, Texas). The Texas court sanctioned Cortez's lawyers in the\n\n         amount of $65,130.76 for driving up Mrs. Barry's legal fees in Texas with frivolous\n\n         claims.\n\n         5 The entire transcript is attached as an exhibit to this Motion. Mrs. Bany asks thjs Court to take judicial\n\nnotice of this transcript, and to accept and consider same in support of this Motion.\n\n\n                                                         10\n\f                    g.    February 23, 2017: On February 23, 2017, the undersigned sent a\n\n letter to William J. Brotherton, with carbon copy to James W. Marshall, III, H. F.\n\n Salsbery, and Andrew R. Herrick of the law finn of Bailey and Wyant, demanding \"that\n\n Mateo Cortez and/or the Estate of Deborah Cortez immediately withdraw any and all\n\n claims to the Trust Assets,\" and explaining that if counsel for Mateo Cortez failed to\n\n immediately withdraw their claims to the Trust Assets, then the undersigned \"will take\n\n appropriate action to:     (a) seek additional sanctions against your firm and (b) seek\n\n sanctions against Mr. Mateo Cortez personally.\" (Exhibit H - Boone February 23, 2017\n\nletter) On March 1, 2017, William Brotherton rejected the undersigned's February 23,\n\n2017, demand, suggesting that the orders from Judge Waters and Judge Hennan are\n\n\"riddled with <>rrors and inaccuracies.\" (Exhibit I-Brotherton March I, 2017 letter).\n\n\n               h.        April 11, 2017:    On April 11, 2017, the United States District\n\nCourt for the Southern District of West Virginia remanded this matter back to the Circuit\n\nCourt of Wirt County, West Virginia, thereby rejecting the arguments proffered by Mateo\n\nCortez to justify removal. (See Document 36, Memorandum Opinion and Order, not\n\nattached)\n\n\n               i.        May 10, 2017: On May 10, 2017, the parties conducted mediation\n\nin Houston Texas. The matter did not resolve.\n\n\n              j.         June 26, 2017: By letter dated June 26, 2017, the undersigned\n\nagain warned Mateo Cortez's attorneys that their litigation tactics were frivolous and\n\ntaken in bad faith, and further warned that Mrs. Barry would seek sanctions against them\n\nif they refused to cease their obstruction of this case. (Exhibit J - Boone June 26, 2017\n\n\n\n                                           II\n\f         letter)        Mateo Cortez and his attorneys have nonetheless refused to withdraw their\n\n         frivolous claims.\n\n\n                                          IV.    ARGUMENT\n\n                   To recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs as a sanction, the prevailing\n\n litigant must show that the losing party \"acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly or for\n\n oppressive reasons.\" See Sy!.

Mateo Cortez And His Attorneys Began Their Vicious Assault On The\n                            Rightful Heirs Only After Discovering That The Trust Contained Over\n                            Five Million Dollars In Assets.\n\n                   From the outset, it is important to review the facts and circumstances surrounding\n\nthe genesis of Mateo Cortez's frivolous arguments. In 2012, Mateo Cortez filed a Small Estate\n\nAffidavit, for the Estate of Deborah Cortez, confirming that the Estate had less than $50,000.\n\n(Exhibit A). In 2014, when Mateo Cortez responded to allegations that he misappropriated\n\ncertain Trust Assets, he never claimed that he or the Estate of Deborah Cortez were the sole\n\nbeneficiaries to the Trust. In fact, Mateo Cortez and his counsel did not discover the sizeable\n\nnature of the Trust until the deposition of the Trustee on June 19, 2015.\n\n\n\n                                                   12\n\f                    During a hearing before the Probate Court, the Trustee testified regarding her\n\n experience during this June 19, 2015, deposition. 6 The Trustee testified that, during her\n\n deposition, it became clear Mateo Cortez and his counsel did not know the amount of the Trust\n\n prior to this deposition and that, upon learning the amount of the Trust, Mateo Cortez and his\n\n counsel became instantly enamored of the sizeable nature of the Trust.\n\n\n                   Q. (By Mr. Boone) Who was -- who was taking the deposition?\n\n                   A. Brotherton.\n\n                   Q. The Brotherton Law Firm? Someone from the Brotherton Law\n                   Firm?\n\n                   A. Yes, it was.\n\n                   Q. And Mateo Cortez was there?\n                   A. Yes.\n\n                  Q. All right.\n                  A. He was with them.\n\n                  Q. Okay. So when they asked you how much was in the trust did\n                  you know the answer?\n\n                  A. Yes, I did.\n\n                  Q. And did you tell them the answer?\n\n                  A. Yes, I did.\n\n                  Q. What was your answer?\n                  A. 5.2 million dollars.\n\n                  Q. What if any reaction did yon observe at that time?\n\n         6\n          As noted above, on February JO, 2017 1 the Honorable Guy Herman, Judge of the Probate Court of Travis\nCounty, Texas, sanctioned William Brotherton and the Brotherton Law Firm for filing frivolous claims, and ordered\nthem to pay $65,130.76 within 30 days to Mrs. Bany. In advance of this sanctions award, Judge Herman conducted\nan evidentiary hearing on January 30, 2017. At this evidentiary hearing, the Trustee testified regarding her efforts in\nTexas to recoup monies that were misappropriated by Mateo Cortez, including her experience sitting for her\ndeposition on June 19, 2015.\n\n\n\n                                                          1</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span>\n\f                 <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">You could see eyes rolling.\n\n                 Q.Howso?\n\n                 A. Just so you could -- you could just see that they knew there\n                 was a lot of money. And then shortly after we had a break.\n\n                 Q. Shortly after that question there was a break?\n\n                A. Yes.\n\n                Q. And what do you mean by \"a break?\"\n\n                A. 15 minute break.\n\n                Q. Counsel left and --\n\n                A. Counsel left, we -- yes.\n\n                Q. And do you recall if there were many questions after the break\n                concluded?\n\n                A. No, there wasn't.\n\n                Q. And that deposition occurred on June 19th, 2015, correct?\n\n                A. That is correct.\n\n                Q. Now, did Mateo through his counsel make any claims after that\n                deposition that were new and different? Did they file any papers\n                or pleadings or anything after that deposition?\n\n               A. Oh, yes. They filed -- they filed saying that that money\n               belonged to Mateo Cortez and all -- and it was all of it. He -- Matt\n               said all of the money belonged to him.\n\n(Exhibit F, pp. 85-86)( emphasis added).\n\n\n               As such, in light of Mateo Cortez's filings in 2012 and 2014, and in light of the\n\nJune 19, 2015, deposition, it is clear that Mateo Cortez had no any idea regarding the sizeable\n\nnature of the Trust. In fact, it wasn't until seven (7) days after the June 19, 2015, deposition, did\n\nMateo Cortez first allege that he and/or the Estate of Deborah Cortez were entitled to the entirety\n\nof the Trust Assets; on that date, June 26, 2015, William Brotherton filed Mateo Cortez's\n\n\n\n                                                  14\n\f \"Original Petition in Intervention,\" claiming that Mateo Cortez is the sole heir to the Trust\n\n Assets.\n\n\n               Point being, it was only after learning that the Trust Assets contained 5.2 Million\n\ndid Mateo Cortez and his Legal Team begin to embark with their \"no holds bar\" quest to strip the\n\nrightful beneficiaries of their rights to the Trust Assets. Without question, the timing of their\n\nactions reveal that Mateo Cortez and his counsel have been motivated solely by greed, and not\n\nby any legitimate claim to the Trust Assets.\n\n\n               2.     Mateo Cortez And His Attorneys Filed Their Claims Without Any\n                      Justification In Fact Or Law.\n\n               The inability of Mateo Cortez's counsel to articulate any reasonable justification\n\nfor claiming Mateo Cortez is sole heir to the Trust Assets further demonstrates the seriousness of\n\nthe misconduct. At the January 30, 2017, hearing before the Probate Court, Texas Counsel for\n\nthe heirs-at-Jaw, Brian Thompson, examined Mr. Brotherton under oath, and asked Mr.\n\nBrotherton to explain why Mateo Cortez is entitled to take under the \"Postponement Section\" of\n\nthe Trust. (Exhibit F, pp. 37 - 48). As the record demonstrates, Mr. Brotherton could not\n\nsufficiently explain the basis for his claim. First, Mr. Brotherton rationalized his inability to\n\nfully explain the basis for Iris initial pleading with being preoccupied by a matter in North\n\nDakota.\n\n\n              Q. (Mr. Thompson) Okay. It seems to me that most of the claims\n              that you brought -- or all of the claims that you brought on behalf\n              of your client were based on Texas Jaw as it exists now. You\n              weren't saying that law should change, were you?\n\n              A. (Mr. Brotherton) Again -- and I've got to say over the last six\n              months I've spent most of my time in North Dakota so I haven't\n              been involved in this case in a little while. So you may want to\n              talk with Mr. Hester about some of those technical issues.\n\n\n                                               15\n\f (Exhibit F, p. 20).\n\n\n                Further, when pressed for a simple explanation as to why the Estate of Deborah\n\n Cortez is entitled to take under the Postponement Provision (Section D), Mr. Brotherton could\n\nnot provide an explanation:\n\n\n                Q. And again, back to my original question, is there any other\n                language in that D portion, the postponement of possession\n                portion, that you believe supports this postponement provision\n                claim?\n\n               A. You're talking about in the trust?\n\n               Q. Well, sir, the claim cites in every single one of the pleadings\n               that we looked at, the claim cites Article 8 Section D to support\n               this claim. And I'm asking you, can you point out what language\n               you believe in Article 8, Section D supports this claim? And that's\n               on Page 5 of the trust.\n\n               A. Well, I mean, whatever we put in our pleadings is -- is --\n               addresses that. I'm not going to sit here and try and explain it all\n               to you at this point because certainly we've outlined in our\n               pleadings, we've consulted with necessary experts and we believe\n               every claim we've made is colorable.\n\n               Q. Was Mr. Kelsey going to testify in this case if it had reached\n               trial as an expert?\n\n               A. I hadn't made that decision yet.\n\n               Q. He certainly was never designated as an expert, was he?\n\n               A. Correct.\n\n(Exhibit F, pp. 40-41).\n\n\n               In sum, Mr. Brotherton could not justify his argument that Mateo Cortez, pursuant\n\nto the Postponement provision, was entitled to the Trust Assets. As such, Judge Herman agreed\n\nthat Mr. Brotherton's conduct was sanctionable, and ordered Mr. Brotherton to pay $65,130.76\n\nto Mrs. Barry for her legal fees in Texas. (To date, Mr. Brotherton refuses to pay this sanctions\n\n\n                                                16\n\f award.) Mr. Brotheron testified that the arguments proffered in Texas were \"virtually identical\"\n\n to the arguments proffered in West Virginia. (Exhibit F, p. 42). As such, just as Judge Herman\n\n awarded sanctions against the Brotherton Law Firm for fees and costs expended by Mrs. Barry in\n\n Texas, so should this Honorable Court similarly award sanctions for fees and costs expended by\n\n Mrs. Barry in West Virginia.\n\n\n               3.     Mateo Cortez And His Attorneys Deliberately Filed Frivolous Pleadings\n                      With The Improper Purpose Of Obstructing The Progression Of This Case\n                      And Driving Up The Parties' Litigation Costs.\n\n               Each time the Trustee would notice her motion for summary judgment for a\n\nhearing, Mateo Cortez would initiate a new filing to delay this Court's consideration of the\n\nTrustee's motion. First, when the Trustee filed a notice on September 21, 2016, setting her\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment for hearing on November 3, 2016, Mateo Cortez removed this\n\ncase to Federal Court on October 21, 2016. Later (after remand), when the Trustee again filed a\n\nnotice on April 20, 2017, setting her motion for hearing on June 27, 2017, counsel for Mateo\n\nCortez filed a Motion to Dismiss and Motion to Intervene. Incredulously, a letter from William\n\nBrotherton confirms that the sole intent of these two motions was to delay consideration of\n\nTrustee's motion for summary judgment.\n\n\n              I called your office yesterday to confer regarding whether or not\n              you and your clients wished to consider scheduling our motion to\n              intervene and motion to dismiss for the 27th and reschedule the\n              motion for summary judgment after the court has ruled on our\n              motions. That would appear to be the best process for judicial\n              economy.\n\nExhibitE\n\n\n              The reason why Mateo Cortez has repeatedly attempted to derail consideration of\n\nthe Trustee's Motion for Summary Judgment is because once the Court grants the Trustee's\n\n\n                                              17\n\f motion for summary judgment, then the assets may be distributed. Pursuant to a Rule 11\n\n Agreement executed by counsel for Mateo Cortez and counsel for Trustee, the Trustee may\n\n distribute assets of the Trust \"as may be pennitted by a final order by a court of competent\n\njurisdiction.\" Exhibit D. Mateo Cortez has attempted to obstruct the proceedings in this Court\n\nprecisely because the declaratory relief requested by the Trustee (i.e., \"an order directing the\n\ndistribution of the assets of the Trust to those persons determined by this Court to be entitled to\n\nreceive the same\") would trigger the Rule 11 Agreement.\n\n\n               Additionally, Mateo Cortez has also filed these pleadings to drive up the costs of\n\nthis litigation, in a plan to deplete the Trust assets and to cause financial hann to the individual\n\nTrust beneficiaries. In West Virginia alone, the rightful beneficiaries of the Trust have been\n\nforced to defend against multiple motions, an extraordinary writ petition, and an improvident\n\npost-judgment case removal, to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees and nearly\n\ntwo years of delay. Each of Mateo Cortez's litigation tactics have been rejected by the court(s)\n\nthat have considered them, yet the Trustee and the true beneficiaries of the Trust have\n\nnonetheless suffered real financial hann in defending against them.\n\n\n       B.      The Conduct of Mateo Cortez and His Counsel has Impacted the Financial,\n               Physical and Emotional Wellbeing of the Parties.\n\n               I.     Mrs. Barry Has Expended Over Tens of Thousand Dollars Fighting\n                      Meritless Litigation.\n\n               The impact of Mateo Cortez's misconduct was the abuse of the legal system\n\nthrough the attempted prosecution of a series of baseless claims:\n\n\n               Although there is an undeniable interest in the maintenance of\n               unrestricted access to the judicial system, unfounded claims or\n               defenses asserted for vexatious, wanton, or oppressive purposes\n\n\n                                                18\n\f                place an unconscionable burden upon precious judicial resources\n                already stretched to their limits in an increasingly litigious society.\n                In reality to the extent that these claims or defenses increase delay\n                or divert attention from valid claims or defenses asserted in good\n                faith, they serve to deny the very access to the judicial system they\n                would claim as justification for their immunity from sanction.\n\nDaily Gazette Co. v. Canady, 175 W.Va. 249,252,332 S.E.2d 262,265 (1985). Mateo Cortez's\n\n misconduct also had a profound impact on Mrs. Barry, who has incurred tens of thousands of\n\ndollars in legal fees defending against baseless claims that never should have been pursued.\n\n\n                2.      The Trustee Has Suffered Emotionally And Physically.\n\n                During the January 30, 2017, hearing, the Trustee testified that the frivolous\n\nlitigation has adversely affected the Trustee's relationship with her family, and adversely\n\nimpacted her emotional and physical health.\n\n\n                Firstly, the litigation has adversely affected the Trustee's relationship with her\n\nfamily. Once Mateo Cortez argued that he was entitled to the entirety of the Trust Assets, the\n\nTrustee was forced to institute proceedings in West Virginia to detem1ine the rightful heirs.\n\nOnce the Trustee filed the Complaint in West Virginia, and served notice to her family members,\n\nher family members became unhappy with her. (Exhibit F, pp. 91-92). The Trustee testified\n\nthat the ongoing litigation has caused a strain with her sister and brother. (Exliibit F, pp. 91-92).\n\n\n               Secondly, the litigation has adversely affected the Trustee's physical and\n\nemotional health. The litigation has caused the Trustee to gain significant weight (Exhibit F, p.\n\n95) and has required her to take anti-anxiety medication (Exhibit F, p. 95).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 19\n\f                In sum, the conduct of Mateo Cortez and his counsel, in prosecuting his baseless\n\n claim, has adversely impacted the emotional and physical well-being of the Trustee, Linda\n\n Murray.\n\n\n        C.     There are No Mitigating Circumstances to Excuse the Misconduct\n\n               There are no mitigating circumstances that can justify Mateo Cortez's\n\nmisconduct. Every court to consider Mateo Cortez's claims to the Trust has rejected them.\n\nMoreover, on February 10, 2017, the Texas court sanctioned Mateo Cortez for the amount of\n\nMrs. Barry's accrued attorneys' fees and costs in Texas, finding that his claims in Texas (and\n\nwhich he has sought to litigate here) were frivolous and were not warranted by existing law; by\n\nthe extension, modification, or reversal of existing law; or by the establishment of new law.\n\nDespite one court already finding his litigation tactics frivolous as a matter of law, Mateo Cortez\n\nhas continued to pursue those claims in this Court.\n\n\n       D.      The Conduct of Mateo Cortez and His Counsel has Permeated the Entirety of\n               Litigation.\n\n               Mateo Cortez's misconduct was not an isolated occurrence, but has been a\n\nrepeated pattern of misconduct not only before this Court but also in the litigation in Texas.\n\nMateo Cortez has repeatedly attempted to distort the status of this case and the Texas case, the\n\nplain language of the Trust instrument, and the laws applicable to the Trust. He has abused the\n\nrules of procedure in West Virginia and in Texas in an effort to either convince a court to agree\n\nwith his distorted and frivolous view of the Tmst instrument, or to obstruct the lawful\n\nadministration of the Trust. As a result, the Trustee, Mrs. Barry, and others have expended an\n\nincredible amount of time, effort, and money in defending the plain language of the Tmst (and\n\nthe clear intent of the settlers) against a never-ending succession of bogus filings, filings\n\n\n                                               20\n\f submitted by a party that doesn't even have an interest in the Trust assets. Moreover, Mateo\n\n Cortez has continued to file frivolous pleadings in West Virginia and in Texas even after being\n\n specifically put on notice that his litigation conduct is being conducted in bad faith, and even\n\n after having been sanctioned in Texas.\n\n\n                                       V.     CONCLUSION\n\n                From the outset of this case, Mateo Cortez and his attorneys have wrongfully and\n\nunnecessarily forced Mrs. Barry and others to expend over tens of thousands of dollars in legal\n\nfees, over the course of nearly two years, defending against obviously frivolous claims. The sole\n\npurpose of this improper conduct is clear: to obstruct the administration of justice, to deplete the\n\nassets of a Trust to which he has zero claim, and to retaliate against the true beneficiaries of the\n\nTrust for defending their interests.\n\n\n               Although Mrs. Barry, as well as others, are arguably entitled under Sally Mike\n\nProperties for all their attorney fees expended in the case, Mrs. Barry is choosing to focus her\n\nmotion for sanctions on the conduct of Mateo Cortez and his counsel after this Court entered\n\njudgment against Mateo Cortez on September 15, 2016. The reason why Mrs. Barry is focusing\n\non the conduct after September 15, 2016, is because prior to September 15, 2016, Mateo Cortez\n\nwas responding to a Complaint filed in West Virginia that: (a) sought to determine who were the\n\nrightful beneficiaries under the Trust, and (b) specifically named Mateo Cortez as one of the\n\nindividuals laying claim to the Trust. Point being, it is not surprising Mateo Cortez, under those\n\ncircumstances, would respond to this Complaint and lob arguments (however tenuous) in\n\nresponse to the Trustee's Complaint.        However, once this Court entered its well-reasoned\n\ndecision on September 15, 2016, denying Mateo Cortez's claims, Mateo Cortez and his counsel\n\n\n\n\n                                                21\n\f were unequivocally placed on notice that their claims had zero merit, and that any further\n\nimproper behavior to frustrate the lawful administration of the Trust would not go unpunished.\n\n\n                  From September 15, 2016, forward, Mateo Cortez and his counsel engaged in\n\nimproper conduct intended solely to delay the proper administration of the Trust; to waste the\n\ntime and resources of Connie Barry, the Trustee and others; and to deplete the Trust Assets.\n\nFrom September 15, 2016, forward, despite repeated warnings, Mateo Cortez and his counsel\n\nengaged in willful, vexatious, and malicious litigation, entitling Mrs. Barry to an award of\n\nattorney fees.

Again, Your Honor, Brian\n\n24       Thompson on behalf of the third party defendants who are the\n\n25       second group of folks which you just read into the record.          As\n\n\n                                   MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                     (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                            6\n\n\n     1   you've said we're here today on a motion for sanctions.     This\n\n     2   is not a motion for sanctions against any of the parties\n\n     3   involved, this is a motion for sanctions against two of the\n\n     4   attorneys representing Mateo Cortez.\n\n     5                I think the Court's pretty familiar with the\n\n     6   background of this case so I won't go into it at length, but\n\n 7       as you know this is a trust dispute regarding the proper\n\n 8       interpretation of a trust document.    The matter is currently\n\n 9       pending in two different jurisdictions.    There is this case\n\n10       and as well there is a case up in West Virginia.\n\n11                   I'm joined here today with my co-counsel Aaron\n\n12       Boone who is West Virginia counsel for some similarly situated\n\n13       individuals up in West Virginia.   He will be participating in\n\n14       the hearing, he's been admitted pro hac vice by the Court\n\n15       already.\n\n16                   Your Honor, there were two main claims by Mateo\n\n17       Cortez in this matter that effect my clients.   There is the\n\n18       one argument that Deborah Cortez was her parents' sole heir at\n\n19       law and therefore under the terms of the trust she inherited\n\n20       everything upon the death of her mother Phyllis Short.    That\n\n21       argument was what I think took up most of the Court's\n\n22       attention and of course I think the lawyers' attention as well\n\n23       in the motion for reconsideration which I think the Court has\n\n24       in front of it by submission.\n\n25                   After reviewing that allegation, after reviewing\n\n\n                               MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                 (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                             7\n\n\n     1   some of the law on that we still feel like we are definitely\n\n 2       right and entitled to summary judgment on that claim.       But I\n\n 3       will tell you, I do think that that is a colorable claim and\n\n 4       so we are not going to be asking for sanctions today with\n\n 5       regard to that claim.     I am narrowing the scope of our\n\n 6       sanctions motion today.\n\n 7                    Where I will concentrate today on is what I call\n\n 8       the postponement provision argument.    And this is the argument\n\n 9       that under a particular section of the trust that I'm going to\n\n10       go through at length today, that -- this provision applied to\n\n11       beneficiaries who were under the age of 35 at the time they\n\n12       became entitled to distribution under the trust.    And this\n\n13       Court's familiar with those type of provisions.    It's usually\n\n14       put in trusts because there is an assumption I guess on some\n\n15       settlor's part that people under the age of 21, 35, 18,\n\n16       whatever it is, should not get their distribution outright,\n\n17       they may be too immature to be able to handle that kind of\n\n18       money.   And that of course was the intent behind this\n\n19       provision.\n\n20                    We believe that there is no colorable argument\n\n21       under Texas or Florida law, which are basically the same law\n\n22       here, on this issue.    It is very clear and I think all the\n\n23       parties agree that Ms. Cortez was well over the age of 35 not\n\n24       only when she became entitled to distribution under the trust,\n\n25       but even when this trust was actually executed.\n\n\n                                 MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                   (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                         8\n\n\n 1                Your Honor, we're proceeding today under Texas\n\n 2   Rule of Civil Procedure 13 as well as Civil Practice and\n\n 3   Remedies Code, Chapter 10.    As you know the triggering event\n\n 4   for a sanction under both of those sections is the attorney's\n\n 5   signing of a pleading that contains a sanctionable claim.     And\n\n 6   under CPRC Chapter 10 each and every claim must meet the\n\n 7   burden under that rule, and that burden is that each claim is\n\n 8   warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for\n\n 9   the extension and modification or reversal of existing law.\n\n10                I'm going to again narrow the scope of this a\n\n11   little bit and concentrate my efforts on Texas Civil Practice\n\n12   and Remedies Code, Chapter 10.    I think most courts who have\n\n13   interpreted Rule 13 and Chapter 10 say that they are certainly\n\n14   compatible, but I think you have a better chance in this type\n\n15   of situation under Chapter 10 so that's where I'm going to\n\n16   concentrate my efforts.    And we assert that the attorneys\n\n17   William Brotherton and Sean Hester should be sanctioned for\n\n18   violation of Chapter 10.\n\n19                We're going to offer their testimony today, Your\n\n20   Honor.   We're also going to offer the testimony of Linda\n\n21   Murray who is one of the folks that -- whose name you read\n\n22   into the record earlier.    She's both the trustee of the trust\n\n23   at issue as well as a defendant in this part of the case in\n\n24   her individual capacity as a beneficiary.   We're offering her\n\n25   testimony because unlike a lot of cases in civil litigation,\n\n\n                            MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                              (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                        9\n\n\n\n 1   Judge, this case involves real people, and she's kind of the\n\n 2   face of the real people that this case has effected.   And the\n\n 3   Texas Supreme Court has said that those type of stories are\n\n 4   relevant when you're trying to decide what sanctions to grant.\n\n 5               In the Low v. Henry case, and that's 221 S.W.3d,\n\n 6   609, it's a 2007 case out of the Supreme Court of Texas, the\n\n 7   Court cited the American Bar Association's report on standards\n\n 8   and guidelines for practice under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules\n\n 9   of Civil Procedure.   And that is similar to our Rule 13.    And\n\n10   in Footnote 5 of the Court's opinion the Court mentioned in SF\n\n11   that one of the things the Court can rely on in deciding\n\n12   whether to issue sanctions and how much sanctions to issue is,\n\n13   quote, \"The nature and extent of prejudice apart from out of\n\n14   pocket expenses offered by the offended person as a result of\n\n15   the misconduct.\"\n\n16               And so, Your Honor, we're going to offer\n\n17   Ms. Murray's testimony today under the auspices of that\n\n18   footnote from the Texas Supreme Court because she's going to\n\n19   tell the Court exactly how this conduct from Mateo Cortez'\n\n20   attorneys has effected her personally.\n\n21               And then finally we're going to wrap up with my\n\n22   testimony and Mr. Boone's testimony on our attorneys fees.\n\n23   Mr. Boone of course was -- has segregated his fees from this\n\n24   Texas part of the case from -- from what he did in\n\n25   West Virginia and we're only seeking the fees he's incurred\n\n\n                            MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                              (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                        10\n\n\n 1   here in Texas.\n\n 2                Before we get to the evidence, Your Honor, I want\n\n 3   to mention a procedural issue that was raised in the response\n\n 4   to our motion for sanctions which I think was filed late last\n\n 5   week.   The respondents allege that my clients have somehow\n\n 6   waived their right to seek sanctions because they didn't seek\n\n 7   sanctions before the judgment was entered in this matter.\n\n 8   They cite several cases in Footnote 10 of their response.\n\n 9               What they do not tell the Court is that every\n\n10   single one of those cases cited in Footnote 10 is a discovery\n\n11   sanctions case.    This is not a discovery sanctions case.      This\n\n12   is a case involving the substance of their pleadings under\n\n13   Chapter 10, under Rule 13.    And as this Court well knows the\n\n14   Court is free to modify its judgment post judgment to add an\n\n15   award of sanctions.\n\n16               We cited the Texas Supreme Court case on that in\n\n17   our motion and that's the Lane Bank Equipment Company versus\n\n18   Smith Southern Equipment, Inc. case.    That's 10, S.W. 3d, 308.\n\n19   And that case --\n\n20               THE COURT:    And you brought your cases with you?\n\n21               MR. THOMPSON:    I did.   I have one copy of this\n\n22   one, Your Honor.   Would you like me to approach with that?\n\n23               THE COURT:    I would.\n\n24               MR. THOMPSON:    Okay.\n\n25               THE COURT:    Do you need to use it as you're making\n\n\n                              MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                           11\n\n\n\n 1   your presentation?\n\n 2                  MR. THOMPSON:     I don't.   I have another copy of\n\n 3   it.   May I approach?\n\n 4                  THE COURT:     Yes, sir.\n\n 5                  MR. THOMPSON:     Your Honor, we cited this case in a\n\n 6   footnote in our motion stating that the Court -- that once\n\n 7   a -- that once a post -- a post judgment motion for sanctions\n\n 8   is filed that extends the Court's plenary power past 30 days\n\n 9   to decide that motion to essentially -- like a motion for new\n\n10   trial procedurally.     And this is a 2007 case from the Supreme\n\n11   Court that says that.       The Court did not make any issue about\n\n12   waiver or anything like that.       And so, Your Honor, this\n\n13   absolutely stands for the -- the purpose of what we're talking\n\n14   about here which is a post judgment motion to modify the\n\n15   judgment to include sanctions.\n\n16                  It also makes commonsense that you can bring such\n\n17   a motion, maybe not for discovery sanctions because discovery\n\n18   sanctions should be resolved pretrial.        For example, if you\n\n19   don't show up to your deposition the Court should order the\n\n20   person to show up to their deposition.        That's how you remedy\n\n21   a discovery sanction.       But this is based on the entirety of\n\n22   the case, the entirety of Mr. Cortez' case and the underlying\n\n23   substantive claims.     And the only way you're going to know the\n\n24   full extent of the damages caused by that type of sanction is\n\n25   after trial.    Otherwise you're never going to know the damage\n\n\n                                 MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                   (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                       12\n\n\n 1   that it caused.\n\n 2                And again -- so that's what the Lane Bank case\n\n 3   says.   The Lane Bank case says that, you know, post judgment\n\n 4   motion for sanctions is in the -- is in the nature of a motion\n\n 5   to modify and that extends the Court's plenary power.     If\n\n 6   waiver was an issue in that case it would have made much sense\n\n 7   for the Court to hold that.\n\n 8                In addition, Your Honor, this Court regularly\n\n 9   issues sanctions post judgment.   This Court, I believe the one\n\n10   that still stands is this Court's biggest sanctions award ever\n\n11   is the Pool versus Diana case that I was involved in which was\n\n12   upheld on appeal by the Third Court of Appeals.   Petition was\n\n13   denied at the Texas Supreme Court.   And in that case we moved\n\n14   for summary judgment and obtained it against Joe Pool and his\n\n15   clients.   And -- and then the Court a few weeks later issued a\n\n16   post judgment motion for sanctions award.   Nothing about\n\n17   waiver in that case either from the appellate decision.     And\n\n18   that was a much larger award, I believe about $107,000.     And\n\n19   in fact, if you remember the defendants in that case were\n\n20   actually sanctioned on their appeal as well.\n\n21                So I don't see anything in the -- in the appellate\n\n22   case law that says that you waive on substantive sanctions\n\n23   claims if you don't bring them before trial.   And again, it\n\n24   just wouldn't make good sense for that to be the rule because\n\n25   you don't know what the damages are going to be until trial is\n\n\n                            MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                              (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                              13\n\n\n     1   completed.\n\n 2                    And so, Your Honor, that being said, that's kind\n\n 3       of the roadmap of where we're going.      That's the procedural\n\n 4       issue.   I don't know if you want them to respond to the\n\n 5       procedural issue now or if you want to just --\n\n 6                    THE COURT:     I'll let them respond now.\n\n 7                    MR. THOMPSON:     Okay.\n\n 8                    THE COURT:     What is your response, Counselor?\n\n 9                    MR. RUBACK:     Good afternoon, Your Honor.   My name\n\n10       is Chad Ruback, I represent William Brotherton, Sean Hester\n\n11       and the Brotherton Law Firm.      I'm not representing Mr. Cortez.\n\n12       As this Court. correctly noted and counsel has confirmed,\n\n13       Mr. Cortez doesn't have a fight in the -- doesn't have a dog\n\n14       in the fight today, no one is seeking anything from -- he's\n\n15       not seeking anything from anybody.\n\n16                    My response procedurally is first off, the Supreme\n\n17       Court's language, the Supreme Court's pronouncements in a case\n\n18       that was about discovery indeed, didn't limit the Supreme\n\n19       Court's holding to discovery.     The Supreme Court stated, and I\n\n20       quote, \"Waiver bars a trial court from awarding post trial\n\n21       sanctions based on pretrial conduct of which a party was aware\n\n22       before trial,\" end quote.\n\n23                    Yes, admittedly it was a discovery case.      If the\n\n24       Supreme Court wanted to limit its holding to discovery\n\n25       matters, to discovery disputes it certainly could have done\n\n\n                                   MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                     (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                               14\n\n\n     1   so.   There was no limiting language in the Supreme Court's\n\n 2       holding.\n\n 3                    THE COURT:     Do you have a copy of that case for\n\n 4       the Court?\n\n 5                    MR. RUBACK:     I do not, Your Honor.   I believe that\n\n 6       that's a case that both sides had cited.\n\n 7                    THE COURT:     Right.   Okay.\n\n 8                    MR. RUBACK:     I do not have a copy of it.\n\n 9                    THE COURT:    We'll pull it up.\n\n10                    MR. RUBACK:     Furthermore, Your Honor, as counsel\n\n11       has argued, their motion for sanctions is regarding arguments\n\n12       made from the beginning of the case, the totality of the\n\n13       arguments made.    My clients didn't modify their arguments\n\n14       substantively.     They might have refined them somewhat, but my\n\n15       clients have made the same argument from day one in this case.\n\n16                    Admittedly this Court did not agree with my\n\n17       clients' arguments, admittedly this Court granted summary\n\n18       judgment as -- as to the arguments my clients made apparently\n\n19       finding those arguments ultimately not persuasive.         But just\n\n20       because this Court has held that my clients' arguments weren't\n\n21       persuasive, has held that my clients' arguments are wrong does\n\n22       not indicate that my client did not have the right to make\n\n23       those arguments.    Specifically based on counsel's argument\n\n24       that this is not just one argument we're talking about today,\n\n25       this was, you know, the whole conti~uum of arguments made\n\n\n                                   MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                     (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                           15\n\n\n     1   throughout the case.\n\n 2                     If counsel believed that my client was making bad\n\n 3       faith arguments from the initial filing in the case, from each\n\n 4       hearing that this Court has heard in the case, why didn't\n\n 5       counsel bring that to my client's attention?     Why didn't\n\n 6       counsel bring that to the Court's attention?     Laches would bar\n\n 7       the arguments they're making today.\n\n 8                     What they are saying today is my clients made\n\n 9       arguments that were sanctionable long, long ago, but, well,\n\n10       we're going to wait months and months and months to allow my\n\n11       clients to continue to make these arguments that are allegedly\n\n12       sanctionable until after there is a final judgment in the\n\n13       case, after the case is over.\n\n14                     So even if this Court does not believe that it is\n\n15       barred by the Supreme Court's Myer case, which waiver bars a\n\n16       trial court from awarding post trial sanctions based on\n\n17       pretrial conduct of which a party was aware before trial, even\n\n18       if the Court does not find that case persuasive laches would\n\n19       apply here.\n\n20                     There were no brand new arguments made in the\n\n21       case.   My clients have made the same arguments before this\n\n22       Court every time they've been before this Court, every\n\n23       pleading they filed in this case.     Admittedly refined a little\n\n24       bit, but these are the same arguments.\n\n25                     If this Court, who by anyone's estimation is\n\n\n                                 MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                   (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                         16\n\n\n 1   absolutely, positively an expert on trust law, on probate law,\n\n 2   if this Court believed that my client was making sanctionable\n\n 3   arguments as to what the law is from the start, presumably\n\n 4   this Court would have notified my clients, well, guys, you're\n\n 5   getting pretty close to sanctionable conduct here.      This Court\n\n 6   did not do so.\n\n 7               To the contrary in fact, even if this Court has\n\n 8   ruled against my clients' arguments on their substance, this\n\n 9   Court has on the record multiple times thanked my clients for\n\n10   making good arguments.     This Court didn't warn my clients they\n\n11   were on the verge of sanctionable conduct nor did opposing\n\n12   counsel ever warn my clients, ever let the Court know that\n\n13   opposing counsel believed my clients were on the verge of\n\n14   sanctionable conduct.\n\n15               So if my clients have made the same arguments in\n\n16   multiple filings, in multiple hearings before this Court and\n\n17   opposing counsel appears to have waited, let my clients make\n\n18   the same argument again and again and again, laid behind the\n\n19   log until after there is a final judgment in the case laches\n\n20   would bar sanctions in this situation, Your Honor.\n\n21               THE COURT:    Okay.   You want to get back now to\n\n22   your --\n\n23               MR. THOMPSON:    Well,   I want to point out first of\n\n24   all that laches has never been pled.     So this is the first\n\n25   time I've ever heard that argument about that.\n\n\n                              MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                             17\n\n\n 1                  THE COURT:     So noted.\n\n 2                  MR. THOMPSON:     And I have a copy of the Myer case\n\n 3   if you'd like to see it.\n\n 4                  THE COURT:     Okay.   Good.\n\n 5                  MR. THOMPSON:     And I've highlighted where the\n\n 6   Court says, you know, we -- in Rernmington Arms which is\n\n 7   another case I have I can give you, Judge -- in Remmington\n\n 8   Arms we explain the circumstances in which by failing to\n\n 9   obtain a pretrial ruling on a discovery dispute a party waives\n\n10   his or her claim for discovery abuse sanctions.         This whole\n\n11   case is about discovery.       Remmington Arms case that is cited\n\n12   there is all about discovery.         Every single one of the cases\n\n13   cited in their footnote, Judge, are about discovery.        And\n\n14   that's because they can't find a case regarding substantive\n\n15   claims, that type of sanctions that supports their waiver\n\n16   argument.     It would make absolutely no sense if that was the\n\n17   law.\n\n18                 THE COURT:     You may present you all's cases.     You\n\n19   may continue on with your argument.\n\n20                 MR. THOMPSON:     Your Honor, we'll call William\n\n21   Brotherton.\n\n22                 THE COURT:     How many witnesses are we going to\n\n23   have here today?\n\n24                 MR.

In the course of your practice have you\n\n 8   become familiar with Texas case law and rules regarding the\n\n 9   sanctioning of attorneys?\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span>        <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>     <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> haven't had much practice with it.

And do you agree with me that under both of those\n\n19   authorities the triggering event for sanctioning lawyers is\n\n20   the signing of a pleading that is sanctionable?\n\n2</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span>        <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>     <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> believe that's correct.\n\n22        Q.

Okay.   And in looking at the pleadings in this\n\n14       matter I didn't see that your client had made any argument for\n\n15       the extension, modification or reversal of existing law or the\n\n16       establishment of new law.     Is that fair?\n\n1</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span>            <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>       <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">You know, I -- I couldn't say yes or no.\n\n18            Q.       Okay.   It seems to me that most of the claims that\n\n19       you brought      or all of the claims that you brought on behalf\n\n20       of your client were based on Texas law as it exists now.        You\n\n21       weren't saying that law should change, were you?\n\n22            A.       Again -- and I've got to say over the last six\n\n23       months I've spent most of my time in North Dakota so I haven't\n\n24       been involved in this case in a little while.     So you may want\n\n25       to talk with Mr. Hester about some of those technical issues.\n\n\n                                  MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                    (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                         21\n\n\n 1            Q.   Okay.   Well, you understand that you've signed\n\n 2   every pleading except for one with regard to the claims made\n\n 3   against my clients?\n\n 4        A.       Correct.\n\n 5            Q.   Whether you were in North Dakota or not?\n\n 6        A.       Correct.\n\n 7        Q.       And Mr. Hester signed one of them; is that right?\n\n 8        A.       Correct.\n\n 9        Q.       Okay.   And so I'm asking you, can you think of an\n\n10   example where you were asking this Court to change the law or\n\n11   to modify the law or any of those things in any of your\n\n12   pleadings?\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span>        <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>       <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> -- again, I wouldn't be able to say yes or no.\n\n14   I don't believe so but I can't say definitively.\n\n15        Q.       Okay.   Now, I'm going to hand you\n\n16                 MR. THOMPSON:    May I approach the witness, Your\n\n17   Honor?\n\n18                 THE COURT:    You may.\n\n19        Q.       (By Mr. Thompson)    I'm going to hand you a series\n\n20   of documents.    We don't have to mark them as an exhibit\n\n21   because they're pleadings.      But starting with the first\n\n22   document, you see the title of that is Original Petition In\n\n23   Intervention?\n\n24        A.       Yes.\n\n25        Q.       Okay.   Are you familiar with this document?\n\n\n                                MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                  (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                          22\n\n\n     </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span>         <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>    <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> am.\n\n     2         Q.    And if you turn to the next to last page which is\n\n     3   Page 5, is that your signature?\n\n     4         A.    Yes, it is.\n\n     5         Q.    Okay.   And if you look at Page 3 of this original\n\n     6   petition, petition in intervention, just below the middle of\n\n 7       the page there is a No. 2.     And you state -- and this is of\n\n 8       course under a heading that says \"declaratory judgment.\"\n\n 9       You're seeking a declaration that pursuant to the trust\n\n10       Article 8, Section D2, upon the death of Phyllis Short,\n\n11       Deborah Cortez as beneficiary under the trust was entitled to\n\n12       the balance of her trust share including both principal and\n\n13       any accrued and undistributed income because she was over the\n\n14       age of 35 years at the time.    Do you see that statement?\n\n15            A.     Yes.\n\n16            Q.     Can you explain to the Court in your words what\n\n17       you were alleging in that statement on behalf of your client?\n\n18            A.     Well, the trust essentially stated -- and I can\n\n19       give it to you in -- in the context of what I understand it to\n\n20       say, and as you've stated, there is a question of the\n\n21       interpretation as I think you testified, but the -- what we\n\n22       believed was a colorable argument was that Ms. Cortez was\n\n23       entitled to the contents of the trust once she reached\n\n24       35 years of age once her parents died.\n\n25            Q.     Okay.   And just to be sure, there is no question\n\n\n                                MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                  (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                          23\n\n\n 1   that Ms. Cortez was over the age of 35 at the time Phyllis\n\n 2   Short died, correct?\n\n </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span>         <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>       <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> believe that's correct,    yes.\n\n 4         Q.      And it was Phyllis Short's death that then gave\n\n 5   Deborah Cortez the ability to seek distributions under the\n\n 6   trust?     I know we have a difference of opinion about what\n\n 7   those distributions were, but that was the triggering event,\n\n 8   correct?\n\n 9        A.       That's my understanding, yes.\n\n10                 MR. THOMPSON:    Okay.   May I approach, Your Honor?\n\n11                 THE COURT:    You may, sir.\n\n12        Q.        (By Mr. Thompson)   Mr. Brotherton,   I'm going to\n\n13   give you as what I've marked as Exhibit No. 1.

(By Mr. Thompson)     and, Mr. Brotherton, I may\n\n 7   refer to this shorthand as \"the trust\" throughout today.               Is\n\n 8   that         you'll understand\n\n 9           A.       That's fine.\n\n10           Q.       Okay.   If you turn to Page 5 of Exhibit 1, if you\n\n11   look at Section D which I believe is Article 8, Section D,\n\n12   postponement of possession.          Do you see that?\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span>           <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>       <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> do.\n\n14           Q.      Okay.    Is that the provision and everything under\n\n15   it that you think supports the claim that we've been\n\n16   discussing?\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span>           <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>       <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> believe that's correct.\n\n18           Q.      And if I recall that, I think you guys have called\n\n19   it in the past the postponement provision claim?             Is that\n\n20   fair?    You'll understand what I'm talking about when I say\n\n21   that?\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span>           <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>      <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> think so, yes.\n\n23           Q.      Okay.    So do you see that this statement,\n\n24   postponement of possession, it says, \"If any beneficiary is\n\n25   under the age of 35 years at the time he or she becomes\n\n\n                                   MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                     (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                      25\n\n\n 1   entitled to distribution, his or her share shall be maintained\n\n 2   in a continuing trust which shall be administered as follows.\"\n\n 3   Do you see that statement?\n\n </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span>        <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>     <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> do.\n\n 5        Q.     And again, there is no question in this case that\n\n 6   Deborah Cortez was not a beneficiary under the age of 35 years\n\n 7   at the time she became entitled to distribution from the\n\n 8   trust, correct?\n\n 9        A.     Rephrase your question?\n\n10        Q.     You see that this statement here says -- the\n\n11   qualifying language is that if any beneficiary is under the\n\n12   age of 35 y2ars at the time he or she becomes entitled to\n\n13   possession, then X, Y and Z.    Do you see that?\n\n14        A.     Entitled to distribution?\n\n15        Q.     Yes.\n\n16        A.     \"His or her share shall be maintained in a\n\n17   continuous -- in a continuing trust which shall be\n\n18   administered as follows.\"    Is that what you're referring to?\n\n19        Q.     Do you see that statement?\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span>        <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>     <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> do.\n21        Q.     Okay.   And there is no dispute in this matter that\n\n22   Deborah Cortez was over the age of 35 at the time she became\n\n23   entitled to distribution, correct?\n\n2</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span>        <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>     <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> don't know if I can agree with that statement.\n\n25   I'm not sure what you're asking me to agree with.\n\n\n                            MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                              (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                        26\n\n\n 1           Q.    Okay.   Well, when was -- what was the\n\n 2   triggering -- I thought we'd been through this, but what was\n\n 3   the triggering event that entitled Deborah Cortez to a\n\n 4   distribution under this trust?     Was it not her mother's death?\n\n 5           A.    Correct.\n\n 6           Q.    Okay.   And is there any dispute that at the time\n\n 7   Phyllis Short died, Deborah Cortez' mother died, that Deborah\n\n 8   was over the age of 35?\n\n 9           A.    As I understand it, yes.\n\n10           Q.    Okay.   In fact, she was over the age of 35 when\n\n11   this document was executed, correct?\n\n12           A.    Correct.   Well, I believe so.\n\n13           Q.    Well, sir, I can actually point out in your\n\n14   pleadings where you stated this?\n\n15           A.    Okay.\n\n16           Q.    So do you disagree with me or no?\n\n1</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span>           <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>    <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">No.\n\n18           Q.    Okay.   So if this provision, the qualifying\n\n19   language of this provision is that you have to be under the\n\n20   age of 35 in order for all of these things to apply to you,\n\n21   how could you possibly think that this section applies to\n\n22   Deborah Cortez and entitles her to the entirety of the trust?\n\n2</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span>           <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>   <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">Well, there is -- there is a lot of language in\n\n24   here.    I think we've used several arguments in this.   We've\n\n25   consulted with a trust expert on this.     And so based on -- on\n\n\n                              MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                          27\n\n\n 1   the language in this, it's our contention that Deborah Cortez\n\n 2   was entitled to the trust proceeds.\n\n 3          Q.     What trust expert did you consult with on this?\n\n 4          A.     Dick Kelsey.\n\n 5          Q.     Okay.    And Mr. Kelsey told you that your\n\n 6   interpretation of this trust, this provision of this trust was\n\n 7   correct?\n\n 8          A.     That is correct.\n\n 9          Q.     Okay.    So you said there is some particular\n\n10   language in here that supports your argument.      Tell me what\n\n11   that language is.\n\n12          A.     Well,   there is -- there is certainly the\n\n13   provisions in regards to if any assets of the trust remained\n\n14   undistributed upon Deborah's death, or if she fails to survive\n\n15   us,   the remainder of the trust estate shall be distributed as\n\n16   follows.    And clearly Deborah Cortez was the beneficiary of\n\n17   the Shorts and was an heir at law.\n\n18          Q.     Okay.   Well, you understand that that -- that's\n\n19   kind of one of the claims that you made, but in the\n\n20   alternative you also made this claim about this 35 year-old\n\n21   provision, correct?\n\n22          A.     Well,   I think I -- like I say, I have been working\n\n23   out of state quite a bit and I think i t would be helpful if I\n\n24   had a copy of the -- of the claims that we've made because\n\n25   you're asking me to recollect a very complex document.

Okay.    Well, sir, you have all of your pleadings\n\n 5       in front of you.    What I've given you is -- although we've\n\n 6       just been over the original petition in intervention and --\n\n 7       and in that section we went through this No. 2, which says\n\n 8       \"Pursuant to the trust, Article 8, Section D2, upon Phyllis\n\n 9       Short's death Deborah Cortez inherited the balance because she\n\n10       was over the age of 35.\"    I thought we agreed that that's\n\n11       basically the claim that we're talking about?\n\n12            A.     Okay.\n\n13            Q.     Okay.    So let's set aside the heir at law issue.\n\n14       As I told the Judge earlier I actually have been convinced now\n\n15       that that is a colorable claim.    I'm not asking for sanctions\n\n16       against you today because of that.   But I do want to\n\n17       concentrate on this Article 8, Section D2 provision.     And I\n\n18       thought you had said that in addition to the language that I\n\n19       have read in -- into the record, that there is additional\n\n20       language in here that you believe supports your position and I\n\n21       would like to know what that language is.\n\n22            A.     Well,   I need a few minutes to go through and look\n\n23       through    look through the petition.\n\n24            Q.     Okay.   And while you -- while you do that\n\n25       before you do that, and I'll give you all the time in the\n\n\n                                 MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                   (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                           29\n\n\n 1   world, will you agree with me that this claim -- maybe in\n\n 2   different words, but the gist of this claim has been in every\n\n 3   petition that you've filed since that original petition?\n\n </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span>           <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>   <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> couldn't say yes or no.\n\n 5           Q.

And if you'll give me your\n\n23   packet there that he was using.        Is there another copy of\n\n24   that?\n\n25                MR. THOMPSON:     Absolutely.

Are you\n\n 2                  THE COURT:     He took up his binder with the\n\n 3   pleadings.\n\n 4                  MR.

I'm aware.\n\n13                  MR. THOMPSON:     Okay.     May I proceed, Your Honor?\n\n14                  THE COURT:    Yes, sir.\n\n15        Q.        (By Mr. Thompson)      Mr. Brotherton, before the\n\n16   break I had given you a stack of pleadings that are the\n\n17   Original Petition in Intervention and then the first,          second,\n\n18   third and fourth amended version of that document.           Did you\n\n19   have a chance to review those?\n\n20        A.        Primarily the Motion to Reconsider.\n\n21        Q.        Okay.   My question before the break was whether\n\n22   you would agree with me that this postponement provision claim\n\n23   had been made in those five pleadings that I just named.           Will\n\n24   you agree with me to that now?           Or do we need to go through\n\n25   each and every one of these?\n\n\n                                 MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                   (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                       31\n\n\n </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span>         <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>    <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">Probably need to go through each and every one.\n\n 2   Because here is the thing       just to explain this, you know,\n\n 3   I've got six attorneys counting myself plus various other\n\n 4   attorneys that we use if -- if we need to -- to get special\n\n 5   legal counsel.   And so in this case -- this is obviously a\n\n 6   pretty complex case, and I'm not going to sit here and try and\n\n 7   be able to go through every page, line-by-line of every copy\n\n 8   of the pleadings and be able to talk just absolutely clear on\n\n 9   everything, especially in light of the fact that I'd been\n\n10   involved in some other substantial cases out of state.      So\n\n11   certainly I'll try to answer your question, but as far as\n\n12   going through every pleading and talking about what\n\n13   specifically in each pleading, we'll probably need to go\n\n14   through each one.\n\n15        Q.     Okay.   Well, will you agree with me that you\n\n16   signed all five of those pleadings as the attorney of record\n\n17   in this case for Mr. Cortez?\n\n18        A.     Well, again,    I'd say that as the lead counsel I\n\n19   have a number of people working for me and so yes\n\n20               MR.

So I'm going to approach\n\n17   with the First Amended Petition in Intervention.      The first\n\n18   question I'm going to ask you is -- there is the title, First\n\n19   Amended Petition in Intervention and Third Party Petition\n\n20   filed on December 30th, 2015.     My first question for you, sir,\n\n21   is    Melissa, can you hear me okay?      On Page 8 is that your\n\n22   signature?\n\n2</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span>        <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>      <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">t is.\n\n24        Q.      And there you're signing on behalf of several\n\n25   lawyers but you're signing as the lawyer signing this\n\n\n                               MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                 (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                             33\n\n\n 1   petition; is that right?\n\n 2            A.   Right.\n\n 3            Q.   Okay.    If you look on Page 6, Section 2, there is\n\n 4   a statement I believe that is verbatim, identical to the\n\n 5   statement in the Original Petition in Intervention.          Can you\n\n 6   read that No. 2 into the record, please, sir?\n\n </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span>            <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>   <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\"That pursuant to the trust, Article 3,\n\n 8   Section D2, upon the death of Phyllis D.

And you're still signing pleadings as the attorney\n\n12   of record on behalf of your client Mateo Cortez?\n\n1</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span>        <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>        <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">Well, I'm not up there full-time, but it's\n\n14   certainly       I've -- like any attorney you're involved in\n\n15   other cases.     And again, I've got a staff that did the\n\n16   research and was preparing the documents and I reviewed them.\n\n17   But certainly -- the reason I mentioned North Dakota is\n\n18   because I haven't been able to live and breathe this case\n\n19   probably as much as I would like.\n\n20        Q.

(By Mr. Thompson)   This is a copy of Chapter 10 of\n\n 2   the Civil Practices and Remedies Code which as I mentioned,\n\n 3   this is the authority we're relying on to seek sanctions.      In\n\n 4   Section 10.001 it states that the signing of a pleading\n\n 5   constitutes a certificate by the signatory, that due to the\n\n 6   signatory's best knowledge,    information and belief formed\n\n 7   after reasonable inquiry, and then No. 2, each claim in the\n\n 8   pleading is warranted by existing law, dot, dot, dot.

Do you see that?\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span>        <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>       <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> do.\n\n11        Q.       Okay.   In signing these pleadings that we've just\n\n12   been through, did you understand that you were certifying to\n\n13   this Court that each claim in that pleading was warranted by\n\n14   existing law or by non-frivolous argument to the extension,\n\n15   modification or reversal of existing law?\n\n16        A.       Absolutely.   And they were colorable claims and I\n\n17   still believe that.\n\n18        Q.       Okay.   Regardless of your involvement in the\n\n19   North Dakota case you still believe that?\n\n20        A.       Correct.\n\n21        Q.       Okay.   What reasonable inquiry did you do to\n\n22   inform yourself of whether this postponement provision claim\n\n23   met the standards of the Civil Practices and Remedies Code,\n\n24   Chapter 10?\n\n25        A.       We did quite a bit of research, LexisNexis, talked\n\n\n                              MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                            38\n\n\n     1   with attorneys in the firm, we conferenced on it, and then we\n\n     2   went and met with one of the premiere trust attorneys in the\n\n 3       state.\n\n 4                Q.

And I think you alluded to this, but am I\n\n14       correct that it's -- it's your belief that the specific\n\n15       language of Article 8, Section Dis what entitles Deborah\n\n16       Cortez to recover under this postponement claim; is that\n\n17       right?\n\n18            A.       That's my understanding, yes.\n\n19            Q.       Okay.   And I've been through some language, but I\n\n20       think before the break you had said there was some additional\n\n21       language in this section that you thought entitled her to\n\n22       distribution.    And I want to ask you again, can you show me in\n\n23       Exhibit 1\n\n24            A.       Well\n\n25            Q.       -- the language that you're relying on?\n\n\n                                    MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                      (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                         39\n\n\n     </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span>         <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>    <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">-- the fact is she was the only child, she was the\n\n 2       only beneficiary, she was the only heir at law.\n\n 3             Q.    Okay.\n\n 4             A.    The trust specifically references that the trust\n\n 5       was -- was written solely for the benefit of Deborah Cortez\n\n 6       for health, safety, welfare.\n\n 7             Q.    Where does it say that last -- I want you to point\n\n 8       out in Exhibit 1 where this trust says it was written solely\n\n 9       for the benefit of Deborah Cortez.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span>            <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>     <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">'m probably paraphrasing a little bit.\n\n11            Q.

Well, sir, I thought that's what we had taken a\n\n15       break to do earlier?\n\n16            A.     Well, you asked me to look at the pleadings.\n\n17            Q.     And you don't do that either, sir.\n\n18            A.     Well, I did.\n\n19            Q.     So show me where in this trust document it says\n\n20       that this trust is written exclusively for the benefit of\n\n21       Deborah Cortez, or whatever you think you've paraphrased.\n\n22            A.     Well, you could start with Article 2, family,\n\n23       children, \"We have one child of our marriage, Deborah A.\n\n24       Cortez, an adult.\"     In 10, \"Our primary concern during\n\n25       Deborah's life is for her health, support, education, welfare\n\n\n                                  MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                    (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                       40\n\n\n 1   and best interest, and the trustee need not consider the\n\n 2   interest of any other beneficiaries in making distributions to\n\n 3   her or on her behalf for those purposes under this paragraph.\"\n\n 4        Q.     Okay.    Let me ask you about that.   It says that\n\n 5   our primary concern during Deborah's life is for these things.\n\n 6   Doesn't that suggest that they had a different concern after\n\n 7   Deborah died?\n\n 8        A.     Are you saying it's ambiguous?\n\n 9        Q.     No,   sir.   I'm saying when this says \"our primary\n\n10   concern is this during Deborah's life,\" doesn't that suggest\n\n11   that there may be another primary concern after Deborah dies?\n\n12        A.     Not necessarily.\n\n13        Q.     Anything else that you can find that supports your\n\n14   statement that this trust was written solely for the benefit\n\n15   of Deborah Cortez?\n\n16        A.     Yeah, the 10 part is the biggest part.\n\n17        Q.     The part about Deborah's life?\n\n18        A.     Right.\n\n19        Q.     And again, back to my original question, is there\n\n20   any other language in that D portion,   the postponement of\n\n21   possession portion, that you believe supports this\n\n22   postponement provision claim?\n\n2</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span>        <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>     <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">You're talking about in the trust?\n\n24        Q.

And I'm asking you, can you\n\n 2       point out what language you believe in Article 8, Section D\n\n 3       supports this claim?       And that's on Page 5 of the trust.\n\n 4             A.      Well,   I mean, whatever we put in our pleadings\n\n 5       is -- is      addresses that.     I'm not going to sit here and try\n\n 6       and explain it all to you at this point because certainly\n\n 7       we've outlined in our pleadings, we've consulted with\n\n 8       necessary experts and we believe every claim we've made is\n\n 9       colorable.\n\n10             Q.      Was Mr. Kelsey going to testify in this case if it\n\n11       had reached trial as an expert?\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span>            <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>       <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> hadn't made that decision yet.\n\n13            Q.

(By Mr. Thompson} Now, Mr. Brotherton, you've made\n\n20       this same claim in a matter pending in a West Virginia court,\n\n21       correct?\n\n22            A.       Well -- and that's not a simple yes or no\n\n23       question.    As you know this whole lawsuit here was brought\n\n24       about by Ms. Murray filing suit against Mr. Cortez.      We again,\n\n25       doing our due diligence on this case and investigating and\n\n\n                                    MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                      (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                         42\n\n\n 1   doing everything we needed to do to determine that we had\n\n 2   claims that could be colorable on this, we filed our petition\n\n 3   in intervention.    During the course of the litigation in this\n\n 4   case, after Judge Herman directed that we bring in all the\n\n 5   third party defendants and the churches that were addressed in\n\n 6   the trust, suit was filed by Ms. Murray in West Virginia.      So\n\n 7   everything that was done in West Virginia was of course\n\n 8   similar to what we were doing here in addressing the same\n\n 9   claims.\n\n10               MR.

(By Mr. Thompson)     Sir, did you allege in the\n\n14   West Virginia case that under Article 8, Section D2 of the\n\n15   trust, because Deborah was over the age of 35 when Phyllis\n\n16   Short died then she inherited all the trust assets and Cortez\n\n17   as her sole heir then inherited all the trust assets?\n\n18        A.     That's -- that's part of our claims, yes.\n\n19        Q.     In West Virginia?\n\n20        A.     Correct.\n\n21        Q.     Okay.

Well, certainly, again, it's our position and I\n\n 7   think you've conceded at least one of the points is that\n\n 8   Deborah Cortez is entitled to the trust proceeds.\n\n 9        Q.     Well, I have certainly not conceded that and if\n\n10   that's what you think I said then I retract that.    I think\n\n11   what I said is that I withdrew our sanctions motion on that\n\n12   point because I think it is a colorable argument.    I certainly\n\n13   do not endorse your theory on that.    I think we were still\n\n14   entitled to summary judgment, absolutely.    But if there has\n\n15   been some confusion on that I want to set the record straight.\n\n16   And all I did was withdraw our sanctions motion on that point.\n\n17   I still think you were absolutely, totally wrong.\n\n18        A.     Well, certainly we have a difference of opinion\n\n19   because\n\n20        Q.     Sure.    And you and Judge Waters have a difference\n\n21   of opinion, correct?\n\n22        A.     Right.\n\n23        Q.     And I want to know, again, what the basis is for\n\n24   you disagreeing with Judge Waters' order here?\n\n25        A.

That's correct.\n\n19        Q.

Okay.     You understand that that claim was made\n\n 5   pursuant to the postponement provision in the trust which is I\n\n 6   believe marked as Exhibit 1 up there.         And that's on Page 5,\n\n 7   that's Article 8, Section D?\n\n </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span>        <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>       <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> do.\n\n 9        Q.

Okay.     Can you tell me the language in Article 8,\n\n13   Section D that you believe supports the postponement provision\n\n14   claim?\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span>        <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>       <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> can.     Let me get to it.\n\n16        Q.       Uh-huh.\n\n1</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span>        <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>       <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">The -- well, first of all -- let's see.          Okay.   So\n\n18   first of all it refers to any beneficiary.         And clearly in my\n\n19   mind Deborah Cortez was the only named beneficiary in this\n\n20   in this case.     So when I'm reading \"postponement of\n\n21   possession\" it says \"if any beneficiary,\" in my mind that has\n\n22   to apply to Deborah Cortez.\n\n23        Q.       Okay.     Let's talk about that.\n\n24        A.       Because she's -- because she's the only -- I mean,\n\n25   until she died she's the only beneficiary.\n\n\n                                MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                  (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                           56\n\n\n     1         Q.      Okay.   You're talking about right there at the\n\n 2       front end it says if any beneficiary is under the age of\n\n 3       35 years, dot, dot, dot?\n\n 4             A.      At the time he or she becomes entitled to\n\n 5       distribution, that's correct.\n\n 6             Q.      Okay.   That's the \"any beneficiary\" language\n\n 7       you're referring to?\n\n 8            A.       Correct.\n\n 9             Q.      Okay.   Do you not agree with me that this\n\n10       provision did not apply to Deborah Cortez because as has been\n\n11       admitted by your co-counsel she was over the age of 35 at the\n\n12       time she became entitled to distribution?\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span>            <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>       <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> don't agree.\n\n14            Q.       Okay.   And why not?\n\n15            A.       Because to me this postponement of possession\n\n16       would apply if she was under 35.     I think clearly if Deborah\n\n17       was under the age of 35 she would have had postponement of\n\n18       possession.    So the way it applies to me is if she's over\n\n19       35 then she would have been entitled to full distribution of\n\n20       the assets because there would not be a postponement of\n\n21       possession.\n\n22            Q.       Okay.\n\n2</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span>            <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>       <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">And that's what I've always argued.\n\n24            Q.

Right.\n\n11            Q.     \"When such beneficiary reaches the age of 35 years\n\n12       his or her trust share shall be distributed to the\n\n13       beneficiary.\"   Do you see that?\n\n14            A.

Okay.    Do you not agree with me that when the\n\n21       trust says \"when such beneficiary reaches the age of 35\" it's\n\n22       talking about the beneficiaries that were under the age of\n\n23       35 at the time they were entitled to their distribution?\n\n2</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span>            <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>     <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> would assume it was talking about any\n\n25       beneficiary because that's what's named.\n\n\n                                 MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                   (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                        58\n\n\n 1         Q.    Well, why would the document say \"such\n\n 2   beneficiary\" if it was talking about any beneficiary?      Doesn't\n\n 3   \"such\" qualify a beneficiary?\n\n 4        A.     To me it says \"if any beneficiary,\" and then you\n\n 5   read that and i t says \"when such beneficiary.\"\n\n 6         Q.    But, sir, i t doesn't say \"if any beneficiary.\"       It\n\n 7   says \"if any beneficiary is under the age of 35 years,\"\n\n 8   correct?\n\n 9        A.     Right.     Right.\n\n10        Q.     And under your theory we would totally throw that\n\n11   phrasing out the window because it doesn't matter if they're\n\n12   under or over age 35?\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span>        <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>     <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">t does matter because --\n\n14        Q.     Okay.     Why does it matter?\n\n15        A.     Because if Deborah was under 35 she would have\n\n16   been subject to the postponement.\n\n17        Q.     Yes, she would.     But she's not subject to i t\n\n18   because she was over the age of 35, correct?\n\n19        A.     Which means there is no postponement.     That's what\n\n20   we've always argued.\n\n21        Q.     Okay.

But, yes, to answer your question.\n\n 2                Q.        I understand there is some dispute about the\n\n 3       capacity issues related to the West Virginia case.           I\n 4       understand that you only represent Mateo Cortez in his\n\n 5       individual capacity in West Virginia.           But on the substance,\n\n 6       the substance of the postponement provision claim that we've\n\n 7       referred to today, that's what Judge Waters is talking about\n\n 8       in Paragraph 29, correct?\n\n 9                A.       Okay.\n\n10                Q.       Do you agree with me?

Okay.   Well, even if that is so the Judge goes on\n\n18       to talk about his claim, Mateo Cortez in whatever capacity,               is\n\n19       that          because Article 8, Section D2 of the trust states\n\n20       that          and then it reads in the 35 year provision.        Do you\n\n21       see that?\n\n22               A.

Not 15,000 a month.\n\n15               THE COURT:     Okay.   Because, I mean, you said --\n\n16   let me go back and look at this.       You said that he called\n\n17   you\n\n18               THE WITNESS:     On December the 9th of 2011.\n\n19               THE COURT:     Right after --\n\n20               THE WITNESS:     Debbie died.\n\n21               THE COURT:     Debbie died.

Each month.\n\n24               THE COURT:     And I'm just trying to say who was\n\n25   directing that?     Because I don't read the trust to say that.\n\n\n                              MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                                   75\n\n\n     1                 THE WITNESS:     Because Debbie acted on her -- by\n\n 2       herself after Phyllis died.\n\n 3                     THE COURT:     No, before Phyllis -- okay.

Let me think.\n\n18                     THE COURT:     But were you directing that payment as\n\n19       co-trustee?\n\n20                     THE WITNESS:     No.\n\n21                     THE COURT:     Who do you think was directing that?\n\n22                     THE WITNESS:     Debbie set it up with the investors\n\n23       through Bob Schlager.\n\n24                     THE COURT:     Okay.    So she as a co-trustee\n\n25       contacted Mr. Schlager?\n\n\n                                    MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                      (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                           76\n\n\n 1                THE WITNESS:     And she set up these accounts with\n\n 2   the money that was in the trust.        She operated on her behalf.\n\n 3   I never did anything except sign some blank documents which I\n\n 4   knew nothing about.     I called Bob to say -- I called Bob\n\n 5   Schlager and asked him what -- I said, \"Why am I signing these\n\n 6   blank documents?\"     And there was a stack like this.\n\n 7   (Indicating.)   And he said, \"Do I have to get a plane and come\n\n 8   clear up the -- West Virginia to go over each and every one of\n\n 9   these documents?\"     And I told him, I said, \"I've worked in\n\n10   banking all my life and I was always told never to let anyone\n\n11   sign a document in blank.\"      But he was very, very rude and --\n\n12                THE COURT:     Okay.    So you -- well, you may have\n\n13   signed a blank document\n\n14                THE WITNESS:     Yes, I --\n\n15                THE COURT:     -- but you're telling me you didn't\n\n16   authorize any $15,000 a month payment?\n\n17                THE WITNESS:     Well, no, I did not but I signed the\n\n18   document .\n\n19                THE COURT:     Right.   You signed these blank\n\n20   documents but you didn't really know --\n\n21                THE WITNESS:     What was being done.\n\n22                THE COURT:     -- these payments were being done\n\n23   until Mateo called you.     And then he says you're going to be\n\n24   receiving these payments forward?\n\n25                THE WITNESS:     That is correct.\n\n\n                               MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                 (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                          77\n\n\n 1                 THE COURT:     Okay.\n\n 2           Q.     (By Mr. Boone)     Now, what conclusions did you --\n\n 3   let's go back to that $15,000 payment that Mateo said would be\n\n 4   coming to you as the trustee?\n\n 5           A.    Uh-huh.\n\n 6           Q.    What conclusions did you draw as to what Mateo\n\n 7   felt or thought about his entitlement to the trust at that\n\n 8   point?\n\n 9           A.    Well, he thought that the money was going to come\n\n10   to me because he thought I was the trust (sic) at that time\n\n11   and I was going to get all those          that money.    We gave\n\n12   Debbie -- because I was supposed to give Debbie 50,000, which\n\n13   I didn't know, I didn't have a copy of the trust so I had no\n\n14   idea.    And -- and Debbie did an automatic draft from one of\n\n15   the investments to her own checking account for the $50,000\n\n16   for the first year, and then would have been supposed to give\n\n17   her $25,000 for the second year.       But she didn't live to get\n\n18   the second.    But I did not know that\n\n19                 THE COURT:     Well, let me stop you.     You got a copy\n\n20   of this trust agreement when?\n\n21                 THE WITNESS:      February the 17th of 2016 from Mateo\n\n22   Cortez because I couldn't get anything from Bob Schlager.\n\n23                 THE COURT:     Okay.   Do you have that instrument\n\n24   down there?\n\n25                 THE WITNESS:     With me now?\n\n\n                                MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                  (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                            78\n\n\n 1                 MR.

Look at the provision about\n\n 4   what happens when Phyllis dies.\n\n 5                 MR. BOONE:     Is that Article 7, disposition after\n\n 6   death of second spouse?\n\n 7                 THE COURT:     Yes.\n\n 8        Q.       (By Mr. Boone)        That's on Page 4 of 14,\n\n 9   Ms. Murray.\n\n10        A.       Okay.   Disposition after the death of second\n\n11   spouse.    Debbie was -- well, we were          the trustee -- I mean,\n\n12   the two co-trustees were supposed to            \"On the death of the\n\n13   second spouse the trust shall be administered as follows;\n\n14   payment of expenses and taxes.

Continue.   Well, one question.\n\n 6   Do you know whether or not those charities got whatever they\n\n 7   were entitled to?\n\n 8               THE WITNESS:     Yes.\n\n 9               THE COURT:     Okay.     Now let's go down to the next\n\n10   section.\n\n11               THE WITNESS:     Cash distribution -- cash\n\n12   distributions.   I can't talk.\n\n13               THE COURT:     Distribution.\n\n14               THE WITNESS:     Excuse me.     Okay.    \"Cash\n\n15   distribution to Deborah.     If our daughter Deborah A. Cortez is\n\n16   living and legally competent the trustee shall distribute to\n\n17   her the sum of $50,000 as soon as practicable after the death\n\n18   of the second one of us to die.        If Deborah is not there -- if\n\n19   Deborah is not then living or is not legally competent then\n\n20   this gift shall lapse and the remainder of the trust estate\n\n21   shall be administered as provided below.\"\n\n22               \"Continuing trust for Deborah.          If our daughter\n\n23   Deborah A.

Let me look at that for a\n\n 8       minute.    I'm going to ask you a question.        So you were the\n\n 9       co-trustee upon Phyllis' death?\n\n10                     THE WITNESS:     Yes.\n\n11                     THE COURT:     Were you involved in making the\n\n12       $50,000 distribution?\n\n13                    THE WITNESS:      No, I was not.\n\n14                    THE COURT:      You didn't have a copy of this trust,\n\n15       did you?\n\n16                    THE WITNESS:      No.\n\n17                    THE COURT:      Then after that $50,000 distribution\n\n18       there was to be a second payment which would have been one\n\n19       year from the date of death of the second of us -- of one\n\n20       the second one of us to die.          So if Phyllis -- what's the date\n\n21       of Phyllis' death?\n\n22                    THE WITNESS:      Phyllis' death was January the 5th\n\n23       of 2011.\n\n24                    THE COURT:      Okay.    So as soon as practicable\n\n25       $50,000 was payable?\n\n\n                                    MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                      (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                                  81\n\n\n     1               THE WITNESS:     Right.\n\n 2                   THE COURT:     Then -- then there would be some\n\n 3       income during the period quarterly or more frequently at\n\n 4       Deborah's request.   Were you involved in any of that?\n\n 5                   THE WITNESS:     No, I was not.\n\n 6                   THE COURT:     Then there is to be another payment,\n\n 7       principal, of 25,000 one year after Deborah's death?\n\n 8                   THE WITNESS:     Right.\n\n 9                   THE COURT:     And that obviously never came to\n\n10       fruition so that would have never been made.           But there would\n\n11       have been some income during that time.           Now, when you say you\n\n12       signed these documents in blank, was that after Phyllis'\n\n13       death?\n\n14                   THE WITNESS:     That was after Phyllis' death.\n\n15                   THE COURT:     And -- but you -- there wasn't numbers\n\n16       iike here is the 50,000, here is income?\n\n17                   THE WITNESS:     They were completely blank.\n\n18                   THE COURT:     Okay.     Thank you.\n\n19                   THE WITNESS:     Okay.\n\n20                   THE COURT:     But you didn't act as the trustee\n\n21       even though you may have been the trustee you didn't have the\n\n22       agreement to know what you were to do?\n\n23                   THE WITNESS:     No, I had no idea about anything.\n\n24                   THE COURT:     Okay.     You may proceed.\n\n25                   MR.

And with their help and\n\n 8       everything else going on I was able to get all of the money\n\n 9       transferred.        But when I talked to Bob Schlager to ask him to\n\n10       send me a copy of the trust, which I did not get, he said that\n\n11       he had some papers that he wanted me to fill out.

THOMPSON:\n\n 7                  Judge, my name is Brian Thompson as the Court is\n\n 8   aware by now I'm sure.     I'm the attorney of record for the\n\n 9   third party defendants in this matter who are the movants in\n\n10   this motion.     I was licensed by the Supreme Court of Texas to\n\n11   practice law in the State of Texas in November of 2005 after\n\n12   completing my studies at the University of Texas School of\n\n13   Law.   Since that time I've practiced civil litigation in\n\n14   Travis County first with the law firm of McGinnis Lochridge       &\n\n15   Kilgore where I was a partner, now at the law firm of Hopper\n\n16   Mikeska which as this Court well knows is a law firm\n\n17   specializing in estate planning, administration, probate and\n\n18   trust litigation.\n\n19                  In my practice I've become familiar with customary\n\n20   rates for attorneys who practice in this area in Travis County\n\n21   and I believe that my rate charged in this matter falls within\n\n22   the range of reasonable fees.     My billable rate in this matter\n\n23   was set at $300 an hour except for all time after January 1st\n\n24   of this year has been charged at a rate of $325 per hour.\n\n25                  Your Honor, I would offer into evidence as\n\n\n                              MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                                102\n\n\n     1   Exhibit 5 a copy of my bills in this matter.\n\n     2                (Movant's Exhibit No. 5\n\n 3                   was offered into evidence.)\n\n 4                   THE COURT:     Any objection?\n\n 5                   MR. RUBACK:     No objection, Your Honor.\n\n 6                   THE COURT:     No. 5 will be admitted.\n\n 7                    (Movant's Exhibit No. 5\n\n 8                   was admitted into evidence.)\n\n 9                   MR. THOMPSON:     Okay.\n\n10                   THE COURT:     You may continue.\n\n11                   MR. THOMPSON:     Thank you, Judge.\n\n12                   As is set out in Exhibit 5 there is descriptions\n\n13       for all of the legal services that I have done in this case on\n\n14       behalf of my clients which I believe were reasonable and\n\n15       necessary in defending against the claims made by Mateo Cortez\n\n16       in this matter that implicated my clients.        In particular\n\n17       these fees were necessary in defending against Mateo Cortez'\n\n18       claim regarding the postponement provision.        And because this\n\n19       claim was inextricably intertwined with the other claim made\n\n20       by Cortez against my clients I have not been able to segregate\n\n21       the -- the fees between the two claims.        All of the time that\n\n22       I spent on one was spent on the other.\n\n23                   In addition, Mr. Boone is going to testify with\n\n24       regard to his fees.   I have reviewed those fees as well.         He\n\n25       will talk about those more in depth.     His rate is lower than\n\n\n                                  MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                    (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                        103\n\n\n 1   mine so I think it's also within the scope of reasonable fees\n\n 2   in Travis County in this area.     In addition I'll point out\n\n 3   that based on my review of Mr. Boone's fees he has segregated\n\n 4   out all of the time that he has spent with regard to the Texas\n\n 5   piece of the litigation versus the West Virginia piece.\n\n 6                Your Honor, my fees in this matter through\n\n 7   Thursday of last week, which is January the 26th, were\n\n 8   $49,800.   I believe I've spent an additional ten hours in\n\n 9   preparing for this hearing which would be an additional $3,250\n\n10   for a total of $53,000 -- $53,050.\n\n11                I will point out, because I do think it's\n\n12   important, that I incurred $18,650.04 before September\n\n13   the 15th, 2016 which was the date of Judge Waters' order out\n\n14   of West Virginia.   Thereafter I have incurred $34,399.96.        So\n\n15   if the Court puts some impetus on that West Virginia order\n\n16   that would be the amount we ask for.        But we're actually\n\n17   asking for the full $53,050 at this time.\n\n18               THE COURT:     Any questions?\n\n19               MR. RUBACK:     Yes.\n\n20\n\n21                             CROSS-EXAMINATION\n\n22   BY MR. RUBACK:\n\n23        Q.     Mr. Thompson, we keep hearing about Judge Waters'\n\n24   order, the interlocutory in West Virginia.       Do you believe\n\n25   that that order should be binding, that interlocutory order\n\n\n                              MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                           104\n\n\n     1   from West Virginia should be binding in this Court?\n\n 2                   MR. THOMPSON:     I'm going to object to the\n\n 3       relevance of that question as to my fees.\n\n 4                   THE COURT:     I'm going to overrule the objection.\n\n 5                   MR. THOMPSON:     No, in fact I actually stated that\n\n 6       in a pleading in this matter.     I stated that it is not binding\n\n 7       on this Court.    But I do think it is important to have shown\n\n 8       your clients' notice that that claim had already been decided\n\n 9       by another court in what I believe to be a very well reasoned\n\n10       opinion that cited not only the Texas and West Virginia law\n\n11       but also Florida law.    Under three different states' laws\n\n12       Judge Waters found that that claim had no merit and dismissed\n\n13       it.\n\n14             Q.    (By Mr. Ruback)     You mentioned the word \"notice\"\n\n15       in your last sentence, sir.     When did you first provide my\n\n16       clients' notice that you believed their conduct was\n\n17       sanctionable?    Was it right after their first alleged\n\n18       sanctionable conduct, their second, third, fourth,    fifth or\n\n19       not until after the final judgment in this case?\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span>             <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>    <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> believe that I've called this claim throughout\n\n21       my pleadings \"absurd.\"    That's a word that I've used\n\n22       frequently in this case regarding your clients' allegations.\n\n23       However, the first time I think that I stated that these were\n\n24       sanctionable under CPRC 10 and Rule 13 was upon the filing of\n\n25       my motion to modify judgment to include sanctions award which\n\n\n                                  MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                    (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                        105\n\n\n 1   was filed on January the 16th, 2017.\n\n 2        Q.      Okay.   So am my correct in understanding you\n\n 3   didn't bring the sanctionable nature of this conduct, alleged\n\n 4   sanctionable nature of this conduct to their attention after\n\n 5   any of these pleadings until there was a final judgment in\n\n 6   this case?\n\n </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span>        <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>      <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> would -- I'm going to parse your statement.     I\n\n 8   mean, a final judgment, I think it -- I will agree with you\n\n 9   that it was not until after the summary judgment in this case.\n\n10   Whether that judgment was final or not I think somewhat relies\n\n11   on the outcome of this proceeding so --\n\n12        Q.      Okay.   Fair enough.    What you're saying is -- if\n\n13   I'm understanding you is you did not bring alleged\n\n14   sanctionable conduct to the attention of this Court or to my\n\n15   clients after any of these many documents were filed prior to\n\n16   the summary judgment having been signed by this Court?\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span>        <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>      <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> will agree with that statement.\n\n18                MR. RUBACK:     Thank you, sir.\n\n19                No more questions, Your Honor.\n\n20                THE COURT:    Anything further?\n\n21                Next witness?\n\n22                MR. THOMPSON:     Call Aaron Boone, Your Honor.\n\n23                THE COURT:    You can testify from there.\n\n24                MR. BOONE:    I'll do it.\n\n25                THE COURT:    Okay.\n\n\n                               MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                 (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                          106\n\n\n     1                               AARON BOONE,\n\n 2       was called as a witness by the Movant having been first duly\n\n 3       sworn, testified as follows:\n\n 4\n\n 5                                DIRECT EXAMINATION\n\n 6       BY MR. BOONE:\n\n 7                   Afternoon, Judge.     First off, thank you for the\n\n 8       courtesy of allowing me to appear before this Court.     My name\n\n 9       is Aaron Boone.   I'm with the law firm of Bowls Rice, LLP.\n\n10       Our main office is in Charleston, West Virginia.     My office is\n\n11       in Parkersburg, West Virginia.     I graduated William Mary\n\n12       undergrad law school at West Virginia University.     Been\n\n13       practicing since 2004.\n\n14                   I was contacted by a partner in my office who is\n\n15       an estate attorney, and he had been contacted by an estate\n\n16       lawyer in Florida for Connie Barry.     Connie Barry is one of\n\n17       the heirs at law that has been -- that had been identified in\n\n18       the complaint filed by the trustee in West Virginia.\n\n19                   My office was hired to defend Connie Barry's\n\n20       interests in West Virginia.     In doing so it became apparent\n\n21       that we needed to reach out to counsel in west -- in Texas,\n\n22       Austin, Texas in order to address the claims that Mateo Cortez\n\n23       had raised, including claims that he should have jurisdiction\n\n24       over the heirs at law, etcetera.\n\n25                   So my time has been spent not only defending the\n\n\n                                  MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                    (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                           107\n\n\n     1   efforts in West Virginia, the efforts of Mateo to convince the\n\n 2       West Virginia Court that he's entitled, but it's also been to\n\n 3       assist counsel here in Texas with defending the needs of the\n\n 4       heirs at law.\n\n 5                      Connie Barry is my only client but her interests\n\n 6       are aligned with the other heirs at law, therefore the work\n\n 7       I've done has been I think beneficial to all of them.     I'm the\n\n 8       one that facilitated the meetings, the agreements and just\n\n 9       kind of helped keep the wheels greased, you could say.\n\n10                      In preparation of today's motion for sanctions I\n\n11       have gone through all of my bills.     I have -- I have pulled\n\n12       out any entry that was clearly related to West Virginia.\n\n13       Okay?     To the extent there was an entry that was me talking\n\n14       about the West Virginia status and the Texas status I would\n\n15       just half that time, okay?\n\n16                      And so what I have for the Court's review are two\n\n17       statements.     The first -- the first statement is for activity\n\n18       beginning at the inception of my assistance which was on or\n\n19       about December 23rd, 2015, close to the time when that\n\n20       West Virginia action was filed, through January 27th of 2017.\n\n21       Those fees totaled $45,706.99.    As counsel mentioned my rate\n\n22       is 275.    I believe that is reasonable for my services knowing\n\n23       West Virginia but also to the extent they've been helpful here\n\n24       in this Court as well.\n\n25                      I have also prepared a statement for essentially\n\n\n                                  MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                    (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                        108\n\n\n 1   the time that we spent working this case in Texas, even after\n\n 2   Judge Waters entered very detailed findings of fact explaining\n\n 3   why Mateo should not be entitled to take under the trust.\n\n 4   Certainly at that point there was a very well reasoned\n\n 5   decision explaining why Mateo really should stop his claims.\n\n 6   And so I prepared a statement showing my fees from that moment\n\n 7   to January 27th, 2017 and that amount is $33,915.74.\n\n 8                 I had estimated my time since Friday through today\n\n 9   including the travel.       And that estimate, Judge, is $8,494.34.\n\n10   I'll mark that as Exhibit 8.\n\n11                 May I approach, Judge?\n\n12                 THE COURT:     Y0u may, sir.\n\n13                 MR. BOONE:     Judge, Mr. Thompson did a tally for\n\n14   you so I'll do the same.       If this Court is inclined to\n\n15   award -- award all the time from inception including the\n\n16   estimated time for this motion for sanctions, that comes up to\n\n17   $54,201.33.    Should the Court look instead to the time spent\n\n18   after the motion for summary judgment was vindicated in\n\n19   West Virginia that amount is $42,410.08.\n\n20                 Judge, at this time unless there is a question\n\n21   about those exhibits I'd move for those admissions.\n\n22                 (Movant's Exhibit Nos. 6, 7 and 8\n\n23                 were offered into evidence.)\n\n24                 THE COURT:    Any objection to 6, 7 and 8?\n\n25                 MR. ROBACK:    No objections, Your Honor.\n\n\n                                MELISSA VOIGT, CSR\n                                  (512) 854-9258\n\f                                                                           109\n\n\n     1               THE COURT:     6,   7 and 8 are admitted.\n\n 2                    (Movant's Exhibit Nos. 6, 7 and 8\n\n 3                   were admitted into evidence.)\n\n 4                   THE COURT:     And the last number you read out was\n\n 5       42,000 or 43,000 -- that is a combination of 7 and 8?\n\n 6                   MR. BOONE:     Yes, sir.\n\n 7                   THE COURT:     Thank you.\n\n 8                   Anything further?\n\n 9                   MR.

Mr. Boone, when did you first advise my clients\n\n15       that you believed their conduct was sanctionable?\n\n1</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span>            <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>     <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> think when we had a hearing -- I think it was\n\n17       back in February or March there was a room full of heirs at\n\n18       law in West Virginia, and there was Judge Waters, there was\n\n19       myself, there was several other attorneys.      And I -- I believe\n\n20       the discussion about the claims raised by Mateo Cortez, the\n\n21       discussion how they were without any merit at all should have\n\n22       given notice to the Brotherton Law Firm that these claims\n\n23       should not have been continued.\n\n24            Q.

Smith, Patricia Chapman, Betty J. Marks\n\nWebb, James Berl Marks, Linda Murray, Thomas Wayne Marks, Donald Leman Whited,\n\nMichael Ray Whited, Terry Lee Whited and Sherry Lynn Whited Salsbury (collectively \"Third\n\nParty Defendants\"). Having considered the Motion, the response thereto, the admissible\n\nevidence, the other papers on file in this matter, and the arguments of counsel, the Court hereby\n\nGRANTS the Motion in part and makes the following findings and orders:\n\n       The Court finds that attorney William J. Brotherton violated Texas Civil Practices and\n\nRemedies Code Chapter IO in signing the Original Petition in Intervention, the First Amended\n\n                                                I\n                                                              EXHIBIT\n                                                                  G\n\f                                       No. C-1-PB-16-002348\n\n\n Petition in Intervention and Third Party Petition, Second Amended Petition in Intervention and\n\n Third Party Petition, the Third Amended Petition in Intervention and Third Party Petition, and\n\nthe Fourth Petition in Intervention filed in this matter. In particular, the Court finds that Mr.\n\nBrotherton violated Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code § 10.001 by signing these\n\npleadings because each of them contained the claim that Deborah Cortez was entitled to all\n\nassets from The William D. Short and Phyllis D. Short Revocable Living Trust (the ''Trust\")\n\nupon the death of Phyllis Short because Deborah was over the age of 35 when Ms. Short died.\n\nThe Court finds that the plain language of the Trust foreclosed such a claim and that this claim\n\nwas not warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for the extension, modification,\n\nor reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.\n\n       The Court further finds that attorney William J. Brotherton should have known that as of\n\nSeptember 16, 2016, his legal position regarding postponement of the trust was untenable. By\n\nmaintaining that legal position in his Fourth Petition in Intervention, he caused the Third Party\n\nDefendants to incur additional attorneys' fees in responding to attorney William J. Brotherton's\n\nclaim regarding postponement of the trust.\n\n       The Court hereby sanctions William J. Brotherton and the Brotherton Law Firm, jointly\n\nand severally, in the amount of $31,150.76 for fees incurred for work done by Brian Thompson\n\nand his associates at Hopper Mikeska, PLLC and $33,980.00 for fees incurred by Aaron Boone\n\nand his associate attorney at Bowles Rice, LLP, for a total of$65,130.76. The Court orders that\n\nthis amount be paid to the Third Party Defendants within 30 days of the entry of this order. The\n\nCourt finds that there is a direct relationship between the sanctions being imposed and Mr.\n\nBrotherton's sanctionable conduct, in that the aforesaid amount represents reasonable and\n\nnecessary attorneys' fees expended by attorneys for the Third Part Defendants to defend against\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f                                     No. C-1-PB-16-002348\n\n\nthe frivolous claims advanced by William J. Brotherton and the Brotherton Law Finn; that the\n\nsanctions are not excessive; and that these sanctions will appropriately deter other attorneys from\n\nsigning pleadings containing claims that violate Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code\n\nChapter 10.\n\n       The Court hereby modifies its judgment entered on December 19, 2016, to include this\n\naward of sanctions.\n\n       Signed this 10th day of February, 2017.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f                                 CAUSE NO.

The Motion to Modify was hearJ by the Court at a hearing on\n\nJanuary 30, 2017.

This decision comes on the heels of Judge Herman's January 30, 2017, refusal to\n  reconsider his December 19, 2016, order granting judgment as a matter of law against your client,\n  and follows Judge Robert A. Waters's September 9, 2015, order concluding that neither Mateo\n  Cortez nor the Estate of Deborah Cortez is entitled to share in the trust:\n\n                     Because Deborah was over the age of 35 when Mrs. Short died,\n                     Cortez believes that the Trust should have immediately terminated\n                     and the entirety of the Trust assets distributed to Deborah, which\n                     Cortez would have then inherited from Deborah upon her death. . ..\n                     The Court cannot, and does not, accept Mateo Cmtez's reading of the\n                     Trust, which would nullify the provisions of Article VIII, Sections A-\n                     C.\n\n                                                               EXHIBIT\n                                                                    H\n\f                                                  41\\ Bowles Rice,,.\n William J. Brotherton, Esquire\n February 23,2017\n Page 2\n\n\n (Order, 09-09-2015, Circuit Court of Wood County). In sum, cornts in both Texas and West\n Virginia have now entered orders finding that neither the Estate of Deborah Cortez nor your client,\n Mateo Cortez, qualify as an heir-at-law entitled to take in the trust assets (\"Trust Assets\").\n\n                 Nevertheless, despite these losses, your client continues to pursue civil litigation\nbefore the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, in Charleston,\nWest Virginia, and an appeal before the Third Court of Appeals, in Austin, Texas. Undoubtedly,\nfurther litigation will cost my client, and the other heirs-at-law, significant legal fees. The purpose\nof this letter to demand that Mateo Cortez and/or the Estate of Deborah Cortez immediately\nwithdraw any and all claims to the Trust Assets.\n\n               As you may recall, at the January 30, 2017, hearing, your counsel argued,\nunsuccessfully, that sanctions should not be awru·ded against you, in part, because I never explicitly\nwarned you that I would file a motion for sru1ctions if you continued to pursue ·such claims.\nAlthough I (and apparently Judge Herman) disagree that a warning is necessary, I wish to now\nmake clear that if you and/or your client, Mateo Cortez (either personally or as representative of tile\nEstate of Deborah Cortez) do not immediately withdraw any and all claims to the Trust Assets, then\nI will take appropriate action to: (a) seek additional sanctions against your firm and (b) seek\nsanctions against Mr. Mateo Cortez personally. 1\n\n               1 recognize that Mateo Cortez ru1d the Trust have pending claims against one\nanother, including claims relating to proceeds from an asbestos settlement (\"Asbestos Claims\").\nNevertheless, there is no reason for Mr. Cortez, while resolving the Asbestos Claims, to continue to\npursue the meritless claim that he and/or the Estate of Deborah Cortez is entitled to the Trust\nAssets. Accordingly, I demand that yo1.1 immediately enter appropriate orders dismissing such\nclaims in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia and in the Third\nCourt of Appeals, in Austin, Texas, If you would like for me to prepru·e proposed dismissal orders,\nthen I would be happy to do so.\n\n               Finally, as you know, Judge Herman ordered you to pay the total sum of $65,130.76\nwithin thirty (30) days of his February 10, 201 7, order. Kindly submit $31,150.76 to I-lopper\n\n         1\n           Please remember that my client's Motion for Attorney Fees and Costs is pending before the United States\nDistrict Court of the Southern District of West Virginia, (Document No. 7). Additionally, please note that Rule 45 of\nthe Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure states:\n                 Rule 45: Damages for Frivolous Appeals in Civil Cases: If the court of appeals\n                 detennines that an appeal is frivolous, it may--on motion of any party or on its own\n                 initiative, after notice and a reasonable opportunity for response--award each\n                 prevailing party just damages. ln detennining whether to award damages, the court\n                 must not consider any matter that does not appear in the record, briefs, or other\n                 papers filed in tl1e court of appeals\n\nTex.

Short and Phyllis D. Short Revocable Living Trust including the Credit\n       Shelter Trust Created Therein v. Mateo Cortez and Wells Fargo Bank, NA.\n\n       Civil Action No. 2:16-cv-09951; Linda Murray v. Linda Lou Murray, et al.\n\n       Cause No. C-l-PB-16-002348; Cortez v. Brown et al.\n\nDear Mr. Boone:\n\n       We are in receipt of your letter dated February 23, 2017, in which your clients make\nthe demand that our client withdraws all of his claims to the Trust or your client will file\nadditional sanctions. We now respond to such demand.\n\n        First, the orders that your clients reference are not final orders. We completely\ndisagree with both orders as both orders are riddled with errors and inaccuracies. We stand\nfirm that the plain and clear language of the Trust entitled Deborah Cortez to receive all\nfunds of the Trust during her lifetime; therefore, a claim from the Estate was filed. Until\nrecently, there seemed to be some confusion regarding your clients' understanding of our\nclaims, which is reflected in both summary judgment motions and orders in the two Courts.\nWe do not believe either of the summary judgments will stand on appeal.\n\n        Second, our client will not simply waive the right to an appeal on such erroneous\nrulings. We will be taking the appropriate steps to proceed with correcting the errors in the\ntrial court; however, we are prepared to appeal if the trial court refuses to correct the errors.\nSince you, your clients, and Mr. Thompson have made this personal, you have left us with no\nchoice but to appeal the excessive and baseless sanctions order. We clearly met our burden\n\n\n\n                                           EXHIBIT\n                                                I\n\f Aaron C. Boone\n March 1, 2017\n Page 2\n\n\nregarding the sanctions, but it has been made clear by Mr. Thompson that he uses sanctions\nas a tactic in litigation and has been allowed to do so in the Travis County Courts. We\nbelieve that this tactic is a threat to all lawyers who practice in good faith in Texas and that it\nis a serious violation of public policy. It will absolutely be appealed.\n\n        Third, your letter seems to indicate that you want us to enter orders dismissing claims\nin the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia as well. We\nhave no claims in West Virginia. A review of the Court's record would clearly demonstrate\nthat Linda Murray filed that suit - just as she initiated the Texas litigation. However, if you\nwould like to do a joint dismissal in West Virginia and adhere to the Texas Courts'\njurisdiction, we would be happy to consider such. Please feel free to draft the agreed\ndismissal for our review.\n\n      Lastly, as stated above, we will be proceeding forward. At such time that the orders\nbecome final, we will be superseding the judgment during the appeal.\n\n\n\n\nWJB/ab\n\ncc:      Brian Thompson (via email: bthompson@hoppermikeska.com)\n         James W.

The plain language of the Trust instrnment makes no provision for your client. Your\nclient has no claim to the Trust, either in his personal capacity or as representative of \"the Estate of\nDeborah Coitez.\" Your client's claims to the contrary lack any basis in the Trust instrument or\nsupport under the law, and have already been sanctioned in Texas. Unless your client withdraws his\nfrivolous pleadings, my client will seek the same sanctions in West Virginia.\n\n                The Circuit Court of Wirt County, West Virginia granted summary judgment against\nyour client on September 15, 2016. The Probate Court of Travis County, Texas followed suit on\nDecember I 9, 2016. Both courts rejected your client's claims, and pursuant lo the patties' Rule 11\nAgreement you are bound to abide by those rulings. Nonetheless, you continue to file :frivolous\npleadings in West Virginia, with the admitted purpose of obstructing the Court's resolution of the\nTrustee's motion for summary judgment. Moreover, it is clear that your client is intentionally driving\nup the cost of this litigation to retaliate against the Trnstee and the Trust's rightful beneficiaries.\n\n                The course of action you are pursuing in West Virginia has already been found by the\nTexas court to be frivolous as a matter of law. Moreover, there is sufficient evidence to make a\ncompelling case to the Court that your client's continued pursuit of this matter is being conducted in\nbad faith. If your client is unwilling to do the right thing and dismiss his frivolous claims to the Trust,\nthen my client has authorized me to aggressively pursue sanctions against you for facilitating his\nwrongful conduct.\n\n                This matter is set for heai-ing tomorrow in the Circuit Court of Wirt County, West\nVirginia. I strongly urge your client to immediately cease his frivolous and futile pursuit of the Trust,\nand to dismiss his claims with prejudice at tomo1Tow' s hearing.\n\n                                                        Sincerely,\n\n                                              ~- <!.             ;3o~\n                                                       Aaron C.

As it relates to the first prong under Rule 59(e), \"intervening change in\n\n controlling law\", Defendant Cortez identifies no intervening change in controlling law in either\n\n his Motion to Alter filed on September 29, 2016, or his oral arguments presented on June 27, 2017.\n\n As such, this Court CONCLUDES that it cannot alter or modify the subject Order based upon any\n\n alleged intervening change in law.\n\n\n                                   Second Prong under Rule 59(e)\n                               Mateo Cortez Identifies No New Evidence\n\n                   15.    As it relates to the second prong under Rule 59(e), \"new evidence\",\n\nDefendant Cortez identifies no new evidence in either his Motion to Alter or his oral arguments;\n\nas such, this Court CONCLUDES that it cannot alter or modify the subject Order based upon this\n\nprovision under Rule 59(e).\n\n\n                                    Third Prong under Rule 59(e)\n           Mateo Cortez Fails to Demonstrate this Court Committed Any Clear Error of Law\n\n                  16.    As it relates to the third prong under Rule 59(e), \"clear error oflaw\", Mateo\n\nCortez proffers several arguments to suggest that this Court committed clear error. First, Mateo\n\nCortez argues that this Court improperly refused to dismiss and/or abstain from adjudicating the\n\nComplaint. Second, Mateo Cortez argues this Court incorrectly concluded that Mateo Cortez\n\nand/or the Estate of Deborah Cortez is not a beneficiary under the Trust.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\f              17.     As it relates to the first alleged \"clear error\", namely refusal to dismiss\n\nand/or abstain, this Court CONCLUDES that this argument fails for several reasons:\n\n\n                      a.      First, the issue of whether this Court must abstain and/or defer to\n\n              Texas has been fully vetted by both this Court and the Supreme Court of Appeals\n\n              of West Virginia. Nothing presented by Mateo Cortez has persuaded this Court to\n\n              veer from its earlier determination (and/or from the Supreme Court of Appeals of\n\n              West Virginia's ruling), that the Circuit Court of Wirt County is permitted to\n\n              address the issues presented in the Complaint, including, but not limited to, the\n\n              critical issue of who does and does not qualify as a beneficiary under the Trust.\n\n\n                      b.      Second, in further support of Mateo Cortez's argument that this\n\n              Court has committed clear error in refusing to defer to Texas, Mateo Cortez argues\n\n              that circumstances have changed, ameliorating in favor of Texas now serving as the\n\n              sole arbiter.\n\n\n                              1.    Specifically, Mateo Cortez argues that, when this Court\n\n                      decided on March 16, 2016, to retain sole jurisdiction over this Complaint,\n\n                      this Court did so because Texas did not have jurisdiction over the numerous\n\n                      individuals identified in the Complaint. Mateo Cortez further argues that,\n\n                      subsequent to this Court's March 16, 2016, Order denying Mateo's Motion\n\n                      to Dismiss per Rule 12(b), and subsequent to this Court's September 15,\n\n                      2016 Order granting Connie Barry's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment,\n\n                      the Probate Court of Travis County, Texas, acquired jurisdiction over the\n\n                      heirs-at-law; as such, Mateo Cortez reasons, this Court should rescind its\n\n\n\n                                               5\n\fprior order granting summary judgment in favor of Connie Barry, dismiss\n\nand/or stay this action, and let the Probate Court of Travis County, Texas,\n\nhandle this case.\n\n\n         11.    However, this Court notes that, although the Probate Court\n\nof Travis County, Texas, did, for a period of time, obtain jurisdiction over\n\nmany of the individuals identified in the Complaint, the Probate Court's\n\nplenary power in that action has now expired, meaning it no longer has\n\njurisdiction over said individuals.\n\n\n        111.   Regardless, the decision of this Court to retain jurisdiction\n\nwas never solely predicated on whether the Probate County Court of Travis\n\nCounty, Texas, had jurisdiction over all the individuals identified the\n\nComplaint. Rather, this Court retained jurisdiction due to multiple factors\n\nthat weighed in favor of retaining jurisdiction and that continue to weigh in\n\nfavor of maintaining jurisdiction; those factors include, but are not limited\n\nto:\n\n\n               a)      West Virginia has jurisdiction over the real property\n\n        interests contained in the Trust.\n\n\n               b)      While it might be less convenient for Defendant\n\n        Cortez to proceed in West Virginia, it does not work a substantial\n\n        injustice to him to require him to adjudicate the distribution of the\n\n        Trust Assets where the majority of the potential beneficiaries reside\n\n\n\n\n                          6\n\f                 and where the Trust is actually administered, as required by the\n\n                 Trust instruments themselves.\n\n\n                        c)      The fact that the Trustee filed a tort action in Texas\n\n                 to stop misappropriation of the Trust Assets does not mean that the\n\n                 Trustee specifically availed herself of a Texas forum for any aspect\n\n                 of the Trust's administration.\n\n\n                        d)      Plaintiff Linda Murray is a resident of West Virginia,\n\n                 and administers the Trust from West Virginia. The situs of the\n\n                 Trust is located in West Virginia.\n\n\n                       e)      The fact that the Estates of William and Phyllis Short\n\n                 were probated in Texas, or that the Estate of Deborah Cortez is\n\n                located in Texas, is entirely irrelevant because the Trust is not part\n\n                of any of those Estates.\n\n\n        c.     Finally, although not dispositive, another reason to support this\n\nCourt's conclusion that no \"clear error\" has been made with respect to its decision\n\nto retain jurisdiction, this Court recognizes that its distinguished peer in Texas, the\n\nHon. Guy Herman, Judge, chose not to preclude, interrupt, or even object to West\n\nVirginia handling this case. At a December 18, 2015, hearing in the Probate Court\n\nof Travis County, Texas, which occurred over a month after the Trustee initiated\n\nthis action on November 20, 2015, the following verbal exchange occurred between\n\nJudge Herman and Counsel:\n\n\n\n\n                                  7\n\f               THE COURT: I'm not going to prohibit them from proceeding, I'm\n               not going order (sic) them to dismiss in West Virginia. You all can\n               go to West Virginia and argue.\n\n               MR. BROTHERTON: The problem is of course, Your Honor, is\n               our guy has limited funds and -\n\n               THE COURT: But he's got good lawyers, so - who are looking at\n               an opportunity if you're right of getting five million dollars.\n\n               MR. COHEN: Yeah.\n\n               THE COURT: I'm sure that you can ---\n\n               MR. COHEN: Should have signed a contingent fee.\n\n               THE COURT: --- make your way to West Virginia.\n\n(Exhibit C to Defendant's Response, Transcript of hearing of December 17, 2015, the Honorable\nGuy Herman, Judge, Travis County Probate Court, Travis County, Texas, Trial Court Cause No.\nC-1-PB-14-001564.)\n\n               18.    As it relates to the second alleged \"clear error\", namely that this Court\n\nincorrectly concluded that neither Mateo Cortez nor the Estate of Deborah Cortez are beneficiaries\n\nof the Trust, this Court CONCLUDES that this argument fails for several reasons:\n\n\n                      a.      At the outset, it is important to note that Mateo Cortez has proffered\n\n               multiple theories (at different stages in this case) in support of his singular claim\n\n              that he, as the sole heir to the Estate of his deceased-spouse Deborah Cortez, is the\n\n              sole beneficiary of the assets of the Trust.\n\n\n                               I.     First Theory:   In his May 9, 2016, Response to Connie\n\n                      Barry's Motion for Summary Judgment, Mateo Cortez argues that the\n\n                      \"Postponement of Possession,\" \"Termination\" paragraph under Article\n\n                      VIII, Section D, Subsection 2 supports his claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                                8\n\f                               ll.    Second Theory:      In his September 29, 2016, Motion to\n\n                      Amend or Alter, he argues that the \"Alternate Distribution\" paragraph under\n\n                      Article VIII, Section C supports his claim.\n\n\n                               m.     Third Theory:     During the June 27, 2017, hearing, he\n\n                      indicated he intends to argue (before the Probate Court of Travis County,\n\n                      Texas) that the \"Specific Distribution,\" \"Cash Distribution to Deborah\"\n\n                      paragraph under Article VIII, Section A, Subsection 2 supports his claim.\n\n\n                      b.      Furthermore, it is important to note that no one disputes that the\n\n              subject Trust is the legitimate, applicable, and controlling document expressing the\n\n              settlors' intent with respect to the Trust Assets. Additionally, there is no dispute\n\n              that, at all times pertinent, the Trust has been known to Mateo Cortez and his\n\n              counsel. Finally, there is no dispute that the Trust is unambiguous:\n\n\n              Defendant Barry is correct in that Mr. Cortez is not an heir at law\n              and correct in that the Trust expresses the true intent of the parties\n              and unambiguous language. Defendant Barry is incorrect, however,\n              in deducing what the meaning of the plain and unambiguous\n              language is.\n\n(Defendant Mateo Cortez's Response to Defendant Connie Lou Keith Barry's Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, p. 7.)\n\n              As such, this Court sees no reason why Mateo Cortez could not have proffered any\n\n              and all theories to support his singular claim prior to entry of this Court's decision\n\n              to grant partial summary judgment in favor of Connie Barry and against Mateo\n\n              Cortez on September 15~ 2016.\n\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\f       a.       Notwithstanding, this Court CONCLUDES that no theory expressed\n\nby Mateo Cortez could support his singular claim that he, as the sole heir to the\n\nEstate of his deceased-spouse Deborah Cortez, is the sole beneficiary of the assets\n\nof the Trust:\n\n\n                1.     As it relates to Mateo Cortez's first theory, this Court has\n\n       already explained why the \"Postponement of Possession,\" \"Termination\"\n\n       provision of the Trust does not support Mateo Cortez's claim. (Order\n\n       Granting Partial Summary Judgment, p. 8). In his Motion to Amend or\n\n       Alter, Mateo Cortez proffers no argument as to why this Court's decision\n\n       regarding the Postponement Provision qualifies as clear error.\n\n\n                11.   As it relates to Mateo Cortez's second theory, this Court\n\n       adopts the rationale espoused in the response of Connie Barry, namely that\n\n       the determination of who qualifies as an \"heir-at-law\", within the \"Alternate\n\n       Distribution\" paragraph under Article VIII, Section C, inherently includes\n\n       only those then-living at the time of the Deborah Cortez's death.\n\n       Accordingly, neither Mateo Cortez, nor the Estate of Deborah Cortez\n\n       qualify, as an heir-at-law within the \"Alternate Distribution\" paragraph\n\n       under Article VIII, Section C. To conclude otherwise would render the\n\n       Trust nonsensical and would run contrary to the clear intent of the settlors.\n\n       Moreover, Mateo Cortez admitted in his response to the motion for\n\n       summary judgment that he was not an heir at law of either settlor.\n\n\n\n\n                                10\n\f                                      111.    Additionally, although not dispositive, this Court recognizes\n\n                            that not only has it concluded that neither Mateo Cortez nor the Estate of\n\n                            Deborah Cortez are beneficiaries under the trust, but the Texas Court has\n\n                            also concluded that neither Cortez nor the Estate of Deborah Cortez are\n\n                            beneficiaries:\n\n\n                   It is therefore, ORDERED, that Mateo Cortez's claims against Third\n                   Party Defendants in this lawsuit are dismissed in their entirety. In\n                   particular, the Court hereby dismisses any and all claims that\n                   Mateo Cortez, in his individual capacity or in his capacity as\n                   personal representative ofthe Estate ofDeborah Cortez, has to any\n                   assets of The William D. Short and Phyllis D. Short Revocable\n                   Living Trust (the \"Trust\"), other than his claim for undistributed\n                   income from the Trust during the life of Deborah Cortez.\n\n(Exhibit B, Order Granting Third Party Defendants' Traditional and No Evidence Motion for\nSummary Judgment, Civil Action No. C-1-OB-14-1564 (Tex. Probate Ct. Dec. 19, 2016)\n(emphasis added). 2\n\n                                     1v.     Finally, as it relates to Mateo Cortez's third theory, this\n\n                           Court finds that regardless of whatever new and/or novel theory Mateo\n\n                           Cortez would seek to proffer, this Court has already determined, and today\n\n                           reaffirms, its conclusion that the Trust is unambiguous and clearly expresses\n\n                           the intent of the settlers that, upon the death of Deborah Short, the Trustee\n\n                           should distribute 1/2 of the remaining Trust Assets to the then-living heirs\n\n                           of William D. Short and 1/2 to then-living heirs of Phyllis D. Short.\n\n\n\n\n         2 The Texas court subsequently amended its judgment to include monetary sanctions against Mateo Cortez's\nattorneys, finding that the arguments which Mateo Cortez advanced in Texas were frivolous and were not warranted\nby existing law; the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law; or the establishment of new law. The Texas\ncourt sanctioned Mateo Cortez's attorneys in the amount of $65,130.76 for driving up Defendant Barry's legal fees in\nTexas with frivolous claims.\n\n\n                                                         11\n\f                                Fourth Prong under Rule 59(e)\n                             Mateo Cortez fails to demonstrate that\n       \"Manifest Injustice\" would occur if this Court denies his Motion to Amend or Alter\n\n                19.    Lastly, in his motion, Mateo Cortez suggests that manifest injustice would\n\noccur in denying his Motion to Amend, in part, because the Estate of Deborah Cortez is not a party\n\nto the lawsuit. Mateo Cortez failed to present this argument prior to judgment and therefore waived\n\nit. See W.Va. R. Civ. P. 12(h) (defenses other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction are waived\n\nunless raised prior to judgment). The Court also notes its prior rulings that the Estate of Deborah\n\nCortez has no interest in the Trust or the Trust assets, and therefore is neither necessary nor\n\nindispensable to this action.\n\n\n               20.     Moreover, this Court finds that the applicant was adequately represented by\n\nMateo Cortez, who is the administrator and sole heir of the Estate of Deborah Cortez.\n\n\n                       a.       As to adequacy of representation by existing parties, \"generally\n\n               courts compare the interests asserted by the proposed intervenor with the interests\n\n               of the existing party. If the proposed intervenor's interest is not represented by the\n\n               existing party, or the existing party's interests are adverse to those of the proposed\n\n               intervenor, intervention should be granted .... [However], if the interests are\n\n               identical, intervention should be denied unless there is a compelling showing as to\n\n               why the existing representation is inadequate.\" State ex rel.

Cummings, 208\n\n               W.Va. 393,403,</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">917</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 927 (1999) (internal citations omitted).\n\n\n                       b.       Mateo Cortez, in both his personal capacity and in his capacity as\n\n               the Personal Representative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez, have identical\n\n               interests in this action: both seek an order directing that all the assets of the Trust\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\f                 be distributed to Mateo Cortez, either through direct distribution to Mateo Cortez\n\n                 personally or indirectly through distribution to the Estate of Deborah Cortez, which\n\n                then flows through to Mateo Cortez personally as its sole heir. This identity of\n\n                interest is clear from the undisputed fact that Mateo Cortez controls every decision\n\n                made on behalf of the Estate of Deborah Cortez, and is the only heir and beneficiary\n\n                of the estate.\n\n\n                        c.       Additionally, Mateo Cortez's attorneys represent him in both his\n\n                individual capacity and in his capacity as the Personal Representative of the Estate\n\n                of Deborah Cortez, which would violate the West Virginia Rules of Professional\n\n                Conduct if their interests were adverse in any way. See W.Va. R. Prof. Conduct§\n\n                1.7 (simultaneous representation of adverse parties in litigation is a non-waivable\n\n                conflict of interest).\n\n\n                21.     Accordingly, this Court CONCLUDES that manifest injustice would NOT\n\noccur by denying the Motion to Amend because (as Mateo Cortez argues), the Estate of Deborah\n\nCortez is not a party to this action.\n\n\n                                               Ruling\n\n                For the reasons set forth above, and as stated more fully upon the record, this Court\n\nDENIES the motion to amend or alter filed by Mateo Cortez.\n\n\n                The Court notes that Defendant Connie Lou Keith Barry has filed a motion for\n\nsanctions against Mateo Cortez, in either his personal capacity or in his capacity as the Personal\n\nRepresentative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez, and his attorneys.

After considering the Motion, the response of defendant\n\nConnie Barry, the response of the Trustee, the arguments of counsel, and the record, this Court\n\nhereby DENIES the Motion for the reasons stated on the record and more fully below.\n\n\n                                       Procedural Posture\n\n                1.      On June 12, 2017, Defendant Mateo Cortez filed Defendant Mateo Cortez's\n\nMotion to Dismiss and Memorandum of Law in Support Thereof (the \"Motion\"), requesting that\n\nthe Court dismiss this action pursuant to Rule 12(6) of the West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nMateo Cortez argues that this action should be dismissed because lhere is a previously-filed action\n\npending in Texas on the same subject matter between the same parties, and as a result the Texas\n\ncourt has exclusive jurisdiction.\n\n\n                2.      On June 22, 2017, Plaintiff Linda Murray, in her capacity as Successor\n\nTrustee of the Trust (the \"Trustee\"), filed a response in opposition to the Motion. On June 23,\n\n   FILED\nCircuit Court\nDate   Q-/tl-17\n     CLERK   if_\n\f2017, Defendant Connie Lou Keith Barry (\"Barry\"), liled u response in opposition to the Motion\n\nand a request for sanctions. On June 27, 2017, the Court conducted a hearing on the Motion and\n\nother matters. The Court has reviewed the Motion, supporting memorandum and exhibits, the\n\nTrustee and Barry's responses and supporting exhibits, the Trust instrument, and entertained the\n\narguments of the parties. The Court has also reviewed the entire record in this matter as part of its\n\nconsideration of this Motion and the other matters pending before it.\n\n\n                            Findings of Fact & Conclusions of Law\n\n               3.      This action involves the proper distribution of the assets of the \"William D.\n\nShort and Phyllis D. Short Revocable Living Family Trust Dated April 30, 1991,\" as amended and\n\nrestated by the \"Second Amendment and Restatement of The William D. Short and Phyllis D.\n\nShort Revocable Living Trust\" dated January 5, 2000 (collectively, the \"Trust\").\n\n\n               4.     This Court recognizes that, prior to instituting this action in Wirt County,\n\nWest Virginia, the Trustee asserted a claim in Texas.\n\n\n                      a.      On August 28, 2014, the Trustee filed an action against Mateo\n\n              Cortez in the Probate Court of Travis County, Texas, alleging that Mateo Cortez\n\n              conspired to misappropriate funds from the Trust.\n\n\n                      b.      On June 30, 2015, Mateo Cortez filed a petition in intervention\n\n              within the Trustee's misappropriation action in Texas, seeking a declaratory\n\n              judgment that Deborah Cortez was entitled to all of the Trust assets during her life,\n\n              and an order directing the Trustee to distribute the remaining Trust assets to the\n\n              Estate of Deborah Cortez.\n\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\f                          c.     On November 16, 2015, the Trustee filed a motion for summary\n\n                judgment in Texas, arguing that Mateo Cortez filed his petition in intervention\n\n                solely to avoid liability on the Trustee's misappropriation claim.\n\n\n                5.        On November 20, 2015, the Trustee filed this action in the Circuit Court of\n\n Wirt County, West Virginia, to obtain \"an order directing the distribution of the assets of the Trust\n\nto those persons determined by this Court to be entitled to receive the same in such proportions as\n\nmay be determined by this Court to be proper and in conformity with the intent of the settlors of\n\nthe Trust.\" The Trustee joined and served numerous defendants, including Mateo Cortez. The\n\nTrustee joined and served Mateo Cortez as a defendant because he \"claims that as the surviving\n\nspouse of Deborah Ann (Short) Cortez he is entitled to the trust proceeds. His claim is without\n\nlegal merit; nevertheless, in order that he may appear and protect his interest, if any, he is named\n\nas a defendant herein.\"\n\n\n               6.      On December 18, 2015, the Texas court held a hearing on a temporary\n\nrestraining order and request for injunctive relief filed by Mateo Cortez. As part of his request for\n\nrelief, Mateo Cortez sought an order from the Texas court enjoining the Trustee from proceeding\n\nany further in West Virginia and requiring her to dismiss this action. The Texas court refused to\n\ninterfere with the Trustee's claims in this court: \"THE COURT: I'm not going to prohibit them\n\nfrom proceeding, I'm not going to order them to dismiss in West Virginia. You all can go to West\n\nVirginia and argue.\"\n\n\n               7.      On December 28, 2015 Mateo Cortez filed a Rule 12(b) motion to dismiss\n\nthis action pursuant to the doctrine of forum non conveniens, arguing that this action should be\n\ndismissed because the Trustee's claims were currently being litigated in Texas.\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\f                        a.      In his motion, Mateo Cortez stated that he was seeking to administer\n\n                the Estate of Deborah Cortez in Texas, and stated that \"Mr. Cotiez filed an Original\n\n                Petition in intervention that seeks a declaratory judgment regarding the distribution\n\n                of the Trust to Mateo Cortez, the sole heir of the Estate of his late wife, Deborah\n\n                Cortez.\"\n\n\n                       b.      As an exhibit to his motion, Mateo Cortez attached a copy of his\n\n                pleading in Texas, which did not request that the court determine the proper\n\n               beneficiaries of the Trust in the event his declaratory claim failed.\n\n\n               8.      On March 16, 2016, this Court denied Mateo Cortez's motion to dismiss.\n\nOn June 14, 2016, the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia refused Mateo Cortez's petition\n\nfor an extraordinary writ prohibiting this Court from enforcing its order.\n\n\n               9.      On September 15, 2016, this Court granted Defendant Barry's motion for\n\npartial summary judgment, and dismissed Mateo Cortez as a defendant in this case based upon the\n\nfindings, conclusions, and rulings reflected therein.\n\n\n               10.     On December 19, 2016, the Texas court also granted summary judgment\n\nagainst Mateo Cortez on his declaratory claims to the Trust:\n\n\n               On this day, the Court considered the Traditional and No Evidence\n               Motion for Summary Judgment (the \"Motion\") filed by Third Party\n               Defendants ... Connie [Lou] Keith Barry ... all in their individual\n               capacities. Having considered the Motion, the response, all\n               admissible summary judgment evidence, the arguments of counsel,\n               and the other papers on file with the Court, the Court hereby\n               GRANTS the Motion in its entirety.\n\n               It is therefore, ORDERED, that Mateo Cortez's claims against Third\n               Party Defendants in this lawsuit are dismissed in their entirety. In\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\f                    particular, the Court hereby dismisses any and all claims that Mateo\n                    Cortez, in his individual capacity or in his capacity as personal\n                    representative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez, has to any assets of\n                    The William D. Short and Phyllis D. Short Revocable Living Trust\n                    (the \"Trust\"), other than his claim for undistributed income from the\n                    Trust during the life of Deborah Cortez. This judgment has no effect\n                    on Mateo Cortez's breach of fiduciary duty against Linda Murray,\n                    in her capacity as trustee of the Trust.\n\n                    11.      On June 12, 2017, Mateo Cortez filed this Motion, and attached as exhibits\n\nmultiple filings from Texas.\n\n\n                             a.       Mateo Cortez argues that the Texas filings attached to his Motion\n\n                   demonstrate that the Trust is being actively administered in Texas and that the\n\n                   claims pending before this Court are being litigated concurrently in Texas.\n\n\n                             b.       With the exception of Mateo Cortez's intervention pleadings, all of\n\n                   the attached filings from Texas relate to the administration of the Estates of William\n\n                   D. Short and Phyllis D. Short, which are legally distinct from the Trust. The\n\n                   remaining pleadings relate to Mateo Cortez's petition in intervention, which was\n\n                   dismissed by the Texas court on December 19, 2016. 1\n\n\n                            c.        None of the filings attached to Mateo Cortez's Motion seek relief\n\n                   that is the same or similar to the relief sought in this action, to-wit: \"an order\n\n                   directing the distribution of the assets of the Trust to those persons determined by\n\n                   this Court to be entitled to receive the same in such proportions as may be\n\n\n          1\n            Mateo Cortez also attached a pleading entitled Fifth Amended Petition in Intervention and Fourth Amended\nThird Party Petition, which was filed in Texas on May 25, 2017. As with his original intervention pleading, Mateo\nCortez's fifth amended intervention pleading seeks a declaratory judgment that Deborah Cortez was entitled to all of\nthe Trust assets during her life, and an order directing the Trustee to distribute the remaining Trust assets to the Estate\nof Deborah Cortez. Mateo Cortez's fifth amended intervention pleading does not request that the Texas court\ndetermine the proper beneficiaries of the Trust in the event his amended declaratory claim fails.\n\n\n\n                                                            5\n\f                  determined by this Court to be proper and in conformity with the intent of the\n\n                  settlors of the Trust.\" None of the other parties to the Texas action have requested\n\n                  that the Texas court determine the proper beneficiaries of the Trust or the proper\n\n                  distribution of the Trust assets.

Mateo Cortez filed this Motion to dismiss post-judgment. To the extent he\n\nseeks to dismiss this case on any basis other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction, Mateo Cortez's\n\nMotion is procedurally improper and therefore denied. See W.Va. R. Civ. P. 12(h) (defenses other\n\nthan lack of subject matter jurisdiction are waived unless raised prior to judgment). The Court\n\nwill therefore construe Mateo Cortez's Motion as challenging the Court's subject matter\n\njurisdiction.\n\n\n                20.     The Court finds that the principles announced in Berger and Princess Lida\n\nof Thurn & Taxis do not apply to this action and do not deprive this Court of subject matter\n\njurisdiction over the Trustee's claims.\n\n\n                        a.      First, the Trustee's claims in this action are not identical to the\n\n                claims filed in Texas. The Trustee filed this action seeking \"an order directing the\n\n                distribution of the assets of the Trust to those persons determined by this Court to\n\n                be entitled to receive the same in such proportions as may be determined by this\n\n                Court to be proper and in conformity with the intent of the settlors of the Trust.\" In\n\n                contrast, Mateo Cortez filed his intervention claims in Texas to obtain a declaration\n\n                that Deborah Cortez was entitled to all of the Trust assets during her life, and an\n\n                order directing the Trustee to distribute the remaining Trust assets to the Estate of\n\n                Deborah Cortez. Mateo Cortez did not request that the Texas court determine the\n\n                proper beneficiaries of the Trust in the event his declaratory claim failed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\f                         b.      Second, Mateo Cortez's intervention claims in Texas are in\n\n                 personam only, and do not affect this Court's jurisdiction. Mateo Cortez filed his\n\n                 intervention claims in Texas to establish the Estate of Deborah Cortez's \"right to\n\n                 participate in the res or as to [its] quantum of [its] interest in it,\" which falls under\n\n                 the rule set forth in Bradford and not the rule set forth in Princess Lida of Thurn &\n\n                 Taxis. The Texas court appears to be in agreement with this Court's conclusion,\n\n                 given its refusal to enjoin the Trustee from proceeding further with this action.\n\n                 Accordingly, even if the claims before this Court were identical to the claims filed\n\n                 in Texas, concurrent jurisdiction over those claims is proper until a judgment from\n\n                 one court operates as resjudicata in the other.\n\n\n                 21.     Additionally, even assuming that Mateo Cortez's intervention claims in\n\nTexas did implicate Princess Lida of Thurn & Taxis, his claims have been dismissed in their\n\nentirety by the Texas court. None of the other parties to the Texas proceedings have asked the\n\nTexas court to determine how the Trust should be distributed. That claim is only pending here in\n\nWest Virginia, and the Texas court has stated that it won't interfere with this Court's adjudication\n\nof that issue.\n\n\n                                                Ruling\n\n                 For the reasons set forth above, and as stated more fully upon the record, this Court\n\nDENIES the motion to dismiss filed by Mateo Cortez.\n\n\n                 The Court notes that Defendant Connie Lou Keith Barry has filed a motion for\n\nsanctions against Mateo Cortez, in either his personal capacity or in his capacity as the Personal\n\n\n\n\n                                                   9\n\f  '     w\n\n\n\n\n  Representative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez, and his attorneys.

After considering the Motion, the response of\n\n       defendant Connie Barry (\"Response\"), the response of the Trustee, the arguments of counsel, and\n\n       the record, this Court hereby DENIES the Motion for the reasons stated on the record and more\n\n       fully below.\n\n\n                                             Procedural Posture\n\n                      1.      On June 12, 2017 Defendant Mateo Cortez, in his capacity as the Personal\n\n   Representative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez, filed The Estate of Deborah Cortez's Motion to\n\n   Intervene and Memorandum of Law in Support Thereof(the \"Motion\"), requesting that the Court\n\n   pennit the Estate of Deborah Cortez to intervene pursuant to Rule 24 of the West Virginia Rules\n\n   of Civil Procedure.\n\n\n                      2.

Short and Phyllis D. Short\n\n Revocable Living Family Trust Dated April 30, 1991,\" as amended and restated by the \"Second\n\n Amendment and Restatement of The William D. Short and Phyllis D. Short Revocable Living\n\n Trust\" dated January 5, 2000 (collectively, the \"Trust\"), should have been inherited by Deborah\n\nCortez following the death of Phyllis D. Short, as the sole heir and beneficiary of Phyllis's estate.\n\nThe proposed intervenor complaint further requests an order directing that all the assets of the\n\nTrust be distributed to the Estate of Deborah Cortez.\n\n\n               3.      On June 22, 2017, Plaintiff Linda Murray, in her capacity as Successor\n\nTrustee of the Trust (the \"Trustee\"), filed a response in opposition to the Motion. On June 23,\n\n2017, Defendant Connie Lou Keith Barry (\"Barry\"), filed a response in opposition to the Motion\n\nand a request for sanctions. On June 27, 2017, the Court conducted a hearing on the Motion and\n\nother matters. The Court has reviewed the Motion, supporting memorandum and exhibits, the\n\nTrustee and Barry's responses and supporting exhibits, the Trust instrument, and entertained the\n\narguments of the parties. The Court has also reviewed the entire record in this matter as part of\n\nits consideration of this Motion and the other matters pending before it.\n\n\n                            Findings of Fact & Conclusions of Law\n\n               4.     On November 20, 2015, the Trustee filed this action to obtain \"an order\n\ndirecting the distribution of the assets of the Trust to those persons determined by this Court to\n\nbe entitled to receive the same in such proportions as may be determined by this Court to be\n\nproper and in conformity with the intent of the settlors of the Trust.\" (Complaint, p. 22). The\n\nTrustee joined and served Mateo Cortez as a defendant because he \"claims that as the surviving\n\nspouse of Deborah Ann (Short) Cortez he is entitled to the trnst proceeds.\" (Complaint,      ir 13).\n\n                                                2\n\f The docket sheet for this matter indicates that Mateo Cortez was served with process on\n\n December 4, 2015.\n\n\n                   5.       At all times relevant to this action, Mateo Cortez was the sole heir and\n\nbeneficiary of the Estate of Deborah Cortez, and had sole authority to act on its behalf. In both\n\nthis action and the proceedings in Texas, Mateo Cortez's personal counsel also represents him in\n\nhis capacity as the Personal Representative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez.\n\n\n                   6.      On December 28, 2015, Mateo Cortez filed a Rule 12(b) motion to dismiss\n\nthis action pursuant to the doctrine of forum non conveniens, arguing that this action should be\n\ndismissed because the Trustee's claims were currently being litigated in Texas. 1 In his motion,\n\nMateo Cortez stated that he was seeking to administer the Estate of Deborah Cortez in Texas,\n\nand stated that \"Mr. Cortez filed an Original Petition in Intervention that seeks a declaratory\n\njudgment regarding the distribution of the Trust to Mateo Cortez, the sole heir of the Estate of his\n\nlate wife, Deborah Cortez.\" However, Mateo Cortez did not argue that the Estate of Deborah\n\nCortez was a necessary or indispensable party to this action, did not seek to dismiss this action\n\nfor failure to join the Estate of Deborah Cortez as an indispensable party, and did not attempt to\n\njoin the Estate of Deborah Cortez as a party. On March 16, 2016, this Court denied Mateo\n\nCortez's motion to dismiss.\n\n\n                  7.       On April 8, 2016, Mateo Cortez filed his answer in this matter. In his\n\nanswer to paragraph 13 of the Trustee's complaint, Mateo Cortez admitted \"that he is the\n\nsurviving spouse and sole heir of Deborah Ann Cortez and that, as a surviving spouse and sole\n\nheir of Deborah Ann Cortez, that he is entitled to the trust proceeds.\" Mateo Cortez further\n\n\n       1 The   Trustee and Barry dispute Mateo Cortez's characterization of the claims before the Texas court.\n\n\n                                                         3\n\f stated in his answer to paragraph 13 of the Trustee's complaint that the Texas court \"has\n\njurisdiction to declare that the Estate of Deborah Cortez is entitled to all of the assets of the\n\ntrust.\" Mateo Cortez raised as his tenth defense to the Trustee's complaint that \"[t]he Plaintiff\n\nhas failed to join necessary and indispensable parties and thus this Complaint should be\n\ndismissed.\" However, Mateo Cortez did not allege that the Estate of Deborah Cortez was a\n\nnecessary or indispensable party to this action, did not seek to dismiss this action for failure to\n\njoin the Estate of Deborah Cortez as an indispensable party, and did not attempt to join the Estate\n\nof Deborah Cortez as a party.\n\n\n               8.      On April 11, 2016, Defendant Barry filed a motion for partial summary\n\njudgment that Mateo Cortez is not entitled to share in the distribution of any assets of the Trust.\n\nBarry argued that the Trust instrument is unambiguous and that, pursuant to the terms of the\n\nTrust instrument, any remaining assets of the Trust are to be distributed to the heirs at law of\n\nWilliam D. Short and Phyllis D. Short now that Deborah Cortez is deceased.\n\n\n               9.      On May 9, 2016, Mateo Cortez filed a response to Barry's motion for\n\npartial summary judgment. In his response, Mateo Cortez stated that he \"intends to conduct\n\ndiscovery to prove that as a surviving spouse of Deborah Cortez, he is entitled to the trust\n\nproceeds,\" and further argued he \"is entitled to receive trust assets because he is the sole heir of\n\nthe Estate of Deborah Cortez, the Shorts' only child.\" However, Mateo Cortez did not argue that\n\nthe Estate of Deborah Cortez was a necessary or indispensable party to this action, did not seek\n\nto dismiss this action for failure to join the Estate of Deborah Cortez as an indispensable party,\n\nand did not attempt to join the Estate of Deborah Cortez as a party.\n\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\f                   10.      On May 13, 2016, the Court conducted a hearing on Barry's motion for\n\n partial summary judgment and took the matter under advisement.\n\n\n                   11.     On April 29, 2016, Mateo Cortez filed a petition for a writ of prohibition\n\n with the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, seeking to prohibit execution of this\n\n Court's order denying his motion to dismiss. 2 In his petition, Mateo Cortez asserted that\n\n \"[u]nder Texas law, a sole heir may bring an action on behalf of the deceased's estate,\" and\n\n devoted several pages of his brief to discussing actions he had taken in Texas on behalf of the\n\n Estate of Deborah Cortez to adjudicate its interest in the Trust. The petition further asserted that\n\n\"Mateo Cortez, as Representative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez, subsequently filed an Original\n\n Petition in Intervention [in Texas] seeking declaratory judgment on the distribution of the Trust\n\nassets to the Estate of Deborah Cortez,\" and that \"the original Plaintiff/Petitioner in this matter is\n\nthe Estate of Deborah Cortez which filed its Original Petition in Intervention five (5) months\n\nprior to filing the duplicative litigation in West Virginia.\" However, Mateo Cortez did not argue\n\nthat the Estate of Deborah Cortez was a necessary or indispensable party to this action, or that\n\nthis action should be dismissed for failure to join the Estate of Deborah Cortez as an\n\nindispensable party. On June 14, 2016, the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia refused\n\nMateo Cortez's petition.\n\n\n                  12.      On September 15, 2016, this Court granted Defendant Barry's motion for\n\npartial summary judgment, and dismissed Mateo Cortez as a defendant in this case based upon\n\nthe findings, conclusions, and rulings reflected therein.\n\n\n\n\n          2 Per the requirements of the Appellate Rules of Procedure, this Court received a copy of Mateo Cortez's\n\npetition, as reflected on the certificate of service.\n\n\n                                                        5\n\f                13.     At no time prior to this Court's September 15, 2016, order granting\n\n Defendant Barry's motion for partial summary judgment did Mateo Cortez: (1) argue that the\n\n Estate of Deborah Cortez was a necessary or indispensable party to this action; (2) file a motion\n\n to dismiss this action for failure to join the Estate of Deborah Cortez as an indispensable party, or\n\notherwise argue that this action should be dismissed for failure to join the Estate of Deborah\n\nCortez as an indispensable party; or (3) attempt to join the Estate of Deborah Cortez as a party,\n\nor intervene as a party on behalf of the Estate of Deborah Cortez.\n\n\n                14.     On September 29, 2016, Mateo Cortez filed a motion to alter or amend\n\nthis Court's order granting Defendant Barry's motion for partial summary judgment, arguing that\n\nthe Court should vacate its order and dismiss this case with prejudice. Among other grounds for\n\ngranting his motion to alter or amend, Mateo Cortez argued for the first time that the Estate of\n\nDeborah Cortez is an indispensable party to this action.\n\n\n                15.    On December 19, 2016, the Probate Court of Travis County, Texas\n\ngranted summary judgment against Mateo Cortez, dismissing \"any and all claims that Mateo\n\nCortez, in his individual capacity or in his capacity as personal representative of the Estate of\n\nDeborah Cortez, has to any assets of The William D. Short and Phyllis D. Short Revocable\n\nLiving Trust (the 'Trust'), other than his claim for undistributed income from the Trust during\n\nthe life of Deborah Cortez.\" The Texas court subsequently amended its judgment to include\n\nmonetary sanctions against Mateo Cortez's attorneys, finding that the arguments which Mateo\n\nCortez advanced in Texas were frivolous and were not warranted by existing law; the extension,\n\nmodification, or reversal of existing law; or the establishment of new law. The Texas court\n\nsanctioned Mateo Cortez's attorneys in the amount of $65,130.76 for driving up Defendant\n\nBarry's legal fees in Texas with frivolous claims.\n\n\n                                                 6\n\f                                          Conclusions of Law\n\n                  16.     Mateo Cortez, in his capacity as the Personal Representative of the Estate\n\nof Deborah Cortez, seeks to intervene in this action as a matter of right, pursuant to Rule 24( a)(2)\n\nof the West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure. The rule states in pertinent part:\n\n\n                  (a) Intervention of Right. Upon timely application anyone shall be\n                  permitted to intervene in an action . . . (2) when the applicant\n                  claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is\n                  the subject of the action and the applicant is so situated that the\n                  disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or\n                  impede the applicant's ability to protect that interest, unless the\n                  applicant's interest is adequately represented by existing parties.\n\nW.Va. R. Civ. P. 24.\n\n\n                  17.    \"West Virginia Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2) allows intervention of\n\nright in an action if an applicant meets four conditions: (1) the application must be timely; (2) the\n\napplicant must claim an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the\n\naction; (3) disposition of the action may, as a practical matter, impair or impede the applicant's\n\nability to protect that interest; and (4) the applicant must show that the interest will not be\n\nadequately represented by existing parties.\" Syl.

It is undisputed that, at all times relevant to this action, Mateo\n\nCortez was the sole heir and beneficiary of the Estate of Deborah Cortez, and had\n\nsole authority to act on its behalf.\n\n\n       d.       It is also undisputed that Mateo Cortez had actual notice of this\n\naction as of December 4, 2015, but did not attempt to intervene on behalf of the\n\nEstate of Deborah Cortez, or argue that the Estate of Deborah Cortez was an\n\nindispensable party to this action, until after this Court granted summary\n\njudgment against him and dismissed him as a defendant.\n\n\n\n\n                                   8\n\f                        e.        It is also undisputed that Mateo Cortez did not actually attempt to\n\n               intervene in this matter on behalf of the Estate of Deborah Cortez until June 12,\n\n               201 7 - nine (9) months after entry of judgment against Mateo Cortez.\n\n\n                                   Second Prong under Rule 24(a)(2)\n                                  Applicant Does Not Have an Interest\n\n               19.      Second, the Court finds that the applicant does not have an interest in the\n\nproperty which is the subject of this action.\n\n\n                        a.       This action seeks to determine the proper distribution of the Trust\n\n               assets which remained after the death of Deborah Cortez. The applicant is Mateo\n\n               Cortez, in his capacity as the Personal Representative of the Estate of Deborah\n\n               Cortez, so the question is whether the Estate of Deborah Cortez has an interest in\n\n               the undistributed assets of the Trust.\n\n\n                        b.       However, as this Court and the Probate Court of Travis County,\n\n               Texas have already ruled, Mateo Cortez and the Estate of Deborah Cortez do not\n\n               have an interest in the assets of the Trust.\n\n\n                       c.        This Court has already ruled that Deborah Cortez's interest in the\n\n               Trust was governed by Article VIII, Section B of the Trust instrument, which\n\n               states that if Deborah \"is living on the date of the death of the second one of us to\n\n               die,\" then \"during Deborah's life\" she was entitled to an annual distribution of\n\n               $25,000.00 of the Trust principal, and a quarterly distribution of the net Trust\n\n              income.        Article VIII, Section C of the Trust instrument sets forth how the\n\n              remaining Trust assets are to be distributed upon Deborah's death, which is one-\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fhalf to the heirs at law of William D. Short and one-half to the heirs at law of\n\nPhyllis D. Short. Accordingly, the Estate of Deborah Cortez has no interest in the\n\nassets of the Trust because the plain and unambiguous language of the Trust\n\ninstrument afforded no interest to Deborah upon her death.\n\n\n        d.     Despite the fact that the Motion is not timely and despite the fact\n\nthe applicant does not have an interest in the subject property, the proposed\n\nintervenor complaint nonetheless alleges that the Estate of Deborah Cortez has an\n\ninterest in the Trust because Article VIII, Section A, Paragraph 2 of the Trust\n\ninstrument invalidated the remaining provisions of Article VIII.        This Court\n\ndisagrees.\n\n\n               1.     Article VIII, Section A sets forth a senes of one-time\n\n       distributions of cash, including a distribution to Deborah Cortez under the\n\n       following condition:\n\n\n       2.      Cash Distribution to Deborah. If our daughter,\n       DEBORAH A. CORTEZ, is living and legally competent,\n       the trustee shall distribute to her the sum of fifty thousand\n       dollars $50,000.00 as soon as practicable after the death of\n       the second one of us to die. If Deborah is not then living or\n       is not legally competent, then this gift shall lapse, and the\n       remainder of the trust estate shall be administered as\n       provided below.\n\n       The applicant alleges that the second sentence of this provision dictates\n\n       that the remainder of the Trust assets are only to be administered under the\n\n       subsequent sections of Article VIII if \"Deborah is not then living or is not\n\n      legally competent.\"     The applicant therefore alleges that \"the Trust is\n\n      ineffective for the disposition of the Trust assets at the time of Phyllis D.\n\n                                10\n\f                        Short's death since Deborah Cortez was alive and competent,\" that the\n\n                       remainder of the Trust therefore lapsed, and that all of the assets of the\n\n                       Trust passed by intestacy through the Estate of Phyllis D. Short to\n\n                       Deborah Cortez as her sole heir.\n\n\n                               11.     The Court, however, rejects this argument as frivolous and\n\n                       contravened by the plain language of the Trust instrument. By its terms,\n\n                       the second sentence of Article VIII, Section A, Paragraph 2 of the Trust\n\n                       instrument pertains solely to whether the cash distribution to Deborah\n\n                       under that paragraph lapses; and does not govern the \"Continuing Trust\n\n                       for Deborah\" established under Article VIII, Section B \"[i]f our daughter,\n\n                       Deborah A. Cortez, is living on the date of the death of the second one of\n\n                       us to die.\" It is undisputed that Deborah was alive when Phyllis D. Short\n\n                       died; the Court must give effect to the intent of the settlors in creating the\n\n                       Trust, and will not read the Trust instrument as \"ineffective for the\n\n                       disposition of the Trust assets\" when the plain language of the Trust does\n\n                       in fact provide for the disposition of the Trust assets.\n\n\n                                Third Prong under Rule 24(a)(2)\n        Disposition of the Action Does Not Impair Applicant's Ability to Protect Interest\n\n               20.     Third, the Court finds that its disposition of this action has not impaired or\n\nimpeded the applicant's ability to protect its interest in the property which is the subject of this\n\naction. This Court and the Texas court have already ruled that Mateo Cortez and the Estate of\n\nDeborah Cortez do not have an interest in the undistributed assets of the Trust. Pursuant to\n\nArticle VIII, Section B of the Trust instrument, Deborah Cortez only possessed a life interest in\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fthe assets of the Trust, and that interest extinguished when she died; and the Trust instrument\n\nmakes no provision for Mateo Cortez at all, despite the fact that the settlors clearly knew that\n\nMateo Cortez and Deborah were married.\n\n\n                               Fourth Prong under Rule 24(a)(2)\n                               Applicant Adequately Represented\n\n              21.     Fourth, the Court finds that the applicant was adequately represented by\n\nMateo Cortez, who is the administrator and sole heir of the Estate of Deborah Cortez.\n\n\n                      a.      As to adequacy of representation by existing parties, \"generally\n\n              courts compare the interests asserted by the proposed intervenor with the interests\n\n              of the existing party. If the proposed intervenor's interest is not represented by\n\n              the existing party, or the existing party's interests are adverse to those of the\n\n              proposed intervenor, intervention should be granted .... [However], if the interests\n\n              are identical, intervention should be denied unless there is a compelling showing\n\n              as to why the existing representation is inadequate.\"           State ex rel.

Mateo Cortez, in both his personal capacity and in his capacity as\n\n              the Personal Representative of the Estate of Deborah Cortez, have identical\n\n              interests in this action: both seek an order directing that all the assets of the Trust\n\n              be distributed to Mateo Cortez, either through direct distribution to Mateo Cortez\n\n              personally or indirectly through distribution to the Estate of Deborah Cortez,\n\n              which then flows through to Mateo Cortez personally as its sole heir.             This\n\n              identity of interest is clear from the undisputed fact that Mateo Cortez controls\n\n\n                                                12\n\f                every decision made on behalf of the Estate of Deborah Cortez, and is the only\n\n                heir and beneficiary of the estate.\n\n\n                       c.
