(Ultra), SWEPI, LP (SWEPI) and\nLance Oil & Gas Co. (Lance Oil)1 appeal from the district court’s orders after\nAppellees/Plaintiffs Doyle and Margaret Hartman, et. al. filed a motion to enforce a\njudgment and net profits contract (NPC) pertaining to oil and gas leases in Sublette\nCounty, Wyoming. 2 The defendants claim the district court did not have jurisdiction to\nrule on the issues presented in the plaintiffs’ motion to enforce. They also contest the\ndistrict court’s decision on the merits of the motion to enforce and its award of attorney\nfees to the plaintiffs. We conclude the district court had jurisdiction over the issues\npresented, it correctly interpreted its prior judgment and the defendants’ accounting\nresponsibilities under the NPC, and it properly granted the plaintiffs’ request for attorney\nfees, although we do order a minor revision of the award.\n\n[¶2]    We affirm with revision.\n\n                                                  ISSUES\n\n[¶3]    The issues3 on appeal are:\n\n\n1\n Lance Oil did not file a separate brief. Instead, it joined the arguments presented in Ultra’s and\nSWEPI’s briefs, with the exception of their arguments on the attorney fee award which did not apply to\nLance Oil because it was a non-operator working interest owner.\n2\n Initially, there were two additional appeals related to this matter. Supreme Court Case No. S-14-0009\nwas an appeal brought by defendants WPX Energy RM Company, f/k/a Williams Production Rocky\nMountain Co., and Arrowhead Resources (U.S.A.), Ltd. We dismissed the appeal for want of prosecution\nwhen the appellants’ brief was not filed in a timely manner and refused to reinstate the appeal on a later\npetition. Supreme Court Case. No. S-14-0010 was a cross-appeal brought by the plaintiffs which was\nvoluntarily dismissed.\n3\n We restate the issues presented in the parties’ opening briefs, but do not include the “issues” presented\nby defendants in their reply brief. W.R.A.P. 7.03 governs reply briefs:\n\n                Appellant may file a brief in reply which shall comply with the requirements of\n        W.R.A.P. 7.01(a), (b), (c), (f), (g), (h), and (i). In lieu of any statement of the issues, the\n        reply brief shall precisely and concisely set forth on the first page those new issues and\n        arguments raised by the brief of the appellee which are addressed in the reply brief. A\n        reply brief is limited to such new issues and arguments, and a failure to comply with\n        these requirements may subject the party to sanctions under these rules.\n\nIn large part, the defendants’ reply brief simply includes further argument on the issues included in their\nopening briefs. “Presenting argument in a reply brief is not equivalent to framing the issues in an opening\nbrief. A reply brief is not a second chance to raise an issue or present argument that the appellant had the\nresponsibility, but failed, to address in its opening brief.” Ferrell v. Knighten, 2013 WY 37, ¶ 11, n.1, 298\n\f      1.      Did the district court have jurisdiction to consider the plaintiffs’ motion to\nenforce the judgment and the NPC?\n\n       2.     Did the district court err by ruling that defendants were not entitled to credit\nfor expenses which were invoiced prior to 2007 because they should have been charged\nagainst the net profits interest (NPI) during the time period at issue in the trial?\n\n      3.    Did the district court err by ruling that, under the terms of the NPC,\nexpenses had to be charged against the NPI in the month following the month the\nexpenses were invoiced?\n\n       4.     Did the district court err by rejecting the defendants’ argument, based upon\nthe principles of estoppel and finality, that the plaintiffs had agreed and the district court\nhad previously ordered expenses would be charged against the NPI when billed to other\nworking interest owners in joint interest bills (JIBs)?\n\n       5. Did the district court err in awarding attorney fees to plaintiffs?\n\n                                             FACTS\n\n[¶4] The parties own interests in certain oil and gas leases in Sublette County,\nWyoming. Ultra Resources, Inc. v. Hartman, 2010 WY 36, ¶ 10, 226 P.3d 889, 902\n(Wyo. 2010) (Ultra I). Defendants Ultra and SWEPI4 are working interest owners and\noperators of the leases, defendant Lance Oil is a non-operator working interest owner,\nand the plaintiffs own a NPI in the leases. Id., ¶ 11, 226 P.3d at 902-03. In the\nunderlying litigation, the district court entered a declaratory judgment recognizing the\nexistence of the NPI and delineating the operators’ NPC accounting responsibilities. It\nalso granted a monetary judgment against the defendants for the amount due to the\nplaintiffs for the NPI through December 31, 2006. Id., ¶¶ 14, 17, 226 P.3d at 903-04.\nWith a few exceptions not relevant here, we affirmed the district court’s decision in Ultra\nI. After our mandate issued, the district court entered an amended judgment and the\ndefendants paid the monetary judgment.\n\n[¶5] In July 2010, the plaintiffs filed a motion to enforce judgment, claiming the\ndefendants were not properly accounting to them as required by the earlier declaratory\n\nP.3d 161, 163, n.1 (Wyo. 2013), quoting Ultra Resources, Inc. v. McMurry Energy Co., 2004 WY 121, ¶\n11, 99 P.3d 959, 963 (Wyo. 2004).\n4\n At the time of the trial, Shell Rocky Mountain Production, LLC was an operator and SWEPI was a non-\noperator working interest owner. Ultra I, ¶ 11, 226 P.3d at 902-03. On December 31, 2008, Shell\nmerged into SWEPI and SWEPI took Shell’s position as operator of the relevant leases.\n                                                 2\n\fjudgment and the NPC. The defendants asserted the district court did not have\njurisdiction to consider the matters raised in the plaintiffs’ motion to enforce and the\nplaintiffs should have commenced a new action instead. The district court concluded it\nhad jurisdiction and issued a number of orders on the merits of the plaintiffs’ motion to\nenforce.\n\n[¶6] The primary order at issue here pertains to the defendants’ attempts to charge pre-\n2007 expenses to calculate the NPI starting January 1, 2007. The district court ruled that\nthe NPI had been fully calculated through December 31, 2006 at trial, and the NPC\nrequired expenses to be charged to the NPI in the month following the date the expenses\nwere invoiced. Consequently, the district court refused to allow the defendants to charge\nexpenses invoiced prior to January 1, 2007, when calculating the 2007 NPI. The district\ncourt also concluded the plaintiffs were the prevailing parties in the enforcement\nproceeding pursuant to the Wyoming Royalty Payment Act (WRPA), segregation of the\nattorney fees between claims was not required and the operating defendants were\nrequired to pay the plaintiffs’ attorney fees.\n\n[¶7] The defendants appealed the district court’s decisions on the merits and its order\non attorney fees. We will provide additional factual background as relevant to the issues\ndiscussed below.\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n              1. Jurisdiction\n\n[¶8] The defendants maintain the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction\nto decide the issues raised in the plaintiffs’ motion to enforce and the plaintiffs should\nhave commenced a new civil action to have the matters heard. “The existence of subject\nmatter jurisdiction is a question of law that we review de novo.” Madsen v. Bd. of\nTrustees of Memorial Hospital of Sweetwater County, 2011 WY 36, ¶ 9, 248 P.3d 1151,\n1153 (Wyo. 2011), citing Cantrell v. Sweetwater County School Dist. No. 2, 2006 WY\n57, ¶ 6, 133 P.3d 983, 985 (Wyo. 2006). See also Stephens v. Lavitt, 2010 WY 129, ¶ 9,\n239 P.3d 634, 637 (Wyo. 2010).\n\n[¶9] In Ultra I, the case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings\nconsistent with our decision. The defendants argue the district court’s jurisdiction over\nthe action ended when the district court entered an amended judgment consistent with our\nmandate and they satisfied the monetary judgment. Thus, they claim the district court did\nnot have jurisdiction to consider the issues raised in the plaintiffs’ motion to enforce. The\ntwo aspects of the district court’s order challenged by the defendants are the district\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fcourt’s exclusion of the pre-2007 expenses from the 2007 NPI accounting and its\ninterpretation of the NPC deadlines for the operators’ expense reports.5\n\n[¶10] Courts have inherent power to enforce their own judgments. In Hurd v. Nelson,\n714 P.2d 767 (Wyo. 1986), we affirmed the district court’s post-judgment order\nenforcing a property settlement in a divorce action. Speaking to the district court’s\nenforcement powers, we stated:\n\n                      “Courts have inherent power to enforce their own\n               judgments and should see to it that such judgments are\n               enforced when they are called upon to do so. To deprive a\n               court of power to execute its judgments is to impair its\n               jurisdiction, and the general rule is that every court having\n               jurisdiction to render a particular judgment has inherent\n               power and authority to enforce it and to exercise equitable\n               control over such enforcement. Thus, a court of equity has\n               inherent power to enforce its decrees. A court of equity\n               retains and possesses the power to control the manner of the\n               execution of its decree, and has the inherent right to modify,\n               by a subsequent order, the manner in which it shall be\n               enforced. * * * ” 46 Am.Jur.2d Judgments § 898, p. 1032\n               (1969).\n\nId. at 771.\n\n[¶11] A court also has inherent power to interpret its judgments and clarify ambiguous\nterms. 46 Am. Jur. 2d Judgments § 73 (2015) states:\n\n                   Trial courts have the inherent authority to interpret and\n               clarify their judgments. The mere interpretation of a judgment\n               involves no challenge of its validity, or an attack on it, and a\n               clarification of an ambiguous judgment is not a modification\n               or amendment of the judgment. An order clarifying a\n               judgment explains or refines rights already given, and it\n               neither grants new rights nor extends old ones. Unlike a\n               modification, amendment, or alteration to a judgment, which\n               must be accomplished under the court rules or some other\n\n\n5\n  The district court entered other post-judgment orders including an order confirming exclusion of\ndivision expenses, an order approving a set of reporting forms, and an order regarding the plaintiffs’\nrights to access the defendants’ accounting records. Although parties may not confer jurisdiction on a\ncourt by agreement when it does not exist, White v. Bd. of Land Comm’rs, 595 P.2d 76, 79 (Wyo. 1979),\nthe defendants do not contest those rulings on appeal and we will not specifically discuss them.\n                                                  4\n\f              exception to preclusion, a clarification of a judgment can be\n              accomplished at any time.\n\n(footnotes omitted). See also Ladwig v. Chatters, 623 N.W.2d 266 (Minn. Ct. App.\n2001) (trial court had jurisdiction to interpret, clarify and enforce its earlier judgment).\n\n[¶12] In Zaloudek v. Zaloudek, 2010 WY 169, 245 P.3d 336 (Wyo. 2010), we addressed\nthe husband’s post-judgment motions to clarify his obligations under the property\ndivision provisions of a divorce decree and to extend his deadline for compliance with a\ncash award to the wife. The district court denied the husband’s motions, entered a\njudgment in favor of the wife for interest accrued since the original decree and ordered\nthe husband to satisfy the judgment within five days. Id., ¶ 6, 245 P.3d at 339. Relying\non Hurd, supra, we concluded the district court’s post-judgment rulings were authorized\nbecause they fell within the court’s inherent authority to enforce its own judgments. Id.,\n¶ 13, 245 P.3d at 341.\n\n[¶13] The defendants argue that Hurd does not provide authority for the district court’s\nactions in this case because it was a divorce action and the legislature specifically granted\ncourts continuing jurisdiction in such cases. Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 20-2-203 (LexisNexis\n2013) grants courts continuing jurisdiction to enforce and modify orders concerning the\ncare, custody and visitation of children after a divorce decree. However, Hurd addressed\nproperty division issues and § 20-2-203 does not grant continuing jurisdiction to courts to\nmodify property divisions in divorce decrees. Glover v. Crayk, 2005 WY 143, ¶ 6, 122\nP.3d 955, 957 (Wyo. 2005).\n\n[¶14] Instead, Hurd specifically addressed the court’s inherent power to enforce its own\norders. The power is, of course, limited to interpretation and clarification of orders and\nenforcement of their terms. In doing so, the court must stay true to the earlier judgment.\nIn Eddy v. First Wyoming Bank, 713 P.2d 228, 235 (Wyo. 1986), this Court confirmed\nthat the district court may interpret an earlier judgment pursuant to a post-judgment\nmotion to clarify. We stated the court may take additional evidence at a post-judgment\nhearing to effectuate the original intent of the order. Id. See also Glover, ¶ 13, 122 P.3d\nat 958 (interpreting motion to amend or modify a divorce decree as a motion to correct a\nclerical mistake under W.R.C.P. 60(a)). The district court in the case at bar, therefore,\nhad inherent authority to interpret, clarify and enforce its judgment in accordance with its\noriginal intent.\n\n[¶15] In contesting the district court’s jurisdiction over the post-judgment proceedings,\nthe defendants also fail to recognize the significance of the declaratory judgment aspects\nof the original decision. The trial judgment stated:\n\n                     98. The defendants remain obligated to and shall\n              perform the required NPI accounting on a consolidated basis\n\n                                             5\n\f              and make payments monthly to the plaintiffs commencing\n              with production month January 2007, and shall do so in\n              accordance with the terms of the Net Profits Contract and its\n              Accounting Procedure and in compliance with the Court’s\n              Findings of Fact, 25-30, supra.\n\nThe referenced findings of fact stated:\n\n                    25. Proper accounting for the NPI involves\n              expenses and revenues allocable to operations under the\n              Exhibit A leases to the Net Profits Contract and more recently\n              the Subject Leases . . .\n\n                    26. The plaintiffs’ NPI is 4.98%, rather than 5.0%,\n              because of the small interest owned by a non-plaintiff.\n\n                     27. The Net Profits Contract sets forth the terms to\n              be applied and honored in order to perform proper\n              computation of any payable net profits. The accounting\n              requirements are set forth in the body of the Net Profits\n              Contract, in Exhibit A listing the permitted royalty and\n              overriding royalty burdens on the leases, and in Exhibit C-1,\n              which is an Accounting Procedure.\n\n                     28. The Net Profits Contract Accounting Procedure\n              may not be amended without the consent or approval of Novi\n              or its successors in interest, including plaintiffs or their\n              successors in interest. The Net Profits Accounting Procedure\n              has never been amended.\n\n                    29. The Net Profits Contract and the Net Profits\n              Accounting Procedure establish principles to be followed in\n              performing the proper accounting of the NPI as follows:\n\n              (a) Plaintiffs’ net profits [interest] equals 4.98% of\n                  cumulative gross revenue less cumulative expenses on a\n                  consolidated basis associated with the operation of NPI\n                  leases and wells on those leases;\n              (b) The NPI is to be calculated each month and the\n                  incremental net profits for that month, if positive, is to be\n                  paid as soon as practicable after the end of any month in\n                  which net profits have been realized;\n              (c) Gross revenue is based on proceeds from wellhead gas\n\n                                             6\n\f                 and oil sales and on fair market value for other sales;\n             (d) Deductible expenses are those that are reasonable and\n                 customary in connection with the operation and\n                 development of oil and gas properties. These expenses\n                 are properly chargeable against the NPI leases and are\n                 limited by amounts specified in the Accounting Procedure\n                 unless and until that procedure is amended as provided\n                 therein;\n             (e) Expenses that are not reasonable and customary and not\n                 properly chargeable in connection with the operation and\n                 development of NPI leases and therefore, not deductible,\n                 include, among others, federal income tax, interest on\n                 capital and other expenses, depreciation, acquisition costs,\n                 accrual accounts, and future asset retirement accounts;\n             (f) The Accounting Procedure limits the amount of deductible\n                 labor expense (including employee benefits), Pinedale\n                 district office expense, well overhead rates, and legal\n                 expenses; and\n             (g) Deductible expenditures that benefit both NPI and non-\n                 NPI wells are allocated based on the ratio of the operators’\n                 end-of-year NPI well count to total well count.\n\n             30. In performing the NPI accounting, the only permitted\n             burden deductions from gross revenues are the overriding\n             royalty and landowners’ royalties set forth in the listing of\n             leases on Exhibit A to the Net Profits Contract. The\n             permissible burdens on the Subject Leases are depicted on\n             Exhibit B attached and incorporated herein.\n\n[¶16] The Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, as adopted in Wyoming at Wyo. Stat.\nAnn. § 1-37-101 through § 1-37-115 (LexisNexis 2013), has a provision that specifically\nauthorizes “further relief” in a declaratory judgment action. Section 1-37-110 states:\n\n             § 1-37-110. Supplemental relief\n\n                     Further relief based on a declaratory judgment may be\n             granted. Application therefor shall be by petition to a court\n             having jurisdiction to grant the relief. If the application is\n             sufficient the court, on reasonable notice, shall require any\n             adverse party whose rights have been adjudicated by the\n             declaratory judgment to show cause why further relief should\n             not be granted.\n\n\n                                            7\n\f[¶17] Section 1-37-110 has been cited as authority for courts’ post-declaratory judgment\ndeterminations in various contexts for many years. In In re General Adjudication of All\nRights to Use Water in the Big Horn River System, 835 P.2d 273 (Wyo. 1992), the tribes\nfiled a motion for order to show cause why the state engineer should not be held in\ncontempt for failing to follow an earlier declaratory judgment concerning tribal water\nrights. While sorting out various orders that had previously been entered in the case, we\naddressed the state engineer’s duty to follow and implement earlier declaratory judgment\nrulings. We cited § 1-37-110 as authority for the following statement:\n\n             When . . . it is impossible to determine if the tribal right is\n             being violated because the right itself is in some respect ill-\n             defined, the state engineer should promptly seek clarification\n             from the district court so that appropriate remedial action, if\n             needed, may be undertaken. See Wyo. Stat. §§ 1–37–106 &\n             1– 37– 110 (1988).\n\nId. at 283. This statement contains an implicit recognition of the district court’s\njurisdiction to grant further relief in declaratory judgment actions. See also Beatty v.\nChicago, B. & Q. R. Co., 52 P.2d 404, 409 (Wyo. 1935) (stating statute allowing for\nfurther declaratory relief permits post-judgment assessment of damages).\n\n[¶18] Learned treatises and decisions from other jurisdictions also demonstrate the\ncourts’ broad powers under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act.\n\n                 In a proceeding for a declaratory judgment, the court may\n             properly grant declaratory and nondeclaratory relief in a\n             single action, when such relief is requested in the pleadings\n             by the parties, or where the request for nondeclaratory relief\n             is found to be supplemental to the declaratory relief. A court\n             generally has jurisdiction to grant further and necessary or\n             proper relief, including any relief essential to effectuate the\n             declaratory judgment entered by the court. A court has the\n             power, for example, to retain jurisdiction and grant further\n             relief where it has entered a declaratory judgment declaring\n             the rights of the parties under a contract. In such a case, the\n             court may enter such supplemental judgments and orders,\n             from time to time, as are necessary to the supervision of the\n             contract.\n             ....\n                 Under a statute authorizing supplemental relief, the court\n             may be permitted to reserve the right to make such further\n             orders as might be necessary to effectuate the judgment, even\n\n\n                                           8\n\f              though no separate proceeding is initiated to obtain such\n              relief.\n\n24 C.J.S. Declaratory Judgments § 171 (2015) (footnotes omitted and emphasis\nadded).\n\n[¶19] The Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 33 (1982, updated 2014) discusses the\nflip side of the court’s power to grant supplemental declaratory relief, i.e., the preclusive\neffect of a declaratory judgment is not as broad as in other civil actions. While an issue\nthat was actually considered and decided in a declaratory judgment act is conclusive in a\nsubsequent action between the parties as to the specific matters declared, the “further\nrelief” provision of the act allows for additional or supplemental relief to be granted\nbetween the same parties on the same claim. Id. The reason for the departure from the\nusual preclusion rules “‘is that the losing party in a declaratory judgment action can\nnormally be expected to recognize the rights declared by the judgment and act\naccordingly, but that if he fails to do so, the court should have ample power to enforce the\njudgment by subsequent coercive orders, whether or not such relief was sought in the\noriginal action.’” Alsheikh v. Arabian Nat’l Shipping Corp., 2009 WL 884795, * 2 (Tex\nCt. App. 2009), citing Valley Oil Co. v. City of Garland, 499 S.W.2d 333, 336 (Tex. Ct.\nApp. 1973).\n\n[¶20] In Horn & Hardart Co. v. Nat’l Rail Passenger Corp., 843 F.2d 546 (D.C. Cir.\n1988), the landlord sought “further relief” in a declaratory judgment action involving the\ntermination of a commercial lease. In the original action, the district court upheld the\nlandlord’s right to terminate the lease but ordered it to compensate the tenant under the\nearly termination clause, and the circuit court affirmed that decision. When the tenant did\nnot vacate the premises after the declaratory judgment was entered, the landlord brought\nan action for “further relief” under the Declaratory Judgments Act, seeking payment\nunder the “end-of-term holdover and cost-on-default clauses” of the lease. The district\ncourt granted the landlord’s request for further relief and the tenant appealed, claiming\nthe district court lost jurisdiction over the matter after the original order was appealed.\n\n[¶21] The D.C. Circuit Court rejected that assertion, stating:\n\n              The “further relief” provisions of both state and federal\n              declaratory judgment statutes clearly anticipate ancillary or\n              subsequent coercion to make an original declaratory judgment\n              effective. Neither a completed appeal, nor a considerable\n              period of delay after the trial court ruling terminates this\n              authority. [The further relief provision’s] retained authority,\n              commentators have noted, “merely carries out the principle\n              that every court, with few exceptions, has inherent power to\n              enforce its decees and to make such orders as may be\n\n                                             9\n\f              necessary to render them effective.” Borchard, Declaratory\n              Judgments 441 (2d ed.1941)[.]\n\nHorn, 843 F.2d at 548 (footnotes and some citations omitted). See also Casa Balcona\nTerrace Cooperative v. Lyod, 2009 WL 1221257 (Mich. Ct. App. 2009).\n\n[¶22] A Montana district court granted further relief after an earlier declaration in a\nproperty boundary dispute between adjacent landowners. Goodover v. Lindey’s Inc., 843\nP.2d 765 (Mont. 1992). While the original declaratory judgment action was pending, one\nof the landowners placed improvements upon the land which was eventually declared to\nbelong to the other. Id. at 767-68. After the judgment was entered, the burdened\nlandowner brought an action for supplemental declaratory relief requesting the court to\norder removal of the encroachments and seeking damages for loss of use of the property.\nPursuant to its supplemental relief jurisdiction, the district court ordered the encroaching\nparty to submit a work plan detailing the removal of the encroachment and ordered that\nparty to pay damages to the burdened party. Id. at 768. The Montana Supreme Court\nupheld the district court’s actions and ruled that, under the Declaratory Judgments Act,\nthe district court retained jurisdiction to grant relief necessary to enforce its order. This\ncontinuing jurisdiction gave the court authority to grant monetary damages and order\ncoercive action to provide complete relief in the declaratory judgment action. Id. at 770.\n\n[¶23] The further relief provision of the Declaratory Judgments Act does, however, have\nlimitations. In Oklahoma Alcoholic Beverage Control Bd. v. Central Liquor Co., 421\nP.2d 244 (Okla. 1966), the Oklahoma Supreme Court considered whether the trial court\nhad jurisdiction under the further relief provision of the Declaratory Judgments Act to\naddress an entirely new issue that was not raised in the initial action. The court stated\nthat the further relief “provision was not intended to give the court continuing jurisdiction\nto resolve subsequent disputes between the parties over matters not involved in the\noriginal litigation.” Id. at 247. See also Port Everglades Authority v. International\nLongshoremen’s Assoc., Local 1922-1, 652 So.2d 1169 (Fla. Ct. App. 1995) (holding that\ntrial court’s retention of jurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgments Act was overly\nbroad because it extended well beyond the sunshine law violation originally alleged and\nruled upon in the original declaratory judgment action).\n\n[¶24] This precedent makes it abundantly clear that a district court maintains jurisdiction\nto consider and order further relief on matters addressed in a declaratory judgment action.\nAs a practical matter, if a court has no jurisdiction to enforce its declaratory judgment,\nthe judgment would have no true legal effect. A declaratory judgment is, by its nature,\nabstract. The purpose of the Declaratory Judgments Act is “to settle and to afford relief\nfrom uncertainty and insecurity with respect to legal relations, and [the Act] is to be\nliberally construed and administered.” Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 1-37-114. In order to serve the\npurposes of the act, the district court must have power to enforce its ruling when the\nparties actually put it into effect.\n\n                                             10\n\f[¶25] The defendants also claim the NPC is a divisible installment contract which\nrequires separate actions for different time periods. In Sagebrush Dev., Inc. v. Moehrke,\n604 P.2d 198, 204 (Wyo. 1979), this Court ruled prospective damages could not be\nawarded for future breaches of a contract requiring separate payments or performance;\ninstead, a separate action must be brought after the plaintiff has actually sustained the\ndamages. Here, the district court’s trial judgment awarded the plaintiffs NPI damages for\nthe time period of March 2006 through December 2006 and included a declaratory\njudgment that the defendants continue to account to the plaintiffs and make payments in\naccordance with the NPC. In the enforcement action, the district court determined\nwhether the pre-2007 expenses were, or should have been, included within the earlier\ntrial proceedings and the propriety of the defendants’ methods of complying with its\nongoing accounting requirements under the declaratory judgment.\n\n[¶26] Notably, the district court did not determine the amount of net profits due for any\nperiod after December 31, 2006, even though the plaintiffs presented evidence showing\nthe calculation of the post-trial NPI. The district court’s refusal to calculate the NPI in\nsubsequent periods was a proper recognition of the limits of its jurisdiction. See\ngenerally, Oklahoma Alcoholic Beverage and Port Everglades, supra. By limiting the\nscope of its post-judgment order, the district court also avoided a violation of the legal\nprinciples pertaining to installment or divisible contracts. The district court properly\ninterpreted its former judgment and supplemented the declaration contained therein.\n\n[¶27] One additional matter merits our attention before we leave the jurisdictional issue.\nThe defendants claim they were denied due process as a result of the plaintiffs’ failure to\ncommence a new action to address the issues raised in the motion to enforce. In\nparticular, they lament the absence of the procedures available under the rules of civil\nprocedure when a new action is commenced, including the discovery provisions. As our\ndescription of Wyoming precedent on motions to clarify and/or enforce judgments\nindicates, commencing a new action was not required. Section 1-37-110 provides that\nthe request for further relief be made by a petition to the district court which will, if\nappropriate, require the defendant to show cause why further relief should not be granted.\nNeither the plaintiffs nor the district court strictly followed the process set out in the\nstatute. Instead of filing a petition for further relief under the Declaratory Judgments Act,\nthe plaintiffs filed a motion to enforce the judgment and the district court did not issue an\norder to show cause.6\n\n\n6\n At one point, there was discussion of a possible order to show cause as to why the defendants should not\nbe held in contempt of court. The contempt process was later abandoned by the district court and the\nplaintiffs when they realized there was no factual basis for concluding the defendants had willfully\nviolated a clear term of a court order. See generally, Greene v. Finn, 2007 WY 47, ¶¶ 14-15, 153 P.3d\n945, 951 (Wyo. 2007).\n\n                                                   11\n\f[¶28] While it would have been preferable for the statutory procedure to be followed, the\nfailure did not impact the defendants’ procedural opportunities to contest the motion.\nThe defendants countered the plaintiffs’ motion to enforce with various responses; the\nparties conducted some discovery during the post-judgment proceedings, including taking\nthe experts’ depositions; and the district court held several hearings to address the\noutstanding matters. It should be noted that the defendants’ appellate argument\nsuggesting they needed the discovery protections offered by a new action ignores the fact\nthat the relevant accounting information was in their possession. Furthermore, the\ndefendants actually objected in 2011 to the plaintiffs’ efforts to obtain additional\ndiscovery in the post-judgment proceedings. Although the defendants make a vague\nargument that they did not receive adequate process, they do not demonstrate how their\ndue process rights to notice and the opportunity to be heard were violated.\n\n[¶29] Cases from other jurisdictions establish that “further relief” under the Declaratory\nJudgments Act may be granted through a variety of procedural mechanisms. In Juban v.\nSchermer, 751 A.2d 1190, 1191-92 (Pa. Super. 2000), the court entered a declaratory\njudgment on the validity of a land title transfer and the petitioner subsequently filed a\npetition seeking damages as a result of the respondent’s use of the property while the\ndeclaratory action was pending. Although the Pennsylvania statute set out a procedure\nsimilar to ours with a petition for further relief followed by an order to show cause, there\nis no indication that the trial court specifically issued an order to show cause. It appears\nthat the matter proceeded after the respondents objected to the petition. Id.\n\n[¶30] Some other states’ declaratory judgment statutes simply require reasonable notice\nand a hearing, without having the district court issue an order to show cause. See, e.g.,\nCasa Balcona and Horn, supra. There is no question that the defendants received notice\nand the opportunity to be heard in this case. We, therefore, conclude the district court\nhad jurisdiction to consider the specific issues presented in this matter under its inherent\nauthority to interpret and enforce its own judgment and the further relief provision of the\nDeclaratory Judgments Act.7 Section 1-37-110.\n\n               2. Pre-2007 Expenses/Timing of Expense Reporting\n\n[¶31] The next three issues all pertain to the district court’s interpretation of its judgment\nfrom the 2007 trial and the defendants’ ongoing NPC accounting responsibilities,\nparticularly the timing of expense reporting. The district court held an evidentiary\nhearing and set out its decision with findings of fact and conclusions of law. We,\ntherefore, review its findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard and its\nconclusions of law de novo.\n7\n  The parties stipulated the post-judgment proceedings would conclude after resolution of the pre-2007\nexpense issue. They agreed other issues pertaining to the accounting and calculation of the NPI from\nJanuary 1, 2007, forward would not be addressed in the motion to enforce proceedings but would be\nreserved for a future lawsuit.\n                                                 12\n\f                We do not substitute ourselves for the trial court as a\n                finder of facts; instead, we defer to the trial court’s\n                findings unless they are unsupported by the record or\n                erroneous as a matter of law. Deroche v. R.L. Manning\n                Co., 737 P.2d 332, 336 (Wyo.1987). Although the factual\n                findings of a trial court are not entitled to the limited\n                review afforded a jury verdict, the findings are\n                presumptively correct. Piroschak v. Whelan, 2005 WY 26,\n                ¶ 7, 106 P.3d 887, 890 (Wyo.2005).\n\n                   This Court may examine all of the properly admissible\n                evidence in the record, but we do not reweigh the\n                evidence. Forshee, et ux. v. Delaney, et ux., 2005 WY\n                103, ¶ 6, 118 P.3d 445, 448 (Wyo.2005). Due regard is\n                given to the opportunity of the trial judge to assess the\n                credibility of the witnesses. We accept the prevailing\n                party’s evidence as true and give to that evidence every\n                favorable inference which may fairly and reasonably be\n                drawn from it. Harber v. Jensen, 2004 WY 104, ¶ 7, 97\n                P.3d 57, 60 (Wyo.2004) (quoting Life Care Centers of\n                America, Inc. v. Dexter, 2003 WY 38, ¶ 7, 65 P.3d 385,\n                389 (Wyo.2003)). Findings may not be set aside because\n                we would have reached a different result.

A finding\n                will only be set aside if, although there is evidence to\n                support it, this Court on the entire evidence is left with the\n                definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been\n                committed.

The\ninformation used to calculate the NPI at trial was not provided by the defendants pursuant\nto timely reporting under the NPC but was, instead, provided in the litigation discovery\nprocess. The district court’s judgment, which was affirmed in all relevant respects by this\nCourt, included an award of net profits from March 2006 through December 2006.8 The\ndistrict court made a number of determinations as to what expenses were properly\ndeductible in calculating the NPI, generally relying upon the calculation performed by the\nplaintiffs’ expert accounting witness, David Johnson. In total, over $2 billion in expenses\nwere allowed as deductions in calculating the net profits at trial, including $888.4 million\nfor 2006. The excluded expenses included Ultra’s “accrual accounts” of $77,752,958 and\nShell’s accumulator accounts of $59,212,079.\n\n[¶34] Little was known about the accrual and accumulator accounts at trial. Mr.\nJohnson testified that he did not believe the expenses in the accounts were properly\ndeductible at the time of trial because Ultra represented the amounts in the accrual\naccounts were “estimates,” suggesting that no invoices had been received for the\nexpenses, and Shell indicated the expenses in the accumulator accounts could not be\nspecifically tied to NPI wells. The defendants did not provide any detail on the expenses\nincluded in the challenged accounts, so there was no evidence of the activity date (the\ndate the goods or services were provided to the operators), the invoice date, or the date of\npayment. Given the defendants’ characterization of the expenses in the accounts and the\nlack of information about them, the district court rejected the defendants’ efforts to\ndeduct the accrual and accumulator accounts from the revenues to determine the net\nprofit for trial. The defendants did not appeal the district court’s rejection of the accrual\nand accumulation accounts after the first trial and, consequently, we did not address that\nruling in Ultra I.\n\n\n\n\n8\n  Although net profits had been earned beginning in May 2005, the defendants were not obligated to pay\nthe plaintiffs until March 2006 because the plaintiffs did not give notice of their ownership of the NPI, as\nrequired by the NPC, until February 2006. Ultra I, ¶¶ 66-67, 73, 226 P.3d at 916-17.\n                                                     16\n\f[¶35] As we stated above in Paragraph 14, the district court also ruled after the 2007 trial\nthat the defendants were required to perform an ongoing “NPI accounting on a\nconsolidated basis and make payments monthly to the plaintiffs commencing with\nproduction month January 2007,” in accordance with the terms of the NPC and the\njudgment. After we affirmed the district court’s decision, the defendants provided\naccounting statements to the plaintiffs which indicated they were charging expenses with\nactivity dates prior to January 1, 2007 to the 2007 NPI accounting. When the plaintiffs\nquestioned the defendants about the pre-2007 expenses, the defendants claimed the\nexpenses were properly included in the 2007 accounting because they had been excluded\nfrom the trial accounting as accrual and accumulator accounts.\n\n[¶36] In a series of hearings on the plaintiffs’ motion to enforce starting in 2010 and\ncontinuing through April 2013, the parties argued about whether the expenses prior to\nJanuary 1, 2007, should be included in the 2007 accounting. The plaintiffs generally\nadvanced two arguments against including the pre-2007 expenses in the post-trial\naccounting. The first was that the trial in 2007 was intended to determine a complete NPI\naccounting through December 31, 2006, and the defendants were obligated to provide all\nof their pre-2007 expenses for deduction from the trial NPI. The plaintiffs’ second\nargument was the NPC required the defendants to report expenses within one month after\nthe month they were incurred. They argued that an expense was “incurred” for purposes\nof the NPC when it was invoiced by a third party supplier or service provider to the\noperators.\n\n[¶37] The defendants argued the invoice date was irrelevant and the pre-2007 expenses\nreported in the 2007 accounting were timely because they were reported to the NPI\nowners at the same time the operators billed them to the other working interest owners\nthrough the joint interest billing (JIB) process. In other words, according to the\ndefendants, expenses were “incurred” for NPC purposes when they were “jibbed.” The\ndefendants also argued the expenses were properly included in the 2007 accounting\nbecause the NPC envisioned a cumulative accounting which included all expenses from\ninception of the NPI forward.\n\n[¶38] The district court issued a detailed order on the plaintiffs’ motion to enforce. It\nreviewed the evidence and rulings from the trial and the evidence about the pre-2007\nexpenses produced in the post-judgment proceedings, interpreted its earlier judgment and\nthe relevant provisions of the NPC and ruled that all expenses which were invoiced\nbefore January 1, 2007 were excluded from the post-trial accounting. In general, the\ndistrict court agreed with the plaintiffs that the trial NPI determination was a full\naccounting of the NPI through December 31, 2006. The district court also found that an\nexpense was “incurred” under the NPC when it was invoiced. Applying this definition,\nthe district court decided that Section 3 of the NPC required the operators to charge\nexpenses to the NPI account within one month after the close of the calendar month in\nwhich the invoice was dated. Thus, the district court’s decision relies upon two legal\n\n                                            17\n\fconcepts—the finality of the trial judgment and the tardiness of the defendants’ expense\nreporting.\n\n[¶39] The trial judgment specifically stated net profits were awarded to the plaintiffs for\nthe period of March through December 2006. In its order on the motion to enforce, the\ndistrict court entered the following findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding the\nscope of the trial judgment:\n\n                     [Findings of Fact] 25.       Ultra and SWEPI did not\n             follow the NPC terms in reporting trial NPI expenses. The\n             individuals responsible for revenue and expense reporting\n             testified they were not familiar with, or guided by, the NPC\n             terms when they assembled and reported expense and revenue\n             information to the Plaintiffs for the 2007 trial.\n\n                    26. Witnesses for Ultra and SWEPI testified they\n             reported all NPI expenses for the trial calculation. SWEPI\n             witness, Jeannine Nieder, testified she instructed their experts\n             to include all accumulator accounts in the trial expenses,\n             including non-NPI wells, because she would rather include\n             them and have them challenged rather than exclude them and\n             lose some costs.\n             ....\n                    [Conclusions of Law] 2. Defendants were solely\n             responsible for the NPI expenses reported for the 2007 trial\n             calculation. To the extent Defendants incurred but failed to\n             properly present evidence of pre-2007 expenses at trial, they\n             are precluded by the Judgment from doing so in the NPI\n             accounting beginning January, 2007.\n\n[¶40] The district court specifically excluded the expenses in the accrual and\naccumulator accounts from the NPI accounting approved at trial and the defendants did\nnot appeal that decision. We discussed the preclusive effect of a party’s failure to appeal\na decision in Triton Coal Co. v. Husman, Inc., 846 P.2d 664, 667-68 (Wyo. 1993) and\nnoted that, while the legal concept that a non-appealed issue is final may be part of the\nlaw of the case doctrine, it is more correctly classified as a type of waiver:\n\n                  Under the “law of the case” doctrine, a court’s decision on\n             an issue of law made at one stage of a case becomes a binding\n             precedent to be followed in successive stages of the same\n             litigation. 1B JAMES W. MOORE, JO DESHA LUCAS &\n             THOMAS S. CURRIER, MOORE'S FEDERAL PRACTICE\n             ¶ 0.404[1] (2d ed. 1983). The “law of the case” is a doctrine\n\n                                            18\n\fdesigned to avoid repetitious litigation and to promote\nconsistent decision making. As such, it is in the same family\nas res judicata, collateral estoppel, and stare decisis. In their\ntreatise, Professors Wright, Miller, and Cooper identify four\nsituations in which the “law of the case” may arise. 18\nCHARLES ALAN WRIGHT, ARTHUR R. MILLER &\nEDWARD H. COOPER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND\nPROCEDURE § 4478 (1981). Most commonly, the “law of\nthe case” requires a trial court to adhere to its own prior\nrulings, adhere to the rulings of an appellate court, or adhere\nto another judge’s rulings in the same case or a closely related\ncase. Id. Triton, however, relies upon a fourth and much less\nutilized aspect of the rule in which a court’s ruling on an issue\nthat could have been appealed, but was not, will be given\npreclusive effect. Tom Beuchler Construction, Inc. v. City of\nWilliston, 413 N.W.2d 336, 339 (N.D.1987). Although some\ncourts label this fourth category as the “law of the case,” it is\nsomething of a misfit. Generally, the “law of the case” arises\nbecause a court has ruled on a matter and that ruling is to be\napplied to subsequent proceedings in the litigation. However,\nin the fourth category relied upon by Triton, it is the litigant’s\nfailure to raise an issue on appeal which gives rise to the\npreclusive effect of the lower court’s ruling, not a court\nruling. Allan D. Vestal, Law of the Case: Single–Suit\nPreclusion, 11 UTAH L.REV. 1 (1967). The underlying\nrationale of the fourth category of the “law of the case” is that\na litigant can argue to an appellate court only those issues\nwhich he raised on appeal. Id. at 21. The idea that a litigant is\nlimited to arguing those issues he raised on appeal is, in\nessence, the concept of waiver.\n\n   The general rule concerning waiver is:\n\n[Q]uestions assigned as error are deemed to have been\nabandoned or waived where they are not urged or discussed\non appeal by brief or argument, or are not sufficiently so\ndiscussed; and the same rule applies to cross errors. 5B\nC.J.S. Appeal and Error § 1803 at 98 (1958). This Court has\nconsistently applied this long-standing rule in prior cases.\nDworkin v. L.F.P., Inc., 839 P.2d 903 (Wyo.1992); Schaffer\nv. Standard Timber Company, 79 Wyo. 137, 331 P.2d 611\n(1958).\n\n\n                               19\n\fApplying the waiver concept in the case at bar, the defendants waived any objection to\nthe district court’s determination that the accrual and accumulator accounts could not be\nincluded in the trial net profit calculation because they did not appeal that aspect of the\ndecision.\n\n[¶41] With regard to the completeness of the trial accounting, the district court stated the\nwitnesses for Ultra and SWEPI testified they reported all NPI expenses for the trial\ncalculation. These findings are supported by the record. Jeannine Nieder, Shell’s\nfinancial representative for its Rocky Mountain assets, testified she was responsible for\ngathering information about the NPI for the 2007 trial calculation and admitted she did\nnot use the NPC to guide her in determining what expenses to include. She repeatedly\nstated that she “included all expense items” up through December 31, 2006, for the NPI\ncalculation. The accumulator accounts prepared under her direction included expenses\nthat she believed were at least partially allocable to NPI wells and leases, but, at the time\nof trial, she was not sure.\n\n[¶42] After the trial, SWEPI started compiling information to meet its NPC reporting\nrequirements. The March 2007 expenses reported by SWEPI were unusually high,\nincluding $43 million of pre-2007 expenses. Contrary to SWEPI’s representation of the\nnature of the accumulator account expenses at trial, the district court found in the post-\njudgment order that at least some of the expenses could have been allocated to the NPI\nwells prior to trial:\n\n                     18. SWEPI disclosed its March, 2007 expenses\n              were abnormally high because $43 million in pre-2007\n              expenses from the accumulator account was charged to NPI\n              wells in March, 2007. SWEPI charged certain of the\n              accumulator expenses to NPI wells prior to trial but did not\n              report the accumulator expenses as incurred expenses.\n              SWEPI records reflect the accumulator expenses were\n              invoiced prior to January 1, 2007.\n\nThe defendants do not establish this factual finding was clearly erroneous.\n\n[¶43] At the hearing on the motion to enforce, Ms. Nieder testified about the process\nSWEPI used in early 2007 to move the pre-2007 expenses from the accumulator accounts\nto the NPI account. She was questioned as to why the amounts in the accumulator\naccounts invoiced prior to December 31, 2006, had not been reported as incurred NPI\nexpenses for the October 2007 trial. Ms. Nieder stated SWEPI had not finished its NPI\naccounting so, even though the expenses could have been charged to NPI wells prior to\ntrial, they were just put in an accumulator account.\n\n\n\n                                             20\n\f[¶44] Kristen Marron, Ultra’s controller until April 2007, testified at her June 2007\ndeposition that she had been instructed to compile all accounting data for the relevant\nleases. She stated that she had provided all revenue and expense information “as\nrequested.” Ms. Marron testified the trial data included all costs to “drill and complete\nthe wells,” lease operating expenses, and the G & A (general and administrative costs)\nallocation. She stated the only expenses excluded were those that did not pertain to the\nrelevant wells. Mr. Johnson later testified that he had understood from Ms. Marron’s\ndeposition in June 2007 that “all expenses were provided.”\n\n[¶45] As the district court noted, the trial accounting was meant to be final through\nDecember 2006. Given the defendants were the only parties with access to the expense\ninformation and the parties understood the trial accounting was final through December\n2006, the defendants should have provided all expenses applicable to the NPI leases\nthrough the end of 2006 for determination of the NPI at trial. A reasonable inference\nfrom the evidence presented at the post-judgment hearing is that the defendants simply\nfailed to perform their accounting obligations and did not properly identify and report all\nof the pre-2007 expenses for trial. Having failed to report the expenses for trial, the\ndefendants sought to include them in a later accounting period without regard for the\nfinality of the pre-2007 accounting or the trial judgment.9 The district court’s findings as\nto the scope of the trial accounting are supported by the record. It properly concluded\nthat all expenses deductible from the NPI calculation for 2006 should have been included\nin the defendants’ trial evidence.\n\n[¶46] The defendants argue that since the expenses were not allowed at the trial, they\nshould be allowed in the post-trial NPI calculations. This argument requires us to assume\nthe excluded accrual and accumulator accounts were the same pre-2007 expenses they\nnow seek to include in the 2007 accounting. The defendants did not make a clear\nconnection between the trial accrual accounts and the pre-2007 expenses they sought to\ninclude in the 2007 accounting at the post-judgment hearings. The most obvious\ndifference is the amounts did not match. The excluded trial expenses included $77.7\nmillion in Ultra’s accrual accounts and $59.2 million in SWEPI accumulator accounts,\nwhile the expenses at issue in the post-trial accounting with activity dates before January\n1, 2007, included $60.8 million for Ultra and $70.5 million for SWEPI.\n\n[¶47] During the post-judgment proceedings, Ultra’s controller Garland Shaw10 was\nasked about the relationship between the $77.7 million in Ultra’s accrual account that was\n\n9\n  Furthermore, some of the pre-2007 expenses claimed by Shell in its 2007 NPI accounting did not even\npertain to NPI wells, even though they had supposedly been confirmed as expenses allocable to the NPI in\nthe post-trial accounting process.\n10\n  Mr. Shaw testified that he started as Ultra’s corporate controller in October 2006. Apparently there was some\noverlap between Mr. Shaw’s and Ms. Marron’s tenures, as she testified that she was Ultra’s controller until March\n2007.\n\n                                                      21\n\fexcluded from the trial accounting and the $60.8 million of pre-2007 expenses that Ultra\nwas seeking to deduct from the post-trial NPI calculation. He confirmed there was no\ndirect correlation between the amounts and stated, “we’re sort of talking about apples and\noranges when we talk about the 60 million and we talk about the 77 million.” When\nasked whether Ultra could have tied the pre-2007 expenses currently in dispute to the\naccruals excluded at trial, Mr. Shaw stated they “could have made a determination” but\nthey did not because “[t]here’s no reason to do that. The accruals were disallowed at\ntrial.” The amounts in the trial accrual accounts were not supported by source\ndocuments, which would have shown detail such as the activity date, invoice date or\npayment date. Therefore, the defendants’ current argument that it was wrong to exclude\nthe former accrual expenses from the post-trial accounting after they had been excluded\nat trial is not supported by the record because there was no evidence the trial accrual\nexpenses were the same as the pre-2007 expenses the defendants wish to include in the\n2007 accounting.\n\n[¶48] The district court also relied upon the terms of the NPC in excluding from the\n2007 NPI accounting expenses that were incurred prior to December 31, 2006. To\nreiterate, Paragraph 98 of the judgment states:\n\n             The defendants remain obligated to and shall perform the\n             required NPI accounting on a consolidated basis and make\n             payments monthly to the plaintiffs commencing with\n             production month January 2007, and shall do so in\n             accordance with the terms of the Net Profits Contract and its\n             Accounting Procedure.\n\n[¶49] The contractual provision establishing the deadline for the operators to report\nexpenses to the net profit owners is located in Section 3 of the NPC and states:\n\n                 Within one (1) month after the close of each calendar\n                 month, Operator shall furnish to Novi a statement of costs\n                 and expenses incurred and charges made and all receipts\n                 and credits received during such calendar month.\n\nUnder this provision and others in the contract, the proper time for charging an expense\nto the NPI is when it is “incurred” by the operator.\n\n[¶50] The plaintiffs argued, and the district court agreed, an expense is incurred under\nthe contract when a third party provides an invoice for goods or services related to the\nNPI leases to the operator. The defendants argued, however, that a cost is incurred for\nNPC purposes when it was billed to the joint interest partners in a JIB or, in other words,\n“jibbed.” We apply our typical rules of contract interpretation to this issue.\n\n\n                                            22\n\f             The initial question of whether the contract is capable of\n             being understood in only one way is a question of law for the\n             court. If the court determines that the contract is capable of\n             being understood in only one way, then the language used in\n             the contract expresses and controls the intent of the parties. In\n             such case, the next question, what is that understanding or\n             meaning, is also a question of law. . . .\n\n             M & M Auto Outlet v. Hill Inv.

The plain and ordinary\nmeaning of “incur” is: “to become liable or subject to: bring down upon oneself <incur\nexpenses>” Merriam-Webster Dictionary 250 (2005). See also Fix v. Forelle, 2014 WY\n79, ¶ 17, 327 P.3d 745, 749 (Wyo. 2014) (defining incur with dictionary definition). The\nusual understanding of when a party becomes liable or subject to an actual expense is\nwhen a third party vendor or service provider gives notice of the amount charged and\nwhen payment is due. That information is commonly communicated with an invoice or a\nbill.\n\n[¶53] The district court accepted the common usage when it rejected the defendants’\nposition that an expense is incurred when it is “jibbed” and, instead, adopted the\nplaintiffs’ argument that the invoice date is the date of incurrence:\n\n                    21. The appropriate date for when an expense is\n             incurred for purposes of the NPI accounting is the date of an\n             invoice for work or material provided on a NPI well or lease.\n             The invoice date provides an operator with the date of a\n\n                                            23\n\f             charge by a third party for work performed or materials\n             furnished for a NPI well. The invoice also provides the\n             operator with a sum to be paid and the date payment is due.\n\n                     28. The NPC does not contemplate expense\n             reporting based on the operators’ discretionary internal\n             accounting process after an invoice has been received, after it\n             has been approved for payment, and when it is reflected on a\n             joint interest billing to the working interest owners in a NPI\n             well. Such a procedure could result in posting an expense to\n             the NPI account several months after the expense was\n             incurred.\n\nThe district court explained that adopting the invoice date as the date of incurrence is\nconsistent with the contract language and is “a workable standard. Utilizing the invoice\ndate reduces uncertainty and further reduces the opportunity for manipulation of the NPI\naccount as to the timing of charges to the NPI account.”\n\n[¶54] The defendants assert the district court’s interpretation of the contract language\nignores other provisions of the NPC including the provisions referencing expenses that\nare “reasonable and customary” and “properly chargeable against the leasehold interest”\nin Section 2 of the contract and the cumulative nature of the NPC accounting set out in\nSection 3. The “reasonable and customary” and “properly chargeable” language is part\nof the definition of expenses in Section 2. It describes the scope of the expenses to be\nincluded in the NPI calculation and does not address the timing of the reporting\nrequirement. The deadline for reporting expenses is set out in the “incurred” language of\nSection 3. The defendants are correct that Section 3 of the NPC requires calculation of\nthe net profits on the basis of cumulative revenues and expenses over the life of the\ncontract. That does not mean, however, the defendants were free to disregard the timing\nprovisions of the contract. The contract requires the operators to report the expenses to\nthe net profit interest owners within one month after the month an expense is invoiced.\n\n[¶55] The district court’s interpretation that the defendants are obligated to charge\nexpenses to the NPI within the NPC’s deadline gives full effect to all of the terms of the\ncontract and accurately reflects the rulings from the trial judgment. The defendants\nwould have received the benefit of the cumulative accounting for expenses had they\nreported them to the plaintiffs within the contract timeline. As the district court\nrecognized, if the operators can decide when a cost is incurred by picking the time to\ninclude it on the JIB, the net profit interest, which is payable in any month that shows a\nnet profit, would be subject to manipulation and the reporting deadlines would essentially\nbe meaningless. There would be no reason for the contract to require the operators to\nreport on a monthly basis if they can decide when to apply the expenses using the JIB\nprocess.\n\n                                           24\n\f[¶56] The district court also properly considered the circumstances surrounding the\nexecution of the NPC in 1954 in determining that the original parties did not intend to use\nthe JIB date as the date of incurrence. As we have stated before, even when a contract is\nunambiguous, evidence of the circumstances surrounding its execution may be\nconsidered to determine the parties’ intent. “Relevant considerations may include the\nrelationship of the parties, the subject matter of the contract, and the parties’ purpose in\nmaking the contract.” Davidson, ¶ 14, 247 P.3d at 72, quoting Ecosystem Res., L.C. v.\nBroadbent Land & Res., L.L.C., 2007 WY 87, ¶ 10, 158 P.3d 685, 688 (Wyo. 2007). The\ndistrict court explained:\n\n                     29. At the time the NPC was negotiated and executed,\n              El Paso was the original operator of the subject properties.\n              Continental and MALCO were non-operating working\n              interest owners. Had the parties intended to provide that an\n              expense is incurred for the NPI accounting based on when the\n              operator decided to charge the joint interest owners, they\n              could have done so, but they did not.\n\nIn other words, the contracting parties were familiar with the JIB process but did not\nexpressly incorporate that accounting time into the NPC terms. Instead, the original\nparties adopted a reporting deadline based upon when the operator incurs an expense, i.e.,\nwhen an expense is invoiced, thereby making the recipient liable for the amount due.\n\n[¶57] The arbitrariness of using the JIB date as the date of incurrence was aptly\ndemonstrated in Ms. Nieder’s testimony about Shell’s method of expense reporting. She\nactually agreed with plaintiffs’ counsel at the March 2013 hearing that when Shell\nreceived an invoice it had incurred an expense. However, she testified Shell’s charge\nagainst the NPI did not follow the “incurrence” language.\n\n                     Q. . . . So your classification of inclusion in the net\n              profits is something other than an incurrence of an expense?\n              Are we to understand that?\n\n                      A.    That’s correct.\n\nMs. Neider stated that her understanding of the NPC was that a charge is “billable to the\nNPI when that charge is posted to a well associated with the NPI,” as part of the JIB\nprocess. She confirmed that the operator was in charge of posting the expenses and\nstated the following with regard to the timing of the posting:\n\n              Q.     [I]s it typical that the posting happens in the month\n              following the expense being incurred?\n\n                                              25\n\f              A.    It could happen in the month following.           It could\n              happen subsequent to that.\n\n              Q.     So whatever time that is, a month, two months, three\n              months, it’s your opinion, what you’re offering as opinion is\n              that’s when it gets charged to the net profits account?\n\n              A.      Yes.\n\nUltra’s financial witness, Mr. Shaw, also admitted that “[a]ccording to the true definition\nof what is incurred,” an expense is incurred when invoiced.\n\n[¶58] Notwithstanding the plain meaning of the contract language, Ultra and SWEPI\nassert that the plaintiffs agreed to use the JIB date as the date to charge expenses to the\nnet profits account, the district court confirmed that agreement, and the plaintiffs should,\ntherefore, be bound under the principles of judicial estoppel, collateral estoppel and/or the\nlaw of the case. Application of these principles are matters of law; consequently, our\nreview is de novo. Tarver v. City of Sheridan Bd. of Adjustments, 2014 WY 71, ¶¶ 10-\n11, 327 P.3d 76, 80 (Wyo. 2014). We provided a comprehensive definition of judicial\nestoppel in Bredthauer v. TSP, 864 P.2d 442, 445 (Wyo. 1993) as:\n\n                   a doctrine which estops a party to play fast and loose with\n                   the courts or to trifle with judicial proceedings. It is an\n                   expression of the maxim that one cannot blow hot and\n                   cold in the same breath. A party will just not be allowed to\n                   maintain inconsistent positions in judicial proceedings * *\n                   *.\n\n              Allen [v.

In\n              [Matter of Paternity of] JRW, [814 P.2d 256 (Wyo. 1991)] we\n              stated that under the doctrine of judicial estoppel:\n\n                   “[A] party who by his pleadings, statements or\n                   contentions, under oath, has assumed a particular position\n                   in a judicial proceeding is estopped to assume an\n                   inconsistent position in a subsequent action.”\n\n                JRW, 814 P.2d at 1265–66 (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary\n               761 (5th ed. 1979)).\n\n[¶59] As we mentioned earlier, the law of the case doctrine guards the consistency of\njudicial decisions and states that “a court’s decision on an issue of law at one stage of a\n\n                                             26\n\fproceeding is binding in successive stages of the litigation.” Lieberman v. Mossbrook,\n2009 WY 65, ¶ 28, 208 P.3d 1296, 1305 (Wyo. 2009), citing Triton, 846 P.2d at 667.\nSimilarly, collateral estoppel is a preclusion doctrine that bars the relitigation of\npreviously litigated issues. Tarver, ¶¶ 10-11, 327 P.3d at 80.\n\n[¶60] The defendants direct us to two instances they say demonstrate the plaintiffs and\ndistrict court adopted the JIB date as the date of incurrence. The first is a November 23,\n2010, letter from plaintiffs’ counsel to defendants’ counsel complaining about the\noperators’ failure to provide complete accounting information. The letter began: “We are\nnear the end of 2010 and the companies responsible for accounting for the [NPI] have not\ncompleted the accounting for 2007-2008.” To move the accounting process forward, the\nplaintiffs attached a one-page proposed procedure for NPI reporting. The proposal\ncontained a broad outline of what information should be included in monthly revenue and\nexpense reports. It also provided that each company would designate a representative to\nact as a contact for the plaintiffs to obtain additional information. The basic NPI revenue\ninformation identified in the proposal included well identification, volumes of oil and gas\nproduced and gross revenues. Their proposal for NPI expense information was even less\ndetailed, stating only: “Lease Operating Expenses and capital expenditures charged to\njoint account by operators on Joint Interest Bills on NP wells.” (Emphasis in original).\n\n[¶61] The district court rejected the defendants’ claim that the letter amounted to an\nagreement to use the JIB date as the date of incurrence, and its finding is supported by the\nrecord. The November 2010 proposal included only general outlines of the information\nthat should be included in the monthly reporting. It specifically noted that other\nresources should be made available to the plaintiffs as part of the accounting process,\nincluding source documents and a contact person at each company so the plaintiffs could\nrequest additional information. When questioned about the effect of the November 2010\nproposal, the plaintiffs’ expert testified that the reference to the JIB expenses did not\npertain to the timing of the expense reporting but rather what expenses should be\nincluded in the reports. In a later letter dated February 8, 2011, plaintiffs’ counsel stated\nthat, under the NPC, the defendants were obligated to report expenses “within 30 days\nafter the calendar month when they are incurred.” Clearly, the 2010 proposed accounting\nprocedure was not an express adoption by the plaintiffs of the JIB date as the date of\nincurrence for NPC expense reporting.\n\n[¶62] The second piece of evidence the defendants assert shows the plaintiffs and district\ncourt adopted the JIB date as the date of incurrence is the NPI reporting statement, which\nwas stipulated to by the plaintiffs and approved by the district court. The NPI reporting\nstatement was actually a series of seven forms showing various expense and revenue\nsummaries about the NPI wells on a monthly basis.\n\n[¶63] The record does not support the defendants’ claim that the plaintiffs and district\ncourt adopted the JIB date as the date of incurrence when the NPI reporting statement\n\n                                             27\n\fwas agreed upon and approved. Two of the forms included in the approved statement\nrefer to the JIB dates, but the other five do not. The approved monthly statement includes\nonly general summaries of expenses and revenues. The defendants are also providing\nsource documents to the plaintiffs, which include other details about the expenses like the\ninvoice dates. Although the information about when expenses were jibbed presumably\nassists the parties in tracking the expenses, the statement contains no express adoption of\nthe JIB date as the date expenses are incurred under the NPC. The defendants do not\ndirect us to any evidence in the record showing that the parties intended to change the\nplain meaning of the contract language by adopting the NPI reporting statement.\nFurthermore, the district court’s order approving the NPI statement says nothing about\nwhen costs are incurred for purposes of the NPC reporting deadline.\n\n[¶64] Without a more definitive statement that the parties and the court intended to rely\non the JIB date as the date of incurrence, we certainly cannot say the district court’s\ndecision that no such agreement existed was clearly erroneous. Given there was no\nagreement or order requiring use of the JIB date as the date of incurrence under the NPC,\nthe preclusion and equitable doctrines of judicial estoppel, collateral estoppel, and/or law\nof the case do not apply.\n\n[¶65] Finally, the defendants claim the district court’s order creates an improper\nforfeiture and the exclusion of the expenses is unfair and inequitable. Their forfeiture\nargument is misplaced. The law does not favor forfeiture of contract rights, see, e.g.,\nReynolds v. Milatzo, 2007 WY 104, ¶ 15, 161 P.3d 509, 513 (Wyo. 2007); however, this\ncase does not involve a true forfeiture of contract rights. Instead, we are concerned with\nconcepts of judgment finality and interpretation of the scope of the judgment and the\nterms of the NPC help guide that interpretation. The defendants had a fair opportunity to\npresent their expenses at trial and either did not do so or mischaracterized the nature of\nthe expenses.\n\n[¶66] The defendants also argue that the district court’s order will result in a forfeiture of\nany future (or post-2006) expenses which are not reported within the time limits of the\nNPC. We do not read the order that way and neither do the plaintiffs. The court did not\nmake any express ruling on what remedies would be proper for future violations of the\ncontract reporting requirements. The plaintiffs state in their brief:\n\n              [Ultra] complains that under the Judgment, if defendants do\n              not charge an expense in the first report following the month\n              in which the expense is incurred, it is forever forfeited. The\n              Order Regarding Pre-2007 Expenses does not compel that\n              result. Defendants would be entitled to normal adjustments\n              of the NPI account for the period beginning January 2007, for\n              these accounts are not subject to the finality of a Judgment.\n\n\n                                             28\n\fThey reiterated this position at oral argument. The plaintiffs properly recognize that the\norder at issue in this case was based upon the dual considerations of finality of the trial\njudgment and interpretation of the terms of the NPC.\n\n[¶67] The defendants’ argument that the district court’s decision was unfair and\ninequitable also rings hollow for other reasons. There were actually $131 million in\nexpenses at issue in the post-judgment proceedings. The district court carefully\nconsidered the expenses using the December 31, 2006, invoice date as the cutoff. It\ndisallowed approximately $102 million in expenses, but allowed expenses of\napproximately $29 million that were invoiced later. The district court’s thorough review\nof the proposed expenses supports its decision and undermines the defendants’ fairness\narguments.\n\n[¶68] Furthermore, although the plaintiffs and the district court were led to believe at\ntrial that Ultra’s accrual accounts contained only estimates, the post-trial information\nshowed that the majority of the expenses had actually been invoiced and, in many\ninstances, paid prior to December 31, 2006. In fact, some of the pre-2007 expenses the\ndefendants wanted to include in the 2007 accounting had been invoiced and paid several\nyears before. If the trial accrual amounts had truly been field estimates, the actual\namounts would have been invoiced later and would have been proper 2007 deductions.\n\n[¶69] The defendants persistently argue that interpreting the NPC to require them to\nreport expenses in the month after they are invoiced imposes an unduly heavy burden\nupon them. They insist it is easier to report to the NPI owners at the same time they bill\ntheir joint interest partners. Perhaps that is true; however, that is not what the NPC\nrequires.11 We are not at liberty to amend or modify a contract under the guise of\ninterpretation. Fayard v. Design Committee of the Homestead Subdivision, 2010 WY 51,\n¶ 18, 230 P.3d 299, 304 (Wyo. 2010), citing Brumbaugh v. Mikelson Land Co., 2008 WY\n66, ¶ 28, 185 P.3d 695, 704 (Wyo. 2008). Additionally, we note that oil and gas\nleaseholders and operators are subject to different reporting and payment deadlines under\n11\n  Although the parties do not address this development, we note that they agreed in a February 25, 2013, document\nentitled, “Stipulation Concerning Remaining Post-Judgment Issues and March 5-6, 2013 Hearing” as follows:\n\n        2.      Operator Defendants shall continue to provide the information concerning the Novi\n        account that was ordered by the Court in its “Order Approving Monthly Net Profits Reporting\n        Forms” dated December 17, 2012.\n\n        3.       Plaintiffs have raised issues regarding the [Operator] Defendants’ alleged non compliance\n        with the timing of the monthly NPI report as provided in Section 3 of the [NPC]. [Operator]\n        Defendants agree that, beginning with production month February 2013, the Defendants will\n        provide Plaintiffs with the approved monthly reporting form and supporting documents within\n        ninety (90) days from the last of the production month. For instance, the monthly NPI report for\n        February 2013 production month, March 2013 NPI month, would be due on or before May 31,\n        2013.\n\n\n\n                                                       29\n\fvarious statutes and contracts, including federal mineral royalties, state severance taxes,\nthe WRPA, joint interest billing, etc. The NPC simply imposed an additional reporting\nrequirement upon the operators. There is nothing inherently unfair or unconscionable\nabout that. The district court aptly addressed the defendants’ argument:\n\n                     A consistent theme from the Defendants with respect\n              to the accounting requirements of the net profits interest is\n              the requirements are impractical and difficult to comply with\n              given their current business practices. The Court observes\n              the Defendants have made enormous profits from operations\n              on the leases subject to the net profits interest. Their\n              obligation is to conform their accounting procedures to\n              accommodate their contractual and Court ordered obligations\n              under the provisions of the net profits contract not the net\n              profits contract to their accounting procedures and business\n              practices.\n\n[¶70] This statement by the district court also applies to another equitable argument\npropounded by the defendants. They emphasize the large amount of money invested in\nthe leases for which they did not receive credit and argue the plaintiffs received a\nwindfall of approximately $102 million. That is, of course, an enormous amount of\nmoney. However, the defendants’ argument disregards the context. The amount of\nmoney changing hands as a result of the NPI leases is almost unfathomable. At the trial,\nthe court was considering total expenses of over $2 billion and even greater revenues.\nUltra I, ¶ 16, 226 P.3d at 904. The parties indicate those amounts have grown\nconsiderably in the ensuing years. The $102 million in expenses is but a small fraction of\nthe totals. Also, it is important to keep in mind that the NPI is concerned with slightly\nless than five percent of the total revenues and expenses, so the actual amount which the\ndefendants lost in deductions was only approximately $5 million out of the more than $2\nbillion total trial expenses. Ultra I, ¶ 11, 226 P.3d at 902-03. Finally, the defendants\nshould keep in mind that without the original assignment of the leases by the plaintiffs’\npredecessors in exchange for the net profit interest, they would not have acquired the\nleases in the first place. Id., ¶ 3, 226 P.3d at 899. The defendants simply have not\nconvinced this Court that the result in this case is inequitable or unfair.\n\n              3. Attorney Fees\n\n[¶71] Wyoming follows the American rule on attorney fees which states that each party\nis responsible for its own attorney fees unless there is express contractual or statutory\nauthority for an award of fees. Ultra I, ¶ 151, 226 P.3d at 936; Stafford v. JHL, Inc., 2008\nWY 128, ¶ 16, 194 P.3d 315, 318 (Wyo. 2008). The remedy provisions of the WRPA are\nbroad and provide:\n\n\n                                            30\n\f              (a) Any lessee or operator, purchaser or other party legally\n              responsible for payment who violates the provisions of this\n              article is liable to the person or persons legally entitled to\n              proceeds from production for the unpaid amount of such\n              proceeds, plus interest at the rate of eighteen percent (18%)\n              per annum on the unpaid principal balance from the due date\n              specified in W.S. 30-5-301(a).\n\n              (b) The district court for the county in which a well producing\n              oil, gas or related hydrocarbons is located has jurisdiction\n              over all proceedings brought pursuant to this article and the\n              prevailing party in any proceedings brought pursuant to this\n              article shall be entitled to recover all court costs and\n              reasonable attorney’s fees.\n\n              (c) Any person who fails to provide royalty information as\n              provided in W.S. 30-5-305(b) is liable to the affected royalty,\n              overriding royalty or other nonworking interest owner in the\n              amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month that\n              complete reporting is not provided to the interest owner.\n\nWyo. Stat. Ann. § 30-5-303 (LexisNexis 2013).\n\n[¶72] The defendants argue the district court’s order awarding attorney fees to the\nplaintiffs was erroneous. Their first argument depends upon a reversal by this Court of\nthe district court’s rulings on jurisdiction or its interpretation of the NPC. In that event,\nthe defendants maintain, they would be the prevailing parties and, consequently, entitled\nto an award of attorney fees. Given we have affirmed the district court’s rulings on those\nissues, the defendants are not entitled to an attorney fees award.\n\n[¶73] The defendants also claim that even if the plaintiffs were entitled to an attorney\nfees award, the district court erred by allowing the plaintiffs’ entire request. We review a\ndistrict court’s attorney fees award for abuse of discretion.\n\n                A court abuses its discretion only when it acts in a manner\n                which exceeds the bounds of reason under the\n                circumstances. The burden is placed upon the party who is\n                attacking the trial court's ruling to establish an abuse of\n                discretion, and the ultimate issue is whether the court could\n                reasonably conclude as it did.\n\n                We have said that “[j]udicial discretion is a composite of\n                many things, among which are conclusions drawn from\n\n                                             31\n\f                objective criteria; it means a sound judgment exercised\n                with regard to what is right under the circumstances and\n                without doing so arbitrarily or capriciously.” If the record\n                includes sufficient evidence to support the district court's\n                exercise of discretion, we uphold its decision.\n\n              [Mueller v. Zimmer, 2007 WY 195, ¶ 11, 173 P.3d 361, 364\n              (Wyo. 2007)], quoting Hayzlett v. Hayzlett, 2007 WY 147, ¶\n              7, 167 P.3d 639, 641–42 (Wyo.2007) (internal citations\n              omitted).\n\nUltra I, ¶ 149, 226 P.3d at 935.\n\n[¶74] The defendants assert the district court abused its discretion by failing to require\nthe plaintiffs to segregate their fees between the WRPA claims they prevailed upon and\nother claims. In the post-judgment proceedings, the plaintiffs initially requested the\ndistrict court award them fees of $1,177,305.50. The defendants evaluated the plaintiffs’\nattorney fees submission and determined that only 641.9 hours, valued at $189,620, were\nproperly awardable to the plaintiffs under the WRPA. The district court did not require\nthe plaintiffs to segregate the fees and awarded the plaintiffs their full attorney fees\nrequest.\n\n[¶75] In general, “[s]egregation of fees between multiple clients and/or multiple claims\nis required when it is possible.” Cline v. Rocky Mountain, Inc., 998 P.2d 946, 952 (Wyo.\n2000). However, we explained in Ultra I, ¶¶ 153, 226 P.3d at 936:\n\n              Section 30–5–303(b) provides that the prevailing party “in\n              any proceedings brought pursuant to this article” is entitled to\n              a fee award. The plain meaning of the term “proceedings” is\n              broad, especially when phrased in the plural. Black's Law\n              Dictionary 1324 (9th ed.2009) defines “proceeding” as “[t]he\n              regular and orderly progression of a lawsuit, including all acts\n              and events between the time of commencement and the entry\n              of judgment. Similarly, Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary\n              1807 (2002) defines “proceeding” in the context of law as\n              “[l]egal action; litigation.”\n\nIn Ultra I, ¶ 157, 266 P.3d at 937, we rejected the defendants’ claim that the plaintiffs\nwere entitled to fees only for the discrete WRPA claims. We concluded that many of the\nclaims for which the defendants sought segregation were inextricably intertwined with\ntheir WRPA claims. Id., citing City of Gillette v. Hladky Constr., Inc., 2008 WY 134, ¶\n110, 196 P.3d 184, 212 (Wyo. 2008).\n\n\n                                            32\n\f[¶76] Ultra asserts the plaintiffs were only entitled to fees associated with two post-\njudgment issues, the pre-2007 expenses and division expenses. According to Ultra, fees\nshould not have been allowed for the plaintiffs’ abandoned or unsuccessful efforts to:\nobtain broader access to the defendants’ accounting documents; obtain access to\ndocuments from a former defendant who ultimately settled; obtain a determination of the\nfair market value of SWEPI’s gas because that issue was not finally decided; and enforce\nthe Supplemental Accounting Agreement.\n\n[¶77] Diverging from Ultra on this issue, SWEPI argues the plaintiffs were entitled to an\naward against it only as to the pre-2007 expense issue because SWEPI never tried to\ninclude division expenses in its post-trial NPI calculations. SWEPI also claims the\ndistrict court abused its discretion by failing to exclude from the award fees pertaining to\ngeneral investigation, evaluation of monthly NPI reports, and entries related to\ncorrespondence with non-parties, including those with whom the plaintiffs settled.\n\n[¶78] The district court ruled the WRPA applied to the post-judgment proceedings, the\nplaintiffs were the prevailing parties, and they were entitled to an award of reasonable\nattorney fees and costs. The district court rejected the defendants’ argument that the\nplaintiffs were required to segregate their fees related to the discrete WRPA issues,\nexplaining:\n\n                       The Court believes defendants have misapprehended\n               the language of the WRPA and misapplied the obligation to\n               segregate fees and expenses among defendants and/or claims.\n               The Court agrees with plaintiffs[’] characterization of the\n               proceedings related to their motion, specifically that all issues\n               (i.e. claims) in the current matter before the Court, and on\n               appeal,12 relate to a common nexus, a common cause, that\n               being to enforce their judgment and the requirement that the\n               defendants properly account for and pay the net profits\n               interest pursuant to the Court’s judgment and the Net Profits\n               Contract. In this endeavor, they were the prevailing party in\n               that they improved their position markedly in terms of the\n               accounting procedures and reporting requirements and in the\n               proper calculation of the amount ultimately due. In this\n               respect the Court agrees with the language from Hensley v.\n               Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 425, 435 (1982) cited in support of a\n               comprehensive fee award.\n12\n   This reference to issues “on appeal” recognizes that the district court’s attorney fee decision was\nentered after the defendants had already appealed the decision on the merits. The district court had\ncontinuing jurisdiction, after the defendants appealed its order on the merits, to consider and award\nattorney fees. W.R.C.P. 58; Shindell v. Shindell, 2014 WY 51, ¶ 28, n.2, 322 P.3d 1270, 1277, n.2 (Wyo.\n2014).\n                                                  33\n\f               “Many civil rights cases will present only a single claim. In\n               other cases the plaintiff's claims for relief will involve a\n               common core of facts or will be based on related legal\n               theories. Much of counsel’s time will be devoted generally to\n               the litigation as a whole, making it difficult to divide the\n               hours expended on a claim-by-claim basis. Such a lawsuit\n               cannot be viewed as a series of discrete claims. Instead the\n               district court should focus on the significance of the overall\n               relief obtained by the plaintiff in relation to the hours\n               reasonably expended on the litigation.”\n\n(footnote added).\n\n[¶79] The district court also stated that, although the post-judgment proceedings were\nnot as long or complicated as the original trial, the proceedings were comparable and\nnoted that this Court approved its $3.9 million attorney fee award in the first action. It\ncompared the affidavits submitted by the parties as to the reasonableness of the plaintiffs’\nattorney fees submission and stated that, applying the lodestar factors, 13 the $1,177,305\nrequested for the post judgment proceedings was “reasonable and appropriate in view of\nthe nature, complexity and extent of the entire litigation undertaken by plaintiffs in\nsupport of their efforts to enforce their judgment.”\n\n[¶80] The WRPA specifically addresses the requirements for reporting to oil and gas\ninterest owners and provides remedies for reporting failures, including attorney fees to\nprevailing parties. Wyo. Stat. Ann. §§ 30-5-303 & 305. The defendants did not properly\nreport to the plaintiffs at the beginning of the post-judgment period. The NPC report\nprovided by the defendants on July 23, 2010, was a simple two-page High Level\nSummary. After the plaintiffs filed their motion to enforce, the defendants began to\nprovide more information and the parties were eventually able to agree on a set of\nreporting forms. This agreement satisfied some of the issues in the post-judgment\nproceedings, although the plaintiffs continued to question whether the defendants were\nproperly applying the NPC accounting formula with regard to certain expenses.\n\n[¶81] Given the post-judgment issues focused on the defendants’ responsibilities under\nthe WRPA, the NPC and the judgment based upon the act and the contract, the district\ncourt’s refusal to require segregation of fees between WRPA and non-WRPA claims in\nthe post-judgment proceedings was consistent with our decision in Ultra I. For example,\nthe plaintiffs’ efforts to obtain information about the NPI accounting and their evaluation\n13\n   The lodestar test requires a determination of whether: “1) the fee charged represents the product of\nreasonable hours times a reasonable rate; and 2) other factors of discretionary application should be\nconsidered to adjust the fee upward or downward.” Ultra I, ¶ 162, 266 P.3d at 938. See Wyo. Stat. Ann.\n§ 1–14–126(b) (listing factors considered in awarding attorney fees).\n                                                  34\n\fof that information were certainly intertwined with enforcing the contract and the\ndefendants’ on-going reporting and payment obligations and clearly fell within the\nparameters of the WRPA. Other matters, including correspondence with non-parties, etc.\nare not so readily characterized as WRPA litigation. However, “[t]he burden is placed\nupon the party who is attacking the district court’s ruling to establish an abuse of\ndiscretion, and the ultimate issue is whether the court could reasonably conclude as it\ndid.” Joe’s Concrete & Lumber, Inc. v. Concrete Works of Colorado, Inc., 2011 WY 74,\n¶ 12, 252 P.3d 445, 448 (Wyo. 2011). The defendants have not satisfied that burden.\nInstead, they simply list examples of items they claim should not have been approved in\nthe attorney fees award and refer us to their district court filings. In most respects, the\ndefendants’ argument is insufficient to establish the district court abused its discretion.\n\n[¶82] Nevertheless, we have determined the district court’s attorney fees award should\nbe modified in one regard. The plaintiffs stated, in their reply to the defendants’\nopposition to their fee request, that they did not contest a “reduction of fees associated\nwith clerical and filing matters.” The plaintiffs, therefore, revised their fee request by\neliminating those fees, making their total request $1,153,430.50. Despite the plaintiffs’\nconcession on the fees associated with clerical and filing activities, the district court\nawarded the plaintiffs their original request of $1,177,305.50. The district court should\nhave acknowledged the plaintiffs’ revision of their fees request and eliminated the\nassociated fees. We, therefore, rule that the attorney fees award should be revised to\nreflect the plaintiffs’ agreement and reduced to $1,153,430.50.\n\n                                    CONCLUSION\n\n[¶83] We conclude the district court properly assumed jurisdiction in this matter\npursuant to its inherent court powers and the Declaratory Judgments Act. In addition, we\nconclude the district court’s interpretation of the scope of the 2007 trial NPI\ndetermination is supported by the record and its interpretation of when expenses are\n“incurred” under the language of the NPC was correct. Finally, with one exception, the\ndefendants have not demonstrated the district court abused its discretion in awarding the\nplaintiffs attorney fees.\n\n[¶84] Affirmed, as revised.\n\n\n\n\n                                            35\n\f",

(Lance Oil)1 appeal from the district court’s orders after\nAppellees/Plaintiffs Doyle and Margaret Hartman, et. al. filed a motion to enforce a\njudgment and net profits contract (NPC) pertaining to oil and gas leases in Sublette\nCounty, Wyoming. 2 The defendants claim the district court did not have jurisdiction to\nrule on the issues presented in the plaintiffs’ motion to enforce. They also contest the\ndistrict court’s decision on the merits of the motion to enforce and its award of attorney\nfees to the plaintiffs. We conclude the district court had jurisdiction over the issues\npresented, it correctly interpreted its prior judgment and the defendants’ accounting\nresponsibilities under the NPC, and it properly granted the plaintiffs’ request for attorney\nfees, although we do order a minor revision of the award.\n\n[¶2]    We affirm with revision.\n\n                                                  ISSUES\n\n[¶3]    The issues3 on appeal are:\n\n\n1\n Lance Oil did not file a separate brief. Instead, it joined the arguments presented in Ultra’s and\nSWEPI’s briefs, with the exception of their arguments on the attorney fee award which did not apply to\nLance Oil because it was a non-operator working interest owner.\n2\n Initially, there were two additional appeals related to this matter. Supreme Court Case No. S-14-0009\nwas an appeal brought by defendants WPX Energy RM Company, f/k/a Williams Production Rocky\nMountain Co., and Arrowhead Resources (U.S.A.), Ltd. We dismissed the appeal for want of prosecution\nwhen the appellants’ brief was not filed in a timely manner and refused to reinstate the appeal on a later\npetition. Supreme Court Case. No. S-14-0010 was a cross-appeal brought by the plaintiffs which was\nvoluntarily dismissed.\n3\n We restate the issues presented in the parties’ opening briefs, but do not include the “issues” presented\nby defendants in their reply brief. W.R.A.P. 7.03 governs reply briefs:\n\n                Appellant may file a brief in reply which shall comply with the requirements of\n        W.R.A.P. 7.01(a), (b), (c), (f), (g), (h), and (i). In lieu of any statement of the issues, the\n        reply brief shall precisely and concisely set forth on the first page those new issues and\n        arguments raised by the brief of the appellee which are addressed in the reply brief. A\n        reply brief is limited to such new issues and arguments, and a failure to comply with\n        these requirements may subject the party to sanctions under these rules.\n\nIn large part, the defendants’ reply brief simply includes further argument on the issues included in their\nopening briefs. “Presenting argument in a reply brief is not equivalent to framing the issues in an opening\nbrief.

The district court ruled that\nthe NPI had been fully calculated through December 31, 2006 at trial, and the NPC\nrequired expenses to be charged to the NPI in the month following the date the expenses\nwere invoiced. Consequently, the district court refused to allow the defendants to charge\nexpenses invoiced prior to January 1, 2007, when calculating the 2007 NPI.

To deprive a\n               court of power to execute its judgments is to impair its\n               jurisdiction, and the general rule is that every court having\n               jurisdiction to render a particular judgment has inherent\n               power and authority to enforce it and to exercise equitable\n               control over such enforcement. Thus, a court of equity has\n               inherent power to enforce its decrees. A court of equity\n               retains and possesses the power to control the manner of the\n               execution of its decree, and has the inherent right to modify,\n               by a subsequent order, the manner in which it shall be\n               enforced. * * * ” 46 Am.Jur.2d Judgments § 898, p. 1032\n               (1969).\n\nId. at 771.\n\n[¶11] A court also has inherent power to interpret its judgments and clarify ambiguous\nterms. 46 Am.

The mere interpretation of a judgment\n               involves no challenge of its validity, or an attack on it, and a\n               clarification of an ambiguous judgment is not a modification\n               or amendment of the judgment. An order clarifying a\n               judgment explains or refines rights already given, and it\n               neither grants new rights nor extends old ones.

The trial judgment stated:\n\n                     98. The defendants remain obligated to and shall\n              perform the required NPI accounting on a consolidated basis\n\n                                             5\n\f              and make payments monthly to the plaintiffs commencing\n              with production month January 2007, and shall do so in\n              accordance with the terms of the Net Profits Contract and its\n              Accounting Procedure and in compliance with the Court’s\n              Findings of Fact, 25-30, supra.\n\nThe referenced findings of fact stated:\n\n                    25. Proper accounting for the NPI involves\n              expenses and revenues allocable to operations under the\n              Exhibit A leases to the Net Profits Contract and more recently\n              the Subject Leases . . .\n\n                    26. The plaintiffs’ NPI is 4.98%, rather than 5.0%,\n              because of the small interest owned by a non-plaintiff.\n\n                     27. The Net Profits Contract sets forth the terms to\n              be applied and honored in order to perform proper\n              computation of any payable net profits. The accounting\n              requirements are set forth in the body of the Net Profits\n              Contract, in Exhibit A listing the permitted royalty and\n              overriding royalty burdens on the leases, and in Exhibit C-1,\n              which is an Accounting Procedure.\n\n                     28. The Net Profits Contract Accounting Procedure\n              may not be amended without the consent or approval of Novi\n              or its successors in interest, including plaintiffs or their\n              successors in interest. The Net Profits Accounting Procedure\n              has never been amended.\n\n                    29. The Net Profits Contract and the Net Profits\n              Accounting Procedure establish principles to be followed in\n              performing the proper accounting of the NPI as follows:\n\n              (a) Plaintiffs’ net profits [interest] equals 4.98% of\n                  cumulative gross revenue less cumulative expenses on a\n                  consolidated basis associated with the operation of NPI\n                  leases and wells on those leases;\n              (b) The NPI is to be calculated each month and the\n                  incremental net profits for that month, if positive, is to be\n                  paid as soon as practicable after the end of any month in\n                  which net profits have been realized;\n              (c) Gross revenue is based on proceeds from wellhead gas\n\n                                             6\n\f                 and oil sales and on fair market value for other sales;\n             (d) Deductible expenses are those that are reasonable and\n                 customary in connection with the operation and\n                 development of oil and gas properties. These expenses\n                 are properly chargeable against the NPI leases and are\n                 limited by amounts specified in the Accounting Procedure\n                 unless and until that procedure is amended as provided\n                 therein;\n             (e) Expenses that are not reasonable and customary and not\n                 properly chargeable in connection with the operation and\n                 development of NPI leases and therefore, not deductible,\n                 include, among others, federal income tax, interest on\n                 capital and other expenses, depreciation, acquisition costs,\n                 accrual accounts, and future asset retirement accounts;\n             (f) The Accounting Procedure limits the amount of deductible\n                 labor expense (including employee benefits), Pinedale\n                 district office expense, well overhead rates, and legal\n                 expenses; and\n             (g) Deductible expenditures that benefit both NPI and non-\n                 NPI wells are allocated based on the ratio of the operators’\n                 end-of-year NPI well count to total well count.\n\n             30. In performing the NPI accounting, the only permitted\n             burden deductions from gross revenues are the overriding\n             royalty and landowners’ royalties set forth in the listing of\n             leases on Exhibit A to the Net Profits Contract. The\n             permissible burdens on the Subject Leases are depicted on\n             Exhibit B attached and incorporated herein.\n\n[¶16] The Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, as adopted in Wyoming at Wyo. Stat.\nAnn. § 1-37-101 through § 1-37-115 (LexisNexis 2013), has a provision that specifically\nauthorizes “further relief” in a declaratory judgment action. Section 1-37-110 states:\n\n             § 1-37-110. Supplemental relief\n\n                     Further relief based on a declaratory judgment may be\n             granted. Application therefor shall be by petition to a court\n             having jurisdiction to grant the relief. If the application is\n             sufficient the court, on reasonable notice, shall require any\n             adverse party whose rights have been adjudicated by the\n             declaratory judgment to show cause why further relief should\n             not be granted.\n\n\n                                            7\n\f[¶17] Section 1-37-110 has been cited as authority for courts’ post-declaratory judgment\ndeterminations in various contexts for many years.

A court\n             generally has jurisdiction to grant further and necessary or\n             proper relief, including any relief essential to effectuate the\n             declaratory judgment entered by the court. A court has the\n             power, for example, to retain jurisdiction and grant further\n             relief where it has entered a declaratory judgment declaring\n             the rights of the parties under a contract. In such a case, the\n             court may enter such supplemental judgments and orders,\n             from time to time, as are necessary to the supervision of the\n             contract.\n             ....\n                 Under a statute authorizing supplemental relief, the court\n             may be permitted to reserve the right to make such further\n             orders as might be necessary to effectuate the judgment, even\n\n\n                                           8\n\f              though no separate proceeding is initiated to obtain such\n              relief.\n\n24 C.J.S. Declaratory Judgments § 171 (2015) (footnotes omitted and emphasis\nadded).\n\n[¶19] The Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 33 (1982, updated 2014) discusses the\nflip side of the court’s power to grant supplemental declaratory relief, i.e., the preclusive\neffect of a declaratory judgment is not as broad as in other civil actions. While an issue\nthat was actually considered and decided in a declaratory judgment act is conclusive in a\nsubsequent action between the parties as to the specific matters declared, the “further\nrelief” provision of the act allows for additional or supplemental relief to be granted\nbetween the same parties on the same claim. Id. The reason for the departure from the\nusual preclusion rules “‘is that the losing party in a declaratory judgment action can\nnormally be expected to recognize the rights declared by the judgment and act\naccordingly, but that if he fails to do so, the court should have ample power to enforce the\njudgment by subsequent coercive orders, whether or not such relief was sought in the\noriginal action.’” Alsheikh v.

Cir.\n1988), the landlord sought “further relief” in a declaratory judgment action involving the\ntermination of a commercial lease. In the original action, the district court upheld the\nlandlord’s right to terminate the lease but ordered it to compensate the tenant under the\nearly termination clause, and the circuit court affirmed that decision. When the tenant did\nnot vacate the premises after the declaratory judgment was entered, the landlord brought\nan action for “further relief” under the Declaratory Judgments Act, seeking payment\nunder the “end-of-term holdover and cost-on-default clauses” of the lease. The district\ncourt granted the landlord’s request for further relief and the tenant appealed, claiming\nthe district court lost jurisdiction over the matter after the original order was appealed.\n\n[¶21] The D.C. Circuit Court rejected that assertion, stating:\n\n              The “further relief” provisions of both state and federal\n              declaratory judgment statutes clearly anticipate ancillary or\n              subsequent coercion to make an original declaratory judgment\n              effective. Neither a completed appeal, nor a considerable\n              period of delay after the trial court ruling terminates this\n              authority. [The further relief provision’s] retained authority,\n              commentators have noted, “merely carries out the principle\n              that every court, with few exceptions, has inherent power to\n              enforce its decees and to make such orders as may be\n\n                                             9\n\f              necessary to render them effective.” Borchard, Declaratory\n              Judgments 441 (2d ed.1941)[.]\n\nHorn, 843 F.2d at 548 (footnotes and some citations omitted).

While the original declaratory judgment action was pending, one\nof the landowners placed improvements upon the land which was eventually declared to\nbelong to the other. Id. at 767-68. After the judgment was entered, the burdened\nlandowner brought an action for supplemental declaratory relief requesting the court to\norder removal of the encroachments and seeking damages for loss of use of the property.\nPursuant to its supplemental relief jurisdiction, the district court ordered the encroaching\nparty to submit a work plan detailing the removal of the encroachment and ordered that\nparty to pay damages to the burdened party. Id. at 768. The Montana Supreme Court\nupheld the district court’s actions and ruled that, under the Declaratory Judgments Act,\nthe district court retained jurisdiction to grant relief necessary to enforce its order. This\ncontinuing jurisdiction gave the court authority to grant monetary damages and order\ncoercive action to provide complete relief in the declaratory judgment action. Id. at 770.\n\n[¶23] The further relief provision of the Declaratory Judgments Act does, however, have\nlimitations. In Oklahoma Alcoholic Beverage Control Bd. v.

A declaratory judgment is, by its nature,\nabstract. The purpose of the Declaratory Judgments Act is “to settle and to afford relief\nfrom uncertainty and insecurity with respect to legal relations, and [the Act] is to be\nliberally construed and administered.” Wyo.

Here, the district court’s trial judgment awarded the plaintiffs NPI damages for\nthe time period of March 2006 through December 2006 and included a declaratory\njudgment that the defendants continue to account to the plaintiffs and make payments in\naccordance with the NPC. In the enforcement action, the district court determined\nwhether the pre-2007 expenses were, or should have been, included within the earlier\ntrial proceedings and the propriety of the defendants’ methods of complying with its\nongoing accounting requirements under the declaratory judgment.\n\n[¶26] Notably, the district court did not determine the amount of net profits due for any\nperiod after December 31, 2006, even though the plaintiffs presented evidence showing\nthe calculation of the post-trial NPI. The district court’s refusal to calculate the NPI in\nsubsequent periods was a proper recognition of the limits of its jurisdiction.

By limiting the\nscope of its post-judgment order, the district court also avoided a violation of the legal\nprinciples pertaining to installment or divisible contracts. The district court properly\ninterpreted its former judgment and supplemented the declaration contained therein.\n\n[¶27] One additional matter merits our attention before we leave the jurisdictional issue.\nThe defendants claim they were denied due process as a result of the plaintiffs’ failure to\ncommence a new action to address the issues raised in the motion to enforce. In\nparticular, they lament the absence of the procedures available under the rules of civil\nprocedure when a new action is commenced, including the discovery provisions. As our\ndescription of Wyoming precedent on motions to clarify and/or enforce judgments\nindicates, commencing a new action was not required. Section 1-37-110 provides that\nthe request for further relief be made by a petition to the district court which will, if\nappropriate, require the defendant to show cause why further relief should not be granted.\nNeither the plaintiffs nor the district court strictly followed the process set out in the\nstatute. Instead of filing a petition for further relief under the Declaratory Judgments Act,\nthe plaintiffs filed a motion to enforce the judgment and the district court did not issue an\norder to show cause.6\n\n\n6\n At one point, there was discussion of a possible order to show cause as to why the defendants should not\nbe held in contempt of court. The contempt process was later abandoned by the district court and the\nplaintiffs when they realized there was no factual basis for concluding the defendants had willfully\nviolated a clear term of a court order.

It should be noted that the defendants’ appellate argument\nsuggesting they needed the discovery protections offered by a new action ignores the fact\nthat the relevant accounting information was in their possession. Furthermore, the\ndefendants actually objected in 2011 to the plaintiffs’ efforts to obtain additional\ndiscovery in the post-judgment proceedings. Although the defendants make a vague\nargument that they did not receive adequate process, they do not demonstrate how their\ndue process rights to notice and the opportunity to be heard were violated.\n\n[¶29] Cases from other jurisdictions establish that “further relief” under the Declaratory\nJudgments Act may be granted through a variety of procedural mechanisms. In Juban v.\nSchermer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2196314\"><a href=\"/opinion/2196314/juban-v-schermer/\"><span class=\"volume\">751</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1190</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1191-92 (Pa. Super. 2000), the court entered a declaratory\njudgment on the validity of a land title transfer and the petitioner subsequently filed a\npetition seeking damages as a result of the respondent’s use of the property while the\ndeclaratory action was pending. Although the Pennsylvania statute set out a procedure\nsimilar to ours with a petition for further relief followed by an order to show cause, there\nis no indication that the trial court specifically issued an order to show cause. It appears\nthat the matter proceeded after the respondents objected to the petition. Id.\n\n[¶30] Some other states’ declaratory judgment statutes simply require reasonable notice\nand a hearing, without having the district court issue an order to show cause. See, e.g.,\nCasa Balcona and Horn, supra. There is no question that the defendants received notice\nand the opportunity to be heard in this case. We, therefore, conclude the district court\nhad jurisdiction to consider the specific issues presented in this matter under its inherent\nauthority to interpret and enforce its own judgment and the further relief provision of the\nDeclaratory Judgments Act.7 Section 1-37-110.\n\n               2. Pre-2007 Expenses/Timing of Expense Reporting\n\n[¶31] The next three issues all pertain to the district court’s interpretation of its judgment\nfrom the 2007 trial and the defendants’ ongoing NPC accounting responsibilities,\nparticularly the timing of expense reporting. The district court held an evidentiary\nhearing and set out its decision with findings of fact and conclusions of law. We,\ntherefore, review its findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard and its\nconclusions of law de novo.\n7\n  The parties stipulated the post-judgment proceedings would conclude after resolution of the pre-2007\nexpense issue. They agreed other issues pertaining to the accounting and calculation of the NPI from\nJanuary 1, 2007, forward would not be addressed in the motion to enforce proceedings but would be\nreserved for a future lawsuit.\n                                                 12\n\f                We do not substitute ourselves for the trial court as a\n                finder of facts; instead, we defer to the trial court’s\n                findings unless they are unsupported by the record or\n                erroneous as a matter of law.

The\ninformation used to calculate the NPI at trial was not provided by the defendants pursuant\nto timely reporting under the NPC but was, instead, provided in the litigation discovery\nprocess. The district court’s judgment, which was affirmed in all relevant respects by this\nCourt, included an award of net profits from March 2006 through December 2006.8 The\ndistrict court made a number of determinations as to what expenses were properly\ndeductible in calculating the NPI, generally relying upon the calculation performed by the\nplaintiffs’ expert accounting witness, David Johnson. In total, over $2 billion in expenses\nwere allowed as deductions in calculating the net profits at trial, including $888.4 million\nfor 2006. The excluded expenses included Ultra’s “accrual accounts” of $77,752,958 and\nShell’s accumulator accounts of $59,212,079.\n\n[¶34] Little was known about the accrual and accumulator accounts at trial. Mr.\nJohnson testified that he did not believe the expenses in the accounts were properly\ndeductible at the time of trial because Ultra represented the amounts in the accrual\naccounts were “estimates,” suggesting that no invoices had been received for the\nexpenses, and Shell indicated the expenses in the accumulator accounts could not be\nspecifically tied to NPI wells. The defendants did not provide any detail on the expenses\nincluded in the challenged accounts, so there was no evidence of the activity date (the\ndate the goods or services were provided to the operators), the invoice date, or the date of\npayment. Given the defendants’ characterization of the expenses in the accounts and the\nlack of information about them, the district court rejected the defendants’ efforts to\ndeduct the accrual and accumulator accounts from the revenues to determine the net\nprofit for trial. The defendants did not appeal the district court’s rejection of the accrual\nand accumulation accounts after the first trial and, consequently, we did not address that\nruling in Ultra I.\n\n\n\n\n8\n  Although net profits had been earned beginning in May 2005, the defendants were not obligated to pay\nthe plaintiffs until March 2006 because the plaintiffs did not give notice of their ownership of the NPI, as\nrequired by the NPC, until February 2006. Ultra I, ¶¶ 66-67, 73, 226 P.3d at 916-17.\n                                                     16\n\f[¶35] As we stated above in Paragraph 14, the district court also ruled after the 2007 trial\nthat the defendants were required to perform an ongoing “NPI accounting on a\nconsolidated basis and make payments monthly to the plaintiffs commencing with\nproduction month January 2007,” in accordance with the terms of the NPC and the\njudgment. After we affirmed the district court’s decision, the defendants provided\naccounting statements to the plaintiffs which indicated they were charging expenses with\nactivity dates prior to January 1, 2007 to the 2007 NPI accounting. When the plaintiffs\nquestioned the defendants about the pre-2007 expenses, the defendants claimed the\nexpenses were properly included in the 2007 accounting because they had been excluded\nfrom the trial accounting as accrual and accumulator accounts.\n\n[¶36] In a series of hearings on the plaintiffs’ motion to enforce starting in 2010 and\ncontinuing through April 2013, the parties argued about whether the expenses prior to\nJanuary 1, 2007, should be included in the 2007 accounting. The plaintiffs generally\nadvanced two arguments against including the pre-2007 expenses in the post-trial\naccounting. The first was that the trial in 2007 was intended to determine a complete NPI\naccounting through December 31, 2006, and the defendants were obligated to provide all\nof their pre-2007 expenses for deduction from the trial NPI. The plaintiffs’ second\nargument was the NPC required the defendants to report expenses within one month after\nthe month they were incurred. They argued that an expense was “incurred” for purposes\nof the NPC when it was invoiced by a third party supplier or service provider to the\noperators.\n\n[¶37] The defendants argued the invoice date was irrelevant and the pre-2007 expenses\nreported in the 2007 accounting were timely because they were reported to the NPI\nowners at the same time the operators billed them to the other working interest owners\nthrough the joint interest billing (JIB) process. In other words, according to the\ndefendants, expenses were “incurred” for NPC purposes when they were “jibbed.” The\ndefendants also argued the expenses were properly included in the 2007 accounting\nbecause the NPC envisioned a cumulative accounting which included all expenses from\ninception of the NPI forward.\n\n[¶38] The district court issued a detailed order on the plaintiffs’ motion to enforce. It\nreviewed the evidence and rulings from the trial and the evidence about the pre-2007\nexpenses produced in the post-judgment proceedings, interpreted its earlier judgment and\nthe relevant provisions of the NPC and ruled that all expenses which were invoiced\nbefore January 1, 2007 were excluded from the post-trial accounting. In general, the\ndistrict court agreed with the plaintiffs that the trial NPI determination was a full\naccounting of the NPI through December 31, 2006. The district court also found that an\nexpense was “incurred” under the NPC when it was invoiced. Applying this definition,\nthe district court decided that Section 3 of the NPC required the operators to charge\nexpenses to the NPI account within one month after the close of the calendar month in\nwhich the invoice was dated. Thus, the district court’s decision relies upon two legal\n\n                                            17\n\fconcepts—the finality of the trial judgment and the tardiness of the defendants’ expense\nreporting.\n\n[¶39] The trial judgment specifically stated net profits were awarded to the plaintiffs for\nthe period of March through December 2006. In its order on the motion to enforce, the\ndistrict court entered the following findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding the\nscope of the trial judgment:\n\n                     [Findings of Fact] 25.       Ultra and SWEPI did not\n             follow the NPC terms in reporting trial NPI expenses. The\n             individuals responsible for revenue and expense reporting\n             testified they were not familiar with, or guided by, the NPC\n             terms when they assembled and reported expense and revenue\n             information to the Plaintiffs for the 2007 trial.\n\n                    26. Witnesses for Ultra and SWEPI testified they\n             reported all NPI expenses for the trial calculation. SWEPI\n             witness, Jeannine Nieder, testified she instructed their experts\n             to include all accumulator accounts in the trial expenses,\n             including non-NPI wells, because she would rather include\n             them and have them challenged rather than exclude them and\n             lose some costs.\n             ....\n                    [Conclusions of Law] 2. Defendants were solely\n             responsible for the NPI expenses reported for the 2007 trial\n             calculation. To the extent Defendants incurred but failed to\n             properly present evidence of pre-2007 expenses at trial, they\n             are precluded by the Judgment from doing so in the NPI\n             accounting beginning January, 2007.\n\n[¶40] The district court specifically excluded the expenses in the accrual and\naccumulator accounts from the NPI accounting approved at trial and the defendants did\nnot appeal that decision.

As such, it is in the same family\nas res judicata, collateral estoppel, and stare decisis. In their\ntreatise, Professors Wright, Miller, and Cooper identify four\nsituations in which the “law of the case” may arise. 18\nCHARLES ALAN WRIGHT, ARTHUR R. MILLER &\nEDWARD H. COOPER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND\nPROCEDURE § 4478 (1981). Most commonly, the “law of\nthe case” requires a trial court to adhere to its own prior\nrulings, adhere to the rulings of an appellate court, or adhere\nto another judge’s rulings in the same case or a closely related\ncase. Id. Triton, however, relies upon a fourth and much less\nutilized aspect of the rule in which a court’s ruling on an issue\nthat could have been appealed, but was not, will be given\npreclusive effect. Tom Beuchler Construction, Inc. v. City of\nWilliston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1966327\"><a href=\"/opinion/1966327/tom-beuchler-const-v-city-of-williston/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">336</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 339 (N.D.1987). Although some\ncourts label this fourth category as the “law of the case,” it is\nsomething of a misfit. Generally, the “law of the case” arises\nbecause a court has ruled on a matter and that ruling is to be\napplied to subsequent proceedings in the litigation. However,\nin the fourth category relied upon by Triton, it is the litigant’s\nfailure to raise an issue on appeal which gives rise to the\npreclusive effect of the lower court’s ruling, not a court\nruling. Allan D. Vestal, Law of the Case: Single–Suit\nPreclusion, 11 UTAH L.REV. 1 (1967). The underlying\nrationale of the fourth category of the “law of the case” is that\na litigant can argue to an appellate court only those issues\nwhich he raised on appeal. Id. at 21. The idea that a litigant is\nlimited to arguing those issues he raised on appeal is, in\nessence, the concept of waiver.\n\n   The general rule concerning waiver is:\n\n[Q]uestions assigned as error are deemed to have been\nabandoned or waived where they are not urged or discussed\non appeal by brief or argument, or are not sufficiently so\ndiscussed; and the same rule applies to cross errors. 5B\nC.J.S. Appeal and Error § 1803 at 98 (1958). This Court has\nconsistently applied this long-standing rule in prior cases.\nDworkin v.

These findings are supported by the record. Jeannine Nieder, Shell’s\nfinancial representative for its Rocky Mountain assets, testified she was responsible for\ngathering information about the NPI for the 2007 trial calculation and admitted she did\nnot use the NPC to guide her in determining what expenses to include. She repeatedly\nstated that she “included all expense items” up through December 31, 2006, for the NPI\ncalculation. The accumulator accounts prepared under her direction included expenses\nthat she believed were at least partially allocable to NPI wells and leases, but, at the time\nof trial, she was not sure.\n\n[¶42] After the trial, SWEPI started compiling information to meet its NPC reporting\nrequirements. The March 2007 expenses reported by SWEPI were unusually high,\nincluding $43 million of pre-2007 expenses. Contrary to SWEPI’s representation of the\nnature of the accumulator account expenses at trial, the district court found in the post-\njudgment order that at least some of the expenses could have been allocated to the NPI\nwells prior to trial:\n\n                     18. SWEPI disclosed its March, 2007 expenses\n              were abnormally high because $43 million in pre-2007\n              expenses from the accumulator account was charged to NPI\n              wells in March, 2007. SWEPI charged certain of the\n              accumulator expenses to NPI wells prior to trial but did not\n              report the accumulator expenses as incurred expenses.\n              SWEPI records reflect the accumulator expenses were\n              invoiced prior to January 1, 2007.\n\nThe defendants do not establish this factual finding was clearly erroneous.\n\n[¶43] At the hearing on the motion to enforce, Ms. Nieder testified about the process\nSWEPI used in early 2007 to move the pre-2007 expenses from the accumulator accounts\nto the NPI account. She was questioned as to why the amounts in the accumulator\naccounts invoiced prior to December 31, 2006, had not been reported as incurred NPI\nexpenses for the October 2007 trial. Ms. Nieder stated SWEPI had not finished its NPI\naccounting so, even though the expenses could have been charged to NPI wells prior to\ntrial, they were just put in an accumulator account.\n\n\n\n                                             20\n\f[¶44] Kristen Marron, Ultra’s controller until April 2007, testified at her June 2007\ndeposition that she had been instructed to compile all accounting data for the relevant\nleases. She stated that she had provided all revenue and expense information “as\nrequested.” Ms. Marron testified the trial data included all costs to “drill and complete\nthe wells,” lease operating expenses, and the G & A (general and administrative costs)\nallocation. She stated the only expenses excluded were those that did not pertain to the\nrelevant wells. Mr. Johnson later testified that he had understood from Ms. Marron’s\ndeposition in June 2007 that “all expenses were provided.”\n\n[¶45] As the district court noted, the trial accounting was meant to be final through\nDecember 2006. Given the defendants were the only parties with access to the expense\ninformation and the parties understood the trial accounting was final through December\n2006, the defendants should have provided all expenses applicable to the NPI leases\nthrough the end of 2006 for determination of the NPI at trial. A reasonable inference\nfrom the evidence presented at the post-judgment hearing is that the defendants simply\nfailed to perform their accounting obligations and did not properly identify and report all\nof the pre-2007 expenses for trial. Having failed to report the expenses for trial, the\ndefendants sought to include them in a later accounting period without regard for the\nfinality of the pre-2007 accounting or the trial judgment.9 The district court’s findings as\nto the scope of the trial accounting are supported by the record. It properly concluded\nthat all expenses deductible from the NPI calculation for 2006 should have been included\nin the defendants’ trial evidence.\n\n[¶46] The defendants argue that since the expenses were not allowed at the trial, they\nshould be allowed in the post-trial NPI calculations. This argument requires us to assume\nthe excluded accrual and accumulator accounts were the same pre-2007 expenses they\nnow seek to include in the 2007 accounting. The defendants did not make a clear\nconnection between the trial accrual accounts and the pre-2007 expenses they sought to\ninclude in the 2007 accounting at the post-judgment hearings. The most obvious\ndifference is the amounts did not match. The excluded trial expenses included $77.7\nmillion in Ultra’s accrual accounts and $59.2 million in SWEPI accumulator accounts,\nwhile the expenses at issue in the post-trial accounting with activity dates before January\n1, 2007, included $60.8 million for Ultra and $70.5 million for SWEPI.\n\n[¶47] During the post-judgment proceedings, Ultra’s controller Garland Shaw10 was\nasked about the relationship between the $77.7 million in Ultra’s accrual account that was\n\n9\n  Furthermore, some of the pre-2007 expenses claimed by Shell in its 2007 NPI accounting did not even\npertain to NPI wells, even though they had supposedly been confirmed as expenses allocable to the NPI in\nthe post-trial accounting process.\n10\n  Mr. Shaw testified that he started as Ultra’s corporate controller in October 2006. Apparently there was some\noverlap between Mr. Shaw’s and Ms. Marron’s tenures, as she testified that she was Ultra’s controller until March\n2007.\n\n                                                      21\n\fexcluded from the trial accounting and the $60.8 million of pre-2007 expenses that Ultra\nwas seeking to deduct from the post-trial NPI calculation. He confirmed there was no\ndirect correlation between the amounts and stated, “we’re sort of talking about apples and\noranges when we talk about the 60 million and we talk about the 77 million.” When\nasked whether Ultra could have tied the pre-2007 expenses currently in dispute to the\naccruals excluded at trial, Mr. Shaw stated they “could have made a determination” but\nthey did not because “[t]here’s no reason to do that. The accruals were disallowed at\ntrial.” The amounts in the trial accrual accounts were not supported by source\ndocuments, which would have shown detail such as the activity date, invoice date or\npayment date. Therefore, the defendants’ current argument that it was wrong to exclude\nthe former accrual expenses from the post-trial accounting after they had been excluded\nat trial is not supported by the record because there was no evidence the trial accrual\nexpenses were the same as the pre-2007 expenses the defendants wish to include in the\n2007 accounting.\n\n[¶48] The district court also relied upon the terms of the NPC in excluding from the\n2007 NPI accounting expenses that were incurred prior to December 31, 2006. To\nreiterate, Paragraph 98 of the judgment states:\n\n             The defendants remain obligated to and shall perform the\n             required NPI accounting on a consolidated basis and make\n             payments monthly to the plaintiffs commencing with\n             production month January 2007, and shall do so in\n             accordance with the terms of the Net Profits Contract and its\n             Accounting Procedure.\n\n[¶49] The contractual provision establishing the deadline for the operators to report\nexpenses to the net profit owners is located in Section 3 of the NPC and states:\n\n                 Within one (1) month after the close of each calendar\n                 month, Operator shall furnish to Novi a statement of costs\n                 and expenses incurred and charges made and all receipts\n                 and credits received during such calendar month.\n\nUnder this provision and others in the contract, the proper time for charging an expense\nto the NPI is when it is “incurred” by the operator.\n\n[¶50] The plaintiffs argued, and the district court agreed, an expense is incurred under\nthe contract when a third party provides an invoice for goods or services related to the\nNPI leases to the operator. The defendants argued, however, that a cost is incurred for\nNPC purposes when it was billed to the joint interest partners in a JIB or, in other words,\n“jibbed.” We apply our typical rules of contract interpretation to this issue.\n\n\n                                            22\n\f             The initial question of whether the contract is capable of\n             being understood in only one way is a question of law for the\n             court. If the court determines that the contract is capable of\n             being understood in only one way, then the language used in\n             the contract expresses and controls the intent of the parties. In\n             such case, the next question, what is that understanding or\n             meaning, is also a question of law. . . .\n\n             M & M Auto Outlet v. Hill Inv.

The plain and ordinary\nmeaning of “incur” is: “to become liable or subject to: bring down upon oneself <incur\nexpenses>” Merriam-Webster Dictionary 250 (2005). See also Fix v. Forelle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2679011\"><a href=\"/opinion/2679011/william-r-fix-v-frank-forelle/\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WY</span>\n<span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 17, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">745</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 749 (Wyo. 2014) (defining incur with dictionary definition). The\nusual understanding of when a party becomes liable or subject to an actual expense is\nwhen a third party vendor or service provider gives notice of the amount charged and\nwhen payment is due. That information is commonly communicated with an invoice or a\nbill.\n\n[¶53] The district court accepted the common usage when it rejected the defendants’\nposition that an expense is incurred when it is “jibbed” and, instead, adopted the\nplaintiffs’ argument that the invoice date is the date of incurrence:\n\n                    21. The appropriate date for when an expense is\n             incurred for purposes of the NPI accounting is the date of an\n             invoice for work or material provided on a NPI well or lease.\n             The invoice date provides an operator with the date of a\n\n                                            23\n\f             charge by a third party for work performed or materials\n             furnished for a NPI well. The invoice also provides the\n             operator with a sum to be paid and the date payment is due.\n\n                     28. The NPC does not contemplate expense\n             reporting based on the operators’ discretionary internal\n             accounting process after an invoice has been received, after it\n             has been approved for payment, and when it is reflected on a\n             joint interest billing to the working interest owners in a NPI\n             well. Such a procedure could result in posting an expense to\n             the NPI account several months after the expense was\n             incurred.\n\nThe district court explained that adopting the invoice date as the date of incurrence is\nconsistent with the contract language and is “a workable standard. Utilizing the invoice\ndate reduces uncertainty and further reduces the opportunity for manipulation of the NPI\naccount as to the timing of charges to the NPI account.”\n\n[¶54] The defendants assert the district court’s interpretation of the contract language\nignores other provisions of the NPC including the provisions referencing expenses that\nare “reasonable and customary” and “properly chargeable against the leasehold interest”\nin Section 2 of the contract and the cumulative nature of the NPC accounting set out in\nSection 3. The “reasonable and customary” and “properly chargeable” language is part\nof the definition of expenses in Section 2. It describes the scope of the expenses to be\nincluded in the NPI calculation and does not address the timing of the reporting\nrequirement. The deadline for reporting expenses is set out in the “incurred” language of\nSection 3. The defendants are correct that Section 3 of the NPC requires calculation of\nthe net profits on the basis of cumulative revenues and expenses over the life of the\ncontract. That does not mean, however, the defendants were free to disregard the timing\nprovisions of the contract. The contract requires the operators to report the expenses to\nthe net profit interest owners within one month after the month an expense is invoiced.\n\n[¶55] The district court’s interpretation that the defendants are obligated to charge\nexpenses to the NPI within the NPC’s deadline gives full effect to all of the terms of the\ncontract and accurately reflects the rulings from the trial judgment. The defendants\nwould have received the benefit of the cumulative accounting for expenses had they\nreported them to the plaintiffs within the contract timeline. As the district court\nrecognized, if the operators can decide when a cost is incurred by picking the time to\ninclude it on the JIB, the net profit interest, which is payable in any month that shows a\nnet profit, would be subject to manipulation and the reporting deadlines would essentially\nbe meaningless. There would be no reason for the contract to require the operators to\nreport on a monthly basis if they can decide when to apply the expenses using the JIB\nprocess.\n\n                                           24\n\f[¶56] The district court also properly considered the circumstances surrounding the\nexecution of the NPC in 1954 in determining that the original parties did not intend to use\nthe JIB date as the date of incurrence. As we have stated before, even when a contract is\nunambiguous, evidence of the circumstances surrounding its execution may be\nconsidered to determine the parties’ intent. “Relevant considerations may include the\nrelationship of the parties, the subject matter of the contract, and the parties’ purpose in\nmaking the contract.” Davidson, ¶ 14, 247 P.3d at 72, quoting Ecosystem Res., L.C. v.\nBroadbent Land & Res., L.L.C., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2622150\"><a href=\"/opinion/2622150/ecosystem-res-v-broadbent-land-res/\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WY</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 10, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2622150\"><a href=\"/opinion/2622150/ecosystem-res-v-broadbent-land-res/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">685</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 688 (Wyo. 2007). The\ndistrict court explained:\n\n                     29. At the time the NPC was negotiated and executed,\n              El Paso was the original operator of the subject properties.\n              Continental and MALCO were non-operating working\n              interest owners. Had the parties intended to provide that an\n              expense is incurred for the NPI accounting based on when the\n              operator decided to charge the joint interest owners, they\n              could have done so, but they did not.\n\nIn other words, the contracting parties were familiar with the JIB process but did not\nexpressly incorporate that accounting time into the NPC terms. Instead, the original\nparties adopted a reporting deadline based upon when the operator incurs an expense, i.e.,\nwhen an expense is invoiced, thereby making the recipient liable for the amount due.\n\n[¶57] The arbitrariness of using the JIB date as the date of incurrence was aptly\ndemonstrated in Ms. Nieder’s testimony about Shell’s method of expense reporting. She\nactually agreed with plaintiffs’ counsel at the March 2013 hearing that when Shell\nreceived an invoice it had incurred an expense. However, she testified Shell’s charge\nagainst the NPI did not follow the “incurrence” language.\n\n                     Q. . . . So your classification of inclusion in the net\n              profits is something other than an incurrence of an expense?\n              Are we to understand that?\n\n                      A.    That’s correct.\n\nMs. Neider stated that her understanding of the NPC was that a charge is “billable to the\nNPI when that charge is posted to a well associated with the NPI,” as part of the JIB\nprocess. She confirmed that the operator was in charge of posting the expenses and\nstated the following with regard to the timing of the posting:\n\n              Q.     [I]s it typical that the posting happens in the month\n              following the expense being incurred?\n\n                                              25\n\f              A.    It could happen in the month following.           It could\n              happen subsequent to that.\n\n              Q.     So whatever time that is, a month, two months, three\n              months, it’s your opinion, what you’re offering as opinion is\n              that’s when it gets charged to the net profits account?\n\n              A.      Yes.\n\nUltra’s financial witness, Mr. Shaw, also admitted that “[a]ccording to the true definition\nof what is incurred,” an expense is incurred when invoiced.\n\n[¶58] Notwithstanding the plain meaning of the contract language, Ultra and SWEPI\nassert that the plaintiffs agreed to use the JIB date as the date to charge expenses to the\nnet profits account, the district court confirmed that agreement, and the plaintiffs should,\ntherefore, be bound under the principles of judicial estoppel, collateral estoppel and/or the\nlaw of the case. Application of these principles are matters of law; consequently, our\nreview is de novo. Tarver v.

Tarver, ¶¶ 10-11, 327 P.3d at 80.\n\n[¶60] The defendants direct us to two instances they say demonstrate the plaintiffs and\ndistrict court adopted the JIB date as the date of incurrence. The first is a November 23,\n2010, letter from plaintiffs’ counsel to defendants’ counsel complaining about the\noperators’ failure to provide complete accounting information. The letter began: “We are\nnear the end of 2010 and the companies responsible for accounting for the [NPI] have not\ncompleted the accounting for 2007-2008.” To move the accounting process forward, the\nplaintiffs attached a one-page proposed procedure for NPI reporting. The proposal\ncontained a broad outline of what information should be included in monthly revenue and\nexpense reports. It also provided that each company would designate a representative to\nact as a contact for the plaintiffs to obtain additional information. The basic NPI revenue\ninformation identified in the proposal included well identification, volumes of oil and gas\nproduced and gross revenues. Their proposal for NPI expense information was even less\ndetailed, stating only: “Lease Operating Expenses and capital expenditures charged to\njoint account by operators on Joint Interest Bills on NP wells.” (Emphasis in original).\n\n[¶61] The district court rejected the defendants’ claim that the letter amounted to an\nagreement to use the JIB date as the date of incurrence, and its finding is supported by the\nrecord. The November 2010 proposal included only general outlines of the information\nthat should be included in the monthly reporting. It specifically noted that other\nresources should be made available to the plaintiffs as part of the accounting process,\nincluding source documents and a contact person at each company so the plaintiffs could\nrequest additional information. When questioned about the effect of the November 2010\nproposal, the plaintiffs’ expert testified that the reference to the JIB expenses did not\npertain to the timing of the expense reporting but rather what expenses should be\nincluded in the reports. In a later letter dated February 8, 2011, plaintiffs’ counsel stated\nthat, under the NPC, the defendants were obligated to report expenses “within 30 days\nafter the calendar month when they are incurred.” Clearly, the 2010 proposed accounting\nprocedure was not an express adoption by the plaintiffs of the JIB date as the date of\nincurrence for NPC expense reporting.\n\n[¶62] The second piece of evidence the defendants assert shows the plaintiffs and district\ncourt adopted the JIB date as the date of incurrence is the NPI reporting statement, which\nwas stipulated to by the plaintiffs and approved by the district court. The NPI reporting\nstatement was actually a series of seven forms showing various expense and revenue\nsummaries about the NPI wells on a monthly basis.\n\n[¶63] The record does not support the defendants’ claim that the plaintiffs and district\ncourt adopted the JIB date as the date of incurrence when the NPI reporting statement\n\n                                             27\n\fwas agreed upon and approved. Two of the forms included in the approved statement\nrefer to the JIB dates, but the other five do not. The approved monthly statement includes\nonly general summaries of expenses and revenues. The defendants are also providing\nsource documents to the plaintiffs, which include other details about the expenses like the\ninvoice dates. Although the information about when expenses were jibbed presumably\nassists the parties in tracking the expenses, the statement contains no express adoption of\nthe JIB date as the date expenses are incurred under the NPC. The defendants do not\ndirect us to any evidence in the record showing that the parties intended to change the\nplain meaning of the contract language by adopting the NPI reporting statement.\nFurthermore, the district court’s order approving the NPI statement says nothing about\nwhen costs are incurred for purposes of the NPC reporting deadline.\n\n[¶64] Without a more definitive statement that the parties and the court intended to rely\non the JIB date as the date of incurrence, we certainly cannot say the district court’s\ndecision that no such agreement existed was clearly erroneous. Given there was no\nagreement or order requiring use of the JIB date as the date of incurrence under the NPC,\nthe preclusion and equitable doctrines of judicial estoppel, collateral estoppel, and/or law\nof the case do not apply.\n\n[¶65] Finally, the defendants claim the district court’s order creates an improper\nforfeiture and the exclusion of the expenses is unfair and inequitable. Their forfeiture\nargument is misplaced. The law does not favor forfeiture of contract rights, see, e.g.,\nReynolds v. Milatzo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2599790\"><a href=\"/opinion/2599790/reynolds-v-milatzo/\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WY</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 15, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">161</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">509</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 513 (Wyo. 2007); however, this\ncase does not involve a true forfeiture of contract rights. Instead, we are concerned with\nconcepts of judgment finality and interpretation of the scope of the judgment and the\nterms of the NPC help guide that interpretation. The defendants had a fair opportunity to\npresent their expenses at trial and either did not do so or mischaracterized the nature of\nthe expenses.\n\n[¶66] The defendants also argue that the district court’s order will result in a forfeiture of\nany future (or post-2006) expenses which are not reported within the time limits of the\nNPC. We do not read the order that way and neither do the plaintiffs. The court did not\nmake any express ruling on what remedies would be proper for future violations of the\ncontract reporting requirements. The plaintiffs state in their brief:\n\n              [Ultra] complains that under the Judgment, if defendants do\n              not charge an expense in the first report following the month\n              in which the expense is incurred, it is forever forfeited. The\n              Order Regarding Pre-2007 Expenses does not compel that\n              result. Defendants would be entitled to normal adjustments\n              of the NPI account for the period beginning January 2007, for\n              these accounts are not subject to the finality of a Judgment.\n\n\n                                             28\n\fThey reiterated this position at oral argument. The plaintiffs properly recognize that the\norder at issue in this case was based upon the dual considerations of finality of the trial\njudgment and interpretation of the terms of the NPC.\n\n[¶67] The defendants’ argument that the district court’s decision was unfair and\ninequitable also rings hollow for other reasons. There were actually $131 million in\nexpenses at issue in the post-judgment proceedings. The district court carefully\nconsidered the expenses using the December 31, 2006, invoice date as the cutoff. It\ndisallowed approximately $102 million in expenses, but allowed expenses of\napproximately $29 million that were invoiced later. The district court’s thorough review\nof the proposed expenses supports its decision and undermines the defendants’ fairness\narguments.\n\n[¶68] Furthermore, although the plaintiffs and the district court were led to believe at\ntrial that Ultra’s accrual accounts contained only estimates, the post-trial information\nshowed that the majority of the expenses had actually been invoiced and, in many\ninstances, paid prior to December 31, 2006. In fact, some of the pre-2007 expenses the\ndefendants wanted to include in the 2007 accounting had been invoiced and paid several\nyears before. If the trial accrual amounts had truly been field estimates, the actual\namounts would have been invoiced later and would have been proper 2007 deductions.\n\n[¶69] The defendants persistently argue that interpreting the NPC to require them to\nreport expenses in the month after they are invoiced imposes an unduly heavy burden\nupon them. They insist it is easier to report to the NPI owners at the same time they bill\ntheir joint interest partners. Perhaps that is true; however, that is not what the NPC\nrequires.11 We are not at liberty to amend or modify a contract under the guise of\ninterpretation. Fayard v.

Additionally, we note that oil and gas\nleaseholders and operators are subject to different reporting and payment deadlines under\n11\n  Although the parties do not address this development, we note that they agreed in a February 25, 2013, document\nentitled, “Stipulation Concerning Remaining Post-Judgment Issues and March 5-6, 2013 Hearing” as follows:\n\n        2.      Operator Defendants shall continue to provide the information concerning the Novi\n        account that was ordered by the Court in its “Order Approving Monthly Net Profits Reporting\n        Forms” dated December 17, 2012.\n\n        3.       Plaintiffs have raised issues regarding the [Operator] Defendants’ alleged non compliance\n        with the timing of the monthly NPI report as provided in Section 3 of the [NPC]. [Operator]\n        Defendants agree that, beginning with production month February 2013, the Defendants will\n        provide Plaintiffs with the approved monthly reporting form and supporting documents within\n        ninety (90) days from the last of the production month. For instance, the monthly NPI report for\n        February 2013 production month, March 2013 NPI month, would be due on or before May 31,\n        2013.\n\n\n\n                                                       29\n\fvarious statutes and contracts, including federal mineral royalties, state severance taxes,\nthe WRPA, joint interest billing, etc. The NPC simply imposed an additional reporting\nrequirement upon the operators. There is nothing inherently unfair or unconscionable\nabout that. The district court aptly addressed the defendants’ argument:\n\n                     A consistent theme from the Defendants with respect\n              to the accounting requirements of the net profits interest is\n              the requirements are impractical and difficult to comply with\n              given their current business practices. The Court observes\n              the Defendants have made enormous profits from operations\n              on the leases subject to the net profits interest. Their\n              obligation is to conform their accounting procedures to\n              accommodate their contractual and Court ordered obligations\n              under the provisions of the net profits contract not the net\n              profits contract to their accounting procedures and business\n              practices.\n\n[¶70] This statement by the district court also applies to another equitable argument\npropounded by the defendants. They emphasize the large amount of money invested in\nthe leases for which they did not receive credit and argue the plaintiffs received a\nwindfall of approximately $102 million. That is, of course, an enormous amount of\nmoney. However, the defendants’ argument disregards the context. The amount of\nmoney changing hands as a result of the NPI leases is almost unfathomable. At the trial,\nthe court was considering total expenses of over $2 billion and even greater revenues.\nUltra I, ¶ 16, 226 P.3d at 904. The parties indicate those amounts have grown\nconsiderably in the ensuing years. The $102 million in expenses is but a small fraction of\nthe totals. Also, it is important to keep in mind that the NPI is concerned with slightly\nless than five percent of the total revenues and expenses, so the actual amount which the\ndefendants lost in deductions was only approximately $5 million out of the more than $2\nbillion total trial expenses. Ultra I, ¶ 11, 226 P.3d at 902-03. Finally, the defendants\nshould keep in mind that without the original assignment of the leases by the plaintiffs’\npredecessors in exchange for the net profit interest, they would not have acquired the\nleases in the first place. Id., ¶ 3, 226 P.3d at 899. The defendants simply have not\nconvinced this Court that the result in this case is inequitable or unfair.\n\n              3. Attorney Fees\n\n[¶71] Wyoming follows the American rule on attorney fees which states that each party\nis responsible for its own attorney fees unless there is express contractual or statutory\nauthority for an award of fees.

Stat. Ann. § 30-5-303 (LexisNexis 2013).\n\n[¶72] The defendants argue the district court’s order awarding attorney fees to the\nplaintiffs was erroneous. Their first argument depends upon a reversal by this Court of\nthe district court’s rulings on jurisdiction or its interpretation of the NPC. In that event,\nthe defendants maintain, they would be the prevailing parties and, consequently, entitled\nto an award of attorney fees. Given we have affirmed the district court’s rulings on those\nissues, the defendants are not entitled to an attorney fees award.\n\n[¶73] The defendants also claim that even if the plaintiffs were entitled to an attorney\nfees award, the district court erred by allowing the plaintiffs’ entire request. We review a\ndistrict court’s attorney fees award for abuse of discretion.\n\n                A court abuses its discretion only when it acts in a manner\n                which exceeds the bounds of reason under the\n                circumstances. The burden is placed upon the party who is\n                attacking the trial court's ruling to establish an abuse of\n                discretion, and the ultimate issue is whether the court could\n                reasonably conclude as it did.\n\n                We have said that “[j]udicial discretion is a composite of\n                many things, among which are conclusions drawn from\n\n                                             31\n\f                objective criteria; it means a sound judgment exercised\n                with regard to what is right under the circumstances and\n                without doing so arbitrarily or capriciously.” If the record\n                includes sufficient evidence to support the district court's\n                exercise of discretion, we uphold its decision.\n\n              [Mueller v.

In the post-judgment proceedings, the plaintiffs initially requested the\ndistrict court award them fees of $1,177,305.50. The defendants evaluated the plaintiffs’\nattorney fees submission and determined that only 641.9 hours, valued at $189,620, were\nproperly awardable to the plaintiffs under the WRPA. The district court did not require\nthe plaintiffs to segregate the fees and awarded the plaintiffs their full attorney fees\nrequest.\n\n[¶75] In general, “[s]egregation of fees between multiple clients and/or multiple claims\nis required when it is possible.” Cline v.

However, we explained in Ultra I, ¶¶ 153, 226 P.3d at 936:\n\n              Section 30–5–303(b) provides that the prevailing party “in\n              any proceedings brought pursuant to this article” is entitled to\n              a fee award. The plain meaning of the term “proceedings” is\n              broad, especially when phrased in the plural. Black's Law\n              Dictionary 1324 (9th ed.2009) defines “proceeding” as “[t]he\n              regular and orderly progression of a lawsuit, including all acts\n              and events between the time of commencement and the entry\n              of judgment. Similarly, Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary\n              1807 (2002) defines “proceeding” in the context of law as\n              “[l]egal action; litigation.”\n\nIn Ultra I, ¶ 157, 266 P.3d at 937, we rejected the defendants’ claim that the plaintiffs\nwere entitled to fees only for the discrete WRPA claims. We concluded that many of the\nclaims for which the defendants sought segregation were inextricably intertwined with\ntheir WRPA claims. Id., citing City of Gillette v.

According to Ultra, fees\nshould not have been allowed for the plaintiffs’ abandoned or unsuccessful efforts to:\nobtain broader access to the defendants’ accounting documents; obtain access to\ndocuments from a former defendant who ultimately settled; obtain a determination of the\nfair market value of SWEPI’s gas because that issue was not finally decided; and enforce\nthe Supplemental Accounting Agreement.\n\n[¶77] Diverging from Ultra on this issue, SWEPI argues the plaintiffs were entitled to an\naward against it only as to the pre-2007 expense issue because SWEPI never tried to\ninclude division expenses in its post-trial NPI calculations. SWEPI also claims the\ndistrict court abused its discretion by failing to exclude from the award fees pertaining to\ngeneral investigation, evaluation of monthly NPI reports, and entries related to\ncorrespondence with non-parties, including those with whom the plaintiffs settled.\n\n[¶78] The district court ruled the WRPA applied to the post-judgment proceedings, the\nplaintiffs were the prevailing parties, and they were entitled to an award of reasonable\nattorney fees and costs. The district court rejected the defendants’ argument that the\nplaintiffs were required to segregate their fees related to the discrete WRPA issues,\nexplaining:\n\n                       The Court believes defendants have misapprehended\n               the language of the WRPA and misapplied the obligation to\n               segregate fees and expenses among defendants and/or claims.\n               The Court agrees with plaintiffs[’] characterization of the\n               proceedings related to their motion, specifically that all issues\n               (i.e. claims) in the current matter before the Court, and on\n               appeal,12 relate to a common nexus, a common cause, that\n               being to enforce their judgment and the requirement that the\n               defendants properly account for and pay the net profits\n               interest pursuant to the Court’s judgment and the Net Profits\n               Contract. In this endeavor, they were the prevailing party in\n               that they improved their position markedly in terms of the\n               accounting procedures and reporting requirements and in the\n               proper calculation of the amount ultimately due. In this\n               respect the Court agrees with the language from Hensley v.\n               Eckerhart, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">425</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 435 (1982) cited in support of a\n               comprehensive fee award.\n12\n   This reference to issues “on appeal” recognizes that the district court’s attorney fee decision was\nentered after the defendants had already appealed the decision on the merits. The district court had\ncontinuing jurisdiction, after the defendants appealed its order on the merits, to consider and award\nattorney fees. W.R.C.P. 58; Shindell v. Shindell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2670970\"><a href=\"/opinion/2670970/kimberly-shindell-v-roger-shindell/\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WY</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 28, n.2, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">322</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1270</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1277, n.2 (Wyo.\n2014).\n                                                  33\n\f               “Many civil rights cases will present only a single claim. In\n               other cases the plaintiff's claims for relief will involve a\n               common core of facts or will be based on related legal\n               theories. Much of counsel’s time will be devoted generally to\n               the litigation as a whole, making it difficult to divide the\n               hours expended on a claim-by-claim basis. Such a lawsuit\n               cannot be viewed as a series of discrete claims. Instead the\n               district court should focus on the significance of the overall\n               relief obtained by the plaintiff in relation to the hours\n               reasonably expended on the litigation.”\n\n(footnote added).\n\n[¶79] The district court also stated that, although the post-judgment proceedings were\nnot as long or complicated as the original trial, the proceedings were comparable and\nnoted that this Court approved its $3.9 million attorney fee award in the first action. It\ncompared the affidavits submitted by the parties as to the reasonableness of the plaintiffs’\nattorney fees submission and stated that, applying the lodestar factors, 13 the $1,177,305\nrequested for the post judgment proceedings was “reasonable and appropriate in view of\nthe nature, complexity and extent of the entire litigation undertaken by plaintiffs in\nsupport of their efforts to enforce their judgment.”\n\n[¶80] The WRPA specifically addresses the requirements for reporting to oil and gas\ninterest owners and provides remedies for reporting failures, including attorney fees to\nprevailing parties. Wyo. Stat. Ann. §§ 30-5-303 & 305. The defendants did not properly\nreport to the plaintiffs at the beginning of the post-judgment period. The NPC report\nprovided by the defendants on July 23, 2010, was a simple two-page High Level\nSummary. After the plaintiffs filed their motion to enforce, the defendants began to\nprovide more information and the parties were eventually able to agree on a set of\nreporting forms. This agreement satisfied some of the issues in the post-judgment\nproceedings, although the plaintiffs continued to question whether the defendants were\nproperly applying the NPC accounting formula with regard to certain expenses.\n\n[¶81] Given the post-judgment issues focused on the defendants’ responsibilities under\nthe WRPA, the NPC and the judgment based upon the act and the contract, the district\ncourt’s refusal to require segregation of fees between WRPA and non-WRPA claims in\nthe post-judgment proceedings was consistent with our decision in Ultra I. For example,\nthe plaintiffs’ efforts to obtain information about the NPI accounting and their evaluation\n13\n   The lodestar test requires a determination of whether: “1) the fee charged represents the product of\nreasonable hours times a reasonable rate; and 2) other factors of discretionary application should be\nconsidered to adjust the fee upward or downward.” Ultra I, ¶ 162, 266 P.3d at 938. See Wyo. Stat. Ann.\n§ 1–14–126(b) (listing factors considered in awarding attorney fees).\n                                                  34\n\fof that information were certainly intertwined with enforcing the contract and the\ndefendants’ on-going reporting and payment obligations and clearly fell within the\nparameters of the WRPA. Other matters, including correspondence with non-parties, etc.\nare not so readily characterized as WRPA litigation. However, “[t]he burden is placed\nupon the party who is attacking the district court’s ruling to establish an abuse of\ndiscretion, and the ultimate issue is whether the court could reasonably conclude as it\ndid.” Joe’s Concrete & Lumber, Inc. v. Concrete Works of Colorado, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2465132\"><a href=\"/opinion/2465132/joes-concrete-v-concrete-works-of-colo/\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WY</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n¶ 12, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2465132\"><a href=\"/opinion/2465132/joes-concrete-v-concrete-works-of-colo/\"><span class=\"volume\">252</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 448 (Wyo. 2011). The defendants have not satisfied that burden.\nInstead, they simply list examples of items they claim should not have been approved in\nthe attorney fees award and refer us to their district court filings. In most respects, the\ndefendants’ argument is insufficient to establish the district court abused its discretion.\n\n[¶82] Nevertheless, we have determined the district court’s attorney fees award should\nbe modified in one regard. The plaintiffs stated, in their reply to the defendants’\nopposition to their fee request, that they did not contest a “reduction of fees associated\nwith clerical and filing matters.” The plaintiffs, therefore, revised their fee request by\neliminating those fees, making their total request $1,153,430.50. Despite the plaintiffs’\nconcession on the fees associated with clerical and filing activities, the district court\nawarded the plaintiffs their original request of $1,177,305.50. The district court should\nhave acknowledged the plaintiffs’ revision of their fees request and eliminated the\nassociated fees. We, therefore, rule that the attorney fees award should be revised to\nreflect the plaintiffs’ agreement and reduced to $1,153,430.50.\n\n                                    CONCLUSION\n\n[¶83] We conclude the district court properly assumed jurisdiction in this matter\npursuant to its inherent court powers and the Declaratory Judgments Act. In addition, we\nconclude the district court’s interpretation of the scope of the 2007 trial NPI\ndetermination is supported by the record and its interpretation of when expenses are\n“incurred” under the language of the NPC was correct. Finally, with one exception, the\ndefendants have not demonstrated the district court abused its discretion in awarding the\nplaintiffs attorney fees.\n\n[¶84] Affirmed, as revised.\n\n\n\n\n                                            35\n\f</pre>",
