The   panel    of     this   court    which\n\nconsidered Pace’s appeal concluded that the State of Louisiana, the\n\nLouisiana Department of Education and the Louisiana State Board of\n\nElementary and Secondary Education (State Defendants) were entitled\n\nto sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment from all of\n\nPace’s    claims.   The    panel   then     affirmed     the    district     court’s\n\ndismissal of Pace’s claims against the Bogalusa City School Board.\n\nWe took this case en banc, first to consider whether the state\n\ndefendants were entitled to immunity from Pace’s claims under the\n\nEleventh Amendment and, second, to consider the merits of Pace’s\n\nclaims under the IDEA, ADA and § 504.               For the reasons discussed\n\nbelow, we now conclude that the State waived its right to immunity\n\nunder the Eleventh Amendment and therefore the State defendants are\n\nnot entitled to immunity from Pace’s § 504 and IDEA claims.                    On the\n\nmerits,    we   conclude    that   the    district      court    did   not     err    in\n\ndismissing Pace’s IDEA claims and that the district court correctly\n\nconcluded that the dismissal of Pace’s IDEA claims precluded his\n\ninaccessibility claims under the ADA and § 504.                  We reject Pace’s\n\nargument    that    because     different      legal    standards      control       his\n\ninaccessibility      claims     under    ADA/504,      those    claims    were       not\n\nlitigated in his IDEA action.            A 1997 amendment and implementing\n\nregulations to the IDEA expressly require schools to comply with\n\nthe identical standards for new construction that ADA/504 and their\n\nregulations require.\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fI.    FACTUAL AND LEGAL BACKGROUND\n\n       The     factual      and     procedural        background        of    this     case     is\n\naccurately and succinctly presented in the panel opinion:\n\n            In 1994, at the age of fifteen, Travis Pace (Pace)\n       was enrolled at Bogalusa High School.             He is\n       developmentally delayed, confined to a wheelchair, and\n       suffers from cerebral palsy and bladder incontinence. In\n       July 1997, Pace’s mother requested a due process hearing\n       under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\n       (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. § 1400, et seq., as she believed that\n       Pace was denied a “free appropriate public education”\n       (FAPE) due to a lack of handicap accessible facilities at\n       Bogalusa High School and deficiencies in Pace’s\n       “individualized education programs” (IEPs). The hearing\n       officer found that the Bogalusa City Schools System2\n       provided Pace with a FAPE in compliance with the IDEA,\n       and the State Level Review Panel (SLRP) affirmed the\n       hearing officer’s decision.\n\n            In September 1997, Pace filed a complaint with the\n       Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Education\n       (OCR), alleging violations of § 504 of the Rehabilitation\n       Act (§ 504), 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), and Title II of the\n       Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12132.\n       The OCR and BCSB resolved allegations that the BCSB\n       operated services, programs, and activities that were\n       physically inaccessible to or unusable by individuals\n       with disabilities by entering into a voluntary written\n       agreement   under   which   the   BCSB   would   identify\n       accessibility barriers and the OCR would oversee the\n       development of a compliance plan.\n\n            In March 1999, Pace filed suit in federal district\n       court, seeking damages and injunctive relief against the\n       BCSB, the Louisiana State Board of Elementary and\n       Secondary Education, the Louisiana Department of\n       Education, and the State of Louisiana, alleging\n       violations of the IDEA, the ADA, § 504 of the\n       Rehabilitation Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and various state\n\n\n\n       2\n         The hearing examiner made hearings with regard to the Bogalusa City Schools System. In\nfederal court, Pace brought suit against the Bogalusa City School Board. For all practical purposes,\nthese two entities are the same and will be referred to as “BCSB.”\n\n                                               -3-\n\f       statutes.3 The district court bifurcated Pace’s IDEA and\n       non-IDEA claims. In separate orders, it affirmed the\n       SLRP decision by dismissing Pace’s IDEA claims, then\n       granted the defendants’ motions for summary judgment on\n       Pace’s non-IDEA claims. Pace appeals both decisions.\n\n\n              II.     STATE IMMUNITY UNDER THE ELEVENTH AMENDMENT\n\n       We consider first the defendants’ arguments that they are\n\nentitled        to    sovereign        immunity      from   Pace’s      claims      under      the\n\nEleventh Amendment. At the core of this Eleventh Amendment dispute\n\nis the question whether, when Louisiana accepted particular federal\n\nfunds, it waived the immunity afforded it by the Eleventh Amendment\n\nto suits under § 504 and the IDEA.4\n\nA.     THE TEXT      AND   FUNCTION   OF THE   ELEVENTH AMENDMENT\n\n       We start, as always, with the text.                       The Eleventh Amendment\n\nstates:\n\n                The Judicial power of the United States shall not be\n                construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,\n                commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States\n                by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects\n                of any Foreign State.5\n\nThese forty-three words —— adopted in swift response to the Supreme\n\n\n\n\n       3\n        We do not consider Pace’s § 1983 claim and state law claims because he did not brief them\non appeal. L & A Contracting Co. v. S. Concrete Servs., Inc., 17 F.3d 106, 113 (5th Cir. 1994);\nF.R.A.P. 28(a)(9)(A).\n       4\n         The waiver argument does not apply to Title II because the ADA does not condition the\nreceipt of federal funds on compliance with the Act or waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity.\nRather, Title II applies to public entities regardless of whether they receive federal funds. See 42\nU.S.C. § 12132.\n       5\n           U.S. CONST. amend. XI.\n\n                                                 -4-\n\fCourt’s holding in Chisholm v. Georgia6 that Article III permitted\n\na state to be sued in federal court7 —— protect states from such\n\nlitigation.8 The protection thus afforded, however, has long since\n\nbeen expanded beyond the plain text of the Amendment.                             “Though its\n\nprecise terms bar only federal jurisdiction over suits brought\n\nagainst one State by citizens of another State or foreign state,”\n\nthe Supreme Court’s interpretation of the Amendment has “recognized\n\nthat the Eleventh Amendment accomplished much more.”9                            The immunity\n\nafforded to states under the Eleventh Amendment “implicates the\n\nfundamental constitutional balance between the Federal Government\n\nand the States.”10            Therefore, at its core, the Eleventh Amendment\n\nserves        “as     an     essential       component        of     our     constitutional\n\nstructure.”11\n\n       Nevertheless, Eleventh Amendment immunity is not absolute.                                A\n\nnumber of different circumstances may lead to a state’s litigating\n\n\n\n       6\n           2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 419 (1793).\n       7\n        See United States ex rel. Foulds v. Texas Tech Univ., 171 F.3d 279, 286 n.9 (5th Cir. 1999)\n(“The Supreme Court’s interpretation of Article III powers in Chisholm, prompted Congress’\n‘outraged reversal’ of that decision through enactment of the Eleventh Amendment.”) (citing DAVID\nP. CURRIE, THE CONSTITUTION IN THE SUPREME COURT: THE FIRST HUNDRED YEARS 99 (1985)).\n       8\n         For present purposes, we ignore any role the Eleventh Amendment plays in regulating\nwhether states may be sued in state courts.\n       9\n        College Savings Bank v.

We begin with\n\nan overview of the Court’s current framework for assessing when a\n\nsuit against a state may proceed in federal court.\n\nB.     EXCEPTIONS     TO   ELEVENTH AMENDMENT IMMUNITY\n\n       There are two fundamental exceptions to the general rule that\n\nbars an action in federal court filed by an individual against a\n\nstate.        First,       a   state’s       Eleventh       Amendment        immunity         may   be\n\nabrogated when Congress acts under § 5, the Enforcement Clause of\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment.12                 Second, a state may consent to suit in\n\nfederal court.13\n\n       1.      Abrogation under § 5 of the Fourteenth\n               Amendment\n\n       Congress        can     single-handedly            strip      the     states      of    their\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity and thereby authorize federal court\n\nsuits by individuals against the states.                          When Congress does this,\n\nit is exercising its power to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n\nIn Reickenbacker v. Foster,14 we examined the Supreme Court’s cases\n\n\n       12\n          U.S. CONST. amend. XIV, § 5 (“The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate\nlegislation, the provisions of this article.”).\n       13\n          The term “abrogation” is not synonymous with “consent” or “waiver.” When a state\nconsents to suit or waives its Eleventh Amendment immunity, it knowingly and voluntarily forfeits\nthe immunity’s protections. In contrast, when Congress acts under its Fourteenth Amendment power\nto abrogate, the state has no choice.\n       14\n            274 F.3d 974 (5th Cir. 2001). The continuing validity of Reickenbacker following the\nSupreme Court’s decision in Tennessee v. Lane, 124 S. Ct. 1978 (2004), is uncertain. At the very\nleast, its holding has been overruled as to Title II claims implicating a person’s fundamental right of\naccess to the courts. In addition, after Lane we do not look solely at the state level for a history and\npattern of unconstitutional action; we also examine discrimination by nonstate government entities.\n\n                                                 -6-\n\fconcerning congressional abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity\n\nunder § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment and derived the following\n\ntest for determining whether a federal statute is a valid exercise\n\nof Congress’s power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment and,\n\nconsequently, whether the statute abrogates Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity: (1) The statute must contain an unequivocal statement of\n\ncongressional intent to abrogate; (2) Congress must have identified\n\na history and pattern of unconstitutional action by the states; and\n\n(3)    the      rights      and   remedies         created      by    the    statute       must     be\n\ncongruent         and    proportional         to    the    constitutional           violation(s)\n\nCongress sought to remedy or prevent.15 If these three requirements\n\nare satisfied, states are subject to federal jurisdiction in suits\n\nunder the statute adopted pursuant to § 5, regardless of any\n\nabsence of consent.\n\n       2.        Waiver of Immunity by Consent\n\n       Either in the absence of § 5 abrogation or in addition to it,\n\na state always has the prerogative of foregoing its protection from\n\nfederal court jurisdiction under the Eleventh Amendment.16                                            A\n\n\nLane, 124 S. Ct. at 1991 n.16.\n       15\n            Id. at 977, 981-83.\n       16\n          College Savings Bank, 527 U.S. at 670; Idaho v. Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U.S.\n261, 267 (1997) (“[A] State can waive its Eleventh Amendment protection and allow a federal court\nto hear and decide a case commenced or prosecuted against it.”); Great N. Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322\nU.S. 47, 54 (1944) (“The immunity may, of course, be waived.”); Clark v. Barnard, 108 U.S. 436,\n447 (1883) (“The immunity from suit belonging to a State, which is respected and protected by the\nConstitution within the limits of the judicial power of the United States, is a personal privilege which\nit may waive at pleasure.”).\n\n                                                 -7-\n\fstate’s consent to suit must be both knowing and voluntary.                               That\n\nconsent must always be “knowing and voluntary” follows from College\n\nSavings Bank, in which the Supreme Court cited Johnson v. Zerbst,\n\nto define what constitutes effective waiver.17                          Waiver is effective\n\nwhen it is the “intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a\n\nknown     right         or    privilege.”18             The    first    part,     “intentional\n\nrelinquishment,” captures the principle of voluntariness; and the\n\nsecond part, “known right or privilege,” captures the element of\n\nknowingness.\n\n     When Congress conditions the availability of federal funds on\n\na state’s waiver of its Eleventh Amendment immunity, we employ a\n\nfive-prong        test        derived      from    the        Supreme   Court’s     definitive\n\nspending power case, South Dakota v. Dole,19 to ascertain the\n\nvalidity of the waiver.                        In Dole, South Dakota challenged a\n\ncongressional           statute         that    conditions       the    states’    receipt   of\n\nfederal highway funds on their adoption of the minimum drinking age\n\nof twenty-one.                South Dakota argued that the statute exceeded\n\nCongress’s spending power and violated the Twenty-First Amendment.20\n\nThe Court rejected this argument, noting that even though Congress\n\nis   prohibited              by   the     Twenty-First          Amendment    from     directly\n\n\n     17\n          527 U.S. at 682 (citing Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464 (1938)).\n     18\n          Id. (quoting Zerbst, 304 U.S. at 464)\n     19\n          483 U.S. 203 (1987).\n     20\n          Id. at 205.\n\n                                                  -8-\n\fregulating the distribution of alcoholic beverages, the Spending\n\nClause authorizes it indirectly to entice states to raise their\n\ndrinking age by dangling the proverbial carrot of federal dollars.21\n\n       Dole      embodies       an    expansive        interpretation           of    Congress’s\n\nspending       authority.             Indirect       persuasion         is    constitutional,\n\nreasoned the Court, because the spending power “is not limited by\n\nthe direct grants of legislative power found in the Constitution.”22\n\nCongress       can,     therefore,         validly       use    its     spending        power     to\n\nlegislate conditions on the disbursement of federal funds even\n\nthough those conditions would be unconstitutional if enacted as\n\ndirect prohibitions.23               It goes without saying that, because states\n\nhave the independent power to lay and collect taxes, they retain\n\nthe ability to avoid the imposition of unwanted federal regulation\n\nsimply by rejecting federal funds.\n\n       Nevertheless, Congress’s power to effect policy through the\n\nexercise of its spending power is not unlimited.

Halderman,26 the Court\n\nanalyzed Congress’s power to impose conditions on a state’s receipt\n\nof federal funds and pronounced:\n\n               There can, of course, be no knowing acceptance if a State\n               is unaware of the conditions or is unable to ascertain\n               what is expected of it. Accordingly, if Congress intends\n               to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it\n               must do so unambiguously.... By insisting that Congress\n               speak with a clear voice, we enable the States to\n               exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of the\n               consequences of their participation.27\n\nThus, we know that this stringent clear-statement rule ensures that\n\nwhen a state foregoes its Eleventh Amendment immunity in exchange\n\nfor federal funds, it does so “knowingly.”28                In our reading of\n\nPennhurst, the only “knowledge” that the Court is concerned about\n\nis a state’s knowledge that a Spending Clause condition requires\n\nwaiver of immunity, not a state’s knowledge that it has immunity\n\nthat it could assert.                At bottom, we conclude that if Congress\n\nsatisfies the clear-statement rule, the knowledge prong of the\n\nSpending Clause waiver analysis is fulfilled.\n\n               ii.     Non-Coercive: “Voluntary”\n\n     If the clear-statement rule is satisfied, a state’s actual\n\nacceptance of clearly conditioned funds is generally voluntary.\n\n\n\n     26\n          451 U.S. 1 (1981).\n     27\n          Id. at 17 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).\n     28\n          See also Dole, 483 U.S. at 207.\n\n                                              -11-\n\fThe only exception to this presumption arises if the spending\n\nprogram itself is deemed “coercive,” for then a state’s waiver is,\n\nby definition, no longer voluntary.\n\n     In summary, the Supreme Court has articulated two ways that a\n\nstate can be subject to an individual’s suit in federal court,\n\nregardless of the Eleventh Amendment. First, Congress may abrogate\n\nstate immunity. Second, the state may waive its Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity by consent.      If waiver results from participation in a\n\nSpending Clause program, the program must be a valid exercise of\n\nCongress’s spending power; the waiver condition must satisfy the\n\nclear-statement rule (thereby ensuring that the state’s waiver is\n\n“knowing”); and the program must be non-coercive (automatically\n\nestablishing that the waiver is “voluntary”).\n\nC.   WAIVER OF ELEVENTH AMENDMENT IMMUNITY PURSUANT   TO   CONDITIONAL\n     SPENDING PROGRAMS\n\n     Keeping firmly in mind the Court’s current framework for\n\nanalyzing when a state may be subject to suit in federal court, we\n\nturn to the particular facts and legal contentions of the instant\n\ncase.   The two statutory provisions at issue purport to have\n\nconditioned Louisiana’s receipt of federal funds on its waiver of\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity to suits under § 504 and the IDEA.\n\nSpecifically, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-7 conditions a state’s receipt of\n\nfederal money on its waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity to\n\nactions under § 504 and other federal anti-discrimination statutes:\n\n           A State shall not be immune under the Eleventh\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f               Amendment of the Constitution of the United States from\n               suit in Federal court for a violation of section 504 of\n               the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, title IX of the\n               Education Amendments of 1972, the Age Discrimination\n               Act of 1975, title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n               or the provisions of any other Federal statute\n               prohibiting discrimination by recipients of Federal\n               financial assistance.29\n\nSimilarly, 20 U.S.C. § 140330 conditions a state’s receipt of\n\nfederal IDEA          funds     on    its    consent       to    suit under         that     Act.31\n\nApplying the framework set forth in Dole, we proceed to determine\n\nwhether Louisiana validly waived its immunity when it accepted the\n\nconditioned federal dollars.\n\n       Louisiana does not dispute that the first and third prongs of\n\nthe Dole analysis, i.e., whether the Spending Clause statute at\n\nissue was enacted in pursuit of the general welfare, and whether\n\nthe condition is sufficiently related to the federal interest in\n\n\n\n\n       29\n           42 U.S.C. § 2000d-7(a)(1). Congress enacted § 2000d-7 in response to Atascadero, in\nwhich the Court held that the Rehabilitation Act neither abrogated Eleventh Amendment immunity\nnor effectively conditioned states’ receipt of federal funds on a waiver of that immunity. Atascadero,\n473 U.S. at 245-47. According to the Court, the statute did not contai n a clear statement of\ncongressional intent either to abrogate or to require a waiver. Id.\n       30\n          20 U.S.C. § 1403(a) reads as follows: “A State shall not be immune under the eleventh\namendment to the Constitution of the United States from suit in Federal court for a violation of this\nchapter.”\n       31\n          The section was passed by Congress in response to Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U.S. 223 (1989).\nIn Dellmuth, the Supreme Court held that the predecessor to the IDEA (the Education of the\nHandicapped Act) lacked a sufficiently clear statement of Congressional intent to abrogate Eleventh\nAmendment immunity to claims under the statute. Id. at 232. The conditional-spending issue was\nnot raised in the case.\n\n                                               -13-\n\fthe program funded,32 are satisfied here. Consequently, we restrict\n\nour consideration to the three remaining prongs of the Dole test.\n\nFollowing prior panels of this court,33 and every circuit (but one)\n\nthat has made these inquiries, we conclude that the statutes at\n\nissue validly conditioned Louisiana’s receipt of these federal\n\nfunds on its waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity.34\n\n\n       32\n           In its en banc brief, Louisiana mentioned a relatedness challenge to § 2000d-7, but that\nargument was not presented to the panel, and Louisiana’s en banc brief fails to develop it beyond a\nbare assertion. Thus, Louisiana has waived its relatedness challenge. See L & A Contracting Co. v.\nS. Concrete Servs., Inc., 17 F.3d 106, 113 (5th Cir. 1994); FED. R. APP. P. 28(a)(9)(A); cf. Koslow\nv. Pennsylvania, 302 F.3d 161, 175-76 (3d Cir. 2002) (rejecting a relatedness challenge to the validity\nof a state’s conditional-spending waiver of immunity to § 504 suits).\n       33\n           E.g., Pederson v. Louisiana State Univ., 213 F.3d 858, 876 (5th Cir. 2000) (“A state may\nwaive its immunity by voluntarily participating in federal spending programs when Congress expresses\na clear intent to condition participation in the programs ... on a State’s consent to waive its\nconstitutional immunity.”) (citation and quotation marks omitted); id. at 875 (holding that “in\nenacting § 2000d-7 Congress permissibly conditioned a state university’s receipt of [federal] funds\non an unambiguous waiver of the university’s Eleventh Amendment immunity, and that, in accepting\nsuch funding, the university has consented to litigate private suits in federal court.”) (internal\npunctuation and citation omitted) (emphasis added).

Inc.,\n238 F.3d 636, 645 (5th Cir.), reh’g en banc denied, 252 F.3d 437 (2001) (“[A]fter College Savings,\nCongress may still obtain a non-verbal voluntary waiver of a state’s Eleventh Amendment immunity,\nif the waiver can be inferred from the state’s conduct in accepting a gratuity after being given clear\nand unambiguous statutory notice that it was conditioned on waiver of immunity.”).\n       34\n          Eight circuits have reached this conclusion in § 504 cases. See Nieves-Márquez v.\nPuerto Rico, 353 F.3d 108, 129-30 (1st Cir. 2003); A.W. v. Jersey\nCity Pub. Schs., 341 F.3d 234, 244-51 (3d Cir. 2003); Bruggeman v.\nBlagojevich, 324 F.3d 906, 912 (7th Cir. 2003); Garrett v. Univ. of Ala. at Birmingham Bd. of Trs.,\n344 F.3d 1288, 1292-93 (11th Cir. 2003) (per curiam); Lovell v. Chandler, 303 F.3d 1039, 1051-52\n(9th Cir. 2002); Koslow, 302 F.3d at 172 (3d Cir.); Robinson v. Kansas, 295 F.3d 1183, 1189-90\n(10th Cir. 2002); Nihiser v. Ohio E.P.A., 269 F.3d 626, 628 (6th Cir. 2001); Jim C. v. Arkansas\nDep’t of Educ., 235 F.3d 1079, 1081 (8th Cir. 2000) (en banc); Stanley v. Litscher, 213 F.3d 340,\n344 (7th Cir. 2000). Other courts of appeals have reached the same conclusion for the other\npredicate statutes of § 2000d-7. See, e.g., Cherry v. Univ. of Wis. Sys. Bd. of Regents, 265 F.3d\n541, 553-55 (7th Cir. 2001) (Title IX); Sandoval v. Hagan, 197 F.3d 484 (11th Cir. 1999) (Title VI),\nrev’d in part on other grounds, 532 U.S. 275 (2001); Litman v. George Mason Univ., 186 F.3d 544\n\n                                                -14-\n\f       First, we determine whether the conditions contained in 42\n\nU.S.C.       §    2000d-7      and     20   U.S.C.      §    1403     are    unambiguous         and,\n\nconsequently, whether Louisiana knowingly waived its immunity to\n\nactions under § 504 and the IDEA by accepting federal funds.\n\n       1.        Is the Clear-Statement Rule Satisfied Absent\n                 Use of the Words “Waiver” or “Condition”?\n\n       In the face of the unequivocal language of § 2000d-7 to the\n\neffect that “[a] state shall not be immune under the Eleventh\n\nAmendment of the Constitution of the United States from suit in\n\nFederal court for a violation of § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of\n\n1973,”35 Louisiana argues legalistically that, because Congress did\n\nnot use the words “waiver” or “condition,” the condition fails the\n\nclear-statement rule.36                  This argument —— that absent talismanic\n\nincantations of magic words, there can be no waiver —— is little\n\nmore than frivolous.37               The Supreme Court has already noted, albeit\n\nin dicta, that in § 2000d-7 “Congress sought to provide the sort of\n\nunequivocal waiver that our precedents demand.”38 More importantly,\n\n\n(4th Cir. 1999) (Title IX). Circuits have reached this conclusion about the IDEA, as well. See, e.g.,\nM.A. ex rel. E.S. v. State-Operated School Dist., 344 F.3d 335, 351 (3d Cir. 2003); Oak Park Bd.\nof Educ. v. Kelly E., 207 F.3d 931, 935 (7th Cir. 2000).\n       35\n            42 U.S.C. § 2000d-7 (2000).\n       36\n            In its amicus brief, the State of Texas points to other statutes that have used such terms.\n       37\n           Cf. Woods v. Cloyd W. Miller Co., 333 U.S. 138, 144 (1948) (“The question of the\nconstitutionality of action taken by Congress does not depend on recitals of the power which it\nundertakes to exercise.”).\n       38\n        Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, 198 (1996). See also id. at 200 (noting “the care with which\nCongress responded to ...

Louisiana State University, which we\n\nremain convinced was correctly decided, forecloses this line of\n\nattack.39\n\n         2.         Does the Presence of Abrogation Language\n                    Preclude a Finding of Waiver?\n\n         Louisiana also argues that because § 2000d-7 and § 1403 fail\n\nas   §        5   attempts       by    Congress     to    abrogate      Eleventh      Amendment\n\nimmunity, the same provisions of those statutes cannot satisfy the\n\nclear-statement rule for Spending Clause purposes.                                   We reject\n\nLouisiana’s            attempt        to    pigeonhole    this    statutory       language    in\n\nmutually exclusive terms.\n\n         We held in Pederson that, in § 2000d-7, Congress “successfully\n\ncodified a statute which clearly, unambiguously, and unequivocally\n\nconditions receipt of federal funds under Title IX on the State’s\n\nwaiver of Eleventh Amendment Immunity.”40                        And in Lesage v. Texas,41\n\nwe ruled that “Congress unquestionably enacted 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-7\n\nwith          the     ‘intent’         to     invoke     the     Fourteenth        Amendment’s\n\ncongressional enforcement power. The purpose of the provision,\n\nenacted in 1986, was to legislatively overrule the result in\n\n\n\n\nAmendment immunity”).\n         39\n         213 F.3d at 875-76 (adopting the holding and reasoning of Litman v. George Mason\nUniv., 186 F.3d 544 (4th Cir. 1999)).\n         40\n              213 F.3d at 876.\n         41\n              158 F.3d 213 (5th Cir. 1998), overruled on other grounds, 528 U.S. 18 (1999).\n\n                                                 -16-\n\fAtascadero.”42           Thus, in Pederson, we recognized § 2000d-7 as a\n\nclear statement for waiver vis-à-vis the Spending Clause, and in\n\nLesage, we recognized that the very same provision could satisfy\n\nabrogation under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n       Just because particular language may or may not function with\n\nequal       efficacy       under     both   exceptions        to    Eleventh       Amendment\n\nimmunity, does not mean that it fails the clear-statement rule. As\n\nwe concluded in AT&T, the rule requires only that “the state has\n\nbeen put on notice clearly and unambiguously by the federal statute\n\nthat the state’s particular conduct or transaction will subject it\n\nto federal court suits brought by individuals.”43 Congress need not\n\ndeclare in the statute whether it is proceeding under abrogation or\n\nwaiver, or both.               For the purpose of the clear-statement rule, §\n\n2000d-7 —— janus-faced as it may be —— poses no constitutional\n\nimpediment to our finding valid waiver by consent.                              We conclude\n\nthat    the       conditions       contained     in    §   2000d-7      and    §   1403     are\n\nunambiguous, as required by Dole.\n\n       Undaunted, Louisiana still contends that it did not knowingly\n\nwaive its Eleventh Amendment immunity.

Garrett45 to justify departing from the heavy weight\n\nof authority supporting waiver based on the clarity of the language\n\nin § 2000d-7.           Garrett examined whether, in Title I of the ADA,\n\nCongress could           constitutionally   abrogate   the   states’   Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity.46            The Garrett Court concluded that Title I of\n\nthe ADA was outside the scope of valid § 5 legislation; therefore,\n\nCongress’s attempt at abrogation failed, and private suits against\n\nstates in federal court were barred by the Eleventh Amendment.47\n\n     The lawsuits in Garcia involved disputes that arose between\n\nSeptember 1993 and August 1995.48           During that pre-Garrett period,\n\nit was universally accepted that the ADA validly abrogated Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity.              Rather than looking at the clear-statement\n\nrule and the state’s acceptance of funds, Garcia analyzed whether\n\na state would have realized —— “known” —— that it was abandoning\n\nits Eleventh Amendment immunity by accepting federal funds during\n\nthe period of time applicable to the lawsuits at issue there (and\n\nhere).49      The Garcia court noted that, during the relevant period,\n\n“Title II of the ADA was reasonably understood to abrogate [the\n\n\n     45\n          531 U.S. 356 (2001).\n     46\n          See id. at 365-74.\n     47\n          Id. at 374.\n     48\n          Garcia, 280 F.3d at 114 n.4.\n     49\n          Id. at 114.\n\n                                         -18-\n\fstate’s]         sovereign     immunity           under    Congress’s   Commerce    Clause\n\nauthority.”50          The court also pointed out that the requirements of\n\nTitle      II    and    §   504     are     “virtually      identical.”51       Therefore,\n\nconcluded the court, because the state defendant thought that it\n\ncould be sued under Title II, it had nothing to lose by accepting\n\nfederal funds and redundantly waiving immunity to § 504 suits in\n\nthe process.52\n\n      Louisiana and the dissent maintain that we should follow the\n\npanel and apply the “logic” of Garcia to the instant case.                          First,\n\nLouisiana         contends          that,        because    it   “believed”     that   the\n\nRehabilitation Act had already abrogated its Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity, it “did not and could not know that [it] retained any\n\nsovereign        immunity      to     waive       by   accepting    conditioned    federal\n\nfunds.”53        Likewise, Louisiana asks us to conclude that § 1403 was\n\nan   unsuccessful           attempt         at    abrogation;      therefore,   maintains\n\nLouisiana, it could not have “knowingly” waived its immunity under\n\nthe IDEA when it accepted federal IDEA funds.\n\n      Even though it found that the statutory provisions at issue\n\nare unambiguous,54 the panel nevertheless concluded that Louisiana’s\n\n\n      50\n           Id.\n      51\n           Id.\n      52\n           Id.\n      53\n           Pace, 325 F.3d at 616.\n      54\n           Pace, 325 F.3d at 615.\n\n                                                  -19-\n\fpurported         waivers     of     Eleventh    Amendment       immunity       are    invalid\n\nbecause they were not knowing.                   The panel drew support from the\n\nholding in Garcia, but its reasoning differed slightly from the\n\nSecond Circuit’s.             According to the panel opinion, “[b]elieving\n\nthat [the Rehabilitation Act and the IDEA] validly abrogated their\n\nsovereign immunity, the State defendants did not and could not know\n\nthat they retained any sovereign immunity to waive by accepting\n\nconditioned federal funds.”55\n\n       The fatal flaw with that syllogism lies in the fact that\n\nneither the mandates of the Rehabilitation Act nor the requirements\n\nof the IDEA apply to a state agency that has not received either\n\nsome federal funding (in the case of the Rehabilitation Act) or\n\nfederal IDEA dollars (in the case of the IDEA).56                         Therefore, it is\n\nimpossible for Congress to have “abrogated” a state’s immunity to\n\n§ 504 or IDEA suits if the relevant state agency did not receive\n\nfederal funds during the time period in which it was alleged to\n\nhave    violated        an    individual’s       statutory        rights.        It    follows\n\nindisputably that Louisiana’s Eleventh Amendment immunity to § 504\n\nand IDEA claims was intact before the state accepted federal funds.\n\nThus, Louisiana did have Eleventh Amendment immunity to waive by\n\naccepting the clearly conditioned federal funds.\n\n\n       55\n            Pace, 325 F.3d at 616.\n       56\n          See 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (pro hibiting discrimination against the disabled through “any\nprogram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance”); 20 U.S.C. §§ 1412, 1415 (conditioning\nstate agencies’ receipt of federal funds on compliance with the requirements of the IDEA).\n\n                                              -20-\n\f     The dissent nevertheless insists that, during the time that\n\n§ 504 and the IDEA were thought to abrogate Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity, Louisiana could have believed that it lacked immunity to\n\n§ 504 and IDEA suits even before it received federal funds under\n\nthose statutes.57    This ignores the conditional-spending nature of\n\nthe Rehabilitation      Act   and   the   IDEA.   The   Acts’   substantive\n\nprovisions regulate only state agencies that have accepted the\n\nrelevant federal funds.       Thus, it makes no sense to say that the\n\nState was subject to private actions for damages under § 504 and\n\nthe IDEA before the substantive provisions of those statutes\n\napplied to it.      Contrary to the dissent’s accusation,58 we do not\n\nconfuse the doctrines of abrogation and waiver; rather, we point\n\nout that ——     even before Garrett —— Louisiana could have avoided\n\nsuits under § 504 and the IDEA altogether by declining federal\n\nfunding.      Louisiana clearly had Eleventh Amendment immunity to\n\nwaive at the time that it accepted the federal funds and expressly\n\nobligated itself to comply with the dictates of the Rehabilitation\n\nAct and the IDEA.\n\n     Further, during the relevant time period, §§ 2000d-7 and 1403\n\nput each state on notice that, by accepting federal money, it was\n\n\n\n     57\n       Post at 9 (“[T]he State acted quite rationally in assuming\nbetween 1996 and 1998 that it had no sovereign immunity to waive\nwhen it accepted federal education funds under conditions specified\nby § 504 and IDEA.”).\n     58\n          Post at 10 & n.7.\n\n                                    -21-\n\fwaiving its Eleventh Amendment immunity. Under Dole, if the clear-\n\nstatement requirement is met, the state is conclusively presumed to\n\nhave “known” that receipt of clearly conditioned federal funds\n\nrequires the state to abide by the condition (i.e., waiver of\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity).\n\n     In addition, the Garcia approach is problematic for a number\n\nof reasons, the most fundamental of which is that, by focusing its\n\ninquiry on what the state could have believed, the Second Circuit\n\nengrafted a subjective-intent element onto the otherwise objective\n\nSpending Clause waiver inquiry.          In other words, Garcia’s approach\n\nemploys the wrong jurisprudential test, because it distorts what is\n\nnecessary      to   show     knowledge    for    Spending        Clause      waivers.\n\nAnalytically,       the    “knowledge”    question      that    we     ask   when   we\n\nundertake the Spending Clause waiver inquiry is coextensive with\n\nthe clear-statement rule; for, when a state actually accepts funds\n\nthat are clearly conditioned on a waiver of Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity, it is held objectively to “know” that it is accepting all\n\nclearly stated conditions.           That it might not “know” subjectively\n\nwhether   it    had   any    immunity    to    waive    by   agreeing        to   those\n\nconditions is wholly irrelevant.\n\n     The dissent asserts that, by focusing on the clear-statement\n\nrequirement, we have disregarded College Savings Bank’s “clear\n\ndeclaration” requirement.            But College Savings Bank was not a\n\nconditional-spending         case.        There,       the     Court    invalidated\n\n“constructive waivers” of Eleventh Amendment immunity “based upon\n\n                                        -22-\n\fthe State’s mere presence in a field subject to congressional\n\nregulation.”59            Such a constructive waiver is a far cry from a\n\nstate’s acceptance of federal funds that are explicitly conditioned\n\non its waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity.                     In fact, the College\n\nSavings Bank opinion expressly distinguished conditional-spending\n\nwaivers        of     Eleventh     Amendment         immunity,   which   it   said    were\n\n“fundamentally different from” illegitimate constructive waivers.60\n\nNothing in College Savings Bank indicates that, when the clear-\n\nstatement requirement is met, a state can be said to lack knowledge\n\nthat by accepting federal funds it waives its Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity.\n\n       In sum, Garcia and the dissent would subjugate the bright-line\n\nof objective reasoning to the slippery slope of assessing a state’s\n\nsubjective belief.61             If, like the panel, we were to follow that\n\napproach, we would be getting into the business of looking past the\n\nstraightforward objective facts, i.e., (1) the clear statement\n\nrequiring waiver and (2) the state’s actual, uncoerced acceptance\n\nof federal funds, in an attempt to fathom what was in a state’s\n\n“head,” a precarious exercise indeed.

This position is frivolous.\n\nWe    have     consistently          interpreted          Supreme       Court       guidance      as\n\npermitting such conditional spending programs, as has every other\n\ncircuit that has squarely addressed the issue.63                             We do not change\n\ncourse today.\n\n\n\n       62\n          Since the Pace panel opinion was issued, five circuits have expressly rejected its approach,\nwhich the dissent continues to advocate.

Is Conditioning Acceptance of Federal Funds a\n                Violation of the Unconstitutional-Conditions\n                Doctrine?\n\n        Louisiana        also     attempts        to    invoke      the     “unconstitutional-\n\nconditions doctrine” to challenge Congress’s ability to condition\n\nthe acceptance of federal funds on waiver of Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity.           In    the    most      general       sense,      the     unconstitutional-\n\nconditions         doctrine       examines        the     extent       to    which      government\n\nbenefits may be conditioned or distributed in ways that burden\n\nconstitutional rights or principles.64                          For at least two reasons,\n\nLouisiana’s reliance on the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine is\n\nmisplaced.\n\n        First, as evidenced by the dearth of cases employing it in\n\nthis context,65 the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine is most\n\nmeaningful when the government imposes a condition of questionable\n\nconstitutional character on an individual right. But here, federal\n\nand state sovereigns are on opposite sides of the controversy, and\n\n\n        64\n           See Frost & Frost Trucking Co. v. Railroad Com. of Cal., 271 U.S. 583, 593-94 (1926)\n(“[T]he state ... may not impose conditions which require the relinquishment of constitutional rights....\nIt is inconceivable that guaranties embedded in the Constitution of the United States may thus be\nmanipulated out of existence.”).\n        65\n         The only Supreme Court decision that has come close was United States v. Butler. In that\n1936 decision, the Court invalidated provisions of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, which\npaid farmers to reduce their production of crops. 297 U.S. at 74-78. As the Tenth Circuit has\nexplained, though, “that case relied on an overly narrow view of Congress’ enumerated powers to\ndetermine that Congress had overstepped its authority.” Kansas v. United States, 214 F.3d 1196,\n1201 n.6 (10th Cir. 2000) (citing LAURENCE H. TRIBE, AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW § 5-b, at\n836 (3d ed. 2000) (“[T]he Supreme Co urt has effectively ignored Butler in judging the limits of\ncongressional spending power.”)). Accord Lipscomb, 299 F.3d at 319 (noting that the Supreme\nCourt “quickly abandoned” the view espoused in Butler).\n\n                                                 -25-\n\fthe constitutional “right” at issue is structural rather than\n\npersonal.         Consequently, for the reasons announced in the Third\n\nCircuit’s analysis in Koslow v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the\n\ndoctrine is inapplicable.             The Koslow court considered whether the\n\nRehabilitation           Act,      including          §    2000d-7,         imposed        an\n\nunconstitutional condition on Pennsylvania’s receipt of federal\n\nfunds.       In    refusing      to   apply     the   unconstitutional-conditions\n\ndoctrine to the conditioning of federal funds on the waiver of\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity, the Third Circuit stated:\n\n              [T]he   Supreme  Court    has  not   yet  applied   the\n              “unconstitutional conditions” doctrine to cases between\n              two sovereigns. Unlike private persons, states have the\n              resources to serve their citizens even if the federal\n              government, through economic incentives, encourages a\n              particular result. A state’s political powers——not the\n              least of which is the power to levy taxes on its\n              citizens——help ensure the federal government does not\n              “coerce” the state through economic “encouragement.” An\n              individual citizen, in contrast, lacks these formidable\n              institutional resources.66\n\nWe embrace that reasoning.\n\n       Second, the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine, even when\n\napplied piecemeal by the Supreme Court, is anchored at least in\n\npart in a theory of coercion or compulsion.67 In this context, that\n\n\n\n\n       66\n         302 F.3d at 174 (citing Frost & Frost, 271 U.S. at 593; New York, 505 U.S. at 171-72;\nDole, 483 U.S. at 210-11).\n       67\n         See id. (“The “unconstitutional conditions” doctrine is based on the proposition that\ngovernment incentives may be inherently coercive.”). See also Kathleen M. Sullivan,\nUnconstitutional Conditions, 102 HARV. L. REV. 1415, 1428-55 (1989).\n\n                                            -26-\n\fconcern is subsumed in the non-coercion prong of the Dole test.68\n\nIn other words, in the Spending Clause context, any role that the\n\nunconstitutional-conditions                    doctrine        might       have      in     cabining\n\nCongress’s authority to give funds in exchange for waiving immunity\n\nis    already         part-and-parcel           of    the      standard        Spending        Clause\n\nanalysis.           Thus, no independent constitutional bar invalidates\n\nLouisiana’s waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n\n        5.        Are These Programs Coercive?\n\n        In light of Dole, we must determine whether the conditional-\n\nspending schemes at issue are unduly coercive.                               We hold that they\n\nare not.          A state can prevent suits against a particular agency\n\nunder § 504 by declining federal funds for that agency.69                                    A state\n\ncan avoid suit under the IDEA merely by refusing IDEA funds.                                      And,\n\nto do so in either case, the state would not have to refuse all\n\nfederal assistance.70              Moreover, no circuit has accepted a coercion\n\nchallenge          to    either      the     Rehabilitation            Act      or    the      IDEA.71\n\nTherefore, we refuse to invalidate Louisiana’s waiver on coercion\n\ngrounds.\n\n\n\n\n        68\n             See supra text accompanying note 24.\n        69\n             See 29 U.S.C. § 794(b)(1).\n        70\n             See 20 U.S.C. §§ 1411(a)(1), 1412, 1403.\n        71\n          See, e.g., Jim C., 235 F.3d at 1082 (rejecting a coercion challenge to the validity of a waiver\nof state Eleventh Amendment immunity to § 504 claims).\n\n                                                 -27-\n\fD.     ABROGATION      OF   IMMUNITY\n\n       Alternatively, Pace asks this en banc court to rule that\n\nCongress —— acting under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment —— in fact\n\nabrogated          Louisiana’s          Eleventh       Amendment    immunity,        leaving\n\nLouisiana subject to suit on Pace’s ADA, Rehabilitation Act, and\n\nIDEA claims.                As we hold that Louisiana waived its Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity with respect to the Rehabilitation Act and the\n\nIDEA, it is not necessary for us to address Pace’s contention that\n\nLouisiana’s           immunity     to    suit    under     those    statutes      was     also\n\nabrogated.           Neither is it necessary for us to consider whether\n\nTitle II of the ADA abrogates Eleventh Amendment immunity in this\n\ncase.       First, the Supreme Court, in Tennessee v. Lane,72 held that\n\nTitle II          abrogates      sovereign       immunity    to    the   extent     that     it\n\nimplicates the accessibility of judicial services, but refused to\n\nconsider         its       application     to     other     rights,      including      those\n\nconsidered to be fundamental under the Constitution.73                         Because (1)\n\nthe Supreme Court has never before recognized access to public\n\neducation74 or freedom from disability discrimination in education75\n\nto be fundamental rights, and (2) it is unnecessary to address\n\n\n       72\n            124 S.

IDEA\n\n       We agree with and adopt that portion of the panel opinion\n\naffirming the district court’s judgment which in turn affirmed the\n\nadministrative determination that Pace was not entitled to relief\n\nunder the IDEA.\n\n       We pause only to emphasize the somewhat unusual nature of a\n\nproceeding under the IDEA. As required by the statute,85 Pace first\n\npursued his administrative claim.                      He was granted a hearing by a\n\nhearing examiner           where      he   had    an    opportunity        to    present      his\n\nevidence demonstrating that the inaccessibility of various portions\n\nof the Bogalusa campus prevented him from receiving a free and\n\nappropriate public education (FAPE).                     The hearing examiner, after\n\nhearing the evidence and making a personal inspection of the\n\ncampus, rejected Pace’s inaccessibility claims and concluded that\n\nthe defendants had complied with the IDEA and had provided a FAPE\n\nto Pace.86 Pace then challenged the hearing examiner’s findings and\n\nconclusion in his administrative appeal to the State Level Review\n\nPanel (SLRP).          The SLRP also rejected Pace’s claims and affirmed\n\nthe hearing examiner in all respects.87                       Pace then filed suit in\n\nfederal district court as authorized by 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(1)(A).\n\n       85\n            See 20 U.S.C. 1415(l).\n       86\n       The hearing examiner thoroughly reviewed the testimony and\nphysical evidence presented to her and rejected in wholesale\nfashion Pace’s various claims of inaccessibility. R. 94.\n       87\n          The language used by the SLRP also makes it clear that this review panel found absolutely\nno merit to Pace’s inaccessibility claims. R. 64-65.\n\n                                              -32-\n\fA district court in which such an action is filed must receive the\n\nrecord generated by the administrative proceeding and also hear\n\nadditional evidence presented by the parties.88 The court must then\n\ngive “due weight” to the hearing officer’s finding and make a de\n\nnovo determination based on a preponderance of the evidence.\n\nTeague Independent School District v. Todd L, 999 F.2d 127, 131 (5th\n\nCir. 1993).        The district court considered all of Pace’s claims of\n\ninaccessibility           that      he     raised       during       the      administrative\n\nproceedings.89 The court considered the administrative record along\n\nwith the new evidence offered by Pace and gave “due weight” to the\n\nfindings of the hearing examiner and SLRP. Ultimately, the district\n\ncourt agreed with the hearing examiner that Bogalusa High School\n\nhad provided Pace with a FAPE by complying with the IDEA in all\n\n\n       88\n       See 20 U.S.C. § 1415 (i)(2) (A) (Any party aggrieved by the\nfindings and decisions...shall have the right to bring a civil\naction with respect to the complaint pursuant to this section,\nwhich action may be brought...in a district court of the United\nStates...).\n       89\n         Pace sought relief from the district court to remedy the school board’s refusal to make the\nfollowing areas accessible:\n\n               •       bathroom facilities\n               •       classrooms on the second rather than first floor of the school\n               •       elevator access\n               •       exiting classroom during fire drills\n               •       cafeteria\n               •       school health center\n               •       auditorium\n               •       music room\n               •       insufficient parking spaces\n               •       lack of ramps (accessible entrances)\n\n\n                                              -33-\n\faspects,    including         that    the    campus    was   accessible   to   the\n\nwheelchair-bound Pace.           The district court’s conclusion is fully\n\nsupported by the record and we therefore affirm the district\n\ncourt’s rejection of Pace’s claims under the IDEA.\n\nB.   ADA   AND   SECTION 504\n\n     In addition to his IDEA claims, Pace also asserted claims\n\nunder the ADA and § 504 in his suit.                  The district court severed\n\nthe IDEA claims from these non-IDEA claims.                    After dismissing\n\nPace’s IDEA claims, the district court then considered defendants’\n\nmotion for summary judgment seeking exoneration under § 504 and the\n\nADA. The district court granted the defendants’ motion for summary\n\njudgment on grounds that the factual bases for the non-IDEA claims\n\nwere indistinct from the resolved IDEA claims.                The district court\n\nconcluded further that principles of issue preclusion applied to\n\npreclude Pace from pursuing his redundant non-IDEA claims.                     Pace\n\nargues that the district court committed legal error in applying\n\nprinciples of issue preclusion to bar his non-IDEA claims.\n\n     Issue preclusion or collateral estoppel is appropriate when:\n\n(1) the identical issue was previously adjudicated; (2) the issue\n\nwas actually litigated; and (3) the previous determination was\n\nnecessary to the decision.                  See Southmark Corp. v. Coopers &\n\nLybrand (In re: Southmark Corp.), 163 F.3d 925, 932 (5th Cir. 1999).\n\nIn Southmark we also found that the “relitigation of an issue is\n\nnot precluded unless the facts and the legal standard used to\n\nassess them       are   the    same    in    both   proceedings.”   Id.   (quoting\n\n                                            -34-\n\fRecoverEdge L.P. v. Pentecost, 44 F.3d 1284, 1281 (5th Cir. 1995)).\n\nIssues of fact are not “identical” or “the same,” and therefore not\n\npreclusive, if the legal standards governing their resolution are\n\n“significantly different.”90 Pace argues that the accessibility\n\nissues the court litigated under the IDEA were for the limited\n\npurpose of determining whether the Bogalusa High School provided\n\nPace with a FAPE under that statute. Thus, Pace contends, because\n\na   “significantly            different”         legal       standard        applies        to     his\n\naccessibility issues under the ADA and § 504, these latter claims\n\nwere never litigated and issue preclusion should not apply. We\n\ntherefore compare the standards of accessibility under the IDEA on\n\nthe one hand and the ADA and § 504 on the other to determine\n\nwhether the legal standards are “significantly different.”\n\n       As    indicated        above,       the    IDEA     requires        states      and       local\n\neducational agencies receiving federal IDEA funds to make a FAPE\n\navailable to children with certain disabilities between the ages of\n\n3 and 21.        The IDEA imposes extensive requirements on schools to\n\nsafeguard the disabled child’s right to a FAPE.                            20 U.S.C. §§ 1414,\n\n1415.       In determining whether a school has provided a student with\n\n\n\n       90\n          See, e.g., 18 JAMES WM. MOORE, ET AL., MOORE’S FEDERAL PRACTICE 3d § 132.02[2][h]\n(3d ed. 2001). Courts have used slightly differing language to express this idea that legal issues are\nnot “identical” for issue preclusion purposes if they are significantly different. Compare Raytech Corp.\nv. White, 54 F.3d 187, 191 (3d Cir. 1995) (the differences in the standards must be “substantial”)\nwith Talcott v. Allahabad Bank, Ltd., 444 F.2d 451, 460 (5th Cir. 1971) (the legal standards are not\nidentical for issue preclusion purposes only when there is a “demonstrable difference” in the legal\nstandards by which the facts are evaluated). For purposes of this appeal, these distinctions are\nirrelevant.\n\n                                                 -35-\n\fa FAPE, the focus is on the Individualized Education Plan (IEP), a\n\nwritten statement prepared by a team consisting of a representative\n\nof the local school district, the disabled child’s teachers, the\n\nchild’s parents and the child.           20 U.S.C. § 1414(d).          The IEP\n\nincludes the child’s educational performance, his goals, the nature\n\nof his disabilities, and a description of the educational and\n\nrelated services that will be provided for the child to meet the\n\nstated objectives.   The objective is always to tailor the FAPE to\n\nthe particular needs of the child.              Cypress Fairbanks ISD v.\n\nMichael F., 118 F.3d 245, 247 (5th Cir. 1997).\n\n     The goal of the IDEA is to require a FAPE that will permit the\n\nchild “to benefit” from the educational experience.             It need not be\n\nthe best possible education nor one that will maximize the child’s\n\neducational potential.      Bd. of Education v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176\n\n(1982).\n\n     Admittedly different from those underlying the IDEA, the\n\nCongressional   objective    of   both    the   ADA   and   §    504   is   the\n\nelimination     of   discrimination        against      individuals         with\n\ndisabilities.   42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(1).        Title II of the ADA, which\n\napplies to public entities including public schools, provides that\n\n“no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such\n\ndisability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the\n\nbenefits of the services, programs or activities of a public entity\n\nor be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”              42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 12132.   See also 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(a).            Section 504 contains\n\n                                  -36-\n\fvirtually identical language.                       See 29 U.S.C. § 784(a).                   Mandating\n\nphysical          accessibility           and     the      removal        and     amelioration            of\n\narchitectural barriers is an important purpose of each statute.91\n\n        The primary difference between the ADA and § 504 is that § 504\n\napplies only to recipients of federal funds. 29 U.S.C. § 794(a).\n\nThis difference does not concern us in this case because no\n\ndefendant argues that it does not receive federal money.                                        Thus, as\n\nwe stated in section II-D above, for the purposes of this appeal,\n\nthe ADA          and    §   504    and     their       implementing           regulations          impose\n\nidentical obligations on the defendants and grant identical rights\n\nto Pace.92\n\n        In Pace’s brief to us on his non-IDEA claims brought under §\n\n504 and the ADA he complains only that parts of the Bogalusa High\n\nSchool campus are inaccessible to him.                            The only § 504 regulations\n\ndealing with accessibility in education are found in subpart C of\n\nthe § 504 regulations. 34 C.F.R. §§ 104.21-104.23.                                     Section 104.23\n\nof § 504's regulations deals with new construction on school\n\ncampuses, the basis of Pace’s complaints in this suit.                                         Subpart D\n\nof the § 504 regulations deals with preschool, elementary, and\n\n\n        91\n            See 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(5) (“The Congress finds that ...individuals with disabilities\ncontinually encounter various forms of discrimination, including...the discriminatory effects of\narchitectural...barriers,... failure to make modifications to existing facilities[,]...segregation, and\nrelegation to lesser services, programs, [and] activities...”); Id. § 12101(a)(4) (“The Congress finds\nthat...discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as education...”);\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 297 (1985) (noting that the “elimination of architectural barriers\nwas one of the central aims of the Rehabilitation Act”).\n        92\n             See note 78, supra.\n\n                                                   -37-\n\fsecondary education and those regulations do not purport to cover\n\naccessibility in schools.93 Rather, 34 C.F.R. § § 104.21-23, the\n\ngeneral education regulations on accessibility found in subpart C\n\nof § 504 apply to new construction on high school campuses such as\n\nBogalusa High.94           The ADA has no specific section on education, so\n\nthe general regulations governing accessibility to public buildings\n\nalso control accessibility to school buildings.\n\n        With this background, we turn to Pace’s specific argument that\n\nhis accessibility claims under the ADA/504 are not precluded by the\n\ndistrict court’s rejection of his accessibility claims under the\n\nIDEA.        He argues that his non-IDEA accessibility claims are not\n\nprecluded because different legal standards apply to his ADA and §\n\n504 accessibility claims, and these claims have never been litigated\n\nor    decided.          When      we    consider        the     equivalent         standards        for\n\naccessibility in schools under the IDEA on the one hand and the\n\nADA/504 on the other, it becomes clear that we should reject this\n\nargument.\n\n        Congress required in a 1997 amendment to the IDEA that any\n\n        93\n          Subpart D in the regulations to § 504 includes general regulations for preschool,\nelementary, and secondary education regarding placement (34 C.F.R. § 104.35), procedural\nrequirements (34 C.F.R. § 104.36) and the general FAPE requirement (34 C.F.R. § 104.33).\n        94\n          Although it is illogical to do so, one can read the § 504 regulations to say that a school need\nnot comply with accessibility requirements in Subpart C to provide a § 504 FAPE under 104.33 when\na student complains that part of a school’s campus is inaccessible. In such a situation, it is more\nsensible to read these regulations as requiring a school’s compliance with subpart C’s accessibility\nrequirements before it can be said to provide a § 504 FAPE. Regardless of whether the accessibility\nrequirement s must be met before a § 504 FAPE is provided, subpart C of the § 504 regulations\nclearly requires new construction in the school to meet the regulation’s accessibility requirements.\n\n                                                 -38-\n\fconstruction of new facilities must comply with either (1) The\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings\n\nand Facilities (ADAAG); or (2) The Uniform Federal Accessibility\n\nStandards (UFAS). 20 U.S.C. § 1404(b).95                             Thus, with respect to a\n\nphysically disabled child such as the wheelchair-bound Pace, the\n\nschool can comply with the IDEA’s accessibility requirements by\n\nsatisfying either the ADAAG or UFAS.96\n\n        Pace presents no argument that the accessibility standards for\n\nnew construction of school buildings under the ADA or § 504 are more\n\ndemanding or even different from the standards required under the\n\n1997 amendment to the IDEA. This is understandable, because the\n\nregulations governing accessibility in schools under the ADA/504\n\nrequire a school engaged in new construction to conform to the same\n\nstandards as the IDEA, either the ADAAG or UFAS.\n\n        New construction and alterations of public facilities under\n\n\n\n        95\n             20 U.S.C. § 1404(b) provides in pertinent part:\n\n                  ...Any construction of new facilities or alteration of existing facilities under\n                  subsection (a) of this section shall comply with the requirements of–\n\n                         (1) appendix A of part 36 of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations\n                         (commonly known as the “Americans with Disabilities Accessibility\n                         Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities”); or\n\n                         (2) appendix A of part 101-19.6 of title 41, Code of Federal\n                         Regulations (commonly known as the “Uniform Federal Accessibility\n                         Standards”).\n        96\n             The corresponding regulation to 20 U.S.C. § 1404 is found at 34 C.F.R. § 300.756 and is\nidentical.\n\n                                                  -39-\n\fTitle II of the ADA are governed by the regulations found in 28\n\nC.F.R. § 35.151.97          Like the IDEA, the ADA accessibility regulations\n\nrequire a school conducting new construction to comply with either\n\nthe ADAAG or UFAS.               Section 504's accessibility regulations are\n\nvirtually identical to the ADA’s,98 and also demand that schools\n\nengaging in new construction comply with the same federal guidelines\n\nrequired by the IDEA.             Thus, Pace’s argument that the accessibility\n\nstandards are different under IDEA and ADA/504 is meritless.\n\n       In summary, under the IDEA, when, as here, a child complains\n\nthat his disability renders a portion of the campus inaccessible,\n\nthis triggers the application of the 1997 amendments to the IDEA.\n\nIn determining whether the school has met its obligations under the\n\namendment and provided the disabled student with a FAPE, the hearing\n\nexaminer, the SLRP, and the district court must determine whether\n\nthe area of the school in question complies with either the ADAAG\n\nor UFAS. These are the same federal guidelines the school must\n\ncomply with to satisfy the accessibility requirements of the ADA and\n\n§ 504.\n\n       97\n         38 C.F.R. 35.151(c) provides in pertinent part:\n               (c) Accessibility standards. Design, construction, or alteration of facilities in\n       conformance with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS)...or with the\n       Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities\n       (ADAAG)...shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of this section with\n       respect to those facilities...\n       98\n         One minor difference between the accessibility regulations under § 504 and the ADA is that,\nbecause § 504 preceded the ADA and the ADA-specific accessibility regulations (ADAAG), § 504\ndoes not give schools the option of complying with either the ADAAG or UFAS (as do both the\nADA and IDEA), but requires compliance with the UFAS.\n\n                                                -40-\n\f       Pace, as he was required to do by the IDEA, presented his\n\naccessibility          claims       in    his     administrative             claim.          In       their\n\nadministrative findings, both the hearing examiner and the SLRP\n\ndiscussed the 1997 amendment to the IDEA. This makes it clear that\n\nboth were aware that new or existing construction to Bogalusa High\n\nSchool must meet either the ADAAG or UFAS standards before the\n\nschool could fully comply with the IDEA.99\n\n       The only significant summary judgment evidence Pace presented\n\nto the district court on his ADA/504 claims was the report and\n\ndeposition testimony of Donald MaGinnis, an architectural expert.\n\nThe point of his testimony is that structural changes to the\n\nBogalusa campus failed to comply with the ADAAG. Although this same\n\nstandard applied to Pace’s claim under the IDEA, he did not\n\nintroduce this evidence before the hearing examiner. Further, Pace\n\nfailed to offer the expert evidence to the district court to support\n\nhis appeal of the administrative determination under the IDEA.\n\nBecause the accessibility standards under the IDEA and the ADA/504\n\nare identical for new construction of school buildings, Pace has not\n\ndemonstrated that the defendants owed him any greater or even\n\n       99\n        Page five of the State Level Review Panel’s opinion, under the heading “Applicable Law\nand Regulations,” provides:\n\n               Section 605 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments\n       of 1997, states that any construction of new facilities or alteration of existing facilities\n       with use of program funds shall comply with the requirements of Americans with\n       Disabilities Accessibility Guidelines (Appendix A of Part 36 of Title 28, Code of\n       Federal Regulations) or Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (Appendix A of Part\n       101-19.6 of Title 41, Code of Federal Regulations). (R. 63).\n\n                                                 -41-\n\fdifferent obligation in this respect under § 504/ADA than he was\n\nentitled to under the IDEA.      Thus, the accessibility issue Pace\n\nlitigated in his IDEA case and lost is the same issue he sought to\n\nlitigate in his ADA/504 claim.          The district court correctly\n\nconcluded that Pace was precluded from relitigating this issue.\n\n       The only argument Pace presents to us on the applicability of\n\nthe 1997 amendment was presented for the first time in his petition\n\nfor en banc review.    He argued in that petition and argues to the\n\nen banc court that the amendment was not triggered because no\n\nevidence was presented that “IDEA funds” were used to make the\n\nimprovements to the Bogalusa campus.     Pace relies on the following\n\nlanguage in the 1997 amendment to 20 U.S.C. § 1404:\n\n       § 1404.    Acquisition of   equipment;   construction   or\n       alteration of facilities\n            (a) In general\n\n            If the Secretary determines that a program\n            authorized under this chapter would be improved\n            by permitting program funds to be used to\n            acquire appropriate equipment, or to construct\n            new facilities or alter existing facilities,\n            the Secretary is authorized to allow the use of\n            those funds for those purposes.\n\n       Neither the amendment nor the existing statute purports to\n\nrequire a plaintiff to prove the use of IDEA funds or any other fact\n\nas a predicate to seeking relief under the IDEA against a school for\n\nfailing to make its campus accessible in response to a student’s\n\nIEP.    We have found no cases interpreting this amendment or its\n\npredecessor.    Subsection (a) is simply a restyled version of the\n\n\n\n                                 -42-\n\fexisting statute.100         The change is found in Subsection (b), which\n\nincorporates into the IDEA for the first time the ADAAG and UFAS\n\nconstruction standards.            The amended § 1404(a), like the existing\n\nstatute, authorizes the Secretary to allow the use of IDEA funds for\n\nconstruction or alterations.\n\n     To support Pace’s argument that the amended version of § 1404\n\ndoes not apply in this case, amicus seems to argue that structural\n\nalterations to meet accessibility demands in a student’s IEP are not\n\npart of the calculus in determining whether a student has received\n\na FAPE.\n\n     In Weber’s Special Education Law and Litigation Treatise, he\n\nrejects this suggestion in his cogent discussion of the interplay\n\nbetween the IDEA, § 504 and ADA:\n\n     Schools covered by Title II and Section 504 owe\n     obligations not only to students with disabilities but to\n     all persons with disabilities whom they serve. In this\n     sense, the laws are more inclusive than the Individuals\n     with   Disabilities    Education   Act   (IDEA),    whose\n     beneficiaries are children with disabilities who need\n     special education.    Nevertheless, by requiring school\n     districts to provide an appropriate education in the\n     least restrictive environment, IDEA overlaps with Section\n     504 and Title II in terms of the children it covers.\n     Thus, IDEA may require a school district to modify\n     programs or facilities to achieve these ends for an\n\n\n     100\n        The pre-amended version of 20 U.S.C. 1404(a) provided as follows:\n     (a) Authorization for use of funds\n\n            In the case of any program authorized by this chapter, if the Secretary\n            determines that such program will be improved by permitting the\n            funds authorized for such program to be used for the acquisition of\n            equipment and the construction of necessary facilities, the Secretary\n            may authorize the use of such funds for such purposes. (West 1996).\n\n                                            -43-\n\f       individual student. IDEA funds may be used for removal\n       of architectural barriers or other improvements to\n       accessibility in order to promote appropriate education\n       for children with disabilities.(Footnotes omitted)101\n       (emphasis added)\n\n       Weber further describes a school’s duty under the IDEA to\n\naddress accessibility concerns in the IEP as “a component of\n\nappropriate special education and related services in the least\n\nrestrictive environment.”102               This discussion makes it clear that\n\nwhen a student’s IEP raises concerns of accessibility to the\n\nschool’s campus, the determination of whether these concerns have\n\nbeen met is a necessary component in resolving whether the student\n\nhas received a FAPE.\n\n       The Hearing Examiner tried this controversy on the premise that\n\nthe entire IDEA statute, including the 1997 amendment, applied to\n\nPace’s claims, and no one argued to the contrary.                              The Hearing\n\nExaminer did not require the parties to file extensive pre-trial\n\npapers. However, she did require each party to list the issues they\n\nwanted the hearing examiner to address. Neither Pace nor the school\n\nboard asserted that an issue was presented with respect to the\n\nexpenditure of IDEA funds or any other issue relating to the\n\napplicability of the 1997 amendment to § 1404.                           Considering the\n\nstrict duty that the ADAAG and UFAS construction guidelines impose\n\n\n\n       101\n             MARK C. WEBER, SPECIAL EDUCATION LAW AND LITIGATION TREATISE 7.1 (2D ED. 2002).\n       102\n         Weber, note 3 at 7.2. (Footnotes omitted). Weber concludes that “modifications [to the\ncampus] may include wheelchair ramps, handrails, accessible toilets, and water fountains.”\n\n                                             -44-\n\fon the school, it was also reasonable for the Hearing Examiner to\n\nassume that the school board would object if there was some basis\n\nfor it        to   argue    that     these     guidelines        did    not     apply     to    the\n\narchitectural improvements ordered by Pace’s IEP.                                    It is not\n\nsurprising that Pace did not object to the Hearing Examiner’s\n\napplication of such rigorous standards; it was in his interest at\n\nthe time to require the school to meet the toughest standards\n\npossible in making the architectural improvements.\n\n       After three hearings, the Hearing Examiner issued her report\n\nfinding that Bogalusa High had provided Pace with a FAPE.                                       The\n\nHearing Examiner explicitly found that the ADAAG guidelines applied,\n\nmeaning that she concluded that Pace’s accessibility concerns\n\nregarding improvements made to the campus triggered the application\n\nof the 1997 amendment to § 1404 of the IDEA.                          Otherwise, the ADAAG\n\nguidelines would be irrelevant. In making her findings, the Hearing\n\nExaminer relied on the voluminous administrative record, which shows\n\nthat Bogalusa received substantial federal IDEA funds during 1996\n\nand 1997, the relevant time period.103                        IDEA regulations make it\n\nclear that federal IDEA funds cannot be co-mingled with state\n\nfunds.104        The Hearing examiner also had the benefit of Pace’s IEP\n\nand the testimony of the School Board’s Maintenance Supervisor that\n\n\n       103\n           For the 1996-97 fiscal year, the record shows that Bogalusa was the recipient of $164,213\nin federal funds for its “Special Education” program.\n       104\n             34 CFR § 300.152.\n\n\n                                              -45-\n\fthe construction changes were made in response to Pace’s IEP\n\nfacilitator’s instructions.           Even if a showing of the use of IDEA\n\nfunds was required,           it was reasonable for the Hearing Examiner to\n\nconclude that IDEA funds were used and that under the amended\n\nversion of 20 U.S.C. § 1404 the school provided Pace with a FAPE.\n\n      Pace appealed the Hearing Examiner’s order to the State Level\n\nReview Panel (SLRP).           Again, the record reflects no argument from\n\nany party to that appeal that the entire IDEA statute, including the\n\n1997 amendment to § 1404, did not apply.             The SLRP in its opinion\n\nexplicitly applied the 1997 amendment, discussed Pace’s arguments,\n\nand after rejecting them, affirmed the Hearing Examiner.\n\n      Pace then filed suit in federal district court seeking relief\n\nunder the IDEA, §504 and the ADA.              He specifically alleged in his\n\npetition that the state received federal IDEA funds.105             His core\n\nclaim was that the school had failed to comply with the ADAAG.\n\n      The primary evidence Pace presented to the district court was\n\nthe deposition testimony and report of architect Donald MaGinnis,\n\nwho testified that the structural changes to the campus failed to\n\nmeet ADAAG standards. Thus, Pace’s federal claim was predicated on\n\nthese guidelines, made applicable to the IDEA by the 1997 amendment\n\nto   § 1404.          Because the Hearing Examiner and the SLRP had rejected\n\nPace’s accessibility claims based on application of these same\n\nstandards (the ADAAG and UFAS), the district court concluded that\n\n\n      105\n            R. 192.\n\n                                        -46-\n\fPace was precluded from relitigating his accessibility issues.\n\n     Suffering summary judgment in the district court on both his\n\nIDEA and non-IDEA claims, Pace sought appellate relief from this\n\ncourt.       In his initial brief to the panel, Pace argued that the\n\ndistrict court erred in accepting the Hearing Examiner and SLRP’s\n\nfindings of accessibility to preclude his non-IDEA accessibility\n\nclaims.          However,      Pace     did    not     base     his   argument   on   the\n\ninapplicability of the 1997 amendment to § 1404 or that the Hearing\n\nExaminer erred in applying the ADAAG guidelines to the structural\n\nchanges. The School Board did argue to the panel that the amendment\n\napplied and that the Hearing Examiner and SLRP had used the very\n\nsame federal guidelines in deciding Pace’s IDEA claims that Pace\n\nsought to litigate in his non-IDEA action.106\n\n     Faced with the appellee’s argument that his non-IDEA claims\n\nwere precluded due to the previous application of the 1997 amended\n\nversion of § 1404, Pace filed a reply brief with the panel.                       Again,\n\nhe made no effort to refute the School Board’s argument that the\n\n1997 amendment to § 1404 applied.\n\n     Without any opposition from Pace as to the proper application\n\nof § 1404 to the improvements to Bogalusa High’s campus, the panel\n\naccepted the School Board’s unchallenged argument and relied on the\n\n\n\n\n     106\n           Appellee Bogalusa City School Board’s Brief at 32.\n\n\n                                              -47-\n\f1997 amendment to affirm the district court’s judgment.107 The panel\n\nspecifically cited the 1997 amended version of § 1404 to support its\n\nconclusion that issue preclusion was proper because accessibility\n\nto the campus had already been litigated under the same federal\n\nstandards.108\n\n     In response to the panel’s decision, Pace sought en banc\n\nreview, where he argued for the first time that § 1404 did not apply\n\nto the improvements he demanded in his IEP, because “[t]here is no\n\nproof that construction in this case would be covered by this\n\nprovision.”109\n\n     In sum, we do not read the 1997 amendment to require proof that\n\nIDEA funds were used for improvements to trigger the amendment.\n\nEven if the statute can be read in this manner, there is evidence\n\nto support an inference that IDEA funds were used to make the\n\nstructural changes.              More importantly, we cannot permit Pace to\n\nchange his position at will. He was obviously happy to have the\n\nadministrative bodies and the trial court apply the 1997 amendment\n\nto § 1404 (and the strict ADAAG guidelines) when it was helpful to\n\nhim. He cannot at this late date reverse his position when he finds\n\nthat application of those guidelines are not in his best interest.\n\n\n\n     107\n           Pace v.

He argues that the IDEA’s “savings clause,” gives him the\n\nright to maintain a cause of action under the ADA and § 504.110                                 We\n\nagree that Pace is not limited to a claim under the IDEA and that\n\nhe can assert claims under the ADA and § 504.                           But his ability to\n\nassert non-IDEA claims does not mean that general principles of\n\nissue preclusion do not apply to preclude his redundant claims.111\n\nBecause Pace’s claims under the ADA and § 504 are factually and\n\nlegally indistinct from his IDEA claims, issue preclusion is proper\n\nin this case.\n\n       Because Pace is precluded from litigating the question of\n\nwhether the defendants have any obligation under the ADA and § 504\n\nto make further architectural or structural changes in the buildings\n\non the Bogalusa campus, his claim for an injunction ordering such\n\nchanges must also fail.\n\n\n       110\n          The IDEA’s “savings clause” is found in 20 U.S.C 1415(l), and provides in pertinent part:\n               Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict or limit the rights,\n       procedures, and remedies under...the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990...title\n       V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973...or other Federal laws protecting the rights of\n       children with disabilities...\n       111\n           See, e.g., Burlovich v.

Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521\n\nU.S. 261, 267-68, 117 S. Ct. 2028, 2033 (1997) (referring to Hans\n\nv. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1, 10 S. Ct. 504 (1890)).\n\n          There are two carefully construed exceptions whereby\n\nStates may become subject to suits by private citizens.      Congress\n\nmay abrogate state sovereign immunity pursuant to § 5 of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment, or the State may waive its sovereign immunity\n\nand give its consent to suit.   See Coll. Sav. Bank v. Fla. Prepaid\n\nPostsecondary Educ. Expense Bd., 527 U.S. 666, 670, 119 S. Ct. 2219,\n\n2223 (1999)). However, “[b]ecause abrogation of sovereign immunity\n\nupsets the fundamental constitutional balance between the Federal\n\nGovernment and the States, . . . and because States are unable\n\ndirectly to remedy a judicial misapprehension of that abrogation,\n\nthe Court has adopted a particularly strict standard to evaluate\n\nclaims that Congress has abrogated the States’ sovereign immunity.”\n\nPort Auth. Trans-Hudson Corp. v. Feeney, 495 U.S. 299, 305, 110 S.\n\nCt. 1868, 1872 (1990) (citations and quotations omitted).    “Similar\n\nsolicitude for States’ sovereign immunity underlies the standard\n\nthat this Court employs to determine whether a State has waived that\n\nimmunity.”   Id.\n\n          Travis Pace advances both abrogation and waiver theories\n\nin support of his claims against Louisiana.    The majority agrees\n\n                                -52-\n\fwith   Pace    that      Louisiana        waived      its   sovereign       immunity      as   a\n\ncondition      of       accepting    federal          funds   under     §     504    of    the\n\nRehabilitation Act and IDEA. In so doing, the majority has forsaken\n\nthe “particularly strict standard” the Eleventh Amendment demands,\n\nignored the Supreme Court’s settled test for evaluating a waiver of\n\nconstitutional          rights,     and    inexplicably       discounted       the     unique\n\nfactual context from which this case arose.\n\n                                          I.    WAIVER\n\n              As    a    fundamental       constitutional        component,         “[s]tate\n\nsovereign immunity, no less than the right to trial by jury in\n\ncriminal cases, is constitutionally protected.”                         Coll. Sav. Bank,\n\n527 U.S. at 682, 119 S. Ct. at 2229.                          The same test used in\n\nevaluating waiver of other fundamental constitutional rights must\n\nbe employed in the Eleventh Amendment context as well. As the Court\n\nheld, there is no justification for creating a separate and distinct\n\ntest for Eleventh Amendment waiver purposes.                     Thus, “[t]he classic\n\ndescription of an effective waiver of a constitutional right is the\n\nintentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or\n\nprivilege.” Id. (citations and quotations omitted) (emphasis added).\n\nAccording to the sole applicable test, therefore, “waiver must have\n\nbeen made with a full awareness of both the nature of the right\n\nbeing abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.”\n\nMoran v. Burbine, 475 U.S. 412, 421, 106 S. Ct. 1135, 1141 (1986)\n\n(emphasis added).            Moreover, “courts indulge every reasonable\n\npresumption against waiver of fundamental constitutional rights and\n\n                                               -53-\n\f. . . do not presume acquiescence in the loss of fundamental\n\nrights.” Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 1023\n\n(1938). This circuit, at least until today, adhered to this uniform\n\napproach.    “Waivers of constitutional rights not only must be\n\nvoluntary but must be knowing, intelligent acts done with sufficient\n\nawareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences[.]”\n\nUnited States v. Newell, 315 F.3d 510, 519 (5th Cir. 2002)(quoting\n\nBrady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 748, 90 S. Ct. 1463 (1970))\n\n(emphasis added).   A valid waiver requires “actual knowledge of the\n\nexistence of the right or privilege, full understanding of its\n\nmeaning, and clear comprehension of the consequences of the waiver.”\n\nId. (quoting Hatfield v. Scott, 306 F.3d 223, 230 (5th Cir. 2002))\n\n(emphasis in original).\n\n            The test for a State’s waiver of Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity is no different because Congress sought to effect waiver\n\nunder the Spending Clause.      The Supreme Court “has repeatedly\n\ncharacterized . . . Spending Clause legislation as ‘much in the\n\nnature of a contract: in return for federal funds, the [recipients]\n\nagree to comply with federally imposed conditions.’”      Barnes v.\n\nGorman, 536 U.S. 181, 186 (2002) (quoting Pennhurst State Sch. &\n\nHosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981)).       “Just as a valid\n\ncontract requires offer and acceptance of its terms, the legitimacy\n\nof Congress’ power to legislate under the spending power . . . rests\n\non whether the [recipient] voluntarily and knowingly accepts the\n\nterms of the contract.”    Barnes, 536 U.S. at 186 (citations and\n\n                                -54-\n\fquotations omitted) (emphasis added); see also Pennhurst, 465 U.S.\n\nat 99, 104 S. Ct. at 907 (the State’s consent to suit must be\n\n“unequivocally expressed”).            As a result, the “test for determining\n\nwhether      a    State    has     waived    its   immunity   from      federal-court\n\njurisdiction is a stringent one.”                    Atascadero State Hosp. v.\n\nScanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 241, 105 S. Ct. 3142, 3146 (1985).\n\n                 Despite this clear authority, the majority has crafted a\n\nnovel waiver test for Spending Clause cases.                      Relying on South\n\nDakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 107 S. Ct. 2793 (1987), the majority\n\ndraws two conclusions: (1) a State’s waiver is knowing so long as\n\nCongress satisfies the “clear statement rule,” and (2) the State’s\n\nwaiver is voluntary so long as it is “non-coercive.”                      Although I\n\nagree      with    the    latter    conclusion,    the   former    is    incorrect.113\n\n\n\n     113\n          Dole’s “non-coercive” requirement is a satisfactory proxy\nfor the “voluntariness” prong of the waiver inquiry. Thus, under\nthe   current   state   of   the   law,  §   2000d-7(a)    is   not\nunconstitutionally coercive. As a result, the State of Louisiana\nacted voluntarily for purposes of the constitutional waiver test.\nBut, with due regard for precedent, I am compelled to raise the\nfollowing question: “If not now, and on this showing, when, and on\nwhat showing” will federal grants be deemed unconstitutionally\ncoercive? Cf. Spangler v. Pasadena City Bd. of Ed., 611 F.2d 1239,\n1240 (9th Cir. 1979).     The Rehabilitation Act, pursuant to 29\nU.S.C. § 794(a), requires non-consenting States to forfeit all\nfederal funds.     For the Louisiana Department of Education,\nrenouncing all federal funds would cut its budget by $804,269,621,\nor 75%. Dole counseled that “in some circumstances the financial\ninducement offered by Congress might be so coercive as to pass the\npoint at which pressure turns into compulsion.” 483 U.S. at 211\n(emphasis added). To date, the Supreme Court has not found a case\nthat warranted vindication of this principle.         Nevertheless,\nLouisiana and its children would suffer extreme consequences here\nif the State were to lose massive federal assistance by asserting\nits constitutional right to sovereign immunity.\n\n                                            -55-\n\fCollege Savings Bank controls the Eleventh Amendment waiver inquiry\n\nand demands more than a congressional “clear statement” — it also\n\nrequires the State to make a “clear declaration” of its intent to\n\nwaive its immunity.           In College Savings Bank, the Supreme Court\n\nrecognized that for a State “knowingly” to waive its sovereign\n\nimmunity, not only must Congress make clear its intention to so\n\ncondition       federal      funds,    but     the    State   must    expressly      and\n\nunequivocally        waive    its     immunity.        “There   is    a    fundamental\n\ndifference between a State’s expressing unequivocally that it waives\n\nits immunity and Congress’s expressing unequivocally its intention\n\nthat if the State takes certain action it shall be deemed to have\n\nthat immunity.”       Coll. Sav. Bank, 527 U.S. at 680-81, 119 S. Ct. at\n\n2228.    “In the latter situation, the most that can be said with\n\ncertainty is that the State has been put on notice that Congress\n\nintends to subject it to suits brought by individuals.”                      Id.\n\n               Despite the majority’s assertion to the contrary, College\n\nSavings Bank confirms that Dole’s “clear statement” requirement is\n\nonly half of the waiver equation.                   See Garcia v. S.U.N.Y. Health\n\nSci.    Ctr.    of   Brooklyn,        280    F.3d    98,   113-14    (2d   Cir.    2001)\n\n(concluding that “a clear expression of Congress’s intent . . .\n\nalone is not sufficient . . . to find that [the State] actually\n\nwaived its sovereign immunity by accepting federal funds”).                         “The\n\nwhole point of requiring a ‘clear declaration’ by the State of its\n\nwaiver is to be certain that the State in fact consents to suit.”\n\nColl. Sav. Bank, 527 U.S. at 680, 119 S. Ct. at 2228 (emphasis in\n\n                                            -56-\n\foriginal).        “Whether Congress clearly required that a State waive\n\nits immunity before accepting federal funds (the first inquiry) is\n\nnot the same thing, however, as whether the State clearly declared\n\nits knowing waiver (the second inquiry).”                       Douglas v. Cal. Dep’t of\n\nYouth Auth., 285 F.3d 1226, 1228 (O’Scannlain, J., dissenting from\n\ndenial of petition for rehearing en banc)(emphasis in original).\n\n“The mere receipt of federal funds cannot establish that a State has\n\nconsented to suit in federal court.”                      Atascadero, 473 U.S. at 246-\n\n47.114\n\n               For a State to evince its “clear declaration” of intent\n\nto waive sovereign immunity, it must possess “actual knowledge of\n\nthe existence of the right or privilege, full understanding of its\n\nmeaning, and clear comprehension of the consequences of the waiver.”\n\nNewell, 315 F.3d at 519 (citations and quotations omitted) (emphasis\n\nin original).          In all but the rarest of circumstances, acceptance\n\nof federal funds offered in accordance with the “clear statement\n\nrule” will meet this test. This case represents an exception to the\n\ngeneral rule.\n\n               The majority ignores the fact that until the mid-1990's,\n\nit was assumed that Congress could abrogate state sovereign immunity\n\nin legislation enacted pursuant to its Article I enumerated powers.\n\nThe Supreme Court held otherwise in Seminole Tribe v. Florida, 517\n\n         114\n                Furthermore, the majority’s reliance on the precedents of other circuits is\nunpersuasive. Those circuits, like our court today, focused exclusively on whether Congress clearly\nexpressed its intention to condition acceptance of federal funds on waiver of immunity — not whether\nthe State reasonably believed it was waiving immunity by accepting federal funds.\n\n                                              -57-\n\fU.S. 44, 72-73, 116 S. Ct. 1114 (1996), while reaffirming that\n\nabrogation remained permissible through a proper exercise of power\n\nunder § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.                       Id. at 59, 116 S. Ct. 1114.\n\nIn the statutes here at issue — ADA, § 504 and IDEA — abrogation was\n\nenacted under the Commerce Clause.                           Since, however, all three\n\nstatutes enhance the rights of the disabled, and all three express\n\na   clear     congressional          intent      to    abridge       the    States’       Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity, federal courts routinely permitted suits by\n\nprivate individuals to proceed against the States. As late as 1998,\n\nwhile applying the Supreme Court’s narrow construction of the § 5\n\nabrogation authority,115 this court still held that the ADA validly\n\nabrogated state sovereign immunity.                        Coolbaugh v. Louisiana, 136\n\nF.3d 430 (5th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 819, 119 S. Ct. 58\n\n(1998) overruled by Reickenbacker v. Flores, 274 F.3d 974 (5th Cir.\n\n2001).116\n\n               Surely Louisiana should not be penalized for construing\n\nthe ADA — and counterpart abrogation language in § 504 and IDEA —\n\njust as this court subsequently did in Coolbaugh.                                  Instead, the\n\nState acted quite rationally in assuming between 1996 and 1998 that\n\n\n       115\n               See City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 117 S. Ct. 2157 (1997).\n       116\n                 Reickenbacker’s holding flows from the Supreme Court’s decision in Bd. of Trustees\nof the Univ. of Alabama v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 368, 121 S. Ct. 955, 964 (2001), which held that\nTitle I of the ADA did not validly abrogat e state sovereign immunity pursuant to § 5 of the\nFourteenth Amendment. Because Title II of the ADA and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act offer\nvirtually identical protections, the abrogat ion analysis with regard to the two statutes is the same.\nReickenbacker, 274 F.3d at 977 n. 17; see also Garcia, 280 F.3d at 114; Hoekstra v. Indep. Sch.\nDist., 103 F.3d 624, 626 (8th Cir. 1996).\n\n                                               -58-\n\fit had no sovereign immunity to waive when it accepted federal\n\neducation funds under conditions specified by § 504 and IDEA.    The\n\nState voluntarily accepted federal funds, but its acceptance was not\n\na “knowing” waiver of immunity. As the Second Circuit put it, since\n\n“the proscriptions of Title II [of the ADA] and § 504 are virtually\n\nidentical, a State accepting federal funds could not have understood\n\nthat in doing so it was actually abandoning its sovereign immunity\n\nfrom private damage suits, since by all reasonable appearances state\n\nsovereign immunity had already been lost.”    Garcia, 280 F.3d at 114\n\n(citations omitted).117\n\n           The majority offers two principal arguments against this\n\nresult.    First, the majority conflates abrogation and waiver when\n\npositing that “Louisiana did have Eleventh Amendment immunity to\n\nwaive by accepting the clearly conditioned federal funds.”       See\n\nMajority Op. at 21        (emphasis in original).   On the contrary,\n\nCoolbaugh confirmed, until Garrett and Reickenbacker overruled it,\n\nthat Congress had validly exercised its abrogation authority,\n\nrendering Louisiana amenable to suit notwithstanding the Eleventh\n\nAmendment.    The majority’s suggestion that Congress can abrogate\n\nsovereign immunity, but still permit the States to retain their\n\n\n     117\n          Conversely, after Garrett was decided, the State\ndefendants could knowingly waive their immunity because they could\nhave reasonably anticipated the ability to preserve sovereign\nimmunity by declining federal funds under the Rehabilitation Act\nand the IDEA.   See Bd. of Trustees of the Univ. of Alabama v.\nGarrett, 531 U.S. 356, 121 S. Ct. 955 (2001) (invalidating an\nabrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity pursuant to Title I of\nADA).\n\n                                  -59-\n\fEleventh        Amendment          immunity,         misapprehends            the     import        of\n\nabrogation.118\n\n               Still, Congress may, in its discretion, choose to trigger\n\nenforcement of any federal statute, even after it has abrogated\n\nsovereign immunity, on the receipt of federal funds.                                In response,\n\na State, by refusing federal funds, may reject the terms of the\n\n“contract” and potentially avoid statutory liability to private\n\nindividuals.           But whether it can avoid liability based upon a\n\ncontractual/waiver theory is a different question from whether it\n\nretained Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity post-abrogation.119\n\nThus, the relevant Eleventh Amendment inquiry remains whether\n\nLouisiana reasonably believed, based on objective evidence, that the\n\nRehabilitation Act and the IDEA validly abrogated its sovereign\n\nimmunity — not whether it could have chosen to reject the federal\n\nfunds anyway.\n\n               Second, the majority contends that requiring the State to\n\n\n       118\n                 The unmistakable difference between abrogation and waiver is complicated by\nstatutes, like § 2000d-7(a), that attempt to achieve both in the same provision. Nevertheless, the\ncircuit courts and the panel opinion here agree that statutory language may, in fact, constitute both\nan attempted abrogation and conditional waiver provision. See, e.g., Stanley v. Litscher, 213 F.3d\n340, 344 (7th Cir. 2000); Robinson v. Kansas, 295 F.3d 1183, 1189-90 (10th Cir. 2002). However,\na statute’s capacity to serve dual purpo ses does not justify the majority’s confusion of the two\nconcepts.\n       119\n              The majority implies that Louisiana’s self-interested acceptance of funds should\nprevent the State from arguing that it might have chosen to forego the funds for the sake of\nmaintaining sovereign immunity. Louisiana’s mistaken (though eminently reasonable) belief that\nabrogation had occurred distorted this calculation, however. That the State does have immunity to\nwaive now throws into high relief the potential coercion inherent in the federal government’s funding\ncondition. The “cost” of Louisiana’s resting on its constitutional right is over $800 million annually!\n\n                                                -60-\n\fmake a “clear declaration” problematically “engraft[s] a subjective-\n\nintent element onto an otherwise objective Spending Clause waiver\n\ninquiry.”        See Majority Op. at 22.                  Unfortunately, the majority\n\nmisunderstands the nature of the “clear declaration” requirement,\n\na requirement consonant with the Supreme Court’s longstanding\n\nobjective approach to waiver.                  The Supreme Court uniformly applies\n\na “totality of the circumstances” test to waiver questions involving\n\nfundamental constitutional rights.                      Fare v. Michael C., 442 U.S.\n\n707, 725, 99 S. Ct. 2560, 2572 (1979). “Only if the totality of the\n\ncircumstances . . . reveal both an uncoerced choice and the\n\nrequisite level of comprehension may a court properly conclude that\n\nthe . . . rights have been waived.”                     See Burbine, 475 U.S. at 421,\n\n106 S. Ct. at 1135.             Hence, the Supreme Court considers a variety\n\nof objective factors, not subjective intent, to determine whether\n\na constitutional right has validly been waived.                           Fare, 442 U.S. at\n\n725, 99 S. Ct. at 2572; see also United States v. Sonderup, 639 F.2d\n\n294, 298 (5th Cir. 1981) (relying on the objective indicia to\n\ndetermine whether a voluntary, knowing and intelligent waiver was\n\nmade).       College Savings Bank’s “clear declaration” requirement\n\nreiterates the Supreme Court’s waiver test in the Eleventh Amendment\n\ncontext, and so would I.120\n\n\n       120\n                The majority’s approach unquestionably achieves a bright-line rule that the Supreme\nCourt’s traditional waiver inquiry cannot. However, this approach is impermissible in the context of\nwaiver of fundamental constitutional rights.\n\n       An express written statement of waiver of the right to remain silent or the right to\n\n                                              -61-\n\f              Given this court’s ruling in Coolbaugh that the State had\n\nno immunity to waive, followed by an unsuccessful en banc poll and\n\nthe Supreme Court’s denial of certiorari in that case, it is\n\ninconceivable that Louisiana somehow, based on the “straightforward\n\nobjective facts,” knowingly chose to waive a right that was non-\n\nexistent when it acted. In a sense, the State of Louisiana is being\n\nforced, by today’s majority, to bear the burden of this court’s\n\nmistake of law in Coolbaugh.                    Consider this analogy:                 the police\n\ninstruct a criminal defendant, “for his own good,” to sign a waiver\n\nof counsel form, while telling him that the waiver is “meaningless,\n\nbecause you have no counsel rights to waive.”                           Who would argue that\n\nthe waiver is knowing, especially if the police showed him a court\n\ndecision confirming this view?                      That the dupe is an individual\n\ndefendant rather than the State does not, per College Savings, make\n\nthis a different case, nor does the fact that the waiver falls under\n\nthe Spending Clause rather than some other type of enactment.                                     The\n\nmajority’s opinion violates College Savings Bank.\n\n              In this rare instance, Louisiana could not have knowingly\n\nwaived its sovereign immunity in the relevant time period before the\n\nGarrett decision. The majority’s approach strangely counsels States\n\n\n\n\n       counsel is usually strong proof of the validity of that waiver, but it is not inevitably\n       either necessary or sufficient to establish waiver. The question is not one of form, but\n       rather whether the defendant in fact knowingly and voluntarily waived the rights\n       delineated in the Miranda case.\n\nNorth Carolina v. Butler, 441 U.S. 369, 374, 99 S. Ct. 1755, 1758 (1979).\n\n                                               -62-\n\fto disregard governing caselaw when Supreme Court doctrine is\n\nevolving.     Such an argument makes no more sense in this unusual\n\ncontext than it would in any other.\n\n                                 II.    ABROGATION\n\n            Pace       alternatively     argues,      and    this       dissent    must\n\ndetermine, whether Congress abrogated Louisiana’s sovereign immunity\n\nwith respect to claims brought under Title II,               § 504, and the IDEA.\n\nPace would extend the Court’s recent decision in Tennessee v. Lane,\n\n541 U.S. 509, 124 S. Ct. 1978 (2004), which held that Title II of\n\nthe ADA validly abrogates State sovereign immunity insofar as it\n\nimplicates     the      physical       accessibility        of    the     fundamental\n\nconstitutional right of access to the courts.                    The majority here,\n\nhaving   found     a    waiver   of    the   State’s    immunity,        declares    it\n\nunnecessary to opine on abrogation.            The majority goes on, however,\n\nto observe that, in Lane, the Supreme Court “refused to consider\n\n[whether     Title     II   abrogates]       other   rights,       including      those\n\nconsidered to be fundamental under the Constitution.”                    See Majority\n\nOp. at 28, citing 124 S. Ct. at 1993.                The majority also comments\n\nthat the Court “has never before recognized access to public\n\neducation or freedom from disability discrimination in education as\n\nfundamental rights.”        Id., citing Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 221,\n\n223, 102 S. Ct. 2382, 2396-98 (1982); City of Cleburne v. Cleburne\n\nLiving Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 446, 105 S. Ct. 3249, 3257 (1985).\n\n            I agree with the majority’s dicta that suggests Lane is\n\ncurrently of limited application.                Moreover, because Lane was\n\n                                        -63-\n\fwritten very narrowly, I conclude that this court’s decision in\n\nReickenbacker remains valid in holding that ADA Title II, apart from\n\nthe Lane scenario, does not validly abrogate States’ Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity.    See Reickenbacker, 274 F.3d at 983.         The fate\n\nof § 504 abrogation was also sealed in Reickenbacker based on the\n\ncourt’s conclusion that Title II and § 504 impose “virtually\n\nidentical” obligations.    Id.     For the reasons stated in Reicken-\n\nbacker and in the panel opinion, I would hold that Congress could\n\nnot constitutionally abrogate state sovereign immunity in § 504 or\n\nthe similarly structured IDEA statute pursuant to § 5 of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment.     The remedies imposed by those laws “far\n\nexceed [ ] [those] imposed by the Constitution, and [I] cannot\n\nconclude that they are congruent and proportional to the legislative\n\nfindings of unconstitutional discrimination against the disabled by\n\nthe states.”   Reickenbacker, 274 F.3d at 983.\n\n                           III.    CONCLUSION\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, I conclude that during a narrow\n\nperiod of time, based on uncertainty in the Supreme Court’s evolving\n\nEleventh   Amendment   doctrine,   the    State   of   Louisiana   did   not\n\nknowingly waive its Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity when it\n\naccepted federal funds under § 2000d-7(a).\n\n           I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -64-\n\f",

The   panel    of     this   court    which\n\nconsidered Pace’s appeal concluded that the State of Louisiana, the\n\nLouisiana Department of Education and the Louisiana State Board of\n\nElementary and Secondary Education (State Defendants) were entitled\n\nto sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment from all of\n\nPace’s    claims.   The    panel   then     affirmed     the    district     court’s\n\ndismissal of Pace’s claims against the Bogalusa City School Board.\n\nWe took this case en banc, first to consider whether the state\n\ndefendants were entitled to immunity from Pace’s claims under the\n\nEleventh Amendment and, second, to consider the merits of Pace’s\n\nclaims under the IDEA, ADA and § 504.               For the reasons discussed\n\nbelow, we now conclude that the State waived its right to immunity\n\nunder the Eleventh Amendment and therefore the State defendants are\n\nnot entitled to immunity from Pace’s § 504 and IDEA claims.                    On the\n\nmerits,    we   conclude    that   the    district      court    did   not     err    in\n\ndismissing Pace’s IDEA claims and that the district court correctly\n\nconcluded that the dismissal of Pace’s IDEA claims precluded his\n\ninaccessibility claims under the ADA and § 504.                  We reject Pace’s\n\nargument    that    because     different      legal    standards      control       his\n\ninaccessibility      claims     under    ADA/504,      those    claims    were       not\n\nlitigated in his IDEA action.            A 1997 amendment and implementing\n\nregulations to the IDEA expressly require schools to comply with\n\nthe identical standards for new construction that ADA/504 and their\n\nregulations require.\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fI.    FACTUAL AND LEGAL BACKGROUND\n\n       The     factual      and     procedural        background        of    this     case     is\n\naccurately and succinctly presented in the panel opinion:\n\n            In 1994, at the age of fifteen, Travis Pace (Pace)\n       was enrolled at Bogalusa High School.             He is\n       developmentally delayed, confined to a wheelchair, and\n       suffers from cerebral palsy and bladder incontinence. In\n       July 1997, Pace’s mother requested a due process hearing\n       under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\n       (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. § 1400, et seq., as she believed that\n       Pace was denied a “free appropriate public education”\n       (FAPE) due to a lack of handicap accessible facilities at\n       Bogalusa High School and deficiencies in Pace’s\n       “individualized education programs” (IEPs). The hearing\n       officer found that the Bogalusa City Schools System2\n       provided Pace with a FAPE in compliance with the IDEA,\n       and the State Level Review Panel (SLRP) affirmed the\n       hearing officer’s decision.\n\n            In September 1997, Pace filed a complaint with the\n       Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Education\n       (OCR), alleging violations of § 504 of the Rehabilitation\n       Act (§ 504), 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), and Title II of the\n       Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12132.\n       The OCR and BCSB resolved allegations that the BCSB\n       operated services, programs, and activities that were\n       physically inaccessible to or unusable by individuals\n       with disabilities by entering into a voluntary written\n       agreement   under   which   the   BCSB   would   identify\n       accessibility barriers and the OCR would oversee the\n       development of a compliance plan.\n\n            In March 1999, Pace filed suit in federal district\n       court, seeking damages and injunctive relief against the\n       BCSB, the Louisiana State Board of Elementary and\n       Secondary Education, the Louisiana Department of\n       Education, and the State of Louisiana, alleging\n       violations of the IDEA, the ADA, § 504 of the\n       Rehabilitation Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and various state\n\n\n\n       2\n         The hearing examiner made hearings with regard to the Bogalusa City Schools System. In\nfederal court, Pace brought suit against the Bogalusa City School Board. For all practical purposes,\nthese two entities are the same and will be referred to as “BCSB.”\n\n                                               -3-\n\f       statutes.3 The district court bifurcated Pace’s IDEA and\n       non-IDEA claims. In separate orders, it affirmed the\n       SLRP decision by dismissing Pace’s IDEA claims, then\n       granted the defendants’ motions for summary judgment on\n       Pace’s non-IDEA claims. Pace appeals both decisions.\n\n\n              II.     STATE IMMUNITY UNDER THE ELEVENTH AMENDMENT\n\n       We consider first the defendants’ arguments that they are\n\nentitled        to    sovereign        immunity      from   Pace’s      claims      under      the\n\nEleventh Amendment. At the core of this Eleventh Amendment dispute\n\nis the question whether, when Louisiana accepted particular federal\n\nfunds, it waived the immunity afforded it by the Eleventh Amendment\n\nto suits under § 504 and the IDEA.4\n\nA.     THE TEXT      AND   FUNCTION   OF THE   ELEVENTH AMENDMENT\n\n       We start, as always, with the text.                       The Eleventh Amendment\n\nstates:\n\n                The Judicial power of the United States shall not be\n                construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,\n                commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States\n                by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects\n                of any Foreign State.5\n\nThese forty-three words —— adopted in swift response to the Supreme\n\n\n\n\n       3\n        We do not consider Pace’s § 1983 claim and state law claims because he did not brief them\non appeal.

Georgia6 that Article III permitted\n\na state to be sued in federal court7 —— protect states from such\n\nlitigation.8 The protection thus afforded, however, has long since\n\nbeen expanded beyond the plain text of the Amendment.                             “Though its\n\nprecise terms bar only federal jurisdiction over suits brought\n\nagainst one State by citizens of another State or foreign state,”\n\nthe Supreme Court’s interpretation of the Amendment has “recognized\n\nthat the Eleventh Amendment accomplished much more.”9                            The immunity\n\nafforded to states under the Eleventh Amendment “implicates the\n\nfundamental constitutional balance between the Federal Government\n\nand the States.”10            Therefore, at its core, the Eleventh Amendment\n\nserves        “as     an     essential       component        of     our     constitutional\n\nstructure.”11\n\n       Nevertheless, Eleventh Amendment immunity is not absolute.

We begin with\n\nan overview of the Court’s current framework for assessing when a\n\nsuit against a state may proceed in federal court.\n\nB.     EXCEPTIONS     TO   ELEVENTH AMENDMENT IMMUNITY\n\n       There are two fundamental exceptions to the general rule that\n\nbars an action in federal court filed by an individual against a\n\nstate.        First,       a   state’s       Eleventh       Amendment        immunity         may   be\n\nabrogated when Congress acts under § 5, the Enforcement Clause of\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment.12                 Second, a state may consent to suit in\n\nfederal court.13\n\n       1.      Abrogation under § 5 of the Fourteenth\n               Amendment\n\n       Congress        can     single-handedly            strip      the     states      of    their\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity and thereby authorize federal court\n\nsuits by individuals against the states.                          When Congress does this,\n\nit is exercising its power to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n\nIn Reickenbacker v. Foster,14 we examined the Supreme Court’s cases\n\n\n       12\n          U.S. CONST. amend. XIV, § 5 (“The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate\nlegislation, the provisions of this article.”).\n       13\n          The term “abrogation” is not synonymous with “consent” or “waiver.” When a state\nconsents to suit or waives its Eleventh Amendment immunity, it knowingly and voluntarily forfeits\nthe immunity’s protections. In contrast, when Congress acts under its Fourteenth Amendment power\nto abrogate, the state has no choice.\n       14\n            </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"26075\"><a href=\"/opinion/26075/reickenbacker-v-foster/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">974</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 2001).

At the very\nleast, its holding has been overruled as to Title II claims implicating a person’s fundamental right of\naccess to the courts. In addition, after Lane we do not look solely at the state level for a history and\npattern of unconstitutional action; we also examine discrimination by nonstate government entities.\n\n                                                 -6-\n\fconcerning congressional abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity\n\nunder § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment and derived the following\n\ntest for determining whether a federal statute is a valid exercise\n\nof Congress’s power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment and,\n\nconsequently, whether the statute abrogates Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity: (1) The statute must contain an unequivocal statement of\n\ncongressional intent to abrogate; (2) Congress must have identified\n\na history and pattern of unconstitutional action by the states; and\n\n(3)    the      rights      and   remedies         created      by    the    statute       must     be\n\ncongruent         and    proportional         to    the    constitutional           violation(s)\n\nCongress sought to remedy or prevent.15 If these three requirements\n\nare satisfied, states are subject to federal jurisdiction in suits\n\nunder the statute adopted pursuant to § 5, regardless of any\n\nabsence of consent.\n\n       2.

Clear Statement: “Knowing”\n\n     In Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman,26 the Court\n\nanalyzed Congress’s power to impose conditions on a state’s receipt\n\nof federal funds and pronounced:\n\n               There can, of course, be no knowing acceptance if a State\n               is unaware of the conditions or is unable to ascertain\n               what is expected of it. Accordingly, if Congress intends\n               to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it\n               must do so unambiguously.... By insisting that Congress\n               speak with a clear voice, we enable the States to\n               exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of the\n               consequences of their participation.27\n\nThus, we know that this stringent clear-statement rule ensures that\n\nwhen a state foregoes its Eleventh Amendment immunity in exchange\n\nfor federal funds, it does so “knowingly.”28                In our reading of\n\nPennhurst, the only “knowledge” that the Court is concerned about\n\nis a state’s knowledge that a Spending Clause condition requires\n\nwaiver of immunity, not a state’s knowledge that it has immunity\n\nthat it could assert.                At bottom, we conclude that if Congress\n\nsatisfies the clear-statement rule, the knowledge prong of the\n\nSpending Clause waiver analysis is fulfilled.\n\n               ii.     Non-Coercive: “Voluntary”\n\n     If the clear-statement rule is satisfied, a state’s actual\n\nacceptance of clearly conditioned funds is generally voluntary.\n\n\n\n     26\n          </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110458\"><a href=\"/opinion/110458/pennhurst-state-school-and-hospital-v-halderman/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1981).\n     27\n          Id. at 17 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).\n     28\n          See also Dole, 483 U.S. at 207.\n\n                                              -11-\n\fThe only exception to this presumption arises if the spending\n\nprogram itself is deemed “coercive,” for then a state’s waiver is,\n\nby definition, no longer voluntary.\n\n     In summary, the Supreme Court has articulated two ways that a\n\nstate can be subject to an individual’s suit in federal court,\n\nregardless of the Eleventh Amendment. First, Congress may abrogate\n\nstate immunity. Second, the state may waive its Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity by consent.      If waiver results from participation in a\n\nSpending Clause program, the program must be a valid exercise of\n\nCongress’s spending power; the waiver condition must satisfy the\n\nclear-statement rule (thereby ensuring that the state’s waiver is\n\n“knowing”); and the program must be non-coercive (automatically\n\nestablishing that the waiver is “voluntary”).\n\nC.   WAIVER OF ELEVENTH AMENDMENT IMMUNITY PURSUANT   TO   CONDITIONAL\n     SPENDING PROGRAMS\n\n     Keeping firmly in mind the Court’s current framework for\n\nanalyzing when a state may be subject to suit in federal court, we\n\nturn to the particular facts and legal contentions of the instant\n\ncase.   The two statutory provisions at issue purport to have\n\nconditioned Louisiana’s receipt of federal funds on its waiver of\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity to suits under § 504 and the IDEA.\n\nSpecifically, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-7 conditions a state’s receipt of\n\nfederal money on its waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity to\n\nactions under § 504 and other federal anti-discrimination statutes:\n\n           A State shall not be immune under the Eleventh\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f               Amendment of the Constitution of the United States from\n               suit in Federal court for a violation of section 504 of\n               the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, title IX of the\n               Education Amendments of 1972, the Age Discrimination\n               Act of 1975, title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n               or the provisions of any other Federal statute\n               prohibiting discrimination by recipients of Federal\n               financial assistance.29\n\nSimilarly, 20 U.S.C. § 140330 conditions a state’s receipt of\n\nfederal IDEA          funds     on    its    consent       to    suit under         that     Act.31\n\nApplying the framework set forth in Dole, we proceed to determine\n\nwhether Louisiana validly waived its immunity when it accepted the\n\nconditioned federal dollars.\n\n       Louisiana does not dispute that the first and third prongs of\n\nthe Dole analysis, i.e., whether the Spending Clause statute at\n\nissue was enacted in pursuit of the general welfare, and whether\n\nthe condition is sufficiently related to the federal interest in\n\n\n\n\n       29\n           42 U.S.C. § 2000d-7(a)(1). Congress enacted § 2000d-7 in response to Atascadero, in\nwhich the Court held that the Rehabilitation Act neither abrogated Eleventh Amendment immunity\nnor effectively conditioned states’ receipt of federal funds on a waiver of that immunity. Atascadero,\n473 U.S. at 245-47. According to the Court, the statute did not contai n a clear statement of\ncongressional intent either to abrogate or to require a waiver. Id.\n       30\n          20 U.S.C. § 1403(a) reads as follows: “A State shall not be immune under the eleventh\namendment to the Constitution of the United States from suit in Federal court for a violation of this\nchapter.”\n       31\n          The section was passed by Congress in response to Dellmuth v. Muth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112292\"><a href=\"/opinion/112292/dellmuth-v-muth/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1989).\nIn Dellmuth, the Supreme Court held that the predecessor to the IDEA (the Education of the\nHandicapped Act) lacked a sufficiently clear statement of Congressional intent to abrogate Eleventh\nAmendment immunity to claims under the statute. Id. at 232. The conditional-spending issue was\nnot raised in the case.\n\n                                               -13-\n\fthe program funded,32 are satisfied here. Consequently, we restrict\n\nour consideration to the three remaining prongs of the Dole test.\n\nFollowing prior panels of this court,33 and every circuit (but one)\n\nthat has made these inquiries, we conclude that the statutes at\n\nissue validly conditioned Louisiana’s receipt of these federal\n\nfunds on its waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity.34\n\n\n       32\n           In its en banc brief, Louisiana mentioned a relatedness challenge to § 2000d-7, but that\nargument was not presented to the panel, and Louisiana’s en banc brief fails to develop it beyond a\nbare assertion. Thus, Louisiana has waived its relatedness challenge. See L & A Contracting Co. v.\nS.

First,\n\nLouisiana         contends          that,        because    it   “believed”     that   the\n\nRehabilitation Act had already abrogated its Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity, it “did not and could not know that [it] retained any\n\nsovereign        immunity      to     waive       by   accepting    conditioned    federal\n\nfunds.”53        Likewise, Louisiana asks us to conclude that § 1403 was\n\nan   unsuccessful           attempt         at    abrogation;      therefore,   maintains\n\nLouisiana, it could not have “knowingly” waived its immunity under\n\nthe IDEA when it accepted federal IDEA funds.\n\n      Even though it found that the statutory provisions at issue\n\nare unambiguous,54 the panel nevertheless concluded that Louisiana’s\n\n\n      50\n           Id.\n      51\n           Id.\n      52\n           Id.\n      53\n           Pace, 325 F.3d at 616.\n      54\n           Pace, 325 F.3d at 615.\n\n                                                  -19-\n\fpurported         waivers     of     Eleventh    Amendment       immunity       are    invalid\n\nbecause they were not knowing.                   The panel drew support from the\n\nholding in Garcia, but its reasoning differed slightly from the\n\nSecond Circuit’s.             According to the panel opinion, “[b]elieving\n\nthat [the Rehabilitation Act and the IDEA] validly abrogated their\n\nsovereign immunity, the State defendants did not and could not know\n\nthat they retained any sovereign immunity to waive by accepting\n\nconditioned federal funds.”55\n\n       The fatal flaw with that syllogism lies in the fact that\n\nneither the mandates of the Rehabilitation Act nor the requirements\n\nof the IDEA apply to a state agency that has not received either\n\nsome federal funding (in the case of the Rehabilitation Act) or\n\nfederal IDEA dollars (in the case of the IDEA).56                         Therefore, it is\n\nimpossible for Congress to have “abrogated” a state’s immunity to\n\n§ 504 or IDEA suits if the relevant state agency did not receive\n\nfederal funds during the time period in which it was alleged to\n\nhave    violated        an    individual’s       statutory        rights.        It    follows\n\nindisputably that Louisiana’s Eleventh Amendment immunity to § 504\n\nand IDEA claims was intact before the state accepted federal funds.\n\nThus, Louisiana did have Eleventh Amendment immunity to waive by\n\naccepting the clearly conditioned federal funds.\n\n\n       55\n            Pace, 325 F.3d at 616.\n       56\n          See 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (pro hibiting discrimination against the disabled through “any\nprogram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance”); 20 U.S.C. §§ 1412, 1415 (conditioning\nstate agencies’ receipt of federal funds on compliance with the requirements of the IDEA).\n\n                                              -20-\n\f     The dissent nevertheless insists that, during the time that\n\n§ 504 and the IDEA were thought to abrogate Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity, Louisiana could have believed that it lacked immunity to\n\n§ 504 and IDEA suits even before it received federal funds under\n\nthose statutes.57    This ignores the conditional-spending nature of\n\nthe Rehabilitation      Act   and   the   IDEA.   The   Acts’   substantive\n\nprovisions regulate only state agencies that have accepted the\n\nrelevant federal funds.       Thus, it makes no sense to say that the\n\nState was subject to private actions for damages under § 504 and\n\nthe IDEA before the substantive provisions of those statutes\n\napplied to it.      Contrary to the dissent’s accusation,58 we do not\n\nconfuse the doctrines of abrogation and waiver; rather, we point\n\nout that ——     even before Garrett —— Louisiana could have avoided\n\nsuits under § 504 and the IDEA altogether by declining federal\n\nfunding.      Louisiana clearly had Eleventh Amendment immunity to\n\nwaive at the time that it accepted the federal funds and expressly\n\nobligated itself to comply with the dictates of the Rehabilitation\n\nAct and the IDEA.\n\n     Further, during the relevant time period, §§ 2000d-7 and 1403\n\nput each state on notice that, by accepting federal money, it was\n\n\n\n     57\n       Post at 9 (“[T]he State acted quite rationally in assuming\nbetween 1996 and 1998 that it had no sovereign immunity to waive\nwhen it accepted federal education funds under conditions specified\nby § 504 and IDEA.”).\n     58\n          Post at 10 & n.7.\n\n                                    -21-\n\fwaiving its Eleventh Amendment immunity. Under Dole, if the clear-\n\nstatement requirement is met, the state is conclusively presumed to\n\nhave “known” that receipt of clearly conditioned federal funds\n\nrequires the state to abide by the condition (i.e., waiver of\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity).\n\n     In addition, the Garcia approach is problematic for a number\n\nof reasons, the most fundamental of which is that, by focusing its\n\ninquiry on what the state could have believed, the Second Circuit\n\nengrafted a subjective-intent element onto the otherwise objective\n\nSpending Clause waiver inquiry.          In other words, Garcia’s approach\n\nemploys the wrong jurisprudential test, because it distorts what is\n\nnecessary      to   show     knowledge    for    Spending        Clause      waivers.\n\nAnalytically,       the    “knowledge”    question      that    we     ask   when   we\n\nundertake the Spending Clause waiver inquiry is coextensive with\n\nthe clear-statement rule; for, when a state actually accepts funds\n\nthat are clearly conditioned on a waiver of Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity, it is held objectively to “know” that it is accepting all\n\nclearly stated conditions.           That it might not “know” subjectively\n\nwhether   it    had   any    immunity    to    waive    by   agreeing        to   those\n\nconditions is wholly irrelevant.\n\n     The dissent asserts that, by focusing on the clear-statement\n\nrequirement, we have disregarded College Savings Bank’s “clear\n\ndeclaration” requirement.            But College Savings Bank was not a\n\nconditional-spending         case.        There,       the     Court    invalidated\n\n“constructive waivers” of Eleventh Amendment immunity “based upon\n\n                                        -22-\n\fthe State’s mere presence in a field subject to congressional\n\nregulation.”59            Such a constructive waiver is a far cry from a\n\nstate’s acceptance of federal funds that are explicitly conditioned\n\non its waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity.                     In fact, the College\n\nSavings Bank opinion expressly distinguished conditional-spending\n\nwaivers        of     Eleventh     Amendment         immunity,   which   it   said    were\n\n“fundamentally different from” illegitimate constructive waivers.60\n\nNothing in College Savings Bank indicates that, when the clear-\n\nstatement requirement is met, a state can be said to lack knowledge\n\nthat by accepting federal funds it waives its Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity.\n\n       In sum, Garcia and the dissent would subjugate the bright-line\n\nof objective reasoning to the slippery slope of assessing a state’s\n\nsubjective belief.61             If, like the panel, we were to follow that\n\napproach, we would be getting into the business of looking past the\n\nstraightforward objective facts, i.e., (1) the clear statement\n\nrequiring waiver and (2) the state’s actual, uncoerced acceptance\n\nof federal funds, in an attempt to fathom what was in a state’s\n\n“head,” a precarious exercise indeed.

In    the    most      general       sense,      the     unconstitutional-\n\nconditions         doctrine       examines        the     extent       to    which      government\n\nbenefits may be conditioned or distributed in ways that burden\n\nconstitutional rights or principles.64                          For at least two reasons,\n\nLouisiana’s reliance on the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine is\n\nmisplaced.\n\n        First, as evidenced by the dearth of cases employing it in\n\nthis context,65 the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine is most\n\nmeaningful when the government imposes a condition of questionable\n\nconstitutional character on an individual right.

Accord Lipscomb, 299 F.3d at 319 (noting that the Supreme\nCourt “quickly abandoned” the view espoused in Butler).\n\n                                                 -25-\n\fthe constitutional “right” at issue is structural rather than\n\npersonal.         Consequently, for the reasons announced in the Third\n\nCircuit’s analysis in Koslow v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the\n\ndoctrine is inapplicable.             The Koslow court considered whether the\n\nRehabilitation           Act,      including          §    2000d-7,         imposed        an\n\nunconstitutional condition on Pennsylvania’s receipt of federal\n\nfunds.       In    refusing      to   apply     the   unconstitutional-conditions\n\ndoctrine to the conditioning of federal funds on the waiver of\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity, the Third Circuit stated:\n\n              [T]he   Supreme  Court    has  not   yet  applied   the\n              “unconstitutional conditions” doctrine to cases between\n              two sovereigns. Unlike private persons, states have the\n              resources to serve their citizens even if the federal\n              government, through economic incentives, encourages a\n              particular result. A state’s political powers——not the\n              least of which is the power to levy taxes on its\n              citizens——help ensure the federal government does not\n              “coerce” the state through economic “encouragement.” An\n              individual citizen, in contrast, lacks these formidable\n              institutional resources.66\n\nWe embrace that reasoning.\n\n       Second, the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine, even when\n\napplied piecemeal by the Supreme Court, is anchored at least in\n\npart in a theory of coercion or compulsion.67 In this context, that\n\n\n\n\n       66\n         302 F.3d at 174 (citing Frost & Frost, 271 U.S. at 593; New York, 505 U.S. at 171-72;\nDole, 483 U.S. at 210-11).\n       67\n         See id. (“The “unconstitutional conditions” doctrine is based on the proposition that\ngovernment incentives may be inherently coercive.”). See also Kathleen M. Sullivan,\nUnconstitutional Conditions, 102 HARV. L. REV. 1415, 1428-55 (1989).\n\n                                            -26-\n\fconcern is subsumed in the non-coercion prong of the Dole test.68\n\nIn other words, in the Spending Clause context, any role that the\n\nunconstitutional-conditions                    doctrine        might       have      in     cabining\n\nCongress’s authority to give funds in exchange for waiving immunity\n\nis    already         part-and-parcel           of    the      standard        Spending        Clause\n\nanalysis.           Thus, no independent constitutional bar invalidates\n\nLouisiana’s waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n\n        5.        Are These Programs Coercive?\n\n        In light of Dole, we must determine whether the conditional-\n\nspending schemes at issue are unduly coercive.                               We hold that they\n\nare not.          A state can prevent suits against a particular agency\n\nunder § 504 by declining federal funds for that agency.69                                    A state\n\ncan avoid suit under the IDEA merely by refusing IDEA funds.                                      And,\n\nto do so in either case, the state would not have to refuse all\n\nfederal assistance.70              Moreover, no circuit has accepted a coercion\n\nchallenge          to    either      the     Rehabilitation            Act      or    the      IDEA.71\n\nTherefore, we refuse to invalidate Louisiana’s waiver on coercion\n\ngrounds.\n\n\n\n\n        68\n             See supra text accompanying note 24.\n        69\n             See 29 U.S.C. § 794(b)(1).\n        70\n             See 20 U.S.C. §§ 1411(a)(1), 1412, 1403.\n        71\n          See, e.g., Jim C., 235 F.3d at 1082 (rejecting a coercion challenge to the validity of a waiver\nof state Eleventh Amendment immunity to § 504 claims).\n\n                                                 -27-\n\fD.     ABROGATION      OF   IMMUNITY\n\n       Alternatively, Pace asks this en banc court to rule that\n\nCongress —— acting under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment —— in fact\n\nabrogated          Louisiana’s          Eleventh       Amendment    immunity,        leaving\n\nLouisiana subject to suit on Pace’s ADA, Rehabilitation Act, and\n\nIDEA claims.                As we hold that Louisiana waived its Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity with respect to the Rehabilitation Act and the\n\nIDEA, it is not necessary for us to address Pace’s contention that\n\nLouisiana’s           immunity     to    suit    under     those    statutes      was     also\n\nabrogated.           Neither is it necessary for us to consider whether\n\nTitle II of the ADA abrogates Eleventh Amendment immunity in this\n\ncase.       First, the Supreme Court, in Tennessee v. Lane,72 held that\n\nTitle II          abrogates      sovereign       immunity    to    the   extent     that     it\n\nimplicates the accessibility of judicial services, but refused to\n\nconsider         its       application     to     other     rights,      including      those\n\nconsidered to be fundamental under the Constitution.73                         Because (1)\n\nthe Supreme Court has never before recognized access to public\n\neducation74 or freedom from disability discrimination in education75\n\nto be fundamental rights, and (2) it is unnecessary to address\n\n\n       72\n            </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134743\"><a href=\"/opinion/134743/tennessee-v-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

IDEA\n\n       We agree with and adopt that portion of the panel opinion\n\naffirming the district court’s judgment which in turn affirmed the\n\nadministrative determination that Pace was not entitled to relief\n\nunder the IDEA.\n\n       We pause only to emphasize the somewhat unusual nature of a\n\nproceeding under the IDEA. As required by the statute,85 Pace first\n\npursued his administrative claim.                      He was granted a hearing by a\n\nhearing examiner           where      he   had    an    opportunity        to    present      his\n\nevidence demonstrating that the inaccessibility of various portions\n\nof the Bogalusa campus prevented him from receiving a free and\n\nappropriate public education (FAPE).                     The hearing examiner, after\n\nhearing the evidence and making a personal inspection of the\n\ncampus, rejected Pace’s inaccessibility claims and concluded that\n\nthe defendants had complied with the IDEA and had provided a FAPE\n\nto Pace.86 Pace then challenged the hearing examiner’s findings and\n\nconclusion in his administrative appeal to the State Level Review\n\nPanel (SLRP).          The SLRP also rejected Pace’s claims and affirmed\n\nthe hearing examiner in all respects.87                       Pace then filed suit in\n\nfederal district court as authorized by 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(1)(A).\n\n       85\n            See 20 U.S.C. 1415(l).\n       86\n       The hearing examiner thoroughly reviewed the testimony and\nphysical evidence presented to her and rejected in wholesale\nfashion Pace’s various claims of inaccessibility. R. 94.\n       87\n          The language used by the SLRP also makes it clear that this review panel found absolutely\nno merit to Pace’s inaccessibility claims.

The district court considered all of Pace’s claims of\n\ninaccessibility           that      he     raised       during       the      administrative\n\nproceedings.89 The court considered the administrative record along\n\nwith the new evidence offered by Pace and gave “due weight” to the\n\nfindings of the hearing examiner and SLRP. Ultimately, the district\n\ncourt agreed with the hearing examiner that Bogalusa High School\n\nhad provided Pace with a FAPE by complying with the IDEA in all\n\n\n       88\n       See 20 U.S.C. § 1415 (i)(2) (A) (Any party aggrieved by the\nfindings and decisions...shall have the right to bring a civil\naction with respect to the complaint pursuant to this section,\nwhich action may be brought...in a district court of the United\nStates...).\n       89\n         Pace sought relief from the district court to remedy the school board’s refusal to make the\nfollowing areas accessible:\n\n               •       bathroom facilities\n               •       classrooms on the second rather than first floor of the school\n               •       elevator access\n               •       exiting classroom during fire drills\n               •       cafeteria\n               •       school health center\n               •       auditorium\n               •       music room\n               •       insufficient parking spaces\n               •       lack of ramps (accessible entrances)\n\n\n                                              -33-\n\faspects,    including         that    the    campus    was   accessible   to   the\n\nwheelchair-bound Pace.           The district court’s conclusion is fully\n\nsupported by the record and we therefore affirm the district\n\ncourt’s rejection of Pace’s claims under the IDEA.\n\nB.   ADA   AND   SECTION 504\n\n     In addition to his IDEA claims, Pace also asserted claims\n\nunder the ADA and § 504 in his suit.                  The district court severed\n\nthe IDEA claims from these non-IDEA claims.                    After dismissing\n\nPace’s IDEA claims, the district court then considered defendants’\n\nmotion for summary judgment seeking exoneration under § 504 and the\n\nADA. The district court granted the defendants’ motion for summary\n\njudgment on grounds that the factual bases for the non-IDEA claims\n\nwere indistinct from the resolved IDEA claims.                The district court\n\nconcluded further that principles of issue preclusion applied to\n\npreclude Pace from pursuing his redundant non-IDEA claims.                     Pace\n\nargues that the district court committed legal error in applying\n\nprinciples of issue preclusion to bar his non-IDEA claims.\n\n     Issue preclusion or collateral estoppel is appropriate when:\n\n(1) the identical issue was previously adjudicated; (2) the issue\n\nwas actually litigated; and (3) the previous determination was\n\nnecessary to the decision.

Thus, Pace contends, because\n\na   “significantly            different”         legal       standard        applies        to     his\n\naccessibility issues under the ADA and § 504, these latter claims\n\nwere never litigated and issue preclusion should not apply. We\n\ntherefore compare the standards of accessibility under the IDEA on\n\nthe one hand and the ADA and § 504 on the other to determine\n\nwhether the legal standards are “significantly different.”\n\n       As    indicated        above,       the    IDEA     requires        states      and       local\n\neducational agencies receiving federal IDEA funds to make a FAPE\n\navailable to children with certain disabilities between the ages of\n\n3 and 21.        The IDEA imposes extensive requirements on schools to\n\nsafeguard the disabled child’s right to a FAPE.                            20 U.S.C. §§ 1414,\n\n1415.

Thus, as\n\nwe stated in section II-D above, for the purposes of this appeal,\n\nthe ADA          and    §   504    and     their       implementing           regulations          impose\n\nidentical obligations on the defendants and grant identical rights\n\nto Pace.92\n\n        In Pace’s brief to us on his non-IDEA claims brought under §\n\n504 and the ADA he complains only that parts of the Bogalusa High\n\nSchool campus are inaccessible to him.

He argues that his non-IDEA accessibility claims are not\n\nprecluded because different legal standards apply to his ADA and §\n\n504 accessibility claims, and these claims have never been litigated\n\nor    decided.          When      we    consider        the     equivalent         standards        for\n\naccessibility in schools under the IDEA on the one hand and the\n\nADA/504 on the other, it becomes clear that we should reject this\n\nargument.\n\n        Congress required in a 1997 amendment to the IDEA that any\n\n        93\n          Subpart D in the regulations to § 504 includes general regulations for preschool,\nelementary, and secondary education regarding placement (34 C.F.R. § 104.35), procedural\nrequirements (34 C.F.R. § 104.36) and the general FAPE requirement (34 C.F.R. § 104.33).\n        94\n          Although it is illogical to do so, one can read the § 504 regulations to say that a school need\nnot comply with accessibility requirements in Subpart C to provide a § 504 FAPE under 104.33 when\na student complains that part of a school’s campus is inaccessible. In such a situation, it is more\nsensible to read these regulations as requiring a school’s compliance with subpart C’s accessibility\nrequirements before it can be said to provide a § 504 FAPE. Regardless of whether the accessibility\nrequirement s must be met before a § 504 FAPE is provided, subpart C of the § 504 regulations\nclearly requires new construction in the school to meet the regulation’s accessibility requirements.\n\n                                                 -38-\n\fconstruction of new facilities must comply with either (1) The\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings\n\nand Facilities (ADAAG); or (2) The Uniform Federal Accessibility\n\nStandards (UFAS). 20 U.S.C. § 1404(b).95                             Thus, with respect to a\n\nphysically disabled child such as the wheelchair-bound Pace, the\n\nschool can comply with the IDEA’s accessibility requirements by\n\nsatisfying either the ADAAG or UFAS.96\n\n        Pace presents no argument that the accessibility standards for\n\nnew construction of school buildings under the ADA or § 504 are more\n\ndemanding or even different from the standards required under the\n\n1997 amendment to the IDEA. This is understandable, because the\n\nregulations governing accessibility in schools under the ADA/504\n\nrequire a school engaged in new construction to conform to the same\n\nstandards as the IDEA, either the ADAAG or UFAS.\n\n        New construction and alterations of public facilities under\n\n\n\n        95\n             20 U.S.C. § 1404(b) provides in pertinent part:\n\n                  ...Any construction of new facilities or alteration of existing facilities under\n                  subsection (a) of this section shall comply with the requirements of–\n\n                         (1) appendix A of part 36 of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations\n                         (commonly known as the “Americans with Disabilities Accessibility\n                         Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities”); or\n\n                         (2) appendix A of part 101-19.6 of title 41, Code of Federal\n                         Regulations (commonly known as the “Uniform Federal Accessibility\n                         Standards”).\n        96\n             The corresponding regulation to 20 U.S.C. § 1404 is found at 34 C.F.R. § 300.756 and is\nidentical.\n\n                                                  -39-\n\fTitle II of the ADA are governed by the regulations found in 28\n\nC.F.R. § 35.151.97          Like the IDEA, the ADA accessibility regulations\n\nrequire a school conducting new construction to comply with either\n\nthe ADAAG or UFAS.               Section 504's accessibility regulations are\n\nvirtually identical to the ADA’s,98 and also demand that schools\n\nengaging in new construction comply with the same federal guidelines\n\nrequired by the IDEA.             Thus, Pace’s argument that the accessibility\n\nstandards are different under IDEA and ADA/504 is meritless.\n\n       In summary, under the IDEA, when, as here, a child complains\n\nthat his disability renders a portion of the campus inaccessible,\n\nthis triggers the application of the 1997 amendments to the IDEA.\n\nIn determining whether the school has met its obligations under the\n\namendment and provided the disabled student with a FAPE, the hearing\n\nexaminer, the SLRP, and the district court must determine whether\n\nthe area of the school in question complies with either the ADAAG\n\nor UFAS. These are the same federal guidelines the school must\n\ncomply with to satisfy the accessibility requirements of the ADA and\n\n§ 504.\n\n       97\n         38 C.F.R. 35.151(c) provides in pertinent part:\n               (c) Accessibility standards. Design, construction, or alteration of facilities in\n       conformance with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS)...or with the\n       Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities\n       (ADAAG)...shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of this section with\n       respect to those facilities...\n       98\n         One minor difference between the accessibility regulations under § 504 and the ADA is that,\nbecause § 504 preceded the ADA and the ADA-specific accessibility regulations (ADAAG), § 504\ndoes not give schools the option of complying with either the ADAAG or UFAS (as do both the\nADA and IDEA), but requires compliance with the UFAS.\n\n                                                -40-\n\f       Pace, as he was required to do by the IDEA, presented his\n\naccessibility          claims       in    his     administrative             claim.          In       their\n\nadministrative findings, both the hearing examiner and the SLRP\n\ndiscussed the 1997 amendment to the IDEA. This makes it clear that\n\nboth were aware that new or existing construction to Bogalusa High\n\nSchool must meet either the ADAAG or UFAS standards before the\n\nschool could fully comply with the IDEA.99\n\n       The only significant summary judgment evidence Pace presented\n\nto the district court on his ADA/504 claims was the report and\n\ndeposition testimony of Donald MaGinnis, an architectural expert.\n\nThe point of his testimony is that structural changes to the\n\nBogalusa campus failed to comply with the ADAAG. Although this same\n\nstandard applied to Pace’s claim under the IDEA, he did not\n\nintroduce this evidence before the hearing examiner. Further, Pace\n\nfailed to offer the expert evidence to the district court to support\n\nhis appeal of the administrative determination under the IDEA.\n\nBecause the accessibility standards under the IDEA and the ADA/504\n\nare identical for new construction of school buildings, Pace has not\n\ndemonstrated that the defendants owed him any greater or even\n\n       99\n        Page five of the State Level Review Panel’s opinion, under the heading “Applicable Law\nand Regulations,” provides:\n\n               Section 605 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments\n       of 1997, states that any construction of new facilities or alteration of existing facilities\n       with use of program funds shall comply with the requirements of Americans with\n       Disabilities Accessibility Guidelines (Appendix A of Part 36 of Title 28, Code of\n       Federal Regulations) or Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (Appendix A of Part\n       101-19.6 of Title 41, Code of Federal Regulations). (R. 63).\n\n                                                 -41-\n\fdifferent obligation in this respect under § 504/ADA than he was\n\nentitled to under the IDEA.      Thus, the accessibility issue Pace\n\nlitigated in his IDEA case and lost is the same issue he sought to\n\nlitigate in his ADA/504 claim.          The district court correctly\n\nconcluded that Pace was precluded from relitigating this issue.\n\n       The only argument Pace presents to us on the applicability of\n\nthe 1997 amendment was presented for the first time in his petition\n\nfor en banc review.    He argued in that petition and argues to the\n\nen banc court that the amendment was not triggered because no\n\nevidence was presented that “IDEA funds” were used to make the\n\nimprovements to the Bogalusa campus.     Pace relies on the following\n\nlanguage in the 1997 amendment to 20 U.S.C. § 1404:\n\n       § 1404.    Acquisition of   equipment;   construction   or\n       alteration of facilities\n            (a) In general\n\n            If the Secretary determines that a program\n            authorized under this chapter would be improved\n            by permitting program funds to be used to\n            acquire appropriate equipment, or to construct\n            new facilities or alter existing facilities,\n            the Secretary is authorized to allow the use of\n            those funds for those purposes.\n\n       Neither the amendment nor the existing statute purports to\n\nrequire a plaintiff to prove the use of IDEA funds or any other fact\n\nas a predicate to seeking relief under the IDEA against a school for\n\nfailing to make its campus accessible in response to a student’s\n\nIEP.    We have found no cases interpreting this amendment or its\n\npredecessor.    Subsection (a) is simply a restyled version of the\n\n\n\n                                 -42-\n\fexisting statute.100         The change is found in Subsection (b), which\n\nincorporates into the IDEA for the first time the ADAAG and UFAS\n\nconstruction standards.            The amended § 1404(a), like the existing\n\nstatute, authorizes the Secretary to allow the use of IDEA funds for\n\nconstruction or alterations.\n\n     To support Pace’s argument that the amended version of § 1404\n\ndoes not apply in this case, amicus seems to argue that structural\n\nalterations to meet accessibility demands in a student’s IEP are not\n\npart of the calculus in determining whether a student has received\n\na FAPE.\n\n     In Weber’s Special Education Law and Litigation Treatise, he\n\nrejects this suggestion in his cogent discussion of the interplay\n\nbetween the IDEA, § 504 and ADA:\n\n     Schools covered by Title II and Section 504 owe\n     obligations not only to students with disabilities but to\n     all persons with disabilities whom they serve. In this\n     sense, the laws are more inclusive than the Individuals\n     with   Disabilities    Education   Act   (IDEA),    whose\n     beneficiaries are children with disabilities who need\n     special education.    Nevertheless, by requiring school\n     districts to provide an appropriate education in the\n     least restrictive environment, IDEA overlaps with Section\n     504 and Title II in terms of the children it covers.\n     Thus, IDEA may require a school district to modify\n     programs or facilities to achieve these ends for an\n\n\n     100\n        The pre-amended version of 20 U.S.C. 1404(a) provided as follows:\n     (a) Authorization for use of funds\n\n            In the case of any program authorized by this chapter, if the Secretary\n            determines that such program will be improved by permitting the\n            funds authorized for such program to be used for the acquisition of\n            equipment and the construction of necessary facilities, the Secretary\n            may authorize the use of such funds for such purposes. (West 1996).\n\n                                            -43-\n\f       individual student. IDEA funds may be used for removal\n       of architectural barriers or other improvements to\n       accessibility in order to promote appropriate education\n       for children with disabilities.(Footnotes omitted)101\n       (emphasis added)\n\n       Weber further describes a school’s duty under the IDEA to\n\naddress accessibility concerns in the IEP as “a component of\n\nappropriate special education and related services in the least\n\nrestrictive environment.”102               This discussion makes it clear that\n\nwhen a student’s IEP raises concerns of accessibility to the\n\nschool’s campus, the determination of whether these concerns have\n\nbeen met is a necessary component in resolving whether the student\n\nhas received a FAPE.\n\n       The Hearing Examiner tried this controversy on the premise that\n\nthe entire IDEA statute, including the 1997 amendment, applied to\n\nPace’s claims, and no one argued to the contrary.                              The Hearing\n\nExaminer did not require the parties to file extensive pre-trial\n\npapers. However, she did require each party to list the issues they\n\nwanted the hearing examiner to address. Neither Pace nor the school\n\nboard asserted that an issue was presented with respect to the\n\nexpenditure of IDEA funds or any other issue relating to the\n\napplicability of the 1997 amendment to § 1404.                           Considering the\n\nstrict duty that the ADAAG and UFAS construction guidelines impose\n\n\n\n       101\n             MARK C. WEBER, SPECIAL EDUCATION LAW AND LITIGATION TREATISE 7.1 (2D ED. 2002).\n       102\n         Weber, note 3 at 7.2. (Footnotes omitted). Weber concludes that “modifications [to the\ncampus] may include wheelchair ramps, handrails, accessible toilets, and water fountains.”\n\n                                             -44-\n\fon the school, it was also reasonable for the Hearing Examiner to\n\nassume that the school board would object if there was some basis\n\nfor it        to   argue    that     these     guidelines        did    not     apply     to    the\n\narchitectural improvements ordered by Pace’s IEP.                                    It is not\n\nsurprising that Pace did not object to the Hearing Examiner’s\n\napplication of such rigorous standards; it was in his interest at\n\nthe time to require the school to meet the toughest standards\n\npossible in making the architectural improvements.\n\n       After three hearings, the Hearing Examiner issued her report\n\nfinding that Bogalusa High had provided Pace with a FAPE.                                       The\n\nHearing Examiner explicitly found that the ADAAG guidelines applied,\n\nmeaning that she concluded that Pace’s accessibility concerns\n\nregarding improvements made to the campus triggered the application\n\nof the 1997 amendment to § 1404 of the IDEA.                          Otherwise, the ADAAG\n\nguidelines would be irrelevant. In making her findings, the Hearing\n\nExaminer relied on the voluminous administrative record, which shows\n\nthat Bogalusa received substantial federal IDEA funds during 1996\n\nand 1997, the relevant time period.103                        IDEA regulations make it\n\nclear that federal IDEA funds cannot be co-mingled with state\n\nfunds.104        The Hearing examiner also had the benefit of Pace’s IEP\n\nand the testimony of the School Board’s Maintenance Supervisor that\n\n\n       103\n           For the 1996-97 fiscal year, the record shows that Bogalusa was the recipient of $164,213\nin federal funds for its “Special Education” program.\n       104\n             34 CFR § 300.152.\n\n\n                                              -45-\n\fthe construction changes were made in response to Pace’s IEP\n\nfacilitator’s instructions.           Even if a showing of the use of IDEA\n\nfunds was required,           it was reasonable for the Hearing Examiner to\n\nconclude that IDEA funds were used and that under the amended\n\nversion of 20 U.S.C. § 1404 the school provided Pace with a FAPE.\n\n      Pace appealed the Hearing Examiner’s order to the State Level\n\nReview Panel (SLRP).           Again, the record reflects no argument from\n\nany party to that appeal that the entire IDEA statute, including the\n\n1997 amendment to § 1404, did not apply.             The SLRP in its opinion\n\nexplicitly applied the 1997 amendment, discussed Pace’s arguments,\n\nand after rejecting them, affirmed the Hearing Examiner.\n\n      Pace then filed suit in federal district court seeking relief\n\nunder the IDEA, §504 and the ADA.              He specifically alleged in his\n\npetition that the state received federal IDEA funds.105             His core\n\nclaim was that the school had failed to comply with the ADAAG.\n\n      The primary evidence Pace presented to the district court was\n\nthe deposition testimony and report of architect Donald MaGinnis,\n\nwho testified that the structural changes to the campus failed to\n\nmeet ADAAG standards. Thus, Pace’s federal claim was predicated on\n\nthese guidelines, made applicable to the IDEA by the 1997 amendment\n\nto   § 1404.          Because the Hearing Examiner and the SLRP had rejected\n\nPace’s accessibility claims based on application of these same\n\nstandards (the ADAAG and UFAS), the district court concluded that\n\n\n      </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span>\n            <span class=\"reporter\">Rawle</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n                                        -46-\n\fPace was precluded from relitigating his accessibility issues.\n\n     Suffering summary judgment in the district court on both his\n\nIDEA and non-IDEA claims, Pace sought appellate relief from this\n\ncourt.       In his initial brief to the panel, Pace argued that the\n\ndistrict court erred in accepting the Hearing Examiner and SLRP’s\n\nfindings of accessibility to preclude his non-IDEA accessibility\n\nclaims.          However,      Pace     did    not     base     his   argument   on   the\n\ninapplicability of the 1997 amendment to § 1404 or that the Hearing\n\nExaminer erred in applying the ADAAG guidelines to the structural\n\nchanges. The School Board did argue to the panel that the amendment\n\napplied and that the Hearing Examiner and SLRP had used the very\n\nsame federal guidelines in deciding Pace’s IDEA claims that Pace\n\nsought to litigate in his non-IDEA action.106\n\n     Faced with the appellee’s argument that his non-IDEA claims\n\nwere precluded due to the previous application of the 1997 amended\n\nversion of § 1404, Pace filed a reply brief with the panel.                       Again,\n\nhe made no effort to refute the School Board’s argument that the\n\n1997 amendment to § 1404 applied.\n\n     Without any opposition from Pace as to the proper application\n\nof § 1404 to the improvements to Bogalusa High’s campus, the panel\n\naccepted the School Board’s unchallenged argument and relied on the\n\n\n\n\n     106\n           Appellee Bogalusa City School Board’s Brief at 32.\n\n\n                                              -47-\n\f1997 amendment to affirm the district court’s judgment.107 The panel\n\nspecifically cited the 1997 amended version of § 1404 to support its\n\nconclusion that issue preclusion was proper because accessibility\n\nto the campus had already been litigated under the same federal\n\nstandards.108\n\n     In response to the panel’s decision, Pace sought en banc\n\nreview, where he argued for the first time that § 1404 did not apply\n\nto the improvements he demanded in his IEP, because “[t]here is no\n\nproof that construction in this case would be covered by this\n\nprovision.”109\n\n     In sum, we do not read the 1997 amendment to require proof that\n\nIDEA funds were used for improvements to trigger the amendment.\n\nEven if the statute can be read in this manner, there is evidence\n\nto support an inference that IDEA funds were used to make the\n\nstructural changes.              More importantly, we cannot permit Pace to\n\nchange his position at will. He was obviously happy to have the\n\nadministrative bodies and the trial court apply the 1997 amendment\n\nto § 1404 (and the strict ADAAG guidelines) when it was helpful to\n\nhim. He cannot at this late date reverse his position when he finds\n\nthat application of those guidelines are not in his best interest.\n\n\n\n     107\n           Pace v.

He argues that the IDEA’s “savings clause,” gives him the\n\nright to maintain a cause of action under the ADA and § 504.110                                 We\n\nagree that Pace is not limited to a claim under the IDEA and that\n\nhe can assert claims under the ADA and § 504.                           But his ability to\n\nassert non-IDEA claims does not mean that general principles of\n\nissue preclusion do not apply to preclude his redundant claims.111\n\nBecause Pace’s claims under the ADA and § 504 are factually and\n\nlegally indistinct from his IDEA claims, issue preclusion is proper\n\nin this case.\n\n       Because Pace is precluded from litigating the question of\n\nwhether the defendants have any obligation under the ADA and § 504\n\nto make further architectural or structural changes in the buildings\n\non the Bogalusa campus, his claim for an injunction ordering such\n\nchanges must also fail.\n\n\n       110\n          The IDEA’s “savings clause” is found in 20 U.S.C 1415(l), and provides in pertinent part:\n               Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict or limit the rights,\n       procedures, and remedies under...the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990...title\n       V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973...or other Federal laws protecting the rights of\n       children with disabilities...\n       111\n           See, e.g., Burlovich v.

The majority agrees\n\n                                -52-\n\fwith   Pace    that      Louisiana        waived      its   sovereign       immunity      as   a\n\ncondition      of       accepting    federal          funds   under     §     504    of    the\n\nRehabilitation Act and IDEA. In so doing, the majority has forsaken\n\nthe “particularly strict standard” the Eleventh Amendment demands,\n\nignored the Supreme Court’s settled test for evaluating a waiver of\n\nconstitutional          rights,     and    inexplicably       discounted       the     unique\n\nfactual context from which this case arose.\n\n                                          I.

The same test used in\n\nevaluating waiver of other fundamental constitutional rights must\n\nbe employed in the Eleventh Amendment context as well. As the Court\n\nheld, there is no justification for creating a separate and distinct\n\ntest for Eleventh Amendment waiver purposes.                     Thus, “[t]he classic\n\ndescription of an effective waiver of a constitutional right is the\n\nintentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or\n\nprivilege.” Id.

Thus, under\nthe   current   state   of   the   law,  §   2000d-7(a)    is   not\nunconstitutionally coercive. As a result, the State of Louisiana\nacted voluntarily for purposes of the constitutional waiver test.\nBut, with due regard for precedent, I am compelled to raise the\nfollowing question: “If not now, and on this showing, when, and on\nwhat showing” will federal grants be deemed unconstitutionally\ncoercive?

The Rehabilitation Act, pursuant to 29\nU.S.C. § 794(a), requires non-consenting States to forfeit all\nfederal funds.     For the Louisiana Department of Education,\nrenouncing all federal funds would cut its budget by $804,269,621,\nor 75%. Dole counseled that “in some circumstances the financial\ninducement offered by Congress might be so coercive as to pass the\npoint at which pressure turns into compulsion.” 483 U.S. at 211\n(emphasis added). To date, the Supreme Court has not found a case\nthat warranted vindication of this principle.         Nevertheless,\nLouisiana and its children would suffer extreme consequences here\nif the State were to lose massive federal assistance by asserting\nits constitutional right to sovereign immunity.\n\n                                            -55-\n\fCollege Savings Bank controls the Eleventh Amendment waiver inquiry\n\nand demands more than a congressional “clear statement” — it also\n\nrequires the State to make a “clear declaration” of its intent to\n\nwaive its immunity.           In College Savings Bank, the Supreme Court\n\nrecognized that for a State “knowingly” to waive its sovereign\n\nimmunity, not only must Congress make clear its intention to so\n\ncondition       federal      funds,    but     the    State   must    expressly      and\n\nunequivocally        waive    its     immunity.        “There   is    a    fundamental\n\ndifference between a State’s expressing unequivocally that it waives\n\nits immunity and Congress’s expressing unequivocally its intention\n\nthat if the State takes certain action it shall be deemed to have\n\nthat immunity.”       Coll.

But whether it can avoid liability based upon a\n\ncontractual/waiver theory is a different question from whether it\n\nretained Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity post-abrogation.119\n\nThus, the relevant Eleventh Amendment inquiry remains whether\n\nLouisiana reasonably believed, based on objective evidence, that the\n\nRehabilitation Act and the IDEA validly abrogated its sovereign\n\nimmunity — not whether it could have chosen to reject the federal\n\nfunds anyway.\n\n               Second, the majority contends that requiring the State to\n\n\n       118\n                 The unmistakable difference between abrogation and waiver is complicated by\nstatutes, like § 2000d-7(a), that attempt to achieve both in the same provision. Nevertheless, the\ncircuit courts and the panel opinion here agree that statutory language may, in fact, constitute both\nan attempted abrogation and conditional waiver provision.

However,\na statute’s capacity to serve dual purpo ses does not justify the majority’s confusion of the two\nconcepts.\n       119\n              The majority implies that Louisiana’s self-interested acceptance of funds should\nprevent the State from arguing that it might have chosen to forego the funds for the sake of\nmaintaining sovereign immunity. Louisiana’s mistaken (though eminently reasonable) belief that\nabrogation had occurred distorted this calculation, however. That the State does have immunity to\nwaive now throws into high relief the potential coercion inherent in the federal government’s funding\ncondition. The “cost” of Louisiana’s resting on its constitutional right is over $800 million annually!\n\n                                                -60-\n\fmake a “clear declaration” problematically “engraft[s] a subjective-\n\nintent element onto an otherwise objective Spending Clause waiver\n\ninquiry.”        See Majority Op. at 22.                  Unfortunately, the majority\n\nmisunderstands the nature of the “clear declaration” requirement,\n\na requirement consonant with the Supreme Court’s longstanding\n\nobjective approach to waiver.                  The Supreme Court uniformly applies\n\na “totality of the circumstances” test to waiver questions involving\n\nfundamental constitutional rights.                      Fare v.

Hence, the Supreme Court considers a variety\n\nof objective factors, not subjective intent, to determine whether\n\na constitutional right has validly been waived.

College Savings Bank’s “clear declaration” requirement\n\nreiterates the Supreme Court’s waiver test in the Eleventh Amendment\n\ncontext, and so would I.120\n\n\n       120\n                The majority’s approach unquestionably achieves a bright-line rule that the Supreme\nCourt’s traditional waiver inquiry cannot. However, this approach is impermissible in the context of\nwaiver of fundamental constitutional rights.\n\n       An express written statement of waiver of the right to remain silent or the right to\n\n                                              -61-\n\f              Given this court’s ruling in Coolbaugh that the State had\n\nno immunity to waive, followed by an unsuccessful en banc poll and\n\nthe Supreme Court’s denial of certiorari in that case, it is\n\ninconceivable that Louisiana somehow, based on the “straightforward\n\nobjective facts,” knowingly chose to waive a right that was non-\n\nexistent when it acted. In a sense, the State of Louisiana is being\n\nforced, by today’s majority, to bear the burden of this court’s\n\nmistake of law in Coolbaugh.                    Consider this analogy:                 the police\n\ninstruct a criminal defendant, “for his own good,” to sign a waiver\n\nof counsel form, while telling him that the waiver is “meaningless,\n\nbecause you have no counsel rights to waive.”                           Who would argue that\n\nthe waiver is knowing, especially if the police showed him a court\n\ndecision confirming this view?                      That the dupe is an individual\n\ndefendant rather than the State does not, per College Savings, make\n\nthis a different case, nor does the fact that the waiver falls under\n\nthe Spending Clause rather than some other type of enactment.                                     The\n\nmajority’s opinion violates College Savings Bank.\n\n              In this rare instance, Louisiana could not have knowingly\n\nwaived its sovereign immunity in the relevant time period before the\n\nGarrett decision. The majority’s approach strangely counsels States\n\n\n\n\n       counsel is usually strong proof of the validity of that waiver, but it is not inevitably\n       either necessary or sufficient to establish waiver. The question is not one of form, but\n       rather whether the defendant in fact knowingly and voluntarily waived the rights\n       delineated in the Miranda case.\n\nNorth Carolina v.

Moreover, because Lane was\n\n                                        -63-\n\fwritten very narrowly, I conclude that this court’s decision in\n\nReickenbacker remains valid in holding that ADA Title II, apart from\n\nthe Lane scenario, does not validly abrogate States’ Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity.    See Reickenbacker, 274 F.3d at 983.         The fate\n\nof § 504 abrogation was also sealed in Reickenbacker based on the\n\ncourt’s conclusion that Title II and § 504 impose “virtually\n\nidentical” obligations.    Id.     For the reasons stated in Reicken-\n\nbacker and in the panel opinion, I would hold that Congress could\n\nnot constitutionally abrogate state sovereign immunity in § 504 or\n\nthe similarly structured IDEA statute pursuant to § 5 of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment.     The remedies imposed by those laws “far\n\nexceed [ ] [those] imposed by the Constitution, and [I] cannot\n\nconclude that they are congruent and proportional to the legislative\n\nfindings of unconstitutional discrimination against the disabled by\n\nthe states.”   Reickenbacker, 274 F.3d at 983.\n\n                           III.
