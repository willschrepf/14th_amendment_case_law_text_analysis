(“Chicken-Out”),\n\nChicken Out the Door Inc. (“Chicken Out the Door”), Nicholas Cordone, Richard\n\nHindin, and Joseph Marinucci failed to pay her overtime and other wages that were due\n\nto her under the Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”) and D.C. and Maryland wage laws.\n\nPlaintiff has since voluntarily dismissed her claims against defendants Cordone, Hindin,\n\nand Marinucci. (See Mot. to Dismiss Claims Against Defs. Nicholas Cordone, Joseph\n\nMarinucci, & Richard Hindin Without Prejudice (“Mot. to Dismiss”), ECF No. 28;\n\nMinute Order of Jan. 12, 2016 Granting Mot. to Dismiss.) 1\n\n        Plaintiff served the complaint on Chicken Out the Door on April 1, 2015, and\n\nlater served Chicken-Out on May 5, 2015. (See Return of Service/Affidavit, ECF No.\n\n10; Return of Service/Affidavit, ECF No. 17.) On May 11, 2015, the Clerk of Court\n\n\n\n1\n  Plaintiff initially pled collective and class action claims for violations of the various wage statutes at\nissue, but has since voluntarily dismissed those claims as well. (See Notice of Voluntary Dismissal of\nClass & Collective Action Claims Pursuant to FRCP 41(a)(1)(A)(i), ECF No. 30.)\n\ffiled an entry of default against Chicken Out the Door, noting that that defendant had\n\nfailed to respond to the complaint or otherwise defend itself in this litigation. (See\n\nEntry of Default, ECF No. 14.) The Clerk of Court similarly filed an entry of default\n\nagainst Chicken-Out on June 29, 2015. (See Entry of Default, ECF No. 20.) Plaintiff\n\nmoved for default judgment with respect to her claims against Chicken Out the Door\n\nand Chicken-Out on February 24, 2016 (see ECF No. 31), and on April 12, 2016, this\n\nCourt referred Plaintiff’s motion for default judgment to a Magistrate Judge for a report\n\nand recommendation (see Minute Order of April 12, 2016). 2\n\n       The assigned Magistrate Judge, G. Michael Harvey, issued a Report and\n\nRecommendation regarding Plaintiffs’ motion on May 13, 2016 (R &R, ECF No. 12,\n\nattached hereto as Appendix A), which reflects his belief that Plaintiff’s motion for\n\ndefault judgment should be granted in part and denied in part. (R & R. at 1.)\n\nSpecifically, Magistrate Judge Harvey found that Chicken Out the Door and Chicken-\n\nOut “willfully violated the FLSA, DCMWA, MWHL, and MWPCL when they failed to\n\npay Plaintiff overtime compensation and failed to pay her for her last two-and-a-half\n\nweeks of work[,]” (id. at 10), and that Plaintiff is entitled to the full amount of unpaid\n\nwages, overtime compensation, liquidated damages, attorney’s fees, and costs that she\n\nrequests in her motion, as well as post-judgment interest (id. at 10–25). Magistrate\n\nJudge Harvey recommended that this Court deny Plaintiff’s request for prejudgment\n\ninterest under the FLSA because that statute delineates the exclusive remedies for any\n\nviolations—specifically, unpaid wages, unpaid overtime, and liquidated damages—and\n\n\n\n\n2\n Chicken Out the Door and Chicken-Out have not responded to the motion for default judgment, or\notherwise appeared in this action.\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fthe Report and Recommendation recommends that this Court award those remedies.\n\n(Id. at 25–26.)\n\n        Magistrate Judge Harvey’s Report and Recommendation also specifically advised\n\nthe parties that failure to file timely objections may result in waiver of further review of\n\nthe matters addressed in the Report and Recommendation. (Id. at 26.) Under this\n\nCourt’s local rules, any party who objects to a Report and Recommendation must file a\n\nwritten objection with the Clerk of the Court within 14 days of the party’s receipt of the\n\nReport and Recommendation. LCvR 72.3(b).\n\n        As of the current date—more than two months after the Report and\n\nRecommendation was issued—no objections have been filed. Moreover, this Court has\n\nreviewed Magistrate Judge Harvey’s Report and Recommendation, and it agrees with\n\nthe report’s analysis and conclusions. Therefore, as set forth in the separate order that\n\naccompanies this Memorandum Opinion, the Report and Recommendation of the\n\nMagistrate Judge entered in this matter on May 13, 2016, is ADOPTED in its entirety.\n\nAccordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion for Default Judgment is GRANTED in part and\n\nDENIED in part, and JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF PLAINTIFF in\n\nthe amount of $5,628.00 in unpaid wages, overtime compensation, and liquidated\n\ndamages; $1,609.30 in attorney’s fees; and $574.50 in costs, plus post-judgment interest\n\nas provided in 28 U.S.C. § 1961. 3\n\n\nDATE: July 22, 2016                                      Ketanji Brown Jackson\n                                                         KETANJI BROWN JACKSON\n                                                         United States District Judge\n\n\n3\n Plaintiff’s collective action claims are dismissed pursuant to her notice of voluntary dismissal (see\nsupra n. 1); therefore, no separate order dismissing these claims is required.

P\n41(a)(1)(a).\n\n\n                                                    3\n\f                                                   Appendix A\n\n\n                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                       FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n____________________________________\n                                     )\nMARIA SERRANO                        )\n                                     )\n            Plaintiff,               )\n                                     )\n            v.                       )    Case No. 15-cv-276 (KBJ/GMH)\n                                     )\nCHICKEN-OUT, INC. et al.             )\n                                     )\n            Defendants.              )\n____________________________________)\n\n                               REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n        This matter was referred to the undersigned for a report and recommendation on\n\nPlaintiff’s motion for default judgment. Defendants Chicken-Out, Inc. and Chicken Out the\n\nDoor, Inc. employed Plaintiff in their fast-food restaurants. They did not pay her overtime and\n\nother wages she was due under the Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”) and D.C. and Maryland\n\nlaw. As a result, she brought the instant suit. Defendants failed to appear, forcing Plaintiff to\n\nseek a default judgment against them. After reviewing the entire record, 1 the undersigned\n\nrecommends that the Court grant in part and deny in part Plaintiff’s motion.\n\n                                             BACKGROUND\n\n        Defendants operated fast-food chicken restaurants in the District of Columbia, Maryland,\n\nand Virginia. Compl. ¶ 23. Plaintiff initially worked at one of Defendants’ D.C. locations as a\n\nsalad and sandwich maker and as a cashier. Id. ¶ 37. She worked at this restaurant beginning in\n\nthe summer of 2010. Id. She was paid a wage of $9.00 per hour. Id. She regularly worked\n\n\n\n1\n  The relevant docket entries for purposes of this Report and Recommendation are: (1) Plaintiff’s Complaint\n(“Compl.”) [Dkt. 1]; (2) Plaintiff’s Motion for Default Judgment as to Defendants Chicken-Out and Chicken Out the\nDoor (“Mot.”) [Dkt. 31]; and (3) Plaintiff’s Corrected Memorandum in Support of Plaintiff’s Motion for Default\nJudgment (“Memo.”) [Dkt. 32-1].\n\f                                                     Appendix A\n\n\nforty-two hours per week but was never paid overtime wages. Id. ¶ 38. The D.C. restaurant\n\nwhere she worked closed in October 2013, at which time Plaintiff’s employment ceased. Id. ¶\n\n41.\n\n         Approximately five weeks later, Defendants asked Plaintiff to work in the same capacity\n\nat one of their Rockville, Maryland locations. Id. ¶ 42. She worked at the Maryland restaurant\n\nfrom late November 2013 through May 15, 2014, when that restaurant too closed. Id. ¶¶ 43, 48.\n\nFor the period from her start at the Rockville restaurant through March 2014, Plaintiff again\n\nconsistently worked forty-six hours per week but was never paid overtime wages. Id.\n\nDefendants justified this failure by telling Plaintiff that they did not pay overtime and that “she\n\nshould be grateful for the extra hours of work.” Id. ¶ 46. For the period from April 2014 to the\n\nrestaurant’s closure, Plaintiff did not work any overtime. Id. ¶ 48. However, she claims that she\n\nwas never paid at all for her work from April 28, 2014, to May 15, 2014. Id. ¶ 49. After the\n\nRockville location closed, Defendants asked Plaintiff to work at their restaurant in McLean,\n\nVirginia. Id. ¶ 50. Because she had not been paid for her two-and-a-half weeks of work, she\n\nrefused. Id.\n\n         In this suit, Plaintiff claims that Defendants’ failure to pay her overtime wages violated\n\nthe FLSA, 29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq., the D.C. Minimum Wage Act Revision Act (“DCMWA”),\n\nD.C. Code § 32-1001 et seq., and the Maryland Wage and Hour Law (“MWHL”), Md. Code\n\nLab. & Empl. § 401 et seq. Compl. ¶¶ 75–93. She further claims that Defendants’ failure to pay\n\nher at all for her last two-and-a-half weeks of work at the Rockville restaurant violated the\n\nMaryland Wage Payment and Collection Law (“MWPCL”), 2 Md. Code Lab. & Empl. § 3-501 et\n\n\n\n2\n Plaintiff refers to this statute as the “Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Act” in her complaint, but the statute\nprovides that its short title should be the “Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Law.” Md. Code Lab. & Empl. §\n3-509.\n\f                                                       Appendix A\n\n\nseq. Compl. ¶¶ 94–99. As relief, Plaintiff requests that the Court award her: (1) the unpaid\n\nwages and overtime compensation which she is owed, plus an additional amount as liquidated\n\ndamages; (2) prejudgment interest on all amounts owed; and (3) her reasonable costs and\n\nattorney’s fees incurred in this action. Compl. at 18–20.\n\n         Plaintiff originally brought these claims against three additional defendants – individuals\n\nwhom Plaintiff alleged were owners or managers of the two corporate defendants. See id. ¶¶ 17–\n\n19. On Plaintiff’s motion, those three defendants have been dismissed from this case. See Jan.\n\n13, 2016 Minute Order. Plaintiff also originally brought her claims under the FLSA, the\n\nDCMWA, and the MWHL on her own behalf and on behalf of those similarly situated – known\n\nin the wage-law world as a “collective action” – she has requested that those claims be\n\nvoluntarily dismissed. See Notice of Voluntary Dismissal of Class and Collective Action Claims\n\n[Dkt. 30].3\n\n         The instant motion seeks a default judgment against the remaining two defendants –\n\nChicken-Out, Inc. and Chicken Out the Door, Inc. Mot. at 1. The Clerk of the Court entered\n\ndefault against Chicken Out the Door on May 11, 2015, and against Chicken-Out on June 29,\n\n2015. See Clerk’s Entry of Default as to Chicken Out the Door, Inc. [Dkt. 14]; Clerk’s Entry of\n\nDefault as to Chicken-Out, Inc. [Dkt. 20]. Because Defendants have not appeared, as a matter of\n\ncourse no response to Plaintiff’s motion has been filed.\n\n\n\n3\n  Although the Court referred this matter to the undersigned solely for resolution of Plaintiff’s motion for default\njudgment, see Apr. 12, 2016 Minute Order, Plaintiff does devote some argument to the propriety of voluntary\ndismissal of her collective-action claims. See Memo. at 5. Because Defendants have not answered or otherwise\nresponded to Plaintiff’s complaint, and because Plaintiff’s proposed class has not yet been certified, Rule\n41(a)(1)(A)(i) compels the Court to dismiss these claims. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(A)(i) (“Subject to Rules\n23(e), 23.1(c), 23.2, and 66 and any applicable federal statute, the plaintiff may dismiss an action without a court\norder by filing[] a notice of dismissal before the opposing party serves either an answer or a motion for summary\njudgment[.]”); see also id. 23(e) (setting procedures for voluntary dismissal of the claims of a class once certified).\nAccordingly, the undersigned recommends that the Court dismiss Plaintiff’s collective-action claims without\nprejudice.\n\f                                              Appendix A\n\n\n                                      LEGAL STANDARDS\n\n       A.      Default Judgment\n\n       Obtaining a default judgment requires two steps. Lanny J. Davis & Assocs. LLC v.\n\nRepublic of Equatorial Guinea, 962 F. Supp. 2d 152, 161 (D.D.C. 2013). First, the plaintiff must\n\nrequest that the Clerk of the Court enter default against a party who has “failed to plead or\n\notherwise defend.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(a). Second, the plaintiff must move for entry of a default\n\njudgment. Id. 55(b). Default judgment is available when “the adversary process has been halted\n\nbecause of an essentially unresponsive party.” Boland v. Elite Terrazzo Flooring, Inc., 763 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 64, 67 (D.D.C. 2011). “Default establishes the defaulting party’s liability for the well-\n\npleaded allegations of the complaint.” Id.\n\n       However, “[t]he court has considerable latitude in determining the amount of damages.”\n\nId. (citation omitted). “Although the default establishes a defendant’s liability, the court is\n\nrequired to make an independent determination of the sum to be awarded unless the amount of\n\ndamages is certain.” Int’l Painters & Allied Trades Indus. Pension Fund v. R.W. Amrine\n\nDrywall Co., Inc., 239 F. Supp. 2d 26, 30 (D.D.C. 2002). “Accordingly, when moving for\n\ndefault judgment, the plaintiff must prove its entitlement to the amount of monetary damages\n\nrequested” using “detailed affidavits or documentary evidence” on which the court may rely.\n\nFanning v. Permanent Solution Indus., Inc., 257 F.R.D. 4, 7 (D.D.C. 2009). The court may\n\nconduct a hearing regarding the scope of damages, Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(2), but is not required to\n\nif the affidavits and evidence supporting the motion are sufficiently detailed. Buckley v.\n\nPaperboy Ventures, LLC, 869 F. Supp. 2d 9, 11 (D.D.C. 2012); see also Int’l Painters, 239 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 30 (observing that an evidentiary hearing may not be necessary if damages can “be\n\ncalculated with relative simplicity”).\n\f                                            Appendix A\n\n\n       B.      Federal, D.C., and Maryland Wage and Hour Laws\n\n       The FLSA, DCMWA, and MWHL all require employers to pay their workers a minimum\n\nwage and, if the employee works more than forty hours in a workweek, overtime compensation\n\nat the rate of one-and-a-half times the employee’s regular hourly rate. 29 U.S.C. § 207(a)(1);\n\nD.C. Code § 32-1003(c); Md. Code Lab. & Empl. §§ 3-415, 3-420. Similarly, the MWPCL\n\nprovides that upon cessation of employment, an employer must pay “all wages due for work that\n\nthe employee performed before the termination of employment, on or before the day on which\n\nthe employee would have been paid the wages if the employment had not been terminated.” Md.\n\nCode Lab. & Empl. § 3-505(a).\n\n       It is a long-standing principle in wage law that where an employer fails to produce\n\nrecords of the employee’s hours and wages, the employee can meet her burden of proof by\n\n“produc[ing] sufficient evidence to show the amount and extent of that work as a matter of just\n\nand reasonable inference.” Andersen v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., 328 U.S. 680, 687 (1946); see\n\nalso Encinas v. J.J. Drywall Corp., 840 F. Supp. 2d 6, 8 (D.D.C. 2012). When assessing\n\ndamages under the Andersen standard, a court may draw inferences from oral testimony, sworn\n\ndeclarations, and whatever relevant documentary evidence the plaintiff provides. See Pleitez v.\n\nCarney, 594 F. Supp. 2d 47, 49 (D.D.C. 2009) (relying on plaintiffs’ production of “some time\n\nsheets,” “some paychecks,” and “sworn declarations setting out their best recollection of when\n\nthey worked, what they were paid, and what they were not paid”). Nevertheless, the court’s\n\ninferences must be consistent with the evidence in the record. Id. at 51. The Andersen standard\n\nalso applies to claims under the DCMWA, MWHL, and MWPCL. See Turner v. Human\n\nGenome Sci., Inc., 292 F. Supp. 2d 738, 748 (D. Md. 2003) (claims under the MWHL); Lopez v.\n\nLawns ‘R’ Us, No. DKC-07-2979, 2008 WL 2227353, at *3 (D. Md. May 23, 2008) (claims\n\f                                                  Appendix A\n\n\nunder the MWPCL) (citing Donovan v. Bel-Loc Diner, Inc., 780 F.2d 1113, 1116 (4th Cir.\n\n1985)); Pleitez, 594 F. Supp. 2d at 49 (claims under the DCMWA).\n\n        Although the normal limitations period for an FLSA claim is two years, if an employer\n\nwillfully violates the FLSA, the statute of limitations extends to three years. 29 U.S.C. § 255(a).\n\nA violation is willful if the employer “‘either knew or showed reckless disregard for the matter\n\nof whether its conduct was prohibited by the statute.’” Wilson v. Hunam Inn, Inc., 126 F. Supp.\n\n3d 1, 7 (D.D.C. 2015) (quoting McLaughlin v. Richard Shoe Co., 486 U.S. 128, 133 (1988)).\n\n“Courts have found willful violations in cases where the [d]efendant knew the FLSA applied, but\n\nmade no effort to ascertain whether their payroll practices complied with the law.” Id. (citing\n\nAyala v. Tito Contractors, 82 F. Supp. 3d 279, 285–86 (D.D.C. 2015)). In addition to recovering\n\nunpaid compensation, the FLSA provides that an employer “shall be liable to the employee . . .\n\nin an additional equal amount as liquidated damages.” 29 U.S.C. § 216(b). An employer may\n\navoid the liquidated damages penalty only if it “shows to the satisfaction of the court that the act\n\nor omission giving rise to such action was in good faith and that he had reasonable grounds for\n\nbelieving” that the failure to pay “was not in violation of the [FLSA].” Id. § 260.\n\n        The DCMWA has a three-year limitations period. D.C. Code § 32-1013 (1993). An\n\nemployer who fails to pay wages as required by the Act is “liable to that employee in the amount\n\nof the unpaid wages, and an additional amount as liquidated damages” unless the employer\n\nshows “to the satisfaction of the court that [the failure to pay overtime] was in good faith and that\n\nthe employer had reasonable grounds for the belief that the act or omission was not a violation of\n\nthis act. . . .” Id. § 32-1012(b)(2). 4\n\n\n\n4\n  The DCMWA was amended in early 2015 and now mandates that the amount of liquidated damages to be awarded\nto victorious plaintiffs is three times the amount of unpaid wages. Compare D.C. Code § 32-1012(a) (2015), with\nD.C. Code § 32-1012(a) (1993), appended to Plaintiff’s motion as Attachment A. Because the relevant events\n\f                                                  Appendix A\n\n\n        Similarly, the MWHL and MWPCL have a three-year limitations period. Md. Code, Cts.\n\n& Jud. Proc. § 5-101. An employee seeking to recover unpaid wages or overtime compensation\n\nunder Maryland law has two avenues to do so: under the MWHL or under the MWPCL. See\n\nPeters v. Early Healthcare Giver Inc., 97 A.3d 621, 625 (Md. 2014) (“Read together, [the\n\nMWHL and the MWPCL] allow employees to recover unlawfully withheld wages from their\n\nemployer, and provide an employee with two avenues to do so.”); id. at 654–55 (holding that an\n\nemployee “has a right to bring a private cause of action under the [MWPCL] to recover any\n\nunlawfully withheld overtime wages”). Under the MWPCL, the court may award “an amount\n\nnot exceeding 3 times the wage” if it finds that the employer’s failure to pay required\n\ncompensation was “not as a result of a bona fide dispute.” Md. Code Lab. & Empl. § 3-507.2.\n\n                                              DISCUSSION\n\n        A.      Default Judgment for Violations of Wage Laws\n\n        The Clerk of the Court entered default against Defendants because they failed to plead or\n\notherwise respond to Plaintiff’s complaint. By defaulting, Defendants have admitted all well-\n\npleaded allegations in Plaintiff’s complaint. Boland, 763 F. Supp. 2d at 67. Those allegations\n\nestablish that Defendants violated the FLSA, the DCMWA, and the MWHL when they failed to\n\npay Plaintiff overtime compensation and that Defendants violated the MWPCL when they failed\n\nto pay Plaintiff anything for her last two-and-a-half weeks of work at their Rockville location.\n\n        As a threshold matter, Plaintiff’s allegations make clear that Defendants managed the\n\nrestaurants where she worked and that they controlled employment policies at those restaurants,\n\nincluding pay rates and overtime compensation policies. Compl. ¶¶ 31–33. Defendants\n\ntherefore qualify as Plaintiff’s “employers” under each statute’s broad definition of that term.\n\n\noccurred from 2010 to 2013, the undersigned applies the pre-2015 version of the DCMWA, which contains no\ntrebling requirement.\n\f                                             Appendix A\n\n\nSee Ayala, 82 F. Supp. 3d at 288 (observing that the broad test for whether an entity is an\n\nemployer under the FLSA considers “‘whether the alleged employer (1) had the power to hire\n\nand fire the employees, (2) supervised and controlled employee work schedules or conditions of\n\nemployment, (3) determined the rate and method of payment, and (4) maintained employment\n\nrecords’”) (quoting Morrison v. Int’l Programs Consortium, Inc., 253 F.3d 5, 11 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2001)); Thompson v. Linda And A., Inc., 779 F. Supp. 2d 139, 146 (D.D.C. 2011)\n\n(“[D]eterminations of employer or employee status under the FLSA apply equally under the\n\nDistrict of Columbia wage laws.”); Marroquin v. Canales, 505 F. Supp. 2d 283, 299 (D. Md.\n\n2007) (reasoning that the ability to hire, set wages, and oversee work are factors bearing on\n\nwhether an entity is an “employer” under Maryland wage and hour laws).\n\n       Second, the allegations in Plaintiff’s complaint and the affidavits and documentary\n\nevidence attached to her motion demonstrate that Defendants failed to pay her compensation\n\nwhich she was due. Although Plaintiff does not come forward with exact records of her hours\n\nworked and wages paid, Andersen holds that she is not required to do so. Andersen, 328 U.S. at\n\n687. Instead, her allegations and averments supply the necessary evidence to support her claim.\n\nSee Pleitez, 594 F. Supp. 2d at 49.\n\n       Plaintiff avers that at Defendants’ D.C. location, she regularly worked more than 40\n\nhours per week and averaged at least 42 hours per week. Affidavit of Maria Serrano [Dkt. 31-2]\n\n¶ 4. Similarly, at Defendants’ Maryland location, she regularly exceeded 40-hour workweeks\n\nand averaged at least 46 hours per week. Id. ¶ 5. To her affidavit are appended several paystubs\n\nwhich she avers are representative of the hours she worked and wages she received while\n\nworking for Defendants. Id. ¶ 6. Those paystubs cover pay periods in March, April, and May\n\n2014. Id. at 7–9. While the time period encompassed in the paystubs is limited, they do reveal\n\f                                             Appendix A\n\n\nthat Plaintiff was not paid overtime compensation. For instance, the first pay stub, dated April 4,\n\n2014, shows that Plaintiff worked 89.82 hours during the relevant pay period but was only paid\n\n$808.38. Id. at 7. That amount is the product of Plaintiff’s regular wage, $9.00, multiplied by\n\nthe number of hours she worked. Missing from her wages are $44.19 in overtime wages, which\n\nis the product of her overtime hours – 9.82 – and the additional $4.50 per hour to which she was\n\nentitled.\n\n        Plaintiff further avers that Defendants knowingly violated their duty to pay overtime\n\ncompensation. She states that Defendants knew of their obligation to pay overtime and yet\n\nrefused to pay. Id. ¶ 8. Indeed, upon asking one of her managers why she was not being paid for\n\novertime work, she was told that the company did not pay overtime and that “she should be\n\ngrateful to the company for giving [her] extra hours.” Id. ¶ 9. As for Defendants’ complete non-\n\npayment for Plaintiff’s final two-and-a-half weeks of work at their Rockville location, Plaintiff\n\navers she worked 34 hours during that period but has never been paid for that time. Id. ¶ 11.\n\nWhen she asked about those final hours of work, her managers stated that “they did not know\n\nanything about it.” Id. ¶ 12.\n\n        These sworn statements establish that, despite the clear overtime requirements in the\n\nFLSA, DCMWA, and MWHL, Defendants refused to pay Plaintiff overtime compensation.\n\nAdditionally, Defendants violated the MWPCL by failing to pay Plaintiff for her work during the\n\nperiod from April 28, 2014, through May 15, 2014, when the Rockville restaurant closed.\n\nDefendants never paid her for this work even after Plaintiff gave them notice that they had failed\n\nto pay her. Accordingly, the undersigned recommends that the Court enter default judgment\n\nagainst Defendants.\n\f                                              Appendix A\n\n\n         B.     Amount of Judgment\n\n         Having determined that Defendants willfully violated the FLSA, DCMWA, MWHL, and\n\nMWPCL when they failed to pay Plaintiff overtime compensation and failed to pay her for her\n\nlast two-and-a-half weeks of work, the appropriate measure of Plaintiff’s recovery must next be\n\ndetermined. Plaintiff seeks: (1) her unpaid wages and overtime compensation; (2) liquidated\n\ndamages; (3) prejudgment interest; and (4) her reasonable costs and attorney’s fees. Compl. at\n\n18–20.\n\n                1.     Unpaid Wages and Overtime Compensation\n\n         Plaintiff requests unpaid wages and overtime compensation in the amount of $5,625.00.\n\nMemo. at 13. She seeks compensation for the period beginning three years prior to the\n\ncommencement of this action – February 24, 2012 – through her last date of employment with\n\nDefendants – May 15, 2014. Id. As noted above, the D.C. and Maryland laws applicable here\n\ncarry three-year limitations periods but the FLSA does not. Nevertheless, Plaintiff’s allegations\n\nindicate that she is entitled to recover under the FLSA’s extended three-year limitations period\n\nbecause Defendants’ violations were willful. 29 U.S.C. § 255(a); Pineda v. Masonry Constr.,\n\nInc., 831 F. Supp. 2d 666, 674 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (“Where a default judgment is entered against a\n\ndefendant under the FLSA, allegations that the violations were willful are deemed admitted.”).\n\nDefendants were on notice of their obligation to pay Plaintiff overtime compensation but they\n\nrefused to do so. See, e.g., Ayala, 82 F. Supp. 3d at 286 (“Knowing that the FLSA applies and\n\n‘simply decid[ing] not to comply’ . . . is an example of a willful violation.”) (quoting Wyland v.\n\nD.C. Gov’t, 728 F. Supp. 35, 37 (D.D.C. 1990)); McLaughlin, 486 U.S. at 133 (an employer’s\n\nviolation is willful if it “either knew or showed reckless disregard for the matter of whether its\n\nconduct was prohibited by the statute”); see also Laffey v. Nw. Airlines, Inc., 740 F.2d 1071,\n\f                                              Appendix A\n\n\n1085 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (emphasizing that the willfulness standard does not require the plaintiff to\n\nshow the employer’s “evil intent”). Defendants’ excuse that it had a policy of not paying\n\novertime wages and the Plaintiff was lucky to be given extra work hours falls well short of a\n\nsufficient reason to ignore federal and state wage laws. And, by virtue of their default,\n\nDefendants have forfeited any affirmative defense regarding willfulness under the FLSA. See\n\nJohn R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. U.S., 552 U.S. 130, 133 (2008) (holding that “the law typically\n\ntreats a limitations defense as an affirmative defense that the defendant must raise at the\n\npleadings stage and that is subject to rules of forfeiture and waiver”); Gunawan v. Sake Sushi\n\nRestaurant, 897 F. Supp. 2d 76, 87 (E.D.N.Y. 2012) (finding where an employee had adequately\n\nalleged that the employer was on notice of the FLSA’s overtime compensation requirements, the\n\ndefaulting employer forfeited any affirmative defense that its violations were not willful).\n\n       Plaintiff seeks unpaid overtime compensation for her work at Defendants’ D.C. and\n\nRockville restaurants. For the period from February 24, 2012, through mid-October 2013,\n\nPlaintiff worked at the D.C. location and regularly worked 42 hours per week. As a result, she\n\nestimates that she is owed 2 hours of overtime compensation for each week she worked.\n\nBecause her regular hourly rate was always $9.00, this means that she is owed an additional\n\n$9.00 – $4.50 times 2 hours – for each week of work at the D.C. restaurant. See Affidavit of\n\nJamie Crook [Dkt. 31-3] ¶ 5(c). $9.00 per week multiplied by 86 – the number of weeks she\n\nworked in D.C. – comes to $774.00 in unpaid overtime. Plaintiff seeks unpaid overtime for her\n\nwork at the Rockville restaurant from late November 2013 through April 27, 2014. She\n\nregularly worked 46 hours per week during this period, thus leaving 6 hours of uncompensated\n\novertime per week. See id. ¶ 5(d). At an hourly rate of $9.00, she is owed an extra $27.00 per\n\nweek for these 22 weeks of work. $27.00 per week multiplied by 22 weeks totals $594.00.\n\f                                              Appendix A\n\n\n       Plaintiff also seeks to recover her unpaid wages for the period from April 28, 2014,\n\nthrough May 15, 2014 – the last two-and-a-half weeks she worked for Defendants. Memo. at 14.\n\nShe worked 34 hours per week during this period. Id. Having never been paid for any of those\n\nhours, Plaintiff is owed her hourly wage of $9.00 per hour multiplied by 2.5 weeks of 34-hour\n\ndays, resulting in $765.00 in unpaid wages. See Affidavit of Jamie Crook [Dkt. 31-3] ¶ 6.\n\n                2.     Liquidated Damages\n\n       For her unpaid overtime at the D.C. restaurant, Plaintiff also requests that the Court\n\naward an equal amount as liquidated damages under the FLSA and the DCMWA. Doubling her\n\nunpaid overtime at the D.C. location equals $1,548.00. For the Rockville restaurant, Plaintiff\n\nseeks an additional amount equal to two times her unpaid overtime under the MWPCL’s treble\n\ndamages provision. That makes the total amount sought for her work in Maryland $1,782.00.\n\nFinally, for Defendants’ failure to pay her for her last two-and-a-half weeks of work, Plaintiff\n\nagain requests trebled damages under the MWPCL, raising the total request for these final weeks\n\nto $2,295.00.\n\n       Plaintiff is entitled to the liquidated damages she requests. Upon recovery under the\n\nFLSA for unpaid wages, the statute mandates that the court award liquidated damages in an\n\namount equal to the unpaid wages. See 29 U.S.C. § 216(b). The pre-2015 DCMWA gives\n\ndiscretion to the court, requiring that it award “an additional amount as liquidated damages”\n\nwithout specifying the amount to award. See D.C. Code § 32-1012 (1993). Both statutes have a\n\nbuilt-in escape hatch for a defendant employer. If the employer can prove that it acted in good\n\nfaith or reasonably believed that its failure to pay compensation was not a violation of the statute,\n\nthe court may, in its discretion, award no liquidated damages at all or some amount less than the\n\nfull amount authorized in the statute. See 29 U.S.C. § 260; D.C. Code § 32-1012 (1993).\n\f                                                    Appendix A\n\n\nHowever, Defendants’ default means that they cannot meet their burden to prove up this good-\n\nfaith affirmative defense. See Ventura v. L.A. Howard Constr. Co., Case No. 14–cv–01884\n\n(CRC), 2015 WL 5692932, at *4 (D.D.C. Sept. 28, 2015); Radtke v. Caschetta, No. CV 06-2031\n\n(JMF), 2014 WL 3827498, at *2 (D.D.C. Feb. 7, 2014) (“[T]he burden of proof is on the\n\ndefendants to show that they acted ‘in good faith’ and had ‘reasonable grounds for believing’\n\nthat they were not violating the FLSA.”) (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 260). As a result, Plaintiff is\n\nentitled to a doubling of her unpaid wages for her work in D.C. under the FLSA. 5\n\n        The analytic structure governing damages for the MWHL and MWPCL is slightly\n\ndifferent, but the result is the same. Plaintiff has elected to proceed on her claim for violation of\n\nthe MWHL pursuant to the MWPCL, which she is entitled to do. See Peters, 97 A.3d at 625.\n\nThe MWPCL, like the DCMWA, gives the court discretion to award “an amount not exceeding 3\n\ntimes the wage” if it finds that the employer’s failure to pay required overtime compensation was\n\n“not as a result of a bona fide dispute.” Md. Code Lab. & Empl. § 3-507.2. Yet unlike the\n\nFLSA and DCMWA, the MWPCL allows a court to award up to treble damages “in lieu of a flat\n\npayment of unpaid wages.” See Imgarten v. Bellboy Corp., 383 F. Supp. 2d 825, 850 (D. Md.\n\n2005). “[T]he Payment Law’s treble damages provision does not authorize treble damages in\n\naddition to the unpaid wage. . . . Rather, the statute caps an employee’s award at three times that\n\nwage.” Id.\n\n        A bona fide dispute is “‘a legitimate dispute over the validity of the claim or the amount\n\nthat is owing [ ]’ where the employer has a good faith basis for refusing an employee’s claim for\n\n\n5\n  For her work in the District, Plaintiff seeks an award of liquidated damages equal to her unpaid wages. Memo. at\n13–14. Although two statutes, the FLSA and the DCMWA, apply to that portion of her claim, she does not seek two\nawards of liquidated damages for that time. See id. Nor could she, since in this District awards under the FLSA’s\nand DCMWA’s liquidated damages provisions would offset each other. See Ventura, 2015 WL 5692932, at *3–4\n(making one award of liquidated damages for claims under both the FLSA and DCMWA). Furthermore, because\nthe FLSA makes an award of liquidated damages mandatory, the undersigned need not address the issue of the\nCourt’s discretion to award liquidated damages under the DCMWA.\n\f                                              Appendix A\n\n\nunpaid wages.” Peters, 97 A.3d at 657 (quoting Admiral Mort., Inc. v. Cooper, 745 A.2d 1026,\n\n1031 (Md. 2000)). The employer has the burden to show that he has an “‘actual, subjective\n\nbelief that [his] position is objectively and reasonably justified.’” Id. (quoting Barufaldi v.\n\nOcean City, Md. Chamber of Commerce, Inc., 47 A.3d 1097, 1103 (Md. 2012)). A bona fide\n\ndispute might result from “[a]n incorrect legal belief, such as federal preemption.” Id. at 660\n\nn.12.\n\n        As with the good-faith defense under the FLSA and DCMWA, here Defendants, having\n\nnot appeared, have presented no evidence of a bona fide dispute as to their obligation to pay\n\nPlaintiff or the amount they owe her. Id. at 627–28. Yet because of the permissive language in\n\nMWPCL (distinct from the mandatory language in the FLSA), “an employee is not\n\npresumptively entitled to enhanced damages, even if the court finds that wages were withheld\n\nwithout a bona fide dispute.” Id. at 662. The Maryland Court of Appeals has declined to give\n\nspecific guidance to trial courts exercising their discretion under the enhanced damages provision\n\nof the MWPCL, but it has said that “trial courts are encouraged to consider the remedial purpose\n\nof the WPCL when deciding whether to award enhanced damages to employees.” Id. at 663.\n\n        In a decision following the ruling in Peters, a Maryland district court found treble\n\ndamages appropriate because of “the need for remedial action to encourage employers to pay\n\ntheir employees in full and the ‘practical difficulties that employees have in bringing lawsuits to\n\nrecover wages owed.’” Skripchenko v. VIRxSYS Corp., Civil Action No. TDC–13–0004, 2014\n\nWL 4826788, at *12 (D. Md. Sept. 26, 2014). In that case, the employer, who did appear and\n\ndefend, did “not even attemp[t] to identify a legal basis for its failure to pay their employees their\n\nearned wages.” Id. (emphasis in original). The court concluded that “[b]ecause there was\n\nabsolutely no legal defense to the claim for unpaid wages, and with due consideration of the\n\f                                              Appendix A\n\n\nremedial purposes of the statute to provide a greater incentive for employers to pay wages in\n\nfull,” treble damages were appropriate. Id.\n\n       Some other Maryland district courts have established a third consideration for awarding\n\nenhanced damages – whether the plaintiff has proved any consequential damages resulting from\n\nthe failure to pay wages. See, e.g., Lopez, 2008 WL 2227353, at *3 (“Enhanced damages serve\n\nthe dual purposes of compensating employees for consequential losses, such as late charges or\n\nevictions that can occur when employees who are not properly paid are unable to meet their\n\nfinancial obligations; and of penalizing employers who withhold wages without colorable\n\njustification.”); Castillo v. D&P Prof’l Servs., Inc., Civil Action No. DKC 14–1992, 2015 WL\n\n4068531, at *6–7 (D. Md. July 2, 2015); Monge v. Portofino Ristorante, 751 F. Supp. 2d 789,\n\n799 (D. Md. 2010). Lacking evidence that the plaintiff suffered consequential damages from the\n\ndefendants’ MWPCL violations, these courts concluded that doubled, rather than trebled,\n\ndamages were appropriate. Lopez, 2008 WL 2227353, at *3; Castillo, 2015 WL 4068531, at *6–\n\n7; Monge, 751 F. Supp. 2d at 799.\n\n       Like Skripchenko, here Defendants have proffered no basis whatsoever for their failure to\n\npay Plaintiff overtime compensation or their failure to pay her anything for her final two-and-a-\n\nhalf weeks of work. This is primarily because Defendants have not appeared, but the evidence\n\nbefore the undersigned indicates that Defendants could not come up with viable reasons even if\n\nthey had appeared. Defendants, after being notified of their failure to pay Plaintiff overtime,\n\nstated that the company did not pay overtime and that “she should be grateful to the company for\n\ngiving [her] extra hours.” Affidavit of Maria Serrano [Dkt. 31-2] ¶ 9. When confronted about\n\ntheir failure to pay Plaintiff for her last two-and-a-half weeks of work, Defendants merely stated\n\nthat “they did not know anything about it.” Id. ¶ 12. These statements, if they could be\n\f                                                   Appendix A\n\n\ngenerously described as excuses for nonpayment, are not persuasive. There is no suggestion here\n\nthat Plaintiff was anything other than an ordinary, hourly wage employee who was not exempt\n\nfrom the protections of minimum wage and overtime laws. See Compl. ¶ 64. Thus, the Court\n\nhas no evidence that Defendants held any incorrect but forgivable belief, legal or factual,\n\nregarding Plaintiff’s right to payment. See Peters, 97 A.3d at 657, 660 n.12. Defendants\n\ntherefore lack any bona fide dispute that might forestall an award of enhanced damages.\n\n        Considering the remedial purposes of the MWPCL and the total lack of any credible\n\ndefense to Plaintiff’s claim, the undersigned recommends that the Court award Plaintiff trebled\n\ndamages on these claims. Although Plaintiff does not allege any consequential damages\n\nresulting from Defendants’ violations of the MWPCL, the undersigned recommends that the\n\nCourt reject that factor as a requirement for a full award of enhanced damages. In Lopez, where\n\nthis factor originated, the court cited no authority for the proposition that consequential damages\n\nare a relevant consideration in awarding enhanced damages. See Lopez, 2008 WL 2227353, at\n\n*3. Moreover, in its most recent pronouncement on the subject, the Maryland Court of Appeals\n\ndid not raise the existence of consequential harm as an element for the court’s consideration. See\n\nPeters, 97 A.3d at 663. Thus, the undersigned does not find that a lack of consequential damages\n\nmilitates in favor of merely doubled, rather than trebled, damages. 6\n\n          Accordingly, the undersigned recommends that the Court award Plaintiff all the\n\nliquidated and enhanced damages she requests.\n\n\n\n\n6\n  As with the FLSA-DCMWA interaction, see supra note 5, here Plaintiff does not seek liquidated damages under\nthe FLSA and a separate award under the MWPCL. See Memo. at 14. This is proper, since Plaintiff is “entitled to\nrecover liquidated damages under the FLSA or treble damages under the Maryland Wage Payment and Collection\nLaw, but not both.” Quiroz v. Wilhelm Commercial Builders, Inc., Civil Action No. WGC–10–2016, 2011 WL\n5826677, at *3 (D. Md. Nov. 17, 2011).\n\f                                                    Appendix A\n\n\n                 3.       Attorney’s Fees and Costs\n\n        Plaintiff seeks to recover $1,609.30 in attorney’s fees and $574.50 in costs incurred\n\nduring this litigation. Memo. at 15. The FLSA, DCMWA, MWHL, and MWPCL provide for an\n\naward of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to a prevailing plaintiff. 29 U.S.C. § 216(b); D.C.\n\nCode §§ 32-1012(c), 32-1308(b) (1993); Md. Code Lab. & Empl. §§ 3-427(d), 3-507.2(b).\n\nIndeed, an attorney’s fee award is mandatory under the FLSA, the DCMWA, and the MWHL.\n\nSee Falica v. Advance Tenant Servs., Inc., 384 F. Supp. 2d 75, 77 (D.D.C. 2005); D.C. Code §\n\n32-1308(b)(1) (1993); Md. Code Lab. & Empl. § 3-427(d). 7 By obtaining a default judgment\n\nagainst Defendants, Plaintiff qualifies as a prevailing party entitled to attorney’s fees and costs.\n\nSee Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983) (holding that a plaintiff is a “prevailing\n\nparty” if she “‘succeed[s] on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the\n\nbenefit the parties sought in bringing suit’”) (quoting Nadeau v. Helgemoe, 581 F.2d 275, 278–\n\n79 (1st Cir. 1978)); see also Falica, 384 F. Supp. 2d at 77 (noting that the Hensley analysis\n\napplies in FLSA cases).\n\n        The only matter left for the Court, then, is determining what a reasonable award of fees\n\nand costs is in this case. “The initial estimate of a reasonable attorney’s fee is properly\n\ncalculated by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation times a\n\nreasonable hourly rate.” Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 888 (1984).\n\n                          a.       Reasonable Rate\n\n        Rates are reasonable if they are “in line with those prevailing in the community for\n\nsimilar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill, experience, and reputation.”\n\n\n\n7\n Under MWPCL, an award of fees, like an award of enhanced damages, is discretionary. Md. Code Lab. & Empl. §\n3-507.2(b). However, the undersigned concludes that a fee award is appropriate for the same reasons that support a\nfull award of enhanced damages. See supra Section B.2.\n\f                                              Appendix A\n\n\nCovington v. Dist. of Columbia, 57 F.3d 1101, 1109 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). To assess a proposed hourly rate, the court considers three elements: (1) the attorney’s\n\nbilling practices; (2) the attorney’s skills, experience, and reputation; and (3) the prevailing\n\nmarket rates in the relevant community. Id. at 1108. In the recent Eley decision, the D.C.\n\nCircuit observed that determining a prevailing market rate is “inherently difficult,” but\n\nnevertheless emphasized the “importance of fixing the prevailing hourly rate in each case with a\n\nfair degree of accuracy.” Eley v. Dist. of Columbia, 793 F.3d 97, 100 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (internal\n\nquotations omitted). To meet its burden to show that the requested rate is reasonable, a party\n\nmust “‘produce satisfactory evidence – in addition to the attorney’s own affidavits – that the\n\nrequested rates are in line with those prevailing in the community for similar services by lawyers\n\nof reasonably comparable skill, experience and reputation.’” Id. (quoting Blum, 465 U.S. at 895\n\nn.11).\n\n         One type of additional evidence permitted in this Circuit is attorney’s fee matrices, such\n\nas the Laffey Matrix prepared by the Civil Division of the United States Attorney’s Office for the\n\nDistrict of Columbia (“USAO Laffey Matrix”). Id. The USAO Laffey Matrix was created to\n\ndemonstrate the “prevailing rates in the community for lawyers of comparable skill, expertise\n\nand reputation in complex federal litigation.” Laffey v. Nw. Airlines, Inc., 572 F. Supp. 354,\n\n371–72 (D.D.C. 1984). The original USAO Laffey Matrix is now more than thirty years old and\n\nmust be updated to account for inflation. See Eley, 793 F.3d at 101. Competing Laffey Matrices\n\nhave developed because litigants disagree as to whether the Laffey rates should be adjusted for\n\ninflation by using the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers of the United States\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics (as is done in the USAO Laffey Matrix) or by using the Legal\n\f                                              Appendix A\n\n\nServices Index of the Bureau of Labor Statistics – known as the “LSI Laffey Matrix.” Id. The\n\nLSI Laffey rates exceed those found in the USAO Laffey Matrix. Compare https://www.justice.\n\ngov/usao-dc/file/796471/download, with http://www.laffeymatrix.com/see.html.\n\n       But while such attorney’s fee matrices can “provide a useful starting point” in calculating\n\nthe prevailing market rate, see Covington, 57 F.3d at 1109, as Eley confirms, a fee applicant does\n\nnot meet its burden merely by submitting the USAO or LSI Laffey Matrices with a fee\n\napplication. Rather, the applicant is obliged to demonstrate that the suggested rates in the matrix\n\nare “in line with those prevailing in the community for similar services.” Eley, 793 F.3d at 104\n\n(emphasis in original); id. at 100 (“‘An applicant is required to provide specific evidence of the\n\nprevailing community rate for the type of work for which he seeks an award.’”) (quoting Nat’l\n\nAss’n of Concerned Veterans v. Sec’y of Def., 675 F.2d 1319, 1325 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (emphasis\n\nin original)). Thus, in Eley, the Circuit court rejected the application of LSI Laffey rates to\n\nlitigation under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, concluding that the plaintiffs had\n\nnot come forward with sufficient evidence showing that any Laffey matrix, USAO, LSI, or\n\notherwise, was appropriate. Id. at 105. To succeed where the Eley plaintiffs failed, a fee\n\napplicant can supplement fee matrices with other evidence such as “surveys to update the[m];\n\naffidavits reciting the precise fees that attorneys with similar qualifications have received from\n\nfee-paying clients in comparable cases; and evidence of recent fees awarded by the courts or\n\nthrough settlement to attorneys with comparable qualifications handling similar cases.” Id. at\n\n101 (quoting Covington, 57 F.3d at 1109); see also id. at 104, n.5 (“Evidence of the prevailing\n\nmarket rate can take many forms.”); Covington, 57 F.3d at 1113 (Henderson, J. dissenting) (“‘A\n\nstatistically reliable, well-documented, and extensive survey of the rates clients pay for a certain\n\nsub-market of legal services would be powerfully persuasive.’”).\n\f                                              Appendix A\n\n\n       However, the Court of Appeals has clarified since the decision in Eley that a party may\n\nface a lower burden to justify the application of Laffey rates unless their opponent identifies “a\n\nsubmarket in which attorneys’ hourly fees are generally lower than the rates in . . . the Laffey\n\nMatrices.” Salazar ex rel. Salazar v. Dist. of Columbia, 809 F.3d 58, 64 (D.C. Cir. 2015). In\n\nSalazar, because the party opposing the fee award did not identify such a submarket, the D.C.\n\nCircuit concluded that it had “acquiesce[ed] in the notion that the litigation at issue qualifies as\n\ncomplex federal litigation (as to which the Laffey Matrices apply).” Id.\n\n       Additionally, the Court of Appeals found that the plaintiffs had carried their burden to\n\njustify the application of LSI Laffey rates rather than USAO Laffey rates. Id. at 65. The\n\nplaintiffs in that case submitted an affidavit from an economist, who opined that the LSI Laffey\n\nMatrix better measures the change in prices for legal services in Washington, D.C. Id. at 64.\n\nThey also submitted “billing rates tables demonstrating the difference between average national\n\nlaw firm rates and the LSI update to the Laffey Matrix, as well as the difference between average\n\nnational law firm rates and the USAO update to the Laffey Matrix.” Id. at 65. Those tables\n\nshowed that the LSI Laffey Matrix more closely approximates the average national law firm\n\nrates. Id. The Circuit court noted that rates in Washington, D.C. often far exceed even the LSI\n\nLaffey rates. Id. The Court of Appeals concluded that “[w]ith these numbers and submissions in\n\nthe record, the district court’s point that ‘the LSI-adjusted matrix is probably a conservative\n\nestimate of the actual cost of legal services in this area,’ does not appear illogical.” Id. (quoting\n\nSalazar v. Dist. of Columbia, 991 F. Supp. 2d 39, 48 (D.D.C. 2014)).\n\n       Plaintiff has been represented in this case by the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for\n\nCivil Rights and Urban Affairs (“Lawyers’ Committee”) and Relman, Dane & Colfax PLLC\n\n(“RDC”). Her request for $1,609.30 in fees is solely for work done by the Lawyers’ Committee.\n\f                                              Appendix A\n\n\nSee Memo. at 15. The Lawyers’ Committee’s billing rates are based on the rates in the LSI\n\nLaffey Matrix, which attorney Dennis Corkery, a senior staff attorney at the Lawyers’\n\nCommittee who was the primary attorney in this matter, avers is the rate the Lawyers’\n\nCommittee uses to set its customary hourly rates. Affidavit of Dennis Corkery [Dkt. 31-4] ¶ 10.\n\nThe Lawyers’ Committee has for decades represented plaintiffs in civil rights, employment, and\n\nwage and hour litigation. Id. ¶ 6.\n\n       Plaintiff seeks compensation for the time of Lawyers’ Committee attorney Corkery and\n\ntwo paralegals, Alicia Danze and Evelyn Nunez. Id. ¶¶ 11–18. Corkery graduated from George\n\nWashington University Law School in 2012 and has been in practice in the D.C. area since that\n\ntime. Id. ¶¶ 4–5. He requests a rate of $328 per hour for work he performed prior to June 1,\n\n2015 – the LSI Laffey rate for an attorney one to three years out of law school – and $406 per\n\nhour for all work performed after that date – the LSI Laffey rate for an attorney four to seven\n\nyears out of law school. Id. ¶ 11. Paralegal Danze seeks a rate of $179 per hour, which is the\n\nLSI Laffey rate applicable to her for the relevant time period. Id. ¶¶ 13–15. For paralegal\n\nNunez, Plaintiff requests a rate of $180 per hour, consistent with the LSI Laffey rate applicable\n\nto the period when Nunez worked on the case. Id. ¶¶ 16–18.\n\n       To further support the use of the LSI Laffey rates, Plaintiff offers the sworn statements of\n\nattorney Matthew Kaplan, who has a solo practice in Washington which focuses “in significant\n\npart” on FLSA litigation. Affidavit of Matthew Kaplan [Dkt. 31-5] ¶ 7. Kaplan has practiced\n\nlaw since 2003 and has over a decade of experience in FLSA matters. Id. ¶¶ 5–6. He avers that,\n\nhaving practiced alongside the Lawyers’ Committee, and attorney Corkery and paralegal Danze\n\nin particular, in prior complex FLSA cases, he believes that the requested LSI Laffey rates are\n\nreasonable. Id. ¶¶ 9–10. Finally, Plaintiff cites to several prior orders in this Circuit approving\n\f                                               Appendix A\n\n\nthe use of LSI Laffey rates. See Salazar, 809 F.3d at 64; Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in\n\nWashington v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, No. 1:11-cv-00374 (CRC), 2016 WL 554772, at *1 (D.D.C.\n\nFeb. 11, 2016); Merrick v. Dist. of Columbia, No. CV 14-1174 (ABJ), 2015 WL 5732105, at *9\n\n(D.D.C. Sept. 29, 2015).\n\n        The undersigned agrees with Plaintiff that the LSI Laffey rates are reasonable and\n\njustified in this case. First, Plaintiff’s counsel avers that the Lawyers’ Committee uses LSI\n\nLaffey rates as their customary hourly rates. Covington, 57 F.3d at 1108 (holding that one\n\nelement of a rate determination is the attorney’s billing practices). Second, the undersigned finds\n\nthat “the skill, experience, and reputation” of the Lawyers’ Committee, and its staff who worked\n\non this case in particular, are substantial. Id.\n\n        Finally, Plaintiff has established that the “prevailing market rate[s] in the relevant\n\ncommunity” are the LSI Laffey rates. Id. Unsurprisingly, given that they are in default,\n\nDefendants have not identified FLSA litigation as “a submarket in which attorneys’ hourly fees\n\nare generally lower than the rates in . . . the Laffey Matrices” and have therefore “acquiesce[ed]\n\nin the notion that the litigation at issue qualifies as complex federal litigation (as to which the\n\nLaffey Matrices apply).” Salazar, 809 F.3d at 64. With that hurdle cleared, the more difficult\n\nquestion is whether Plaintiff has justified the use of the higher LSI Laffey rate rather than the\n\nUSAO Laffey rate in this case. See id.\n\n        Plaintiff’s cited cases do not help much in this regard. Although the use of LSI Laffey\n\nrates was approved in those cases, none involved a wage claim. And this Court has recently\n\nobserved that “Courts in this District routinely award USAO Laffey rates in Fair Labor Standards\n\nAct cases.” See Martinez v. Asian 328, LLC, Case No. 15-cv-1071 (GMH), 2016 WL 1698261,\n\nat *7 (D.D.C. Apr. 27, 2016); see also Ventura, 2015 WL 6153310, at *2; Bradshaw, 2012 WL\n\f                                                     Appendix A\n\n\n2803401, at *2; Driscoll v. George Washington Univ., 55 F. Supp. 3d 106, 120 (D.D.C. 2014);\n\nAl-Quraan v. 4115 8th St. NW, LLC, 123 F. Supp. 3d 1, 3 (D.D.C. 2015). Plaintiff has not cited\n\nto any case in this District awarding LSI Laffey rates for FLSA work, and this Court can locate\n\nnone.\n\n        Yet here the undersigned need not face the difficult question of the quantum and quality\n\nof evidence needed to justify LSI Laffey rates post-Salazar. This is because D.C. law itself\n\nmandates that the Court use LSI Laffey rates. In fee awards under the DCMWA, the D.C. Code\n\nprovides:\n\n        In any judgment in favor of any employee under this section, and in any\n        proceeding to enforce such a judgment, the court shall award to each attorney for\n        the employee an additional judgment for costs, including attorney’s fees\n        computed pursuant to the matrix approved in Salazar v. District of Columbia, 123\n        F. Supp. 2d 8 (D.D.C. 2000), and updated to account for the current market hourly\n        rates for attorney’s services. The court shall use the rates in effect at the time the\n        determination is made.\n\nD.C. Code § 32-1308(b)(1). In Salazar, the district court determined that the appropriate Laffey\n\nmatrix was the LSI Matrix, not the USAO Matrix. Salazar v. Dist. of Columbia, 123 F. Supp. 2d\n\n8, 15 (D.D.C. 2000). Indeed, the judgment of the D.C. government that LSI Laffey rates are\n\nappropriate for wage claims brought in this District is persuasive evidence that such rates are the\n\nprevailing rates in the community for this work. See Makray v. Perez, Civil Action No. 12-520\n\n(BAH), 2016 WL 471271, at *16 (D.D.C. Feb. 8, 2016) (finding that section 32-1308(b)(1)\n\nrepresents “the endorsement of the [LSI] Matrix by the local governing body in the context of\n\nwage enforcement”). 8\n\n\n\n\n8\n The only reason not to adopt LSI Laffey rates in this case might be if the Court could reasonably segregate hours\nexpended on the D.C. claims, for which LSI Laffey rates are required, and the Maryland and federal claims, for\nwhich no rate is statutorily specified. The undersigned finds that with such a low number of hours claimed for a\ncase of this type, see infra at 24, segregating counsel’s time is not reasonable under the circumstances.\n\f                                              Appendix A\n\n\n       The undersigned therefore recommends that the Court find that the requested LSI Laffey\n\nrates are appropriate and reasonable in this case.\n\n                       b.      Reasonable Hours\n\n       Attorney Corkery avers that the Lawyers’ Committee expended 1.7 hours of attorney\n\ntime and 5.3 hours of paralegal time on this case. See Affidavit of Dennis Corkery [Dkt. 31-4]\n\n¶¶ 15, 18. Corkery states that he has reviewed all time diaries for work done on this matter to\n\nensure that all the time submitted is reasonable. Id. ¶¶ 3, 8. He further avers that all hours\n\nsubmitted herein were those actually worked and that all such time was contemporaneously\n\nrecorded with details as to the date, time, and activity performed. Id. ¶ 9. Corkery avers that he\n\nhas excluded from the instant request time billed by attorneys other than himself and time spent\n\non a motion for conditional class certification that was never filed. Id. ¶ 20. Plaintiff contends\n\nthat the fee request therefore reflects the exercise of “significant billing judgment, and constitutes\n\napproximately one-fifth of the total fees expended by Lawyers’ Committee staff on this matter.”\n\nSee Memo. at 16; Affidavit of Dennis Corkery [Dkt. 31-4], Attachment A. In her motion,\n\nPlaintiff further claims that her attorneys excluded all time expended by RDC attorneys and staff,\n\namounting to hundreds of hours, in developing the case, investigating its legal and factual\n\nunderpinnings for it, drafting the complaint, and preparing the instant motion. Memo. at 16.\n\n       Corkery’s affidavit and the attached timesheet, which reflect entries made\n\ncontemporaneously with the work performed, provide sufficient detail to enable the Court to\n\nindependently review the reasonableness of the hours Plaintiff claims. Nat’l Ass’n of Concerned\n\nVeterans, 675 F.2d at 1325 (a fee application “must be sufficiently detailed to permit the District\n\nCourt to make an independent determination whether or not the hours claimed are justified” and\n\nshould normally include “detailed summaries based on contemporaneous time records indicating\n\f                                             Appendix A\n\n\nthe work performed by each attorney for whom fees are sought”). Having undertaken an\n\nindependent review of the claimed hours, the undersigned finds “[t]he tasks were not duplicative,\n\nall tasks arose from this action, and the time counsel expended on each task was not excessive.”\n\nVentura v. Bebo Foods, 738 F. Supp. 2d 8, 34 (D.D.C. 2010). Accordingly, the undersigned\n\nrecommends that the Court find that the requested hours are reasonable.\n\n                       c.     Costs\n\n       Plaintiff also requests that the Court reimburse RDC for some of its litigation costs,\n\nincluding the court filing fee and the cost of serving the complaint on these two Defendants.\n\nAffidavit of Jamie Crook [Dkt. 31-3] ¶ 10. Those costs total $574.50. The undersigned finds\n\nthose costs to be reasonable and compensable. See Ventura, 738 F. Supp. 2d at 33–34 (awarding\n\nfull costs to FLSA plaintiffs); Bradshaw, 2012 WL 2803401, at *2 n.4 (including filing fee and\n\nservice of process expenses in an award of costs pursuant to the FLSA).\n\n               4.      Pre- and Post-Judgment Interest\n\n       In her complaint, Plaintiff requests an award of pre-judgment interest on all amounts\n\nowed. Compl. at 19. Yet this Court has held that pre-judgment interest is not available under the\n\nFLSA because the remedies provided therein – recovery of unpaid wages and overtime plus\n\nliquidated damages – are exclusive of any other. See Ventura, 738 F. Supp. 2d at 22–23.\n\nPlaintiff appears to acknowledge this reality in her motion, stating that she will seek an award of\n\npre-judgment interest only if “the Court declines to award liquidated damages as requested\n\nherein.” Memo. at 13 n.5 (citing Radtke, 2014 WL 3827498, at *4 (holding that pre-judgment\n\ninterest is permitted where liquidated damages are not awarded)). Plaintiff has not provided the\n\nCourt with any calculation of the pre-judgment interest she might be owed. But because the\n\f                                                Appendix A\n\n\nundersigned recommends that the Court grant Plaintiff the liquidated damages she seeks, there is\n\nlittle incentive to require Plaintiff to undertake that difficult calculation.\n\n          In contrast to pre-judgment interest, courts routinely award post-judgment interest\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1961 in FLSA cases, regardless of any liquidated damages award. See,\n\ne.g., Lopez v. Rodriguez, 668 F.2d 1376, 1381 n.10 (D.C. Cir. 1981). The undersigned therefore\n\nrecommends that the Court permit post-judgment interest to run on the judgment in this case at\n\nthe rate specified in the statute.\n\n                                           CONCLUSION\n\n          For the reasons stated above, the undersigned recommends that the Court grant in part\n\nand deny in part Plaintiff’s motion for default judgment. The undersigned further recommends\n\nthat the Court enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff in this matter in the amount of $5,628.00 in\n\nunpaid wages, overtime compensation, and liquidated damages, $1,609.30 in attorney’s fees, and\n\n$574.50 in costs. The undersigned further recommends that the Court deny an award of pre-\n\njudgment interest but direct that post-judgment interest accrue on the judgment as provided in 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1961. Finally, the undersigned recommends that the Court dismiss Plaintiff’s\n\ncollective-action claims without prejudice pursuant to her notice of voluntary dismissal.\n\n                                     *      *       *        *      *\n\n          The parties are hereby advised that failure to file timely objections to the findings and\n\nrecommendations set forth in this report may waive your right of appeal from an order of the\n\nDistrict Court adopting such findings and recommendations. See Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140\n\n(1985).\n\n\nDate: May 13, 2016                                       ___________________________________\n                                                         G.

(“Chicken-Out”),\n\nChicken Out the Door Inc. (“Chicken Out the Door”), Nicholas Cordone, Richard\n\nHindin, and Joseph Marinucci failed to pay her overtime and other wages that were due\n\nto her under the Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”) and D.C. and Maryland wage laws.\n\nPlaintiff has since voluntarily dismissed her claims against defendants Cordone, Hindin,\n\nand Marinucci. (See Mot. to Dismiss Claims Against Defs. Nicholas Cordone, Joseph\n\nMarinucci, & Richard Hindin Without Prejudice (“Mot. to Dismiss”), ECF No. 28;\n\nMinute Order of Jan. 12, 2016 Granting Mot. to Dismiss.) 1\n\n        Plaintiff served the complaint on Chicken Out the Door on April 1, 2015, and\n\nlater served Chicken-Out on May 5, 2015. (See Return of Service/Affidavit, ECF No.\n\n10; Return of Service/Affidavit, ECF No. 17.) On May 11, 2015, the Clerk of Court\n\n\n\n1\n  Plaintiff initially pled collective and class action claims for violations of the various wage statutes at\nissue, but has since voluntarily dismissed those claims as well. (See Notice of Voluntary Dismissal of\nClass & Collective Action Claims Pursuant to FRCP 41(a)(1)(A)(i), ECF No. 30.)\n\ffiled an entry of default against Chicken Out the Door, noting that that defendant had\n\nfailed to respond to the complaint or otherwise defend itself in this litigation. (See\n\nEntry of Default, ECF No. 14.) The Clerk of Court similarly filed an entry of default\n\nagainst Chicken-Out on June 29, 2015. (See Entry of Default, ECF No. 20.) Plaintiff\n\nmoved for default judgment with respect to her claims against Chicken Out the Door\n\nand Chicken-Out on February 24, 2016 (see ECF No. 31), and on April 12, 2016, this\n\nCourt referred Plaintiff’s motion for default judgment to a Magistrate Judge for a report\n\nand recommendation (see Minute Order of April 12, 2016). 2\n\n       The assigned Magistrate Judge, G. Michael Harvey, issued a Report and\n\nRecommendation regarding Plaintiffs’ motion on May 13, 2016 (R &R, ECF No. 12,\n\nattached hereto as Appendix A), which reflects his belief that Plaintiff’s motion for\n\ndefault judgment should be granted in part and denied in part. (R & R. at 1.)\n\nSpecifically, Magistrate Judge Harvey found that Chicken Out the Door and Chicken-\n\nOut “willfully violated the FLSA, DCMWA, MWHL, and MWPCL when they failed to\n\npay Plaintiff overtime compensation and failed to pay her for her last two-and-a-half\n\nweeks of work[,]” (id. at 10), and that Plaintiff is entitled to the full amount of unpaid\n\nwages, overtime compensation, liquidated damages, attorney’s fees, and costs that she\n\nrequests in her motion, as well as post-judgment interest (id. at 10–25). Magistrate\n\nJudge Harvey recommended that this Court deny Plaintiff’s request for prejudgment\n\ninterest under the FLSA because that statute delineates the exclusive remedies for any\n\nviolations—specifically, unpaid wages, unpaid overtime, and liquidated damages—and\n\n\n\n\n2\n Chicken Out the Door and Chicken-Out have not responded to the motion for default judgment, or\notherwise appeared in this action.\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fthe Report and Recommendation recommends that this Court award those remedies.\n\n(Id. at 25–26.)\n\n        Magistrate Judge Harvey’s Report and Recommendation also specifically advised\n\nthe parties that failure to file timely objections may result in waiver of further review of\n\nthe matters addressed in the Report and Recommendation. (Id. at 26.) Under this\n\nCourt’s local rules, any party who objects to a Report and Recommendation must file a\n\nwritten objection with the Clerk of the Court within 14 days of the party’s receipt of the\n\nReport and Recommendation. LCvR 72.3(b).\n\n        As of the current date—more than two months after the Report and\n\nRecommendation was issued—no objections have been filed. Moreover, this Court has\n\nreviewed Magistrate Judge Harvey’s Report and Recommendation, and it agrees with\n\nthe report’s analysis and conclusions. Therefore, as set forth in the separate order that\n\naccompanies this Memorandum Opinion, the Report and Recommendation of the\n\nMagistrate Judge entered in this matter on May 13, 2016, is ADOPTED in its entirety.\n\nAccordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion for Default Judgment is GRANTED in part and\n\nDENIED in part, and JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF PLAINTIFF in\n\nthe amount of $5,628.00 in unpaid wages, overtime compensation, and liquidated\n\ndamages; $1,609.30 in attorney’s fees; and $574.50 in costs, plus post-judgment interest\n\nas provided in 28 U.S.C. § 1961. 3\n\n\nDATE: July 22, 2016                                      Ketanji Brown Jackson\n                                                         KETANJI BROWN JACKSON\n                                                         United States District Judge\n\n\n3\n Plaintiff’s collective action claims are dismissed pursuant to her notice of voluntary dismissal (see\nsupra n. 1); therefore, no separate order dismissing these claims is required.

Defendants Chicken-Out, Inc. and Chicken Out the\n\nDoor, Inc. employed Plaintiff in their fast-food restaurants. They did not pay her overtime and\n\nother wages she was due under the Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”) and D.C. and Maryland\n\nlaw. As a result, she brought the instant suit. Defendants failed to appear, forcing Plaintiff to\n\nseek a default judgment against them. After reviewing the entire record, 1 the undersigned\n\nrecommends that the Court grant in part and deny in part Plaintiff’s motion.\n\n                                             BACKGROUND\n\n        Defendants operated fast-food chicken restaurants in the District of Columbia, Maryland,\n\nand Virginia. Compl. ¶ 23. Plaintiff initially worked at one of Defendants’ D.C. locations as a\n\nsalad and sandwich maker and as a cashier. Id. ¶ 37. She worked at this restaurant beginning in\n\nthe summer of 2010. Id. She was paid a wage of $9.00 per hour. Id. She regularly worked\n\n\n\n1\n  The relevant docket entries for purposes of this Report and Recommendation are: (1) Plaintiff’s Complaint\n(“Compl.”) [Dkt. 1]; (2) Plaintiff’s Motion for Default Judgment as to Defendants Chicken-Out and Chicken Out the\nDoor (“Mot.”) [Dkt. 31]; and (3) Plaintiff’s Corrected Memorandum in Support of Plaintiff’s Motion for Default\nJudgment (“Memo.”) [Dkt. 32-1].\n\f                                                     Appendix A\n\n\nforty-two hours per week but was never paid overtime wages. Id. ¶ 38. The D.C. restaurant\n\nwhere she worked closed in October 2013, at which time Plaintiff’s employment ceased. Id. ¶\n\n41.\n\n         Approximately five weeks later, Defendants asked Plaintiff to work in the same capacity\n\nat one of their Rockville, Maryland locations. Id. ¶ 42. She worked at the Maryland restaurant\n\nfrom late November 2013 through May 15, 2014, when that restaurant too closed. Id. ¶¶ 43, 48.\n\nFor the period from her start at the Rockville restaurant through March 2014, Plaintiff again\n\nconsistently worked forty-six hours per week but was never paid overtime wages. Id.\n\nDefendants justified this failure by telling Plaintiff that they did not pay overtime and that “she\n\nshould be grateful for the extra hours of work.” Id. ¶ 46. For the period from April 2014 to the\n\nrestaurant’s closure, Plaintiff did not work any overtime. Id. ¶ 48. However, she claims that she\n\nwas never paid at all for her work from April 28, 2014, to May 15, 2014. Id. ¶ 49. After the\n\nRockville location closed, Defendants asked Plaintiff to work at their restaurant in McLean,\n\nVirginia. Id. ¶ 50. Because she had not been paid for her two-and-a-half weeks of work, she\n\nrefused. Id.\n\n         In this suit, Plaintiff claims that Defendants’ failure to pay her overtime wages violated\n\nthe FLSA, 29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq., the D.C. Minimum Wage Act Revision Act (“DCMWA”),\n\nD.C. Code § 32-1001 et seq., and the Maryland Wage and Hour Law (“MWHL”), Md. Code\n\nLab. & Empl. § 401 et seq. Compl. ¶¶ 75–93. She further claims that Defendants’ failure to pay\n\nher at all for her last two-and-a-half weeks of work at the Rockville restaurant violated the\n\nMaryland Wage Payment and Collection Law (“MWPCL”), 2 Md. Code Lab. & Empl. § 3-501 et\n\n\n\n2\n Plaintiff refers to this statute as the “Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Act” in her complaint, but the statute\nprovides that its short title should be the “Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Law.” Md. Code Lab. & Empl. §\n3-509.\n\f                                                       Appendix A\n\n\nseq. Compl. ¶¶ 94–99. As relief, Plaintiff requests that the Court award her: (1) the unpaid\n\nwages and overtime compensation which she is owed, plus an additional amount as liquidated\n\ndamages; (2) prejudgment interest on all amounts owed; and (3) her reasonable costs and\n\nattorney’s fees incurred in this action. Compl. at 18–20.\n\n         Plaintiff originally brought these claims against three additional defendants – individuals\n\nwhom Plaintiff alleged were owners or managers of the two corporate defendants. See id. ¶¶ 17–\n\n19. On Plaintiff’s motion, those three defendants have been dismissed from this case. See Jan.\n\n13, 2016 Minute Order. Plaintiff also originally brought her claims under the FLSA, the\n\nDCMWA, and the MWHL on her own behalf and on behalf of those similarly situated – known\n\nin the wage-law world as a “collective action” – she has requested that those claims be\n\nvoluntarily dismissed. See Notice of Voluntary Dismissal of Class and Collective Action Claims\n\n[Dkt. 30].3\n\n         The instant motion seeks a default judgment against the remaining two defendants –\n\nChicken-Out, Inc. and Chicken Out the Door, Inc. Mot. at 1. The Clerk of the Court entered\n\ndefault against Chicken Out the Door on May 11, 2015, and against Chicken-Out on June 29,\n\n2015. See Clerk’s Entry of Default as to Chicken Out the Door, Inc. [Dkt. 14]; Clerk’s Entry of\n\nDefault as to Chicken-Out, Inc. [Dkt. 20]. Because Defendants have not appeared, as a matter of\n\ncourse no response to Plaintiff’s motion has been filed.\n\n\n\n3\n  Although the Court referred this matter to the undersigned solely for resolution of Plaintiff’s motion for default\njudgment, see Apr. 12, 2016 Minute Order, Plaintiff does devote some argument to the propriety of voluntary\ndismissal of her collective-action claims. See Memo. at 5. Because Defendants have not answered or otherwise\nresponded to Plaintiff’s complaint, and because Plaintiff’s proposed class has not yet been certified, Rule\n41(a)(1)(A)(i) compels the Court to dismiss these claims. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(A)(i) (“Subject to Rules\n23(e), 23.1(c), 23.2, and 66 and any applicable federal statute, the plaintiff may dismiss an action without a court\norder by filing[] a notice of dismissal before the opposing party serves either an answer or a motion for summary\njudgment[.]”); see also id. 23(e) (setting procedures for voluntary dismissal of the claims of a class once certified).\nAccordingly, the undersigned recommends that the Court dismiss Plaintiff’s collective-action claims without\nprejudice.\n\f                                              Appendix A\n\n\n                                      LEGAL STANDARDS\n\n       A.

Second, the plaintiff must move for entry of a default\n\njudgment. Id. 55(b).

Federal, D.C., and Maryland Wage and Hour Laws\n\n       The FLSA, DCMWA, and MWHL all require employers to pay their workers a minimum\n\nwage and, if the employee works more than forty hours in a workweek, overtime compensation\n\nat the rate of one-and-a-half times the employee’s regular hourly rate. 29 U.S.C. § 207(a)(1);\n\nD.C. Code § 32-1003(c); Md. Code Lab. & Empl. §§ 3-415, 3-420. Similarly, the MWPCL\n\nprovides that upon cessation of employment, an employer must pay “all wages due for work that\n\nthe employee performed before the termination of employment, on or before the day on which\n\nthe employee would have been paid the wages if the employment had not been terminated.” Md.\n\nCode Lab. & Empl. § 3-505(a).\n\n       It is a long-standing principle in wage law that where an employer fails to produce\n\nrecords of the employee’s hours and wages, the employee can meet her burden of proof by\n\n“produc[ing] sufficient evidence to show the amount and extent of that work as a matter of just\n\nand reasonable inference.” Andersen v.

In addition to recovering\n\nunpaid compensation, the FLSA provides that an employer “shall be liable to the employee . . .\n\nin an additional equal amount as liquidated damages.” 29 U.S.C. § 216(b). An employer may\n\navoid the liquidated damages penalty only if it “shows to the satisfaction of the court that the act\n\nor omission giving rise to such action was in good faith and that he had reasonable grounds for\n\nbelieving” that the failure to pay “was not in violation of the [FLSA].” Id. § 260.\n\n        The DCMWA has a three-year limitations period.

By defaulting, Defendants have admitted all well-\n\npleaded allegations in Plaintiff’s complaint. Boland, 763 F. Supp. 2d at 67. Those allegations\n\nestablish that Defendants violated the FLSA, the DCMWA, and the MWHL when they failed to\n\npay Plaintiff overtime compensation and that Defendants violated the MWPCL when they failed\n\nto pay Plaintiff anything for her last two-and-a-half weeks of work at their Rockville location.\n\n        As a threshold matter, Plaintiff’s allegations make clear that Defendants managed the\n\nrestaurants where she worked and that they controlled employment policies at those restaurants,\n\nincluding pay rates and overtime compensation policies.

Although Plaintiff does not come forward with exact records of her hours\n\nworked and wages paid, Andersen holds that she is not required to do so. Andersen, 328 U.S. at\n\n687. Instead, her allegations and averments supply the necessary evidence to support her claim.\n\nSee Pleitez, 594 F. Supp. 2d at 49.\n\n       Plaintiff avers that at Defendants’ D.C. location, she regularly worked more than 40\n\nhours per week and averaged at least 42 hours per week. Affidavit of Maria Serrano [Dkt. 31-2]\n\n¶ 4. Similarly, at Defendants’ Maryland location, she regularly exceeded 40-hour workweeks\n\nand averaged at least 46 hours per week. Id. ¶ 5. To her affidavit are appended several paystubs\n\nwhich she avers are representative of the hours she worked and wages she received while\n\nworking for Defendants. Id. ¶ 6. Those paystubs cover pay periods in March, April, and May\n\n2014. Id. at 7–9. While the time period encompassed in the paystubs is limited, they do reveal\n\f                                             Appendix A\n\n\nthat Plaintiff was not paid overtime compensation. For instance, the first pay stub, dated April 4,\n\n2014, shows that Plaintiff worked 89.82 hours during the relevant pay period but was only paid\n\n$808.38. Id. at 7. That amount is the product of Plaintiff’s regular wage, $9.00, multiplied by\n\nthe number of hours she worked. Missing from her wages are $44.19 in overtime wages, which\n\nis the product of her overtime hours – 9.82 – and the additional $4.50 per hour to which she was\n\nentitled.\n\n        Plaintiff further avers that Defendants knowingly violated their duty to pay overtime\n\ncompensation. She states that Defendants knew of their obligation to pay overtime and yet\n\nrefused to pay. Id. ¶ 8. Indeed, upon asking one of her managers why she was not being paid for\n\novertime work, she was told that the company did not pay overtime and that “she should be\n\ngrateful to the company for giving [her] extra hours.” Id. ¶ 9. As for Defendants’ complete non-\n\npayment for Plaintiff’s final two-and-a-half weeks of work at their Rockville location, Plaintiff\n\navers she worked 34 hours during that period but has never been paid for that time. Id. ¶ 11.\n\nWhen she asked about those final hours of work, her managers stated that “they did not know\n\nanything about it.” Id. ¶ 12.\n\n        These sworn statements establish that, despite the clear overtime requirements in the\n\nFLSA, DCMWA, and MWHL, Defendants refused to pay Plaintiff overtime compensation.\n\nAdditionally, Defendants violated the MWPCL by failing to pay Plaintiff for her work during the\n\nperiod from April 28, 2014, through May 15, 2014, when the Rockville restaurant closed.\n\nDefendants never paid her for this work even after Plaintiff gave them notice that they had failed\n\nto pay her.

Amount of Judgment\n\n         Having determined that Defendants willfully violated the FLSA, DCMWA, MWHL, and\n\nMWPCL when they failed to pay Plaintiff overtime compensation and failed to pay her for her\n\nlast two-and-a-half weeks of work, the appropriate measure of Plaintiff’s recovery must next be\n\ndetermined. Plaintiff seeks: (1) her unpaid wages and overtime compensation; (2) liquidated\n\ndamages; (3) prejudgment interest; and (4) her reasonable costs and attorney’s fees.

For the period from February 24, 2012, through mid-October 2013,\n\nPlaintiff worked at the D.C. location and regularly worked 42 hours per week. As a result, she\n\nestimates that she is owed 2 hours of overtime compensation for each week she worked.\n\nBecause her regular hourly rate was always $9.00, this means that she is owed an additional\n\n$9.00 – $4.50 times 2 hours – for each week of work at the D.C. restaurant. See Affidavit of\n\nJamie Crook [Dkt. 31-3] ¶ 5(c). $9.00 per week multiplied by 86 – the number of weeks she\n\nworked in D.C. – comes to $774.00 in unpaid overtime. Plaintiff seeks unpaid overtime for her\n\nwork at the Rockville restaurant from late November 2013 through April 27, 2014. She\n\nregularly worked 46 hours per week during this period, thus leaving 6 hours of uncompensated\n\novertime per week. See id. ¶ 5(d). At an hourly rate of $9.00, she is owed an extra $27.00 per\n\nweek for these 22 weeks of work. $27.00 per week multiplied by 22 weeks totals $594.00.\n\f                                              Appendix A\n\n\n       Plaintiff also seeks to recover her unpaid wages for the period from April 28, 2014,\n\nthrough May 15, 2014 – the last two-and-a-half weeks she worked for Defendants. Memo. at 14.\n\nShe worked 34 hours per week during this period. Id. Having never been paid for any of those\n\nhours, Plaintiff is owed her hourly wage of $9.00 per hour multiplied by 2.5 weeks of 34-hour\n\ndays, resulting in $765.00 in unpaid wages. See Affidavit of Jamie Crook [Dkt. 31-3] ¶ 6.\n\n                2.     Liquidated Damages\n\n       For her unpaid overtime at the D.C. restaurant, Plaintiff also requests that the Court\n\naward an equal amount as liquidated damages under the FLSA and the DCMWA. Doubling her\n\nunpaid overtime at the D.C. location equals $1,548.00. For the Rockville restaurant, Plaintiff\n\nseeks an additional amount equal to two times her unpaid overtime under the MWPCL’s treble\n\ndamages provision. That makes the total amount sought for her work in Maryland $1,782.00.\n\nFinally, for Defendants’ failure to pay her for her last two-and-a-half weeks of work, Plaintiff\n\nagain requests trebled damages under the MWPCL, raising the total request for these final weeks\n\nto $2,295.00.\n\n       Plaintiff is entitled to the liquidated damages she requests. Upon recovery under the\n\nFLSA for unpaid wages, the statute mandates that the court award liquidated damages in an\n\namount equal to the unpaid wages. See 29 U.S.C. § 216(b). The pre-2015 DCMWA gives\n\ndiscretion to the court, requiring that it award “an additional amount as liquidated damages”\n\nwithout specifying the amount to award. See D.C. Code § 32-1012 (1993). Both statutes have a\n\nbuilt-in escape hatch for a defendant employer. If the employer can prove that it acted in good\n\nfaith or reasonably believed that its failure to pay compensation was not a violation of the statute,\n\nthe court may, in its discretion, award no liquidated damages at all or some amount less than the\n\nfull amount authorized in the statute. See 29 U.S.C. § 260; D.C. Code § 32-1012 (1993).\n\f                                                    Appendix A\n\n\nHowever, Defendants’ default means that they cannot meet their burden to prove up this good-\n\nfaith affirmative defense.

As a result, Plaintiff is\n\nentitled to a doubling of her unpaid wages for her work in D.C. under the FLSA. 5\n\n        The analytic structure governing damages for the MWHL and MWPCL is slightly\n\ndifferent, but the result is the same. Plaintiff has elected to proceed on her claim for violation of\n\nthe MWHL pursuant to the MWPCL, which she is entitled to do. See Peters, 97 A.3d at 625.\n\nThe MWPCL, like the DCMWA, gives the court discretion to award “an amount not exceeding 3\n\ntimes the wage” if it finds that the employer’s failure to pay required overtime compensation was\n\n“not as a result of a bona fide dispute.” Md. Code Lab. & Empl. § 3-507.2. Yet unlike the\n\nFLSA and DCMWA, the MWPCL allows a court to award up to treble damages “in lieu of a flat\n\npayment of unpaid wages.” See Imgarten v.

Id. at 627–28. Yet because of the permissive language in\n\nMWPCL (distinct from the mandatory language in the FLSA), “an employee is not\n\npresumptively entitled to enhanced damages, even if the court finds that wages were withheld\n\nwithout a bona fide dispute.” Id. at 662.

Id.\n\n       Some other Maryland district courts have established a third consideration for awarding\n\nenhanced damages – whether the plaintiff has proved any consequential damages resulting from\n\nthe failure to pay wages.

This is primarily because Defendants have not appeared, but the evidence\n\nbefore the undersigned indicates that Defendants could not come up with viable reasons even if\n\nthey had appeared. Defendants, after being notified of their failure to pay Plaintiff overtime,\n\nstated that the company did not pay overtime and that “she should be grateful to the company for\n\ngiving [her] extra hours.” Affidavit of Maria Serrano [Dkt. 31-2] ¶ 9. When confronted about\n\ntheir failure to pay Plaintiff for her last two-and-a-half weeks of work, Defendants merely stated\n\nthat “they did not know anything about it.” Id. ¶ 12. These statements, if they could be\n\f                                                   Appendix A\n\n\ngenerously described as excuses for nonpayment, are not persuasive. There is no suggestion here\n\nthat Plaintiff was anything other than an ordinary, hourly wage employee who was not exempt\n\nfrom the protections of minimum wage and overtime laws. See Compl. ¶ 64. Thus, the Court\n\nhas no evidence that Defendants held any incorrect but forgivable belief, legal or factual,\n\nregarding Plaintiff’s right to payment. See Peters, 97 A.3d at 657, 660 n.12. Defendants\n\ntherefore lack any bona fide dispute that might forestall an award of enhanced damages.\n\n        Considering the remedial purposes of the MWPCL and the total lack of any credible\n\ndefense to Plaintiff’s claim, the undersigned recommends that the Court award Plaintiff trebled\n\ndamages on these claims. Although Plaintiff does not allege any consequential damages\n\nresulting from Defendants’ violations of the MWPCL, the undersigned recommends that the\n\nCourt reject that factor as a requirement for a full award of enhanced damages. In Lopez, where\n\nthis factor originated, the court cited no authority for the proposition that consequential damages\n\nare a relevant consideration in awarding enhanced damages. See Lopez, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2227353</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at\n\n*3. Moreover, in its most recent pronouncement on the subject, the Maryland Court of Appeals\n\ndid not raise the existence of consequential harm as an element for the court’s consideration. See\n\nPeters, 97 A.3d at 663. Thus, the undersigned does not find that a lack of consequential damages\n\nmilitates in favor of merely doubled, rather than trebled, damages. 6\n\n          Accordingly, the undersigned recommends that the Court award Plaintiff all the\n\nliquidated and enhanced damages she requests.\n\n\n\n\n6\n  As with the FLSA-DCMWA interaction, see supra note 5, here Plaintiff does not seek liquidated damages under\nthe FLSA and a separate award under the MWPCL. See Memo. at 14. This is proper, since Plaintiff is “entitled to\nrecover liquidated damages under the FLSA or treble damages under the Maryland Wage Payment and Collection\nLaw, but not both.” Quiroz v.

Reasonable Rate\n\n        Rates are reasonable if they are “in line with those prevailing in the community for\n\nsimilar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill, experience, and reputation.”\n\n\n\n7\n Under MWPCL, an award of fees, like an award of enhanced damages, is discretionary. Md. Code Lab. & Empl. §\n3-507.2(b). However, the undersigned concludes that a fee award is appropriate for the same reasons that support a\nfull award of enhanced damages. See supra Section B.2.\n\f                                              Appendix A\n\n\nCovington v.

Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). To assess a proposed hourly rate, the court considers three elements: (1) the attorney’s\n\nbilling practices; (2) the attorney’s skills, experience, and reputation; and (3) the prevailing\n\nmarket rates in the relevant community. Id. at 1108. In the recent Eley decision, the D.C.\n\nCircuit observed that determining a prevailing market rate is “inherently difficult,” but\n\nnevertheless emphasized the “importance of fixing the prevailing hourly rate in each case with a\n\nfair degree of accuracy.” Eley v. Dist. of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">793</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 100 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (internal\n\nquotations omitted). To meet its burden to show that the requested rate is reasonable, a party\n\nmust “‘produce satisfactory evidence – in addition to the attorney’s own affidavits – that the\n\nrequested rates are in line with those prevailing in the community for similar services by lawyers\n\nof reasonably comparable skill, experience and reputation.’” Id. (quoting Blum, 465 U.S. at 895\n\nn.11).\n\n         One type of additional evidence permitted in this Circuit is attorney’s fee matrices, such\n\nas the Laffey Matrix prepared by the Civil Division of the United States Attorney’s Office for the\n\nDistrict of Columbia (“USAO Laffey Matrix”). Id. The USAO Laffey Matrix was created to\n\ndemonstrate the “prevailing rates in the community for lawyers of comparable skill, expertise\n\nand reputation in complex federal litigation.” Laffey v. Nw. Airlines, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">354</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n371–72 (D.D.C. 1984). The original USAO Laffey Matrix is now more than thirty years old and\n\nmust be updated to account for inflation. See Eley, 793 F.3d at 101. Competing Laffey Matrices\n\nhave developed because litigants disagree as to whether the Laffey rates should be adjusted for\n\ninflation by using the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers of the United States\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics (as is done in the USAO Laffey Matrix) or by using the Legal\n\f                                              Appendix A\n\n\nServices Index of the Bureau of Labor Statistics – known as the “LSI Laffey Matrix.” Id. The\n\nLSI Laffey rates exceed those found in the USAO Laffey Matrix. Compare https://www.justice.\n\ngov/usao-dc/file/796471/download, with http://www.laffeymatrix.com/see.html.\n\n       But while such attorney’s fee matrices can “provide a useful starting point” in calculating\n\nthe prevailing market rate, see Covington, 57 F.3d at 1109, as Eley confirms, a fee applicant does\n\nnot meet its burden merely by submitting the USAO or LSI Laffey Matrices with a fee\n\napplication. Rather, the applicant is obliged to demonstrate that the suggested rates in the matrix\n\nare “in line with those prevailing in the community for similar services.” Eley, 793 F.3d at 104\n\n(emphasis in original); id. at 100 (“‘An applicant is required to provide specific evidence of the\n\nprevailing community rate for the type of work for which he seeks an award.’”) (quoting Nat’l\n\nAss’n of Concerned Veterans v. Sec’y of Def., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"402468\"><a href=\"/opinion/402468/national-association-of-concerned-veterans-appelleescross-appellants-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">675</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1319</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1325 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (emphasis\n\nin original)). Thus, in Eley, the Circuit court rejected the application of LSI Laffey rates to\n\nlitigation under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, concluding that the plaintiffs had\n\nnot come forward with sufficient evidence showing that any Laffey matrix, USAO, LSI, or\n\notherwise, was appropriate. Id. at 105. To succeed where the Eley plaintiffs failed, a fee\n\napplicant can supplement fee matrices with other evidence such as “surveys to update the[m];\n\naffidavits reciting the precise fees that attorneys with similar qualifications have received from\n\nfee-paying clients in comparable cases; and evidence of recent fees awarded by the courts or\n\nthrough settlement to attorneys with comparable qualifications handling similar cases.” Id. at\n\n101 (quoting Covington, 57 F.3d at 1109); see also id. at 104, n.5 (“Evidence of the prevailing\n\nmarket rate can take many forms.”); Covington, 57 F.3d at 1113 (Henderson, J. dissenting) (“‘A\n\nstatistically reliable, well-documented, and extensive survey of the rates clients pay for a certain\n\nsub-market of legal services would be powerfully persuasive.’”).\n\f                                              Appendix A\n\n\n       However, the Court of Appeals has clarified since the decision in Eley that a party may\n\nface a lower burden to justify the application of Laffey rates unless their opponent identifies “a\n\nsubmarket in which attorneys’ hourly fees are generally lower than the rates in . . . the Laffey\n\nMatrices.” Salazar ex rel. Salazar v. Dist. of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 64 (D.C. Cir. 2015). In\n\nSalazar, because the party opposing the fee award did not identify such a submarket, the D.C.\n\nCircuit concluded that it had “acquiesce[ed] in the notion that the litigation at issue qualifies as\n\ncomplex federal litigation (as to which the Laffey Matrices apply).” Id.\n\n       Additionally, the Court of Appeals found that the plaintiffs had carried their burden to\n\njustify the application of LSI Laffey rates rather than USAO Laffey rates. Id. at 65. The\n\nplaintiffs in that case submitted an affidavit from an economist, who opined that the LSI Laffey\n\nMatrix better measures the change in prices for legal services in Washington, D.C. Id. at 64.\n\nThey also submitted “billing rates tables demonstrating the difference between average national\n\nlaw firm rates and the LSI update to the Laffey Matrix, as well as the difference between average\n\nnational law firm rates and the USAO update to the Laffey Matrix.” Id. at 65. Those tables\n\nshowed that the LSI Laffey Matrix more closely approximates the average national law firm\n\nrates. Id. The Circuit court noted that rates in Washington, D.C. often far exceed even the LSI\n\nLaffey rates. Id. The Court of Appeals concluded that “[w]ith these numbers and submissions in\n\nthe record, the district court’s point that ‘the LSI-adjusted matrix is probably a conservative\n\nestimate of the actual cost of legal services in this area,’ does not appear illogical.” Id. (quoting\n\nSalazar v. Dist. of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 48 (D.D.C. 2014)).\n\n       Plaintiff has been represented in this case by the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for\n\nCivil Rights and Urban Affairs (“Lawyers’ Committee”) and Relman, Dane & Colfax PLLC\n\n(“RDC”). Her request for $1,609.30 in fees is solely for work done by the Lawyers’ Committee.\n\f                                              Appendix A\n\n\nSee Memo. at 15. The Lawyers’ Committee’s billing rates are based on the rates in the LSI\n\nLaffey Matrix, which attorney Dennis Corkery, a senior staff attorney at the Lawyers’\n\nCommittee who was the primary attorney in this matter, avers is the rate the Lawyers’\n\nCommittee uses to set its customary hourly rates. Affidavit of Dennis Corkery [Dkt. 31-4] ¶ 10.\n\nThe Lawyers’ Committee has for decades represented plaintiffs in civil rights, employment, and\n\nwage and hour litigation. Id. ¶ 6.\n\n       Plaintiff seeks compensation for the time of Lawyers’ Committee attorney Corkery and\n\ntwo paralegals, Alicia Danze and Evelyn Nunez. Id. ¶¶ 11–18. Corkery graduated from George\n\nWashington University Law School in 2012 and has been in practice in the D.C. area since that\n\ntime. Id. ¶¶ 4–5. He requests a rate of $328 per hour for work he performed prior to June 1,\n\n2015 – the LSI Laffey rate for an attorney one to three years out of law school – and $406 per\n\nhour for all work performed after that date – the LSI Laffey rate for an attorney four to seven\n\nyears out of law school. Id. ¶ 11. Paralegal Danze seeks a rate of $179 per hour, which is the\n\nLSI Laffey rate applicable to her for the relevant time period. Id. ¶¶ 13–15. For paralegal\n\nNunez, Plaintiff requests a rate of $180 per hour, consistent with the LSI Laffey rate applicable\n\nto the period when Nunez worked on the case. Id. ¶¶ 16–18.\n\n       To further support the use of the LSI Laffey rates, Plaintiff offers the sworn statements of\n\nattorney Matthew Kaplan, who has a solo practice in Washington which focuses “in significant\n\npart” on FLSA litigation. Affidavit of Matthew Kaplan [Dkt. 31-5] ¶ 7. Kaplan has practiced\n\nlaw since 2003 and has over a decade of experience in FLSA matters. Id. ¶¶ 5–6. He avers that,\n\nhaving practiced alongside the Lawyers’ Committee, and attorney Corkery and paralegal Danze\n\nin particular, in prior complex FLSA cases, he believes that the requested LSI Laffey rates are\n\nreasonable. Id. ¶¶ 9–10. Finally, Plaintiff cites to several prior orders in this Circuit approving\n\f                                               Appendix A\n\n\nthe use of LSI Laffey rates. See Salazar, 809 F.3d at 64; Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in\n\nWashington v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, No. 1:11-cv-00374 (CRC), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">554772</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1 (D.D.C.\n\nFeb. 11, 2016); Merrick v.

Sept. 29, 2015).\n\n        The undersigned agrees with Plaintiff that the LSI Laffey rates are reasonable and\n\njustified in this case. First, Plaintiff’s counsel avers that the Lawyers’ Committee uses LSI\n\nLaffey rates as their customary hourly rates. Covington, 57 F.3d at 1108 (holding that one\n\nelement of a rate determination is the attorney’s billing practices). Second, the undersigned finds\n\nthat “the skill, experience, and reputation” of the Lawyers’ Committee, and its staff who worked\n\non this case in particular, are substantial. Id.\n\n        Finally, Plaintiff has established that the “prevailing market rate[s] in the relevant\n\ncommunity” are the LSI Laffey rates. Id. Unsurprisingly, given that they are in default,\n\nDefendants have not identified FLSA litigation as “a submarket in which attorneys’ hourly fees\n\nare generally lower than the rates in . . . the Laffey Matrices” and have therefore “acquiesce[ed]\n\nin the notion that the litigation at issue qualifies as complex federal litigation (as to which the\n\nLaffey Matrices apply).” Salazar, 809 F.3d at 64. With that hurdle cleared, the more difficult\n\nquestion is whether Plaintiff has justified the use of the higher LSI Laffey rate rather than the\n\nUSAO Laffey rate in this case. See id.\n\n        Plaintiff’s cited cases do not help much in this regard. Although the use of LSI Laffey\n\nrates was approved in those cases, none involved a wage claim. And this Court has recently\n\nobserved that “Courts in this District routinely award USAO Laffey rates in Fair Labor Standards\n\nAct cases.” See Martinez v. Asian 328, LLC, Case No. 15-cv-1071 (GMH), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1698261</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\nat *7 (D.D.C.

Plaintiff has not cited\n\nto any case in this District awarding LSI Laffey rates for FLSA work, and this Court can locate\n\nnone.\n\n        Yet here the undersigned need not face the difficult question of the quantum and quality\n\nof evidence needed to justify LSI Laffey rates post-Salazar. This is because D.C. law itself\n\nmandates that the Court use LSI Laffey rates. In fee awards under the DCMWA, the D.C. Code\n\nprovides:\n\n        In any judgment in favor of any employee under this section, and in any\n        proceeding to enforce such a judgment, the court shall award to each attorney for\n        the employee an additional judgment for costs, including attorney’s fees\n        computed pursuant to the matrix approved in Salazar v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2479794\"><a href=\"/opinion/2479794/salazar-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span>\n        <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The court shall use the rates in effect at the time the\n        determination is made.\n\nD.C. Code § 32-1308(b)(1). In Salazar, the district court determined that the appropriate Laffey\n\nmatrix was the LSI Matrix, not the USAO Matrix. Salazar v.

Indeed, the judgment of the D.C. government that LSI Laffey rates are\n\nappropriate for wage claims brought in this District is persuasive evidence that such rates are the\n\nprevailing rates in the community for this work. See Makray v. Perez, Civil Action No. 12-520\n\n(BAH), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">471271</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *16 (D.D.C. Feb. 8, 2016) (finding that section 32-1308(b)(1)\n\nrepresents “the endorsement of the [LSI] Matrix by the local governing body in the context of\n\nwage enforcement”). 8\n\n\n\n\n8\n The only reason not to adopt LSI Laffey rates in this case might be if the Court could reasonably segregate hours\nexpended on the D.C. claims, for which LSI Laffey rates are required, and the Maryland and federal claims, for\nwhich no rate is statutorily specified. The undersigned finds that with such a low number of hours claimed for a\ncase of this type, see infra at 24, segregating counsel’s time is not reasonable under the circumstances.\n\f                                              Appendix A\n\n\n       The undersigned therefore recommends that the Court find that the requested LSI Laffey\n\nrates are appropriate and reasonable in this case.\n\n                       b.      Reasonable Hours\n\n       Attorney Corkery avers that the Lawyers’ Committee expended 1.7 hours of attorney\n\ntime and 5.3 hours of paralegal time on this case. See Affidavit of Dennis Corkery [Dkt. 31-4]\n\n¶¶ 15, 18. Corkery states that he has reviewed all time diaries for work done on this matter to\n\nensure that all the time submitted is reasonable. Id. ¶¶ 3, 8. He further avers that all hours\n\nsubmitted herein were those actually worked and that all such time was contemporaneously\n\nrecorded with details as to the date, time, and activity performed. Id. ¶ 9. Corkery avers that he\n\nhas excluded from the instant request time billed by attorneys other than himself and time spent\n\non a motion for conditional class certification that was never filed. Id. ¶ 20. Plaintiff contends\n\nthat the fee request therefore reflects the exercise of “significant billing judgment, and constitutes\n\napproximately one-fifth of the total fees expended by Lawyers’ Committee staff on this matter.”\n\nSee Memo. at 16; Affidavit of Dennis Corkery [Dkt. 31-4], Attachment A. In her motion,\n\nPlaintiff further claims that her attorneys excluded all time expended by RDC attorneys and staff,\n\namounting to hundreds of hours, in developing the case, investigating its legal and factual\n\nunderpinnings for it, drafting the complaint, and preparing the instant motion. Memo. at 16.\n\n       Corkery’s affidavit and the attached timesheet, which reflect entries made\n\ncontemporaneously with the work performed, provide sufficient detail to enable the Court to\n\nindependently review the reasonableness of the hours Plaintiff claims. Nat’l Ass’n of Concerned\n\nVeterans, 675 F.2d at 1325 (a fee application “must be sufficiently detailed to permit the District\n\nCourt to make an independent determination whether or not the hours claimed are justified” and\n\nshould normally include “detailed summaries based on contemporaneous time records indicating\n\f                                             Appendix A\n\n\nthe work performed by each attorney for whom fees are sought”).

Those costs total $574.50. The undersigned finds\n\nthose costs to be reasonable and compensable. See Ventura, 738 F. Supp. 2d at 33–34 (awarding\n\nfull costs to FLSA plaintiffs); Bradshaw, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2803401</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 n.4 (including filing fee and\n\nservice of process expenses in an award of costs pursuant to the FLSA).\n\n               4.      Pre- and Post-Judgment Interest\n\n       In her complaint, Plaintiff requests an award of pre-judgment interest on all amounts\n\nowed. Compl. at 19. Yet this Court has held that pre-judgment interest is not available under the\n\nFLSA because the remedies provided therein – recovery of unpaid wages and overtime plus\n\nliquidated damages – are exclusive of any other. See Ventura, 738 F. Supp. 2d at 22–23.\n\nPlaintiff appears to acknowledge this reality in her motion, stating that she will seek an award of\n\npre-judgment interest only if “the Court declines to award liquidated damages as requested\n\nherein.” Memo. at 13 n.5 (citing Radtke, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3827498</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4 (holding that pre-judgment\n\ninterest is permitted where liquidated damages are not awarded)). Plaintiff has not provided the\n\nCourt with any calculation of the pre-judgment interest she might be owed. But because the\n\f                                                Appendix A\n\n\nundersigned recommends that the Court grant Plaintiff the liquidated damages she seeks, there is\n\nlittle incentive to require Plaintiff to undertake that difficult calculation.\n\n          In contrast to pre-judgment interest, courts routinely award post-judgment interest\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1961 in FLSA cases, regardless of any liquidated damages award.

The undersigned therefore\n\nrecommends that the Court permit post-judgment interest to run on the judgment in this case at\n\nthe rate specified in the statute.\n\n                                           CONCLUSION\n\n          For the reasons stated above, the undersigned recommends that the Court grant in part\n\nand deny in part Plaintiff’s motion for default judgment. The undersigned further recommends\n\nthat the Court enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff in this matter in the amount of $5,628.00 in\n\nunpaid wages, overtime compensation, and liquidated damages, $1,609.30 in attorney’s fees, and\n\n$574.50 in costs. The undersigned further recommends that the Court deny an award of pre-\n\njudgment interest but direct that post-judgment interest accrue on the judgment as provided in 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1961. Finally, the undersigned recommends that the Court dismiss Plaintiff’s\n\ncollective-action claims without prejudice pursuant to her notice of voluntary dismissal.\n\n                                     *      *       *        *      *\n\n          The parties are hereby advised that failure to file timely objections to the findings and\n\nrecommendations set forth in this report may waive your right of appeal from an order of the\n\nDistrict Court adopting such findings and recommendations.
