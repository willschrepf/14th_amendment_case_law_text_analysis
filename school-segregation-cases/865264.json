Balogh (Sandra)1 married in New\n\n\n\n      1\n            Because both parties in this case share the same surname, we refer\nto them by their first names, i.e., Ray and Sandra.\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nJersey in 1981.    After moving to Oahu in 2003, the couple began\n\nconstructing a home on a vacant lot they had purchased (Kahalakua\n\nproperty or the property).      The parties held title to the\n\nproperty as tenants by the entirety.\n\n           On October 6, 2008, following a period of tension\n\nbetween Ray and Sandra, they each signed a handwritten document\n\nstating that if they separated, Sandra would receive seventy-five\n\npercent of the profit from the sale of the property, the contents\n\nof their home (excluding Ray’s tools and clothes), and all of\n\ntheir vehicles.    A few weeks later, on October 24, 2008, the\n\nparties signed a typewritten Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)\n\nstating that upon separation or divorce, Sandra would receive\n\nseventy-five percent of the proceeds from the sale of the\n\nproperty, the contents of their home (excluding Ray’s tools and\n\nbuilding equipment), all of their vehicles, and $100,000 from Ray\n\nin lieu of alimony and court proceedings.\n\n           After a period of continued tension between Ray and\n\nSandra, Ray agreed to move out of the couple’s home on August 15,\n\n2009.   On September 1, 2009, Ray signed a quitclaim deed\n\ntransferring his entire interest in the property to Sandra for\n\nten dollars and “other valuable consideration.”\n\n           In January 2010, Sandra filed a complaint for divorce\n\nin the Family Court of the First Circuit.         Notwithstanding the\n\nquitclaim deed and two agreements, the family court awarded Ray\n\nand Sandra each a one-half interest in the property, which it\n\n                                    -2-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nvalued at $1.6 million at the time of divorce.2          The family court\n\nconcluded that it would be unconscionable to enforce the\n\nquitclaim deed and that all three agreements were unenforceable\n\nbecause Ray acted under duress and coercion when he signed them.\n\n           Sandra appealed, and the Intermediate Court of Appeals\n\nvacated in part the family court’s divorce decree and its\n\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law, and remanded for further\n\nproceedings.   The ICA concluded that both the quitclaim deed and\n\nMOU were enforceable.     The ICA explained that the quitclaim deed\n\nwas not unconscionable and that Ray executed both the deed and\n\nthe MOU voluntarily.     The ICA also concluded that the deed\n\nsuperseded the MOU only to the extent it modified the disposition\n\nof the Kahalakua property, and therefore remanded to the family\n\ncourt to determine whether Ray owed Sandra an additional $100,000\n\npursuant to the MOU.\n\n           In his application, Ray presents two questions:\n\n(1) whether the ICA erred in vacating the family court’s decision\n\nthat the postmarital agreements and the quitclaim deed were\n\nunenforceable because they were unconscionable; and (2) whether\n\nthe ICA erred in vacating the family court’s decision that the\n\npostmarital agreements and quitclaim deed were unenforceable\n\nbecause they were entered into involuntarily.\n\n           As a threshold matter, we hold that the quitclaim deed\n\n\n\n     2\n           The Honorable Paul T. Murakami presided.\n\n                                    -3-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\ndoes not constitute a separation agreement that alters the\n\nparties’ rights to an equitable division of their marital\n\npartnership property, such that Sandra should receive the entire\n\nvalue of the Kahalakua property.        The ICA therefore erred in\n\nconcluding that the quitclaim deed was an enforceable separation\n\nagreement.\n\n            Because the quitclaim deed did not affect the\n\ndisposition of the couple’s marital partnership property upon\n\ndivorce, we must also consider whether the MOU is enforceable.\n\nWe hold that the MOU is enforceable because it is not\n\nunconscionable and was entered into voluntarily.            Because we\n\nconclude that the MOU is enforceable, we do not consider the\n\nOctober 6, 2008 handwritten agreement.          The ICA’s judgment is\n\ntherefore vacated, the family court’s divorce decree and findings\n\nof fact and conclusions of law are vacated in part, and we remand\n\nthis case to the family court for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith this opinion.\n\n                              I.   Background\n\n            The following factual background is taken from the\n\nrecord on appeal and the family court’s findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law.3\n\n\n      3\n            On appeal, Sandra challenged only two of the family court’s\nfactual findings. Specifically, Sandra challenged finding of fact 48 to the\nextent it stated that “Sandra told Ray he should leave,” and finding of fact\n53, which stated the following: “After discussions with Sandra, Ray thought\nthe Quitclaim deed would protect the home from potential lawsuits, but title\nwould be transferred back to joint ownership when thing[s] returned to\n                                                                (continued...)\n\n                                     -4-\n\f     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nA.     Factual background\n\n             Ray and Sandra married in 1981 in New Jersey.           At the\n\ntime of the marriage, Sandra owned two properties in Monmouth\n\nCounty, New Jersey.       Sandra sold the first property in 1982 for\n\n$89,000.     The second property was a vacant lot which Sandra had\n\npurchased for $28,750 (Wall Township property).             At the time of\n\nthe marriage, Ray owned one property which he sold shortly\n\nthereafter for $40,000.        According to Ray, after he and Sandra\n\nmarried, they built a home on the Wall Township property.\n\n             Ray and Sandra are both well educated.          Ray has a\n\nbachelor of science and a master’s degree in electrical\n\nengineering.     Sandra has a bachelor of science in biological\n\nscience and a master’s degree in education and student personal\n\nservices.     While living in New Jersey, Ray worked as a contractor\n\nfor various companies.        Before retiring in 2002, Sandra worked as\n\na high school guidance counselor for more than twenty-five years.\n\n             While Ray and Sandra were living in New Jersey, they\n\nregularly vacationed in Hawai#i.         In 2002, Ray and Sandra\n\npurchased the Kahalakua property, which was a vacant lot on O#ahu\n\non Kahalakua Street, for $280,000.          Ray and Sandra took out a\n\nhome-equity loan on the Wall Township property to pay for the\n\n\n\n      3\n        (...continued)\nnormal.” All of the family court’s remaining findings of fact are binding on\nthis court. See Bremer v. Weeks, 104 Hawai#i 43, 63, 85 P.3d 150, 170 (2004)\n(“[F]indings of fact that are not challenged on appeal are binding on the\nappellate court.” (quotation marks, ellipsis, and citation omitted)).\n\n                                      -5-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nKahalakua property.     Ray and Sandra held title to the Kahalakua\n\nproperty as tenants by the entirety.\n\n            In 2003, Ray and Sandra decided to move to Hawai#i so\n\nthat Sandra could care for her elderly parents.           The couple sold\n\nthe Wall Township property for $545,000.\n\n            Soon after arriving in Hawai#i, Ray and Sandra hired a\n\ncontractor to build a home on the Kahalakua property for\n\n$595,000.    The couple used the proceeds from the sale of the Wall\n\nTownship property, as well as approximately $350,000 Ray had\n\ninherited and money from their joint savings, to help pay for the\n\nKahalakua property and the construction of the home on the\n\nproperty.\n\n            Construction on the property began in 2004 and the home\n\nwas supposed to be completed within two years.           There were\n\nproblems with the construction process from the start.            The\n\nbuilder showed up only sporadically and eventually walked off the\n\nproject without completing the work.        In 2006, the builder placed\n\na mechanic’s lien on the property, even though there was a list\n\nof approximately 150 incomplete items.\n\n            The homeowner’s association then sought to assess Ray\n\nand Sandra a penalty totaling $350,000 because the house had not\n\nbeen completed within the prescribed two-year period.            The couple\n\nsued the homeowner’s association, and the parties agreed on a\n\nreduced penalty of $5,000 with an additional two-year period to\n\ncomplete construction of the home.\n\n                                    -6-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\n           In order to complete the home, Ray and Sandra paid a\n\ntotal of $60,000 to six additional subcontractors, but the home\n\nwas still not completed.      About six months after the original\n\nbuilder had walked off the job, Ray and Sandra were able to move\n\ninto the house.\n\n           During this time, Sandra was working as a part-time\n\nsecretary, and Ray was working for Northrop Grumman.            Sandra\n\ncoordinated the work of most of the subcontractors, and Ray\n\nworked on the house when he was home from work.           For example, Ray\n\nfinished the kitchen.\n\n           Tension arose between Ray and Sandra after Ray began\n\ngoing outside their home without clothes on.          Ray’s behavior\n\nresulted in complaints from neighbors and a visit to the couple’s\n\nhome by the police.     Sandra also suspected that Ray was having an\n\naffair because he had lost weight, was working out, and was well\n\ntanned.   Sandra also observed Ray giving other women what she\n\ndescribed as “lecherous looks.”\n\n           Ray stopped working in July 2008, after his contract\n\nwith Northrop Grumman had expired and he was unable to find\n\nadditional work.    At the time of his retirement, Ray was earning\n\nbetween $115,000 and $120,000 per year.         Following his\n\nretirement, Ray continued to work on the house.\n\n           After months of arguing and still questioning Ray’s\n\nfidelity, Sandra told Ray that if he was serious about being\n\ncommitted to the marriage, that they should “write something up.”\n\n                                    -7-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nOn October 6, 2008, Ray wrote an agreement, as dictated by\n\nSandra, that provided the following:\n           If Sandy and Ray Balogh are to separate from each\n           other their assets are to be divided as such:\n\n           I Donald Raymond Balogh agree that my wife Sandra C.\n           Balogh will receive:\n\n           1. ¾ or 75% of the profits of the sale of [] Kahalakua\n           St.\n\n           2. The entire contents of the house excluding Ray’s\n           tools and clothes\n\n           3. All vehicles at time of separation[.]\n\n           Both Ray and Sandra signed the agreement.             Sandra was\n\nnot thinking about divorce when she asked Ray to sign this\n\nagreement; instead, Sandra thought that Ray was committing to\n\nsaving their marriage.      Ray acknowledged that he had agreed to\n\nthe terms of the agreement, and Sandra testified that she did not\n\nthreaten Ray to get him to sign the agreement.           According to Ray,\n\nhe was not in his right mind when he signed the agreement, but\n\nnevertheless signed the agreement to show his good faith and\n\ncommitment to save the marriage.        Ray thought that if he did not\n\nsign the agreement, his and Sandra’s relationship would further\n\ndegrade and he would be thrown out of the house.\n\n           Sandra, however, remained suspicious of Ray’s fidelity.\n\nJust over two weeks after they had signed the first agreement,\n\nRay and Sandra executed the MOU in front of a notary.               The MOU\n\nprovided the following:\n           This Agreement between Donald Balogh and Sandra Balogh\n           will be implemented if they are to separate and/or\n           divorce from each other.\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\n           Their assets will be divided as follows:\n\n           1. In regards to the contents of the house at []\n           Kahalakua St., Honolulu, HI []: Donald Balogh (Ray)\n           will receive his tools and building equipment. Sandra\n           Balogh (Sandy) will receive the entire contents of the\n           house, furniture, appliances, electronics\n           (televisions, etc.)\n\n           2. In regards to vehicles: Sandy will receive the\n           vehicles.\n\n           3. In regards to the proceeds of the house, due to a\n           sale: Sandy will receive 75% of the sale proceeds and\n           Ray will receive 25% of the proceeds.\n\n           4. In regards to compensation: Ray agrees to pay\n           $100,000.00 to Sandy in lieu of Alimony and court\n           proceedings.\n\n           Again, both Ray and Sandra signed the agreement.\n\nSandra testified that the MOU was intended as an inducement for\n\nRay to work on the marriage because if Ray was “going to sign\n\nsomething like that, which gives [Sandra] quite a bit, then [Ray]\n\nmust [have been] serious about working on the marriage.”             Sandra\n\ntestified that she added the additional term requiring Ray to pay\n\nher $100,000 to obtain further commitment from Ray to their\n\nmarriage and to “see how serious he was.”         Ray acknowledged that\n\nhe agreed to the terms of the MOU, and Sandra testified that she\n\ndid not threaten Ray before he signed the MOU.           Because Ray\n\nsigned the MOU, Sandra thought that Ray would tell her the truth\n\nand stop his inappropriate behavior.        Ray signed the MOU in a\n\n“desperate attempt to hold the marriage together.”\n\n           In November 2008, an attorney representing the\n\nhomeowner’s association mailed a letter to Ray and Sandra.             The\n\nletter stated that a number of individuals had complained about\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nRay’s behavior.    In January 2009, a second letter was mailed to\n\nRay and Sandra.    This letter detailed another incident involving\n\nRay and demanded that Ray cease and desist.          Ray hid both of\n\nthese letters from Sandra.      Ray’s behavior, however, did not\n\nstop.\n\n           In June 2009, Ray and Sandra were walking on the\n\nMakapu#u Trail when police stopped Ray to question him about\n\nexposing his buttocks.      The following month, Ray and Sandra were\n\nat Ala Moana shopping center when security officers again stopped\n\nthe couple to question Ray about exposing his buttocks.            Ray was\n\nissued a trespass warning, banning him from the shopping center\n\nfor one year.    Following both incidents, Ray told Sandra that he\n\nhad not exposed himself.\n\n           Ray sent a written request to Ala Moana, asking that\n\nthe one-year ban be lifted, but on August 10, 2009, that request\n\nwas denied.   Upon receiving the letter denying Ray’s request,\n\nSandra wanted to contact a lawyer because she believed Ray that\n\nhe had done nothing wrong.      Ray then admitted to exposing his\n\nbuttocks at Ala Moana.      Sandra was shocked.      Ray agreed to move\n\nout of the couple’s home the following day.\n\n           Ray testified that by that point, the marriage had\n\n“melted down,” the anxiety and friction were constant, and there\n\nwas “just so much tension in the house,” that he “decided that\n\nit’d be best that [he] leave.”       Before Ray left, Sandra asked him\n\nto call their relatives to tell them what was happening.             While\n\n                                   -10-\n\f     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nRay was speaking to his sister on the telephone, Sandra heard Ray\n\nmention the possibility of divorce and she got upset.              Sandra\n\nthen told Ray, “I need security, Ray, I need security, I need you\n\nto sign the house over to me.”         Ray agreed to do so, and Sandra\n\nsaid that she would make the necessary arrangements.              Ray moved\n\nout of the couple’s home on August 15, 2009.\n\n             On September 1, 2009, Ray and Sandra met to execute a\n\nquitclaim deed, in which Ray granted his interest in the\n\nKahalakua property to Sandra in exchange for ten dollars and\n\n“other valuable consideration.”         According to Ray, he thought the\n\ndeed was only a “temporary agreement,” that would protect the\n\nhome from potential lawsuits, and that title would eventually be\n\ntransferred back to joint ownership.          Ray testified that he\n\nsigned the deed in an effort to save the marriage and that he\n\nsigned the document “in a panic.”\n\n             On September 24, 2009, Ray and Sandra met with Dr.\n\nRenee Robinson for marriage counseling.           Dr. Robinson referred\n\nRay to a specialist on obsessive-compulsive behavior.              Ray saw\n\nthe specialist three times, who recommended ways for Ray to deal\n\nwith his behavior.\n\nB.     Family court proceedings\n\n             Ray and Sandra attempted to execute an uncontested\n\ndivorce, which failed because Ray refused to sign the divorce\n\ndocuments.     On January 14, 2010, Sandra filed a Complaint for\n\nDivorce.     Following a trial, the family court rendered an oral\n\n                                     -11-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\ndecision.    As relevant here, the family court stated the\n\nfollowing:\n            The Court considered what it thought to be the\n            appropriate motivations and reasonings of the parties.\n            What was clear to the Court is that at the time the\n            documents were done, both were focused –- both husband\n            and wife were focused on I think, in their own words,\n            saving the marriage. That was the primary motivation\n            for the documents. At some point those actions --\n            what may have been intent became actions. A quitclaim\n            was signed. But it is unclear as to what the\n            motivations of both parties were, and that’s why,\n            again, you folks went to trial. Based on the relevant\n            case law, the Court finds that this would be an\n            inequitable provision to hold both parties to.\n\n                  Court’s going to rule as follows:\n\n                  With regard to the marital property, which is\n            the Kahala home, the Court is going to basically award\n            Mr. Balogh a one half interest. That one half\n            interest may be satisfied either by way of a sale of\n            the property, in which case the net proceeds are cut\n            in half, or Mrs. Balogh may buy out Mr. Balogh.\n\n                  The Court’s going to set the buy-out price --\n            I’m sorry, the value of the property at 1.6 based on\n            the relevant testimony. Again, the Court comes to\n            that number based on what was presented in court. I\n            know there’s conflicting testimony, but that’s the\n            price the Court’s going to -- or the –- the value the\n            Court will set. Again, if it comes to an actual sale,\n            it may be more, it may be less. For purposes of a\n            buy-out, the Court will set it at 1.6. So basically\n            it’s 800,000, if it’s a buy-out.\n\n            On December 2, 2011, the family court issued the\n\ndivorce decree.     The decree provided the following:\n            a. The Court finds that it is inequitable to enforce\n            the agreements entered into by the parties on October\n            6, 2008, October 24, 2008, and September 1, 2009, as\n            to the real property located at [] Kahalakua Street,\n            Honolulu, Hawaii (marital residence).\n\n            b. The gross value of said property is $1,600,000.00.\n\n            c. Said property shall be sold in a commercially\n            reasonable manner. From the proceeds of the sale, the\n            realtor commissions, escrow fees, and costs of sale\n            shall be paid. Thereafter, the net proceeds shall be\n            divided equally between the parties.\n\n            d. Either party may buy-out the other party.\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\n           e. The foregoing provisions shall be enforced upon the\n           expiration of 90 days from the effective date of this\n           Decree.\n\n           f. The parties [are] to cooperate on resolving the\n           mechanics lien.\n\n           On February 15, 2012, the family court issued its\n\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law.         As relevant here, the\n\nfamily court made the following conclusions of law:\n           K. To enforce the parties’ agreement or the Quitclaim\n           Deed is to award Sandra with a marital asset worth\n           $1,600,000. In doing so, Sandra would be receiving\n           more than 85% of the marital estate.\n\n           L. In addition, Ray contributed $350,000 of his\n           inheritance and $40,000 of his premarital asset[s] to\n           the marital partnership, for which he is not receiving\n           a credit. Sandra contributed $89,000 of her\n           premarital asset[s] to the marital partnership for\n           which she is not receiving a credit.\n\n           M. If Ray received credit for his $390,000 capital\n           contribution, Ray’s share of the retirement/securities\n           accounts would just be sufficient to repay him his\n           capital contribution. He would in essence receive 0%\n           of the marital estate if Sandra is awarded the Kahala\n           Kua property.\n\n           N. After thirty years of marriage, the Court concludes\n           it would be unconscionable to award Sandra the Kahala\n           Kua property by enforcing the Quitclaim Deed. Kuroda\n           v. Kuroda, 87 Haw. 419, 958 P.2d 541 (Haw. App. 1998);\n           and Lewis v. Lewis, 69 Haw. 497, 748 P.2d 1362 (1988).\n\n           O. Further, after considering their testimony, the\n           Court finds that the parties were motivated to save\n           the marriage when they signed the various agreements.\n           When Ray signed the Quitclaim Deed, Ray was protecting\n           their marital home from potential lawsuits and had no\n           intent of permanently transferring his interest to\n           Sandra. Neither party intended their marriage to\n           result in a divorce and to divide their marital estate\n           accordingly.\n\n           P. The Court finds Ray was suffering from extreme\n           distress as a result of the ongoing construction of\n           their Kahala Kua residence, the contractor’s walk-off\n           and lawsuit in 2006, the penalties assessed by the\n           [homeowner’s association] and parties’ lawsuit against\n           [the homeowner’s association], his high security\n           clearance job which also required twenty-four\n           hour/seven days on call one week a month, the\n           continuing issues with the subcontractors, and his\n           uncontrollable obsessive behavior that escalated from\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\f     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\n             his backyard nudity to public display, his shame and\n             embarrassment, his fear of being discovered, and the\n             constant argument with Sandra about his inappropriate\n             behavior. At the same time, Sandra suspected him of\n             infidelity which further exacerbated the marital\n             relationship and escalated the tension and the\n             friction in their home. Ray was thus under duress\n             and coercion when he signed the agreements. Prell v.\n             Silverstein, 114 Haw. 286, 162 P.3d 2 (Haw. App.\n             2007).\n\n             Q. Therefore, the Court concludes that the parties’\n             agreements on October 6, 2008, October 24,2008, and\n             September 1, 2009, are not enforceable.\n\n             R. Accordingly, each party shall be awarded\n             fifty-percent (50%) interest in their Kahala Kua\n             property. The parties may sell said property and\n             divide the net sales proceeds equally or Sandra may\n             buyout Ray’s interest for the amount of Eight Hundred\n             Thousand and No/l00 Dollars ($800,000.00). Said\n             provision shall take place within 90 days of the\n             effective date of the Divorce Decree.\n\nC.     ICA proceedings and proceedings in this court\n\n             On December 20, 2011, Sandra timely filed a notice of\n\nappeal.    In her amended opening brief — and as relevant here —\n\nSandra argued that the agreements and the quitclaim deed were not\n\nunconscionable, Ray was not under duress when he signed each\n\nagreement and the deed, and in signing the three documents, Ray\n\ndid not intend to protect the Kahalakua property from the claims\n\nof third parties.      Sandra argued, therefore, that the agreements\n\nand the deed were enforceable.\n\n             The ICA agreed with Sandra that the family court erred\n\nwith regard to the agreements’ enforceability.             The ICA first\n\nconcluded that the quitclaim deed was not unconscionable.               The\n\nICA noted that “nothing in the record indicates unfair surprise,”\n\nand that “this is not an exceptional case where the agreement was\n\nso one-sided that it is unconscionable even without a showing of\n\n                                     -14-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nunfair surprise.”    The ICA explained that “[t]he fact that\n\n[Ray’s] (perhaps shortsighted) decision to quitclaim his interest\n\nto [Sandra] ultimately turned out to be a bad one from his\n\nperspective is irrelevant and does not warrant invalidating the\n\nquitclaim deed.”\n\n            The ICA further concluded that Ray “freely and\n\nvoluntarily entered into the agreements.”         Specifically, the ICA\n\nnoted that both Ray and Sandra were well educated, and that\n\n“there is nothing in the record showing that [Sandra] used\n\nthreats or any other improper methods of persuasion.”            The ICA\n\nalso rejected Ray’s argument that he never intended to convey his\n\ninterest in the Kahalakua property.        The ICA explained that Ray’s\n\nstatements regarding intent “were inadmissible for purposes of\n\ncontradicting the deed’s clear language, under which he granted\n\nhis interest in the [Kahalakua property] to [Sandra] as tenant in\n\nseveralty.”    The ICA further explained that because the deed was\n\nunambiguous, extrinsic evidence of the facts and circumstances\n\nsurrounding the execution of the deed was not “competent to\n\ncontradict, defeat, modify or otherwise vary the meaning or legal\n\neffect of the deed.”     (Internal quotation marks and citation\n\nomitted).    The ICA concluded, therefore, that the “Family Court\n\nerred in failing to classify the [Kahalakua property] as\n\n[Sandra’s] separate property pursuant to the plain language of\n\nthe deed.”\n\n            In a concurring opinion, Judge Foley stated that\n\n                                   -15-\n\f     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nunconscionability encompasses two basic principles:               one-\n\nsidedness and unfair surprise, and indicated that both must be\n\npresent in order for the doctrine to apply.            Specifically, Judge\n\nFoley noted that, even assuming the quitclaim deed was one-sided,\n\n“nothing in the record indicates unfair surprise.”\n\n             The ICA entered its judgment on appeal on October 3,\n\n2013, and, on December 2, 2013, Ray timely filed an application\n\nfor writ of certiorari.        In his application for writ of\n\ncertiorari, Ray presents two questions:\n             1.    Whether the ICA erred in vacating the Family\n                   Court’s decision that postmarital agreements\n                   were unenforceable because they were\n                   unconscionable.\n\n             2.    Whether the ICA erred in vacating the Family\n                   Court’s decision that postmarital agreements\n                   were unenforceable because they were\n                   involuntary.\n\n\n                         II.   Standards of Review\n\nA.     Construction of contract\n\n             “[T]he construction and legal effect to be given a\n\ncontract is a question of law freely reviewable by an appellate\n\ncourt.”    Brown v. KFC Nat’l Mgmt. Co., 82 Hawai#i 226, 239, 921\n\nP.2d 146, 159 (1996).       Unconscionability is a question of law\n\nthis court reviews de novo.         See, e.g., HRS § 490:2-302(1)\n\n(2008).    “Whether particular circumstances are sufficient to\n\nconstitute . . . duress is a question of law, although the\n\nexistence of those circumstances is a question of fact.”                 Gruver\n\nv. Midas Int’l Corp., 925 F.2d 280, 282 (9th Cir. 1991) (citing\n\n                                     -16-\n\f      *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nOregon law on economic duress).\n\nB.      Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n\n              The family court’s findings of fact are reviewed under\n\nthe clearly erroneous standard.          Kakinami v. Kakinami, 127\n\nHawai#i 126, 136, 276 P.3d 695, 706 (2012) (citation omitted).                 A\n\nfinding of fact is clearly erroneous when “(1) the record lacks\n\nsubstantial evidence to support the finding, or (2) despite\n\nsubstantial evidence in support of the finding, the appellate\n\ncourt is nonetheless left with a definite and firm conviction\n\nthat a mistake has been made.”          Id.   “‘Substantial evidence’ is\n\ncredible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative\n\nvalue to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a\n\nconclusion.”      Id.\n\n              The family court’s conclusions of law are reviewed de\n\nnovo.     Id.\n\n                               III.   Discussion\n\n              At the outset, we must decide whether the quitclaim\n\ndeed in fact constituted a separation agreement that altered the\n\nparties’ rights to an equitable division of the couple’s marital\n\npartnership property, such that Sandra must receive the entire\n\nvalue of the Kahalakua property pursuant to the deed.               For the\n\nreasons set forth below, the answer to this threshold question is\n\nno.     Accordingly, the ICA erred in concluding that the quitclaim\n\ndeed was an enforceable separation agreement.\n\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\f     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\n             Because the quitclaim deed did not affect the\n\ndisposition of the parties’ property upon divorce, we must also\n\ndecide whether the MOU is enforceable.           For the reasons set forth\n\nbelow, the MOU is enforceable because it is not unconscionable\n\nand Ray entered into the agreement voluntarily.             Because we\n\nconclude that the MOU is enforceable, we do not consider the\n\nenforceability of the October 6, 2008 handwritten agreement.\n\nA.     The quitclaim deed was not an agreement to alter the\n       division of Ray and Sandra’s marital partnership property\n\n             “In Hawai#i, there is no fixed rule for determining the\n\namount of property to be awarded each spouse in a divorce action\n\nother than as set forth HRS § 580–47.”           Kakinami, 127 Hawai#i at\n\n136-37, 276 P.3d at 706-06 (brackets and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted) (quoting Tougas v. Tougas, 76 Hawai#i 19, 26, 868 P.2d\n\n437, 444 (1994)).      Pursuant to HRS § 580-47(a), the family court\n\nhas broad discretion to divide the estate of divorcing parties in\n\na “just and equitable” manner.         HRS § 580-47(a) (Supp. 2011); see\n\nalso Kakinami, 127 Hawai#i at 137, 276 P.3d at 706.             This court\n\nhas adopted the “partnership model of marriage” to guide the\n\nfamily court in its exercise of this discretion.             Kakinami, 127\n\nHawai#i at 137, 276 P.3d at 706 (citing Gussin v. Gussin, 73 Haw.\n\n470, 486, 836 P.2d 484, 492 (1992)).          Pursuant to the partnership\n\nmodel, “the family court can utilize the following five\n\ncategories of net market values (NMVs) as guidance in divorce\n\ncases”:\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\n             Category 1. The [NMV], plus or minus, of all property\n             separately owned by one spouse on the date of marriage\n             (DOM) but excluding the NMV attributable to property\n             that is subsequently legally gifted by the owner to\n             the other spouse, to both spouses, or to a third\n             party.\n\n             Category 2. The increase in the NMV of all property\n             whose NMV on the DOM is included in category 1 and\n             that the owner separately owns continuously from the\n             DOM to the DOCOEPOT [date of the conclusion of the\n             evidentiary part of the trial.]\n\n             Category 3. The date-of-acquisition NMV, plus or\n             minus, of property separately acquired by gift or\n             inheritance during the marriage but excluding the NMV\n             attributable to property that is subsequently legally\n             gifted by the owner to the other spouse, to both\n             spouses, or to a third party.\n\n             Category 4. The increase in the NMV of all property\n             whose NMV on the date of acquisition during the\n             marriage is included in category 3 and that the owner\n             separately owns continuously from the date of\n             acquisition to the DOCOEPOT.\n\n             Category 5. The difference between the NMVs, plus or\n             minus, of all property owned by one or both of the\n             spouses on the DOCOEPOT minus the NMVs, plus or minus,\n             includable in categories 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nId. at 137-38, 276 P.3d at 706-07 (brackets in original).\n\n             These NMVs generally determine the division of marital\n\npartnership property upon divorce.          However, spouses may\n\nexpressly contract for a different division of marital\n\npartnership property, and the family court must enforce all valid\n\nand enforceable agreements with regard to marital property\n\ndivision.4    See HRS § 572-22 (2006) (“All contracts made between\n\n\n\n      4\n             Spouses may contract regarding marital property rights in\npremarital, postmarital, or settlement agreements. Premarital or prenuptial\nagreements are entered into before marriage. See, e.g., Prell v. Silverstein,\n114 Hawai#i 286, 287-88, 162 P.3d 2, 3-4 (App. 2007). Postmarital or\npostnuptial agreements are entered into after marriage. See, e.g., Chen v.\nHoeflinger, 127 Hawai#i 346, 352, 279 P.3d 11, 17 (App. 2012). Settlement\nagreements are entered into after separation or in anticipation of immediate\nseparation. See, e.g., Bienvenue v. Bienvenue, 102 Hawai#i 59, 61, 72 P.3d\n531, 533 (App. 2003).\n\n                                     -19-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nspouses . . . not otherwise invalid because of any other law,\n\nshall be valid.”); Epp v.

In addition, spouses may exclude certain assets\n\nfrom the marital partnership entirely, thereby segregating those\n\nassets as marital separate property.          Marital separate property\n\nincludes:\n             a.

Thus, although the language of the\n\ndeed effectuated a change in who held title to the property, it\n\nwas not, standing alone, sufficient to remove the property from\n\nthe marital partnership.       See Reithbrock v. Lange, 128 Hawai#i 1,\n\n16 n.9, 282 P.3d 543, 558 n.9 (2012) (noting that awarding\n\nproperty solely on the basis of which spouse holds title would\n\nconflict with the partnership model of property division).\n\n            Accordingly, this court must look to the circumstances\n\nsurrounding the quitclaim deed to determine whether it was\n\nintended to alter the disposition of the Kahalakua property.6\n\nAccording to Ray, he signed the deed to protect the property from\n\nlawsuits, and he and Sandra intended to eventually “restore the\n\ntitle to joint ownership.”       However, according to Sandra, Ray\n\nsigned the quitclaim deed because she told him, “I need\n\nsecurity.”    Sandra further testified that, pursuant to the deed,\n\nshe “gave up” the $100,000 due to her under the MOU in exchange\n\nfor receiving the entire Kahalakua property.\n\n            The family court credited Ray’s explanation for the\n\n\n\n      6\n            Thus, the ICA erred in concluding that “[Ray’s] statements\nregarding intent were inadmissible for purposes of contradicting the deed’s\nclear language.” Although the deed was unambiguous with respect to the\ntransfer of title, it was ambiguous with respect to whether it was intended to\nalter the division of the property upon the parties’ divorce. Accordingly,\nthe ICA was incorrect in stating that “[t]he Family Court erred in failing to\nclassify the Property as [Sandra’s] separate property pursuant to the plain\nlanguage of the deed.”\n\n                                    -21-\n\f    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nquitclaim deed, finding that, “[a]fter discussions with Sandra,\n\nRay thought the Quitclaim deed would protect the home from\n\npotential lawsuits, but title would be transferred back to joint\n\nownership when things returned to normal.”           Although Sandra\n\nchallenged this finding on appeal, it is supported by substantial\n\nevidence in the form of Ray’s testimony.           In re Doe, 95 Hawai#i\n\n183, 190, 20 P.3d 616, 623 (2001) (“[I]t is well-settled that an\n\nappellate court will not pass upon issues dependent upon the\n\ncredibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence; this is\n\nthe province of the trier of fact.” (internal quotation marks and\n\nbrackets omitted)).      Accordingly, the family court’s finding is\n\nnot clearly erroneous, and it is therefore binding on this court.\n\n            Based on the family court’s finding, the parties did\n\nnot intend the quitclaim deed to alter the disposition of their\n\nmarital partnership property upon their divorce.            Accordingly,\n\nthe quitclaim deed did not bar the family court from equitably\n\ndividing the Kahalakua property.         Thus, this court need not\n\ndetermine whether the quitclaim deed was unconscionable or agreed\n\nto under duress.7\n\n\n      7\n            In general, a deed is not a contract. See, e.g., Brown v. Brown,\n501 So. 2d 24, 26 n.1 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1986) (“As distinguished from\ncovenants of warranty, et cetera, which are often in a deed but which are not\nessential to its character, a deed is not a contract. A deed does something\n(conveys land) as distinguished from promising to do something.”).\nNevertheless, to the extent the parties here treat the quitclaim deed as a\ncontract, it is well settled that “there must be a meeting of the minds on all\nessential elements or terms in order to create a binding contract.” Moss v.\nAm.

In her appeal to the ICA,\n\nSandra described the October 6, 2008 agreement, the MOU, and the\n\nquitclaim deed as a “series of agreements for their divorce,” and\n\nmaintained that each of the agreements was enforceable.              However,\n\nSandra also argued that, even if the family court’s findings and\n\nconclusions regarding the quitclaim deed are affirmed, the\n\nOctober 6, 2008 agreement and subsequent MOU should nonetheless\n\nbe enforced.     Consistent with this view, Sandra continues to\n\nargue in this court that all three agreements are enforceable.\n\nAccordingly, we next consider whether the MOU is enforceable.\n\nB.     In general, a postmarital agreement is unconscionable if it\n       is impermissibly one-sided and is the result of unfair\n       surprise\n\n             As stated, the family court must enforce all valid and\n\nenforceable postmarital and separation agreements.             See Epp, 80\n\nHawai#i at 87, 905 P.2d at 62.         A postmarital or separation\n\nagreement is enforceable if the agreement is “not unconscionable\n\nand has been voluntarily entered into by the parties with the\n\nknowledge of the financial situation of the [other] spouse.”                  See\n\nLewis v. Lewis, 69 Haw. 497, 501, 748 P.2d 1362, 1366 (1988); see\n\nalso Chen v.

For the\n\nreasons set forth below, Ray’s argument is without merit.\n\n             Unconscionability encompasses two principles: one-\n\nsidedness and unfair surprise.        Lewis, 69 Haw. at 502, 748 P.2d\n\n1366.     One-sidedness (i.e., substantive unconscionability) means\n\nthat the agreement “leaves a post-divorce economic situation that\n\nis unjustly disproportionate.”        Id.   Unfair surprise (i.e.,\n\nprocedural unconscionability) means that “one party did not have\n\nfull and adequate knowledge of the other party’s financial\n\ncondition when the [marital] agreement was executed.”             Id.   A\n\ncontract that is merely “inequitable” is not unenforceable.9                Id.\n\nat 500, 748 P.2d at 1366.       The unconscionability of an agreement\n\nregarding the division of property is evaluated at the time the\n\n\n\n      8\n            Some jurisdictions have concluded that postmarital agreements are\nsubject to greater scrutiny than premarital agreements because of the nature\nof the marital relationship. See, e.g., Bedrick v. Bedrick, 17 A.3d 17, 27\n(Conn. 2011) (“This leads us to conclude that postnuptial agreements require\nstricter scrutiny than prenuptial agreements.”). The dissent adopts such a\nview, arguing that “transactions between spouses should be subject to the\ngeneral rules governing fiduciary relationships,” and that “an agreement that\n[is] not in accordance with fiduciary standards should be presumptively\ninvoluntary and unenforceable.” Dissent at 28-29. Neither the family court\nnor the ICA concluded that a heightened standard should be applied in\nevaluating postmarital agreements, and neither party has argued that this\ncourt should apply such a standard. We therefore do not consider whether\npostmarital agreements should be subject to greater scrutiny than premarital\nagreements.\n\n      9\n            Although the family court stated in the divorce decree that it\nwould be “inequitable to enforce the agreements entered into by the parties,”\nthe family court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law indicate that the\nfamily court concluded that “it would be unconscionable to award Sandra the\nKahala Kua property by enforcing the Quitclaim Deed,” not merely\n“inequitable.” The family court therefore applied the correct legal standard\nin determining whether the deed was unconscionable.\n\n                                    -24-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nagreement was executed.      See id. at 507, 748 P.2d at 1369.\n\n           Generally, “[a] determination of unconscionability\n\n. . . requires a showing that the contract was both procedurally\n\nand substantively unconscionable when made,” but there may be\n\n“exceptional cases where a provision of the contract is so\n\noutrageous as to warrant holding it unenforceable on the ground\n\nof substantive unconscionability alone.”         Gillman v. Chase\n\nManhattan Bank, N.A., 534 N.E.2d 824, 828-29 (N.Y. 1988); see\n\nalso Adler v. Fred Lind Manor, 103 P.3d 773, 782 (Wash. 2004) (en\n\nbanc) (“individual contractual provisions may be so one-sided and\n\nharsh as to render them substantively unconscionable despite the\n\nfact that the circumstances surrounding the parties’ agreement to\n\nthe contract do not support a finding of procedural\n\nunconscionability”); Maxwell v. Fidelity Fin. Servs., Inc., 907\n\nP.2d 51, 59 (Ariz. 1995) (concluding under state statute that “a\n\nclaim of unconscionability can be established with a showing of\n\nsubstantive unconscionability alone”).         Although some courts have\n\nconcluded that “[t]o be unenforceable, a contract must be both\n\nprocedurally and substantively unconscionable,” see, e.g., Marin\n\nStorage & Trucking, Inc. v. Benco Contracting and Eng’g, Inc.,\n\n107 Cal. App. 4th 1042, 1052 (Cal. Ct. App. 2001), most\n\nauthorities have recognized that, in at least some cases,\n\nsubstantive unconscionability, without more, can render an\n\nagreement unenforceable, see Restatement (Second) of Contracts\n\n§ 208 cmt. c (1981) (“Theoretically it is possible for a contract\n\n                                   -25-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nto be oppressive taken as a whole, even though there is no\n\nweakness in the bargaining process and no single term which is in\n\nitself unconscionable.”); 7 Joseph M. Perillo, Corbin on\n\nContracts § 29.1 at 377 (revised ed. 2002) (“Some cases hold that\n\nthe defense of unconscionability cannot be invoked unless the\n\ncontract or clause is both procedurally and substantively\n\nunconscionable, but there is no basis in the text of [Uniform\n\nCommercial Code §2-302] for such a conclusion.” (footnotes\n\nomitted)).    Indeed, the courts of this state have recognized\n\nthat, under certain circumstances, an impermissibly one-sided\n\nagreement may be unconscionable even if there is no unfair\n\nsurprise.\n\n            For example, in Kuroda v. Kuroda, 87 Hawai#i 419, 428\n\n(App. 1998), the court held that a postnuptial agreement was\n\nunconscionable where it awarded the wife all personal and real\n\nproperty held in common, implicitly allowed the wife to keep her\n\npersonal property including her accounts, required the husband to\n\npay the wife one half of his net income from every source until\n\neither spouse passed away, and required the husband to pay all\n\nattorney’s fees and costs associated with the separation and\n\ndivorce.    The Kuroda court reached this conclusion without\n\nconsidering whether there was unfair surprise.           Thus, although\n\nunder Hawai#i law “two basic principles are encompassed within\n\nthe concept of unconscionability, one-sidedness and unfair\n\nsurprise,” Lewis, 69 Hawai#i at 502, 748 P.2d at 1366, in certain\n\n                                   -26-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\ncircumstances, one-sidedness alone can render an agreement\n\nunconscionable, see Kuroda, 87 Hawai#i at 428, 958 P.2d at 550.\n\n           Here, the ICA applied the correct legal standard in its\n\nmemorandum opinion.     Specifically, the majority stated that\n\n“there need not be both one-sidedness and unfair surprise in\n\nreaching a determination that a marital agreement is\n\nunconscionable.”    The ICA concluded, however, that the quitclaim\n\ndeed was not “so outrageously oppressive as to be unconscionable\n\nin the absence of unfair surprise.”\n\n           Ray nevertheless argues that instead of applying the\n\nwell settled law, “the ICA held that a marital agreement is only\n\nenforceable if there is both one-sidedness and unfair surprise.”\n\nRay’s description of the ICA’s analysis does not accurately\n\ncharacterize the approach taken by that court.           The ICA did not\n\nhold that one-sidedness, without more, would never be enough to\n\nfind an agreement unconscionable.         Instead, the ICA concluded\n\nthat the deed was not so “one-sided that it is unconscionable\n\neven without a showing of unfair surprise.”          Thus, the ICA\n\nplainly applied the correct legal standard in considering the\n\nvalidity of the deed.\n\n           Ray also appears to argue that this legal standard is\n\noverly narrow.    According to Ray, “a marital agreement is\n\nunenforceable if it is one-sided,” and unconscionability in the\n\ncontext of marital agreements does not require a showing of\n\nunfair surprise.    Put another way, Ray appears to argue that a\n\n                                   -27-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nmarital agreement need not be exceptionally one-sided in order to\n\nbe unconscionable.      Ray further argues that requiring a showing\n\nof unfair surprise is absurd in the context of postmarital\n\nagreements because spouses “are in an obvious[ly] better position\n\nto be knowledgeable about their spouse’s financial condition.”\n\n            Ray’s arguments are without merit.         First, Ray does not\n\ncite to any cases invalidating a postmarital agreement solely on\n\nthe basis of that agreement being somewhat one-sided.10\n\nFurthermore, parties may have legitimate reasons for entering\n\ninto a somewhat one-sided postmarital agreement, and may do so\n\nknowingly and voluntarily.       Permitting the family court to\n\ninvalidate such agreements without requiring a showing of\n\nextraordinary one-sidedness would frustrate the purpose of HRS\n\n§ 572-22, which permits spouses to enter into enforceable\n\ncontracts with each other.\n\n            Accordingly, the ICA applied the correct legal standard\n\nin evaluating unconscionability.\n\n\n\n      10\n            Ray cited two cases involving unconscionability in divorce\nactions. The first, In re Marriage of Thomas, 199 S.W.3d 847, 860 (Mo. App.\n2006), does not support Ray’s argument because the court there noted that\nparties are bound to the provisions of a pre-nuptial agreement “only if the\nagreement was conscionable and fairly made,” i.e., both substantively and\nprocedurally conscionable. Id. at 852 (emphasis added). Additionally, the\ncourt emphasized a similar standard of one-sidedness as that articulated by\nthe ICA: “An agreement is unconscionable when the inequality is so strong,\ngross, and manifest that it must be impossible to state it to one with common\nsense without producing an exclamation at the inequality of it.” Id.\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Similarly, in the second\ncase, In re Marriage of Manzo, 659 P.2d 669, 671 (Colo. 1983), the court\nconsidered both whether the agreement was procured through “overreaching,\nfraud, concealment of assets, or sharp dealing,” and whether it was\nsubstantively “fair, just and reasonable.” Id. at 675.\n\n                                    -28-\n\f     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nC.     The MOU is not unconscionable\n\n               Ray argues that the marital agreements were one-sided\n\nand therefore unconscionable.11        In her response to this court,\n\nSandra agrees that it would be one-sided to award the Kahalakua\n\nproperty to her in its entirety pursuant to the deed.              Sandra\n\nargues, however, that the MOU is not “unjustly disproportionate”\n\nbecause Ray would receive 25% of the proceeds of the sale of the\n\nproperty, in addition to any cash accounts and retirement\n\nbenefits awarded by the family court.           (Citing Chen, 127 Hawai#i\n\nat 357, 279 P.3d at 22).\n\n               Although the family court did not address whether the\n\nMOU is unconscionable, this court may nonetheless reach the issue\n\nbecause unconscionability is a question of law, reviewable de\n\nnovo.       See, e.g., HRS § 490:2-302(1).      For the reasons set forth\n\nbelow, the MOU is not unconscionable with respect to the division\n\nof the Kahalakua property, nor is it unconscionable to the extent\n\nit required Ray to pay Sandra $100,000 in lieu of alimony.12                The\n\nMOU is therefore an enforceable marital agreement with regard to\n\nthese clauses.\n\n               Again, the terms of the MOU were as follows:\n\n\n\n       11\n            Nothing in the record suggests that Ray was surprised by the terms\nof the MOU, and Ray did not argue otherwise in his answering brief or\napplication. The only issue, therefore, is whether the MOU was so\nimpermissibly one-sided that it is unconscionable.\n      12\n            Although the MOU also addressed Ray’s tools and building\nequipment, the contents of the house, and the couple’s vehicles, the\ndisposition of those items is not being disputed by the parties.\n\n                                     -29-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\n                This Agreement between Donald Balogh and Sandra Balogh\n                will be implemented if they are to separate and/or\n                divorce from each other.\n\n                Their assets will be divided as follows:\n\n                . . . .\n\n                3. In regards to the proceeds of the house, due to a\n                sale: Sandy will receive 75% of the sale proceeds and\n                Ray will receive 25% of the proceeds.\n\n                4. In regards to compensation: Ray agrees to pay\n                $100,000.00 to Sandy in lieu of Alimony and court\n                proceedings.\n\n                Even if the allocation of the entire Kahalakua property\n\nto Sandra pursuant to the quitclaim deed could be characterized\n\nas so one-sided as to have been unconscionable, the 75%/25% split\n\nset forth in the MOU and the requirement that Ray pay $100,000 in\n\nlieu of alimony are not.           First, in addition to his share of the\n\nKahalakua property, Ray was entitled to an equitable share of the\n\ncouple’s other major assets, which totaled $760,000.13                   Second,\n\nalthough Ray will receive a lesser share of the proceeds under\n\nthe MOU than he would under the family court’s 50%/50% division\n\nof the property, such imbalance was the express purpose of the\n\nMOU.        As the family court found, “Sandra believed Ray would tell\n\nher the truth and stop his inappropriate behavior by signing the\n\nMOU.        Ray signed it in his desperate attempt to hold the marriage\n\ntogether.”        It is unlikely that the MOU would have been construed\n\nas demonstrative of Ray’s commitment to the marriage had it\n\n\n\n       13\n            The record does not indicate the exact values of Ray’s and\nSandra’s respective shares of their other assets. Based on the family court’s\ncalculations, however, it appears that Ray and Sandra each received about half\nof the other assets.\n\n                                        -30-\n\f     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nprovided for the same division of property Ray was likely to\n\nreceive in the family court under an equitable division upon\n\ndivorce.        Moreover, as noted above, “unless the agreement rises\n\nto the level of unconscionability, a merely ‘inequitable’\n\ncontract is not unenforceable under contract law.”             Lewis, 69\n\nHaw. at 500, 748 P.2d at 1365-66.           Accordingly, the 75%/25%\n\ndivision of the Kahalakua property and the $100,000 payment set\n\nforth in the MOU are not unconscionable.\n\nD.     The MOU was entered into voluntarily\n\n                Ray also argues that the ICA erred in vacating the\n\nfamily court’s decision because he did not enter into each of the\n\nmarital agreements voluntarily.         For the reasons set forth below,\n\nRay executed the MOU voluntarily.14\n\n                “Involuntariness is shown by evidence of ‘duress,\n\ncoercion, undue influence, or any other circumstance indicating\n\nlack of free will or voluntariness.’”           Chen, 127 Hawai#i at 357,\n\n279 P.3d at 22 (quoting Prell, 114 Hawai#i at 298, 162 P.3d at\n\n14).        Here, the family court concluded that Ray was “under duress\n\nand coercion when he signed the agreements” because of the\n\nongoing construction of the Kahalakua home, the contractor\n\nwalking off and the resulting mechanic’s lien, the penalties\n\nassessed by the homeowner’s association and the resulting\n\n\n       14\n            For the reasons stated above, this court need not address whether\nthe quitclaim deed was voluntarily executed. Moreover, because we conclude\nthat the MOU is enforceable, we do not consider the voluntariness of the\nOctober 6, 2008 agreement.\n\n                                     -31-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nlitigation, the demands of Ray’s job, the continuing issues with\n\nsubcontractors, and Ray’s uncontrollable obsessive behavior.                The\n\nfamily court’s factual findings, however, are not sufficient to\n\nsupport a conclusion that Ray signed the agreements under either\n\nduress or coercion.15\n\n            Duress is defined as “a threat of harm made to compel a\n\nperson to do something against his or her will or judgment;\n\n[especially], a wrongful threat made by one person to compel a\n\nmanifestation of seeming assent by another person to a\n\ntransaction without real volition.”         Black’s Law Dictionary 614\n\n(10th ed. 2014).     It is well established that an agreement is\n\nvoidable due to duress when “a party’s manifestation of assent is\n\ninduced by an improper threat by the other party that leaves the\n\nvictim no reasonable alternative.”         Standard Fin. Co., Ltd. v.\n\nEllis, 3 Haw. App. 614, 621, 657 P.2d 1056, 1061 (1983)\n\n(quotation marks and citation omitted); see also Restatement\n\n(Second) of Contracts § 175(1) (“If a party’s manifestation of\n\nassent is induced by an improper threat by the other party that\n\nleaves the victim no reasonable alternative, the contract is\n\nvoidable by the victim.”).16\n\n\n      15\n            It appears that the family court used the terms duress and\ncoercion interchangeably, i.e., there is nothing in the Findings of Fact and\nConclusions of Law to indicate that the court viewed them as legally distinct\nterms. We address each doctrine separately.\n      16\n            Section 175(2) of the Restatement concerns improper threats made\nby a third party to induce the recipient to enter into a contract. However,\nRay does not contend, and the record does not suggest, that any third party\nthreatened Ray to enter into the agreements.\n\n                                    -32-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\n           A threat of divorce does not constitute an improper\n\nthreat since the party making it has the legal right to seek a\n\ndivorce.   See Kam Chin Chun Ming v. Kam Hee Ho, 45 Haw. 521, 558,\n\n371 P.2d 379, 402 (1962) (it is not duress for a party to\n\n“threaten to do what they had a legal right to do”); see also\n\nRubenstein v. Sela, 672 P.2d 492, 494 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1983)\n\n(concluding that husband’s threat to leave the marriage did not\n\nconstitute duress because he had a right to leave the marriage);\n\nAutin v. Autin, 617 So.2d 229, 233 (La. Ct. App. 1993) (holding\n\nthat “a threat of doing a lawful act or a threat of exercising a\n\nright does not constitute duress”).\n\n           However, a threat of exposure of publicly embarrassing\n\ninformation can be the basis of a claim of duress.           See\n\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts § 176(2) (“A threat is improper\n\nif the resulting exchange is not on fair terms, and . . . the\n\nthreatened act would harm the recipient and would not\n\nsignificantly benefit the party making the threat”); id. cmt. f\n\n(“A typical example is a threat to make public embarrassing\n\ninformation concerning the recipient unless he makes a proposed\n\ncontract.”).\n\n           The record here does not support a finding that Ray’s\n\nassent to the MOU was induced by an improper threat by Sandra and\n\nthat he had no reasonable alternative to signing that agreement.\n\nThere was conflicting testimony regarding whether Sandra had\n\nthreatened Ray in order to get him to sign any of the documents.\n\n                                   -33-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nSandra repeatedly testified that she did not threaten Ray in\n\nconnection with the two agreements and the deed.                Ray testified\n\nat one point that Sandra had told him that if he did not sign,\n\nshe would tell family members about his behavior and that she\n\nwould “go public” with that information.17\n\n                In its findings of fact and conclusions of law,\n\nhowever, the trial court did not find that Sandra had threatened\n\nRay.        Rather, it simply identified a number of factors that\n\ncontributed to Ray’s “extreme distress,” ranging from problems\n\nwith the construction to “his uncontrollable obsessive behavior\n\nthat escalated from his backyard nudity to public display, his\n\nshame and embarrassment, his fear of being discovered, and the\n\nconstant argument with Sandra about his inappropriate behavior.”\n\nMoreover, Ray failed to establish that he had no reasonable\n\nalternative to signing the MOU.             Ray could have declined to sign\n\nthe MOU but still attempted to resolve his issues with Sandra in\n\n\n\n       17\n            At another point Ray appeared to deny that Sandra had threatened\nhim. However, this testimony was subject to an objection that was sustained\nby the court:\n\n                      Q. So was it –- was there a -– threat of divorce\n                or exposure to others--\n                      A. No.\n                      Q. –or --\n                             MR.

Sustained.\n                Rephrase the question.\n\n(Emphasis added).\n            Sandra argues that because the answer was not stricken from the\nrecord, it is in evidence. Even assuming arguendo that Ray’s response can be\nconsidered, the fact remains that there was conflicting testimony on this\nissue, and the family court implicitly resolved those conflicts in Sandra’s\nfavor when it declined to find that she had threatened Ray.\n\n                                         -34-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nan effort to save the marriage.       In sum, because the family court\n\ndid not make a finding that Sandra had improperly threatened Ray,\n\nand since Ray had a reasonable alternative to signing the MOU,\n\nthe record does not support the family court’s conclusion that\n\nRay signed that agreement under duress.\n\n           The record also does not support a conclusion that the\n\nMOU was the result of coercion.       Coercion is defined as\n\n“[c]ompulsion of a free agent by physical, moral, or economic\n\nforce or threat of physical force.”        Black’s Law Dictionary 315\n\n(10th ed. 2014).    “Coercion sufficient to avoid a contract need\n\nnot . . . consist of physical force or threats of it.            Social or\n\neconomic pressure illegally or immorally applied may be\n\nsufficient.”   Billouris v. Billouris, 852 N.E.2d 687, 693 (Mass.\n\nApp. Ct. 2006).    For all the reasons set forth above, the record\n\ndoes not support a conclusion that Sandra employed physical,\n\nmoral, or economic force to obtain Ray’s assent.\n\n           Although the family court found Ray was under stress\n\ndue to a variety of factors, those factors do not establish\n\neither duress or coercion.      Moreover, Ray cannot rely on those\n\nfactors to establish that he lacked mental capacity when he\n\nsigned the agreements, since he had specifically agreed prior to\n\ntrial that he was “not claiming lack of mental capacity as to any\n\nissue herein.”    Ray therefore executed the MOU voluntarily.\n\n           In sum, the record does not support the family court’s\n\nconclusion that Ray’s assent to the MOU was the product of duress\n\n                                   -35-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nand coercion.    The dissent does not dispute that analysis, but\n\nrather suggests that the family court did not intend to rely\n\nspecifically on those doctrines, as opposed to other potential\n\ngrounds for finding that Ray’s assent was involuntary.            See\n\nDissent at 10-24.    Respectfully, the family court’s Conclusion of\n\nLaw P quite specifically refers to “duress and coercion” as the\n\nbasis for invalidating the agreement, and the court’s\n\naccompanying citation to the Prell case implies that its reliance\n\non those two doctrines was intentional.\n\n           In any event, we respectfully disagree with the\n\ndissent’s contention that Ray did not enter into the MOU\n\nvoluntarily because his “mental state was extremely vulnerable”,\n\nhe was unduly influenced, and “other circumstances” demonstrate\n\ninvoluntariness.    Dissent at 15, 22-24, 17-22.         First, to the\n\nextent the dissent suggests that Ray’s “mental state” deprived\n\nhim of the capacity to contract, Ray explicitly agreed prior to\n\ntrial that he was not claiming a lack of mental capacity.\n\n           Second, the record does not establish that Ray was\n\nunduly influenced.     Undue influence is “[t]he improper use of\n\npower or trust in a way that deprives a person of free will and\n\nsubstitute’s another’s objective.”        Black’s Law Dictionary 1760\n\n(10th ed. 2014); Cvitanovich-Dubie v. Dubie, 125 Hawai#i 128,\n\n160, 254 P.3d 439, 471 (2011).       As a threshold matter, the family\n\ncourt did not find that Sandra exerted undue influence over Ray,\n\nand Ray does not argue otherwise in this court.           Moreover, the\n\n                                   -36-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nrecord does not support a conclusion that Sandra either attempted\n\nto impose or actually imposed improper influence on Ray.\n\n           Finally, there are no “other circumstances” indicating\n\na lack of free will on Ray’s part.        The dissent asserts that Ray\n\nwas motivated by saving the marriage and that Ray believed he had\n\nno other choice but to sign the agreements.          Dissent at 21.     The\n\nfacts of this case, however, do not support a conclusion that Ray\n\nexecuted the MOU involuntarily.       As noted above, Ray was well\n\neducated, with a bachelor’s and master’s degree in electrical\n\nengineering, and he held a high-level security clearance.             There\n\nis no suggestion in the record that Ray was unaware of what he\n\nwas doing, nor do the facts otherwise support a conclusion that\n\nthe MOU was the result of a lack of free will.           In fact, Ray\n\nexpressly testified that he agreed to all of the terms of the\n\nMOU.   While Ray was under stress from a number of sources, that\n\nstress is not sufficient to establish that the MOU was not\n\nentered into voluntarily.\n\n           The dissent also asserts that the MOU is voidable for a\n\nlack of consideration.      Dissent at 29.     The family court,\n\nhowever, made no findings or conclusions relating to the adequacy\n\nof consideration, and Ray has made no argument in this regard to\n\nthis court.   Thus we do not consider the issue.\n\n           We therefore vacate the family court’s conclusions of\n\nlaw N, P (in part), Q, and R.       We vacate conclusion of law N\n\nbecause the family court treated the quitclaim deed as a\n\n                                   -37-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nseparation agreement.     We vacate conclusion of law P to the\n\nextent the family court concluded that Ray signed the agreements\n\nunder duress and coercion.      We vacate conclusion of law Q because\n\nthe family court concluded that the parties’ agreements were\n\nunenforceable.    Finally, we vacate conclusion of law R because it\n\nawarded Ray and Sandra each a fifty-percent interest in the\n\nKahalakua property.\n\n                             IV.   Conclusion\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, the ICA’s judgment is\n\nvacated, the family court’s divorce decree is vacated, and the\n\nfamily court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law are\n\naffirmed in part and vacated in part.

After moving to Oahu in 2003, the couple began\n\nconstructing a home on a vacant lot they had purchased (Kahalakua\n\nproperty or the property).      The parties held title to the\n\nproperty as tenants by the entirety.\n\n           On October 6, 2008, following a period of tension\n\nbetween Ray and Sandra, they each signed a handwritten document\n\nstating that if they separated, Sandra would receive seventy-five\n\npercent of the profit from the sale of the property, the contents\n\nof their home (excluding Ray’s tools and clothes), and all of\n\ntheir vehicles.    A few weeks later, on October 24, 2008, the\n\nparties signed a typewritten Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)\n\nstating that upon separation or divorce, Sandra would receive\n\nseventy-five percent of the proceeds from the sale of the\n\nproperty, the contents of their home (excluding Ray’s tools and\n\nbuilding equipment), all of their vehicles, and $100,000 from Ray\n\nin lieu of alimony and court proceedings.\n\n           After a period of continued tension between Ray and\n\nSandra, Ray agreed to move out of the couple’s home on August 15,\n\n2009.   On September 1, 2009, Ray signed a quitclaim deed\n\ntransferring his entire interest in the property to Sandra for\n\nten dollars and “other valuable consideration.”\n\n           In January 2010, Sandra filed a complaint for divorce\n\nin the Family Court of the First Circuit.         Notwithstanding the\n\nquitclaim deed and two agreements, the family court awarded Ray\n\nand Sandra each a one-half interest in the property, which it\n\n                                    -2-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nvalued at $1.6 million at the time of divorce.2          The family court\n\nconcluded that it would be unconscionable to enforce the\n\nquitclaim deed and that all three agreements were unenforceable\n\nbecause Ray acted under duress and coercion when he signed them.\n\n           Sandra appealed, and the Intermediate Court of Appeals\n\nvacated in part the family court’s divorce decree and its\n\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law, and remanded for further\n\nproceedings.   The ICA concluded that both the quitclaim deed and\n\nMOU were enforceable.     The ICA explained that the quitclaim deed\n\nwas not unconscionable and that Ray executed both the deed and\n\nthe MOU voluntarily.     The ICA also concluded that the deed\n\nsuperseded the MOU only to the extent it modified the disposition\n\nof the Kahalakua property, and therefore remanded to the family\n\ncourt to determine whether Ray owed Sandra an additional $100,000\n\npursuant to the MOU.\n\n           In his application, Ray presents two questions:\n\n(1) whether the ICA erred in vacating the family court’s decision\n\nthat the postmarital agreements and the quitclaim deed were\n\nunenforceable because they were unconscionable; and (2) whether\n\nthe ICA erred in vacating the family court’s decision that the\n\npostmarital agreements and quitclaim deed were unenforceable\n\nbecause they were entered into involuntarily.\n\n           As a threshold matter, we hold that the quitclaim deed\n\n\n\n     2\n           The Honorable Paul T.

The ICA therefore erred in\n\nconcluding that the quitclaim deed was an enforceable separation\n\nagreement.\n\n            Because the quitclaim deed did not affect the\n\ndisposition of the couple’s marital partnership property upon\n\ndivorce, we must also consider whether the MOU is enforceable.\n\nWe hold that the MOU is enforceable because it is not\n\nunconscionable and was entered into voluntarily.            Because we\n\nconclude that the MOU is enforceable, we do not consider the\n\nOctober 6, 2008 handwritten agreement.          The ICA’s judgment is\n\ntherefore vacated, the family court’s divorce decree and findings\n\nof fact and conclusions of law are vacated in part, and we remand\n\nthis case to the family court for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith this opinion.\n\n                              I.

Specifically, Sandra challenged finding of fact 48 to the\nextent it stated that “Sandra told Ray he should leave,” and finding of fact\n53, which stated the following: “After discussions with Sandra, Ray thought\nthe Quitclaim deed would protect the home from potential lawsuits, but title\nwould be transferred back to joint ownership when thing[s] returned to\n                                                                (continued...)\n\n                                     -4-\n\f     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nA.     Factual background\n\n             Ray and Sandra married in 1981 in New Jersey.           At the\n\ntime of the marriage, Sandra owned two properties in Monmouth\n\nCounty, New Jersey.       Sandra sold the first property in 1982 for\n\n$89,000.     The second property was a vacant lot which Sandra had\n\npurchased for $28,750 (Wall Township property).             At the time of\n\nthe marriage, Ray owned one property which he sold shortly\n\nthereafter for $40,000.        According to Ray, after he and Sandra\n\nmarried, they built a home on the Wall Township property.\n\n             Ray and Sandra are both well educated.          Ray has a\n\nbachelor of science and a master’s degree in electrical\n\nengineering.     Sandra has a bachelor of science in biological\n\nscience and a master’s degree in education and student personal\n\nservices.     While living in New Jersey, Ray worked as a contractor\n\nfor various companies.        Before retiring in 2002, Sandra worked as\n\na high school guidance counselor for more than twenty-five years.\n\n             While Ray and Sandra were living in New Jersey, they\n\nregularly vacationed in Hawai#i.         In 2002, Ray and Sandra\n\npurchased the Kahalakua property, which was a vacant lot on O#ahu\n\non Kahalakua Street, for $280,000.

Ray and Sandra held title to the Kahalakua\n\nproperty as tenants by the entirety.\n\n            In 2003, Ray and Sandra decided to move to Hawai#i so\n\nthat Sandra could care for her elderly parents.           The couple sold\n\nthe Wall Township property for $545,000.\n\n            Soon after arriving in Hawai#i, Ray and Sandra hired a\n\ncontractor to build a home on the Kahalakua property for\n\n$595,000.    The couple used the proceeds from the sale of the Wall\n\nTownship property, as well as approximately $350,000 Ray had\n\ninherited and money from their joint savings, to help pay for the\n\nKahalakua property and the construction of the home on the\n\nproperty.\n\n            Construction on the property began in 2004 and the home\n\nwas supposed to be completed within two years.           There were\n\nproblems with the construction process from the start.            The\n\nbuilder showed up only sporadically and eventually walked off the\n\nproject without completing the work.        In 2006, the builder placed\n\na mechanic’s lien on the property, even though there was a list\n\nof approximately 150 incomplete items.\n\n            The homeowner’s association then sought to assess Ray\n\nand Sandra a penalty totaling $350,000 because the house had not\n\nbeen completed within the prescribed two-year period.            The couple\n\nsued the homeowner’s association, and the parties agreed on a\n\nreduced penalty of $5,000 with an additional two-year period to\n\ncomplete construction of the home.\n\n                                    -6-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\n           In order to complete the home, Ray and Sandra paid a\n\ntotal of $60,000 to six additional subcontractors, but the home\n\nwas still not completed.      About six months after the original\n\nbuilder had walked off the job, Ray and Sandra were able to move\n\ninto the house.\n\n           During this time, Sandra was working as a part-time\n\nsecretary, and Ray was working for Northrop Grumman.            Sandra\n\ncoordinated the work of most of the subcontractors, and Ray\n\nworked on the house when he was home from work.           For example, Ray\n\nfinished the kitchen.\n\n           Tension arose between Ray and Sandra after Ray began\n\ngoing outside their home without clothes on.          Ray’s behavior\n\nresulted in complaints from neighbors and a visit to the couple’s\n\nhome by the police.     Sandra also suspected that Ray was having an\n\naffair because he had lost weight, was working out, and was well\n\ntanned.   Sandra also observed Ray giving other women what she\n\ndescribed as “lecherous looks.”\n\n           Ray stopped working in July 2008, after his contract\n\nwith Northrop Grumman had expired and he was unable to find\n\nadditional work.    At the time of his retirement, Ray was earning\n\nbetween $115,000 and $120,000 per year.         Following his\n\nretirement, Ray continued to work on the house.\n\n           After months of arguing and still questioning Ray’s\n\nfidelity, Sandra told Ray that if he was serious about being\n\ncommitted to the marriage, that they should “write something up.”\n\n                                    -7-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nOn October 6, 2008, Ray wrote an agreement, as dictated by\n\nSandra, that provided the following:\n           If Sandy and Ray Balogh are to separate from each\n           other their assets are to be divided as such:\n\n           I Donald Raymond Balogh agree that my wife Sandra C.\n           Balogh will receive:\n\n           1. ¾ or 75% of the profits of the sale of [] Kahalakua\n           St.\n\n           2. The entire contents of the house excluding Ray’s\n           tools and clothes\n\n           3. All vehicles at time of separation[.]\n\n           Both Ray and Sandra signed the agreement.             Sandra was\n\nnot thinking about divorce when she asked Ray to sign this\n\nagreement; instead, Sandra thought that Ray was committing to\n\nsaving their marriage.      Ray acknowledged that he had agreed to\n\nthe terms of the agreement, and Sandra testified that she did not\n\nthreaten Ray to get him to sign the agreement.           According to Ray,\n\nhe was not in his right mind when he signed the agreement, but\n\nnevertheless signed the agreement to show his good faith and\n\ncommitment to save the marriage.        Ray thought that if he did not\n\nsign the agreement, his and Sandra’s relationship would further\n\ndegrade and he would be thrown out of the house.\n\n           Sandra, however, remained suspicious of Ray’s fidelity.\n\nJust over two weeks after they had signed the first agreement,\n\nRay and Sandra executed the MOU in front of a notary.               The MOU\n\nprovided the following:\n           This Agreement between Donald Balogh and Sandra Balogh\n           will be implemented if they are to separate and/or\n           divorce from each other.\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\n           Their assets will be divided as follows:\n\n           1. In regards to the contents of the house at []\n           Kahalakua St., Honolulu, HI []: Donald Balogh (Ray)\n           will receive his tools and building equipment. Sandra\n           Balogh (Sandy) will receive the entire contents of the\n           house, furniture, appliances, electronics\n           (televisions, etc.)\n\n           2. In regards to vehicles: Sandy will receive the\n           vehicles.\n\n           3. In regards to the proceeds of the house, due to a\n           sale: Sandy will receive 75% of the sale proceeds and\n           Ray will receive 25% of the proceeds.\n\n           4. In regards to compensation: Ray agrees to pay\n           $100,000.00 to Sandy in lieu of Alimony and court\n           proceedings.\n\n           Again, both Ray and Sandra signed the agreement.\n\nSandra testified that the MOU was intended as an inducement for\n\nRay to work on the marriage because if Ray was “going to sign\n\nsomething like that, which gives [Sandra] quite a bit, then [Ray]\n\nmust [have been] serious about working on the marriage.”             Sandra\n\ntestified that she added the additional term requiring Ray to pay\n\nher $100,000 to obtain further commitment from Ray to their\n\nmarriage and to “see how serious he was.”         Ray acknowledged that\n\nhe agreed to the terms of the MOU, and Sandra testified that she\n\ndid not threaten Ray before he signed the MOU.           Because Ray\n\nsigned the MOU, Sandra thought that Ray would tell her the truth\n\nand stop his inappropriate behavior.        Ray signed the MOU in a\n\n“desperate attempt to hold the marriage together.”\n\n           In November 2008, an attorney representing the\n\nhomeowner’s association mailed a letter to Ray and Sandra.             The\n\nletter stated that a number of individuals had complained about\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nRay’s behavior.    In January 2009, a second letter was mailed to\n\nRay and Sandra.    This letter detailed another incident involving\n\nRay and demanded that Ray cease and desist.          Ray hid both of\n\nthese letters from Sandra.      Ray’s behavior, however, did not\n\nstop.\n\n           In June 2009, Ray and Sandra were walking on the\n\nMakapu#u Trail when police stopped Ray to question him about\n\nexposing his buttocks.      The following month, Ray and Sandra were\n\nat Ala Moana shopping center when security officers again stopped\n\nthe couple to question Ray about exposing his buttocks.            Ray was\n\nissued a trespass warning, banning him from the shopping center\n\nfor one year.    Following both incidents, Ray told Sandra that he\n\nhad not exposed himself.\n\n           Ray sent a written request to Ala Moana, asking that\n\nthe one-year ban be lifted, but on August 10, 2009, that request\n\nwas denied.   Upon receiving the letter denying Ray’s request,\n\nSandra wanted to contact a lawyer because she believed Ray that\n\nhe had done nothing wrong.      Ray then admitted to exposing his\n\nbuttocks at Ala Moana.      Sandra was shocked.      Ray agreed to move\n\nout of the couple’s home the following day.\n\n           Ray testified that by that point, the marriage had\n\n“melted down,” the anxiety and friction were constant, and there\n\nwas “just so much tension in the house,” that he “decided that\n\nit’d be best that [he] leave.”       Before Ray left, Sandra asked him\n\nto call their relatives to tell them what was happening.             While\n\n                                   -10-\n\f     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nRay was speaking to his sister on the telephone, Sandra heard Ray\n\nmention the possibility of divorce and she got upset.              Sandra\n\nthen told Ray, “I need security, Ray, I need security, I need you\n\nto sign the house over to me.”         Ray agreed to do so, and Sandra\n\nsaid that she would make the necessary arrangements.              Ray moved\n\nout of the couple’s home on August 15, 2009.\n\n             On September 1, 2009, Ray and Sandra met to execute a\n\nquitclaim deed, in which Ray granted his interest in the\n\nKahalakua property to Sandra in exchange for ten dollars and\n\n“other valuable consideration.”         According to Ray, he thought the\n\ndeed was only a “temporary agreement,” that would protect the\n\nhome from potential lawsuits, and that title would eventually be\n\ntransferred back to joint ownership.          Ray testified that he\n\nsigned the deed in an effort to save the marriage and that he\n\nsigned the document “in a panic.”\n\n             On September 24, 2009, Ray and Sandra met with Dr.\n\nRenee Robinson for marriage counseling.           Dr. Robinson referred\n\nRay to a specialist on obsessive-compulsive behavior.              Ray saw\n\nthe specialist three times, who recommended ways for Ray to deal\n\nwith his behavior.\n\nB.     Family court proceedings\n\n             Ray and Sandra attempted to execute an uncontested\n\ndivorce, which failed because Ray refused to sign the divorce\n\ndocuments.     On January 14, 2010, Sandra filed a Complaint for\n\nDivorce.     Following a trial, the family court rendered an oral\n\n                                     -11-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\ndecision.    As relevant here, the family court stated the\n\nfollowing:\n            The Court considered what it thought to be the\n            appropriate motivations and reasonings of the parties.\n            What was clear to the Court is that at the time the\n            documents were done, both were focused –- both husband\n            and wife were focused on I think, in their own words,\n            saving the marriage. That was the primary motivation\n            for the documents. At some point those actions --\n            what may have been intent became actions. A quitclaim\n            was signed. But it is unclear as to what the\n            motivations of both parties were, and that’s why,\n            again, you folks went to trial. Based on the relevant\n            case law, the Court finds that this would be an\n            inequitable provision to hold both parties to.\n\n                  Court’s going to rule as follows:\n\n                  With regard to the marital property, which is\n            the Kahala home, the Court is going to basically award\n            Mr. Balogh a one half interest. That one half\n            interest may be satisfied either by way of a sale of\n            the property, in which case the net proceeds are cut\n            in half, or Mrs. Balogh may buy out Mr. Balogh.\n\n                  The Court’s going to set the buy-out price --\n            I’m sorry, the value of the property at 1.6 based on\n            the relevant testimony. Again, the Court comes to\n            that number based on what was presented in court. I\n            know there’s conflicting testimony, but that’s the\n            price the Court’s going to -- or the –- the value the\n            Court will set. Again, if it comes to an actual sale,\n            it may be more, it may be less. For purposes of a\n            buy-out, the Court will set it at 1.6. So basically\n            it’s 800,000, if it’s a buy-out.\n\n            On December 2, 2011, the family court issued the\n\ndivorce decree.     The decree provided the following:\n            a. The Court finds that it is inequitable to enforce\n            the agreements entered into by the parties on October\n            6, 2008, October 24, 2008, and September 1, 2009, as\n            to the real property located at [] Kahalakua Street,\n            Honolulu, Hawaii (marital residence).\n\n            b. The gross value of said property is $1,600,000.00.\n\n            c. Said property shall be sold in a commercially\n            reasonable manner. From the proceeds of the sale, the\n            realtor commissions, escrow fees, and costs of sale\n            shall be paid. Thereafter, the net proceeds shall be\n            divided equally between the parties.\n\n            d. Either party may buy-out the other party.\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\n           e. The foregoing provisions shall be enforced upon the\n           expiration of 90 days from the effective date of this\n           Decree.\n\n           f. The parties [are] to cooperate on resolving the\n           mechanics lien.\n\n           On February 15, 2012, the family court issued its\n\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law.         As relevant here, the\n\nfamily court made the following conclusions of law:\n           K. To enforce the parties’ agreement or the Quitclaim\n           Deed is to award Sandra with a marital asset worth\n           $1,600,000. In doing so, Sandra would be receiving\n           more than 85% of the marital estate.\n\n           L. In addition, Ray contributed $350,000 of his\n           inheritance and $40,000 of his premarital asset[s] to\n           the marital partnership, for which he is not receiving\n           a credit. Sandra contributed $89,000 of her\n           premarital asset[s] to the marital partnership for\n           which she is not receiving a credit.\n\n           M. If Ray received credit for his $390,000 capital\n           contribution, Ray’s share of the retirement/securities\n           accounts would just be sufficient to repay him his\n           capital contribution. He would in essence receive 0%\n           of the marital estate if Sandra is awarded the Kahala\n           Kua property.\n\n           N. After thirty years of marriage, the Court concludes\n           it would be unconscionable to award Sandra the Kahala\n           Kua property by enforcing the Quitclaim Deed. Kuroda\n           v.

Further, after considering their testimony, the\n           Court finds that the parties were motivated to save\n           the marriage when they signed the various agreements.\n           When Ray signed the Quitclaim Deed, Ray was protecting\n           their marital home from potential lawsuits and had no\n           intent of permanently transferring his interest to\n           Sandra. Neither party intended their marriage to\n           result in a divorce and to divide their marital estate\n           accordingly.\n\n           P. The Court finds Ray was suffering from extreme\n           distress as a result of the ongoing construction of\n           their Kahala Kua residence, the contractor’s walk-off\n           and lawsuit in 2006, the penalties assessed by the\n           [homeowner’s association] and parties’ lawsuit against\n           [the homeowner’s association], his high security\n           clearance job which also required twenty-four\n           hour/seven days on call one week a month, the\n           continuing issues with the subcontractors, and his\n           uncontrollable obsessive behavior that escalated from\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\f     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\n             his backyard nudity to public display, his shame and\n             embarrassment, his fear of being discovered, and the\n             constant argument with Sandra about his inappropriate\n             behavior. At the same time, Sandra suspected him of\n             infidelity which further exacerbated the marital\n             relationship and escalated the tension and the\n             friction in their home. Ray was thus under duress\n             and coercion when he signed the agreements.

App.\n             2007).\n\n             Q. Therefore, the Court concludes that the parties’\n             agreements on October 6, 2008, October 24,2008, and\n             September 1, 2009, are not enforceable.\n\n             R. Accordingly, each party shall be awarded\n             fifty-percent (50%) interest in their Kahala Kua\n             property. The parties may sell said property and\n             divide the net sales proceeds equally or Sandra may\n             buyout Ray’s interest for the amount of Eight Hundred\n             Thousand and No/l00 Dollars ($800,000.00). Said\n             provision shall take place within 90 days of the\n             effective date of the Divorce Decree.\n\nC.     ICA proceedings and proceedings in this court\n\n             On December 20, 2011, Sandra timely filed a notice of\n\nappeal.    In her amended opening brief — and as relevant here —\n\nSandra argued that the agreements and the quitclaim deed were not\n\nunconscionable, Ray was not under duress when he signed each\n\nagreement and the deed, and in signing the three documents, Ray\n\ndid not intend to protect the Kahalakua property from the claims\n\nof third parties.      Sandra argued, therefore, that the agreements\n\nand the deed were enforceable.\n\n             The ICA agreed with Sandra that the family court erred\n\nwith regard to the agreements’ enforceability.             The ICA first\n\nconcluded that the quitclaim deed was not unconscionable.               The\n\nICA noted that “nothing in the record indicates unfair surprise,”\n\nand that “this is not an exceptional case where the agreement was\n\nso one-sided that it is unconscionable even without a showing of\n\n                                     -14-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nunfair surprise.”    The ICA explained that “[t]he fact that\n\n[Ray’s] (perhaps shortsighted) decision to quitclaim his interest\n\nto [Sandra] ultimately turned out to be a bad one from his\n\nperspective is irrelevant and does not warrant invalidating the\n\nquitclaim deed.”\n\n            The ICA further concluded that Ray “freely and\n\nvoluntarily entered into the agreements.”         Specifically, the ICA\n\nnoted that both Ray and Sandra were well educated, and that\n\n“there is nothing in the record showing that [Sandra] used\n\nthreats or any other improper methods of persuasion.”            The ICA\n\nalso rejected Ray’s argument that he never intended to convey his\n\ninterest in the Kahalakua property.        The ICA explained that Ray’s\n\nstatements regarding intent “were inadmissible for purposes of\n\ncontradicting the deed’s clear language, under which he granted\n\nhis interest in the [Kahalakua property] to [Sandra] as tenant in\n\nseveralty.”    The ICA further explained that because the deed was\n\nunambiguous, extrinsic evidence of the facts and circumstances\n\nsurrounding the execution of the deed was not “competent to\n\ncontradict, defeat, modify or otherwise vary the meaning or legal\n\neffect of the deed.”     (Internal quotation marks and citation\n\nomitted).    The ICA concluded, therefore, that the “Family Court\n\nerred in failing to classify the [Kahalakua property] as\n\n[Sandra’s] separate property pursuant to the plain language of\n\nthe deed.”\n\n            In a concurring opinion, Judge Foley stated that\n\n                                   -15-\n\f     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nunconscionability encompasses two basic principles:               one-\n\nsidedness and unfair surprise, and indicated that both must be\n\npresent in order for the doctrine to apply.            Specifically, Judge\n\nFoley noted that, even assuming the quitclaim deed was one-sided,\n\n“nothing in the record indicates unfair surprise.”\n\n             The ICA entered its judgment on appeal on October 3,\n\n2013, and, on December 2, 2013, Ray timely filed an application\n\nfor writ of certiorari.        In his application for writ of\n\ncertiorari, Ray presents two questions:\n             1.    Whether the ICA erred in vacating the Family\n                   Court’s decision that postmarital agreements\n                   were unenforceable because they were\n                   unconscionable.\n\n             2.    Whether the ICA erred in vacating the Family\n                   Court’s decision that postmarital agreements\n                   were unenforceable because they were\n                   involuntary.\n\n\n                         II.

Discussion\n\n              At the outset, we must decide whether the quitclaim\n\ndeed in fact constituted a separation agreement that altered the\n\nparties’ rights to an equitable division of the couple’s marital\n\npartnership property, such that Sandra must receive the entire\n\nvalue of the Kahalakua property pursuant to the deed.               For the\n\nreasons set forth below, the answer to this threshold question is\n\nno.     Accordingly, the ICA erred in concluding that the quitclaim\n\ndeed was an enforceable separation agreement.\n\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\f     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\n             Because the quitclaim deed did not affect the\n\ndisposition of the parties’ property upon divorce, we must also\n\ndecide whether the MOU is enforceable.           For the reasons set forth\n\nbelow, the MOU is enforceable because it is not unconscionable\n\nand Ray entered into the agreement voluntarily.             Because we\n\nconclude that the MOU is enforceable, we do not consider the\n\nenforceability of the October 6, 2008 handwritten agreement.\n\nA.

Neither the family court\nnor the ICA concluded that a heightened standard should be applied in\nevaluating postmarital agreements, and neither party has argued that this\ncourt should apply such a standard.

Although some courts have\n\nconcluded that “[t]o be unenforceable, a contract must be both\n\nprocedurally and substantively unconscionable,” see, e.g., Marin\n\nStorage & Trucking, Inc. v.

App. 2001), most\n\nauthorities have recognized that, in at least some cases,\n\nsubstantive unconscionability, without more, can render an\n\nagreement unenforceable, see Restatement (Second) of Contracts\n\n§ 208 cmt. c (1981) (“Theoretically it is possible for a contract\n\n                                   -25-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nto be oppressive taken as a whole, even though there is no\n\nweakness in the bargaining process and no single term which is in\n\nitself unconscionable.”); 7 Joseph M. Perillo, Corbin on\n\nContracts § 29.1 at 377 (revised ed. 2002) (“Some cases hold that\n\nthe defense of unconscionability cannot be invoked unless the\n\ncontract or clause is both procedurally and substantively\n\nunconscionable, but there is no basis in the text of [Uniform\n\nCommercial Code §2-302] for such a conclusion.” (footnotes\n\nomitted)).    Indeed, the courts of this state have recognized\n\nthat, under certain circumstances, an impermissibly one-sided\n\nagreement may be unconscionable even if there is no unfair\n\nsurprise.\n\n            For example, in Kuroda v. Kuroda, 87 Hawai#i 419, 428\n\n(App. 1998), the court held that a postnuptial agreement was\n\nunconscionable where it awarded the wife all personal and real\n\nproperty held in common, implicitly allowed the wife to keep her\n\npersonal property including her accounts, required the husband to\n\npay the wife one half of his net income from every source until\n\neither spouse passed away, and required the husband to pay all\n\nattorney’s fees and costs associated with the separation and\n\ndivorce.    The Kuroda court reached this conclusion without\n\nconsidering whether there was unfair surprise.           Thus, although\n\nunder Hawai#i law “two basic principles are encompassed within\n\nthe concept of unconscionability, one-sidedness and unfair\n\nsurprise,” Lewis, 69 Hawai#i at 502, 748 P.2d at 1366, in certain\n\n                                   -26-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\ncircumstances, one-sidedness alone can render an agreement\n\nunconscionable, see Kuroda, 87 Hawai#i at 428, 958 P.2d at 550.\n\n           Here, the ICA applied the correct legal standard in its\n\nmemorandum opinion.     Specifically, the majority stated that\n\n“there need not be both one-sidedness and unfair surprise in\n\nreaching a determination that a marital agreement is\n\nunconscionable.”    The ICA concluded, however, that the quitclaim\n\ndeed was not “so outrageously oppressive as to be unconscionable\n\nin the absence of unfair surprise.”\n\n           Ray nevertheless argues that instead of applying the\n\nwell settled law, “the ICA held that a marital agreement is only\n\nenforceable if there is both one-sidedness and unfair surprise.”\n\nRay’s description of the ICA’s analysis does not accurately\n\ncharacterize the approach taken by that court.           The ICA did not\n\nhold that one-sidedness, without more, would never be enough to\n\nfind an agreement unconscionable.         Instead, the ICA concluded\n\nthat the deed was not so “one-sided that it is unconscionable\n\neven without a showing of unfair surprise.”          Thus, the ICA\n\nplainly applied the correct legal standard in considering the\n\nvalidity of the deed.\n\n           Ray also appears to argue that this legal standard is\n\noverly narrow.    According to Ray, “a marital agreement is\n\nunenforceable if it is one-sided,” and unconscionability in the\n\ncontext of marital agreements does not require a showing of\n\nunfair surprise.    Put another way, Ray appears to argue that a\n\n                                   -27-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nmarital agreement need not be exceptionally one-sided in order to\n\nbe unconscionable.      Ray further argues that requiring a showing\n\nof unfair surprise is absurd in the context of postmarital\n\nagreements because spouses “are in an obvious[ly] better position\n\nto be knowledgeable about their spouse’s financial condition.”\n\n            Ray’s arguments are without merit.         First, Ray does not\n\ncite to any cases invalidating a postmarital agreement solely on\n\nthe basis of that agreement being somewhat one-sided.10\n\nFurthermore, parties may have legitimate reasons for entering\n\ninto a somewhat one-sided postmarital agreement, and may do so\n\nknowingly and voluntarily.       Permitting the family court to\n\ninvalidate such agreements without requiring a showing of\n\nextraordinary one-sidedness would frustrate the purpose of HRS\n\n§ 572-22, which permits spouses to enter into enforceable\n\ncontracts with each other.\n\n            Accordingly, the ICA applied the correct legal standard\n\nin evaluating unconscionability.\n\n\n\n      10\n            Ray cited two cases involving unconscionability in divorce\nactions. The first, In re Marriage of Thomas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2358121\"><a href=\"/opinion/2358121/in-re-marriage-of-thomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">847</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 860 (Mo. App.\n2006), does not support Ray’s argument because the court there noted that\nparties are bound to the provisions of a pre-nuptial agreement “only if the\nagreement was conscionable and fairly made,” i.e., both substantively and\nprocedurally conscionable. Id. at 852 (emphasis added). Additionally, the\ncourt emphasized a similar standard of one-sidedness as that articulated by\nthe ICA: “An agreement is unconscionable when the inequality is so strong,\ngross, and manifest that it must be impossible to state it to one with common\nsense without producing an exclamation at the inequality of it.” Id.\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Similarly, in the second\ncase, In re Marriage of Manzo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1449387\"><a href=\"/opinion/1449387/in-re-marriage-of-manzo/\"><span class=\"volume\">659</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">669</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 671 (Colo. 1983), the court\nconsidered both whether the agreement was procured through “overreaching,\nfraud, concealment of assets, or sharp dealing,” and whether it was\nsubstantively “fair, just and reasonable.” Id. at 675.\n\n                                    -28-\n\f     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nC.     The MOU is not unconscionable\n\n               Ray argues that the marital agreements were one-sided\n\nand therefore unconscionable.11        In her response to this court,\n\nSandra agrees that it would be one-sided to award the Kahalakua\n\nproperty to her in its entirety pursuant to the deed.              Sandra\n\nargues, however, that the MOU is not “unjustly disproportionate”\n\nbecause Ray would receive 25% of the proceeds of the sale of the\n\nproperty, in addition to any cash accounts and retirement\n\nbenefits awarded by the family court.           (Citing Chen, 127 Hawai#i\n\nat 357, 279 P.3d at 22).\n\n               Although the family court did not address whether the\n\nMOU is unconscionable, this court may nonetheless reach the issue\n\nbecause unconscionability is a question of law, reviewable de\n\nnovo.       See, e.g., HRS § 490:2-302(1).      For the reasons set forth\n\nbelow, the MOU is not unconscionable with respect to the division\n\nof the Kahalakua property, nor is it unconscionable to the extent\n\nit required Ray to pay Sandra $100,000 in lieu of alimony.12                The\n\nMOU is therefore an enforceable marital agreement with regard to\n\nthese clauses.\n\n               Again, the terms of the MOU were as follows:\n\n\n\n       11\n            Nothing in the record suggests that Ray was surprised by the terms\nof the MOU, and Ray did not argue otherwise in his answering brief or\napplication. The only issue, therefore, is whether the MOU was so\nimpermissibly one-sided that it is unconscionable.\n      12\n            Although the MOU also addressed Ray’s tools and building\nequipment, the contents of the house, and the couple’s vehicles, the\ndisposition of those items is not being disputed by the parties.\n\n                                     -29-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\n                This Agreement between Donald Balogh and Sandra Balogh\n                will be implemented if they are to separate and/or\n                divorce from each other.\n\n                Their assets will be divided as follows:\n\n                . . . .\n\n                3. In regards to the proceeds of the house, due to a\n                sale: Sandy will receive 75% of the sale proceeds and\n                Ray will receive 25% of the proceeds.\n\n                4. In regards to compensation: Ray agrees to pay\n                $100,000.00 to Sandy in lieu of Alimony and court\n                proceedings.\n\n                Even if the allocation of the entire Kahalakua property\n\nto Sandra pursuant to the quitclaim deed could be characterized\n\nas so one-sided as to have been unconscionable, the 75%/25% split\n\nset forth in the MOU and the requirement that Ray pay $100,000 in\n\nlieu of alimony are not.           First, in addition to his share of the\n\nKahalakua property, Ray was entitled to an equitable share of the\n\ncouple’s other major assets, which totaled $760,000.13                   Second,\n\nalthough Ray will receive a lesser share of the proceeds under\n\nthe MOU than he would under the family court’s 50%/50% division\n\nof the property, such imbalance was the express purpose of the\n\nMOU.        As the family court found, “Sandra believed Ray would tell\n\nher the truth and stop his inappropriate behavior by signing the\n\nMOU.        Ray signed it in his desperate attempt to hold the marriage\n\ntogether.”        It is unlikely that the MOU would have been construed\n\nas demonstrative of Ray’s commitment to the marriage had it\n\n\n\n       13\n            The record does not indicate the exact values of Ray’s and\nSandra’s respective shares of their other assets. Based on the family court’s\ncalculations, however, it appears that Ray and Sandra each received about half\nof the other assets.\n\n                                        -30-\n\f     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nprovided for the same division of property Ray was likely to\n\nreceive in the family court under an equitable division upon\n\ndivorce.        Moreover, as noted above, “unless the agreement rises\n\nto the level of unconscionability, a merely ‘inequitable’\n\ncontract is not unenforceable under contract law.”             Lewis, 69\n\nHaw. at 500, 748 P.2d at 1365-66.           Accordingly, the 75%/25%\n\ndivision of the Kahalakua property and the $100,000 payment set\n\nforth in the MOU are not unconscionable.\n\nD.     The MOU was entered into voluntarily\n\n                Ray also argues that the ICA erred in vacating the\n\nfamily court’s decision because he did not enter into each of the\n\nmarital agreements voluntarily.         For the reasons set forth below,\n\nRay executed the MOU voluntarily.14\n\n                “Involuntariness is shown by evidence of ‘duress,\n\ncoercion, undue influence, or any other circumstance indicating\n\nlack of free will or voluntariness.’”           Chen, 127 Hawai#i at 357,\n\n279 P.3d at 22 (quoting Prell, 114 Hawai#i at 298, 162 P.3d at\n\n14).        Here, the family court concluded that Ray was “under duress\n\nand coercion when he signed the agreements” because of the\n\nongoing construction of the Kahalakua home, the contractor\n\nwalking off and the resulting mechanic’s lien, the penalties\n\nassessed by the homeowner’s association and the resulting\n\n\n       14\n            For the reasons stated above, this court need not address whether\nthe quitclaim deed was voluntarily executed. Moreover, because we conclude\nthat the MOU is enforceable, we do not consider the voluntariness of the\nOctober 6, 2008 agreement.\n\n                                     -31-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nlitigation, the demands of Ray’s job, the continuing issues with\n\nsubcontractors, and Ray’s uncontrollable obsessive behavior.                The\n\nfamily court’s factual findings, however, are not sufficient to\n\nsupport a conclusion that Ray signed the agreements under either\n\nduress or coercion.15\n\n            Duress is defined as “a threat of harm made to compel a\n\nperson to do something against his or her will or judgment;\n\n[especially], a wrongful threat made by one person to compel a\n\nmanifestation of seeming assent by another person to a\n\ntransaction without real volition.”         Black’s Law Dictionary 614\n\n(10th ed. 2014).     It is well established that an agreement is\n\nvoidable due to duress when “a party’s manifestation of assent is\n\ninduced by an improper threat by the other party that leaves the\n\nvictim no reasonable alternative.”         Standard Fin.

Rather, it simply identified a number of factors that\n\ncontributed to Ray’s “extreme distress,” ranging from problems\n\nwith the construction to “his uncontrollable obsessive behavior\n\nthat escalated from his backyard nudity to public display, his\n\nshame and embarrassment, his fear of being discovered, and the\n\nconstant argument with Sandra about his inappropriate behavior.”\n\nMoreover, Ray failed to establish that he had no reasonable\n\nalternative to signing the MOU.             Ray could have declined to sign\n\nthe MOU but still attempted to resolve his issues with Sandra in\n\n\n\n       17\n            At another point Ray appeared to deny that Sandra had threatened\nhim. However, this testimony was subject to an objection that was sustained\nby the court:\n\n                      Q. So was it –- was there a -– threat of divorce\n                or exposure to others--\n                      A. No.\n                      Q. –or --\n                             MR. HIOKI: Objection, leading, Your Honor.\n                             THE COURT: Getting there. Sustained.\n                Rephrase the question.\n\n(Emphasis added).\n            Sandra argues that because the answer was not stricken from the\nrecord, it is in evidence. Even assuming arguendo that Ray’s response can be\nconsidered, the fact remains that there was conflicting testimony on this\nissue, and the family court implicitly resolved those conflicts in Sandra’s\nfavor when it declined to find that she had threatened Ray.\n\n                                         -34-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nan effort to save the marriage.       In sum, because the family court\n\ndid not make a finding that Sandra had improperly threatened Ray,\n\nand since Ray had a reasonable alternative to signing the MOU,\n\nthe record does not support the family court’s conclusion that\n\nRay signed that agreement under duress.\n\n           The record also does not support a conclusion that the\n\nMOU was the result of coercion.       Coercion is defined as\n\n“[c]ompulsion of a free agent by physical, moral, or economic\n\nforce or threat of physical force.”        Black’s Law Dictionary 315\n\n(10th ed. 2014).    “Coercion sufficient to avoid a contract need\n\nnot . . . consist of physical force or threats of it.            Social or\n\neconomic pressure illegally or immorally applied may be\n\nsufficient.”   Billouris v. Billouris, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">852</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 693 (Mass.\n\nApp. Ct. 2006).    For all the reasons set forth above, the record\n\ndoes not support a conclusion that Sandra employed physical,\n\nmoral, or economic force to obtain Ray’s assent.\n\n           Although the family court found Ray was under stress\n\ndue to a variety of factors, those factors do not establish\n\neither duress or coercion.      Moreover, Ray cannot rely on those\n\nfactors to establish that he lacked mental capacity when he\n\nsigned the agreements, since he had specifically agreed prior to\n\ntrial that he was “not claiming lack of mental capacity as to any\n\nissue herein.”    Ray therefore executed the MOU voluntarily.\n\n           In sum, the record does not support the family court’s\n\nconclusion that Ray’s assent to the MOU was the product of duress\n\n                                   -35-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nand coercion.    The dissent does not dispute that analysis, but\n\nrather suggests that the family court did not intend to rely\n\nspecifically on those doctrines, as opposed to other potential\n\ngrounds for finding that Ray’s assent was involuntary.            See\n\nDissent at 10-24.    Respectfully, the family court’s Conclusion of\n\nLaw P quite specifically refers to “duress and coercion” as the\n\nbasis for invalidating the agreement, and the court’s\n\naccompanying citation to the Prell case implies that its reliance\n\non those two doctrines was intentional.\n\n           In any event, we respectfully disagree with the\n\ndissent’s contention that Ray did not enter into the MOU\n\nvoluntarily because his “mental state was extremely vulnerable”,\n\nhe was unduly influenced, and “other circumstances” demonstrate\n\ninvoluntariness.    Dissent at 15, 22-24, 17-22.         First, to the\n\nextent the dissent suggests that Ray’s “mental state” deprived\n\nhim of the capacity to contract, Ray explicitly agreed prior to\n\ntrial that he was not claiming a lack of mental capacity.\n\n           Second, the record does not establish that Ray was\n\nunduly influenced.     Undue influence is “[t]he improper use of\n\npower or trust in a way that deprives a person of free will and\n\nsubstitute’s another’s objective.”        Black’s Law Dictionary 1760\n\n(10th ed. 2014); Cvitanovich-Dubie v. Dubie, 125 Hawai#i 128,\n\n160, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"871210\"><a href=\"/opinion/871210/cvitanovich-dubie-v-dubie/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 471 (2011).       As a threshold matter, the family\n\ncourt did not find that Sandra exerted undue influence over Ray,\n\nand Ray does not argue otherwise in this court.           Moreover, the\n\n                                   -36-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nrecord does not support a conclusion that Sandra either attempted\n\nto impose or actually imposed improper influence on Ray.\n\n           Finally, there are no “other circumstances” indicating\n\na lack of free will on Ray’s part.        The dissent asserts that Ray\n\nwas motivated by saving the marriage and that Ray believed he had\n\nno other choice but to sign the agreements.          Dissent at 21.     The\n\nfacts of this case, however, do not support a conclusion that Ray\n\nexecuted the MOU involuntarily.       As noted above, Ray was well\n\neducated, with a bachelor’s and master’s degree in electrical\n\nengineering, and he held a high-level security clearance.             There\n\nis no suggestion in the record that Ray was unaware of what he\n\nwas doing, nor do the facts otherwise support a conclusion that\n\nthe MOU was the result of a lack of free will.           In fact, Ray\n\nexpressly testified that he agreed to all of the terms of the\n\nMOU.   While Ray was under stress from a number of sources, that\n\nstress is not sufficient to establish that the MOU was not\n\nentered into voluntarily.\n\n           The dissent also asserts that the MOU is voidable for a\n\nlack of consideration.      Dissent at 29.     The family court,\n\nhowever, made no findings or conclusions relating to the adequacy\n\nof consideration, and Ray has made no argument in this regard to\n\nthis court.   Thus we do not consider the issue.\n\n           We therefore vacate the family court’s conclusions of\n\nlaw N, P (in part), Q, and R.       We vacate conclusion of law N\n\nbecause the family court treated the quitclaim deed as a\n\n                                   -37-\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n\nseparation agreement.     We vacate conclusion of law P to the\n\nextent the family court concluded that Ray signed the agreements\n\nunder duress and coercion.      We vacate conclusion of law Q because\n\nthe family court concluded that the parties’ agreements were\n\nunenforceable.    Finally, we vacate conclusion of law R because it\n\nawarded Ray and Sandra each a fifty-percent interest in the\n\nKahalakua property.\n\n                             IV.   Conclusion\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, the ICA’s judgment is\n\nvacated, the family court’s divorce decree is vacated, and the\n\nfamily court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law are\n\naffirmed in part and vacated in part.         The case is remanded to\n\nthe family court for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\nRebecca A. Copeland                /s/ Mark E.
