The district court dismissed\nKing’s claims for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a\nclaim upon which relief can be granted, holding that the University of Texas\n\n       * Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th\nCir. R. 47.5.4.\n\f    Case: 12-20795    Document: 00512429000      Page: 2   Date Filed: 11/04/2013\n\n\n                                  No. 12-20795\n\nHealth Science Center-Houston (“UTHSCH” or “the Center”) is not subject to\nsuit under the FCA’s qui tam provisions and, in addition, is entitled to\nsovereign immunity. We AFFIRM.\n\n\n                       FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n      King is a former associate professor at UTHSCH. From 2001–2005, she\nserved in the Center’s Department of Internal Medicine. In 2005, she\naccepted a position in the Center’s Department of Pediatrics. In March of\n2001, King began working as a statistician and geneticist in a research lab\nunder Dr. Dianna M. Milewicz’s supervision. Milewicz’s research focused on\nthoracic aortic dissection. According to King’s complaint, she began to notice\ndiscrepancies in Milewicz’s data in 2004. King alleges that “[w]hen she began\nto bring these discrepancies to the attention of Milewicz, Milewicz began a\nretaliatory campaign against King that began with the writing of a false and\ndefamatory employee performance review.”\n      King filed suit on January 4, 2011, alleging that Milewicz falsified\nresearch data and results and failed to obtain her human research subjects’\nwritten informed consent. She claims that the fraud was in connection with\ngovernment-funded research and that Milewicz used falsified results in order\nto obtain federal funding. The Center is claimed to have defrauded the\nfederal government by, among other things, covering up Milewicz’s\nmisconduct relating to federal research grants. King also claims that the\nCenter retaliated against her for reporting this misconduct by hampering her\nresearch, relocating her to less favorable positions, and constructively firing\nher when she continued to raise concerns.\n      King’s complaint alleges that the Center’s actions constituted false\nclaims under the FCA because, among other things, it “failed to fully\n\n\n                                        2\n\f     Case: 12-20795      Document: 00512429000        Page: 3    Date Filed: 11/04/2013\n\n\n                                      No. 12-20795\n\ninvestigate and fraudulently covered up research misconduct by Milewicz in\nan effort to allow her and other researchers full access to federal grants for\nresearch.” King also asserts a private action for retaliation and wrongful\ntermination under the FCA’s anti-retaliation provision, 31 U.S.C. § 3730(h),\nbecause “UTHSCH demoted King in retaliation[,] . . . derailed any chance of\nKing becoming a tenured member of the faculty at UTHSCH[,] . . . and\nultimately terminated King as a result of her reports of research misconduct.”\nOn February 22, 2012, the United States filed notice that it was not\nintervening.\n      On May 9, 2012, UTHSCH moved to dismiss King’s complaint on three\nseparate grounds: (1) UTHSCH, as a state agency, is not subject to liability\nunder the FCA; (2) sovereign immunity bars King’s FCA claims; and (3)\nKing’s complaint did not comply with the particularity requirements of Rule\n9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The district court granted the\nCenter’s motion on October 31, 2012, dismissing the case in its entirety “for\nlack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which\nrelief can be granted.” 1 King appeals.\n\n\n                             STANDARD OF REVIEW\n      “We review a district court's ruling on a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss\nfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction de novo.” Raj v. La. State Univ., 714\nF.3d 322, 327 (5th Cir. 2013). This court also “review[s] a district court’s\ndismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) de novo, accepting all well-pleaded facts as true\nand viewing those facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.” Doe ex\nrel. Magee v. Covington Cnty. Sch. Dist. ex rel. Keys, 675 F.3d 849, 854 (5th\n\n\n      1  Because the district court focused on the Center’s sovereign immunity and whether\nit was subject to suit under the FCA’s qui tam provisions, it did not address UTHSCH’s\narguments under Rule 9(b).\n                                            3\n\f    Case: 12-20795     Document: 00512429000     Page: 4    Date Filed: 11/04/2013\n\n\n                                  No. 12-20795\n\nCir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). Finally, “sovereign immunity\nis a question of law which this court reviews de novo.” Koehler v. United\nStates, 153 F.3d 263, 265 (5th Cir. 1998); see also Khan v. S. Univ. & Agric. &\nMech. Coll. Bd. of Supervisors, No. 03-30169, 2005 WL 1994301, at *2 (5th\nCir. Aug. 19, 2005).\n\n\n                                 DISCUSSION\n      King challenges the district court’s dismissal of her qui tam claim\nbased on its finding that UTHSCH is an “arm of the state,” its holding that\nthe Center is entitled to sovereign immunity from her retaliation claim, and\nits dismissal of her complaint without first granting King an opportunity to\namend. UTHSCH claims that this court lacks jurisdiction over King’s appeal\nbecause she failed to timely file her notice of appeal and, as a matter of law,\ndid not show excusable neglect or good cause in her request for an extension\nof time.\n\n\nI. Timeliness of King’s Appeal\n      “[T]he taking of an appeal within the prescribed time is mandatory and\njurisdictional.”   Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 209 (2007) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Under 28 U.S.C. § 2107(a), parties must file notice\nof appeal “within thirty days after the entry of [any civil] judgment, order or\ndecree.” See also Fed. R. App. Proc. 4(a)(1)(A). But “[t]he district court may,\nupon motion filed not later than 30 days after the expiration of the time\notherwise set for bringing appeal, extend the time for appeal upon a showing\nof excusable neglect or good cause.” 28 U.S.C. § 2107(c).\n      The district court entered its order of dismissal on October 31, 2012.\nKing filed her notice of appeal, along with a motion for extension of time\n\n\n                                       4\n\f    Case: 12-20795    Document: 00512429000     Page: 5   Date Filed: 11/04/2013\n\n\n                                 No. 12-20795\n\npursuant to Federal Rule of Procedure 4(a)(5), on December 5, 2012, thirty-\nfive days later. Although she acknowledges that her appeal was late, she\nargues there was “excusable neglect” because her attorneys initially believed\nthat because the United States was the “real party in interest” in FCA qui\ntam actions, Rule 4(a)(1)(B) applied, giving them sixty days to file the notice\nof appeal. Her attorneys had busy trial dockets during November, and did\nnot realize until early December that, under United States ex rel. Eisenstein\nv. City of New York, 556 U.S. 928 (2009), the thirty-day deadline for filing a\nnotice of appeal applies in FCA qui tam actions in which the United States\nhas not intervened.\n      The Fifth Circuit follows the Supreme Court’s guidance in determining\nwhen to permit extensions of time under Rule 4(a)(5).\n      When evaluating excusable neglect under Rule 4(a)(5), this court\n      relies on the following standard:\n\n      The determination is at bottom an equitable one, taking account\n      all of the relevant circumstances surrounding the party’s\n      omission. These include . . . the danger of prejudice . . . , the\n      length of the delay and its potential impact on judicial\n      proceedings, the reason for the delay, including whether it was\n      within the reasonable control of the movant, and whether the\n      movant acted in good faith.\n\nStotter v. Univ. of Tex. at San Antonio, 508 F.3d 812, 820 (5th Cir. 2007)\n(quoting Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd., 507 U.S. 380, 395\n(1993)). We review a ruling on a Rule 4(a)(5) motion for excusable neglect for\nabuse of discretion. Id.\n      UTHSCH claims that the district court abused its discretion by\nallowing King’s Rule 4(a)(5) extension. The Center cites two cases for the\npropositions that neither ignorance of the rules nor counsel’s busy law\npractice is sufficient to establish excusable neglect, Pioneer, 507 U.S. at 395,\n\n                                       5\n\f     Case: 12-20795       Document: 00512429000          Page: 6      Date Filed: 11/04/2013\n\n\n                                        No. 12-20795\n\nand ignorance of the law does not excuse the failure to comply with a\ndeadline that is unambiguous. Halicki v. La. Casino Cruises, Inc., 151 F.3d\n465, 470 (5th Cir. 1998).\n        The Center overstates Pioneer’s holding.              The Court held only that\ncounsels’ failure to file on time could be imputed to their clients, and did not\ncreate rigid rules forbidding extensions of time based on ignorance of the\nrules or an attorney’s workload. Pioneer, 507 U.S. at 397–98. Indeed, the\nPioneer court focused on “the respondents’ good faith and the absence of any\ndanger of prejudice . . . or of disruption to efficient judicial administration\nposed by the late filings.” Id. at 397. The delay here was only five days and\ndid not prejudice UTHSCH. Pioneer does not compel us to find an abuse of\ndiscretion in the district court’s grant of King’s motion for an extension of\ntime.\n        Nor does our opinion in Halicki foreclose a finding of excusable neglect\nin this case.         In Halicki, we rejected a litigant’s contention “that\nmisconstruction of procedural rules necessarily should result in a finding of\n‘excusable neglect’ where no prejudice results to the opposing party.” Halicki,\n151 F.3d at 469 (emphasis in original).                       We did not hold that\nmisinterpretation of the rules could never constitute excusable neglect. And\nalthough we stated that “a district court’s determination that the neglect was\ninexcusable     is   virtually     unassailable”      when     “the    rule   at   issue    is\nunambiguous,” id. at 470, this observation does not control our review of a\ndistrict court’s finding that the neglect was excusable. 2\n\n        2We also agree with the district court’s finding that “Rule 4(a)(1)(B)’s language\npermitting a notice of appeal to be filed within 60 days of the trial court’s judgment when\nthe United States is a party to the case is ambiguous in the context of FCA qui tam\nactions.” Although King’s counsel should have known that Eisenstein held the 30-day rule\nto apply to FCA qui tam actions, “‘excusable neglect’ is understood to encompass situations\nin which the failure to comply with a filing deadline is attributable to negligence.” Pioneer,\n507 U.S. at 394.\n                                              6\n\f    Case: 12-20795     Document: 00512429000     Page: 7   Date Filed: 11/04/2013\n\n\n                                  No. 12-20795\n\n      “Given the leeway granted to district courts” when evaluating\nexcusable neglect, Stotter, 508 F.3d at 820, we hold that the district court did\nnot abuse its discretion in granting King’s motion for an extension of time to\nfile her notice of appeal.\n\n\nII. Ability to Sue UTHSCH Under the FCA’s Qui Tam Provision\n      The FCA imposes liability to “any person who . . . knowingly presents,\nor causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or\napproval” or “knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false\nrecord or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim.”          31 U.S.C\n§ 3729(a)(1)(A)–(B) (emphasis added). In Stevens, the Supreme Court held\n“that the False Claims Act does not subject a State (or state agency) to\nliability” because neither a state nor state agency falls within the FCA’s\ndefinition of a “person.” Vt. Agency of Natural Res. v. U.S. ex rel. Stevens, 529\nU.S. 765, 787–88 (2000).\n      King argues that the district court erred in dismissing her qui tam\nclaims “by erroneously concluding that UTHSCH is an arm of the State of\nTexas and thus . . . not a ‘person’ who can be liable under the federal False\nClaims Act.” In her opening brief, King states also that “[t]he Stevens case\nwas wrongly decided,” that it “created an unwarranted exception to the FCA\nfor states and state agencies,” and that “[i]t is error to dismiss the qui tam\nclaims against UTHSCH when Stevens should instead be reversed.” Because\nwe lack the authority to reverse Supreme Court decisions, we focus instead\non her arguments that UTHSCH is not an “arm of the state.”\n      In Stevens, the Supreme Court stated that in cases where defendants\nmove for dismissal on both statutory and Eleventh Amendment grounds,\ncourts should address the statutory question first:\n\n\n                                       7\n\f    Case: 12-20795    Document: 00512429000      Page: 8   Date Filed: 11/04/2013\n\n\n                                  No. 12-20795\n\n      We . . . have routinely addressed before the question whether the\n      Eleventh Amendment forbids a particular statutory cause of\n      action to be asserted against States, the question whether the\n      statute itself permits the cause of action it creates to be asserted\n      against States (which it can do only by clearly expressing such\n      an intent). When these two questions are at issue, not only is\n      the statutory question “logically antecedent to the existence of”\n      the Eleventh Amendment question, but also there is no realistic\n      possibility that addressing the statutory question will expand\n      the Court’s power beyond the limits that the jurisdictional\n      restriction has imposed.\n\nStevens, 529 U.S. at 779 (internal citations omitted). Pursuant to Stevens, we\naddress first whether the FCA allows for King’s suit against the UTHSCH.\n      As did the district court, we evaluate whether the Center is an arm of\nthe state using the six-factor test set forth in Clark v. Tarrant County, Texas,\n798 F.2d 736, 744–45 (5th Cir. 1986).       Although Clark’s arm-of-the-state\nanalysis took place in the context of determining Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity, we have applied its test when determining whether an entity was\nsubject to FCA liability. See U.S. ex rel. Adrian v. Regents of Univ. of Calif.,\n363 F.3d 398, 401 (5th Cir. 2004).\n      In deciding whether a suit against an entity is in reality a suit\n      against the state, several factors must be determined: (1)\n      whether the state statutes and caselaw characterize the agency\n      as an arm of the state; (2) the source of funds for the entity; (3)\n      the degree of local autonomy the entity enjoys; (4) whether the\n      entity is concerned primarily with local, as opposed to statewide\n      problems; (5) whether the entity has authority to sue and be sued\n      in its own name; and (6) whether the entity has the right to hold\n      and use property.\n\nKhan, 2005 WL 1994301, at *2; see also Richardson v. S. Univ., 118 F.3d 450,\n452 (5th Cir. 1997). We address each factor in turn.\n\n\nA. Texas Statutes and Caselaw\n\n                                        8\n\f    Case: 12-20795     Document: 00512429000      Page: 9   Date Filed: 11/04/2013\n\n\n                                   No. 12-20795\n\n      A survey of Texas statutes and caselaw reveals that the first Clark\nfactor weighs in favor of finding UTHSCH an arm of the state. The state\nconstitution provides for the establishment of the University of Texas\nSystem.    Tex. Const. art. VII, § 10 (“The Legislature shall as soon as\npracticable establish, organize and provide for the maintenance, support and\ndirection of a University of the first class, to be located by a vote of the people\nof this State, and styled ‘The University of Texas’, for the promotion of\nliterature, and the arts and sciences.”). The Center is part of the University\nof Texas System.     Tex. Educ. Code § 65.02(a) (“The University of Texas\nSystem is composed of the following institutions and entities: . . . (9) The\nUniversity of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.”).          Texas statutes\nconsider “a [public] university system or an institution of higher education” to\nbe a “state agency.” Tex. Gov’t Code § 572.002(10)(B).\n      Texas courts also treat UTHSCH to be a state agency.            In Klein v.\nHernandez, 315 S.W.3d 1, 8 (Tex. 2010), the Texas Supreme Court held that a\nresident was an “employee of a state agency” in finding him entitled to\nimmunity. See also id. at 6 (referencing legislative materials referring to\nUTHSCH as “a state agency-owned school”).         In Illoh v. Carroll, No. 14-09-\n01001-CV, 2012 WL 1570991, at *1 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] May 3,\n2012, no pet. h.), a Texas Court of Appeals referred to the “governmental-\nentity University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston” when\nevaluating whether the Texas Tort Claims Act’s limited waiver of immunity\napplied to a UTHSCH doctor. In Cheatham, the court referred to “UTHSCH,\na governmental unit” when reviewing claims against “two UTHSCH-\nemployed doctors.” Univ. of Tex. Health Sci. Ctr. at Hous. v. Cheatham, 357\nS.W.3d 747, 748 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2011, review denied). The\nopinion goes on to refer to the defendants as “government-employed doctor[s]”\n\n\n                                        9\n\f   Case: 12-20795    Document: 00512429000      Page: 10   Date Filed: 11/04/2013\n\n\n                                 No. 12-20795\n\nand reviews statutory provisions governing the conduct of “government\nemployee[s].” Id. at 749.\n      King argues that these cases “never actually characterize UTHSCH as\nan ‘arm of the state,’” that Klein never directly implicated UTHSCH or\nsovereign immunity, and that other cases referring to the Center as a\n“governmental unit” are meaningless because that term is much broader\nthan what is required for finding an entity to be an “arm of the state.” We\nacknowledge that there does not appear to be any case that evaluates all six\nClark factors and finds the Center to be an arm of the state for either FCA or\nsovereign immunity purposes.     But we do not read Clark’s first factor as\nrequiring an entity claiming sovereign immunity to first identify on-point\ncourt decisions evaluating the issue and holding it to be entitled to sovereign\nimmunity. If that were the case, we would not need a six-factor test.\n      We find the aforementioned Texas authorities to weigh in favor of\nUTHSCH being an arm of the state.\n\n\nB. Sources of Funding\n      According to King, “[f]rom 2005 until 2009, state funding and federal\nfunding have contributed an approximately equal percentage of the revenue\ncollected by UTH[S]CH” and “[s]tate funding has only contributed between\n23% and 26.5% of the gross revenue for UTHSCH from 2005 to 2009.”\nDespite King’s attempts to downplay state funding’s importance, the\nmagnitudes are substantial. The district court noted that in 2009, UTHSCH\ntook in more than $26 million from student tuition and fees, received about\n$170 million in direct state appropriations, and received over $25 million\nfrom other state agencies.\n\n\n\n\n                                      10\n\f   Case: 12-20795    Document: 00512429000      Page: 11   Date Filed: 11/04/2013\n\n\n                                 No. 12-20795\n\n      King asserts that despite the significant amounts of state funding,\nUTHSCH would be unable to reach into segregated state funds in order to\npay a judgment here because the Center’s federal and state funding are\n“strictly and carefully segregated,” with state funding only available to\nsupport state-funded missions. We disagree.\n      “[T]he most significant factor in assessing an entity’s status is whether\na judgment against it will be paid with state funds.” Richardson, 118 F.3d at\n455 (quoting McDonald v. Bd. of Miss. Levee Comm’rs, 832 F.2d 901, 907 (5th\nCir. 1987)). But this does not mean we can find sovereign immunity or an\narm of the state only “where payment would be directly out of the state\ntreasury.” United Carolina Bank v. Bd. of Regents of Stephen F. Austin State\nUniv., 665 F.2d 553, 560 (5th Cir. Unit A 1982). “The crucial question . . . is\nwhether use of . . . unappropriated funds to pay a damage award . . . would\ninterfere with the fiscal autonomy and political sovereignty of Texas.” Id. at\n560–61.\n      The district court in United Carolina found that the Eleventh\nAmendment did not bar suit against Stephen F. Austin State University\n(“SFA”) in part because “SFA could itself pay such an award because it had\nsubstantial unappropriated, separately held, locally generated funds” and, as\na result, “payment of an award c[ould] be made without resort to general\nrevenues of the state or legislative appropriation.”       Id. at 559–60.    We\nreversed, holding that “[t]he key is not the ability to identify segregated\nfunds, but the larger concept of jurisdiction over state sovereignty which the\neleventh amendment proscribes.” Id. at 560. We found that the SFA’s local\nfunds were “either held in the Treasury or restricted as to use,” were “subject\nto audit and budget planning,” and as a result “any award from those funds\nwould directly interfere with the state’s fiscal autonomy.” Id. at 561.\n\n\n                                       11\n\f   Case: 12-20795     Document: 00512429000     Page: 12   Date Filed: 11/04/2013\n\n\n                                 No. 12-20795\n\n      Similarly, in Jagnandan v. Giles, we held that tuition refunds would\nimplicate the state treasury. 538 F.2d 1166 (5th Cir. 1976). The tuition “fees\nwere factored into the preparation of the annual budget for [Mississippi State\nUniversity] and were relied upon by the state legislature in determining the\nmaximum amount of expenditures allowed.” Id. at 1176. The refunds would\nhave “add[ed] an expenditure not figured in the budget.” Id. We explained:\n      The Eleventh Amendment was fashioned to protect against\n      federal judgments requiring payment of money that would\n      interfere with the state’s fiscal autonomy and thus its political\n      sovereignty. Retroactive monetary relief . . . would have just that\n      effect. Mississippi has devised a complex statutory design which\n      governs the state’s schools of higher education and their control\n      by the Board of Trustees. The Board is required to submit\n      budgetary proposals for legislative acceptance. To require refund\n      payments from the Board for overpayment of tuition fees would\n      be the kind of tampering the Eleventh Amendment sought to\n      avoid.\n\nId. (footnote omitted).\n      We hold that Texas provides substantial funding to the Center and that\nallowing for civil recovery would interfere with the state’s fiscal autonomy,\neven if payment is not made directly from the state treasury. Clark’s second\nfactor supports finding UTHSCH to be an arm of the state.\n\n\nC. Degree of Local Autonomy and Right to Hold and Use Property\n      A board of regents, appointed by the governor with the advice and\nconsent of the senate, governs the University of Texas System, and\n“govern[s], operate[s], support[s], and maintain[s] each of the component\ninstitutions.” Tex. Educ. Code §§ 65.11, 65.31. All UTHSCH contracts must\nbe in accordance with board rules or specially approved by the board of\nregents. Id. § 65.35. As a state agency, the Center is required to follow\n\n\n                                      12\n\f    Case: 12-20795     Document: 00512429000     Page: 13   Date Filed: 11/04/2013\n\n\n                                  No. 12-20795\n\nspecific accounting and financial reporting requirements. Tex. Gov’t Code §\n2101.011(b).\n         With respect to UTHSCH’s right to hold and use property, “[t]he board\nof regents of the University of Texas System has the sole and exclusive\nmanagement and control of the lands set aside and appropriated to, or\nacquired by, The University of Texas System.” Tex. Educ. Code § 65.39. “The\nboard has the power of eminent domain to acquire for the use of the\nuniversity system any land that may be necessary and proper for carrying\nout its purposes. . . . The taking of the property is declared to be for the use\nof the state.” Id. § 65.33\n         We find that Clark’s third and sixth factors support finding UTHSCH\nto be an arm of the state.\n\n\nD. Local vs. Statewide Concerns\n         The University of Texas System, of which UTHSCH is a part, has\nlocations throughout the state of Texas. We do not accept King’s contention\nthat the Center is primarily concerned with local issues because it “does not\nprovide statewide services or have a statewide presence” since “[a]ll of its\nfacilities are in Houston.” Education and research are statewide concerns.\nSee e.g., Tex. Educ. Code § 61.002 (Texas Higher Education Board created to\n“benefit the citizens of the state in terms of the realization of the benefits of\nan educated populace”); Richardson, 118 F.3d at 455–56 & n.15 (“That\nSouthern is only one of many state-funded schools does not deprive it of\nEleventh Amendment immunity.”).\n         Clark’s fourth factor supports finding UTHSCH to be an arm of the\nstate.\n\n\n\n\n                                       13\n\f    Case: 12-20795       Document: 00512429000         Page: 14     Date Filed: 11/04/2013\n\n\n                                       No. 12-20795\n\nE. Authority to Sue and Be Sued in its Own Name\n       Texas law provides for the University of Texas System’s ability to sue\non behalf of a component institution “to recover a delinquent loan, account, or\ndebt owed.” Tex. Educ. Code § 65.42. Texas statutory law does not appear to\nauthorize the Center to bring suit or allow plaintiffs to sue UTHSCH directly.\n       Nonetheless, King identifies several cases in which UTHSCH either\nsued or was sued, and in none of them did it object to proceeding in its own\nname or insist that the University of Texas System be substituted in its\nstead. See Duncan v. Univ. of Tex. Health Sci. Ctr. at Hous., 469 F. App’x 364\n(5th Cir. 2012); Watson v. Univ. of Tex. Health Sci. Ctr. at Hous., No. H-09-\n0881, 2009 WL 1476469 (S.D. Tex. May 27, 2009); Butcher v. Univ. of Tex.\nHealth Sci. Ctr. at Hous., No. H-08-cv-0244, 2008 WL 4935723 (S.D. Tex.\nNov. 18, 2008); Cheatham, 357 S.W.3d 747. The number of cases in which\nthe Center is a named party leads us to conclude that, for arm-of-the-state\npurposes, it has the authority to sue and be sued in its own name. 3\n       Clark’s fifth factor weighs against finding UTHSCH to be an arm of the\nstate. But because five out of the six Clark factors weigh in favor of finding\nthe Center to be one, we conclude that UTHSCH is an arm of the state and\nthat Stevens applies. UTHSCH is not a “person” under the FCA, and is not\nsubject to qui tam liability. We affirm the district court’s dismissal of King’s\nqui tam claim under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim under the FCA.\n\n\n\n3We note that these cases focusing on an entity’s ability to sue or be sued are usually\nwithin the context of determining whether a state has waived immunity. As noted above,\nthe arm-of-the-state test was developed for sovereign immunity purposes. A recent Fourth\nCircuit decision case applied a four-factor test that excludes “the authority to sue and be\nsued in its own name” from the analysis. U.S. ex rel. Oberg v. Ky. Higher Educ. Student\nLoan Corp., 681 F.3d 575, 580 (4th Cir. 2012); see also S.C. Dep’t of Disabilities & Special\nNeeds v. Hoover Universal, Inc., 535 F.3d 300, 303 (4th Cir. 2008). Because our result\nwould be the same under either our current test or the Fourth Circuit’s, there is no need to\nchange our test.\n                                             14\n\f   Case: 12-20795     Document: 00512429000     Page: 15   Date Filed: 11/04/2013\n\n\n                                 No. 12-20795\n\nIII. Retaliation Claim\n      King sues UTHSCH for retaliation pursuant to the FCA’s anti-\nretaliation provision, 31 U.S.C. § 3730(h).      In relevant part, § 3730(h)\nprovides that:\n      Any employee, contractor, or agent shall be entitled to all relief\n      necessary to make that employee, contractor, or agent whole, if\n      that employee, contractor, or agent is discharged, demoted,\n      suspended, threatened, harassed, or in any other manner\n      discriminated against in the terms and conditions of employment\n      because of lawful acts done by the employee, contractor, agent or\n      associated others in furtherance of an action under this section or\n      other efforts to stop 1 or more violations of this subchapter.\n\n\nCongress amended this section in 2009. The previous version stated that\n“[a]ny employee who is discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened,\nharassed, or in any other manner discriminated against in the terms and\nconditions of employment by his or her employer . . . shall be entitled to all\nrelief necessary to make the employee whole.” (Emphasis added.)\n      In Elizondo, a district court applied Stevens’s holding that states and\nstate agencies are not within the FCA’s definition of “any person” to the older\nversion of § 3730(h)’s use of the phrase “his or her employer” and held that\nstates are not subject to suit under § 3730(h). Elizondo v. Univ. of Tex. at\nSan Antonio, No. CIVASA-04-CA-1025-XR, 2005 WL 823353, at *4–5 (W.D.\nTex. Apr. 7, 2005).      But the amendment to § 3730(h) prevents us from\napplying Elizondo’s analysis here. See Bell v. Dean, No. 2:09-CV-1082-WKW,\n2010 WL 1856086, at *4 (M.D. Ala. May 4, 2010) (“Elizondo and the other\ncases are no longer on all fours . . . given the 2009 amendment removing the\nword ‘employer’ from the statute”).    Unlike the Court in Stevens, we are\nunable to resolve all of our case’s issues on statutory grounds, and must\n\n\n\n                                      15\n\f    Case: 12-20795       Document: 00512429000         Page: 16     Date Filed: 11/04/2013\n\n\n                                       No. 12-20795\n\nreview the Center’s argument that it is entitled to sovereign immunity from\nFCA anti-retaliation claims.\n       “Congress may abrogate the States’ constitutionally secured immunity\nfrom suit in federal court only by making its intention unmistakably clear in\nthe language of the statute.” Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U.S. 223, 228 (1989)\n(quoting Atascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 242 (1985)). In\nFoulds, we held that the Eleventh Amendment barred a qui tam action\nseeking damages against Texas Tech University and Texas Tech University\nHealth Sciences Center. U.S. ex rel. Foulds v. Tex. Tech Univ., 171 F.3d 279,\n294–95 (5th Cir. 1999); see also Nelson v. Univ. of Tex. at Dall., 535 F.3d 318,\n320 (5th Cir. 2008) (FMLA action against University of Texas at Dallas\n“subject to an Eleventh Amendment immunity defense”).\n       King does not argue that § 3730 intends to strip states of their\nsovereign immunity, or any other reason to find that Congress abrogated\nsovereign immunity here. Rather, she applies her arguments against finding\nUTHSCH to be an arm of the state in the statutory context to the sovereign\nimmunity inquiry as well. We apply our finding that UTHSCH is an arm of\nthe state and hold that sovereign immunity bars King’s claim for monetary\nrelief under the FCA’s anti-retaliation provision.\n       We affirm the district court’s dismissal of King’s retaliation claim\nunder Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\n\n                                    CONCLUSION\n       We AFFIRM the district court’s dismissal of King’s suit. 4\n\n4 King challenges the district court’s dismissal of her complaint without first granting her\nleave to amend. Because we affirm the district court’s dismissal based on our holding that\nUTHSCH is an arm of the state and not because of any pleading deficiency under Rule\n12(b)(6) or Rule 9(b), amendment would be futile. We find no error in the district court’s\ndecision not to grant leave to amend before dismissing King’s case.\n                                             16\n\f",

We AFFIRM.\n\n\n                       FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n      King is a former associate professor at UTHSCH. From 2001–2005, she\nserved in the Center’s Department of Internal Medicine. In 2005, she\naccepted a position in the Center’s Department of Pediatrics. In March of\n2001, King began working as a statistician and geneticist in a research lab\nunder Dr. Dianna M. Milewicz’s supervision. Milewicz’s research focused on\nthoracic aortic dissection. According to King’s complaint, she began to notice\ndiscrepancies in Milewicz’s data in 2004. King alleges that “[w]hen she began\nto bring these discrepancies to the attention of Milewicz, Milewicz began a\nretaliatory campaign against King that began with the writing of a false and\ndefamatory employee performance review.”\n      King filed suit on January 4, 2011, alleging that Milewicz falsified\nresearch data and results and failed to obtain her human research subjects’\nwritten informed consent. She claims that the fraud was in connection with\ngovernment-funded research and that Milewicz used falsified results in order\nto obtain federal funding. The Center is claimed to have defrauded the\nfederal government by, among other things, covering up Milewicz’s\nmisconduct relating to federal research grants. King also claims that the\nCenter retaliated against her for reporting this misconduct by hampering her\nresearch, relocating her to less favorable positions, and constructively firing\nher when she continued to raise concerns.\n      King’s complaint alleges that the Center’s actions constituted false\nclaims under the FCA because, among other things, it “failed to fully\n\n\n                                        2\n\f     Case: 12-20795      Document: 00512429000        Page: 3    Date Filed: 11/04/2013\n\n\n                                      No. 12-20795\n\ninvestigate and fraudulently covered up research misconduct by Milewicz in\nan effort to allow her and other researchers full access to federal grants for\nresearch.” King also asserts a private action for retaliation and wrongful\ntermination under the FCA’s anti-retaliation provision, 31 U.S.C. § 3730(h),\nbecause “UTHSCH demoted King in retaliation[,] . . . derailed any chance of\nKing becoming a tenured member of the faculty at UTHSCH[,] . . . and\nultimately terminated King as a result of her reports of research misconduct.”\nOn February 22, 2012, the United States filed notice that it was not\nintervening.\n      On May 9, 2012, UTHSCH moved to dismiss King’s complaint on three\nseparate grounds: (1) UTHSCH, as a state agency, is not subject to liability\nunder the FCA; (2) sovereign immunity bars King’s FCA claims; and (3)\nKing’s complaint did not comply with the particularity requirements of Rule\n9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The district court granted the\nCenter’s motion on October 31, 2012, dismissing the case in its entirety “for\nlack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which\nrelief can be granted.” 1 King appeals.\n\n\n                             STANDARD OF REVIEW\n      “We review a district court's ruling on a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss\nfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction de novo.” Raj v.

The Court held only that\ncounsels’ failure to file on time could be imputed to their clients, and did not\ncreate rigid rules forbidding extensions of time based on ignorance of the\nrules or an attorney’s workload. Pioneer, 507 U.S. at 397–98. Indeed, the\nPioneer court focused on “the respondents’ good faith and the absence of any\ndanger of prejudice . . . or of disruption to efficient judicial administration\nposed by the late filings.” Id. at 397. The delay here was only five days and\ndid not prejudice UTHSCH. Pioneer does not compel us to find an abuse of\ndiscretion in the district court’s grant of King’s motion for an extension of\ntime.\n        Nor does our opinion in Halicki foreclose a finding of excusable neglect\nin this case.         In Halicki, we rejected a litigant’s contention “that\nmisconstruction of procedural rules necessarily should result in a finding of\n‘excusable neglect’ where no prejudice results to the opposing party.” Halicki,\n151 F.3d at 469 (emphasis in original).                       We did not hold that\nmisinterpretation of the rules could never constitute excusable neglect. And\nalthough we stated that “a district court’s determination that the neglect was\ninexcusable     is   virtually     unassailable”      when     “the    rule   at   issue    is\nunambiguous,” id. at 470, this observation does not control our review of a\ndistrict court’s finding that the neglect was excusable. 2\n\n        2We also agree with the district court’s finding that “Rule 4(a)(1)(B)’s language\npermitting a notice of appeal to be filed within 60 days of the trial court’s judgment when\nthe United States is a party to the case is ambiguous in the context of FCA qui tam\nactions.” Although King’s counsel should have known that Eisenstein held the 30-day rule\nto apply to FCA qui tam actions, “‘excusable neglect’ is understood to encompass situations\nin which the failure to comply with a filing deadline is attributable to negligence.” Pioneer,\n507 U.S. at 394.\n                                              6\n\f    Case: 12-20795     Document: 00512429000     Page: 7   Date Filed: 11/04/2013\n\n\n                                  No. 12-20795\n\n      “Given the leeway granted to district courts” when evaluating\nexcusable neglect, Stotter, 508 F.3d at 820, we hold that the district court did\nnot abuse its discretion in granting King’s motion for an extension of time to\nfile her notice of appeal.\n\n\nII. Ability to Sue UTHSCH Under the FCA’s Qui Tam Provision\n      The FCA imposes liability to “any person who . . . knowingly presents,\nor causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or\napproval” or “knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false\nrecord or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim.”          31 U.S.C\n§ 3729(a)(1)(A)–(B) (emphasis added). In Stevens, the Supreme Court held\n“that the False Claims Act does not subject a State (or state agency) to\nliability” because neither a state nor state agency falls within the FCA’s\ndefinition of a “person.” Vt.

When these two questions are at issue, not only is\n      the statutory question “logically antecedent to the existence of”\n      the Eleventh Amendment question, but also there is no realistic\n      possibility that addressing the statutory question will expand\n      the Court’s power beyond the limits that the jurisdictional\n      restriction has imposed.\n\nStevens, 529 U.S. at 779 (internal citations omitted).

The state\nconstitution provides for the establishment of the University of Texas\nSystem.    Tex. Const. art. VII, § 10 (“The Legislature shall as soon as\npracticable establish, organize and provide for the maintenance, support and\ndirection of a University of the first class, to be located by a vote of the people\nof this State, and styled ‘The University of Texas’, for the promotion of\nliterature, and the arts and sciences.”). The Center is part of the University\nof Texas System.     Tex. Educ. Code § 65.02(a) (“The University of Texas\nSystem is composed of the following institutions and entities: . . . (9) The\nUniversity of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.”).          Texas statutes\nconsider “a [public] university system or an institution of higher education” to\nbe a “state agency.” Tex. Gov’t Code § 572.002(10)(B).\n      Texas courts also treat UTHSCH to be a state agency.            In Klein v.\nHernandez, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 8 (Tex. 2010), the Texas Supreme Court held that a\nresident was an “employee of a state agency” in finding him entitled to\nimmunity. See also id. at 6 (referencing legislative materials referring to\nUTHSCH as “a state agency-owned school”).         In Illoh v.

But we do not read Clark’s first factor as\nrequiring an entity claiming sovereign immunity to first identify on-point\ncourt decisions evaluating the issue and holding it to be entitled to sovereign\nimmunity. If that were the case, we would not need a six-factor test.\n      We find the aforementioned Texas authorities to weigh in favor of\nUTHSCH being an arm of the state.\n\n\nB. Sources of Funding\n      According to King, “[f]rom 2005 until 2009, state funding and federal\nfunding have contributed an approximately equal percentage of the revenue\ncollected by UTH[S]CH” and “[s]tate funding has only contributed between\n23% and 26.5% of the gross revenue for UTHSCH from 2005 to 2009.”\nDespite King’s attempts to downplay state funding’s importance, the\nmagnitudes are substantial. The district court noted that in 2009, UTHSCH\ntook in more than $26 million from student tuition and fees, received about\n$170 million in direct state appropriations, and received over $25 million\nfrom other state agencies.\n\n\n\n\n                                      10\n\f   Case: 12-20795    Document: 00512429000      Page: 11   Date Filed: 11/04/2013\n\n\n                                 No. 12-20795\n\n      King asserts that despite the significant amounts of state funding,\nUTHSCH would be unable to reach into segregated state funds in order to\npay a judgment here because the Center’s federal and state funding are\n“strictly and carefully segregated,” with state funding only available to\nsupport state-funded missions. We disagree.\n      “[T]he most significant factor in assessing an entity’s status is whether\na judgment against it will be paid with state funds.” Richardson, 118 F.3d at\n455 (quoting McDonald v.

Unit A 1982). “The crucial question . . . is\nwhether use of . . . unappropriated funds to pay a damage award . . . would\ninterfere with the fiscal autonomy and political sovereignty of Texas.” Id. at\n560–61.\n      The district court in United Carolina found that the Eleventh\nAmendment did not bar suit against Stephen F. Austin State University\n(“SFA”) in part because “SFA could itself pay such an award because it had\nsubstantial unappropriated, separately held, locally generated funds” and, as\na result, “payment of an award c[ould] be made without resort to general\nrevenues of the state or legislative appropriation.”       Id. at 559–60.    We\nreversed, holding that “[t]he key is not the ability to identify segregated\nfunds, but the larger concept of jurisdiction over state sovereignty which the\neleventh amendment proscribes.” Id. at 560. We found that the SFA’s local\nfunds were “either held in the Treasury or restricted as to use,” were “subject\nto audit and budget planning,” and as a result “any award from those funds\nwould directly interfere with the state’s fiscal autonomy.” Id. at 561.\n\n\n                                       11\n\f   Case: 12-20795     Document: 00512429000     Page: 12   Date Filed: 11/04/2013\n\n\n                                 No. 12-20795\n\n      Similarly, in Jagnandan v.

The tuition “fees\nwere factored into the preparation of the annual budget for [Mississippi State\nUniversity] and were relied upon by the state legislature in determining the\nmaximum amount of expenditures allowed.” Id. at 1176. The refunds would\nhave “add[ed] an expenditure not figured in the budget.” Id. We explained:\n      The Eleventh Amendment was fashioned to protect against\n      federal judgments requiring payment of money that would\n      interfere with the state’s fiscal autonomy and thus its political\n      sovereignty. Retroactive monetary relief . . . would have just that\n      effect. Mississippi has devised a complex statutory design which\n      governs the state’s schools of higher education and their control\n      by the Board of Trustees. The Board is required to submit\n      budgetary proposals for legislative acceptance. To require refund\n      payments from the Board for overpayment of tuition fees would\n      be the kind of tampering the Eleventh Amendment sought to\n      avoid.\n\nId. (footnote omitted).\n      We hold that Texas provides substantial funding to the Center and that\nallowing for civil recovery would interfere with the state’s fiscal autonomy,\neven if payment is not made directly from the state treasury.

Educ. Code §§ 65.11, 65.31. All UTHSCH contracts must\nbe in accordance with board rules or specially approved by the board of\nregents. Id. § 65.35. As a state agency, the Center is required to follow\n\n\n                                      12\n\f    Case: 12-20795     Document: 00512429000     Page: 13   Date Filed: 11/04/2013\n\n\n                                  No. 12-20795\n\nspecific accounting and financial reporting requirements. Tex. Gov’t Code §\n2101.011(b).\n         With respect to UTHSCH’s right to hold and use property, “[t]he board\nof regents of the University of Texas System has the sole and exclusive\nmanagement and control of the lands set aside and appropriated to, or\nacquired by, The University of Texas System.” Tex. Educ. Code § 65.39. “The\nboard has the power of eminent domain to acquire for the use of the\nuniversity system any land that may be necessary and proper for carrying\nout its purposes. . . . The taking of the property is declared to be for the use\nof the state.” Id. § 65.33\n         We find that Clark’s third and sixth factors support finding UTHSCH\nto be an arm of the state.\n\n\nD. Local vs. Statewide Concerns\n         The University of Texas System, of which UTHSCH is a part, has\nlocations throughout the state of Texas. We do not accept King’s contention\nthat the Center is primarily concerned with local issues because it “does not\nprovide statewide services or have a statewide presence” since “[a]ll of its\nfacilities are in Houston.” Education and research are statewide concerns.\nSee e.g., Tex. Educ. Code § 61.002 (Texas Higher Education Board created to\n“benefit the citizens of the state in terms of the realization of the benefits of\nan educated populace”); Richardson, 118 F.3d at 455–56 & n.15 (“That\nSouthern is only one of many state-funded schools does not deprive it of\nEleventh Amendment immunity.”).\n         Clark’s fourth factor supports finding UTHSCH to be an arm of the\nstate.\n\n\n\n\n                                       13\n\f    Case: 12-20795       Document: 00512429000         Page: 14     Date Filed: 11/04/2013\n\n\n                                       No. 12-20795\n\nE. Authority to Sue and Be Sued in its Own Name\n       Texas law provides for the University of Texas System’s ability to sue\non behalf of a component institution “to recover a delinquent loan, account, or\ndebt owed.” Tex. Educ. Code § 65.42. Texas statutory law does not appear to\nauthorize the Center to bring suit or allow plaintiffs to sue UTHSCH directly.\n       Nonetheless, King identifies several cases in which UTHSCH either\nsued or was sued, and in none of them did it object to proceeding in its own\nname or insist that the University of Texas System be substituted in its\nstead. See Duncan v. Univ. of Tex. Health Sci. Ctr. at Hous., 469 F. App’x 364\n(5th Cir. 2012); Watson v. Univ. of Tex. Health Sci.

The number of cases in which\nthe Center is a named party leads us to conclude that, for arm-of-the-state\npurposes, it has the authority to sue and be sued in its own name. 3\n       Clark’s fifth factor weighs against finding UTHSCH to be an arm of the\nstate. But because five out of the six Clark factors weigh in favor of finding\nthe Center to be one, we conclude that UTHSCH is an arm of the state and\nthat Stevens applies. UTHSCH is not a “person” under the FCA, and is not\nsubject to qui tam liability. We affirm the district court’s dismissal of King’s\nqui tam claim under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim under the FCA.\n\n\n\n3We note that these cases focusing on an entity’s ability to sue or be sued are usually\nwithin the context of determining whether a state has waived immunity. As noted above,\nthe arm-of-the-state test was developed for sovereign immunity purposes. A recent Fourth\nCircuit decision case applied a four-factor test that excludes “the authority to sue and be\nsued in its own name” from the analysis. U.S. ex rel. Oberg v. Ky. Higher Educ.

Because our result\nwould be the same under either our current test or the Fourth Circuit’s, there is no need to\nchange our test.\n                                             14\n\f   Case: 12-20795     Document: 00512429000     Page: 15   Date Filed: 11/04/2013\n\n\n                                 No. 12-20795\n\nIII. Retaliation Claim\n      King sues UTHSCH for retaliation pursuant to the FCA’s anti-\nretaliation provision, 31 U.S.C. § 3730(h).      In relevant part, § 3730(h)\nprovides that:\n      Any employee, contractor, or agent shall be entitled to all relief\n      necessary to make that employee, contractor, or agent whole, if\n      that employee, contractor, or agent is discharged, demoted,\n      suspended, threatened, harassed, or in any other manner\n      discriminated against in the terms and conditions of employment\n      because of lawful acts done by the employee, contractor, agent or\n      associated others in furtherance of an action under this section or\n      other efforts to stop 1 or more violations of this subchapter.\n\n\nCongress amended this section in 2009. The previous version stated that\n“[a]ny employee who is discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened,\nharassed, or in any other manner discriminated against in the terms and\nconditions of employment by his or her employer . . . shall be entitled to all\nrelief necessary to make the employee whole.” (Emphasis added.)\n      In Elizondo, a district court applied Stevens’s holding that states and\nstate agencies are not within the FCA’s definition of “any person” to the older\nversion of § 3730(h)’s use of the phrase “his or her employer” and held that\nstates are not subject to suit under § 3730(h).

Rather, she applies her arguments against finding\nUTHSCH to be an arm of the state in the statutory context to the sovereign\nimmunity inquiry as well. We apply our finding that UTHSCH is an arm of\nthe state and hold that sovereign immunity bars King’s claim for monetary\nrelief under the FCA’s anti-retaliation provision.\n       We affirm the district court’s dismissal of King’s retaliation claim\nunder Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\n\n                                    CONCLUSION\n       We AFFIRM the district court’s dismissal of King’s suit. 4\n\n4 King challenges the district court’s dismissal of her complaint without first granting her\nleave to amend. Because we affirm the district court’s dismissal based on our holding that\nUTHSCH is an arm of the state and not because of any pleading deficiency under Rule\n12(b)(6) or Rule 9(b), amendment would be futile. We find no error in the district court’s\ndecision not to grant leave to amend before dismissing King’s case.\n                                             16\n\f</pre>",
