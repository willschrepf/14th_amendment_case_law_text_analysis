We hold that the provisions of I-1240 that designate and treat charter\n\nschools as common schools violate article IX, section 2 of our state constitution and are\n\nvoid. This includes the Act's funding provisions, which attempt to tap into and shift a\n\nportion of moneys allocated for common schools to the new charter schools authorized\n\nby the Act. Because the provisions designating and funding charter schools as common\n\nschools are integral to the Act, such void provisions are not severable, and that\n\ndetermination is dispositive of the present case.\n\n                                          FACTS\n\n       In November 2012, Washington voters approved I-1240, codified in the Act,\n\nproviding for the establishment of up to 40 charter schools within five years. Clerk's\n\nPapers (CP) at 39-78; RCW 28A.710.150(1). The Act was intended to provide parents\n\nwith \"more options\" regarding the schooling of their children. RCW 28A.710.005(1)(f);\n\nsee also RCW 28A.710.020(1) (new charter schools are public \"common school[s] open\n\nto all children free of charge\"). But the new schools came with a trade-off: the loss of\n\nlocal control and 1local accountability. Charter schools must provide a basic education,\n\nsimilar to traditional public schools, including instruction in the essential academic\n\nlearning requirements, which are developed by the superintendent of public instruction.\n\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fNo. 89714-0\n\n\nSee RCW 28A.710.040(2)(b); former RCW 28A.655.070(1)-(2) (2013). However, under\n\nthe Act's provisions, charter schools \"free teachers and principals from burdensome\n\nregulations that limit other public schools\" thereby giving charter schools \"the flexibility\n\nto innovate\" regarding staffing and curriculum. RCW 28A.710.005(l)(g). Charter\n                 }\n\n\n\nschools are exempt from many state rules. With the exception of \"the specific state\n\nstatutes and rules\" identified in RCW 28A.710.040(2) and any \"state statutes and rules\n\nmade applicable to the charter school in the school's charter contract,\" charter schools are\n\n\"not subject to and are exempt from all other state statutes and rules applicable to school\n\ndistricts and school district boards of directors ... in areas such as scheduling, personnel,\n\nfunding, and educational programs.\" RCW 28A.710.040(3).\n\n       Under the Act, charter schools are devoid of local control from their inception to\n\ntheir daily operation. 1 Charter schools can be approved in two ways. First, the\n\nWashington Charter School Commission, which is an \"independent state agency\"\n                 ;·\n\n\n\nestablished by the Act and made up of nine appointed members, has the power to\n\nestablish charter schools anywhere in the State. See RCW 28A.710.070(1)-(2), .080(1). 2\n\nSecond, school districts may apply to the Washington State Board of Education for\n\npermission to authorize charter schools. RCW 28A.710.080(2). The commission and\n\napproved school districts (referred to as \"charter school authorizers\") solicit charter\n\napplications, approve or deny applications, and negotiate and execute charter contracts.\n\n       1\n          Charter schools are formed upon the application of a nonsectarian, nonprofit\ncorporation, see RCW 28A.710.010(1), .040(4), and are governed by an appointed charter school\nboard. RCW 28A.l70.010(6), .020(3).\n        2\n          All commission members must have a \"commitment to charter schooling as a strategy\nfor strengthening public education.\" RCW 28A.710.070(3).\n\n                                              3\n\fNo. 89714-0\n\n\nRCW 28A.710.100(1). Charter school authorizers also monitor performance and legal\n\ncompliance of charter schools, RCW 28A.710.180(1), but such oversight cannot \"unduly\n\ninhibit the autonomy granted to charter schools,\" RCW 28A.710.180(2), and such\n\noversight must also be consistent with the principles and standards developed by another\n\nprivate   organiza~ion,   the National Association of Charter School Authorizers. RCW\n\n28A.71 0.1 00(3). 3\n\n          As for daily operation, charter schools are not governed by elected local school\n\nboards. Instead, .charter schools are operated by a \"charter school board,\" RCW\n\n28A.710.020(3), which is \"appointed or selected under the terms of a charter application\n\nto manage and operate the charter school.\" RCW 28A.710.010(6). The board is\n\nresponsible for functions typically handled by an elected school board, including hiring,\n\nmanaging, and discharging employees; receiving and disbursing funds; entering\n\ncontracts; and determining enrollment numbers. RCW 28A.710.030(1), .050(5).\n\n          As for funding, the Act requires the superintendent to apportion funds to charter\n\nschools on the same basis as public school districts. See RCW 28A.710.220, .230(1).\n\nSuch disbursements include basic education moneys appropriated by the legislature in the\n\nbiennial operating budget for the use of common schools and moneys from the common\n\nschool construction fund. See RCW 28A.710.220(2), .230(1); RCW 28A.l50.380(1),\n\n.250(1).\n\n\n\n\n          3\n        The commission has authorized seven charter schools. Spokane Public Schools, a\nschool district authorizer, has authorized one charter school.\n\n\n                                                4\n\fNo. 89714-0\n\n\n      Alarmed over the lack of local accountability and fiscal impacts of the Act,\n\nappellants 4 sued the State of Washington in King County Superior Court, seeking a\n\ndeclaratory judgment that the Act is unconstitutional. 5 Several supporters of charter\n\nschools intervenyd. 6 All three parties moved for summary judgment, and the trial court\n\ngranted summary judgment to the State and intervenors on all issues but one. The trial\n\ncourt held that charter schools are not \"common schools\" under article IX of\n\nWashington's Constitution and, therefore, the common school construction fund could\n\nnot be appropriated to charter schools. CP at 1043, 1045. The trial court found,\n\nhowever, that the provisions permitting such appropriations were severable. The trial\n\ncourt concluded that the Act was otherwise constitutional. All parties sought direct\n\nreview, which we granted.\n\n                                         ANALYSIS\n\n       We begin by noting what this case is not about. Our inquiry is not concerned with\n\nthe merits or demerits of charter schools. Whether charter schools would enhance our\n\nstate's public school system or appropriately address perceived shortcomings of that\n\n\n\n\n       4\n          The plaintiffs/appellants consist of several organizations and community members: the\nLeague of Women Voters of Washington; El Centro De Le Raza; Washington Association of\nSchool Administrators; Washington Education Association; Wayne Au, PhD; Pat Braman;\nDonna Boyer; and Sarah Lucas.\n        5\n          Appellants argued that the Act violates article II, section 37; article III, section 22;\narticle VII, section 2(a); and article IX, sections 1, 2, and 3 of the Washington Constitution.\n        6\n          Intervenors/respondents consist of the Washington State Charter Schools Association,\nLeague of Education Voters, Ducere Group, Cesar Chavez Charter School, I-1240 sponsor Tania\nDe Sa Campos, and Matt Elisara.\n\n                                                5\n\fNo. 89714-0\n\n\nsystem are issues for the legislature and the voters. 7 The issue for this court is what are\n\nthe requirements of the constitution. Cf Gerberding v. Munro, 134 Wn.2d 188, 211, 949\n\nP.2d 1366 (1998) (\"we are not swayed in our analysis of [the term limits initiative] by the\n\npolicy merits or demerits of term limits for officeholders\"). Accordingly, \"[ o]ur review\n\nhere is limited to the issue of whether the voters acted in compliance with our state's\n\nconstitution in expressing their collective will.\" !d. \"[W]hile initiative measures are\n\nreflective of the reserved power of the people to legislate, the people in their legislative\n\ncapacity remain   ~ubject   to the mandates ofthe Constitution.\" !d. at 196 (citation\n\nomitted). Moreover, we have made clear that the initiative process is limited in scope to\n\nsubject matter that is legislative in nature, that an initiative attempting to achieve\n\nsomething not within its power is invalid, and that the initiative power may not be used to\n\namend the constitution. !d. at 210 n.11.\n\n       Charter Schools Are Not Common Schools\n\n       This case turns on the language of article IX, section 2 of our state constitution and\n\nthis court's case law addressing that provision. See Tunstall v. Bergeson, 141 Wn.2d\n\n201, 220-21, 5 P.3d 691 (2000) (\"the court's focus when addressing constitutional facial\n\nchallenges is on \\whether the statute's language violates the constitution\"). Article IX,\n\nsection 2 of the Washington Constitution provides:\n\n       The legislature shall provide for a general and uniform system of public\n       schools. The public school system shall include common schools, and such\n\n       7\n         Amici largely address the perceived benefits of charter schools and their successes in\nother states. See, e.g., Br. of Amicus Pac. Legal Found. at 13-20; Br. of Amici Nat'l All. for\nPub. Charter Sch., Black All. for Educ. Options, and the Nat'l Ctr. for Special Educ. in Charter\nSchools at 3-5; Br. of Amici First Place Scholars Charter Sch. et al. at 12-20.\n\n\n                                                6\n\fNo. 89714-0\n\n\n      high schools, normal schools, and technical schools as may hereafter be\n      established. But the entire revenue derived from the common school fund\n      and the state tax for common schools shall be exclusively applied to the\n      support of the common schools. 8\n\n      In order tq tap the funding sources identified in article IX, I -1240 declared charter\n\nschools to be \"common schools.\" See LAWS OF 2013, ch. 2, §§ 101(1)(m), (n)(vii),\n\n202(1), (2), 208(1), 301, 302; see also RCW 28A.710.005(1)(m), (n)(vii), .020(1), (2),\n\n.070(1); RCW 28A.150.010; RCW 28A.315.005. The Act also directed that charter\n\nschools are to be funded \"as other public schools,\" and defined \"[p ]ublic schools\" to\n\nmean \"the common schools as referred to in article IX of the state constitution, including\n\ncharter schools,\" and other schools below the college level and maintained at public\n\nexpense. LAWS OF 2013, ch. 2, §§ 222(1), 301; see also id. § 101(1)(n)(vii); RCW\n\n28A.710.220(1), .005(1)(n)(vii); RCW 28A.150.010. Charter schools must report student\n\nenrollment and comply with applicable reporting requirements to receive state or federal\n\nfunding. LAWS OF 2013, ch. 2, § 222(1); RCW 28A.710.220(1). The Act directs the\n\nsuperintendent of public instruction to allocate funding for charter schools \"based oh the\n\nsame funding criteria used for noncharter public schools,\" and charter schools are\n\n\n\n       8\n           Article IX, section 1 provides:\n\n       It is the paramount duty of the state to make ample provision for the education of\n       all children residing within its borders, without distinction or preference on\n       account of race, color, caste, or sex.\n\n       Article IX, section 3 provides in relevant part:\n\n              There is hereby established the common school construction fund to be\n       used exclusively for the purpose of financing the construction of facilities for the\n       common schools.\n\n                                                 7\n\fNo. 89714-0\n\n\n\"eligible to apply for student grants on the same basis as a school district.\" LAws OF\n\n2013, ch. 2, § 222(2); RCW 28A.710.220(2). The Act provides that charter schools\n\n\"shall be included in the levy planning, budgets, and funding distribution in the smne\n\nmanner as other public schools in the district,\" that school districts \"must allocate levy\n\nmoneys to a conversion charter school,\" and that charter schools \"must be included in\n\nlevy planning, budgets, and funding distribution in the same manner as other public\n\nschools.\" LAWS OF 2013, ch. 2, § 222(5), (6), (8); RCW 28A.710.220(5), (6), (8). The\n\nAct additionally ·~eclares that charter schools are \"eligible for state matching funds for\n\ncommon school construction.\" LAWS OF 2013, ch. 2, § 223(1); RCW 28A.710.230(1).\n\n       Moreover, I- 1240's voter's pamphlet made clear to voters that the fiscal impact of\n\nthe initiative was merely to shift existing school funding from existing (common) schools\n\nto charter schools. \"Initiative 1240 is anticipated to shift revenues, expenditures and\n\ncosts between local public school districts or from local public school districts to charter\n\nschools, primarily from movement in student enrollment.\" CP at 549. \"Charter schools\n\nwould be tuition-free public schools within the state system of common schools.\" !d. at\n\n550. \"State funcFng for charter schools would be provided in the same manner as other\n\npublic schools [and] ... based on the same funding criteria used for noncharter schools.\"\n\n!d. \"Charter schools provide another enrollment option, but they do not change current\n\nlaw that state funding follows the student.\" !d. \"Charter schools are eligible for state\n\nmatching funds for common school construction.\" !d.\n\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\fNo. 89714-0\n\n\n      Relevant here, I-1240 also provides that charter schools are \"governed by a charter\n\nschool board,\" which is \"appointed or selected ... to manage and operate the charter\n\nschool.\" LAWS OF 2013, ch. 2, § 201(5)-(6); RCW 28A.710.010(5)-(6). The charter\n\nschool board has the power to hire and discharge charter school employees and may\n\ncontract with nonprofit organizations to manage the charter school. LAWS OF 2013, ch. 2,\n\n§ 203(1)(a),(c); RCW 28A.710.030(1)(a), (c); see also LAWS OF 2013, ch. 2, § 101(2);\n\nRCW 28A.710.005(2) (\"the people enact this initiative measure to authorize ... charter\n\nschools in the state of Washington[] to be operated by qualified nonprofit\n\norganizations\"). I-1240 also makes charter schools \"free from many regulations\" that\n\ngovern other schools. LAWS OF 2013, ch. 2, § IOI(l)(n)(viii); RCW\n\n28A.710.005(1)(n)(viii). Charter schools are \"exempt from all school district policies,\"\n\nas well as \"all ... state statutes and rules applicable to school districts\" except those\n\nlisted in I-1240 section 204(2) and those made applicable in the school's charter contract.\n\nLAWS OF 2013, ch. 2, § 204(3); RCW 28A.710.040(3).\n\n       This case addresses the designation, funding, and control of charter schools as set\n\nforth in I-1240 and that initiative's compliance with article IX, section 2. Accordingly,\n\nthe case is largely determined by our prior decision in School District No. 20 v. Bryan, 51\n\nWash. 498, 99 P. 28 (1909). Intervenors ask us to \"overturn Bryan,\" Answering Br. &\n\nOpening Cross-Appeal Br. of Intervenors at 48, but we decline to do so. Bryan has been\n\nthe law in Washington for more than a hundred years and is repeatedly relied on as\n\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\fNo. 89714-0\n\n\nauthority by Washington's appellate courts. 9 Intervenors offer no compelling reason to\n\nabandon Bryan. Similarly, the State asks us to \"recognize an evolving common school\n\nsystem\" and not read Bryan as \"a static statement of constitutional imperatives.\" Br. of\n\nResp't/Cross-Appellant State of Wash. at 26, 23. But in Bryan this court established the\n\ncriteria for evaluating a \"common school\" within the meaning of article IX, and warned,\n\n\"The words 'common school' must measure up to every requirement of the constitution\n\n... and whenever by any subterfuge it is sought to qualify or enlarge their meaning\n\nbeyond the intent and spirit ofthe constitution, the attempt must fail.\" 51 Wash. at 503.\n\nBryan established the rule that\n\n       a common school, within the meaning of our constitution, is one that is\n       common to all children of proper age and capacity, free, and subject to and\n       under the control of the qualified voters of the school district. The\n       complete control of the schools is a most important feature, for it carries\n       with it the right of the voters, through their chosen agents, to select\n       qualified teachers, with powers to discharge them if they are incompetent.\n\n\n\n\n       9\n         See, e.g., State v.

As discussed above, charter schools do not qualify as common\n\nschools.

Id. at 504. Here, the uniformity of the common\nschool system is similarly broken in that the Charter School Act eliminates the local voter\ncontrol that is a hallmark of common schools, thereby resulting in different (nonuniform)\ngovernance for charter schools as compared to common schools.\n         Aside from the above observation-that the Act's governance provisions for charter\nschools violate the \"uniform system\" requirement of article IX, section 2-we do not further\naddress the Act's article IX uniformity failings or the parties' other arguments because we find\nthe invalidity of the Act's funding provisions as discussed herein to be dispositive.\n          tt '\"To say that the Legislature can determine what institutions shall receive the proceeds\n\nof the school fund, and that whatever they determine to be entitled thereto becomes ipso facto a\ncommon school, ii) begging the whole question, and annulling the constitutional restriction.'\" Id.\nat 504-05 (quoting People ex rel.

As noted, the Act provides that charter schools are to be\n\nfunded on the same basis as common schools. The superintendent must distribute money\n\nfrom the constitutionally restricted basic education allocation to charter schools on the\n\nsame basis as common schools. See RCW 28A.710.220(2). 12 In other words, under the\n\n\n          12\n         A portion of the basic education allocation is derived from the state levy on real\nproperty designated for support of common schools. See RCW 84.52.065.\n\n                                                12\n\fNo. 89714-0\n\n\nterms of the Act's provisions the source of funds for the operation of charter schools is\n\nthe basic education moneys that are otherwise dedicated to the operation of common\n\nschools. See RGW 28A.510.250; RCW 28A.710.220(2); RCW 84.52.065, 13 .067.\n\n       However, the constitution sets aside certain property and other moneys to establish\n\na permanent fund for the exclusive use of common schools, referred to in article IX as the\n\n\"common school fund.\" WASH. CONST. art. IX,§§ 2, 3. Article IX, section 2 also\n\nextended constitutional protection to any \"state tax for common schools.\" In Yelle, 199\n\nWash. at 316, this court addressed the restrictions on the use ofbasic education funds\n\nallocated to common schools. Yelle struck down a law that would have diverted tax\n\nrevenues allocated to the common schools to support a vocational rehabilitation program\n\noperated by a state board. !d. This court explained that it was \"beside the question\" that\n\nthe vast majority of state funding in place at that time, whether derived from tax revenues\n\nor \"cash on hand,\" could have been allocated to other purposes in the first instance. !d.\n\nThe constitutional protection afforded to common school appropriations is not dependent\n\non the source of the revenue (i.e., the type of tax or other funding source) or the account\n\n\n       13\n           After the October 28, 2014 oral argument in this case, the State filed a statement of\nadditional authority on July 22,2015 citing Laws of2015, chapter 4, section 516(5) as\nsupporting the notion that \"charter schools can operate without access to constitutionally\nrestricted revenue.\" Statement of Additional Auth. at 1-2. Section 516(5) is a subsection ofthe\noperating budget regarding funding for the 2015-2017 biennium, and provides, \"State general\nfund appropriations distributed through Part V of this act for the operation and administration of\ncharter schools as provided in chapter 28A. 71 0 RCW shall not include state common school levy\nrevenues collected under RCW 84.52.065.\" LAWS OF 2015, ch. 4, § 516(5). This legislation,\nwhich is express!)~ effective on June 30,2015 and is prospective in its application, does not alter\nour analysis or coi1clusion concerning the effect of the Act as previously passed by the voters in\n2012 and codified in 2013. The validity of section 516(5) as a substantive law provision buried\nwithin an operating budget is not before us. For present purposes it is enough to note that section\n516(5) does not assist the State.\n\n\n                                                13\n\fNo. 89714-0\n\n\nin which the funds are held (i.e., the general fund or other state fund). Rather, this court\n\nheld that all money \"allocated to the support of the common schools ... constitute[ s] a\n\n'state tax for the common schools' in contemplation of Art. IX,§ 2, of the constitution.\"\n\nId. Yelle continued, \"[O]nce appropriated to the support of the common schools,\" funds\n\ncannot \"subsequently be diverted to other purposes.\" Id. at 317. This court cautioned\n\nthat to hold otherwise \"would be calamitous.\" Jd.\n\n       Similarly, in Mitchell this court explained that the use of any common school\n\nfunds for other than a common school purpose violates the constitution. There, this court\n\nheld unconstitutional a statute that extended school bus transportation privileges to\n\nprivate school students along already existing and operating public school bus routes.\n\nThis court rejected the argument that the statute did not impose any additional expense on\n\nthe school district in that the private school students would merely join the public school\n\nstudents on the school bus's established and regular route. Mitchell, 17 Wn.2d at 66.\n\nAlthough the statute in question did not identify or make any appropriation for carrying\n\nout its purpose, because its operation would have the effect of utilizing common school\n\nfunds for other than common school purposes, it contravened article IX, section 2's\n\nexclusivity requirement. Jd. Restated, the statute's overall fiscal neutrality did not affect\n\nits constitutional infirmity. Also, even though the statute did not address funding, the fact\n\nthat it's intended operation would \"necessitate[] the use of common school funds for\n\nother than common school purposes\" rendered it unconstitutional. !d.\n\n\n\n\n                                              14\n\fNo. 89714-0\n\n\n      Under the; Act, charter schools receive funds from the legislature's basic education\n\nallocation for the common schools. See RCW 28A.710.220(2). By statute, all of the\n\nbasic education funds in the biennial operations budget are designated for the exclusive\n\nuse ofthe common schools. RCW 28A.l50.380(1) (\"The state legislature shall, at each\n\nregular session in an odd-numbered year, appropriate for the current use of the common\n\nschools such amounts as needed for state support to school districts during the ensuing\n\nbiennium for the program of basic education under RCW 28A.l50.200.\"). These funds\n\n\"made available by the legislature for the current use of the common schools\" are then\n\ndistributed annually by the Superintendent to \"each school district of the state operating a\n\nbasic education instructional program.\" RCW 28A.l50.250(1). That the specific\n\ncommon school property levy is only a portion of the state funds used to support common\n\nschools does not alter the protection afforded to the entire basic education allocation as a\n\n\"'state tax for common schools\"' within the meaning of article IX, section 2. Yelle, 199\n\nWn.2d at 316-17 (quoting CONST. art. IX, § 2). The Act unconstitutionally reallocates\n\nthese restricted funds to charter schools, which do not qualify as common schools. ·\n\n       Compounding this problem, the State does not segregate constitutionally restricted\n\nmoneys from other state funds. Nor can it demonstrate that these restricted moneys are\n\nprotected from being spent on charter schools. Cf id. at 317; Leonard, 127 Wn.2d at 199\n\n(act violated artiide IX, section 2 because it diverted revenues that under the existing\n\nstatutory scheme would otherwise be used to support the common schools). Given this\n\nabsence of segregation and accountability, we find unconvincing the State's view that\n\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\fNo. 89714-0\n\n\ncharter schools may be constitutionally funded through the general fund. See Br. of\n\nResp't/Cross-Appellant State of Wash. at 30-31. Historically, the state common school\n\nfunds were maintained in a separate public school account and distributed to the common\n\nschools by the Superintendent. See, e.g., Yelle, 199 Wash. at 314-15. While some other\n\nconstitutionally restricted state funds continue to be maintained in separate accounts (e.g.,\n\ncommon school construction fund (WASH. CONST. art. IX,§ 3), gas taxes for\n\ntransportation purposes (WASH. CONST. art. II,§ 40)), since at least 1967, the\n\nconstitutionally restricted common school property levy revenues have been deposited in\n\nthe State's \"general fund,\" which is used for the basic education allocation. See RCW\n\n84.52.067; LAws OF 1967, Ex. Sess., ch. 133, § 2. There is no way to track the restricted\n\ncommon school funds or to ensure that these dollars are used exclusively to support the\n\ncommon schools.\n\n       In addition to the diversion of basic education funds, the Act diverts funds from\n\nthe common school construction fund established under article IX, section 3. See RCW\n\n28A.710.230(1).·· The school construction fund, unlike other restricted common school\n\nfunds, continues to be held in a segregated account. See RCW 28A.515.320. The trial\n\ncourt correctly held that the Charter School Act's provisions authorizing diversion of\n\nthese restricted funds are unconstitutional.\n\n       Our constitution directs the legislature to establish and fund common schools and\n\nrestricts the legislature's power to divert funds committed to common schools for other\n\npurposes even if related to education. CONST. art. IX,§§ 1-3. The Charter School Act's\n\n\n\n\n                                               16\n\fNo. 89714-0\n\n\ndiversion of basic education funds allocated to the support of the common schools and\n\ncommon school construction funds is unconstitutional and void.\n\n      We also disagree with the State's view that the Act's remaining provisions are\n\nsaved because funding \"follows the student\" and in any event charter schools could be\n\nfunded out ofthe state general fund. Br. ofResp't/Cross-Appellant State of Wash. at 40.\n\nThe fact that public school money distributions are generally based on per capita student\n\nattendance does not mean that common school funds are available for students who do\n\nnot attend common schools. Where a child is not attending a common school, there can\n\nbe no entitlement to \"an apportionment of the current state school fund, to a credit\n\npredicated on attendance of children at such ... school.\" State v. Preston, 79 Wash. 286,\n\n289, 140 P. 350 (1914).\n\n       Similarly, in Bryan, the legislative act in question provided for a model training\n\nschool department to be established in the state normal schools, under the supervision of\n\nthe board of trustees of such normal schools. Relevant here, the legislation directed the\n\nsuperintendent of public instruction to apportion moneys \"'out of the funds available for\n\nthe support of the common schools'\" in an amount reflecting \"'the number of pupils in\n\nattendance'\" at the model training school and distribute such portion to the noted boards.\n\nBryan, 51 Wash. at 500-01 (quoting LAWS OF 1907, ch. 97, § 4). In other words, under\n\nthe legislation in· question the money would follow the student. This court affirmed the\n\ntrial court's ruling that such legislation \"'which seeks to apportion or appropriate any part\n\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\fNo. 89714-0\n\n\nof the common school fund or revenue therefrom or state tax for the support of the\n\ncommon schools is unconstitutional and void.\"' !d. at 501.\n\n      Further, as discussed above, the Act designates and relies on common school\n\nfunds as its funding source. Without those funds, the Act cannot function as intended.\n\nNotably, 1-1240 supporters' statements in the voters' pamphlet assured voters that charter\n\nschools would be funded out of the current school system by merely shifting existing\n\nschool funding. In response to criticism that 1-1240 \"diverts taxpayer money into\n\nunaccountable . . . charter schools [and] ... will drain millions of dollars from existing\n\nclassrooms,\" CP at 553, supporters stated in the pamphlet that\"[ c]harter schools are\n\npublic schools, open to all students, accountable to a local school board or state\n\ncommission, and do not take a penny from our public school system or students. They're\n\nfunded based on student enrollment just like other public schools.\" Jd. at 553.\n\n       The Act 's1nvalid Provisions Are Not Severable\n\n       The next question is whether the above noted unconstitutional provisions render\n\nthe Act unconstitutional in its entirety. \"A legislative act is not unconstitutional in its\n\nentirety unless invalid provisions are unseverable.\" Amalgamated Transit Union Local\n\n587 v. State, 142 Wn.2d 183, 227, 11 P.3d 762, 27 P.3d 608 (2000). The test for\n\nseverability is whether the unconstitutional provisions are so connected to the remaining\n\nprovisions that it cannot be reasonably believed that the legislative body would have\n\npassed the remainder of the act's provisions without the invalid portions, or unless\n\nelimination of the invalid part would render the remaining part useless to accomplish the\n\n\n\n\n                                               18\n\fNo. 89714-0\n\n\nlegislative purposes. Id. at 227-28; Gerberding v. Munro, 134 Wn.2d 188, 197, 949 P.2d\n\n1366 (1998); State v. Crediford, 130 Wn.2d 747, 760, 927 P.2d 1129 (1996). While the\n\npresence of a severability clause may provide assurance that the legislative body would\n\nhave enacted remaining sections without the invalid portions, a severability clause is not\n\nnecessarily dispositive on the question of whether the legislative body would have\n\nenacted the remainder ofthe act. Amalgamated, 142 Wn.2d at 228. Here, the Act\n\ncontains a severability clause, but the invalid provisions are so intertwined with the\n\nremainder of the Act and so fundamental to the Act's efficacy that under either of the\n\nabove tests the invalid portions are not severable.\n\n       The Act identifies charter schools as common schools and is expressly reliant on\n\ncommon school funding to support such charter schools. That a funding source is\n\nrequired for the existence of charter schools is self-evident. As discussed above, the Act\n\nspecifically intends to use common school funding allocations as that source. Without a\n\nvalid funding source the charter schools envisioned in I-1240 are not viable. Moreover,\n\nI- 1240's voters' pamphlet stressed that the funding for charter schools will come from\n\nexisting funding sources in the form of a \"shift [in] revenues\" from \"local public school\n\ndistricts to charter schools.\" CP at 549. In sum, without funding, charter schools are not\n\nviable. Nor can it be believed that voters would have approved the Charter School Act\n\nwithout its funding mechanism. See Leonard, 127 Wn.2d at 202 (act's funding\n\nmechanism is its \"heart and soul\" and act would be \"virtually worthless\" without it; thus,\n\nthe funding mechanism is not severable from the remainder of the act).\n\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\fNo. 89714-0\n\n\n       In sum, the Charter School Act violates article IX, section 2 because charter .\n\nschools are not common schools despite the Act's attempt to so designate them. The\n\nAct's designated funding mechanisms fail, and these provisions are not severable from\n\nthe remainder of:.the Charter School Act. 14\n\n                                       CONCLUSION\n\n       The portions ofl-1240 designating charter schools as common schools violate\n\narticle IX, section 2 of the Washington Constitution and are invalid. For the same reason,\n\nthe portions ofl-1240 providing access to restricted common school funding are also\n\ninvalid. These provisions are not severable and render the entire Act unconstitutional.\n\nWe affirm in part and reverse in part and remand for an appropriate order.\n\n\n\n\n       14\n         Because these determinations are dispositive of this case, we do not address the parties'\nother arguments. See Bryan, 51 Wash. at 506-07; Gerberding, 134 Wn.2d at 211 n.12.\n\n                                                20\n\fNo. 89714-0\n\n\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n(\n    --~\n\n\n\n\n              21\n\fLeague of Women Voters v.

(concurring in part and dissenting in part)-We must decide\n\nwhether newly created charter schools are \"common schools\" as defined by article\n\nIX, section 2 of the Washington Constitution and, if not, whether the charter schools\n\nact (Act), codified at chapter 28A.710 RCW, requires the State to support charter\n\nschools with funds that are constitutionally restricted to the benefit of common\n\nschools. I agree that charter schools are not common schools. But because nothing\n\nin the Act expressly requires the use of restricted funds, the Act is facially valid.\n\nSince charter schools may be constitutionally funded with unrestricted monies from\n\nthe general fund, I concur in part and dissent in part.\n\n       In November 2012, Washington voters approved Initiative 1240 (1-1240),\n\ncodified in the Act, allowing up to 40 charter schools to open within five years. The\n\nAct was intended to provide parents with \"more options to find the best learning\n\nenvironment for their children.\" RCW 28A.710.005(1)(f). Under the Act, charter\n\nschools would be operated by nonprofit, nonsectarian organizations. RCW\n\n28A.710.010(1), .040(4). Further, charter schools must be free and open to all\n\n\n\n\n                                            1\n\fLeague of Women Voters v. State, No. 89714-0\nFairhurst, J.

RCW 28A.710.050(4).\n\n       While charter schools are given more \"flexibility to innovate and make\n\ndecisions about staffing, curriculum, and learning opportunities to improve student\n\nachievement and outcomes,\" they are still subject to various restrictions. RCW\n\n28A.710.005(1)(g). For example, all teachers must be state certificated. RCW\n\n28A.710.040(2)(c). Like traditional public schools, charter schools are required to\n\nprovide a basic education through instruction in the essential academic learning\n\nrequirements (EALRs). RCW 28A.710.040(2)(b). EALRs are developed by the\n\nsuperintendent of public instruction (Superintendent) and prescribe the substantive\n\ncontent taught to all of Washington's public school students, often spanning several\n\nhundred pages per subject. Charter schools are also subject to performance\n\nimprovement goals advanced by the state Board of Education. RCW\n\n28A. 71 0.040(2)(g).\n\n       When it comes to evaluating performance, charter schools are assessed under\n\nthe same statewide student assessment system developed and overseen by the\n\nSuperintendent.

RCW 28A.710.200(2).\n\n      Funding for a charter school is tied to student enrollment, and the\n\nSuperintendent allocates funding to charter schools using the same formulas that are\n\napplied to traditional public schools. RCW 28A. 710 .220(2). The State's general fund\n\nis the main source of funding for public education, including charter schools. See\n\nLAWS OF     2013, 2d Spec. Sess., ch. 4, §§ 501-516 (operational expenses for\n\neducation).\n\nA.     Common schools can and must function without using constitutionally\n       restricted funds\n\n       Washington's constitution identifies three funds whose use is restricted solely\n\nfor the benefit of common schools. The Act does not require the use of monies from\n\nany of these funds. The current funding scheme for charter schools and public\n\neducation is consistent with our constitution and precedent. The appellants,! making\n\na facial challenge, fail to meet their burden.\n\n       1.     The Act does not divert resources from any of the three restricted funds\n\n       Sections 2 and 3 of article IX identify three protected funds: the permanent\n\ncommon school fund, the state tax for common schools, and the common school\n\n\n       1\n        The plaintiffs/appellants consist of several nonprofit organizations and community\nmembers: the League of Women Voters of Washington; El Centro De Le Raza; Washington\nAssociation of School Administrators; Washington Education Association; Wayne Au, PhD; Pat\nBraman; Donna Boyer; and Sarah Lucas (hereinafter collectively appellants).\n\n\n                                            3\n\fLeague of Women Voters v. State, No. 89714-0\nFairhurst, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n\nconstruction fund. The legislature cannot use revenue from any of these restricted\n\nfunds for purposes other than to support common schools. Mitchell v. Canso!. Sch.\n\nDist. No. 201, 17 Wn.2d 61, 66, 135 P.2d 79 (1943) (plurality opinion).\n\n      First, the permanent common school fund was created by article IX, section 3\n\nin 1889. There are two components of the permanent common school fund that we\n\nmust consider-the principal of the fund and the interest that accrues on the fund.\n\n      In 1967, the legislature froze the principal of the permanent common school\n\nfund. LAWS OF 1967, ch. 29, § 1, at 98. To this day, our constitution requires that the\n\nprincipal of the fund must remain intact. CONST. art. IX,§ 3; RCW 28A.515.300(2).\n\nThe Act does not direct the legislature to expend any principal, nor do appellants\n\nallege that the principal of the fund has been improperly appropriated.\n\n       Neither has the interest been diverted to the support of charter schools. When\n\nthe fund was created in 1889, our constitution provided that \"interest accruing on\n\n[the permanent common school fund,] ... shall be exclusively applied to the current\n\nuse of the common schools.\" CONST. art. IX, § 3 (1889). However, when the\n\nlegislature froze the principal of the fund in 1967, it directed all of the interest\n\naccruing on the fund toward the newly created common school construction fund,\n\nwhich was dedicated solely to common school construction. CONST. art. IX, § 3.\n\nThus, the interest from the permanent common school fund is not and cannot be used\n\nfor any school operating costs. Appellants therefore cannot show that any money\n\n\n                                            4\n\fLeague of Women Voters v. State, No. 89714-0\nFairhurst, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n\nfrom the permanent common school fund is being diverted to support charter\n\nschools.\n\n       Second, the state tax for common schools, codified in RCW 84.52.065, levies\n\n\"for the support of common schools of the state a tax of three dollars and sixty cents\n\nper thousand dollars.\" Currently, revenue from the state tax for common schools is\n\nplaced into the general fund, RCW 84.52.067, from which our public education\n\nsystem receives support, LAWS OF 2013, 2d Spec. Sess., ch. 4, §§ 501-516. As\n\ndiscussed in more detail below, the state tax for common schools constitutes only a\n\nfraction of the total appropriation to our public schools. For example, in fiscal year\n\n2015, the appropriation for public education amounted to roughly $7.095 billion\n\nfrom the general fund. LAWS OF 2013, 2d Spec. Sess., ch. 4, §§ 502, 505, 507, 510-\n\n511, 514-515. Of this, only $2.003 billion consists of the state tax for common\n\nschools. WASH. STATE ECON. & REVENUE FORECAST COUNCIL, WASHINGTON STATE\n\nECONOMIC AND REVENUE FORECAST                   69   (2014),   http://www.erfc.wa.gov/\n\npublications/documents/sep14pub.pdf. Thus, only 28 percent of the revenue\n\nappropriated for public education from the general fund is restricted. Because charter\n\nschools account for merely 2 percent of Washington's public schools, they can\n\ncertainly be funded through the remaining 72 percent of the appropriation from the\n\ngeneral fund. Importantly, nowhere does the Act expressly require the State to fund\n\ncharter schools with revenue from the state tax for common schools.\n\n\n                                            5\n\fLeague of Women Voters v. State, No. 89714-0\nFairhurst, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n\n      Finally, article IX, section 3 created the third restricted fund when it\n\n\"established the common school construction fund to be used exclusively for the\n\npurpose of financing the construction of facilities for the common schools.\" The text\n\nof the Act does not actually require the State to provide such funding from the\n\ncommon school construction fund. The Act simply provides that \"[c]harter schools\n\nare eligible for state matching funds for common school construction.\" RCW\n\n28A.710.230(1). A review ofthe 2013 session laws reveals that the legislature funds\n\nschool construction from both the state building construction account and the\n\ncommon school construction account. See LAWS OF 2013, ch. 19, §§ 5001-5030, at\n\n2734-43. In fact, the majority of public school construction is funded by the state\n\nbuilding construction account. Id. Thus, while the legislature may not appropriate\n\nfrom the common school construction fund for construction or repair of charter\n\nschools, nothing would prevent it from using the state building construction account\n\nor even unrestricted revenues in the general fund. Appellants fail to establish that the\n\nAct will divert any revenue from the common school construction fund.\n\n       Contrary to the majority's view, the Act does not expressly require the use of\n\nany of the three restricted funds. The majority points to RCW 28A.710.220(2).\n\nMajority at 12-13. That statute provides that\"[ c]ategorical funding must be allocated\n\nto a charter school based on the same funding criteria used for noncharter public\n\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\fLeague of Women Voters v. State, No. 89714-0\nFairhurst, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n\nschools.\" 2 On its face, this statute does not require the State to support charter\n\nschools with restricted funds. Taken in context, this provision relates to the amount\n\nof money that a charter school may receive and requires that charter schools be\n\nsubject to the same per-pupil formula as other public schools. It plainly says nothing\n\nabout the source of funding. In fact, nowhere does the Act identify a source of\n\nfunding, it merely states that charter schools must \"receive funding based on student\n\nenrollment just like existing public schools.\" RCW 28A.710.005(1)(n)(vii). Because\n\nthe Act neither identifies a source of funding nor commands the use of restricted\n\nfunds to support charter schools, it withstands appellants' facial challenge and is\n\nconstitutional. 3\n\n\n\n\n       2\n         The full text ofRCW 28A.710.220(2) states:\n        According to the schedule established under RCW 28A.51 0.250, the superintendent\n        of public instruction shall allocate funding for a charter school including general\n        apportionment, special education, categorical, and other nonbasic education\n        moneys. Allocations must be based on the statewide average staff mix ratio of all\n        noncharter public schools from the prior school year and the school's actual full-\n        time equivalent enrollment. Categorical funding must be allocated to a charter\n        school based on the same funding criteria used for noncharter public schools and\n        the funds must be expended as provided in the charter contract. A charter school is\n        eligible to apply for state grants on the same basis as a school district.\n        3The majority also cites to three other statutes for the proposition that the Act's terms\n\nidentify restricted funds as the source of funding. Majority at 13 (citing RCW 28A.510.250; RCW\n84.52.065, .067). First, none of these statutes are located within the Act and are thus not relevant\nto appellants' claim that the Act is facially invalid. Second, these statutes plainly do not require\nthe use of restricted funds. In fact, none of them discuss the source of funding for charter schools.\nSee RCW 28A.510.250 (establishing a schedule for when the Superintendent must allocate funds\nto schools); RCW 84.52.065 (requiring the State to levy a tax for common schools), .067 (requiring\nthe state tax for common schools to be deposited into the general fund).\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fLeague of Women Voters v. State, No. 89714-0\nFairhurst, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n\n      2.      The current funding scheme for charter schools is constitutional and\n              consistent with precedent\n\n      The State now funds public education primarily through the general fund.\n\nWASH. STATE OFFICE OF FIN. MGMT., A GUIDE TO THE WASH. STATE BUDGET\n\nPROCESS 6 (2014), http://www.ofm.wa.gov/reports/budgetprocess.pdf(45.1 percent\n\nof the general fund is spent on K-12 education). According to the Washington State\n\nOffice of Financial Management, there are seven separate appropriations that\n\ncomprise the overall allocations to public schools. Clerk's Papers (CP) at 1032.\n\nThese include appropriations for (1) general apportionment, (2) pupil transportation,\n\n(3) special education, (4) institutional education programs, (5) programs for highly\n\ncapable students, (6) transitional bilingual programs, and (7) the learning assistance\n\nprogram. Id. These seven appropriations are made primarily from the state general\n\nfund. See, e.g., LAWS OF 2013, 2d Spec. Sess., ch. 4, §§ 501-516 (operational\n\nexpenses for education). 4 Charter schools draw support from these appropriations.\n\n       This funding scheme is both constitutional and consistent with our precedent.\n\nThe general fund is not identified as a restricted fund by article IX, nor are any of\n\nthe seven separate appropriations that comprise the overall funding for public\n\n\n\n       4LAWS OF    2013, 2d Spec.

State, No. 89714-0\nFairhurst, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n\neducation. It is, as the name suggests, a general fund. Even our decision in School\n\nDistrict No. 20 v. Bryan, relied on heavily by the majority, acknowledged that \"all\n\nexperiments in education must be indulged, if at all, at the expense of the general\n\nfund.\" 51 Wash. 498, 505, 99 P. 28 (1909).\n\n       The majority \"find[s] unconvincing the State's view that charter schools may\n\nbe constitutionally funded through the general fund\" because restricted funds are not\n\nsegregated from unrestricted funds. Majority at 16. Not only does this directly\n\ncontradict established case law, see Bryan, 51 Wash. at 505, but taken to its full\n\nlogical extent, it would mean that any expenditure from the general fund would be\n\nunconstitutional unless it was for the support of common schools. 5 This cannot be\n\nthe case.\n\n       The majority also attempts to classify the entire $7.095 billion appropriation\n\nfor public education as a restricted fund by relying on inapposite statutes and case\n\nlaw. The majority cites to RCW 28A.150.380 to support its claim that the entire\n\nappropriation for public education is restricted. Majority at 15. But RCW\n\n28A.150.380(1) provides only that the legislature must \"appropriate for the current\n\nuse of the common schools such amounts as needed for state support to school\n\n\n\n\n       5\n        In addition to K-12 schools, the general fund is used to support critical functions such as\nhuman services, higher education, governmental operating costs, and natural resources. See OFFICE\nOF FIN. MGMT., supra, at 6.\n\n\n                                                9\n\fLeague of Women Voters v. State, No. 89714-0\nFairhurst, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n\ndistricts.\" This statute is not an appropriations bill but, rather, a general mandate.\n\nThe statute does not appropriate funds, nor does it even reference any of the seven\n\nappropriations that comprise our funding for public education. Most importantly, the\n\nstatute does not prohibit the legislature from supporting additional, noncommon\n\nschool educational programs with resources from the unrestricted portion of the\n\ngeneral fund. In fact, the second half of this statute, RCW 28A.150 .3 80(2), expressly\n\npermits appropriations for other educational programs, with no common school\n\nlimitation. (The legislature may fund \"special programs to enhance or enrich the\n\nprogram ofbasic education.\"). Indeed, programs, such as Running Start, that are not\n\nunder the control of local voters and are thus not common schools, receive support\n\nthrough the $7.095 billion appropriation for public education. See LAWS OF 2013, 2d\n\nSpec. Sess., ch. 4, § 502(18); WASI-l. STATE BD. FOR CMTY. & TECH.

State Board for Vocational Education\n\nv. Yelle, 199 Wash. 312,91 P.2d 573 (1939). Majority at 13-14. There, the legislature\n\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\fLeague of Women Voters v. State, No. 89714-0\nFairhurst, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n\nappropriated approximately $64,000 \"'from the current school fund\"' for the State\n\nBoard for Vocational Education in order to secure matching funds from the federal\n\ngovernment. Yelle, 199 Wash. at 313 (quoting LAWS OF 1939, ch. 223, § 2, at 940).\n\nThe court emphasized and heavily relied on the fact that the appropriation came from\n\nthe current school fund, which by definition was '\"to be applied exclusively to the\n\ncommon schools.\"' !d. at 316 (quoting LAWS OF 1939, ch. 174, § 1, at 530). Thus, it\n\nmade sense that once money was allocated to the current school fund, it could not\n\nthereafter be diverted to a noncommon school.\n\n       But Yelle does not control because our funding mechanism for public\n\neducation has materially changed since Yelle was decided in 1939. See Fed. Way\n\nSch. Dist. No. 210 v. State, 167 Wn.2d 514, 525,219 P.3d 941 (2009) (distinguishing\n\nprior case law on grounds that funding system had been replaced by a \"completely\n\nnew and different funding mechanism\"). The legislature no longer uses the current\n\nschool fund, and, in fact, the current school fund is extinct. This likely explains why\n\nno court, until the majority, has ever cited to Yelle since it was first published nearly\n\n80 years ago. The legislature now supports public education primarily through the\n\ngeneral fund. See LAWS OF 2013, 2d Spec. Sess., ch. 4, §§ 501-516 (operational\n\nexpenses for education). Unlike the current school fund, the general fund is\n\ninherently unrestricted and may be used to support charter schools. Yelle did not\n\nforbid the legislature from using unrestricted resources in the general fund for other\n\n\n                                           11\n\fLeague of Women Voters v. State, No. 89714-0\nFairhurst, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n\neducation purposes. Indeed, after Yelle, the legislature made a nearly identical\n\nappropriation to the Board for Vocational Education but this time from the general\n\nfund instead ofthe current school fund. Compare LAWS OF 1939, ch. 223, § 2, at 940\n\n(\"FROM THE CURRENT SCHOOL FUND\"), with LAws OF 1941, ch. 234, § 2, at\n\n748 (\"FROM THE GENERAL FUND\").\n\n      The majority also cites to our plurality decision in Mitchell, where the\n\nlegislature attempted to transport private school students with buses supported by\n\nrestricted funds. 17 Wn.2d at 63-64. There, the State admitted that \"the directors of\n\nthe school district are using public funds 'from the state permanent school fund and\n\nthe current school fund' (italics ours) for the transportation, in a school bus, of\n\nchildren eligible to attend the common public schools to and from the Christian\n\nschool.\" Id. at 64. Relying in part on this admission, the lead opinion noted that in\n\norder to carry out the legislation, \"the directors of school districts must, of necessity,\n\nresort to the common school fund.\" Id. at 66. By contrast, the State here will not\n\nnecessarily have to resort to the common school fund or any restricted fund in order\n\nto support charter schools. Notably, the concurrence in Mitchell recognized that\n\nschools that were not common schools could qualify for student transportation under\n\nthe legislation so long as restricted funds were not used. Id. at 70-71 (Grady, J.,\n\n\n\n\n                                            12\n\fLeague of Women Voters v. State, No. 89714-0\nFairhurst, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n\nconcurring). The text of the Act does not command the use of restricted funds, and,\n\nas discussed above, the State may fund charter schools with general funds. 6\n\n       The majority believes that once money is appropriated to our public schools\n\nfrom the general fund, it becomes restricted solely for the benefit of common\n\nschools. See majority at 12-13. Although the seven separate appropriations listed\n\nabove can reasonably be considered public school funds, they are not common\n\nschool funds. We recognized this critical distinction in Moses Lake School District\n\nNo. 161 v. Big Bend Community College, concluding that while the diverted\n\nresources in that case might \"have been public school funds, none were 'common\n\nschool funds.\"' 81 Wn.2d 551, 560, 503 P.2d 86 (1972); see also Seattle Sch. Dist.\n\nNo. 1 v. State, 90 Wn.2d 476, 521, 585 P.2d 71 (1978) (\"[T]he constitutional\n\ndraftsmen must have contemplated that funds, other than common school funds,\n\nwere available for and used to educate our resident children.\" (emphasis omitted)).\n\nThe majority conflates the legislature's appropriation for public education with\n\ncommon school funds, an approach we have long rejected. See Pac. Mfg. Co. v. Sch.\n\nDist. No. 7, 6 Wash. 121, 33 P. 68 (1893). Because charter schools are part of our\n\nsystem of public education, they are a proper recipient of public school funds.\n\n\n       6\n         The majority also cites to Leonard v. City of Spokane, 127 Wn.2d 194, 897 P.2d 358\n(1995). Majority at 15. But that case involved the direct usurpation of the state tax for common\nschools. Leonard, 127 Wn.2d at 199 (invalidating the legislation because it diverted revenue from\nproperty tax that would otherwise constitute the state tax for common schools). No such diversion\nexists here. Again, charter schools would receive support from the general fund.\n\n\n                                               13\n\fLeague of Women Voters v.

Appellants fail to meet their burden under a facial challenge\n\n      Because the Act was enacted through the initiative process, we begin with the\n\npresumption that it is constitutional. Amalgamated Transit Union Local587 v. State,\n\n142 Wn.2d 183, 205, 11 P.3d 762, 27 P.3d 608 (2000). Appellants have raised a\n\nfacial challenge against the Act and must prove that the Act is unconstitutional\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. Jd. This requires a showing that the statute cannot be\n\nconstitutionally applied under any circumstances. Id. \"'[A] facial challenge must be\n\nrejected if there are any circumstances where the statute can constitutionally be\n\napplied.\"' Lummi Indian Nation v. State, 170 Wn.2d 247,258,241 P.3d 1220 (2010)\n\n(quoting Wash. StateRepublicanPartyv. Pub. Disclosure Comm'n, 141 Wn.2d245,\n\n282 n.14, 4 P.3d 808 (2000)).\n\n       The majority faults the State for not being able to \"demonstrate that these\n\nrestricted moneys are protected from being spent on charter schools.\" Majority at\n\n15. This impermissibly shifts the burden of proof to the State. 7 It is well settled that,\n\nin a facial challenge, the burden rests on the plaintiff, here appellants. Amalgamated\n\nTransit, 142 Wn.2d at 205. Appellants fail to meet their burden for two reasons.\n\n\n\n       7\n        The majority also runs contrary to the established presumption of constitutionality. \"'In\nmatters of economic legislation, we follow the rule giving every reasonable presumption in favor\nof the constitutionality of the law or ordinance.\"' Leonard, 127 Wn.2d at 198 (quoting Sofie v.\nFibreboard Corp., 112 Wn.2d 636, 642-43, 771 P.2d 260 (1989)). Here, because charter schools\ncomprise only two percent of Washington's public schools, it is reasonable to assume that they\ncan be funded using a portion of the $5.092 billion that is not restricted.\n\n\n                                               14\n\fLeague of Women Voters v. State, No. 89714-0\nFairhurst, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n\n      First, as discussed at length above, appellants cannot prove that charter\n\nschools will receive resources from any of the three restricted funds. In Moses Lake\n\nSchool District No. 161, we placed the burden on the plaintiffs to show that\n\nconstitutionally restricted funds were being diverted. 81 Wn.2d at 559-60. We\n\nconcluded that the plaintiffs there could show no more than the diversion of public\n\nschool funds, which are distinguishable from common school funds as referenced\n\nby article IX. Id. at 560. Similarly, appellants here can show no more than the use of\n\ngeneral funds that have been appropriated to our public education system, of which\n\ncharter schools are a part. Notably, appellants concede that unrestricted revenue\n\nfrom the general fund can be used to support noncommon schools, stating that\n\n\"[n]othing prevents the Legislature or school districts from using unrestricted funds\n\nto support ... supplemental programs and services.\" Reply Br. of Appellants at 18.\n\n       Second, even assuming that appellants and the majority were correct and the\n\nentire appropriation for public education was restricted solely for the use of common\n\nschools, the nature of an appropriation is that it is finite and renewed every two years.\n\nSee Wash. State Legislature v. State, 139 Wn.2d 129, 145,985 P.2d 353 (1999) (\"[A]\n\nbudget bill, by its nature, appropriates funds for a finite time period-two years.\").\n\nThe legislature is free to adjust its appropriations with any new biennial budget.\n\nThus, it is well within the realm of possibility that the legislature may appropriate\n\ncharter school funding separate and apart from the basic education appropriation in\n\n\n                                           15\n\fLeague of Women Voters v. State, No. 89714-0\nFairhurst, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n\nfuture budget bills. Indeed, in Yelle, the remedy was to fund vocational education\n\nusing monies from the general fund the following biennium, not to abolish\n\nvocational schools. Compare LAWS OF 1939, ch. 223, § 2, at 940, with LAWS OF\n\n1941, ch. 234, § 2, at 748. Because nothing prohibits the legislature from expressly\n\nappropriating funds to support charter schools separate and apart from the\n\nappropriation for public education in the next biennium, appellants' facial challenge\n\nmust fai1. 8\n\n        As a final note, the flaws that appellants and the majority find with the current\n\nfunding scheme are born from the way in which the State manages restricted funds,\n\nnot through any fault of the Act or the voters who passed the Act. While the State's\n\naccounting may be troubling, I do not find the Act itself to be unconstitutional on its\n\nface.\n\nB.      Provisions of the Act declaring charter schools to be common schools are\n        severable\n\n        Provisions within an act are not severable if \"it cannot reasonably be believed\n\nthat the legislative body would have passed one without the other\" or if\"elimination\n\nof the invalid part would render the remaining part useless to accomplish the\n\nlegislative purposes.\" Amalgamated Transit, 142 Wn.2d at 227-28. Appellants argue\n\n\n\n        8\n         0ne might think in future bienniums the legislature might appropriate resources from\nrestricted funds to support charter schools. This the legislature cannot do because our state\nconstitution prohibits appropriations from restricted funds.\n\n                                             16\n\fLeague of Women Voters v. State, No. 89714-0\nFairhurst, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n\nthat voters would not have passed I-1240 if they knew that charter schools were not\n\ncommon schools and, as such, could not be funded with restricted common school\n\nfunds. I disagree for three reasons.\n\n      First, I-1240 would have passed even though charter schools may not receive\n\nrestricted funds. I-1240 does not state that charter schools will receive restricted\n\nfunds, and voters were never told anything to this effect. Rather, I-1240 states in\n\ngeneral terms that charter schools shall \"receive funding based on student enrollment\n\njust like existing public schools.\" RCW 28A.710.005(1)(n)(vii); see also RCW\n\n28A.710.220(2) (requiring the Superintendent to fund charter schools without\n\nreference to restricted funds). I-1240 and the voters' pamphlet do not reference\n\nrestricted funds likely because the current funding scheme for public education does\n\nnot distinguish between restricted and unrestricted funds, and, thus, there was no\n\nframework to discuss this issue.\n\n       While the voters' pamphlet reveals that voters were very concerned about\n\nfunding, this concern centered on the diversion of funds from local school districts\n\nrather than the source of funding. See CP at 553 (arguments for and against I-1240).\n\nImportantly, voters were never misled about the effect of I-1240 on local school\n\ndistricts. In fact, voters were repeatedly informed that I-1240 would \"shift revenues,\n\nexpenditures and costs between local public school districts or from local public\n\nschool districts to charter schools, primarily from movement in student enrollment\n\n\n                                           17\n\fLeague of Women Voters v. State, No. 89714-0\nFairhurst, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n\n... result[ing] in an indeterminate, but non-zero, fiscal impact to local public school\n\ndistricts.\" CP at 549 (emphasis added). Appellants allege that voters were misled to\n\nbelieve I-1240 was a \"zero-sum game.\" Br. of Appellants at 28. This is inaccurate\n\nbecause the voters' pamphlet repeatedly described the fiscal impact of I-1240 as\n\n\"indeterminate, but non-zero.\" CP at 549-51 (discussing the nonzero fiscal impact\n\non nine occasions). Voters were properly informed. Because there is nothing to\n\nindicate that voters were concerned about the source of the funding, I-1240 would\n\nhave passed even though charter schools are not eligible to receive restricted funds.\n\n       Second, I-1240 contains a severability clause. See CP at 78. \"A severability\n\nclause may provide the assurance that the legislative body would have enacted\n\nremaining sections even if others are found invalid.\" Amalgamated Transit, 142\n\nWn.2d at 228. The majority correctly points out that a severability clause is not\n\ndispositive on the question of whether the legislative body would have enacted the\n\nremainder of the act. Majority at 18. But we have recently stated that \"[w]here the\n\ninitiative passed by the people contains a severability clause, the court may view this\n\nas 'conclusive as to the circumstances asserted unless it can be said that the\n\ndeclaration is obviously false on its face.\"' League of Educ. Voters v. State, 176\n\nWn.2d 808, 827, 295 P.3d 743 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting\n\nMcGown v. State, 148 Wn.2d 278, 296, 60 P.3d 67 (2002)). Appellants have not\n\n argued that the severability clause is obviously false. I would uphold the severability\n\n\n                                           18\n\fLeague of Women Voters v. State, No. 89714-0\nFairhurst, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n\nclause and apply it here, concluding that the people would likely have passed the Act\n\neven if charter schools were not common schools.\n\n       Finally, elimination of the common school provisions would not render the\n\nAct useless to accomplish its purpose. The purpose of I-1240 was to establish 40\n\ncharter schools over the next five years. RCW 28A.710.005(1)(n). This purpose may\n\nbe accomplished without designating public charter schools as common schools.\n\n       The majority believes that the voters would never have passed the Act without\n\na funding source. Majority at 19. But the voters did just that because the Act itself\n\ndoes not contain any reference to a source of funding. This is not an uncommon\n\noccurrence, as Washington voters have enacted unfunded initiatives in the past. See\n\nFed. Way Sch. Dist. No. 210, 167 Wn.2d at 520 (acknowledging voters passed\n\nlegislation mandating cost of living increases for teachers but that the legislation\n\nprovided no funding source).\n\n       I agree with the majority that charter schools are not common schools. But\n\nnothing in the Act requires the diversion of resources out of the three funds identified\n\nby article IX as restricted for the benefit of common schools. Rather, the State can\n\nconstitutionally support charter schools through the general fund. I would not\n\ninvalidate the Act but, rather, would hold that appellants cannot meet their burden\n\non this facial challenge. I respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.\n\n\n\n\n                                           19\n\fLeague of Women Voters v. State, No. 89714-0\nFairhurst, J.

We hold that the provisions of I-1240 that designate and treat charter\n\nschools as common schools violate article IX, section 2 of our state constitution and are\n\nvoid. This includes the Act's funding provisions, which attempt to tap into and shift a\n\nportion of moneys allocated for common schools to the new charter schools authorized\n\nby the Act. Because the provisions designating and funding charter schools as common\n\nschools are integral to the Act, such void provisions are not severable, and that\n\ndetermination is dispositive of the present case.\n\n                                          FACTS\n\n       In November 2012, Washington voters approved I-1240, codified in the Act,\n\nproviding for the establishment of up to 40 charter schools within five years. Clerk's\n\nPapers (CP) at 39-78; RCW 28A.710.150(1). The Act was intended to provide parents\n\nwith \"more options\" regarding the schooling of their children. RCW 28A.710.005(1)(f);\n\nsee also RCW 28A.710.020(1) (new charter schools are public \"common school[s] open\n\nto all children free of charge\"). But the new schools came with a trade-off: the loss of\n\nlocal control and 1local accountability. Charter schools must provide a basic education,\n\nsimilar to traditional public schools, including instruction in the essential academic\n\nlearning requirements, which are developed by the superintendent of public instruction.\n\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fNo. 89714-0\n\n\nSee RCW 28A.710.040(2)(b); former RCW 28A.655.070(1)-(2) (2013). However, under\n\nthe Act's provisions, charter schools \"free teachers and principals from burdensome\n\nregulations that limit other public schools\" thereby giving charter schools \"the flexibility\n\nto innovate\" regarding staffing and curriculum. RCW 28A.710.005(l)(g). Charter\n                 }\n\n\n\nschools are exempt from many state rules. With the exception of \"the specific state\n\nstatutes and rules\" identified in RCW 28A.710.040(2) and any \"state statutes and rules\n\nmade applicable to the charter school in the school's charter contract,\" charter schools are\n\n\"not subject to and are exempt from all other state statutes and rules applicable to school\n\ndistricts and school district boards of directors ... in areas such as scheduling, personnel,\n\nfunding, and educational programs.\" RCW 28A.710.040(3).\n\n       Under the Act, charter schools are devoid of local control from their inception to\n\ntheir daily operation. 1 Charter schools can be approved in two ways. First, the\n\nWashington Charter School Commission, which is an \"independent state agency\"\n                 ;·\n\n\n\nestablished by the Act and made up of nine appointed members, has the power to\n\nestablish charter schools anywhere in the State. See RCW 28A.710.070(1)-(2), .080(1). 2\n\nSecond, school districts may apply to the Washington State Board of Education for\n\npermission to authorize charter schools. RCW 28A.710.080(2). The commission and\n\napproved school districts (referred to as \"charter school authorizers\") solicit charter\n\napplications, approve or deny applications, and negotiate and execute charter contracts.\n\n       1\n          Charter schools are formed upon the application of a nonsectarian, nonprofit\ncorporation, see RCW 28A.710.010(1), .040(4), and are governed by an appointed charter school\nboard. RCW 28A.l70.010(6), .020(3).\n        2\n          All commission members must have a \"commitment to charter schooling as a strategy\nfor strengthening public education.\" RCW 28A.710.070(3).\n\n                                              3\n\fNo. 89714-0\n\n\nRCW 28A.710.100(1). Charter school authorizers also monitor performance and legal\n\ncompliance of charter schools, RCW 28A.710.180(1), but such oversight cannot \"unduly\n\ninhibit the autonomy granted to charter schools,\" RCW 28A.710.180(2), and such\n\noversight must also be consistent with the principles and standards developed by another\n\nprivate   organiza~ion,   the National Association of Charter School Authorizers. RCW\n\n28A.71 0.1 00(3). 3\n\n          As for daily operation, charter schools are not governed by elected local school\n\nboards. Instead, .charter schools are operated by a \"charter school board,\" RCW\n\n28A.710.020(3), which is \"appointed or selected under the terms of a charter application\n\nto manage and operate the charter school.\" RCW 28A.710.010(6). The board is\n\nresponsible for functions typically handled by an elected school board, including hiring,\n\nmanaging, and discharging employees; receiving and disbursing funds; entering\n\ncontracts; and determining enrollment numbers. RCW 28A.710.030(1), .050(5).\n\n          As for funding, the Act requires the superintendent to apportion funds to charter\n\nschools on the same basis as public school districts. See RCW 28A.710.220, .230(1).\n\nSuch disbursements include basic education moneys appropriated by the legislature in the\n\nbiennial operating budget for the use of common schools and moneys from the common\n\nschool construction fund. See RCW 28A.710.220(2), .230(1); RCW 28A.l50.380(1),\n\n.250(1).\n\n\n\n\n          3\n        The commission has authorized seven charter schools. Spokane Public Schools, a\nschool district authorizer, has authorized one charter school.\n\n\n                                                4\n\fNo. 89714-0\n\n\n      Alarmed over the lack of local accountability and fiscal impacts of the Act,\n\nappellants 4 sued the State of Washington in King County Superior Court, seeking a\n\ndeclaratory judgment that the Act is unconstitutional. 5 Several supporters of charter\n\nschools intervenyd. 6 All three parties moved for summary judgment, and the trial court\n\ngranted summary judgment to the State and intervenors on all issues but one. The trial\n\ncourt held that charter schools are not \"common schools\" under article IX of\n\nWashington's Constitution and, therefore, the common school construction fund could\n\nnot be appropriated to charter schools. CP at 1043, 1045. The trial court found,\n\nhowever, that the provisions permitting such appropriations were severable. The trial\n\ncourt concluded that the Act was otherwise constitutional. All parties sought direct\n\nreview, which we granted.\n\n                                         ANALYSIS\n\n       We begin by noting what this case is not about.

Act, money that is dedicated to common schools is unconstitutionally\n\ndiverted to charter schools. As noted, the Act provides that charter schools are to be\n\nfunded on the same basis as common schools. The superintendent must distribute money\n\nfrom the constitutionally restricted basic education allocation to charter schools on the\n\nsame basis as common schools. See RCW 28A.710.220(2). 12 In other words, under the\n\n\n          12\n         A portion of the basic education allocation is derived from the state levy on real\nproperty designated for support of common schools.

CONST. art. IX,§§ 2, 3. Article IX, section 2 also\n\nextended constitutional protection to any \"state tax for common schools.\" In Yelle, 199\n\nWash. at 316, this court addressed the restrictions on the use ofbasic education funds\n\nallocated to common schools. Yelle struck down a law that would have diverted tax\n\nrevenues allocated to the common schools to support a vocational rehabilitation program\n\noperated by a state board. !d. This court explained that it was \"beside the question\" that\n\nthe vast majority of state funding in place at that time, whether derived from tax revenues\n\nor \"cash on hand,\" could have been allocated to other purposes in the first instance. !d.\n\nThe constitutional protection afforded to common school appropriations is not dependent\n\non the source of the revenue (i.e., the type of tax or other funding source) or the account\n\n\n       13\n           After the October 28, 2014 oral argument in this case, the State filed a statement of\nadditional authority on July 22,2015 citing Laws of2015, chapter 4, section 516(5) as\nsupporting the notion that \"charter schools can operate without access to constitutionally\nrestricted revenue.\" Statement of Additional Auth. at 1-2. Section 516(5) is a subsection ofthe\noperating budget regarding funding for the 2015-2017 biennium, and provides, \"State general\nfund appropriations distributed through Part V of this act for the operation and administration of\ncharter schools as provided in chapter 28A. 71 0 RCW shall not include state common school levy\nrevenues collected under RCW 84.52.065.\" LAWS OF 2015, ch. 4, § 516(5). This legislation,\nwhich is express!)~ effective on June 30,2015 and is prospective in its application, does not alter\nour analysis or coi1clusion concerning the effect of the Act as previously passed by the voters in\n2012 and codified in 2013. The validity of section 516(5) as a substantive law provision buried\nwithin an operating budget is not before us. For present purposes it is enough to note that section\n516(5) does not assist the State.\n\n\n                                                13\n\fNo. 89714-0\n\n\nin which the funds are held (i.e., the general fund or other state fund). Rather, this court\n\nheld that all money \"allocated to the support of the common schools ... constitute[ s] a\n\n'state tax for the common schools' in contemplation of Art. IX,§ 2, of the constitution.\"\n\nId. Yelle continued, \"[O]nce appropriated to the support of the common schools,\" funds\n\ncannot \"subsequently be diverted to other purposes.\" Id. at 317. This court cautioned\n\nthat to hold otherwise \"would be calamitous.\" Jd.\n\n       Similarly, in Mitchell this court explained that the use of any common school\n\nfunds for other than a common school purpose violates the constitution. There, this court\n\nheld unconstitutional a statute that extended school bus transportation privileges to\n\nprivate school students along already existing and operating public school bus routes.\n\nThis court rejected the argument that the statute did not impose any additional expense on\n\nthe school district in that the private school students would merely join the public school\n\nstudents on the school bus's established and regular route. Mitchell, 17 Wn.2d at 66.\n\nAlthough the statute in question did not identify or make any appropriation for carrying\n\nout its purpose, because its operation would have the effect of utilizing common school\n\nfunds for other than common school purposes, it contravened article IX, section 2's\n\nexclusivity requirement. Jd. Restated, the statute's overall fiscal neutrality did not affect\n\nits constitutional infirmity. Also, even though the statute did not address funding, the fact\n\nthat it's intended operation would \"necessitate[] the use of common school funds for\n\nother than common school purposes\" rendered it unconstitutional. !d.\n\n\n\n\n                                              14\n\fNo. 89714-0\n\n\n      Under the; Act, charter schools receive funds from the legislature's basic education\n\nallocation for the common schools. See RCW 28A.710.220(2). By statute, all of the\n\nbasic education funds in the biennial operations budget are designated for the exclusive\n\nuse ofthe common schools. RCW 28A.l50.380(1) (\"The state legislature shall, at each\n\nregular session in an odd-numbered year, appropriate for the current use of the common\n\nschools such amounts as needed for state support to school districts during the ensuing\n\nbiennium for the program of basic education under RCW 28A.l50.200.\"). These funds\n\n\"made available by the legislature for the current use of the common schools\" are then\n\ndistributed annually by the Superintendent to \"each school district of the state operating a\n\nbasic education instructional program.\" RCW 28A.l50.250(1). That the specific\n\ncommon school property levy is only a portion of the state funds used to support common\n\nschools does not alter the protection afforded to the entire basic education allocation as a\n\n\"'state tax for common schools\"' within the meaning of article IX, section 2. Yelle, 199\n\nWn.2d at 316-17 (quoting CONST. art. IX, § 2). The Act unconstitutionally reallocates\n\nthese restricted funds to charter schools, which do not qualify as common schools. ·\n\n       Compounding this problem, the State does not segregate constitutionally restricted\n\nmoneys from other state funds. Nor can it demonstrate that these restricted moneys are\n\nprotected from being spent on charter schools. Cf id. at 317; Leonard, 127 Wn.2d at 199\n\n(act violated artiide IX, section 2 because it diverted revenues that under the existing\n\nstatutory scheme would otherwise be used to support the common schools). Given this\n\nabsence of segregation and accountability, we find unconvincing the State's view that\n\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\fNo. 89714-0\n\n\ncharter schools may be constitutionally funded through the general fund. See Br. of\n\nResp't/Cross-Appellant State of Wash. at 30-31. Historically, the state common school\n\nfunds were maintained in a separate public school account and distributed to the common\n\nschools by the Superintendent. See, e.g., Yelle, 199 Wash. at 314-15. While some other\n\nconstitutionally restricted state funds continue to be maintained in separate accounts (e.g.,\n\ncommon school construction fund (WASH. CONST. art. IX,§ 3), gas taxes for\n\ntransportation purposes (WASH. CONST. art. II,§ 40)), since at least 1967, the\n\nconstitutionally restricted common school property levy revenues have been deposited in\n\nthe State's \"general fund,\" which is used for the basic education allocation. See RCW\n\n84.52.067; LAws OF 1967, Ex. Sess., ch. 133, § 2. There is no way to track the restricted\n\ncommon school funds or to ensure that these dollars are used exclusively to support the\n\ncommon schools.\n\n       In addition to the diversion of basic education funds, the Act diverts funds from\n\nthe common school construction fund established under article IX, section 3. See RCW\n\n28A.710.230(1).·· The school construction fund, unlike other restricted common school\n\nfunds, continues to be held in a segregated account. See RCW 28A.515.320. The trial\n\ncourt correctly held that the Charter School Act's provisions authorizing diversion of\n\nthese restricted funds are unconstitutional.\n\n       Our constitution directs the legislature to establish and fund common schools and\n\nrestricts the legislature's power to divert funds committed to common schools for other\n\npurposes even if related to education. CONST. art. IX,§§ 1-3. The Charter School Act's\n\n\n\n\n                                               16\n\fNo. 89714-0\n\n\ndiversion of basic education funds allocated to the support of the common schools and\n\ncommon school construction funds is unconstitutional and void.\n\n      We also disagree with the State's view that the Act's remaining provisions are\n\nsaved because funding \"follows the student\" and in any event charter schools could be\n\nfunded out ofthe state general fund. Br. ofResp't/Cross-Appellant State of Wash. at 40.\n\nThe fact that public school money distributions are generally based on per capita student\n\nattendance does not mean that common school funds are available for students who do\n\nnot attend common schools.

Relevant here, the legislation directed the\n\nsuperintendent of public instruction to apportion moneys \"'out of the funds available for\n\nthe support of the common schools'\" in an amount reflecting \"'the number of pupils in\n\nattendance'\" at the model training school and distribute such portion to the noted boards.\n\nBryan, 51 Wash. at 500-01 (quoting LAWS OF 1907, ch. 97, § 4). In other words, under\n\nthe legislation in· question the money would follow the student. This court affirmed the\n\ntrial court's ruling that such legislation \"'which seeks to apportion or appropriate any part\n\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\fNo. 89714-0\n\n\nof the common school fund or revenue therefrom or state tax for the support of the\n\ncommon schools is unconstitutional and void.\"' !d. at 501.\n\n      Further, as discussed above, the Act designates and relies on common school\n\nfunds as its funding source. Without those funds, the Act cannot function as intended.\n\nNotably, 1-1240 supporters' statements in the voters' pamphlet assured voters that charter\n\nschools would be funded out of the current school system by merely shifting existing\n\nschool funding. In response to criticism that 1-1240 \"diverts taxpayer money into\n\nunaccountable . . . charter schools [and] ... will drain millions of dollars from existing\n\nclassrooms,\" CP at 553, supporters stated in the pamphlet that\"[ c]harter schools are\n\npublic schools, open to all students, accountable to a local school board or state\n\ncommission, and do not take a penny from our public school system or students. They're\n\nfunded based on student enrollment just like other public schools.\" Jd. at 553.\n\n       The Act 's1nvalid Provisions Are Not Severable\n\n       The next question is whether the above noted unconstitutional provisions render\n\nthe Act unconstitutional in its entirety. \"A legislative act is not unconstitutional in its\n\nentirety unless invalid provisions are unseverable.\" Amalgamated Transit Union Local\n\n587 v.

The test for\n\nseverability is whether the unconstitutional provisions are so connected to the remaining\n\nprovisions that it cannot be reasonably believed that the legislative body would have\n\npassed the remainder of the act's provisions without the invalid portions, or unless\n\nelimination of the invalid part would render the remaining part useless to accomplish the\n\n\n\n\n                                               18\n\fNo. 89714-0\n\n\nlegislative purposes.

While the\n\npresence of a severability clause may provide assurance that the legislative body would\n\nhave enacted remaining sections without the invalid portions, a severability clause is not\n\nnecessarily dispositive on the question of whether the legislative body would have\n\nenacted the remainder ofthe act. Amalgamated, 142 Wn.2d at 228. Here, the Act\n\ncontains a severability clause, but the invalid provisions are so intertwined with the\n\nremainder of the Act and so fundamental to the Act's efficacy that under either of the\n\nabove tests the invalid portions are not severable.\n\n       The Act identifies charter schools as common schools and is expressly reliant on\n\ncommon school funding to support such charter schools. That a funding source is\n\nrequired for the existence of charter schools is self-evident. As discussed above, the Act\n\nspecifically intends to use common school funding allocations as that source. Without a\n\nvalid funding source the charter schools envisioned in I-1240 are not viable. Moreover,\n\nI- 1240's voters' pamphlet stressed that the funding for charter schools will come from\n\nexisting funding sources in the form of a \"shift [in] revenues\" from \"local public school\n\ndistricts to charter schools.\" CP at 549. In sum, without funding, charter schools are not\n\nviable. Nor can it be believed that voters would have approved the Charter School Act\n\nwithout its funding mechanism. See Leonard, 127 Wn.2d at 202 (act's funding\n\nmechanism is its \"heart and soul\" and act would be \"virtually worthless\" without it; thus,\n\nthe funding mechanism is not severable from the remainder of the act).\n\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\fNo. 89714-0\n\n\n       In sum, the Charter School Act violates article IX, section 2 because charter .\n\nschools are not common schools despite the Act's attempt to so designate them. The\n\nAct's designated funding mechanisms fail, and these provisions are not severable from\n\nthe remainder of:.the Charter School Act. 14\n\n                                       CONCLUSION\n\n       The portions ofl-1240 designating charter schools as common schools violate\n\narticle IX, section 2 of the Washington Constitution and are invalid. For the same reason,\n\nthe portions ofl-1240 providing access to restricted common school funding are also\n\ninvalid. These provisions are not severable and render the entire Act unconstitutional.\n\nWe affirm in part and reverse in part and remand for an appropriate order.\n\n\n\n\n       14\n         Because these determinations are dispositive of this case, we do not address the parties'\nother arguments.

(concurring in part and dissenting in part)-We must decide\n\nwhether newly created charter schools are \"common schools\" as defined by article\n\nIX, section 2 of the Washington Constitution and, if not, whether the charter schools\n\nact (Act), codified at chapter 28A.710 RCW, requires the State to support charter\n\nschools with funds that are constitutionally restricted to the benefit of common\n\nschools. I agree that charter schools are not common schools. But because nothing\n\nin the Act expressly requires the use of restricted funds, the Act is facially valid.\n\nSince charter schools may be constitutionally funded with unrestricted monies from\n\nthe general fund, I concur in part and dissent in part.\n\n       In November 2012, Washington voters approved Initiative 1240 (1-1240),\n\ncodified in the Act, allowing up to 40 charter schools to open within five years. The\n\nAct was intended to provide parents with \"more options to find the best learning\n\nenvironment for their children.\" RCW 28A.710.005(1)(f). Under the Act, charter\n\nschools would be operated by nonprofit, nonsectarian organizations. RCW\n\n28A.710.010(1), .040(4). Further, charter schools must be free and open to all\n\n\n\n\n                                            1\n\fLeague of Women Voters v. State, No. 89714-0\nFairhurst, J.

RCW\n\n28A.710.005(1)(g). For example, all teachers must be state certificated. RCW\n\n28A.710.040(2)(c). Like traditional public schools, charter schools are required to\n\nprovide a basic education through instruction in the essential academic learning\n\nrequirements (EALRs). RCW 28A.710.040(2)(b). EALRs are developed by the\n\nsuperintendent of public instruction (Superintendent) and prescribe the substantive\n\ncontent taught to all of Washington's public school students, often spanning several\n\nhundred pages per subject. Charter schools are also subject to performance\n\nimprovement goals advanced by the state Board of Education. RCW\n\n28A. 71 0.040(2)(g).\n\n       When it comes to evaluating performance, charter schools are assessed under\n\nthe same statewide student assessment system developed and overseen by the\n\nSuperintendent.

Common schools can and must function without using constitutionally\n       restricted funds\n\n       Washington's constitution identifies three funds whose use is restricted solely\n\nfor the benefit of common schools. The Act does not require the use of monies from\n\nany of these funds. The current funding scheme for charter schools and public\n\neducation is consistent with our constitution and precedent. The appellants,! making\n\na facial challenge, fail to meet their burden.\n\n       1.     The Act does not divert resources from any of the three restricted funds\n\n       Sections 2 and 3 of article IX identify three protected funds: the permanent\n\ncommon school fund, the state tax for common schools, and the common school\n\n\n       1\n        The plaintiffs/appellants consist of several nonprofit organizations and community\nmembers: the League of Women Voters of Washington; El Centro De Le Raza; Washington\nAssociation of School Administrators; Washington Education Association; Wayne Au, PhD; Pat\nBraman; Donna Boyer; and Sarah Lucas (hereinafter collectively appellants).\n\n\n                                            3\n\fLeague of Women Voters v. State, No. 89714-0\nFairhurst, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n\nconstruction fund. The legislature cannot use revenue from any of these restricted\n\nfunds for purposes other than to support common schools. Mitchell v. Canso!. Sch.\n\nDist.

There are two components of the permanent common school fund that we\n\nmust consider-the principal of the fund and the interest that accrues on the fund.\n\n      In 1967, the legislature froze the principal of the permanent common school\n\nfund. LAWS OF 1967, ch. 29, § 1, at 98. To this day, our constitution requires that the\n\nprincipal of the fund must remain intact. CONST. art. IX,§ 3; RCW 28A.515.300(2).\n\nThe Act does not direct the legislature to expend any principal, nor do appellants\n\nallege that the principal of the fund has been improperly appropriated.\n\n       Neither has the interest been diverted to the support of charter schools. When\n\nthe fund was created in 1889, our constitution provided that \"interest accruing on\n\n[the permanent common school fund,] ... shall be exclusively applied to the current\n\nuse of the common schools.\" CONST. art. IX, § 3 (1889). However, when the\n\nlegislature froze the principal of the fund in 1967, it directed all of the interest\n\naccruing on the fund toward the newly created common school construction fund,\n\nwhich was dedicated solely to common school construction. CONST. art. IX, § 3.\n\nThus, the interest from the permanent common school fund is not and cannot be used\n\nfor any school operating costs. Appellants therefore cannot show that any money\n\n\n                                            4\n\fLeague of Women Voters v. State, No. 89714-0\nFairhurst, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n\nfrom the permanent common school fund is being diverted to support charter\n\nschools.\n\n       Second, the state tax for common schools, codified in RCW 84.52.065, levies\n\n\"for the support of common schools of the state a tax of three dollars and sixty cents\n\nper thousand dollars.\" Currently, revenue from the state tax for common schools is\n\nplaced into the general fund, RCW 84.52.067, from which our public education\n\nsystem receives support, LAWS OF 2013, 2d Spec. Sess., ch. 4, §§ 501-516. As\n\ndiscussed in more detail below, the state tax for common schools constitutes only a\n\nfraction of the total appropriation to our public schools. For example, in fiscal year\n\n2015, the appropriation for public education amounted to roughly $7.095 billion\n\nfrom the general fund. LAWS OF 2013, 2d Spec. Sess., ch. 4, §§ 502, 505, 507, 510-\n\n511, 514-515. Of this, only $2.003 billion consists of the state tax for common\n\nschools. WASH. STATE ECON. & REVENUE FORECAST COUNCIL, WASHINGTON STATE\n\nECONOMIC AND REVENUE FORECAST                   69   (2014),   http://www.erfc.wa.gov/\n\npublications/documents/sep14pub.pdf. Thus, only 28 percent of the revenue\n\nappropriated for public education from the general fund is restricted. Because charter\n\nschools account for merely 2 percent of Washington's public schools, they can\n\ncertainly be funded through the remaining 72 percent of the appropriation from the\n\ngeneral fund. Importantly, nowhere does the Act expressly require the State to fund\n\ncharter schools with revenue from the state tax for common schools.\n\n\n                                            5\n\fLeague of Women Voters v. State, No. 89714-0\nFairhurst, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n\n      Finally, article IX, section 3 created the third restricted fund when it\n\n\"established the common school construction fund to be used exclusively for the\n\npurpose of financing the construction of facilities for the common schools.\" The text\n\nof the Act does not actually require the State to provide such funding from the\n\ncommon school construction fund. The Act simply provides that \"[c]harter schools\n\nare eligible for state matching funds for common school construction.\" RCW\n\n28A.710.230(1). A review ofthe 2013 session laws reveals that the legislature funds\n\nschool construction from both the state building construction account and the\n\ncommon school construction account. See LAWS OF 2013, ch. 19, §§ 5001-5030, at\n\n2734-43. In fact, the majority of public school construction is funded by the state\n\nbuilding construction account. Id. Thus, while the legislature may not appropriate\n\nfrom the common school construction fund for construction or repair of charter\n\nschools, nothing would prevent it from using the state building construction account\n\nor even unrestricted revenues in the general fund. Appellants fail to establish that the\n\nAct will divert any revenue from the common school construction fund.\n\n       Contrary to the majority's view, the Act does not expressly require the use of\n\nany of the three restricted funds. The majority points to RCW 28A.710.220(2).\n\nMajority at 12-13. That statute provides that\"[ c]ategorical funding must be allocated\n\nto a charter school based on the same funding criteria used for noncharter public\n\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\fLeague of Women Voters v. State, No. 89714-0\nFairhurst, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n\nschools.\" 2 On its face, this statute does not require the State to support charter\n\nschools with restricted funds. Taken in context, this provision relates to the amount\n\nof money that a charter school may receive and requires that charter schools be\n\nsubject to the same per-pupil formula as other public schools. It plainly says nothing\n\nabout the source of funding. In fact, nowhere does the Act identify a source of\n\nfunding, it merely states that charter schools must \"receive funding based on student\n\nenrollment just like existing public schools.\" RCW 28A.710.005(1)(n)(vii). Because\n\nthe Act neither identifies a source of funding nor commands the use of restricted\n\nfunds to support charter schools, it withstands appellants' facial challenge and is\n\nconstitutional. 3\n\n\n\n\n       2\n         The full text ofRCW 28A.710.220(2) states:\n        According to the schedule established under RCW 28A.51 0.250, the superintendent\n        of public instruction shall allocate funding for a charter school including general\n        apportionment, special education, categorical, and other nonbasic education\n        moneys. Allocations must be based on the statewide average staff mix ratio of all\n        noncharter public schools from the prior school year and the school's actual full-\n        time equivalent enrollment. Categorical funding must be allocated to a charter\n        school based on the same funding criteria used for noncharter public schools and\n        the funds must be expended as provided in the charter contract. A charter school is\n        eligible to apply for state grants on the same basis as a school district.\n        3The majority also cites to three other statutes for the proposition that the Act's terms\n\nidentify restricted funds as the source of funding. Majority at 13 (citing RCW 28A.510.250; RCW\n84.52.065, .067). First, none of these statutes are located within the Act and are thus not relevant\nto appellants' claim that the Act is facially invalid. Second, these statutes plainly do not require\nthe use of restricted funds. In fact, none of them discuss the source of funding for charter schools.\nSee RCW 28A.510.250 (establishing a schedule for when the Superintendent must allocate funds\nto schools); RCW 84.52.065 (requiring the State to levy a tax for common schools), .067 (requiring\nthe state tax for common schools to be deposited into the general fund).\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fLeague of Women Voters v.

The current funding scheme for charter schools is constitutional and\n              consistent with precedent\n\n      The State now funds public education primarily through the general fund.\n\nWASH. STATE OFFICE OF FIN. MGMT., A GUIDE TO THE WASH. STATE BUDGET\n\nPROCESS 6 (2014), http://www.ofm.wa.gov/reports/budgetprocess.pdf(45.1 percent\n\nof the general fund is spent on K-12 education). According to the Washington State\n\nOffice of Financial Management, there are seven separate appropriations that\n\ncomprise the overall allocations to public schools. Clerk's Papers (CP) at 1032.\n\nThese include appropriations for (1) general apportionment, (2) pupil transportation,\n\n(3) special education, (4) institutional education programs, (5) programs for highly\n\ncapable students, (6) transitional bilingual programs, and (7) the learning assistance\n\nprogram. Id. These seven appropriations are made primarily from the state general\n\nfund. See, e.g., LAWS OF 2013, 2d Spec. Sess., ch. 4, §§ 501-516 (operational\n\nexpenses for education). 4 Charter schools draw support from these appropriations.\n\n       This funding scheme is both constitutional and consistent with our precedent.\n\nThe general fund is not identified as a restricted fund by article IX, nor are any of\n\nthe seven separate appropriations that comprise the overall funding for public\n\n\n\n       4LAWS OF    2013, 2d Spec.

Majority at 16. Not only does this directly\n\ncontradict established case law, see Bryan, 51 Wash. at 505, but taken to its full\n\nlogical extent, it would mean that any expenditure from the general fund would be\n\nunconstitutional unless it was for the support of common schools. 5 This cannot be\n\nthe case.\n\n       The majority also attempts to classify the entire $7.095 billion appropriation\n\nfor public education as a restricted fund by relying on inapposite statutes and case\n\nlaw. The majority cites to RCW 28A.150.380 to support its claim that the entire\n\nappropriation for public education is restricted. Majority at 15. But RCW\n\n28A.150.380(1) provides only that the legislature must \"appropriate for the current\n\nuse of the common schools such amounts as needed for state support to school\n\n\n\n\n       5\n        In addition to K-12 schools, the general fund is used to support critical functions such as\nhuman services, higher education, governmental operating costs, and natural resources. See OFFICE\nOF FIN. MGMT., supra, at 6.\n\n\n                                                9\n\fLeague of Women Voters v. State, No. 89714-0\nFairhurst, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n\ndistricts.\" This statute is not an appropriations bill but, rather, a general mandate.\n\nThe statute does not appropriate funds, nor does it even reference any of the seven\n\nappropriations that comprise our funding for public education. Most importantly, the\n\nstatute does not prohibit the legislature from supporting additional, noncommon\n\nschool educational programs with resources from the unrestricted portion of the\n\ngeneral fund. In fact, the second half of this statute, RCW 28A.150 .3 80(2), expressly\n\npermits appropriations for other educational programs, with no common school\n\nlimitation. (The legislature may fund \"special programs to enhance or enrich the\n\nprogram ofbasic education.\"). Indeed, programs, such as Running Start, that are not\n\nunder the control of local voters and are thus not common schools, receive support\n\nthrough the $7.095 billion appropriation for public education.

There, the legislature\n\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\fLeague of Women Voters v. State, No. 89714-0\nFairhurst, J.

Yelle, 199 Wash. at 313 (quoting LAWS OF 1939, ch. 223, § 2, at 940).\n\nThe court emphasized and heavily relied on the fact that the appropriation came from\n\nthe current school fund, which by definition was '\"to be applied exclusively to the\n\ncommon schools.\"' !d. at 316 (quoting LAWS OF 1939, ch. 174, § 1, at 530). Thus, it\n\nmade sense that once money was allocated to the current school fund, it could not\n\nthereafter be diverted to a noncommon school.\n\n       But Yelle does not control because our funding mechanism for public\n\neducation has materially changed since Yelle was decided in 1939. See Fed. Way\n\nSch. Dist. No. 210 v.

The legislature no longer uses the current\n\nschool fund, and, in fact, the current school fund is extinct. This likely explains why\n\nno court, until the majority, has ever cited to Yelle since it was first published nearly\n\n80 years ago. The legislature now supports public education primarily through the\n\ngeneral fund. See LAWS OF 2013, 2d Spec. Sess., ch. 4, §§ 501-516 (operational\n\nexpenses for education). Unlike the current school fund, the general fund is\n\ninherently unrestricted and may be used to support charter schools. Yelle did not\n\nforbid the legislature from using unrestricted resources in the general fund for other\n\n\n                                           11\n\fLeague of Women Voters v. State, No. 89714-0\nFairhurst, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n\neducation purposes. Indeed, after Yelle, the legislature made a nearly identical\n\nappropriation to the Board for Vocational Education but this time from the general\n\nfund instead ofthe current school fund. Compare LAWS OF 1939, ch. 223, § 2, at 940\n\n(\"FROM THE CURRENT SCHOOL FUND\"), with LAws OF 1941, ch. 234, § 2, at\n\n748 (\"FROM THE GENERAL FUND\").\n\n      The majority also cites to our plurality decision in Mitchell, where the\n\nlegislature attempted to transport private school students with buses supported by\n\nrestricted funds. 17 Wn.2d at 63-64. There, the State admitted that \"the directors of\n\nthe school district are using public funds 'from the state permanent school fund and\n\nthe current school fund' (italics ours) for the transportation, in a school bus, of\n\nchildren eligible to attend the common public schools to and from the Christian\n\nschool.\" Id. at 64. Relying in part on this admission, the lead opinion noted that in\n\norder to carry out the legislation, \"the directors of school districts must, of necessity,\n\nresort to the common school fund.\" Id. at 66. By contrast, the State here will not\n\nnecessarily have to resort to the common school fund or any restricted fund in order\n\nto support charter schools. Notably, the concurrence in Mitchell recognized that\n\nschools that were not common schools could qualify for student transportation under\n\nthe legislation so long as restricted funds were not used. Id. at 70-71 (Grady, J.,\n\n\n\n\n                                            12\n\fLeague of Women Voters v. State, No. 89714-0\nFairhurst, J.

The text of the Act does not command the use of restricted funds, and,\n\nas discussed above, the State may fund charter schools with general funds. 6\n\n       The majority believes that once money is appropriated to our public schools\n\nfrom the general fund, it becomes restricted solely for the benefit of common\n\nschools. See majority at 12-13. Although the seven separate appropriations listed\n\nabove can reasonably be considered public school funds, they are not common\n\nschool funds. We recognized this critical distinction in Moses Lake School District\n\nNo. 161 v.

State, No. 89714-0\nFairhurst, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n\n      First, as discussed at length above, appellants cannot prove that charter\n\nschools will receive resources from any of the three restricted funds. In Moses Lake\n\nSchool District No. 161, we placed the burden on the plaintiffs to show that\n\nconstitutionally restricted funds were being diverted. 81 Wn.2d at 559-60. We\n\nconcluded that the plaintiffs there could show no more than the diversion of public\n\nschool funds, which are distinguishable from common school funds as referenced\n\nby article IX. Id. at 560. Similarly, appellants here can show no more than the use of\n\ngeneral funds that have been appropriated to our public education system, of which\n\ncharter schools are a part. Notably, appellants concede that unrestricted revenue\n\nfrom the general fund can be used to support noncommon schools, stating that\n\n\"[n]othing prevents the Legislature or school districts from using unrestricted funds\n\nto support ... supplemental programs and services.\" Reply Br. of Appellants at 18.\n\n       Second, even assuming that appellants and the majority were correct and the\n\nentire appropriation for public education was restricted solely for the use of common\n\nschools, the nature of an appropriation is that it is finite and renewed every two years.\n\nSee Wash. State Legislature v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 145,985 P.2d 353 (1999) (\"[A]\n\nbudget bill, by its nature, appropriates funds for a finite time period-two years.\").\n\nThe legislature is free to adjust its appropriations with any new biennial budget.\n\nThus, it is well within the realm of possibility that the legislature may appropriate\n\ncharter school funding separate and apart from the basic education appropriation in\n\n\n                                           15\n\fLeague of Women Voters v. State, No. 89714-0\nFairhurst, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n\nfuture budget bills. Indeed, in Yelle, the remedy was to fund vocational education\n\nusing monies from the general fund the following biennium, not to abolish\n\nvocational schools. Compare LAWS OF 1939, ch. 223, § 2, at 940, with LAWS OF\n\n1941, ch. 234, § 2, at 748. Because nothing prohibits the legislature from expressly\n\nappropriating funds to support charter schools separate and apart from the\n\nappropriation for public education in the next biennium, appellants' facial challenge\n\nmust fai1. 8\n\n        As a final note, the flaws that appellants and the majority find with the current\n\nfunding scheme are born from the way in which the State manages restricted funds,\n\nnot through any fault of the Act or the voters who passed the Act. While the State's\n\naccounting may be troubling, I do not find the Act itself to be unconstitutional on its\n\nface.\n\nB.      Provisions of the Act declaring charter schools to be common schools are\n        severable\n\n        Provisions within an act are not severable if \"it cannot reasonably be believed\n\nthat the legislative body would have passed one without the other\" or if\"elimination\n\nof the invalid part would render the remaining part useless to accomplish the\n\nlegislative purposes.\" Amalgamated Transit, 142 Wn.2d at 227-28. Appellants argue\n\n\n\n        8\n         0ne might think in future bienniums the legislature might appropriate resources from\nrestricted funds to support charter schools. This the legislature cannot do because our state\nconstitution prohibits appropriations from restricted funds.\n\n                                             16\n\fLeague of Women Voters v. State, No. 89714-0\nFairhurst, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n\nthat voters would not have passed I-1240 if they knew that charter schools were not\n\ncommon schools and, as such, could not be funded with restricted common school\n\nfunds. I disagree for three reasons.\n\n      First, I-1240 would have passed even though charter schools may not receive\n\nrestricted funds. I-1240 does not state that charter schools will receive restricted\n\nfunds, and voters were never told anything to this effect. Rather, I-1240 states in\n\ngeneral terms that charter schools shall \"receive funding based on student enrollment\n\njust like existing public schools.\" RCW 28A.710.005(1)(n)(vii); see also RCW\n\n28A.710.220(2) (requiring the Superintendent to fund charter schools without\n\nreference to restricted funds). I-1240 and the voters' pamphlet do not reference\n\nrestricted funds likely because the current funding scheme for public education does\n\nnot distinguish between restricted and unrestricted funds, and, thus, there was no\n\nframework to discuss this issue.\n\n       While the voters' pamphlet reveals that voters were very concerned about\n\nfunding, this concern centered on the diversion of funds from local school districts\n\nrather than the source of funding. See CP at 553 (arguments for and against I-1240).\n\nImportantly, voters were never misled about the effect of I-1240 on local school\n\ndistricts. In fact, voters were repeatedly informed that I-1240 would \"shift revenues,\n\nexpenditures and costs between local public school districts or from local public\n\nschool districts to charter schools, primarily from movement in student enrollment\n\n\n                                           17\n\fLeague of Women Voters v. State, No. 89714-0\nFairhurst, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n\n... result[ing] in an indeterminate, but non-zero, fiscal impact to local public school\n\ndistricts.\" CP at 549 (emphasis added). Appellants allege that voters were misled to\n\nbelieve I-1240 was a \"zero-sum game.\" Br. of Appellants at 28. This is inaccurate\n\nbecause the voters' pamphlet repeatedly described the fiscal impact of I-1240 as\n\n\"indeterminate, but non-zero.\" CP at 549-51 (discussing the nonzero fiscal impact\n\non nine occasions). Voters were properly informed. Because there is nothing to\n\nindicate that voters were concerned about the source of the funding, I-1240 would\n\nhave passed even though charter schools are not eligible to receive restricted funds.\n\n       Second, I-1240 contains a severability clause. See CP at 78. \"A severability\n\nclause may provide the assurance that the legislative body would have enacted\n\nremaining sections even if others are found invalid.\" Amalgamated Transit, 142\n\nWn.2d at 228. The majority correctly points out that a severability clause is not\n\ndispositive on the question of whether the legislative body would have enacted the\n\nremainder of the act. Majority at 18. But we have recently stated that \"[w]here the\n\ninitiative passed by the people contains a severability clause, the court may view this\n\nas 'conclusive as to the circumstances asserted unless it can be said that the\n\ndeclaration is obviously false on its face.\"' League of Educ.

(concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n\nclause and apply it here, concluding that the people would likely have passed the Act\n\neven if charter schools were not common schools.\n\n       Finally, elimination of the common school provisions would not render the\n\nAct useless to accomplish its purpose. The purpose of I-1240 was to establish 40\n\ncharter schools over the next five years. RCW 28A.710.005(1)(n). This purpose may\n\nbe accomplished without designating public charter schools as common schools.\n\n       The majority believes that the voters would never have passed the Act without\n\na funding source. Majority at 19. But the voters did just that because the Act itself\n\ndoes not contain any reference to a source of funding. This is not an uncommon\n\noccurrence, as Washington voters have enacted unfunded initiatives in the past. See\n\nFed. Way Sch. Dist. No. 210, 167 Wn.2d at 520 (acknowledging voters passed\n\nlegislation mandating cost of living increases for teachers but that the legislation\n\nprovided no funding source).\n\n       I agree with the majority that charter schools are not common schools. But\n\nnothing in the Act requires the diversion of resources out of the three funds identified\n\nby article IX as restricted for the benefit of common schools. Rather, the State can\n\nconstitutionally support charter schools through the general fund. I would not\n\ninvalidate the Act but, rather, would hold that appellants cannot meet their burden\n\non this facial challenge. I respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.\n\n\n\n\n                                           19\n\fLeague of Women Voters v. State, No. 89714-0\nFairhurst, J.
