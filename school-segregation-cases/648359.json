See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is\ntherefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is\nnot binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata,\nand collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value\nconsistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.\n\f      In this appeal we are asked to construe a contract assigning an oil and gas\n\nlease. More specifically, the dispute centers on the nature of the interest reserved\n\nby the assignor. The district court ruled in favor of QEP Energy Company (QEP)\n\non the contract-interpretation question. After a bench trial, the court entered\n\njudgment against Christopher M. Sullivan. Mr. Sullivan now appeals pro se the\n\ndistrict court’s judgment. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                                          I.\n\n      In 1970 the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) issued a federal oil and\n\ngas lease to Joseph A. Thomas on 2,556.61 acres of land located in Uintah\n\nCounty, Utah. The lease, which was assigned the identifying number U-11001,\n\nhad a primary 10-year term, but would continue as long as oil and gas was\n\nproduced in paying quantities. Lease U-11001 was subject to a 12½ percent\n\nroyalty on the mineral production removed or sold from the leased lands, payable\n\nto the federal government as lessor.\n\n      BLM regulations require all assignments of record title to be executed on\n\nan official BLM form or an exact copy of the official form. On February 2, 1972,\n\nMr. Thomas assigned all of his record title in lease U-11001 to Raymond\n\nChorney, using a copy of the official BLM assignment form (hereafter Thomas\n\nAssignment). The BLM form asked a series of questions and provided spaces for\n\nfilling in the parties’ responses. It also included printed instructions for\n\n                                         -2-\n\fcompleting and filing the form with the BLM. Section 5 of the Thomas\n\nAssignment states as follows, with the parties’ typewritten insertions on the BLM\n\nform shown in bold:\n\n       5a. What overriding royalty or production payments is the assignor\n       reserving herein? (See Item 4 of General Instructions; specify\n       percentage.) Three Percent (3%) of 8/8, see attached rider.\n        b. What overriding royalties or production payments, if any, were\n       previously reserved? (Percentage only) NONE\n\nR., Vol. 3 at 95. Item 4 of the General Instructions provided:\n\n       Overriding royalties or payments out of production – Describe, in an\n       accompanying statement, any overriding royalties or payments out of\n       production created by assignment but not set out therein. If\n       payments out of production are reserved by assignor, outline in detail\n       the amount, method of payment, and other pertinent terms.\n\nId. at 96. The “attached rider” referenced by the parties in the Thomas\n\nAssignment was another pre-printed form, which provided, in relevant part, as\n\nfollows (again, with the parties’ typewritten insertions shown in bold):\n\n               Assignor hereby excepts and reserves an obligation equal to\n       $ 300.00 per acre for the number of acres assigned hereby, the same\n       to be paid out of 3% of the market value at the wells, as produced,\n       of all the oil and gas which may be produced, saved and marketed\n       from the above described lands under the terms of said lease or any\n       extensions or renewals thereof. All payments made on account of\n       said obligation shall be computed and paid at the same time and in\n       the same manner as royalties payable to the Lessor under the terms of\n       said lease are computed and paid. . . .\n\nId. at 97.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f      In October 1974 a portion of lease U-11001 was committed to a unit plan of\n\ndevelopment, 1 which resulted in segregation of the lease. See id., Vol. 4 at 116;\n\nsee also 43 C.F.R. § 3107.3-2 (providing for segregation of leases, with “one\n\ncovering the lands committed to the plan, the other lands not committed to the\n\nplan”). The acres of land committed to the unit agreement retained lease number\n\nU-11001, and that lease expired in 1987. The remaining acres were assigned\n\nlease number UTU-28652, and that lease remains active.\n\n      In late 1998 or early 1999, Mr. Sullivan learned through a business\n\nacquaintance, Robert Weaver, that revenue payable to Mr. Thomas from his\n\nreserved interest in lease U-11001 was about to be abandoned to the State of Utah\n\nas escheat property. Mr. Weaver and Mr. Sullivan decided to try to acquire\n\nMr. Thomas’s interest, and Mr. Sullivan located Mr. Thomas’s widow, Martha\n\nP. Thomas. On May 13, 1999, Ms. Thomas assigned all of her interest in lease\n\nU-11001, including any segregated portions thereof, to a middleman, Dennis\n\nOliver. Mr. Oliver then assigned his interest to Mr. Sullivan and to Mr. Weaver’s\n\ncompany, B&A Properties, LLC. That assignment provided, in relevant part:\n\n\n1\n       “Unitization refers to the consolidation of mineral or leasehold interests in\noil or gas covering a common source of supply.” Amoco Prod. Co. v. Heimann,\n904 F.2d 1405, 1410 (10th Cir. 1990); see also Lewis C. Cox, Jr. & Gregory J.\nNibert, Law of Federal Oil & Gas Leases § 18.01[2] (Matthew Bender & Co.\n2011) (“Unitization is the agreement to jointly operate an entire producing\nreservoir or a prospectively productive area of oil and/or gas. The entire unit area\nis operated as a single entity, without regard to lease boundaries, and allows for\nthe maximum recovery of production from the reservoir.”).\n\n                                        -4-\n\f      Dennis Oliver . . . does hereby, assign, transfer and quit claim that\n      certain 3.0% Overriding Royalty interest previously reserved by\n      Joseph A. Thomas on 2-2-72, to:\n\n            B&A Properties, LLC . . . (an undivided ½ or 1.50%); and\n\n            Christopher M. Sullivan . . . (an undivided ½ or 1.50%);\n\n      . . . to include all of Assignor’s right, title and interest in and to\n      U.S.A. Lease U-11001, and any extensions, renewals, or segregated\n      portions thereof, including Lease UTU-28652 . . . .\n\nR., Vol. 4 at 120 (emphasis and all caps omitted).\n\n      Mr. Sullivan initially received disbursement of half of the funds that had\n\nbeen scheduled for abandonment to the state. The then-current operators of the\n\nwells on lease UTU-28652 made regular payments to Mr. Sullivan for several\n\nyears. QEP later acquired its interest in lease UTU-28652 and began making\n\npayments to Mr. Sullivan as well. In early 2006 QEP determined that the total\n\npayments to Mr. Sullivan by all operators exceeded his interest in the leases, as\n\nconstrued by QEP. QEP therefore ceased further payments and sought\n\nreimbursement of the overpayment from Mr. Sullivan. He disputed the claim,\n\nasserting that QEP owed him additional payments.\n\n      QEP brought this action in Utah state court, seeking a declaration that the\n\nThomas Assignment reserved a three percent production-payment interest capped\n\nat $300 per acre on the U-11001 lease. QEP alleged that the total amount of the\n\nproduction payment was $766,983.00 ($300 x 2,556.61 acres). It also sought\n\nrecovery from Mr. Sullivan of an alleged overpayment of $86,351.12.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fMr. Sullivan removed the case to federal district court and filed a counterclaim\n\nfor declaratory relief. He alleged that the Thomas Assignment reserved both the\n\n$300-per-acre obligation and a separate three percent overriding-royalty interest.\n\nHe brought additional claims seeking the balance of the payments that he alleged\n\nremained due to him from QEP.\n\n      Both parties filed motions for partial summary judgment on their claims for\n\ndeclaratory relief. The district court held that the Thomas Assignment\n\nunambiguously describes only a three percent production-payment interest and\n\ntherefore granted partial summary judgment in favor of QEP. After a bench trial\n\non the remaining claims, the district court found that QEP established it had\n\noverpaid Mr. Sullivan and was entitled to repayment under a theory of unjust\n\nenrichment. The court entered judgment awarding QEP $86,351.12 in damages,\n\nplus prejudgment and postjudgment interest and costs. It dismissed\n\nMr. Sullivan’s counterclaims with prejudice. He filed a timely appeal in which he\n\nchallenges the district court’s grant of partial summary judgment to QEP. He\n\ncontends that the court misconstrued the Thomas Assignment, requiring reversal\n\nof the final judgment in favor of QEP. 2\n\n\n\n\n2\n      Other than as they relate to construction of the Thomas Assignment,\nMr. Sullivan does not raise any claim of error with respect to the district court’s\nfindings of fact or conclusions of law following the bench trial.\n\n                                           -6-\n\f                                         II.\n\n      We review a district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo.\n\nTrans-Western Petroleum, Inc. v. U.S. Gypsum Co., 584 F.3d 988, 992 (10th Cir.\n\n2009). Summary judgment is appropriate “if the movant shows that there is no\n\ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a\n\nmatter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The district court’s interpretation of the\n\nThomas Assignment is likewise subject to de novo review. See Allison v. Bank\n\nOne-Denver, 289 F.3d 1223, 1244 (10th Cir. 2002). 3\n\n                                         A.\n\n      The parties agree that Utah substantive law applies in this diversity case.\n\n“Utah courts apply the general principles governing the interpretation of contracts\n\nto documents conveying mineral interests.” Trans-Western Petroleum, 584 F.3d\n\nat 993. Our first task is to determine whether the Thomas Assignment is\n\nambiguous with respect to the interest or interests reserved by Mr. Thomas.\n\n      If the language within the four corners of the contract is\n      unambiguous, the parties’ intentions are determined from the plain\n      meaning of the contractual language, and the contract may be\n      interpreted as a matter of law.\n\n            A contractual term or provision is ambiguous if it is capable of\n      more than one reasonable interpretation because of uncertain\n      meanings of terms, missing terms, or other facial deficiencies.\n\n\n3\n      Although we ordinarily liberally construe a pro se party’s filings, that rule\ndoes not apply when, as here, the appellant is also an attorney. See Mann v.\nBoatright, 477 F.3d 1140, 1148 n.4 (10th Cir. 2007).\n\n                                        -7-\n\fId. (citation omitted). Both Mr. Sullivan and QEP contend that the language of\n\nthe Thomas Assignment is unambiguous, but they advance conflicting\n\nconstructions. The fact of their differing positions does not mean that the\n\ncontract is necessarily ambiguous. See Plateau Mining Co. v. Utah Div. of State\n\nLands & Forestry, 802 P.2d 720, 725 (Utah 1990) (“To demonstrate ambiguity,\n\nthe contrary positions of the parties must each be tenable.”); Trans-Western\n\nPetroleum, 584 F.3d at 993 (“[A] finding of ambiguity is justified only if the\n\nlanguage of the contract reasonably supports the competing interpretations.”). 4\n\n                                         1.\n\n      The pertinent language—“Three Percent (3%) of 8/8, see attached\n\nrider.”—was inserted by the parties to the Thomas Assignment in section 5a on\n\nthe BLM form. QEP and Mr. Sullivan concur that the referenced rider describes a\n\nproduction-payment interest entitling Mr. Thomas to receive payments capped at\n\n$300.00 per acre. They also agree that the production payment would be paid out\n\nover time from three percent of the production, as defined in the rider. Their\n\ndispute centers on whether “Three Percent (3%) of 8/8, see attached rider”\n\nreserved only the production-payment interest described in the rider, as QEP\n\n\n\n\n4\n       Utah courts will consider “extrinsic evidence offered to demonstrate that\nthere is in fact an ambiguity.” Trans-Western Petroleum, 584 F.3d at 993.\nNeither QEP nor Mr. Sullivan argues that extrinsic evidence establishes that the\nThomas Assignment is facially ambiguous.\n\n                                         -8-\n\fcontends; or two, separate interests, as Mr. Sullivan contends, namely a three\n\npercent overriding royalty and the undisputed production-payment interest.\n\n                                          2.\n\n      Despite Mr. Sullivan’s contentions otherwise, there is no dispute here\n\nregarding the similarities and differences between an overriding royalty and a\n\nproduction payment. 5 Both are nonoperating interests in an oil and gas lease,\n\n“that is, an interest which is entitled to receive some percentage of the production\n\nor income attributable to the lessee’s estate but is not obligated to bear any of the\n\ndevelopment (e.g., drilling) or operation (e.g., lifting) costs associated therewith.”\n\nFrank W.R. Hubert, Jr. & James A. Taylor, Oil & Gas § 14.01 (Rocky Mountain\n\nMineral Law Inst. 1985); see also Aplt. Opening Br. at 35 (acknowledging\n\noverriding royalties and production payments are “separate and distinct interests,\n\npaid from a non-operating share of lease production”). An overriding royalty is\n\nmost commonly understood as “an interest in oil and gas produced at the surface,\n\nfree of the expense of production, and carved from the working interest held\n\nunder an oil and gas lease.” Hubert & Taylor, § 14.02[1] (quotation omitted). An\n\noverriding royalty continues for the entire duration of a lease. Id.\n\n\n\n\n5\n      Mr. Sullivan asserts that, contrary to QEP’s contention, overriding royalties\nand production payments are not synonymous. But QEP did not advance that\nargument, nor did the district court adopt that position.\n\n                                         -9-\n\f      Similarly, a production payment (sometimes called an oil payment),\n\n“refer[s] to an interest created out of the lessee’s estate which is a share of the\n\nminerals produced from described premises, free of the costs of production at the\n\nsurface.” Id. But a production payment terminates when the lease expires, or\n\nsooner if the owner of the interest has received the agreed quantum of production\n\nor dollar amount from the sale of production. See id.; see also Sullivan v. Utah\n\nBd. of Oil, Gas & Mining, 189 P.3d 63, 65 n.2 (Utah 2008) (“An overriding\n\nroyalty is an interest running throughout the term of the lease, while a production\n\npayment is an interest running only until it has yielded a specified sum of\n\nmoney.” (quotation, ellipsis & brackets omitted)); Williams & Meyers, Oil & Gas\n\nLaw § 422.3 (Matthew Bender & Co. 2011) (“An oil payment differs from an\n\noverriding royalty in that its duration is limited to the time required for the stated\n\nnumber of units of production or the sum specified in the instrument creating the\n\noil payment to be realized; an overriding royalty, on the other hand, normally has\n\nthe same duration as the working interest out of which it was created. In most\n\nother respects, however, an oil payment and an overriding royalty have\n\nsubstantially identical characteristics.”).\n\n                                              B.\n\n      Although the terms “overriding royalty” or “production payment” are not\n\nfound in the Thomas Assignment, QEP and Mr. Sullivan agree that other words\n\ncan be used to reserve these types of interests. Regarding the language at issue\n\n                                          -10-\n\fhere—“Three Percent (3%) of 8/8, see attached rider.”—QEP and Mr. Sullivan\n\nconcur that the term “8/8,” as used in the oil and gas industry, refers to 100\n\npercent of the production from a well. As QEP explains, the BLM’s standard\n\nlandowner royalty is 12½ percent, which is equal to 1/8 of the production. Thus,\n\nstating a reserved interest as a percentage of 8/8 confirms that payment will be\n\nmade from 100 percent of production, rather than from only 7/8 of the production\n\nnet of the BLM’s 1/8 royalty.\n\n      Mr. Sullivan argues that “3% of 8/8” is common industry terminology used\n\nto reserve an overriding royalty. He contends that, standing alone, “Three Percent\n\n(3%) of 8/8” specifies an overriding royalty to be paid out of three percent of 100\n\npercent of gross production from the wells. QEP does not challenge these\n\ncontentions. But as QEP points out, the language Mr. Sullivan emphasizes does\n\nnot stand alone in the Thomas Assignment. First, this language is followed by a\n\ncomma and the words “see attached rider.” Second, the language was inserted on\n\nthe BLM form in response to the question, “What overriding royalty or production\n\npayments is the assignor reserving herein?,” and the additional instruction,\n\n“specify percentage.” R., Vol. 3 at 95. 6\n\n\n6\n       QEP does contest Mr. Sullivan’s further assertion that “8/8” is used\nexclusively to define the extent of production from which an overriding royalty\nwill be paid out and never to define that same term with respect to a production\npayment. Whether a contractual term has a specialized meaning in the relevant\nindustry is a question of fact. See R&R Energies v. Mother Earth Indus., Inc.,\n                                                                      (continued...)\n\n                                            -11-\n\f                                         1.\n\n      The district court concluded that the words “see attached rider,” which\n\nwere separated from “Three Percent (3%) of 8/8” by a comma, related back to the\n\npreceding text, such that the rider provided a more-detailed description of the\n\nterms of the stated three percent interest. The court therefore rejected\n\nMr. Sullivan’s contention that the operative language reserved two interests.\n\nMr. Sullivan argues on appeal that the words before and after the comma form\n\ntwo separate, independent clauses, and he maintains that the district court’s\n\nholding ignores a long-standing rule of grammar used to identify independent\n\nclauses in a sentence. He contends that the first clause, “Three Percent (3%) of\n\n8/8,” stands alone to describe in clear industry terms the reservation of an\n\n\n6\n (...continued)\n936 P.2d 1068, 1074 (Utah 1997). While Mr. Sullivan repeats his contention\nregarding this specialized meaning of “8/8” numerous times in his briefs, he fails\nto cite to evidence in the record supporting it, as required by Fed. R. App. P.\n28(a)(9)(A) (providing appellant’s argument “must contain . . . appellant’s\ncontentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of\nthe record on which the appellant relies” (emphasis added)); see also Reinhardt\nv. Albuquerque Pub. Sch. Bd. of Educ., 595 F.3d 1126, 1131 (10th Cir. 2010)\n(“Unsupported conclusory allegations do not create a genuine issue of fact.”\n(quotation omitted)). We therefore decline to consider Mr. Sullivan’s argument.\nSee Aquila, Inc. v. C.W. Mining, 545 F.3d 1258, 1268 (10th Cir. 2008) (refusing\nto consider argument where appellant provided no citation within voluminous\nrecord to support factual claim). Were we to consider his contention, however,\nwe note that at least one commentator has emphasized the importance of\nspecifying the fraction of production from which a production payment will be\nmade. See Williams & Meyers, § 422.4(d) (“[I]t is important to specify clearly\nwhether the payment is to be made from a fraction of 8/8ths of the production or a\nfraction of a fraction of production . . . .”).\n\n                                        -12-\n\foverriding royalty, while the second clause, “see attached rider,” stands alone to\n\nreference and incorporate the rider, which describes and creates an unrelated\n\nproduction-payment interest. But Mr. Sullivan’s construction requires the court\n\nto ignore, rather than apply, the grammar rule he cites. See William Strunk Jr. &\n\nE.B White, The Elements of Style 5 (50th ed. 2009) (instructing “[d]o not join\n\nindependent clauses with a comma” (emphasis omitted)); see also William A.\n\nSabin, The Gregg Reference Manual § 1088 (10th ed. 2005) (noting the error in\n\nseparating two independent clauses solely by a comma).\n\n                                         2.\n\n      QEP’s construction of the Thomas Assignment does not rest entirely on the\n\nparties’ use of a comma. QEP also notes that the operative language was added in\n\nresponse to a question on the standard BLM form: “What overriding royalty or\n\nproduction payments is the assignor reserving herein?” R., Vol. 3 at 95. 7 In\n\nresponding to this question, the form referred the parties to Item 4 of the General\n\nInstructions and further instructed them to “specify percentage.” Id. The form\n\nalso required the parties to disclose the percentage of overriding royalties or\n\nproduction payments, if any, that were previously reserved.\n\n\n\n\n7\n      Despite the BLM form’s use of the term “or,” neither Mr. Sullivan nor QEP\ncontends that the parties could only create an overriding royalty or production\npayments, but not both, in the Thomas Assignment.\n\n                                        -13-\n\f      QEP points to a then-current regulation to explain why the BLM form\n\nsought disclosure of the percentage of these types of interests, both new and\n\npreviously reserved. At the time the Thomas Assignment was executed, a\n\nregulation precluded agreements creating overriding royalties or production\n\npayments which aggregated in excess of 17½ percent, when added to the royalty\n\npayable to the United States and to previously reserved overriding royalties or\n\nproduction payments. See R., Vol. 3 at 83 (text of 43 C.F.R. § 3103.3-6 (1972)). 8\n\nThus, to the extent they aggregated more than five percent, overriding royalties or\n\nproduction payments would be considered “excess” when added to the United\n\nStates’ standard 12½ percent royalty. But such excess reservations did not violate\n\nthe terms of a lease if the agreement provided that the obligation to pay them\n\nwould be suspended when average production fell below a minimum amount. See\n\nid.\n\n\n8\n      The then-current regulation provided:\n\n            An agreement creating overriding royalties or payments out of\n      production of oil which, when added to overriding royalties or\n      payments out of production of oil previously created and to the\n      royalty payable to the United States, aggregate in excess of 17½\n      percent shall be deemed a violation of the terms of the lease unless\n      such agreement expressly provides that the obligation to pay such\n      excess overriding royalty or payments out of production of oil shall\n      be suspended when the average production of oil per well per day\n      averaged on the monthly basis is 15 barrels or less.\n\nR., Vol. 3 at 83 (text of 43 C.F.R. § 3103.3-6 (1972)). As indicated by the text,\nthis provision applied only to oil production. See id.\n\n                                        -14-\n\f      We assume that the parties to the Thomas Agreement contracted with\n\nknowledge of the existing regulatory scheme. See Wash. Nat’l Ins. Co. v.\n\nSherwood Assoc., 795 P.2d 665, 669 n.7 (Utah App. 1990). Thus, consistent with\n\nthe then-current regulation, we construe the instruction to “specify percentage” in\n\nsection 5a of the BLM form as requiring the parties to specify the total percentage\n\nof the two stated types of interests being reserved in the assignment, whether they\n\nbe overriding royalties or payments out of production. See id. at 669\n\n(“[C]ontracts embrace laws which affect their validity, construction, discharge,\n\nand enforcement.”) 9\n\n                                         3.\n\n      Under Mr. Sullivan’s construction of the Thomas Assignment, Mr. Thomas\n\nreserved a three percent overriding royalty and a three percent production\n\npayment, for a total new reserved-interest percentage of six percent. Yet the\n\nparties specified only three percent in section 5a. Mr. Sullivan attempts to\n\nexplain this discrepancy by pointing to the language of Item 4 of the General\n\nInstructions, which directed the parties to “[d]escribe in an accompanying\n\nstatement, any overriding royalties or payments out of production created by\n\n\n9\n      QEP points to the lack of an express provision regarding the suspension of\nexcess royalties in the Thomas Assignment, as further evidence that the parties\ndid not reserve interests aggregating greater than five percent. Mr. Sullivan\nresponds that the Thomas Assignment does contain the required suspension\nprovision. We need not resolve that dispute in order to construe the operative\nlanguage in the Thomas Assignment.\n\n                                        -15-\n\fassignment but not set out therein.” R., Vol. 3 at 96 (emphasis added). He notes\n\nthat a production-payment interest could not feasibly be described in full in the\n\nsmall space provided on the BLM form. Therefore, he contends the General\n\nInstructions permitted the parties to “set out” the terms of a production-payment\n\ninterest entirely in a separate statement rather than on the assignment form\n\nitself—and that is what the parties to the Thomas Assignment did in this case.\n\n      We are not persuaded. We must “consider each contract provision in\n\nrelation to all of the others, with a view toward giving effect to all and ignoring\n\nnone.” Café Rio, Inc. v. Larkin-Gifford-Overton, LLC, 207 P.3d 1235, 1240\n\n(Utah 2009) (quotation & ellipsis omitted). “Seeming contradictions must be\n\nharmonized if that course is reasonably possible.” Vitagraph, Inc. v. Am. Theatre\n\nCo., 291 P. 303, 306 (Utah 1930). Thus, “[a] construction which entirely\n\nneutralizes one provision should not be adopted if the contract is susceptible of\n\nanother which gives effect to all of its provisions.” Id.\n\n      Mr. Sullivan’s construction of Item 4 of the General Instructions as\n\npermitting the parties to describe a production payment being reserved, including\n\nthe percentage of production from which it would be paid, solely in a separate\n\nstatement, contradicts section 5a. That section asked what overriding royalty or\n\nproduction payments were being reserved in the assignment and explicitly\n\ndirected the parties to specify the percentage. Because we must give effect to\n\nboth of these instructions in the BLM form, Mr. Sullivan’s interpretation is not\n\n                                         -16-\n\ftenable. Thus, we construe Item 4 of the General Instructions as directing the\n\nparties to set out in a separate statement any terms of an overriding royalty or\n\nproduction payment reserved in the assignment other than the percentage of the\n\ninterest that the parties were explicitly directed to specify in section 5a. The\n\nparties to the Thomas assignment did just that by stating “Three Percent (3%) of\n\n8/8,” in section 5a, followed by a reference to the rider, which described the\n\nadditional terms of the three percent production payment, as required by Item 4 of\n\nthe General Instructions. See R., Vol. 3 at 96 (directing parties reserving\n\npayments out of production to “outline in detail the amount, method of payment,\n\nand other pertinent terms”).\n\n                                         III.\n\n      Read as a whole, we find no ambiguity in the language of the Thomas\n\nAssignment with respect to the interest reserved by Mr. Thomas. The language\n\ndoes not reasonably support Mr. Sullivan’s interpretation that Mr. Thomas\n\nreserved both a three percent overriding royalty and the three percent production\n\npayment described in the rider. See Trans-Western Petroleum, 584 F.3d at 993\n\n(“[A] finding of ambiguity is justified only if the language of the contract\n\nreasonably supports the competing interpretations.”). We hold that the parties’\n\ninsertion of the words “Three Percent (3%) of 8/8, see attached rider” in\n\n\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\fsection 5a of the BLM form created the three percent production-payment\n\ninterest, the terms of which were further defined in the referenced rider.\n\n      The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n                                                    Entered for the Court\n\n\n\n                                                    Wade Brorby\n                                                    Senior Circuit Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\f",

It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value\nconsistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.\n\f      In this appeal we are asked to construe a contract assigning an oil and gas\n\nlease. More specifically, the dispute centers on the nature of the interest reserved\n\nby the assignor. The district court ruled in favor of QEP Energy Company (QEP)\n\non the contract-interpretation question. After a bench trial, the court entered\n\njudgment against Christopher M. Sullivan. Mr. Sullivan now appeals pro se the\n\ndistrict court’s judgment. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                                          I.\n\n      In 1970 the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) issued a federal oil and\n\ngas lease to Joseph A. Thomas on 2,556.61 acres of land located in Uintah\n\nCounty, Utah. The lease, which was assigned the identifying number U-11001,\n\nhad a primary 10-year term, but would continue as long as oil and gas was\n\nproduced in paying quantities. Lease U-11001 was subject to a 12½ percent\n\nroyalty on the mineral production removed or sold from the leased lands, payable\n\nto the federal government as lessor.\n\n      BLM regulations require all assignments of record title to be executed on\n\nan official BLM form or an exact copy of the official form. On February 2, 1972,\n\nMr. Thomas assigned all of his record title in lease U-11001 to Raymond\n\nChorney, using a copy of the official BLM assignment form (hereafter Thomas\n\nAssignment). The BLM form asked a series of questions and provided spaces for\n\nfilling in the parties’ responses. It also included printed instructions for\n\n                                         -2-\n\fcompleting and filing the form with the BLM. Section 5 of the Thomas\n\nAssignment states as follows, with the parties’ typewritten insertions on the BLM\n\nform shown in bold:\n\n       5a. What overriding royalty or production payments is the assignor\n       reserving herein? (See Item 4 of General Instructions; specify\n       percentage.) Three Percent (3%) of 8/8, see attached rider.\n        b. What overriding royalties or production payments, if any, were\n       previously reserved? (Percentage only) NONE\n\nR., Vol. 3 at 95. Item 4 of the General Instructions provided:\n\n       Overriding royalties or payments out of production – Describe, in an\n       accompanying statement, any overriding royalties or payments out of\n       production created by assignment but not set out therein. If\n       payments out of production are reserved by assignor, outline in detail\n       the amount, method of payment, and other pertinent terms.\n\nId. at 96. The “attached rider” referenced by the parties in the Thomas\n\nAssignment was another pre-printed form, which provided, in relevant part, as\n\nfollows (again, with the parties’ typewritten insertions shown in bold):\n\n               Assignor hereby excepts and reserves an obligation equal to\n       $ 300.00 per acre for the number of acres assigned hereby, the same\n       to be paid out of 3% of the market value at the wells, as produced,\n       of all the oil and gas which may be produced, saved and marketed\n       from the above described lands under the terms of said lease or any\n       extensions or renewals thereof. All payments made on account of\n       said obligation shall be computed and paid at the same time and in\n       the same manner as royalties payable to the Lessor under the terms of\n       said lease are computed and paid. . . .\n\nId. at 97.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f      In October 1974 a portion of lease U-11001 was committed to a unit plan of\n\ndevelopment, 1 which resulted in segregation of the lease. See id., Vol. 4 at 116;\n\nsee also 43 C.F.R. § 3107.3-2 (providing for segregation of leases, with “one\n\ncovering the lands committed to the plan, the other lands not committed to the\n\nplan”). The acres of land committed to the unit agreement retained lease number\n\nU-11001, and that lease expired in 1987. The remaining acres were assigned\n\nlease number UTU-28652, and that lease remains active.\n\n      In late 1998 or early 1999, Mr. Sullivan learned through a business\n\nacquaintance, Robert Weaver, that revenue payable to Mr. Thomas from his\n\nreserved interest in lease U-11001 was about to be abandoned to the State of Utah\n\nas escheat property. Mr. Weaver and Mr. Sullivan decided to try to acquire\n\nMr. Thomas’s interest, and Mr. Sullivan located Mr. Thomas’s widow, Martha\n\nP. Thomas. On May 13, 1999, Ms. Thomas assigned all of her interest in lease\n\nU-11001, including any segregated portions thereof, to a middleman, Dennis\n\nOliver. Mr. Oliver then assigned his interest to Mr. Sullivan and to Mr. Weaver’s\n\ncompany, B&A Properties, LLC.

The then-current operators of the\n\nwells on lease UTU-28652 made regular payments to Mr. Sullivan for several\n\nyears. QEP later acquired its interest in lease UTU-28652 and began making\n\npayments to Mr. Sullivan as well. In early 2006 QEP determined that the total\n\npayments to Mr. Sullivan by all operators exceeded his interest in the leases, as\n\nconstrued by QEP. QEP therefore ceased further payments and sought\n\nreimbursement of the overpayment from Mr. Sullivan. He disputed the claim,\n\nasserting that QEP owed him additional payments.\n\n      QEP brought this action in Utah state court, seeking a declaration that the\n\nThomas Assignment reserved a three percent production-payment interest capped\n\nat $300 per acre on the U-11001 lease. QEP alleged that the total amount of the\n\nproduction payment was $766,983.00 ($300 x 2,556.61 acres). It also sought\n\nrecovery from Mr. Sullivan of an alleged overpayment of $86,351.12.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fMr. Sullivan removed the case to federal district court and filed a counterclaim\n\nfor declaratory relief. He alleged that the Thomas Assignment reserved both the\n\n$300-per-acre obligation and a separate three percent overriding-royalty interest.\n\nHe brought additional claims seeking the balance of the payments that he alleged\n\nremained due to him from QEP.\n\n      Both parties filed motions for partial summary judgment on their claims for\n\ndeclaratory relief. The district court held that the Thomas Assignment\n\nunambiguously describes only a three percent production-payment interest and\n\ntherefore granted partial summary judgment in favor of QEP. After a bench trial\n\non the remaining claims, the district court found that QEP established it had\n\noverpaid Mr. Sullivan and was entitled to repayment under a theory of unjust\n\nenrichment. The court entered judgment awarding QEP $86,351.12 in damages,\n\nplus prejudgment and postjudgment interest and costs. It dismissed\n\nMr. Sullivan’s counterclaims with prejudice. He filed a timely appeal in which he\n\nchallenges the district court’s grant of partial summary judgment to QEP. He\n\ncontends that the court misconstrued the Thomas Assignment, requiring reversal\n\nof the final judgment in favor of QEP. 2\n\n\n\n\n2\n      Other than as they relate to construction of the Thomas Assignment,\nMr. Sullivan does not raise any claim of error with respect to the district court’s\nfindings of fact or conclusions of law following the bench trial.\n\n                                           -6-\n\f                                         II.\n\n      We review a district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo.\n\nTrans-Western Petroleum, Inc. v.

QEP and Mr. Sullivan concur that the referenced rider describes a\n\nproduction-payment interest entitling Mr. Thomas to receive payments capped at\n\n$300.00 per acre. They also agree that the production payment would be paid out\n\nover time from three percent of the production, as defined in the rider. Their\n\ndispute centers on whether “Three Percent (3%) of 8/8, see attached rider”\n\nreserved only the production-payment interest described in the rider, as QEP\n\n\n\n\n4\n       Utah courts will consider “extrinsic evidence offered to demonstrate that\nthere is in fact an ambiguity.” Trans-Western Petroleum, 584 F.3d at 993.\nNeither QEP nor Mr. Sullivan argues that extrinsic evidence establishes that the\nThomas Assignment is facially ambiguous.\n\n                                         -8-\n\fcontends; or two, separate interests, as Mr. Sullivan contends, namely a three\n\npercent overriding royalty and the undisputed production-payment interest.\n\n                                          2.\n\n      Despite Mr. Sullivan’s contentions otherwise, there is no dispute here\n\nregarding the similarities and differences between an overriding royalty and a\n\nproduction payment. 5 Both are nonoperating interests in an oil and gas lease,\n\n“that is, an interest which is entitled to receive some percentage of the production\n\nor income attributable to the lessee’s estate but is not obligated to bear any of the\n\ndevelopment (e.g., drilling) or operation (e.g., lifting) costs associated therewith.”\n\nFrank W.R. Hubert, Jr. & James A. Taylor, Oil & Gas § 14.01 (Rocky Mountain\n\nMineral Law Inst. 1985); see also Aplt. Opening Br. at 35 (acknowledging\n\noverriding royalties and production payments are “separate and distinct interests,\n\npaid from a non-operating share of lease production”). An overriding royalty is\n\nmost commonly understood as “an interest in oil and gas produced at the surface,\n\nfree of the expense of production, and carved from the working interest held\n\nunder an oil and gas lease.” Hubert & Taylor, § 14.02[1] (quotation omitted). An\n\noverriding royalty continues for the entire duration of a lease. Id.\n\n\n\n\n5\n      Mr. Sullivan asserts that, contrary to QEP’s contention, overriding royalties\nand production payments are not synonymous. But QEP did not advance that\nargument, nor did the district court adopt that position.\n\n                                         -9-\n\f      Similarly, a production payment (sometimes called an oil payment),\n\n“refer[s] to an interest created out of the lessee’s estate which is a share of the\n\nminerals produced from described premises, free of the costs of production at the\n\nsurface.” Id. But a production payment terminates when the lease expires, or\n\nsooner if the owner of the interest has received the agreed quantum of production\n\nor dollar amount from the sale of production.

In most\n\nother respects, however, an oil payment and an overriding royalty have\n\nsubstantially identical characteristics.”).\n\n                                              B.\n\n      Although the terms “overriding royalty” or “production payment” are not\n\nfound in the Thomas Assignment, QEP and Mr. Sullivan agree that other words\n\ncan be used to reserve these types of interests. Regarding the language at issue\n\n                                          -10-\n\fhere—“Three Percent (3%) of 8/8, see attached rider.”—QEP and Mr. Sullivan\n\nconcur that the term “8/8,” as used in the oil and gas industry, refers to 100\n\npercent of the production from a well. As QEP explains, the BLM’s standard\n\nlandowner royalty is 12½ percent, which is equal to 1/8 of the production. Thus,\n\nstating a reserved interest as a percentage of 8/8 confirms that payment will be\n\nmade from 100 percent of production, rather than from only 7/8 of the production\n\nnet of the BLM’s 1/8 royalty.\n\n      Mr. Sullivan argues that “3% of 8/8” is common industry terminology used\n\nto reserve an overriding royalty. He contends that, standing alone, “Three Percent\n\n(3%) of 8/8” specifies an overriding royalty to be paid out of three percent of 100\n\npercent of gross production from the wells. QEP does not challenge these\n\ncontentions. But as QEP points out, the language Mr. Sullivan emphasizes does\n\nnot stand alone in the Thomas Assignment. First, this language is followed by a\n\ncomma and the words “see attached rider.” Second, the language was inserted on\n\nthe BLM form in response to the question, “What overriding royalty or production\n\npayments is the assignor reserving herein?,” and the additional instruction,\n\n“specify percentage.” R., Vol. 3 at 95. 6\n\n\n6\n       QEP does contest Mr. Sullivan’s further assertion that “8/8” is used\nexclusively to define the extent of production from which an overriding royalty\nwill be paid out and never to define that same term with respect to a production\npayment. Whether a contractual term has a specialized meaning in the relevant\nindustry is a question of fact. See R&R Energies v. Mother Earth Indus., Inc.,\n                                                                      (continued...)\n\n                                            -11-\n\f                                         1.\n\n      The district court concluded that the words “see attached rider,” which\n\nwere separated from “Three Percent (3%) of 8/8” by a comma, related back to the\n\npreceding text, such that the rider provided a more-detailed description of the\n\nterms of the stated three percent interest. The court therefore rejected\n\nMr. Sullivan’s contention that the operative language reserved two interests.\n\nMr. Sullivan argues on appeal that the words before and after the comma form\n\ntwo separate, independent clauses, and he maintains that the district court’s\n\nholding ignores a long-standing rule of grammar used to identify independent\n\nclauses in a sentence. He contends that the first clause, “Three Percent (3%) of\n\n8/8,” stands alone to describe in clear industry terms the reservation of an\n\n\n6\n (...continued)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1224637\"><a href=\"/opinion/1224637/r-r-energies-v-mother-earth-indus/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1068</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1074 (Utah 1997).

Were we to consider his contention, however,\nwe note that at least one commentator has emphasized the importance of\nspecifying the fraction of production from which a production payment will be\nmade. See Williams & Meyers, § 422.4(d) (“[I]t is important to specify clearly\nwhether the payment is to be made from a fraction of 8/8ths of the production or a\nfraction of a fraction of production . . . .”).\n\n                                        -12-\n\foverriding royalty, while the second clause, “see attached rider,” stands alone to\n\nreference and incorporate the rider, which describes and creates an unrelated\n\nproduction-payment interest. But Mr. Sullivan’s construction requires the court\n\nto ignore, rather than apply, the grammar rule he cites. See William Strunk Jr. &\n\nE.B White, The Elements of Style 5 (50th ed. 2009) (instructing “[d]o not join\n\nindependent clauses with a comma” (emphasis omitted)); see also William A.\n\nSabin, The Gregg Reference Manual § 1088 (10th ed. 2005) (noting the error in\n\nseparating two independent clauses solely by a comma).\n\n                                         2.\n\n      QEP’s construction of the Thomas Assignment does not rest entirely on the\n\nparties’ use of a comma. QEP also notes that the operative language was added in\n\nresponse to a question on the standard BLM form: “What overriding royalty or\n\nproduction payments is the assignor reserving herein?” R., Vol. 3 at 95. 7 In\n\nresponding to this question, the form referred the parties to Item 4 of the General\n\nInstructions and further instructed them to “specify percentage.” Id. The form\n\nalso required the parties to disclose the percentage of overriding royalties or\n\nproduction payments, if any, that were previously reserved.\n\n\n\n\n7\n      Despite the BLM form’s use of the term “or,” neither Mr. Sullivan nor QEP\ncontends that the parties could only create an overriding royalty or production\npayments, but not both, in the Thomas Assignment.\n\n                                        -13-\n\f      QEP points to a then-current regulation to explain why the BLM form\n\nsought disclosure of the percentage of these types of interests, both new and\n\npreviously reserved. At the time the Thomas Assignment was executed, a\n\nregulation precluded agreements creating overriding royalties or production\n\npayments which aggregated in excess of 17½ percent, when added to the royalty\n\npayable to the United States and to previously reserved overriding royalties or\n\nproduction payments. See R., Vol. 3 at 83 (text of 43 C.F.R. § 3103.3-6 (1972)). 8\n\nThus, to the extent they aggregated more than five percent, overriding royalties or\n\nproduction payments would be considered “excess” when added to the United\n\nStates’ standard 12½ percent royalty. But such excess reservations did not violate\n\nthe terms of a lease if the agreement provided that the obligation to pay them\n\nwould be suspended when average production fell below a minimum amount. See\n\nid.\n\n\n8\n      The then-current regulation provided:\n\n            An agreement creating overriding royalties or payments out of\n      production of oil which, when added to overriding royalties or\n      payments out of production of oil previously created and to the\n      royalty payable to the United States, aggregate in excess of 17½\n      percent shall be deemed a violation of the terms of the lease unless\n      such agreement expressly provides that the obligation to pay such\n      excess overriding royalty or payments out of production of oil shall\n      be suspended when the average production of oil per well per day\n      averaged on the monthly basis is 15 barrels or less.\n\nR., Vol. 3 at 83 (text of 43 C.F.R. § 3103.3-6 (1972)). As indicated by the text,\nthis provision applied only to oil production. See id.\n\n                                        -14-\n\f      We assume that the parties to the Thomas Agreement contracted with\n\nknowledge of the existing regulatory scheme. See Wash.

Thus, consistent with\n\nthe then-current regulation, we construe the instruction to “specify percentage” in\n\nsection 5a of the BLM form as requiring the parties to specify the total percentage\n\nof the two stated types of interests being reserved in the assignment, whether they\n\nbe overriding royalties or payments out of production. See id. at 669\n\n(“[C]ontracts embrace laws which affect their validity, construction, discharge,\n\nand enforcement.”) 9\n\n                                         3.\n\n      Under Mr. Sullivan’s construction of the Thomas Assignment, Mr. Thomas\n\nreserved a three percent overriding royalty and a three percent production\n\npayment, for a total new reserved-interest percentage of six percent. Yet the\n\nparties specified only three percent in section 5a. Mr. Sullivan attempts to\n\nexplain this discrepancy by pointing to the language of Item 4 of the General\n\nInstructions, which directed the parties to “[d]escribe in an accompanying\n\nstatement, any overriding royalties or payments out of production created by\n\n\n9\n      QEP points to the lack of an express provision regarding the suspension of\nexcess royalties in the Thomas Assignment, as further evidence that the parties\ndid not reserve interests aggregating greater than five percent. Mr. Sullivan\nresponds that the Thomas Assignment does contain the required suspension\nprovision. We need not resolve that dispute in order to construe the operative\nlanguage in the Thomas Assignment.\n\n                                        -15-\n\fassignment but not set out therein.” R., Vol. 3 at 96 (emphasis added).

Therefore, he contends the General\n\nInstructions permitted the parties to “set out” the terms of a production-payment\n\ninterest entirely in a separate statement rather than on the assignment form\n\nitself—and that is what the parties to the Thomas Assignment did in this case.\n\n      We are not persuaded.

Thus, “[a] construction which entirely\n\nneutralizes one provision should not be adopted if the contract is susceptible of\n\nanother which gives effect to all of its provisions.” Id.\n\n      Mr. Sullivan’s construction of Item 4 of the General Instructions as\n\npermitting the parties to describe a production payment being reserved, including\n\nthe percentage of production from which it would be paid, solely in a separate\n\nstatement, contradicts section 5a. That section asked what overriding royalty or\n\nproduction payments were being reserved in the assignment and explicitly\n\ndirected the parties to specify the percentage. Because we must give effect to\n\nboth of these instructions in the BLM form, Mr. Sullivan’s interpretation is not\n\n                                         -16-\n\ftenable. Thus, we construe Item 4 of the General Instructions as directing the\n\nparties to set out in a separate statement any terms of an overriding royalty or\n\nproduction payment reserved in the assignment other than the percentage of the\n\ninterest that the parties were explicitly directed to specify in section 5a. The\n\nparties to the Thomas assignment did just that by stating “Three Percent (3%) of\n\n8/8,” in section 5a, followed by a reference to the rider, which described the\n\nadditional terms of the three percent production payment, as required by Item 4 of\n\nthe General Instructions. See R., Vol. 3 at 96 (directing parties reserving\n\npayments out of production to “outline in detail the amount, method of payment,\n\nand other pertinent terms”).\n\n                                         III.\n\n      Read as a whole, we find no ambiguity in the language of the Thomas\n\nAssignment with respect to the interest reserved by Mr. Thomas. The language\n\ndoes not reasonably support Mr. Sullivan’s interpretation that Mr. Thomas\n\nreserved both a three percent overriding royalty and the three percent production\n\npayment described in the rider. See Trans-Western Petroleum, 584 F.3d at 993\n\n(“[A] finding of ambiguity is justified only if the language of the contract\n\nreasonably supports the competing interpretations.”).
