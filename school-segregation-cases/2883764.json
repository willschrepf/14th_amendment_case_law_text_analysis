Shapiro, Senior Judge of the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation.\n\f        Christopher Colon appeals his drug conviction and sentence as a violation of the\n\nDouble Jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment. Colon also argues the District Court\n\nimproperly imposed a two-level enhancement under the Sentencing Guidelines for\n\ndistribution of a controlled substance in a prison. Finally, Colon claims the District Court\n\ndid not articulate its consideration of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). We have\n\njurisdiction to review the conviction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and the sentence under\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3742(a)(1).\n\n                      I.     Facts & Procedural History\n\n       Christopher Colon was serving a sentence of 360 months for conspiracy to possess\n\nheroin with intent to distribute at the Schuylkill Federal Correction Institution when he was\n\nfound collapsed and unresponsive . He was taken to a local hospital for emergency treatment\n\nwhere he vomited two balloons filled with heroin. During his stay, he admitted to having\n\nswallowed a total of four (4) balloons filled with heroin. Later he vomited the remaining two\n\nballoons, one still intact and one torn.\n\n       In the week that followed, Colon was interviewed by an FBI agent regarding the\n\nincident and admitted he agreed with other inmates to swallow balloons given to him during\n\na visitation as part of a plan to distribute the heroin to other inmates.\n\n       On January 26, 2004, Colon’s urine tested positive for heroin as a result of the\n\nruptured balloon. He received the following disciplinary sanction: disciplinary segregation\n\n(60 days); disallowance of good conduct time (54 days); loss of phone privileges (5 years);\n\nloss of visitation privileges (7 years); and disciplinary transfer.         On April 2, 2004,\n\n                                               2\n\fColon received the following consecutive sanction for introduction and possession of\n\nnarcotics: disciplinary segregation (60 days); disallowance of good conduct time (54 days);\n\nloss of phone privileges (5 years); loss of visitation privileges (5 years); and disciplinary\n\ntransfer (to the United States Penitentiary at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania).\n\n       On December 14, 2005, Colon plead guilty to possession of contraband by a federal\n\nprisoner in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1971(a)(2) and (b)(1). The plea agreement did not\n\ninclude a waiver of the right to appeal.\n\n       The presentence report recommended an initial offense level of 12 under U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2D1.1(c)(14) with the addition of two levels for distribution of controlled substances in a\n\nprison. Colon, objecting to the presentence report's recommendation, denied he intended to\n\ndistribute. The District Court found that Colon introduced the heroin into the prison\n\nknowingly and with intent to distribute and sentenced Colon to 27 months, consecutive to\n\nthe sentence he was serving.\n\n\n\n                            II.    Discussion\n\n\n                            A.     Double Jeopardy\n\n       Colon argues the prison sanctions were so punitive in purpose and effect they were\n\na form of criminal punishment, so the criminal sentence he later received violated his\n\nconstitutional right against multiple prosecution under the Double Jeopardy clause of the\n\nFifth Amendment. Because Colon failed to preserve this issue in the District Court, we\n\n\n                                             3\n\freview for plain error. United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 731 (1993).\n\n       The Double Jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment protects defendants from three\n\nforms of criminal punishment: 1) prosecution for the same offense after acquittal;\n\n2) prosecution for the same offense after conviction; and 3) multiple punishments for the\n\nsame offense. United States v. Ursery, 518 U.S. 267, 273 (1996). The issue in this case is\n\nwhether Colon was subjected to multiple punishments for the same offense.\n\n       “[A] prison disciplinary hearing is not a prosecution for Double Jeopardy purposes,”\n\nand sanctions imposed as a result of such hearings do not bar criminal prosecution. United\n\nStates v. Newby, 11 F.3d 1143, 1144 (3d Cir. 1993). In Newby, prisoners convicted of\n\ninterfering with a prison guard received both disciplinary sanctions and criminal punishment.\n\nThe sanction imposed by the prison officials (loss of 1,000 days of good time credit, transfer\n\nand segregation) was not grossly disproportionate to a remedial goal. Such sanctions are\n\ndesigned to discourage subordination in an environment where order is of paramount\n\nimportance. Id. at 1146.\n\n       Here, Colon's disciplinary sanctions totaled a loss of 108 days of good time credit,\n\n120 days of segregation, 10 years’ loss of phone privileges, 12 years’ loss of visitation\n\nprivileges, 5 years’ loss of commissary privileges, and transfer. These sanctions, while\n\nsevere, are not grossly disproportionate to a remedial goal. Colon was convicted of\n\npossession of drugs within a prison as part of a scheme to distribute. The inherent danger of\n\ndrugs is magnified when introduced to a controlled environment like a prison. Sanctions such\n\n\n                                              4\n\fas loss of phone and visitation privileges and disciplinary transfer assist in preventing the\n\noffender from conspiring and executing other schemes with inmates and people on the\n\noutside. Sanctions, such as loss of good time credit, are common forms of prison discipline\n\nand serve more generally to deter not only the specific offender from future misconduct but\n\nalso other inmates with similar intentions.\n\n       Considering the danger that smuggling drugs poses in prison as well as the limited\n\nalternatives available to prevent such occurrences, the sanctions Colon received were\n\nproportionate to a remedial goal. Because the disciplinary sanctions were not “punishment,”\n\nthere could not be the imposition of multiple punishments for the same offense. There was\n\nno violation of the Double Jeopardy clause.\n\n                             B.      Two-level Enhancement\n\n       The Federal Sentencing Guidelines require a two-level enhancement, “if the object\n\nof the offense was the distribution of a controlled substance in a prison, correctional facility,\n\nor detention facility...” U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(3). Colon argues he never intended to distribute\n\nthe drugs he smuggled into the Schuylkill Federal Correction Institution and never admitted\n\nsuch an intention. Colon further contends a sentence based on intent to distribute requires\n\na charge of such conduct.\n\n       We review the District Court’s legal interpretation of the Guidelines de novo but\n\napply the deferential standard of “clear error” to its factual determinations. United States v.\n\nZats, 298 F.3d 182, 185 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\n\n\n                                               5\n\f       The District Court found Colon intended to distribute contraband in a prison. The FBI\n\nagent who interviewed Colon following the incident testified at the sentencing hearing that\n\nColon admitted to participating in a scheme to smuggle four balloons of heroin into the\n\nprison for the purposes of distribution. Colon then testified to the contrary. After hearing\n\nboth witnesses, the District Court accepted the testimony of the FBI agent in determining that\n\nColon did in fact intend to distribute the heroin. Upon review of the record, we do not find\n\nthis determination was plain error.\n\n       The District Court considered evidence at sentencing of intent to distribute contraband\n\nalthough that was not an element of the charge of conviction. 18 U.S.C. § 3661 states, “No\n\nlimitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and\n\nconduct of a person convicted of an offense which a Court of the United States may receive\n\nand consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.” The Federal Sentencing\n\nGuidelines allow a court in imposing a sentence to consider “without limitation, any\n\ninformation concerning the background, character and conduct of the defendant, unless\n\notherwise prohibited by law.” See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 1B1.4 (2006).\n\n§ 1B1.3 of the Guidelines permits the District Court to consider all other related conduct\n\nwhen determining the range: “Conduct that is not formally charged or is not an element of\n\nthe offense of conviction may enter into the determination of the applicable guideline\n\nsentencing range.” Id.\n\n       There is no question that, even post- Booker, a sentencing court may consider relevant\n\nconduct the court finds has been proved by a preponderance of the evidence. United States\n\n                                              6\n\fv. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), United States v. Grier, 475 F.3d 556, 561 (3d Cir. 2006)\n\n(en banc). “[F]indings of fact relevant to the Guidelines need not be submitted to a jury.” Id.\n\nat 564.\n\n          Here, the District Court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Colon intended\n\nto distribute the drugs he smuggled into prison and granted a two-level enhancement pursuant\n\nto § 2D1.1(b)(3). Although intent is not an element of the charge of conviction both\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3661 and the Sentencing Guidelines allow such evidence to be considered at\n\nsentencing as relevant conduct, both in setting the custodial range and imposing the specific\n\nterm within that range. Because the District Court properly determined the applicable\n\nGuidelines, we reject Colon’s claim.\n\n                        C.      The 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) Sentencing Factors\n\n          Colon claims the District Court failed to articulate its consideration of the factors set\n\nforth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). He failed to preserve this issue in the District Court, so we\n\nreview only for plain error (that is, error that is plain and substantially affects the rights of\n\nthe defendant). United States v. Lloyd, 469 F.3d 319, 321 (3d Cir. 2006).\n\n          The requirement of adequate articulation is met when the record shows the trial court\n\ngave meaningful consideration to the § 3553(a) factors. United States v. Cooper, 437 F.3d\n\n324, 327-8 (3d Cir. 2006). “There are no magic words that a district judge must invoke when\n\nsentencing, but the record should demonstrate that the court considered the § 3553(a) factors\n\nand any sentencing grounds properly raised by the parties which have recognized legal merit\n\nand factual support in the record.” Id. at 332. Courts need only “state adequate reasons for\n\n                                                  7\n\fa sentence on the record so that this court can engage in meaningful appellate review.”\n\nUnited States v. King, 454 F.3d 187, 196-197 (3d Cir. 2006).\n\n       In this case, the District Court made the following statement on the record:\n\n              This sentence is within the guideline range, the range does not exceed\n       24 months and the Court finds that the sentence of 27 months imprisonment\n       would be reasonable in view of the considerations expressed in 18 United\n       States Code Section § 3553.\n              The Court has considered the nature of the offense, the seriousness of\n       possession of drugs in prison, and that such conduct should be deterred in the\n       future and the intent of this sentence is to deter such criminal conduct by this\n       Defendant and other inmates.\n\nApp. 93.\n\n       The District Court gave adequate insight on the exercise of its discretion and\n\narticulated the specific § 3553(a) factors considered. The statement is more than just a\n\nreiteration of the factors listed in § 3553(a). Rather, it addresses the specific subsections of\n\n§ 3553(a), i.e., “the nature and circumstances of the offense” [§ 3553(a)(1)], “the need for\n\nthe sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense” [§ 3553(a)(2)(A)], and “the\n\nneed for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct”\n\n[§3553(a)(2)(B)]. This specification of the factors leading to a sentence of 27 months\n\npermits meaningful appellate review.\n\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\f       Because the record shows the District Court did more than merely recite the factors\n\nfor consideration, we find the articulation of its reasoning not in plain error.\n\n                                        * * * * *\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we will AFFIRM Colon’s conviction and sentence.\n\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\f",

Later he vomited the remaining two\n\nballoons, one still intact and one torn.\n\n       In the week that followed, Colon was interviewed by an FBI agent regarding the\n\nincident and admitted he agreed with other inmates to swallow balloons given to him during\n\na visitation as part of a plan to distribute the heroin to other inmates.\n\n       On January 26, 2004, Colon’s urine tested positive for heroin as a result of the\n\nruptured balloon. He received the following disciplinary sanction: disciplinary segregation\n\n(60 days); disallowance of good conduct time (54 days); loss of phone privileges (5 years);\n\nloss of visitation privileges (7 years); and disciplinary transfer.         On April 2, 2004,\n\n                                               2\n\fColon received the following consecutive sanction for introduction and possession of\n\nnarcotics: disciplinary segregation (60 days); disallowance of good conduct time (54 days);\n\nloss of phone privileges (5 years); loss of visitation privileges (5 years); and disciplinary\n\ntransfer (to the United States Penitentiary at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania).\n\n       On December 14, 2005, Colon plead guilty to possession of contraband by a federal\n\nprisoner in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1971(a)(2) and (b)(1). The plea agreement did not\n\ninclude a waiver of the right to appeal.\n\n       The presentence report recommended an initial offense level of 12 under U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2D1.1(c)(14) with the addition of two levels for distribution of controlled substances in a\n\nprison. Colon, objecting to the presentence report's recommendation, denied he intended to\n\ndistribute. The District Court found that Colon introduced the heroin into the prison\n\nknowingly and with intent to distribute and sentenced Colon to 27 months, consecutive to\n\nthe sentence he was serving.\n\n\n\n                            II.    Discussion\n\n\n                            A.     Double Jeopardy\n\n       Colon argues the prison sanctions were so punitive in purpose and effect they were\n\na form of criminal punishment, so the criminal sentence he later received violated his\n\nconstitutional right against multiple prosecution under the Double Jeopardy clause of the\n\nFifth Amendment. Because Colon failed to preserve this issue in the District Court, we\n\n\n                                             3\n\freview for plain error. United States v. Olano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 731 (1993).\n\n       The Double Jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment protects defendants from three\n\nforms of criminal punishment: 1) prosecution for the same offense after acquittal;\n\n2) prosecution for the same offense after conviction; and 3) multiple punishments for the\n\nsame offense. United States v. Ursery, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118052\"><a href=\"/opinion/118052/united-states-v-ursery/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 273 (1996). The issue in this case is\n\nwhether Colon was subjected to multiple punishments for the same offense.\n\n       “[A] prison disciplinary hearing is not a prosecution for Double Jeopardy purposes,”\n\nand sanctions imposed as a result of such hearings do not bar criminal prosecution. United\n\nStates v. Newby, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658782\"><a href=\"/opinion/658782/united-states-v-gene-francis-newby-and-raynaldo-barber-gene-francis-newby/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1143</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1144 (3d Cir. 1993). In Newby, prisoners convicted of\n\ninterfering with a prison guard received both disciplinary sanctions and criminal punishment.\n\nThe sanction imposed by the prison officials (loss of 1,000 days of good time credit, transfer\n\nand segregation) was not grossly disproportionate to a remedial goal. Such sanctions are\n\ndesigned to discourage subordination in an environment where order is of paramount\n\nimportance. Id. at 1146.\n\n       Here, Colon's disciplinary sanctions totaled a loss of 108 days of good time credit,\n\n120 days of segregation, 10 years’ loss of phone privileges, 12 years’ loss of visitation\n\nprivileges, 5 years’ loss of commissary privileges, and transfer. These sanctions, while\n\nsevere, are not grossly disproportionate to a remedial goal. Colon was convicted of\n\npossession of drugs within a prison as part of a scheme to distribute. The inherent danger of\n\ndrugs is magnified when introduced to a controlled environment like a prison. Sanctions such\n\n\n                                              4\n\fas loss of phone and visitation privileges and disciplinary transfer assist in preventing the\n\noffender from conspiring and executing other schemes with inmates and people on the\n\noutside. Sanctions, such as loss of good time credit, are common forms of prison discipline\n\nand serve more generally to deter not only the specific offender from future misconduct but\n\nalso other inmates with similar intentions.\n\n       Considering the danger that smuggling drugs poses in prison as well as the limited\n\nalternatives available to prevent such occurrences, the sanctions Colon received were\n\nproportionate to a remedial goal. Because the disciplinary sanctions were not “punishment,”\n\nthere could not be the imposition of multiple punishments for the same offense. There was\n\nno violation of the Double Jeopardy clause.\n\n                             B.      Two-level Enhancement\n\n       The Federal Sentencing Guidelines require a two-level enhancement, “if the object\n\nof the offense was the distribution of a controlled substance in a prison, correctional facility,\n\nor detention facility...” U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(3). Colon argues he never intended to distribute\n\nthe drugs he smuggled into the Schuylkill Federal Correction Institution and never admitted\n\nsuch an intention. Colon further contends a sentence based on intent to distribute requires\n\na charge of such conduct.\n\n       We review the District Court’s legal interpretation of the Guidelines de novo but\n\napply the deferential standard of “clear error” to its factual determinations. United States v.\n\nZats, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 185 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\n\n\n                                               5\n\f       The District Court found Colon intended to distribute contraband in a prison. The FBI\n\nagent who interviewed Colon following the incident testified at the sentencing hearing that\n\nColon admitted to participating in a scheme to smuggle four balloons of heroin into the\n\nprison for the purposes of distribution. Colon then testified to the contrary. After hearing\n\nboth witnesses, the District Court accepted the testimony of the FBI agent in determining that\n\nColon did in fact intend to distribute the heroin. Upon review of the record, we do not find\n\nthis determination was plain error.\n\n       The District Court considered evidence at sentencing of intent to distribute contraband\n\nalthough that was not an element of the charge of conviction. 18 U.S.C. § 3661 states, “No\n\nlimitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and\n\nconduct of a person convicted of an offense which a Court of the United States may receive\n\nand consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.” The Federal Sentencing\n\nGuidelines allow a court in imposing a sentence to consider “without limitation, any\n\ninformation concerning the background, character and conduct of the defendant, unless\n\notherwise prohibited by law.” See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 1B1.4 (2006).\n\n§ 1B1.3 of the Guidelines permits the District Court to consider all other related conduct\n\nwhen determining the range: “Conduct that is not formally charged or is not an element of\n\nthe offense of conviction may enter into the determination of the applicable guideline\n\nsentencing range.” Id.\n\n       There is no question that, even post- Booker, a sentencing court may consider relevant\n\nconduct the court finds has been proved by a preponderance of the evidence. United States\n\n                                              6\n\fv. Booker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005), United States v.

Although intent is not an element of the charge of conviction both\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3661 and the Sentencing Guidelines allow such evidence to be considered at\n\nsentencing as relevant conduct, both in setting the custodial range and imposing the specific\n\nterm within that range. Because the District Court properly determined the applicable\n\nGuidelines, we reject Colon’s claim.\n\n                        C.      The 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) Sentencing Factors\n\n          Colon claims the District Court failed to articulate its consideration of the factors set\n\nforth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). He failed to preserve this issue in the District Court, so we\n\nreview only for plain error (that is, error that is plain and substantially affects the rights of\n\nthe defendant). United States v. Lloyd, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796031\"><a href=\"/opinion/796031/united-states-v-eric-lloyd-aka-calvin-larue-aka-butter-eric-floyd/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 321 (3d Cir. 2006).\n\n          The requirement of adequate articulation is met when the record shows the trial court\n\ngave meaningful consideration to the § 3553(a) factors. United States v. Cooper, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793258\"><a href=\"/opinion/793258/united-states-v-lydia-cooper/\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">324</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 327-8 (3d Cir. 2006). “There are no magic words that a district judge must invoke when\n\nsentencing, but the record should demonstrate that the court considered the § 3553(a) factors\n\nand any sentencing grounds properly raised by the parties which have recognized legal merit\n\nand factual support in the record.” Id. at 332. Courts need only “state adequate reasons for\n\n                                                  7\n\fa sentence on the record so that this court can engage in meaningful appellate review.”\n\nUnited States v. King, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794958\"><a href=\"/opinion/794958/united-states-v-donald-james-king/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 196-197 (3d Cir. 2006).\n\n       In this case, the District Court made the following statement on the record:\n\n              This sentence is within the guideline range, the range does not exceed\n       24 months and the Court finds that the sentence of 27 months imprisonment\n       would be reasonable in view of the considerations expressed in 18 United\n       States Code Section § 3553.\n              The Court has considered the nature of the offense, the seriousness of\n       possession of drugs in prison, and that such conduct should be deterred in the\n       future and the intent of this sentence is to deter such criminal conduct by this\n       Defendant and other inmates.\n\nApp. 93.\n\n       The District Court gave adequate insight on the exercise of its discretion and\n\narticulated the specific § 3553(a) factors considered. The statement is more than just a\n\nreiteration of the factors listed in § 3553(a). Rather, it addresses the specific subsections of\n\n§ 3553(a), i.e., “the nature and circumstances of the offense” [§ 3553(a)(1)], “the need for\n\nthe sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense” [§ 3553(a)(2)(A)], and “the\n\nneed for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct”\n\n[§3553(a)(2)(B)]. This specification of the factors leading to a sentence of 27 months\n\npermits meaningful appellate review.\n\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\f       Because the record shows the District Court did more than merely recite the factors\n\nfor consideration, we find the articulation of its reasoning not in plain error.\n\n                                        * * * * *\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we will AFFIRM Colon’s conviction and sentence.\n\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\f</pre>",
