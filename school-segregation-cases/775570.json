These 17 separate appeals raise a host of divergent issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* THE BACKGROUND</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States initiated this action on May 31, 1968, pursuant to section 407(a) and (b) of Title IV, of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000c-6(a) and (b)).  The complaint charged the Board of School Commissioners for the City of Indianapolis with racial discrimination in the assignment of faculty and students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The faculty portion of the charge was resolved first.  On August 5, 1968, the district court concluded (pursuant to stipulation by the parties that racial factors had been considered in the assignment of teachers and staff members) that racial composition of faculty and staff deprived students of equal protection in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The court entered a consent decree ordering remedial injunctive relief commencing with the school year of 1968-69.  Faculty and staff desegregation is one 'important aspect of the basic task of achieving a public school system wholly free from racial discrimination.'  United States v. Montgomery County Board of Education, 395 U.S. 225, 232, 89 S.Ct. 1670, 1674, 23 L.Ed.2d 263 (1969).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Public school teachers in Indianapolis then brought a class action in an Indiana state court and obtained a temporary restraining order to prevent transfers of teachers and staff without the consent of the teachers involved.  Defendant school board and its members removed the case to the federal district court, which promptly dissolved the restraining order.  Burns v. Board of School Commissioners, 302 F.Supp. 309 (S.D.Ind.1969), aff'd, 437 F.2d 1143 (7th Cir. 1971).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The student portion of the 1968 case was tried before the court on July 12-21, 1971.  In accordance with Brown v. Board of Education (Brown I), 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954), the court found that the Indianapolis school board was deliberately operating a de jure dual school system on May 17, 1954 (the date of Brown I), and had not changed its policies in order to eliminate de jure segregation on or before May 31, 1968 (the date of the government's complaint). Pursuant to Brown v. Board of Education (Brown II), 349 U.S. 294, 75 S.Ct. 753, 99 L.Ed. 1083 (1955), the court on August 18, 1971 ordered interim relief, retained jurisdiction to order further relief and directed the school board to file plans of affirmative action for the school year 1971-72 as required by Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 437-438, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968).  ('School board(s) . . . (were) . . . clearly charged with the affirmative duty to take whatever steps might be necessary to convert to a unitary system in which racial discrimination (would) be eliminated root and branch.')  United States v. Board of School Commissioners (Indianapolis I), 332 F.Supp. 655 (S.D.Ind. 1971), aff'd, 474 F.2d 81 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 413 U.S. 920, 93 S.Ct. 3066, 37 L.Ed.2d 1041 (1973).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Indianapolis I, the court concluded that the common law of Indiana was that the boundaries of a school district and of a civil city were coterminous, a rule finally recognized by statute in 1931.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Statutes passed in 1961<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and in 1969<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> provided that, if Indianapolis' boundaries were extended, those of its school district could likewise be expanded.  Such expansion, however, would be subject to a separate remonstrance or veto by a specified percentage of persons affected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1969, after this suit had been commenced, the civil governments of the City of Indianapolis and of Marion County were consolidated into a unified, metropolitan city government by the socalled Uni-Gov Act, which expressly provides that the Indianapolis school district would not be affected by the expansion of the city.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  In other words, the school district (or School City) of Indianapolis was confined to an area in the central part of the new Uni-Gov, where it is surrounded by eight township school systems and by two additional city school corporations (Beech Grove and Speedway City), all operating independently within the new unified City of Indianapolis and within Marion County.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that 'the easy way out . . . would be to order a massive 'fruit basket' scrambling of students within the School City,' but 'it won't work.'  Resegregation would rapidly occur because of a white exodus from what would be substantially black schools.  The resegregation problem 'would pale into insignificance if the (school) Board's jurisdiction were coterminous with that of Uni-Gov' and 'would be minimized still further if extended to . . . Beech Grove and Speedway City, and to certain parts of the adjoining counties practically indistinguishable from the City of Indianapolis . . ..'  The court ordered the United States as plaintiff to join as additional parties defendant the municipal corporations and school corporations which would have an interest in the court's intended consideration of the entire metropolitan area.  332 F.Supp. at 678-680.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 7, 1971, the United States moved to add as parties defendant all school corporations in Marion County (eight townships and two city corporations).  A few days later, the court permitted the Buckley plaintiffs (Donny Brurell Buckley and Aylcia Marquese Buckley by their parents and next friend, Ruby L. Buckley) to intervene in their own right and as representatives of a class consisting of 'all Negro school age children residing in the area served by' the Indianapolis school board.  The intervening plaintiffs, in turn, joined as additional parties defendant the Governor and Attorney General of Indiana, the state Superintendent of Public Instruction, the state Board of Education and 19 school corporations (including the ten within Marion County which had been joined by the United states, plus nine in the adjoining counties of Boone, Hamilton, Hancock, Johnson, Morgan and Hendricks).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Citizens of Indianapolis for Quality Schools, Inc., a not-for-profit corporation, was permitted to intervene as a defendant.  See United States v. Board of School Commissioners, 466 F.2d 573 (7th Cir. 1972), cert. denied. 410 U.S. 909, 93 S.Ct. 964, 35 L.Ed.2d 271 (1973).  Coalition for Integrated Education, an unincorporated association favoring a metropolitan plan of desegregation, was granted leave to file briefs as amicus curiae in both the district court and in this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The intervening plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in intervention in two counts.  The first count alleged that the Indiana statutes effecting a governmental reorganization in Indianapolis were unconstitutional as racially discriminatory because schools were excluded from the consolidated metropolitan government, and prayed for an order consolidating the defendant school systems.  The second count alleged and sought relief from racial discrimination by the state and by local school authorities in the operation of the public schools of Indianapolis and the surrounding school corporations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The additional defendants filed various motions attacking their joinder, the complaint in intervention and the court's jurisdiction on a variety of grounds.  All these motions were overruled by the district court.  Several of the added defendants subsequently applied unsuccessfully to this court for writs of prohibition or mandamus to vacate the joinder and intervention orders;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> to compel the convening of a three-judge district court;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and to compel the recusation of the district judge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 28, 1972, the court for the first time ordered the development and submission of comprehensive plans for the desegregation of the Indianapolis district.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  In response, the Indianapolis board on February 8, 1973 submitted a plan, denominated the 'Stabilization Plan.'  The 'Stabilization Plan' was subsequently rejected by the court on June 11, 1973.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remedy phase (Indianapolis II) was tried before the court from June 12 to July 6 and on July 18, 1973.  On July 20, 1973, the court entered its decision, concluding that (1) desegregation promising a reasonable degree of permanence could not be accomplished within the present boundaries of the Indianapolis school district; (2) the State of Indiana, its officials and agencies, had by various acts and omissions promoted segregation and inhibited desegregation within the Indianapolis district, so that the state, as the agency ultimately charged under Indiana law with the operation of the public schools, has a continuing affirmative duty to desegregate the Indianapolis system; (3) the system could be effectively desegregated either by combining its territory with all or part of the territory served by the 19 surrounding school corporations in and adjacent to Marion County into a metropolitan system and then reassigning students within the expanded system or by transferring black students from the Indianapolis district to the 19 others, either on a one-way or exchange basis; and (4) the state, through its General Assembly, should first be afforded the opportunity to select its own plan; but if it failed to do so, the court would promulgate a plan.  The court ordered interim relief in the form of student assignments for the 1973-74 school year sufficient to bring the number of black students in each Indianapolis elementary school up to approximately 15 percent, which was accomplished.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  United States v.

On December 6, 1973, the court issued a supplemental memorandum of decision, consisting principally of suggestions and recommendations for the General Assembly to implement Indianapolis II with an affirmative plan.  United States v. Board of School Commissioners (Indianapolis III), III), 368 F.Supp. 1223 (S.D.Ind. 1973).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The General Assembly held its scheduled session.  The only ligislation it passed relating to this case was Senate Enrolled Act No. 119, which was signed into law by the Governor of Indiana on February 20, 1974.  The statute provides for the adjustment of tuition among transferor and transferee schools and for the reimbursement of transportation costs by the state and is rigidly limited in its application:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This chapter applies solely in a situation where a court of the United States or of the State of Indiana in a suit to which the transferor or transferee corporation or corporations are parties has found the following: (a) a transferor corporation has violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States by practicing de jure racial segregation of the students within its borders; (b) a unitary school system within the meaning of such Amendment cannot be implemented within the boundaries of the transferor corporation; and (c) the Fourteenth Amendment compels the Court to order a transferor corporation to transfer its students for education to one or more transferee corporations to effect a plan of desegregation in the transferor corporation which is acceptable within the meaning of such Amendment.  This chapter shall not apply until all appeals from such order, whether taken by the transferor corporation, any transferee corporation or any party to the action, have been exhausted or the time for taking such appeals has expired, except where all stays of a transfer order pending appeal or further court action have been denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">INTERIM RELIEF WITHIN THE INDIANAPOLIS PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Indianapolis II, the district court directed the Indianapolis public school system (which the court referred to as IPS) to rearrange the enrollment patterns in its elementary schools, effective with the 1973-74 school year, so that each school would have a minimum black enrollment 'in the area of 15%.'  IPS was directed to pair or cluster schools in close proximity and to realign school assignment zones in order to expand the neighborhood or community school concept and to reduce the necessity for busing.  If, after utilizing these procedures, certain schools did not meet the required percentages of black enrollment, pairing or clustering of schools in noncontiguous zones would be required.  368 F.Supp. at 1209.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The unanimous Court in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 27, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1282, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971), discussed these precise remedies and concluded that, even if paired or grouped zones for transferring blacks out of and whites into formerly segregated black schools were 'on opposite ends of the city,' nevertheless 'as an interim corrective measure, this cannot be said to be beyond the broad remedial powers of a court.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to Indianapolis II, IPS submitted a plan which proposed to close four predominantly black schools and to distribute the displaced students to white schools with excess unused capacity.  After an evidentiary hearing on August 20, 1973 on the IPS plan, the district court found on August 27 that it (1) did not readjust the percentage of minority students in the elementary schools to approximately 15 percent; (2) did not provide for reducing the percentage of minority students at Shortridge High School nor for increasing the percentage of minority students at Thomas Carr Howe High School, as previously ordered; and (3) did not provide for the use of any of the attendance zone, pairing or clustering devices required by the court.  The court, concluding that 'the Board is unable or unwilling to comply with the orders of this court,' appointed a two-man commission to develop desegregation plans, temporarily assigned the IPS planning staff to assist the commissioners, and required that application be made for available federal funds to assist in desegregation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board of School Commissioners of IPS in the present appeal attacks the district court's order insofar as it (1) held the board in default; (2) appointed the two-man commission to prepare plans of desegregation; (3) assigned the professional planning staff of IPS to the temporary service of the commission; and (4) ordered IPS to apply for all available federal funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IPS alleges that the commission's plan for interim relief, which reassigned some 9,200 students as opposed to the IPS plan reassigning approximately 4,500 students, 'in large part was copied from the earlier (IPS) plan.'

'The burden on a school board today is to come forward with a plan that promises realistically to work, and promises realistically to work now.'  Green v. County School Board, supra at 439, 88 S.Ct. at 1695.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with a totally unacceptable plan a few days before the beginning of the 1973-74 school term, the court turned to two independent commissioners to perform a herculean task within a miniscule period of time.  The court said 'in sorrow and with regret' that 'never, since this thing started on the complaint of the United States in 1968 . . . has any (IPS) Board . . . gone very far to do anything, really, unless they were pushed and ordered' and then 'when they are ordered, they usually . . . come up with an alternative idea that doesn't go quite as far as the order, or you want a stay or something-- anything to put it off.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In appointing the two commissioners to formulate a plan, the district court followed the procedure approved in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, supra at 16, 25, 91 S.Ct. at 1276, 1280:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In default by the school authorities of their obligation to proffer acceptable remedies a district court has broad power to fashion a remedy that will assure a unitary school system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was because of this total failure of the school board that the District Court was obliged to turn to other qualified sources, and Dr. Finger (a court-appointed expert) was designated to assist the District Court to do what the board should have done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The commission adhered to the district court's guidelines as approved in Swann by altering attendance zones, by contiguous and non-contiguous pairing and clustering, by 'ungerrymandering' and by creating larger 'neighborhood schools.'  The commission presented its recommended plan, entitled 'The Quest for Human Dignity' within ten days of its appointment.  This could not have been accomplished without the temporary use of the IPS planning staff.  If in fact the commission made use of planning staff material, it obviously made much more effective use of that material than IPS had done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the district court acted properly in rejecting the IPS plan, in holding the IPS board in default, in appointing the commission and in temporarily assigning the planning staff of IPS to the commission.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, in regard to the IPS board's attacks on the district court's orders, we hold that the court did not abuse its discretion in ordering IPS to seek available federal funds to expedite desegregation.  This method of implementation of a decree intended to eliminate a dual school system has been approved by several courts.  United States v. Texas, 342 F.Supp. 24, 29 (E.D.Tex.1971), aff'd, 466 F.2d 518 (5th Cir. 1972); Whittenberg v. Greenville County School Dist., 298 F.Supp. 784, 790 (D.S.C.1969) (three-judge panel).  In Plaquemines Parish School Board v. United States, 415 F.2d 817, 833 (5th Cir. 1969), the court of appeals found a 'broadly written' order requiring application for federal aid unjustified, but added:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This direction is without prejudice to the right of the district court in the future in a specific situation as to specific funds to require that application be made when it is shown that the board has failed to apply for such funds as part of a plan or scheme to impede the end of the dual system of schools, or to discriminate against Negro children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the last analysis, we must look to Swann, where the Supreme Court said (402 U.S. at 28, 91 S.Ct. at 1282):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remedy for such (de jure) segregation may be administratively awkward, inconvenient, and even bizarre in some situations and may impose burdens on some; but all awkwardness and inconvenience cannot be avoided in the interim period when remedial adjustments are being made to eliminate the dual school systems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that in this case the district court properly requested the defendants to seek federal funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RACIAL BALANCE WITHIN THE METROPOLITAN INDIANAPOLIS AREA</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even the Board of School Commissioners of IPS concedes that 'it appears clear from the cases heretofore decided by the Supreme Court of the United States that the . . . obligation imposed by the Constitution of the United States upon IPS is the duty to dismantle the dual school system which was found to exist within its present boundaries.'

The court's theory was restated in Indianapolis II (368 F.Supp. at 1197):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court in its original opinion expressed some doubts as to whether or not a stable desegregation plan could be established within the confines of IPS, based upon the evidence adduced at that trial, which was all to the effect that when the percentage of Negro pupils in a given school approaches 40%, more or less, the exodus of white pupils from such a school becomes accelerated and irreversible, resulting in resegregation.  However, additional evidence on this issue was adduced at the recent trial, and the Court bases its findings exclusively upon such latter evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having considered such evidence, the Court finds it to be a fact that when the percentage of Negro pupils in a given school approaches 25% To 30%, more or less, in the area served by IPS, the white exodus from such a school district becomes accelerated and continues . . ..  All witnesses agreed that once a school becomes identifiably black, it never reverses to white, in the absence of redistricting.  Therefore, progressions from white to black are irreversible once the critical percentage has been reached in the absence of intervention through redistricting.  Below the critical percentage, however, schools tend to remain stable . . ..</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then concluded that the most effective method of realistically accomplishing desegregation of IPS would be either by combining IPS territory with that of all or part of the territory served by the ten Marion County (Uni-Gov) school districts and possibly also with that of some or all of the nine school districts in counties adjacent to Marion County, and then reassigning students within the metropolitan area thus created, or by transferring black students from IPS to the other districts, either on a one-way or an exchange basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having found IPS guilty of de jure segregation, the court then proceeded to consider upon evidentiary hearing the situation in the remaining school districts.  He concluded (368 F.Supp. at 1203):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no evidence that any of the added defendant school corporations have committed acts of de jure segregation directed against Negro students living within their respective borders.  In fact, the evidence shows that, with a few exceptions, none of the added defendants have had the opportunity to commit such overt acts because the Negro population residing within the borders of such defendants ranges from slight to none . . ..</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 41 L.Ed.2d 1069 (July 25, 1974), where the lower courts had found a de jure segregated public school system in operation in Detroit (Bradley v. Milliken, 338 F.Supp. 582, 594 (E.D.Mich.1971), aff'd, 484 F.2d 215, 258 (6th Cir. 1973)), but with 'no showing of significant violation by the 53 outlying school districts and no evidence of any inter-district violation or effect,' the majority of the Supreme Court said 418 U.S. at 745, 94 S.Ct. at 3127-3128:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To approve the remedy ordered by the court would impose on the outlying districts, not shown to have committed any constitutional violation, a wholly impermissible remedy . . ..  Disparate treatment of White and Negro students occurred within the Detroit school system, and not elsewhere, and on the record the remedy must be limited to that system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court further concluded that, even if state agencies participated in the maintenance of the Detroit system, as the lower courts had held, it did not follow that an interdistrict remedy would be constitutionally justified or required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case based upon the district court's comprehensive and detailed recital of the history of Indiana law and procedure pertaining to Indiana schools, appearing in 332 F.Supp. at 658-677 and in 368 F.Supp. at 1199-1205, we conclude, as the district court did, that the state officials have, by various acts and omissions, promoted segregation and inhibited desegregation within IPS, so that the state, as the agency ultimately charged under Indiana law with the operation of the public schools, has an affirmative duty to assist the IPS Board in desegregating IPS within its boundaries (see Part IV hereof).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, the district court's findings, rulings, orders and discussion relating to a metropolitan remedy beyond the Uni-Gov boundaries are reversed.

'It cannot . . . be accepted as a reason for achieving anything less than complete uprooting of the dual school system.'  United States v. Scotland Neck City Board of Education, 407 U.S. 484, 491, 92 S.Ct. 2214, 2218, 33 L.Ed.2d 75 (1970).  See also Monroe v.

We must guard against permitting the 'white flight' considerations unduly to delay complete desegregation within IPS now that Milliken v. Bradley has disposed of the metropolitan remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequent to oral argument in these appeals, the record has been supplemented to include an order entered by the district court on July 3, 1974, whereby IPS has been directed to continue for the 1974-75 school year the interim plan in effect for the 1973-74 school year, except that feeder assignments to Thomas Carr Howe High School are to be arranged 'to insure that the freshman class at such school for the coming school year will include a minority race enrollment of not less than 15%.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Obviously many steps have been taken to dismantle the IPS dual school system within its boundaries, but more steps must be taken.  The Supreme Court's mandate to us to develop a plan of desegregation that 'promises realistically to work now' (Green v.

Ex parte Young teaches that when a state officer acts under a state law in a manner violative of the Federal Constitution, he 'comes into conflict with the superior authority of that Constitution and he is in that case stripped of his official or representative character and is subjected in his person to the consequences of his individual conduct.

The outside school boards appealed the court's exclusion of the testimony of two expert sociological witnesses. Dr. David J. Armor would have testified that 'mandatory busing programs could result in adverse sociological and psychological effects on the children involved . . ., that prejudice, racial identity, solidarity and desire for separatism was usually enhanced rather than diminished, and that over the short run busing for purposes of integration did not lead to significant gains in student achievement or interracial harmony.'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> Dr. Ernest van den Haag would have testified: '(a) Contact between the races does not reduce prejudice; and (b) Integration (as distinguished from desegregation) may heighten racial identity and reduces the opportunity for actual contact between the races.'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Brown I, Brown v.

Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 16 S.Ct. 1138, 41 L.Ed. 256 (1896), deprived minority children of equal educational opportunities, with a footnote citing some sociological and psychological authority to that effect.  347 U.S. at 494 n. 11, 74 S.Ct. 686.  This reliance on supportive sociological material by the Supreme Court has led to a number of abortive attempts to overrule Brown and reinstate Plessy through reliance on sociological and psychological material which purports to show that minority children thrive when segregated.

The majority opinion of a three-judge panel remanded the case to the district court for further consideration, particularly of recent sociological findings, in evaluating the impact of induced busing upon educational achievement and race relations.  Cause No. 71-2006 (6th Cir., Oct. 11, 1972).

Recognizing this to be the holding of Swann, defendants nevertheless suggest that we come to a contrary conclusion on the basis of a single piece of much criticized sociological research, the conclusions of which are, by its own terms, inapplicable to the Southern school pattern.  It would be presumptuous in the extreme for us to refuse to follow a Supreme Court decision on the basis of such meager evidence.  Swann is controlling and requires us to sanction the use of bus transportation as a tool of desegregation when, as here, such busing is necessary to accomplish the dismantling of the dual system and its use does not pose intolerable practical problems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 'much criticized sociological research' is Armor's article cited supra in footnote 17<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> and criticized in Judge Edwards' dissent in the original Mapp decision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Stell v. Savannah-Chatham County Board of Education, 220 F.Supp. 667, 673 (S.D.Ga.1963), the district court as early as 1963 relied upon a great volume of sociological and psychological material, including the testimony of Dr. van den Haag, in refusing to dismantle a dual school system.  The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit promptly entered an injunction requiring desegregation pending appeal on the merits at 318 F.2d 425 (5th Cir. 1963) and reversed the district court at 333 F.2d 55 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 933, 85 S.Ct. 332, 13 L.Ed.2d 344 (1964).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If this sort of sociological and psychological material were fully valid and if Brown I vitally depended upon it, even then only the Supreme Court itself could overruld Brown.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But, as we have seen, the validity of the material is in grave doubt and Brown is not dependent upon it.  As Judge Sobeloff so aptly put it in Brunson v. Board of Trustees, 429 F.2d 820, 824, 826 (4th Cir. 1970) (Judge Sobeloff concurring and responding to a dissent which relied in part upon the sociological theories of Dr. Thomas F.

The inventors and proponents of this theory grossly misapprehend the philosophical basis for desegregation.  It is not founded upon the concept that white children are a precious resource which should be fairly apportioned.  It is not, as Pettigrew suggests, because black children will be improved by association with their betters.  Certainly it is hoped that under integregation members of each race will benefit from unfettered contact with their peers.  But school segregation is forbidden simply because its perpetuation is a living insult to the black children and immeasurably taints the education they receive.  This is the precise lesson of Brown.

IPS was directed to pair or cluster schools in close proximity and to realign school assignment zones in order to expand the neighborhood or community school concept and to reduce the necessity for busing.

'The burden on a school board today is to come forward with a plan that promises realistically to work, and promises realistically to work now.'  Green v. County School Board, supra at 439, 88 S.Ct. at 1695.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with a totally unacceptable plan a few days before the beginning of the 1973-74 school term, the court turned to two independent commissioners to perform a herculean task within a miniscule period of time.  The court said 'in sorrow and with regret' that 'never, since this thing started on the complaint of the United States in 1968 . . . has any (IPS) Board . . . gone very far to do anything, really, unless they were pushed and ordered' and then 'when they are ordered, they usually . . . come up with an alternative idea that doesn't go quite as far as the order, or you want a stay or something-- anything to put it off.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In appointing the two commissioners to formulate a plan, the district court followed the procedure approved in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, supra at 16, 25, 91 S.Ct. at 1276, 1280:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In default by the school authorities of their obligation to proffer acceptable remedies a district court has broad power to fashion a remedy that will assure a unitary school system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was because of this total failure of the school board that the District Court was obliged to turn to other qualified sources, and Dr. Finger (a court-appointed expert) was designated to assist the District Court to do what the board should have done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The commission adhered to the district court's guidelines as approved in Swann by altering attendance zones, by contiguous and non-contiguous pairing and clustering, by 'ungerrymandering' and by creating larger 'neighborhood schools.'  The commission presented its recommended plan, entitled 'The Quest for Human Dignity' within ten days of its appointment.  This could not have been accomplished without the temporary use of the IPS planning staff.  If in fact the commission made use of planning staff material, it obviously made much more effective use of that material than IPS had done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the district court acted properly in rejecting the IPS plan, in holding the IPS board in default, in appointing the commission and in temporarily assigning the planning staff of IPS to the commission.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, in regard to the IPS board's attacks on the district court's orders, we hold that the court did not abuse its discretion in ordering IPS to seek available federal funds to expedite desegregation.

However, additional evidence on this issue was adduced at the recent trial, and the Court bases its findings exclusively upon such latter evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having considered such evidence, the Court finds it to be a fact that when the percentage of Negro pupils in a given school approaches 25% To 30%, more or less, in the area served by IPS, the white exodus from such a school district becomes accelerated and continues . . ..  All witnesses agreed that once a school becomes identifiably black, it never reverses to white, in the absence of redistricting.  Therefore, progressions from white to black are irreversible once the critical percentage has been reached in the absence of intervention through redistricting.

It is not founded upon the concept that white children are a precious resource which should be fairly apportioned.  It is not, as Pettigrew suggests, because black children will be improved by association with their betters.  Certainly it is hoped that under integregation members of each race will benefit from unfettered contact with their peers.  But school segregation is forbidden simply because its perpetuation is a living insult to the black children and immeasurably taints the education they receive.  This is the precise lesson of Brown.
