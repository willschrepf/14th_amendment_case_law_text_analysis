We grant habeas corpus relief\r\nin part and deny it in part. <span>BACKGROUND</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>By a 2003 agreed final decree, the trial court dissolved the marriage of Ron and \r\nreal party in interest, Sheri Dooley (“Sheri”).  The trial court appointed Ron and Sheri\r\njoint managing conservators of their four-year-old son (“the child”) and established\r\norders providing regulation of the parties’ relation with the child in areas of support,\r\naccess, and parental rights and duties.  Over the next several years, discord arose\r\nbetween the parties, generally related to the child’s medical care, and specifically\r\nrelated to whether he had attention deficit disorder (“ADD”), attention deficit\r\nhyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”), or some other condition requiring medication.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>On April 5, 2005, after having found that the parties had an agreement about\r\nthe modification of the decree, the trial court signed an order in a suit to modify\r\nparent-child relationship.  It altered Ron and Sheri’s rights on medical decisions to\r\ninclude an arbitrator for disagreements between them; provided that the parents\r\ncommunicate by email; modified the parties’ periods, terms, and conditions of\r\npossession; and established a permanent injunction intended to regulate their\r\ncommunications and their administration of prescription medication to the child. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>On April 19, 2006, the trial court signed another order in a suit for modification\r\nof support and to confirm support arrearage.  The trial court found that the parties had\r\nagreed to the entry of orders that modified Ron’s monthly child and medical support\r\nobligations and ordered him to pay child and medical support judgments by June 1,\r\n2006.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Finally, on July 21, 2006, the trial court signed a third modification order,\r\n“Agreed Final Order Modifying Prior Order in Suit Affecting Parent-Child\r\nRelationship.”  It established a plan for the evaluation and subsequent treatment of\r\nthe child for ADD/ADHD, other medical conditions, and dental work.  It enjoined the\r\nparties from unnecessarily removing the child from school; enjoined Ron, for 40\r\nmonths, from filing for additional modifications; and addressed alleged child support\r\narrearages.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>On September 26, 2008, Sheri sought enforcement of the prior orders, asserting\r\nthat on over 140 occasions, Ron had violated all three prior modification orders.  The\r\ntrial court heard the petition, and on December 17, 2008, in its enforcement order,\r\nfound Ron in contempt of its prior orders in 110 instances.  For each instance of\r\ncontempt, as punishment, the trial court assessed Ron a punishment of six months\r\nconfinement and a $500 fine, the punitive sentences to run concurrently.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Having found that “the child has been destroyed particularly by his father,” as\r\nadditional relief, the trial court gave Sheri exclusive right to consent to invasive\r\nmedical and dental procedures for the child, as well as all psychological and\r\npsychiatric treatment for the child until he turned 18.  It ordered that Ron’s periods\r\nof possession and all access to the child be supervised at all times and that his\r\novernight periods of possession be eliminated.  Additionally, the trial court awarded\r\nSheri a child support arrearage judgment of $1,264.79 and an $18,923 judgment for\r\nattorney’s fees, expenses, and costs, plus interest.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>The trial court ordered Ron’s confinement to be probated for a period of nine\r\nyears, with Ron placed on community supervision, provided that he abide by various\r\nterms and conditions, including those on an attached, three-page “Exhibit ‘A’ Terms\r\nand Conditions of Community Supervision.”  Subsequently, Ron petitioned this Court\r\nfor habeas corpus relief, attacking all but four of the trial court’s contempt findings\r\nand various of its other provisions (including numerous of its probation/conditions\r\nof community supervision provisions).</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>ANALYSIS</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Availability of Habeas Corpus Review</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Ron is not physically confined in jail because the trial court has suspended his\r\ncommitment and placed him on community supervision.  Under the terms and\r\nconditions of the suspension of commitment and community supervision, however,\r\nRon must, among other things, report to a community supervision officer (CSO), as\r\nspecified by the CSO; permit the CSO to visit Ron at Ron’s home or elsewhere, as\r\ndeemed appropriate by the CSO; participate in employment assistance, as directed by\r\nthe CSO; complete referrals or counseling on a variety of topics, as ordered by the\r\ntrial court or directed by the CSO; no longer have overnight periods of possession\r\nwith the child; and, if he exercises periods of possession and access to the child, do\r\nso under the supervision of a third party.  The parties dispute whether, under the\r\nDecember 17, 2008 enforcement order, the trial court has illegally restrained Ron so\r\nas to entitle him to habeas corpus review.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>To qualify for habeas corpus relief from a court of appeals, a person must be\r\n“restrained in his liberty . . . when it appears that the restraint of liberty is by virtue\r\nof an order, process, or commitment issued by a court or judge because of the\r\nviolation of an order, judgment, or decree previously made, rendered or entered by\r\nthe court or judge in a civil case.<span>  Tex. Gov’t Code Ann.</span> § 22.221 (Vernon 2004). \r\nThus, it must be shown that the contemnor has undergone a restraint of liberty.  <i>Ex\r\nparte Crawford</i>, 506 S.W.2d 920, 921 (Tex. Civ. App.—Tyler 1974, orig.\r\nproceeding).</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Ron cites <i>Ex parte Williams</i>, 690 S.W.2d 243 (Tex. 1985), for the proposition\r\nthat “‘any character of restraint which precludes absolute and perfect freedom of\r\naction will justify the issuance of the writ.’”  <i>Id</i>. at 244 (quoting <i>Ex parte Calhoun</i>,\r\n91 S.W.2d 1047, 1048 (Tex. 1936)).  The trial court had found Williams in contempt,\r\nordered him to jail, but released him on condition that he post a bond and prosecute\r\nan “appeal.”  <i>Id</i>. at 243.  Addressing the issue of restraint, the supreme court stated,\r\n“There are restraints on Williams’ liberty.  His incarceration is not a speculative\r\npossibility where the unfolding of events may render the controversy moot; his bond\r\ncould be revoked at any time, resulting in his incarceration.”  <i>Id</i>. at 244.  Sheri\r\nattempts to distinguish <i>Williams </i>from this case, inferring that Ron’s incarceration is\r\na speculative possibility; that the terms and conditions of his probation are clear; and\r\nthat if he complies with them, he will not be incarcerated.  We are not persuaded by\r\nthis argument because in Ron’s petition, he  challenges various of the terms and\r\nconditions of his probation as being in conflict.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Citing <i>Ex parte Brister</i>, 801 S.W.2d 833, 835 (Tex. 1990), and <i>Ex parte\r\nDuncan</i>, 796 S.W.2d 562, 564 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1990, orig.\r\nproceeding), Ron asserts that courts have extended the meaning of restraint to include\r\nprobation, provided that the terms of probation include some type of tangible restraint\r\non liberty.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  Ron notes that in <i>In re Ragland</i>, 973 S.W.2d 769 (Tex. App.—Tyler\r\n1998, orig. proceeding), the Tyler Court of Appeals has held that the requirement of \r\nweekly community service over the course of a year qualified Ragland to pursue relief\r\nby petition for writ of habeas corpus.  <i>Id</i>. at 771.  Sheri attempts to distinguish <i>Brister</i>\r\nand <i>Duncan </i>from this case, saying that Ron is not subject to house arrest as Brister\r\nwas and his presence is not confined to Harris County as Duncan’s was.  The\r\ndistinctions Sheri attempts to draw between <i>Brister</i> and <i>Duncan</i> and this case are not\r\nsignificant inasmuch as in holding that Brister and Duncan were sufficiently\r\nrestrained to qualify for habeas corpus relief, the reviewing courts in those cases also\r\nreferred to requirements to report to CSO’s, a factor also present in Ron’s probation\r\nterms and conditions.  Additionally, Sheri makes no attempt to distinguish <i>Ragland</i>.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>To further support her contention that Ron is not sufficiently restrained to\r\nwarrant habeas corpus relief, Sheri cites <i>In re Look</i>, No. 01-02-00959-CV, 2003 Tex.\r\nApp. LEXIS 2056 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] March 5, 2003, orig. proceeding)\r\n(mem. op.) and<i> In re Thomas</i>, No. 01-07-00440-CV, 2008 Tex. App. LEXIS 2058\r\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] March 18, 2008, orig. proceeding) (mem. op.), cases\r\ninvolving probation conditions, restraint, and availability of habeas corpus review. \r\nIn <i>Look</i>, the terms and conditions of relator’s probation simply included the\r\nrequirement to make a monthly payment against an accumulated child support\r\narrearge, but did not include the obligation to report to a CSO or any other tangible\r\nrestriction on Look’s liberty.  <i>See Look</i>, 2003 Tex. App. LEXIS 2056, at *2-3.  We,\r\ntherefore, hold it to be inapplicable to the question of habeas corpus review in the\r\npresent case.  In <i>Thomas</i>, Thomas complained of having inadequate information to\r\ncomply with various terms and conditions of his suspension of commitment—having\r\nto participate in counseling,  without specification of what type of counseling, having\r\nto pay a community supervision fee without specification of where to pay it, and\r\nhaving to give his former spouse additional periods of possession of their child\r\nwithout specification of what those periods would be.  <i>Thomas</i>, 2008 Tex. App.\r\nLEXIS 2058, at *7-8. These simply constitute requests for additional information, but\r\ndo not rise to the level of allegations that the conditions are unconstitutionally vague\r\nso that he cannot reasonably comply with them.  Here, Ron complains about conflicts\r\nand ambiguities in the various orders ,which he asserts violate his due process rights. \r\nWe hold that Ron is restrained so as to be entitled to habeas corpus review.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Standard of Review</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>The purpose of a habeas corpus proceeding is not to determine the ultimate\r\nguilt or innocence of the relator, but only to ascertain whether the relator has been\r\nunlawfully restrained.  <i>Ex parte Gordon</i>, 584 S.W. 2d 686, 688 (Tex. 1979).  The\r\npresumption is that the order is valid.  <i>In re Turner</i>, 177 S.W.3d 284, 288 (Tex.\r\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2005, orig. proceeding) (citing <i>Ex parte Occhipenti</i>, 796\r\nS.W. 2d 805, 809 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1990, orig. proceeding)).  A writ\r\nof habeas corpus issues if a trial court’s contempt order is beyond the court’s power\r\nor the court did not afford the relator due process of law.  <i>Turner</i>, 177 S.W.3d at 288\r\n(<span>citing <i>In re Henry</i>, 154 S.W.3d 594, 596 (Tex. 2005)).  A relator bears the burden\r\nof showing that he is entitled to relief.  <i>Turner</i>, 177 S.W.3d at 288 (citing <i>Occhipenti</i>,\r\n796 S.W.2d at 809).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Conservatorship or Possession Modification</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Without Proper Pleadings and Evidence</span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span></span>In issue one, Ron asserts that the judgment of contempt is void because the trial\r\ncourt lacked authority to modify the effective terms of conservatorship or periods of\r\npossession<span> </span>without proper pleadings or proof.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In her response, Sheri contends that her enforcement motion clearly states that\r\nshe is requesting modifications to Ron’s periods of possession by limiting his access\r\nto the child.  In Sheri’s enforcement motion, the only relief that she requested relative\r\nto conservatorship or possession was that Ron’s “weekday possession schedule be\r\nsuspended to prevent the child from being removed from school early and from\r\nmissing any more school days for unexcused absences and to protect against over-medication of the child until RONALD SANNER is in full compliance with the\r\nCourt’s orders.”  Ron’s answer responded that Sheri’s request for clarification—that\r\nhis weekday possession schedule be suspended—should be denied because it would\r\neffect an unauthorized substantial change in the orders sought to be enforced.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In its enforcement order, the trial court modified its prior orders relative to\r\nconservatorship and possession in the following respects: (1) gave Sheri the exclusive\r\nright to consent to invasive medical and dental procedures, psychiatric, and\r\npsychological treatment for the child until he turns 18; (2) ordered all of Ron’s\r\nperiods of possession and access to the child to be supervised at all times by a third\r\nparty; (3) ordered that if Ron opted to have supervised possession of the child in a\r\ngroup setting, that the periods of possession would be set by SAFE Visitation\r\nProgram (“SVP”); (4) terminated Ron’s overnight periods of possession; (5) ordered\r\nthat all non-school-day visitation would begin at 9 a.m. and end at 8 p.m. and that\r\nschool-day visitation begin at the time school recessed and end at 8 p.m.; and (6)\r\nordered that if by December 19, 2008, Ron did not secure a private supervisor from\r\nthe SVP, that he access the child following a prescribed procedure involving\r\nregistering with the SVP for the supervised periods of possession as ordered in the\r\nenforcement order, to be carried out in accordance with all the SVP’s rules and\r\nregulations.  Additionally, the trial court provided that these orders took precedence\r\nover its prior orders, and it made compliance with their terms a condition of Ron’s\r\nnine-year probationary period. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Because Sheri did not request such measures in her motion for enforcement, \r\nRon was deprived of his due process right to notice that the trial court would consider\r\nsuch measures.  <i>See In reParks</i>, 264 S.W.3d 59, 62 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] \r\n2007, orig. proceeding) (holding, “Proper notification includes notification, from the\r\npleadings, of the relief that the court may grant.”) (citing <i>Cunningham v. Parkdale\r\nBank</i>, 660 S.W.2d 810, 812-13 (Tex. 1983) and <i>Barnett v. Barnett</i>, 640 S.W.2d 776,\r\n777 (Tex. App—Houston [1st Dist.] 1982, no writ)); <span>Tex. Fam. Code Ann.</span> §\r\n157.002(a)(3) (Vernon 2008) (“A motion for enforcement must, in ordinary and\r\nconscise language . . . state the relief requested by the movant.”).  Without proper\r\npleadings and evidence, a trial court exceeds its authority if it modifies or reforms\r\nprevious orders affecting the custody of a child.  <i>Parks</i>, 264 S.W.3d at 62 (citing <i>In\r\nre A.M.</i>, 974 S.W.2d 857, 861 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1998, no pet.); <i>Ex parte\r\nKarr</i>, 663 S.W.2d 534, 539 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 1983, orig. proceeding), and\r\n<i>Martin v. Martin</i>, 519 S.W.2d 900, 902 (Tex. Civ. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1975,\r\nno writ)).  When a trial court’s judgment exceeds its authority, an appellate court may\r\ngrant habeas corpus relief.  <i>Parks</i>, 264 S.W.3d at 62, (citing <i>Turner</i>, 177 S.W.3d at\r\n288).  Here, without proper pleadings, the trial court exceeded its authority by\r\nmodifying and reforming some of the conservatorship and possession provisions of\r\nits prior orders in the ways outlined in the six items stated above.  Accordingly, we\r\nhold those provisions to be void and strike them from the trial court’s enforcement\r\norder.  <i>See, e.g., Ex parte Linder</i>, 783 S.W.2d 754, 758 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1990,\r\norig. proceeding) (when trial court assessed separate measures of enforcement relief\r\nand one was invalid, court of appeals severed the void portion and left the remainder\r\nof the contempt judgment intact).</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Nevertheless, citing <i>Ex parte Boyle</i>, 545 S.W.2d 25, 28 (Tex. App.—Houston\r\n[1st Dist.] 1976, orig. proceeding), Sheri contends that these matters were tried by\r\nconsent; that Ron came into the hearing knowing that Sheri was asking the court to\r\nenter an order altering his periods of possession; and that though he objected in his\r\nwritten answer, he went through the trial and made no further objection. \r\nAdditionally, she asserts that an exhibit that she admitted at the hearing outlined the\r\nrelief that she was requesting, including a request to limit Ron’s access to the child.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Sheri’s trial by consent contention is unavailing.  This case is distinguishable\r\nfrom <i>Boyle</i>.  In <i>Boyle</i>, Boyle contended that the order of commitment was void\r\nbecause it required him to pay attorney’s fees when his former spouse had not\r\nrequested attorney’s fees in her motion for contempt.  <i>Id</i>. at 28.  In rejecting that\r\ncomplaint, we noted that the contempt proceeding was brought pursuant to former\r\nTexas Rule of Civil Procedure 308-A,</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  which provided that the attorney representing\r\nthe child support obligee should file with the clerk of the court a written statement,\r\nverified by the affidavit of the child support claimant, describing the child support\r\nobligor’s claimed disobedience of the trial court’s child support order. <i> Id</i>.  We noted\r\nparticularly, that former Rule 308-A went on to provide that “‘no further written\r\npleadings shall be required.’”<span> </span><i>Id</i>.  We also noted that  the attorney for the movant\r\nasked for attorney’s fees during the case.  <i>Id</i>.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In contrast, the instant case is brought pursuant to Texas Family Code\r\nAnnotated, § 157.002 (Vernon 2008) with stronger pleading requirements than those\r\nof former Rule 308-A.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  Additionally, unlike in <i>Boyle</i>, in which at trial, Boyle’s\r\nformer wife requested the attorney’s fees not pleaded for, here, Sheri, during the\r\nhearing, did not ask for the trial court’s prior conservatorship and possession orders\r\nto be modified in the way the trial court provided in its enforcement order.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Regarding Sheri’s assertion that Ron had knowledge that she was asking the\r\ncourt to alter his periods of possession, his knowledge was limited to paragraph 14\r\nof her amended petition for enforcement, which asked only for his weekday\r\npossession schedule to be “<i>suspended</i> . . . until RONALD SANNER is in full\r\ncompliance with the Court’s orders.” <span>(</span>Emphasis added.)  This pleading did not put\r\nhim on notice that the court would consider, for the duration of the child’s childhood,\r\naltering Ron’s medical, dental, and psychological consultation rights; <i>terminating</i><span> </span>his\r\novernight periods of possession; requiring all his visitation to be supervised; and the\r\nother conservatorship and possession modifications that the court made.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Regarding Sheri’s assertion that after objecting in his answer to Sheri’s\r\nrequested relief of suspension of his weekday possession schedule, Ron went through\r\nthe trial and made no further objection to alteration of the trial court’s prior\r\nconservatorship and possession orders, it was not until after he had rested and the trial\r\ncourt rendered its judgment that he learned of the unpleaded-for relief that the trial\r\ncourt ordered.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Finally, Sheri’s assertion that Ron had notice because she proffered an exhibit\r\noutlining the relief that she was requesting, which included a request to limit Ron’s\r\naccess to the child, is without merit.  An examination of the reporter’s record shows\r\nthat during Sheri’s counsel’s testimony on attorney’s fees, she made a brief reference\r\nto an Exhibit 2 “on relief requested,” but that it was not tendered to Ron’s counsel,\r\nnor did the trial court admit it into evidence. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>We sustain Ron’s first issue and grant the alternative relief that he requested\r\nunder it as follows.  We strike from body of the enforcement order, as well as the\r\nattached conditions of probation, those provisions that award to Sheri the exclusive\r\nright to consent for the child to invasive medical and dental treatment and to his\r\npsychological care.

Unauthorized Doctors and Medication</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In issue two, Ron asserts that enforcement order is void with respect to\r\nviolations 3, 5, and 7 because the terms of the underlying order were not sufficiently\r\nspecific to be enforced by contempt.  In violations 3 and 5, the trial court found that\r\nRon took the child to see doctors who had not been recommended by the Texas\r\nChildren’s Hospital Learning Support Center (“TCHLSC”)—Dr. Barton in 2008 and\r\nDr. Young in 2007.  In violation 7, the trial court found that Ron put the child on\r\n“Strattera as prescribed by Dr. Tran, a medication other than the Adderall\r\nrecommended by the child’s current doctor, which interferes with the child’s\r\nmedication prescribed by his current doctor.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>These violations are based on the following language in the July 21, 2006\r\nAgreed Final Order Modifying Prior Order in Suit Affecting the Parent-Child\r\nRelationship:</span></p>\r\n<p><span><i><span><span>          </span>ADD/ADHD Evaluation</span></i></span></p>\r\n<p><span>The parties agree and IT IS THERFORE ORDERED that the\r\nchild, [name], shall be evaluated at Texas Children’s Hospital Learning\r\nSupport Center for ADD/ADHD, or any other condition the child might\r\nhave, and with respect to any medication, if any, necessary for any such\r\nconditions found.  It is ORDERED that all costs associated with the\r\nevaluation(s) shall be processed through . . . . It is ORDERED that all\r\ncurrent treatment of the child shall remain unchanged until the\r\nevaluation(s) has been performed and completed.  The parties are\r\nORDERED to follow all recommendations of existing doctors.</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span>IT IS FURTHER AGREED AND THEREFORE ORDERED that\r\nthe Texas Children’s Hospital Learning Support Center evaluation and\r\nrecommendation shall be controlling on all issues pertaining to the child\r\nhaving, or not having as the case may be, ADD/ADHD and the need for\r\nany medication related thereto.  IT IS ORDERED that both parties . . . \r\nare enjoined from taking the child to any other psychologist,\r\npsychiatrist, therapist or medical professionals related to these health\r\nissues unless Texas Children’s Hospital Learning Support Center\r\nrecommends the child to see an outside provider except the child’s\r\ncurrent treating doctors.  Each party is ordered to cooperate [in]. . . \r\nevaluations of the child . . . .  Nothing in this order shall be interpreted\r\nto prohibit the child from seeing other medical health professionals\r\nreferred by Dr. Muzumdar for other medical issues.  To the extent Texas\r\nChildren’s Hospital Learning Support Center’s recommendations do not\r\naddress an issue, the parties are ORDERED to abide by all prior court\r\norders pertaining to such issue.</span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In his petition, Ron asserts that TCHLSC’s recommendations did not exist on\r\nJuly 21, 2006, the date the trial court signed the Agreed Final Order Modifying Prior\r\nOrder in Suit Affecting the Parent-Child Relationship.  Ron also asserts that since the\r\ndate of the signing of the agreed final order, TCHLSC recommendations have not\r\nbeen incorporated into any written court order.   </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>While those assertions are true, Exhibit 12 to the reporter’s record shows that\r\nTCHLSC made its evaluation of the child and written recommendations less than a\r\nmonth later, on August 14, 2006, with Ron as a copied recipient.  In them, TCHLSC\r\nmade no recommendations that the child see Dr. Young or Dr. Barton.  On cross-examination, Sheri’s counsel asked Ron if TCHLSC had recommended Dr. Young,\r\nto which, Ron responded, “[N]o.”  This indicates that Ron was familiar with\r\nTCHLSC’s recommendations and their contents.  Sheri testified, without\r\ncontradiction, that neither Dr. Barton nor Dr. Young were recommended by\r\nTCHLSC.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In his petition, Ron contends that  Sheri offered no evidence to show that Dr.\r\nYoung and Dr. Barton did not come under the “current treating doctors” exception\r\nto the injunction prohibiting taking the child to non-TCHLSC recommended doctors. \r\nThis is not accurate, however.  Exhibit 9, the business records of Cornerstone\r\nPsychiatry, contain documents showing that Ron took the child to see Doctor Young\r\nfor the first time in 2007 and Dr. Barton for the first time in 2008. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>With respect to violations 3 and 5, the injunction prohibiting the child’s parents\r\nfrom taking the child to see non-TCHLSC recommended doctors is clear.  It does not\r\nrest on implication or conjecture and is not susceptible to more than one meaning,\r\nmeeting a test for clarity announced in <i>Acker</i>.  <i>See Acker</i>, 949 S.W.2d at 317.  Ron’s\r\ntestimony that TCHLSC did not recommend Dr. Young is additional evidence that\r\nRon understood the injunction. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Regarding violation 7, the July 21, 2006 order, under the ADD/ADHD\r\nEvaluation section, provides that until TCHLSC’s evaluation or evaluations are done,\r\nthe current treatment of the child should remain unchanged, but that, thereafter,\r\nTCHLSC’s, ADD/ADHD medication recommendation would control.  TCHLSC’s\r\nrecommendation regarding AD/HD medication was that “continued medication\r\ntreatment is warranted,” but that it should be monitored for efficacy at least annually. \r\nThe language of this recommendation is vague in that it does not specify a particular\r\nmedication.  Such a recommendation could be construed to support continued use of\r\nAdderall, but would not preclude the use of Straterra, which the child’s AD/HD\r\ndoctor, Dr. Rosenberg, testified that he had discussed  with Ron before the summer\r\nof 2008.  Because July 21, 2006 order made the TCHLSC’s AD/HD medication\r\nrecommendation controlling, but the recommendation itself was susceptible of more\r\nthan one meaning, we hold that it was not sufficiently specific to support enforcement\r\nas found by the trial court in violation 7.  We hold violation 7 to be void.  We sustain\r\nissue two relative to violation 7, but deny it relative to violations 3 and 5.  We strike\r\nviolation 7 from the enforcement order.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span><span>C.  Refusal to Administer Medication</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In issue three, Ron asserts that the language of the April 5, 2005 Order in Suit\r\nto Modify Parent Child Relationship is too vague to be enforced as stated in\r\nviolations 9, 10, and 11 of the enforcement order.  In violations 9, 10, and 11 of the\r\nenforcement order, the trial court found that on three different occasions, during a\r\nperiod of his possession of the child that, Ron “refused to give the child medication.” \r\nThe language sought to be enforced provides that: “IT IS ORDERED that RONALD\r\nJAMES SANNER AND SHERI RENEE DOOLEY are permanently enjoined from:\r\n. . . Removing the child from, stopping the child from, or preventing the child from\r\ntaking any medication prescribed for the child.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Ron contends that the way the order is written, there is nothing that\r\naffirmatively obligates him to administer the medication to the child and that as long\r\nas he did nothing to prevent the child from taking the medication, his conduct is not\r\nsusceptible to a contempt finding.  We agree.  The order sought to be enforced did not\r\norder Ron to give the child medication.  Because the trial court’s findings in\r\nviolations 9, 10, and 11 found Ron guilty of contempt for not performing specific acts\r\nthat he was not ordered by the court to do, they must fail.  <i>See Ex parte Hodges</i>, 625\r\nS.W.2d 304, 306 (Tex. 1981) (holding invalid trial court findings that Hodges was in\r\ncontempt for not turning over to receiver certain company records and for refusing\r\nto permit receiver to take physical inventory of company when order sought to be\r\nenforced did not order Hodges to turn over company records or to permit receiver to\r\ntake physical inventory of company).  We sustain issue three and strike violations 9,\r\n10, and 11 from the enforcement order.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span><span>D.  Making Disparaging Remarks</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In issue seven, Ron asserts that violations 36-54 of the enforcement order are\r\nvoid because they are based on an injunctive order that is vague or is an\r\nunconstitutional infringement on his right to free speech.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>The trial court’s April 5, 2005 Order in Suit to Modify Parent-Child\r\nRelationship contains a permanent injunction based on the findings that (1) the parties\r\nhad entered into an agreement regarding the modification and that the agreement was\r\nin the best interest of the child and (2) that because of the conduct of the parties, a\r\npermanent injunction should be granted for appropriate relief, said injunction being\r\nin the best interest of the child.   The trial court’s order then enjoins both parties from\r\n“Making or permitting to be made any disparaging remarks concerning the other\r\nparty, their respective families, or this litigation.”  In the enforcement order, the trial\r\ncourt found that in emails that Ron had sent to Sheri, he had violated this order 19\r\ntimes.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Ron contends that the injunctive order in question is not specific enough to be\r\nenforced.  Ron gives the dictionary definition of “disparage” as “to speak slightingly\r\nabout.”  To this could be added, to “depreciate, belittle”; “to bring reproach or\r\ndiscredit upon.”  <i>Random House Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary</i> 567 (2d ed.\r\n2001).  Ron then asserts that this definition presumes that the statements are being\r\nmade about someone to a third person.  Ron argues that he sent the emails to Sheri\r\nand no one else and that Sheri’s interpretation of the underlying order would permit\r\nher to assert that every remark Ron makes to her should be considered disparaging\r\nbased on her own sensibilities, while they were not necessarily intended as such.  \r\nThis overlooks the fact that when Sheri brings a charge in a motion to enforce that\r\nRon has violated the order by making a disparaging remark that the trial court\r\nevaluates the alleged disparaging remark to determine whether it is disparaging. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>With reference to his free speech contention, Ron asserts that because the\r\ninjunction does not limit the prohibition of making disparaging remarks about each\r\nother, their families, and the litigation to such remarks made to the child or in its\r\npresence, the injunction could apply to statements made to a co-worker or to a\r\ntherapist.  We note that there is no evidence in the record of such circumstances. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>To support his contention that the injunction is void as an unconstitutional\r\ninfringement on his right to free speech, Ron cites <i>Grigsby v. Coker</i>, 904 S.W.2d 619\r\n(Tex. 1995) and <i>Davenport v. Garcia</i>, 834 S.W.2d 4 (Tex. 1992).  These cases are\r\ndistinguishable from the instant case.  Both <i>Grigsby</i> and <i>Davenport</i> deal with “gag\r\norders,” pre-trial orders issued by judges to the parties not to discuss imminent\r\nlitigation outside the court, <i>see Davenport</i>, 834 S.W.2d at 6 and <i>Grigsby</i>, 904 S.W.2d\r\nat 620, designed to prevent imminent and  irreparable harm to the judicial process that\r\nwould deprive litigants of a just resolution of their soon-to-be-tried dispute.  <i>See\r\nDavenport</i>, 834 S.W.2d at 10.  In contrast, in the instant case, the injunction in the\r\norder sought to be enforced was not made on the <i>eve</i> of trial to protect its outcome. \r\nRather it was made <i>after</i> a trial of a motion to modify resulting in findings that (1) the\r\nparties had entered into an agreement regarding the requested modification, which\r\nwas in the best interest of the child and (2) because of the conduct of the parties, a\r\npermanent injunction should be granted for appropriate relief, said injunction being\r\nin the best interest of the child.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>We conclude that Ron has not carried his burden to show that he is entitled to\r\nhabeas corpus relief with respect to issue seven.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Notice to Ron of Way Prior Order Violated</span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In issues four, five, and six, Ron asserts that enumerated violations of prior\r\norders as found by the trial court in its enforcement order are void because they do\r\nnot state the manner in which Ron violated the court’s prior order.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span><span>A.  Standard of Review</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span></span>An enforcement order must include the manner of a respondent’s\r\nnoncompliance with the order sought to be enforced.  <span>Tex. Fam. Code Ann.</span> §\r\n157.166(a)(3) (Vernon 2008).  The purpose of an enforcement order is to notify the\r\ncontemnor of how he has violated the provisions for which enforcement is sought and\r\nhow he can purge himself of contempt, to notify the sheriff accordingly so that he\r\nmay do his duty, and to provide sufficient information for adequate review.  <i>Ex parte\r\nConoly</i>, 732 S.W.2d 695, 697 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1987, orig. proceeding).  The\r\ncontempt order “‘must contain specific findings so that the contemner will be fully\r\napprised of his alleged act of misconduct so that he may overcome by proof, if any\r\nis available, the presumption of the validity of the order.’”  <i>Id</i>. (quoting <i>Ex parte\r\nHardy</i>, 531 S.W.2d 895, 896 (Tex. Civ. App.—Dallas 1975, orig. proceeding)).  A\r\ncontempt order is insufficient if its interpretation requires inferences or conclusions\r\nabout which reasonable persons might differ.  <i>Turner</i>, 177 S.W.3d at 289 (citing <i>In\r\nre Houston</i>, 92 S.W.3d 870, 877 (Tex.

Removal of Child from School or </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>     Causing Child to Miss School</span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span></span>In issues four and five, Ron asserts that, in violations 12-23 and 24-27 of the\r\nenforcement order, the trial court failed to state the manner in which he violated the\r\nunderlying prior order sought to be enforced. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In her enforcement motion, Sheri states allegations 12-23 generally, “[T]he\r\nchild was removed from school early on [date] without notice to Sheri.”  Allegations\r\n24-27 read generally, “[T]he child was absent from school on [date] which was not\r\nan excused absence and without notice to Sheri Dooley.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In the enforcement order, the trial court states violations 12-23 generally, “The\r\nchild was removed from school early on [date] without notice to Sheri Dooley.” \r\nViolations 24-27 read generally as follows: “The child was absent from school on\r\n[date], which was not an excused absence and without notice to Sheri Dooley.” </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Ron challenges these violations, arguing that there is no finding that he is in\r\nanyway involved in the events which may have led to the child’s removal.  We agree.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>The trial court findings in violations 12-27 do not constitute violations of the\r\nJuly 21, 2006 modification order sought to be enforced.  The language in that order\r\nprovides as follows: </span></p>\r\n<p><span>IT IS ORDERED that Petitioner and Respondent are hereby\r\npermanently enjoined from:</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span>(1) Removing the child from the school or causing the child to\r\nmiss school for any purpose other than for a illness or for medical\r\nappointments for which advanced notification has been provided to both\r\nparties in writing, or has been recommended by Dr. Muzumdar when the\r\nparties have been unable to reach an agreement . . . .</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span>IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that neither party shall remove the child\r\nfrom school for any purpose other than if the child is ill, or for a\r\nscheduled appointment agreed to by the parties or recommended by Dr.\r\nMuzumdar, or otherwise agreed to by the parties with respect to the\r\nspecific absence.</span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span>The language of paragraph “(1)” prohibits the parties from removing the child from\r\nschool or causing him to miss school, except in cases of (1) the child’s illness, (2)\r\nmedical appointments for the child for which either of the parties has provided\r\nadvanced written notification to the other of the appointment, and (3) medical\r\nappointments recommended by Dr. Muzumdar when the parties have been unable to\r\nreach an agreement.  The last paragraph set out also prohibits the parties from\r\nremoving the child from school except in cases of (4) scheduled appointments agreed\r\nto by the parties, (5) scheduled appointments recommended by Dr. Muzumdar, or (6)\r\nscheduled appointments otherwise agreed to by the parties with respect to the specific\r\nabsence.  These possibilities do not create a general obligation on the parties’ part to\r\nnotify each other when they remove the child from school or cause the child to miss\r\nschool.  Nevertheless, in violations 12-27, when the trial court found Ron’s\r\npurportedly contemptuous conduct as removing the child from school early without\r\nnotice to Sheri or the child absent from school without notice to Sheri, it convicted\r\nhim of violating such a non-existent general obligation of notice to Sheri.  This is\r\nakin to convicting a person of a crime on the basis of conduct that does not constitute\r\nthe crime, which offends the basic notion of justice and fair play embodied in the\r\nUnited States Constitution.  <i>Hammock v. State</i>, 211 S.W.3d 874, 879 (Tex.\r\nApp.—Texarkana 2006, no pet.) (quoting <i>United States v. Briggs</i>, 939 F.2d 222, 228\r\n(5th Cir. 1991)).</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>From the enforcement order, we strike, as void, violations 12-27.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span><span>C.  Refusal to Return Child to Sheri’s Residence as Ordered</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In issue six, Ron asserts that violations 28-33 of the enforcement order are void\r\nbecause they fail to state the manner in which Ron violated the trial court’s April 5,\r\n2005 modification order.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>The April 5, 2005 modification order provides that Ron is to return the child\r\nto Sheri’s residence at the end of each period of possession, but if a period of Ron’s\r\npossession ends at the time the child’s school resumes, he is to surrender the child to\r\nSheri at the child’s school.  This order also contains a provision that when they return\r\nthe child, the parties are also to return the personal effects that the child brought at\r\nthe beginning of the period of possession.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In violations 28-33, the trial court found Ron guilty of separate acts of\r\ncontempt, which are each expressed as follows: “The parties continue to reside in the\r\nsame county and Ronald Sanner refused to return the child to the residence of Sheri\r\nDooley as ordered on [specified date].”  Ron argues that these violations do not\r\nspecify the manner in which Ron failed to comply because the way they are\r\nexpressed, they could include Ron’s failure to return the child at a designated time or\r\nlocation or his failure to return the child with all his belongings.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Here, however, the corresponding allegations in Sheri’s enforcement motion,\r\nwhich Ron received, mentioned only Ron’s refusal to return the child to Sheri’s\r\nresidence, mentioning nothing about Ron’s delivering the child late or without his\r\npersonal effects.  In Sheri’s testimony, in response to her counsel’s question regarding\r\nwhat violations 28-33 deal with, Sheri responded that they had to do with the fact that\r\nRon did not bring the child back to her home.  Ron’s testimony on this subject also\r\nfocused on the place the child was surrendered, mentioning nothing about the child’s\r\npersonal effects and discussing a late surrender in only one of the six instances.  The\r\nrecord does not show that Ron was confused about the trial court’s rendition of\r\njudgment on these violations.  We hold that the interpretation of violations 28-33 as\r\nbeing one that Ron refused to return the child to Sheri’s residence, without reference\r\nto the time that the child was returned or whether he was returned with his personal\r\nbelongings, does not require inferences or conclusions about which reasonable\r\npersons might differ.  We further hold that violation 28-33 of the enforcement order\r\nnotify Ron of the  manner in which he violated the court’s April 5, 2005 modification\r\norder and that it provides sufficient information for an adequate review.  <i>See Turner</i>,\r\n177 S.W.3d at 289 (quoting <i>Conoly</i>, 732 S.W.2d at 697). </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Ron argues that Sheri has waived her right to enforce this right to have the\r\nchild delivered to her residence because she and Ron have established a pattern of\r\nsurrendering the child at a neutral spot.  The Texas Supreme Court has referred to\r\nwaiver as a “voluntary relinquishment of a known right.”  <i>Motor Veh. Bd. of the Tex.\r\nDep’t. of Transp. v. El Paso Indep. Auto. Dealers Ass’n., Inc.</i>, 1 S.W.3d 108, 111\r\n(Tex. 1999).  Sheri’s testimony on this matter is that she and Ron do not have an\r\nagreement to meet in the middle between their residences to surrender the child and\r\nthat it has developed that way because “[Ron’s] told me pretty much I have to meet\r\nhim there or I don’t see my child.”  This is evidence that Sheri has not voluntarily\r\nrelinquished the rights provided in the modification order to have Ron deliver the\r\nchild to her residence.  We hold that Ron has not carried his burden to show that he\r\nis entitled to habeas corpus relief for violations 28-33 on the basis of waiver.  We\r\noverrule issue six.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Validity of Child Support Violations in Enforcement Order</span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span></span>In issue eight, Ron asserts that there is no evidence to support violations 56-113 relative to child support and medical reimbursement payments; that the evidence\r\noffered by Sheri does not rise to the level of “beyond a reasonable doubt.”  He\r\nrequests that we set aside as void violations 56-113 and related probationary\r\nconditions because they are without support in the evidence.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>A judgment of contempt without support in the evidence is void and may be\r\nattacked and set aside even in a collateral proceeding.  <i>Ex parte Davila</i>, 718 S.W.2d\r\n281, 282 (Tex. 1986).  As a reviewing court, we may determine only if the trial\r\ncourt’s contempt findings are so completely without evidentiary support that the trial\r\ncourt’s judgment is void because it deprives a relator of liberty without due process\r\nof law.  <i>In re Pruitt</i>, 6 S.W.3d 363, 364 (Tex. App.—Beaumont 1999, orig.\r\nproceeding).  A criminal contempt conviction for disobedience of a court order\r\nrequires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of (1) a reasonably specific order; (2) a\r\nviolation of the order; and (3) the willful intent to violate the order.  <i>Ex parte\r\nChambers</i>, 898 S.W.2d 257, 259 (Tex. 1995).</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Ron argues that Sheri offered no evidence of the dates that the child support\r\nand medical support payments were due, of the dates on which Ron allegedly failed\r\nto make complete payments, and of the amounts that were or were not paid on each\r\nof these dates.  We agree.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Sheri testified that Ron is ordered to pay child support of $475 a month, which\r\nstarted in June 2006, but she gave no testimony regarding what day of the month the\r\npayment is due.  Similarly, regarding medical support, Sheri testified that Ron is\r\nordered to pay her $63 a month, without specifying the day of the month on which it\r\nis due.  Sheri testified that violation 56 is Ron’s failure to pay child support and\r\nmedical premium reimbursement, but she did not testify the date it was due.\r\nRegarding violations 57-113, Sheri offered no testimony of the day that the violations\r\noccurred or the amount that Ron paid or did not pay on the due dates.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Sheri introduced into evidence Exhibit 10, a computer print-out from the Harris\r\nCounty Child Support System showing the dates and amounts of Ron’s support\r\npayments since 2003.  It does not, however, list the child support payments that Ron\r\nfailed to pay, the amount that he failed to pay, or the dates that he failed to make\r\nthem.  Our sister court, the Fourteenth Court of Appeals, has held such a print-out,\r\nattached as a contempt order exhibit, to be legally inadequate to show the way in\r\nwhich the relator had contemptuously disobeyed the underlying order.  <i>See In re\r\nNesevitch</i>, 93 S.W.3d 510, 513 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, orig.\r\nproceeding).  The Fourteenth Court of Appeals held the print-out to be legally\r\ninadequate for that purpose because it did not contain the dates that the support\r\npayments were due and the amounts relator paid or did not pay on those due dates. \r\n<i>Id</i>.  Similarly, in this case, we hold that Exhibit 10 provides no evidence to support\r\nviolations 56-113 in Sheri’s enforcement motion.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Sheri argues that the trial court took judicial notice of the orders at issue and \r\nthe payment history, combined them, and derived the evidence necessary to support\r\nthe violations in its enforcement order.  Sheri does not provide a cite to the place in\r\nthe record where the trial court took judicial notice of the order in issue.  Because\r\nthey are supported by no evidence, we hold violations 56-113 to be void. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Under this issue, Ron also complains that the enforcement order lacks\r\nsufficient clarity to be enforced because of ambiguity relative to the trial court’s\r\ncalculation of the amount of child and medical support arrearage.  Ron contends that \r\nto the extent that his liberty depends on compliance with conditions of probation\r\ninvolving his payment of the arrearage that the trial court found in the enforcement\r\norder, the enforcement order should be declared void. We agree.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>When the amounts shown for violations 56-113 in the “Amount Due” column\r\nof the enforcement order are added, the total comes to $15,036, but the enforcement\r\norder shows the total of that column to be $17,184.  When the amounts  in the\r\n“Amount Paid” for those violations are added, the total comes to $14,000, but the\r\nenforcement order shows the total for that column to be $16,700.  If $14,000 is\r\nsubtracted from $15,036, the resulting amount of arrearage would be $1,036.  In the\r\nenforcement order, however, the trial court shows an arrearage of $1,264.79, arrived\r\nat by subtracting $16,700 from $17,184 to get $484, to which it adds $631.95 from\r\na previous child support judgment, $90.69 from a previous medical support judgment,\r\nand $58.15 as interest.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In her response brief, Sheri concedes the erroneous calculation of the arrearage\r\nin the enforcement order as an attempt to match it to the $1,264.79 total arrearage to\r\nwhich she testified.  Citing <i>In re Patillo</i>, 32 S.W.3d 907, 910 (Tex. App.—Corpus\r\nChristi 2000, orig. proceeding), Sheri contends that the error can be remedied by\r\nreformation of the enforcement order.  In <i>Patillo</i>, the court of appeals was able to\r\nreform the civil coercive confinement provision of the enforcement order from\r\nconfinement until Patillo paid a total arrearage of $44,081, to confinement until he\r\npaid $10,150, the amount for which Patillo had actually been held in contempt for not\r\npaying. <i>Id</i>. at 909-10.  Here, because we have held that the child/medical support\r\nviolations (56-113) to be void, we do not have the information necessary to do a\r\nreformation such as was done in <i>Patillo</i>.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Also impairing the ability to reform the arrearage are additional ambiguities in\r\nthe record.  Sheri testified that she had calculated each of the pages on Exhibit 10 and\r\nthat Ron was in arrears in the amount of $1,264.79.  She testified that this was broken\r\ndown into $956.02 for child support and $300.78 for medical premium\r\nreimbursement. (Id. l. 14-16) When these are added, however, they do not total\r\n$1,264.79.  Additionally, Sheri testified that Ron was obligated to reimburse her $63\r\nper month for medical expenses, a figure that she presumably used to arrive at her\r\narrearage calculation.  Yet, the order in question, provided as part of the instant\r\nhabeas record, shows the amount ordered to be $62 per month. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Ron asserts that to the extent that he has been ordered to pay Sheri the\r\narrearage by a date certain as part of his probationary terms in the enforcement order\r\nand in its Exhibit A, or risk incarceration, the enforcement order should be declared\r\nvoid.  We agree and strike these two provisions from the enforcement order as void\r\nfor being in derogation of Ron’s due process right to notice of the way in which he\r\nhas violated the order sought to be enforced. <i> Slavin</i>, 412 S.W.2d. at 45 (“‘Where the\r\ncourt seeks to punish either by fine, arrest or imprisonment for the disobedience of\r\nan order or command, such order or command must carry with it no uncertainty, and\r\nmust not be susceptible of different meanings or constructions . . . .’”) (quoting <i>Ex\r\nparte Duncan</i>, 62 S.W. 758 (Tex. Crim. App. 1901)). </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>We sustain issue eight.  We strike from the enforcement order violations 56-113, the attendant arrearage sums, and the conditions of probation that Ron pay a\r\nchild support arrearage of $1,264.79.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Clarity of Terms of Probation</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In issue nine, Ron contends that the enforcement order is void because the\r\nterms for probation are not sufficiently specific or they directly conflict with one\r\nanother.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Ron first asserts that there is a conflict in terms regarding his periods of\r\npossession of the child.  The first term of community supervision within the body of\r\nthe enforcement order requires that Ron comply with the terms of possession and\r\naccess to the child as stated in the body of the enforcement order.  Ron then points to\r\nthe first term of Exhibit A, attached to the enforcement order, which requires him to\r\ncomply with the terms and conditions of possession and access to the child as ordered\r\nin the enforcement order and the April 5, 2005 Order in Suit to Modify Parent-Child\r\nRelationship.  Under our earlier disposition of issue one, we struck the possession and\r\naccess provisions in the enforcement order.  Therefore, if there was a conflict between\r\nthe possession and access provisions of the enforcement order and those of the April\r\n5, 2005 order, it no longer exists.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Next, Ron asserts that there is a conflict between the fourth community\r\nsupervision provision in the body of the enforcement order that requires him to report\r\nto the CSO as specified by the CSO and the provision in Exhibit A that requires him\r\nto report to the CSO immediately after the hearing and at least once each month\r\nthereafter or each week if not employed full time.  In her response, Sheri implies that\r\nthese provisions are not in conflict.  She asserts that the provision in Exhibit A sets\r\nthe general parameters for the frequency of Ron’s reporting to the CSO, while the\r\nfourth term in the body of the enforcement order simply gives the CSO flexibility\r\nwithin the general parameters to specify the exact time and date for the meetings. \r\nThis is one interpretation, but these provisions could also be interpreted as requiring\r\nthat Ron meet with the CSO monthly if he is employed and weekly if he is\r\nunemployed, as well as to meet with the CSO whenever the CSO specifies, even if\r\nmore frequently than monthly or weekly.  Because the interpretation of such\r\nprovisions requires inferences or conclusions about which reasonable persons might\r\ndiffer, they are of insufficient clarity to apprise Ron of what he must do to avoid\r\nlosing his liberty and, therefore, are unconstitutionally vague.  <i>See Houston</i>, 92\r\nS.W.3d at 877 (holding that a contempt order is insufficient if its interpretation\r\nrequires inferences or conclusions about which reasonable persons might differ).  We\r\nstrike these provisions from the enforcement order.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Ron asserts that there is also a conflict in the probationary provisions regarding\r\nthe duration of the probation. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Within the body of the enforcement order, the trial court provides:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that commitment is suspended and\r\nRespondent placed on community supervision <i>for a period of 9 years</i> on\r\nthe following terms and conditions:</span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span>(Emphasis added.)  On page one of Exhibit A, “Terms and Conditions of Community\r\nSupervision” to the enforcement order, the trial court provides:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>This Exhibit is incorporated in the Judgment of Contempt for all\r\npurposes as ordered by this Court.  The Court suspends the commitment\r\nand orders that RONALD SANNER hereinafter referred to as\r\nRespondent, is placed on community supervision <i>for a period of nine\r\nyears</i> . . . .</span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span>On page three of Exhibit A, “Terms and Conditions of Community Supervision for\r\nNonpayment of Child Support” to the enforcement order, however, the trial court\r\nprovides:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>This Exhibit is incorporated into the Judgment of Contempt for all\r\npurposes as ordered by this Court.  The Court suspends the commitment\r\nand orders that Ronald Sanner, Respondent, is placed on community\r\nsupervision through the HARRIS COUNTY DOMESTIC RELATIONS\r\nOFFICE (DRO).  <i>The term of community supervision is 9 yrs. from the\r\ndate of this order OR until all child support arrearages are paid,\r\nwhichever occurs first, as determined by the Community Supervision\r\nOfficer.</i></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span>(Emphasis added.)</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>The first two provisions prescribe an unconditional 9-year duration for the\r\nprobationary period, whereas the last one can be interpreted that if Ron pays the child\r\nsupport arrearage at any time and it is confirmed by the CSO, Ron is released from\r\nthe probationary conditions, which otherwise suspend his commitment.  Sheri\r\nresponds that it is clear from the record that the trial court’s ruling and intent are that\r\nthe term of the community supervision operate until the child becomes eighteen.  She\r\nasserts that if there is a conflict, the remedy is for this Court to reform it.  We agree.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>At the conclusion of the hearing, in the course of its rendition, the trial court\r\nstated as follows:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Court: Rules of probation and this child is nine years of age.  Rules of\r\nprobation last for the next nine years until the child is 18.</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span>Counsel for Ron: I’m sorry.  I didn’t get that.</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span>Court: Instead of ten years of probation, that would not be appropriate\r\nbecause the Court will lose jurisdiction over the child when the child\r\nturns 18.  So, these rules of probation are in effect until the child turns\r\n18.</span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span>Nowhere in the course of its rendition did the trial court say anything about\r\ncommunity supervision’s ending upon Ron’s payment of the child support arrearage. \r\nAdditionally, we have already held the trial court’s adjudication of the amount of\r\nchild support arrearage to be erroneous.  We strike from the enforcement order\r\n“Exhibit ‘A,’ Terms and Conditions of Community Supervision for Nonpayment of\r\nChild Support,” page 3, the portion of the provision relative to the duration of\r\ncommunity supervision that provides that community supervision would end upon\r\nRon’s payment of all child support arrearages.  <i>See Felters v. State</i>, 147 S.W.3d 488,\r\n491-92 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2004, pet. refused) (court of appeals reformed\r\nduration of community supervision from 24 months as incorrectly stated in trial\r\ncourt’s written judgment to 180 days because of trial court’s oral pronouncement of\r\nthat community supervision was to be for 180 days).  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>We sustain issue nine to the extent that we strike the void CSO provisions\r\nregarding when Ron is to report to the CSO and strike the provision that Ron’s\r\ncommunity supervision would end upon his payment of all child support arrearages. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Attorney’s Fees</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In issue 10, Ron asserts that the enforcement order is void because the trial\r\ncourt did not have authority to award the total amount of attorney’s fees as child\r\nsupport.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>The Family Code requires the trial court to award attorney’s fees if it finds that\r\nthe respondent has failed to make child support payments or failed to comply with the\r\nterms of an order providing for the possession of or access to a child.  <span>Tex. Fam.\r\nCode Ann.</span> § 157.167(a), (b) (Vernon 2008).  The statute also provides that the\r\nremedy of contempt is available to enforce such orders. <i>Id</i>.  The Family Code also\r\nprovides that in a suit affecting the parent-child relationship, the court may render\r\njudgment for reasonable attorney’s fees and that such judgments may be enforced by\r\nany means available for the enforcement of a judgment for a debt.  <i>Id</i>. § 106.002 (a),\r\n(b) (Vernon 2008).  Article 1, section 18 of the Texas Constitution prohibits\r\nimprisonment of a person for debt, thereby ruling out contempt-ordered confinement\r\nas a means to enforce a judgment for debt.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex. Const.</span> Art. 1, § 18.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In the instant case, the trial court found Ron in contempt for violations relating\r\nto child support, possession, non-compliance with injunctions, and non-compliance\r\nwith terms governing the child’s medical care.  Without evidence segregating the\r\nattorney’s fees in accordance with the legal work that went toward establishing the\r\nvarious types of violations, the trial court awarded Sheri a judgment for attorney’s\r\nfees, expenses, and costs in the amount of $18,923 and provided that she could\r\nenforce it by any means available for the enforcement of a judgment for debt.  Later\r\nin the enforcement order, the trial court makes the payment of the judgment by a date\r\ncertain one of the conditions of suspension of Ron’s commitment to jail and further\r\nprovides that the judgment may be enforced by any means available for the\r\nenforcement of child support, including contempt.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Ron asserts it was error for the trial court to provide in a condition of\r\nsupervision that the attorney’s fees judgment is enforceable by contempt when\r\nportions of it are allocable to items like establishing non-compliance with injunctions,\r\nwhich under section 106.002 of the Family Code would be enforceable only by means\r\nto collect a judgment for debt and not by contempt.  We agree.  <i>See Kogel v.\r\nRobertson</i>, No. 03-04-00246, 2005 Tex. App. LEXIS 10028, at *29-31 (Tex.\r\nApp.—Austin December 2, 2005, no pet.) (mem. op.) (holding that trial court erred\r\nby characterizing attorney’s fees as “in the nature of child support,” impermissibly\r\nsubjecting Kogel to fine or confinement for failure to pay debt because indeterminate\r\nportion of attorney’s fees were for modification suit, fees which are enforceable only\r\nin non-contempt ways to enforce  judgment for debt).  We sustain issue 10.  From the\r\ncommunity supervision section of the body of the enforcement order, we strike from\r\nparagraph three the sentence, “IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the attorney’s\r\nfees and costs awarded herein may be enforced by any means available for the\r\nenforcement of child support including contempt, but not including income\r\nwithholding.”</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>CONCLUSION</span> </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>We concur with the following sentiments of our sister San Antonio Court of\r\nAppeals in another family law case,<i> A.M.</i>, 974 S.W.2d at 867:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>This is a difficult case.  The trial court’s attempt to look after the needs\r\nand concerns of the [child] is commendable and correct in intent. \r\nHowever, the cornerstones of our judicial system are notice and a fair\r\nhearing.</span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span>In some ways, however, Ron received neither.  </span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Accordingly, to summarize, from the December 17, 2008 enforcement order,\r\nwe strike as void the provisions modifying conservatorship and possession provisions\r\nof the trial court’s prior orders; the trial court’s contempt findings in violation 7 (Ron\r\nput the child on Straterra), 9-11 (refusal to give the child medication), 12-27 (removal\r\nof child from school or failure to take child to school); and violations 56-113 (failure\r\nto pay child and medical support).  From the probation/community supervision\r\nprovisions of the enforcement order, we strike as void the provisions modifying\r\nconservatorship and possession provisions of the trial court’s prior orders, the\r\nprovisions requiring Ron to pay a child support arrearage of $1,264.79 by a date\r\ncertain, the provisions relative to Ron’s reporting to the CSO, the provision that\r\ncommunity supervision would end upon Ron’s payment of all child support\r\narrearages, and the provision that the attorney’s fees and costs judgment of $18,923\r\nmay be enforced by any means available for the enforcement of child support,\r\nincluding contempt.

We grant habeas corpus relief\r\nin part and deny it in part. <span>BACKGROUND</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>By a 2003 agreed final decree, the trial court dissolved the marriage of Ron and \r\nreal party in interest, Sheri Dooley (“Sheri”).  The trial court appointed Ron and Sheri\r\njoint managing conservators of their four-year-old son (“the child”) and established\r\norders providing regulation of the parties’ relation with the child in areas of support,\r\naccess, and parental rights and duties.  Over the next several years, discord arose\r\nbetween the parties, generally related to the child’s medical care, and specifically\r\nrelated to whether he had attention deficit disorder (“ADD”), attention deficit\r\nhyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”), or some other condition requiring medication.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>On April 5, 2005, after having found that the parties had an agreement about\r\nthe modification of the decree, the trial court signed an order in a suit to modify\r\nparent-child relationship.  It altered Ron and Sheri’s rights on medical decisions to\r\ninclude an arbitrator for disagreements between them; provided that the parents\r\ncommunicate by email; modified the parties’ periods, terms, and conditions of\r\npossession; and established a permanent injunction intended to regulate their\r\ncommunications and their administration of prescription medication to the child. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>On April 19, 2006, the trial court signed another order in a suit for modification\r\nof support and to confirm support arrearage.  The trial court found that the parties had\r\nagreed to the entry of orders that modified Ron’s monthly child and medical support\r\nobligations and ordered him to pay child and medical support judgments by June 1,\r\n2006.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Finally, on July 21, 2006, the trial court signed a third modification order,\r\n“Agreed Final Order Modifying Prior Order in Suit Affecting Parent-Child\r\nRelationship.”  It established a plan for the evaluation and subsequent treatment of\r\nthe child for ADD/ADHD, other medical conditions, and dental work.  It enjoined the\r\nparties from unnecessarily removing the child from school; enjoined Ron, for 40\r\nmonths, from filing for additional modifications; and addressed alleged child support\r\narrearages.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>On September 26, 2008, Sheri sought enforcement of the prior orders, asserting\r\nthat on over 140 occasions, Ron had violated all three prior modification orders.  The\r\ntrial court heard the petition, and on December 17, 2008, in its enforcement order,\r\nfound Ron in contempt of its prior orders in 110 instances.  For each instance of\r\ncontempt, as punishment, the trial court assessed Ron a punishment of six months\r\nconfinement and a $500 fine, the punitive sentences to run concurrently.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Having found that “the child has been destroyed particularly by his father,” as\r\nadditional relief, the trial court gave Sheri exclusive right to consent to invasive\r\nmedical and dental procedures for the child, as well as all psychological and\r\npsychiatric treatment for the child until he turned 18.  It ordered that Ron’s periods\r\nof possession and all access to the child be supervised at all times and that his\r\novernight periods of possession be eliminated.  Additionally, the trial court awarded\r\nSheri a child support arrearage judgment of $1,264.79 and an $18,923 judgment for\r\nattorney’s fees, expenses, and costs, plus interest.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>The trial court ordered Ron’s confinement to be probated for a period of nine\r\nyears, with Ron placed on community supervision, provided that he abide by various\r\nterms and conditions, including those on an attached, three-page “Exhibit ‘A’ Terms\r\nand Conditions of Community Supervision.”  Subsequently, Ron petitioned this Court\r\nfor habeas corpus relief, attacking all but four of the trial court’s contempt findings\r\nand various of its other provisions (including numerous of its probation/conditions\r\nof community supervision provisions).</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>ANALYSIS</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Availability of Habeas Corpus Review</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Ron is not physically confined in jail because the trial court has suspended his\r\ncommitment and placed him on community supervision.  Under the terms and\r\nconditions of the suspension of commitment and community supervision, however,\r\nRon must, among other things, report to a community supervision officer (CSO), as\r\nspecified by the CSO; permit the CSO to visit Ron at Ron’s home or elsewhere, as\r\ndeemed appropriate by the CSO; participate in employment assistance, as directed by\r\nthe CSO; complete referrals or counseling on a variety of topics, as ordered by the\r\ntrial court or directed by the CSO; no longer have overnight periods of possession\r\nwith the child; and, if he exercises periods of possession and access to the child, do\r\nso under the supervision of a third party.  The parties dispute whether, under the\r\nDecember 17, 2008 enforcement order, the trial court has illegally restrained Ron so\r\nas to entitle him to habeas corpus review.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>To qualify for habeas corpus relief from a court of appeals, a person must be\r\n“restrained in his liberty . . . when it appears that the restraint of liberty is by virtue\r\nof an order, process, or commitment issued by a court or judge because of the\r\nviolation of an order, judgment, or decree previously made, rendered or entered by\r\nthe court or judge in a civil case.<span>  Tex.

The\r\ndistinctions Sheri attempts to draw between <i>Brister</i> and <i>Duncan</i> and this case are not\r\nsignificant inasmuch as in holding that Brister and Duncan were sufficiently\r\nrestrained to qualify for habeas corpus relief, the reviewing courts in those cases also\r\nreferred to requirements to report to CSO’s, a factor also present in Ron’s probation\r\nterms and conditions.

This case is distinguishable\r\nfrom <i>Boyle</i>.  In <i>Boyle</i>, Boyle contended that the order of commitment was void\r\nbecause it required him to pay attorney’s fees when his former spouse had not\r\nrequested attorney’s fees in her motion for contempt.  <i>Id</i>. at 28.  In rejecting that\r\ncomplaint, we noted that the contempt proceeding was brought pursuant to former\r\nTexas Rule of Civil Procedure 308-A,</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  which provided that the attorney representing\r\nthe child support obligee should file with the clerk of the court a written statement,\r\nverified by the affidavit of the child support claimant, describing the child support\r\nobligor’s claimed disobedience of the trial court’s child support order. <i> Id</i>.  We noted\r\nparticularly, that former Rule 308-A went on to provide that “‘no further written\r\npleadings shall be required.’”<span> </span><i>Id</i>.  We also noted that  the attorney for the movant\r\nasked for attorney’s fees during the case.  <i>Id</i>.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In contrast, the instant case is brought pursuant to Texas Family Code\r\nAnnotated, § 157.002 (Vernon 2008) with stronger pleading requirements than those\r\nof former Rule 308-A.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  Additionally, unlike in <i>Boyle</i>, in which at trial, Boyle’s\r\nformer wife requested the attorney’s fees not pleaded for, here, Sheri, during the\r\nhearing, did not ask for the trial court’s prior conservatorship and possession orders\r\nto be modified in the way the trial court provided in its enforcement order.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Regarding Sheri’s assertion that Ron had knowledge that she was asking the\r\ncourt to alter his periods of possession, his knowledge was limited to paragraph 14\r\nof her amended petition for enforcement, which asked only for his weekday\r\npossession schedule to be “<i>suspended</i> . . . until RONALD SANNER is in full\r\ncompliance with the Court’s orders.” <span>(</span>Emphasis added.)  This pleading did not put\r\nhim on notice that the court would consider, for the duration of the child’s childhood,\r\naltering Ron’s medical, dental, and psychological consultation rights; <i>terminating</i><span> </span>his\r\novernight periods of possession; requiring all his visitation to be supervised; and the\r\nother conservatorship and possession modifications that the court made.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Regarding Sheri’s assertion that after objecting in his answer to Sheri’s\r\nrequested relief of suspension of his weekday possession schedule, Ron went through\r\nthe trial and made no further objection to alteration of the trial court’s prior\r\nconservatorship and possession orders, it was not until after he had rested and the trial\r\ncourt rendered its judgment that he learned of the unpleaded-for relief that the trial\r\ncourt ordered.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Finally, Sheri’s assertion that Ron had notice because she proffered an exhibit\r\noutlining the relief that she was requesting, which included a request to limit Ron’s\r\naccess to the child, is without merit.  An examination of the reporter’s record shows\r\nthat during Sheri’s counsel’s testimony on attorney’s fees, she made a brief reference\r\nto an Exhibit 2 “on relief requested,” but that it was not tendered to Ron’s counsel,\r\nnor did the trial court admit it into evidence. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>We sustain Ron’s first issue and grant the alternative relief that he requested\r\nunder it as follows.  We strike from body of the enforcement order, as well as the\r\nattached conditions of probation, those provisions that award to Sheri the exclusive\r\nright to consent for the child to invasive medical and dental treatment and to his\r\npsychological care.  We likewise strike those provisions that<span> </span>modify Ron’s periods\r\nof possession with the child and the conditions under which the trial court specified\r\nthat they should be exercised.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Clarity of Underlying Orders Sought to be Enforced</span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span></span>In issues two, three, and seven, Ron asserts that the underlying orders sought\r\nto be enforced are not sufficiently specific to be enforced by contempt.</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span><span>A.

Unauthorized Doctors and Medication</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In issue two, Ron asserts that enforcement order is void with respect to\r\nviolations 3, 5, and 7 because the terms of the underlying order were not sufficiently\r\nspecific to be enforced by contempt.  In violations 3 and 5, the trial court found that\r\nRon took the child to see doctors who had not been recommended by the Texas\r\nChildren’s Hospital Learning Support Center (“TCHLSC”)—Dr. Barton in 2008 and\r\nDr. Young in 2007.  In violation 7, the trial court found that Ron put the child on\r\n“Strattera as prescribed by Dr. Tran, a medication other than the Adderall\r\nrecommended by the child’s current doctor, which interferes with the child’s\r\nmedication prescribed by his current doctor.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>These violations are based on the following language in the July 21, 2006\r\nAgreed Final Order Modifying Prior Order in Suit Affecting the Parent-Child\r\nRelationship:</span></p>\r\n<p><span><i><span><span>          </span>ADD/ADHD Evaluation</span></i></span></p>\r\n<p><span>The parties agree and IT IS THERFORE ORDERED that the\r\nchild, [name], shall be evaluated at Texas Children’s Hospital Learning\r\nSupport Center for ADD/ADHD, or any other condition the child might\r\nhave, and with respect to any medication, if any, necessary for any such\r\nconditions found.  It is ORDERED that all costs associated with the\r\nevaluation(s) shall be processed through . . . . It is ORDERED that all\r\ncurrent treatment of the child shall remain unchanged until the\r\nevaluation(s) has been performed and completed.  The parties are\r\nORDERED to follow all recommendations of existing doctors.</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span>IT IS FURTHER AGREED AND THEREFORE ORDERED that\r\nthe Texas Children’s Hospital Learning Support Center evaluation and\r\nrecommendation shall be controlling on all issues pertaining to the child\r\nhaving, or not having as the case may be, ADD/ADHD and the need for\r\nany medication related thereto.  IT IS ORDERED that both parties . . . \r\nare enjoined from taking the child to any other psychologist,\r\npsychiatrist, therapist or medical professionals related to these health\r\nissues unless Texas Children’s Hospital Learning Support Center\r\nrecommends the child to see an outside provider except the child’s\r\ncurrent treating doctors.  Each party is ordered to cooperate [in]. . . \r\nevaluations of the child . . . .  Nothing in this order shall be interpreted\r\nto prohibit the child from seeing other medical health professionals\r\nreferred by Dr. Muzumdar for other medical issues.

Ron also asserts that since the\r\ndate of the signing of the agreed final order, TCHLSC recommendations have not\r\nbeen incorporated into any written court order.   </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>While those assertions are true, Exhibit 12 to the reporter’s record shows that\r\nTCHLSC made its evaluation of the child and written recommendations less than a\r\nmonth later, on August 14, 2006, with Ron as a copied recipient.  In them, TCHLSC\r\nmade no recommendations that the child see Dr. Young or Dr. Barton.  On cross-examination, Sheri’s counsel asked Ron if TCHLSC had recommended Dr. Young,\r\nto which, Ron responded, “[N]o.”  This indicates that Ron was familiar with\r\nTCHLSC’s recommendations and their contents.  Sheri testified, without\r\ncontradiction, that neither Dr. Barton nor Dr. Young were recommended by\r\nTCHLSC.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In his petition, Ron contends that  Sheri offered no evidence to show that Dr.\r\nYoung and Dr. Barton did not come under the “current treating doctors” exception\r\nto the injunction prohibiting taking the child to non-TCHLSC recommended doctors. \r\nThis is not accurate, however.  Exhibit 9, the business records of Cornerstone\r\nPsychiatry, contain documents showing that Ron took the child to see Doctor Young\r\nfor the first time in 2007 and Dr. Barton for the first time in 2008. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>With respect to violations 3 and 5, the injunction prohibiting the child’s parents\r\nfrom taking the child to see non-TCHLSC recommended doctors is clear.  It does not\r\nrest on implication or conjecture and is not susceptible to more than one meaning,\r\nmeeting a test for clarity announced in <i>Acker</i>.  <i>See Acker</i>, 949 S.W.2d at 317.  Ron’s\r\ntestimony that TCHLSC did not recommend Dr. Young is additional evidence that\r\nRon understood the injunction. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Regarding violation 7, the July 21, 2006 order, under the ADD/ADHD\r\nEvaluation section, provides that until TCHLSC’s evaluation or evaluations are done,\r\nthe current treatment of the child should remain unchanged, but that, thereafter,\r\nTCHLSC’s, ADD/ADHD medication recommendation would control.  TCHLSC’s\r\nrecommendation regarding AD/HD medication was that “continued medication\r\ntreatment is warranted,” but that it should be monitored for efficacy at least annually. \r\nThe language of this recommendation is vague in that it does not specify a particular\r\nmedication.  Such a recommendation could be construed to support continued use of\r\nAdderall, but would not preclude the use of Straterra, which the child’s AD/HD\r\ndoctor, Dr. Rosenberg, testified that he had discussed  with Ron before the summer\r\nof 2008.  Because July 21, 2006 order made the TCHLSC’s AD/HD medication\r\nrecommendation controlling, but the recommendation itself was susceptible of more\r\nthan one meaning, we hold that it was not sufficiently specific to support enforcement\r\nas found by the trial court in violation 7.

Refusal to Administer Medication</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In issue three, Ron asserts that the language of the April 5, 2005 Order in Suit\r\nto Modify Parent Child Relationship is too vague to be enforced as stated in\r\nviolations 9, 10, and 11 of the enforcement order.  In violations 9, 10, and 11 of the\r\nenforcement order, the trial court found that on three different occasions, during a\r\nperiod of his possession of the child that, Ron “refused to give the child medication.” \r\nThe language sought to be enforced provides that: “IT IS ORDERED that RONALD\r\nJAMES SANNER AND SHERI RENEE DOOLEY are permanently enjoined from:\r\n. . . Removing the child from, stopping the child from, or preventing the child from\r\ntaking any medication prescribed for the child.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Ron contends that the way the order is written, there is nothing that\r\naffirmatively obligates him to administer the medication to the child and that as long\r\nas he did nothing to prevent the child from taking the medication, his conduct is not\r\nsusceptible to a contempt finding.  We agree.  The order sought to be enforced did not\r\norder Ron to give the child medication.  Because the trial court’s findings in\r\nviolations 9, 10, and 11 found Ron guilty of contempt for not performing specific acts\r\nthat he was not ordered by the court to do, they must fail.  <i>See Ex parte Hodges</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1770776\"><a href=\"/opinion/1770776/ex-parte-hodges/\"><span class=\"volume\">625</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span>, 306 (Tex. 1981) (holding invalid trial court findings that Hodges was in\r\ncontempt for not turning over to receiver certain company records and for refusing\r\nto permit receiver to take physical inventory of company when order sought to be\r\nenforced did not order Hodges to turn over company records or to permit receiver to\r\ntake physical inventory of company).  We sustain issue three and strike violations 9,\r\n10, and 11 from the enforcement order.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span><span>D.  Making Disparaging Remarks</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In issue seven, Ron asserts that violations 36-54 of the enforcement order are\r\nvoid because they are based on an injunctive order that is vague or is an\r\nunconstitutional infringement on his right to free speech.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>The trial court’s April 5, 2005 Order in Suit to Modify Parent-Child\r\nRelationship contains a permanent injunction based on the findings that (1) the parties\r\nhad entered into an agreement regarding the modification and that the agreement was\r\nin the best interest of the child and (2) that because of the conduct of the parties, a\r\npermanent injunction should be granted for appropriate relief, said injunction being\r\nin the best interest of the child.   The trial court’s order then enjoins both parties from\r\n“Making or permitting to be made any disparaging remarks concerning the other\r\nparty, their respective families, or this litigation.”  In the enforcement order, the trial\r\ncourt found that in emails that Ron had sent to Sheri, he had violated this order 19\r\ntimes.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Ron contends that the injunctive order in question is not specific enough to be\r\nenforced.  Ron gives the dictionary definition of “disparage” as “to speak slightingly\r\nabout.”  To this could be added, to “depreciate, belittle”; “to bring reproach or\r\ndiscredit upon.”  <i>Random House Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary</i> 567 (2d ed.\r\n2001).  Ron then asserts that this definition presumes that the statements are being\r\nmade about someone to a third person.  Ron argues that he sent the emails to Sheri\r\nand no one else and that Sheri’s interpretation of the underlying order would permit\r\nher to assert that every remark Ron makes to her should be considered disparaging\r\nbased on her own sensibilities, while they were not necessarily intended as such.  \r\nThis overlooks the fact that when Sheri brings a charge in a motion to enforce that\r\nRon has violated the order by making a disparaging remark that the trial court\r\nevaluates the alleged disparaging remark to determine whether it is disparaging. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>With reference to his free speech contention, Ron asserts that because the\r\ninjunction does not limit the prohibition of making disparaging remarks about each\r\nother, their families, and the litigation to such remarks made to the child or in its\r\npresence, the injunction could apply to statements made to a co-worker or to a\r\ntherapist.  We note that there is no evidence in the record of such circumstances. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>To support his contention that the injunction is void as an unconstitutional\r\ninfringement on his right to free speech, Ron cites <i>Grigsby v. Coker</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1523551\"><a href=\"/opinion/1523551/grigsby-v-coker/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span>\r\n(Tex. 1995) and <i>Davenport v.

These cases are\r\ndistinguishable from the instant case.  Both <i>Grigsby</i> and <i>Davenport</i> deal with “gag\r\norders,” pre-trial orders issued by judges to the parties not to discuss imminent\r\nlitigation outside the court, <i>see Davenport</i>, 834 S.W.2d at 6 and <i>Grigsby</i>, 904 S.W.2d\r\nat 620, designed to prevent imminent and  irreparable harm to the judicial process that\r\nwould deprive litigants of a just resolution of their soon-to-be-tried dispute.  <i>See\r\nDavenport</i>, 834 S.W.2d at 10.  In contrast, in the instant case, the injunction in the\r\norder sought to be enforced was not made on the <i>eve</i> of trial to protect its outcome. \r\nRather it was made <i>after</i> a trial of a motion to modify resulting in findings that (1) the\r\nparties had entered into an agreement regarding the requested modification, which\r\nwas in the best interest of the child and (2) because of the conduct of the parties, a\r\npermanent injunction should be granted for appropriate relief, said injunction being\r\nin the best interest of the child.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>We conclude that Ron has not carried his burden to show that he is entitled to\r\nhabeas corpus relief with respect to issue seven.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Notice to Ron of Way Prior Order Violated</span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In issues four, five, and six, Ron asserts that enumerated violations of prior\r\norders as found by the trial court in its enforcement order are void because they do\r\nnot state the manner in which Ron violated the court’s prior order.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span><span>A.

We agree.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>The trial court findings in violations 12-27 do not constitute violations of the\r\nJuly 21, 2006 modification order sought to be enforced.  The language in that order\r\nprovides as follows: </span></p>\r\n<p><span>IT IS ORDERED that Petitioner and Respondent are hereby\r\npermanently enjoined from:</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span>(1) Removing the child from the school or causing the child to\r\nmiss school for any purpose other than for a illness or for medical\r\nappointments for which advanced notification has been provided to both\r\nparties in writing, or has been recommended by Dr. Muzumdar when the\r\nparties have been unable to reach an agreement . . . .</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span>IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that neither party shall remove the child\r\nfrom school for any purpose other than if the child is ill, or for a\r\nscheduled appointment agreed to by the parties or recommended by Dr.\r\nMuzumdar, or otherwise agreed to by the parties with respect to the\r\nspecific absence.</span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span>The language of paragraph “(1)” prohibits the parties from removing the child from\r\nschool or causing him to miss school, except in cases of (1) the child’s illness, (2)\r\nmedical appointments for the child for which either of the parties has provided\r\nadvanced written notification to the other of the appointment, and (3) medical\r\nappointments recommended by Dr. Muzumdar when the parties have been unable to\r\nreach an agreement.  The last paragraph set out also prohibits the parties from\r\nremoving the child from school except in cases of (4) scheduled appointments agreed\r\nto by the parties, (5) scheduled appointments recommended by Dr. Muzumdar, or (6)\r\nscheduled appointments otherwise agreed to by the parties with respect to the specific\r\nabsence.  These possibilities do not create a general obligation on the parties’ part to\r\nnotify each other when they remove the child from school or cause the child to miss\r\nschool.  Nevertheless, in violations 12-27, when the trial court found Ron’s\r\npurportedly contemptuous conduct as removing the child from school early without\r\nnotice to Sheri or the child absent from school without notice to Sheri, it convicted\r\nhim of violating such a non-existent general obligation of notice to Sheri.  This is\r\nakin to convicting a person of a crime on the basis of conduct that does not constitute\r\nthe crime, which offends the basic notion of justice and fair play embodied in the\r\nUnited States Constitution.  <i>Hammock v.

Refusal to Return Child to Sheri’s Residence as Ordered</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In issue six, Ron asserts that violations 28-33 of the enforcement order are void\r\nbecause they fail to state the manner in which Ron violated the trial court’s April 5,\r\n2005 modification order.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>The April 5, 2005 modification order provides that Ron is to return the child\r\nto Sheri’s residence at the end of each period of possession, but if a period of Ron’s\r\npossession ends at the time the child’s school resumes, he is to surrender the child to\r\nSheri at the child’s school.  This order also contains a provision that when they return\r\nthe child, the parties are also to return the personal effects that the child brought at\r\nthe beginning of the period of possession.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In violations 28-33, the trial court found Ron guilty of separate acts of\r\ncontempt, which are each expressed as follows: “The parties continue to reside in the\r\nsame county and Ronald Sanner refused to return the child to the residence of Sheri\r\nDooley as ordered on [specified date].”  Ron argues that these violations do not\r\nspecify the manner in which Ron failed to comply because the way they are\r\nexpressed, they could include Ron’s failure to return the child at a designated time or\r\nlocation or his failure to return the child with all his belongings.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Here, however, the corresponding allegations in Sheri’s enforcement motion,\r\nwhich Ron received, mentioned only Ron’s refusal to return the child to Sheri’s\r\nresidence, mentioning nothing about Ron’s delivering the child late or without his\r\npersonal effects.  In Sheri’s testimony, in response to her counsel’s question regarding\r\nwhat violations 28-33 deal with, Sheri responded that they had to do with the fact that\r\nRon did not bring the child back to her home.  Ron’s testimony on this subject also\r\nfocused on the place the child was surrendered, mentioning nothing about the child’s\r\npersonal effects and discussing a late surrender in only one of the six instances.  The\r\nrecord does not show that Ron was confused about the trial court’s rendition of\r\njudgment on these violations.  We hold that the interpretation of violations 28-33 as\r\nbeing one that Ron refused to return the child to Sheri’s residence, without reference\r\nto the time that the child was returned or whether he was returned with his personal\r\nbelongings, does not require inferences or conclusions about which reasonable\r\npersons might differ.  We further hold that violation 28-33 of the enforcement order\r\nnotify Ron of the  manner in which he violated the court’s April 5, 2005 modification\r\norder and that it provides sufficient information for an adequate review.  <i>See Turner</i>,\r\n177 S.W.3d at 289 (quoting <i>Conoly</i>, 732 S.W.2d at 697). </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Ron argues that Sheri has waived her right to enforce this right to have the\r\nchild delivered to her residence because she and Ron have established a pattern of\r\nsurrendering the child at a neutral spot.  The Texas Supreme Court has referred to\r\nwaiver as a “voluntary relinquishment of a known right.”  <i>Motor Veh. Bd. of the Tex.\r\nDep’t. of Transp. v. El Paso Indep. Auto.

Sheri’s testimony on this matter is that she and Ron do not have an\r\nagreement to meet in the middle between their residences to surrender the child and\r\nthat it has developed that way because “[Ron’s] told me pretty much I have to meet\r\nhim there or I don’t see my child.”  This is evidence that Sheri has not voluntarily\r\nrelinquished the rights provided in the modification order to have Ron deliver the\r\nchild to her residence.  We hold that Ron has not carried his burden to show that he\r\nis entitled to habeas corpus relief for violations 28-33 on the basis of waiver.

As a reviewing court, we may determine only if the trial\r\ncourt’s contempt findings are so completely without evidentiary support that the trial\r\ncourt’s judgment is void because it deprives a relator of liberty without due process\r\nof law.  <i>In re Pruitt</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2277125\"><a href=\"/opinion/2277125/in-re-pruitt/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">363</span></a></span>, 364 (Tex.

We agree.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Sheri testified that Ron is ordered to pay child support of $475 a month, which\r\nstarted in June 2006, but she gave no testimony regarding what day of the month the\r\npayment is due.  Similarly, regarding medical support, Sheri testified that Ron is\r\nordered to pay her $63 a month, without specifying the day of the month on which it\r\nis due.  Sheri testified that violation 56 is Ron’s failure to pay child support and\r\nmedical premium reimbursement, but she did not testify the date it was due.\r\nRegarding violations 57-113, Sheri offered no testimony of the day that the violations\r\noccurred or the amount that Ron paid or did not pay on the due dates.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Sheri introduced into evidence Exhibit 10, a computer print-out from the Harris\r\nCounty Child Support System showing the dates and amounts of Ron’s support\r\npayments since 2003.  It does not, however, list the child support payments that Ron\r\nfailed to pay, the amount that he failed to pay, or the dates that he failed to make\r\nthem.  Our sister court, the Fourteenth Court of Appeals, has held such a print-out,\r\nattached as a contempt order exhibit, to be legally inadequate to show the way in\r\nwhich the relator had contemptuously disobeyed the underlying order.  <i>See In re\r\nNesevitch</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1891462\"><a href=\"/opinion/1891462/in-re-nesevitch/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span>, 513 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, orig.\r\nproceeding).  The Fourteenth Court of Appeals held the print-out to be legally\r\ninadequate for that purpose because it did not contain the dates that the support\r\npayments were due and the amounts relator paid or did not pay on those due dates. \r\n<i>Id</i>.  Similarly, in this case, we hold that Exhibit 10 provides no evidence to support\r\nviolations 56-113 in Sheri’s enforcement motion.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Sheri argues that the trial court took judicial notice of the orders at issue and \r\nthe payment history, combined them, and derived the evidence necessary to support\r\nthe violations in its enforcement order.  Sheri does not provide a cite to the place in\r\nthe record where the trial court took judicial notice of the order in issue.  Because\r\nthey are supported by no evidence, we hold violations 56-113 to be void. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Under this issue, Ron also complains that the enforcement order lacks\r\nsufficient clarity to be enforced because of ambiguity relative to the trial court’s\r\ncalculation of the amount of child and medical support arrearage.  Ron contends that \r\nto the extent that his liberty depends on compliance with conditions of probation\r\ninvolving his payment of the arrearage that the trial court found in the enforcement\r\norder, the enforcement order should be declared void. We agree.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>When the amounts shown for violations 56-113 in the “Amount Due” column\r\nof the enforcement order are added, the total comes to $15,036, but the enforcement\r\norder shows the total of that column to be $17,184.  When the amounts  in the\r\n“Amount Paid” for those violations are added, the total comes to $14,000, but the\r\nenforcement order shows the total for that column to be $16,700.  If $14,000 is\r\nsubtracted from $15,036, the resulting amount of arrearage would be $1,036.  In the\r\nenforcement order, however, the trial court shows an arrearage of $1,264.79, arrived\r\nat by subtracting $16,700 from $17,184 to get $484, to which it adds $631.95 from\r\na previous child support judgment, $90.69 from a previous medical support judgment,\r\nand $58.15 as interest.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In her response brief, Sheri concedes the erroneous calculation of the arrearage\r\nin the enforcement order as an attempt to match it to the $1,264.79 total arrearage to\r\nwhich she testified.  Citing <i>In re Patillo</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2187865\"><a href=\"/opinion/2187865/in-re-patillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">907</span></a></span>, 910 (Tex. App.—Corpus\r\nChristi 2000, orig. proceeding), Sheri contends that the error can be remedied by\r\nreformation of the enforcement order.  In <i>Patillo</i>, the court of appeals was able to\r\nreform the civil coercive confinement provision of the enforcement order from\r\nconfinement until Patillo paid a total arrearage of $44,081, to confinement until he\r\npaid $10,150, the amount for which Patillo had actually been held in contempt for not\r\npaying. <i>Id</i>. at 909-10.  Here, because we have held that the child/medical support\r\nviolations (56-113) to be void, we do not have the information necessary to do a\r\nreformation such as was done in <i>Patillo</i>.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Also impairing the ability to reform the arrearage are additional ambiguities in\r\nthe record.  Sheri testified that she had calculated each of the pages on Exhibit 10 and\r\nthat Ron was in arrears in the amount of $1,264.79.  She testified that this was broken\r\ndown into $956.02 for child support and $300.78 for medical premium\r\nreimbursement. (Id. l. 14-16) When these are added, however, they do not total\r\n$1,264.79.  Additionally, Sheri testified that Ron was obligated to reimburse her $63\r\nper month for medical expenses, a figure that she presumably used to arrive at her\r\narrearage calculation.  Yet, the order in question, provided as part of the instant\r\nhabeas record, shows the amount ordered to be $62 per month. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Ron asserts that to the extent that he has been ordered to pay Sheri the\r\narrearage by a date certain as part of his probationary terms in the enforcement order\r\nand in its Exhibit A, or risk incarceration, the enforcement order should be declared\r\nvoid.  We agree and strike these two provisions from the enforcement order as void\r\nfor being in derogation of Ron’s due process right to notice of the way in which he\r\nhas violated the order sought to be enforced. <i> Slavin</i>, 412 S.W.2d. at 45 (“‘Where the\r\ncourt seeks to punish either by fine, arrest or imprisonment for the disobedience of\r\nan order or command, such order or command must carry with it no uncertainty, and\r\nmust not be susceptible of different meanings or constructions . . . .’”) (quoting <i>Ex\r\nparte Duncan</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">758</span></span> (Tex. Crim. App. 1901)). </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>We sustain issue eight.  We strike from the enforcement order violations 56-113, the attendant arrearage sums, and the conditions of probation that Ron pay a\r\nchild support arrearage of $1,264.79.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Clarity of Terms of Probation</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In issue nine, Ron contends that the enforcement order is void because the\r\nterms for probation are not sufficiently specific or they directly conflict with one\r\nanother.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Ron first asserts that there is a conflict in terms regarding his periods of\r\npossession of the child.  The first term of community supervision within the body of\r\nthe enforcement order requires that Ron comply with the terms of possession and\r\naccess to the child as stated in the body of the enforcement order.  Ron then points to\r\nthe first term of Exhibit A, attached to the enforcement order, which requires him to\r\ncomply with the terms and conditions of possession and access to the child as ordered\r\nin the enforcement order and the April 5, 2005 Order in Suit to Modify Parent-Child\r\nRelationship.  Under our earlier disposition of issue one, we struck the possession and\r\naccess provisions in the enforcement order.  Therefore, if there was a conflict between\r\nthe possession and access provisions of the enforcement order and those of the April\r\n5, 2005 order, it no longer exists.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Next, Ron asserts that there is a conflict between the fourth community\r\nsupervision provision in the body of the enforcement order that requires him to report\r\nto the CSO as specified by the CSO and the provision in Exhibit A that requires him\r\nto report to the CSO immediately after the hearing and at least once each month\r\nthereafter or each week if not employed full time.  In her response, Sheri implies that\r\nthese provisions are not in conflict.  She asserts that the provision in Exhibit A sets\r\nthe general parameters for the frequency of Ron’s reporting to the CSO, while the\r\nfourth term in the body of the enforcement order simply gives the CSO flexibility\r\nwithin the general parameters to specify the exact time and date for the meetings. \r\nThis is one interpretation, but these provisions could also be interpreted as requiring\r\nthat Ron meet with the CSO monthly if he is employed and weekly if he is\r\nunemployed, as well as to meet with the CSO whenever the CSO specifies, even if\r\nmore frequently than monthly or weekly.  Because the interpretation of such\r\nprovisions requires inferences or conclusions about which reasonable persons might\r\ndiffer, they are of insufficient clarity to apprise Ron of what he must do to avoid\r\nlosing his liberty and, therefore, are unconstitutionally vague.  <i>See Houston</i>, 92\r\nS.W.3d at 877 (holding that a contempt order is insufficient if its interpretation\r\nrequires inferences or conclusions about which reasonable persons might differ).  We\r\nstrike these provisions from the enforcement order.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Ron asserts that there is also a conflict in the probationary provisions regarding\r\nthe duration of the probation. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Within the body of the enforcement order, the trial court provides:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that commitment is suspended and\r\nRespondent placed on community supervision <i>for a period of 9 years</i> on\r\nthe following terms and conditions:</span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span>(Emphasis added.)  On page one of Exhibit A, “Terms and Conditions of Community\r\nSupervision” to the enforcement order, the trial court provides:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>This Exhibit is incorporated in the Judgment of Contempt for all\r\npurposes as ordered by this Court.  The Court suspends the commitment\r\nand orders that RONALD SANNER hereinafter referred to as\r\nRespondent, is placed on community supervision <i>for a period of nine\r\nyears</i> . . . .</span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span>On page three of Exhibit A, “Terms and Conditions of Community Supervision for\r\nNonpayment of Child Support” to the enforcement order, however, the trial court\r\nprovides:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>This Exhibit is incorporated into the Judgment of Contempt for all\r\npurposes as ordered by this Court.  The Court suspends the commitment\r\nand orders that Ronald Sanner, Respondent, is placed on community\r\nsupervision through the HARRIS COUNTY DOMESTIC RELATIONS\r\nOFFICE (DRO).  <i>The term of community supervision is 9 yrs. from the\r\ndate of this order OR until all child support arrearages are paid,\r\nwhichever occurs first, as determined by the Community Supervision\r\nOfficer.</i></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span>(Emphasis added.)</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>The first two provisions prescribe an unconditional 9-year duration for the\r\nprobationary period, whereas the last one can be interpreted that if Ron pays the child\r\nsupport arrearage at any time and it is confirmed by the CSO, Ron is released from\r\nthe probationary conditions, which otherwise suspend his commitment.  Sheri\r\nresponds that it is clear from the record that the trial court’s ruling and intent are that\r\nthe term of the community supervision operate until the child becomes eighteen.  She\r\nasserts that if there is a conflict, the remedy is for this Court to reform it.  We agree.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>At the conclusion of the hearing, in the course of its rendition, the trial court\r\nstated as follows:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Court: Rules of probation and this child is nine years of age.  Rules of\r\nprobation last for the next nine years until the child is 18.</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span>Counsel for Ron: I’m sorry.  I didn’t get that.</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span>Court: Instead of ten years of probation, that would not be appropriate\r\nbecause the Court will lose jurisdiction over the child when the child\r\nturns 18.  So, these rules of probation are in effect until the child turns\r\n18.</span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span>Nowhere in the course of its rendition did the trial court say anything about\r\ncommunity supervision’s ending upon Ron’s payment of the child support arrearage. \r\nAdditionally, we have already held the trial court’s adjudication of the amount of\r\nchild support arrearage to be erroneous.  We strike from the enforcement order\r\n“Exhibit ‘A,’ Terms and Conditions of Community Supervision for Nonpayment of\r\nChild Support,” page 3, the portion of the provision relative to the duration of\r\ncommunity supervision that provides that community supervision would end upon\r\nRon’s payment of all child support arrearages.  <i>See Felters v. State</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1353198\"><a href=\"/opinion/1353198/felters-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></a></span>,\r\n491-92 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2004, pet. refused) (court of appeals reformed\r\nduration of community supervision from 24 months as incorrectly stated in trial\r\ncourt’s written judgment to 180 days because of trial court’s oral pronouncement of\r\nthat community supervision was to be for 180 days).  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>We sustain issue nine to the extent that we strike the void CSO provisions\r\nregarding when Ron is to report to the CSO and strike the provision that Ron’s\r\ncommunity supervision would end upon his payment of all child support arrearages. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Attorney’s Fees</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In issue 10, Ron asserts that the enforcement order is void because the trial\r\ncourt did not have authority to award the total amount of attorney’s fees as child\r\nsupport.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>The Family Code requires the trial court to award attorney’s fees if it finds that\r\nthe respondent has failed to make child support payments or failed to comply with the\r\nterms of an order providing for the possession of or access to a child.  <span>Tex. Fam.\r\nCode Ann.</span> § 157.167(a), (b) (Vernon 2008).  The statute also provides that the\r\nremedy of contempt is available to enforce such orders. <i>Id</i>.  The Family Code also\r\nprovides that in a suit affecting the parent-child relationship, the court may render\r\njudgment for reasonable attorney’s fees and that such judgments may be enforced by\r\nany means available for the enforcement of a judgment for a debt.  <i>Id</i>. § 106.002 (a),\r\n(b) (Vernon 2008).  Article 1, section 18 of the Texas Constitution prohibits\r\nimprisonment of a person for debt, thereby ruling out contempt-ordered confinement\r\nas a means to enforce a judgment for debt.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex. Const.</span> Art. 1, § 18.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In the instant case, the trial court found Ron in contempt for violations relating\r\nto child support, possession, non-compliance with injunctions, and non-compliance\r\nwith terms governing the child’s medical care.  Without evidence segregating the\r\nattorney’s fees in accordance with the legal work that went toward establishing the\r\nvarious types of violations, the trial court awarded Sheri a judgment for attorney’s\r\nfees, expenses, and costs in the amount of $18,923 and provided that she could\r\nenforce it by any means available for the enforcement of a judgment for debt.  Later\r\nin the enforcement order, the trial court makes the payment of the judgment by a date\r\ncertain one of the conditions of suspension of Ron’s commitment to jail and further\r\nprovides that the judgment may be enforced by any means available for the\r\nenforcement of child support, including contempt.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Ron asserts it was error for the trial court to provide in a condition of\r\nsupervision that the attorney’s fees judgment is enforceable by contempt when\r\nportions of it are allocable to items like establishing non-compliance with injunctions,\r\nwhich under section 106.002 of the Family Code would be enforceable only by means\r\nto collect a judgment for debt and not by contempt.  We agree.  <i>See Kogel v.\r\nRobertson</i>, No. 03-04-00246, 2005 Tex. App. LEXIS 10028, at *29-31 (Tex.\r\nApp.—Austin December 2, 2005, no pet.) (mem. op.) (holding that trial court erred\r\nby characterizing attorney’s fees as “in the nature of child support,” impermissibly\r\nsubjecting Kogel to fine or confinement for failure to pay debt because indeterminate\r\nportion of attorney’s fees were for modification suit, fees which are enforceable only\r\nin non-contempt ways to enforce  judgment for debt).  We sustain issue 10.  From the\r\ncommunity supervision section of the body of the enforcement order, we strike from\r\nparagraph three the sentence, “IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the attorney’s\r\nfees and costs awarded herein may be enforced by any means available for the\r\nenforcement of child support including contempt, but not including income\r\nwithholding.”</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>CONCLUSION</span> </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>We concur with the following sentiments of our sister San Antonio Court of\r\nAppeals in another family law case,<i> A.M.</i>, 974 S.W.2d at 867:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>This is a difficult case.  The trial court’s attempt to look after the needs\r\nand concerns of the [child] is commendable and correct in intent. \r\nHowever, the cornerstones of our judicial system are notice and a fair\r\nhearing.</span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span>In some ways, however, Ron received neither.  </span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Accordingly, to summarize, from the December 17, 2008 enforcement order,\r\nwe strike as void the provisions modifying conservatorship and possession provisions\r\nof the trial court’s prior orders; the trial court’s contempt findings in violation 7 (Ron\r\nput the child on Straterra), 9-11 (refusal to give the child medication), 12-27 (removal\r\nof child from school or failure to take child to school); and violations 56-113 (failure\r\nto pay child and medical support).  From the probation/community supervision\r\nprovisions of the enforcement order, we strike as void the provisions modifying\r\nconservatorship and possession provisions of the trial court’s prior orders, the\r\nprovisions requiring Ron to pay a child support arrearage of $1,264.79 by a date\r\ncertain, the provisions relative to Ron’s reporting to the CSO, the provision that\r\ncommunity supervision would end upon Ron’s payment of all child support\r\narrearages, and the provision that the attorney’s fees and costs judgment of $18,923\r\nmay be enforced by any means available for the enforcement of child support,\r\nincluding contempt.  We leave the remainder of the December 17, 2008 enforcement\r\norder intact.</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>     </span>Sherry Radack</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>     </span>Chief Justice</span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span>Panel consists of Chief Justice Radack and Justices Alcala and Higley.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",
