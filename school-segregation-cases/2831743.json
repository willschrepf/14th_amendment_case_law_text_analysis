Plaintiff-Appellant the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission (“EEOC”) brings this public-enforcement age-discrimination lawsuit\nagainst Defendants-Appellees the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Department, the Kentucky Retirement\nSystems, and the Commonwealth of Kentucky (referred to collectively as “KRS”), alleging that\nKRS’s disability-retirement-benefits plan for state and county employees violates the Age\nDiscrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq., as amended by the Older\nWorkers Benefit Protection Act (“OWBPA”), Pub. Law 101-433, 104 Stat. 978 (1990). The KRS\ndisability-retirement-benefits plan (hereinafter “The KRS plan”) disqualifies employees who are still\nworking from receiving disability-retirement benefits if they have already reached normal\nretirement-benefit age at the time they become disabled. The KRS plan also calculates disability-\nretirement benefits in such a way that an older employee who is eligible to receive disability benefits\nreceives fewer benefits — in the form of lower monthly benefit payments — than a younger disabled\nemployee receiving disability-retirement benefits who is similar to the older disabled employee in\nevery relevant factor other than age.\n        Both the district court and the original panel of this court concluded that pursuant to Lyon\nv. Ohio Education Association and Professional Staff Union, 53 F.3d 135 (6th Cir. 1995), the EEOC\nhad failed to establish a prima facie violation of the ADEA. Lyon concluded that a retirement plan\nthat used age as a factor to determine benefits in a materially indistinguishable manner to the way\nthat age is used in the KRS plan did not establish a prima facie violation of the ADEA despite the\nfact that older workers received lower benefits because of their age. Lyon held that in addition to\ndemonstrating disparate treatment on the basis of age, a plaintiff needed to produce evidence of\ndiscriminatory animus against older people in order to survive the employer’s summary-judgment\nmotion.\n        After reviewing the parties’ arguments and the relevant law, we conclude that the EEOC has\nestablished a prima facie violation of the ADEA, because the KRS plan is facially discriminatory\non the basis of age. Supreme Court authority on disparate-treatment-discrimination claims as well\nas the persuasive authority of many of the other circuits and the history of the ADEA (as amended\nby the OWBPA) demonstrate that KRS is not entitled to summary judgment. We further hold that\nwhen an employment policy or benefit plan such as the KRS plan is facially discriminatory, a\nplaintiff challenging that policy does not need additional proof of discriminatory animus in order\nto establish a prima facie disparate-treatment claim. Upon en banc review, we conclude that Lyon’s\nstandard for a disparate-treatment age-discrimination claim is inconsistent with Supreme Court\nauthority as well as the rulings of several of our sister circuits in cases involving the similar role of\nage in employee-benefit plans. We therefore overrule in part our previous decision in Lyon.\n       Because we conclude that the EEOC has established a prima facie claim of age\ndiscrimination, we REVERSE the district court’s grant of summary judgment to KRS on the\nEEOC’s age-discrimination claim and REMAND the case to the district court for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                         I. BACKGROUND\n        The dispute that led to this lawsuit began when Charles Lickteig, who was at the time a\nDeputy Sheriff with the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Department, was denied disability-retirement\nbenefits under the KRS plan because of his age. Because Lickteig’s job as a Deputy Sheriff was\n\fNo. 03-6437               EEOC v. Jefferson County Sheriff’s Dep’t et al.                                      Page 3\n\n\nconsidered hazardous, Lickteig became eligible for normal retirement benefits at age 55,1 but he\nchose to continue working past that date because he had school-age children to support. Joint\nAppendix (“J.A.”) at 49 (Lickteig Aff. ¶ 11). In 1995, Lickteig, who had worked as a Deputy\nSheriff since 1978, became disabled due to “a deteriorating vertebra[], arthritis, nerve damage, and\nParkinson’s disease” to the point that he could no longer perform his Deputy Sheriff duties. J.A. at\n48 (Lickteig Aff. ¶¶ 4, 6). In July 1995, at age sixty-one and with seventeen years and seven months\nworth of service, Lickteig applied for disability-retirement benefits under the KRS plan. J.A. at 42\n(William Hanes Aff. ¶ 3); J.A. at 49 (Lickteig Aff. ¶ 7). In a letter dated August 25, 1995,\ndefendants notified Lickteig that his request for disability-retirement benefits had been denied\nbecause of his age. In its denial letter, KRS explained:\n         Our laws state that you must have at least 60 months of service credit, be under age\n         55, and apply within 12 months of your last day of paid employment in a regular full-\n         time position to qualify for Disability Retirement. Therefore, you are not eligible to\n         apply for Disability Retirement since you are over age 55 and in a hazardous\n         position.\nJ.A. at 51 (Lickteig Denial Letter). As a result of the denial of his request for disability-retirement\nbenefits, Lickteig filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC in February 1996, alleging that\ndefendants illegally denied him the benefits because of his age. J.A. at 57-59 (EEOC Charges). The\nEEOC began investigating Lickteig’s charges and eventually concluded that the KRS plan violated\nthe ADEA.\n         The material aspects of the KRS plan are as follows. First, the KRS plan provides two types\nof retirement benefits — normal retirement benefits and disability-retirement benefits. Employees\nlike Lickteig who work in hazardous positions are eligible for normal retirement benefits at age fifty-\nfive or after completing twenty years of service, whereas an employee working in a nonhazardous\nposition is eligible for normal retirement benefits at age sixty-five. The EEOC is not challenging\nthe KRS plan provisions for normal retirement benefits for either class of employees, but rather only\nthe plan’s provision of disability-retirement benefits. As Lickteig is a hazardous-category employee,\nthe district court and the original hearing panel of our court analyzed only the disability-retirement\nplan’s impact upon employees in hazardous positions, and we do the same. We note, however, that\nour holding is equally applicable to KRS’s treatment of employees in nonhazardous positions to the\nextent that the disability-retirement plan utilizes age in a materially indistinguishable way in the\nprovision of disability-retirement benefits to employees in nonhazardous positions.\n      The EEOC argues that the KRS plan’s provisions of disability-retirement benefits violates\nthe ADEA because the plan “denies benefits or pays reduced benefits, because of age.” J.A. at 21\n(Compl. at 1). As the original hearing panel of our court explained:\n         The [KRS disability-retirement benefits] scheme appears to disadvantage older\n         workers by virtue of the fact that a class of workers, determined in significant part\n         by age (actually youth), gets unworked years attributed to them for purposes of\n         calculating the amount of disability retirement. When workers are disabled after they\n         become eligible for normal retirement, they receive only normal retirement benefits.\n         The amount of the yearly benefits is generally calculated as 2.5% of the employee’s\n         final compensation times the number of years worked. However, for employees who\n\n         1\n           As the original panel of this court explained, under the KRS retirement system, “[a]n employee in a hazardous\nposition is eligible to receive normal retirement benefits at age 55, or with twenty years of service, Ky. Rev. Stat.\n§§ 16.576, 16.577(2), 61.592(4), 78.545(31), whereas an employee in a nonhazardous position is eligible to receive\nnormal retirement benefits at age 65. Ky. Rev. Stat. § 61.510(18).” EEOC v. Jefferson County Sheriff’s Dep’t, 424 F.3d\n467, 469 (6th Cir. 2005), vacated on grant of reh’g en banc (2006).\n\fNo. 03-6437           EEOC v. Jefferson County Sheriff’s Dep’t et al.                            Page 4\n\n\n       are not yet eligible for normal retirement (i.e., employees under age 55 and with\n       fewer than 20 years of service), additional years are added to the number of years\n       worked for purposes of the calculation [of disability-retirement benefits]. The\n       number of years added is the number of years remaining until the worker would have\n       reached either normal retirement age or twenty years of service, but no more than the\n       number of years already worked. The purpose appears to be to give a disabled\n       worker the amount of benefit he would have been entitled to had he worked until\n       normal retirement, notwithstanding the fact that he had not actually worked those\n       additional years.\n               Under this scheme, disability retirement benefits will often be greater than\n       normal retirement benefits for employees with the same years of service (but less\n       than twenty years of service) and the same final compensation. The employee who\n       receives normal retirement benefits will be entitled to 2.5% of his final compensation\n       times his actual service years, whereas the employee who will receive disability\n       retirement benefits will receive the same 2.5% of his final compensation, but will\n       have it multiplied by a number that is higher than his actual years of service, leading\n       to a higher benefit. Moreover, disability benefits will be greater for workers who\n       become entitled to disability retirement at a younger age with the same number of\n       years of service.\nEEOC v. Jefferson County Sheriff’s Dep’t, 424 F.3d 467, 469-70 (6th Cir. 2005) (footnotes omitted),\nvacated on grant of reh’g en banc (2006).\n        In addition, a hazardous-category employee eligible for the disability-retirement-benefit plan\nwho is injured in the line of duty is guaranteed monthly benefits of at least 25% of monthly final rate\nof pay, and if the employee has dependent children, she receives a dependent-child benefit of 10%\nof monthly final rate of pay for each child, up to a maximum for all dependent children of 40% of\nmonthly final rate of pay. KY. REV. STAT. ANN. § 16.582(6). The parties do not dispute that an\notherwise-identical employee who becomes disabled in the line of duty but because of her age at the\ntime of disability is ineligible for disability-retirement benefits could not receive these additional\ndependent benefits.\n        The EEOC has provided charts demonstrating the impact of an employee’s age on her\ndisability-retirement-benefit amount in its brief. EEOC Br. at 14, 16. These charts illustrate, and\ndefendants do not dispute, that:\n       assuming every factor, other than age, that is relevant to determine an employee’s\n       benefits (i.e., type of position, disabling condition, final compensation, and length\n       of service) is identical, the amount paid annually to a worker who retires on\n       disability at a younger age will frequently exceed (and will never be less than) the\n       annual benefits of a worker who retires due to disability at an older age.\nEEOC Br. at 16-17. Additionally, the EEOC argues, and defendants do not dispute, that:\n       In every case, a worker younger than normal retirement age (55/65) who retires on\n       disability will receive more benefits each year than an older employee who retires\n       from the same job, with the same disabling condition, length of service, and final\n       compensation, who becomes disabled after reaching 55/65 and must take normal\n       retirement.\nEEOC Br. at 16.\n\fNo. 03-6437               EEOC v. Jefferson County Sheriff’s Dep’t et al.                                         Page 5\n\n\n       The EEOC challenges both the 1998 and the 2000 versions of the Kentucky statute\ngoverning the KRS plan.2 See EEOC Br. at 7-8 (explaining challenged aspects of both the pre-2000\nand 2000 versions of the KRS plan); id. at A-2 (excerpting portions of the pre-2000 and 2000\nversions of the statute). The original panel explained the key differences between the 1998 and 2000\nversions of the statute:\n         Prior to July 2000, an employee was not eligible to receive disability retirement\n         benefits unless he was “less than normal retirement age.” Ky.Rev.Stat.\n         § 16.582(2)(b) (1999), Ky.Rev.Stat. § 61.600(1)(b) (1999). After this litigation\n         began, the provisions were amended, and currently provide that an employee is not\n         eligible for retirement disability benefits if the employee is “eligible for an\n         unreduced retirement allowance.” Ky.Rev.Stat. § 16.582(2)(b) (2001) (effective July\n         14, 2000); see 2000 Ky. Acts 385, at *4. Under both versions, an employee who is\n         55 or older cannot receive disability retirement benefits. In addition, under the\n         current version, an employee who became eligible to receive normal retirement\n         benefits by virtue of having 20 years of service also could not receive disability\n         retirement benefits.\nEEOC v. Jefferson County, 424 F.3d at 469 n.1. The EEOC explains that it is not challenging the\nexclusion of this latter group of employees — those rendered ineligible for disability-retirement\nbenefits because of their years of service, rather than their age. The EEOC only “seeks relief for\nindividuals who, because of age, were excluded from disability retirement, or applied for disability\nretirement and have received fewer annual benefits, since October 16, 1992,” which is the enactment\ndate of the OWBPA. EEOC Reply Br. at 27; see also EEOC Br. at 34.\n        In the fall of 1998, the EEOC and KRS attempted to conciliate this dispute, but the parties\ncould not reach an agreement. J.A. at 60-62 (Marcia Hall-Craig Aff.). On August 2, 1999, the\nEEOC filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky,\nalleging that the KRS plan illegally discriminates on the basis of age in violation of the ADEA. J.A.\nat 21-23 (Compl. ¶¶ 1-12). KRS filed a motion to dismiss the suit on Tenth and Eleventh\nAmendment immunity grounds. After the district court denied defendants’ motion to dismiss, a\npanel of our court affirmed that decision, holding that, with one exception, the Tenth and Eleventh\nAmendments do not shield KRS from the EEOC’s age-discrimination suit. EEOC v. Ky. Ret. Sys.,\n16 F. App’x 443, 453 (6th Cir. 2001). After the case was remanded to the district court, both the\nEEOC and KRS moved for summary judgment. The district court granted summary judgment for\ndefendants, concluding that pursuant to our reasoning in Lyon, discriminatory intent was necessary\nto establish a prima facie case of age discrimination in a disparate-treatment claim. J.A. at 32-33\n(Dist. Ct. Op. at 4-5). The district court recognized that intent could be inferred from a facially\ndiscriminatory policy, but found that the KRS plan was not facially discriminatory, and thus\nconcluded that the EEOC had not alleged a valid disparate-treatment ADEA claim. The EEOC filed\na timely notice of appeal.\n       Although suggesting concerns regarding the soundness of Lyon’s reasoning, the original\nhearing panel of our court deemed itself bound by the Lyon decision and affirmed, holding that\n“[b]ecause the retirement plan at issue in this case is materially indistinguishable from the early\n\n\n         2\n            We will therefore confine our analysis to the 1998 and 2000 versions of the statute. We note, however, that\nthe Kentucky Legislature again revised the KRS plan in 2004. The 2004 revision retained the age-based eligibility\nrequirements of the 2000 version, but altered the calculation of disability-retirement benefits. For members beginning\nto participate on or after August 1, 2004, disability-retirement pay is calculated to be “the higher of twenty-five percent\n(25%) of the member’s monthly final rate of pay or the retirement allowance determined in the same manner as for\nretirement at his normal retirement date with years of service and final compensation being determined as of the date\nof his disability.” KY. REV. STAT. ANN. § 16.582(5)(b).\n\fNo. 03-6437               EEOC v. Jefferson County Sheriff’s Dep’t et al.                                         Page 6\n\n\nretirement incentive plan [held to be consistent with the ADEA] in Lyon, the Kentucky Retirement\nplan cannot be held to violate the ADEA.” EEOC v. Jefferson County, 424 F.3d at 473. The EEOC\npetitioned for rehearing en banc, arguing that the KRS plan is facially discriminatory, and that the\nCommission has therefore established a prima facie claim of age discrimination. The EEOC also\nurges us to overrule Lyon to the extent that Lyon holds that a plaintiff challenging a facially\ndiscriminatory employment policy must have proof that the policy was motivated by discriminatory\nanimus against older workers in order to state a prima facie violation of the ADEA.\n                                                   II. ANALYSIS\n        We begin with a discussion of the origins of the ADEA, as the history of the Act informs our\nanalysis of the issues raised in this case. Congress considered including age as a protected class\nwhen it was debating and drafting Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but declined to do so\nbecause of concerns that employers might sometimes have a legitimate basis for making age-related\nemployment decisions. Gen. Dynamics Land Sys., Inc. v. Cline, 540 U.S. 581, 587-88 (2004). In\norder to determine whether Congressional action to address age discrimination was necessary and\nto understand better what type of legislation might remedy the existing problems, Congress\nrequested that then-Secretary of Labor Willard Wirtz conduct “a full and complete study of the\nfactors which might tend to result in discrimination in employment because of age and of the\nconsequences of such discrimination on the economy and individuals affected.” Smith v. City of\nJackson, 544 U.S. 228, 232 (2005) (quoting Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Pub. L. No.\n88-352, § 715, 78 Stat. 265 (1964)).\n        The Secretary of Labor’s report, submitted to Congress in June 1965, concluded that age\ndiscrimination was sufficiently widespread that it warranted public concern, but that the nature of\nage discrimination was quite different from discrimination based upon the classes protected by Title\nVII. U.S. SECRETARY OF LABOR, THE OLDER AMERICAN WORKER: AGE DISCRIMINATION IN\nEMPLOYMENT 5-6 (June 1965), reprinted in U.S. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION,\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF THE AGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT ACT 22-23 (1981) (hereinafter\n“Wirtz Report”). “Because the ADEA was modeled on the Wirtz Report’s findings and\nrecommendations, the Report provides critical insights into the statute’s meaning.” Smith, 544 U.S.\nat 254 (O’Connor, J., concurring in the judgment). The Wirtz Report concluded “that there was little\ndiscrimination arising from dislike or intolerance of older people, but that ‘arbitrary’ discrimination\ndid result from certain age limits.” Id. at 232 (majority opinion). The Report stated that it had\n“found no evidence of prejudice based on dislike or intolerance of the older worker,” and that\n“intolerance, of such overriding importance in the case of attitudes toward other groups, assumes\nminimal importance in the case of older people and older workers.” Wirtz Report at 6. Despite\nfinding a lack of discriminatory animus against older people, Secretary Wirtz found “substantial\nevidence of arbitrary” age discrimination. Id. at 5. Secretary Wirtz defined arbitrary3 age\ndiscrimination as “assumptions about the effect of age on [an employee’s] ability to do a job when\nthere is in fact no basis for these assumptions.” Id. at 2. The Report explains that a common form\nof arbitrary age discrimination at that time was the refusal of employers to hire individuals for\npositions once they had reached a certain age, without any actual relevance to the particular\nposition’s job requirements. Id. at 6-8.\n\n\n         3\n            The Supreme Court has largely adopted the Wirtz Report’s definition of “arbitrary” age discrimination in its\nADEA jurisprudence. In General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline, the Court stated that the ADEA’s terms\n“arbitrary limits” and “arbitrary age discrimination” “are unmistakable references to the Wirtz Report’s finding” that age\nceilings in hiring were at the time widespread. 540 U.S. at 590. “The ADEA’s ban on ‘arbitrary limits’ thus applies to\nage caps that exclude older applicants, necessarily to the advantage of younger ones.” Id. Similarly, in her concurrence\nin Smith v. City of Jackson, Justice O’Connor read the Wirtz Report’s definition of “arbitrary” as “clearly equat[ing] with\ndisparate treatment” and as treatment on the basis of age that is “intentional and unfounded.” Smith, 544 U.S. at 255\n(O’Connor, J., concurring in the judgment).\n\fNo. 03-6437           EEOC v. Jefferson County Sheriff’s Dep’t et al.                         Page 7\n\n\n         The Wirtz Report inspired Congress to request that the Secretary draft proposed legislation\nto combat age discrimination, and after that was completed, Congress “acted favorably on his\nproposal” and enacted the ADEA. Smith, 544 U.S. at 232-33. In 1967, Congress enacted the\nADEA, which now renders it “unlawful for an employer (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge\nany individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,\nterms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s age;” as well as “(2)\nto limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\nindividual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee,\nbecause of such individual’s age.” 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1)-(2).\n        In this case, the EEOC urges us to conclude that it has established a prima facie claim of age\ndiscrimination because the KRS plan facially discriminates against older employees in two ways:\n(1) the KRS plan renders employees ineligible for disability-retirement benefits simply because of\ntheir age, which means that disabled workers who are ineligible for disability benefits because of\ntheir age receive lower (normal) retirement benefits than otherwise-similar younger workers who\nbecome disabled and are able to receive the greater disability-retirement benefits, and (2) the KRS\nplan uses an employee’s age in order to calculate disability-retirement benefits in such a way that\nan older eligible employee receives lower monthly disability-benefit payments than an otherwise-\nsimilar younger disabled worker.\n        Defendants argue that, contrary to the EEOC’s assertion, the KRS plan does not violate the\nADEA because the policy does not discriminate “because of age.” KRS Br. at 10. Rather,\ndefendants argue, the KRS plan merely uses age as one of several factors to determine benefits, in\nthe same way that age is a factor in many, if not most, retirement-benefit plans. See KRS Br. at 13.\nDefendants also assert that a valid disparate-treatment claim requires a plaintiff to establish proof\nof discriminatory motive, and that “[t]here is no evidence that the [KRS plan] framework established\nto provide benefits to disabled members of Kentucky Retirement was in any fashion age-driven.”\nKRS Br. at 26-27.\n        We consider first the EEOC’s argument that it has established a prima facie ADEA claim\nbecause the KRS disability-retirement-benefits plan is facially discriminatory. We then assess\nKRS’s argument that even if the KRS plan is facially discriminatory, the EEOC must produce\nevidence that the plan was motivated by discriminatory animus against older people in order to\nsustain its prima facie burden.\nA. The EEOC Has Established a Prima Facie ADEA Claim Because the KRS Plan Facially\n   Discriminates on the Basis of Age\n        The Supreme Court has made clear that an employer’s reliance “upon a formal, facially\ndiscriminatory policy requiring adverse treatment of employees with that [protected] trait”\nestablishes a prima facie disparate-treatment claim under the ADEA. Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins,\n507 U.S. 604, 610 (1993) (citing Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U.S. 111, 121 (1985)).\nIn Thurston, the plaintiffs were pilots who became disqualified to continue serving in the position\nof captain when they reached age sixty. Unlike individuals who became disqualified from serving\nas captain for reasons other than age, the plaintiffs were not granted the privilege of automatically\ntransferring to the position of flight engineer. Instead, former captains who became disqualified\nfrom continuing in the position of captain because of their age could obtain only a flight engineer\nposition if they were successful in a bidding process.\n        A unanimous Court stated that even though the airline was not required to provide transfer\nprivileges to any disqualified captains, “if TWA does grant some disqualified captains the ‘privilege’\nof ‘bumping’ less senior flight engineers, it may not deny this opportunity to others because of their\nage.” Thurston, 469 U.S. at 120-21. Thurston held that the plaintiffs had established a prima facie\n\fNo. 03-6437               EEOC v. Jefferson County Sheriff’s Dep’t et al.                                        Page 8\n\n\ncase of age discrimination because “there is direct evidence that the method of transfer available to\na disqualified captain depends upon [the captain’s] age. Since it allows captains who become\ndisqualified for any reason other than age to ‘bump’ less senior flight engineers, TWA’s transfer\npolicy is discriminatory on its face.” Id. at 121. See also City of Los Angeles, Dep’t of Water &\nPower v. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702, 715-16 (1978) (finding facial sex discrimination in violation of\nTitle VII where female employees are required to make larger pension contributions than their male\ncounterparts).4\n         When we apply the definition of facial discrimination established by the Court in Hazen\nPaper, Thurston, and Manhart to the present dispute, it is apparent that the KRS plan is facially\ndiscriminatory on the basis of age in at least two ways. First, like the transfer plan in Thurston, the\nKRS plan categorically excludes still-working employees over age fifty-five from a particular\nemployment benefit because of their age. In order to be eligible for disability-retirement benefits,\nemployees in hazardous positions must become disabled before they reach age fifty-five. There is\nabsolutely no dispute that under the KRS plan, when such an employee becomes disabled at age\nfifty-five or older, that older employee is adversely treated because of his or her age when compared\nto a disabled coworker who is similarly situated in all relevant aspects other than age. On its face,\nthis age-eligibility aspect of the KRS plan mandates disparate treatment of disabled employees on\nthe basis of age. Defendants’ decision to render employees in hazardous positions ineligible for\ndisability-retirement benefits simply because they have reached normal retirement age is “a formal,\nfacially discriminatory policy” that discriminates on the basis of age, which is sufficient to establish\na prima facie ADEA violation. Hazen Paper, 507 U.S. at 610.\n        The KRS plan is facially discriminatory in a second way, in that KRS employees who\nbecome disabled when they are still “young enough” to be eligible for disability-retirement benefits\nreceive reduced benefits compared to otherwise-similar but even younger disabled employees for\nno reason other than their age. KRS does not dispute that its plan pays lower disability-retirement\nbenefits to an older worker who, apart from age, is similarly situated to a younger worker in all\nrelevant respects. An employee’s age, therefore, “actually play[s] a role in” and has “a\ndeterminative influence on the outcome” of the amount a disabled employee’s disability-retirement-\nbenefit payment is each month. Hazen Paper, 507 U.S. at 610. This is a second way that the KRS\nplan, on its face, requires disparate treatment on the basis of age. See id. at 609 (stating that\ndisparate treatment occurs when “[t]he employer simply treats some people less favorably than\nothers because of their” protected trait) (quoting Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S.\n324, 335-36 n.15 (1977)).\n       The district court’s conclusion, compelled by Lyon,5 that the KRS plan does not facially\ndiscriminate on the basis of age is also contrary to the Supreme Court’s analysis in Public\nEmployees Retirement System of Ohio v. Betts, 492 U.S. 158 (1989). The KRS plan’s\ndisqualification of employees age fifty-five and over for disability benefits closely resembles the\ncharacteristic of the plan in Betts that the Supreme Court found to be facially discriminatory. See\n\n\n         4\n            Interestingly, the Supreme Court in Manhart rejected the defendant’s argument that plaintiffs must produce\nactuarial evidence that the facially discriminatory policy actually had a discriminatory effect on women as a class, and\nheld that the absence of this effect-evidence did not defeat plaintiffs’ successful disparate-treatment claim based upon\nthe facially discriminatory nature of the policy. Manhart, 435 U.S. at 716.\n         5\n           Although Lyon involved a challenge to the use of age in the determination of the amount of early retirement\nbenefits, we agree with the original hearing panel in this case that the role that age played in the plan at issue in Lyon\n“is not materially distinguishable” from the role that age plays in the KRS plan. EEOC v. Jefferson County, 424 F.3d\nat 471. Both plans compute the disputed benefits in such a way that the employee’s age is the determinative factor in\nthe calculation of the benefit amount, with an older employee receiving lower benefits than an otherwise-similar younger\nemployee. Id.\n\fNo. 03-6437           EEOC v. Jefferson County Sheriff’s Dep’t et al.                           Page 9\n\n\nid. at 166 (finding that “[o]n its face, the [employee benefit] scheme renders covered employees\nineligible for disability retirement once they have attained age 60,” but holding that the employer\nmet an exemption under the ADEA because plaintiffs did not provide evidence of “subterfuge”).\nIn response to Betts, Congress promptly amended the ADEA to remove the need for proof of\nsubterfuge and to clarify its intent “to prohibit discrimination against older workers in all employee\nbenefits except when age-based reductions in employee benefit plans are justified by significant cost\nconsiderations.” Older Workers Benefit Protection Act (“OWBPA”), Pub. Law 101-433, § 101, 104\nStat. 978 (1990) (codified at 29 U.S.C. § 621).\n        The original panel in this case considered Betts and the legislative history of the OWBPA.\nEEOC v. Jefferson County, 424 F.3d at 474-75. Nevertheless, the original panel ultimately\ndetermined that it was unable to distinguish Lyon on that ground because the same legislative\nmaterial was available to the Lyon panel. Id. (citing, inter alia, excerpts of the final debate about\nthe OWBPA stating that “[t]he bill provides that workers who are on disability cannot be forced to\nreceive only their pension at retirement age” and that under the OWBPA, “they will receive the\ndifference between what is typically a lower pension benefit and the higher disability benefit”). We\nbelieve that this legislative history is compelling evidence that when revising the ADEA in response\nto Betts, Congress intended to prohibit the very sort of age-based discrimination that the original\npanel, bound by Lyon, condoned in this plan.\n         That many of our sister circuits have reached conclusions contrary to Lyon lends further\nsupport for our conclusion that Lyon’s definition of a prima facie ADEA claim can no longer stand.\nSince Lyon was decided, the Second, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits have each recognized a\nprima facie ADEA violation in analogous situations. See Jankovitz v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch.\nDist., 421 F.3d 649, 653 (8th Cir. 2005) (stating that a retirement plan is “discriminatory on its face”\nbecause “it is undisputed that an employee is ineligible for early retirement benefits [under the plan]\nif he or she is over the age of 65”); Abrahamson v. Bd. of Educ. of Wappingers Falls Cent. Sch.\nDist., 374 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir. 2004) (finding prima facie case of age discrimination under ADEA\nwhen age “is the effective trigger for eligibility” for retirement policy); Arnett v. Cal. Pub.\nEmployees Ret. Sys., 179 F.3d 690, 695 (9th Cir. 1999) (recognizing prima facie disparate-treatment\nclaim when it “is unquestionable that the [e]mployees would have received greater disability\nretirement benefits but for their older ages at hire”), cert. granted, 528 U.S. 1111, vacated on other\ngrounds by Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62 (2000); Huff v. UARCO, Inc., 122 F.3d\n374, 387-88 (7th Cir. 1997) (finding employer not entitled to summary judgment on disparate-\ntreatment claim because the early retirement policy “draws an express line between workers over\nfifty-five and those under”).\n       We conclude that the KRS plan is facially discriminatory on the basis of age, and thus we\nhold that the EEOC has established a prima facie violation of the ADEA.\nB. The EEOC Need Not Provide Additional Proof of Discriminatory Animus, As\n   Discriminatory Intent Is Evidenced by the Facially Discriminatory Nature of the KRS\n   Plan\n          KRS argues that defendants are entitled to summary judgment because the EEOC has not\nprovided any proof that KRS enacted the disability-retirement-benefits plan because of a\ndiscriminatory animus against older workers. Unfortunately for KRS, this argument runs contrary\nto Supreme Court authority and the history and purpose of the ADEA. Once a plaintiff has\nestablished that a policy is facially discriminatory in that it classifies or disadvantages an employee\n“because of” the employee’s protected status, additional proof of discriminatory intent is not needed,\nas it is directly evidenced by the facially discriminatory nature of the policy itself. As the Supreme\nCourt held in Automobile Workers v. Johnson Controls, Inc., 499 U.S. 187, 199 (1991), a plaintiff\n\fNo. 03-6437               EEOC v. Jefferson County Sheriff’s Dep’t et al.                                      Page 10\n\n\nwho has identified a facially discriminatory employment policy need not provide evidence of\ndiscriminatory animus to prevail on a disparate-treatment claim. Johnson Controls explained:\n         [T]he absence of a malevolent motive does not convert a facially discriminatory\n         policy into a neutral policy with a discriminatory effect. Whether an employment\n         practice involves disparate treatment through explicit facial discrimination does not\n         depend on why the employer discriminates but rather on the explicit terms of the\n         discrimination.\nThe Supreme Court reaffirmed this approach in Hazen Paper, stating that evidence of intent to\ndiscriminate necessary for a disparate-treatment claim “can in some situations be inferred from the\nmere fact of differences in treatment.” 507 U.S. at 609 (internal quotation marks omitted). See also\nJankovitz, 421 F.3d at 653 (concluding that because retirement plan is facially discriminatory on the\nbasis of age, “intent to discriminate can be presumed”); Massarsky v. Gen. Motors Corp., 706 F.2d\n111, 119 (3d Cir. 1983) (stating that “where an employer’s policy or practice is discriminatory on\nits face, it is unnecessary for the plaintiff to make a separate showing of intent to discriminate.”)\n        As it was bound by Johnson Controls and Hazen Paper, the Lyon panel at one point correctly\nrecognized that intent to discriminate can be inferred from a defendant’s knowledge of a disparate\neffect. See Lyon, 53 F.3d at 139 (stating that plaintiffs have not “alleged that [defendants were]\naware of a disparate effect on older employees, such that we could infer intent from knowledge.”).\nLyon later uses language, however,    that contradicts not only this earlier recognition but also the\nabove Supreme Court precedent.6 See id. (“Plaintiffs try to cure their lack of evidence of intent by\ninferring discriminatory animus on the basis of a disparate effect on older workers. This is circular,\nand would render meaningless the carefully-wrought distinction between disparate-impact and\ndisparate-treatment theories of discrimination . . . .”). The original hearing panel in this case\nsuggested persuasively that discriminatory “[i]ntent arguably should be inferred from the employer’s\nknowledge concerning its own [retirement] plan,” but continued that “[s]uch an argument is,\nhowever, foreclosed by Lyon.” EEOC v. Jefferson County, 424 F.3d at 473. The panel continued\nin its criticism of Lyon, explaining why Lyon’s requirement that a plaintiff alleging disparate\ntreatment must produce additional evidence of a defendant’s discriminatory animus where the\nchallenged employment action consists of a benefits plan is misguided because “the only action that\nwill ever be taken in cases involving retirement plans — as opposed to individual adverse actions\n— is the action of writing the policy.” Id. We agree, and we hold that an employer’s intent to\ndiscriminate is directly evidenced by the employer’s writing or adoption of a facially discriminatory\nemployment policy.\n       Finally, KRS’s argument that the only disparate treatment on the basis of age that the ADEA\nwas designed to remedy is disparate treatment motivated by discriminatory animus against the old\nis nonsensical considering the origins of the ADEA. The Wirtz Report, which inspired Congress\nto enact the ADEA, found “no evidence of prejudice based on dislike or intolerance of the older\n\n\n         6\n            The language in Hazen Paper upon which defendants, the district court, and the panel in Lyon appear to rely\nfor their belief that additional proof of discriminatory motive is required is Hazen Paper’s statement that “a disparate\ntreatment claim cannot succeed unless the employee’s protected trait actually played a role in [the employer’s decision-\nmaking process] and had a determinative influence on the outcome.” Hazen Paper, 507 U.S. at 610 (emphasis added).\nA closer analysis of Hazen Paper belies defendants’ argument. Immediately before making this statement, the Court\nin Hazen Paper gave examples of ways in which the protected trait could actually motivate an employer’s decision and\ntherefore constitute disparate treatment. With citations to its previous decisions in Thurston and Manhart, the Court gave\nas its first example “a formal, facially discriminatory policy requiring adverse treatment of employees with that\n[protected] trait.” Id. It is therefore evident that the Hazen Paper language that defendants and Lyon cling to in an\nattempt to argue that Hazen Paper added an additional requirement of discriminatory animus was simply the Court’s\nsummary statement to describe the various circumstances that can constitute intentional action sufficient to support a\nviable disparate-treatment claim.\n\fNo. 03-6437          EEOC v. Jefferson County Sheriff’s Dep’t et al.                       Page 11\n\n\nworker.” Wirtz Report at 6. Despite the absence of discriminatory animus against older workers,\nCongress enacted the ADEA to fight arbitrary age discrimination, which Secretary Wirtz defined\nas age-based assumptions that lacked a basis in fact. Id. at 2. Thus for KRS’s interpretation of the\nAct to be correct, it would mean that in passing the ADEA, Congress intended to prohibit only a\ntype of age discrimination that it had been advised did not exist. We will not interpret the ADEA\nso narrowly and illogically.\n        There is simply no dispute that under the KRS plan, an employee’s age actually plays a role\nin the defendants’ decision-making process about what amount, if any, of disability-retirement\nbenefits an employee receives, and that age therefore has a “determinative influence on the\noutcome” for the disabled older employee. Hazen Paper, 507 U.S. at 610. The KRS plan excludes\nhazardous-category employees age fifty-five and over from receiving disability-retirement benefits,\nand pays reduced benefits to older eligible disabled workers compared to their younger counterparts\nbecause of their age. The EEOC has established a prima facie ADEA claim.\n                                      III. CONCLUSION\n        The EEOC has established a prima facie case of age discrimination because it has\ndemonstrated that the KRS plan facially discriminates on the basis of age. No evidence of\ndiscriminatory animus is needed, as intent to discriminate on the basis of age is directly evidenced\nby the facially discriminatory nature of the KRS plan. We REVERSE the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment to defendants and REMAND to the district court for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\fNo. 03-6437            EEOC v.

I concur in the result, generally for the reasons\nexpressed in the majority opinion. The following four concerns, however, prevent my concurring\nin that opinion.\n         First, the retirement plans at issue in this case discriminate in only one way rather than two.\nThe majority's description of the first way in which the KRS plan discriminates is significant only\nas it constitutes a part of the second way. That is, it is not facial discrimination to give older workers\none kind of retirement plan and younger workers the same plan with a different name. The only real\ndifference between disability retirement and normal retirement is the one caused by the “second”\ndiscriminatory characteristic. That is, if the retirement plans were called by the same name, there\nwould be no age discrimination other than that arising from the attribution of unworked years (or\nmore unworked years) based on age. If that discrimination were cured, on the other hand, the “first”\nway in which the KRS plan discriminates would be semantic only.\n       Second, in my view it is unnecessary for the en banc court to characterize the panel opinion’s\ntreatment of our court’s opinion in Lyon. The panel opinion, available as it is in the Federal\nReporter, speaks for itself, and in any event the panel opinion has been vacated.\n        Third, it is only necessary for us to overrule Lyon to the extent that Lyon is inconsistent with\nour en banc holding and reasoning. I would leave to future litigants the task of going through Lyon\nand identifying what survives and what does not.\n         Finally, we should make clear that in this case we take no position on whether the result in\nLyon can be supported by the early retirement exception to ADEA liability, 29 U.S.C.\n§ 623(f)(2)(B)(ii). The district court in Lyon granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants\nafter finding that the plaintiffs had failed to establish a prima facie disparate-treatment claim and,\nalternatively, that the retirement plan at issue constituted a lawful early retirement incentive plan\npursuant to § 623(f)(2)(B)(ii). 53 F.3d at 137. Our court in Lyon did not reach the latter issue\nbecause it agreed with the district court regarding the plaintiffs’ prima facie case. Id.\n\fNo. 03-6437             EEOC v.

The majority concludes that the disability-retirement plan\nof the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Department, Kentucky Retirement Systems, and the\nCommonwealth of Kentucky (collectively referred to as “KRS”) amounts to a facial violation of the\nAge Discrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq., as amended by the\nOlder Workers Benefits Protection Act (“OWBPA”), P. Law 101-433, 104 Stat. 978 (1990). I\nbelieve that a careful examination of the plan shows that it considers age only in combination with\nyears of service and years to retirement age, and is a non-discriminatory way of providing workers\nwith protection against disability before they have had an opportunity to earn a normal pension at\nretirement age. It therefore is not illegal under the Supreme Court’s precedent in Hazen Paper Co.\nv. Biggins, 507 U.S. 604 (1993), and I respectfully dissent.\n        Congress stated that the purpose of the ADEA is to “promote employment of older persons\nbased on their ability rather than age; to prohibit arbitrary age discrimination in employment; to help\nemployers and workers find ways of meeting problems arising from the impact of age on\nemployment.” 29 U.S.C. § 621(b). 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1) prohibits an employer from, inter alia,\n“discriminat[ing] against any individual with respect to his compensation,         terms, conditions, or\nprivileges of employment, because of such individual’s age.”1\n         The Supreme Court has noted that the ADEA “broadly prohibits arbitrary discrimination in\nthe workplace based on age.” Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U.S. 111, 120 (1985)\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In discussing the ADEA in Hazen Paper, the\nSupreme Court emphasized the distinction between the disparate treatment and disparate impact\ntheories of employment discrimination. 507 U.S. at 609. The Court stated that under a disparate\ntreatment theory, “[t]he employer simply treats some people less favorably than others because of\ntheir race, color, religion [or other protected characteristics.] Proof of discriminatory motive is\ncritical, although it can in some situations be inferred from the mere fact of differences in\ntreatment. . . . ” Ibid. (second alteration and ellipsis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted)\n(quoting Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 335–36 n.15 (1977)).\n        The Court continued that “[i]n a disparate treatment case, liability depends on whether the\nprotected trait (under the ADEA, age) actually motivated the employer’s decision.” Hazen Paper,\n507 U.S. at 610. The employer “may have relied upon a formal, facially discriminatory policy\nrequiring adverse treatment of employees with that trait,” ibid. (citing Thurston, supra, and Los\nAngeles Dep’t of Water & Power v. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702, 704-18 (1978)), or “may have been\nmotivated by the protected trait on an ad hoc, informal basis.” Ibid. “Whatever the employer’s\ndecisionmaking process,” the Court noted, “a disparate treatment claim cannot succeed unless the\nemployee’s protected trait actually played a role in that process and had a determinative influence\non the outcome.” Ibid. (emphases added).\n       Defined in that way, the Court added, disparate treatment “captures the essence of what\nCongress sought to prohibit in the ADEA. It is the very essence of age discrimination for an older\nemployee to be fired because the employer believes that productivity and competence decline with\nold age.” Ibid. “Congress’ promulgation of the ADEA was prompted by its concern that older\nworkers were being deprived of employment on the basis of inaccurate and stigmatizing\n\n\n        1\n           “‘[C]ompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment’ encompasses all employee benefits,\nincluding such benefits provided pursuant to a bona fide employee benefit plan.” 29 U.S.C. § 630(l).\n\fNo. 03-6437               EEOC v. Jefferson County Sheriff’s Dep’t et al.                                      Page 14\n\n\nstereotypes.” Ibid. This type of stereotyping is nowhere found in the plan under consideration\ntoday.\n         In Hazen Paper, the Court addressed the question of whether an employer’s firing an\nemployee whose pension was shortly to vest violated the ADEA where the vesting of the pension\nwas based exclusively on years of service. The Court held that although pension status is typically\ncorrelated with age, and although it is perhaps true that “older employees of Hazen Paper are more\nlikely to be ‘close to vesting’ than younger employees,” age and years of service were nevertheless\nanalytically distinct. If the employer fired the employee because of pension status, not because of\nage, “[t]he prohibited stereotype (‘Older employees are likely to be ___’) would not have figured\nin this decision, and the attendant stigma would not ensue.” Such conduct would not violate the\nADEA, the Court held. 507 U.S. at 611-12. (The Court ultimately remanded for a determination\nof whether the firing had in fact been based on age rather than on years of service. Id. at 613.) In\nshort, the Supreme Court held that, under the ADEA, companies could make a decision based solely\non the need to save money, even if that decision bore more heavily, on average, on older workers,\nso long as the factor relied on was only correlated with age, not determined by age. In our case, with\nmuch less base motives, the KRS plan is impacted by age only in relation to years of service and\nyears remaining until normal retirement age, as shown by the examples given on pages 16 and 17,\ninfra.\n        Thurston, an ADEA case cited by the Supreme Court in Hazen Paper as one in which the\nemployer’s formal, facially discriminatory policy showed intent to discriminate against older\nemployees because of their age, fits comfortably within the “very essence” of the ADEA as\ndiscussed by the Court in Hazen Paper. In Thurston, TWA had adopted a policy by which captains\nwho were disqualified from serving in that capacity for reasons other than age were allowed to\ntransfer to the position of flight engineer, and in the process to “bump” less senior flight engineers.\nPilots who were going to be disqualified from continuing to serve as captains because they had\nreached the age of 60, however, had to resort to bidding procedures in order to become a flight\nengineer, and if the procedures did not result in a flight engineer position, the captain had to retire\nat 60. 469 U.S. at 115-17, 120. Under the TWA policy, the following results would obtain. Captain\nA is disqualified from continuing to serve as captain because he is found to be incompetent. Captain\nB is nearing age 60. They are otherwise similarly situated. Captain A is allowed to transfer to the\nposition of flight engineer and bump less-senior flight engineers in the process, id. at 117; Captain\nB is not. The Court found that the policy, under which “the method of transfer available to a\ndisqualified captain depends upon his age,” was “discriminatory on its face,” and therefore\namounted to direct evidence of age discrimination in violation of the ADEA. Id. at 121-22. The\nThurston case is thus an example of a forbidden policy that, in fact, implicates a stigmatizing and\ninaccurate stereotype–that pilots over age 60 are less capable, or at least less valuable as employees,\neven than younger workers who have been relieved for incompetence.\n         TWA’s policy clearly embodied the “essence” of what the ADEA sought to prohibit–that is,\narbitrary age discrimination. That is not the case with the KRS disability-retirement plan, nor was\nit the case with the early-retirement policy in Lyon v. Ohio Education Ass’n and Prof’l Staff Union,\n53 F.3d 135 (6th Cir. 1995). Here, and in Lyon, no such stereotype is implicated.\n        The majority contends that there are two ways in which the KRS plan facially discriminates\nagainst older employees.  First, workers with less than 20 years of service time (for employees in\nhazardous positions2) who become disabled before a certain age (in the case of employees in\nhazardous positions, 55) receive additional credit toward retirement, while those over normal\n\n         2\n          I follow the convention of the parties, the original panel, and the majority of this en banc court, by referring\nto the KRS plan for employees in hazardous positions, although the analysis applies to the plan for employees in non-\nhazardous positions as well.\n\fNo. 03-6437                EEOC v. Jefferson County Sheriff’s Dep’t et al.                                       Page 15\n\n\nretirement age do not receive additional credits (that is, their years to normal retirement age is zero).\nSecond, a disabled worker with fewer years remaining until          retirement age may receive fewer\nadditional credits than a worker with more years remaining.3 But the calculations for determining\ndisability benefits for workers who become disabled under age 55 and for normal retirement benefits\nfor those over age 55 are the same, with the exception of the imputed years added to the former’s\nservice time.\n         The original panel succinctly describes how the KRS plan works:\n         When workers are disabled after they become eligible for normal retirement, they\n         receive only normal retirement benefits. The amount of the yearly benefits is\n         generally calculated as 2.5% of the employee’s final compensation times the number\n         of years worked. However, for employees who are not yet eligible for normal\n         retirement (i.e., employees under age 55 and with fewer than 20 years of service),\n         additional years are added to the number of years worked for purposes of the\n         calculation. The number of years added is the number of years remaining until the\n         worker would have reached either normal retirement age or twenty years of service,\n         but no more than the number of years already worked.\nEEOC v. Jefferson County Sheriff’s Dep’t, 424 F.3d 467, 469 (6th Cir. 2005) (footnote omitted),\nvacated on grant of reh’g en banc, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 258 (6th Cir. Jan. 4, 2006). The majority\nargues that because older employees with, e.g., 10 years of service and final pay of $50,000 receive\nfewer benefits than younger employees with the same years of service and final pay, the KRS plan\nis facially discriminatory. Yet the majority misses the point that a 53-year-old employee who\nbecomes disabled is not similarly situated to a 33-year-old employee who becomes disabled, even\nif they have the same service years and final pay at the time of disability. All else being equal, the\nnon-disabled 33-year-old of course has more years to work and live than does a non-disabled 55-\nyear-old. See Lyon, 53 F.3d at 137, 140-41 (explaining that an early-retirement plan that “ensure[s]\nearly retirees the same benefits that they would have received had they continued to work until their\nnormal retirement date” did not pay older workers lower benefits because of age; two employees\nof different ages but equal years of service are not similarly situated). Here, the number of years of\nadditional work credit lost is a factor related to, but not determined by, age.\n        In Public Employees Retirement System v. Betts, 492 U.S. 158 (1989), the Supreme Court\nconfronted a disability-retirement plan that provided age-and-service retirement benefits to those\nwho retired over a certain age (for Betts, the plaintiff, the retirement age was 60) and had a certain\nnumber of service years, or to those under the age who had served a set higher number of years. The\nplan also provided disability benefits to those under the retirement age who had served a certain\nnumber of years and suffered a disability. 492 U.S. at 162. The scheme in Betts provided that\ndisability payments would constitute not less than 30% of the disability retiree’s final average salary;\nno such floor existed for age-and-service retirees. Betts became disabled at age 61, and therefore\nwas unable to receive disability benefits. She received in age-and-service benefits just over half\nwhat she would have received in disability. Id. at 163.\n        The Supreme Court stated that “[o]n its face, the . . . scheme renders covered employees\nineligible for disability retirement once they have attained age 60.” Yet the Court found that the\nscheme did not violate the ADEA because it fit under the then-existing provision of 29 U.S.C.\n\n         3\n           “May receive” for two reasons: first, as shown below at pages 16 and 17, a younger worker may only need\nthe same number of years for maximum benefits as an older worker (e.g., in the case of a 40-year-old with 15 years of\nservice and a 50-year-old with 15 years of service), and second, additional credit is limited to the number of years already\nworked. Thus, a 49-year-old with six service years and a 40-year-old with six service years will each get the same\nbenefit–six additional years of credit.\n\fNo. 03-6437            EEOC v. Jefferson County Sheriff’s Dep’t et al.                           Page 16\n\n\n§ 623(f)(2) that exempted age-based decisions taken pursuant to the terms of “any bona fide\nemployee benefit plan such as a retirement, pension, or insurance plan, which is not a subterfuge to\nevade the purposes of” the ADEA. Id. at 161-62, 166. A year after the Supreme Court’s decision\nin Betts, Congress passed the OWBPA, amending the ADEA. The OWBPA included a finding that\n“as a result of [Betts], legislative action is necessary to restore the original congressional intent in\npassing and amending the [ADEA], which was to prohibit discrimination against older workers in\nall employment benefits except when age-based reductions in employee benefit plans are justified\nby significant cost considerations.” OWBPA, Pub. L. No. 101-433, § 101, 104 Stat. 978 (1990)\n(codified at 29 U.S.C. § 621 note).\n        In contradistinction to the plan at issue in Betts, the case the OWBPA was designed to\noverturn, the KRS plan does not provide younger workers with a specific benefit unavailable to\nolder workers. In Betts, the crucial distinction was that a “disability” retirement gave a worker a\nguaranteed minimum income of 30% of the worker’s final salary. Betts was disqualified from\nreceiving that benefit solely on the basis of age, though she was qualified in every other respect.\nBetts, 492 U.S. at 162-63.\n        Under the KRS plan, a “disability” retirement is intrinsically no different from the “normal”\nretirement pension available to every worker. Benefits are based on years of credited service\n(augmented to a maximum of 20 for disabled workers ineligible for normal retirement), multiplied\nby a factor related to final salary. If “normal” benefits are greater than the augmented benefits for\ndisability, of course, the greater benefits are provided. The plan simply provides that a worker who\nis disabled before reaching eligibility for normal retirement benefits has a way of receiving a\nretirement benefit equal to (or closer to) what he would have received had he not become disabled\nbefore reaching the normal retirement age or 20 years of service.\n       This is a very reasonable benefit, and one that a younger worker, in particular, would be\nmore likely to value more highly than a newly-hired older worker, who would be more likely to have\nacquired other benefits from more extensive earlier employment. The extensive questioning by this\ncourt at oral argument, attempting to probe for a way to provide this sensible result under the\nappellants’ reasoning, shows that we should not be too quick to assume that Congress intended, or\ncommanded by the language it wrote, that such a reasonable plan was being outlawed.\n        It is worth repeating that the plaintiff here, Mr. Lickteig, is already eligible for “normal”\nretirement benefits, based on his 17 years of service and his having attained the normal retirement\nage (55 for employees in hazardous jobs). What he (or rather, what the EEOC on his behalf) is\nattempting to do in this suit is to prevent employees who have been granted a form of insurance\nagainst disability at a pre-retirement age from obtaining that benefit.\n        Several examples show how the KRS plan does not differentiate based on age, but on age\nonly in relation to years of service.\n        1) Take two employees of the same age. One is 48 with 10 years of service, the other is 48\nwith 15 years of service. They both become disabled. The first employee gets 7 years of extra\ncredit, which takes him to age 55, and the second gets 5 years of extra credit, which takes him to 20\nyears of service, but in each case it is as if the employee had worked until eligibile for normal\nretirement.\n        2) Take two employees with the same service. One is 50 with 15 years of service. The\nsecond is 35 with 15 years of service. They both become disabled. They each get exactly the same\nadditional credit - 5 years - despite the difference in their ages, and with that additional credit, it is\nas if each had worked until eligible for normal retirement.\n\fNo. 03-6437           EEOC v. Jefferson County Sheriff’s Dep’t et al.                         Page 17\n\n\n        3) Take two employees with differing ages and years of service. The first is 45 with 10 years\nof service. The second is 40 with 17 years of service. They both become disabled. This time, the\nolder worker actually gets a greater benefit because he will get credit for all of the 10 years that\nwould bring him to the retirement age, whereas the younger worker will “max out” at the full 20\nyears of credit with only an additional 3 years of credit.\n        These examples demonstrate starkly that age is not a controlling variable in the operation of\nthe KRS plan. They also show that the plan provides in practice exactly what was claimed for it by\nappellees’ counsel in the argument before us: a way to insure against disability that is sensitive to\nthe greatest loss caused by disability–the inability to continue earning credits toward retirement at\na normal retirement age.\n        Many life insurance policies have a feature that if premiums are paid from the inception of\nthe policy to age 65, no further premium payments are required. Some also have a feature called\n“disability waiver of premiums”: if the policy holder becomes disabled, the insurance company will\nno longer collect premiums, in effect crediting the policyholder as though those premiums are being\npaid. Yet, on average, such a disability feature (which no one would contend constitutes age\ndiscrimination) works exactly like the KRS plan. The waiver feature is worth more to the person\nwho is disabled at 40 than one who is disabled at 60, because, on average, the waiver is in effect for\nmany more years. And one who is disabled after 65 receives no benefit at all, as the premium is\nalready fully paid up.\n        It is undisputed, and patently obvious from the nature of the KRS plan, that both the rationale\nand the effect of that plan is to insure that all employees have a reasonable prospect of employer-\nsponsored insurance against a disability that occurs before retirement income becomes available.\nOn average, if employee A is younger than employee B and both suffer the same disability at the\nsame time, A 1) will have had less time to earn money and retirement credit, and 2) will have more\nyears to live. The KRS plan is meant to, and does, ameliorate exactly the ways in which A and B\nare not similarly situated, by providing A with a “bonus” for the circumstances of the disability.\nThat “bonus” depends on years of service and years to normal retirement age. The bonus will often,\nbut not always, be larger for a younger worker than an older one. As the examples show, the bonus\nprovided to employees who become disabled can vary from no additional credit to as much as 10\nyears’ credit, in a fashion that may be correlated (just as pension status in Hazen Paper was\ncorrelated) with age, but far from perfectly.\n        The KRS plan has nothing whatever to do with “inaccurate and stigmatizing stereotypes”\nsurrounding the relative ability of older employees to do the job–that is to say, Congress’s reason\nfor enacting the ADEA, as the discussion above and the majority’s own analysis of the legislative\nhistory indicate (Maj. Op. pp. 6–7). There is no intimation in any part of the KRS plan of any\ndemeaning or inappropriate stereotyping of older workers. All employees who are considered\ndisabled under the KRS plan are equally unable to do their jobs–because of disability. The only\nfactor resembling consideration of the nature of aging that counsel for appellants could adduce at\noral argument was that some older employees might wish to work beyond normal retirement age (55\nfor hazardous employees, 65 for nonhazardous employees). But that does not differentiate between\nworkers who are now more advanced in years and those younger. All such workers may wish to\n(and, had they not become disabled, might have been able to) work beyond that normal retirement\nage. But any retirement plan must have criteria for qualification, and using age as one of the criteria\nhas never been thought to violate the ADEA. If KRS changed the plan to have a later retirement\nage, the mathematics of some of the computations would change, but the aspect being attacked here\nwould remain. Thus, it is clear that impermissible stereotyping had nothing to do with the age-\ncorrelated features of the plan that are involved here.\n\fNo. 03-6437           EEOC v. Jefferson County Sheriff’s Dep’t et al.                         Page 18\n\n\n        Under the KRS plan, the employee’s age in relation to his years of service with the employer\nfactors into retirement benefits calculations. The majority, by dubiously labeling that plan as\nfacially discriminatory under the ADEA, uses that statute to invalidate a policy that lies far from the\n“essence” of the ADEA–and, in fact, does not implicate that essence at all. Age in relation to years\nof service performed for this employer is not the same as age qua age. See Hazen Paper, 507 U.S.\nat 612 (the ADEA “requires the employer to ignore an employee’s age (absent a statutory exemption\nor defense); it does not specify further characteristics that an employer must also ignore.”).\n       There is a further problem with the majority’s analysis. As the Lyon court noted, in\nreasoning that applies at least as much to this case:\n       [The employer’s] very willingness to ignore ageist stereotypes and hire workers of\n       any age actually appears to have exacerbated plaintiff’s “problem.” Those most\n       “disadvantaged” are those who were oldest at the time of hiring. It would be\n       contrary to the letter, as well as the spirit, of the ADEA to penalize the employer for\n       the incidental ramifications of objectivity.\n53 F.3d at 140 n.6. Here, the older workers “discriminated against” are sometimes exactly those\nwho were hired later in life, and thus had not accumulated as many years with this employer as a\nyounger worker (although, as example 3 shows (supra, at 17), sometimes exactly this factor will\ngive the later-hired older worker an advantage). Thus, I believe that neither the intent nor the letter\nof the ADEA bars the reasonable KRS retirement plan, and I respectfully dissent.\n\f",

Plaintiff-Appellant the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission (“EEOC”) brings this public-enforcement age-discrimination lawsuit\nagainst Defendants-Appellees the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Department, the Kentucky Retirement\nSystems, and the Commonwealth of Kentucky (referred to collectively as “KRS”), alleging that\nKRS’s disability-retirement-benefits plan for state and county employees violates the Age\nDiscrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq., as amended by the Older\nWorkers Benefit Protection Act (“OWBPA”), Pub. Law 101-433, 104 Stat. 978 (1990). The KRS\ndisability-retirement-benefits plan (hereinafter “The KRS plan”) disqualifies employees who are still\nworking from receiving disability-retirement benefits if they have already reached normal\nretirement-benefit age at the time they become disabled. The KRS plan also calculates disability-\nretirement benefits in such a way that an older employee who is eligible to receive disability benefits\nreceives fewer benefits — in the form of lower monthly benefit payments — than a younger disabled\nemployee receiving disability-retirement benefits who is similar to the older disabled employee in\nevery relevant factor other than age.\n        Both the district court and the original panel of this court concluded that pursuant to Lyon\nv.

Lyon concluded that a retirement plan\nthat used age as a factor to determine benefits in a materially indistinguishable manner to the way\nthat age is used in the KRS plan did not establish a prima facie violation of the ADEA despite the\nfact that older workers received lower benefits because of their age. Lyon held that in addition to\ndemonstrating disparate treatment on the basis of age, a plaintiff needed to produce evidence of\ndiscriminatory animus against older people in order to survive the employer’s summary-judgment\nmotion.\n        After reviewing the parties’ arguments and the relevant law, we conclude that the EEOC has\nestablished a prima facie violation of the ADEA, because the KRS plan is facially discriminatory\non the basis of age. Supreme Court authority on disparate-treatment-discrimination claims as well\nas the persuasive authority of many of the other circuits and the history of the ADEA (as amended\nby the OWBPA) demonstrate that KRS is not entitled to summary judgment. We further hold that\nwhen an employment policy or benefit plan such as the KRS plan is facially discriminatory, a\nplaintiff challenging that policy does not need additional proof of discriminatory animus in order\nto establish a prima facie disparate-treatment claim. Upon en banc review, we conclude that Lyon’s\nstandard for a disparate-treatment age-discrimination claim is inconsistent with Supreme Court\nauthority as well as the rulings of several of our sister circuits in cases involving the similar role of\nage in employee-benefit plans. We therefore overrule in part our previous decision in Lyon.\n       Because we conclude that the EEOC has established a prima facie claim of age\ndiscrimination, we REVERSE the district court’s grant of summary judgment to KRS on the\nEEOC’s age-discrimination claim and REMAND the case to the district court for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                         I. BACKGROUND\n        The dispute that led to this lawsuit began when Charles Lickteig, who was at the time a\nDeputy Sheriff with the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Department, was denied disability-retirement\nbenefits under the KRS plan because of his age. Because Lickteig’s job as a Deputy Sheriff was\n\fNo. 03-6437               EEOC v. Jefferson County Sheriff’s Dep’t et al.                                      Page 3\n\n\nconsidered hazardous, Lickteig became eligible for normal retirement benefits at age 55,1 but he\nchose to continue working past that date because he had school-age children to support. Joint\nAppendix (“J.A.”) at 49 (Lickteig Aff. ¶ 11). In 1995, Lickteig, who had worked as a Deputy\nSheriff since 1978, became disabled due to “a deteriorating vertebra[], arthritis, nerve damage, and\nParkinson’s disease” to the point that he could no longer perform his Deputy Sheriff duties. J.A. at\n48 (Lickteig Aff. ¶¶ 4, 6). In July 1995, at age sixty-one and with seventeen years and seven months\nworth of service, Lickteig applied for disability-retirement benefits under the KRS plan. J.A. at 42\n(William Hanes Aff. ¶ 3); J.A. at 49 (Lickteig Aff. ¶ 7). In a letter dated August 25, 1995,\ndefendants notified Lickteig that his request for disability-retirement benefits had been denied\nbecause of his age. In its denial letter, KRS explained:\n         Our laws state that you must have at least 60 months of service credit, be under age\n         55, and apply within 12 months of your last day of paid employment in a regular full-\n         time position to qualify for Disability Retirement. Therefore, you are not eligible to\n         apply for Disability Retirement since you are over age 55 and in a hazardous\n         position.\nJ.A. at 51 (Lickteig Denial Letter). As a result of the denial of his request for disability-retirement\nbenefits, Lickteig filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC in February 1996, alleging that\ndefendants illegally denied him the benefits because of his age. J.A. at 57-59 (EEOC Charges). The\nEEOC began investigating Lickteig’s charges and eventually concluded that the KRS plan violated\nthe ADEA.\n         The material aspects of the KRS plan are as follows. First, the KRS plan provides two types\nof retirement benefits — normal retirement benefits and disability-retirement benefits. Employees\nlike Lickteig who work in hazardous positions are eligible for normal retirement benefits at age fifty-\nfive or after completing twenty years of service, whereas an employee working in a nonhazardous\nposition is eligible for normal retirement benefits at age sixty-five. The EEOC is not challenging\nthe KRS plan provisions for normal retirement benefits for either class of employees, but rather only\nthe plan’s provision of disability-retirement benefits. As Lickteig is a hazardous-category employee,\nthe district court and the original hearing panel of our court analyzed only the disability-retirement\nplan’s impact upon employees in hazardous positions, and we do the same. We note, however, that\nour holding is equally applicable to KRS’s treatment of employees in nonhazardous positions to the\nextent that the disability-retirement plan utilizes age in a materially indistinguishable way in the\nprovision of disability-retirement benefits to employees in nonhazardous positions.\n      The EEOC argues that the KRS plan’s provisions of disability-retirement benefits violates\nthe ADEA because the plan “denies benefits or pays reduced benefits, because of age.” J.A. at 21\n(Compl. at 1). As the original hearing panel of our court explained:\n         The [KRS disability-retirement benefits] scheme appears to disadvantage older\n         workers by virtue of the fact that a class of workers, determined in significant part\n         by age (actually youth), gets unworked years attributed to them for purposes of\n         calculating the amount of disability retirement. When workers are disabled after they\n         become eligible for normal retirement, they receive only normal retirement benefits.\n         The amount of the yearly benefits is generally calculated as 2.5% of the employee’s\n         final compensation times the number of years worked. However, for employees who\n\n         1\n           As the original panel of this court explained, under the KRS retirement system, “[a]n employee in a hazardous\nposition is eligible to receive normal retirement benefits at age 55, or with twenty years of service, Ky. Rev. Stat.\n§§ 16.576, 16.577(2), 61.592(4), 78.545(31), whereas an employee in a nonhazardous position is eligible to receive\nnormal retirement benefits at age 65. Ky. Rev. Stat. § 61.510(18).” EEOC v.

The\n       number of years added is the number of years remaining until the worker would have\n       reached either normal retirement age or twenty years of service, but no more than the\n       number of years already worked. The purpose appears to be to give a disabled\n       worker the amount of benefit he would have been entitled to had he worked until\n       normal retirement, notwithstanding the fact that he had not actually worked those\n       additional years.\n               Under this scheme, disability retirement benefits will often be greater than\n       normal retirement benefits for employees with the same years of service (but less\n       than twenty years of service) and the same final compensation. The employee who\n       receives normal retirement benefits will be entitled to 2.5% of his final compensation\n       times his actual service years, whereas the employee who will receive disability\n       retirement benefits will receive the same 2.5% of his final compensation, but will\n       have it multiplied by a number that is higher than his actual years of service, leading\n       to a higher benefit. Moreover, disability benefits will be greater for workers who\n       become entitled to disability retirement at a younger age with the same number of\n       years of service.\nEEOC v. Jefferson County Sheriff’s Dep’t, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791994\"><a href=\"/opinion/791994/equal-employment-opportunity-commission-v-jefferson-county-sheriffs/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 469-70 (6th Cir. 2005) (footnotes omitted),\nvacated on grant of reh’g en banc (2006).\n        In addition, a hazardous-category employee eligible for the disability-retirement-benefit plan\nwho is injured in the line of duty is guaranteed monthly benefits of at least 25% of monthly final rate\nof pay, and if the employee has dependent children, she receives a dependent-child benefit of 10%\nof monthly final rate of pay for each child, up to a maximum for all dependent children of 40% of\nmonthly final rate of pay. KY. REV. STAT. ANN. § 16.582(6). The parties do not dispute that an\notherwise-identical employee who becomes disabled in the line of duty but because of her age at the\ntime of disability is ineligible for disability-retirement benefits could not receive these additional\ndependent benefits.\n        The EEOC has provided charts demonstrating the impact of an employee’s age on her\ndisability-retirement-benefit amount in its brief. EEOC Br. at 14, 16. These charts illustrate, and\ndefendants do not dispute, that:\n       assuming every factor, other than age, that is relevant to determine an employee’s\n       benefits (i.e., type of position, disabling condition, final compensation, and length\n       of service) is identical, the amount paid annually to a worker who retires on\n       disability at a younger age will frequently exceed (and will never be less than) the\n       annual benefits of a worker who retires due to disability at an older age.\nEEOC Br. at 16-17. Additionally, the EEOC argues, and defendants do not dispute, that:\n       In every case, a worker younger than normal retirement age (55/65) who retires on\n       disability will receive more benefits each year than an older employee who retires\n       from the same job, with the same disabling condition, length of service, and final\n       compensation, who becomes disabled after reaching 55/65 and must take normal\n       retirement.\nEEOC Br. at 16.\n\fNo. 03-6437               EEOC v. Jefferson County Sheriff’s Dep’t et al.                                         Page 5\n\n\n       The EEOC challenges both the 1998 and the 2000 versions of the Kentucky statute\ngoverning the KRS plan.2 See EEOC Br. at 7-8 (explaining challenged aspects of both the pre-2000\nand 2000 versions of the KRS plan); id. at A-2 (excerpting portions of the pre-2000 and 2000\nversions of the statute). The original panel explained the key differences between the 1998 and 2000\nversions of the statute:\n         Prior to July 2000, an employee was not eligible to receive disability retirement\n         benefits unless he was “less than normal retirement age.” Ky.Rev.Stat.\n         § 16.582(2)(b) (1999), Ky.Rev.Stat. § 61.600(1)(b) (1999). After this litigation\n         began, the provisions were amended, and currently provide that an employee is not\n         eligible for retirement disability benefits if the employee is “eligible for an\n         unreduced retirement allowance.” Ky.Rev.Stat. § 16.582(2)(b) (2001) (effective July\n         14, 2000); see 2000 Ky. Acts 385, at *4. Under both versions, an employee who is\n         55 or older cannot receive disability retirement benefits. In addition, under the\n         current version, an employee who became eligible to receive normal retirement\n         benefits by virtue of having 20 years of service also could not receive disability\n         retirement benefits.\nEEOC v. Jefferson County, 424 F.3d at 469 n.1. The EEOC explains that it is not challenging the\nexclusion of this latter group of employees — those rendered ineligible for disability-retirement\nbenefits because of their years of service, rather than their age. The EEOC only “seeks relief for\nindividuals who, because of age, were excluded from disability retirement, or applied for disability\nretirement and have received fewer annual benefits, since October 16, 1992,” which is the enactment\ndate of the OWBPA. EEOC Reply Br. at 27; see also EEOC Br. at 34.\n        In the fall of 1998, the EEOC and KRS attempted to conciliate this dispute, but the parties\ncould not reach an agreement. J.A. at 60-62 (Marcia Hall-Craig Aff.). On August 2, 1999, the\nEEOC filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky,\nalleging that the KRS plan illegally discriminates on the basis of age in violation of the ADEA. J.A.\nat 21-23 (Compl. ¶¶ 1-12). KRS filed a motion to dismiss the suit on Tenth and Eleventh\nAmendment immunity grounds. After the district court denied defendants’ motion to dismiss, a\npanel of our court affirmed that decision, holding that, with one exception, the Tenth and Eleventh\nAmendments do not shield KRS from the EEOC’s age-discrimination suit. EEOC v. Ky. Ret. Sys.,\n16 F. App’x 443, 453 (6th Cir. 2001). After the case was remanded to the district court, both the\nEEOC and KRS moved for summary judgment. The district court granted summary judgment for\ndefendants, concluding that pursuant to our reasoning in Lyon, discriminatory intent was necessary\nto establish a prima facie case of age discrimination in a disparate-treatment claim. J.A. at 32-33\n(Dist. Ct. Op. at 4-5). The district court recognized that intent could be inferred from a facially\ndiscriminatory policy, but found that the KRS plan was not facially discriminatory, and thus\nconcluded that the EEOC had not alleged a valid disparate-treatment ADEA claim. The EEOC filed\na timely notice of appeal.\n       Although suggesting concerns regarding the soundness of Lyon’s reasoning, the original\nhearing panel of our court deemed itself bound by the Lyon decision and affirmed, holding that\n“[b]ecause the retirement plan at issue in this case is materially indistinguishable from the early\n\n\n         2\n            We will therefore confine our analysis to the 1998 and 2000 versions of the statute. We note, however, that\nthe Kentucky Legislature again revised the KRS plan in 2004. The 2004 revision retained the age-based eligibility\nrequirements of the 2000 version, but altered the calculation of disability-retirement benefits. For members beginning\nto participate on or after August 1, 2004, disability-retirement pay is calculated to be “the higher of twenty-five percent\n(25%) of the member’s monthly final rate of pay or the retirement allowance determined in the same manner as for\nretirement at his normal retirement date with years of service and final compensation being determined as of the date\nof his disability.” KY. REV. STAT. ANN. § 16.582(5)(b).\n\fNo. 03-6437               EEOC v. Jefferson County Sheriff’s Dep’t et al.

The EEOC\npetitioned for rehearing en banc, arguing that the KRS plan is facially discriminatory, and that the\nCommission has therefore established a prima facie claim of age discrimination. The EEOC also\nurges us to overrule Lyon to the extent that Lyon holds that a plaintiff challenging a facially\ndiscriminatory employment policy must have proof that the policy was motivated by discriminatory\nanimus against older workers in order to state a prima facie violation of the ADEA.\n                                                   II. ANALYSIS\n        We begin with a discussion of the origins of the ADEA, as the history of the Act informs our\nanalysis of the issues raised in this case. Congress considered including age as a protected class\nwhen it was debating and drafting Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but declined to do so\nbecause of concerns that employers might sometimes have a legitimate basis for making age-related\nemployment decisions.

In\norder to determine whether Congressional action to address age discrimination was necessary and\nto understand better what type of legislation might remedy the existing problems, Congress\nrequested that then-Secretary of Labor Willard Wirtz conduct “a full and complete study of the\nfactors which might tend to result in discrimination in employment because of age and of the\nconsequences of such discrimination on the economy and individuals affected.” Smith v. City of\nJackson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142883\"><a href=\"/opinion/142883/smith-v-city-of-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 232 (2005) (quoting Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Pub. L. No.\n88-352, § 715, 78 Stat. 265 (1964)).\n        The Secretary of Labor’s report, submitted to Congress in June 1965, concluded that age\ndiscrimination was sufficiently widespread that it warranted public concern, but that the nature of\nage discrimination was quite different from discrimination based upon the classes protected by Title\nVII. U.S. SECRETARY OF LABOR, THE OLDER AMERICAN WORKER: AGE DISCRIMINATION IN\nEMPLOYMENT 5-6 (June 1965), reprinted in U.S. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION,\nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF THE AGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT ACT 22-23 (1981) (hereinafter\n“Wirtz Report”). “Because the ADEA was modeled on the Wirtz Report’s findings and\nrecommendations, the Report provides critical insights into the statute’s meaning.” Smith, 544 U.S.\nat 254 (O’Connor, J., concurring in the judgment). The Wirtz Report concluded “that there was little\ndiscrimination arising from dislike or intolerance of older people, but that ‘arbitrary’ discrimination\ndid result from certain age limits.” Id. at 232 (majority opinion). The Report stated that it had\n“found no evidence of prejudice based on dislike or intolerance of the older worker,” and that\n“intolerance, of such overriding importance in the case of attitudes toward other groups, assumes\nminimal importance in the case of older people and older workers.” Wirtz Report at 6. Despite\nfinding a lack of discriminatory animus against older people, Secretary Wirtz found “substantial\nevidence of arbitrary” age discrimination. Id. at 5. Secretary Wirtz defined arbitrary3 age\ndiscrimination as “assumptions about the effect of age on [an employee’s] ability to do a job when\nthere is in fact no basis for these assumptions.” Id. at 2. The Report explains that a common form\nof arbitrary age discrimination at that time was the refusal of employers to hire individuals for\npositions once they had reached a certain age, without any actual relevance to the particular\nposition’s job requirements. Id. at 6-8.\n\n\n         3\n            The Supreme Court has largely adopted the Wirtz Report’s definition of “arbitrary” age discrimination in its\nADEA jurisprudence. In General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline, the Court stated that the ADEA’s terms\n“arbitrary limits” and “arbitrary age discrimination” “are unmistakable references to the Wirtz Report’s finding” that age\nceilings in hiring were at the time widespread. 540 U.S. at 590. “The ADEA’s ban on ‘arbitrary limits’ thus applies to\nage caps that exclude older applicants, necessarily to the advantage of younger ones.” Id. Similarly, in her concurrence\nin Smith v. City of Jackson, Justice O’Connor read the Wirtz Report’s definition of “arbitrary” as “clearly equat[ing] with\ndisparate treatment” and as treatment on the basis of age that is “intentional and unfounded.” Smith, 544 U.S. at 255\n(O’Connor, J., concurring in the judgment).\n\fNo. 03-6437           EEOC v. Jefferson County Sheriff’s Dep’t et al.                         Page 7\n\n\n         The Wirtz Report inspired Congress to request that the Secretary draft proposed legislation\nto combat age discrimination, and after that was completed, Congress “acted favorably on his\nproposal” and enacted the ADEA. Smith, 544 U.S. at 232-33. In 1967, Congress enacted the\nADEA, which now renders it “unlawful for an employer (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge\nany individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,\nterms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s age;” as well as “(2)\nto limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\nindividual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee,\nbecause of such individual’s age.” 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1)-(2).\n        In this case, the EEOC urges us to conclude that it has established a prima facie claim of age\ndiscrimination because the KRS plan facially discriminates against older employees in two ways:\n(1) the KRS plan renders employees ineligible for disability-retirement benefits simply because of\ntheir age, which means that disabled workers who are ineligible for disability benefits because of\ntheir age receive lower (normal) retirement benefits than otherwise-similar younger workers who\nbecome disabled and are able to receive the greater disability-retirement benefits, and (2) the KRS\nplan uses an employee’s age in order to calculate disability-retirement benefits in such a way that\nan older eligible employee receives lower monthly disability-benefit payments than an otherwise-\nsimilar younger disabled worker.\n        Defendants argue that, contrary to the EEOC’s assertion, the KRS plan does not violate the\nADEA because the policy does not discriminate “because of age.” KRS Br. at 10. Rather,\ndefendants argue, the KRS plan merely uses age as one of several factors to determine benefits, in\nthe same way that age is a factor in many, if not most, retirement-benefit plans. See KRS Br. at 13.\nDefendants also assert that a valid disparate-treatment claim requires a plaintiff to establish proof\nof discriminatory motive, and that “[t]here is no evidence that the [KRS plan] framework established\nto provide benefits to disabled members of Kentucky Retirement was in any fashion age-driven.”\nKRS Br. at 26-27.\n        We consider first the EEOC’s argument that it has established a prima facie ADEA claim\nbecause the KRS disability-retirement-benefits plan is facially discriminatory. We then assess\nKRS’s argument that even if the KRS plan is facially discriminatory, the EEOC must produce\nevidence that the plan was motivated by discriminatory animus against older people in order to\nsustain its prima facie burden.\nA. The EEOC Has Established a Prima Facie ADEA Claim Because the KRS Plan Facially\n   Discriminates on the Basis of Age\n        The Supreme Court has made clear that an employer’s reliance “upon a formal, facially\ndiscriminatory policy requiring adverse treatment of employees with that [protected] trait”\nestablishes a prima facie disparate-treatment claim under the ADEA.

First, like the transfer plan in Thurston, the\nKRS plan categorically excludes still-working employees over age fifty-five from a particular\nemployment benefit because of their age. In order to be eligible for disability-retirement benefits,\nemployees in hazardous positions must become disabled before they reach age fifty-five. There is\nabsolutely no dispute that under the KRS plan, when such an employee becomes disabled at age\nfifty-five or older, that older employee is adversely treated because of his or her age when compared\nto a disabled coworker who is similarly situated in all relevant aspects other than age. On its face,\nthis age-eligibility aspect of the KRS plan mandates disparate treatment of disabled employees on\nthe basis of age. Defendants’ decision to render employees in hazardous positions ineligible for\ndisability-retirement benefits simply because they have reached normal retirement age is “a formal,\nfacially discriminatory policy” that discriminates on the basis of age, which is sufficient to establish\na prima facie ADEA violation. Hazen Paper, 507 U.S. at 610.\n        The KRS plan is facially discriminatory in a second way, in that KRS employees who\nbecome disabled when they are still “young enough” to be eligible for disability-retirement benefits\nreceive reduced benefits compared to otherwise-similar but even younger disabled employees for\nno reason other than their age. KRS does not dispute that its plan pays lower disability-retirement\nbenefits to an older worker who, apart from age, is similarly situated to a younger worker in all\nrelevant respects. An employee’s age, therefore, “actually play[s] a role in” and has “a\ndeterminative influence on the outcome” of the amount a disabled employee’s disability-retirement-\nbenefit payment is each month. Hazen Paper, 507 U.S. at 610. This is a second way that the KRS\nplan, on its face, requires disparate treatment on the basis of age. See id. at 609 (stating that\ndisparate treatment occurs when “[t]he employer simply treats some people less favorably than\nothers because of their” protected trait) (quoting Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters v.

The KRS plan’s\ndisqualification of employees age fifty-five and over for disability benefits closely resembles the\ncharacteristic of the plan in Betts that the Supreme Court found to be facially discriminatory. See\n\n\n         4\n            Interestingly, the Supreme Court in Manhart rejected the defendant’s argument that plaintiffs must produce\nactuarial evidence that the facially discriminatory policy actually had a discriminatory effect on women as a class, and\nheld that the absence of this effect-evidence did not defeat plaintiffs’ successful disparate-treatment claim based upon\nthe facially discriminatory nature of the policy. Manhart, 435 U.S. at 716.\n         5\n           Although Lyon involved a challenge to the use of age in the determination of the amount of early retirement\nbenefits, we agree with the original hearing panel in this case that the role that age played in the plan at issue in Lyon\n“is not materially distinguishable” from the role that age plays in the KRS plan. EEOC v. Jefferson County, 424 F.3d\nat 471. Both plans compute the disputed benefits in such a way that the employee’s age is the determinative factor in\nthe calculation of the benefit amount, with an older employee receiving lower benefits than an otherwise-similar younger\nemployee.

Law 101-433, § 101, 104\nStat. 978 (1990) (codified at 29 U.S.C. § 621).\n        The original panel in this case considered Betts and the legislative history of the OWBPA.\nEEOC v. Jefferson County, 424 F.3d at 474-75. Nevertheless, the original panel ultimately\ndetermined that it was unable to distinguish Lyon on that ground because the same legislative\nmaterial was available to the Lyon panel. Id. (citing, inter alia, excerpts of the final debate about\nthe OWBPA stating that “[t]he bill provides that workers who are on disability cannot be forced to\nreceive only their pension at retirement age” and that under the OWBPA, “they will receive the\ndifference between what is typically a lower pension benefit and the higher disability benefit”). We\nbelieve that this legislative history is compelling evidence that when revising the ADEA in response\nto Betts, Congress intended to prohibit the very sort of age-based discrimination that the original\npanel, bound by Lyon, condoned in this plan.\n         That many of our sister circuits have reached conclusions contrary to Lyon lends further\nsupport for our conclusion that Lyon’s definition of a prima facie ADEA claim can no longer stand.\nSince Lyon was decided, the Second, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits have each recognized a\nprima facie ADEA violation in analogous situations.

The EEOC Need Not Provide Additional Proof of Discriminatory Animus, As\n   Discriminatory Intent Is Evidenced by the Facially Discriminatory Nature of the KRS\n   Plan\n          KRS argues that defendants are entitled to summary judgment because the EEOC has not\nprovided any proof that KRS enacted the disability-retirement-benefits plan because of a\ndiscriminatory animus against older workers. Unfortunately for KRS, this argument runs contrary\nto Supreme Court authority and the history and purpose of the ADEA. Once a plaintiff has\nestablished that a policy is facially discriminatory in that it classifies or disadvantages an employee\n“because of” the employee’s protected status, additional proof of discriminatory intent is not needed,\nas it is directly evidenced by the facially discriminatory nature of the policy itself.

Johnson Controls explained:\n         [T]he absence of a malevolent motive does not convert a facially discriminatory\n         policy into a neutral policy with a discriminatory effect. Whether an employment\n         practice involves disparate treatment through explicit facial discrimination does not\n         depend on why the employer discriminates but rather on the explicit terms of the\n         discrimination.\nThe Supreme Court reaffirmed this approach in Hazen Paper, stating that evidence of intent to\ndiscriminate necessary for a disparate-treatment claim “can in some situations be inferred from the\nmere fact of differences in treatment.” 507 U.S. at 609 (internal quotation marks omitted).

See Lyon, 53 F.3d at 139 (stating that plaintiffs have not “alleged that [defendants were]\naware of a disparate effect on older employees, such that we could infer intent from knowledge.”).\nLyon later uses language, however,    that contradicts not only this earlier recognition but also the\nabove Supreme Court precedent.6 See id. (“Plaintiffs try to cure their lack of evidence of intent by\ninferring discriminatory animus on the basis of a disparate effect on older workers. This is circular,\nand would render meaningless the carefully-wrought distinction between disparate-impact and\ndisparate-treatment theories of discrimination . . . .”). The original hearing panel in this case\nsuggested persuasively that discriminatory “[i]ntent arguably should be inferred from the employer’s\nknowledge concerning its own [retirement] plan,” but continued that “[s]uch an argument is,\nhowever, foreclosed by Lyon.” EEOC v. Jefferson County, 424 F.3d at 473. The panel continued\nin its criticism of Lyon, explaining why Lyon’s requirement that a plaintiff alleging disparate\ntreatment must produce additional evidence of a defendant’s discriminatory animus where the\nchallenged employment action consists of a benefits plan is misguided because “the only action that\nwill ever be taken in cases involving retirement plans — as opposed to individual adverse actions\n— is the action of writing the policy.” Id. We agree, and we hold that an employer’s intent to\ndiscriminate is directly evidenced by the employer’s writing or adoption of a facially discriminatory\nemployment policy.\n       Finally, KRS’s argument that the only disparate treatment on the basis of age that the ADEA\nwas designed to remedy is disparate treatment motivated by discriminatory animus against the old\nis nonsensical considering the origins of the ADEA. The Wirtz Report, which inspired Congress\nto enact the ADEA, found “no evidence of prejudice based on dislike or intolerance of the older\n\n\n         6\n            The language in Hazen Paper upon which defendants, the district court, and the panel in Lyon appear to rely\nfor their belief that additional proof of discriminatory motive is required is Hazen Paper’s statement that “a disparate\ntreatment claim cannot succeed unless the employee’s protected trait actually played a role in [the employer’s decision-\nmaking process] and had a determinative influence on the outcome.” Hazen Paper, 507 U.S. at 610 (emphasis added).\nA closer analysis of Hazen Paper belies defendants’ argument. Immediately before making this statement, the Court\nin Hazen Paper gave examples of ways in which the protected trait could actually motivate an employer’s decision and\ntherefore constitute disparate treatment. With citations to its previous decisions in Thurston and Manhart, the Court gave\nas its first example “a formal, facially discriminatory policy requiring adverse treatment of employees with that\n[protected] trait.” Id. It is therefore evident that the Hazen Paper language that defendants and Lyon cling to in an\nattempt to argue that Hazen Paper added an additional requirement of discriminatory animus was simply the Court’s\nsummary statement to describe the various circumstances that can constitute intentional action sufficient to support a\nviable disparate-treatment claim.\n\fNo. 03-6437          EEOC v.

Despite the absence of discriminatory animus against older workers,\nCongress enacted the ADEA to fight arbitrary age discrimination, which Secretary Wirtz defined\nas age-based assumptions that lacked a basis in fact. Id. at 2. Thus for KRS’s interpretation of the\nAct to be correct, it would mean that in passing the ADEA, Congress intended to prohibit only a\ntype of age discrimination that it had been advised did not exist. We will not interpret the ADEA\nso narrowly and illogically.\n        There is simply no dispute that under the KRS plan, an employee’s age actually plays a role\nin the defendants’ decision-making process about what amount, if any, of disability-retirement\nbenefits an employee receives, and that age therefore has a “determinative influence on the\noutcome” for the disabled older employee. Hazen Paper, 507 U.S. at 610. The KRS plan excludes\nhazardous-category employees age fifty-five and over from receiving disability-retirement benefits,\nand pays reduced benefits to older eligible disabled workers compared to their younger counterparts\nbecause of their age.

CONCLUSION\n        The EEOC has established a prima facie case of age discrimination because it has\ndemonstrated that the KRS plan facially discriminates on the basis of age. No evidence of\ndiscriminatory animus is needed, as intent to discriminate on the basis of age is directly evidenced\nby the facially discriminatory nature of the KRS plan.

I concur in the result, generally for the reasons\nexpressed in the majority opinion. The following four concerns, however, prevent my concurring\nin that opinion.\n         First, the retirement plans at issue in this case discriminate in only one way rather than two.\nThe majority's description of the first way in which the KRS plan discriminates is significant only\nas it constitutes a part of the second way. That is, it is not facial discrimination to give older workers\none kind of retirement plan and younger workers the same plan with a different name. The only real\ndifference between disability retirement and normal retirement is the one caused by the “second”\ndiscriminatory characteristic. That is, if the retirement plans were called by the same name, there\nwould be no age discrimination other than that arising from the attribution of unworked years (or\nmore unworked years) based on age. If that discrimination were cured, on the other hand, the “first”\nway in which the KRS plan discriminates would be semantic only.\n       Second, in my view it is unnecessary for the en banc court to characterize the panel opinion’s\ntreatment of our court’s opinion in Lyon. The panel opinion, available as it is in the Federal\nReporter, speaks for itself, and in any event the panel opinion has been vacated.\n        Third, it is only necessary for us to overrule Lyon to the extent that Lyon is inconsistent with\nour en banc holding and reasoning. I would leave to future litigants the task of going through Lyon\nand identifying what survives and what does not.\n         Finally, we should make clear that in this case we take no position on whether the result in\nLyon can be supported by the early retirement exception to ADEA liability, 29 U.S.C.\n§ 623(f)(2)(B)(ii). The district court in Lyon granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants\nafter finding that the plaintiffs had failed to establish a prima facie disparate-treatment claim and,\nalternatively, that the retirement plan at issue constituted a lawful early retirement incentive plan\npursuant to § 623(f)(2)(B)(ii). 53 F.3d at 137. Our court in Lyon did not reach the latter issue\nbecause it agreed with the district court regarding the plaintiffs’ prima facie case. Id.\n\fNo. 03-6437             EEOC v.

The majority concludes that the disability-retirement plan\nof the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Department, Kentucky Retirement Systems, and the\nCommonwealth of Kentucky (collectively referred to as “KRS”) amounts to a facial violation of the\nAge Discrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq., as amended by the\nOlder Workers Benefits Protection Act (“OWBPA”), P. Law 101-433, 104 Stat. 978 (1990). I\nbelieve that a careful examination of the plan shows that it considers age only in combination with\nyears of service and years to retirement age, and is a non-discriminatory way of providing workers\nwith protection against disability before they have had an opportunity to earn a normal pension at\nretirement age. It therefore is not illegal under the Supreme Court’s precedent in Hazen Paper Co.\nv.

In discussing the ADEA in Hazen Paper, the\nSupreme Court emphasized the distinction between the disparate treatment and disparate impact\ntheories of employment discrimination. 507 U.S. at 609. The Court stated that under a disparate\ntreatment theory, “[t]he employer simply treats some people less favorably than others because of\ntheir race, color, religion [or other protected characteristics.] Proof of discriminatory motive is\ncritical, although it can in some situations be inferred from the mere fact of differences in\ntreatment. . . . ” Ibid.

The employer “may have relied upon a formal, facially discriminatory policy\nrequiring adverse treatment of employees with that trait,” ibid. (citing Thurston, supra, and Los\nAngeles Dep’t of Water & Power v. Manhart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109834\"><a href=\"/opinion/109834/los-angeles-dept-of-water-and-power-v-manhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">702</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 704-18 (1978)), or “may have been\nmotivated by the protected trait on an ad hoc, informal basis.” Ibid. “Whatever the employer’s\ndecisionmaking process,” the Court noted, “a disparate treatment claim cannot succeed unless the\nemployee’s protected trait actually played a role in that process and had a determinative influence\non the outcome.” Ibid. (emphases added).\n       Defined in that way, the Court added, disparate treatment “captures the essence of what\nCongress sought to prohibit in the ADEA. It is the very essence of age discrimination for an older\nemployee to be fired because the employer believes that productivity and competence decline with\nold age.” Ibid. “Congress’ promulgation of the ADEA was prompted by its concern that older\nworkers were being deprived of employment on the basis of inaccurate and stigmatizing\n\n\n        1\n           “‘[C]ompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment’ encompasses all employee benefits,\nincluding such benefits provided pursuant to a bona fide employee benefit plan.” 29 U.S.C. § 630(l).\n\fNo. 03-6437               EEOC v.

This type of stereotyping is nowhere found in the plan under consideration\ntoday.\n         In Hazen Paper, the Court addressed the question of whether an employer’s firing an\nemployee whose pension was shortly to vest violated the ADEA where the vesting of the pension\nwas based exclusively on years of service. The Court held that although pension status is typically\ncorrelated with age, and although it is perhaps true that “older employees of Hazen Paper are more\nlikely to be ‘close to vesting’ than younger employees,” age and years of service were nevertheless\nanalytically distinct. If the employer fired the employee because of pension status, not because of\nage, “[t]he prohibited stereotype (‘Older employees are likely to be ___’) would not have figured\nin this decision, and the attendant stigma would not ensue.” Such conduct would not violate the\nADEA, the Court held. 507 U.S. at 611-12. (The Court ultimately remanded for a determination\nof whether the firing had in fact been based on age rather than on years of service. Id. at 613.) In\nshort, the Supreme Court held that, under the ADEA, companies could make a decision based solely\non the need to save money, even if that decision bore more heavily, on average, on older workers,\nso long as the factor relied on was only correlated with age, not determined by age. In our case, with\nmuch less base motives, the KRS plan is impacted by age only in relation to years of service and\nyears remaining until normal retirement age, as shown by the examples given on pages 16 and 17,\ninfra.\n        Thurston, an ADEA case cited by the Supreme Court in Hazen Paper as one in which the\nemployer’s formal, facially discriminatory policy showed intent to discriminate against older\nemployees because of their age, fits comfortably within the “very essence” of the ADEA as\ndiscussed by the Court in Hazen Paper. In Thurston, TWA had adopted a policy by which captains\nwho were disqualified from serving in that capacity for reasons other than age were allowed to\ntransfer to the position of flight engineer, and in the process to “bump” less senior flight engineers.\nPilots who were going to be disqualified from continuing to serve as captains because they had\nreached the age of 60, however, had to resort to bidding procedures in order to become a flight\nengineer, and if the procedures did not result in a flight engineer position, the captain had to retire\nat 60. 469 U.S. at 115-17, 120. Under the TWA policy, the following results would obtain. Captain\nA is disqualified from continuing to serve as captain because he is found to be incompetent. Captain\nB is nearing age 60. They are otherwise similarly situated. Captain A is allowed to transfer to the\nposition of flight engineer and bump less-senior flight engineers in the process, id. at 117; Captain\nB is not. The Court found that the policy, under which “the method of transfer available to a\ndisqualified captain depends upon his age,” was “discriminatory on its face,” and therefore\namounted to direct evidence of age discrimination in violation of the ADEA. Id. at 121-22. The\nThurston case is thus an example of a forbidden policy that, in fact, implicates a stigmatizing and\ninaccurate stereotype–that pilots over age 60 are less capable, or at least less valuable as employees,\neven than younger workers who have been relieved for incompetence.\n         TWA’s policy clearly embodied the “essence” of what the ADEA sought to prohibit–that is,\narbitrary age discrimination. That is not the case with the KRS disability-retirement plan, nor was\nit the case with the early-retirement policy in Lyon v. Ohio Education Ass’n and Prof’l Staff Union,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"694630\"><a href=\"/opinion/694630/james-lyon-james-e-romick-v-ohio-education-association-and-professional/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">135</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 1995). Here, and in Lyon, no such stereotype is implicated.\n        The majority contends that there are two ways in which the KRS plan facially discriminates\nagainst older employees.  First, workers with less than 20 years of service time (for employees in\nhazardous positions2) who become disabled before a certain age (in the case of employees in\nhazardous positions, 55) receive additional credit toward retirement, while those over normal\n\n         2\n          I follow the convention of the parties, the original panel, and the majority of this en banc court, by referring\nto the KRS plan for employees in hazardous positions, although the analysis applies to the plan for employees in non-\nhazardous positions as well.\n\fNo. 03-6437                EEOC v.

The amount of the yearly benefits is\n         generally calculated as 2.5% of the employee’s final compensation times the number\n         of years worked. However, for employees who are not yet eligible for normal\n         retirement (i.e., employees under age 55 and with fewer than 20 years of service),\n         additional years are added to the number of years worked for purposes of the\n         calculation. The number of years added is the number of years remaining until the\n         worker would have reached either normal retirement age or twenty years of service,\n         but no more than the number of years already worked.\nEEOC v.

Jan. 4, 2006). The majority\nargues that because older employees with, e.g., 10 years of service and final pay of $50,000 receive\nfewer benefits than younger employees with the same years of service and final pay, the KRS plan\nis facially discriminatory. Yet the majority misses the point that a 53-year-old employee who\nbecomes disabled is not similarly situated to a 33-year-old employee who becomes disabled, even\nif they have the same service years and final pay at the time of disability. All else being equal, the\nnon-disabled 33-year-old of course has more years to work and live than does a non-disabled 55-\nyear-old. See Lyon, 53 F.3d at 137, 140-41 (explaining that an early-retirement plan that “ensure[s]\nearly retirees the same benefits that they would have received had they continued to work until their\nnormal retirement date” did not pay older workers lower benefits because of age; two employees\nof different ages but equal years of service are not similarly situated). Here, the number of years of\nadditional work credit lost is a factor related to, but not determined by, age.\n        In Public Employees Retirement System v. Betts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112321\"><a href=\"/opinion/112321/public-employees-retirement-system-of-ohio-v-betts/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">158</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1989), the Supreme Court\nconfronted a disability-retirement plan that provided age-and-service retirement benefits to those\nwho retired over a certain age (for Betts, the plaintiff, the retirement age was 60) and had a certain\nnumber of service years, or to those under the age who had served a set higher number of years. The\nplan also provided disability benefits to those under the retirement age who had served a certain\nnumber of years and suffered a disability. 492 U.S. at 162. The scheme in Betts provided that\ndisability payments would constitute not less than 30% of the disability retiree’s final average salary;\nno such floor existed for age-and-service retirees. Betts became disabled at age 61, and therefore\nwas unable to receive disability benefits. She received in age-and-service benefits just over half\nwhat she would have received in disability. Id. at 163.\n        The Supreme Court stated that “[o]n its face, the . . . scheme renders covered employees\nineligible for disability retirement once they have attained age 60.” Yet the Court found that the\nscheme did not violate the ADEA because it fit under the then-existing provision of 29 U.S.C.\n\n         3\n           “May receive” for two reasons: first, as shown below at pages 16 and 17, a younger worker may only need\nthe same number of years for maximum benefits as an older worker (e.g., in the case of a 40-year-old with 15 years of\nservice and a 50-year-old with 15 years of service), and second, additional credit is limited to the number of years already\nworked. Thus, a 49-year-old with six service years and a 40-year-old with six service years will each get the same\nbenefit–six additional years of credit.\n\fNo. 03-6437            EEOC v. Jefferson County Sheriff’s Dep’t et al.                           Page 16\n\n\n§ 623(f)(2) that exempted age-based decisions taken pursuant to the terms of “any bona fide\nemployee benefit plan such as a retirement, pension, or insurance plan, which is not a subterfuge to\nevade the purposes of” the ADEA. Id. at 161-62, 166. A year after the Supreme Court’s decision\nin Betts, Congress passed the OWBPA, amending the ADEA. The OWBPA included a finding that\n“as a result of [Betts], legislative action is necessary to restore the original congressional intent in\npassing and amending the [ADEA], which was to prohibit discrimination against older workers in\nall employment benefits except when age-based reductions in employee benefit plans are justified\nby significant cost considerations.” OWBPA, Pub. L. No. 101-433, § 101, 104 Stat. 978 (1990)\n(codified at 29 U.S.C. § 621 note).\n        In contradistinction to the plan at issue in Betts, the case the OWBPA was designed to\noverturn, the KRS plan does not provide younger workers with a specific benefit unavailable to\nolder workers. In Betts, the crucial distinction was that a “disability” retirement gave a worker a\nguaranteed minimum income of 30% of the worker’s final salary. Betts was disqualified from\nreceiving that benefit solely on the basis of age, though she was qualified in every other respect.\nBetts, 492 U.S. at 162-63.\n        Under the KRS plan, a “disability” retirement is intrinsically no different from the “normal”\nretirement pension available to every worker. Benefits are based on years of credited service\n(augmented to a maximum of 20 for disabled workers ineligible for normal retirement), multiplied\nby a factor related to final salary. If “normal” benefits are greater than the augmented benefits for\ndisability, of course, the greater benefits are provided. The plan simply provides that a worker who\nis disabled before reaching eligibility for normal retirement benefits has a way of receiving a\nretirement benefit equal to (or closer to) what he would have received had he not become disabled\nbefore reaching the normal retirement age or 20 years of service.\n       This is a very reasonable benefit, and one that a younger worker, in particular, would be\nmore likely to value more highly than a newly-hired older worker, who would be more likely to have\nacquired other benefits from more extensive earlier employment. The extensive questioning by this\ncourt at oral argument, attempting to probe for a way to provide this sensible result under the\nappellants’ reasoning, shows that we should not be too quick to assume that Congress intended, or\ncommanded by the language it wrote, that such a reasonable plan was being outlawed.\n        It is worth repeating that the plaintiff here, Mr. Lickteig, is already eligible for “normal”\nretirement benefits, based on his 17 years of service and his having attained the normal retirement\nage (55 for employees in hazardous jobs). What he (or rather, what the EEOC on his behalf) is\nattempting to do in this suit is to prevent employees who have been granted a form of insurance\nagainst disability at a pre-retirement age from obtaining that benefit.\n        Several examples show how the KRS plan does not differentiate based on age, but on age\nonly in relation to years of service.\n        1) Take two employees of the same age. One is 48 with 10 years of service, the other is 48\nwith 15 years of service. They both become disabled. The first employee gets 7 years of extra\ncredit, which takes him to age 55, and the second gets 5 years of extra credit, which takes him to 20\nyears of service, but in each case it is as if the employee had worked until eligibile for normal\nretirement.\n        2) Take two employees with the same service. One is 50 with 15 years of service. The\nsecond is 35 with 15 years of service. They both become disabled. They each get exactly the same\nadditional credit - 5 years - despite the difference in their ages, and with that additional credit, it is\nas if each had worked until eligible for normal retirement.\n\fNo. 03-6437           EEOC v. Jefferson County Sheriff’s Dep’t et al.                         Page 17\n\n\n        3) Take two employees with differing ages and years of service. The first is 45 with 10 years\nof service. The second is 40 with 17 years of service. They both become disabled. This time, the\nolder worker actually gets a greater benefit because he will get credit for all of the 10 years that\nwould bring him to the retirement age, whereas the younger worker will “max out” at the full 20\nyears of credit with only an additional 3 years of credit.\n        These examples demonstrate starkly that age is not a controlling variable in the operation of\nthe KRS plan. They also show that the plan provides in practice exactly what was claimed for it by\nappellees’ counsel in the argument before us: a way to insure against disability that is sensitive to\nthe greatest loss caused by disability–the inability to continue earning credits toward retirement at\na normal retirement age.\n        Many life insurance policies have a feature that if premiums are paid from the inception of\nthe policy to age 65, no further premium payments are required. Some also have a feature called\n“disability waiver of premiums”: if the policy holder becomes disabled, the insurance company will\nno longer collect premiums, in effect crediting the policyholder as though those premiums are being\npaid. Yet, on average, such a disability feature (which no one would contend constitutes age\ndiscrimination) works exactly like the KRS plan. The waiver feature is worth more to the person\nwho is disabled at 40 than one who is disabled at 60, because, on average, the waiver is in effect for\nmany more years. And one who is disabled after 65 receives no benefit at all, as the premium is\nalready fully paid up.\n        It is undisputed, and patently obvious from the nature of the KRS plan, that both the rationale\nand the effect of that plan is to insure that all employees have a reasonable prospect of employer-\nsponsored insurance against a disability that occurs before retirement income becomes available.\nOn average, if employee A is younger than employee B and both suffer the same disability at the\nsame time, A 1) will have had less time to earn money and retirement credit, and 2) will have more\nyears to live. The KRS plan is meant to, and does, ameliorate exactly the ways in which A and B\nare not similarly situated, by providing A with a “bonus” for the circumstances of the disability.\nThat “bonus” depends on years of service and years to normal retirement age. The bonus will often,\nbut not always, be larger for a younger worker than an older one. As the examples show, the bonus\nprovided to employees who become disabled can vary from no additional credit to as much as 10\nyears’ credit, in a fashion that may be correlated (just as pension status in Hazen Paper was\ncorrelated) with age, but far from perfectly.\n        The KRS plan has nothing whatever to do with “inaccurate and stigmatizing stereotypes”\nsurrounding the relative ability of older employees to do the job–that is to say, Congress’s reason\nfor enacting the ADEA, as the discussion above and the majority’s own analysis of the legislative\nhistory indicate (Maj. Op. pp. 6–7). There is no intimation in any part of the KRS plan of any\ndemeaning or inappropriate stereotyping of older workers. All employees who are considered\ndisabled under the KRS plan are equally unable to do their jobs–because of disability. The only\nfactor resembling consideration of the nature of aging that counsel for appellants could adduce at\noral argument was that some older employees might wish to work beyond normal retirement age (55\nfor hazardous employees, 65 for nonhazardous employees). But that does not differentiate between\nworkers who are now more advanced in years and those younger. All such workers may wish to\n(and, had they not become disabled, might have been able to) work beyond that normal retirement\nage. But any retirement plan must have criteria for qualification, and using age as one of the criteria\nhas never been thought to violate the ADEA. If KRS changed the plan to have a later retirement\nage, the mathematics of some of the computations would change, but the aspect being attacked here\nwould remain. Thus, it is clear that impermissible stereotyping had nothing to do with the age-\ncorrelated features of the plan that are involved here.\n\fNo. 03-6437           EEOC v. Jefferson County Sheriff’s Dep’t et al.                         Page 18\n\n\n        Under the KRS plan, the employee’s age in relation to his years of service with the employer\nfactors into retirement benefits calculations. The majority, by dubiously labeling that plan as\nfacially discriminatory under the ADEA, uses that statute to invalidate a policy that lies far from the\n“essence” of the ADEA–and, in fact, does not implicate that essence at all. Age in relation to years\nof service performed for this employer is not the same as age qua age. See Hazen Paper, 507 U.S.\nat 612 (the ADEA “requires the employer to ignore an employee’s age (absent a statutory exemption\nor defense); it does not specify further characteristics that an employer must also ignore.”).\n       There is a further problem with the majority’s analysis. As the Lyon court noted, in\nreasoning that applies at least as much to this case:\n       [The employer’s] very willingness to ignore ageist stereotypes and hire workers of\n       any age actually appears to have exacerbated plaintiff’s “problem.” Those most\n       “disadvantaged” are those who were oldest at the time of hiring. It would be\n       contrary to the letter, as well as the spirit, of the ADEA to penalize the employer for\n       the incidental ramifications of objectivity.\n53 F.3d at 140 n.6. Here, the older workers “discriminated against” are sometimes exactly those\nwho were hired later in life, and thus had not accumulated as many years with this employer as a\nyounger worker (although, as example 3 shows (supra, at 17), sometimes exactly this factor will\ngive the later-hired older worker an advantage). Thus, I believe that neither the intent nor the letter\nof the ADEA bars the reasonable KRS retirement plan, and I respectfully dissent.\n\f</pre>",
