Lee in Harris County Probate\n\nCourt Number Two (2) (the \"Probate Court\"). TSC however filed their Original\n\nPetition in the 162'^'* Judicial District o f Dallas County on April 20, 2016 (the\n\n\"Dallas L a w s u i f ) . Legacy was appointed Receiver over the Trust by the Probate\n\nCourt. Legacy filed, in the Dallas Lawsuit, a Plea in Abatement and Motion to\n\nTransfer that challenged the venue o f the Dallas court, and subject to those\n\nmotions, an Answer and Counterclaim that asserted among other things that TSC\n\nhad only a fee agreement with their clients Susan Camille Lee and Susan Campbell\n\nGibson, and not any trustee o f the Trust, and in any event were barred by the Final\n\nJudgment awarding attorneys' fees entered by the Harris County Probate Court i n\n\nLee V. Lee. See Tab 1.\n\n        On May 13, 2016, Legacy filed a motion asking the Probate Court to transfer\n\nthe Dallas County Lawsuit to the Probate Court under Texas Estates Code § 34.001\n\n\n\n5631319v2                                 1\n\fas it was a matter related to a probate proceeding pending i n the Probate Court.\n\nThe Probate Court granted Legacy's Motion. Legacy served discovery requests on\n\nTSC regarding their breach o f contract action.^ Relators subsequently filed their\n\nPetition for Writ o f Mandamus pending in the above numbered and styled case. A t\n\nits most basic level, Relators have asserted that the Probate Court does not have\n\njurisdiction such that it could transfer the litigation to itself from 16T^^ Judicial\n\nDistrict Court i n Dallas County under Texas Estates Code § 34.001. Relators now\n\nhave filed a Motion for Emergency Stay o f Proceedings seeking to avoid having to\n\nproduce discovery in this matter and the Court subsequently granted the request for\n\nEmergency Stay on July 8, 2016.\n\n        Save for TSC's upcoming deadline to respond to discovery requests from\n\nLegacy, Legacy represents to the Court that there are no other pending deadlines in\n\nplace for this case at the present time.\n\n        No matter whether TSC's claims move forward in the Probate Court or\n\nDallas County District Court, TSC w i l l have to respond to discovery properly\n\nrequested by Legacy. TSC is simply seeking to avoid making discovery available\n\non its own claims for reasons unknown.\n\n\n\n\n See Tab 1 to Relator's Motion for Emergency Stay of Proceedings.\n\n\n\n5631319v2                                    0\n\f                             Argument      and    Authorities\n\n1.          The Emergency Stay Serves Only to Delay Necessary\n            Proceedings, Prejudicing Legacy.\n        A.        Absent compelling circumstances, a stay is improper.\n\n            The request for an emergency stay is an extraordinary measure provided for\n\nin the Texas Rules o f Appellate Procedure.          See T E X . R . A P P . P. 52.10.   The\n\nSupreme Court o f Texas has provided that \"[f]or a court o f appeals to stay\n\nproceedings i n the trial court while it considers an interlocutory appeal increases\n\ndelay and expense and should not be done absent compelling circumstances.\"\n\nCoal, of Cities for Affordable      Util. Rates v. Third Court of Appeals,     1^1 S.W.2d\n\n946, 947 (Tex. 1990) (per curiam). No such compelling circumstances exist here.\n\n            B.    No compelling circumstances exist for a stay.\n\n        Relators' sole basis for requesting a \"stay o f the trial court's proceedings\" is\n\nto avoid having to respond to Legacy's discovery about their claims against\n\nLegacy.          Relators have shown no \"compelling circumstances\" for avoiding\n\ndiscovery. Regardless o f whether TSC's Petition for Writ o f Mandamus is ruled on\n\nby this Court prior to August 15, or i f that petition is granted or denied, it w i l l not\n\nchange i n any way the need for TSC to respond to discovery requests from Legacy\n\nabout TSC's own claims. The discovery w i l l remain necessary and probative for\n\nthe resolution o f this matter either by settlement or trial, regardless o f whether the\n\nlawsuit proceeds in the Probate Court or District Court i n Dallas County. The\n\n\n5631319v2                                    3\n\fCourt's stay o f the proceedings does nothing more than further protract this\n\nlitigation and require the further delay and expense that the Texas Supreme Court\n\nwarned against in Coal, of Cities. See Coal, of Cities, 1^1 S.W.2d at 947.\n\n        Relators have conceded that Legacy has already agreed to an extension o f\n\nthe time period for which TSC may respond to Legacy's discovery requests until\n\nAugust 15, 2016. A true and correct copy o f the proposed discovery response\n\nextension agreement that counsel for Legacy has sent to counsel for Relators is\n\nattached to this pleading within Tab 2. Relators admitted i n their own Motion for\n\nEmergency Stay that they have tentatively agreed to such relief.^\n\n        Contrary to Relators' bald assertion, they have shown no prejudice by\n\nongoing discovery in the trial court. They argue, without citing any authority, that\n\nthey carmot send discovery to Legacy without \"risk o f waiver o f arguments made\n\nin TSC's plea in abatement.\" Even i f that were true, that is easily avoided by a\n\nRule 11 agreement as Legacy has offered not to assert such a waiver. A true and\n\ncorrect copy o f counsel for Legacy's offer to stipulate that responding to discovery\n\nwould not waive Relators' plea in abatement is attached to this pleading within\n\nTab 3.\n\n        On the other hand. Legacy and the beneficiaries o f the Trust over which\n\nLegacy is the Receiver are prejudiced by this stay. Legacy is charged by the order\n\n\n^ Motion for Emergency Stay at 6.\n\n\n\n5631319v2                                4\n\fof the Probate Court appointing Legacy as Receiver for the Article I V Trust under\n\nthe Last W i l l and Testament o f Katherine Pillot Lee Bamhart with performing the\n\nfunctions o f the trustee o f that Trust, which includes the mandatory distribution o f\n\nincome o f the Trust. Relators claim they are owed over $ 1 million to be paid from\n\nthe Trust based on events that occurred twenty years ago, a disputed liability that\n\nnevertheless affects Legacy's ability to make distributions from the Trust to its\n\nbeneficiaries.\n\n                                      Prayer\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, Legacy Trust Company, i n its capacity as the\n\nReceiver for the Article I V Trust created by the Last W i l l and Testament o f\n\nKatherine Pillot Bamhart, respectftilly requests that this Court (1) reconsider the\n\nRealtors' Motion for Emergency Stay o f Proceedings and the Order granting the\n\nsame; (2) upon reconsideration, deny Relators' Motion for Emergency Stay o f\n\nProceedings, and (3) grant such other and further relief as Legacy may show itself\n\njustly entitled to receive.\n\n\n\n\n5631319v2                                 5\n\f            Respectfully submitted,\n\n            M A C I N T Y R E , M C C U L L O C H , STANFIELD\n            i& Y O U N G , L L P\n\n\n            By;    /s/ W.

Legacy has its principal place of business in Harris County. The Plaintiff Lawyers\n\nbase their claim on the March 30, 1995 written fee agreement signed by Dan Sheehan, on behalf of\n\nThomas, Sheehan & Culp, LLP, and clients Susan Camille Lee (hereinafter referred to as \"Ms. Lee\"),\n\n                                                   . 1\n0050733\n\findividually, and Ms. Lee's daughter Susan Campbell Gibson (hereinafter referred to as \"Ms.\n\nGibson\"), individually, under which the law firm agreed to represent these clients for a mixture of\n\nhourly fees and contingent fees in a lawsuit Ms. Lee filed in 1988 in Probate Court No. 2 of Harris\n\nCounty, In the Estate of Katherine Pillot Lee Barnhart, Deceased — Susan Lee et al v. Ronald E. Lee,\n\nJr., individually, as Independent Executor of the Estate and as Trustee of the Article IV Trust under\n\nthe Last Will and Testament of Katherine Pillot Lee Barnhart, No. 137,506 (hereinafter referred to as\n\nthe \"Probate Court Lawsuit\").'     The Probate Court Lawsuit was tried and a judgment entered in\n\n1996, the judgment was modified on appeal in 2002, and Ms. Lee and Ms. Gibson were awarded\n\nspecific attorneys' fees paid from the Article I V Trust. The judgment also ordered defendant Ronald\n\nE. Lee, Jr., a resident of Harris County, to reimburse the Article IV Trust for certain expenses. Per\n\nPlaintiffs' Original Petition which is attached hereto as Exhibit \" 1 \" , the Plaintiff Lawyers claim they\n\nare entitled to collect a contingent fee based on amounts collected in Harris County 1) in 1997 by the\n\nTrustee of the Article IV Trust on the judgment entered in the Probate Court Lawsuit in 1996, 2) in\n\n2015 by Legacy as court-appointed Receiver for the Article IV Trust in 2015, and 3) in 2016\n\npursuant to a settlement agreement approved in 2016 by Harris County Probate Court No. 2. The\n\nPlaintiff Lawyers do not seek contingent fees awarded to their clients Ms. Lee and Ms. Gibson, but\n\nrather from the Article IV Trust despite the fact that the Trustee of the Article IV Trust was not a\n\nparty to the fee agreement. See Exhibit \"A\" to Plaintiffs' Original Petition. There is ongoing\n\nlitigation in Harris County Probate Court No. 2 conceming the Article IV Trust to which Legacy, Ms.\n\nLee, and Ms. Gibson are parties. Plaintiff Sheehan in fact is counsel for Ms. Lee and Ms. Gibson in\n\nthat litigation.\n\n\n\n\n ' A copy of the alleged fee agreement between the Plaintiff Lawyers, Ms. Lee and Ms. Gibson is\n attached to Plaintiffs' Original Petition at page 22 as Exhibit \"A\".\n\n\n                                                     2\n 0050733\n\f                                  Summary of Argument\n       A motion to transfer venue is the proper vehicle for a defendant to raise a challenge to the\n\nplaintiffs venue choice. TEX. R. CiV. P. 86; Wichita Cty. v. Hart, 917 S.W.2d 779, 781 (Tex. 1996).\n\nLegacy moves the Court to transfer venue of this lawsuit to Probate Court No. 2 of Harris County for\n\n3 reasons:\n\n        1. Plaintffs'allegations ofvenue in Dallas County are incorrect.\n\n        2. Venue is proper in Harris County, and particularly in Probate Court No. 2 of Harris\n\n             County, because the claims asserted in this lawsuit directly involve prior judgments and\n\n             rulings of Probate Court No. 2 of Harris County, and ongoing litigation on related matters\n\n              in that court.\n\n        3. Dallas County is an inappropriate and inconvenient forum for the adjudication of this\n\n              dispute.\n\n        Legacy has previously filed a motion in Probate Court No. 2 of Harris County requesting\n\nthat court to exercise its power conferred under Texas Estates Code §34.001 to order this case\n\ntransferred from this Court to Probate Court No. 2 of Harris County. A hearing on that motion is set\n\nfor June 7, 2016. If that motion is granted, this motion will be moot.\n\n                                             Argument\n 1.        Venue for this Lawsuit is Only Proper in Probate Court No. 2 of Harris\n           County.\n\n           Section 15.002(a) of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code provides in relevant part\n\n that, except where otherwise provided by statute, \"all lawsuits shall be brought \"(1) in the county in\n\n which all or a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred; ... or (3)\n\n in the county ofthe defendant's principal office in this state, if the defendant is not a natural person.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                     3\n 0050733\n\fOnly if these provisions do not apply may the plaintiff sue in the county of his or her residence under\n\nSection 15.002(a)(4).\n\n        Harris County is the only county where all or a substantial part of the events or omissions\n\ngiving rise to the claim occurred. The Article IV Trust (and the underlying probate of the will that\n\ncreated the trust), the Receiver, the lawsuit through which the Plaintiff Lawyers claim their\n\ncontingency fee was earned, the payments to the Article IV Trust arising out of that lawsuit, Susan\n\nLee, and Susan Gibson - all ofthe people, acts or omissions giving rise to the cause of action - were\n\nsituated or occurred in Harris County.\n\n        1. A plain reading of the fee agreement shows that the Susan Lee was a resident of Harris\n\n                 County at the time that she signed the agreement, and that the agreement pertained to a\n\n                 lawsuit she had already filed in Harris County in 1988.\n\n        2.       Ms. Gibson, Ms. Lee's daughter, was a resident of Harris County with her mother when\n\n                 the agreement was signed in 1995, although she was attending Pine Manor College in\n\n                 Massachusetts during the school year.\n\n         3. The sole basis on which the Plaintiff Lawyers claim they are entitled to collect the\n\n                 additional contingency fee is that the Trustee and the Receiver for the Article IV Trust\n\n                 collected money in Harris County pursuant to a Harris County judgment.\n\n            4.   The situs of that Article IV Trust was maintained in Harris County since the Trust was\n\n                 created by the Last Will and Testament of Katherine Pillot Lee Bamhart, Deceased,\n\n                 probated in Harris County, and under the supervision of Probate Court No. 2 in Harris\n\n                 County.\n\n            5. Legacy, as court-appointed Receiver of the Article IV Trust with all the powers of a\n\n                 trustee, resides in Harris County, and thus the funds from which the Plaintiff Lawyers\n\n                  seek to recover are located in Harris County.\n\n\n\n                                                         4\n  0050733\n\f          Therefore, venue of this lawsuit is proper only in Harris County, Texas. See TEX. CIV. PRAC.\n\n& REM. CODE     §15.002(a)(1).\n\n          Plaintiffs allege, correctly, that defendant Legacy is a nationally chartered non-depository\n\ntrust company with its principal place of business in Houston, Harris County, Texas. Movant is\n\nnot a natural person. Given the fact that Legacy's principal office is located in Harris County,\n\nvenue of the lawsuit is proper in Harris County, Texas. See TEX. Civ. PRAC. & R E M . CODE\n\n§ 15.002(a)(3).\n\n          The Plaintiff Lawyers claim venue is proper in Dallas County under TEX. C I V . PRAC. &\n\nR E M . CODE   §64.052(b) which provides that \"a suit against a receiver may be brought where the\n\nperson whose property is in receivership resides.\" However, §64.052(b) is a basis for proper\n\nvenue in Harris County, not Dallas County. Legacy is the Receiver for the Article I V Trust, and\n\nas such, holds title to the assets of the Article IV Trust. Venue is proper in Harris County as\n\nLegacy's principal place of business is in Houston, Harris County, Texas.\n\n          Texas Property Code §115.002(c-l) also provides that \" . . . i f the settlor is deceased and an\n\nadministration of the settlor's estate is pending in this state, an action involving the interpretation\n\nand administration of ... a testamentary tmst created by the settlor's will may be brought... (2)\n\nin the county in which the administration of the settlor's estate is pending.\"^ In this case, the\n\nPlaintiff Lawyers seek to have a contingent fee awarded to them from the Article IV Trust, a\n\ntestamentary trust created by Settlor Katherine Pillot Lee Bamhart (now deceased).                   The\n\nadministration of the Estate of Katherine Lee Pillot Lee Barnhart, Deceased is presently pending\n\n\n\n\n^ Likewise, ESTATES CODE §33.002 provides that venue for a cause of action related to a probate\nproceeding pending in a statutory probate court (other than a cause of action against a personal\nrepresentative for personal injury, death, or property damage) is proper in the statutory probate\ncourt in which the decedent's estate is pending.\n\n\n                                                     5\n0050733\n\fin Harris County Probate Court Number 2. Venue of the lawsuit is therefore proper in Probate\n\nCourt No. 2 of Harris County.\n\n          Even i f venue were proper in Dallas County, there are compelling reasons for this Court\n\nto transfer this case to Probate Court No. 2 in Harris County under TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\n§ 15.002(b). Not only is venue unquestionably proper in that court, the following reasons make\n\ntransfer to that Court the only reasonable choice in the exercise of this court's power to transfer under\n\nTEX. CIV. PRAC. REM. CODE       §15.002(b:\n\n          1.      Parties to this lawsuit are already parties        to pending    litigation   involving\n\n               overlapping issues in Probate Court No. 2 of Harris County.\n\n          2.      Plaintiffs' claims involve the interpretation of orders and judgments entered by\n\n               Probate Court No. 2 of Harris County. The Honorable Mike Wood, Judge of Probate\n\n               Court No. 2, presided over the trial and entered the very judgment that addressed both\n\n               attorneys' fees and the obligations of the trustee of the Article IV Trust at issue in the\n\n               Plaintiff Lawyers' claims for a contingent fee. Judge Wood is likewise supervising\n\n               Legacy as Receiver for the Article IV Trust.\n\n          3.      Any judgment entered against Legacy as Receiver for the Article IV Trust in this\n\n               court must be referred to Probate Court No. 2, the court that appointed it Receiver, for\n\n               enforcement first under Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code §64.055. Campbell v.\n\n               Wood, 811 S.W.2d 753, 756 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist] 1991, no writ).\n\n          Under these circumstances, maintenance of the action in Dallas County, rather than in the\n\ncourt that was and is directly involved in all matters pertinent to this dispute, would work an\n\ninjustice to Legacy and the beneficiaries of the Article I V Trust. The balance of interests o f a l l\n\nparties clearly favors proceedings in Probate Court No. 2, and a transfer to that court will not\n\nwork any injustice as to any party.\n\n                                                     6\n0050733\n\f       A,        Probate Court No, 2 is already adjudicating related issues\n                 involving the same parties.\n\n          The Plaintiff Lawyers' claims are but one part of an ongoing dispute entirely presided\n\nover by Probate Court No. 2 since 1988 concerning the management ofthe Article I V Trust. The\n\nmost recent chapter of that dispute led to that court removing the Plaintiff Lawyers' client Ms.\n\nLee as a substitute trustee ofthe Trust, and the appointment of defendant Legacy as Receiver for\n\nthe trust. See Exhibit B to Plaintiffs' Original Petition, \"Order Removing Trustee and\n\nAppointing Receiver,\" dated June 18, 2015. Also actively in dispute before Probate Court No. 2\n\nis Ms. Lee's claim that the terms ofthe settlement agreed to by Legacy and Mr. Ronald E. Lee,\n\nJr., under which Legacy has collected the judgment in favor ofthe Article IV Trust on which the\n\nPlaintiff Lawyers seek to collect contingent fees, should not be approved by that court. See\n\nExhibit \"2\" to this Motion, \"Defendant Susan Lee's Objections, Opposition, and Response to\n\nApplication to Approve Settlement Agreement.\" Dan Sheehan, a plaintiff here, is counsel for\n\nboth Ms. Lee and Ms. Gibson in the ongoing disputes in Probate Court No. 2. He served as lead\n\ncounsel for Ms. Lee in Probate Court No. 2 in a previous chapter, which is the basis for the\n\nclaims asserted in this lawsuit. It serves no legitimate purpose to involve a different court in a\n\ndifferent venue in the adjudication of this lawsuit.-^\n\n\n          B.     Plaintiffs' claims require the interpretation and enforcement of\n                 the orders and judgments of Probate Court No. 2.\n\n          Why did Sheehan and his former partners sue in Dallas, rather than in Probate Court No.\n\n2? The answer probably lies in the fact that their claims are foreclosed by that court's Final\n\nJudgment, dated October 25, 1996 in the very lawsuit to which the contingent fee agreement\n\n\n^ The Local Rules of the Dallas District Courts recognize the desirability of transferring cases\n\"related to another case previously filed in or disposed of by another Court\" in Rules 1.06 and\n1.07. While these rules are not directly applicable here, the principle is the same.\n\n\n                                                  fl\n0050733\n\fpertains, Susan Lee et al v. Ronald E. Lee, Jr., No 137,506. It is payments toward this same\n\njudgment on which the Plaintiff Lawyers base their attorneys' fee claims. These same lawyers,\n\nMs. Lee, and Ms. Gibson were parties to a stipulation that was incorporated into that Final\n\nJudgment dated October 25, 1996, which states in relevant part:\n\n                Based upon the stipulation of the counsel for the parties and the\n                undisputed or admitted facts, the Court finds that i) Susan C. Lee's\n                attomeys were paid reasonable and necessary fees of\n                $1,000,000.00 for the prosecution of this action; ii) attomeys\n                representing Susan C. Gibson, individually, and Susan C. Lee as\n                Trustee of the Article V Trust for Susan C. Gibson, were paid\n                reasonable and necessary fees of $500,000.00 for the prosecution\n                of this action . . . . The Court further finds that Plaintiffs are\n                entitled to judgment directing and authorizing the Executor of the\n                Estate and Tmstee of the Article IV Trust to reimburse Susan C.\n                Lee, individually and Susan C. Lee as Trustee of the Article Y\n                Tmst for Susan C. Gibson for the aforesaid attomeys' fees from the\n                assets ofthe Estate and/or the Article I V Trast, and after such\n                payment or reimbursement, Plaintiffs are not entitled to any\n                additional attorneys'fees for the trial of this action.\n\nFinal Judgment, October 25, 1996, Lee v. Lee, No. 137,506, p. 3 (emphasis added), attached as\n\nExhibit C to Plaintiffs' Original Petition at p. 037. Notwithstanding this order, under which the\n\nPlaintiff Lawyers received their fees, they now claim they are entitled to additional contingent\n\nfees. The proper court for interpreting and applying this order in this lawsuit is the one that\n\nissued it - Probate Court No. 2.      Moreover, it is Probate Court No. 2 that appointed and\n\nsupervises Legacy as Receiver for the Article I V Trust, and has power over the administration of\n\nthe Article IV Trust created by the Will of Katherine Pillot Lee Barnhart, whose estate was\n\nprobated in that court.\n\n          The same fee agreement on which plaintiffs base their claim was also the subject of a\n\nprevious jury trial before Judge Wood in Harris County Probate Court No.2, where another\n\nlawyer claiming under it sued Ms. Lee to collect fees. Donna Kline v. Susan Camille Lee, No.\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n0050733\n\f137,506-403. See Exhibit J to Plaintiffs' Original Petition at p. 143. Plaintiff Sheehan defended\n\nMs. Lee in that lawsuit. (Neither the then-trustee of the Article IV Trust nor Legacy was a party\n\nto that lawsuit.) The Plaintiff Lawyers now seek to have fees awarded to themselves under the\n\nvery same fee agreement that was previously litigated in Harris County Probate Court No. 2.\n\n          C.     Allowing this lawsuit to proceed in Dallas needlessly duplicates\n                 proceedings, wasting judicial resources.\n\n          Even i f a judgment were entered against Legacy here, Texas law would require the\n\nPlaintiff Lawyers to go to Harris County Probate Court No. 2 to enforce it. When ajudgment has\n\nbeen entered by a court against a receiver in its official capacity, the enforcement action must be\n\nreferred to the court that appointed the receiver.

Pursuant to the terms of that certain letter agreement dated March 30, 1995 (the\n\n\"Contingent Fee Agreement\" or \"CFA\"), six percent (6%) of the money and other property\n\ncollected from the judgment entered in the Lee v. Lee Litigation was assigned to TSC and is now\n\nowned by Plaintiffs.\n\n        12.     Defendant has failed and refused to turn over that property to its true owners.\n\n        13.     Attached as Exhibit \" A \" is a true and correct copy of the Contingent Fee Agreement.\n\nControl of Article I V Trust\n\n        14.     From inception of the Article IV Trust through approximately February, 2002, Ronald\n\nLee was. trustee of the Article IV Trust.\n\n        15.      From and after approximately February, 2002 tlirough June 18, 2015, Susan Lee\n\nserved as trustee of the Article IV Trust.\n\n        16.      On June 16, 2015, Ronald Lee filed a motion with the Probate Court seeking to\n\nremove Susan Lee as trustee and to appoint a receiver for the Article IV Trust.\n\n         17.     On June 18,2015, the judge ofthe Probate Court signed an order removing Susan Lee\n\nas trustee of the Article IV Trust and appointing Legacy as receiver for the Article I V Trust (\"June\n\n 18, 2015 Order\").\n         18.     Attached as Exhibit \"B\" is a true and correct copy ofthe June 18, 2015 Order.\n\n         19.

On October 25, 1996, the Probate Court entered a multi million dollar monetary\n\njudgment against Ronald Lee in favor of the Article IV Trust.\n\n       21.      Pursuant to the terms of the CFA, TSC served as lead counsel for Plaintiffs through\n\nentry of a final judgment in the Probate Court.\n\n        22.     But for TSC's efforts, expertise and hard work the favorable Trial Court Judgment\n\nwould not have been obtained.\n\n        23.     Attached as Exhibit \" C \" is a true and correct copy of the final judgment entered by\n\nthe Probate Court. (\"Trial Court Judgment\").\n\n        24.     TSC was the only law firm representing Plaintiffs during the trial of the Lee v. Lee\n\nLitigation and through entry of the Trial Court Judgment.                     ^\n\n        25.     Thomas, Sheehan and Culp also each served in various roles when providing legal\n\nrepresentation through the lengthy appellate process that followed.\n\n        26.     Following completion of an appellate process that began in the Houston Court of\n\n Appeals, an appellate opinion and mandate was issued increasing the amount of the Trial Court\n\n Judgment. (\"Article IV Trust Judgment\").\n\n        27.      Attached as Exhibit \"D\" is a true and correct copy of the Houston Court of Appeals\n\n opinion. (\"Appellate Opinion in Lee v. Lee\").\n\n         28.     Attached as Exhibit \" E \" is a true and correct copy of the mandate issued in relation\n\n to that appellate opinion. (\"Appellate Mandate\").\n\n         29.     At the time Legacy was appointed to serve as receiver for the Article IV Trust in\n\n 2015, the Article IV Trust Judgment was still outstanding.\n\n\n\n\n PLAIMTIFFS'ORIGINAL PETITION - Page 4                  .       .\n\fOverview of Assets Recovered on Article I V Trust Judgment\n\n       30.      On January 25, 2016, Legacy filed an application seeking approval of the Probate\n\nCourt to settle the Article IV Trust Judgment by Ronald Lee.\n\n       31.      Attached as Exhibit \"F\" is a true and correct copy of Legacy's \"Application to\n\nApprove Settiement Agreement\" filed with the Probate Court. (\"Legacy's Application to Approve\n\nSettlement Agreement\").\n\n        32.     Following an evidentiary hearing, the Probate Court entered an order granting\n\nLegacy's Application to Approve Settlement Agreement.\n\n        33.     Attached as Exhibit \"G\" is a true and correct copy of the order. (\"Order Granting\n\nApplication to Approve Settlement Agreement\").\n\n        34.      Attached as Exhibit \"A\" to Legacy's Application to Approve Settlement Agreement is\n\na copy of the settiement agreement approved by that order. (\"Legacy Settlement Agreement\").\n\n        35.      At pages 2,3, paragraph 7, the Legacy Settlement Agreement recites that the Article\n\nIV Trust Judgment, \"constitutes a debt owed to the Trust and an asset of the Article IV Trust.\"\n\n        36.      At page 3, paragraph 8, the Legacy Settlement Agreement further recites that, \"Mr.\n\nLee has made payment for the benefit ofthe Article IV Trust on the Judgment, including a payment\n\nof $8 million in 2015.\" (\"$8 Million Cash Payment\").\n\n         37.     Additionally, under the terms ofthe Legacy Settlement Agreement, paragraphs 15,16,\n\n and 19, Ronald Lee was obligated to deliver, among other things, a $4 miUion promissory note (\"S4\n\n Million Promissory Note\").\n\n         38.     On information and belief, Ronald Lee has delivered and the Article IV Trust has\n\n accepted the $8 Million Cash Payment, the $4 Million Promissory Note, and other consideration\n\n recited in the Legacy Settiement Agreement in partial satisfaction of the Article IV Trust Judgment.\n\n\n\n PLAINTIFFS' ORIGINAL PETITION - Page 5\n\f        39..    Despite Plaintiffs' assigned ownership interest in and to 6% of the recoveries under\n\nthe Article IV Trust Judgment, the Article IV Trust has failed and refused to deliver to Plaintiffs their\n\nassigned portion of the consideration so received and accepted in payment of the Article IV Trust\n\nJudgment.\n\nAppeal from Probate Court Order Approving Legacy Settlement Agreement\n\n        40.     Following entry of the Order Granting Application to Approve Settlement Agreement,\n\nLegacy, on or about March 28,2016, filed a document in the Probate Court entitled, \"Satisfaction of\n\n.Tudgment.\"\n\n        41.     In that document. Legacy represents that the Article IV Judgment \"has been fully\n\npaid, satisfied and discharged\" based upon the terms of the Legacy Settlement Agreement.\n\n        42.     Prior to Legacy's filing of the Satisfaction of Judgment, Susan Lee, on March 22,\n\n2016, filed a notice of appeal seeking appellate review of the Probate Court's Order approving the\n\nLegacy Settiement Agreement (\"Susan Lee Appeal\")\n\n        43.     As ofthe filing of this suit, the Susan Lee Appeal remains pending.\n\n        44.      On information and belief, Plaintiffs anticipate that Susan Lee w i l l contend in her\n\nappeal, among other things, that the Legacy Settiement Agreement did not fully pay and satisfy the\n\nArticle IV Trust Judgment.\n\n        45.      This lawsuit only seeks relief as to recoveries received by the Article IV Trust through\n\nthe time of the trial of this case, expressly reserving the right to seek further enforcement ofthe CFA\n\ni f subsequent recoveries upon the Article IV Trust Judgment are received including, but not limited\n\nto, any recoveries subsequently obtained as a result of the Susan Lee Appeal.\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFFS' ORIGINAL PETITION - Page 6\n\fJurisdictional Basis for Suit\n\n       46.     This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this case, because the amount in\n\ncontroversy exceeds the minimum jurisdictional limits of this Court.\n\nBasis for Venue in Dallas Comity\n\n       47.     Pursuant-to section 64.052(b) ofthe Civil Practices & Remedies Code (\"CPRC\"),\n\nvenue over this case is properly vested in Dallas County, Texas, because Thomas and Sheehan reside\n\nin Dallas County, Texas and this is a suit against a receiver holding property belonging to Thomas\n\nand Sheehan.\n\n        48.     Pursuant to CPRC section 15.002(a)(1), venue over this case also is properly vested in\n\nDallas County, Texas, because the contractual relationship placed at issue by this suit was formed\n\nand performed in material respects in Dallas County, Texas, and more generally, a substantial part of\n\nthe events giving rise to the claims raised by this suit occurred in Dallas County, Texas. More\n\nspecifically, the Contingent Fee Agreement was negotiated by means of telephone discussions,\n\ntelefax transmittals and mailings to and from Dallas, Texas, the CFA was signed by TSC in Dallas,\n\nTexas, all billings for work performed under the CFA originated from Dallas, Texas, all payments\n\nfor such invoiced work were received in Dallas, Texas, much of the communication related to the\n\nperformance of the CFA emanated from Dallas, Texas, and a substantial amount of the worked\n\nperformed under the terms of the CFA was performed in Dallas, Texas.\n\n        49.     Pursuant to CPRC section 15.003(a), venue over this case also is properly vested in\n\n Dallas County, Texas, because joinder of one or more of the Plaintiffs is proper under the Texas\n\n Rules of Civil Procedure (\"TRCP\"), venue as to each Plaintiff in Dallas County does not unfairly\n\n prejudice another party to the suit, there is an essential need to have each Plaintiffs claim tried in\n\n\n\n\n PLAINTIFFS'ORIGINAL PETITION-Page 7        :\n\fDallas County, and Dallas County is a fair and convenient venue for each Plaintiff and all persons\n\nagainst whom this suit is brought.\n\n                           FACTUAL A L L E G A T I O N S SUPPORTING C L A I M S\n\n\nThe Contingent Fee Agreement\n\n        50.     In the spring of 1995, TSC took over lead counsel responsibility for handling\n\nlitigation brought by a sister, Susan Lee, against her brother, Ronald Lee.\n\n        51.     The dispute arose over Ronald Lee's administration of an estate of their grandmother,\n\nKatherine Pillot Lee Barnhart (\"Katherine Barnhart\"), and certain related trusts, including the\n\nArticle IV Trust.\n\n        52.     At the time of suit filing, Ronald Lee was the executor ofthe estate and the trustee of\n\nthe Article IV Trust.\n\n        53.      Ronald Lee and Susan Lee were the only beneficiaries under the terms of the Article\n\nIVTrust.\n\n        54..     Before TSC accepted the engagement, the Contingent Fee Agreement was entered\n\ninto by and between TSC, Susan Lee, her daughter, Susan Gibson, and Donna Kline.\n\n         55.     Susan Gibson was a beneficiary of another trust established under the terms of\n\n Katherine Bamhart's will.\n\n         56.     Donna Kline was a duly licensed attomey authorized to practice law in the State of\n\n Texas, who had been involved in the representation of Susan Lee and Susan Gibson in the Lee v. Lee\n\n Litigation before TSC was retained.                    .   '\n\n         57.     Sheehan, Kline, Susan Lee, and Susan Gibson each signed the Contingent Fee\n\n Agreement on or about March 30, 1995.\n\n\n\n\n PLAINTIFFS' ORIGINAL PETITION - Page 8\n\f        58.     Pursuant to the terms of the CFA, TSC was to be compensated for handling the Lee v.\n\nLee Litigation through payment of fees based upon reduced regular hourly rates plus 6% of all\n\nrecoveries obtained.\n\n        59.     TSC was fully paid all hourly fees charged under the terms of the CFA.\n\n        60.     The contingent fee agreed to be paid expressly included any recovery obtained on\n\nbehalf of the Article IV Trust; however, neither Susan Lee nor Susan Gibson would be personally\n\nliable for any such fee related to any such recovery obtained for such trust.\n\n        61.      Instead, both Susan Lee and Susan Gibson agreed to support TSC's right to its\n\ncontingent fee interest in any recovery obtained on behalf of the Article IV Trust.\n\n        62.      Susan Lee and Susan Gibson support the claims brought by this suit.\n\nOutcome of the Lee v. Lee Litigation\n\n        63.      Beginning in March 1995 through the end of that year, TSC expended hundreds of\n\nhours in preparation diligently prosecuting the case and preparing it for trial, including the conduct of\n\na juiy trial for several days in the fall of 1995 before a mistrial was granted.\n\n         64.     On January 3, 1996, a second jury trial was started in the Lee V. Lee Litigation. .\n\n         65.     Following an aggressive prosecution of the case in a trial lasting well over a week, a\n\nfavorable jury verdict was obtained on behalf of Susan Lee, Susan Gibson and the Article IV Trust.\n\n         66.     Following nine more months ofbriefing and argument addressing various post trial\n\nmotions, the Trial Court Judgment was entered.\n\n         67.     Under the terms of the Trial Court Judgment, the Article IV Trust was granted a\n\n monetaiy judgment against Ronald Lee for:\n\n                  a. $840,002.00 for Ronald Lee's breach of fiduciary duty related to the Knollwood\n\n                      Development, the River Bend Farm, and the Cap Rock Ranch;\n\n\n\n• PLArNTiFFS'ORIGINAL PETITION - Page 9\n\f               b. $659,506.50 for payment to Ronald Lee of an unreasonable executor fee;\n\n                c. $919,702.12 for prejudgment interest related to the payment of the unreasonable\n\n                    executor fee, plus accruing per diem interest at the rate of $180.69;\n\n                d. $163,550.00 for unreasonable office expenses; and\n\n                e. $157,969.90 for prejudgment interest related to the unreasonable office expenses,\n\n                    plus accruing per diem interest at the rate of 44.81.\n\n        68.     In total, the Article IV Trust was granted a principal monetary judgment recovery\n\nagainst Ronnie Lee in the amount of $1,663,058.50;plus prejudgment interest atlO% per annum,\n\nbringing the total judgment amount against Ronald Lee to $2,758,770.52. (\"Principal Trial Court\n\nJudgment Amount\").\n\n        69.     The Trial Court Judgment also provided for postjudgment interest on the Principal\n\nTrial Court Judgment Amount at the rate of 10% per annum, compounded annually.\n\n        70.     The Trial Court Judgment also expressly denied requested relief to remove Ronald\n\nLee as Trustee of the Article IV Trust.\n\n        71.      But for TS C' s diligent and expert handling of the Lee v. Lee Litigation, the Article IV\n\nTrust would not have obtained the large monetary sum awarded in the Trial Court Judgment.\n\n        72.      A l l parties appealed from the Trial Court Judgment.\n\n        73.      OnMay 17, 2001, the Appellate Opinion in Lee V.Lee was issued and reported at 47\n\nS.W.3d767.\n\n         74.     After the Texas Supreme Court refused petitions for review, the Houston Court of\n\nAppeals issued the Appellate Mandate.\n\n         75.     The appellate process lasted from October, 1996 through issuance ofthe Appellate\n\n Mandate in February, 2002, a total of approximately 5 years and 4 months.\n\n\n PLAINTIFFS'ORlGrNAL PETITION - Page 1 0\n\f       76.        Thomas, Sheehan and Culp provided legal representation in this case throughout the\n\nappellate process.\n\n       77.        Pursuant to the Appellate Mandate, the Article IV Trust's judgment against Ronald\n\nLee was increased materially. ,\n\n       78.        Under the terms ofthe Article IV Tmst's judgment against Ronald Lee as modified by\n\nthe Appellate Mandate, the Article IV Trust was granted an additional principal monetary judgment\n\nagainst Ronald Lee in the amount of $ 1,53 8,843,50 for claims related to the payment of an excessive\n\nexecutor's fee.\n\n       79.        The Appellate Mandate also modified the Trial Court Judgment by: (i) rendering an\n\nadditional principal monetary judgment against Ronald Lee in the amount of $1,500,000.00 based\n\nupon the conclusion that the Article IV Trust should not have been directed to reimburse Ronald Lee\n\nfor attorney's fees incurred when defending the Lee v. Lee Litigation; (ii) removing Ronald Lee as\n\ntrustee of the Article IV Trust; (iii) revising the calculation of prejudgment interest awards; and (iv)\n\ndirecting Ronald Lee to pay all costs of the appeal.\n\n        80.       In sum and as most material to this case, the Appellate Mandate reformed the Trial\n\nCourt Judgment to increase the principal amount of the monetary judgment awarded to the Article IV\n\nTrust against Ronald Lee from $1,663,058.50 to $4,701,902.00, it revised calculations of\n\nprejudgment interest, and it confirmed the award of postjudgment interest on all of the foregoing\n\nsums at 10% per annum, compounded annually. (\"Final Monetary Sum Awarded the Article IV\n\nTrust\").\n\n        81.       But for the diligent and expert handling of the appeal by Thomas, Sheehan and Culp,\n\nthe Article IV Trust would not have obtained such a favorable outcome in the appeal.\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFFS' ORIGINAL PETITION - Page 1 1\n\fThe Donna Kline Litigation\n\n       82.      Before the Lee v. Lee Litigation proceeded to trial, Susan Gibson sent a letter to\n\nDonna Kline demanding that Kline withdraw from her representation in the Lee v. Lee Litigation.\n\n        83.     Kline honored the demand and withdrew from the representation in the fall of 1995.\n\n        84.     Kline subsequently intervened in the Lee v. Lee Litigation to recover unpaid legal fees\n\narising in connection with work performed on two separate lawsuits, including the Lee v. Lee\n\nLitigation. (\"Kline Litigation\").\n\n        85.     The bulk of Kline's claim pertained to representation provided in the Lee v. Lee\n\nLitigation under the terms of the Contingent Fee Agreement.\n\n        86.      On June 27, 1996, the Probate Court signed an order severing the Kline Litigation\n\nfrom the Lee v. Lee Litigation.\n\n        87.      In the Severance Order, the Probate Court directed the Kline Litigation to proceed\n\nforward under Cause No. 137,506-403.\n\n        88. . The Kline Litigation proceeded to ajury tirial beginning on July 15, 1997.\n\n        89.      That trial produced ajury verdict favoring Kline.\n\n        90.      Attached as Exhibit \" H \" is a true and correct copy ofthejury verdict rendered in the\n\nKline Litigation. (\"Kline Jury Verdicf).\n\n         91.     Following receipt of the Kline Jury Verdict, the Probate Court entered judgment in\n\n favor of Donna Kline.\n\n         92.      Attached as Exhibit \" I \" is a true and correct copy of the judgment rendered by the\n\n Probate Court in favor of Donna Kline and against Susan Lee, individually and as trustee for Susan\n\n Gibson, and Susan Gibson, individually. (\"Kline Judgment\").\n\n\n\n\n PLAINTIFFS' ORIGINAL PETITION - Page 1 2\n\f        93.     Among other things, the Kline Judgment awarded Donna Kline a monetaiy recovery\n\nof $114,207.21 for unpaid hourly fees plus an additional $132,500.00 for attorney's fees incurred in\n\nprosecuting the case.\n\n        94.      The Kline Judgment also granted Donna Kline declaratory relief, as follows: \"Based\n\nupon the Jury's answer to Question 2, the Court makes declaratoryjudgment that Donna C. Kline has\n\na good, valid and subsisting interest in any recovery by Susan Camille Lee, individually and as\n\ntrustee for Susan C. Gibson, and Susan C. Gibson individually, pursuant to her contingent fee\n\ncontract of March 30, 1995.\"\n\n        95.      The reference to the contingent fee contract of March 30,1995 is the same Contingent\n\nFee Agreement placed at issue in this case.\n\n        96.      Susan Lee and Susan Gibson appealed the Kline Judgment to the Houston Court of\n\nAppeals.\n\n        97.      On January 13, 2000, the Houston Court of Appeals issued its final decision on\n\nrehearing.\n\n         98.

As material to this case, the Appellate Opinion in the Kline Litigation made the\n\nfollowing rulings related to the Contingent Fee Agreement:\n\n                 a. In addition to agreements to pay both Kline and TSC at hourly rates specified,\n\n                      \"Defendants also expressly agreed to pay . a 10% contingency fee on any\n\n                      'recovery.'\" (Appellate Opinion in Kline Litigation, at *1);\n\n\n\n\n PLAINTIFFS' ORIGINAL PETITION - Page 1 3\n\f               b.     \"It was further agreed that 40% of the 10% contingency fee would be paid to\n\n                      Kline and that the remaining 60% would be paid to Thomas, Sheehan & Culp.\"\n\n                       (M);\n\n                c.

On information and belief based upon evidence currently available to Plaintiffs,\n\nRonald Lee has made or is making three separate sets of monetary payments toward satisfaction of\n\nthe Final Monetary Sum Awarded the Article IV Trust.\n\n        103.    Plaintiffs only learned of the first and second payments during the course of\n\nproceedings related to Legacy's Apphcation to Approve Settlement Agreement in 2016.\n\n        104.    As to the first monetary payment. Legacy presented evidence during hearings on\n\nLegacy's application that Ronald Lee paid the Article IV Trust the sum of $2,816,213.60 on January\n\n9, 1997. .(\"January, 1997 Payment\"),\n\n        105.     Sheehan first learned of this payment in February, 2016, and Thomas and Culp only\n\nlearned of that payment about six weeks later.\n\n         106.    The January, 1997 Payment was made roughly 2 1/2 months after entry of the Trial\n\nCourt Judgment in October of 1996.\n\n         107.    At the time of the January, 1997 Payment, Ronald Lee was the trustee of the Article\n\nIVTrust. •\n\n         108.    Susan Lee did not become the trustee of the Article IV Trust until roughly 5 years\n\nlater when the Appellate Mandate was issued.\n\n         109.    As to the second monetary payment. Legacy attached to its Application to Approve\n\nSettlement Agreement a copy of the proposed settlement agreement between Receiver and Ronald\n\nLee.\n\n         110.    At page 3, paragraph 8 of the recitals, the Legacy Settlement Agreement states, \"Mr.\n\nLee has made payment for the benefit of the Article IV Trust on the Judgment [Final Monetary Sum\n\n\n\n\n PLAINTIFFS'ORIGINAL PETITION - Page .16\n\fAwarded the Articie IV Trust], including a payment of $8,000,000.00 in 2015.\" (\"S8 Million\n\nPayment\").\n\n         111.    This is the first occasion that Sheehan learned of this payment, and Thomas and Culp\n\nonly learned of that payment roughly one month before filing this litigation.\n\n         112.    On information and belief, the third and final series of monetary payments are those\n\ncurrently being made by Ronald Lee to the Article IV Trust pursuant to the terms ofthe $4 Million\n\nPromissory Note.\n\n         113.    Pursuant to the assignment in the CFA, Plaintiffs now own 6% of all such monies\n\ncurrently in the hands of the Receiver.\n\nNon Monetary Recoveries Received and Accepted by the Article I V Trust\n\n         114.    Above and beyond the additional payments still to be made to the Article IV Tmst by\n\nRonald Lee pursuant to the terms of the $4 Million Note, the Legacy Settlement Agreement reflects\n\ntwo other valuable, non monetary considerations received by the Article IV Trust.\n\n         115.    First, at pages 5 and 6, paragraph 19 of the Legacy Settlement Agreement, Ronald Lee\n\nreleases specified alleged claims that Ronald Lee has against the Article IV Trust.\n\n         116.    Six percent of the value of these releases constitutes part of the recovery assigned to\n\nand now owned by Plaintiffs under the terms of the CFA. (\"Release Value\").-\n\n         117.     Second, at page 4, paragraph 15, Lee is obligated to execute a deed conveying his\n\n• interest in the River Bend Farm to the Article IV Trust. (\"River Bend Property\").\n\n         118.     Six percent of the River Bend Property constitutes part of the recovery assigned to\n\n and now owned by Plaintiffs under the terms of the CFA.\n\n\n\n\n PLAINTIFFS' ORIGINAL PETITION - Page 1 7\n\f                                              CLAIMS\n\nBreach of Contract\n\n        119.    Plaintiffs incorporate Paragraphs 1 - 118, as if set forth fully here.\n\n        120.    There is avaUd, enforceable contract by and between TSC, SusanLee, Susan Gibson\n\nand the Article IV Trust to provide legal services under the terms of the Contingent Fee Agreement.\n\n        121.    In addition or in the alternative to the above allegations, the Article IV Trust later\n\nadopted and accepted the CFA when Susan Lee was acting as the trustee for the Article IV Trust.\n\n        122.    In addition or in the alternative to the above allegations, the Article IV Trust ratified\n\nthe CFA before and/or after the time that Susan Lee was acting as the trustee for the Article IV Tmst.\n\n        123.     More specifically, Susan Lee entered into the CFA on behalf of the Article IV Trust,\n\nwith and/or without authority to do so, and the Article IV Trust approved the CFA after acquiring\n\nfull knowledge of the terms and provisions of the CFA with the intention of giving validity to Susan\n\nLee's agreement to bind the Article IV Trust to the terms of the CFA.\n\n         124.    In addition or in the alternative, the Article IV Trust ratified and is now bound to\n\nhonor the CFA, because it received and accepted benefits generated from the performance of the\n\nCFA with full knowledge of TSC's assigned interest and contingent fee rights to monetary and other\n\nrecoveries obtained as a result of work performed by TSC under the terms ofthe CFA.\n\n         125.    Under the terms of the CFA, TSC is the owner of 6% of every form of consideration\n\nreceived and accepted in full, or alternatively, partial satisfaction of the Article IV Trust Judgment.\n\n         126.    Plaintiffs are the successors in interest of TSC and they are the proper parties now\n\nentitled to enforce the terms of the CFA.\n\n         127.    TSC fully and/or substantially performed, tendered performance or was excused from\n\ncontinued performance under the terms of the CFA.\n\n\n\n PLAINTIFFS'ORIGINAL PETITION - Page 1 8\n\f         128.    In accepting recoveries under the terms ofthe CFA without paying Plaintiffs their 6%\n\nassigned, cbntingent fee interest, the Article IV Trust has dishonored the terms ofthe CFA and is\n\nnow wrongfully withholding Plaintiffs' right to full use and enjoyment of property Plaintiffs own.\n\n         129.    More specifically, Plaintiffs seek an order directing the Receiver to turn over 6% of\n\nall cash sums accepted in payment of the Article IV Trust Judgment, including, but not necessarily\n\nlimited to, 6%ofthe January, 1997 Payment and the $8 Million Payment, totaling $648,972.81 plus\n\ninterest at the highest rate allowed by law from date of receipt of each such payment until delivery of\n\nthe wi'ongfuUy possessed funds.\n\n         130.    Additionally, Plaintiffs seek an order directing the Receiver to turn over 6% of all\n\ncash sums accepted in payment of the $4 Million Promissory Note plus interest at the highest rate\n\nallowed by law from date of receipt of each payment until delivery of the wrongfully possessed\n\nfunds.\n\n         131.    In the alternative, Plaintiffs seek the recovery of a monetary judgment against the\n\nArticle IV Trust for the damage suffered by reason of its breach of the CFA equal to 6% of the\n\nJanuary, 1997 Payment, the $8 Million Payment and the payments received on the $4 Million\n\nPromissory Note plus interest at the highest rate allowed by law from date of receipt of each payment\n\nuntil delivery of the wrongfully possessed funds..\n\n         132.    Additionally, Plaintiffs seek an order directing the Receiver to turn over 6%\n\n ownership of the $4 Million Note, or alternatively, a monetary judgment against the Article IV Trast\n\n for damages suffered by reason of the Article IV Tmst's breach of the CFA equal to 6% of the value\n\n ofthe$4MillionNote.\n\n          133.    Additionally, Plaintiffs seek an order directing the Receiver to tum over a 6% interest\n\n in the River Bend Farm, or alternatively, a monetary judgment against the Article I V Trust for\n\n\n\n PLAINTIFFS'ORIGINAL PETITION - Page ! 9\n\fdamages suffered by reason of the Article IV Trust's breach ofthe CFA equal to 6% of the value of\n\nthe River Bend Farm.\n\n         134.   Additionally, Plaintiffs seek a monetai-y judgment against the Article IV Trust for\n\ndamages suffered by reason of the Article IV Trust's breach of the CFA equal to 6% of the Release\n\nValue.\n\n         135.   Plaintiffs also seek and are entitled to recover all reasonable and necessary attomey's\n\nfees arising from work performed to prosecute this suit, including any and all appeals, in an amount\n\nto be determined at trial.\n\n         136.   Plaintiffs further seek and are entitled to the recovery of pre-judgment interest at the\n\nhighest rate authorized by law.\n\n         137.

Weller, 976 S.W.2d 212 (Tex.App.—Amarillo 1998, writ denied). Accordingly, we do not discuss this case.\n4          We address the AWn holding in further detail later in this opinion.\n5           In his response brief, appellee claims that the trial court \"determined that'cause' would exist to remove if the jury had found\n            gross negligence.\" Appellee then states that appellants did not complain below and do not complain on appeal that gross\n            negligence is not a legally valid basis for removal. Because the jury refused to find gross negligence, appellee reasons\n            the trial court properly declined to remove appellee as trustee. Appellee misrepresents the trial court's determination.\n            The trial court actually said he could find grounds for removal if there was a finding of e/Y/rer gross negligence or breach\n            of fiduciary duty and damages.\n6           The former statute has been rewritten upon codification to set out the grounds in an enumerated fashion; however, the\n            language of the statute remains the same. Compare Act of April 14,1993, 48th Leg., R.S., ch. 148, § 39, 1943 Tex. Gen.\n            Laws 232, 246 (repealed) wrth TEX. PROP.CODE ANN. § 113.082 (Vernon 1995).\n7           This holding seems to fly in the face of the plain language of the statute. The statute allows recovery of attomey's fees\n            if the executor defends the will in good faith and with just cause, whether or not he or she is successful in admitting the\n            will to probate. See TEX. PROB.CODE ANN. § 243 (Vernon Supp.2000). Although the recovery of fees is expressly not\n            tied to success in admitting the will to probate, It is tied to good faith defense. By holding that a finding of good faith was\n            inapplicable where the executor was successful in admitting the will to probate, the court ignored the statutory language\n            and tied recovery of fees to success in admitting the will.\n8           This is somewhat similar to the standard for official Immunity, which has been held to protect \"all but the plainly\n            incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\" Courson v. McMillian, 939 F.2d 1479,1487 (11th Cir.1991) (quoting\n            Ma//ey V.

You are the sole judges of the credibility of the\nwitnesses and the weight to be given then testimony, but in matters of law you must be govemed by\nthe insnuctions in this charge. In discharging yom responsibility on this jury, you will observe all\nthe inshuctions which have been previously given you. I shall now give you additional instructions\nwhich you should carefully and snictly follow dming your deliberations.\n\n1.      Do not let bias, prejudice, or sympathy play any part in your deliberations.\n\n2.       In anivmg at your answers consider only the evidence uitroduced here under oath and such\nexhibits, if any, as have been inteoduced for your consideration under the rulings ofthe court, that\nis what you have seen and heard m this courtroom, together with the law as given you by the court.\nIn your deliberations you will not consider or discuss anything that is not represented by the evidence\nin this case.\n\n3.     Since every answer that is required by the charge is important, no juror should state or\nconsider that any required answer is not important.\n\n4.     You must not decide who you think should win, and then hy to answer the questions\naccordmgly. Simply answer the questions, and do not discuss or concem yourselves with the effect\nof your answers.\n\n 5.     You will not decide the answer to a question by lot or by drawing straws, or by any other\n method of chance. Do not rehim a quotient verdict. A quotient verdict means that the jurors agree\n to abide by the itssult to be reached by adding together each juror'sfiguresand dividing by the\n\n\n                                                    -1-\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFFS' ORIGINAL PETITION - Page 120\n\fnumber of jurors to get an average. Do not do any trading on your answers; that is, one juror should\nnot agree to answer a certain question one way if others will agree to answer another question\nanother way.\n\n6.        You may render your verdict upon the vote of ten or more members of the jury. The same\nten or more of you must agree upon all the answers made and to the entire verdict. You will not,\ntherefore, enter into an agreement to be bound by a majority or any other vote of less than 10 jurors.\nI f the verdict and all the answers therein are reached by unanimous agreement, the Presiding Juror\nshall sign the verdict for the entire jury. If any jmor disagrees as to any answer made by the verdict,\nthose jmors who agree to allfindingsshall each sign the verdict.\n\n         These instructions are given you because your conduct is subject to review the same as that\n of the witnesses, parties, attomeys, and the judge.

Thomas\n      followed Grote's instmctions and reported it to the Judge the following moming. The Judge declared a mistrial because of\n      Thomas' conversation with Grote, in addition to problems with at least four other Jurors. The judge noted that if Thomas\n      was theonly problem he would allow the trial to proceed but he could not allow it to proceed because another Juror stated\n      that she was suffering from intolerable pain and could not afford to sen/e, another juror stated that he was schizophrenic,\n      and another stated he had to be with his wife who was taken to an emergency room. The Judge concluded, \"I have\n      reached the conclusion I am very uncomfortable with the Jury. I have never had a Jury that has been more creative with\n      excuses. It seems to be pandemic among them, and it's well, if you don't buy this excuse, I've got this excuse.\"\n12    Notably, nowhere in Defendants' pleadings nor in Defendants' responses to Grote's motion for summary judgment, is an\n      attempt made to show that Defendants possessed any evidence to show that Defendants could prove the \"suit within a\n      suit\" by demonstrating that they would have prevailed in the action complained of but for Grote's alleged malpractice. See\n      Schlager, 939 S.W.2d at 186. Indeed, this Court is left in the dari( as to what it was that Grote did In the complained of\n      action that showed he committed legal malpractice or violated the DTPA. See Greathouse, 982 S.W.2d at 174 (summary\n      Judgment appropriate where plaintiff fails to raise a fact issue conceming the \"suit within a suit\" element of a legal\n      malpractice cause of action).\n13    Attached to Grote's motion for summary Judgment are copies ofthe transcripts from Grote's and Juror Thomas' testimony\n      before the trial court concerning their communication.\n\n\n                                                             © 2016 Thomson Reuters.

On\n\nJune 18, 2015, the Court removed Susan Lee as Tmstee of the Trust and appointed Legacy to\n\fserve as receiver for the Trust pursuant to TEX. PROP. CODE § 114.038. The Order provided that\n\nLegacy was authorized to collect, compromise, or settle all debts owed to the Trust.\n\n       On January 25, 2016, Legacy fded its Application to Approve Settlement Agreement\n\n(\"Application\"), attaching an executed Settlement Agreement between Ronald Lee and Legacy,\n\ndated as effective January 13, 2016. Among other things, the Settlement Agreement calls for a\n\nsettlement of the judgment against Ronald Lee in favor ofthe Trust, entered in 1996, arising out\n\nof Lee V. Lee, Cause No. 137,506, Harris County Probate No. 2. The judgment was modified by\n\nthe Fourteenth Court of Appeals in Lee v. Lee, 47 S.W.3d 767 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n2001, pet. denied). The court of appeals rendered its opinion on May 17, 2001, the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt denied Ronald Lee's petition in December 2001, and the Fourteenth Court of Appeals issued\n\nits mandate on February 8, 2002. On December 6, 2012, this Court entered an Order Granting\n\nApplication for Writ of Scire Facias and to Revive Dormant Judgment in Cause No. 137,506-402\n\n(\"Judgmenf).\n\n L     The proposed Settlement Agreement is not in the best\n       interest of the Trust and should not be approved.\n\n                      SUMMARY O F OBJECTION AND RESPONSE\n\n       The Court should not approve Legacy's Settlement Agreement with Ronald Lee because:\n\n           1. Settlement ofthe Trust's $26 million Judgment against him for less than\n              one-half of its value is not in the best interest of the Trust and violates\n              Legacy's fiduciary duties.\n\n           2. The proposed transfer of Ronald Lee's interest in the River Bend Fami\n              Property is of no benefit to the Trust because it already owns his interest.\n\n\n\n\nDEFENDANT'S OBJECTIONS, OPPOSITION, AND RESPONSE TO\nAPPLICATION TO APPROVE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT                                                  PAGE 2\n\f        A.      The proposed settlement of the Judgment is grossly inadequate.\n\n        The proposed Settlement Agreement between Ronald Lee and Legacy allows Ronald Lee\n\n to satisfy the Judgment in full, apparently for consideration that includes an alleged payment of\n\n $8 million in 2015, and a promissory note in the amount of $4 million payable quarterly over a\n\nperiod of two years at a 4% interest rate. This amount is woefully inadequate, less than one-half\n\n of what is due under the Judgment.\n\n        Legacy's Application understates the amount of the Judgment against Ronald Lee by a\n\nsignificant amount. The Application simply references a judgment totaling approximately $3.9\n\nmillion \"plus prejudgment interest.\" The actual amount of the Judgment is in excess of $4.3\n\nmillion, and significant portions ofthe Judgment carry post-judgment interest at the rate of 10%\n\ncompounded annually back to October 1996, almost 20 years. When post-judgment interest is\n\ncalculated in accordance with the Fourteenth Court of Appeals' opinion, the total amount ofthe\n\nJudgment as of February 2016 exceeds $26 million.^ Yet, the proposed Settlement Agreement\n\ndischarges the Judgment and sells the Trust's $26 million asset in retum for only $8 million, plus\n\na $4 million promissory note payable over two years. And, the promissory note carries only 4%\n\ninterest, compared to the Judgmenf s rate of 10%.\n\n        Ronald Lee and Legacy have colluded to relieve him of his obligations to the Trust. Legacy\n\nasks the Court to find that the Settlement Agreement is in the best interest of the Trast. Yet, it\n\nallows Ronald Lee to discharge this judgment (unpaid for 20 years) for less than 50 cents on the\n\ndollar. It is not in the best interest of the Trust or its beneficiaries. Rather, it is only in Ronald\n\n\n\n\n     An approximate calculation ofthe Trust's Judgment against Ronald Lee with prejudgment and post-\njudgment interest in accordance with the Fourteenth Court of Appeals' opinion is attached hereto as\nExhibit A.\n\n\nDEFENDANT'S OBJEcnoNs, QpposraoN, AND RESPONSE TO\nAPPLICATION TO APPROVE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT                                                   PAGES\n\fLee's interest, providing a windfall to him in violation of Legacy's duties as Receiver. While\n\nLegacy has the authority to compromise and settle all debts owed to the Trust, it is also charged\n\nwith all duties of a trustee under the Trust.'- Legacy owes fiduciary duties to all beneficiaries of\n\nthe Trust to exercise good faith in protecting the assets of the Trust and discharging its duties as a\n\nprudent person would ordinarily exercise in the management of his or her own affairs. The\n\nagreement to allow Ronald Lee to satisfy the Judgment is in violation of Legacy's duties.\n\n       Based on the foregoing, Susan Lee requests that the Court deny Legacy's Applicafion to\n\nApprove the Settlement Agreement and deny Legacy authority to enter into the agreement as\n\npresented.\n\n       B.      Ronald Lee's transfer of the River Bend Farm Property\n               is of no benefit to the Trust.\n\n       Legacy's Settlement Agreement also calls for the settlement of issues related to Ronald\n\nLee's interest in property known as the River Bend Farm Property, consisting of approximately\n\n640 acres in Wharton County, Texas. Legacy's Application states that Ronald Lee acquired a 25%\n\ninterest in this property from the estate of his father and the Trust acquired a 50% interest under\n\nthe Bamhart Will. The agreement calls for Ronald Lee to deed his interest in the River Bend Farm\n\nProperty to Legacy. The problem here is that Ronald Lee has no interest in the River Bend Farm\n\nProperty. Legacy's Application fails to infonn the Court that Ronald Lee's interest in the River\n\nBend Farm Property was foreclosed upon for failure to pay taxes. Susan Lee as Trustee of the\n\nTmst later redeemed that interest. Therefore, the conveyance of Ronald Lee's interest in the River\n\nBend Farm Property is worthless to the Trust, because it already ovms his interest. Whatever\n\nconsideration is given to Ronald Lee for the value of his interest in the property for the transfer\n\n\n\n\n^    Order Removing Trusting and Appointing Receiver f 3.a, June 18,2015.\n\nDEFENDANT'S OBJECTIONS, OPPOSITION, AND RESPONSE TO\nAPPLICATION TO APPROVE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT                                                    PAGE 4\n\fshould be nullilied. hi this regard, the purported Settlement Agreement is not in the best ofthe\n\nTrust and Legacy's Application to Approve the Settlement Agreement in this regard should also\n\nbe denied.\n\n        WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Susan Lee respectfully request that the\n\nCourt: (1) decline to approve the terms ofthe Proposed Settlement Agreement; (2) find that the\n\nproposed settlement agreement is not in the best interest of the Trust; and (3) deny Legacy in its\n\ncapacity as receiver the authority to enter into the proposed settlement agreement on behalf of the\n\nTrust.

Defendant hereby asserts a general denial as to each and every allegation\n\ncontained in Tom Thomas, Dan Sheehan, and Marc Culp's (hereinafter sometimes referred to\n\ncollectively as the \"Plaintiffs\") Original Petition as authorized by Rule 92 of the Texas Rules of\n\nCivil Procedure.   Defendant requests that the Court require Plaintiffs to prove their claims,\n\ncharges, and allegations as required by the Constitution and the laws of the State of Texas.\n\n          3.   Defendant respectfully reserves the right tq file an amended answer in response to\n\nPlaintiffs Original Petition in the manner which is authorized by the Texas Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure.\n\n                                        Verified Denial\n\n          4.   Without waiving the foregoing general denial, Defendant hereby asserts the\n\nfollowing verified denial:\n\n          a.   Defendant denies the existence of a valid contract (a.k.a. - a written fee\n\n               agreement) between the Plaintiffs and the Trustee of the Article I V Trust that was\n\n               created by the Last Will and Testament of Katherine Pillot Lee Bamhart,\n\n               Deceased (hereinafter referred to as the \"Article IV Trusf).\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                               2|P .i g e\n0050812\n\f                                     Additional Defenses\n\n          5.   Without waiving the foregoing general denial or verified denial, Defendant\n\nhereby assets the following defenses:\n\n          a.   Defendant asserts that a duly-authorized Trustee for the Article IV Trust did not\n\n               sign the written fee agreement, and, as a result, no Trustee ofthe Article I V Trust\n\n               (nor the assets of the Article IV Trust) are bound by the terms and provisions of\n\n               the agreement.\n\n\n          b.   Defendant asserts the defense of res judicata;\n\n\n          c.   Defendant asserts the defense of claim preclusion;\n\n\n          d.   Defendant asserts the defense of issue preclusion;\n\n\n          e.   To the extent that Plaintiffs seek to recover a contingent fee from Susan Lee's or\n\n               Susan Gibson's beneficial interest in the Article I V Trust by virtue of the fee\n\n               agreement. Defendant asserts that such a recovery is barred by the spendthrift\n\n               clause which is a part of the Article IV Trust;\n\n\n          f.   Defendant asserts the defense of estoppel;\n\n\n          g.   Defendant asserts the defense of quasi-estoppel;\n\n\n          h.   Defendant asserts the defense of acceptance of benefits;\n\n\n          i.   Defendant asserts the defense of laches; and\n\n\n          j.   Defendant asserts the defense of limitations.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             3I P aa c\n0050812\n\f          k.   Defendant asserts that plaintiffs' claims to entitlement to attorneys' fees are\n\n               barred by Texas Government Code §82.065(a).\n\n\n                                      Plea I n Abatement\n\n          6.   Without waiving the foregoing general denial, verified denial, or defenses,\n\nDefendant moves to abate these proceedings pending a ruling from Harris Coimty Probate Court\n\nNumber Two (2) on Defendant's Motion to Transfer Lawsuit to Statutory Probate Court which\n\nDefendant previously filed with Harris County Probate Court Number Two (2) on May 13, 2016\n\nunder Cause Number 137,506-403.\n\n                                         Counterclaim\n\n          7.   Subject to the foregoing Motion to Transfer Venue, Defendant Legacy Trust\n\nCompany, N.A., in its capacity as Receiver for the Article IV Trust created by the Last Will and\n\nTestament of Katherine Pillot Lee Bamhart, Deceased appointed by the Probate Court No. 2 of\n\nHarris County asserts the following counterclaims against Plaintiffs Tom Thomas, Dan Sheehan,\n\nand Marc Culp.\n\n          8.   Defendants Tom Thomas, Dan Sheehan, and Marc Culp have asserted claims\n\nagainst Legacy for legal fees they claim are owed by the trustee of the Article IV Trust. Legacy\n\nis the court-appointed Receiver for the Article IV Trust, invested with all the power of the tmstee\n\nofthe Article IV Trast.\n\n          9.   The original trastee of the Article I V Trust was Ronald E. Lee, Jr. (hereinafter\n\nreferred to as \"Mr. Lee\"). Under the Last Will and Testament ofKatherine Pillot Lee Bamhart\n\n(hereinafter referred to as the \"Bamhart Will\"), in the event Mr. Lee failed to serve as trustee, the\n\nArticle IV Trast was to be managed by co-trustees (1) Susan Camille Lee and (2) Texas\n\nCommerce Bank, N.A. or any successor to that bank. In the event that Texas Commerce Bank,\n\n\n                                                                                            ' 4IPag   e\n0050812\n\fN.A. or its successors failed to serve, another financial institution with trust powers was required\n\nby the Barnhart Will to be appointed.\n\n          10.   Mr. Lee was removed as trustee of the Article IV Trust on February 8, 2002. The\n\nsuccessor to Texas Commerce Bank, N.A. at that time was JP Morgan Chase Bank. JP Morgan\n\nChase Bank declined to serve as co-trustee after Susan Camille Lee specifically requested that it\n\nnot serve with her as co-trustee. Susan Camille Lee never sought or obtained the appointment of\n\na substitute co-trustee as required by the Barnhart Will and Texas law.\n\n          11.   No agreement was ever signed by any trustee of the Article I V Trust with Tom\n\nThomas, Dan Sheehan or Marc Culp, or with the law firm of Thomas, Sheehan & Culp, L.L.P.,\n\nfor (1) the provision of legal services to the trustee of the Article I V Trust, (2) the payment of a\n\ncontingent fee for legal services to the trustee of the Article IV Trust or on behalf of the Article\n\nIV Trust, or (3) the payment of a debt for legal services of another person. Notwithstanding the\n\nlack of any such agreement, Messrs. Thomas, Sheehan and Culp have asserted claims against\n\nLegacy in its capacity as court-appointed Receiver of the Article IV Trust for a contingent fee\n\nbased on collections by Mr. Lee as a former trustee of the Article IV Trust, collections by\n\nLegacy as Receiver of the Article IV Trust, and asserted entitlement to collect a contingent fee\n\nbased on future collections by Legacy as Receiver of the Article I V Trust.\n\n          12.   Susan Camille Lee was not a co-tmstee of the Article IV Trust when she signed\n\nthe contingency fee agreement in her individual capacity in 1995. In fact, she would not become\n\neven a co-trustee for another seven years. When Susan Camille Lee eventually became a co-\n\ntrustee, she never sought or obtained appointment of a co-trustee as required under the Article IV\n\nTrust, a clear violation of the terms of the Trust and the intent of Katherine Pillot Lee Barnhart\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             5IP   a a e'\n0050812\n\fwhen she executed the Barnhart Will. Susan Camille Lee never had the power to bind the Article\n\nIV Trust to the contingency fee agreement.\n\n          13.       Legacy is placed at jeopardy based on these claims, and pursuant to T E X . CiV.\n\nPRAC. & R E M . CODE       §37.005 asks this Court to declare that, under the terms of the Barnhart\n\nWill, the Article IV Trust, and Texas law, the purported March 30, 1995 contingency fee\n\nagreement among Thomas, Sheehan & Culp, LLP, Susan Lee, and Susan Gibson does not today\n\nbind a lawfully appointed Trustee or Receiver of the Article I V Trust. Legacy seeks this relief to\n\nforeclose current and future claims by Plaintiffs against Legacy under the contingency fee\n\nagreement.\n\n          14.

Lee in Harris County Probate\n\nCourt Number Two (2) (the \"Probate Court\"). TSC however filed their Original\n\nPetition in the 162'^'* Judicial District o f Dallas County on April 20, 2016 (the\n\n\"Dallas L a w s u i f ) . Legacy was appointed Receiver over the Trust by the Probate\n\nCourt. Legacy filed, in the Dallas Lawsuit, a Plea in Abatement and Motion to\n\nTransfer that challenged the venue o f the Dallas court, and subject to those\n\nmotions, an Answer and Counterclaim that asserted among other things that TSC\n\nhad only a fee agreement with their clients Susan Camille Lee and Susan Campbell\n\nGibson, and not any trustee o f the Trust, and in any event were barred by the Final\n\nJudgment awarding attorneys' fees entered by the Harris County Probate Court i n\n\nLee V. Lee. See Tab 1.\n\n        On May 13, 2016, Legacy filed a motion asking the Probate Court to transfer\n\nthe Dallas County Lawsuit to the Probate Court under Texas Estates Code § 34.001\n\n\n\n5631319v2                                 1\n\fas it was a matter related to a probate proceeding pending i n the Probate Court.\n\nThe Probate Court granted Legacy's Motion. Legacy served discovery requests on\n\nTSC regarding their breach o f contract action.^ Relators subsequently filed their\n\nPetition for Writ o f Mandamus pending in the above numbered and styled case. A t\n\nits most basic level, Relators have asserted that the Probate Court does not have\n\njurisdiction such that it could transfer the litigation to itself from 16T^^ Judicial\n\nDistrict Court i n Dallas County under Texas Estates Code § 34.001. Relators now\n\nhave filed a Motion for Emergency Stay o f Proceedings seeking to avoid having to\n\nproduce discovery in this matter and the Court subsequently granted the request for\n\nEmergency Stay on July 8, 2016.\n\n        Save for TSC's upcoming deadline to respond to discovery requests from\n\nLegacy, Legacy represents to the Court that there are no other pending deadlines in\n\nplace for this case at the present time.\n\n        No matter whether TSC's claims move forward in the Probate Court or\n\nDallas County District Court, TSC w i l l have to respond to discovery properly\n\nrequested by Legacy. TSC is simply seeking to avoid making discovery available\n\non its own claims for reasons unknown.\n\n\n\n\n See Tab 1 to Relator's Motion for Emergency Stay of Proceedings.\n\n\n\n5631319v2                                    0\n\f                             Argument      and    Authorities\n\n1.          The Emergency Stay Serves Only to Delay Necessary\n            Proceedings, Prejudicing Legacy.\n        A.        Absent compelling circumstances, a stay is improper.\n\n            The request for an emergency stay is an extraordinary measure provided for\n\nin the Texas Rules o f Appellate Procedure.          See T E X . R . A P P . P. 52.10.   The\n\nSupreme Court o f Texas has provided that \"[f]or a court o f appeals to stay\n\nproceedings i n the trial court while it considers an interlocutory appeal increases\n\ndelay and expense and should not be done absent compelling circumstances.\"\n\nCoal, of Cities for Affordable      Util. Rates v. Third Court of Appeals,     1^1 S.W.2d\n\n946, 947 (Tex. 1990) (per curiam). No such compelling circumstances exist here.\n\n            B.    No compelling circumstances exist for a stay.\n\n        Relators' sole basis for requesting a \"stay o f the trial court's proceedings\" is\n\nto avoid having to respond to Legacy's discovery about their claims against\n\nLegacy.          Relators have shown no \"compelling circumstances\" for avoiding\n\ndiscovery. Regardless o f whether TSC's Petition for Writ o f Mandamus is ruled on\n\nby this Court prior to August 15, or i f that petition is granted or denied, it w i l l not\n\nchange i n any way the need for TSC to respond to discovery requests from Legacy\n\nabout TSC's own claims. The discovery w i l l remain necessary and probative for\n\nthe resolution o f this matter either by settlement or trial, regardless o f whether the\n\nlawsuit proceeds in the Probate Court or District Court i n Dallas County. The\n\n\n5631319v2                                    3\n\fCourt's stay o f the proceedings does nothing more than further protract this\n\nlitigation and require the further delay and expense that the Texas Supreme Court\n\nwarned against in Coal, of Cities. See Coal, of Cities, 1^1 S.W.2d at 947.\n\n        Relators have conceded that Legacy has already agreed to an extension o f\n\nthe time period for which TSC may respond to Legacy's discovery requests until\n\nAugust 15, 2016. A true and correct copy o f the proposed discovery response\n\nextension agreement that counsel for Legacy has sent to counsel for Relators is\n\nattached to this pleading within Tab 2. Relators admitted i n their own Motion for\n\nEmergency Stay that they have tentatively agreed to such relief.^\n\n        Contrary to Relators' bald assertion, they have shown no prejudice by\n\nongoing discovery in the trial court. They argue, without citing any authority, that\n\nthey carmot send discovery to Legacy without \"risk o f waiver o f arguments made\n\nin TSC's plea in abatement.\" Even i f that were true, that is easily avoided by a\n\nRule 11 agreement as Legacy has offered not to assert such a waiver. A true and\n\ncorrect copy o f counsel for Legacy's offer to stipulate that responding to discovery\n\nwould not waive Relators' plea in abatement is attached to this pleading within\n\nTab 3.\n\n        On the other hand. Legacy and the beneficiaries o f the Trust over which\n\nLegacy is the Receiver are prejudiced by this stay. Legacy is charged by the order\n\n\n^ Motion for Emergency Stay at 6.\n\n\n\n5631319v2                                4\n\fof the Probate Court appointing Legacy as Receiver for the Article I V Trust under\n\nthe Last W i l l and Testament o f Katherine Pillot Lee Bamhart with performing the\n\nfunctions o f the trustee o f that Trust, which includes the mandatory distribution o f\n\nincome o f the Trust.

Legacy has its principal place of business in Harris County. The Plaintiff Lawyers\n\nbase their claim on the March 30, 1995 written fee agreement signed by Dan Sheehan, on behalf of\n\nThomas, Sheehan & Culp, LLP, and clients Susan Camille Lee (hereinafter referred to as \"Ms. Lee\"),\n\n                                                   . 1\n0050733\n\findividually, and Ms. Lee's daughter Susan Campbell Gibson (hereinafter referred to as \"Ms.\n\nGibson\"), individually, under which the law firm agreed to represent these clients for a mixture of\n\nhourly fees and contingent fees in a lawsuit Ms. Lee filed in 1988 in Probate Court No. 2 of Harris\n\nCounty, In the Estate of Katherine Pillot Lee Barnhart, Deceased — Susan Lee et al v. Ronald E. Lee,\n\nJr., individually, as Independent Executor of the Estate and as Trustee of the Article IV Trust under\n\nthe Last Will and Testament of Katherine Pillot Lee Barnhart, No. 137,506 (hereinafter referred to as\n\nthe \"Probate Court Lawsuit\").'     The Probate Court Lawsuit was tried and a judgment entered in\n\n1996, the judgment was modified on appeal in 2002, and Ms. Lee and Ms. Gibson were awarded\n\nspecific attorneys' fees paid from the Article I V Trust. The judgment also ordered defendant Ronald\n\nE. Lee, Jr., a resident of Harris County, to reimburse the Article IV Trust for certain expenses. Per\n\nPlaintiffs' Original Petition which is attached hereto as Exhibit \" 1 \" , the Plaintiff Lawyers claim they\n\nare entitled to collect a contingent fee based on amounts collected in Harris County 1) in 1997 by the\n\nTrustee of the Article IV Trust on the judgment entered in the Probate Court Lawsuit in 1996, 2) in\n\n2015 by Legacy as court-appointed Receiver for the Article IV Trust in 2015, and 3) in 2016\n\npursuant to a settlement agreement approved in 2016 by Harris County Probate Court No. 2. The\n\nPlaintiff Lawyers do not seek contingent fees awarded to their clients Ms. Lee and Ms. Gibson, but\n\nrather from the Article IV Trust despite the fact that the Trustee of the Article IV Trust was not a\n\nparty to the fee agreement. See Exhibit \"A\" to Plaintiffs' Original Petition. There is ongoing\n\nlitigation in Harris County Probate Court No. 2 conceming the Article IV Trust to which Legacy, Ms.\n\nLee, and Ms. Gibson are parties. Plaintiff Sheehan in fact is counsel for Ms. Lee and Ms. Gibson in\n\nthat litigation.\n\n\n\n\n ' A copy of the alleged fee agreement between the Plaintiff Lawyers, Ms. Lee and Ms. Gibson is\n attached to Plaintiffs' Original Petition at page 22 as Exhibit \"A\".\n\n\n                                                     2\n 0050733\n\f                                  Summary of Argument\n       A motion to transfer venue is the proper vehicle for a defendant to raise a challenge to the\n\nplaintiffs venue choice.

Plaintffs'allegations ofvenue in Dallas County are incorrect.\n\n        2. Venue is proper in Harris County, and particularly in Probate Court No. 2 of Harris\n\n             County, because the claims asserted in this lawsuit directly involve prior judgments and\n\n             rulings of Probate Court No. 2 of Harris County, and ongoing litigation on related matters\n\n              in that court.\n\n        3. Dallas County is an inappropriate and inconvenient forum for the adjudication of this\n\n              dispute.\n\n        Legacy has previously filed a motion in Probate Court No. 2 of Harris County requesting\n\nthat court to exercise its power conferred under Texas Estates Code §34.001 to order this case\n\ntransferred from this Court to Probate Court No. 2 of Harris County. A hearing on that motion is set\n\nfor June 7, 2016. If that motion is granted, this motion will be moot.\n\n                                             Argument\n 1.        Venue for this Lawsuit is Only Proper in Probate Court No. 2 of Harris\n           County.\n\n           Section 15.002(a) of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code provides in relevant part\n\n that, except where otherwise provided by statute, \"all lawsuits shall be brought \"(1) in the county in\n\n which all or a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred; ... or (3)\n\n in the county ofthe defendant's principal office in this state, if the defendant is not a natural person.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                     3\n 0050733\n\fOnly if these provisions do not apply may the plaintiff sue in the county of his or her residence under\n\nSection 15.002(a)(4).\n\n        Harris County is the only county where all or a substantial part of the events or omissions\n\ngiving rise to the claim occurred. The Article IV Trust (and the underlying probate of the will that\n\ncreated the trust), the Receiver, the lawsuit through which the Plaintiff Lawyers claim their\n\ncontingency fee was earned, the payments to the Article IV Trust arising out of that lawsuit, Susan\n\nLee, and Susan Gibson - all ofthe people, acts or omissions giving rise to the cause of action - were\n\nsituated or occurred in Harris County.\n\n        1. A plain reading of the fee agreement shows that the Susan Lee was a resident of Harris\n\n                 County at the time that she signed the agreement, and that the agreement pertained to a\n\n                 lawsuit she had already filed in Harris County in 1988.\n\n        2.       Ms. Gibson, Ms. Lee's daughter, was a resident of Harris County with her mother when\n\n                 the agreement was signed in 1995, although she was attending Pine Manor College in\n\n                 Massachusetts during the school year.\n\n         3. The sole basis on which the Plaintiff Lawyers claim they are entitled to collect the\n\n                 additional contingency fee is that the Trustee and the Receiver for the Article IV Trust\n\n                 collected money in Harris County pursuant to a Harris County judgment.\n\n            4.   The situs of that Article IV Trust was maintained in Harris County since the Trust was\n\n                 created by the Last Will and Testament of Katherine Pillot Lee Bamhart, Deceased,\n\n                 probated in Harris County, and under the supervision of Probate Court No. 2 in Harris\n\n                 County.\n\n            5. Legacy, as court-appointed Receiver of the Article IV Trust with all the powers of a\n\n                 trustee, resides in Harris County, and thus the funds from which the Plaintiff Lawyers\n\n                  seek to recover are located in Harris County.\n\n\n\n                                                         4\n  0050733\n\f          Therefore, venue of this lawsuit is proper only in Harris County, Texas. See TEX. CIV. PRAC.\n\n& REM. CODE     §15.002(a)(1).\n\n          Plaintiffs allege, correctly, that defendant Legacy is a nationally chartered non-depository\n\ntrust company with its principal place of business in Houston, Harris County, Texas. Movant is\n\nnot a natural person. Given the fact that Legacy's principal office is located in Harris County,\n\nvenue of the lawsuit is proper in Harris County, Texas. See TEX. Civ. PRAC. & R E M . CODE\n\n§ 15.002(a)(3).\n\n          The Plaintiff Lawyers claim venue is proper in Dallas County under TEX. C I V . PRAC. &\n\nR E M . CODE   §64.052(b) which provides that \"a suit against a receiver may be brought where the\n\nperson whose property is in receivership resides.\" However, §64.052(b) is a basis for proper\n\nvenue in Harris County, not Dallas County. Legacy is the Receiver for the Article I V Trust, and\n\nas such, holds title to the assets of the Article IV Trust. Venue is proper in Harris County as\n\nLegacy's principal place of business is in Houston, Harris County, Texas.\n\n          Texas Property Code §115.002(c-l) also provides that \" . . . i f the settlor is deceased and an\n\nadministration of the settlor's estate is pending in this state, an action involving the interpretation\n\nand administration of ... a testamentary tmst created by the settlor's will may be brought... (2)\n\nin the county in which the administration of the settlor's estate is pending.\"^ In this case, the\n\nPlaintiff Lawyers seek to have a contingent fee awarded to them from the Article IV Trust, a\n\ntestamentary trust created by Settlor Katherine Pillot Lee Bamhart (now deceased).                   The\n\nadministration of the Estate of Katherine Lee Pillot Lee Barnhart, Deceased is presently pending\n\n\n\n\n^ Likewise, ESTATES CODE §33.002 provides that venue for a cause of action related to a probate\nproceeding pending in a statutory probate court (other than a cause of action against a personal\nrepresentative for personal injury, death, or property damage) is proper in the statutory probate\ncourt in which the decedent's estate is pending.\n\n\n                                                     5\n0050733\n\fin Harris County Probate Court Number 2. Venue of the lawsuit is therefore proper in Probate\n\nCourt No. 2 of Harris County.\n\n          Even i f venue were proper in Dallas County, there are compelling reasons for this Court\n\nto transfer this case to Probate Court No. 2 in Harris County under TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\n§ 15.002(b). Not only is venue unquestionably proper in that court, the following reasons make\n\ntransfer to that Court the only reasonable choice in the exercise of this court's power to transfer under\n\nTEX. CIV. PRAC. REM. CODE       §15.002(b:\n\n          1.      Parties to this lawsuit are already parties        to pending    litigation   involving\n\n               overlapping issues in Probate Court No. 2 of Harris County.\n\n          2.      Plaintiffs' claims involve the interpretation of orders and judgments entered by\n\n               Probate Court No. 2 of Harris County. The Honorable Mike Wood, Judge of Probate\n\n               Court No. 2, presided over the trial and entered the very judgment that addressed both\n\n               attorneys' fees and the obligations of the trustee of the Article IV Trust at issue in the\n\n               Plaintiff Lawyers' claims for a contingent fee. Judge Wood is likewise supervising\n\n               Legacy as Receiver for the Article IV Trust.\n\n          3.      Any judgment entered against Legacy as Receiver for the Article IV Trust in this\n\n               court must be referred to Probate Court No. 2, the court that appointed it Receiver, for\n\n               enforcement first under Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code §64.055. Campbell v.\n\n               Wood, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">811</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">753</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 756 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist] 1991, no writ).\n\n          Under these circumstances, maintenance of the action in Dallas County, rather than in the\n\ncourt that was and is directly involved in all matters pertinent to this dispute, would work an\n\ninjustice to Legacy and the beneficiaries of the Article I V Trust. The balance of interests o f a l l\n\nparties clearly favors proceedings in Probate Court No. 2, and a transfer to that court will not\n\nwork any injustice as to any party.\n\n                                                     6\n0050733\n\f       A,        Probate Court No, 2 is already adjudicating related issues\n                 involving the same parties.\n\n          The Plaintiff Lawyers' claims are but one part of an ongoing dispute entirely presided\n\nover by Probate Court No. 2 since 1988 concerning the management ofthe Article I V Trust. The\n\nmost recent chapter of that dispute led to that court removing the Plaintiff Lawyers' client Ms.\n\nLee as a substitute trustee ofthe Trust, and the appointment of defendant Legacy as Receiver for\n\nthe trust. See Exhibit B to Plaintiffs' Original Petition, \"Order Removing Trustee and\n\nAppointing Receiver,\" dated June 18, 2015. Also actively in dispute before Probate Court No. 2\n\nis Ms. Lee's claim that the terms ofthe settlement agreed to by Legacy and Mr. Ronald E. Lee,\n\nJr., under which Legacy has collected the judgment in favor ofthe Article IV Trust on which the\n\nPlaintiff Lawyers seek to collect contingent fees, should not be approved by that court. See\n\nExhibit \"2\" to this Motion, \"Defendant Susan Lee's Objections, Opposition, and Response to\n\nApplication to Approve Settlement Agreement.\" Dan Sheehan, a plaintiff here, is counsel for\n\nboth Ms. Lee and Ms. Gibson in the ongoing disputes in Probate Court No. 2. He served as lead\n\ncounsel for Ms. Lee in Probate Court No. 2 in a previous chapter, which is the basis for the\n\nclaims asserted in this lawsuit. It serves no legitimate purpose to involve a different court in a\n\ndifferent venue in the adjudication of this lawsuit.-^\n\n\n          B.     Plaintiffs' claims require the interpretation and enforcement of\n                 the orders and judgments of Probate Court No. 2.\n\n          Why did Sheehan and his former partners sue in Dallas, rather than in Probate Court No.\n\n2? The answer probably lies in the fact that their claims are foreclosed by that court's Final\n\nJudgment, dated October 25, 1996 in the very lawsuit to which the contingent fee agreement\n\n\n^ The Local Rules of the Dallas District Courts recognize the desirability of transferring cases\n\"related to another case previously filed in or disposed of by another Court\" in Rules 1.06 and\n1.07. While these rules are not directly applicable here, the principle is the same.\n\n\n                                                  fl\n0050733\n\fpertains, Susan Lee et al v. Ronald E. Lee, Jr., No 137,506. It is payments toward this same\n\njudgment on which the Plaintiff Lawyers base their attorneys' fee claims. These same lawyers,\n\nMs. Lee, and Ms. Gibson were parties to a stipulation that was incorporated into that Final\n\nJudgment dated October 25, 1996, which states in relevant part:\n\n                Based upon the stipulation of the counsel for the parties and the\n                undisputed or admitted facts, the Court finds that i) Susan C. Lee's\n                attomeys were paid reasonable and necessary fees of\n                $1,000,000.00 for the prosecution of this action; ii) attomeys\n                representing Susan C. Gibson, individually, and Susan C. Lee as\n                Trustee of the Article V Trust for Susan C. Gibson, were paid\n                reasonable and necessary fees of $500,000.00 for the prosecution\n                of this action . . . . The Court further finds that Plaintiffs are\n                entitled to judgment directing and authorizing the Executor of the\n                Estate and Tmstee of the Article IV Trust to reimburse Susan C.\n                Lee, individually and Susan C. Lee as Trustee of the Article Y\n                Tmst for Susan C. Gibson for the aforesaid attomeys' fees from the\n                assets ofthe Estate and/or the Article I V Trast, and after such\n                payment or reimbursement, Plaintiffs are not entitled to any\n                additional attorneys'fees for the trial of this action.\n\nFinal Judgment, October 25, 1996, Lee v. Lee, No. 137,506, p. 3 (emphasis added), attached as\n\nExhibit C to Plaintiffs' Original Petition at p. 037. Notwithstanding this order, under which the\n\nPlaintiff Lawyers received their fees, they now claim they are entitled to additional contingent\n\nfees. The proper court for interpreting and applying this order in this lawsuit is the one that\n\nissued it - Probate Court No. 2.      Moreover, it is Probate Court No. 2 that appointed and\n\nsupervises Legacy as Receiver for the Article I V Trust, and has power over the administration of\n\nthe Article IV Trust created by the Will of Katherine Pillot Lee Barnhart, whose estate was\n\nprobated in that court.\n\n          The same fee agreement on which plaintiffs base their claim was also the subject of a\n\nprevious jury trial before Judge Wood in Harris County Probate Court No.2, where another\n\nlawyer claiming under it sued Ms. Lee to collect fees. Donna Kline v. Susan Camille Lee, No.\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n0050733\n\f137,506-403. See Exhibit J to Plaintiffs' Original Petition at p. 143. Plaintiff Sheehan defended\n\nMs. Lee in that lawsuit. (Neither the then-trustee of the Article IV Trust nor Legacy was a party\n\nto that lawsuit.) The Plaintiff Lawyers now seek to have fees awarded to themselves under the\n\nvery same fee agreement that was previously litigated in Harris County Probate Court No. 2.\n\n          C.     Allowing this lawsuit to proceed in Dallas needlessly duplicates\n                 proceedings, wasting judicial resources.\n\n          Even i f a judgment were entered against Legacy here, Texas law would require the\n\nPlaintiff Lawyers to go to Harris County Probate Court No. 2 to enforce it. When ajudgment has\n\nbeen entered by a court against a receiver in its official capacity, the enforcement action must be\n\nreferred to the court that appointed the receiver.

Pursuant to the terms of the CFA, TSC served as lead counsel for Plaintiffs through\n\nentry of a final judgment in the Probate Court.\n\n        22.     But for TSC's efforts, expertise and hard work the favorable Trial Court Judgment\n\nwould not have been obtained.\n\n        23.     Attached as Exhibit \" C \" is a true and correct copy of the final judgment entered by\n\nthe Probate Court. (\"Trial Court Judgment\").\n\n        24.

At pages 2,3, paragraph 7, the Legacy Settlement Agreement recites that the Article\n\nIV Trust Judgment, \"constitutes a debt owed to the Trust and an asset of the Article IV Trust.\"\n\n        36.      At page 3, paragraph 8, the Legacy Settlement Agreement further recites that, \"Mr.\n\nLee has made payment for the benefit ofthe Article IV Trust on the Judgment, including a payment\n\nof $8 million in 2015.\" (\"$8 Million Cash Payment\").\n\n         37.     Additionally, under the terms ofthe Legacy Settlement Agreement, paragraphs 15,16,\n\n and 19, Ronald Lee was obligated to deliver, among other things, a $4 miUion promissory note (\"S4\n\n Million Promissory Note\").\n\n         38.     On information and belief, Ronald Lee has delivered and the Article IV Trust has\n\n accepted the $8 Million Cash Payment, the $4 Million Promissory Note, and other consideration\n\n recited in the Legacy Settiement Agreement in partial satisfaction of the Article IV Trust Judgment.\n\n\n\n PLAINTIFFS' ORIGINAL PETITION - Page 5\n\f        39..

Following entry of the Order Granting Application to Approve Settlement Agreement,\n\nLegacy, on or about March 28,2016, filed a document in the Probate Court entitled, \"Satisfaction of\n\n.Tudgment.\"\n\n        41.     In that document. Legacy represents that the Article IV Judgment \"has been fully\n\npaid, satisfied and discharged\" based upon the terms of the Legacy Settlement Agreement.\n\n        42.     Prior to Legacy's filing of the Satisfaction of Judgment, Susan Lee, on March 22,\n\n2016, filed a notice of appeal seeking appellate review of the Probate Court's Order approving the\n\nLegacy Settiement Agreement (\"Susan Lee Appeal\")\n\n        43.     As ofthe filing of this suit, the Susan Lee Appeal remains pending.\n\n        44.      On information and belief, Plaintiffs anticipate that Susan Lee w i l l contend in her\n\nappeal, among other things, that the Legacy Settiement Agreement did not fully pay and satisfy the\n\nArticle IV Trust Judgment.\n\n        45.      This lawsuit only seeks relief as to recoveries received by the Article IV Trust through\n\nthe time of the trial of this case, expressly reserving the right to seek further enforcement ofthe CFA\n\ni f subsequent recoveries upon the Article IV Trust Judgment are received including, but not limited\n\nto, any recoveries subsequently obtained as a result of the Susan Lee Appeal.\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFFS' ORIGINAL PETITION - Page 6\n\fJurisdictional Basis for Suit\n\n       46.     This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this case, because the amount in\n\ncontroversy exceeds the minimum jurisdictional limits of this Court.\n\nBasis for Venue in Dallas Comity\n\n       47.     Pursuant-to section 64.052(b) ofthe Civil Practices & Remedies Code (\"CPRC\"),\n\nvenue over this case is properly vested in Dallas County, Texas, because Thomas and Sheehan reside\n\nin Dallas County, Texas and this is a suit against a receiver holding property belonging to Thomas\n\nand Sheehan.\n\n        48.     Pursuant to CPRC section 15.002(a)(1), venue over this case also is properly vested in\n\nDallas County, Texas, because the contractual relationship placed at issue by this suit was formed\n\nand performed in material respects in Dallas County, Texas, and more generally, a substantial part of\n\nthe events giving rise to the claims raised by this suit occurred in Dallas County, Texas. More\n\nspecifically, the Contingent Fee Agreement was negotiated by means of telephone discussions,\n\ntelefax transmittals and mailings to and from Dallas, Texas, the CFA was signed by TSC in Dallas,\n\nTexas, all billings for work performed under the CFA originated from Dallas, Texas, all payments\n\nfor such invoiced work were received in Dallas, Texas, much of the communication related to the\n\nperformance of the CFA emanated from Dallas, Texas, and a substantial amount of the worked\n\nperformed under the terms of the CFA was performed in Dallas, Texas.\n\n        49.     Pursuant to CPRC section 15.003(a), venue over this case also is properly vested in\n\n Dallas County, Texas, because joinder of one or more of the Plaintiffs is proper under the Texas\n\n Rules of Civil Procedure (\"TRCP\"), venue as to each Plaintiff in Dallas County does not unfairly\n\n prejudice another party to the suit, there is an essential need to have each Plaintiffs claim tried in\n\n\n\n\n PLAINTIFFS'ORIGINAL PETITION-Page 7        :\n\fDallas County, and Dallas County is a fair and convenient venue for each Plaintiff and all persons\n\nagainst whom this suit is brought.\n\n                           FACTUAL A L L E G A T I O N S SUPPORTING C L A I M S\n\n\nThe Contingent Fee Agreement\n\n        50.     In the spring of 1995, TSC took over lead counsel responsibility for handling\n\nlitigation brought by a sister, Susan Lee, against her brother, Ronald Lee.\n\n        51.     The dispute arose over Ronald Lee's administration of an estate of their grandmother,\n\nKatherine Pillot Lee Barnhart (\"Katherine Barnhart\"), and certain related trusts, including the\n\nArticle IV Trust.\n\n        52.     At the time of suit filing, Ronald Lee was the executor ofthe estate and the trustee of\n\nthe Article IV Trust.\n\n        53.      Ronald Lee and Susan Lee were the only beneficiaries under the terms of the Article\n\nIVTrust.\n\n        54..     Before TSC accepted the engagement, the Contingent Fee Agreement was entered\n\ninto by and between TSC, Susan Lee, her daughter, Susan Gibson, and Donna Kline.\n\n         55.     Susan Gibson was a beneficiary of another trust established under the terms of\n\n Katherine Bamhart's will.\n\n         56.     Donna Kline was a duly licensed attomey authorized to practice law in the State of\n\n Texas, who had been involved in the representation of Susan Lee and Susan Gibson in the Lee v. Lee\n\n Litigation before TSC was retained.                    .   '\n\n         57.     Sheehan, Kline, Susan Lee, and Susan Gibson each signed the Contingent Fee\n\n Agreement on or about March 30, 1995.\n\n\n\n\n PLAINTIFFS' ORIGINAL PETITION - Page 8\n\f        58.     Pursuant to the terms of the CFA, TSC was to be compensated for handling the Lee v.\n\nLee Litigation through payment of fees based upon reduced regular hourly rates plus 6% of all\n\nrecoveries obtained.\n\n        59.     TSC was fully paid all hourly fees charged under the terms of the CFA.\n\n        60.     The contingent fee agreed to be paid expressly included any recovery obtained on\n\nbehalf of the Article IV Trust; however, neither Susan Lee nor Susan Gibson would be personally\n\nliable for any such fee related to any such recovery obtained for such trust.\n\n        61.      Instead, both Susan Lee and Susan Gibson agreed to support TSC's right to its\n\ncontingent fee interest in any recovery obtained on behalf of the Article IV Trust.\n\n        62.      Susan Lee and Susan Gibson support the claims brought by this suit.\n\nOutcome of the Lee v. Lee Litigation\n\n        63.      Beginning in March 1995 through the end of that year, TSC expended hundreds of\n\nhours in preparation diligently prosecuting the case and preparing it for trial, including the conduct of\n\na juiy trial for several days in the fall of 1995 before a mistrial was granted.\n\n         64.     On January 3, 1996, a second jury trial was started in the Lee V. Lee Litigation. .\n\n         65.     Following an aggressive prosecution of the case in a trial lasting well over a week, a\n\nfavorable jury verdict was obtained on behalf of Susan Lee, Susan Gibson and the Article IV Trust.\n\n         66.     Following nine more months ofbriefing and argument addressing various post trial\n\nmotions, the Trial Court Judgment was entered.\n\n         67.     Under the terms of the Trial Court Judgment, the Article IV Trust was granted a\n\n monetaiy judgment against Ronald Lee for:\n\n                  a. $840,002.00 for Ronald Lee's breach of fiduciary duty related to the Knollwood\n\n                      Development, the River Bend Farm, and the Cap Rock Ranch;\n\n\n\n• PLArNTiFFS'ORIGINAL PETITION - Page 9\n\f               b. $659,506.50 for payment to Ronald Lee of an unreasonable executor fee;\n\n                c. $919,702.12 for prejudgment interest related to the payment of the unreasonable\n\n                    executor fee, plus accruing per diem interest at the rate of $180.69;\n\n                d. $163,550.00 for unreasonable office expenses; and\n\n                e. $157,969.90 for prejudgment interest related to the unreasonable office expenses,\n\n                    plus accruing per diem interest at the rate of 44.81.\n\n        68.     In total, the Article IV Trust was granted a principal monetary judgment recovery\n\nagainst Ronnie Lee in the amount of $1,663,058.50;plus prejudgment interest atlO% per annum,\n\nbringing the total judgment amount against Ronald Lee to $2,758,770.52. (\"Principal Trial Court\n\nJudgment Amount\").\n\n        69.     The Trial Court Judgment also provided for postjudgment interest on the Principal\n\nTrial Court Judgment Amount at the rate of 10% per annum, compounded annually.\n\n        70.     The Trial Court Judgment also expressly denied requested relief to remove Ronald\n\nLee as Trustee of the Article IV Trust.\n\n        71.      But for TS C' s diligent and expert handling of the Lee v. Lee Litigation, the Article IV\n\nTrust would not have obtained the large monetary sum awarded in the Trial Court Judgment.\n\n        72.      A l l parties appealed from the Trial Court Judgment.\n\n        73.      OnMay 17, 2001, the Appellate Opinion in Lee V.Lee was issued and reported at 47\n\nS.W.3d767.\n\n         74.     After the Texas Supreme Court refused petitions for review, the Houston Court of\n\nAppeals issued the Appellate Mandate.\n\n         75.     The appellate process lasted from October, 1996 through issuance ofthe Appellate\n\n Mandate in February, 2002, a total of approximately 5 years and 4 months.\n\n\n PLAINTIFFS'ORlGrNAL PETITION - Page 1 0\n\f       76.        Thomas, Sheehan and Culp provided legal representation in this case throughout the\n\nappellate process.\n\n       77.        Pursuant to the Appellate Mandate, the Article IV Trust's judgment against Ronald\n\nLee was increased materially. ,\n\n       78.        Under the terms ofthe Article IV Tmst's judgment against Ronald Lee as modified by\n\nthe Appellate Mandate, the Article IV Trust was granted an additional principal monetary judgment\n\nagainst Ronald Lee in the amount of $ 1,53 8,843,50 for claims related to the payment of an excessive\n\nexecutor's fee.\n\n       79.        The Appellate Mandate also modified the Trial Court Judgment by: (i) rendering an\n\nadditional principal monetary judgment against Ronald Lee in the amount of $1,500,000.00 based\n\nupon the conclusion that the Article IV Trust should not have been directed to reimburse Ronald Lee\n\nfor attorney's fees incurred when defending the Lee v. Lee Litigation; (ii) removing Ronald Lee as\n\ntrustee of the Article IV Trust; (iii) revising the calculation of prejudgment interest awards; and (iv)\n\ndirecting Ronald Lee to pay all costs of the appeal.\n\n        80.       In sum and as most material to this case, the Appellate Mandate reformed the Trial\n\nCourt Judgment to increase the principal amount of the monetary judgment awarded to the Article IV\n\nTrust against Ronald Lee from $1,663,058.50 to $4,701,902.00, it revised calculations of\n\nprejudgment interest, and it confirmed the award of postjudgment interest on all of the foregoing\n\nsums at 10% per annum, compounded annually. (\"Final Monetary Sum Awarded the Article IV\n\nTrust\").\n\n        81.       But for the diligent and expert handling of the appeal by Thomas, Sheehan and Culp,\n\nthe Article IV Trust would not have obtained such a favorable outcome in the appeal.\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFFS' ORIGINAL PETITION - Page 1 1\n\fThe Donna Kline Litigation\n\n       82.      Before the Lee v. Lee Litigation proceeded to trial, Susan Gibson sent a letter to\n\nDonna Kline demanding that Kline withdraw from her representation in the Lee v. Lee Litigation.\n\n        83.     Kline honored the demand and withdrew from the representation in the fall of 1995.\n\n        84.     Kline subsequently intervened in the Lee v. Lee Litigation to recover unpaid legal fees\n\narising in connection with work performed on two separate lawsuits, including the Lee v. Lee\n\nLitigation. (\"Kline Litigation\").\n\n        85.     The bulk of Kline's claim pertained to representation provided in the Lee v. Lee\n\nLitigation under the terms of the Contingent Fee Agreement.\n\n        86.      On June 27, 1996, the Probate Court signed an order severing the Kline Litigation\n\nfrom the Lee v. Lee Litigation.\n\n        87.      In the Severance Order, the Probate Court directed the Kline Litigation to proceed\n\nforward under Cause No. 137,506-403.\n\n        88. . The Kline Litigation proceeded to ajury tirial beginning on July 15, 1997.\n\n        89.      That trial produced ajury verdict favoring Kline.\n\n        90.      Attached as Exhibit \" H \" is a true and correct copy ofthejury verdict rendered in the\n\nKline Litigation. (\"Kline Jury Verdicf).\n\n         91.     Following receipt of the Kline Jury Verdict, the Probate Court entered judgment in\n\n favor of Donna Kline.\n\n         92.      Attached as Exhibit \" I \" is a true and correct copy of the judgment rendered by the\n\n Probate Court in favor of Donna Kline and against Susan Lee, individually and as trustee for Susan\n\n Gibson, and Susan Gibson, individually. (\"Kline Judgment\").\n\n\n\n\n PLAINTIFFS' ORIGINAL PETITION - Page 1 2\n\f        93.     Among other things, the Kline Judgment awarded Donna Kline a monetaiy recovery\n\nof $114,207.21 for unpaid hourly fees plus an additional $132,500.00 for attorney's fees incurred in\n\nprosecuting the case.\n\n        94.      The Kline Judgment also granted Donna Kline declaratory relief, as follows: \"Based\n\nupon the Jury's answer to Question 2, the Court makes declaratoryjudgment that Donna C. Kline has\n\na good, valid and subsisting interest in any recovery by Susan Camille Lee, individually and as\n\ntrustee for Susan C. Gibson, and Susan C. Gibson individually, pursuant to her contingent fee\n\ncontract of March 30, 1995.\"\n\n        95.      The reference to the contingent fee contract of March 30,1995 is the same Contingent\n\nFee Agreement placed at issue in this case.\n\n        96.      Susan Lee and Susan Gibson appealed the Kline Judgment to the Houston Court of\n\nAppeals.\n\n        97.      On January 13, 2000, the Houston Court of Appeals issued its final decision on\n\nrehearing.\n\n         98.

As material to this case, the Appellate Opinion in the Kline Litigation made the\n\nfollowing rulings related to the Contingent Fee Agreement:\n\n                 a. In addition to agreements to pay both Kline and TSC at hourly rates specified,\n\n                      \"Defendants also expressly agreed to pay . a 10% contingency fee on any\n\n                      'recovery.'\" (Appellate Opinion in Kline Litigation, at *1);\n\n\n\n\n PLAINTIFFS' ORIGINAL PETITION - Page 1 3\n\f               b.     \"It was further agreed that 40% of the 10% contingency fee would be paid to\n\n                      Kline and that the remaining 60% would be paid to Thomas, Sheehan & Culp.\"\n\n                       (M);\n\n                c.

On information and belief based upon evidence currently available to Plaintiffs,\n\nRonald Lee has made or is making three separate sets of monetary payments toward satisfaction of\n\nthe Final Monetary Sum Awarded the Article IV Trust.\n\n        103.    Plaintiffs only learned of the first and second payments during the course of\n\nproceedings related to Legacy's Apphcation to Approve Settlement Agreement in 2016.\n\n        104.    As to the first monetary payment. Legacy presented evidence during hearings on\n\nLegacy's application that Ronald Lee paid the Article IV Trust the sum of $2,816,213.60 on January\n\n9, 1997. .(\"January, 1997 Payment\"),\n\n        105.     Sheehan first learned of this payment in February, 2016, and Thomas and Culp only\n\nlearned of that payment about six weeks later.\n\n         106.    The January, 1997 Payment was made roughly 2 1/2 months after entry of the Trial\n\nCourt Judgment in October of 1996.\n\n         107.    At the time of the January, 1997 Payment, Ronald Lee was the trustee of the Article\n\nIVTrust. •\n\n         108.    Susan Lee did not become the trustee of the Article IV Trust until roughly 5 years\n\nlater when the Appellate Mandate was issued.\n\n         109.    As to the second monetary payment. Legacy attached to its Application to Approve\n\nSettlement Agreement a copy of the proposed settlement agreement between Receiver and Ronald\n\nLee.\n\n         110.    At page 3, paragraph 8 of the recitals, the Legacy Settlement Agreement states, \"Mr.\n\nLee has made payment for the benefit of the Article IV Trust on the Judgment [Final Monetary Sum\n\n\n\n\n PLAINTIFFS'ORIGINAL PETITION - Page .16\n\fAwarded the Articie IV Trust], including a payment of $8,000,000.00 in 2015.\" (\"S8 Million\n\nPayment\").\n\n         111.    This is the first occasion that Sheehan learned of this payment, and Thomas and Culp\n\nonly learned of that payment roughly one month before filing this litigation.\n\n         112.    On information and belief, the third and final series of monetary payments are those\n\ncurrently being made by Ronald Lee to the Article IV Trust pursuant to the terms ofthe $4 Million\n\nPromissory Note.\n\n         113.    Pursuant to the assignment in the CFA, Plaintiffs now own 6% of all such monies\n\ncurrently in the hands of the Receiver.\n\nNon Monetary Recoveries Received and Accepted by the Article I V Trust\n\n         114.    Above and beyond the additional payments still to be made to the Article IV Tmst by\n\nRonald Lee pursuant to the terms of the $4 Million Note, the Legacy Settlement Agreement reflects\n\ntwo other valuable, non monetary considerations received by the Article IV Trust.\n\n         115.    First, at pages 5 and 6, paragraph 19 of the Legacy Settlement Agreement, Ronald Lee\n\nreleases specified alleged claims that Ronald Lee has against the Article IV Trust.\n\n         116.    Six percent of the value of these releases constitutes part of the recovery assigned to\n\nand now owned by Plaintiffs under the terms of the CFA. (\"Release Value\").-\n\n         117.     Second, at page 4, paragraph 15, Lee is obligated to execute a deed conveying his\n\n• interest in the River Bend Farm to the Article IV Trust. (\"River Bend Property\").\n\n         118.     Six percent of the River Bend Property constitutes part of the recovery assigned to\n\n and now owned by Plaintiffs under the terms of the CFA.\n\n\n\n\n PLAINTIFFS' ORIGINAL PETITION - Page 1 7\n\f                                              CLAIMS\n\nBreach of Contract\n\n        119.    Plaintiffs incorporate Paragraphs 1 - 118, as if set forth fully here.\n\n        120.    There is avaUd, enforceable contract by and between TSC, SusanLee, Susan Gibson\n\nand the Article IV Trust to provide legal services under the terms of the Contingent Fee Agreement.\n\n        121.    In addition or in the alternative to the above allegations, the Article IV Trust later\n\nadopted and accepted the CFA when Susan Lee was acting as the trustee for the Article IV Trust.\n\n        122.    In addition or in the alternative to the above allegations, the Article IV Trust ratified\n\nthe CFA before and/or after the time that Susan Lee was acting as the trustee for the Article IV Tmst.\n\n        123.     More specifically, Susan Lee entered into the CFA on behalf of the Article IV Trust,\n\nwith and/or without authority to do so, and the Article IV Trust approved the CFA after acquiring\n\nfull knowledge of the terms and provisions of the CFA with the intention of giving validity to Susan\n\nLee's agreement to bind the Article IV Trust to the terms of the CFA.\n\n         124.    In addition or in the alternative, the Article IV Trust ratified and is now bound to\n\nhonor the CFA, because it received and accepted benefits generated from the performance of the\n\nCFA with full knowledge of TSC's assigned interest and contingent fee rights to monetary and other\n\nrecoveries obtained as a result of work performed by TSC under the terms ofthe CFA.\n\n         125.    Under the terms of the CFA, TSC is the owner of 6% of every form of consideration\n\nreceived and accepted in full, or alternatively, partial satisfaction of the Article IV Trust Judgment.\n\n         126.    Plaintiffs are the successors in interest of TSC and they are the proper parties now\n\nentitled to enforce the terms of the CFA.\n\n         127.    TSC fully and/or substantially performed, tendered performance or was excused from\n\ncontinued performance under the terms of the CFA.\n\n\n\n PLAINTIFFS'ORIGINAL PETITION - Page 1 8\n\f         128.    In accepting recoveries under the terms ofthe CFA without paying Plaintiffs their 6%\n\nassigned, cbntingent fee interest, the Article IV Trust has dishonored the terms ofthe CFA and is\n\nnow wrongfully withholding Plaintiffs' right to full use and enjoyment of property Plaintiffs own.\n\n         129.    More specifically, Plaintiffs seek an order directing the Receiver to turn over 6% of\n\nall cash sums accepted in payment of the Article IV Trust Judgment, including, but not necessarily\n\nlimited to, 6%ofthe January, 1997 Payment and the $8 Million Payment, totaling $648,972.81 plus\n\ninterest at the highest rate allowed by law from date of receipt of each such payment until delivery of\n\nthe wi'ongfuUy possessed funds.\n\n         130.

In the alternative, Plaintiffs seek the recovery of a monetary judgment against the\n\nArticle IV Trust for the damage suffered by reason of its breach of the CFA equal to 6% of the\n\nJanuary, 1997 Payment, the $8 Million Payment and the payments received on the $4 Million\n\nPromissory Note plus interest at the highest rate allowed by law from date of receipt of each payment\n\nuntil delivery of the wrongfully possessed funds..\n\n         132.    Additionally, Plaintiffs seek an order directing the Receiver to turn over 6%\n\n ownership of the $4 Million Note, or alternatively, a monetary judgment against the Article IV Trast\n\n for damages suffered by reason of the Article IV Tmst's breach of the CFA equal to 6% of the value\n\n ofthe$4MillionNote.\n\n          133.

Plaintiffs also seek and are entitled to recover all reasonable and necessary attomey's\n\nfees arising from work performed to prosecute this suit, including any and all appeals, in an amount\n\nto be determined at trial.\n\n         136.

Accordingly, we do not discuss this case.\n4          We address the AWn holding in further detail later in this opinion.\n5           In his response brief, appellee claims that the trial court \"determined that'cause' would exist to remove if the jury had found\n            gross negligence.\" Appellee then states that appellants did not complain below and do not complain on appeal that gross\n            negligence is not a legally valid basis for removal. Because the jury refused to find gross negligence, appellee reasons\n            the trial court properly declined to remove appellee as trustee. Appellee misrepresents the trial court's determination.\n            The trial court actually said he could find grounds for removal if there was a finding of e/Y/rer gross negligence or breach\n            of fiduciary duty and damages.\n6           The former statute has been rewritten upon codification to set out the grounds in an enumerated fashion; however, the\n            language of the statute remains the same. Compare Act of April 14,1993, 48th Leg., R.S., ch. 148, § 39, 1943 Tex. Gen.\n            Laws 232, 246 (repealed) wrth TEX. PROP.CODE ANN. § 113.082 (Vernon 1995).\n7           This holding seems to fly in the face of the plain language of the statute. The statute allows recovery of attomey's fees\n            if the executor defends the will in good faith and with just cause, whether or not he or she is successful in admitting the\n            will to probate. See TEX. PROB.CODE ANN. § 243 (Vernon Supp.2000). Although the recovery of fees is expressly not\n            tied to success in admitting the will to probate, It is tied to good faith defense. By holding that a finding of good faith was\n            inapplicable where the executor was successful in admitting the will to probate, the court ignored the statutory language\n            and tied recovery of fees to success in admitting the will.\n8           This is somewhat similar to the standard for official Immunity, which has been held to protect \"all but the plainly\n            incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\" Courson v.

As set forth throughout Texas case law (and more specifically Section 64.004 of\n\n        the Texas Civil Practice &, Remedies Code), the rules of equity generally govern all matters\n\n        regarding receiverships. See Harrington v. Schuble, 608.S,'W.2d 253 (Tex.

CFV. PRAC. &. REM. CODE §64,004.\n\n                   12.       Furthermore, Texas case law supports that a receiver obtain court approval prior\n\n        to compromising or scttlmg claims. See Knox v. Damascus Corp., 200 S.W,2d 656, 659-60\n\n        (Tex. Civ.

You are the sole judges of the credibility of the\nwitnesses and the weight to be given then testimony, but in matters of law you must be govemed by\nthe insnuctions in this charge. In discharging yom responsibility on this jury, you will observe all\nthe inshuctions which have been previously given you. I shall now give you additional instructions\nwhich you should carefully and snictly follow dming your deliberations.\n\n1.      Do not let bias, prejudice, or sympathy play any part in your deliberations.\n\n2.       In anivmg at your answers consider only the evidence uitroduced here under oath and such\nexhibits, if any, as have been inteoduced for your consideration under the rulings ofthe court, that\nis what you have seen and heard m this courtroom, together with the law as given you by the court.\nIn your deliberations you will not consider or discuss anything that is not represented by the evidence\nin this case.\n\n3.     Since every answer that is required by the charge is important, no juror should state or\nconsider that any required answer is not important.\n\n4.     You must not decide who you think should win, and then hy to answer the questions\naccordmgly. Simply answer the questions, and do not discuss or concem yourselves with the effect\nof your answers.\n\n 5.     You will not decide the answer to a question by lot or by drawing straws, or by any other\n method of chance. Do not rehim a quotient verdict. A quotient verdict means that the jurors agree\n to abide by the itssult to be reached by adding together each juror'sfiguresand dividing by the\n\n\n                                                    -1-\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFFS' ORIGINAL PETITION - Page 120\n\fnumber of jurors to get an average. Do not do any trading on your answers; that is, one juror should\nnot agree to answer a certain question one way if others will agree to answer another question\nanother way.\n\n6.        You may render your verdict upon the vote of ten or more members of the jury. The same\nten or more of you must agree upon all the answers made and to the entire verdict. You will not,\ntherefore, enter into an agreement to be bound by a majority or any other vote of less than 10 jurors.\nI f the verdict and all the answers therein are reached by unanimous agreement, the Presiding Juror\nshall sign the verdict for the entire jury. If any jmor disagrees as to any answer made by the verdict,\nthose jmors who agree to allfindingsshall each sign the verdict.\n\n         These instructions are given you because your conduct is subject to review the same as that\n of the witnesses, parties, attomeys, and the judge. If it should be found that you have disregarded\n any of these instructions, it will be jury misconduct and it may require another trial by another jury;\n then all of oirr time will have been wasted.\n\n       The presiding juror or any other who observes a violation ofthe court's instructions shall\n immediately warn the one who is violating the same and caution the juror not to do so again.\n\n        When words are used in this charge in a sense which variesfromthe meaning commonly\n understood, you are given a proper legal definition, which you are bound to accept m place of any\n other definition or any other meaning.\n\n         Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" to all questions unless otherwise mstructed,\n\n         A \"Yes\" answer must be based on a preponderance ofthe evidence, xmless that question\n states specifically that a different standard should be used. In answering a question based on a\n preponderance ofthe evidence, if you do notfindthat a preponderance ofthe evidence supports a\n \"Yes\" answer, then answer \"No.\"\n\n        The term \"preponderance of the evidence\" means the greater weight and degree of credible\n testimony or evidence introduced before you and admitted in this case.\n\n         In answering a question based on a preponderance ofthe evidence, a fact may be established\n by direct evidence or by circumstantial evidence or both.

The proposed transfer of Ronald Lee's interest in the River Bend Fami\n              Property is of no benefit to the Trust because it already owns his interest.\n\n\n\n\nDEFENDANT'S OBJECTIONS, OPPOSITION, AND RESPONSE TO\nAPPLICATION TO APPROVE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT                                                  PAGE 2\n\f        A.      The proposed settlement of the Judgment is grossly inadequate.\n\n        The proposed Settlement Agreement between Ronald Lee and Legacy allows Ronald Lee\n\n to satisfy the Judgment in full, apparently for consideration that includes an alleged payment of\n\n $8 million in 2015, and a promissory note in the amount of $4 million payable quarterly over a\n\nperiod of two years at a 4% interest rate. This amount is woefully inadequate, less than one-half\n\n of what is due under the Judgment.\n\n        Legacy's Application understates the amount of the Judgment against Ronald Lee by a\n\nsignificant amount. The Application simply references a judgment totaling approximately $3.9\n\nmillion \"plus prejudgment interest.\" The actual amount of the Judgment is in excess of $4.3\n\nmillion, and significant portions ofthe Judgment carry post-judgment interest at the rate of 10%\n\ncompounded annually back to October 1996, almost 20 years. When post-judgment interest is\n\ncalculated in accordance with the Fourteenth Court of Appeals' opinion, the total amount ofthe\n\nJudgment as of February 2016 exceeds $26 million.^ Yet, the proposed Settlement Agreement\n\ndischarges the Judgment and sells the Trust's $26 million asset in retum for only $8 million, plus\n\na $4 million promissory note payable over two years. And, the promissory note carries only 4%\n\ninterest, compared to the Judgmenf s rate of 10%.\n\n        Ronald Lee and Legacy have colluded to relieve him of his obligations to the Trust. Legacy\n\nasks the Court to find that the Settlement Agreement is in the best interest of the Trast. Yet, it\n\nallows Ronald Lee to discharge this judgment (unpaid for 20 years) for less than 50 cents on the\n\ndollar. It is not in the best interest of the Trust or its beneficiaries. Rather, it is only in Ronald\n\n\n\n\n     An approximate calculation ofthe Trust's Judgment against Ronald Lee with prejudgment and post-\njudgment interest in accordance with the Fourteenth Court of Appeals' opinion is attached hereto as\nExhibit A.\n\n\nDEFENDANT'S OBJEcnoNs, QpposraoN, AND RESPONSE TO\nAPPLICATION TO APPROVE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT                                                   PAGES\n\fLee's interest, providing a windfall to him in violation of Legacy's duties as Receiver. While\n\nLegacy has the authority to compromise and settle all debts owed to the Trust, it is also charged\n\nwith all duties of a trustee under the Trust.'- Legacy owes fiduciary duties to all beneficiaries of\n\nthe Trust to exercise good faith in protecting the assets of the Trust and discharging its duties as a\n\nprudent person would ordinarily exercise in the management of his or her own affairs. The\n\nagreement to allow Ronald Lee to satisfy the Judgment is in violation of Legacy's duties.\n\n       Based on the foregoing, Susan Lee requests that the Court deny Legacy's Applicafion to\n\nApprove the Settlement Agreement and deny Legacy authority to enter into the agreement as\n\npresented.\n\n       B.      Ronald Lee's transfer of the River Bend Farm Property\n               is of no benefit to the Trust.\n\n       Legacy's Settlement Agreement also calls for the settlement of issues related to Ronald\n\nLee's interest in property known as the River Bend Farm Property, consisting of approximately\n\n640 acres in Wharton County, Texas. Legacy's Application states that Ronald Lee acquired a 25%\n\ninterest in this property from the estate of his father and the Trust acquired a 50% interest under\n\nthe Bamhart Will. The agreement calls for Ronald Lee to deed his interest in the River Bend Farm\n\nProperty to Legacy. The problem here is that Ronald Lee has no interest in the River Bend Farm\n\nProperty. Legacy's Application fails to infonn the Court that Ronald Lee's interest in the River\n\nBend Farm Property was foreclosed upon for failure to pay taxes. Susan Lee as Trustee of the\n\nTmst later redeemed that interest. Therefore, the conveyance of Ronald Lee's interest in the River\n\nBend Farm Property is worthless to the Trust, because it already ovms his interest. Whatever\n\nconsideration is given to Ronald Lee for the value of his interest in the property for the transfer\n\n\n\n\n^    Order Removing Trusting and Appointing Receiver f 3.a, June 18,2015.\n\nDEFENDANT'S OBJECTIONS, OPPOSITION, AND RESPONSE TO\nAPPLICATION TO APPROVE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT                                                    PAGE 4\n\fshould be nullilied. hi this regard, the purported Settlement Agreement is not in the best ofthe\n\nTrust and Legacy's Application to Approve the Settlement Agreement in this regard should also\n\nbe denied.\n\n        WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Susan Lee respectfully request that the\n\nCourt: (1) decline to approve the terms ofthe Proposed Settlement Agreement; (2) find that the\n\nproposed settlement agreement is not in the best interest of the Trust; and (3) deny Legacy in its\n\ncapacity as receiver the authority to enter into the proposed settlement agreement on behalf of the\n\nTrust.

Defendant asserts that a duly-authorized Trustee for the Article IV Trust did not\n\n               sign the written fee agreement, and, as a result, no Trustee ofthe Article I V Trust\n\n               (nor the assets of the Article IV Trust) are bound by the terms and provisions of\n\n               the agreement.\n\n\n          b.   Defendant asserts the defense of res judicata;\n\n\n          c.   Defendant asserts the defense of claim preclusion;\n\n\n          d.   Defendant asserts the defense of issue preclusion;\n\n\n          e.   To the extent that Plaintiffs seek to recover a contingent fee from Susan Lee's or\n\n               Susan Gibson's beneficial interest in the Article I V Trust by virtue of the fee\n\n               agreement. Defendant asserts that such a recovery is barred by the spendthrift\n\n               clause which is a part of the Article IV Trust;\n\n\n          f.   Defendant asserts the defense of estoppel;\n\n\n          g.   Defendant asserts the defense of quasi-estoppel;\n\n\n          h.   Defendant asserts the defense of acceptance of benefits;\n\n\n          i.   Defendant asserts the defense of laches; and\n\n\n          j.   Defendant asserts the defense of limitations.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             3I P aa c\n0050812\n\f          k.   Defendant asserts that plaintiffs' claims to entitlement to attorneys' fees are\n\n               barred by Texas Government Code §82.065(a).\n\n\n                                      Plea I n Abatement\n\n          6.   Without waiving the foregoing general denial, verified denial, or defenses,\n\nDefendant moves to abate these proceedings pending a ruling from Harris Coimty Probate Court\n\nNumber Two (2) on Defendant's Motion to Transfer Lawsuit to Statutory Probate Court which\n\nDefendant previously filed with Harris County Probate Court Number Two (2) on May 13, 2016\n\nunder Cause Number 137,506-403.\n\n                                         Counterclaim\n\n          7.   Subject to the foregoing Motion to Transfer Venue, Defendant Legacy Trust\n\nCompany, N.A., in its capacity as Receiver for the Article IV Trust created by the Last Will and\n\nTestament of Katherine Pillot Lee Bamhart, Deceased appointed by the Probate Court No. 2 of\n\nHarris County asserts the following counterclaims against Plaintiffs Tom Thomas, Dan Sheehan,\n\nand Marc Culp.\n\n          8.   Defendants Tom Thomas, Dan Sheehan, and Marc Culp have asserted claims\n\nagainst Legacy for legal fees they claim are owed by the trustee of the Article IV Trust. Legacy\n\nis the court-appointed Receiver for the Article IV Trust, invested with all the power of the tmstee\n\nofthe Article IV Trast.\n\n          9.   The original trastee of the Article I V Trust was Ronald E. Lee, Jr. (hereinafter\n\nreferred to as \"Mr. Lee\"). Under the Last Will and Testament ofKatherine Pillot Lee Bamhart\n\n(hereinafter referred to as the \"Bamhart Will\"), in the event Mr. Lee failed to serve as trustee, the\n\nArticle IV Trast was to be managed by co-trustees (1) Susan Camille Lee and (2) Texas\n\nCommerce Bank, N.A. or any successor to that bank. In the event that Texas Commerce Bank,\n\n\n                                                                                            ' 4IPag   e\n0050812\n\fN.A. or its successors failed to serve, another financial institution with trust powers was required\n\nby the Barnhart Will to be appointed.\n\n          10.   Mr. Lee was removed as trustee of the Article IV Trust on February 8, 2002. The\n\nsuccessor to Texas Commerce Bank, N.A. at that time was JP Morgan Chase Bank. JP Morgan\n\nChase Bank declined to serve as co-trustee after Susan Camille Lee specifically requested that it\n\nnot serve with her as co-trustee. Susan Camille Lee never sought or obtained the appointment of\n\na substitute co-trustee as required by the Barnhart Will and Texas law.\n\n          11.   No agreement was ever signed by any trustee of the Article I V Trust with Tom\n\nThomas, Dan Sheehan or Marc Culp, or with the law firm of Thomas, Sheehan & Culp, L.L.P.,\n\nfor (1) the provision of legal services to the trustee of the Article I V Trust, (2) the payment of a\n\ncontingent fee for legal services to the trustee of the Article IV Trust or on behalf of the Article\n\nIV Trust, or (3) the payment of a debt for legal services of another person. Notwithstanding the\n\nlack of any such agreement, Messrs. Thomas, Sheehan and Culp have asserted claims against\n\nLegacy in its capacity as court-appointed Receiver of the Article IV Trust for a contingent fee\n\nbased on collections by Mr. Lee as a former trustee of the Article IV Trust, collections by\n\nLegacy as Receiver of the Article IV Trust, and asserted entitlement to collect a contingent fee\n\nbased on future collections by Legacy as Receiver of the Article I V Trust.\n\n          12.   Susan Camille Lee was not a co-tmstee of the Article IV Trust when she signed\n\nthe contingency fee agreement in her individual capacity in 1995. In fact, she would not become\n\neven a co-trustee for another seven years. When Susan Camille Lee eventually became a co-\n\ntrustee, she never sought or obtained appointment of a co-trustee as required under the Article IV\n\nTrust, a clear violation of the terms of the Trust and the intent of Katherine Pillot Lee Barnhart\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             5IP   a a e'\n0050812\n\fwhen she executed the Barnhart Will. Susan Camille Lee never had the power to bind the Article\n\nIV Trust to the contingency fee agreement.\n\n          13.       Legacy is placed at jeopardy based on these claims, and pursuant to T E X . CiV.\n\nPRAC. & R E M . CODE       §37.005 asks this Court to declare that, under the terms of the Barnhart\n\nWill, the Article IV Trust, and Texas law, the purported March 30, 1995 contingency fee\n\nagreement among Thomas, Sheehan & Culp, LLP, Susan Lee, and Susan Gibson does not today\n\nbind a lawfully appointed Trustee or Receiver of the Article I V Trust. Legacy seeks this relief to\n\nforeclose current and future claims by Plaintiffs against Legacy under the contingency fee\n\nagreement.\n\n          14.       Legacy further requests that this Court award reasonable and necessary attorney's\n\nfees to Legacy as would be equitable and just and therefore authorized by T E X . CiV.         PRAC. &\n\n\nR E M . CODE    §37.009.\n\n          15.       Legacy further requests that pursuant to   T E X A S PROPERTY CODE   §114.064, this\n\nCourt make such award of costs and attomey's fees to Legacy as may seem equitable and just.\n\n                                                  Prayer\n\n          WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Defendant and Counterclaim Plaintiff\n\nLegacy Trast Company, N.A., in its capacity as court-appointed Receiver of the Article I V Trust\n\nunder the Last Will and Testament of Katherine Pillot Lee Bamhart, respectfully requests that on\n\nfinal hearing, the Court grant the following relief:\n\n\n                •   A judgment from the Court that Plaintiffs take nothing by way of their lawsuit;\n\n                •   A judgment from the Court that costs be adjudged against Plaintiffs;\n\n                •   A n order that this matter is to be abated until such time as Harris County Statutory\n                    Probate Court Number Two (2) has ruled on Defendant's Motion to Transfer\n                    Proceeding to Statutory Probate Court;\n\n\n                                                                                                 6IPag e\n0050812\n\fA declaration that Legacy and any future Receiver or trustees of the Article IV\nTrust have no obligation to pay additional fees to Tom Thomas, Dan Sheehan,\nMarc Culp, or Thomas, Sheehan & Culp, LLP.;\n\nAn award from Tom Thomas, Dan Sheehan, and Marc Culp, jointly and severally\nof Legacy's reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with this matter;\nAnd\n\nSuch other and further relief as Legacy may show itself justly entitled to receive.\n\n\n                              Respectfully submitted,\n\n                              M A C I N T Y R E M C C U L L O ^ ^TANFIELJ\n                              & Y0DNG, LLP\n\n\n                                      W.
