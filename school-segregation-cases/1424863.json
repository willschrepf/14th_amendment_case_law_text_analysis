Here, Liubov\n\nSchmidt appeals the trial court's division of property and award of maintenance. Ms.\n\nSchmidt contends that the court erred by failing to characterize the increased value in Mr.\n\nSchmidt's lending enterprise as community property. Ms. Schmidt also contends that the\n\ncourt failed to consider the needs of the parties and the ability of the parties to pay. We\n\nconclude the trial court properly exercised its discretion, and we affinn its order.\n\fNo.30662-3-III\nIn re Marriage ofSchmidt\n\n\n                                         FACTS\n\n      Liubov Schmidt and Kenneth Schmidt began communicating with each other in\n\n2004 through an online Christian dating site. Ms. Schmidt lived in Russia and owned a\n\nsuccessful travel agency. Before owning her travel business, Ms. Schmidt operated a\n\nsunflower oil business and a sewing business. She earned two music degrees and one\n\nhealth education degree.\n\n       Mr. Schmidt lived in College Place, Washington. Mr. Schmidt was a retired civil\n\nengineer and government employee. He derived his income from social security, a\n\ngovernment pension, and from a private lending enterprise.\n\n      The couple's relationship developed romantically. In 2005, Ms. Schmidt\n\nimmigrated to the United States and the couple married. She sold her business and gave\n\nthe money to Mr. Schmidt. She donated her home to her church in Russia.\n\n      While married, Ms. Schmidt worked part time as a violin teacher and as a member\n\nof the Walla Walla Symphony. She earned as much as $18,000 per year. Ms. Schmidt\n\nused the money to fund her son's education. Mr. Schmidt continued to earn an income\n\nfrom his investment enterprise.\n\n      The couple built a new house funded with Mr. Schmidt's separate property. Ms.\n\nSchmidt signed a quit claim deed in which she declared no interest in the property.\n\n\n                                            2\n\n\fNo. 30662-3-111\nIn re Marriage ofSchmidt\n\n\n       Ms. Schmidt filed for divorce in May 2010. The couple was married for about\n\nfour and one-half years. The parties proceeded to trial to determine property division and\n\nmaintenance.\n\n       Ms. Schmidt alleged that Mr. Schmidt treated her poorly during the marriage. She\n\nclaimed that he emotionally abused her and kept her on a very limited budget. She\n\nclaimed that the stress of the marriage caused her to have difficulty sleeping, migraines,\n\nand joint pain, which limited her ability to work. She was diagnosed with fibromyalgia,\n\nand was treated with medication and therapy.\n\n       A psychiatric evaluation conducted by Dr. Ronald Page showed that Ms. Schmidt\n\ndemonstrated symptoms of pain, but that doctors could not identify the source of the pain.\n\nDr. Page suggested that the pain was psychosomatic and caused by the stress of the\n\ndissolution proceedings. Dr. Page determined that Ms; Schmidt would be able to return\n\nto her normal level of functioning, including employment, within a short time after the\n\nstress ended. Dr. Page specifically found that Ms. Schmidt was a creative, self-motivated,\n\nand skilled person who had the ability to find gainful employment, despite the challenges\n\nof being an immigrant.\n\n       As for the house, Ms. Schmidt contended that she was led to believe that she was\n\nan owner of the house. It was not until later that she realized the documents she signed\n\n\n                                             3\n\n\fNo.30662-3-III\nIn re Marriage ofSchmidt\n\n\nrelinquished her interest in the home. In contrast, the escrow manager who closed the\n\nloan testified that she would have explained to Ms. Schmidt that her husband was buying\n\nthe property by himself and that she would not be on the title.\n\n       Ms. Schmidt contended that the community had an interest in Mr. Schmidt's\n\nlending enterprise. She maintained that Mr. Schmidt contributed community labor to the\n\nenterprise, thus giving the community an interest in the increased value of the enterprise.\n\nAs proof of Mr. Schmidt's labor, Ms. Schmidt submitted Mr. Schmidt's tax returns in\n\nwhich he indentified his occupation as an investor and declared business expenses,\n\nincluding 11,000 miles for business travel. Mr. Schmidt testified that he generated about\n\n$183,000 in interest from loans during the marriage.\n\n       Mr. Schmidt contended that he devoted very little time to the lending enterprise.\n\nHe presented testimony of Edward Anderson, a real estate broker, who maintained that he\n\noriginated many of Mr. Schmidt's loans. He testified that he would evaluate the loans\n\nand present the loan opportunity to Mr. Schmidt. Mr. Schmidt would review the\n\npaperwork and generally had one day to accept the loan and respond to Mr. Anderson.\n\nAfter the loan was complete, Mr. Schmidt monitored the payments. In total, Mr.\n\nAnderson testified that Mr. Schmidt spent approximately one or two hours on each loan.\n\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\n\fNo.30662-3-III\nIn re Marriage ofSchmidt\n\n\n       For liabilities, Ms. Schmidt presented evidence of dental complications she\n\nsuffered through the marriage. Ms. Schmidt's dentist identified approximately $11,000 in\n\ndental work that Ms. Schmidt was likely to require, in addition to the $1,853 already\n\nowed. Previously, Ms. Schmidt had several root canals and implants, which were paid for\n\nby Mr. Schmidt.\n\n       The court issued a memorandum opinion, findings of fact and a decree of\n\ndissolution. The court found that there was little personal property to divide. The court\n\nawarded to Ms. Schmidt the household furnishings and her few items of separate\n\nproperty. The court awarded to Mr. Schmidt his office equipment and papers, the\n\ncontents of the garage, electronic equipment and furniture in the master bedroom, and a\n\nfew other items.\n\n       The court awarded the house to Mr. Schmidt as his separate property. The court\n\nfound that Mr. Schmidt used his separate funds to build the home and that Ms. Schmidt\n\ndid not contribute money or significant labor into the home. The court also found the\n\nclosing agent's testimony credible that Ms. Schmidt knowingly signed away her interest\n\nin the property via a quit claim deed.\n\n       As for Mr. Schmidt's investment enterprise, the court detennined that most of the\n\ncontracts were in place before marriage, that most of the contracts were facilitated\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\n\fNo.30662-3-III\nIn re Marriage ofSchmidt\n\n\nthrough Mr. Anderson, that all ofthe contracts were the product of work, oversight,\n\nmonitoring and investment resources of Mr. Schmidt, and that Ms. Schmidt did not\n\ncontribute to the business. Regarding Mr. Anderson's business relationship with Mr.\n\nSchmidt, the court found Mr. Anderson's testimony credible.\n\n         The court determined that Mr. Schmidt's lending enterprise was his separate\n\nproperty. The court found that Mr. Schmidt devoted a minimal or insubstantial amount of\n\ntime in running his business. The court also considered the nature of the business\n\ncontracts and profits as to whether they are separate, community, or mixed. The court\n\nfound that two to four contracts that were generated by Mr. Schmidt could be considered\n\ncommunity property, but that these loans did not generate a profit and had no community\n\nvalue.\n\n         Despite the failure to find any significant community property, the court awarded\n\nMs. Schmidt $25,000 cash for her share of community property.\n\n         In determining maintenance, the trial court considered all of the factors listed in\n\nRCW 26.09.090. The court found that Ms. Schmidt had some health issues that hindered\n\nher ability to work in certain fields, but noted that Ms. Schmidt should be able to return to\n\nemployment within 18 months and had the ability to earn approximately $18,000 per year\n\nby teaching music lessons and working for the symphony. While the court recognized\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\n\fNo.30662-3-III\nIn re Marriage ofSchmidt\n\n\nthat Ms. Schmidt was 50 years old, the court found that she had the skills and training\n\nneeded to return to gainful employment and that additional schooling or training was not\n\nneeded.\n\n       The trial court discredited Ms. Schmidt's testimony that she sutfered emotional\n\ndomestic violence and attributed most of the stress in the marriage to the parties' cultural\n\nand language difficulties. The court found Dr. Page's report evaluation and conclusions\n\nto be credible.\n\n       The trial court acknowledged that since the separation, Mr. Schmidt paid all of Ms.\n\nSchmidt's daily living expenses, dental and medical expenses, and automobile and\n\nhousing expenses. This amount totaled $55,000. The court awarded Ms. Schmidt $2,000\n\nper month in maintenance for a 24-month period. The court ordered Ms. Schmidt to pay\n\nher outstanding dental bills.\n\n       In addition to the $25,000 property award and the $2,000 monthly maintenance\n\naward, the trial court also ordered Mr. Schmidt to pay $10,000 toward Ms. Schmidt's\n\nlegal fees. The court concluded that Mr. Schmidt did not have to pay for all of Ms.\n\nSchmidt's legal fees because Ms. Schmidt unnecessarily protracted the proceeding based\n\non largely irrelevant, unsupported allegations.\n\n       Ms. Schmidt appeals the court's division of property and award of maintenance.\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\n\fNo. 30662-3-III\nIn re Marriage 0/ Schmidt\n\n\n                                        ANALYSIS\n\n       Property Characterization. In a dissolution action, the court must make a \"just\n\nand equitable\" distribution of the marital property. RCW 26.09.080. However, before\n\nconsidering distribution, the court must characterize the marital property as either\n\nseparate or community. In re Marriage a/Griswold, 112 Wn. App. 333, 339,48 P.3d\n\n1018 (2002). A court's characterization of property as either separate or community is a\n\nquestion of law subject to de novo review. In re Marriage o/Skarbek, 100 Wn. App. 444,\n\n447,997 P.2d 447 (2000). If the court makes factual findings regarding characterization,\n\nthe findings may be reversed only if they are not supported by substantial evidence.\n\nGriswold, 112 Wn. App. at 339. \"Substantial evidence exists if the record contains\n\nevidence of sufficient quantity to persuade a fair-minded, rational person of the truth of\n\nthe declared premise.\" Bering v. SHARE, 106 Wn.2d 212,220, 721 P.2d 918 (1986).\n\n       Ms. Schmidt contends that the trial court erred in failing to characterize the\n\nincreased value in Mr. Schmidt's lending enterprise as community property. The issue\n\nhere is whether the time Mr. Schmidt contributed to his lending enterprise created a\n\ncommunity interest in the increased value in the enterprise.\n\n       All of the parties' property, both community and separate, is before the court for\n\ndistribution. Friedlander v. Friedlander, 80 Wn.2d 293,305,494 P.2d 208 (1972).\n\n\n                                             8\n\n\fNo.30662-3-III\nIn re Marriage ofSchmidt\n\n\n       Assets acquired during a marriage are presumed to be community property. In re\n\nMarriage ofShort, 125 Wn.2d 865,870, 890 P.2d 12 (1995). This presumption may be\n\nrebutted by showing the assets were acquired as separate property. Id.\n\n       Property that was separate when brought into the marriage is presumed to maintain\n\nits character, unless rebutted by direct and positive evidence to the contrary. In re\n\nMarriage ofElam, 97 Wn.2d 811,814,650 P.2d 213 (1982) (quoting Hamlin v. Merlino,\n\n44 Wn.2d 851,857-58,272 P.2d 125 (1954)). Similarly, any increase in the value to\n\nseparate property is presumed to be separate property, unless the spouse claiming the\n\ncommunity property interest rebuts the presumption by producing direct and positive\n\nevidence that the increase is attributable to community funds or labors. Id. at 816-17.\n\n       While the community is entitled to the increase of value in separate property due to\n\nthe labor of each member performed during the relationship, the community is not entitled\n\nto the natural increase of the value of separate property. In re Marriage ofLindemann, 92\n\nWn. App. 64, 69-70, 960 P.2d 966 (1998). \"The spouse with the separate ownership\n\ninterest may defend against the other spouse's claim of an equitable interest by showing\n\nthat the increase in value is attributable not to community contributions of labor or funds,\n\nbut rather to rents, issues and profits or other qualities inherent in the business.\" Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\n\fNo.30662-3-II1\nIn re Marriage ofSchmidt\n\n\n       Here, any increase of the value of the enterprise is not community property. Mr.\n\nSchmidt's labor did not increase the value of Mr. Schmidt's separate lending enterprise.\n\nThe trial court specifically addressed this issue, finding that the time Mr. Schmidt\n\ncontributed to his business interest to be minimal or insubstantiaL This finding is\n\nsupported by substantial evidence. Mr. Schmidt stated that Mr. Anderson primarily\n\nhandled his business. Mr. Anderson also testified to his loan development procedures,\n\nand the amount of contact that he had with Mr. Schmidt in the process. He testified that it\n\ntook a total of about one to two hours from when he first contacted Mr. Schmidt with a\n\nloan proposal to when he closed the loan. Mr. Anderson further testified that once the\n\nloan was closed, Mr. Schmidt's management of the account was simply to monitor\n\npayments. The trial court's finding regarding Mr. Schmidt's contribution oflabor is\n\nsupported by substantial evidence.\n\n       Contrary to the court's finding, Ms. Schmidt produced evidence that Mr. Schmidt\n\nclaimed business expenses from the enterprise and classified himself as an investor.\n\nHowever, the trial court did not give weight to this evidence and found Mr. Anderson's\n\ntestimony credible. Based on the trial court's findings, Mr. Schmidt's minimal amount of\n\nlabor did not increase the value of his separate lending enterprise. Therefore, any\n\nincrease of the value of the enterprise is not community property.\n\n\n                                             10 \n\n\fNo. 30662-3-II1\nIn re Marriage ofSchmidt\n\n\n       In her reply brief, Ms. Schmidt appears to argue that the loans from the lending\n\nenterprise should be community property because Mr. Schmidt comingled the business\n\nloans with the household funds, yet failed to trace the loans to his separate property. She\n\nbrings in new case law to establish that when separate property funds are deposited into a\n\njoint checking account, the separate property presumably becomes community property,\n\nunless the owner exhaustively presents documentation to trace the property to the separate\n\nsource. Skarbek, 100 Wn. App. at 449-50.\n\n       We consider this to be a new argument raised on reply. While Ms. Schmidt\n\nmentions the failure to segregate business and household funds in her opening brief, she\n\ndoes so only in the context of showing that Mr. Schmidt did not specifically designate any\n\nportion of the lending enterprise income to the marital community to compensate for Mr.\n\nSchmidt's community labor, thus comingling the separate and community property.\n\nBecause the particular issue raised in Skarbek was not addressed in Ms. Schmidt's\n\nopening brief, Mr. Schmidt did not have the opportunity to respond. Thus, we decline to\n\naddress this issue on appeal.\n\n       The trial court did not err by failing to characterize the increased value in Mr.\n\nSchmidt's lending enterprise as community property.\n\n\n\n\n                                             11 \n\n\fNo.30662-3-III\nIn re Marriage ofSchmidt\n\n\n       Property Division. The trial court has broad discretion in distributing the marital\n\nproperty and its decision will be reversed only when discretion was exercised on\n\nuntenable grounds or for untenable reasons. In re Marriage ofMuhammad, 153 Wn.2d\n\n795, 803, 108 P.3d 779 (2005) (quoting In re Marriage ofLittlefield, 133 Wn.2d 39, 46­\n\n47, 940 P .2d 1362 (1997)). This deferential standard of review exists because the trial\n\ncourt is \"in the best position to assess the assets and liabilities of the parties\" in order to\n\ndetermine what constitutes an equitable outcome. In re Marriage ofBrewer, 137 Wn.2d\n\n756, 769, 976 P.2d 102 (1999).\n\n       RCW 26.09.080 instructs a trial court to make a \"just and equitable\" distribution of\n\nthe parties' property. The statute's nonexclusive list of factors to be considered is:\n\n(1) the nature and extent of the community property; (2) the nature and extent of the\n\nseparate property; (3) the duration of the marriage; and (4) the economic circumstances of\n\nthe parties. RCW 26.09.080.\n\n       A just and equitable division by a trial court \"does not require mathematical\n\nprecision, but rather fairness, based upon a consideration of all the circumstances of the\n\nmarriage, both past and present, and an evaluation of the future needs of parties.\" In re\n\nMarriage ofCrosetto, 82 Wn. App. 545, 556, 918 P.2d 954 (1996).\n\n\n\n\n                                               12 \n\n\fNo.30662-3-II1\nIn re Marriage ofSchmidt\n\n\n      Here, the trial court's award to Ms. Schmidt of$25,000 and the miscellaneous\n\nitems is not an abuse of discretion. Ms. Schmidt did not have a large property interest in\n\nthe four and one-half year marriage. Ms. Schmidt's community property award was\n\nappropriate based on the court's finding that there was very little community property to\n\ndistribute. Also, the court found Ms. Schmidt's separate property to be minimal.\n\n      Admittedly, the record shows that Mr. Schmidt's economic circumstance was\n\nconsiderably better than Ms. Schmidt's. However, this does not automatically lead to the\n\nconclusion that Ms. Schmidt was owed a larger award. The court identified Mr.\n\nSchmidt's separate property primarily as the house and the lending enterprise, and states\n\nthat Ms. Schmidt did not contribute money or labor to the construction of the home or the\n\noperation of the business. Furthermore, the court took into consideration the fact that Mr.\n\nSchmidt partially compensated Ms. Schmidt between separation and trial by paying\n\n$55,000 in temporary maintenance, medical and dental bills, and other miscellaneous\n\nexpenses.\n\n      The court also recognized Ms. Schmidt's unique situation. The court found that\n\nMs. Schmidt was a 50-year-old immigrant, who came to the United States to marry Mr.\n\nSchmidt, who had very little separate property, and who earned a moderate annual income\n\nof approximately $18,000. The court also found that Ms. Schmidt had some health issues\n\n\n                                            13 \n\n\fNo. 30662-3-111\nIn re Marriage ofSchmidt\n\n\nthat hindered her ability to work in certain fields. In this respect, leaving Ms. Schmidt\n\nwith no assets would not be ajust and equitable distribution of the property. Even though\n\nMs. Schmidt contributed few assets to the community, the trial court had an obligation to\n\nconsider the needs of Ms. Schmidt. The trial court acted appropriately by awarding Ms.\n\nSchmidt $25,000.\n\n       Thus, the trial court's award to Ms. Schmidt did not constitute an abuse of\n\ndiscretion considering the lack of community property, the separate nature ofMr.\n\nSchmidt's income, and the payments made after the parties were separated. Awarding\n\nMs. Schmidt $25,000 in cash and miscellaneous property was a just and equitable\n\ndistribution.\n\n       Maintenance. The trial court's decision on an award of maintenance is reviewed\n\nfor an abuse of discretion. In re Marriage ofZahm, 138 Wn.2d 213,226-27,978 P.2d\n\n498 (1999). An abuse of discretion occurs when the court bases its decision on untenable\n\ngrounds or for untenable reasons. In re Marriage ofFoley, 84 Wn. App. 839, 845, 930\n\nP.2d 929 (1997). The court has wide discretion in deciding the amount and term of\n\nmaintenance, with the only limitation being that the award is just in light of all relevant\n\nfactors. In re Marriage a/Luckey, 73 Wn. App.201, 209,868 P.2d 189 (1994). \"An\n\n\n\n\n                                             14 \n\n\fNo. 30662-3-111\nIn re Marriage o/Schmidt\n\n\naward of maintenance that is not based upon a fair consideration of the statutory factors\n\nconstitutes an abuse of discretion.\" Crosetto, 82 Wn. App. at 558.\n\n       RCW 26.09.090 controls the awarding of maintenance. The court must consider\n\n(1) the post-dissolution financial resources of the parties; (2) their abilities to\n\nindependently meet their needs; (3) the time necessary for the party seeking maintenance\n\nto find employment; (4) duration of the marriage; (5) the standard of living during the\n\nmarriage; (6) the age, physical, and emotional condition, and financial obligations of the\n\nspouse seeking maintenance; and (7) the ability of the spouse from whom maintenance is\n\nsought to meet his needs and financial obligations. RCW 26.09.090(a)-(t).\n\n       The maintenance award adequately provided compensation to Ms. Schmidt. The\n\ncourt considered the factors listed in RCW 26.09.090(a) through (t). The court noted that\n\nMs. Schmidt had a modest amount of separate property which essentially had no value.\n\nHowever, the court found that Ms. Schmidt would receive a $25,000 cash award for her\n\nshare of community property. The court also found that Ms. Schmidt would be able to\n\nreturn to work in music education or travel with no additional training, and had the ability\n\nto meet at least 50 percent of her monthly expenses.\n\n       The court stated that the parties were married for four and one-half years and\n\nenjoyed a middle class lifestyle. Mr. Schmidt paid all of her living expenses and bills\n\n\n\n                                               15 \n\n\fNo. 30662-3-III\nIn re Marriage ofSchmidt\n\n\nsince separation, making the remaining dental bill the only financial obligation owed by\n\nMs. Schmidt. The court found that Mr. Schmidt had the ability to pay reasonable\n\nmaintenance and his own financial obligations.\n\n       Dr. Page's report provides support for the trial court's findings. Dr. Page\n\nconcluded that Ms. Schmidt \"is very likely to rebound in short order to levels of greater\n\ncomfort and productivity, once she is situationally beyond the process of contested\n\ndivorce.\" Clerk's Papers at 120. Furthermore, Ms. Schmidt has demonstrated her ability\n\nto use her music training as a means for income by teaching lessons during the marriage.\n\n       The court's award of $2,000 per month for 24 months allowed Ms. Schmidt the\n\ntime she needed to seek out a career in the United States and maintain her middle class\n\nlifestyle. The trial court did not abuse its considerable discretion in its award of\n\nmaintenance for Ms. Schmidt, considering Ms. Schmidt's potential for employment and\n\npotential income, her limited liabilities, and the relatively short duration of the marriage.\n\n       The trial court's property division and award of maintenance did not constitute an\n\nabuse of discretion.\n\n       Attorney Fees. Mr. Schmidt requests attorney fees pursuant to RAP 18.l(b). Mr.\n\nSchmidt fails to cite to legal authority that would allow this court to make such an award\n\non appeal.\n\n\n                                              16 \n\n\fNo.30662-3-III\nIn re Marriage ofSchmidt\n\n\n       In any case, Mr. Schmidt's request fails. To award attorney fees on an appeal ofa\n\ndissolution proceeding, the court examines the merits of the appeal and the financial\n\nresources of the parties. In re Marriage ofMansour, 126 Wn. App. 1, 17, 106 P.3d 768\n\n(2004 ) (quoting In re Marriage ofGriffin, 114 Wn.2d 772, 779, 791 P .2d 519 (1990».\n\nMs. Schmidt brought forth worthwhile issues on appeal. Furthermore, Ms. Schmidt lacks\n\nthe financial resources to pay Mr. Schmidt's attorney fees. Mr. Schmidt's request is\n\ndenied.\n\n       We affirm the trial court's order.\n\n       A majority of the panel has determined this opinion will not be printed in the\n\nWashington Appellate Reports, but it will be filed for public record pursuant to\n\nRCW 2.06.040.\n                                            ~/rY.\n                                            Kulik, J.\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\nBrown, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                              17 \n\n\f",

We\n\nconclude the trial court properly exercised its discretion, and we affinn its order.\n\fNo.30662-3-III\nIn re Marriage ofSchmidt\n\n\n                                         FACTS\n\n      Liubov Schmidt and Kenneth Schmidt began communicating with each other in\n\n2004 through an online Christian dating site. Ms. Schmidt lived in Russia and owned a\n\nsuccessful travel agency. Before owning her travel business, Ms. Schmidt operated a\n\nsunflower oil business and a sewing business. She earned two music degrees and one\n\nhealth education degree.\n\n       Mr. Schmidt lived in College Place, Washington. Mr. Schmidt was a retired civil\n\nengineer and government employee. He derived his income from social security, a\n\ngovernment pension, and from a private lending enterprise.\n\n      The couple's relationship developed romantically. In 2005, Ms. Schmidt\n\nimmigrated to the United States and the couple married. She sold her business and gave\n\nthe money to Mr. Schmidt. She donated her home to her church in Russia.\n\n      While married, Ms. Schmidt worked part time as a violin teacher and as a member\n\nof the Walla Walla Symphony. She earned as much as $18,000 per year. Ms. Schmidt\n\nused the money to fund her son's education. Mr. Schmidt continued to earn an income\n\nfrom his investment enterprise.\n\n      The couple built a new house funded with Mr. Schmidt's separate property. Ms.\n\nSchmidt signed a quit claim deed in which she declared no interest in the property.\n\n\n                                            2\n\n\fNo. 30662-3-111\nIn re Marriage ofSchmidt\n\n\n       Ms. Schmidt filed for divorce in May 2010. The couple was married for about\n\nfour and one-half years. The parties proceeded to trial to determine property division and\n\nmaintenance.\n\n       Ms. Schmidt alleged that Mr. Schmidt treated her poorly during the marriage. She\n\nclaimed that he emotionally abused her and kept her on a very limited budget. She\n\nclaimed that the stress of the marriage caused her to have difficulty sleeping, migraines,\n\nand joint pain, which limited her ability to work. She was diagnosed with fibromyalgia,\n\nand was treated with medication and therapy.\n\n       A psychiatric evaluation conducted by Dr. Ronald Page showed that Ms. Schmidt\n\ndemonstrated symptoms of pain, but that doctors could not identify the source of the pain.\n\nDr. Page suggested that the pain was psychosomatic and caused by the stress of the\n\ndissolution proceedings. Dr. Page determined that Ms; Schmidt would be able to return\n\nto her normal level of functioning, including employment, within a short time after the\n\nstress ended. Dr. Page specifically found that Ms. Schmidt was a creative, self-motivated,\n\nand skilled person who had the ability to find gainful employment, despite the challenges\n\nof being an immigrant.\n\n       As for the house, Ms. Schmidt contended that she was led to believe that she was\n\nan owner of the house. It was not until later that she realized the documents she signed\n\n\n                                             3\n\n\fNo.30662-3-III\nIn re Marriage ofSchmidt\n\n\nrelinquished her interest in the home. In contrast, the escrow manager who closed the\n\nloan testified that she would have explained to Ms. Schmidt that her husband was buying\n\nthe property by himself and that she would not be on the title.\n\n       Ms. Schmidt contended that the community had an interest in Mr. Schmidt's\n\nlending enterprise. She maintained that Mr. Schmidt contributed community labor to the\n\nenterprise, thus giving the community an interest in the increased value of the enterprise.\n\nAs proof of Mr. Schmidt's labor, Ms. Schmidt submitted Mr. Schmidt's tax returns in\n\nwhich he indentified his occupation as an investor and declared business expenses,\n\nincluding 11,000 miles for business travel. Mr. Schmidt testified that he generated about\n\n$183,000 in interest from loans during the marriage.\n\n       Mr. Schmidt contended that he devoted very little time to the lending enterprise.\n\nHe presented testimony of Edward Anderson, a real estate broker, who maintained that he\n\noriginated many of Mr. Schmidt's loans. He testified that he would evaluate the loans\n\nand present the loan opportunity to Mr. Schmidt. Mr. Schmidt would review the\n\npaperwork and generally had one day to accept the loan and respond to Mr. Anderson.\n\nAfter the loan was complete, Mr. Schmidt monitored the payments. In total, Mr.\n\nAnderson testified that Mr. Schmidt spent approximately one or two hours on each loan.\n\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\n\fNo.30662-3-III\nIn re Marriage ofSchmidt\n\n\n       For liabilities, Ms. Schmidt presented evidence of dental complications she\n\nsuffered through the marriage. Ms. Schmidt's dentist identified approximately $11,000 in\n\ndental work that Ms. Schmidt was likely to require, in addition to the $1,853 already\n\nowed. Previously, Ms. Schmidt had several root canals and implants, which were paid for\n\nby Mr. Schmidt.\n\n       The court issued a memorandum opinion, findings of fact and a decree of\n\ndissolution. The court found that there was little personal property to divide. The court\n\nawarded to Ms. Schmidt the household furnishings and her few items of separate\n\nproperty. The court awarded to Mr. Schmidt his office equipment and papers, the\n\ncontents of the garage, electronic equipment and furniture in the master bedroom, and a\n\nfew other items.\n\n       The court awarded the house to Mr. Schmidt as his separate property. The court\n\nfound that Mr. Schmidt used his separate funds to build the home and that Ms. Schmidt\n\ndid not contribute money or significant labor into the home. The court also found the\n\nclosing agent's testimony credible that Ms. Schmidt knowingly signed away her interest\n\nin the property via a quit claim deed.\n\n       As for Mr. Schmidt's investment enterprise, the court detennined that most of the\n\ncontracts were in place before marriage, that most of the contracts were facilitated\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\n\fNo.30662-3-III\nIn re Marriage ofSchmidt\n\n\nthrough Mr. Anderson, that all ofthe contracts were the product of work, oversight,\n\nmonitoring and investment resources of Mr. Schmidt, and that Ms. Schmidt did not\n\ncontribute to the business. Regarding Mr. Anderson's business relationship with Mr.\n\nSchmidt, the court found Mr. Anderson's testimony credible.\n\n         The court determined that Mr. Schmidt's lending enterprise was his separate\n\nproperty. The court found that Mr. Schmidt devoted a minimal or insubstantial amount of\n\ntime in running his business. The court also considered the nature of the business\n\ncontracts and profits as to whether they are separate, community, or mixed. The court\n\nfound that two to four contracts that were generated by Mr. Schmidt could be considered\n\ncommunity property, but that these loans did not generate a profit and had no community\n\nvalue.\n\n         Despite the failure to find any significant community property, the court awarded\n\nMs. Schmidt $25,000 cash for her share of community property.\n\n         In determining maintenance, the trial court considered all of the factors listed in\n\nRCW 26.09.090. The court found that Ms. Schmidt had some health issues that hindered\n\nher ability to work in certain fields, but noted that Ms. Schmidt should be able to return to\n\nemployment within 18 months and had the ability to earn approximately $18,000 per year\n\nby teaching music lessons and working for the symphony. While the court recognized\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\n\fNo.30662-3-III\nIn re Marriage ofSchmidt\n\n\nthat Ms. Schmidt was 50 years old, the court found that she had the skills and training\n\nneeded to return to gainful employment and that additional schooling or training was not\n\nneeded.\n\n       The trial court discredited Ms. Schmidt's testimony that she sutfered emotional\n\ndomestic violence and attributed most of the stress in the marriage to the parties' cultural\n\nand language difficulties. The court found Dr. Page's report evaluation and conclusions\n\nto be credible.\n\n       The trial court acknowledged that since the separation, Mr. Schmidt paid all of Ms.\n\nSchmidt's daily living expenses, dental and medical expenses, and automobile and\n\nhousing expenses. This amount totaled $55,000. The court awarded Ms. Schmidt $2,000\n\nper month in maintenance for a 24-month period. The court ordered Ms. Schmidt to pay\n\nher outstanding dental bills.\n\n       In addition to the $25,000 property award and the $2,000 monthly maintenance\n\naward, the trial court also ordered Mr. Schmidt to pay $10,000 toward Ms. Schmidt's\n\nlegal fees. The court concluded that Mr. Schmidt did not have to pay for all of Ms.\n\nSchmidt's legal fees because Ms. Schmidt unnecessarily protracted the proceeding based\n\non largely irrelevant, unsupported allegations.\n\n       Ms. Schmidt appeals the court's division of property and award of maintenance.\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\n\fNo. 30662-3-III\nIn re Marriage 0/ Schmidt\n\n\n                                        ANALYSIS\n\n       Property Characterization. In a dissolution action, the court must make a \"just\n\nand equitable\" distribution of the marital property. RCW 26.09.080. However, before\n\nconsidering distribution, the court must characterize the marital property as either\n\nseparate or community. In re Marriage a/Griswold, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">333</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 339,48 P.3d\n\n1018 (2002).

If the court makes factual findings regarding characterization,\n\nthe findings may be reversed only if they are not supported by substantial evidence.\n\nGriswold, 112 Wn. App. at 339. \"Substantial evidence exists if the record contains\n\nevidence of sufficient quantity to persuade a fair-minded, rational person of the truth of\n\nthe declared premise.\" Bering v.

The issue\n\nhere is whether the time Mr. Schmidt contributed to his lending enterprise created a\n\ncommunity interest in the increased value in the enterprise.\n\n       All of the parties' property, both community and separate, is before the court for\n\ndistribution. Friedlander v. Friedlander, 80 Wn.2d 293,305,494 P.2d 208 (1972).\n\n\n                                             8\n\n\fNo.30662-3-III\nIn re Marriage ofSchmidt\n\n\n       Assets acquired during a marriage are presumed to be community property. In re\n\nMarriage ofShort, 125 Wn.2d 865,870, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2617598\"><a href=\"/opinion/2617598/in-re-marriage-of-short/\"><span class=\"volume\">890</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995). This presumption may be\n\nrebutted by showing the assets were acquired as separate property. Id.\n\n       Property that was separate when brought into the marriage is presumed to maintain\n\nits character, unless rebutted by direct and positive evidence to the contrary. In re\n\nMarriage ofElam, 97 Wn.2d 811,814,650 P.2d 213 (1982) (quoting Hamlin v. Merlino,\n\n44 Wn.2d 851,857-58,272 P.2d 125 (1954)). Similarly, any increase in the value to\n\nseparate property is presumed to be separate property, unless the spouse claiming the\n\ncommunity property interest rebuts the presumption by producing direct and positive\n\nevidence that the increase is attributable to community funds or labors. Id. at 816-17.\n\n       While the community is entitled to the increase of value in separate property due to\n\nthe labor of each member performed during the relationship, the community is not entitled\n\nto the natural increase of the value of separate property.

Mr.\n\nSchmidt's labor did not increase the value of Mr. Schmidt's separate lending enterprise.\n\nThe trial court specifically addressed this issue, finding that the time Mr. Schmidt\n\ncontributed to his business interest to be minimal or insubstantiaL This finding is\n\nsupported by substantial evidence. Mr. Schmidt stated that Mr. Anderson primarily\n\nhandled his business. Mr. Anderson also testified to his loan development procedures,\n\nand the amount of contact that he had with Mr. Schmidt in the process. He testified that it\n\ntook a total of about one to two hours from when he first contacted Mr. Schmidt with a\n\nloan proposal to when he closed the loan. Mr. Anderson further testified that once the\n\nloan was closed, Mr. Schmidt's management of the account was simply to monitor\n\npayments. The trial court's finding regarding Mr. Schmidt's contribution oflabor is\n\nsupported by substantial evidence.\n\n       Contrary to the court's finding, Ms. Schmidt produced evidence that Mr. Schmidt\n\nclaimed business expenses from the enterprise and classified himself as an investor.\n\nHowever, the trial court did not give weight to this evidence and found Mr. Anderson's\n\ntestimony credible. Based on the trial court's findings, Mr. Schmidt's minimal amount of\n\nlabor did not increase the value of his separate lending enterprise. Therefore, any\n\nincrease of the value of the enterprise is not community property.\n\n\n                                             10 \n\n\fNo. 30662-3-II1\nIn re Marriage ofSchmidt\n\n\n       In her reply brief, Ms. Schmidt appears to argue that the loans from the lending\n\nenterprise should be community property because Mr. Schmidt comingled the business\n\nloans with the household funds, yet failed to trace the loans to his separate property. She\n\nbrings in new case law to establish that when separate property funds are deposited into a\n\njoint checking account, the separate property presumably becomes community property,\n\nunless the owner exhaustively presents documentation to trace the property to the separate\n\nsource. Skarbek, 100 Wn. App. at 449-50.\n\n       We consider this to be a new argument raised on reply. While Ms. Schmidt\n\nmentions the failure to segregate business and household funds in her opening brief, she\n\ndoes so only in the context of showing that Mr. Schmidt did not specifically designate any\n\nportion of the lending enterprise income to the marital community to compensate for Mr.\n\nSchmidt's community labor, thus comingling the separate and community property.\n\nBecause the particular issue raised in Skarbek was not addressed in Ms. Schmidt's\n\nopening brief, Mr. Schmidt did not have the opportunity to respond. Thus, we decline to\n\naddress this issue on appeal.\n\n       The trial court did not err by failing to characterize the increased value in Mr.\n\nSchmidt's lending enterprise as community property.\n\n\n\n\n                                             11 \n\n\fNo.30662-3-III\nIn re Marriage ofSchmidt\n\n\n       Property Division.

The statute's nonexclusive list of factors to be considered is:\n\n(1) the nature and extent of the community property; (2) the nature and extent of the\n\nseparate property; (3) the duration of the marriage; and (4) the economic circumstances of\n\nthe parties. RCW 26.09.080.\n\n       A just and equitable division by a trial court \"does not require mathematical\n\nprecision, but rather fairness, based upon a consideration of all the circumstances of the\n\nmarriage, both past and present, and an evaluation of the future needs of parties.\" In re\n\nMarriage ofCrosetto, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash.

Ms. Schmidt did not have a large property interest in\n\nthe four and one-half year marriage. Ms. Schmidt's community property award was\n\nappropriate based on the court's finding that there was very little community property to\n\ndistribute. Also, the court found Ms. Schmidt's separate property to be minimal.\n\n      Admittedly, the record shows that Mr. Schmidt's economic circumstance was\n\nconsiderably better than Ms. Schmidt's. However, this does not automatically lead to the\n\nconclusion that Ms. Schmidt was owed a larger award. The court identified Mr.\n\nSchmidt's separate property primarily as the house and the lending enterprise, and states\n\nthat Ms. Schmidt did not contribute money or labor to the construction of the home or the\n\noperation of the business. Furthermore, the court took into consideration the fact that Mr.\n\nSchmidt partially compensated Ms. Schmidt between separation and trial by paying\n\n$55,000 in temporary maintenance, medical and dental bills, and other miscellaneous\n\nexpenses.\n\n      The court also recognized Ms. Schmidt's unique situation. The court found that\n\nMs. Schmidt was a 50-year-old immigrant, who came to the United States to marry Mr.\n\nSchmidt, who had very little separate property, and who earned a moderate annual income\n\nof approximately $18,000. The court also found that Ms. Schmidt had some health issues\n\n\n                                            13 \n\n\fNo. 30662-3-111\nIn re Marriage ofSchmidt\n\n\nthat hindered her ability to work in certain fields. In this respect, leaving Ms. Schmidt\n\nwith no assets would not be ajust and equitable distribution of the property. Even though\n\nMs. Schmidt contributed few assets to the community, the trial court had an obligation to\n\nconsider the needs of Ms. Schmidt. The trial court acted appropriately by awarding Ms.\n\nSchmidt $25,000.\n\n       Thus, the trial court's award to Ms. Schmidt did not constitute an abuse of\n\ndiscretion considering the lack of community property, the separate nature ofMr.\n\nSchmidt's income, and the payments made after the parties were separated. Awarding\n\nMs. Schmidt $25,000 in cash and miscellaneous property was a just and equitable\n\ndistribution.\n\n       Maintenance. The trial court's decision on an award of maintenance is reviewed\n\nfor an abuse of discretion. In re Marriage ofZahm, 138 Wn.2d 213,226-27,978 P.2d\n\n498 (1999). An abuse of discretion occurs when the court bases its decision on untenable\n\ngrounds or for untenable reasons. In re Marriage ofFoley, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">839</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 845, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1452662\"><a href=\"/opinion/1452662/in-re-marriage-of-foley/\"><span class=\"volume\">930</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">929</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1997). The court has wide discretion in deciding the amount and term of\n\nmaintenance, with the only limitation being that the award is just in light of all relevant\n\nfactors. In re Marriage a/Luckey, 73 Wn. App.201, 209,868 P.2d 189 (1994). \"An\n\n\n\n\n                                             14 \n\n\fNo. 30662-3-111\nIn re Marriage o/Schmidt\n\n\naward of maintenance that is not based upon a fair consideration of the statutory factors\n\nconstitutes an abuse of discretion.\" Crosetto, 82 Wn. App. at 558.\n\n       RCW 26.09.090 controls the awarding of maintenance. The court must consider\n\n(1) the post-dissolution financial resources of the parties; (2) their abilities to\n\nindependently meet their needs; (3) the time necessary for the party seeking maintenance\n\nto find employment; (4) duration of the marriage; (5) the standard of living during the\n\nmarriage; (6) the age, physical, and emotional condition, and financial obligations of the\n\nspouse seeking maintenance; and (7) the ability of the spouse from whom maintenance is\n\nsought to meet his needs and financial obligations. RCW 26.09.090(a)-(t).\n\n       The maintenance award adequately provided compensation to Ms. Schmidt. The\n\ncourt considered the factors listed in RCW 26.09.090(a) through (t). The court noted that\n\nMs. Schmidt had a modest amount of separate property which essentially had no value.\n\nHowever, the court found that Ms. Schmidt would receive a $25,000 cash award for her\n\nshare of community property. The court also found that Ms. Schmidt would be able to\n\nreturn to work in music education or travel with no additional training, and had the ability\n\nto meet at least 50 percent of her monthly expenses.\n\n       The court stated that the parties were married for four and one-half years and\n\nenjoyed a middle class lifestyle. Mr. Schmidt paid all of her living expenses and bills\n\n\n\n                                               15 \n\n\fNo. 30662-3-III\nIn re Marriage ofSchmidt\n\n\nsince separation, making the remaining dental bill the only financial obligation owed by\n\nMs. Schmidt. The court found that Mr. Schmidt had the ability to pay reasonable\n\nmaintenance and his own financial obligations.\n\n       Dr. Page's report provides support for the trial court's findings. Dr. Page\n\nconcluded that Ms. Schmidt \"is very likely to rebound in short order to levels of greater\n\ncomfort and productivity, once she is situationally beyond the process of contested\n\ndivorce.\" Clerk's Papers at 120. Furthermore, Ms. Schmidt has demonstrated her ability\n\nto use her music training as a means for income by teaching lessons during the marriage.\n\n       The court's award of $2,000 per month for 24 months allowed Ms. Schmidt the\n\ntime she needed to seek out a career in the United States and maintain her middle class\n\nlifestyle. The trial court did not abuse its considerable discretion in its award of\n\nmaintenance for Ms. Schmidt, considering Ms. Schmidt's potential for employment and\n\npotential income, her limited liabilities, and the relatively short duration of the marriage.\n\n       The trial court's property division and award of maintenance did not constitute an\n\nabuse of discretion.\n\n       Attorney Fees. Mr. Schmidt requests attorney fees pursuant to RAP 18.l(b). Mr.\n\nSchmidt fails to cite to legal authority that would allow this court to make such an award\n\non appeal.\n\n\n                                              16 \n\n\fNo.30662-3-III\nIn re Marriage ofSchmidt\n\n\n       In any case, Mr. Schmidt's request fails. To award attorney fees on an appeal ofa\n\ndissolution proceeding, the court examines the merits of the appeal and the financial\n\nresources of the parties.
