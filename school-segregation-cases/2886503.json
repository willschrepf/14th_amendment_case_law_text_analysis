Roberts invested $30,000 in an entity called the Infinity Group\n\nCompany Trust (“TIGC”), which turned out to be a “Ponzi” scheme that brought in some\n\n$26.6 million from over 10,000 investors.1 The SEC obtained an order freezing TIGC’s\n\nassets, and the District Court appointed a receiver to marshal those assets and hold them\n\nin trust for distribution to the defrauded investors. Over 4,800 investors, including\n\nRoberts, filed claims. The receiver ultimately recovered and distributed funds sufficient\n\nto cover 55 percent of each claimant’s investment, which means that Roberts has\n\nrecouped $16,500.\n\n\n\n   1\n    The parties are familiar with the background of this case. All others are referred to\nSEC v. Infinity Group Co., 212 F.3d 180 (3d Cir. 2000), which sets forth the nature and\nhistory of the scheme in some detail.\n\n                                             2\n\f       The receiver decided that the only fair and practicable way of distributing TIGC’s\n\nassets was on a pro rata basis to each investor. Roberts objected to this form of\n\ndistribution for the reason discussed below, but the District Court approved it and\n\noverruled Roberts’s objection in 2000. Roberts filed an appeal, but we dismissed it for\n\nlack of jurisdiction because the District Court had not yet entered a final order. The\n\nDistrict Court has now entered a final order terminating the receiver’s trusteeship and\n\nagain overruling Roberts’s (oft-renewed) objection, and Roberts appeals pro se from that\n\norder. For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.2\n\n       District Courts have wide equitable discretion in fashioning distribution plans in\n\nreceivership proceedings, and we review the District Court’s order only for abuse of that\n\ndiscretion. See Black, 163 F.3d at 199; SEC v. Fischbach, 133 F.3d 170, 175 (2d Cir.\n\n1997). We do not believe that the District Court abused its discretion here. In the\n\noriginal Ponzi scheme case, Cunningham v. Brown, 265 U.S. 1 (1924), the Supreme\n\nCourt held that “tracing” fictions should not be used to pursue individual recoveries when\n\na fraud ensnares multiple victims whose funds are commingled. See id. at 12-13.\n\nInstead, the Court held that all innocent victims should share equally in the recovered\n\nfunds because equity demands equal treatment. See id.\n\n       Since then, the Courts of Appeals repeatedly have recognized that pro rata\n\ndistribution of a defrauder’s assets to multiple victims of the fraud is appropriate and that\n\n\n\n   2\n    We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n                                              3\n\fDistrict Courts act within their discretion in approving such distributions. See, e.g., SEC\n\nv. Credit Bancorp, Ltd., 290 F.3d 80, 89 (2d Cir. 2002) (explaining that “the use of a pro\n\nrata distribution has been deemed especially appropriate for fraud victims of a ‘Ponzi’\n\nscheme” and collecting cases); United States v. 13328 and 13324 State Highway North,\n\n89 F.3d 551, 553-54 (9th Cir. 1996) (collecting cases). This is so even when\n\ncircumstances that do not provide any equitable basis to distinguish between investors\n\nmake it possible to trace particular investors’ assets. See, e.g., Credit Bancorp, 290 F.3d\n\nat 89 (affirming pro rata distribution where tracing possible as a result of “merely\n\nfortuitous” events); United States v. Durham, 86 F.3d 70, 73 (5th Cir. 1996) (same); SEC\n\nv. Forex Asset Mgmt. LLC, 242 F.3d 325, 331-32 (5th Cir. 2001) (affirming pro rata\n\ndistribution where objecting investors’ funds were segregated in a separate account and\n\nnever commingled).\n\n       Roberts, however, argues that he is entitled to the return of his full $30,000\n\ninvestment because TIGC never actually had access to his money and $30,000 of the\n\nfunds remaining in its account when it was frozen can thus be traced directly to him.\n\nRoberts invested his money by means of a $30,000 cashier’s check, which shows that\n\nTIGC deposited it on August 25, 1997. According to Roberts, TIGC’s bank had a policy\n\nof placing a three-day “hold” on cashier’s check funds and the actual funds thus would\n\nnot have become available to TIGC until August 28, 1997. On August 27, 1997,\n\nhowever, the District Court entered two temporary restraining orders freezing TIGC’s\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\faccount. Thus, Roberts argues, his $30,000 never became available to TIGC and\n\nnecessarily remained in its account when the District Court froze it on August 27.\n\n       We will assume for present purposes the truth of Roberts’s allegations.3 Those\n\nallegations, however, establish merely that it would have been possible to trace his\n\n$30,000 to money remaining in the TIGC account, not that equity demanded he receive it\n\nall back. According to Roberts, the bank policy on which he relies wound up depriving\n\nTIGC of access to his funds solely by reason of the date on which TIGC deposited his\n\ncheck. The mere fact that it did so just two days before its account was frozen does not\n\ngive Roberts equitable priority over the thousands of other victims of TIGC’s fraud.\n\nAccordingly, the District Court determined that there is no equitable basis to distinguish\n\nbetween early investors and those, like Roberts, who invested shortly before TIGC’s\n\naccount was frozen, and that all investors should thus be treated the same. (June 9, 2000\n\nOrder at 1; Aug. 28, 2006 Order at 2 n.1.) We cannot say that the District Court abused\n\nits wide equitable discretion in so concluding. See, e.g., Credit Bancorp, 290 F.3d at 89;\n\nForex Asset Mgmt., 242 F.3d at 331-32.4\n\n\n   3\n    For this reason, we need not address Robert’s argument that he was denied “equal\nprotection” by the receiver’s or District Court’s alleged failure to investigate and establish\nthese allegations.\n   4\n    Roberts has not cited any legal authority. We have located one appellate decision that\npotentially supports his position, but it is distinguishable. In Anderson v. Stephens, 875\nF.2d 76 (4th Cir. 1989), a defrauder deposited certain of his victims’ checks in an account\none day after it had been frozen by court order, and the bank accepted the deposit despite\nthe freeze. Reasoning that the effect of the freeze was to prevent the defrauder from\n                                                                                (continued...)\n\n                                              5\n\f       The District Court’s order will be affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n   4\n    (...continued)\ntransacting business of any kind with the account, the Fourth Circuit held that the post-\nfreeze deposit was invalid and that the funds in question should have been returned in full\nto the individual investors, not combined with the defrauder’s assets for pro rata\ndistribution. See id. at 79-80. Here, by contrast, TIGC deposited Roberts’s cashier’s\ncheck two days before the District Court froze its account, so that deposit was perfectly\nvalid. Even if we were to find Anderson persuasive, that distinction is dispositive. We\nfurther note that nothing in the District Court’s temporary restraining orders prevented\nTIGC’s bank from crediting already-deposited funds to TIGC’s account after the freeze.\n\n                                             6\n\f",

According to Roberts, TIGC’s bank had a policy\n\nof placing a three-day “hold” on cashier’s check funds and the actual funds thus would\n\nnot have become available to TIGC until August 28, 1997. On August 27, 1997,\n\nhowever, the District Court entered two temporary restraining orders freezing TIGC’s\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\faccount. Thus, Roberts argues, his $30,000 never became available to TIGC and\n\nnecessarily remained in its account when the District Court froze it on August 27.\n\n       We will assume for present purposes the truth of Roberts’s allegations.3 Those\n\nallegations, however, establish merely that it would have been possible to trace his\n\n$30,000 to money remaining in the TIGC account, not that equity demanded he receive it\n\nall back. According to Roberts, the bank policy on which he relies wound up depriving\n\nTIGC of access to his funds solely by reason of the date on which TIGC deposited his\n\ncheck. The mere fact that it did so just two days before its account was frozen does not\n\ngive Roberts equitable priority over the thousands of other victims of TIGC’s fraud.\n\nAccordingly, the District Court determined that there is no equitable basis to distinguish\n\nbetween early investors and those, like Roberts, who invested shortly before TIGC’s\n\naccount was frozen, and that all investors should thus be treated the same. (June 9, 2000\n\nOrder at 1; Aug. 28, 2006 Order at 2 n.1.) We cannot say that the District Court abused\n\nits wide equitable discretion in so concluding. See, e.g., Credit Bancorp, 290 F.3d at 89;\n\nForex Asset Mgmt., 242 F.3d at 331-32.4\n\n\n   3\n    For this reason, we need not address Robert’s argument that he was denied “equal\nprotection” by the receiver’s or District Court’s alleged failure to investigate and establish\nthese allegations.\n   4\n    Roberts has not cited any legal authority. We have located one appellate decision that\npotentially supports his position, but it is distinguishable. In Anderson v. Stephens, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"523243\"><a href=\"/opinion/523243/s-wayne-anderson-dwight-e-jefferson-and-commodity-futures-trading/\"><span class=\"volume\">875</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 1989), a defrauder deposited certain of his victims’ checks in an account\none day after it had been frozen by court order, and the bank accepted the deposit despite\nthe freeze. Reasoning that the effect of the freeze was to prevent the defrauder from\n                                                                                (continued...)\n\n                                              5\n\f       The District Court’s order will be affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n   4\n    (...continued)\ntransacting business of any kind with the account, the Fourth Circuit held that the post-\nfreeze deposit was invalid and that the funds in question should have been returned in full\nto the individual investors, not combined with the defrauder’s assets for pro rata\ndistribution. See id. at 79-80. Here, by contrast, TIGC deposited Roberts’s cashier’s\ncheck two days before the District Court froze its account, so that deposit was perfectly\nvalid. Even if we were to find Anderson persuasive, that distinction is dispositive. We\nfurther note that nothing in the District Court’s temporary restraining orders prevented\nTIGC’s bank from crediting already-deposited funds to TIGC’s account after the freeze.\n\n                                             6\n\f</pre>",
