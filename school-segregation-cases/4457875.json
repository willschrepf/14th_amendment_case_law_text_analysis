CR_3-5.\n\nCourse of Proceedings:            The City timely requested an Attorney\n                                  General decision letter pursuant to\n                                  Texas Government Code section\n                                  552.301 regarding a portion of the\n                                  requested documents. CR_8-11. The\n                                  Attorney General held that most of the\n                                  information was protected by attorney-\n                                  client privilege, but other information\n                                  was not protected by that privilege and\n                                  must be disclosed. CR_27. The City\n                                  brought suit against the Attorney\n                                  General seeking to withhold the\n                                  information that the Attorney General\n                                  held was not privileged.

Mayor Parker promulgates Executive Order 1-39 Revised, establishing\n      the Office of Inspector General under the supervision of the City\n      Attorney.\n\n      On March 1, 2011, Mayor Parker approved Executive Order 1-39\n\nRevised, which established the Office of Inspector General (OIG) as a division\n\nof the Office of the City Attorney and under the City Attorney’s supervision.\n\nCR_14-18 (see section 2.1). Ms. Robin Curtis, who is a board certified Labor\n\nand Employment Law attorney, was appointed and currently serves as the\n\nCity’s Inspector General (IG). CR_19. Ms. Sandra W. Robinson is also an\n\nattorney working in the OIG in the City’s Legal Department. CR_19.\n\n      The Executive Order establishing the OIG specifically provides that the\n\nOIG has the responsibility to “[s]upply information, which information may\n\nbe protected from public disclosure as provided by law, to … Directors of City\n\nDepartments to facilitate investigations of allegations of employee misconduct\n\nand any associated disciplinary actions or enforcement of civil or criminal\n\nlaws.” CR_14-15 (Section 5.1.3). Additionally, the OIG “may consult with the\n\nCity Controller regarding allegations of employee misconduct that may expose\n\nthe City to significant financial loss.” CR_15 (Section 5.3). The Inspector\n\nGeneral “shall supervise the OIG in its investigation of fraud, corruption,\n\nwaste, mismanagement, conflicts of interest, ethics violations, discrimination\n\fand violations of state or federal law, the City Charter, City Ordinances, City\n\nCouncil Code of Conduct, Executive Orders, Administrative Procedures, or\n\nMayor’s Policies.” CR_15 (Section 5.2).\n\n\nII.    City policy as set forth in Executive Order 1-39 Revised requires all\n       City employees to cooperate fully with any OIG investigation.\n\n       The OIG City policy expressly states that “[a]ll City employees and\n\nappointed officials shall cooperate fully with any investigation conducted by\n\nthe OIG and must provide truthful information, written statements,\n\ndocuments, and related materials upon OIG’s request.” CR_16 (Section 5.7.3).\n\nFurther, the policy provides that “[a]ny City employees or appointed official\n\nwho fails to fully cooperate with any OIG investigation violates this Executive\n\nOrder and, accordingly, commits misconduct.” CR_16 (Section 5.7.4).\n\n\nIII.   A lawyer from the OIG conducts an internal investigation on behalf\n       of the City.\n\n       In early 2013, an attorney for the City working in the Office of the\n\nInspector General in the City’s Legal Department conducted an internal\n\ninvestigation into alleged wrongdoing of City employees pursuant to Office of\n\nInspector General’s Complaint #111-100288-001(HCCSC). See CR_19 (listing\n\nCity Legal Department personnel); (Information at Issue (IAI) at AG\n\nJenkins(Brooks)00008, 00024 (naming the City lawyer in the OIG who\n\n\n                                      2\n\fconducted the interviews); CR_12-13. That attorney interviewed City\n\nemployees in order to ascertain whether the allegations of wrongdoing had any\n\nfactual basis on which OIG gave legal advice about possible courses of action\n\nto the City. See, e.g., IAI at AG Jenkins(Brooks)00008-14, 00024-28; see also\n\nCR_12-13 (referring to Mr. Brooks’s pre-termination hearing). Each\n\ninterviewee initialed the preamble statement, which, among other things:\n\nexplained they were furnishing the statement voluntarily and not as a\n\ncondition of employment with the City; stressed the confidential nature of the\n\ndocument and that it not be disclosed, except to that interviewee’s individual\n\nattorney; and instructed each interviewee to provide complete information to\n\nthe OIG attorney investigator. See IAI at AG Jenkins(Brooks)00008, 00024.\n\n\nIV.   An attorney representing a Respondent employee who was\n      interviewed files a request pursuant to the Texas Public Information\n      Act (“TPIA” or “Act”) for the OIG report and supporting evidence.\n\n      On October 29, 2013, the City received a TPIA request from Ms. Stacey\n\nM. Jenkins, counsel for Mr. Willie Brooks, for records related its investigation\n\nof certain City of Houston employees, including Mr. Brooks, as a result of\n\nOIG Complaint #111-100288-001(HCCSC). CR_12-13. The City made\n\navailable certain information to Ms. Jenkins and timely requested an Attorney\n\nGeneral opinion on the remainder on November 12, 2013. CR_21-24. The\n\nCity asserted in its letter that the information at issue was not subject to\n\n                                       3\n\fdisclosure pursuant to section 552.108 of the TPIA1 and to the attorney-client\n\ncommunication privilege found in Texas Rule of Evidence 503. CR_21-24.\n\n         On February 14, 2014, the City received Open Records Letter Ruling\n\nOR2014-02684 from the Attorney General. CR_25-29. The Attorney General\n\nagreed with the City concerning most of the information that the City sought to\n\nwithhold. CR_27 (“[W]e find that you have established most of the submitted\n\ninformation is protected by attorney-client privilege.”) (citing Harlandale Indep.\n\nSch. Dist. v. Cornyn, 25 S.W.3d 328 (Tex. App.—Austin 2000, pet. denied)).\n\nThe Attorney General opined that certain other information was not privileged\n\nand therefore subject to disclosure. CR_27. Of that information, the only\n\n“information at issue” remaining on appeal are two statements from\n\nRespondent employees who were interviewed by a lawyer in the OIG as part\n\nof the investigation into possible employee wrongdoing in a City program. See\n\nIAI at AG Jenkins(Brooks)00008-14 and AG Jenkins(Brooks)00024-28 (a\n\nportion of the “Information at Issue” submitted to the Court for in camera\n\nreview).2\n\n\n\n1\n    Tex. Gov’t Code §§ 552.001 et seq.\n2\n  Although two other documents were part of the “Information at Issue” submitted to the\ntrial court for in camera review, the City has made AG Jenkins(Brooks)00002 (a letter) and\nAG Jenkins(Brooks)00004 (a letter) available to the requestor and those are not at issue on\nappeal.\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\f      On February 24, 2014, as required by the statute to appeal, the City sued\n\nthe Attorney General pursuant to section 552.324 of the TPIA challenging the\n\nfinding in Open Records Letter Ruling OR2014-02684 that a few of the\n\ndocuments gathered in the City’s internal investigation were subject to\n\ndisclosure. CR_3-5. On cross motions for summary judgment, the trial court\n\ngranted the Attorney General’s motion, denied the City’s motion, and entered\n\njudgment that the “information at issue” is subject to disclosure. CR_109.\n\n      The City now appeals.\n\n\n                          Summary of the Argument\n\n      The information at issue in this case—two Respondent interviewee\n\nstatements by City employees taken in the course of an internal investigation\n\nby the OIG in the City Attorney’s office—is not subject to disclosure because it\n\nis protected by attorney-client privilege under Texas Rule of Evidence 503. The\n\nOIG conducted the investigation at the behest of its client, the City, and the\n\ninformation at issue is part of the OIG’s investigative report. City employees\n\nwho gave confidential statements to the City’s attorney in the OIG were acting\n\naccording to City policy of cooperating with OIG investigations. This\n\ncooperation furthered the City’s purposes of obtaining legal advice about what\n\nlegal courses of action to take regarding the allegations of wrongdoing in one\n\nof its departments that affected a City program.\n\n                                       5\n\f      There is no evidence that the City waived its privilege in this case with\n\nrespect to the information at issue and no evidence that any other exception to\n\nthe privilege applies. The privilege belongs to the City, and the City has\n\nmaintained the confidentiality of the information at issue in this case.\n\nAccordingly, the Court should reverse the trial court’s judgment and render\n\njudgment for the City that the remaining “information at issue” is protected by\n\nattorney-client privilege and is not subject to disclosure.\n\n\n                           Argument and Authorities\n\nI.    Standard of review for cross-motions for summary judgment.\n\n      Courts review a trial court’s decision to grant summary judgment de\n\nnovo. Ferguson v. Bldg. Materials Corp. of Am., 295 S.W.3d 642, 644 (Tex. 2009).\n\nWhen both parties move for summary judgment and the trial court grants one\n\nmotion and denies the other, courts review both sides’ summary judgment\n\nevidence and determine all questions presented. FM Props. Operating Co. v. City\n\nof Austin, 22 S.W.3d 868, 872 (Tex. 2000) (citing Comm’rs Court of Titus Cnty. v.\n\nAgan, 940 S.W.2d 77, 81 (Tex. 1997); Jones v. Strauss, 745 S.W.2d 898, 900\n\n(Tex. 1988)). When reviewing cross-motions for summary judgment, courts\n\nconsider both motions and render the judgment that the trial court should have\n\nrendered. Coastal Liquids Transp., L.P. v. Harris Cnty. Appraisal Dist., 46 S.W.3d\n\n\n\n\n                                         6\n\f880, 884 (Tex. 2001); see also Mid-Continent Cas. Co. v. Global Enercom Mgmt.,\n\nInc., 323 S.W.3d 151, 153-54 (Tex. 2010).\n\n      To succeed on a motion for summary judgment, a party must show that\n\nthere is no genuine issue of material fact and that it is entitled to summary\n\njudgment as a matter of law. Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c); Mann Frankfort Stein &\n\nLipp Advisors, Inc. v. Fielding, 289 S.W.3d 844, 848 (Tex. 2009); Nixon v. Mr.\n\nProp. Mgt. Co., 690 S.W.2d 546, 548 (Tex. 1985).\n\n\nII.   Information protected by the attorney-client privilege is not subject to\n      disclosure under the TPIA.\n\n      A.    The TPIA requires disclosure of public information unless an\n            exception applies.\n\n      The TPIA provides, “it is the policy of this state that each person is\n\nentitled, unless otherwise expressly provided by law, at all times to complete\n\ninformation about the affairs of government and the official acts of public\n\nofficials and employees.” Tex. Gov’t Code § 552.001. A completed\n\ninvestigation is considered public information under the TPIA unless it is\n\nsubject to an exception. Section 552.022 of the TPIA provides, in relevant part:\n\n      The following categories of information are public information\n      and not exempted from required disclosure under this chapter\n      unless they are expressly confidential under other law:\n\n            (1) a completed report, audit, evaluation, or investigation\n      made of, for, or by a governmental body, except as provided by\n      Section 552.108[.]\n\n                                       7\n\fTex. Gov’t Code § 552.022(a)(1).\n\n      The “information at issue” in this case consists of portions of a\n\ncompleted investigation made by the City’s OIG. Therefore, as part of a\n\ncompleted investigation, it must be released unless it is excepted from\n\ndisclosure under section 552.108 of the TPIA or is expressly confidential under\n\n“other law.” Id. For the reasons set forth below, the information at issue is\n\nconfidential by law under Texas Rule of Evidence 503.\n\n\n      B.    Texas Rules of Evidence comprise “other law” that makes\n            information “expressly confidential” and not subject to\n            disclosure under the TPIA.\n\n      While considering a similar issue, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that\n\nthe Texas Rules of Evidence are such “other law” which makes information\n\n“expressly confidential” in the context of section 552.022 of the TPIA. See In re\n\nCity of Georgetown, 53 S.W.3d 328, 336 (Tex. 2001); see also Abbott v. City of\n\nDallas, 453 S.W.3d 580, 588-89 (Tex. App.—Austin 2014, pet. filed) (noting\n\nthat the attorney-client privilege is “the ‘oldest of privileges for confidential\n\ncommunications known to the common law’” and holding that the privilege\n\nwas not waived by missing a TPIA deadline) (quoting Upjohn Co. v. United\n\nStates, 449 U.S. 383, 389, 101 S. Ct. 677 (1981)).\n\n\n\n\n                                        8\n\f     C.    The attorney-client privilege.\n\n     The attorney-client privilege protects from disclosure confidential\n\ncommunications between client and counsel made for the purpose of\n\nfacilitating the rendition of legal services. Tex. R. Evid. 503(b); Huie v.\n\nDeShazo, 922 S.W.2d 920, 922 (Tex. 1996). The privilege attaches to the\n\ncomplete communication—legal advice and factual information—between\n\nattorney and client, and the subject matter of the information in the\n\ncommunication is irrelevant to the determination of whether the privilege\n\napplies. In re Valero Energy Corp., 973 S.W.2d 453, 457 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 1998, no pet.) (citing Marathon Oil Co. v. Moye, 893 S.W.2d 585,\n\n589 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1994, orig. proceeding)).\n\n     Texas Rule of Evidence 503(b)(1) provides:\n\n     A client has a privilege to refuse to disclose and to prevent any\n     other person from disclosing confidential communications made\n     for the purpose of facilitating the rendition of professional legal\n     services to the client:\n\n            (A) between the client or a representative of the client and\n     the client’s lawyer or a representative of the lawyer;\n\n           (B) between the lawyer and the lawyer’s representative;\n\n            (C) by the client or a representative of the client, or the\n     client’s lawyer or a representative of the lawyer, to a lawyer or a\n     representative of a lawyer representing another party in a pending\n     action and concerning a matter of common interest therein;\n\n\n\n\n                                       9\n\f                (D) between representatives of the client or between the\n         client and a representative of the client; or\n\n              (E) among lawyers and their representatives representing the\n         same client.\n\nTex. R. Evid. 503(b)(1). A communication is “confidential” if it is “not\n\nintended to be disclosed to third persons other than those to whom disclosure\n\nis made in furtherance of the rendition of professional legal services to the\n\nclient    or   those   reasonably   necessary   for   the   transmission   of   the\n\ncommunication.” Id. 503(a)(5).\n\n         Rule 503 was amended in 1998, replacing the “control group” test with\n\nthe “subject matter” test to determine whether a communication was made\n\nbetween a representative of a client and the client’s lawyer. See In re E.I. DuPont\n\nde Nemours and Co., 136 S.W.3d 218, 226 n.3 (Tex. 2004); accord Upjohn, 449\n\nU.S. at 394-97 (rejecting the “control group test” and applying the attorney-\n\nclient privilege to interviews between employees and company lawyers in the\n\ncourse of an internal investigation into illegal payments to foreign\n\ngovernments). “[T]he privilege exists to protect not only the giving of\n\nprofessional advice to those who can act on it but also the giving of\n\ninformation to the lawyer to enable him to give sound and informed advice.”\n\nUpjohn, 449 U.S. at 390 (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                        10\n\f      In Texas, “[t]he subject matter test is met where ‘the employee makes the\n\ncommunication at the direction of his superiors in the corporation and where\n\nthe subject matter upon which the attorney’s advice is sought by the\n\ncorporation and dealt with in the communication is the performance by the\n\nemployee of the duties of his employment.’” DuPont, 136 S.W.3d at 226 n.3\n\n(quoting Nat’l Tank Co. v. Brotherton, 851 S.W.2d 193 (Tex. 1993)). A\n\n“representative of the client” is not limited to upper management employees,\n\nbut instead includes “any other person who, to facilitate the rendition of\n\nprofessional legal services to the client, makes or receives a confidential\n\ncommunication while acting in the scope of employment for the client.” Tex.\n\nR. Evid. 503(a)(2)(B).\n\n      When an attorney conducts an investigation in her capacity as an\n\nattorney for the purpose of providing legal services and advice to a client, an\n\nattorney’s entire investigative report comes under the attorney-client privilege.\n\nHarlandale, 25 S. W.3d 328 (entire report privileged and not subject to\n\ndisclosure); Tex. Att’y Gen. Op. No. OR2014-02684 at 3, 2014 WL 1254396 at\n\n*2 (Feb. 12, 2014) (CR_27) (citing and relying on Harlandale to find that most\n\nof the City’s documents in its investigative file were protected by attorney-\n\nclient privilege in this case); accord Upjohn, 449 U.S. at 395 (all of the interviews\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\fand questionnaires circulated by general counsel to employees were protected\n\nby privilege).\n\n\nIII.   The information at issue was part of an internal investigation\n       conducted at the behest of the City by City attorneys at OIG to\n       provide legal advice to the City.\n\n       The information at issue consists of interviews conducted in the course\n\nof an internal investigation by the OIG into alleged wrongdoing by City\n\nemployees in a City department. IAI at AG Jenkins(Brooks)00008-14, 00024-\n\n28; CR_22. These interviews are part of the OIG’s investigative file and are\n\nincorporated into the OIG’s investigative report. CR_22. In its opinion letter,\n\nthe Attorney General ruled that most of the information that was part of the\n\ninternal investigation was protected by the attorney-client privilege based on\n\nHarlandale, 25 S.W.3d 328. CR_27.\n\n       Even though Harlandale held that all of the material that was part of the\n\nreport was privileged and could not be segregated out piecemeal, 25 S.W.3d at\n\n333-34, the Attorney General and the trial court in this case have held exactly\n\nthe opposite, contending that two interviews conducted in the course of that\n\ninvestigation and made part of the report are not privileged because those\n\nemployees were being questioned about their own conduct in addition to\n\nconduct of others in the department. CR_42. Yet, this Court’s precedent and\n\nother case law hold that the entire investigative report from an attorney’s\n\n                                       12\n\finternal investigation conducted at the behest of a corporate client is protected\n\nby attorney-client privilege, without regard to whether some of the\n\ninterviewees had committed the wrongdoing under investigation.\n\n\n      A.    The Attorney General’s piecemeal approach to the investigative\n            file is contrary to this Court’s precedent and other case law.\n\n      In Harlandale, a police sergeant who was reprimanded for inappropriate\n\nconduct had filed a formal grievance, which prompted Harlandale to hire an\n\nattorney to investigate the facts and write a report with recommendations. 25\n\nS.W.3d at 329-30. After the attorney had conducted numerous interviews and\n\nwrote a report which included her findings and recommendations, a requestor\n\nasked for the report and all of the supporting exhibits pursuant to the TPIA. Id.\n\nat 330. Harlandale timely requested an opinion letter from the AG, claiming\n\nattorney-client privilege. Id. The AG’s opinion letter in Harlandale parsed the\n\nreport for the purposes of attorney-client privilege, holding that certain sections\n\nwere “factual” and had to be disclosed while other parts could be withheld. 25\n\nS.W.3d at 330 & nn.1, 2. This Court reversed and rendered for Harlandale,\n\nexplaining that the entire report was privileged where the attorney was hired to\n\ninvestigate and give legal advice. Id. at 333-34.\n\n      Here, the Attorney General is again trying to parse an investigative\n\nreport that is covered by attorney-client privilege, recognizing that “most” of\n\n\n                                        13\n\fthe information that was part of the investigation is protected by attorney-client\n\nprivilege, but then selecting out two interviews as allegedly “not privileged”\n\nbecause the interviewees were purportedly subjects of the investigation.\n\nCR_27. But this Court has already rejected the Attorney General’s piecemeal\n\napproach to an investigative report in Harlandale. There is no basis for the\n\nAttorney General to find that parts of the report should be subject to disclosure\n\nwhile finding the rest of the investigative file to be privileged.\n\n       The United States Supreme Court’s sound reasoning in Upjohn Company\n\nv. United States is also instructive here, because the facts in Upjohn are similar to\n\nthis case and because the Texas attorney-client privilege standard is similar to\n\nthe federal standard.3 449 U.S. 383. In Upjohn, the client-corporation\n\ndiscovered that at least one of its overseas subsidiaries had made “questionable\n\npayments” to foreign governments. Id. at 386. Upjohn’s general counsel\n\nconducted interviews and sent out questionnaires to numerous employees as\n\npart of an internal investigation to gather facts and render advice to Upjohn.\n\n\n3\n  Cf. Upjohn, 449 U.S. 383 (rejecting “control group” as the standard for attorney-client\nprivilege in the corporate context and allowing for communications with lower- and middle-\nlevel employees to be privileged where they are conducted at the request of supervisors and\nconcern the subject matter of their employment) with DuPont, 136 S.W.3d at 226 n.3\n(explaining that amended Texas Rule of Evidence 503 replaced the control group test with\nthe subject matter test); see also Alpert v. Riley, 267 F.R.D. 202, 208 (S.D. Tex. 2010) (finding\nthat Texas Rule of Evidence 503 requirements for establishing privilege are similar to those\nrequired under federal common law); Harlandale, 25 S.W.3d at 333-34 (citing and finding\ninstructive several federal cases, including Upjohn).\n\n\n\n                                               14\n\fId. at 386-87. The investigation in Upjohn, as here, involved queries of lower-\n\nlevel employees who were close enough to the actual events that their input as\n\ninterviewees was invaluable to enable counsel to give Upjohn the legal advice\n\nto know how to proceed to rectify its situation. Id. at 391; IAI at AG\n\nJenkins(Brooks)00008-14, 00024-28. When the Internal Revenue Service\n\nsought those interviews and questionnaires in a subsequent enforcement\n\naction, the Court held that the interviews and questionnaires of employees—\n\nregardless of whether they were lower level employees or part of a “control\n\ngroup”—were protected by attorney client privilege. Upjohn, 449 U.S. at 391-\n\n92, 395.\n\n      The Attorney General’s distinction that some of the interviewees were\n\n“targets” of the investigation lacks merit, because nothing in Upjohn suggests\n\nthat the Court made a distinction between interviews and questionnaires from\n\nthe actual employees responsible for the “questionable payments” and those in\n\nthe company who were not making the “possibly illegal” payoffs. In fact,\n\nimplicit in the Supreme Court’s holding is that the very people who were most\n\nhelpful to interview were those at the center of, and even perpetrating, the\n\nmisconduct. See id. at 391 (commenting that lower-level employees by their\n\nactions in the scope of their employment can “embroil” the corporation into\n\nlegal difficulties and therefore their information is highly relevant and helpful).\n\n\n                                        15\n\f      In re USA Waste Management Resources, L.L.C. is also helpful here. 387\n\nS.W.3d 92 (Tex App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2012, orig. proceeding).\n\nDefendant Waste Management sought protection from the disclosure of a\n\ncommunication between its counsel and a former employee, Royda Jennings\n\n(Jennings). Id. at 95. Jennings was terminated after she was deposed in a third\n\nparty case because her testimony contradicted information she gave to Waste\n\nManagement in the course of that investigation. Id. Jennings sought to\n\nintroduce   an   affidavit   divulging    the   conversation   between   Waste\n\nManagement’s counsel and Jennings in preparation for her deposition. Id. On\n\nmandamus to prevent the court-ordered disclosure, the appellate court\n\ndetermined that the communication was privileged and not subject to\n\ndisclosure because: 1) the communication was made at the direction of a\n\nsupervisor in the corporation; and 2) the subject matter upon which the\n\nattorney’s advice was sought is the performance by the employee of the\n\nemployee’s duties of her employment. Id. at 96, 97-98. The court reasoned that\n\nbecause Waste Management had a policy in place requiring full cooperation\n\nwith investigations into workplace violence, and because Waste Management\n\ntook steps to ensure that the conversation remained confidential, Waste\n\nManagement had met its burden that the communication between Waste\n\nManagement’s counsel and Jennings was privileged. Id. at 97-98.\n\n\n                                         16\n\f      As in Upjohn, Harlandale, and Waste Management, the City’s interviews\n\nwith employees who were present when the wrongdoing occurred, either as\n\nwitnesses or possible wrongdoers, was invaluable to the City’s discovery of the\n\nextent and nature of the problems in a City department and to obtaining the\n\nlegal advice on how to address it. The interviewees cooperated with the\n\ninvestigation pursuant to City policy of full cooperation with OIG\n\ninvestigations. AG Jenkins(Brooks)00008, 00024 at ¶ 3; CR_16. As part of the\n\ninternal investigation, the interviews are privileged regardless of whether the\n\ninterviewees’ conduct was a subject of the communication. See Valero, 973\n\nS.W.2d at 457 (the content of the communication does not matter for purposes\n\nof the attorney-client privilege).\n\n      Furthermore, the entire investigative report—including the factual\n\ninterviews—was protected by the attorney-client privilege in Harlandale. 25\n\nS.W.3d at 333. All of the interviews and questionnaires in Upjohn were\n\nprotected by the privilege, 449 U.S. at 395, and all of the substance of the\n\ninterview with Jennings was protected in Waste Management. 387 S.W.3d at 98.\n\nAccordingly, the interviews at issue were part of the City’s internal\n\ninvestigation and are privileged, just like the interviews in Harlandale, Upjohn,\n\nand Waste Management.\n\n\n\n\n                                       17\n\f      B.    The parties involved in each communication at issue are\n            identified on the face of the documents in question as being an\n            attorney for the City and a City employee.\n\n      The information at issue identifies OIG attorney Sandra W. Robinson as\n\nbeing from the “Office of Inspector General,” and the personnel sheet lists her\n\nas working in the Legal Department. AG Jenkins(Brooks)00008, 00024 at ¶ 3;\n\nCR_19. In both statements at issue, the affiants state that they are employed by\n\nthe City and provide their employee numbers. AG Jenkins(Brooks)00008,\n\n00024 at ¶ 2. Accordingly, the documents identify the parties as a lawyer for\n\nthe City and a City employee, and instruct that the employee is to cooperate\n\nfully in the investigation and keep the communication confidential. Id.\n\n\n      C.    Counsel for the City conducted the internal investigation in\n            order to give advice to the City as the client.\n\n      Just as outside counsel in Harlandale and in-house counsel in Upjohn and\n\nWaste Management were tasked with conducting internal investigations and\n\nrecommending legal courses of action for their corporate clients, the attorneys\n\nin the OIG are the City’s attorneys tasked with investigating and reporting\n\nfacts and recommending a legal course of action for the City. Harlandale, 25\n\nS.W.3d at 335; Upjohn, 449 U.S. at 390-91; Waste Management, 387 S.W.3d at\n\n95; CR_14-16, 19. Like the attorney in Harlandale, the OIG compiled a report\n\nafter conducting interviews with several employees, and the “Information at\n\n\n                                      18\n\fIssue” in this case was used in that report. 25 S.W.3d at 330; CR_22, IAI at\n\nAG Jenkins(Brooks)00008-14, 00024-28. Like the in-house attorneys in Upjohn\n\nand Waste Management, the information gleaned from the internal investigation\n\nhere enabled OIG attorneys Sandra W. Robinson and Inspector General\n\nRobin Curtis to render legal advice regarding personnel issues and\n\ndepartmental guidance. CR_14-16, 19.\n\n\n      D.    The communication is and has remained confidential.\n\n      Like Waste Management and Upjohn, the City took steps to ensure and\n\nmaintain the confidentiality of the communications. Waste Management, 387\n\nS.W.3d at 97; Upjohn, 449 U.S. at 395; IAI at AG Jenkins(Brooks)00008,\n\n00024) (instructing interviewees that the statements are confidential and\n\nexpressly prohibiting copying or distribution of same). The City admonished\n\neach interviewee not to discuss the investigation with anyone except that\n\nperson’s lawyer, and threatened prosecution if any non-employees (i.e.,\n\nJenkins or others) disseminated the document illegally. IAI at AG\n\nJenkins(Brooks)00008, 00024. There is no indication or evidence that any third\n\nparties were present during the communication or that Jenkins represented\n\neither interviewee whose statements are at issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                       19\n\f      E.    The communication was made at the direction of the City and\n            pursuant to the City’s policy of full employee cooperation with\n            the OIG.\n\n      As mentioned above, both of the interviews at issue were between an\n\nattorney for the City and a City employee interviewed at the behest of the\n\nclient-City. IAI at AG Jenkins(Brooks)00008, 00024. City policy requires all of\n\nits employees to cooperate with an OIG investigation; failure to do so is\n\nconsidered employee misconduct. CR_16. The interviewees were summoned\n\nby the OIG to give statements about their everyday work procedures and were\n\nquestioned about documentation protocols for a program run by the City\n\ndepartment in which they worked. IAI at AG Jenkins(Brooks)00009-14,\n\n00025-28. While it is true that the boilerplate preamble to the statement states\n\nthat the individual interviewees were furnishing voluntary statements not as a\n\ncondition of employment, each interviewee was expected, as part of their duty\n\nas City employees, to cooperate fully with the investigation. CR_16; IAI at AG\n\nJenkins(Brooks)00008, 00024. Indeed, the employees were specifically\n\ninstructed to give full information about the situation to the OIG. IAI at AG\n\nJenkins(Brooks)00008,    00024.   The        employees’   cooperation   with   the\n\ninvestigation furthered the City’s purposes to obtain legal advice about the\n\nprudent course of action regarding alleged wrongdoing in a City department.\n\nCR 9, 12; IAI at AG Jenkins(Brooks)00008, 00024.\n\n\n                                        20\n\f     Additionally, cooperating with the OIG investigation is part of the\n\nsubject matter of each employee’s job. CR_14-16, 19, IAI at AG\n\nJenkins(Brooks)00008-14, 00024-28. The interviews themselves concerned the\n\nsubject matter of the employee’s employment, with the questions relating to\n\nday-to-day procedures and protocols used by each employee and a recounting\n\nof what happened on the job on key days in question. IAI at AG\n\nJenkins(Brooks)00008-14, 00024-28. These interviews aided the OIG in\n\nobtaining a picture of what happened so that it could recommend a legal\n\ncourse of action to help the City program. AI at AG Jenkins(Brooks)00008-14,\n\n00024-28.\n\n\n     F.     The factual information Jenkins seeks is available through other\n            means.\n\n     Additionally, like those seeking the protected material in Harlandale and\n\nUpjohn, nothing prevents Jenkins from seeking out the individual employees to\n\ngather her own set of facts about what occurred in the department. See\n\nHarlandale, 25 S.W.3d at 335 (stating that “[i]n weighing these competing\n\nconcerns [between the TPIA and attorney-client privilege], we need not\n\nsurrender the fundamental protections afforded by the privilege to uphold the\n\ninterests of the Act” and holding in favor of the privilege because requestor\n\ncould obtain information from the same sources) (emphasis added); accord\n\n\n                                     21\n\fUpjohn, 449 U.S. at 396 (“considerations of convenience do not overcome the\n\npolicies served by the attorney-client privilege”). Indeed, Jenkins’ letter request\n\nindicates that she was already aware of the identities of some, if not all, of the\n\nwitnesses who could supply her with the factual information about the alleged\n\nwrongdoing in the affected City department. CR_12.\n\n      In sum, the City attorney’s communication with the interviewees was\n\nconducted for the purpose of rendering legal advice to the City, was performed\n\npursuant to City policy that all employees must cooperate fully with OIG\n\ninvestigations, was kept confidential, and concerned the subject matter for\n\nwhich the advice was sought: to receive an informed legal recommendation on\n\nthe course of action regarding the possible wrongdoing in a City department.\n\nSee, e.g., Harlandale, 25 S.W.3d at 334-35 (attorney investigating facts and\n\nmaking recommendations is functioning as an attorney for the entire\n\ncommunication); see also Dunn v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 927 F.2d 869, 875\n\n(5th Cir. 1991) (attorney who performs tasks of an investigator in the process\n\nof providing legal services is functioning as an attorney); CR_12; 14-16; 19.\n\nAccordingly, the Court should reverse and render judgment for the City that\n\nthe information at issue is protected by attorney client privilege and is not\n\nsubject to disclosure.\n\n\n\n\n                                        22\n\fIV.    The City did not waive its privilege with respect to the Information at\n       Issue.\n\n       A.     The Attorney General has no evidence and there is no indication\n              that the City disclosed the information at issue.\n\n       Although it would have been the City’s prerogative to refer a wrongdoer\n\nfor criminal prosecution if a crime was uncovered, there is no evidence that\n\neither of the interviewees in question were ever referred to law enforcement,\n\ndespite the Attorney General’s insinuation that the mere possibility of referral\n\nwaives the privilege. See CR_28 (City’s investigation was complete). The\n\nprivilege belongs to the City, as the client, and unless the City waives it, the\n\nattorney cannot be compelled to disclose matters that come within that\n\nprivilege. West v. Solito, 563 S.W.2d 240, 244 n.2 (Tex. 1978). In addition, had\n\nthe City referred the interviewees for prosecution, the exception for an ongoing\n\ncriminal investigation would have applied to bar disclosure under the TPIA.\n\nSee Tex. Gov’t Code § 552.108; CR_27-28. In sum, there is no evidence that\n\neither of the interviews at issue has ever been divulged to anyone outside the\n\nCity apart from in camera review by adjudicators as allowed by law.4\n\n4\n  The Attorney General and the reviewing courts have reviewed the documents in camera as\npermitted by law. See Marathon Oil, 893 S.W.2d at 593 (“As a reviewing court, we may\nconduct our own in camera inspection to determine whether a trial court properly applied the\nlaw of privilege to the documents.”) (citing Barnes v. Whittington, 751 S.W.2d 493, 495 (Tex.\n1988) (orig. proceeding)); see also Tex. Gov’t Code § 552.301(e)(1)(D) (providing the\nprocedure for seeking an opinion from the Attorney General on documents subject to an\nexception under the TPIA); id. § 552.3221 (allowing for in camera inspection of the\ninformation at issue).\n\n\n                                             23\n\f      B.    Making the Brooks statement available to his attorney does not\n            waive the privilege for the information at issue.\n\n      Although the Attorney General states that “[t]he underlying PIA request\n\nwas in fact made by an attorney acting on behalf of one of the employees in\n\nquestion,” CR_42 n.5, this gives an incorrect impression. Jenkins represented\n\nBrooks, but there is no indication or evidence that she represented anyone else\n\nin connection with this matter. The information at issue involves\n\ncommunications with other employees and not Brooks. See IAI at AG\n\nJenkins(Brooks)00008-14, 00024-28 (Brooks is not the witness in either\n\ninterview at issue). The City has made Brooks’ testimony available to his\n\nlawyer, and that communication is not at issue here. Id. Nor does the City’s\n\ndisclosure of Brooks’ testimony to his own lawyer operate as a waiver to the\n\nother documents—the information at issue—that have not been disclosed. See\n\nIn re Carbo Ceramics Inc., 81 S.W.3d 369, 376-77 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th\n\nDist.] 2002, orig. proceeding) (holding that the voluntary disclosure of a letter\n\n“is not an automatic blanket waiver of the privilege for all other documents\n\nwithheld on the basis of attorney-client privilege” where only the one\n\ndocument was disclosed); Marathon Oil, 893 S.W.2d at 592 (holding that the\n\nvoluntary disclosure of some documents is not “an automatic, blanket waiver\n\nof the privilege for all underlying documents” that were not disclosed); Nat’l\n\n\n\n\n                                       24\n\fUnion Fire Ins. Co. v. Hoffman, 746 S.W.2d 305, 311 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1988,\n\norig. proceeding) (trial court abused its discretion to find a blanket waiver).\n\n      Thus, although the City made Brooks’ own statement available to his\n\nlawyer, it did not permit Brooks to be privy to interviews from other employees,\n\nbecause those interviews are confidential communications. See, e.g., Texas\n\nDisciplinary Rule of Professional Conduct 1.12, cmt. 3 (providing that\n\ninterviews between a lawyer and an employee made in the course of in internal\n\ninvestigation are confidential and may not be disclosed to other employees\n\nunless permitted by the organization); IAI at AG Jenkins(Brooks)00008, 00024\n\n(indicating the confidential nature of the communication). Neither Brooks nor\n\nJenkins is entitled to the contents of the communications between City lawyers\n\nand other employees, whether or not those employees were found to have been\n\npart of the problem with the City’s program.\n\n      The interviewees whose statements are at issue gave those statements in\n\ncooperation with the OIG pursuant to City policy and at the City’s behest. IAI\n\nat AG Jenkins(Brooks)00008-14, 00024-28; CR_14-16. The information is\n\nconfidential attorney-client information when, as here, it is gleaned in the\n\ncourse of an investigation which is in furtherance of the client—the City—\n\nobtaining legal counsel about what course of action to take based on the\n\nfindings in that investigation. See Harlandale, 25 S.W.3d at 334-35; Upjohn, 449\n\n\n                                        25\n\fU.S. at 394. No waiver occurred, and thus the information at issue is protected\n\nby attorney-client privilege.\n\n\n                                Conclusion and Prayer\n\n       Because the City established that the information at issue is a\n\nconfidential communication between representatives of the client-City and the\n\nCity’s counsel for the purpose of aiding the City in obtaining legal advice, and\n\nthere is no evidence that the privilege has been waived, the Court should\n\nreverse and render judgment for the City that the remaining information at\n\nissue is not subject to disclosure.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the City respectfully requests that the Court:\n\n1) reverse the judgment of the trial court; 2) render judgment for the City that\n\nthe remaining “information at issue,” IAI at AG Jenkins(Brooks)00008-14,\n\n00024-28, is protected from disclosure by the attorney-client privilege; 3) grant\n\nthe City its costs and expenses; and 4) grant the City any other relief to which\n\nit is entitled.\n\n\n\n\n                                         26\n\f                                     Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                     DONNA L.

Mayor Parker promulgates Executive Order 1-39 Revised, establishing\n      the Office of Inspector General under the supervision of the City\n      Attorney.\n\n      On March 1, 2011, Mayor Parker approved Executive Order 1-39\n\nRevised, which established the Office of Inspector General (OIG) as a division\n\nof the Office of the City Attorney and under the City Attorney’s supervision.\n\nCR_14-18 (see section 2.1). Ms. Robin Curtis, who is a board certified Labor\n\nand Employment Law attorney, was appointed and currently serves as the\n\nCity’s Inspector General (IG). CR_19. Ms. Sandra W. Robinson is also an\n\nattorney working in the OIG in the City’s Legal Department. CR_19.\n\n      The Executive Order establishing the OIG specifically provides that the\n\nOIG has the responsibility to “[s]upply information, which information may\n\nbe protected from public disclosure as provided by law, to … Directors of City\n\nDepartments to facilitate investigations of allegations of employee misconduct\n\nand any associated disciplinary actions or enforcement of civil or criminal\n\nlaws.” CR_14-15 (Section 5.1.3). Additionally, the OIG “may consult with the\n\nCity Controller regarding allegations of employee misconduct that may expose\n\nthe City to significant financial loss.” CR_15 (Section 5.3). The Inspector\n\nGeneral “shall supervise the OIG in its investigation of fraud, corruption,\n\nwaste, mismanagement, conflicts of interest, ethics violations, discrimination\n\fand violations of state or federal law, the City Charter, City Ordinances, City\n\nCouncil Code of Conduct, Executive Orders, Administrative Procedures, or\n\nMayor’s Policies.” CR_15 (Section 5.2).\n\n\nII.    City policy as set forth in Executive Order 1-39 Revised requires all\n       City employees to cooperate fully with any OIG investigation.\n\n       The OIG City policy expressly states that “[a]ll City employees and\n\nappointed officials shall cooperate fully with any investigation conducted by\n\nthe OIG and must provide truthful information, written statements,\n\ndocuments, and related materials upon OIG’s request.” CR_16 (Section 5.7.3).\n\nFurther, the policy provides that “[a]ny City employees or appointed official\n\nwho fails to fully cooperate with any OIG investigation violates this Executive\n\nOrder and, accordingly, commits misconduct.” CR_16 (Section 5.7.4).\n\n\nIII.   A lawyer from the OIG conducts an internal investigation on behalf\n       of the City.\n\n       In early 2013, an attorney for the City working in the Office of the\n\nInspector General in the City’s Legal Department conducted an internal\n\ninvestigation into alleged wrongdoing of City employees pursuant to Office of\n\nInspector General’s Complaint #111-100288-001(HCCSC). See CR_19 (listing\n\nCity Legal Department personnel); (Information at Issue (IAI) at AG\n\nJenkins(Brooks)00008, 00024 (naming the City lawyer in the OIG who\n\n\n                                      2\n\fconducted the interviews); CR_12-13. That attorney interviewed City\n\nemployees in order to ascertain whether the allegations of wrongdoing had any\n\nfactual basis on which OIG gave legal advice about possible courses of action\n\nto the City. See, e.g., IAI at AG Jenkins(Brooks)00008-14, 00024-28; see also\n\nCR_12-13 (referring to Mr. Brooks’s pre-termination hearing). Each\n\ninterviewee initialed the preamble statement, which, among other things:\n\nexplained they were furnishing the statement voluntarily and not as a\n\ncondition of employment with the City; stressed the confidential nature of the\n\ndocument and that it not be disclosed, except to that interviewee’s individual\n\nattorney; and instructed each interviewee to provide complete information to\n\nthe OIG attorney investigator. See IAI at AG Jenkins(Brooks)00008, 00024.\n\n\nIV.   An attorney representing a Respondent employee who was\n      interviewed files a request pursuant to the Texas Public Information\n      Act (“TPIA” or “Act”) for the OIG report and supporting evidence.\n\n      On October 29, 2013, the City received a TPIA request from Ms. Stacey\n\nM. Jenkins, counsel for Mr. Willie Brooks, for records related its investigation\n\nof certain City of Houston employees, including Mr. Brooks, as a result of\n\nOIG Complaint #111-100288-001(HCCSC). CR_12-13. The City made\n\navailable certain information to Ms. Jenkins and timely requested an Attorney\n\nGeneral opinion on the remainder on November 12, 2013. CR_21-24. The\n\nCity asserted in its letter that the information at issue was not subject to\n\n                                       3\n\fdisclosure pursuant to section 552.108 of the TPIA1 and to the attorney-client\n\ncommunication privilege found in Texas Rule of Evidence 503. CR_21-24.\n\n         On February 14, 2014, the City received Open Records Letter Ruling\n\nOR2014-02684 from the Attorney General. CR_25-29. The Attorney General\n\nagreed with the City concerning most of the information that the City sought to\n\nwithhold. CR_27 (“[W]e find that you have established most of the submitted\n\ninformation is protected by attorney-client privilege.”) (citing Harlandale Indep.\n\nSch. Dist. v. Cornyn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2167229\"><a href=\"/opinion/2167229/harlandale-indep-school-dist-v-cornyn/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">328</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. App.—Austin 2000, pet. denied)).\n\nThe Attorney General opined that certain other information was not privileged\n\nand therefore subject to disclosure. CR_27. Of that information, the only\n\n“information at issue” remaining on appeal are two statements from\n\nRespondent employees who were interviewed by a lawyer in the OIG as part\n\nof the investigation into possible employee wrongdoing in a City program. See\n\nIAI at AG Jenkins(Brooks)00008-14 and AG Jenkins(Brooks)00024-28 (a\n\nportion of the “Information at Issue” submitted to the Court for in camera\n\nreview).2\n\n\n\n1\n    Tex. Gov’t Code §§ 552.001 et seq.\n2\n  Although two other documents were part of the “Information at Issue” submitted to the\ntrial court for in camera review, the City has made AG Jenkins(Brooks)00002 (a letter) and\nAG Jenkins(Brooks)00004 (a letter) available to the requestor and those are not at issue on\nappeal.\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\f      On February 24, 2014, as required by the statute to appeal, the City sued\n\nthe Attorney General pursuant to section 552.324 of the TPIA challenging the\n\nfinding in Open Records Letter Ruling OR2014-02684 that a few of the\n\ndocuments gathered in the City’s internal investigation were subject to\n\ndisclosure. CR_3-5. On cross motions for summary judgment, the trial court\n\ngranted the Attorney General’s motion, denied the City’s motion, and entered\n\njudgment that the “information at issue” is subject to disclosure. CR_109.\n\n      The City now appeals.\n\n\n                          Summary of the Argument\n\n      The information at issue in this case—two Respondent interviewee\n\nstatements by City employees taken in the course of an internal investigation\n\nby the OIG in the City Attorney’s office—is not subject to disclosure because it\n\nis protected by attorney-client privilege under Texas Rule of Evidence 503. The\n\nOIG conducted the investigation at the behest of its client, the City, and the\n\ninformation at issue is part of the OIG’s investigative report. City employees\n\nwho gave confidential statements to the City’s attorney in the OIG were acting\n\naccording to City policy of cooperating with OIG investigations. This\n\ncooperation furthered the City’s purposes of obtaining legal advice about what\n\nlegal courses of action to take regarding the allegations of wrongdoing in one\n\nof its departments that affected a City program.\n\n                                       5\n\f      There is no evidence that the City waived its privilege in this case with\n\nrespect to the information at issue and no evidence that any other exception to\n\nthe privilege applies. The privilege belongs to the City, and the City has\n\nmaintained the confidentiality of the information at issue in this case.\n\nAccordingly, the Court should reverse the trial court’s judgment and render\n\njudgment for the City that the remaining “information at issue” is protected by\n\nattorney-client privilege and is not subject to disclosure.\n\n\n                           Argument and Authorities\n\nI.

Information protected by the attorney-client privilege is not subject to\n      disclosure under the TPIA.\n\n      A.    The TPIA requires disclosure of public information unless an\n            exception applies.\n\n      The TPIA provides, “it is the policy of this state that each person is\n\nentitled, unless otherwise expressly provided by law, at all times to complete\n\ninformation about the affairs of government and the official acts of public\n\nofficials and employees.” Tex. Gov’t Code § 552.001. A completed\n\ninvestigation is considered public information under the TPIA unless it is\n\nsubject to an exception. Section 552.022 of the TPIA provides, in relevant part:\n\n      The following categories of information are public information\n      and not exempted from required disclosure under this chapter\n      unless they are expressly confidential under other law:\n\n            (1) a completed report, audit, evaluation, or investigation\n      made of, for, or by a governmental body, except as provided by\n      Section 552.108[.]\n\n                                       7\n\fTex. Gov’t Code § 552.022(a)(1).\n\n      The “information at issue” in this case consists of portions of a\n\ncompleted investigation made by the City’s OIG. Therefore, as part of a\n\ncompleted investigation, it must be released unless it is excepted from\n\ndisclosure under section 552.108 of the TPIA or is expressly confidential under\n\n“other law.” Id. For the reasons set forth below, the information at issue is\n\nconfidential by law under Texas Rule of Evidence 503.\n\n\n      B.    Texas Rules of Evidence comprise “other law” that makes\n            information “expressly confidential” and not subject to\n            disclosure under the TPIA.\n\n      While considering a similar issue, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that\n\nthe Texas Rules of Evidence are such “other law” which makes information\n\n“expressly confidential” in the context of section 552.022 of the TPIA.

CR_27.\n\n       Even though Harlandale held that all of the material that was part of the\n\nreport was privileged and could not be segregated out piecemeal, 25 S.W.3d at\n\n333-34, the Attorney General and the trial court in this case have held exactly\n\nthe opposite, contending that two interviews conducted in the course of that\n\ninvestigation and made part of the report are not privileged because those\n\nemployees were being questioned about their own conduct in addition to\n\nconduct of others in the department. CR_42. Yet, this Court’s precedent and\n\nother case law hold that the entire investigative report from an attorney’s\n\n                                       12\n\finternal investigation conducted at the behest of a corporate client is protected\n\nby attorney-client privilege, without regard to whether some of the\n\ninterviewees had committed the wrongdoing under investigation.\n\n\n      A.    The Attorney General’s piecemeal approach to the investigative\n            file is contrary to this Court’s precedent and other case law.\n\n      In Harlandale, a police sergeant who was reprimanded for inappropriate\n\nconduct had filed a formal grievance, which prompted Harlandale to hire an\n\nattorney to investigate the facts and write a report with recommendations. 25\n\nS.W.3d at 329-30. After the attorney had conducted numerous interviews and\n\nwrote a report which included her findings and recommendations, a requestor\n\nasked for the report and all of the supporting exhibits pursuant to the TPIA. Id.\n\nat 330. Harlandale timely requested an opinion letter from the AG, claiming\n\nattorney-client privilege. Id. The AG’s opinion letter in Harlandale parsed the\n\nreport for the purposes of attorney-client privilege, holding that certain sections\n\nwere “factual” and had to be disclosed while other parts could be withheld. 25\n\nS.W.3d at 330 & nn.1, 2. This Court reversed and rendered for Harlandale,\n\nexplaining that the entire report was privileged where the attorney was hired to\n\ninvestigate and give legal advice. Id. at 333-34.\n\n      Here, the Attorney General is again trying to parse an investigative\n\nreport that is covered by attorney-client privilege, recognizing that “most” of\n\n\n                                        13\n\fthe information that was part of the investigation is protected by attorney-client\n\nprivilege, but then selecting out two interviews as allegedly “not privileged”\n\nbecause the interviewees were purportedly subjects of the investigation.\n\nCR_27. But this Court has already rejected the Attorney General’s piecemeal\n\napproach to an investigative report in Harlandale. There is no basis for the\n\nAttorney General to find that parts of the report should be subject to disclosure\n\nwhile finding the rest of the investigative file to be privileged.\n\n       The United States Supreme Court’s sound reasoning in Upjohn Company\n\nv. United States is also instructive here, because the facts in Upjohn are similar to\n\nthis case and because the Texas attorney-client privilege standard is similar to\n\nthe federal standard.3 </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110374\"><a href=\"/opinion/110374/upjohn-co-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

The investigation in Upjohn, as here, involved queries of lower-\n\nlevel employees who were close enough to the actual events that their input as\n\ninterviewees was invaluable to enable counsel to give Upjohn the legal advice\n\nto know how to proceed to rectify its situation. Id. at 391; IAI at AG\n\nJenkins(Brooks)00008-14, 00024-28. When the Internal Revenue Service\n\nsought those interviews and questionnaires in a subsequent enforcement\n\naction, the Court held that the interviews and questionnaires of employees—\n\nregardless of whether they were lower level employees or part of a “control\n\ngroup”—were protected by attorney client privilege. Upjohn, 449 U.S. at 391-\n\n92, 395.\n\n      The Attorney General’s distinction that some of the interviewees were\n\n“targets” of the investigation lacks merit, because nothing in Upjohn suggests\n\nthat the Court made a distinction between interviews and questionnaires from\n\nthe actual employees responsible for the “questionable payments” and those in\n\nthe company who were not making the “possibly illegal” payoffs. In fact,\n\nimplicit in the Supreme Court’s holding is that the very people who were most\n\nhelpful to interview were those at the center of, and even perpetrating, the\n\nmisconduct. See id. at 391 (commenting that lower-level employees by their\n\nactions in the scope of their employment can “embroil” the corporation into\n\nlegal difficulties and therefore their information is highly relevant and helpful).\n\n\n                                        15\n\f      In re USA Waste Management Resources, L.L.C. is also helpful here. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2012, orig. proceeding).\n\nDefendant Waste Management sought protection from the disclosure of a\n\ncommunication between its counsel and a former employee, Royda Jennings\n\n(Jennings). Id. at 95. Jennings was terminated after she was deposed in a third\n\nparty case because her testimony contradicted information she gave to Waste\n\nManagement in the course of that investigation. Id. Jennings sought to\n\nintroduce   an   affidavit   divulging    the   conversation   between   Waste\n\nManagement’s counsel and Jennings in preparation for her deposition. Id. On\n\nmandamus to prevent the court-ordered disclosure, the appellate court\n\ndetermined that the communication was privileged and not subject to\n\ndisclosure because: 1) the communication was made at the direction of a\n\nsupervisor in the corporation; and 2) the subject matter upon which the\n\nattorney’s advice was sought is the performance by the employee of the\n\nemployee’s duties of her employment. Id. at 96, 97-98. The court reasoned that\n\nbecause Waste Management had a policy in place requiring full cooperation\n\nwith investigations into workplace violence, and because Waste Management\n\ntook steps to ensure that the conversation remained confidential, Waste\n\nManagement had met its burden that the communication between Waste\n\nManagement’s counsel and Jennings was privileged.

The interviewees cooperated with the\n\ninvestigation pursuant to City policy of full cooperation with OIG\n\ninvestigations. AG Jenkins(Brooks)00008, 00024 at ¶ 3; CR_16. As part of the\n\ninternal investigation, the interviews are privileged regardless of whether the\n\ninterviewees’ conduct was a subject of the communication. See Valero, 973\n\nS.W.2d at 457 (the content of the communication does not matter for purposes\n\nof the attorney-client privilege).\n\n      Furthermore, the entire investigative report—including the factual\n\ninterviews—was protected by the attorney-client privilege in Harlandale. 25\n\nS.W.3d at 333. All of the interviews and questionnaires in Upjohn were\n\nprotected by the privilege, 449 U.S. at 395, and all of the substance of the\n\ninterview with Jennings was protected in Waste Management. 387 S.W.3d at 98.\n\nAccordingly, the interviews at issue were part of the City’s internal\n\ninvestigation and are privileged, just like the interviews in Harlandale, Upjohn,\n\nand Waste Management.\n\n\n\n\n                                       17\n\f      B.    The parties involved in each communication at issue are\n            identified on the face of the documents in question as being an\n            attorney for the City and a City employee.\n\n      The information at issue identifies OIG attorney Sandra W. Robinson as\n\nbeing from the “Office of Inspector General,” and the personnel sheet lists her\n\nas working in the Legal Department. AG Jenkins(Brooks)00008, 00024 at ¶ 3;\n\nCR_19. In both statements at issue, the affiants state that they are employed by\n\nthe City and provide their employee numbers. AG Jenkins(Brooks)00008,\n\n00024 at ¶ 2. Accordingly, the documents identify the parties as a lawyer for\n\nthe City and a City employee, and instruct that the employee is to cooperate\n\nfully in the investigation and keep the communication confidential. Id.\n\n\n      C.    Counsel for the City conducted the internal investigation in\n            order to give advice to the City as the client.\n\n      Just as outside counsel in Harlandale and in-house counsel in Upjohn and\n\nWaste Management were tasked with conducting internal investigations and\n\nrecommending legal courses of action for their corporate clients, the attorneys\n\nin the OIG are the City’s attorneys tasked with investigating and reporting\n\nfacts and recommending a legal course of action for the City.

Like the attorney in Harlandale, the OIG compiled a report\n\nafter conducting interviews with several employees, and the “Information at\n\n\n                                      18\n\fIssue” in this case was used in that report. 25 S.W.3d at 330; CR_22, IAI at\n\nAG Jenkins(Brooks)00008-14, 00024-28. Like the in-house attorneys in Upjohn\n\nand Waste Management, the information gleaned from the internal investigation\n\nhere enabled OIG attorneys Sandra W. Robinson and Inspector General\n\nRobin Curtis to render legal advice regarding personnel issues and\n\ndepartmental guidance. CR_14-16, 19.\n\n\n      D.    The communication is and has remained confidential.\n\n      Like Waste Management and Upjohn, the City took steps to ensure and\n\nmaintain the confidentiality of the communications. Waste Management, 387\n\nS.W.3d at 97; Upjohn, 449 U.S. at 395; IAI at AG Jenkins(Brooks)00008,\n\n00024) (instructing interviewees that the statements are confidential and\n\nexpressly prohibiting copying or distribution of same). The City admonished\n\neach interviewee not to discuss the investigation with anyone except that\n\nperson’s lawyer, and threatened prosecution if any non-employees (i.e.,\n\nJenkins or others) disseminated the document illegally. IAI at AG\n\nJenkins(Brooks)00008, 00024. There is no indication or evidence that any third\n\nparties were present during the communication or that Jenkins represented\n\neither interviewee whose statements are at issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                       19\n\f      E.    The communication was made at the direction of the City and\n            pursuant to the City’s policy of full employee cooperation with\n            the OIG.\n\n      As mentioned above, both of the interviews at issue were between an\n\nattorney for the City and a City employee interviewed at the behest of the\n\nclient-City. IAI at AG Jenkins(Brooks)00008, 00024. City policy requires all of\n\nits employees to cooperate with an OIG investigation; failure to do so is\n\nconsidered employee misconduct. CR_16. The interviewees were summoned\n\nby the OIG to give statements about their everyday work procedures and were\n\nquestioned about documentation protocols for a program run by the City\n\ndepartment in which they worked. IAI at AG Jenkins(Brooks)00009-14,\n\n00025-28. While it is true that the boilerplate preamble to the statement states\n\nthat the individual interviewees were furnishing voluntary statements not as a\n\ncondition of employment, each interviewee was expected, as part of their duty\n\nas City employees, to cooperate fully with the investigation. CR_16; IAI at AG\n\nJenkins(Brooks)00008, 00024. Indeed, the employees were specifically\n\ninstructed to give full information about the situation to the OIG. IAI at AG\n\nJenkins(Brooks)00008,    00024.   The        employees’   cooperation   with   the\n\ninvestigation furthered the City’s purposes to obtain legal advice about the\n\nprudent course of action regarding alleged wrongdoing in a City department.\n\nCR 9, 12; IAI at AG Jenkins(Brooks)00008, 00024.\n\n\n                                        20\n\f     Additionally, cooperating with the OIG investigation is part of the\n\nsubject matter of each employee’s job. CR_14-16, 19, IAI at AG\n\nJenkins(Brooks)00008-14, 00024-28. The interviews themselves concerned the\n\nsubject matter of the employee’s employment, with the questions relating to\n\nday-to-day procedures and protocols used by each employee and a recounting\n\nof what happened on the job on key days in question. IAI at AG\n\nJenkins(Brooks)00008-14, 00024-28. These interviews aided the OIG in\n\nobtaining a picture of what happened so that it could recommend a legal\n\ncourse of action to help the City program. AI at AG Jenkins(Brooks)00008-14,\n\n00024-28.\n\n\n     F.     The factual information Jenkins seeks is available through other\n            means.\n\n     Additionally, like those seeking the protected material in Harlandale and\n\nUpjohn, nothing prevents Jenkins from seeking out the individual employees to\n\ngather her own set of facts about what occurred in the department. See\n\nHarlandale, 25 S.W.3d at 335 (stating that “[i]n weighing these competing\n\nconcerns [between the TPIA and attorney-client privilege], we need not\n\nsurrender the fundamental protections afforded by the privilege to uphold the\n\ninterests of the Act” and holding in favor of the privilege because requestor\n\ncould obtain information from the same sources) (emphasis added); accord\n\n\n                                     21\n\fUpjohn, 449 U.S. at 396 (“considerations of convenience do not overcome the\n\npolicies served by the attorney-client privilege”). Indeed, Jenkins’ letter request\n\nindicates that she was already aware of the identities of some, if not all, of the\n\nwitnesses who could supply her with the factual information about the alleged\n\nwrongdoing in the affected City department. CR_12.\n\n      In sum, the City attorney’s communication with the interviewees was\n\nconducted for the purpose of rendering legal advice to the City, was performed\n\npursuant to City policy that all employees must cooperate fully with OIG\n\ninvestigations, was kept confidential, and concerned the subject matter for\n\nwhich the advice was sought: to receive an informed legal recommendation on\n\nthe course of action regarding the possible wrongdoing in a City department.\n\nSee, e.g., Harlandale, 25 S.W.3d at 334-35 (attorney investigating facts and\n\nmaking recommendations is functioning as an attorney for the entire\n\ncommunication); see also Dunn v.

Making the Brooks statement available to his attorney does not\n            waive the privilege for the information at issue.\n\n      Although the Attorney General states that “[t]he underlying PIA request\n\nwas in fact made by an attorney acting on behalf of one of the employees in\n\nquestion,” CR_42 n.5, this gives an incorrect impression. Jenkins represented\n\nBrooks, but there is no indication or evidence that she represented anyone else\n\nin connection with this matter. The information at issue involves\n\ncommunications with other employees and not Brooks. See IAI at AG\n\nJenkins(Brooks)00008-14, 00024-28 (Brooks is not the witness in either\n\ninterview at issue). The City has made Brooks’ testimony available to his\n\nlawyer, and that communication is not at issue here. Id. Nor does the City’s\n\ndisclosure of Brooks’ testimony to his own lawyer operate as a waiver to the\n\nother documents—the information at issue—that have not been disclosed.

See, e.g., Texas\n\nDisciplinary Rule of Professional Conduct 1.12, cmt. 3 (providing that\n\ninterviews between a lawyer and an employee made in the course of in internal\n\ninvestigation are confidential and may not be disclosed to other employees\n\nunless permitted by the organization); IAI at AG Jenkins(Brooks)00008, 00024\n\n(indicating the confidential nature of the communication). Neither Brooks nor\n\nJenkins is entitled to the contents of the communications between City lawyers\n\nand other employees, whether or not those employees were found to have been\n\npart of the problem with the City’s program.\n\n      The interviewees whose statements are at issue gave those statements in\n\ncooperation with the OIG pursuant to City policy and at the City’s behest. IAI\n\nat AG Jenkins(Brooks)00008-14, 00024-28; CR_14-16. The information is\n\nconfidential attorney-client information when, as here, it is gleaned in the\n\ncourse of an investigation which is in furtherance of the client—the City—\n\nobtaining legal counsel about what course of action to take based on the\n\nfindings in that investigation. See Harlandale, 25 S.W.3d at 334-35; Upjohn, 449\n\n\n                                        25\n\fU.S. at 394. No waiver occurred, and thus the information at issue is protected\n\nby attorney-client privilege.\n\n\n                                Conclusion and Prayer\n\n       Because the City established that the information at issue is a\n\nconfidential communication between representatives of the client-City and the\n\nCity’s counsel for the purpose of aiding the City in obtaining legal advice, and\n\nthere is no evidence that the privilege has been waived, the Court should\n\nreverse and render judgment for the City that the remaining information at\n\nissue is not subject to disclosure.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the City respectfully requests that the Court:\n\n1) reverse the judgment of the trial court; 2) render judgment for the City that\n\nthe remaining “information at issue,” IAI at AG Jenkins(Brooks)00008-14,\n\n00024-28, is protected from disclosure by the attorney-client privilege; 3) grant\n\nthe City its costs and expenses; and 4) grant the City any other relief to which\n\nit is entitled.\n\n\n\n\n                                         26\n\f                                     Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                     DONNA L.
