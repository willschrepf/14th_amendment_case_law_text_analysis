McCarthy & Associates, P.L.L.C.\n By Kathleen A. McCarthy and Scott Lieberman                                  Tucson\n                                                  Attorneys for Real Party in Interest\n\fP E L A N D E R, Chief Judge.\n\n\n¶1            At issue in this special action, which arises from a dissolution of marriage\n\naction, is the scope of discovery permitted of an expert accountant retained in anticipation\n\nof litigation who was initially listed as a witness and who testified about matters pendente\n\nlite but was withdrawn as a witness before trial. Petitioner Lisa Frank Green contends the\n\nrespondent judge abused her discretion when she granted real party in interest James Green’s\n\nmotion to compel production of the expert’s “entire file pertaining to Lisa and/or James\n\nGreen and/or Lisa Frank Inc.” In the context of the specific facts of this case, we agree.\n\nAccordingly, we accept jurisdiction of the special action and grant relief by vacating the\n\nrespondent judge’s discovery order.\n\n                                        Background\n\n¶2            The discovery dispute arose after a pre-decree hearing was convened to address\n\nthe parties’ possession of liquid assets pendente lite. Lisa had called Byron Fox, a financial\n\nconsultant, to testify at the hearing on March 24, 2006, and designated him as an expert\n\nwitness for trial while the continued hearing was still pending. On March 28, James\n\nsubpoenaed Fox’s entire file relating to the parties and Lisa Frank Inc., to be produced at\n\nthe continued hearing on March 31. Lisa objected to the subpoena.\n\n¶3            On March 31, Fox sent a letter to James’s counsel objecting to the requested\n\nproduction and did not produce any materials when he appeared at the scheduled hearing\n\n\n                                              2\n\fthat day. After Lisa’s counsel complained that she had been given inadequate time to brief\n\nher objection to the subpoena, the respondent judge delayed ruling on production of the file\n\npending further briefing. At the respondent’s suggestion, James cross-examined Fox that day\n\nand reserved the right to recall him if the court later ordered disclosures pursuant to the\n\nsubpoena.\n\n¶4            Sometime after that hearing, Lisa produced only those portions of Fox’s file\n\nshe believed to be related to the subject matter of his testimony at the hearing and expected\n\ntestimony at trial. Lisa also moved to modify James’s subpoena to limit the scope of\n\nproduction to those documents related to the subject of Fox’s testimony.1 James opposed\n\nthat motion and on May 23 moved to compel the production of all documents requested in\n\nhis subpoena. The two motions were set for hearing on June 27. Before that hearing was\n\nheld, however, two critical events occurred: (1) on May 26, the respondent judge approved\n\na stipulation of the parties that resolved the distribution of liquid assets pendente lite and\n\n\n\n\n       1\n        In her petition, Lisa cites Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission v. Fields,\n206 Ariz. 130, 75 P.3d 1088 (App. 2003), and Slade v. Schneider, 212 Ariz. 176, 129 P.3d\n465 (App. 2006), in support of her argument that the required production was limited to\nthose documents related to the subject of Fox’s testimony. Although James does not\ndispute the standard applied in those cases, he maintains that it allows for broad discovery\nof experts. James also complains that file documents that were not voluntarily disclosed\nwere not indexed in a privilege log or subjected to in-camera review. Lisa contends the\nrespondent judge was offered an opportunity to review in camera the documents withheld\nfrom production but declined to do so. In any event, in view of our disposition on the\nmerits, we do not address these collateral issues.\n\n                                              3\n\fvacated all further hearings on that issue, and (2) on June 6, Lisa withdrew her designation\n\nof Fox as a trial witness.\n\n¶5            After the June 27 hearing on the parties’ discovery dispute, the respondent\n\njudge concluded that Lisa,\n\n              by calling Mr. Fox as a witness to testify in preliminary matters\n              not only as to facts, but also by giving opinion testimony, ha[d]\n              waived any privilege that may have existed regarding Mr. Fox as\n              a consulting expert with respect to the issues before this court,\n              regardless of whether Mr. Fox has testified to the issues to date\n              or not.\n\nThe respondent judge then compelled disclosure of Fox’s files, in their entirety, as requested\n\nin James’s subpoena. This petition for special action followed.\n\n                                        Jurisdiction\n\n¶6            Although we do not “routinely entertain petitions for extraordinary relief on\n\ndiscovery matters,” Jolly v. Superior Court, 112 Ariz. 186, 188, 540 P.2d 658, 660 (1975),\n\nspecial action jurisdiction may be appropriate because a discovery order is not appealable.\n\nSee Ariz. R. P. Spec. Actions 1(a), 17B A.R.S.; A.R.S. § 12-2101; Michael Weller, Inc. v.\n\nAetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 126 Ariz. 323, 327, 614 P.2d 865, 869 (App. 1980). Moreover, a\n\nspecial action “‘is the proper means to seek relief’” when a party believes a trial court has\n\nordered disclosure of material protected by a privilege or work product shield. Emergency\n\nCare Dynamics, Ltd. v. Superior Court, 188 Ariz. 32, 33, 932 P.2d 297, 298 (App. 1997)\n\n(work product immunity), quoting Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. Superior\n\nCourt, 159 Ariz. 24, 25-26, 764 P.2d 759, 760-61 (App. 1988) (clergy-penitent privilege);\n\n                                              4\n\fsee also Yuma Reg’l Med. Ctr. v. Superior Court, 175 Ariz. 72, 74, 852 P.2d 1256, 1258\n\n(App. 1993) (peer review privilege). Special action jurisdiction also is appropriate when the\n\nissue involves interpretation or application of civil procedure rules, see Jones v. Buchanan,\n\n177 Ariz. 410, 411, 868 P.2d 993, 994 (App. 1993), and when the respondent judge’s\n\nalleged abuse of discretion concerns “a pure issue of law that may be decided without\n\nfurther factual inquiry.” Winner Enterprises, Ltd. v. Superior Court, 159 Ariz. 106, 108,\n\n765 P.2d 116, 118 (App. 1988) (motion to intervene pursuant to Rule 24, Ariz. R. Civ. P.,\n\n16 A.R.S., Pt. 1). Finally, this special action presents issues of first impression, further\n\nwarranting acceptance of jurisdiction. E.g., Callan v. Bernini, No. 2 CA-SA 2005-0085,\n\n¶ 4, 2006 WL 711117, *1 (Ariz. Ct. App. Mar. 22, 2006). For all these reasons, we accept\n\njurisdiction of this special action.\n\n                                        Discussion\n\n¶7            A trial court has broad discretion in resolving discovery disputes. Brown v.\n\nSuperior Court, 137 Ariz. 327, 331, 670 P.2d 725, 729 (1983). “But when a judge\n\ncommits an ‘error of law . . . in the process of reaching [a] discretionary conclusion,’ [s]he\n\nmay be regarded as having abused [her] discretion.” Twin City Fire Ins. Co. v. Burke, 204\n\nAriz. 251, ¶ 10, 63 P.3d 282, 285 (2003), quoting Grant v. Ariz. Pub. Serv. Co., 133 Ariz.\n\n434, 456, 652 P.2d 507, 529 (1982) (first two alterations in Twin City). Rule 26(b)(4)(A),\n\nAriz. R. Civ. P., 16 A.R.S., Pt. 1, permits discovery as a matter of course from “any person\n\nwho has been identified as an expert whose opinions may be presented at trial.” But Rule\n\n\n                                              5\n\f26(b)(4) also “distinguishes sharply between testimonial and consulting experts.”\n\nEmergency Care Dynamics, 188 Ariz. at 36, 932 P.2d at 301; compare Ariz. R. Civ. P.\n\n26(b)(4)(A) and 26(b)(4)(B). Thus, although “Arizona authorities have granted expansive\n\nscope for . . . pretrial discovery from expert witnesses,” and that scope encompasses\n\ndiscovery related to “the expert’s relations with the hiring party and its counsel,” discovery\n\nfrom consulting experts is prohibited “except ‘upon a showing of exceptional\n\ncircumstances.’” Emergency Care Dynamics, 188 Ariz. at 35-36, 932 P.2d at 300-01,\n\nquoting Ariz. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4)(B); see also State ex rel. Miller v. Superior Court, 154\n\nAriz. 363, 364-65, 742 P.2d 864, 865-66 (App. 1987).\n\n¶8            In Emergency Care Dynamics, Division One of this court addressed the\n\ndiscovery available when an expert has been retained as both a consultant and an expert\n\nwitness and held that a party waives the work product protection ordinarily afforded the\n\nwork of a consulting expert when the party designates that expert to testify at trial. 188\n\nAriz. at 36, 932 P.2d at 301. As that court explained: “An expert may be either a witness\n\nor a protected consultant, but not both. ‘Counsel must choose.’” Id., quoting Furniture\n\nWorld, Inc. v. D.A.V. Thrift Stores, Inc., 168 F.R.D. 61, 63 (D.N.M. 1996).\n\n¶9            In further construing the rule it had announced in Emergency Care Dynamics,\n\nDivision One has stated that “a party who has named a consultant as an expert can reinstate\n\nthe [work product shield] by removing that designation before expert opinion evidence is\n\noffered through production of a report, responses to discovery, or expert testimony.” Ariz.\n\n\n                                              6\n\fMinority Coal. for Fair Redistricting v. Ariz. Indep. Redistricting Comm’n, 211 Ariz.\n\n337, ¶ 83, 121 P.3d 843, 865 (App. 2005). As Division One said in Arizona Minority\n\nCoalition:\n\n              [O]nce an expert witness is redesignated, the opposing party is\n              strictly limited to disclosure related to the new designation.\n              See, e.g., Mantolete v. Bolger, 96 F.R.D. 179, 182 ([D. Ariz.]\n              1982). In Mantolete, the court reasoned that when a defendant\n              changed its expert’s designation from “testifying expert” to\n              “non-testifying” expert under Rule 26(b)(4) of the Federal\n              Rules of Civil Procedure, discovery by plaintiff was limited to\n              the restrictions set forth for non-testifying experts. Id. The\n              court rejected the plaintiff’s argument that the redesignation of\n              the witness was simply a way to avoid discovery and thus a\n              gross abuse of the federal rules. Id. at 182 n.2. Instead, the\n              court opined that the “defendant is permitted to execute the\n              trial strategy it deems appropriate to defend its case; this\n              extends to changing the status of an expert, which thereby\n              narrows the scope of discovery.” Id.\n\n211 Ariz. 337, ¶ 84, 121 P.3d at 865.\n\n¶10           Although Arizona Minority Coalition found reinstatement of work product\n\nprotection occurs when a witness designation is withdrawn “before expert opinion evidence\n\nis offered,” id. ¶ 83, the court there was not required to address the issue raised here:\n\nWhether the work product protection associated with an expert consultant may be restored\n\nby withdrawing an expert’s witness designation after that expert has testified for a limited\n\npurpose during a pretrial hearing and after the parties have resolved by stipulation the matter\n\non which the expert previously testified. Thus, we address this issue as a matter of first\n\nimpression.\n\n\n                                              7\n\f¶11           First, we concur with Division One that the “mere . . . designation” of an\n\nexpert witness does not create “a permanent waiver of [work product protection] that\n\n[can]not be revoked.”2 Id. ¶ 82. As one federal court construing the identical provisions of\n\nRule 26, Fed. R. Civ. P., has explained:\n\n              Rule 26(b)(4)(B) is designed to promote fairness by preventing\n              access to another party’s diligent trial preparation. In contrast,\n              Rule 26(b)(4)(A) is designed to allow the opposing party an\n              opportunity to adequately prepare for cross-examination at trial,\n              a concern that does not exist when the expert will not be called\n              at trial. Thus, fairness requires that Rule 26(b)(4)(B)’s\n              protections apply to a consulting expert who will not be called\n              to testify at trial, regardless of whether the party who retained\n              the expert at one time had intended to call the expert to testify.\n\nEmployer’s Reinsurance Corp. v. Clarendon Nat’l Ins. Co., 213 F.R.D. 422, 426 (D. Kan.\n\n2003).3 Restoring the work product protection of Rule 26(b)(4)(B) appears to be the\n\nmajority approach in these cases, even when the expert’s witness designation is withdrawn\n\n\n       2\n         Although Arizona Minority Coalition refers to a waiver of the legislative privilege\nat issue in that case, its analysis is based on Rule 26(b)(4), Ariz. R. Civ. P., 16 A.R.S., Pt.\n1, the same rule we consider here. Ariz. Minority Coal. for Fair Redistricting v. Ariz.\nIndep. Redistricting Comm’n, 211 Ariz. 337, ¶¶ 82-85, 121 P.3d 843, 855 (App. 2005).\nAs Division One has since explained: “In Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission\nv. Fields, 206 Ariz. 130, 75 P.3d 1088 (App. 2003), this court determined that the\nlegislative privilege, like the work-product immunity, may be waived by designating a\nconsulting expert as a testifying expert.” Slade v. Schneider, 212 Ariz. 176, ¶ 22, 129 P.3d\n465, 469 (App. 2006).\n       3\n        Federal cases addressing Rule 26(b)(4) are persuasive, as “uniformity in\ninterpretation of our rules and the federal rules is highly desirable.” Orme Sch. v. Reeves,\n166 Ariz. 301, 304, 802 P.2d 1000, 1003 (Ariz. 1990); see also Ariz. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4)\n1970 State Bar Committee Note (noting drafting committee’s “strong desire to maintain\nsubstantial uniformity between the State and Federal Rules”).\n\n                                              8\n\fafter his or her opinions have been disclosed. See FMC Corp. v. Vendo Co., 196 F. Supp.\n\n2d 1023, 1046 (E.D. Cal. 2002); see also Employer’s Reinsurance Corp., 213 F.R.D. at\n\n426 n.11 (collecting authorities).4\n\n¶12           We have found no authority specifically addressing whether an expert’s\n\nimmunity from discovery may be restored when the redesignation to nonwitness status\n\noccurs after the expert has testified at a pretrial motion hearing on issues subsequently\n\nresolved by stipulation. Under the unusual circumstances of this case, and guided by the\n\nplain language of Rule 26(b)(4) and the policies it embodies, we conclude that James is not\n\n\n\n\n       4\n        House v. Combined Insurance Co. of America, 168 F.R.D. 236, 245-46 (N.D. Iowa\n1996), is the case most often cited for a court’s declining to apply Rule 26(b)(4)(B)’s\n“exceptional circumstances” test when an expert witness designation had been withdrawn.\nHouse involved a plaintiff’s interest in discovery from and testimony by an expert who had\nconducted an independent psychological examination pursuant to Rule 35, Fed. R. Civ. P.,\nand was later withdrawn as an expert. 168 F.R.D. at 238-39. The court held that, although\nthe plaintiff was no longer “entitled” to discovery pursuant to Rule 26(b)(4)(A), her access\nto the expert should be based on a discretionary “balancing of probative value against\nprejudice under Fed. R. Evid. 403.” 168 F.R.D. at 246. In House, the court inquired about\nthe correct application of Rule 26(b)(4) when “a Rule 35 medical examination has\noccurred” and noted the “kind of reliance” created by “submission to a medical examination\nby the designated expert.” 168 F.R.D. at 246. House has been distinguished on its facts and\nfound inapplicable in other contexts. See FMC Corp., 196 F. Supp. 2d at 1046; see also\nLehan v. Ambassador Programs, Inc., 190 F.R.D. 670, 672 (E.D. Wash. 2000) (declining\nto follow House; “exceptional circumstances” test applied to Rule 35 expert withdrawn as\nwitness).\n\n                                             9\n\fentitled to additional discovery of Fox’s file, absent the showing and finding of exceptional\n\ncircumstances required by Rule 26(b)(4)(B).5\n\n¶13            Under Rule 26(b)(4), a party is entitled to discovery from any person identified\n\nas an expert “whose opinions will be presented at trial,” Rule 26(b)(4)(A), but must show\n\nexceptional circumstances to conduct discovery of an expert “who is not expected to be\n\ncalled as a witness at trial.” Ariz. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4)(B). In this case, Fox’s testimony might\n\nhave been relevant to the distribution of assets pendente lite when discovery was first sought,\n\nbut that issue was rendered moot when James and Lisa reached a stipulated resolution,\n\nwhich the respondent judge approved, of those matters. Any interest James might have had\n\nin preparing to cross-examine Fox at a continued hearing was similarly extinguished by the\n\nstipulation; the parties agreed that the continued hearing would be vacated.6\n\n       5\n        Rule 26(b)(4)(B) permits discovery from specially retained, nontrial experts only\nupon a showing of “exceptional circumstances under which it is impracticable for the party\nseeking discovery to obtain facts or opinions on the same subject by other means.” Such\ncircumstances “may exist where 1) the object or condition at issue is destroyed or has\ndeteriorated after the non-testifying expert observes it but before the moving party’s expert\nhas an opportunity to observe it; or 2) there are no other available experts in the same field\nor subject area.” FMC Corp. v. Vendo Co., 196 F. Supp. 2d 1023, 1046 (E.D. Cal. 2002);\nsee also State ex rel. Miller v. Superior Court, 154 Ariz. 363, 364, 742 P.2d 864, 865\n(App. 1987) (discovery of nonwitness appraiser precluded; property owner failed to\nestablish that it was “impracticable to conduct discovery by other means”); cf. State ex rel.\nCorbin v. Ybarra, 161 Ariz. 188, 194, 777 P.2d 686, 692 (1989) (hazardous chemical\nreport prepared by expert consultant in criminal case protected by work product immunity\nwhere soil samples were available to both parties; Rule 26(b)(4)(B) cited by analogy).\n       6\n        We are thus not persuaded by James’s argument that his counsel “had not concluded\nher cross-examination before the end of the adjourned hearing” and that, because his “right\nof cross-examination of Mr. Fox is broad, . . . [Fox’s] entire file . . . is subject to discovery.”\nBy stipulation, James has waived his right to any further cross-examination of Fox.\n\n                                                10\n\f¶14           In addition, by the time the respondent judge entered her order granting\n\nJames’s motion to compel discovery, Fox had been withdrawn as a witness. The judge\n\nultimately did not rely on Fox’s testimony to resolve any material issue in the underlying\n\ncase, and Fox will not testify again at trial or otherwise. Because James has no need to\n\nprepare for cross-examination of Fox, “there is no reason to disregard Rule 26(b)(4)(B),”\n\nMantolete, 96 F.R.D. at 182 n.2, and the relevant inquiry is whether James can establish the\n\nexceptional circumstances required to justify discovery of a consulting expert’s files.\n\n¶15           We are influenced in our decision by the fact that neither Fox’s prior testimony\n\nnor the stipulated distribution of assets pendente lite will have any bearing on the final\n\nresolution of any issue at trial. See A.R.S. § 25-315(F)(1) and (3) (a temporary order in a\n\ndissolution proceeding “does not prejudice the rights of the parties . . . which are to be\n\nadjudicated at the subsequent hearings in the proceeding” and “terminates when the final\n\ndecree is entered or when the petition for dissolution . . . is dismissed”). The value of assets\n\nand distribution of property will be considered anew before a final decree is issued. By\n\nwithdrawing her designation of Fox as a witness, Lisa has waived her right to offer Fox’s\n\nopinions in any further proceeding.\n\n¶16           At oral argument in this court, James relied on CP Kelco U.S. Inc. v.\n\nPharmacia Corp., 213 F.R.D. 176 (D. Del. 2003), to support his assertion that Lisa could\n\nnot reinstate Fox’s protection from discovery by withdrawing him as a witness after he had\n\ntestified and expressed his opinions. In that case, Kelco had begun the deposition of\n\n\n                                              11\n\fPharmacia’s designated expert witness on Kelco’s environmental claim when it learned that\n\nnot all documents reviewed by the expert had been disclosed. Id. at 177. Kelco continued\n\nthe deposition and moved to compel production of the documents, and Pharmacia opposed\n\nthe motion based on attorney-client privilege. Id. at 178. While Kelco’s motion to compel\n\nproduction was pending, Pharmacia withdrew the expert from its witness list. Id. The\n\ndistrict court ruled that disclosure was required, despite Pharmacia’s redesignation of its\n\nexpert, for the following reasons: (1) the court’s conclusion that “the privilege once waived\n\ncannot be regained”; (2) the expert disclosures might have been relevant to something other\n\nthan the expert’s testimony; and (3) the environmental claim was still pending in the action.\n\nId. at 178-79.\n\n¶17              The first prong of the court’s ruling in Kelco, however, is incompatible with\n\nArizona law. As noted earlier, although an Arizona litigant waives the Rule 26(b)(4)(B)\n\nprotection afforded to an expert consultant once that expert is identified as a witness, that\n\nwaiver is not necessarily irrevocable. See Ariz. Minority Coal., 211 Ariz. 337, ¶¶ 82-85,\n\n121 P.3d at 865. And, although Arizona recognizes that Rule 26(b)(4)(A) provides an\n\n“expansive scope for pretrial discovery from expert witnesses” in support of “free-ranging,\n\nskeptical cross-examination,” Emergency Care Dynamics, 188 Ariz. at 36, 932 P.2d at 301,\n\nthe scope of disclosure, even as to expert witnesses, is limited to documents “‘relating to the\n\nsubject of the expert’s testimony.’” Slade v. Schneider, 212 Ariz. 176, ¶¶ 23-24, 129 P.3d\n\n\n\n\n                                               12\n\f465, 469 (App. 2006), quoting Ariz. Indep. Redistricting Comm’n v. Fields, 206 Ariz. 130,\n\n¶ 50, 75 P.3d 1088, 1103 (App. 2003).\n\n¶18           Accordingly, under the circumstances presented here, we reject Kelco’s\n\nsuggestion that further disclosure is required to permit discovery of information that, though\n\nunrelated to the prior expert testimony, might be relevant in some other way. Rule\n\n26(b)(4)(A), like other discovery rules, is not meant to be used for “‘wild fishing\n\nexpeditions.’” State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court, 167 Ariz. 135, 138, 804\n\nP.2d 1323, 1326 (App. 1991), quoting Comm’n on the Courts, Report on the Task Force\n\non Court Productivity 66 (1989); cf. State v. Hatton, 116 Ariz. 142, 150, 568 P.2d 1040,\n\n1048 (1977). Most important, in contrast to the situation in Kelco, the subject matter of\n\nFox’s testimony—the distribution of assets pendente lite—does not remain an issue in this\n\ncase because the parties have stipulated to its resolution. And Lisa’s counsel has avowed\n\nthat Fox’s opinion testimony will not be used for any other purpose in this case, at trial or\n\notherwise.7 In sum, we do not find Kelco persuasive or applicable to the situation presented\n\nhere.\n\n\n\n\n        Given that avowal, we find unpersuasive James’s assertions at oral argument that\n        7\n\nFox’s prior testimony touched on some still-pending issues and might later be used or relied\non by Lisa’s new expert or the trial court in future rulings. Any issues relating to Fox’s\ntestimony that might arise in the future are not before us and are based on sheer conjecture.\nIn addition, the limited record before us neither includes Fox’s testimony nor otherwise\nsupports James’s speculative concerns.\n\n                                             13\n\f¶19           The respondent judge, like the trial court in Arizona Minority Coalition,\n\n“misinterpreted the impact” of Lisa’s original designation of Fox as a witness and her later\n\nwithdrawal of that designation. 211 Ariz. 337, ¶ 82, 121 P.3d at 865. Our holding is\n\nlimited to the facts before us, and we do not suggest that work product protection may\n\nalways be restored by withdrawing a witness designation, even after an expert has testified\n\nabout preliminary matters. We recognize that the subjects of pretrial testimony might not\n\nalways be as readily segregated from trial issues as they are here. In this case, in which Fox’s\n\nonly testimony related to an allocation of certain liquid assets and expenses pendente lite\n\nthat was ultimately resolved by a stipulation of the parties, the respondent judge abused her\n\ndiscretion in ruling that Lisa had irrevocably “waived any privilege that may have existed”\n\nin her consultations with Fox “with respect to the issues before [the] Court, regardless of\n\nwhether Mr. Fox has testified to the issues to date or not.”\n\n¶20           Because we hold that the respondent judge erred in granting James’s motion\n\nto compel production of additional documents, we need not reach the issue of whether the\n\nsubpoena’s scope should have been limited to those documents already voluntarily\n\ndisclosed. We grant special action relief and vacate the respondent judge’s order of June 27,\n\n2006.\n\n\n\n                                               ____________________________________\n                                               JOHN PELANDER, Chief Judge\n\nCONCURRING:\n\n                                              14\n\f____________________________________\nJOSEPH W.

Petitioner Lisa Frank Green contends the\n\nrespondent judge abused her discretion when she granted real party in interest James Green’s\n\nmotion to compel production of the expert’s “entire file pertaining to Lisa and/or James\n\nGreen and/or Lisa Frank Inc.” In the context of the specific facts of this case, we agree.\n\nAccordingly, we accept jurisdiction of the special action and grant relief by vacating the\n\nrespondent judge’s discovery order.\n\n                                        Background\n\n¶2            The discovery dispute arose after a pre-decree hearing was convened to address\n\nthe parties’ possession of liquid assets pendente lite. Lisa had called Byron Fox, a financial\n\nconsultant, to testify at the hearing on March 24, 2006, and designated him as an expert\n\nwitness for trial while the continued hearing was still pending. On March 28, James\n\nsubpoenaed Fox’s entire file relating to the parties and Lisa Frank Inc., to be produced at\n\nthe continued hearing on March 31. Lisa objected to the subpoena.\n\n¶3            On March 31, Fox sent a letter to James’s counsel objecting to the requested\n\nproduction and did not produce any materials when he appeared at the scheduled hearing\n\n\n                                              2\n\fthat day. After Lisa’s counsel complained that she had been given inadequate time to brief\n\nher objection to the subpoena, the respondent judge delayed ruling on production of the file\n\npending further briefing. At the respondent’s suggestion, James cross-examined Fox that day\n\nand reserved the right to recall him if the court later ordered disclosures pursuant to the\n\nsubpoena.\n\n¶4            Sometime after that hearing, Lisa produced only those portions of Fox’s file\n\nshe believed to be related to the subject matter of his testimony at the hearing and expected\n\ntestimony at trial. Lisa also moved to modify James’s subpoena to limit the scope of\n\nproduction to those documents related to the subject of Fox’s testimony.1 James opposed\n\nthat motion and on May 23 moved to compel the production of all documents requested in\n\nhis subpoena. The two motions were set for hearing on June 27. Before that hearing was\n\nheld, however, two critical events occurred: (1) on May 26, the respondent judge approved\n\na stipulation of the parties that resolved the distribution of liquid assets pendente lite and\n\n\n\n\n       1\n        In her petition, Lisa cites Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission v.

Although James does not\ndispute the standard applied in those cases, he maintains that it allows for broad discovery\nof experts. James also complains that file documents that were not voluntarily disclosed\nwere not indexed in a privilege log or subjected to in-camera review. Lisa contends the\nrespondent judge was offered an opportunity to review in camera the documents withheld\nfrom production but declined to do so. In any event, in view of our disposition on the\nmerits, we do not address these collateral issues.\n\n                                              3\n\fvacated all further hearings on that issue, and (2) on June 6, Lisa withdrew her designation\n\nof Fox as a trial witness.\n\n¶5            After the June 27 hearing on the parties’ discovery dispute, the respondent\n\njudge concluded that Lisa,\n\n              by calling Mr. Fox as a witness to testify in preliminary matters\n              not only as to facts, but also by giving opinion testimony, ha[d]\n              waived any privilege that may have existed regarding Mr. Fox as\n              a consulting expert with respect to the issues before this court,\n              regardless of whether Mr. Fox has testified to the issues to date\n              or not.\n\nThe respondent judge then compelled disclosure of Fox’s files, in their entirety, as requested\n\nin James’s subpoena.

In Mantolete, the court reasoned that when a defendant\n              changed its expert’s designation from “testifying expert” to\n              “non-testifying” expert under Rule 26(b)(4) of the Federal\n              Rules of Civil Procedure, discovery by plaintiff was limited to\n              the restrictions set forth for non-testifying experts. Id. The\n              court rejected the plaintiff’s argument that the redesignation of\n              the witness was simply a way to avoid discovery and thus a\n              gross abuse of the federal rules. Id. at 182 n.2. Instead, the\n              court opined that the “defendant is permitted to execute the\n              trial strategy it deems appropriate to defend its case; this\n              extends to changing the status of an expert, which thereby\n              narrows the scope of discovery.” Id.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2640613\"><a href=\"/opinion/2640613/minority-coalition-v-independent-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">337</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 84, 121 P.3d at 865.\n\n¶10           Although Arizona Minority Coalition found reinstatement of work product\n\nprotection occurs when a witness designation is withdrawn “before expert opinion evidence\n\nis offered,” id. ¶ 83, the court there was not required to address the issue raised here:\n\nWhether the work product protection associated with an expert consultant may be restored\n\nby withdrawing an expert’s witness designation after that expert has testified for a limited\n\npurpose during a pretrial hearing and after the parties have resolved by stipulation the matter\n\non which the expert previously testified. Thus, we address this issue as a matter of first\n\nimpression.\n\n\n                                              7\n\f¶11           First, we concur with Division One that the “mere . . . designation” of an\n\nexpert witness does not create “a permanent waiver of [work product protection] that\n\n[can]not be revoked.”2 Id. ¶ 82. As one federal court construing the identical provisions of\n\nRule 26, Fed. R. Civ. P., has explained:\n\n              Rule 26(b)(4)(B) is designed to promote fairness by preventing\n              access to another party’s diligent trial preparation. In contrast,\n              Rule 26(b)(4)(A) is designed to allow the opposing party an\n              opportunity to adequately prepare for cross-examination at trial,\n              a concern that does not exist when the expert will not be called\n              at trial. Thus, fairness requires that Rule 26(b)(4)(B)’s\n              protections apply to a consulting expert who will not be called\n              to testify at trial, regardless of whether the party who retained\n              the expert at one time had intended to call the expert to testify.\n\nEmployer’s Reinsurance Corp. v.

In that case, Kelco had begun the deposition of\n\n\n                                              11\n\fPharmacia’s designated expert witness on Kelco’s environmental claim when it learned that\n\nnot all documents reviewed by the expert had been disclosed. Id. at 177. Kelco continued\n\nthe deposition and moved to compel production of the documents, and Pharmacia opposed\n\nthe motion based on attorney-client privilege. Id. at 178. While Kelco’s motion to compel\n\nproduction was pending, Pharmacia withdrew the expert from its witness list. Id. The\n\ndistrict court ruled that disclosure was required, despite Pharmacia’s redesignation of its\n\nexpert, for the following reasons: (1) the court’s conclusion that “the privilege once waived\n\ncannot be regained”; (2) the expert disclosures might have been relevant to something other\n\nthan the expert’s testimony; and (3) the environmental claim was still pending in the action.\n\nId. at 178-79.\n\n¶17              The first prong of the court’s ruling in Kelco, however, is incompatible with\n\nArizona law. As noted earlier, although an Arizona litigant waives the Rule 26(b)(4)(B)\n\nprotection afforded to an expert consultant once that expert is identified as a witness, that\n\nwaiver is not necessarily irrevocable.

Most important, in contrast to the situation in Kelco, the subject matter of\n\nFox’s testimony—the distribution of assets pendente lite—does not remain an issue in this\n\ncase because the parties have stipulated to its resolution. And Lisa’s counsel has avowed\n\nthat Fox’s opinion testimony will not be used for any other purpose in this case, at trial or\n\notherwise.7 In sum, we do not find Kelco persuasive or applicable to the situation presented\n\nhere.\n\n\n\n\n        Given that avowal, we find unpersuasive James’s assertions at oral argument that\n        7\n\nFox’s prior testimony touched on some still-pending issues and might later be used or relied\non by Lisa’s new expert or the trial court in future rulings. Any issues relating to Fox’s\ntestimony that might arise in the future are not before us and are based on sheer conjecture.\nIn addition, the limited record before us neither includes Fox’s testimony nor otherwise\nsupports James’s speculative concerns.\n\n                                             13\n\f¶19           The respondent judge, like the trial court in Arizona Minority Coalition,\n\n“misinterpreted the impact” of Lisa’s original designation of Fox as a witness and her later\n\nwithdrawal of that designation. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2640613\"><a href=\"/opinion/2640613/minority-coalition-v-independent-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">337</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 82, 121 P.3d at 865. Our holding is\n\nlimited to the facts before us, and we do not suggest that work product protection may\n\nalways be restored by withdrawing a witness designation, even after an expert has testified\n\nabout preliminary matters. We recognize that the subjects of pretrial testimony might not\n\nalways be as readily segregated from trial issues as they are here. In this case, in which Fox’s\n\nonly testimony related to an allocation of certain liquid assets and expenses pendente lite\n\nthat was ultimately resolved by a stipulation of the parties, the respondent judge abused her\n\ndiscretion in ruling that Lisa had irrevocably “waived any privilege that may have existed”\n\nin her consultations with Fox “with respect to the issues before [the] Court, regardless of\n\nwhether Mr. Fox has testified to the issues to date or not.”\n\n¶20           Because we hold that the respondent judge erred in granting James’s motion\n\nto compel production of additional documents, we need not reach the issue of whether the\n\nsubpoena’s scope should have been limited to those documents already voluntarily\n\ndisclosed. We grant special action relief and vacate the respondent judge’s order of June 27,\n\n2006.\n\n\n\n                                               ____________________________________\n                                               JOHN PELANDER, Chief Judge\n\nCONCURRING:\n\n                                              14\n\f____________________________________\nJOSEPH W.
