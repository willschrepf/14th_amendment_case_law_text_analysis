The district court granted summary judgment\nto the defendants on the claims of one plaintiff because it held that\nAlaska Native Corporations and their subsidiaries were not subject to\nsuit under either of the federal anti-discrimination laws. It dismissed\nthe claims of two other plaintiffs because a collective bargaining\nagreement required that the claims be addressed through binding arbi-\ntration.\n\f                 ALEMAN v. CHUGACH SUPPORT SERVICES                         3\n   We reinstate the claims of the first plaintiff because the exemption\nfor Alaska Native Corporations from suit under Title VII does not\nimmunize the defendants from suit under the separate and indepen-\ndent cause of action established by Section 1981. However, we affirm\nthe dismissal of the union members’ claims, because any duty to\nexplain the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement to\nemployees with limited English skills belongs principally with the\nunion which represents them.\n\n                                      I.\n\n   The plaintiffs, carpenters Jose Aleman and Cesar Basilis and\nfinance manager James Blasic, were employed by defendant Chugach\nSupport Services, Inc. (\"CSS\") on construction projects that CSS con-\ntracted to perform for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Ser-\nvices at the National Institutes of Health (\"NIH\") campus in Bethesda,\nMaryland.1 CSS performs general contractor services, typically for the\nfederal government, and is a wholly owned subsidiary of defendant\nChugach Alaska Corporation, an Alaska Native Corporation owned\nby Native Alaskans and their devisees.\n\n   Alaska Native Corporations play special roles in controlling lands\nand funds for Alaskan Natives, see Alaska Native Claims Settlement\nAct, Pub. L. No. 92-203, 85 Stat. 688 (1971) (codified as amended\nat 43 U.S.C. §§ 1601-1629a (2000)), but Chugach Alaska Corporation\nalso operates as a traditional business, employing about 5,000 people\nin construction, environmental services, information technology, tele-\ncommunications, and other areas. The defendants have not alleged\nthat the plaintiffs’ work touched in any way on the internal affairs or\nspecial functions of the Alaska Native Corporation.\n\n   Plaintiff Jose Aleman, who is Hispanic, performed carpentry and\nother tasks at the NIH site from March 10, 2003 until he was dis-\nmissed on September 9, 2003. Plaintiff Cesar Basilis, who is also His-\npanic, worked at the NIH site from February 11, 2003, until he was\ndismissed on October 17, 2003. Plaintiff James Blasic, who describes\n  1\n   Two other former employees, Carlos Borrayo and Mario Rodas, were\nalso plaintiffs in the suit when it was filed, but have since voluntarily dis-\nmissed their claims with prejudice.\n\f4               ALEMAN v. CHUGACH SUPPORT SERVICES\nhimself as Caucasian and does not claim Hispanic ancestry, worked\nfor CSS from December 2, 2002 until he was dismissed on October\n22, 2003.\n\n   Aleman and Basilis were required to join the Washington D.C.\nRegional Council of Carpenters as a condition of their employment,\nand became members on August 15, 2003. The union’s collective bar-\ngaining agreement states that it covers the period from May 1, 2001\nuntil April 30, 2004 — a period that includes all of Aleman and\nBasilis’ time as CSS employees. It includes mandatory dispute resolu-\ntion procedures, including procedures for binding arbitration, with\nrespect to any \"grievance\" between an employer and an employee\nrepresented by the union. It further states,\n\n    The parties expressly agree that a grievance shall include\n    any claim by an employee that he has been subjected to dis-\n    crimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n    as amended, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act,\n    the Americans with Disabilities Act, and/or all other federal,\n    state, and local anti-discrimination laws.\n\nBlasic was not a union member, evidently because as a finance man-\nager rather than a carpenter he was not required to join the union as\na condition of employment. He was therefore not covered by the col-\nlective bargaining agreement’s dispute resolution provisions.\n\n   Aleman and Basilis have apparently not sought to resolve their\ngrievances through the procedures set forth in the collective bargain-\ning agreement, but they allege that they should not be bound by the\nprocedures because they were not provided with a translation of the\ncollective bargaining agreement or its dispute resolution provisions\ninto their native Spanish. Each stated in declarations made as part of\nthis litigation that his ability to speak and write English is limited.\nNeither plaintiff claimed, however, that he did not or could not under-\nstand the arbitration provision in English.\n\n   Plaintiffs filed suit on December 27, 2004, claiming unlawful dis-\ncrimination under Title VII and Section 1981 as well as Maryland\nlaw. Aleman and Basilis allege, in particular, that CSS terminated\nthem on the basis of race. They also allege that when they were\n\f                ALEMAN v. CHUGACH SUPPORT SERVICES                     5\nemployed by CSS, they were paid less than non-Hispanic employees\nand were subjected to a hostile work environment and discriminatory\nterms and conditions of employment, including anti-Hispanic state-\nments by managers and employees, segregated eating areas, and dis-\nparate disciplinary treatment. They further allege that an \"English\nOnly\" rule at their workplace constituted unlawful discrimination.\nThe two union members later filed a motion to amend their complaint\nin order to add their union as a defendant, asserting that the union dis-\ncriminated against them under the same anti-discrimination statutes\nby failing to provide equal representation and by employing discrimi-\nnatory terms and conditions, practices, and/or procedures. They cite,\nin particular, the union’s failure to provide its members with a Span-\nish translation of the collective bargaining agreement or with the\nassistance of a translator in interpreting the agreement. The plaintiffs\nwere not required to arbitrate claims against their union.\n\n   Blasic alleges that CSS violated the anti-discrimination statutes by\nterminating him in retaliation for reporting racial discrimination in the\ncompany’s operations. He states that he was fired one week after\nreporting to the defendants that Aleman, Basilis, and two other His-\npanic employees had been dismissed and that derogatory comments\nhad been made to non-Caucasians at CSS’ work site.\n\n   On November 7, 2005, the district court granted the defendants’\nmotion to dismiss the claims of Aleman and Basilis on the grounds\nthat their collective bargaining agreement required binding arbitration\nof claims under Title VII \"and/or all other federal, state, and local\nanti-discrimination laws.\" The court denied Aleman and Basilis’\nmotion to add the union as a defendant in the same decision. On\nMarch 28, 2006, the district court granted summary judgment to the\ndefendants regarding Blasic’s Title VII and Section 1981 claims on\nthe grounds that Alaska Native Corporations were exempt from suit\nunder both anti-discrimination statutes. It declined supplemental juris-\ndiction over the remaining state law claims.\n\n   Aleman, Basilis, and Blasic do not now dispute that the defendants\nare immune from suit under Title VII, but they argue that the defen-\ndants are not immune from suit under Section 1981. They also argue\nthat the district court erred in dismissing the claims of Aleman and\nBasilis based upon the dispute resolution provision in their collective\n\f6                  ALEMAN v. CHUGACH SUPPORT SERVICES\nbargaining agreement, and in declining to add the union as a defen-\ndant.\n\n                                      II.\n\n                                      A.\n\n   Title VII created a new cause of action for employment discrimina-\ntion against unions, employment agencies, and any entity defined as\nan \"employer.\" The statute provides, in relevant part,\n\n        It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer\n        . . . to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual,\n        or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with\n        respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges\n        of employment, because of such individual’s race, color,\n        religion, sex, or national origin . . . .\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a). The class of employers covered by Title VII\nis restricted to persons with fifteen or more employees, and it\nexcludes bona fide private membership clubs, certain government\nentities, id. § 2000e(b), and — most relevantly — Alaska Native Cor-\nporations, 43 U.S.C. § 1626(g) (2000), and Indian tribes, 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e(b). The defendants argue that these exclusions not only bar\nsuit against Alaska Native Corporations and Indian tribes under Title\nVII, but also render such entities immune from suit under Section\n1981.\n\n   We reject this contention for two reasons. By their own terms, the\nTitle VII exclusions are limited to Title VII itself. And Section 1981\n— which the Supreme Court has instructed us to treat as a separate\nand distinct cause of action — contains no exemptions corresponding\nto those in Title VII.2\n    2\n   Because employer exemptions under Title VII do not bar suits under\nSection 1981, we need not address the plaintiffs’ contention that the\ndefendants do not qualify as Indian tribes for the purposes of Title VII’s\nemployer exemptions in any event.\n\f                ALEMAN v. CHUGACH SUPPORT SERVICES                      7\n   While the definition of \"employer\" in Title VII excludes Indian\ntribes and Alaska Native Corporations, these exclusions state that they\nare limited to the section of federal law that contains Title VII. The\nsingle-sentence exclusion for Alaska Native Corporations makes this\nclear twice, stating,\n\n    For the purposes of implementation of the Civil Rights Act\n    of 1964 [42 U.S.C. 2000a et seq.], a Native Corporation and\n    corporations, partnerships, joint ventures, trusts, or affiliates\n    in which the Native Corporation owns not less than 25 per\n    centum of the equity shall be within the class of entities\n    excluded from the definition of \"employer\" by section\n    701(b)(1) of Public Law 88-352 (78 Stat. 253), as amended\n    [42 U.S.C. § 2000e(b)(1)], or successor statutes.\n\n43 U.S.C. § 1626(g) (emphasis added). Similarly, the provision\nexcluding Indian tribes from Title VII’s definition of employer states,\n\"For the purposes of this subchapter . . . [t]he term ‘employer’ . . .\ndoes not include . . . an Indian tribe . . . .\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e (empha-\nsis added). The subchapter containing Title VII does not contain Sec-\ntion 1981.\n\n   Section 1981 contains no similar exception for Alaska Native Cor-\nporations. Its civil cause of action, enacted as part of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1866, states, \"All persons within the jurisdiction of the United\nStates shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make\nand enforce contracts . . . as is enjoyed by white citizens . . . .\" Id.\n§ 1981(a). The Supreme Court has long held the Civil Rights Act of\n1866 \"to prohibit all racial discrimination, whether or not under color\nof law, with respect to the rights enumerated therein.\" Jones v. Alfred\nH. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409, 436 (1968). Congress amended the stat-\nute in 1991 to codify this understanding, stating that Section 1981\nprotects rights \"against impairment by nongovernmental discrimina-\ntion\" in addition to \"impairment under color of State law.\" 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1981(c). Section 1981 makes no mention of Alaska Native Corpora-\ntions or Indian tribes, and it includes no terms that could be construed\nto set such entities outside the statute’s reach.\n\n  Indeed, it is hard to imagine how the exclusions of Alaska Native\nCorporations and Indian tribes from Title VII’s definition of \"em-\n\f8               ALEMAN v. CHUGACH SUPPORT SERVICES\nployer\" could control under Section 1981, because Section 1981 does\nnot apply solely to employers or employment discrimination. Section\n1981’s prohibition on racial discrimination in the making and\nenforcement of contracts has long been applied to relationships far\nafield of employment. Black parents established \"a classic violation\nof § 1981\" by showing that private schools refused, on the basis of\nrace, to enroll their children. Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S. 160, 172\n(1976). Prospective purchasers of home leaseholds, Pinchback v.\nArmistead Homes Corp., 907 F.2d 1447, 1448 (4th Cir. 1990), and\nprospective club members, Wright v. Salisbury Club, Ltd., 632 F.2d\n309, 310 (4th Cir. 1980), among others, have availed themselves of\nthe statute’s protections. Thus, the Supreme Court wrote in Johnson\nv. Railway Express Agency, Inc. that the limitation of Title VII to\nthose defined as employers is one way in which Title VII is narrower\nthan Section 1981, writing that \"Section 1981 is not coextensive in its\ncoverage with Title VII\" in part because \"the latter is made inapplica-\nble to certain employers.\" 421 U.S. 454, 460 (1975). While exclusions\nfrom the \"employer\" category are crucial for the Title VII scheme\ndirected at employment discrimination, they thus have lesser rele-\nvance under Section 1981’s extended protections.\n\n   The defendants nevertheless urge that the employer exceptions in\nTitle VII must be read broadly if they are to serve their purpose.\nWithout such a reading, Alaska Native Corporations would be immu-\nnized from suit for acts of discrimination under Title VII, but face lia-\nbility under Section 1981 for some of the same acts — a result that\ndefendants argue would strip the Title VII exemption of any meaning\nand run counter to what must have been Congress’ purpose in enact-\ning the \"employer\" exceptions. The Tenth Circuit has agreed with\ndefendants, writing that the \"specific\" provisions of Title VII must be\nunderstood to impose limits on the \"broad, general provision\" of Sec-\ntion 1981, and that Indian tribes are therefore exempt from suit for\ndiscriminatory discharge under Section 1981. Wardle v. Ute Indian\nTribe, 623 F.2d 670, 673 (10th Cir. 1980).\n\n   The Supreme Court has foreclosed such a reading of Title VII as\nintended to amend Section 1981 sub silentio in the areas where Title\nVII is more specific, holding \"that the remedies available under Title\nVII and under § 1981, although related, and although directed to most\nof the same ends, are separate, distinct, and independent.\" Railway\n\f                ALEMAN v. CHUGACH SUPPORT SERVICES                    9\nExpress, 421 U.S. at 461. \"Title VII was designed to supplement\nrather than supplant, existing laws and institutions relating to employ-\nment discrimination,\" Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U.S. 36,\n48-49 (1979), because Congress sought \"to accord parallel or overlap-\nping remedies against discrimination,\" not to overwrite longstanding\nremedies through its subsequent enactments, id. at 48. In sum, an\nindividual aggrieved by acts of employment discrimination \"clearly is\nnot deprived of other remedies he possesses and is not limited to Title\nVII in his search for relief.\" Railway Express, 421 U.S. at 459; see\nalso Johnson v. Ryder Truck Lines, Inc., 575 F.2d 471, 473 (4th Cir.\n1978) (\"The Civil Rights Act of 1964 did not repeal by implication\nany part of § 1981.\").\n\n   We find nothing implausible about Congress’ enacting overlapping\ncauses of action or deciding that Alaska Native Corporations should\nbe exempt from suit under Title VII, but not Section 1981. While both\nSection 1981 and Title VII provide remedies against racial discrimi-\nnation, Title VII imposes obligations that are in some ways more\nexpansive. To take the most obvious example, Title VII addresses not\nsimply discrimination based upon race or color but also discrimina-\ntion based upon \"religion, sex, or national origin.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n2(a). A legislature could easily desire to subject only certain entities\nto the additional strictures of Title VII, while leaving in place the\nmore limited cause of action in Section 1981 that has long been a part\nof our anti-discrimination law.\n\n   In addition, Title VII establishes new remedies for racial discrimi-\nnation in employment that Congress could have seen as undesirable\nfor Alaska Native Corporations. Under the Title VII framework, a\nclaimant must first lodge a charge with the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"), see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)-(f);\nGreat Am. Fed. Savings & Loan Ass’n v. Novotny, 442 U.S. 366, 372-\n74 (1979) — an action that is not a prerequisite to filing a Section\n1981 suit. After lodging a charge under Title VII, however, a com-\nplainant can benefit from EEOC powers not made available by Sec-\ntion 1981. These include the agency’s ability to investigate charges\nof discrimination, its attempts to remedy noncompliance through vol-\nuntary or negotiated changes, and its authority to file a civil action\nagainst the offending party and practice itself. Railway Express, 421\nU.S. at 458. There is nothing paradoxical about Congress’ not apply-\n\f10              ALEMAN v. CHUGACH SUPPORT SERVICES\ning these arguably more intrusive mechanisms to Alaska Native Cor-\nporations, without narrowing the scope of the longstanding,\ncomparatively bare-bones cause of action against racial discrimina-\ntion provided by Section 1981. In any event, because this is the\napproach embodied in the language of the two statutes and in the\nSupreme Court’s decisions, the district court erred in holding that\nplaintiffs could be deprived of a cause of action against Alaska Native\nCorporations under Section 1981 on the grounds that such defendants\nare not subject to suit under Title VII.\n\n   To be sure, we have recognized Indian tribal immunity as a bar to\nSection 1981 liability. See Yashenko v. Harrah’s N.C. Casino Co.,\n446 F.3d 541, 551-53 (4th Cir. 2006). But the defendants claim no\nsuch immunity here and we find no basis to conclude that the owner-\nship of the defendant corporations by Alaska Natives and their devi-\nsees, or any other attribute, entitles the defendants to immunity from\nsuits arising from their for-profit construction activities in Maryland.\nWhile the sovereign immunity of Indian tribes \"is a necessary corol-\nlary to Indian sovereignty and self-governance,\" Three Affiliated\nTribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation v. Wold Engineering, 476\nU.S. 877, 890 (1986), Alaska Native Corporations and their subsidia-\nries are not comparable sovereign entities, see Native Village of Ste-\nvens v. Alaska Management & Planning, 757 P.2d 32, 34 (Alaska\n1988) (reviewing differences between Alaska Native groups and\nIndian tribes and holding most Alaska native groups lack immunity\nfrom suit because they are \"not self-governing or in any meaningful\nsense sovereign\"); see also Seldovia Native Ass’n v. Lujan, 904 F.2d\n1335, 1350 (9th Cir. 1990) (holding that Alaska Native Village Cor-\nporation \"does not meet one of the basic criteria of an Indian tribe\"\nbecause it \"is not a governing body\"). In short, Indian tribal immunity\ndoes not foreclose Section 1981 relief here.\n\n                                   B.\n\n   The defendants claim that the district court’s grant of summary\njudgment in its favor on plaintiff Blasic’s claims for retaliation can be\nupheld on the alternate ground that Section 1981 does not contain an\nanti-retaliation provision. They argue that if we fail to apply Title VII\nemployer exemptions to Section 1981, we must likewise decline to\nimport an anti-retaliation principle from Title VII into Section 1981.\n\f                ALEMAN v. CHUGACH SUPPORT SERVICES                   11\n   This argument fails for two reasons. First, it was not raised in the\ndistrict court. Second, it is foreclosed by Supreme Court and circuit\nprecedent, which hold retaliation to be a form of differential treatment\nsubsumed in the anti-discrimination language of Section 1981. Bryant\nv. Aiken Reg’l Med. Ctrs., Inc., 333 F.3d 536, 543 (4th Cir. 2003)\n(holding that a \"plaintiff can prove illegal retaliation under . . .\n§ 1981\" in the same manner as he establishes retaliation under Title\nVII); see also Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Ed., 544 U.S. 167, 174-\n75 (2005) (retaliation for complaints of unlawful discrimination is a\nform of discrimination). Under these precedents, plaintiffs such as\nBlasic can challenge as discriminatory actions that were taken against\nthem for reporting unlawful discrimination, even if the plaintiffs were\nnot subject to discrimination based upon their own race, gender, or\nsimilar protected status. See Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc., 396\nU.S. 229, 237 (1969) (permitting white plaintiff to bring suit under 42\nU.S.C. § 1982’s racial discrimination provisions because he suffered\nretaliation for protesting discrimination against black person); Jack-\nson, 544 U.S. at 171 (holding male athletic coach could bring suit\nunder prohibition on sex discrimination in Title IX of the Education\nAmendments of 1972, because coach alleged that he suffered adverse\nconsequences for protesting discriminatory treatment of female ath-\nletes). In sum, the grant of summary judgment against Blasic on his\nSection 1981 claims cannot be justified on the alternative grounds that\nSection 1981 does not encompass retaliation claims.3 Blasic had the\nright to protest discrimination visited upon Hispanic employees and\nto proceed under Section 1981 if he lost his job as a result.\n\n                                  III.\n\n                                  A.\n\n  Plaintiffs also appeal the dismissal of the claims of Aleman and\nBasilis. The district court based its dismissal upon a provision in Ale-\nman and Basilis’ collective bargaining agreement requiring manda-\n  3\n    The defendants’ similar argument that mixed-motive discrimination is\nnot cognizable under Section 1981 does not appear to have been raised\nbelow and was not addressed by the district court. It cannot provide an\nalternate basis here for affirming summary judgment to the defendants on\nBlasic’s claims.\n\f12               ALEMAN v. CHUGACH SUPPORT SERVICES\ntory arbitration of discrimination claims. The two union members\nargue that the provision should not bind them. They have stated in\naffidavits that their \"ability to speak and read English is limited\" and\n\"very limited,\" respectively, and that each has \"a very limited ability\nto read English as compared to Spanish,\" although neither plaintiff\nsuggested in his affidavit or complaint that he could not read or\nunderstand the arbitration provision as written.4 While Aleman and\nBasilis point to no statute or precedent indicating an employer must\nsecure translations of a collective bargaining agreement according to\nunion members’ relative linguistic skills or preferences, they argue\nthat such a duty is a logical extension of principles of contract law\nand collective bargaining. We find neither of these sources support\nsuch a duty and decline to void the arbitration provision with respect\nto Aleman and Basilis on these grounds.\n\n   Aleman and Basilis first argue that they should not be bound by the\narbitration provision in their collective bargaining agreement as an\nextension or application of \"ordinary contract principles.\" Brief of\nAppellants at 39. They suggest that because they were not provided\nwith a translated version of the arbitration provision, there was no\n\"meeting of the minds\" between themselves and their employer, given\nthat their Spanish skills were stronger than their English skills. Brief\nof Appellant at 39, 40. In other words, they claim the provision was\nnot binding because there was no true agreement between the parties.\nSee Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 17 cmt. c (1981) (\"The ele-\nment of agreement is sometimes referred to as a ‘meeting of the\nminds.’\").\n\n  Aleman and Basilis’ suggestion that the collective bargaining\nagreement was not binding upon them because they did not truly\nagree to its terms disregards the \"collective\" in \"collective bargain-\n  4\n    Appellants state for the first time in their brief before this court that\n\"Aleman and Basilis did not understand the arbitration provision and\nwould not have understood it unless the company or union had provided\nthem with Spanish translated copies of the arbitration provision.\" They\nmade no such claims below, however, and make them now only in reli-\nance on Aleman and Basilis’ declarations, neither of which states that the\naffiant did not understand the dispute resolution provision or would not\nhave understood it absent translation. Brief of Appellants at 40.\n\f                ALEMAN v. CHUGACH SUPPORT SERVICES                   13\ning.\" The National Labor Relations Act gives employees the right \"to\nform, join or assist labor organizations\" and \"to bargain collectively\nthrough representatives of their own choosing.\" 29 U.S.C. § 157\n(2000); see also id. § 159(a) (2000). Acceptance by individual union\nmembers of individual provisions is not required, because the forma-\ntion of a collective bargaining unit \"extinguishes the individual\nemployee’s power to order his own relations with his employer and\ncreates a power vested in the chosen representative to act in the inter-\nests of all employees,\" with the result that \"only the union may con-\ntract the employee’s terms and conditions of employment, and\nprovisions for processing his grievances.\" NLRB v. Allis-Chalmers\nMfg. Co., 388 U.S. 175, 180 (1967) (footnote omitted); see also J.I.\nCase Co. v. NLRB, 321 U.S. 332, 336 (1944) (describing employee’s\nstatus under collective bargaining agreement as analogous to that of\n\"third party beneficiary\").\n\n    It is natural that a union member might desire higher wages or\nmore generous benefits or different working conditions than an agree-\nment provides. Still, in a representative negotiation, he \"is bound\" by\nit. Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co., 388 U.S. at 180. As a result, when courts\nhave spoken of the \"meeting of the minds\" required for a collective\nbargaining agreement, it has been a \"meeting of the minds\" between\nan employer and a union, not between an employer and each and\nevery individual union member. See, e.g., United Steelworkers of Am.\nv. Bell Foundry Co., 626 F.2d 139, 141 (9th Cir. 1980); see also, e.g.,\nEkas v. Carling Nat’l Breweries, Inc., 602 F.2d 664, 666-67 (4th Cir.\n1979) (modification of collective bargaining agreement was valid\nwhen union and employer assented, despite objections of some\nemployees); Eastern Air Lines, Inc. v. Air Line Pilots Ass’n, Int’l, 861\nF.2d 1546, 1553-54 (11th Cir. 1988) (collective bargaining agreement\nwas binding when union and employer manifested assent).\n\n   Nor can we find a basis for Aleman and Basilis’ novel duty of\ntranslation in the settled requirement that a collective bargaining\nagreement contain a \"clear and unmistakable\" waiver of the right to\na federal judicial forum in order to require the binding arbitration of\nstatutory discrimination claims. Wright v. Universal Maritime Serv.\nCorp., 525 U.S. 70, 80 (1998). As the precedents of the Supreme\nCourt and our circuit have established, this is a principle of clear\ndrafting, which ensures that the federal forum for such claims is\n\f14              ALEMAN v. CHUGACH SUPPORT SERVICES\nwaived only when the union and employer clearly intended such a\nwaiver. Thus, the Supreme Court has explained this requirement to\nmean that the federal-forum waiver must be \"‘explicitly stated,’\" id.\n(quoting Metropolitan Edison Co. v. NLRB, 460 U.S. 693, 701\n(1983)), and that an employee is not required to arbitrate federal\nemployment discrimination claims when the collective bargaining\nagreement \"does not contain a clear and unmistakable waiver of the\ncovered employees’ rights to a judicial forum,\" id. at 82.\n\n   Our circuit has thus read Universal Maritime to require that collec-\ntive bargaining agreements eliminate any doubt that a waiver of a fed-\neral forum was intended. Universal Maritime, we have noted,\n\"indicates that the requisite degree of clarity can be achieved by two\ndifferent approaches.\" Carson v. Giant Food, Inc., 175 F.3d 325, 331\n(4th Cir. 1999). First, provisions that require arbitration of disputes\nwithout mentioning statutory claims nonetheless require arbitration of\nstatutory claims if the rest of the agreement \"makes it unmistakably\nclear\" that a violation of discrimination laws constitutes a grievance\nor dispute under the agreement. Id. at 332. Second, an agreement\nrequires arbitration of statutory discrimination claims if it contains\n\"an explicit arbitration clause\" referring to statutory claims, which\nwould require in the case of an agreement to arbitrate all federal\nemployment claims \"a clear and unmistakable provision under which\nthe employees agree to submit to arbitration all federal causes of\naction arising out of their employment.\" Id. at 331.\n\n   The collective bargaining agreement to which Aleman and Basilis\nwere subject met the Universal Maritime test. The agreement pro-\nvided mandatory dispute resolution mechanisms for grievances and\nstated, \"The parties expressly agree that a grievance shall include any\nclaim by an employee that he has been subjected to discrimination\nunder Title VII . . . and/or all other federal, state, and local anti-\ndiscrimination laws\" (emphasis added). The agreement thus satisfied\nthe requirement of \"clear and unmistakable\" waiver, notwithstanding\nplaintiffs’ suggestion, contrary to our precedent, that \"clear and\nunmistakable\" waiver requires a meeting of the minds between the\nemployer and individual union members. As Aleman and Basilis cite\nno statute or precedent that can form a basis for the new duty they\npropose, we decline to place upon employers a requirement we find\nwithout basis in law.\n\f                ALEMAN v. CHUGACH SUPPORT SERVICES                   15\n   Indeed, to the extent that the plaintiffs assert that employers must\nprovide translations of agreements on the theory that union members\nmust individually consent to the waiver of a federal forum for statu-\ntory discrimination claims, their argument is contrary to our cases\nestablishing that unions are entitled to strike bargains that require\narbitration of such claims. We have repeatedly held that such matters\nare among the subjects about which unions may bargain under the\nNational Labor Relations Act. We have observed that unions have the\nright — indeed, the duty — to bargain with employers on their mem-\nbers’ behalf over \"terms and conditions of employment,\" see 29\nU.S.C. § 158(d) (2000), and that the method through which employers\nand union members resolve disputes is a preeminent term or condition\nof employment. Safrit v. Cone Mills Corp., 248 F.3d 306, 308 (4th\nCir. 2001) (citing Austin v. Owens-Brockway Glass Container, Inc.,\n78 F.3d 875, 885 (4th Cir. 1996); Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills,\n353 U.S. 448 (1957); Metropolitan Edison Co., 460 U.S. at 705). As\na result, \"Union-negotiated collective bargaining agreements that\nrequire the arbitration of statutory discrimination claims are valid and\nbinding on unionized employees.\" Carson, 175 F.3d at 331; see also\nSafrit, 248 F.3d at 308; Austin, 78 F.3d at 880-85; Brown v. ABF\nFreight Sys., Inc., 183 F.3d 319, 321 (4th Cir. 1999).\n\n   The enactment of civil rights laws against discrimination does not\nby itself mean the Congress intended to place the resolution of such\nclaims beyond the reach of arbitration. Congress could do this, of\ncourse, but it has not yet done so. To hold otherwise would be too\nmuch an exercise in judicial implication. The scope of the arbitration\nprovision must be of a \"clear and unmistakable\" character no doubt,\nbut to say there can be no waiver at all is to change the nature of col-\nlective bargaining over conditions of employment and to read judicial\nexceptions into the National Labor Relations Act.\n\n                                  B.\n\n   Aleman and Basilis, however, argue that an employer’s duty to\nprovide translations of the agreement to employees with deficient\nEnglish skills renders the foregoing principles inoperative and voids\nthe collective bargaining agreement’s dispute resolution provision.\nAleman and Basilis argue that their proposed duty would be mini-\nmally disruptive because this court could simply require that \"if an\n\f16              ALEMAN v. CHUGACH SUPPORT SERVICES\nemployer has notice that certain employees cannot communicate\neffectively in English, the employer must take reasonable steps to\nensure that these employees understand the arbitration provision.\"\nReply Brief of Appellants at 20.\n\n   To begin with, the duty is much too benignly described. The\nemployer is under no remedial order, and the basis of the duty in law\nis as vague as its obligations are significant. The number of employ-\nees who could invoke this principle to escape collective bargaining\nprovisions of all sorts would be vast, since the degree of linguistic\ndeficiency needed to invoke the duty is unclear, and plaintiffs would\nevidently require employers to secure translations on behalf of\nemployees — such as themselves — who evidently speak and read\nsome English. Ostensibly, Aleman and Basilis’ proposed duty would\napply only when employers had notice of limited language skills, but\nthe plaintiffs would hold employers to be on notice of limited lan-\nguage skills even where — as here — there is no allegation that the\nplaintiffs or their union told the defendants of Aleman or Basilis’ lan-\nguage limitations.\n\n   Even if employers could determine when they were subject to this\nnew duty, it is unclear just what \"reasonable steps\" employers would\nbe required to take in order to render the negotiated collective bar-\ngaining agreement fully comprehensible and thus enforceable. Ale-\nman and Basilis offer no more than passing suggestions as to how this\nduty could be discharged, contending that perhaps employers could\nfulfill the obligation through posted translations at the work site. But\nconceivably, the new duty could require translations in many different\nlanguages, and the quality and accuracy of the translations would\nlikely be at issue. The threat of voidability under this opaque\nemployer obligation would cast a pall over collective bargaining as a\ntechnique for resolving labor disputes, for neither side could be cer-\ntain when deals would bind the parties and when they would wholly\nor partially unravel with respect to many of those they purported to\ncover.\n\n   The disruption that the plaintiffs’ proposed duty threatens is only\ncompounded by plaintiffs’ suggestion that employers could fulfill\ntheir duty of translation by ensuring that unions faithfully communi-\ncated the contents of collective bargaining agreements to union mem-\n\f                 ALEMAN v. CHUGACH SUPPORT SERVICES                       17\nbers. It would be dicey to say the least for an employer to seek to\ncompel a union to fulfill what the employer regards as the union’s\nobligations to those it represents. See NLRB v. Electra-Food\nMachinery, Inc., 621 F.2d 956, 958 (9th Cir. 1980) (holding that\nemployer overstepped its role when it refused to enter into written\ncollective bargaining agreement because it believed union’s entering\nthe deal would violate union constitution). Nor could the employer\nstep in easily on its own. Unions and employers may well disagree on\nthe nature of collective bargaining agreement obligations, and encour-\naging excessive employer involvement in union affairs may generate\n\"collateral issues\" which might themselves \"become the source of dis-\npute and litigation.\" Id. By suggesting that internal union matters,\nincluding unions’ internal communications, can affect the validity of\na collective bargaining agreement, the plaintiffs would force employ-\ners to engage in intrusive oversight of their bargaining partners.\n\n   The proposed employer duty to provide union members with col-\nlective bargaining agreement translations is fraught with problems\nthat only Congress or other policy-making bodies could sort out.\nWhatever duty might arise in this regard between unions and their\nmembers is a question that is not before us.5 See Zamora v. Local 11,\n  5\n   Aleman and Basilis did not name the union as a defendant in their\ncomplaint. We affirm the denial of Aleman and Basilis’ motion to amend\ntheir complaint to add their union as a defendant, considering \"both the\ngeneral principles of amendment provided by Rule 15(a) and also the\nmore specific joinder provisions of Rule 20(a).\" Hinson v. Norwest\nFinancial S.C., Inc., 239 F.3d 611, 618 (4th Cir. 2001) (citing Desert\nEmpire Bank v. Insurance Co., 623 F.2d 1371, 1374 (9th Cir. 1980)).\n   Rule 20 gives courts wide discretion concerning the permissive joinder\nof parties, and \"should be construed in light of its purpose, which ‘is to\npromote trial convenience and expedite the final determination of dis-\nputes, thereby preventing multiple lawsuits.’\" Saval v. BL, Ltd., 710 F.2d\n1027, 1031 (4th Cir. 1983) (quoting Mosley v. General Motors Corp.,\n497 F.2d 1330, 1332 (8th Cir. 1974)). \"[T]he court has discretion to deny\njoinder if it determines that the addition of the party under Rule 20 will\nnot foster the objectives of the rule, but will result in prejudice, expense,\nor delay.\" 7 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane,\nFederal Practice and Procedure § 1652 (3d ed. 2001). Aleman and\nBasilis were not required to arbitrate claims against their union, but join-\n\f18              ALEMAN v. CHUGACH SUPPORT SERVICES\n817 F.2d 566, 569-71 (9th Cir. 1987) (stating that union rule of not\nproviding appropriate translation assistance at monthly meetings\ndeprived non-English speaking members of right to participate in\ndeliberations); Retana v. Apartment, Motel, Hotel & Elevator Opera-\ntors Union, 453 F.2d 1018, 1023-25 (9th Cir. 1972) (stating that\nunion’s failure to provide Spanish-speaking members with translation\nof collective bargaining agreement and other translation assistance\ncould violate duty of fair representation). The employer duty of trans-\nlation that Aleman and Basilis propose is, however, as at odds with\nthe aims of collective bargaining as it is without foundation in statute\nand precedent.\n\n                                  C.\n\n   Since Aleman and Basilis were bound by the collective bargaining\nagreement, they were required to resolve their discrimination claims\nthrough the procedures it provided, because the claims arose during\nthe agreement’s stated coverage period. The agreement sets forth\nmandatory dispute resolution procedures for any \"grievance . . . aris-\ning during the term of this Agreement\" between an employer and a\nunion member, including \"any claim by an employee that he has been\nsubjected to discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964, as amended, . . . and/or all other federal, state, and local anti-\ndiscrimination laws.\" The \"term of the agreement\" is defined repeat-\nedly as May 1, 2001 until April 30, 2004 — a period that includes all\nthe time Aleman and Basilis worked for CSS. This period is set out\ntwice on the agreement’s initial page, which contains the dates \"May\n1, 2001 - April 30, 2004\" near the top of the pact, above the word\n\"Agreement.\" The agreement goes on to state:\n\n     The undersigned employer accepts each and every provision\n     of the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Con-\n\ning new claims against a new party with now-dismissed claims would\nnot promote the above objectives and the district court did not err in\ndenying leave to amend.\n  Since the motion to add the union as a defendant was properly denied,\nwe express no view on any possible claim that Aleman and Basilis might\nhave against their union.\n\f                ALEMAN v.

Regional Council of Carpenters.\n\n(emphasis added). It specifies the same dates in the article on \"dura-\ntion of agreement,\" which states, \"This Agreement shall be in full\nforce and effect from May 1, 2001, to and including April 30, 2004\n. . . .\"\n\n   Plaintiffs suggest that other dates should define the agreement’s\ntemporal scope, but those dates have no operative significance under\nthe deal’s terms. Representatives of CSS and the union did not sign\nthe agreement until July of 2003, as Aleman and Basilis note, but the\nagreement does not define its scope according to the dates of signing.\nAnd while Aleman and Basilis observe that they did not themselves\njoin the union until August of 2003, when they did so, they bound\nthemselves to arbitrate any grievances arising during the term of the\nagreement as repeatedly set forth in the agreement’s text. Since the\npact requires arbitration of all grievances arising during the term from\nMay 1, 2001 to April 30, 2004, Aleman and Basilis’ claims were\nproperly dismissed on the basis of the dispute resolution provisions.\n\n                                  IV.\n\n   For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is affirmed in part,\nreversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\n\n                                               AFFIRMED IN PART,\n                                                REVERSED IN PART,\n                                                  AND REMANDED\n\f",

The district court granted summary judgment\nto the defendants on the claims of one plaintiff because it held that\nAlaska Native Corporations and their subsidiaries were not subject to\nsuit under either of the federal anti-discrimination laws. It dismissed\nthe claims of two other plaintiffs because a collective bargaining\nagreement required that the claims be addressed through binding arbi-\ntration.\n\f                 ALEMAN v. CHUGACH SUPPORT SERVICES                         3\n   We reinstate the claims of the first plaintiff because the exemption\nfor Alaska Native Corporations from suit under Title VII does not\nimmunize the defendants from suit under the separate and indepen-\ndent cause of action established by Section 1981. However, we affirm\nthe dismissal of the union members’ claims, because any duty to\nexplain the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement to\nemployees with limited English skills belongs principally with the\nunion which represents them.\n\n                                      I.\n\n   The plaintiffs, carpenters Jose Aleman and Cesar Basilis and\nfinance manager James Blasic, were employed by defendant Chugach\nSupport Services, Inc. (\"CSS\") on construction projects that CSS con-\ntracted to perform for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Ser-\nvices at the National Institutes of Health (\"NIH\") campus in Bethesda,\nMaryland.1 CSS performs general contractor services, typically for the\nfederal government, and is a wholly owned subsidiary of defendant\nChugach Alaska Corporation, an Alaska Native Corporation owned\nby Native Alaskans and their devisees.\n\n   Alaska Native Corporations play special roles in controlling lands\nand funds for Alaskan Natives, see Alaska Native Claims Settlement\nAct, Pub. L. No. 92-203, 85 Stat. 688 (1971) (codified as amended\nat 43 U.S.C. §§ 1601-1629a (2000)), but Chugach Alaska Corporation\nalso operates as a traditional business, employing about 5,000 people\nin construction, environmental services, information technology, tele-\ncommunications, and other areas. The defendants have not alleged\nthat the plaintiffs’ work touched in any way on the internal affairs or\nspecial functions of the Alaska Native Corporation.\n\n   Plaintiff Jose Aleman, who is Hispanic, performed carpentry and\nother tasks at the NIH site from March 10, 2003 until he was dis-\nmissed on September 9, 2003. Plaintiff Cesar Basilis, who is also His-\npanic, worked at the NIH site from February 11, 2003, until he was\ndismissed on October 17, 2003. Plaintiff James Blasic, who describes\n  1\n   Two other former employees, Carlos Borrayo and Mario Rodas, were\nalso plaintiffs in the suit when it was filed, but have since voluntarily dis-\nmissed their claims with prejudice.\n\f4               ALEMAN v. CHUGACH SUPPORT SERVICES\nhimself as Caucasian and does not claim Hispanic ancestry, worked\nfor CSS from December 2, 2002 until he was dismissed on October\n22, 2003.\n\n   Aleman and Basilis were required to join the Washington D.C.\nRegional Council of Carpenters as a condition of their employment,\nand became members on August 15, 2003. The union’s collective bar-\ngaining agreement states that it covers the period from May 1, 2001\nuntil April 30, 2004 — a period that includes all of Aleman and\nBasilis’ time as CSS employees. It includes mandatory dispute resolu-\ntion procedures, including procedures for binding arbitration, with\nrespect to any \"grievance\" between an employer and an employee\nrepresented by the union. It further states,\n\n    The parties expressly agree that a grievance shall include\n    any claim by an employee that he has been subjected to dis-\n    crimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n    as amended, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act,\n    the Americans with Disabilities Act, and/or all other federal,\n    state, and local anti-discrimination laws.\n\nBlasic was not a union member, evidently because as a finance man-\nager rather than a carpenter he was not required to join the union as\na condition of employment. He was therefore not covered by the col-\nlective bargaining agreement’s dispute resolution provisions.\n\n   Aleman and Basilis have apparently not sought to resolve their\ngrievances through the procedures set forth in the collective bargain-\ning agreement, but they allege that they should not be bound by the\nprocedures because they were not provided with a translation of the\ncollective bargaining agreement or its dispute resolution provisions\ninto their native Spanish. Each stated in declarations made as part of\nthis litigation that his ability to speak and write English is limited.\nNeither plaintiff claimed, however, that he did not or could not under-\nstand the arbitration provision in English.\n\n   Plaintiffs filed suit on December 27, 2004, claiming unlawful dis-\ncrimination under Title VII and Section 1981 as well as Maryland\nlaw. Aleman and Basilis allege, in particular, that CSS terminated\nthem on the basis of race. They also allege that when they were\n\f                ALEMAN v. CHUGACH SUPPORT SERVICES                     5\nemployed by CSS, they were paid less than non-Hispanic employees\nand were subjected to a hostile work environment and discriminatory\nterms and conditions of employment, including anti-Hispanic state-\nments by managers and employees, segregated eating areas, and dis-\nparate disciplinary treatment. They further allege that an \"English\nOnly\" rule at their workplace constituted unlawful discrimination.\nThe two union members later filed a motion to amend their complaint\nin order to add their union as a defendant, asserting that the union dis-\ncriminated against them under the same anti-discrimination statutes\nby failing to provide equal representation and by employing discrimi-\nnatory terms and conditions, practices, and/or procedures. They cite,\nin particular, the union’s failure to provide its members with a Span-\nish translation of the collective bargaining agreement or with the\nassistance of a translator in interpreting the agreement. The plaintiffs\nwere not required to arbitrate claims against their union.\n\n   Blasic alleges that CSS violated the anti-discrimination statutes by\nterminating him in retaliation for reporting racial discrimination in the\ncompany’s operations. He states that he was fired one week after\nreporting to the defendants that Aleman, Basilis, and two other His-\npanic employees had been dismissed and that derogatory comments\nhad been made to non-Caucasians at CSS’ work site.\n\n   On November 7, 2005, the district court granted the defendants’\nmotion to dismiss the claims of Aleman and Basilis on the grounds\nthat their collective bargaining agreement required binding arbitration\nof claims under Title VII \"and/or all other federal, state, and local\nanti-discrimination laws.\" The court denied Aleman and Basilis’\nmotion to add the union as a defendant in the same decision. On\nMarch 28, 2006, the district court granted summary judgment to the\ndefendants regarding Blasic’s Title VII and Section 1981 claims on\nthe grounds that Alaska Native Corporations were exempt from suit\nunder both anti-discrimination statutes. It declined supplemental juris-\ndiction over the remaining state law claims.\n\n   Aleman, Basilis, and Blasic do not now dispute that the defendants\nare immune from suit under Title VII, but they argue that the defen-\ndants are not immune from suit under Section 1981. They also argue\nthat the district court erred in dismissing the claims of Aleman and\nBasilis based upon the dispute resolution provision in their collective\n\f6                  ALEMAN v. CHUGACH SUPPORT SERVICES\nbargaining agreement, and in declining to add the union as a defen-\ndant.\n\n                                      II.\n\n                                      A.\n\n   Title VII created a new cause of action for employment discrimina-\ntion against unions, employment agencies, and any entity defined as\nan \"employer.\" The statute provides, in relevant part,\n\n        It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer\n        . . . to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual,\n        or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with\n        respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges\n        of employment, because of such individual’s race, color,\n        religion, sex, or national origin . . . .\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a). The class of employers covered by Title VII\nis restricted to persons with fifteen or more employees, and it\nexcludes bona fide private membership clubs, certain government\nentities, id. § 2000e(b), and — most relevantly — Alaska Native Cor-\nporations, 43 U.S.C. § 1626(g) (2000), and Indian tribes, 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e(b). The defendants argue that these exclusions not only bar\nsuit against Alaska Native Corporations and Indian tribes under Title\nVII, but also render such entities immune from suit under Section\n1981.\n\n   We reject this contention for two reasons. By their own terms, the\nTitle VII exclusions are limited to Title VII itself. And Section 1981\n— which the Supreme Court has instructed us to treat as a separate\nand distinct cause of action — contains no exemptions corresponding\nto those in Title VII.2\n    2\n   Because employer exemptions under Title VII do not bar suits under\nSection 1981, we need not address the plaintiffs’ contention that the\ndefendants do not qualify as Indian tribes for the purposes of Title VII’s\nemployer exemptions in any event.\n\f                ALEMAN v. CHUGACH SUPPORT SERVICES                      7\n   While the definition of \"employer\" in Title VII excludes Indian\ntribes and Alaska Native Corporations, these exclusions state that they\nare limited to the section of federal law that contains Title VII. The\nsingle-sentence exclusion for Alaska Native Corporations makes this\nclear twice, stating,\n\n    For the purposes of implementation of the Civil Rights Act\n    of 1964 [42 U.S.C. 2000a et seq.], a Native Corporation and\n    corporations, partnerships, joint ventures, trusts, or affiliates\n    in which the Native Corporation owns not less than 25 per\n    centum of the equity shall be within the class of entities\n    excluded from the definition of \"employer\" by section\n    701(b)(1) of Public Law 88-352 (78 Stat. 253), as amended\n    [42 U.S.C. § 2000e(b)(1)], or successor statutes.\n\n43 U.S.C. § 1626(g) (emphasis added). Similarly, the provision\nexcluding Indian tribes from Title VII’s definition of employer states,\n\"For the purposes of this subchapter . . . [t]he term ‘employer’ . . .\ndoes not include . . . an Indian tribe . . . .\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e (empha-\nsis added). The subchapter containing Title VII does not contain Sec-\ntion 1981.\n\n   Section 1981 contains no similar exception for Alaska Native Cor-\nporations. Its civil cause of action, enacted as part of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1866, states, \"All persons within the jurisdiction of the United\nStates shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make\nand enforce contracts . . . as is enjoyed by white citizens . . . .\" Id.\n§ 1981(a). The Supreme Court has long held the Civil Rights Act of\n1866 \"to prohibit all racial discrimination, whether or not under color\nof law, with respect to the rights enumerated therein.\" Jones v.

Congress amended the stat-\nute in 1991 to codify this understanding, stating that Section 1981\nprotects rights \"against impairment by nongovernmental discrimina-\ntion\" in addition to \"impairment under color of State law.\" 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1981(c). Section 1981 makes no mention of Alaska Native Corpora-\ntions or Indian tribes, and it includes no terms that could be construed\nto set such entities outside the statute’s reach.\n\n  Indeed, it is hard to imagine how the exclusions of Alaska Native\nCorporations and Indian tribes from Title VII’s definition of \"em-\n\f8               ALEMAN v. CHUGACH SUPPORT SERVICES\nployer\" could control under Section 1981, because Section 1981 does\nnot apply solely to employers or employment discrimination. Section\n1981’s prohibition on racial discrimination in the making and\nenforcement of contracts has long been applied to relationships far\nafield of employment.

While exclusions\nfrom the \"employer\" category are crucial for the Title VII scheme\ndirected at employment discrimination, they thus have lesser rele-\nvance under Section 1981’s extended protections.\n\n   The defendants nevertheless urge that the employer exceptions in\nTitle VII must be read broadly if they are to serve their purpose.\nWithout such a reading, Alaska Native Corporations would be immu-\nnized from suit for acts of discrimination under Title VII, but face lia-\nbility under Section 1981 for some of the same acts — a result that\ndefendants argue would strip the Title VII exemption of any meaning\nand run counter to what must have been Congress’ purpose in enact-\ning the \"employer\" exceptions. The Tenth Circuit has agreed with\ndefendants, writing that the \"specific\" provisions of Title VII must be\nunderstood to impose limits on the \"broad, general provision\" of Sec-\ntion 1981, and that Indian tribes are therefore exempt from suit for\ndiscriminatory discharge under Section 1981.

While both\nSection 1981 and Title VII provide remedies against racial discrimi-\nnation, Title VII imposes obligations that are in some ways more\nexpansive. To take the most obvious example, Title VII addresses not\nsimply discrimination based upon race or color but also discrimina-\ntion based upon \"religion, sex, or national origin.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n2(a). A legislature could easily desire to subject only certain entities\nto the additional strictures of Title VII, while leaving in place the\nmore limited cause of action in Section 1981 that has long been a part\nof our anti-discrimination law.\n\n   In addition, Title VII establishes new remedies for racial discrimi-\nnation in employment that Congress could have seen as undesirable\nfor Alaska Native Corporations. Under the Title VII framework, a\nclaimant must first lodge a charge with the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"), see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)-(f);\nGreat Am. Fed.

After lodging a charge under Title VII, however, a com-\nplainant can benefit from EEOC powers not made available by Sec-\ntion 1981. These include the agency’s ability to investigate charges\nof discrimination, its attempts to remedy noncompliance through vol-\nuntary or negotiated changes, and its authority to file a civil action\nagainst the offending party and practice itself.

CHUGACH SUPPORT SERVICES\ning these arguably more intrusive mechanisms to Alaska Native Cor-\nporations, without narrowing the scope of the longstanding,\ncomparatively bare-bones cause of action against racial discrimina-\ntion provided by Section 1981. In any event, because this is the\napproach embodied in the language of the two statutes and in the\nSupreme Court’s decisions, the district court erred in holding that\nplaintiffs could be deprived of a cause of action against Alaska Native\nCorporations under Section 1981 on the grounds that such defendants\nare not subject to suit under Title VII.\n\n   To be sure, we have recognized Indian tribal immunity as a bar to\nSection 1981 liability.

First, provisions that require arbitration of disputes\nwithout mentioning statutory claims nonetheless require arbitration of\nstatutory claims if the rest of the agreement \"makes it unmistakably\nclear\" that a violation of discrimination laws constitutes a grievance\nor dispute under the agreement. Id. at 332. Second, an agreement\nrequires arbitration of statutory discrimination claims if it contains\n\"an explicit arbitration clause\" referring to statutory claims, which\nwould require in the case of an agreement to arbitrate all federal\nemployment claims \"a clear and unmistakable provision under which\nthe employees agree to submit to arbitration all federal causes of\naction arising out of their employment.\" Id. at 331.\n\n   The collective bargaining agreement to which Aleman and Basilis\nwere subject met the Universal Maritime test. The agreement pro-\nvided mandatory dispute resolution mechanisms for grievances and\nstated, \"The parties expressly agree that a grievance shall include any\nclaim by an employee that he has been subjected to discrimination\nunder Title VII . . . and/or all other federal, state, and local anti-\ndiscrimination laws\" (emphasis added). The agreement thus satisfied\nthe requirement of \"clear and unmistakable\" waiver, notwithstanding\nplaintiffs’ suggestion, contrary to our precedent, that \"clear and\nunmistakable\" waiver requires a meeting of the minds between the\nemployer and individual union members. As Aleman and Basilis cite\nno statute or precedent that can form a basis for the new duty they\npropose, we decline to place upon employers a requirement we find\nwithout basis in law.\n\f                ALEMAN v. CHUGACH SUPPORT SERVICES                   15\n   Indeed, to the extent that the plaintiffs assert that employers must\nprovide translations of agreements on the theory that union members\nmust individually consent to the waiver of a federal forum for statu-\ntory discrimination claims, their argument is contrary to our cases\nestablishing that unions are entitled to strike bargains that require\narbitration of such claims. We have repeatedly held that such matters\nare among the subjects about which unions may bargain under the\nNational Labor Relations Act. We have observed that unions have the\nright — indeed, the duty — to bargain with employers on their mem-\nbers’ behalf over \"terms and conditions of employment,\" see 29\nU.S.C. § 158(d) (2000), and that the method through which employers\nand union members resolve disputes is a preeminent term or condition\nof employment.

Congress could do this, of\ncourse, but it has not yet done so. To hold otherwise would be too\nmuch an exercise in judicial implication. The scope of the arbitration\nprovision must be of a \"clear and unmistakable\" character no doubt,\nbut to say there can be no waiver at all is to change the nature of col-\nlective bargaining over conditions of employment and to read judicial\nexceptions into the National Labor Relations Act.\n\n                                  B.\n\n   Aleman and Basilis, however, argue that an employer’s duty to\nprovide translations of the agreement to employees with deficient\nEnglish skills renders the foregoing principles inoperative and voids\nthe collective bargaining agreement’s dispute resolution provision.\nAleman and Basilis argue that their proposed duty would be mini-\nmally disruptive because this court could simply require that \"if an\n\f16              ALEMAN v. CHUGACH SUPPORT SERVICES\nemployer has notice that certain employees cannot communicate\neffectively in English, the employer must take reasonable steps to\nensure that these employees understand the arbitration provision.\"\nReply Brief of Appellants at 20.\n\n   To begin with, the duty is much too benignly described. The\nemployer is under no remedial order, and the basis of the duty in law\nis as vague as its obligations are significant. The number of employ-\nees who could invoke this principle to escape collective bargaining\nprovisions of all sorts would be vast, since the degree of linguistic\ndeficiency needed to invoke the duty is unclear, and plaintiffs would\nevidently require employers to secure translations on behalf of\nemployees — such as themselves — who evidently speak and read\nsome English. Ostensibly, Aleman and Basilis’ proposed duty would\napply only when employers had notice of limited language skills, but\nthe plaintiffs would hold employers to be on notice of limited lan-\nguage skills even where — as here — there is no allegation that the\nplaintiffs or their union told the defendants of Aleman or Basilis’ lan-\nguage limitations.\n\n   Even if employers could determine when they were subject to this\nnew duty, it is unclear just what \"reasonable steps\" employers would\nbe required to take in order to render the negotiated collective bar-\ngaining agreement fully comprehensible and thus enforceable. Ale-\nman and Basilis offer no more than passing suggestions as to how this\nduty could be discharged, contending that perhaps employers could\nfulfill the obligation through posted translations at the work site. But\nconceivably, the new duty could require translations in many different\nlanguages, and the quality and accuracy of the translations would\nlikely be at issue. The threat of voidability under this opaque\nemployer obligation would cast a pall over collective bargaining as a\ntechnique for resolving labor disputes, for neither side could be cer-\ntain when deals would bind the parties and when they would wholly\nor partially unravel with respect to many of those they purported to\ncover.\n\n   The disruption that the plaintiffs’ proposed duty threatens is only\ncompounded by plaintiffs’ suggestion that employers could fulfill\ntheir duty of translation by ensuring that unions faithfully communi-\ncated the contents of collective bargaining agreements to union mem-\n\f                 ALEMAN v. CHUGACH SUPPORT SERVICES                       17\nbers.

Unions and employers may well disagree on\nthe nature of collective bargaining agreement obligations, and encour-\naging excessive employer involvement in union affairs may generate\n\"collateral issues\" which might themselves \"become the source of dis-\npute and litigation.\" Id. By suggesting that internal union matters,\nincluding unions’ internal communications, can affect the validity of\na collective bargaining agreement, the plaintiffs would force employ-\ners to engage in intrusive oversight of their bargaining partners.\n\n   The proposed employer duty to provide union members with col-\nlective bargaining agreement translations is fraught with problems\nthat only Congress or other policy-making bodies could sort out.\nWhatever duty might arise in this regard between unions and their\nmembers is a question that is not before us.5 See Zamora v.

The agreement sets forth\nmandatory dispute resolution procedures for any \"grievance . . . aris-\ning during the term of this Agreement\" between an employer and a\nunion member, including \"any claim by an employee that he has been\nsubjected to discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964, as amended, . . . and/or all other federal, state, and local anti-\ndiscrimination laws.\" The \"term of the agreement\" is defined repeat-\nedly as May 1, 2001 until April 30, 2004 — a period that includes all\nthe time Aleman and Basilis worked for CSS. This period is set out\ntwice on the agreement’s initial page, which contains the dates \"May\n1, 2001 - April 30, 2004\" near the top of the pact, above the word\n\"Agreement.\" The agreement goes on to state:\n\n     The undersigned employer accepts each and every provision\n     of the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Con-\n\ning new claims against a new party with now-dismissed claims would\nnot promote the above objectives and the district court did not err in\ndenying leave to amend.\n  Since the motion to add the union as a defendant was properly denied,\nwe express no view on any possible claim that Aleman and Basilis might\nhave against their union.\n\f                ALEMAN v.

Representatives of CSS and the union did not sign\nthe agreement until July of 2003, as Aleman and Basilis note, but the\nagreement does not define its scope according to the dates of signing.\nAnd while Aleman and Basilis observe that they did not themselves\njoin the union until August of 2003, when they did so, they bound\nthemselves to arbitrate any grievances arising during the term of the\nagreement as repeatedly set forth in the agreement’s text.
