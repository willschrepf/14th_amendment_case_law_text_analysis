class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>            </span>Urban Retreat, a </span><span>Houston</span><span> day spa,\r\nhad its genesis in 1989 through the planning of its visionary, Mike Willis, a </span><span>Houston</span><span>\r\nbusinessman.<span>  </span>He and a hired consultant,\r\nRichard Hite, located a site for the spa adjacent to an exclusive neighborhood,\r\nnegotiated a lease for the property, and obtained a loan to renovate the\r\nfacility.<span>  </span>Willis also formed two\r\ncorporations, Urban Retreat of Houston, Inc. (the day spa, hereinafter “URB”)\r\nand Willis Hite Enterprises, Inc. (envisioned as a management business for a\r\nchain of spas, hereinafter “WHE”).<sup><span><sup><span>[1]</span></sup></span></sup><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>            </span>Having created the shell of Urban\r\nRetreat, Willis needed only to find staff and clientele.<span>  </span>To this end, Hite approached Dan Donnelly, a\r\npopular hairstylist and president of an established local salon.<span>  </span>Willis and Hite suggested that Donnelly could\r\ntransfer his clientele and staff to the soon-to-open day spa.<span>  </span>Donnelly would manage the spa, continue his\r\nhairstyling business, and strive to increase business.<span>  </span>In exchange, if certain longevity or gross\r\nrevenue goals were met, Donnelly would gain ownership in URB and WHE, an\r\nincrease in salary, and a seat on <span class=\"SpellE\">WHE’s</span> board of\r\ndirectors.<span>  </span>Willis personally assured\r\nDonnelly that he would provide the financial backing for the business.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>            </span>Donnelly executed a Letter Agreement\r\non July 10, 1989, which set forth the levels of URB and WHE stock ownership and\r\nsalary he would attain over the years: (1) 25% URB stock and 10% of WHE stock\r\nafter 12 months’ employment or when the spa’s gross revenues equaled those made\r\nin Donnelly’s salon the prior year; (2) annual increases of URB stock, up to\r\n50%, contingent on yearly half-million-dollar gains in gross revenues; (3)\r\n$110,000 salary for two years; and (4) five percent of gross revenues as salary\r\nin year three and beyond.<span>  </span>The Letter\r\nAgreement also provided each shareholder the right of first refusal to purchase\r\nanother shareholder’s stock.<span>  </span>Further, it\r\nset forth the value of Donnelly’s shares should his employment terminate:<span>  </span>the greater of two times earnings in the\r\nprior year or assets minus liabilities.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>            </span>Donnelly transferred his profitable\r\nbusiness to URB, bringing several hairstylists, manicurists, and other salon\r\npersonnel with him.<span>  </span>URB held its grand\r\nopening in mid-December 1989.<span>  </span>The gross\r\nrevenues soon surpassed those of Donnelly’s previous salon.<span>  </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>            </span>However, Urban Retreat’s costs were\r\ngreat, and the construction expense had exceeded projections.<span>  </span>Further, Willis and one other minimal\r\nshareholder had provided only $1,000 as capital contribution.<span>  </span>The $800,000 construction loan was in <span class=\"SpellE\">URB’s</span> name, although Willis provided a $600,000 certificate\r\nof deposit as collateral.<span>  </span>Additionally,\r\nalthough Willis personally transferred almost $297,000 to URB, he listed it as\r\na loan instead of capital contribution.<sup><span><sup><span>[2]</span></sup></span></sup><span>  </span>Thus, just six weeks after its grand opening,\r\nURB was over $1,000,000 in debt.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>            </span>Willis quickly recognized the need\r\nto “stop the bleeding.”<span>  </span>There is\r\nevidence that he proposed suspending Hite’s $7,000 a month salary even before\r\nthe grand opening.<span>  </span>He also considered\r\ntransferring Hite’s employment to WHE instead of URB.<span>  </span>In early 1990, Hite left Urban Retreat.<sup><span><sup><span>[3]</span></sup></span></sup><span>  </span>On </span><span>January 1, 1990</span><span>, just two weeks after the spa\r\nopening, the minimal shareholder transferred his 100 shares to Willis, leaving\r\nWillis the sole shareholder of <span class=\"SpellE\">URB’s</span> 1,000 issued\r\nshares.<sup><span><sup><span>[4]</span></sup></span></sup><span>  </span>In April 1990, Willis hired a second\r\nconsultant as <span class=\"SpellE\">URB’s</span> “non-operating chief financial\r\nofficer.”<span>  </span>Willis promised to sell this\r\nman 25% of URB stock for $1 after Willis’s “capital investment” had been\r\nrepaid.<span>  </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>            </span>Nonetheless, URB continued to lose\r\nmoney.<span>  </span>Willis was thus faced with a\r\nfinancial quandary:<span>  </span>he had personally\r\nguaranteed <span class=\"SpellE\">URB’s</span> $14,000 a month lease, pledged his\r\n$600,000 CD as collateral for the construction loan, and invested $540,500 of\r\ncash by </span><span>December\r\n 31, 1990</span><span>.<span>  </span>If URB did\r\nnot meet its outside financial obligations, Willis would personally lose a\r\nlarge amount of money.<span>  </span>The Letter\r\nAgreement with Donnelly added to the financial quagmire.<span>  </span>It prevented Willis from firing Donnelly\r\nwithin the first 12 months of business, except for gross misconduct.<span>   </span>It also guaranteed Donnelly’s stock\r\nownership at the 12-month mark because gross revenues were on track.<span>  </span>After 12 months, Willis could fire Donnelly\r\nand his shares would be worthless under the Termination provision of the Letter\r\nAgreement.<span>  </span>However, Donnelly was by far\r\nthe greatest revenue producer in the spa.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>            </span>In March 1991 (after Donnelly met\r\nrevenue goals ensuring him 25% URB stock and 10% WHE stock), Willis sought to\r\nchange Donnelly’s status.<span>  </span>Willis was no\r\nlonger willing to provide 100% of the financing unless he was still “100%\r\nowner.”<span>  </span>He wanted Donnelly to “step up”\r\nand “act like an owner.”<span>  </span>Legal documents\r\nwere prepared, but never signed, capping Donnelly’s ownership at 25% of URB\r\nstock and rescinding the Letter Agreement.<span> \r\n</span>Willis also wanted Donnelly to assume some of the debt, but Donnelly\r\ndeclined to do so.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>            </span>Certainly, it made good business\r\nsense for Willis to minimize his potential losses and work towards\r\nprofitability.<span>  </span>However, Willis then\r\ncontinued to control Urban Retreat in disregard of Donnelly throughout the\r\nyears.<span>  </span>He rationalized that Donnelly had\r\nrelinquished ownership when he refused to “act like an owner.”<span>  </span>When Donnelly asked about stock issuance,\r\nWillis would assure him that he intended to live up to the Letter Agreement,\r\nbut asked to delay until the business “turned the corner.”<span>  </span>At the same time, Willis continued to use URB\r\nas a wholly-owned, sub-chapter S-corporation for tax benefits.<span>  </span>Willis also unilaterally cut Donnelly’s\r\nsalary<sup><span><sup><span>[5]</span></sup></span></sup> in\r\nMarch 1992, supposedly temporarily, and diminished his management\r\nresponsibilities.<span>  </span>Willis continued to\r\nmake “loans” to URB although there is no evidence such loans were approved by\r\nthe board of directors.<sup><span><sup><span>[6]</span></sup></span></sup><span>  </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>            </span>Additionally, Willis controlled\r\nUrban Retreat through his wife, <span class=\"SpellE\">Francie</span>.<span>  </span>He supposedly transferred all of his URB\r\nstock to her.<span>  </span>A “unanimous consent of\r\nthe board” was prepared in March 1991, but never signed, reflecting <span class=\"SpellE\">URB’s</span> permission for <span class=\"SpellE\">Francie</span> to\r\nconvey to Willis a beneficial interest in <span class=\"SpellE\">URB’s</span>\r\noption to buy its realty.<span>  </span>Then, on </span><span>July 30, 1992</span><span>, Willis\r\nand <span class=\"SpellE\">Francie</span> personally purchased the URB realty for\r\n$1.6 million.<span>  </span>On that day, <span class=\"SpellE\">Francie</span>, acting as president, signed a waiver of <span class=\"SpellE\">URB’s</span> option.<span>  </span>Included\r\nin the waiver was the statement that a “third party” wished to buy the realty\r\nand that “said third party has required a release” of <span class=\"SpellE\">URB’s</span>\r\noption.<span>  </span>One week after closing, the <span class=\"SpellE\">Willises</span> amended <span class=\"SpellE\">URB’s</span> lease,\r\nincreasing its total rent over the lease term by $280,000.<span>  </span><span class=\"SpellE\">URB’s</span> monthly rent\r\nof $14,000 remained the same, though the <span class=\"SpellE\">Willises</span>’\r\nmonthly note was then only $10,800.<span> \r\n</span>Further, in the new lease, the <span class=\"SpellE\">Willises</span>\r\nobligated URB to pay the property taxes.<span> \r\n</span>Finally, in March 1993, <span class=\"SpellE\">Francie</span> signed a\r\npromissory note on behalf of URB, documenting that it owed her husband\r\n$1,897,896 in loans.<sup><span><sup><span>[7]</span></sup></span></sup><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>            </span>Over these years, Donnelly’s\r\npersonal hairstyling revenues had increased, as did the overall gross revenues\r\nof the spa.<span>  </span>In fact, every revenue goal\r\nin the Letter Agreement was met.<span>  </span>Each\r\ntime he asked about his stock, Willis would assure Donnelly that he would live\r\nup to the agreement.<span>  </span>Finally, in late\r\nNovember 1994, <span class=\"SpellE\">Francie</span> learned that Donnelly was\r\nhelping a friend plan a new day spa.<span> \r\n</span>When she learned of this, she asked Donnelly to leave Urban Retreat. <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span><span>                                                          </span>B.<span>  </span>Loans to Donnelly<p></p></span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>            </span>In January 1992, Donnelly asked\r\nWillis to borrow $18,000.<span>  </span>He signed a\r\npromissory note for that amount at eight percent annual interest, to be repaid\r\n$500 a month from Donnelly’s paychecks.<span> \r\n</span>On </span><span>July 1,\r\n 1993</span><span>, Willis loaned Donnelly an additional $20,000.<span>  </span>He rolled the previous note into the second,\r\nfor a total principal of<span>  </span>$31,183.70, at\r\neight percent annual interest, to be repaid from Donnelly’s paychecks.<span>  </span>The entire amount would become due if Donnelly’s\r\nemployment at URB terminated.<span>  </span>After\r\nNovember 1994, Donnelly stopped paying the loan.<span>  </span><span class=\"SpellE\">Francie</span> sent him a\r\ndemand letter, wishing him well in his new endeavor and urging him to “honor\r\nthe trust that Mike [Willis] placed in you.”<span> \r\n</span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p

the\r\noutstanding $26,982.58.<span>  </span>Donnelly\r\nreciprocated by suing Willis, <span class=\"SpellE\">Francie</span>, URB, and WHE\r\nfor breach of the Letter Agreement and breach of fiduciary duty, among other\r\nclaims.<span>  </span>The jury ultimately found that\r\nURB and WHE breached the Letter Agreement; Willis and <span class=\"SpellE\">Francie</span>\r\nratified it; Donnelly was entitled to 50% of URB stock and 10% of WHE stock;\r\nand that contract damages were $1.7 million.<span> \r\n</span>The jury further found that Willis had breached his fiduciary duty to\r\nDonnelly and that those damages were $1.7 million.<span>  </span>The jury rejected limitations questions for\r\nboth issues.<span>  </span>As for the loans to\r\nDonnelly, the jury found that he defaulted on the promissory note and owed\r\n$26,982.56 to Willis.<span>  </span>Finally, the jury\r\nawarded both sides $400,000 in attorney’s fees.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p

</span><span>Houston</span><span>\r\nbusinessman.<span>  </span>He and a hired consultant,\r\nRichard Hite, located a site for the spa adjacent to an exclusive neighborhood,\r\nnegotiated a lease for the property, and obtained a loan to renovate the\r\nfacility.<span>  </span>Willis also formed two\r\ncorporations, Urban Retreat of Houston, Inc. (the day spa, hereinafter “URB”)\r\nand Willis Hite Enterprises, Inc. (envisioned as a management business for a\r\nchain of spas, hereinafter “WHE”).<sup><span><sup><span>[1]</span></sup></span></sup><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>            </span>Having created the shell of Urban\r\nRetreat, Willis needed only to find staff and clientele.<span>  </span>To this end, Hite approached Dan Donnelly, a\r\npopular hairstylist and president of an established local salon.<span>  </span>Willis and Hite suggested that Donnelly could\r\ntransfer his clientele and staff to the soon-to-open day spa.<span>  </span>Donnelly would manage the spa, continue his\r\nhairstyling business, and strive to increase business.<span>  </span>In exchange, if certain longevity or gross\r\nrevenue goals were met, Donnelly would gain ownership in URB and WHE, an\r\nincrease in salary, and a seat on <span class=\"SpellE\">WHE’s</span> board of\r\ndirectors.<span>  </span>Willis personally assured\r\nDonnelly that he would provide the financial backing for the business.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>            </span>Donnelly executed a Letter Agreement\r\non July 10, 1989, which set forth the levels of URB and WHE stock ownership and\r\nsalary he would attain over the years: (1) 25% URB stock and 10% of WHE stock\r\nafter 12 months’ employment or when the spa’s gross revenues equaled those made\r\nin Donnelly’s salon the prior year; (2) annual increases of URB stock, up to\r\n50%, contingent on yearly half-million-dollar gains in gross revenues; (3)\r\n$110,000 salary for two years; and (4) five percent of gross revenues as salary\r\nin year three and beyond.<span>  </span>The Letter\r\nAgreement also provided each shareholder the right of first refusal to purchase\r\nanother shareholder’s stock.<span>  </span>Further, it\r\nset forth the value of Donnelly’s shares should his employment terminate:<span>  </span>the greater of two times earnings in the\r\nprior year or assets minus liabilities.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>            </span>Donnelly transferred his profitable\r\nbusiness to URB, bringing several hairstylists, manicurists, and other salon\r\npersonnel with him.<span>  </span>URB held its grand\r\nopening in mid-December 1989.<span>  </span>The gross\r\nrevenues soon surpassed those of Donnelly’s previous salon.<span>  </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>            </span>However, Urban Retreat’s costs were\r\ngreat, and the construction expense had exceeded projections.<span>  </span>Further, Willis and one other minimal\r\nshareholder had provided only $1,000 as capital contribution.<span>  </span>The $800,000 construction loan was in <span class=\"SpellE\">URB’s</span> name, although Willis provided a $600,000 certificate\r\nof deposit as collateral.<span>  </span>Additionally,\r\nalthough Willis personally transferred almost $297,000 to URB, he listed it as\r\na loan instead of capital contribution.<sup><span><sup><span>[2]</span></sup></span></sup><span>  </span>Thus, just six weeks after its grand opening,\r\nURB was over $1,000,000 in debt.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>            </span>Willis quickly recognized the need\r\nto “stop the bleeding.”<span>  </span>There is\r\nevidence that he proposed suspending Hite’s $7,000 a month salary even before\r\nthe grand opening.<span>  </span>He also considered\r\ntransferring Hite’s employment to WHE instead of URB.<span>  </span>In early 1990, Hite left Urban Retreat.<sup><span><sup><span>[3]</span></sup></span></sup><span>  </span>On </span><span>January 1, 1990</span><span>, just two weeks after the spa\r\nopening, the minimal shareholder transferred his 100 shares to Willis, leaving\r\nWillis the sole shareholder of <span class=\"SpellE\">URB’s</span> 1,000 issued\r\nshares.<sup><span><sup><span>[4]</span></sup></span></sup><span>  </span>In April 1990, Willis hired a second\r\nconsultant as <span class=\"SpellE\">URB’s</span> “non-operating chief financial\r\nofficer.”<span>  </span>Willis promised to sell this\r\nman 25% of URB stock for $1 after Willis’s “capital investment” had been\r\nrepaid.<span>  </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>            </span>Nonetheless, URB continued to lose\r\nmoney.<span>  </span>Willis was thus faced with a\r\nfinancial quandary:<span>  </span>he had personally\r\nguaranteed <span class=\"SpellE\">URB’s</span> $14,000 a month lease, pledged his\r\n$600,000 CD as collateral for the construction loan, and invested $540,500 of\r\ncash by </span><span>December\r\n 31, 1990</span><span>.<span>  </span>If URB did\r\nnot meet its outside financial obligations, Willis would personally lose a\r\nlarge amount of money.<span>  </span>The Letter\r\nAgreement with Donnelly added to the financial quagmire.<span>  </span>It prevented Willis from firing Donnelly\r\nwithin the first 12 months of business, except for gross misconduct.<span>   </span>It also guaranteed Donnelly’s stock\r\nownership at the 12-month mark because gross revenues were on track.<span>  </span>After 12 months, Willis could fire Donnelly\r\nand his shares would be worthless under the Termination provision of the Letter\r\nAgreement.<span>  </span>However, Donnelly was by far\r\nthe greatest revenue producer in the spa.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>            </span>In March 1991 (after Donnelly met\r\nrevenue goals ensuring him 25% URB stock and 10% WHE stock), Willis sought to\r\nchange Donnelly’s status.<span>  </span>Willis was no\r\nlonger willing to provide 100% of the financing unless he was still “100%\r\nowner.”<span>  </span>He wanted Donnelly to “step up”\r\nand “act like an owner.”<span>  </span>Legal documents\r\nwere prepared, but never signed, capping Donnelly’s ownership at 25% of URB\r\nstock and rescinding the Letter Agreement.<span> \r\n</span>Willis also wanted Donnelly to assume some of the debt, but Donnelly\r\ndeclined to do so.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>            </span>Certainly, it made good business\r\nsense for Willis to minimize his potential losses and work towards\r\nprofitability.<span>  </span>However, Willis then\r\ncontinued to control Urban Retreat in disregard of Donnelly throughout the\r\nyears.<span>  </span>He rationalized that Donnelly had\r\nrelinquished ownership when he refused to “act like an owner.”<span>  </span>When Donnelly asked about stock issuance,\r\nWillis would assure him that he intended to live up to the Letter Agreement,\r\nbut asked to delay until the business “turned the corner.”<span>  </span>At the same time, Willis continued to use URB\r\nas a wholly-owned, sub-chapter S-corporation for tax benefits.<span>  </span>Willis also unilaterally cut Donnelly’s\r\nsalary<sup><span><sup><span>[5]</span></sup></span></sup> in\r\nMarch 1992, supposedly temporarily, and diminished his management\r\nresponsibilities.<span>  </span>Willis continued to\r\nmake “loans” to URB although there is no evidence such loans were approved by\r\nthe board of directors.<sup><span><sup><span>[6]</span></sup></span></sup><span>  </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>            </span>Additionally, Willis controlled\r\nUrban Retreat through his wife, <span class=\"SpellE\">Francie</span>.<span>  </span>He supposedly transferred all of his URB\r\nstock to her.<span>  </span>A “unanimous consent of\r\nthe board” was prepared in March 1991, but never signed, reflecting <span class=\"SpellE\">URB’s</span> permission for <span class=\"SpellE\">Francie</span> to\r\nconvey to Willis a beneficial interest in <span class=\"SpellE\">URB’s</span>\r\noption to buy its realty.<span>  </span>Then, on </span><span>July 30, 1992</span><span>, Willis\r\nand <span class=\"SpellE\">Francie</span> personally purchased the URB realty for\r\n$1.6 million.<span>  </span>On that day, <span class=\"SpellE\">Francie</span>, acting as president, signed a waiver of <span class=\"SpellE\">URB’s</span> option.<span>  </span>Included\r\nin the waiver was the statement that a “third party” wished to buy the realty\r\nand that “said third party has required a release” of <span class=\"SpellE\">URB’s</span>\r\noption.<span>  </span>One week after closing, the <span class=\"SpellE\">Willises</span> amended <span class=\"SpellE\">URB’s</span> lease,\r\nincreasing its total rent over the lease term by $280,000.<span>  </span><span class=\"SpellE\">URB’s</span> monthly rent\r\nof $14,000 remained the same, though the <span class=\"SpellE\">Willises</span>’\r\nmonthly note was then only $10,800.<span> \r\n</span>Further, in the new lease, the <span class=\"SpellE\">Willises</span>\r\nobligated URB to pay the property taxes.<span> \r\n</span>Finally, in March 1993, <span class=\"SpellE\">Francie</span> signed a\r\npromissory note on behalf of URB, documenting that it owed her husband\r\n$1,897,896 in loans.<sup><span><sup><span>[7]</span></sup></span></sup><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>            </span>Over these years, Donnelly’s\r\npersonal hairstyling revenues had increased, as did the overall gross revenues\r\nof the spa.<span>  </span>In fact, every revenue goal\r\nin the Letter Agreement was met.<span>  </span>Each\r\ntime he asked about his stock, Willis would assure Donnelly that he would live\r\nup to the agreement.<span>  </span>Finally, in late\r\nNovember 1994, <span class=\"SpellE\">Francie</span> learned that Donnelly was\r\nhelping a friend plan a new day spa.<span> \r\n</span>When she learned of this, she asked Donnelly to leave Urban Retreat. <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p

class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>            </span>In January 1992, Donnelly asked\r\nWillis to borrow $18,000.<span>  </span>He signed a\r\npromissory note for that amount at eight percent annual interest, to be repaid\r\n$500 a month from Donnelly’s paychecks.<span> \r\n</span>On </span><span>July 1,\r\n 1993</span><span>, Willis loaned Donnelly an additional $20,000.<span>  </span>He rolled the previous note into the second,\r\nfor a total principal of<span>  </span>$31,183.70, at\r\neight percent annual interest, to be repaid from Donnelly’s paychecks.<span>  </span>The entire amount would become due if Donnelly’s\r\nemployment at URB terminated.<span>  </span>After\r\nNovember 1994, Donnelly stopped paying the loan.<span>  </span><span class=\"SpellE\">Francie</span> sent him
