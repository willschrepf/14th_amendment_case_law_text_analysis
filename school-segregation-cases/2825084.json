Madison, a convict held in a Virginia Department\nof Corrections prison, was denied his requests for kosher meals that\nhe claims his religious beliefs require. He sued the Commonwealth of\nVirginia and officials of the Virginia Department of Corrections,\nalleging among other claims a violation of section 3 of the Religious\nLand Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA). The\ndistrict court ruled that the provision had an impermissible effect of\nadvancing religion under the second prong of the Lemon test. See\nLemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 612-13 (1971). Because we find\nthat Congress can accommodate religion in section 3 of RLUIPA\nwithout violating the Establishment Clause, we reverse. To hold oth-\nerwise and find an Establishment Clause violation would severely\nundermine the ability of our society to accommodate the most basic\nrights of conscience and belief in neutral yet constructive ways.\n\f4                          MADISON v. RITER\n                                    I.\n\n                                   A.\n\n   From 2000 to the present, Madison has claimed to be a member of\nthe Church of God and Saints of Christ, a congregation founded in\n1896 and headquartered at Temple Beth El in Suffolk, Virginia.\nChurch members are commonly known as Hebrew Israelites, and they\nclaim to be \"followers of the anointed God\" who honor but do not\nworship Jesus Christ. Most importantly for purposes of this case,\nMadison’s church requires its members to abide by the dietary laws\nlaid out in the Hebrew Scriptures.\n\n   The parties dispute the timing of Madison’s conversion and his\naffiliation with a wide range of other religious groups during his\nincarceration. What is clear is that in July 2000 and again in March\n2001, Madison informed correctional officials that his religious\nbeliefs required him to receive a kosher diet, defined as a \"common\nfare diet\" by the Virginia Department of Corrections. Both requests\nwere approved by local prison officials, but denied by Department of\nCorrections administrators in Richmond. The Commonwealth\nrejected Madison’s requests because it determined that Madison\nalready had adequate alternatives from the regular, vegetarian, and no\npork daily menus; because it doubted the sincerity of Madison’s reli-\ngious beliefs; and because it considered Madison’s history of disci-\nplinary problems.\n\n   In August 2001, Madison challenged the denial of his request in\ndistrict court, relying in part on section 3 of RLUIPA. Section 3(a) of\nRLUIPA states that \"[n]o government shall impose a substantial bur-\nden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an\ninstitution . . . even if the burden results from a rule of general appli-\ncability, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the\nburden on that person — (1) is in furtherance of a compelling govern-\nment interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that\ncompelling government interest.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(a) (2000).\nSection 3(b) of RLUIPA states that Section 3(a) applies whenever the\nsubstantial burden at issue \"is imposed in a program or activity that\nreceives Federal financial assistance.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(b)(1). In\n2002 the Commonwealth Department of Corrections received $4.72\n\f                            MADISON v. RITER                             5\nmillion — approximately 0.5% of its budget — from the federal gov-\nernment, thus triggering the statute’s applicability. Madison’s lawsuit\nrelied on section 4(a) of RLUIPA, which creates a private right of\naction that allows any person to \"assert a violation of this chapter as\na claim or defense in a judicial proceeding\" and to \"obtain appropriate\nrelief against a government.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-2(a).\n\n  The district court denied Madison’s motion for summary judgment\nconcerning his constitutional claims on August 23, 2002, and it\ndeferred ruling on his RLUIPA claim pending briefing and argument\non the statute’s constitutionality. The district court also granted the\nUnited States leave to intervene to defend the statute, pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. § 2403(a).\n\n   On January 23, 2003, the district court found that section 3 of\nRLUIPA impermissibly advanced religion by offering greater legisla-\ntive protection to the religious rights of prisoners than to other funda-\nmental rights that were similarly burdened. See Madison v. Riter, 240\nF. Supp. 2d 566, 577 (W.D. Va. 2003). The district court therefore\nrejected Madison’s statutory claim, and simultaneously certified the\nquestion of RLUIPA’s constitutionality for interlocutory appeal under\n28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). Madison and the United States filed timely peti-\ntions with this court to appeal the order, and their petitions were\ngranted.\n\n                                    B.\n\n   The legislative and judicial background that led to RLUIPA’s\nenactment are important for considering Madison’s appeal. Congress\ncrafted RLUIPA to conform to the Supreme Court’s decisions in\nEmployment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), and City of\nBoerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507 (1997). In Smith, the Court held that\nlaws of general applicability that incidentally burden religious con-\nduct do not offend the First Amendment. See 494 U.S. at 890. The\nneutrality principle in Smith largely complemented the traditional def-\nerence that courts afford to prison regulations that impose burdens on\nprisoners’ rights. See Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89-90 (1987).1 At\n  1\n   Turner v. Safley laid out a four-factor \"rational-relationship\" test for\nanalyzing the constitutionality of regulations that burden prisoners’ fun-\n\f6                           MADISON v. RITER\nthe same time, however, the Smith Court openly invited the political\nbranches to provide greater protection to religious exercise through\nlegislative action. See 494 U.S. at 890.\n\n   In 1993, Congress responded to Smith by enacting the Religious\nFreedom Restoration Act (\"RFRA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb et seq.,\nwhich Congress claimed was premised on its remedial powers under\nsection 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. RFRA prohibited federal and\nstate governments from \"substantially burden[ing]\" a person’s exer-\ncise of religion, even as the result of a law of general applicability,\nunless the government could demonstrate that the burden \"(1) is in\nfurtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least\nrestrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental inter-\nest.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(a)-(b).\n\n   The Supreme Court’s decision in City of Boerne v. Flores, 521\nU.S. 507 (1997), invalidated RFRA as it applied to states and locali-\nties. The Court held that the scope of the statute exceeded Congress’s\nremedial powers under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. See\n521 U.S. at 532-36.\n\n  While RFRA continued to apply to the federal government, see\nGuam v. Guerrero, 290 F.3d 1210, 1221 (9th Cir. 2002); O’Bryan v.\nBureau of Prisons, No. 02-4012, 2003 WL 22533454, at *2 (7th Cir.\n\ndamental rights. 482 U.S. at 89-90. Under Turner, courts must consider\n(1) whether a \"valid, rational connection [exists] between the prison reg-\nulation and the legitimate governmental interest put forward to justify it,\"\n(2) whether \"alternative means of exercising the right [exist] that remain\nopen to prison inmates,\" (3) what \"impact accommodation of the asserted\nconstitutional right will have on guards and other inmates, and on the\nallocation of prison resources generally,\" and (4) whether there was an\n\"absence of ready alternatives\" to the regulation in question. Id. State and\nlocal prison regulations that burden prisoners’ religious exercise have\nbeen subject to this rational-relationship test. See O’Lone v. Estate of\nShabazz, 482 U.S. 342, 349-50 (1987); see also In re Long Term Admin-\nistrative Segregation of Inmates Designated as Five Percenters, 174 F.3d\n464, 468-69 (4th Cir. 1999); Hines v. South Carolina Dept. of Correc-\ntions, 148 F.3d 353, 357 (4th Cir. 1998). The deferential test that courts\ncustomarily apply to prison regulations, however, does not operate to\nprevent legislative bodies from adopting a more searching standard.\n\f                           MADISON v. RITER                            7\nNov. 10, 2003), in September 2000, Congress attempted to reinstate\nRFRA’s protection against government burdens on religious exercise\nimposed by states and localities by enacting the Religious Land Use\nand Institutionalized Persons Act (\"RLUIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc et\nseq. This statute mirrored the provisions of RFRA, but its scope was\nlimited to laws and regulations concerning land use and institutional-\nized persons. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(a). RLUIPA’s enactment was\npremised on congressional findings similar to those made for RFRA,\nnamely, that in the absence of federal legislation, prisoners, detainees,\nand institutionalized mental health patients faced substantial burdens\nin practicing their religious faiths. See Joint Statement of Senator\nHatch and Senator Kennedy, 146 Cong. Rec. S7774-01 (daily ed. July\n27, 2000).\n\n   In passing RLUIPA, Congress sought to avoid Boerne’s constitu-\ntional barrier by relying on its Spending and Commerce Clause pow-\ners, rather than on its remedial powers under section 5 of the\nFourteenth Amendment as it had in RFRA. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-\n1(b)(1) (establishing that Section 3 of RLUIPA applies whenever the\nburden at issue \"is imposed in a program or activity that receives Fed-\neral financial assistance\"); 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(b)(2) (establishing\nthat section 3 of RLUIPA applies in cases in which \"the substantial\nburden [on religion] affects, or removal of that substantial burden\nwould affect, commerce with foreign nations, among the several\nStates, or with Indian tribes\").\n\n                                   II.\n\n   Among its numerous constitutional challenges to RLUIPA, the\nCommonwealth contends that the statute violates the Establishment\nClause. The district court held that section 3 of RLUIPA violates the\nEstablishment Clause because it singled out the religious exercise\nrights of prisoners for special protection. The district court explained:\n\n    [P]rison inmates exist in a society of universally limited\n    rights, one that is required by the nature of the institution.\n    When Congress acts to lift the limitations on one right while\n    ignoring all others, it abandons a position of neutrality\n    towards these rights, placing its power behind one system of\n    belief.\n\f8                          MADISON v. RITER\nMadison, 240 F. Supp. 2d at 577. The district court stated that \"the\npractical effect of RLUIPA on the prison system in the United States\nis to grant religious and professed religious inmates a multitude of\nexceptions and benefits not available to non-believers.\" Id. at 580. It\nconcluded that \"RLUIPA extends far beyond regulations targeting\nreligion, protecting religious inmates against even generally applica-\nble and facially neutral prison regulations that have a substantial\neffect on a multitude of fundamental rights.\" Id. at 575-76.\n\n   Because Congress had failed to compile \"demonstrable evidence\nthat religious constitutional rights are at any greater risk of depriva-\ntion in the prison system than other fundamental rights,\" id. at 575,\nthe district court found that protecting the religious exercise of prison-\ners violated the Establishment Clause. It concluded that this provision\nsends \"non-religious inmates a message that they are outsiders of a\nprivileged community,\" id. at 580, and it unconstitutionally advanced\nreligion by providing an inmate with incentives to \"claim religious\nrebirth and cloak himself in the protections of RLUIPA.\" Id.\n\n   The district court’s decision is at odds with two other circuits that\nhave examined this question and found that section 3 of RLUIPA\ndoes not violate the Establishment Clause. See, e.g., Charles v. Verha-\ngan, No. 02-3572, 2003 WL 22455960, at *6-7 (7th Cir. Oct. 30,\n2003); Mayweathers v. Newland, 314 F.3d 1062, 1068-69 (9th Cir.\n2002), cert. denied, No. 02-1655, 2003 WL 21180348 (U.S. Oct. 6,\n2003); see also Williams v. Bitner, No. CV-01-2271, 2003 WL\n22272302, at *4-5 (M.D. Pa. Sept. 30, 2003). Courts have also\nrejected similar Establishment Clause challenges to the Religious\nFreedom Restoration Act, whose religious accommodation provisions\nare identical to section 3 of RLUIPA. See, e.g., In Re Young, 141 F.3d\n854, 862-63 (8th Cir. 1998); Mockaitis v. Harcleroad, 104 F.3d 1522,\n1530 (9th Cir. 1997); Sasnett v. Sullivan, 91 F.3d 1018, 1022 (7th Cir.\n1996); EEOC v. Catholic. Univ. of Am., 83 F.3d 455, 470 (D.C. Cir.\n1996); Flores v. City of Boerne, 73 F.3d 1352, 1364 (5th Cir. 1996),\nrev’d on other grounds, 521 U.S. 507 (1997). One circuit court, how-\never, has relied extensively upon the district court’s decision in this\ncase to hold that section 3 of RLUIPA does violate the Establishment\nClause. See Cutter v. Wilkinson, No. 02-3270, 2003 WL 22513973,\nat *4-9 (6th Cir. Nov. 7, 2003). It is this conclusion that we must\naddress with care.\n\f                           MADISON v. RITER                             9\n   This court must review de novo the constitutionality of a federal\nlaw. See United States v. Buculei, 262 F.3d 322, 327 (4th Cir. 2001);\nFarmer v. Employment Security Commission of North Carolina, 4\nF.3d 1274, 1279 (4th Cir. 1993). The basic framework for Establish-\nment Clause challenges is well-settled: \"[f]irst the [targeted] statute\nmust have a secular legislative purpose; second, its principal or pri-\nmary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion;\nfinally, the statute must not foster an excessive government entangle-\nment with religion.\" Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 612-13\n(1971) (internal and quotations omitted). We address each of the three\nLemon prongs in turn.\n\n                                   A.\n\n   We first consider whether section 3 of RLUIPA has a legitimate\nsecular purpose. Lemon, 403 U.S. at 612-13. We are guided here by\nthe Supreme Court’s decision in Corporation of the Presiding Bishop\nv. Amos, which established that Congress may accommodate the exer-\ncise of faith by lifting government-imposed burdens on free exercise.\n483 U.S. 327, 335 (1987). The Amos Court stated that the Establish-\nment Clause seeks to prevent government decisionmakers \"from\nabandoning neutrality and acting with the intent of promoting a par-\nticular point of view in religious matters.\" Id. But in commanding\nneutrality, the Establishment Clause does not require the government\nto be oblivious to the burdens that state action may impose upon reli-\ngious practice and belief. Rather, there is \"ample room under the\nEstablishment Clause for ‘benevolent neutrality which will permit\nreligious exercise to exist without sponsorship and without interfer-\nence.’\" Board of Educ. of Kiryas Joel Village Sch. Dist. v. Grumet,\n512 U.S. 687, 705 (1994) (quoting Amos, 483 U.S. at 334). The\nSupreme Court therefore held in Amos that \"it is a permissible legisla-\ntive purpose to alleviate significant governmental interference with\nthe ability of religious organizations to define and carry out their reli-\ngious missions.\" Amos, 483 U.S. at 335.\n\n   This alleviation of government burdens on prisoners’ religious\nexercise is precisely the legitimate secular purpose that RLUIPA\nseeks to advance. RLUIPA is not designed to advance a particular\nreligious viewpoint or even religion in general, but rather to facilitate\nopportunities for inmates to engage in the free exercise of religion.\n\f10                         MADISON v. RITER\nThis secular goal of exempting religious exercise from regulatory bur-\ndens in a neutral fashion, as distinguished from advancing religion in\nany sense, is indeed permissible under the Establishment Clause. See\nid.\n\n   To be sure, Congress has no constitutional duty to remove or to\nmitigate the government-imposed burdens on prisoners’ religious\nexercise. See O’Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U.S. 342, 349-50\n(1987). But the Supreme Court has held that Congress may choose to\nreduce government-imposed burdens on specific fundamental rights\nwhen it deems it appropriate. The Supreme Court \"has upheld a broad\nrange of statutory religious accommodations against Establishment-\nClause challenges.\" Brown v. Gilmore, 258 F.3d 265, 275 (4th Cir.\n2001). These include statutes that allow public school students time\noff during the day solely for religious worship or instruction, see\nZorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306, 315 (1952), property tax exemp-\ntions for religious properties used solely for religious worship, see\nWalz v. Tax Commission, 397 U.S. 664, 680 (1970), and exemptions\nfor religious organizations from statutory prohibitions against dis-\ncrimination on the basis of religion, see Amos, 483 U.S. at 335. While\nRLUIPA’s scope may in some ways be broader than the specific reli-\ngious exceptions that the Supreme Court has previously upheld, the\ncentral principle — that Congress may legitimately minimize govern-\nment burdens on religious exercise — remains the same. Congress\nhere has acted properly in embracing this secular purpose.\n\n                                   B.\n\n   We next consider whether section 3 of RLUIPA has the impermis-\nsible effect of advancing religion. See Lemon, 403 U.S. at 612-13.\nThe district court found that RLUIPA impermissibly advanced reli-\ngion by according special protection only to prisoners’ religious exer-\ncise. The district court stated:\n\n     The singling out of religious belief as the one fundamental\n     right of prisoners deserving of legislative protection rejects\n     any notion of congressional neutrality in the passage of\n     RLUIPA. In the absence of any proof that religious rights\n     are more at risk in prison than other fundamental rights, and\n     with the knowledge that strict scrutiny is not required to pro-\n\f                          MADISON v. RITER                           11\n    tect the religious belief of prisoners under the Free Exercise\n    Clause, Congress acted only to protect religious rights. Such\n    an action, while labeled a neutral \"accommodation,\" is not\n    in fact neutral at all, and the Court is not allowed to defer\n    to the mere characterization of RLUIPA as such.\n\nMadison, 240 F. Supp. 2d at 576.\n\n    We disagree. \"For a law to have forbidden ‘effects’ under Lemon,\nit must be fair to say that the government itself has advanced religion\nthrough its own activities and influence.\" Amos, 483 U.S. at 337\n(emphasis in original). Evidence of the impermissible government\nadvancement of religion includes \"sponsorship, financial support, and\nactive involvement of the sovereign in religious activity.\" Walz, 397\nU.S. at 668. Here, however, Congress has not sponsored religion or\nbecome actively involved in religious activity, and RLUIPA in no\nway is attempting to indoctrinate prisoners in any particular belief or\nto advance religion in general in the prisons. Congress has simply\nlifted government burdens on religious exercise and thereby facili-\ntated free exercise of religion for those who wish to practice their\nfaiths.\n\n   We cannot accept the theory advanced by the district court that\nCongress impermissibly advances religion when it acts to lift burdens\non religious exercise yet fails to consider whether other rights are\nsimilarly threatened. Madison, 240 F. Supp. 2d at 577; see also Cutter\nv. Wilkinson, No. 02-3270, 2003 WL 22513973, at *7-8 (6th Cir.\nNov. 7, 2003). There is no requirement that legislative protections for\nfundamental rights march in lockstep. The mere fact that RLUIPA\nseeks to lift government burdens on a prisoner’s religious exercise\ndoes not mean that the statute must provide commensurate protections\nfor other fundamental rights. Amos clearly established that \"[w]here,\nas here, government acts with the proper purpose of lifting a regula-\ntion that burdens the exercise of religion, we see no reason to require\nthat the exemption comes packaged with benefits to secular entities.\"\nAmos, 483 U.S. at 338.\n\n   The district court attempted to distinguish Amos from the present\ncase by stating that in Amos, Congress had found that Title VII’s pro-\nhibitions on hiring or firing on the basis of religion had a much\n\f12                          MADISON v. RITER\ngreater effect on religious groups than on secular organizations. Madi-\nson, 240 F. Supp. 2d at 577 n.9. While congressional supporters of\nRLUIPA also emphasized the \"egregious and unnecessary\" burdens\nthat prison regulations impose on religious exercise, the district court\nconcluded that the restrictions inherent in prison life could not help\nbut burden other fundamental rights as well. Id. at 575. The district\ncourt thus concluded that \"[w]hen Congress acts to lift limitations on\none right while ignoring all others, it abandons neutrality towards\nthese rights, placing its power behind one system of belief.\" Id. at\n577.\n\n   The Establishment Clause’s requirement of neutrality does not\nmandate that when Congress relieves the burdens of regulation on one\nfundamental right, that it must similarly reduce government burdens\non all other rights. Amos stands, as we have noted, for the simple\nproposition that Congress can intervene to lift governmental burdens\non religious exercise. The Amos decision does not at all indicate that\nCongress must examine how or if any other fundamental rights are\nsimilarly burdened. The Amos Court in no way made its ruling turn\non a congressional finding that religious exercise was threatened more\nby the application of Title VII than were other rights. It is doubtful\nthat such congressional findings — a compilation of evidence on how\nall fundamental rights would or would not be affected by Title VII —\neven existed. Regardless, such a heightened standard for congressio-\nnal action was not part of the inquiry in Amos.2\n\n   Indeed, the context in which Congress was acting made it sensible\nfor Congress to lift only state-imposed burdens on free exercise\nthrough RLUIPA. It was reasonable for Congress to seek to reduce\nthe burdens on religious exercise for prisoners without simultaneously\nenhancing, say, an inmate’s First Amendment rights to access pornog-\nraphy. Free exercise and other First Amendment rights may be\n  2\n    A concurrence in City of Boerne v. Flores admittedly states a view\nrelated to that of the district court. 521 U.S. at 536-37 (Stevens, J., con-\ncurring) (holding that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act provides\nreligious groups \"with a legal weapon that no atheist or agnostic can\nobtain\" and thus constitutes a \"governmental preference for religion, as\nopposed to irreligion\"). This view, however, has not been adopted by the\nSupreme Court.\n\f                           MADISON v. RITER                          13\nequally burdened by prison regulations, but the Constitution itself\nprovides religious exercise with special safeguards. And no provision\nof the Constitution even suggests that Congress cannot single out fun-\ndamental rights for additional protection. To attempt to read a require-\nment of symmetry of protection for fundamental liberties would not\nonly conflict with all binding precedent, but it would also place prison\nadministrators and other public officials in the untenable position of\ncalibrating burdens and remedies with the specter of judicial second-\nguessing at every turn.\n\n   Apart from advancing religion, the district court further found that\nRLUIPA may create incentives for secular prisoners to cloak secular\nrequests in religious garb and thus may increase the burden on state\nand local officials in processing RLUIPA claims. See Madison, 240\nF. Supp. 2d at 580. This may be true, but it is simply not a concern\nunder the Establishment Clause. Any additional burdens that RLUIPA\nmay impose on states and localities speak more to the wisdom of the\nlaw and to the disincentives for states to assume their RLUIPA obli-\ngations than to RLUIPA’s validity under the Establishment Clause.\nWe therefore conclude that section 3 of RLUIPA has the effect of lift-\ning burdens on prisoners’ religious exercise, but does not impermiss-\nibly advance religion.\n\n                                  C.\n\n    We further conclude that section 3 of RLUIPA does not create\nexcessive government entanglement with religion in violation of the\nthird prong of the Lemon test. See Lemon, 403 U.S. at 612-13; see\nalso Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 232-35 (1997) (suggesting that\nthe effects and entanglement prongs of Lemon focus on substantially\nthe same factors). While the statute may require some state action in\nlifting state-imposed burdens on religious exercise, RLUIPA does not\nrequire \"pervasive monitoring\" by public authorities. Agostini v. Fel-\nton, 521 U.S. at 233-34; see also Mayweathers v. Newland, 314 F.3d\n1062, 1069 (9th Cir. 2002). RLUIPA itself minimizes the likelihood\nof entanglement through its carefully crafted enforcement provisions.\nFor example, the statute’s broad definition of \"religious exercise\" to\n\"include any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or\ncentral to, a system of religious belief,\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-5(7)(A),\n\f14                         MADISON v. RITER\nmitigates any dangers that entanglement may result from administra-\ntive review of good-faith religious belief.\n\n                                   D.\n\n   Section 3 of RLUIPA thus satisfies the three prongs of the Lemon\ntest. The opposite conclusion, we believe, would work a profound\nchange in the Supreme Court’s Establishment Clause jurisprudence\nand in the ability of Congress to facilitate the free exercise of religion\nin this country. It would throw into question a wide variety of reli-\ngious accommodation laws. It could upset exemptions from compul-\nsory military service for ordained ministers and divinity students\nunder federal law, since these exemptions are not paired with parallel\nsecular allowances or provisions to protect other fundamental rights\nthreatened by compulsory military service. See 50 U.S.C. App.\n§ 456(g) (2000). It would similarly imperil Virginia’s and other\nstates’ recognition of a \"clergy-penitent privilege,\" which exempts\nfrom discovery an individual’s statements to clergy when \"seeking\nspiritual counsel and advice.\" See, e.g., Va. Code Ann. §§ 8.01-400,\n19.2-271.3 (2000). Other specific religious accommodation statutes,\nranging from tax exemptions to exemptions from compulsory public\nschool attendance, see, e.g., Va. Code Ann. § 22.1-254(B) (2000),\nwould also be threatened.\n\n   Perhaps more importantly, the principle of neutrality advanced by\nthe district court would create a test that Congress could rarely, if\never, meet in attempting to lift regulatory burdens on religious entities\nor individuals. For example, if Congress sought to grant religious\norganizations an exemption from a particularly demanding legal\nrequirement, then Congress might have to grant similar exemptions to\nradio and TV stations or secular advocacy groups, absent congressio-\nnal findings that free exercise rights were somehow more endangered\nby the law than other rights. Congress would have to make determina-\ntions in every instance of what fundamental rights are at risk and to\nwhat degree they are at risk, and it would be able only to heighten\nprotection for fundamental rights in a symmetric fashion according to\nthese assessments. The byzantine complexities that such compliance\nwould entail would likely cripple government at all levels from pro-\nviding any fundamental rights with protection above the Constitu-\ntion’s minimum requirements.\n\f                           MADISON v. RITER                           15\n                                  III.\n\n                                   A.\n\n   The Commonwealth recognized at argument the problematic nature\nof the trial court’s rationale, but pressed several alternative points in\nsupport of affirmance which we feel obliged to address. It first con-\ntends that RLUIPA’s mandate for the religious accommodation of\nprisoners violates the Establishment Clause because it subjects third\nparties to substantial burdens. The Commonwealth relies primarily on\nEstate of Thornton v. Caldor, Inc., 472 U.S. 703, 710-11 (1985), for\nthis contention. In Caldor, a Connecticut statute required employers\nto excuse employees from work on whatever day the employee desig-\nnated as his Sabbath. Id. at 708. Importantly, that statute mandated the\naccommodation of the religious needs of not only state employees,\nbut also private employees. The Supreme Court struck the statute\ndown on Establishment Clause grounds because it imposed significant\nburdens on private employers by requiring them to lift privately-\nimposed burdens on religious exercise. Id. at 708-10.\n\n   It is true that section 3 of RLUIPA also seeks to have third parties\n— states accepting federal correctional funds — accommodate reli-\ngious needs. But any comparison between RLUIPA and the statute in\nCaldor ends there. Caldor concerned an unfunded mandate imposed\non private employers to lift privately-imposed burdens on the reli-\ngious exercise of employees. Here the Commonwealth has voluntarily\ncommitted itself to lifting government-imposed burdens on the reli-\ngious exercise of publicly institutionalized persons in exchange for\nfederal correctional funds. These distinctions make the Common-\nwealth’s reliance on Caldor unpersuasive.\n\n                                   B.\n\n   The Commonwealth also protests that RLUIPA’s compelling inter-\nest test will bind its hands and make it nearly impossible for the Com-\nmonwealth to prevail if prisoners challenge burdens on their religious\nexercise. The district court echoed this concern by proclaiming that\n\"the change that RLUIPA imposes is revolutionary, switching from\na scheme of deference to prison administrators to one of presumptive\nunconstitutionality.\" Madison, 240 F. Supp. 2d at 575.\n\f16                        MADISON v. RITER\n   We do not make light of this concern. RLUIPA may impose bur-\ndens on prison administrators as they act to accommodate an inmates’\nright to free exercise. But RLUIPA still affords prison administrators\nwith flexibility to regulate prisoners’ religious practices if the Com-\nmonwealth \"demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person\n— (1) is in furtherance of a compelling government interest; and (2)\nis the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling government\ninterest.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(a).\n\n   Moreover, the experience of federal correctional officials in com-\nplying with RLUIPA’s predecessor statute, RFRA, suggests that the\nsimilar provisions of RLUIPA would not impose an unreasonable\nburden on state or local prisons. In the cases litigated under RFRA,\nfederal correctional officials have continued to prevail the over-\nwhelming majority of the time. See Developments in the Law - Reli-\ngious Practice in Prison, 115 Harv. L. Rev. 1891, 1894 (2002). This\nfact suggests that RLUIPA should not hamstring the ability of the\nCommonwealth’s correctional officials to ensure order and safety in\nthe Commonwealth’s prisons.\n\n    Admittedly, prison administrators’ litigation successes may\nobscure the extent to which RLUIPA provides incentives for adminis-\ntrators to accommodate religious needs before litigation. But there is\nlittle empirical evidence from the federal government’s experience\nunder RFRA to suggest that the Commonwealth’s compliance with\nRLUIPA will prove unworkable. And if it does, the Commonwealth\nat any time can decline the federal government’s correctional funding.\nState legislators or administrators may weigh the burdens and benefits\nof RLUIPA and reject the federal funding if the tie-in of religious\naccommodation is not worth the financial benefits. In the final analy-\nsis, however, practical difficulties speak more to the wisdom of the\nlegislation than to the precise Establishment Clause challenge under\nreview in this appeal.\n\n                                 IV.\n\n   Our society has a long history of accommodation with respect to\nmatters of belief and conscience. If Americans may not set their\nbeliefs above the law, there must be room to accommodate belief and\nfaith within the law. See Smith, 494 U.S. at 878-79. Regardless of the\n\f                           MADISON v. RITER                          17\nnature of their beliefs, people must pay taxes and observe other secu-\nlar laws of general applicability. See Minersville School Dist. v. Gobi-\ntis, 310 U.S. 586, 594-95 (1940). However, legislative bodies have\nevery right to accommodate free exercise, so long as government does\nnot privilege any faith, belief, or religious viewpoint in particular.\nBoard of Educ. of Kiryas Joel Village Sch. Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U.S.\n687, 696-97 (1994). Section 3 of RLUIPA fits comfortably within this\nbroad tradition.\n\n   We thus cannot find that section 3 of RLUIPA creates an Establish-\nment Clause violation. We address here only the Establishment\nClause challenge to RLUIPA. The Commonwealth has challenged the\nstatute on a variety of other grounds, namely that it exceeds Con-\ngress’s authority under the Spending and Commerce Clauses and that\nit runs afoul of the Tenth and Eleventh Amendments. We do not\naddress these issues in this interlocutory appeal because the district\ncourt has not yet had sufficient opportunity to consider them. The\nCommonwealth also argues that it retains the exclusive authority to\nregulate in a zone of discretion between what the Establishment\nClause prohibits and what the Free Exercise Clause requires.\nAlthough couched in religious terms, this is really a variant of the\nCommonwealth’s many federalism-based or residual power conten-\ntions, which we have left to the district court on remand.\n\n   The judgment is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded to the\ndistrict court for further proceedings.\n\n                                      REVERSED AND REMANDED\n\f",

Madison, a convict held in a Virginia Department\nof Corrections prison, was denied his requests for kosher meals that\nhe claims his religious beliefs require. He sued the Commonwealth of\nVirginia and officials of the Virginia Department of Corrections,\nalleging among other claims a violation of section 3 of the Religious\nLand Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA). The\ndistrict court ruled that the provision had an impermissible effect of\nadvancing religion under the second prong of the Lemon test. See\nLemon v. Kurtzman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108380\"><a href=\"/opinion/108380/lemon-v-kurtzman/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">602</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 612-13 (1971). Because we find\nthat Congress can accommodate religion in section 3 of RLUIPA\nwithout violating the Establishment Clause, we reverse. To hold oth-\nerwise and find an Establishment Clause violation would severely\nundermine the ability of our society to accommodate the most basic\nrights of conscience and belief in neutral yet constructive ways.\n\f4                          MADISON v. RITER\n                                    I.\n\n                                   A.\n\n   From 2000 to the present, Madison has claimed to be a member of\nthe Church of God and Saints of Christ, a congregation founded in\n1896 and headquartered at Temple Beth El in Suffolk, Virginia.\nChurch members are commonly known as Hebrew Israelites, and they\nclaim to be \"followers of the anointed God\" who honor but do not\nworship Jesus Christ. Most importantly for purposes of this case,\nMadison’s church requires its members to abide by the dietary laws\nlaid out in the Hebrew Scriptures.\n\n   The parties dispute the timing of Madison’s conversion and his\naffiliation with a wide range of other religious groups during his\nincarceration. What is clear is that in July 2000 and again in March\n2001, Madison informed correctional officials that his religious\nbeliefs required him to receive a kosher diet, defined as a \"common\nfare diet\" by the Virginia Department of Corrections. Both requests\nwere approved by local prison officials, but denied by Department of\nCorrections administrators in Richmond. The Commonwealth\nrejected Madison’s requests because it determined that Madison\nalready had adequate alternatives from the regular, vegetarian, and no\npork daily menus; because it doubted the sincerity of Madison’s reli-\ngious beliefs; and because it considered Madison’s history of disci-\nplinary problems.\n\n   In August 2001, Madison challenged the denial of his request in\ndistrict court, relying in part on section 3 of RLUIPA. Section 3(a) of\nRLUIPA states that \"[n]o government shall impose a substantial bur-\nden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an\ninstitution . . . even if the burden results from a rule of general appli-\ncability, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the\nburden on that person — (1) is in furtherance of a compelling govern-\nment interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that\ncompelling government interest.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(a) (2000).\nSection 3(b) of RLUIPA states that Section 3(a) applies whenever the\nsubstantial burden at issue \"is imposed in a program or activity that\nreceives Federal financial assistance.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(b)(1). In\n2002 the Commonwealth Department of Corrections received $4.72\n\f                            MADISON v. RITER                             5\nmillion — approximately 0.5% of its budget — from the federal gov-\nernment, thus triggering the statute’s applicability. Madison’s lawsuit\nrelied on section 4(a) of RLUIPA, which creates a private right of\naction that allows any person to \"assert a violation of this chapter as\na claim or defense in a judicial proceeding\" and to \"obtain appropriate\nrelief against a government.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-2(a).\n\n  The district court denied Madison’s motion for summary judgment\nconcerning his constitutional claims on August 23, 2002, and it\ndeferred ruling on his RLUIPA claim pending briefing and argument\non the statute’s constitutionality. The district court also granted the\nUnited States leave to intervene to defend the statute, pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. § 2403(a).\n\n   On January 23, 2003, the district court found that section 3 of\nRLUIPA impermissibly advanced religion by offering greater legisla-\ntive protection to the religious rights of prisoners than to other funda-\nmental rights that were similarly burdened. See Madison v. Riter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2324085\"><a href=\"/opinion/2324085/madison-v-riter/\"><span class=\"volume\">240</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">566</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 577 (W.D. Va. 2003). The district court therefore\nrejected Madison’s statutory claim, and simultaneously certified the\nquestion of RLUIPA’s constitutionality for interlocutory appeal under\n28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). Madison and the United States filed timely peti-\ntions with this court to appeal the order, and their petitions were\ngranted.\n\n                                    B.\n\n   The legislative and judicial background that led to RLUIPA’s\nenactment are important for considering Madison’s appeal. Congress\ncrafted RLUIPA to conform to the Supreme Court’s decisions in\nEmployment Division v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112404\"><a href=\"/opinion/112404/employment-div-dept-of-human-resources-of-ore-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">872</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1990), and City of\nBoerne v.

In Smith, the Court held that\nlaws of general applicability that incidentally burden religious con-\nduct do not offend the First Amendment. See 494 U.S. at 890. The\nneutrality principle in Smith largely complemented the traditional def-\nerence that courts afford to prison regulations that impose burdens on\nprisoners’ rights. See Turner v. Safley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111904\"><a href=\"/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 89-90 (1987).1 At\n  1\n   Turner v.

RITER                            7\nNov. 10, 2003), in September 2000, Congress attempted to reinstate\nRFRA’s protection against government burdens on religious exercise\nimposed by states and localities by enacting the Religious Land Use\nand Institutionalized Persons Act (\"RLUIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc et\nseq. This statute mirrored the provisions of RFRA, but its scope was\nlimited to laws and regulations concerning land use and institutional-\nized persons. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(a). RLUIPA’s enactment was\npremised on congressional findings similar to those made for RFRA,\nnamely, that in the absence of federal legislation, prisoners, detainees,\nand institutionalized mental health patients faced substantial burdens\nin practicing their religious faiths. See Joint Statement of Senator\nHatch and Senator Kennedy, 146 Cong. Rec. S7774-01 (daily ed. July\n27, 2000).\n\n   In passing RLUIPA, Congress sought to avoid Boerne’s constitu-\ntional barrier by relying on its Spending and Commerce Clause pow-\ners, rather than on its remedial powers under section 5 of the\nFourteenth Amendment as it had in RFRA. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-\n1(b)(1) (establishing that Section 3 of RLUIPA applies whenever the\nburden at issue \"is imposed in a program or activity that receives Fed-\neral financial assistance\"); 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(b)(2) (establishing\nthat section 3 of RLUIPA applies in cases in which \"the substantial\nburden [on religion] affects, or removal of that substantial burden\nwould affect, commerce with foreign nations, among the several\nStates, or with Indian tribes\").\n\n                                   II.\n\n   Among its numerous constitutional challenges to RLUIPA, the\nCommonwealth contends that the statute violates the Establishment\nClause. The district court held that section 3 of RLUIPA violates the\nEstablishment Clause because it singled out the religious exercise\nrights of prisoners for special protection. The district court explained:\n\n    [P]rison inmates exist in a society of universally limited\n    rights, one that is required by the nature of the institution.\n    When Congress acts to lift the limitations on one right while\n    ignoring all others, it abandons a position of neutrality\n    towards these rights, placing its power behind one system of\n    belief.\n\f8                          MADISON v. RITER\nMadison, 240 F. Supp. 2d at 577. The district court stated that \"the\npractical effect of RLUIPA on the prison system in the United States\nis to grant religious and professed religious inmates a multitude of\nexceptions and benefits not available to non-believers.\" Id. at 580. It\nconcluded that \"RLUIPA extends far beyond regulations targeting\nreligion, protecting religious inmates against even generally applica-\nble and facially neutral prison regulations that have a substantial\neffect on a multitude of fundamental rights.\" Id. at 575-76.\n\n   Because Congress had failed to compile \"demonstrable evidence\nthat religious constitutional rights are at any greater risk of depriva-\ntion in the prison system than other fundamental rights,\" id. at 575,\nthe district court found that protecting the religious exercise of prison-\ners violated the Establishment Clause. It concluded that this provision\nsends \"non-religious inmates a message that they are outsiders of a\nprivileged community,\" id. at 580, and it unconstitutionally advanced\nreligion by providing an inmate with incentives to \"claim religious\nrebirth and cloak himself in the protections of RLUIPA.\" Id.\n\n   The district court’s decision is at odds with two other circuits that\nhave examined this question and found that section 3 of RLUIPA\ndoes not violate the Establishment Clause.

RLUIPA is not designed to advance a particular\nreligious viewpoint or even religion in general, but rather to facilitate\nopportunities for inmates to engage in the free exercise of religion.\n\f10                         MADISON v.

While\nRLUIPA’s scope may in some ways be broader than the specific reli-\ngious exceptions that the Supreme Court has previously upheld, the\ncentral principle — that Congress may legitimately minimize govern-\nment burdens on religious exercise — remains the same. Congress\nhere has acted properly in embracing this secular purpose.\n\n                                   B.\n\n   We next consider whether section 3 of RLUIPA has the impermis-\nsible effect of advancing religion. See Lemon, 403 U.S. at 612-13.\nThe district court found that RLUIPA impermissibly advanced reli-\ngion by according special protection only to prisoners’ religious exer-\ncise. The district court stated:\n\n     The singling out of religious belief as the one fundamental\n     right of prisoners deserving of legislative protection rejects\n     any notion of congressional neutrality in the passage of\n     RLUIPA.

RITER                           11\n    tect the religious belief of prisoners under the Free Exercise\n    Clause, Congress acted only to protect religious rights. Such\n    an action, while labeled a neutral \"accommodation,\" is not\n    in fact neutral at all, and the Court is not allowed to defer\n    to the mere characterization of RLUIPA as such.\n\nMadison, 240 F. Supp. 2d at 576.\n\n    We disagree. \"For a law to have forbidden ‘effects’ under Lemon,\nit must be fair to say that the government itself has advanced religion\nthrough its own activities and influence.\" Amos, 483 U.S. at 337\n(emphasis in original). Evidence of the impermissible government\nadvancement of religion includes \"sponsorship, financial support, and\nactive involvement of the sovereign in religious activity.\" Walz, 397\nU.S. at 668. Here, however, Congress has not sponsored religion or\nbecome actively involved in religious activity, and RLUIPA in no\nway is attempting to indoctrinate prisoners in any particular belief or\nto advance religion in general in the prisons. Congress has simply\nlifted government burdens on religious exercise and thereby facili-\ntated free exercise of religion for those who wish to practice their\nfaiths.\n\n   We cannot accept the theory advanced by the district court that\nCongress impermissibly advances religion when it acts to lift burdens\non religious exercise yet fails to consider whether other rights are\nsimilarly threatened. Madison, 240 F. Supp. 2d at 577; see also Cutter\nv. Wilkinson, No. 02-3270, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">22513973</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7-8 (6th Cir.\nNov. 7, 2003). There is no requirement that legislative protections for\nfundamental rights march in lockstep. The mere fact that RLUIPA\nseeks to lift government burdens on a prisoner’s religious exercise\ndoes not mean that the statute must provide commensurate protections\nfor other fundamental rights. Amos clearly established that \"[w]here,\nas here, government acts with the proper purpose of lifting a regula-\ntion that burdens the exercise of religion, we see no reason to require\nthat the exemption comes packaged with benefits to secular entities.\"\nAmos, 483 U.S. at 338.\n\n   The district court attempted to distinguish Amos from the present\ncase by stating that in Amos, Congress had found that Title VII’s pro-\nhibitions on hiring or firing on the basis of religion had a much\n\f12                          MADISON v. RITER\ngreater effect on religious groups than on secular organizations. Madi-\nson, 240 F. Supp. 2d at 577 n.9. While congressional supporters of\nRLUIPA also emphasized the \"egregious and unnecessary\" burdens\nthat prison regulations impose on religious exercise, the district court\nconcluded that the restrictions inherent in prison life could not help\nbut burden other fundamental rights as well. Id. at 575. The district\ncourt thus concluded that \"[w]hen Congress acts to lift limitations on\none right while ignoring all others, it abandons neutrality towards\nthese rights, placing its power behind one system of belief.\" Id. at\n577.\n\n   The Establishment Clause’s requirement of neutrality does not\nmandate that when Congress relieves the burdens of regulation on one\nfundamental right, that it must similarly reduce government burdens\non all other rights. Amos stands, as we have noted, for the simple\nproposition that Congress can intervene to lift governmental burdens\non religious exercise. The Amos decision does not at all indicate that\nCongress must examine how or if any other fundamental rights are\nsimilarly burdened. The Amos Court in no way made its ruling turn\non a congressional finding that religious exercise was threatened more\nby the application of Title VII than were other rights. It is doubtful\nthat such congressional findings — a compilation of evidence on how\nall fundamental rights would or would not be affected by Title VII —\neven existed. Regardless, such a heightened standard for congressio-\nnal action was not part of the inquiry in Amos.2\n\n   Indeed, the context in which Congress was acting made it sensible\nfor Congress to lift only state-imposed burdens on free exercise\nthrough RLUIPA. It was reasonable for Congress to seek to reduce\nthe burdens on religious exercise for prisoners without simultaneously\nenhancing, say, an inmate’s First Amendment rights to access pornog-\nraphy. Free exercise and other First Amendment rights may be\n  2\n    A concurrence in City of Boerne v. Flores admittedly states a view\nrelated to that of the district court. 521 U.S. at 536-37 (Stevens, J., con-\ncurring) (holding that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act provides\nreligious groups \"with a legal weapon that no atheist or agnostic can\nobtain\" and thus constitutes a \"governmental preference for religion, as\nopposed to irreligion\"). This view, however, has not been adopted by the\nSupreme Court.\n\f                           MADISON v. RITER                          13\nequally burdened by prison regulations, but the Constitution itself\nprovides religious exercise with special safeguards. And no provision\nof the Constitution even suggests that Congress cannot single out fun-\ndamental rights for additional protection. To attempt to read a require-\nment of symmetry of protection for fundamental liberties would not\nonly conflict with all binding precedent, but it would also place prison\nadministrators and other public officials in the untenable position of\ncalibrating burdens and remedies with the specter of judicial second-\nguessing at every turn.\n\n   Apart from advancing religion, the district court further found that\nRLUIPA may create incentives for secular prisoners to cloak secular\nrequests in religious garb and thus may increase the burden on state\nand local officials in processing RLUIPA claims. See Madison, 240\nF. Supp. 2d at 580. This may be true, but it is simply not a concern\nunder the Establishment Clause. Any additional burdens that RLUIPA\nmay impose on states and localities speak more to the wisdom of the\nlaw and to the disincentives for states to assume their RLUIPA obli-\ngations than to RLUIPA’s validity under the Establishment Clause.\nWe therefore conclude that section 3 of RLUIPA has the effect of lift-\ning burdens on prisoners’ religious exercise, but does not impermiss-\nibly advance religion.\n\n                                  C.\n\n    We further conclude that section 3 of RLUIPA does not create\nexcessive government entanglement with religion in violation of the\nthird prong of the Lemon test. See Lemon, 403 U.S. at 612-13; see\nalso Agostini v.

RLUIPA itself minimizes the likelihood\nof entanglement through its carefully crafted enforcement provisions.\nFor example, the statute’s broad definition of \"religious exercise\" to\n\"include any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or\ncentral to, a system of religious belief,\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-5(7)(A),\n\f14                         MADISON v. RITER\nmitigates any dangers that entanglement may result from administra-\ntive review of good-faith religious belief.\n\n                                   D.\n\n   Section 3 of RLUIPA thus satisfies the three prongs of the Lemon\ntest. The opposite conclusion, we believe, would work a profound\nchange in the Supreme Court’s Establishment Clause jurisprudence\nand in the ability of Congress to facilitate the free exercise of religion\nin this country. It would throw into question a wide variety of reli-\ngious accommodation laws. It could upset exemptions from compul-\nsory military service for ordained ministers and divinity students\nunder federal law, since these exemptions are not paired with parallel\nsecular allowances or provisions to protect other fundamental rights\nthreatened by compulsory military service. See 50 U.S.C. App.\n§ 456(g) (2000). It would similarly imperil Virginia’s and other\nstates’ recognition of a \"clergy-penitent privilege,\" which exempts\nfrom discovery an individual’s statements to clergy when \"seeking\nspiritual counsel and advice.\" See, e.g., Va. Code Ann. §§ 8.01-400,\n19.2-271.3 (2000). Other specific religious accommodation statutes,\nranging from tax exemptions to exemptions from compulsory public\nschool attendance, see, e.g., Va. Code Ann. § 22.1-254(B) (2000),\nwould also be threatened.\n\n   Perhaps more importantly, the principle of neutrality advanced by\nthe district court would create a test that Congress could rarely, if\never, meet in attempting to lift regulatory burdens on religious entities\nor individuals. For example, if Congress sought to grant religious\norganizations an exemption from a particularly demanding legal\nrequirement, then Congress might have to grant similar exemptions to\nradio and TV stations or secular advocacy groups, absent congressio-\nnal findings that free exercise rights were somehow more endangered\nby the law than other rights. Congress would have to make determina-\ntions in every instance of what fundamental rights are at risk and to\nwhat degree they are at risk, and it would be able only to heighten\nprotection for fundamental rights in a symmetric fashion according to\nthese assessments. The byzantine complexities that such compliance\nwould entail would likely cripple government at all levels from pro-\nviding any fundamental rights with protection above the Constitu-\ntion’s minimum requirements.\n\f                           MADISON v. RITER                           15\n                                  III.\n\n                                   A.\n\n   The Commonwealth recognized at argument the problematic nature\nof the trial court’s rationale, but pressed several alternative points in\nsupport of affirmance which we feel obliged to address. It first con-\ntends that RLUIPA’s mandate for the religious accommodation of\nprisoners violates the Establishment Clause because it subjects third\nparties to substantial burdens. The Commonwealth relies primarily on\nEstate of Thornton v. Caldor, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111488\"><a href=\"/opinion/111488/estate-of-thornton-v-caldor-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 710-11 (1985), for\nthis contention. In Caldor, a Connecticut statute required employers\nto excuse employees from work on whatever day the employee desig-\nnated as his Sabbath. Id. at 708. Importantly, that statute mandated the\naccommodation of the religious needs of not only state employees,\nbut also private employees. The Supreme Court struck the statute\ndown on Establishment Clause grounds because it imposed significant\nburdens on private employers by requiring them to lift privately-\nimposed burdens on religious exercise. Id. at 708-10.\n\n   It is true that section 3 of RLUIPA also seeks to have third parties\n— states accepting federal correctional funds — accommodate reli-\ngious needs. But any comparison between RLUIPA and the statute in\nCaldor ends there. Caldor concerned an unfunded mandate imposed\non private employers to lift privately-imposed burdens on the reli-\ngious exercise of employees. Here the Commonwealth has voluntarily\ncommitted itself to lifting government-imposed burdens on the reli-\ngious exercise of publicly institutionalized persons in exchange for\nfederal correctional funds. These distinctions make the Common-\nwealth’s reliance on Caldor unpersuasive.\n\n                                   B.\n\n   The Commonwealth also protests that RLUIPA’s compelling inter-\nest test will bind its hands and make it nearly impossible for the Com-\nmonwealth to prevail if prisoners challenge burdens on their religious\nexercise. The district court echoed this concern by proclaiming that\n\"the change that RLUIPA imposes is revolutionary, switching from\na scheme of deference to prison administrators to one of presumptive\nunconstitutionality.\" Madison, 240 F. Supp. 2d at 575.\n\f16                        MADISON v. RITER\n   We do not make light of this concern. RLUIPA may impose bur-\ndens on prison administrators as they act to accommodate an inmates’\nright to free exercise. But RLUIPA still affords prison administrators\nwith flexibility to regulate prisoners’ religious practices if the Com-\nmonwealth \"demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person\n— (1) is in furtherance of a compelling government interest; and (2)\nis the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling government\ninterest.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(a).\n\n   Moreover, the experience of federal correctional officials in com-\nplying with RLUIPA’s predecessor statute, RFRA, suggests that the\nsimilar provisions of RLUIPA would not impose an unreasonable\nburden on state or local prisons. In the cases litigated under RFRA,\nfederal correctional officials have continued to prevail the over-\nwhelming majority of the time. See Developments in the Law - Reli-\ngious Practice in Prison, 115 Harv. L. Rev. 1891, 1894 (2002). This\nfact suggests that RLUIPA should not hamstring the ability of the\nCommonwealth’s correctional officials to ensure order and safety in\nthe Commonwealth’s prisons.\n\n    Admittedly, prison administrators’ litigation successes may\nobscure the extent to which RLUIPA provides incentives for adminis-\ntrators to accommodate religious needs before litigation. But there is\nlittle empirical evidence from the federal government’s experience\nunder RFRA to suggest that the Commonwealth’s compliance with\nRLUIPA will prove unworkable. And if it does, the Commonwealth\nat any time can decline the federal government’s correctional funding.\nState legislators or administrators may weigh the burdens and benefits\nof RLUIPA and reject the federal funding if the tie-in of religious\naccommodation is not worth the financial benefits. In the final analy-\nsis, however, practical difficulties speak more to the wisdom of the\nlegislation than to the precise Establishment Clause challenge under\nreview in this appeal.\n\n                                 IV.\n\n   Our society has a long history of accommodation with respect to\nmatters of belief and conscience. If Americans may not set their\nbeliefs above the law, there must be room to accommodate belief and\nfaith within the law. See Smith, 494 U.S. at 878-79. Regardless of the\n\f                           MADISON v. RITER                          17\nnature of their beliefs, people must pay taxes and observe other secu-\nlar laws of general applicability. See Minersville School Dist. v. Gobi-\ntis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103373\"><a href=\"/opinion/103373/minersville-school-dist-v-gobitis/\"><span class=\"volume\">310</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 594-95 (1940). However, legislative bodies have\nevery right to accommodate free exercise, so long as government does\nnot privilege any faith, belief, or religious viewpoint in particular.\nBoard of Educ. of Kiryas Joel Village Sch. Dist. v. Grumet, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117870\"><a href=\"/opinion/117870/board-of-ed-of-kiryas-joel-village-school-dist-v-grumet/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">687</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 696-97 (1994). Section 3 of RLUIPA fits comfortably within this\nbroad tradition.\n\n   We thus cannot find that section 3 of RLUIPA creates an Establish-\nment Clause violation. We address here only the Establishment\nClause challenge to RLUIPA. The Commonwealth has challenged the\nstatute on a variety of other grounds, namely that it exceeds Con-\ngress’s authority under the Spending and Commerce Clauses and that\nit runs afoul of the Tenth and Eleventh Amendments. We do not\naddress these issues in this interlocutory appeal because the district\ncourt has not yet had sufficient opportunity to consider them. The\nCommonwealth also argues that it retains the exclusive authority to\nregulate in a zone of discretion between what the Establishment\nClause prohibits and what the Free Exercise Clause requires.\nAlthough couched in religious terms, this is really a variant of the\nCommonwealth’s many federalism-based or residual power conten-\ntions, which we have left to the district court on remand.\n\n   The judgment is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded to the\ndistrict court for further proceedings.\n\n                                      REVERSED AND REMANDED\n\f</pre>",
