We hold that, under these\ncircumstances, the First Amendment prohibits the school from\nreaching beyond the schoolyard to impose what might otherwise\n\n                               4\n\fbe appropriate discipline.\n\n       It all began when Justin Layshock used his grandmother’s\ncomputer to access a popular social networking internet web site\nwhere he created a fake internet “profile” of his Hickory High\nSchool Principal, Eric Trosch. His parents filed this action\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983, after the School District punished\nJustin for that conduct. The suit alleges, inter alia, that the\nSchool District’s punishment transcended Justin’s First\nAmendment right of expression. The district court granted\nsummary judgment in favor of Justin on his First Amendment\nclaim. We originally affirmed the district court. See Layshock\nv. Hermitage School Dist., 593 F.3d 249 (3d Cir. 2010).\nThereafter, we entered an order vacating that opinion and\ngranting rehearing en banc. For the reasons that follow, we once\nagain affirm the district court’s holding that the school district’s\nresponse to Justin’s conduct transcended the protection of free\nexpression guaranteed by the First Amendment.\n\n               I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n       In December of 2005, Justin Layshock was a seventeen-\nyear old senior at Hickory High School, which is part of the\nHermitage School District in Hermitage, Pennsylvania.\nSometime between December 10th and 14th, 2005, while Justin\nwas at his grandmother’s house during non-school hours, he\nused her computer to create what he would later refer to as a\n“parody profile” of his Principal, Eric Trosch. The only school\nresource that was even arguably involved in creating the profile\nwas a photograph of Trosch that Justin copied from the School\nDistrict’s website. Justin copied that picture with a simple “cut\n\n                                 5\n\fand paste” operation using the computer’s internet browser and\nmouse. Justin created the profile on “MySpace.”1 MySpace is\na popular social-networking website that “allows its members\nto create online ‘profiles,’ which are individual web pages on\nwhich members post photographs, videos, and information\nabout their lives and interests.” Doe v. MySpace, Inc., 474\nF.Supp. 2d 843, 845 (W.D. Tex. 2007).2\n\n       Justin created the profile by giving bogus answers to\nsurvey questions taken from various templates that were\ndesigned to assist in creating a profile. The survey included\nquestions about favorite shoes, weaknesses, fears, one’s idea of\na “perfect pizza,” bedtime, etc. All of Justin’s answers were\nbased on a theme of “big,” because Trosch is apparently a large\nman. For example, Justin answered “tell me about yourself”\nquestions as follows:\n              Birthday: too drunk to remember\n\n\n\n   1\n       MySpace is found at: http://www.myspace.com.\n  2\n       S ocial online networking sites allow members to use “their\nonline profiles to become part of an online community of\npeople with common interests. Once a member has created a\nprofile, she can extend ‘friend invitations’ to other members and\ncommunicate with her friends over the MySpace.com platform\nvia e-mail, instant messaging, or blogs.” Doe, 474 F. Supp.2d\nat 846.\n\n\n\n                                 6\n\f              Are you a health freak: big steroid\n              freak\n\n              In the past month have you\n              smoked: big blunt3\n\n              In the past month have you been on\n              pills: big pills\n\n              In the past month have you gone\n              Skinny Dipping: big lake, not big\n              dick\n\n              In the past month have you Stolen\n              Anything: big keg\n\n              Ever been drunk: big number of\n              times\n\n              Ever been called a Tease: big\n              whore\n\n              Ever been Beaten up: big fag\n\n              Ever Shoplifted: big bag of kmart\n\n              Number of Drugs I have taken: big\n\n\n\n3\n    Justin explained that a “blunt” was a marijuana cigarette.\n\n                               7\n\fUnder “Interests,” Justin listed: “Transgender, Appreciators of\nAlcoholic Beverages.” Justin also listed “Steroids International”\nas a club Trosch belonged to.\n\n       Justin afforded access to the profile to other students in\nthe School District by listing them as “friends” on the MySpace\nwebsite, thus allowing them to view the profile. Not\nsurprisingly, word of the profile “spread like wildfire” and soon\nreached most, if not all, of Hickory High’s student body.4\n\n       During mid-December 2005, three other students also\nposted unflattering profiles of Trosch on MySpace. Each of\nthose profiles was more vulgar and more offensive than\nJustin’s. Trosch first learned about one of the other profiles\nfrom his daughter, who was in eleventh grade. On Monday,\nDecember 12, 2005, Trosch told his Co-Principal, Chris Gill,\nand the District Superintendent, Karen Ionta, about this other\nprofile and asked the Technology Director, Frank Gingras, to\ndisable it. However, despite the administration’s best efforts,\nstudents found ways to access the profiles. Trosch discovered\nJustin’s profile on Thursday evening, December 15th, and a\nfourth profile on Sunday, December 18th.\n\n     Trosch believed all of the profiles were “degrading,”\n“demeaning,” “demoralizing,” and “shocking.” He was also\n\n\n  4\n    Justin later explained that he made the profile to be funny,\nand did not intend to hurt anyone. However, there was\nobviously nothing “funny” about the profile in the eyes of the\nschool administration.\n\n                               8\n\fconcerned about his reputation and complained to the local\npolice. Although he was not concerned for his safety, he was\ninterested in pressing charges against those responsible for the\nbogus profiles, and he discussed whether the first profile he\ndiscovered might constitute harassment, defamation, or slander.\nHowever, no criminal charges were ever filed against Justin or\nany of the other student authors of profiles.\n\n       On December 15th, Justin used a computer in his\nSpanish classroom to access his MySpace profile of Trosch. He\nalso showed it to other classmates, although he did not\nacknowledge his authorship. After viewing the profile, the\nstudents logged off of MySpace. Justin again attempted to\naccess the profile from school on December 16th, purportedly\nto delete it. School district administrators were unaware of\nJustin’s in-school attempts to access MySpace until their\ninvestigation the following week. Teacher Craig Antush\nglimpsed the profile in his computer lab class and told the\nstudents who were congregating around a computer and\ngiggling to shut it down.\n\n        The School District administrators were not able to\ntotally block students from visiting the MySpace web page at\nschool because Gingras, the Technology Coordinator, was on\nvacation on December 16th. However, the school was able to\ncontrol students’ computer access by limiting the students’ use\nof computers to computer labs or the library where internet\naccess could be supervised. School officials continued to limit\ncomputer use from December 16th until December 21st, which\nwas the last day of school before Christmas recess. Computer\nprogramming classes were also cancelled.\n\n                               9\n\f       According to the district court, the School District’s\ninvestigation revealed how many students had accessed\nMySpace before access to the site at school was disabled, but\nthe school could not determine how many students actually\naccessed any of the Trosch profiles, or which Trosch profiles\nhad been viewed while a student was on the MySpace website.\n\n       School District officials first learned that Justin might\nhave created one of the Trosch profiles on December 21. On\nthat day, Justin and his mother were summoned to a meeting\nwith Superintendent Ionta and Co-Principal Gill. During that\nmeeting, Justin admitted creating a profile, but no disciplinary\naction was then taken against him. After the meeting, without\nprompting from anyone, Justin went to Trosch’s office and\napologized for creating the profile.5\n\n      Justin’s parents were understandably upset over Justin’s\nbehavior. They discussed the matter with him, expressed their\nextreme disappointment, “grounded” him, and prohibited him\nfrom using their home computer.\n\n        On January 3, 2006, the school district sent a letter to\nJustin and his parents giving them notice of an informal hearing\nthat was to be held. The letter read, in pertinent part, as\nfollows:\n\n\n\n     5\n       Trosch later testified that he found Justin’s apology\nrespectful and sincere. Justin followed up with a written letter\nof apology on January 4, 2006.\n\n                              10\n\f             Justin admitted prior to the\n             informal hearing that he created a\n             profile about Mr. Trosch.\n\n             This infraction is a violation of the\n             Hermitage School District\n             Discipline Code: Disruption of the\n             normal school process; Disrespect;\n             H ar a s s men t o f a s c h o o l\n             administrator via computer/internet\n             with remarks that have demeaning\n             implications; Gross misbehavior;\n             Obscene, vulgar and profane\n             language; Computer Policy\n             violations (use of school pictures\n             without authorization).\n\nThe School District subsequently found Justin guilty of all of\nthose charges.\n\n       In addition to a ten-day, out-of-school suspension,\nJustin’s punishment consisted of (1) being placed in the\nAlternative Education Program (the “ACE” program) at the\nhigh school for the remainder of the 2005-2006 school year;6\n\n\n   6\n    Students assigned to ACE meet in a segregated area of the\nhigh school for three hours each day. The program is typically\nreserved for students with behavior and attendance problems\nwho are unable to function in a regular classroom.\n       Prior to creating the Myspace profile, Justin was\n\n                              11\n\f(2) being banned from all extracurricular activities, including\nAcademic Games and foreign-language tutoring;7 and (3) not\nbeing allowed to participate in his graduation ceremony.8 The\nLayshocks were also informed that the School District was\nconsidering expelling Justin. Ironically, Justin, who created the\nleast vulgar and offensive profile, and who was the only student\nto apologize for his behavior, was also the only student\npunished for the MySpace profiles.\n\n            II. DISTRICT COURT PROCEEDINGS\n\n        The Layshocks initiated this action on January 27, 2006,\nby filing a three count complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983\nindividually, and on Justin’s behalf, against the Hermitage\nSchool District, Karen Ionta, Eric Trosch, and Chris Gill, in\ntheir official and individual capacities (hereinafter collectively\nreferred to as the “School District” or “District”). The\nLayshocks also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order\n\n\n\nclassified as a gifted student, was enrolled in advanced\nplacement classes, and had won awards at interscholastic\nacademic competitions. The record does not reveal how the\nSchool District determined that it was appropriate to place such\na student in a program designed for students who could not\nfunction in a classroom.\n   7\n       Justin had been a French tutor to middle school students.\n        8\n      Justin did graduate in 2006 and went on to attend a\nuniversity in New York City.\n\n                                 12\n\fand/or preliminary injunction. Count I of the complaint alleged\nthat the District’s punishment of Justin violated his rights under\nthe First Amendment. Count II alleged that the District’s\npolicies and rules were unconstitutionally vague and/or\noverbroad, both on their face and as applied to Justin. Count III\nalleged that the District’s punishment of Justin interfered with,\nand continued to interfere with, their right as parents to\ndetermine how to best raise, nurture, discipline and educate\ntheir child in violation of their rights under the Due Process\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n        The district court denied the request for a temporary\nrestraining order, Layshock v. Hermitage Sch. Dist., 412 F.\nSupp.2d 502, 508 (W.D. Pa. 2006), and the Layshocks\nwithdrew their motion for a preliminary injunction pursuant to\nthe district court’s efforts at mediation.9 On March 31, 2006,\nthe district court denied the District’s motion to dismiss the\nLayshocks’ claims. The court ruled that the parents may assert\na claim for a violation of their own due process right to “raise,\nnurture, discipline and educate their children” based on a school\ndistrict’s punishment of their child for speech the child uttered\nin the family home.\n\n        After discovery, both sides moved for summary\n\n\n    9\n      The Layshocks agreed to withdraw their motion for a\npreliminary injunction in exchange for the District’s agreement\nto remove Justin from the ACE program, reinstate him to his\nregular classes, allow him to participate in Academic Games,\nand attend his graduation.\n\n                               13\n\fjudgment, and the court thereafter entered summary judgment\nin favor of Justin and against the School District only on the\nFirst Amendment claim.10 The court concluded that a jury trial\nwas necessary to determine compensatory damages and\nattorneys’ fees. See id. at 607.\n\n       Thereafter, the district court denied the District’s motion\nfor entry of judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) or, in the\nalternative, for the issuance of a certificate of appealability\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).\n\n        The parties subsequently filed a joint motion in which\nthey stipulated to damages and requested entry of final\njudgment while preserving all appellate issues pertaining to\nliability. The district court then entered a consent judgment,\nand the School District appealed the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment in favor of Justin on his First Amendment\nclaim.11\n\n\n       10\n         The district court ruled that Trosch was entitled to\nsummary judgment on all counts because he was not involved\nin disciplining Justin. It also held that Ionta and Gill were\nentitled to summary judgment on Justin’s First Amendment\nclaim based on qualified immunity, and that all of the\ndefendants were entitled to summary judgment on the\nvagueness/overbreadth challenge and the parents’ substantive\ndue process claim.\n  11\n     The Layshocks filed a cross-appeal (No. 07-4555) from the\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the\n\n                               14\n\f               III. SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\n       “Summary judgment is proper when the pleadings,\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party\nis entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Bjorgung v.\nWhitetail Resort, LP, 550 F.3d 263, 268 (3d Cir. 2008) (citation\nand internal quotation marks omitted). In ruling on a motion for\nsummary judgment, the district court must view the facts in the\nlight most favorable to the non-moving party. Merkle v. Upper\nDublin Sch. Dist., 211 F.3d 782, 788 (3d Cir. 2000). However,\n“the mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the\nparties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion\nfor summary judgment.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477\nU.S. 242, 247-48 (1986). “As our review of a grant of summary\njudgment is plenary, we operate under the same legal standards\n\n\nSchool District on their Fourteenth Amendment Due Process\nclaim. In our opinion filed on February 4, 2010, we affirmed the\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment to the School District\non that claim, and the Layshocks did not seek rehearing en banc\non that claim. Therefore, although we vacated the February 4,\n2010, opinion and judgment as to the School District’s appeal at\nNo. 07-4464, and granted the School District’s petition for\nrehearing en banc, we also, on April 9, 2010, ordered that “the\nopinion and judgment entered by this Court on February 4, 2010\nstands with respect to the affirmance of the district court’s grant\nof summary judgment to the [School District] on [the\nLayshocks’] Fourteenth Amendment Due Process claim.”\n\n                                15\n\fas the District Court.” Bjorgung, 550 F.3d at 268.\n\n                 IV. DISCUSSION\n1. The First Amendment’s Application in Public Schools.\n\n        In the landmark case of Tinker v. Des Moines Indep.\nCmty. Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503 (1969), a group of high school\nstudents decided to wear black arm bands to school to protest\nthe war in Vietnam. When school officials learned of the\nplanned protest, they preemptively prohibited students from\nwearing armbands. Several students who ignored the ban and\nwore armbands to school anyway were suspended. Id. at 504.\nThose students brought an action against the school through\ntheir parents under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that their First\nAmendment rights had been violated. The district court\nrejected that claim and upheld the constitutionality of the school\nofficials’ action, finding that it had been reasonable to preserve\ndiscipline. Id. 504-505. The district court’s decision was\naffirmed without opinion by an equally divided court of appeals\nsitting en banc. Id. at 505.\n\n        The case was appealed to the Supreme Court, which held\nthat student expression may not be suppressed unless school\nofficials reasonably conclude that it will “materially and\nsubstantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school.” Id.\nat 513. The Court concluded that the students were doing\nnothing more than engaging in political speech, and wearing\narmbands to express “their disapproval of the Vietnam\nhostilities and their advocacy of a truce, to make their views\nknown, and, by their example, to influence others to adopt\nthem.” Id. at 514. The school district’s only interest in banning\n\n                               16\n\fthe speech had been the “mere desire to avoid the discomfort\nand unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular\nviewpoint” or “an urgent wish to avoid the controversy which\nmight result from the expression.” Id. at 509-10. The Court\nheld that this interest was not enough to justify banning “a\nsilent, passive expression of opinion, unaccompanied by any\ndisorder or disturbance.” Id. at 508. In one of its most famous\npassages, the Court explained:\n\n   First Amendment rights, applied in light of the special\n   characteristics of the school environment, are available\n   to teachers and students. It can hardly be argued that\n   either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights\n   to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse\n   gate.\n\nId. at 506.\n\n        Thus, although the Court concluded that the First\nAmendment did reach inside the “schoolhouse gate,” it also\nrecognized that the unique nature of the school environment had\nto be part of any First Amendment inquiry. The Court\nexplained that it “ha[d] repeatedly emphasized the need for\naffirming the comprehensive authority of the States and of\nschool officials, consistent with fundamental constitutional\nsafeguards, to prescribe and control conduct in the schools.” Id.\nat 507.\n\n       The Court next addressed the scope of the First\nAmendment in the context of student speech in Bethel School\nDistrict No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U.S. 675 (1986). There, the\n\n                               17\n\fCourt upheld the school’s suspension of a high school student\nfor delivering a nominating speech at a school assembly using\n“an elaborate, graphic, and explicit sexual metaphor.” Id. at\n678. The Court explained:\n\n              The schools, as instruments of the\n              state, may determine that the\n              essential lessons of civil, mature\n              conduct cannot be conveyed in a\n              school that tolerates lewd, indecent,\n              or offensive speech and conduct\n              such as that indulged in by\n              [Fraser].12\n\nId. at 683. In reaching this conclusion, the Court distinguished\nits prior holding in Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15 (1971).\nThere, the Court had struck down an adult’s conviction for\ndisorderly conduct that was based on his wearing a jacket,\ninside a court house, that had an obscenity about the draft\nprinted on it. The Fraser Court explained:\n\n              It does not follow . . . that simply\n              because the use of an offensive\n              form of expression may not be\n              prohibited to adults making what\n\n\n   12\n     In Saxe v. State College Area School District, 240 F.3d\n200, 213 (3d Cir. 2001), we interpreted Fraser as establishing\nthat “there is no First Amendment protection for ‘lewd,’\n‘vulgar,’ ‘indecent,’ and ‘plainly offensive’ speech in school.”\n\n                               18\n\f              the speaker considers a political\n              point, the same latitude must be\n              permitted to children in public\n              school. . . . [T]he First Amendment\n              gives a high school student the\n              classroom right to wear Tinker’s\n              armband, but not Cohen’s jacket.\n\nId. at 682 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The\nCourt concluded that the school could punish Fraser for his\noffensive nominating speech during a school assembly because\nthe First Amendment does not prevent schools from\nencouraging the “fundamental values of ‘habits and manners of\ncivility,’” id. at 681, by “insisting that certain modes of\nexpression are inappropriate and subject to sanctions.” Id. at\n683. Thus, “[t]he determination of what manner of speech in\nthe classroom or in school assembly is inappropriate properly\nrests with the school board.” Id.\n\n       Similarly, in Hazelwood School District. v. Kuhlmeier,\n484 U.S. 260 (1988), the Court held that a principal’s deletion\nof student articles on teen pregnancy from a school-sponsored\nnewspaper did not violate the First Amendment. The Court\ndistinguished Tinker by noting that because the school had not\nopened the newspaper up as a public forum, the school could\n“exercis[e] editorial control over the style and content of student\nspeech in school-sponsored expressive activities so long as [its]\nactions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical\nconcerns.” Id. at 273. The Court explained:\n\n              The question whether the First\n\n                                19\n\f                 Amendment requires a school to\n                 tolerate particular student speech –\n                 the question that we addressed in\n                 Tinker – is different from the\n                 question whether the First\n                 Amendment requires a school\n                 affirmatively to promote particular\n                 student speech.         The former\n                 question addresses educators’\n                 ability to silence a student’s\n                 personal expression that happens to\n                 occur on the school premises. The\n                 latter question concerns educators’\n                 authority over school-sponsored . .\n                 . expressive activities that students,\n                 parents, and members of the public\n                 might reasonably perceive to bear\n                 the imprimatur of the school. . . .\n                 Educators are entitled to exercise\n                 greater control over this second\n                 form of student expression.\n\nId. at 270-71.\n\n        The extent to which First Amendment protections apply\nin the public school context was most recently addressed in\nMorse v. Frederick, 551 U.S. 393 (2007). There, “[a]t a school-\nsanctioned and school-supervised event, a high school principal\n[Morse] saw some of her students unfurl a large banner\nconveying a message she reasonably regarded as promoting\nillegal drug use.” Id. at 396. The banner read: “BONG HiTS\n\n                                  20\n\f4 JESUS.” Id. at 397. “Consistent with established school\npolicy prohibiting such messages at school events, [Morse]\ndirected the students to take down the banner.” Id. at 396.\nFrederick, one of the students who brought the banner to the\nevent, refused to remove it, and Morse “confiscated the banner\nand later suspended [Frederick].” Id. Frederick sued Morse and\nthe school district pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging a\nviolation of his First Amendment right of expression. The\ndistrict court granted summary judgment to the school district\nand Morse, holding that they were entitled to qualified\nimmunity and that they had not infringed Frederick’s First\nAmendment rights. Id. at 399. The Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit reversed.\n\n        The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine\n“whether Frederick had a First Amendment right to wield his\nbanner, and, if so, whether that right was so clearly established\nthat the principal may be held liable for damages.” Id. at 400.13\nThe Court “resolve[d] the first question against Frederick,” and,\ntherefore, did not have to reach the second. Id. The Court\nexplained that its Fourth Amendment jurisprudence recognized\nthat “deterring drug use by school children is an important –\nindeed, perhaps compelling interest.” Id. at 407 (citation\nomitted).      The “special characteristics of the school\nenvironment, and the governmental interest in stopping student\ndrug abuse allow schools to restrict student expression that they\nreasonably regard as promoting such abuse.” Id. at 408. Thus,\n\n\n   13\n      The court of appeals had ruled that the principal was not\nentitled to qualified immunity.\n\n                               21\n\f“a principal may, consistent with the First Amendment, restrict\nstudent speech at a school event, when that speech is reasonably\nviewed as promoting illegal drug use.” Id. at 402. The Court\nrejected Frederick’s claim that since he was across the street\nfrom the school and not on school property, he was not inside\nTinker’s “schoolhouse gate,” and school officials therefore had\nlost authority over him. The Court reasoned that the event\nwhere the banner was unfurled occurred during school hours,\nand it had been approved by the school’s principal as a school\nevent. Id. at 400. School events and field trips off school\ngrounds were subject to the school’s rules for student conduct.\nId. at 400-01.\n\n      It is against this legal backdrop that we must determine\nwhether the District’s actions here violated Justin’s First\nAmendment rights.\n\n       At the outset, it is important to note that the district court\nfound that the District could not “establish[] a sufficient nexus\nbetween Justin’s speech and a substantial disruption of the\nschool environment[,]” Layshock, 496 F. Supp. 2d at 600, and\nthe School District does not challenge that finding on appeal.\nTherefore, the School District is not arguing that it could\nproperly punish Justin under the Tinker exception for student\nspeech that causes a material and substantial disruption of the\nschool environment. See Tinker, 393 U.S. at 513. Rather, the\nDistrict’s argument is twofold:\n\n               [A] sufficient nexus exists between\n               Justin’s creation and distribution of\n               the vulgar and defamatory profile\n\n                                 22\n\f               of Principal Trosch and the School\n               District to permit the School\n               District to regulate this conduct.\n               The “speech” initially began on-\n               campus: Justin entered school\n               property, the School District web\n               site, and misappropriated a picture\n               of the Principal. The “speech” was\n               aimed at the School District\n               community and the Principal and\n               was accessed on campus by Justin.\n                It was reasonably foreseeable that\n               the profile would come to the\n               attention of the School District and\n               the Principal.\n\nDistrict’s Br. at 9.\n\n      2. Justin’s “Entry” Onto the District’s Website.\n\n       The School District’s attempt to forge a nexus between\nthe School and Justin’s profile by relying upon his “entering”\nthe District’s website to “take” the District’s photo of Trosch is\nunpersuasive at best. The argument equates Justin’s act of\nsigning onto a web site with the kind of trespass he would have\ncommitted had he broken into the principal’s office or a\nteacher’s desk; and we reject it. See Thomas v. Board of Educ.,\n607 F.2d 1043 (2d Cir. 1979).\n\n       We find the reasoning in Thomas v. Board of Educ., 607\n\n\n                               23\n\fF.3d 1043 (2d Cir. 1979), far more persuasive.20 Thomas\ninvolved a group of students who were suspended for\nproducing “a satirical publication addressed to the school\ncommunity.” Id. at 1045. The articles included such topics as\nmasturbation and prostitution, as well as more standard fare\nsuch as “school lunches, cheerleaders, classmates, and\nteachers.” Id. “Some of the initial preparation for publication\noccurred after school hours in the classroom” of a teacher\nwhom the students consulted “for advice on isolated questions\nof grammar and content.” Id. In addition, “an occasional\narticle was composed or typed within the school building,\nalways after classes,” and the finished magazine was stored in\na “classroom closet” with the classroom teacher’s permission.\nId.\n\n       However, the students were very careful to distribute the\nperiodical only after school and off campus, and the vast\nmajority of their work on the publication was done “in their\nhomes, off campus and after school hours.” Id. The school\nprincipal learned of the magazine when a teacher confiscated a\ncopy from another student on campus, and “following\nconsultation with the Board of Education,” the principal\nimposed penalties that included a five-day suspension of the\nstudents involved.21 Id. at 1046. The punishment was based on\n\n\n   20\n        Thomas was decided after Tinker but before Fraser.\n   21\n     The Principal and Superintendent of Schools had initially\ndecided to take no action pending assessment of the\npublication’s impact. However, they ultimately decided to act\n\n                                24\n\fthe students’ publication of “an allegedly ‘morally offensive,\nindecent, and obscene,’ tabloid.” Id. at 1050 n.12.\n\n        The students sued the school board and other school\nofficials under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. They sought “injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief from alleged deprivations of their First and\nFourteenth Amendment rights.” Id. at 1046. The district court\ndenied the students’ request for injunctive relief based upon its\nconclusion that the publication “was potentially destructive of\ndiscipline in [the school], and therefore not protected by the\nFirst Amendment.” Id. at 1047.\n\n       The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit concluded\nthat the students’ conduct was not sufficiently related to the\nschool to justify the school’s exercise of authority. The court\nexplained:\n\n              [A]ll but an insignificant amount of\n              relevant activity in this case was\n              deliberately designed to take place\n              beyond the schoolhouse gate.\n              Indeed, the [students] diligently\n              labored to ensure that [the\n              magazine] was printed outside the\n              school, and that no copies were\n              sold on school grounds. That a few\n              articles were transcribed on school\n\n\nafter being contacted by the President of the Board of Education.\nThomas, 607 F.2d at 1045-46.\n\n                               25\n\f               typewriters, and that the finished\n               product was secretly and\n               unobtrusively stored in a teacher’s\n               closet do not alter the fact that [the\n               magazine] was conceived,\n               executed, and distributed outside\n               the school. At best, therefore, any\n               activity within the school itself was\n               De minimis.\n\nId. at 1050.\n\n       The court reached that conclusion even though the\nstudents actually stored the offending publication inside a\nclassroom and did some minimal amount of work on the\nperiodical in school using school resources. Here, the\nrelationship between Justin’s conduct and the school is far more\nattenuated than in Thomas. We agree with the analysis in\nThomas. Accordingly, because the School District concedes that\nJustin’s profile did not cause disruption in the school, we do not\nthink that the First Amendment can tolerate the School District\nstretching its authority into Justin’s grandmother’s home and\nreaching Justin while he is sitting at her computer after school\nin order to punish him for the expressive conduct that he\nengaged in there.\n\n       We realize, of course, that it is now well established that\nTinker’s “schoolhouse gate” is not constructed solely of the\nbricks and mortar surrounding the school yard. Nevertheless,\nthe concept of the “school yard” is not without boundaries and\nthe reach of school authorities is not without limits. In Morse,\n\n                                26\n\fthe Court held that the First Amendment does not prevent a\nprincipal from “restrict[ing] student speech at a school event,\nwhen that speech is reasonably viewed as promoting illegal\ndrug use.” 551 U.S. at 403 (emphasis added). Nevertheless,\nwith regard to expressive conduct that occurs outside of the\nschool context, the Court, referring to its earlier decision in\nFraser, was careful to note that “[h]ad Fraser delivered the\nsame speech in a public forum outside the school context, it\nwould have been protected.” 551 U.S. at 404 (citations\nomitted).\n\n       It would be an unseemly and dangerous precedent to\nallow the state, in the guise of school authorities, to reach into\na child’s home and control his/her actions there to the same\nextent that it can control that child when he/she participates in\nschool sponsored activities. Allowing the District to punish\nJustin for conduct he engaged in while at his grandmother’s\nhouse using his grandmother’s computer would create just such\na precedent, and we therefore conclude that the district court\ncorrectly ruled that the District’s response to Justin’s expressive\nconduct violated the First Amendment guarantee of free\nexpression.\n\n  3. The District Cannot Punish Justin Merely Because\n         His Speech Reached Inside the School.\n\n       As noted above, the School District also claims that\nJustin’s speech can be treated as “on-campus” speech because\nit “was aimed at the School District community and the\nPrincipal and was accessed on campus by Justin [and] [i]t was\nreasonably foreseeable that the profile would come to the\n\n                                27\n\fattention of the School District and the Principal.”\n\n       The district court held that the School District’s\npunishment of Justin was not appropriate under Fraser because\n“[t]here is no evidence that Justin engaged in any lewd or\nprofane speech while in school.” Layshock, 496 F. Supp.2d at\n599-600.      It also held that Justin’s punishment was not\nappropriate under Tinker because the School District did “not\nestablish[] a sufficient nexus between Justin’s speech and a\nsubstantial disruption of the school environment.” Id. at 600.\n\n       The School District does not dispute the district court’s\nfinding that its punishment of Justin was not appropriate under\nTinker; it rests its argument on the Supreme Court’s analysis in\nFraser. In the School District’s view, Justin’s speech – his\nMySpace profile of Trosch – was unquestionably vulgar, lewd\nand offensive, and therefore not shielded by the First\nAmendment because it ended up inside the school community.22\n\n\n  22\n     The District’s argument in this regard is not crystal clear as\nits brief suggests that it can react to Justin’s profile merely\nbecause it was lewd and vulgar. For example, the District\nsummarizes one of its arguments as follows:\n\n       The School District did not violate the First\n       Amendment by punishing Justin for engaging in\n       conduct which interfered with the School\n       District’s “highly appropriate function . . . to\n       prohibit the use of vulgar and offensive terms in\n       public discourse.”\n\n                                28\n\f Similarly, the School District argues that under our decision in\nSaxe, see n.12, supra, there is no First Amendment protection\nfor lewd, vulgar, indecent or plainly offensive speech in\nschools.23\n\n        The District rests this argument primarily on three cases\nwhich it claims allow it to respond to a student’s vulgar speech\nwhen that speech is posted on the internet. The District cites\nJ.S. v. Bethlehem Area Sch. Dist., 807 A.2d 847 (Pa. 2002);\nWisniewski v. Bd. of Educ. of Weedsport Cent. Sch. Dist., 494\nF.3d 34 (2d Cir. 2007); and Doninger v. Niehoff, 527 F.3d 41\n(2d Cir. 2008). However, as we will explain, each of those\ncases involved off campus expressive conduct that resulted in\n\n\nDistrict’s Br. at 10 (ellipsis in original).\n\n          However, we reject out of hand any suggestion that\n          schools can police students’ out-of-school speech by\n          patrolling “the public discourse.” Accordingly, we will\n          assume that the District is arguing that it can control\n          lewd and vulgar speech as authorized under Fraser.\n     23\n        In Saxe, we did state: “Under Fraser, a school may\ncategorically prohibit lewd, vulgar or profane language.” 240\nF.3d at 214. However, when read in context, it is clear that we\nwere there referring only to speech inside Tinker’s schoolhouse\ngate. Thus, we summarized the holding in Fraser as follows:\n“According to Fraser, . . . there is no First Amendment\nprotection for ‘lewd,’ ‘vulgar,’ ‘indecent,’ and ‘plainly\noffensive’ speech in school.” Id. at 213 (emphasis added).\n\n                                 29\n\fa substantial disruption of the school, and the courts allowed the\nschools to respond to the substantial disruption that the\nstudent’s out of school conduct caused.\n\n        In J.S., an eighth grade student created a threatening\nwebsite aimed at his algebra teacher that went so far as to\nexplain “[w]hy Should She Die,” and requested money “to help\npay for the hitman.” 807 A.2d at 851. The site frightened\nseveral students and parents and the algebra teacher was so\nbadly frightened that she ended up having to take medical leave\nfrom her teaching responsibilities. As a result of her inability\nto return to teaching, “three substitute teachers were required to\nbe utilized which disrupted the educational process of the\nstudents.” Id. at 852. “In sum, the web site created disorder\nand significantly and adversely impacted the delivery of\ninstruction.” Id. at 869. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania\nconcluded that the resulting disruption of instruction and the\neducational environment allowed the school to punish the\nstudent for his expressive conduct even though the student\ncreated the website from his home.24\n\n      Similarly, the school suspended the student in\nWisniewski, for creating an image on the internet from his home\n\n\n    24\n       The district court believed that J.S. was “on point” but\n“respectfully reache[d] a slightly different balance between\nstudent expression and school authority.” Layshock, 496 F.\nSupp. 2d at 602. However, we do not think J.S. is “on point” or\nthe least bit helpful because there is no comparison between the\nimpact of the conduct there and the impact of the conduct here.\n\n                               30\n\fcomputer that depicted a pistol firing a bullet at a teacher’s head\nwith dots representing splattered blood above the head. 494\nF.3d at 36. The words: “Kill Mr. VanderMolen” were printed\nbeneath the drawing. VanderMolen was the student’s English\nteacher. The student created the image a couple of weeks after\nhis class was instructed that threats would not be tolerated at the\nschool, and would be treated as acts of violence. The court of\nappeals affirmed the district court’s grant of summary judgment\nin favor of the school district in a suit alleging a violation of the\nFirst Amendment based on the school’s suspension of the\nstudent for the out-of-school conduct. The court reasoned that\n“[t]he fact that [the student’s] creation and transmission of the\nicon occurred away from school property [did] not necessarily\ninsulate him from school discipline.” 494 F.3d at 39. The court\nreasoned that “even if [the student’s] transmission of an [image]\ndepicting and calling for the killing of his teacher could be\nviewed as an expression of opinion within the meaning of\nTinker,” it was not protected by the First Amendment because\n“it cross[ed] the boundary of protected speech and pose[d] a\nreasonably foreseeable risk [of] materially and substantially\ndisrupting the work and discipline of the school.” Id. at 38-9\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n        Finally, in Doninger, a student, who was a class officer,\nposted a message on her publicly accessible web log or “blog”\nthat resulted in school authorities not allowing her to participate\nin an election for class office.25 Id. at 43. In her message, she\n\n\n   25\n    “A blog (a contraction of the term ‘web log’) is a type of\nwebsite, usually maintained by an individual with regular entries\n\n                                 31\n\fcomplained about a school activity that was cancelled “due to\ndouchebags in central office,” and encouraged others to contact\nthe central office to “piss [the district superintendent] off more.”\n Id. at 45. When the principal learned of the student’s posting,\nshe prohibited her from running for senior class secretary\n“because [the student’s] conduct had failed to display the\ncivility and good citizenship expected of class officers.” Id. at\n46. The student and her parents then sought injunctive relief in\nthe form of a court order allowing her to run for class office.\nThe court of appeals affirmed the district court’s denial of relief\nbecause the student’s out of school expressive conduct “created\na foreseeable risk of substantial disruption to the work and\ndiscipline of the school.” Id. at 53.26 “ [The student] herself\ntestified that . . . students were ‘all riled up’ and that a sit-in\nwas threatened.” Id. at 51. Accordingly, the court of appeals\nheld that the student’s mother “failed to show clearly that [the\nstudent’s] First Amendment rights were violated when she was\ndisqualified from running” for class office. Id. at 53.\n\n\n\n\nor commentary, descriptions of events, or other material such as\ngraphics or video. . . . ‘Blog’ can also be used as a verb,\nmeaning to maintain or add content to a blog.”\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog) (last visited September 23,\n2010).\n   26\n      The blog had resulted in numerous calls and emails to the\nprincipal, and the court of appeals noted that the blog also used\ninaccurate and misleading information to rally those who read\nit to contact the school principal.\n\n                                32\n\f        However, for our purposes, it is particularly important to\nnote that the court in Doninger was careful to explain that it\n“[had] no occasion to consider whether a different, more serious\nconsequence than disqualification from student office would\nraise constitutional concerns.” Id. at 53. Of course, Justin’s\nconsequences were more serious; he was suspended. Moreover,\nin citing Doninger, we do not suggest that we agree with that\ncourt’s conclusion that the student’s out of school expressive\nconduct was not protected by the First Amendment there.\nRather, we cite Doninger only to respond to the School\nDistrict’s contention that that case supports its actions against\nJustin.\n\n       As noted earlier, the District’s January 3, 2006, letter to\nthe Layshocks advising them of Justin’s suspension reads, in\nrelevant part, that it was punishing Justin because “Justin\nadmitted prior to the informal hearing that he created a profile\nabout Mr. Trosch.” Although the letter also mentions\ndisruption, we have taken care to stress that the District does not\nnow challenge the district court’s finding that Justin’s conduct\ndid not result in any substantial disruption. Moreover, when\npressed at oral argument, counsel for the School District\nconceded that the District was relying solely on the fact that\nJustin created the profile of Trosch, and not arguing that it\ncreated any substantial disruption in the school. However, as\nnoted above, Fraser does not allow the School District to\npunish Justin for expressive conduct which occurred outside of\nthe school context. See Morse, 551 U.S. at 404 (“Had Fraser\ndelivered the same speech in a public forum outside the school\ncontext, it would have been protected.”) (citations omitted).\nMoreover, we have found no authority that would support\n\n                                33\n\fpunishment for creating such a profile unless it results in\nforeseeable and substantial disruption of school.\n\n       We believe the cases relied upon by the School District\nstand for nothing more than the rather unremarkable proposition\nthat schools may punish expressive conduct that occurs outside\nof school, as if it occurred inside the “schoolhouse gate,” under\ncertain very limited circumstances, none of which are present\nhere.\n       As the court of appeals explained in Thomas: “[O]ur\nwillingness to defer to the schoolmaster’s expertise in\nadministering school discipline rests, in large measure, upon the\nsupposition that the arm of authority does not reach beyond the\nschoolhouse gate.” 607 F.2d at 1045. We need not now define\nthe precise parameters of when the arm of authority can reach\nbeyond the schoolhouse gate because, as we noted earlier, the\ndistrict court found that Justin’s conduct did not disrupt the\nschool, and the District does not appeal that finding. Thus, we\nneed only hold that Justin’s use of the District’s web site does\nnot constitute entering the school, and that the District is not\nempowered to punish his out of school expressive conduct under\nthe circumstances here.\n\n        Based on those two conclusions, we will affirm the\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment to Justin Layshock\non his First Amendment claim.27\n\n\n   27\n    The District argues in the alternative that it did not violate\nthe First Amendment by punishing Justin because his speech\nwas defamatory and not protected by the First Amendment. The\n\n                               34\n\fLayshocks respond by arguing that Justin’s profile is a parody\nthat cannot constitute defamation. However, whether or not we\naccept the characterization of a “parody,” the issue before us is\nlimited to whether the District had the authority to punish Justin\nfor expressive conduct outside of school that the District\nconsidered lewd and offensive.\n\n                               35\n\fLayshock v. Hermitage School District, No. 07-4465\nJORDAN, Circuit Judge, concurring, with whom\nVANASKIE, Circuit Judge, joins.\n\n       Our Court today issues en banc decisions in two cases\nwith similar fact patterns. In both the case presently before us\nand in J.S. v. Blue Mountain School District, No. 08-4138, we\nare asked whether school administrators can, consistent with\nthe First Amendment, discipline students for speech that\noccurs off campus.1 Unlike the fractured decision in J.S., we\nhave reached a united resolution in this case, but there\nremains an issue of high importance on which we are\nevidently not agreed and which I note now, lest there be any\nmisperception that it has been resolved by either J.S. or our\ndecision here. The issue is whether the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community\nSchool Dist., 393 U.S. 503 (1969), can be applicable to off-\ncampus speech. I believe it can, and no ruling coming out\ntoday is to the contrary.2\n\n       1\n        This case and J.S. are not related cases in the sense of\nbeing linked on our docket, but they raise nearly identical\nFirst Amendment issues. It is no accident that they were\ntaken en banc at the same time, were argued on the same date,\nand are being decided simultaneously.\n       2\n          I readily acknowledge that “[t]here is some\nuncertainty at the outer boundaries as to when courts should\napply school speech precedents” Morse v. Frederick, 551\nU.S. 393, 401 (2007), and my conclusion about Tinker’s\napplicability in this case and in J.S. does not account for\npermutations that may make Tinker inapposite. Whether the\ntest framed by Tinker will always be applicable is not a matter\n\n\n\n\n                               1\n\f        In Tinker, the Supreme Court emphasized that student\nspeech, “in class or out of it, which for any reason …\nmaterially disrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder\nor invasion of the rights of others is, of course, not\nimmunized by the constitutional guarantee of freedom of\nspeech.” Id. at 513. It also suggested that if there are “facts\nwhich might reasonably have led school authorities to\nforecast substantial disruption of or material interference with\nschool activities,” that too can result in disciplinary measures.\nId. at 514. Given those statements, the applicability of Tinker\nhere seems straight-forward, although it gives no shelter to\nthe defendant school district in this case because, as the\nopinion for our Court notes, “the [Hermitage School] District\ndoes not now challenge the … finding that [the student’s]\nconduct did not result in any substantial disruption[,]” Slip\nOp. at 33, nor did the School District demonstrate that the\nstudent’s speech or conduct created a reasonable\napprehension of substantial disruption.\n\n       Tinker ought likewise to be viewed as providing the\ngoverning rule of law in J.S., but that has been thrown into\nquestion by the competing opinions that have emerged in en\nbanc review. The Majority opinion in J.S. takes the position\nthat whether Tinker is applicable to off-campus speech is\nsomething that can be assumed without being decided since,\nin the Majority’s view, there was no substantial disruption\nand hence the school administrators could not lawfully mete\nout discipline for the despicable speech and behavior detailed\n\n\nto be answered in the abstract. It is enough for present\npurposes to observe that it is an analytical approach the\nSupreme Court has employed for decades and that it is both\nsensible and salutary to apply it in cases like these.\n\n\n\n\n                               2\n\fin that case. Judge Smith’s concurring opinion in J.S. argues\nthat Tinker does not apply. He appears to conclude that, with\nthe exceptions of speech specifically directed at the school\nand of speech while at school-sanctioned events, speech that\ntakes place off-campus is beyond the reach of school\ndiscipline. See J.S. Concurrence, slip op. at 3-4. The\nconcurrence does acknowledge, however, that whether Tinker\napplies “cannot turn solely on where the speaker was sitting\nwhen the speech was originally uttered[,]” because “[s]uch a\nstandard would fail to accommodate the somewhat\n‘everywhere at once’ nature of the internet[,]” id. at 8. Judge\nFisher then skillfully demonstrates in his dissent in J.S., that\nthe heavy focus in the concurrence on an “off-campus versus\non-campus” distinction is artificial and untenable in the world\nwe live in today. See J.S. Dissent, slip op. at n.4. For better\nor worse, wireless internet access, smart phones, tablet\ncomputers, social networking services like Facebook, and\nstream-of-consciousness communications via Twitter give an\nomnipresence to speech that makes any effort to trace First\nAmendment boundaries along the physical boundaries of a\nschool campus a recipe for serious problems in our public\nschools.\n\n        Tinker teaches that schools are not helpless to enforce\nthe reasonable order necessary to accomplish their mission.\nAgain, school officials may curtail speech if they can show\n“facts which might reasonably have led [them] to forecast\nsubstantial disruption of or material interference with school\nactivities.” 393 U.S. at 514. We have similarly stressed that,\n“if a school can point to a well-founded expectation of\ndisruption ... the restriction may pass constitutional muster.”\nSaxe v. State College Area Sch. Dist., 240 F.3d 200, 212 (3d\nCir. 2001). Trying to limit that principle along real property\n\n\n\n\n                               3\n\flines is bound to run into trouble, as the J.S. concurrence\nconcedes by saying that there can be difficulty in knowing\nwhether speech has occurred on or off campus. J.S.\nConcurrence, slip op. at 8. That concession, though, fails to\nget at the fundamental difficulty in cases like these. The\nproblem is not in knowing where a speaker was when uttering\nor otherwise creating speech. Like other historical facts,\nwhere a speaker said something is a matter that can be\ndecided by typical fact-finding techniques. If the point of the\nJ.S. concurrence is not to question where the speaker was\nphysically so much as to question how to characterize the\nspeech itself, i.e., as having on-campus or off-campus effects,\nthen the definitional exercise only obscures the effort to\nanswer the central dilemma, which is how to balance the need\nfor order in our public schools with respect for free speech.\nThat is the problem Tinker aimed to address and it is the\nproblem we are confronting too, so we should be applying\nrather than avoiding Tinker.3\n\n       3\n         The J.S. concurrence cites Morse, as supporting the\nconclusion that Tinker is inapplicable to off-campus speech,\nnoting that the Morse Court “took care to refute the\ncontention that the plaintiff’s speech … did not occur ‘at\nschool’” which “would have been unnecessary” if Tinker\nwere meant to apply to off-campus speech. J.S. Concurrence,\nslip op. at 4. That argument mistakes the import of both\nMorse and Tinker, however. The subject of the speech in\nMorse, which was an odd reference to illegal drug use, had no\nrelation to the school or school activities. 551 U.S. at 396. In\nnone of the opinions issued today is it suggested that such\nspeech, if it took place off campus and apart from a school\nsanctioned event, would be covered by Tinker. Speech that\nneither relates to school nor occurs on campus or during a\n\n\n\n\n                               4\n\f        We cannot sidestep the central tension between good\norder and expressive rights by leaning on property lines.\nWith the tools of modern technology, a student could, with\nmalice aforethought, engineer egregiously disruptive events\nand, if the trouble-maker were savvy enough to tweet the\norganizing communications from his or her cellphone while\nstanding one foot outside school property, the school\nadministrators might succeed in heading off the actual\ndisruption in the building but would be left powerless to\ndiscipline the student. Perhaps all of us participating in these\nen banc decisions would agree on that being problematic. It\nis, after all, a given that “[t]he most stringent protection of\nfree speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in\na theatre and causing a panic.” Schenck v. United States, 249\nU.S. 47, 52 (1919), and no one supposes that the rule would\nbe different if the man were standing outside the theater,\nshouting in. Thus it is hard to see how words that may cause\npandemonium in a public school would be protected by the\nFirst Amendment simply because technology now allows the\ntiming and distribution of a shout to be controlled by\nsomeone beyond the campus boundary.\n\n\n\n\nschool sanctioned event will in all likelihood lack a\nreasonable nexus to school and so will be divorced from the\nquestion of good order in the school, which is the reach of\nTinker. Thus, I do not share the concern expressed in the J.S.\nconcurrence that applying Tinker to off-campus speech would\n“empower schools to regulate students’ expressive activities,”\nor to “suppress political speech” such as “a blog entry\ndefending gay marriage.” J.S. Concurrence, slip op. at 6.\n\n\n\n\n                               5\n\f       If it is accepted that the First Amendment would not\nprotect such a deliberate disturbance, we should acknowledge\nthat we are weighing competing interests and do so in the\nstraightforward though sometimes challenging way directed\nby Tinker. Just as society’s interest in public safety\nsurmounts any claim of right to raise a false fire alarm, by the\nsame token any claimed right to spread scurrilous falsehoods\nabout school administrators may well be outweighed by\nsociety’s legitimate interest in the orderly administration of\npublic schools. Tinker outlines the approach the Supreme\nCourt has given for undertaking that weighing process.\n\n       I worry that the combination of our decisions today in\nthis case and in J.S. may send an “anything goes” signal to\nstudents, faculties, and administrators of public schools. To\nthe extent it appears we have undercut the reasoned discretion\nof administrators to exercise control over the school\nenvironment, we will not have served well those affected by\nthe quality of public education, which is to say everyone. By\nway of some little reassurance, then, it bears emphasis that,\nwhatever else may be drawn from these decisions, we have\nnot declared that Tinker is inapplicable to off-campus speech\nsimply because it occurs off-campus. Despite differing views\non what may constitute a substantial disruption, I hope and\nbelieve that we are all mindful of the challenges school\nadministrators face in providing a safe environment,\nconducive to learning and civic development, for children and\nyoung adults. Those challenges have never been greater than\nthey are today. Modern communications technology, for all\nits positive applications, can be a potent tool for distraction\nand fomenting disruption. Tinker allows school officials to\ndiscipline students based on a reasonable forecast of\n\n\n\n\n                               6\n\fsubstantial disruption, without waiting for the chaos to\nactually hit the hallways.\n\n       In short, nothing in the First Amendment requires\nadministrators to check their common sense at the school\nhouse door. When they must forecast how poisonous\naccusations lobbed over the internet are likely to play out\nwithin the school community, if they “can point to a well-\nfounded expectation of disruption,” Saxe, 240 F.3d at 212, we\nought to be supportive of their reasonable efforts to maintain\nappropriate order. I concur in the Court’s decision in this\ncase, but do not subscribe to any implication that Tinker is\ninapplicable and that school officials would have been\npowerless to head off a substantial disruption.4\n\n      4\n         I take comfort from certain caveats in the opinion.\nWhile putting distance between our Court and the decisions\nof the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\nin Wisniewski v. Board of Educ. of Weedsport Cent. School\nDist., 494 F.3d 34 (2d Cir. 2007), and Doninger v. Niehoff,\n527 F.3d 41 (2d Cir. 2008), the opinion for the Court in this\ncase nonetheless acknowledges that those Second Circuit\nprecedents “stand for … the unremarkable proposition that\nschools may punish expressive conduct that occurs outside of\nschool … .” Slip Op. at 34. It is noteworthy too that the\nMajority opinion in J.S. distinguishes the character of the\nstudent speech at issue in the Second Circuit cases from the\nspeech in J.S. but it does not make any distinction based on\nthe location of the speaker. In any event, I agree with the\nSecond Circuit’s ultimate conclusion in Wisniewski that\nTinker can have applicability to student speech that occurs\noff-campus. See Wisniewski, 494 F.3d at 38 (Ruling on\ninternet speech communicated by a student from a home\n\n\n\n\n                              7\n\fcomputer, and holding, “[w]ith respect to school officials’\nauthority to discipline a student’s expression reasonably\nunderstood as urging violent conduct, we think the\nappropriate First Amendment standard is the one set forth by\nthe Supreme Court in Tinker ... .”).\n\n\n\n\n                             8\n\f",

We hold that, under these\ncircumstances, the First Amendment prohibits the school from\nreaching beyond the schoolyard to impose what might otherwise\n\n                               4\n\fbe appropriate discipline.\n\n       It all began when Justin Layshock used his grandmother’s\ncomputer to access a popular social networking internet web site\nwhere he created a fake internet “profile” of his Hickory High\nSchool Principal, Eric Trosch. His parents filed this action\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983, after the School District punished\nJustin for that conduct. The suit alleges, inter alia, that the\nSchool District’s punishment transcended Justin’s First\nAmendment right of expression. The district court granted\nsummary judgment in favor of Justin on his First Amendment\nclaim. We originally affirmed the district court. See Layshock\nv. Hermitage School Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1405624\"><a href=\"/opinion/1405624/layshock-ex-rel-layshock-v-hermitage-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">593</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">249</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 2010).\nThereafter, we entered an order vacating that opinion and\ngranting rehearing en banc. For the reasons that follow, we once\nagain affirm the district court’s holding that the school district’s\nresponse to Justin’s conduct transcended the protection of free\nexpression guaranteed by the First Amendment.\n\n               I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n       In December of 2005, Justin Layshock was a seventeen-\nyear old senior at Hickory High School, which is part of the\nHermitage School District in Hermitage, Pennsylvania.\nSometime between December 10th and 14th, 2005, while Justin\nwas at his grandmother’s house during non-school hours, he\nused her computer to create what he would later refer to as a\n“parody profile” of his Principal, Eric Trosch. The only school\nresource that was even arguably involved in creating the profile\nwas a photograph of Trosch that Justin copied from the School\nDistrict’s website. Justin copied that picture with a simple “cut\n\n                                 5\n\fand paste” operation using the computer’s internet browser and\nmouse. Justin created the profile on “MySpace.”1 MySpace is\na popular social-networking website that “allows its members\nto create online ‘profiles,’ which are individual web pages on\nwhich members post photographs, videos, and information\nabout their lives and interests.” Doe v. MySpace, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2579773\"><a href=\"/opinion/2579773/doe-v-myspace-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">843</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 845 (W.D. Tex. 2007).2\n\n       Justin created the profile by giving bogus answers to\nsurvey questions taken from various templates that were\ndesigned to assist in creating a profile. The survey included\nquestions about favorite shoes, weaknesses, fears, one’s idea of\na “perfect pizza,” bedtime, etc. All of Justin’s answers were\nbased on a theme of “big,” because Trosch is apparently a large\nman.

Not\nsurprisingly, word of the profile “spread like wildfire” and soon\nreached most, if not all, of Hickory High’s student body.4\n\n       During mid-December 2005, three other students also\nposted unflattering profiles of Trosch on MySpace. Each of\nthose profiles was more vulgar and more offensive than\nJustin’s. Trosch first learned about one of the other profiles\nfrom his daughter, who was in eleventh grade. On Monday,\nDecember 12, 2005, Trosch told his Co-Principal, Chris Gill,\nand the District Superintendent, Karen Ionta, about this other\nprofile and asked the Technology Director, Frank Gingras, to\ndisable it. However, despite the administration’s best efforts,\nstudents found ways to access the profiles. Trosch discovered\nJustin’s profile on Thursday evening, December 15th, and a\nfourth profile on Sunday, December 18th.\n\n     Trosch believed all of the profiles were “degrading,”\n“demeaning,” “demoralizing,” and “shocking.” He was also\n\n\n  4\n    Justin later explained that he made the profile to be funny,\nand did not intend to hurt anyone. However, there was\nobviously nothing “funny” about the profile in the eyes of the\nschool administration.\n\n                               8\n\fconcerned about his reputation and complained to the local\npolice. Although he was not concerned for his safety, he was\ninterested in pressing charges against those responsible for the\nbogus profiles, and he discussed whether the first profile he\ndiscovered might constitute harassment, defamation, or slander.\nHowever, no criminal charges were ever filed against Justin or\nany of the other student authors of profiles.\n\n       On December 15th, Justin used a computer in his\nSpanish classroom to access his MySpace profile of Trosch. He\nalso showed it to other classmates, although he did not\nacknowledge his authorship. After viewing the profile, the\nstudents logged off of MySpace. Justin again attempted to\naccess the profile from school on December 16th, purportedly\nto delete it. School district administrators were unaware of\nJustin’s in-school attempts to access MySpace until their\ninvestigation the following week. Teacher Craig Antush\nglimpsed the profile in his computer lab class and told the\nstudents who were congregating around a computer and\ngiggling to shut it down.\n\n        The School District administrators were not able to\ntotally block students from visiting the MySpace web page at\nschool because Gingras, the Technology Coordinator, was on\nvacation on December 16th. However, the school was able to\ncontrol students’ computer access by limiting the students’ use\nof computers to computer labs or the library where internet\naccess could be supervised. School officials continued to limit\ncomputer use from December 16th until December 21st, which\nwas the last day of school before Christmas recess. Computer\nprogramming classes were also cancelled.\n\n                               9\n\f       According to the district court, the School District’s\ninvestigation revealed how many students had accessed\nMySpace before access to the site at school was disabled, but\nthe school could not determine how many students actually\naccessed any of the Trosch profiles, or which Trosch profiles\nhad been viewed while a student was on the MySpace website.\n\n       School District officials first learned that Justin might\nhave created one of the Trosch profiles on December 21. On\nthat day, Justin and his mother were summoned to a meeting\nwith Superintendent Ionta and Co-Principal Gill. During that\nmeeting, Justin admitted creating a profile, but no disciplinary\naction was then taken against him. After the meeting, without\nprompting from anyone, Justin went to Trosch’s office and\napologized for creating the profile.5\n\n      Justin’s parents were understandably upset over Justin’s\nbehavior. They discussed the matter with him, expressed their\nextreme disappointment, “grounded” him, and prohibited him\nfrom using their home computer.\n\n        On January 3, 2006, the school district sent a letter to\nJustin and his parents giving them notice of an informal hearing\nthat was to be held. The letter read, in pertinent part, as\nfollows:\n\n\n\n     5\n       Trosch later testified that he found Justin’s apology\nrespectful and sincere. Justin followed up with a written letter\nof apology on January 4, 2006.\n\n                              10\n\f             Justin admitted prior to the\n             informal hearing that he created a\n             profile about Mr. Trosch.\n\n             This infraction is a violation of the\n             Hermitage School District\n             Discipline Code: Disruption of the\n             normal school process; Disrespect;\n             H ar a s s men t o f a s c h o o l\n             administrator via computer/internet\n             with remarks that have demeaning\n             implications; Gross misbehavior;\n             Obscene, vulgar and profane\n             language; Computer Policy\n             violations (use of school pictures\n             without authorization).\n\nThe School District subsequently found Justin guilty of all of\nthose charges.\n\n       In addition to a ten-day, out-of-school suspension,\nJustin’s punishment consisted of (1) being placed in the\nAlternative Education Program (the “ACE” program) at the\nhigh school for the remainder of the 2005-2006 school year;6\n\n\n   6\n    Students assigned to ACE meet in a segregated area of the\nhigh school for three hours each day. The program is typically\nreserved for students with behavior and attendance problems\nwho are unable to function in a regular classroom.\n       Prior to creating the Myspace profile, Justin was\n\n                              11\n\f(2) being banned from all extracurricular activities, including\nAcademic Games and foreign-language tutoring;7 and (3) not\nbeing allowed to participate in his graduation ceremony.8 The\nLayshocks were also informed that the School District was\nconsidering expelling Justin. Ironically, Justin, who created the\nleast vulgar and offensive profile, and who was the only student\nto apologize for his behavior, was also the only student\npunished for the MySpace profiles.\n\n            II. DISTRICT COURT PROCEEDINGS\n\n        The Layshocks initiated this action on January 27, 2006,\nby filing a three count complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983\nindividually, and on Justin’s behalf, against the Hermitage\nSchool District, Karen Ionta, Eric Trosch, and Chris Gill, in\ntheir official and individual capacities (hereinafter collectively\nreferred to as the “School District” or “District”). The\nLayshocks also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order\n\n\n\nclassified as a gifted student, was enrolled in advanced\nplacement classes, and had won awards at interscholastic\nacademic competitions. The record does not reveal how the\nSchool District determined that it was appropriate to place such\na student in a program designed for students who could not\nfunction in a classroom.\n   7\n       Justin had been a French tutor to middle school students.\n        8\n      Justin did graduate in 2006 and went on to attend a\nuniversity in New York City.\n\n                                 12\n\fand/or preliminary injunction. Count I of the complaint alleged\nthat the District’s punishment of Justin violated his rights under\nthe First Amendment. Count II alleged that the District’s\npolicies and rules were unconstitutionally vague and/or\noverbroad, both on their face and as applied to Justin. Count III\nalleged that the District’s punishment of Justin interfered with,\nand continued to interfere with, their right as parents to\ndetermine how to best raise, nurture, discipline and educate\ntheir child in violation of their rights under the Due Process\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n        The district court denied the request for a temporary\nrestraining order, Layshock v. Hermitage Sch. Dist., 412 F.\nSupp.2d 502, 508 (W.D. Pa. 2006), and the Layshocks\nwithdrew their motion for a preliminary injunction pursuant to\nthe district court’s efforts at mediation.9 On March 31, 2006,\nthe district court denied the District’s motion to dismiss the\nLayshocks’ claims. The court ruled that the parents may assert\na claim for a violation of their own due process right to “raise,\nnurture, discipline and educate their children” based on a school\ndistrict’s punishment of their child for speech the child uttered\nin the family home.\n\n        After discovery, both sides moved for summary\n\n\n    9\n      The Layshocks agreed to withdraw their motion for a\npreliminary injunction in exchange for the District’s agreement\nto remove Justin from the ACE program, reinstate him to his\nregular classes, allow him to participate in Academic Games,\nand attend his graduation.\n\n                               13\n\fjudgment, and the court thereafter entered summary judgment\nin favor of Justin and against the School District only on the\nFirst Amendment claim.10 The court concluded that a jury trial\nwas necessary to determine compensatory damages and\nattorneys’ fees. See id. at 607.\n\n       Thereafter, the district court denied the District’s motion\nfor entry of judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) or, in the\nalternative, for the issuance of a certificate of appealability\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).\n\n        The parties subsequently filed a joint motion in which\nthey stipulated to damages and requested entry of final\njudgment while preserving all appellate issues pertaining to\nliability. The district court then entered a consent judgment,\nand the School District appealed the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment in favor of Justin on his First Amendment\nclaim.11\n\n\n       10\n         The district court ruled that Trosch was entitled to\nsummary judgment on all counts because he was not involved\nin disciplining Justin. It also held that Ionta and Gill were\nentitled to summary judgment on Justin’s First Amendment\nclaim based on qualified immunity, and that all of the\ndefendants were entitled to summary judgment on the\nvagueness/overbreadth challenge and the parents’ substantive\ndue process claim.\n  11\n     The Layshocks filed a cross-appeal (No. 07-4555) from the\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the\n\n                               14\n\f               III.

DISCUSSION\n1. The First Amendment’s Application in Public Schools.\n\n        In the landmark case of Tinker v. Des Moines Indep.\nCmty. Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107841\"><a href=\"/opinion/107841/tinker-v-des-moines-independent-community-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">503</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1969), a group of high school\nstudents decided to wear black arm bands to school to protest\nthe war in Vietnam. When school officials learned of the\nplanned protest, they preemptively prohibited students from\nwearing armbands. Several students who ignored the ban and\nwore armbands to school anyway were suspended. Id. at 504.\nThose students brought an action against the school through\ntheir parents under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that their First\nAmendment rights had been violated. The district court\nrejected that claim and upheld the constitutionality of the school\nofficials’ action, finding that it had been reasonable to preserve\ndiscipline. Id. 504-505. The district court’s decision was\naffirmed without opinion by an equally divided court of appeals\nsitting en banc. Id. at 505.\n\n        The case was appealed to the Supreme Court, which held\nthat student expression may not be suppressed unless school\nofficials reasonably conclude that it will “materially and\nsubstantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school.” Id.\nat 513. The Court concluded that the students were doing\nnothing more than engaging in political speech, and wearing\narmbands to express “their disapproval of the Vietnam\nhostilities and their advocacy of a truce, to make their views\nknown, and, by their example, to influence others to adopt\nthem.” Id. at 514. The school district’s only interest in banning\n\n                               16\n\fthe speech had been the “mere desire to avoid the discomfort\nand unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular\nviewpoint” or “an urgent wish to avoid the controversy which\nmight result from the expression.” Id. at 509-10. The Court\nheld that this interest was not enough to justify banning “a\nsilent, passive expression of opinion, unaccompanied by any\ndisorder or disturbance.” Id. at 508. In one of its most famous\npassages, the Court explained:\n\n   First Amendment rights, applied in light of the special\n   characteristics of the school environment, are available\n   to teachers and students. It can hardly be argued that\n   either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights\n   to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse\n   gate.\n\nId. at 506.\n\n        Thus, although the Court concluded that the First\nAmendment did reach inside the “schoolhouse gate,” it also\nrecognized that the unique nature of the school environment had\nto be part of any First Amendment inquiry. The Court\nexplained that it “ha[d] repeatedly emphasized the need for\naffirming the comprehensive authority of the States and of\nschool officials, consistent with fundamental constitutional\nsafeguards, to prescribe and control conduct in the schools.” Id.\nat 507.\n\n       The Court next addressed the scope of the First\nAmendment in the context of student speech in Bethel School\nDistrict No. 403 v. Fraser, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111754\"><a href=\"/opinion/111754/bethel-school-dist-no-403-v-fraser/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">675</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986). There, the\n\n                               17\n\fCourt upheld the school’s suspension of a high school student\nfor delivering a nominating speech at a school assembly using\n“an elaborate, graphic, and explicit sexual metaphor.” Id. at\n678. The Court explained:\n\n              The schools, as instruments of the\n              state, may determine that the\n              essential lessons of civil, mature\n              conduct cannot be conveyed in a\n              school that tolerates lewd, indecent,\n              or offensive speech and conduct\n              such as that indulged in by\n              [Fraser].12\n\nId. at 683. In reaching this conclusion, the Court distinguished\nits prior holding in Cohen v. California, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108360\"><a href=\"/opinion/108360/cohen-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1971).\nThere, the Court had struck down an adult’s conviction for\ndisorderly conduct that was based on his wearing a jacket,\ninside a court house, that had an obscenity about the draft\nprinted on it. The Fraser Court explained:\n\n              It does not follow . . . that simply\n              because the use of an offensive\n              form of expression may not be\n              prohibited to adults making what\n\n\n   12\n     In Saxe v. State College Area School District, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772079\"><a href=\"/opinion/772079/david-warren-saxe-student-doe-1-by-and-through-his-next-friend-david/\"><span class=\"volume\">240</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 213 (3d Cir. 2001), we interpreted Fraser as establishing\nthat “there is no First Amendment protection for ‘lewd,’\n‘vulgar,’ ‘indecent,’ and ‘plainly offensive’ speech in school.”\n\n                               18\n\f              the speaker considers a political\n              point, the same latitude must be\n              permitted to children in public\n              school. . . . [T]he First Amendment\n              gives a high school student the\n              classroom right to wear Tinker’s\n              armband, but not Cohen’s jacket.\n\nId. at 682 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The\nCourt concluded that the school could punish Fraser for his\noffensive nominating speech during a school assembly because\nthe First Amendment does not prevent schools from\nencouraging the “fundamental values of ‘habits and manners of\ncivility,’” id. at 681, by “insisting that certain modes of\nexpression are inappropriate and subject to sanctions.” Id. at\n683. Thus, “[t]he determination of what manner of speech in\nthe classroom or in school assembly is inappropriate properly\nrests with the school board.” Id.\n\n       Similarly, in Hazelwood School District. v. Kuhlmeier,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111979\"><a href=\"/opinion/111979/hazelwood-school-dist-v-kuhlmeier/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">260</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1988), the Court held that a principal’s deletion\nof student articles on teen pregnancy from a school-sponsored\nnewspaper did not violate the First Amendment. The Court\ndistinguished Tinker by noting that because the school had not\nopened the newspaper up as a public forum, the school could\n“exercis[e] editorial control over the style and content of student\nspeech in school-sponsored expressive activities so long as [its]\nactions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical\nconcerns.” Id. at 273. The Court explained:\n\n              The question whether the First\n\n                                19\n\f                 Amendment requires a school to\n                 tolerate particular student speech –\n                 the question that we addressed in\n                 Tinker – is different from the\n                 question whether the First\n                 Amendment requires a school\n                 affirmatively to promote particular\n                 student speech.         The former\n                 question addresses educators’\n                 ability to silence a student’s\n                 personal expression that happens to\n                 occur on the school premises. The\n                 latter question concerns educators’\n                 authority over school-sponsored . .\n                 . expressive activities that students,\n                 parents, and members of the public\n                 might reasonably perceive to bear\n                 the imprimatur of the school. . . .\n                 Educators are entitled to exercise\n                 greater control over this second\n                 form of student expression.\n\nId. at 270-71.\n\n        The extent to which First Amendment protections apply\nin the public school context was most recently addressed in\nMorse v. Frederick, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145707\"><a href=\"/opinion/145707/morse-v-frederick/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2007). There, “[a]t a school-\nsanctioned and school-supervised event, a high school principal\n[Morse] saw some of her students unfurl a large banner\nconveying a message she reasonably regarded as promoting\nillegal drug use.” Id. at 396. The banner read: “BONG HiTS\n\n                                  20\n\f4 JESUS.” Id. at 397. “Consistent with established school\npolicy prohibiting such messages at school events, [Morse]\ndirected the students to take down the banner.” Id. at 396.\nFrederick, one of the students who brought the banner to the\nevent, refused to remove it, and Morse “confiscated the banner\nand later suspended [Frederick].” Id. Frederick sued Morse and\nthe school district pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging a\nviolation of his First Amendment right of expression. The\ndistrict court granted summary judgment to the school district\nand Morse, holding that they were entitled to qualified\nimmunity and that they had not infringed Frederick’s First\nAmendment rights. Id. at 399. The Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit reversed.\n\n        The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine\n“whether Frederick had a First Amendment right to wield his\nbanner, and, if so, whether that right was so clearly established\nthat the principal may be held liable for damages.” Id. at 400.13\nThe Court “resolve[d] the first question against Frederick,” and,\ntherefore, did not have to reach the second. Id. The Court\nexplained that its Fourth Amendment jurisprudence recognized\nthat “deterring drug use by school children is an important –\nindeed, perhaps compelling interest.” Id. at 407 (citation\nomitted).      The “special characteristics of the school\nenvironment, and the governmental interest in stopping student\ndrug abuse allow schools to restrict student expression that they\nreasonably regard as promoting such abuse.” Id. at 408. Thus,\n\n\n   13\n      The court of appeals had ruled that the principal was not\nentitled to qualified immunity.\n\n                               21\n\f“a principal may, consistent with the First Amendment, restrict\nstudent speech at a school event, when that speech is reasonably\nviewed as promoting illegal drug use.” Id. at 402. The Court\nrejected Frederick’s claim that since he was across the street\nfrom the school and not on school property, he was not inside\nTinker’s “schoolhouse gate,” and school officials therefore had\nlost authority over him. The Court reasoned that the event\nwhere the banner was unfurled occurred during school hours,\nand it had been approved by the school’s principal as a school\nevent. Id. at 400. School events and field trips off school\ngrounds were subject to the school’s rules for student conduct.\nId. at 400-01.\n\n      It is against this legal backdrop that we must determine\nwhether the District’s actions here violated Justin’s First\nAmendment rights.\n\n       At the outset, it is important to note that the district court\nfound that the District could not “establish[] a sufficient nexus\nbetween Justin’s speech and a substantial disruption of the\nschool environment[,]” Layshock, 496 F. Supp. 2d at 600, and\nthe School District does not challenge that finding on appeal.\nTherefore, the School District is not arguing that it could\nproperly punish Justin under the Tinker exception for student\nspeech that causes a material and substantial disruption of the\nschool environment. See Tinker, 393 U.S. at 513. Rather, the\nDistrict’s argument is twofold:\n\n               [A] sufficient nexus exists between\n               Justin’s creation and distribution of\n               the vulgar and defamatory profile\n\n                                 22\n\f               of Principal Trosch and the School\n               District to permit the School\n               District to regulate this conduct.\n               The “speech” initially began on-\n               campus: Justin entered school\n               property, the School District web\n               site, and misappropriated a picture\n               of the Principal. The “speech” was\n               aimed at the School District\n               community and the Principal and\n               was accessed on campus by Justin.\n                It was reasonably foreseeable that\n               the profile would come to the\n               attention of the School District and\n               the Principal.\n\nDistrict’s Br. at 9.\n\n      2. Justin’s “Entry” Onto the District’s Website.\n\n       The School District’s attempt to forge a nexus between\nthe School and Justin’s profile by relying upon his “entering”\nthe District’s website to “take” the District’s photo of Trosch is\nunpersuasive at best. The argument equates Justin’s act of\nsigning onto a web site with the kind of trespass he would have\ncommitted had he broken into the principal’s office or a\nteacher’s desk; and we reject it.

The articles included such topics as\nmasturbation and prostitution, as well as more standard fare\nsuch as “school lunches, cheerleaders, classmates, and\nteachers.” Id. “Some of the initial preparation for publication\noccurred after school hours in the classroom” of a teacher\nwhom the students consulted “for advice on isolated questions\nof grammar and content.” Id. In addition, “an occasional\narticle was composed or typed within the school building,\nalways after classes,” and the finished magazine was stored in\na “classroom closet” with the classroom teacher’s permission.\nId.\n\n       However, the students were very careful to distribute the\nperiodical only after school and off campus, and the vast\nmajority of their work on the publication was done “in their\nhomes, off campus and after school hours.” Id. The school\nprincipal learned of the magazine when a teacher confiscated a\ncopy from another student on campus, and “following\nconsultation with the Board of Education,” the principal\nimposed penalties that included a five-day suspension of the\nstudents involved.21 Id. at 1046. The punishment was based on\n\n\n   20\n        Thomas was decided after Tinker but before Fraser.\n   21\n     The Principal and Superintendent of Schools had initially\ndecided to take no action pending assessment of the\npublication’s impact. However, they ultimately decided to act\n\n                                24\n\fthe students’ publication of “an allegedly ‘morally offensive,\nindecent, and obscene,’ tabloid.” Id. at 1050 n.12.\n\n        The students sued the school board and other school\nofficials under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. They sought “injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief from alleged deprivations of their First and\nFourteenth Amendment rights.” Id. at 1046. The district court\ndenied the students’ request for injunctive relief based upon its\nconclusion that the publication “was potentially destructive of\ndiscipline in [the school], and therefore not protected by the\nFirst Amendment.” Id. at 1047.\n\n       The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit concluded\nthat the students’ conduct was not sufficiently related to the\nschool to justify the school’s exercise of authority. The court\nexplained:\n\n              [A]ll but an insignificant amount of\n              relevant activity in this case was\n              deliberately designed to take place\n              beyond the schoolhouse gate.\n              Indeed, the [students] diligently\n              labored to ensure that [the\n              magazine] was printed outside the\n              school, and that no copies were\n              sold on school grounds. That a few\n              articles were transcribed on school\n\n\nafter being contacted by the President of the Board of Education.\nThomas, 607 F.2d at 1045-46.\n\n                               25\n\f               typewriters, and that the finished\n               product was secretly and\n               unobtrusively stored in a teacher’s\n               closet do not alter the fact that [the\n               magazine] was conceived,\n               executed, and distributed outside\n               the school. At best, therefore, any\n               activity within the school itself was\n               De minimis.\n\nId. at 1050.\n\n       The court reached that conclusion even though the\nstudents actually stored the offending publication inside a\nclassroom and did some minimal amount of work on the\nperiodical in school using school resources. Here, the\nrelationship between Justin’s conduct and the school is far more\nattenuated than in Thomas. We agree with the analysis in\nThomas. Accordingly, because the School District concedes that\nJustin’s profile did not cause disruption in the school, we do not\nthink that the First Amendment can tolerate the School District\nstretching its authority into Justin’s grandmother’s home and\nreaching Justin while he is sitting at her computer after school\nin order to punish him for the expressive conduct that he\nengaged in there.\n\n       We realize, of course, that it is now well established that\nTinker’s “schoolhouse gate” is not constructed solely of the\nbricks and mortar surrounding the school yard. Nevertheless,\nthe concept of the “school yard” is not without boundaries and\nthe reach of school authorities is not without limits. In Morse,\n\n                                26\n\fthe Court held that the First Amendment does not prevent a\nprincipal from “restrict[ing] student speech at a school event,\nwhen that speech is reasonably viewed as promoting illegal\ndrug use.” 551 U.S. at 403 (emphasis added). Nevertheless,\nwith regard to expressive conduct that occurs outside of the\nschool context, the Court, referring to its earlier decision in\nFraser, was careful to note that “[h]ad Fraser delivered the\nsame speech in a public forum outside the school context, it\nwould have been protected.” 551 U.S. at 404 (citations\nomitted).\n\n       It would be an unseemly and dangerous precedent to\nallow the state, in the guise of school authorities, to reach into\na child’s home and control his/her actions there to the same\nextent that it can control that child when he/she participates in\nschool sponsored activities. Allowing the District to punish\nJustin for conduct he engaged in while at his grandmother’s\nhouse using his grandmother’s computer would create just such\na precedent, and we therefore conclude that the district court\ncorrectly ruled that the District’s response to Justin’s expressive\nconduct violated the First Amendment guarantee of free\nexpression.\n\n  3. The District Cannot Punish Justin Merely Because\n         His Speech Reached Inside the School.\n\n       As noted above, the School District also claims that\nJustin’s speech can be treated as “on-campus” speech because\nit “was aimed at the School District community and the\nPrincipal and was accessed on campus by Justin [and] [i]t was\nreasonably foreseeable that the profile would come to the\n\n                                27\n\fattention of the School District and the Principal.”\n\n       The district court held that the School District’s\npunishment of Justin was not appropriate under Fraser because\n“[t]here is no evidence that Justin engaged in any lewd or\nprofane speech while in school.” Layshock, 496 F. Supp.2d at\n599-600.      It also held that Justin’s punishment was not\nappropriate under Tinker because the School District did “not\nestablish[] a sufficient nexus between Justin’s speech and a\nsubstantial disruption of the school environment.” Id. at 600.\n\n       The School District does not dispute the district court’s\nfinding that its punishment of Justin was not appropriate under\nTinker; it rests its argument on the Supreme Court’s analysis in\nFraser. In the School District’s view, Justin’s speech – his\nMySpace profile of Trosch – was unquestionably vulgar, lewd\nand offensive, and therefore not shielded by the First\nAmendment because it ended up inside the school community.22\n\n\n  22\n     The District’s argument in this regard is not crystal clear as\nits brief suggests that it can react to Justin’s profile merely\nbecause it was lewd and vulgar. For example, the District\nsummarizes one of its arguments as follows:\n\n       The School District did not violate the First\n       Amendment by punishing Justin for engaging in\n       conduct which interfered with the School\n       District’s “highly appropriate function . . . to\n       prohibit the use of vulgar and offensive terms in\n       public discourse.”\n\n                                28\n\f Similarly, the School District argues that under our decision in\nSaxe, see n.12, supra, there is no First Amendment protection\nfor lewd, vulgar, indecent or plainly offensive speech in\nschools.23\n\n        The District rests this argument primarily on three cases\nwhich it claims allow it to respond to a student’s vulgar speech\nwhen that speech is posted on the internet.

However, as we will explain, each of those\ncases involved off campus expressive conduct that resulted in\n\n\nDistrict’s Br. at 10 (ellipsis in original).\n\n          However, we reject out of hand any suggestion that\n          schools can police students’ out-of-school speech by\n          patrolling “the public discourse.” Accordingly, we will\n          assume that the District is arguing that it can control\n          lewd and vulgar speech as authorized under Fraser.\n     23\n        In Saxe, we did state: “Under Fraser, a school may\ncategorically prohibit lewd, vulgar or profane language.” 240\nF.3d at 214. However, when read in context, it is clear that we\nwere there referring only to speech inside Tinker’s schoolhouse\ngate. Thus, we summarized the holding in Fraser as follows:\n“According to Fraser, . . . there is no First Amendment\nprotection for ‘lewd,’ ‘vulgar,’ ‘indecent,’ and ‘plainly\noffensive’ speech in school.” Id. at 213 (emphasis added).\n\n                                 29\n\fa substantial disruption of the school, and the courts allowed the\nschools to respond to the substantial disruption that the\nstudent’s out of school conduct caused.\n\n        In J.S., an eighth grade student created a threatening\nwebsite aimed at his algebra teacher that went so far as to\nexplain “[w]hy Should She Die,” and requested money “to help\npay for the hitman.” 807 A.2d at 851. The site frightened\nseveral students and parents and the algebra teacher was so\nbadly frightened that she ended up having to take medical leave\nfrom her teaching responsibilities. As a result of her inability\nto return to teaching, “three substitute teachers were required to\nbe utilized which disrupted the educational process of the\nstudents.” Id. at 852. “In sum, the web site created disorder\nand significantly and adversely impacted the delivery of\ninstruction.” Id. at 869. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania\nconcluded that the resulting disruption of instruction and the\neducational environment allowed the school to punish the\nstudent for his expressive conduct even though the student\ncreated the website from his home.24\n\n      Similarly, the school suspended the student in\nWisniewski, for creating an image on the internet from his home\n\n\n    24\n       The district court believed that J.S. was “on point” but\n“respectfully reache[d] a slightly different balance between\nstudent expression and school authority.” Layshock, 496 F.\nSupp. 2d at 602. However, we do not think J.S. is “on point” or\nthe least bit helpful because there is no comparison between the\nimpact of the conduct there and the impact of the conduct here.\n\n                               30\n\fcomputer that depicted a pistol firing a bullet at a teacher’s head\nwith dots representing splattered blood above the head. 494\nF.3d at 36. The words: “Kill Mr. VanderMolen” were printed\nbeneath the drawing. VanderMolen was the student’s English\nteacher. The student created the image a couple of weeks after\nhis class was instructed that threats would not be tolerated at the\nschool, and would be treated as acts of violence. The court of\nappeals affirmed the district court’s grant of summary judgment\nin favor of the school district in a suit alleging a violation of the\nFirst Amendment based on the school’s suspension of the\nstudent for the out-of-school conduct. The court reasoned that\n“[t]he fact that [the student’s] creation and transmission of the\nicon occurred away from school property [did] not necessarily\ninsulate him from school discipline.” 494 F.3d at 39. The court\nreasoned that “even if [the student’s] transmission of an [image]\ndepicting and calling for the killing of his teacher could be\nviewed as an expression of opinion within the meaning of\nTinker,” it was not protected by the First Amendment because\n“it cross[ed] the boundary of protected speech and pose[d] a\nreasonably foreseeable risk [of] materially and substantially\ndisrupting the work and discipline of the school.” Id. at 38-9\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n        Finally, in Doninger, a student, who was a class officer,\nposted a message on her publicly accessible web log or “blog”\nthat resulted in school authorities not allowing her to participate\nin an election for class office.25 Id. at 43. In her message, she\n\n\n   25\n    “A blog (a contraction of the term ‘web log’) is a type of\nwebsite, usually maintained by an individual with regular entries\n\n                                 31\n\fcomplained about a school activity that was cancelled “due to\ndouchebags in central office,” and encouraged others to contact\nthe central office to “piss [the district superintendent] off more.”\n Id. at 45. When the principal learned of the student’s posting,\nshe prohibited her from running for senior class secretary\n“because [the student’s] conduct had failed to display the\ncivility and good citizenship expected of class officers.” Id. at\n46. The student and her parents then sought injunctive relief in\nthe form of a court order allowing her to run for class office.\nThe court of appeals affirmed the district court’s denial of relief\nbecause the student’s out of school expressive conduct “created\na foreseeable risk of substantial disruption to the work and\ndiscipline of the school.” Id. at 53.26 “ [The student] herself\ntestified that . . . students were ‘all riled up’ and that a sit-in\nwas threatened.” Id. at 51. Accordingly, the court of appeals\nheld that the student’s mother “failed to show clearly that [the\nstudent’s] First Amendment rights were violated when she was\ndisqualified from running” for class office. Id. at 53.\n\n\n\n\nor commentary, descriptions of events, or other material such as\ngraphics or video. . . . ‘Blog’ can also be used as a verb,\nmeaning to maintain or add content to a blog.”\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog) (last visited September 23,\n2010).\n   26\n      The blog had resulted in numerous calls and emails to the\nprincipal, and the court of appeals noted that the blog also used\ninaccurate and misleading information to rally those who read\nit to contact the school principal.\n\n                                32\n\f        However, for our purposes, it is particularly important to\nnote that the court in Doninger was careful to explain that it\n“[had] no occasion to consider whether a different, more serious\nconsequence than disqualification from student office would\nraise constitutional concerns.” Id. at 53. Of course, Justin’s\nconsequences were more serious; he was suspended. Moreover,\nin citing Doninger, we do not suggest that we agree with that\ncourt’s conclusion that the student’s out of school expressive\nconduct was not protected by the First Amendment there.\nRather, we cite Doninger only to respond to the School\nDistrict’s contention that that case supports its actions against\nJustin.\n\n       As noted earlier, the District’s January 3, 2006, letter to\nthe Layshocks advising them of Justin’s suspension reads, in\nrelevant part, that it was punishing Justin because “Justin\nadmitted prior to the informal hearing that he created a profile\nabout Mr. Trosch.” Although the letter also mentions\ndisruption, we have taken care to stress that the District does not\nnow challenge the district court’s finding that Justin’s conduct\ndid not result in any substantial disruption. Moreover, when\npressed at oral argument, counsel for the School District\nconceded that the District was relying solely on the fact that\nJustin created the profile of Trosch, and not arguing that it\ncreated any substantial disruption in the school. However, as\nnoted above, Fraser does not allow the School District to\npunish Justin for expressive conduct which occurred outside of\nthe school context. See Morse, 551 U.S. at 404 (“Had Fraser\ndelivered the same speech in a public forum outside the school\ncontext, it would have been protected.”) (citations omitted).\nMoreover, we have found no authority that would support\n\n                                33\n\fpunishment for creating such a profile unless it results in\nforeseeable and substantial disruption of school.\n\n       We believe the cases relied upon by the School District\nstand for nothing more than the rather unremarkable proposition\nthat schools may punish expressive conduct that occurs outside\nof school, as if it occurred inside the “schoolhouse gate,” under\ncertain very limited circumstances, none of which are present\nhere.\n       As the court of appeals explained in Thomas: “[O]ur\nwillingness to defer to the schoolmaster’s expertise in\nadministering school discipline rests, in large measure, upon the\nsupposition that the arm of authority does not reach beyond the\nschoolhouse gate.” 607 F.2d at 1045. We need not now define\nthe precise parameters of when the arm of authority can reach\nbeyond the schoolhouse gate because, as we noted earlier, the\ndistrict court found that Justin’s conduct did not disrupt the\nschool, and the District does not appeal that finding. Thus, we\nneed only hold that Justin’s use of the District’s web site does\nnot constitute entering the school, and that the District is not\nempowered to punish his out of school expressive conduct under\nthe circumstances here.\n\n        Based on those two conclusions, we will affirm the\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment to Justin Layshock\non his First Amendment claim.27\n\n\n   27\n    The District argues in the alternative that it did not violate\nthe First Amendment by punishing Justin because his speech\nwas defamatory and not protected by the First Amendment. The\n\n                               34\n\fLayshocks respond by arguing that Justin’s profile is a parody\nthat cannot constitute defamation. However, whether or not we\naccept the characterization of a “parody,” the issue before us is\nlimited to whether the District had the authority to punish Justin\nfor expressive conduct outside of school that the District\nconsidered lewd and offensive.\n\n                               35\n\fLayshock v.

It also suggested that if there are “facts\nwhich might reasonably have led school authorities to\nforecast substantial disruption of or material interference with\nschool activities,” that too can result in disciplinary measures.\nId. at 514. Given those statements, the applicability of Tinker\nhere seems straight-forward, although it gives no shelter to\nthe defendant school district in this case because, as the\nopinion for our Court notes, “the [Hermitage School] District\ndoes not now challenge the … finding that [the student’s]\nconduct did not result in any substantial disruption[,]” Slip\nOp. at 33, nor did the School District demonstrate that the\nstudent’s speech or conduct created a reasonable\napprehension of substantial disruption.\n\n       Tinker ought likewise to be viewed as providing the\ngoverning rule of law in J.S., but that has been thrown into\nquestion by the competing opinions that have emerged in en\nbanc review. The Majority opinion in J.S. takes the position\nthat whether Tinker is applicable to off-campus speech is\nsomething that can be assumed without being decided since,\nin the Majority’s view, there was no substantial disruption\nand hence the school administrators could not lawfully mete\nout discipline for the despicable speech and behavior detailed\n\n\nto be answered in the abstract. It is enough for present\npurposes to observe that it is an analytical approach the\nSupreme Court has employed for decades and that it is both\nsensible and salutary to apply it in cases like these.\n\n\n\n\n                               2\n\fin that case. Judge Smith’s concurring opinion in J.S. argues\nthat Tinker does not apply. He appears to conclude that, with\nthe exceptions of speech specifically directed at the school\nand of speech while at school-sanctioned events, speech that\ntakes place off-campus is beyond the reach of school\ndiscipline. See J.S. Concurrence, slip op. at 3-4. The\nconcurrence does acknowledge, however, that whether Tinker\napplies “cannot turn solely on where the speaker was sitting\nwhen the speech was originally uttered[,]” because “[s]uch a\nstandard would fail to accommodate the somewhat\n‘everywhere at once’ nature of the internet[,]” id. at 8. Judge\nFisher then skillfully demonstrates in his dissent in J.S., that\nthe heavy focus in the concurrence on an “off-campus versus\non-campus” distinction is artificial and untenable in the world\nwe live in today. See J.S. Dissent, slip op. at n.4. For better\nor worse, wireless internet access, smart phones, tablet\ncomputers, social networking services like Facebook, and\nstream-of-consciousness communications via Twitter give an\nomnipresence to speech that makes any effort to trace First\nAmendment boundaries along the physical boundaries of a\nschool campus a recipe for serious problems in our public\nschools.\n\n        Tinker teaches that schools are not helpless to enforce\nthe reasonable order necessary to accomplish their mission.\nAgain, school officials may curtail speech if they can show\n“facts which might reasonably have led [them] to forecast\nsubstantial disruption of or material interference with school\nactivities.” 393 U.S. at 514. We have similarly stressed that,\n“if a school can point to a well-founded expectation of\ndisruption ... the restriction may pass constitutional muster.”\nSaxe v. State College Area Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772079\"><a href=\"/opinion/772079/david-warren-saxe-student-doe-1-by-and-through-his-next-friend-david/\"><span class=\"volume\">240</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 212 (3d\nCir. 2001). Trying to limit that principle along real property\n\n\n\n\n                               3\n\flines is bound to run into trouble, as the J.S. concurrence\nconcedes by saying that there can be difficulty in knowing\nwhether speech has occurred on or off campus. J.S.\nConcurrence, slip op. at 8. That concession, though, fails to\nget at the fundamental difficulty in cases like these. The\nproblem is not in knowing where a speaker was when uttering\nor otherwise creating speech. Like other historical facts,\nwhere a speaker said something is a matter that can be\ndecided by typical fact-finding techniques. If the point of the\nJ.S. concurrence is not to question where the speaker was\nphysically so much as to question how to characterize the\nspeech itself, i.e., as having on-campus or off-campus effects,\nthen the definitional exercise only obscures the effort to\nanswer the central dilemma, which is how to balance the need\nfor order in our public schools with respect for free speech.\nThat is the problem Tinker aimed to address and it is the\nproblem we are confronting too, so we should be applying\nrather than avoiding Tinker.3\n\n       3\n         The J.S. concurrence cites Morse, as supporting the\nconclusion that Tinker is inapplicable to off-campus speech,\nnoting that the Morse Court “took care to refute the\ncontention that the plaintiff’s speech … did not occur ‘at\nschool’” which “would have been unnecessary” if Tinker\nwere meant to apply to off-campus speech. J.S. Concurrence,\nslip op. at 4. That argument mistakes the import of both\nMorse and Tinker, however. The subject of the speech in\nMorse, which was an odd reference to illegal drug use, had no\nrelation to the school or school activities. 551 U.S. at 396. In\nnone of the opinions issued today is it suggested that such\nspeech, if it took place off campus and apart from a school\nsanctioned event, would be covered by Tinker. Speech that\nneither relates to school nor occurs on campus or during a\n\n\n\n\n                               4\n\f        We cannot sidestep the central tension between good\norder and expressive rights by leaning on property lines.\nWith the tools of modern technology, a student could, with\nmalice aforethought, engineer egregiously disruptive events\nand, if the trouble-maker were savvy enough to tweet the\norganizing communications from his or her cellphone while\nstanding one foot outside school property, the school\nadministrators might succeed in heading off the actual\ndisruption in the building but would be left powerless to\ndiscipline the student. Perhaps all of us participating in these\nen banc decisions would agree on that being problematic. It\nis, after all, a given that “[t]he most stringent protection of\nfree speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in\na theatre and causing a panic.” Schenck v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99296\"><a href=\"/opinion/99296/schenck-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 52 (1919), and no one supposes that the rule would\nbe different if the man were standing outside the theater,\nshouting in. Thus it is hard to see how words that may cause\npandemonium in a public school would be protected by the\nFirst Amendment simply because technology now allows the\ntiming and distribution of a shout to be controlled by\nsomeone beyond the campus boundary.\n\n\n\n\nschool sanctioned event will in all likelihood lack a\nreasonable nexus to school and so will be divorced from the\nquestion of good order in the school, which is the reach of\nTinker. Thus, I do not share the concern expressed in the J.S.\nconcurrence that applying Tinker to off-campus speech would\n“empower schools to regulate students’ expressive activities,”\nor to “suppress political speech” such as “a blog entry\ndefending gay marriage.” J.S. Concurrence, slip op. at 6.\n\n\n\n\n                               5\n\f       If it is accepted that the First Amendment would not\nprotect such a deliberate disturbance, we should acknowledge\nthat we are weighing competing interests and do so in the\nstraightforward though sometimes challenging way directed\nby Tinker. Just as society’s interest in public safety\nsurmounts any claim of right to raise a false fire alarm, by the\nsame token any claimed right to spread scurrilous falsehoods\nabout school administrators may well be outweighed by\nsociety’s legitimate interest in the orderly administration of\npublic schools. Tinker outlines the approach the Supreme\nCourt has given for undertaking that weighing process.\n\n       I worry that the combination of our decisions today in\nthis case and in J.S. may send an “anything goes” signal to\nstudents, faculties, and administrators of public schools. To\nthe extent it appears we have undercut the reasoned discretion\nof administrators to exercise control over the school\nenvironment, we will not have served well those affected by\nthe quality of public education, which is to say everyone. By\nway of some little reassurance, then, it bears emphasis that,\nwhatever else may be drawn from these decisions, we have\nnot declared that Tinker is inapplicable to off-campus speech\nsimply because it occurs off-campus. Despite differing views\non what may constitute a substantial disruption, I hope and\nbelieve that we are all mindful of the challenges school\nadministrators face in providing a safe environment,\nconducive to learning and civic development, for children and\nyoung adults. Those challenges have never been greater than\nthey are today. Modern communications technology, for all\nits positive applications, can be a potent tool for distraction\nand fomenting disruption. Tinker allows school officials to\ndiscipline students based on a reasonable forecast of\n\n\n\n\n                               6\n\fsubstantial disruption, without waiting for the chaos to\nactually hit the hallways.\n\n       In short, nothing in the First Amendment requires\nadministrators to check their common sense at the school\nhouse door. When they must forecast how poisonous\naccusations lobbed over the internet are likely to play out\nwithin the school community, if they “can point to a well-\nfounded expectation of disruption,” Saxe, 240 F.3d at 212, we\nought to be supportive of their reasonable efforts to maintain\nappropriate order. I concur in the Court’s decision in this\ncase, but do not subscribe to any implication that Tinker is\ninapplicable and that school officials would have been\npowerless to head off a substantial disruption.4\n\n      4\n         I take comfort from certain caveats in the opinion.\nWhile putting distance between our Court and the decisions\nof the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\nin Wisniewski v. Board of Educ. of Weedsport Cent. School\nDist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1426989\"><a href=\"/opinion/1426989/wisniewski-v-board-of-educ-of-weedsport-cent-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. 2007), and Doninger v.

It is noteworthy too that the\nMajority opinion in J.S. distinguishes the character of the\nstudent speech at issue in the Second Circuit cases from the\nspeech in J.S. but it does not make any distinction based on\nthe location of the speaker. In any event, I agree with the\nSecond Circuit’s ultimate conclusion in Wisniewski that\nTinker can have applicability to student speech that occurs\noff-campus.
