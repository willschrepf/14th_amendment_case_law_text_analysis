It is undisputed that federal and state law protects group homes for\n            recovering alcoholics and drug addicts from discrimination that\n            would prevent them from locating and operating in residential\n            neighborhoods. It is also undisputed that the deed restriction at\n            issue in this case expressly provides that its restriction of permitted\n            uses to “single family residential use” does not exclude those\n            protected by federal and state law, such as group homes.\n               a. Did the trial err in finding that the HOA conclusively proved\n                  that Mr. Tarr’s operation of his property as a group home for\n                  recovering alcoholics and drug addicts is not a “residential\n                  use” within the meaning of the deed restrictions?\n               b. Did the trial court err in ruling that it was Mr. Tarr’s burden to\n                  prove that his use of his property as a protected group home did\n                  not breach the deed restrictions?\n         2. Is there a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether the\n            residents of Westlake Recovery House are handicapped or disabled\n            under the applicable federal and state statutes?\n         3. Did the trial court err in awarding attorney’s fees to the HOA even\n            where the only relief the HOA obtained is an injunction that is void\n            and unenforceable?\nIntroduction ................................................................................................................1\nStatement of Facts ......................................................................................................3\n         The HOA’s First Motion for Partial Summary Judgment ...............................6\n         The HOA’s Second Motion for Partial Summary Judgment ...........................8\n\n                                                              v\n\f         The HOA’s Third Motion for Summary Judgment ........................................12\n         The Final Judgment .......................................................................................12\nSummary of the Argument.......................................................................................13\nArgument..................................................................................................................16\nI. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment for the HOA on its\n   claim that Westlake Recovery House breaches the deed restrictions. ..............17\n     A. The HOA did not meet its burden of conclusively proving that the\n        Westlake Recovery House residents were not authorized to remain\n        “by any state or federal law” and, thus that Mr. Tarr’s group home\n        violated the deed restriction.........................................................................19\n           1. The HOA failed to meet its burden—the Texas and Federal Fair\n              Housing Acts and supporting case law protect group homes such\n              as Mr. Tarr’s. .........................................................................................21\n           2. The HOA’s assertion that Mr. Tarr’s group home is a “for profit\n              duplex” is immaterial to residential use under paragraph 4.1. ..............24\n     B. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment with respect to\n        the affirmative defense that statutory law prohibits enforcement of\n        the deed restriction.......................................................................................31\n           1. The evidence indicates that the Westlake Recovery House\n              residents’ impairments limit a major life activity. ................................34\n           2. There is a fact issue with respect to whether the residents are\n              “regarded as disabled” under the third definition. ................................42\n     C. The HOA failed to give Mr. Tarr proper notice of the alleged\n        violations of the deed restrictions. ...............................................................46\nII. The trial court erroneously granted summary judgment on Mr. Tarr’s\n    counterclaims based entirely on its erroneous summary judgment on the\n    affirmative defenses. ..........................................................................................47\n     A. Because the first partial summary judgment was in error, it cannot\n        negate Mr. Tarr’s counterclaims..................................................................48\n     B. Even a valid partial summary judgment on Mr. Tarr’s statutory\n        affirmative defenses would not negate the counterclaims. .........................48\n\n\n                                                            vi\n\fIII.

Mr. Tarr counterclaimed for discrimination under\n                the Federal Housing Act, Texas Fair Housing Act, and other\n                related statutes and ordinances.\n\nTrial Court:    98th District Court of Travis County, Texas\n                Honorable Rhonda Hurley, presiding\n\nTrial Court     The trial court (Judge Amy Clark Meachum) granted ex parte\nProceedings:    temporary restraining order on August 14, 2012.\n\n                The case was adjudicated in three separate partial summary\n                judgments, culminating in a final modified judgment entered\n                October 28, 2014.

It is undisputed that federal and state law protects group homes for\n     recovering alcoholics and drug addicts from discrimination that would\n     prevent them from locating and operating in residential neighborhoods. It\n     is also undisputed that the deed restriction at issue in this case expressly\n     provides that its restriction of permitted uses to “single family residential\n     use” does not exclude those protected by federal and state law, such as\n     group homes.\n\n     a.    Did the trial err in finding that the HOA conclusively proved that\n           Mr. Tarr’s operation of his property as a group home for recovering\n           alcoholics and drug addicts is not a “residential use” within the\n           meaning of the deed restrictions?\n\n     b.    Did the trial court err in ruling that it was Mr. Tarr’s burden to prove\n           that his use of his property as a protected group home did not breach\n           the deed restrictions?\n\n2.   Is there a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether the\n     residents of Westlake Recovery House are handicapped or disabled under\n     the applicable federal and state statutes?\n\n3.   Did the trial court err in awarding attorney’s fees to the HOA even where\n     the only relief the HOA obtained is an injunction that is void and\n     unenforceable?\n\n\n\n\n                                    xvi\n\fTO THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS:\n\n      Appellant Kevin Tarr respectfully submits this Brief.\n\n                                INTRODUCTION\n\n      Kevin Tarr owns and operates Westlake Recovery House, a residential group\n\nhome for men recovering from alcohol and drug addictions located in the Lantana\n\nSouthwest subdivision. Courts have long and routinely held that group homes in\n\nresidential neighborhoods are protected by federal and state law. “Since the [Federal\n\nHousing Act] Amendments took effect, courts have made clear that single family\n\ndeed restrictions cannot be used to exclude group homes for disabled persons from\n\nsingle family neighborhoods.” United States v. Wagner, 940 F. Supp. 972, 979\n\n(N.D. Tex. 1996). In the Fair Housing Act (“FHA”), the federal government\n\nexpressed a clear policy in favor of removing barriers preventing individuals with\n\nphysical and mental disabilities from living in group homes in residential settings\n\nand against restrictions that serve to exclude congregate living arrangements for the\n\ndisabled. “The legislative history of the amended Fair Housing Act reflects the\n\nnational policy of deinstitutionalizing disabled individuals and integrating them into\n\nthe mainstream of society.” United States v. Scott, 788 F. Supp. 1555, 1561 n.5 (D.\n\nKan. 1992). Toward this end, Congress intended the FHA “to protect the right of\n\nhandicapped persons to live in the residence of their choice in the community.” City\n\nof Edmonds v. Washington State Bldg. Code Council, 18 F.3d 802, 806 (9th Cir.\n\n                                          1\n\f1994), aff’d, City of Edmonds v. Oxford House, Inc., 514 U.S. 725, 115 S. Ct. 1776,\n\n131 L. Ed. 2d 801 (1995).\n\n      Further, the FHA “is intended to prohibit special restrictive covenants [that]\n\nexclud[e], for example, congregate living arrangements for persons with handicaps.”\n\nScott, 788 F. Supp. at 1561. In Deep East Texas Regional Mental Health and Mental\n\nRetardation Servs. v. Kinnear, the court explained:\n\n            It is now well established that the Fair Housing Act\n            prohibits the enforcement of restrictive covenants that\n            discriminate or have the effect of discriminating on the\n            basis of handicap. The Fair Housing Act has been\n            declared to prohibit special restrictions, special restrictive\n            covenants, or other terms or conditions or denials of\n            service because of an individual’s handicap and which\n            exclude congregate living arrangements for persons with\n            handicaps.\n\n877 S.W.2d 550, 558 (Tex. App.—Beaumont 1994, no writ). This is true of the\n\nTexas Fair Housing Act as well. TEX. PROP. CODE § 301.002(3) (stating that the\n\npurpose of the Texas Fair Housing Act is to “provide rights and remedies\n\nsubstantially equivalent to those granted under federal law”); Richardson v. SV\n\nAlmeda I Ltd. P’ship, No. 01-11-01004-CV, 2013 WL 4680392, at *6 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] Aug. 29, 2013, no pet.) (mem. op.). It is beyond dispute that\n\nthose recovering from alcohol and drug addictions like the residents of Westlake\n\nRecovery House are impaired within the statutory meaning. Indeed, the record is\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\freplete with evidence that the residents are handicapped by reason of their\n\naddictions.\n\n      But the Lantana Southwest Homeowners’ Association does not want the\n\nWestlake Recovery House in its neighborhood and sought an injunction to force the\n\nhandicapped residents out. The trial court failed to properly recognize and apply the\n\nlegal protections, which arise in three separate ways in this case to protect Mr. Tarr’s\n\ngroup recovery home:\n\n      1) As an element of the HOA’s claim that Mr. Tarr’s group home violates\n         the restrictive covenant’s residential use limitation: The deed restriction\n         on which the HOA bases its claim expressly provides that it does not\n         exclude uses that are protected by federal or state law, which includes the\n         FHA’s protection of group homes for the handicapped. Thus, to prove\n         breach, the HOA must prove that Mr. Tarr’s use of the property as a group\n         home falls outside the deed restriction’s inclusive definition.\n      2) As an affirmative defense: Even if the deed restrictions had not\n         incorporated the statutory protections into the definition of residential use,\n         the statutes would nevertheless prohibit discriminatory enforcement of\n         such a deed restriction.\n      3) As claims for relief based on discrimination: The federal and Texas\n         FHAs provide causes of action for those aggrieved by discriminatory\n         conduct in violation of the FHA.\n\nThis Court should reverse and remand for a trial.\n\n                            STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      Appellant Kevin Tarr operates a group home for men recovering from drug\n\nand alcohol addictions in a residential neighborhood in southwest Austin. Mr. Tarr\n\nbegan operating Westlake Recovery House on July 1, 2012, as a group home offering\n\n\n                                           3\n\fa safe and supportive living environment for men who are recovering from drug or\n\nalcohol addiction. CR294; SCR19-20; SCR23-37. In addition to living quarters,\n\nWestlake Recovery House provides in-house twelve-step meetings, drug testing,\n\naccountability partners, and life skills coaching to facilitate recovery and to help the\n\nresidents stay off drugs and alcohol. CR294; SCR19-20; SCR23-37. The residents\n\nprocure their own food, do their own cooking, and generally live communally as a\n\nfamily. CR284, 415.\n\n      Westlake Recovery House accepts only residents who have a “handicap” or\n\n“disability” as those terms are defined in the Federal Fair Housing Act, Texas Fair\n\nHousing Act, Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Federal Rehabilitation Act.\n\nCR294-95; SCR19-20; SCR23-37. Westlake Recovery House accepts only those\n\napplicants who require the special living conditions provided in a group recovery\n\nhome like Westlake Recovery House. CR294-95; SCR20; SCR23-37. Further,\n\nWestlake Recovery House does not accept or allow any person to remain who is\n\ncurrently using drugs or alcohol. CR294-95; SCR20.\n\n      Mr. Tarr’s property is located within the Lantana Southwest subdivision and\n\nis subject to homeowners’ association deed restrictions (the “deed restrictions”).\n\nCR294; CR10-36. Paragraph 4.1 provides:\n\n             Residential Use. All Lots shall be improved and used\n             solely for single family residential use, inclusive of a\n             garage, fencing and other such Improvements as are\n             necessary or customarily incident to residential use. No\n                                           4\n\f              building, outbuilding or portion of either may be built on\n              a Lot for use as income-producing property (i.e., for lease\n              to tenants who do not occupy an entire Lot). A “single\n              family” shall be defined as any number of persons related\n              by blood, marriage or adoption, and shall also include\n              foster children and domestic servants. This Declaration\n              shall not, however, exclude from a Lot any person who is\n              authorized to so remain by any state or federal law.\n\nCR16, ¶4.1.\n\n      Responding to concerns expressed by his neighbors, Mr. Tarr sent a letter to\n\nthem explaining that he was using his property as a recovery house and that this use\n\nis protected by federal and state law. CR38. On August 10, 2012, Steve Portnoy,\n\nthe president of the HOA, sent an email to a Lantana homeowner and representatives\n\nof the HOA’s management company in which he stated:\n\n              This has now escalated past the point of what is even\n              remotely acceptable for our neighborhood. A halfway\n              house? This has to be shut down and quickly. Can you\n              please have the HOA attorney contact me about pursuing\n              a more aggressive course of action?\n\nSCR21. That same day, the HOA’s attorney sent Mr. Tarr a letter threatening to\n\nbring suit. CR474. Although the deed restrictions require ten-days’ notice before\n\nfiling suit (CR34, ¶12.8), only four days later, on August 14, 2012, Appellee Lantana\n\nSouthwest Homeowners’ Association, Inc. (the “HOA”), filed its “Original Petition,\n\nApplication for Temporary Restraining Order, & Request for Disclosure,” alleging\n\nthat Mr. Tarr’s use of his property as a group recovery home violates paragraph 4.1\n\nof the Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions (“deed restrictions”),\n\n                                          5\n\fwhich limits a landowner’s permissible use to single family residential use. CR5-\n\n50. On that same day, in an ex parte hearing, the trial court (Judge Amy Clark\n\nMeachum) granted the HOA’s temporary restraining order.\n\n      On August 27, 2012, Mr. Tarr filed his Answer and Counterclaims. Mr. Tarr\n\nargued that the use of a residential house as a group home for those recovering from\n\nsubstance abuse is protected under certain federal and state laws because its residents\n\nwere “handicapped” or “disabled” within the meaning of those laws. Mr. Tarr also\n\nbrought counterclaims against the HOA for discrimination under some of those laws.\n\n      Rather than address the issues head on, the HOA filed three separate motions\n\nfor partial summary judgment, CR168, 298, and 499, each of which was heard and\n\ndecided by a different judge on the Travis County rotating docket. CR296-97, 496-\n\n98, and 617. These partial summary judgments are incorporated in the Final\n\nModified Judgment. CR621-24.\n\nThe HOA’s First Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n\n      On August 26, 2013, the HOA moved for partial summary judgment on both\n\ntraditional and no-evidence grounds on Mr. Tarr’s affirmative defense that federal\n\nand state laws against discrimination against handicapped or disabled individuals\n\nprohibited excluding the Westlake Recovery House residents. CR168-75. The\n\nHOA’s traditional motion argued that Mr. Tarr does not have standing to assert these\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fdefenses and that the federal and state discrimination laws do not apply as a matter\n\nof law. The trial court denied the HOA’s traditional motion. CR296.\n\n       But the trial court granted the HOA’s no-evidence motion. CR297. In that\n\nmotion, the HOA asserted that Mr. Tarr has no evidence to support his affirmative\n\ndefenses under federal and state law. CR172-75. Specifically, the HOA asserted\n\nthat there was no evidence that the residents of Westlake Recovery House meet the\n\nstatutory definitions of handicap and disability under the various statutes. CR173-\n\n74.\n\n       In response, Mr. Tarr submitted an affidavit in which he testified that he is\n\noperating a recovery group home and that to be admitted to Westlake Recovery\n\nHouse, all prospective residents are required to have a “handicap” as defined by the\n\nFederal Fair Housing Act (or “disability as defined by the Texas Fair Housing Act)1\n\nby reason of a drug or alcohol addiction for which they are seeking recovery.\n\nCR294-95. Moreover, he testified that the residents must undergo substance testing\n\nto ensure that they are not currently using drugs or alcohol. Id. The residents are\n\nalso required to participate in in-house and outside recovery meetings as part of their\n\nrecovery. Id. Mr. Tarr also testified that Westlake Recovery House provides “a live-\n\n\n\n1\n  The definition of “disability” in the Texas FHA is identical to the definition of “handicap” in the\nFederal FHA, and the protections offered are the same as provided by the federal FHA. TEX. PROP.\nCODE §§ 301.002(3), 301.003(6) , 301.025. Throughout this brief, discussion of the Federal FHA\nrefers to both the federal and Texas FHA.\n\n                                                 7\n\fin manager, assigned accountability partners, transportation assistance to outside\n\nrecovery meetings, and other services consistent with the property’s primary purpose\n\nas a drug and alcohol recovery group home.” Id.\n\n      Although the HOA did not reply to Mr. Tarr’s response or respond to this\n\nevidence, on September 30, 2013, the trial court (Judge Stephen Yelenosky) granted\n\nonly the no-evidence portion of the HOA’s first motion and denied the traditional\n\nportion of the motion. CR297; CR621.\n\nThe HOA’s Second Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n\n      On January 1, 2014, the HOA filed a second motion for partial summary\n\njudgment. This motion also had two parts: The first part asserted that Mr. Tarr’s\n\ncounterclaims under federal and state discrimination statutes were barred as a matter\n\nof law because of the trial court’s ruling on the HOA’s first no-evidence motion on\n\nthe affirmative defenses. CR298-304. The HOA offered no other ground for\n\nsummary judgment on Mr. Tarr’s statutory discrimination counterclaims. CR301.\n\n      In the second part of the motion, the HOA, relying entirely on Mr. Tarr’s\n\n“pleadings and testimony,” claimed that it was entitled to summary judgment on its\n\nclaim that Mr. Tarr’s use of the property as a group recovery home breached\n\nparagraph 4.1 of the deed restrictions. CR304-05. The HOA’s “evidence” of breach\n\nis captured in a mere three sentences. First, the HOA notes that Mr. Tarr’s Answer\n\nstates that he is “operating a sober house, group home.” CR304. Next, the HOA\n\n\n                                         8\n\fnotes that Mr. Tarr testified by deposition that was aware of the deed restriction. Id.\n\nLast, the HOA asserts that Mr. Tarr testified in his deposition that “this is a for-profit\n\nendeavor in which he is making at least $6,000 to $8,000 per month.” CR304. In\n\nfact, Mr. Tarr testified that Westlake Recovery House charges residents $600 to $800\n\nper month, meaning that, with ten residents, Westlake Recovery House collects\n\nbetween $6,000 and $8,000 each month. CR415. Of course, this amount represents\n\ngross receipts, not net profits. Id. (“Q. How much money on average do you gross\n\neach month from the recovery house?”). Importantly, the HOA’s motion attached\n\nno evidence indicating that using the property as a group recovery home is not a\n\npermitted residential use within paragraph 4.1’s definition, which incorporates\n\nfederal and state law protections for group homes and provides that the restriction is\n\nviolated only if the residents are not “authorized to so remain by any state or federal\n\nlaw.” CR16, ¶ 4.1.\n\n      Mr. Tarr responded with his own affidavit and those of seven residents of the\n\nrecovery home. SCR19-37. Tarr’s affidavit states that “Westlake Recovery House\n\nis a group home that offers a safe and supportive living environment for men who\n\nare recovering from drug or alcohol addiction.” SCR19. It provides living quarters,\n\nas well as “in-house twelve step meetings, drug testing, accountability partners, and\n\nlife skills coaching to help the men stay off drugs and alcohol.” SCR19-20. Further,\n\nWestlake Recovery House accepts only those that require the special living\n\n                                            9\n\fconditions that the home provides and does not allow any person that is currently\n\nusing drugs or alcohol. SCR20.\n\n      In response to the HOA’s mischaracterization of his testimony about Westlake\n\nRecovery House’s finances, Mr. Tarr testified that “Westlake Recovery House\n\ncharges its residents for their living accommodations and other services. It has to do\n\nso in order to provide these services. Its costs of operation are approximately $7,200\n\nper month. At this time I do not take a salary or other compensation for operating\n\nthe House, and although we have been a sober house for 18 months, the company\n\nhas not yet broken even. I personally finance this loss.” SCR20.\n\n      Each of the Westlake Recovery House residents testified that they are\n\nrecovering from drug or alcohol addictions and came to Westlake Recovery House\n\nseeking recovery. SCR23-37. Each acknowledged that his addiction is a chronic\n\ncondition and that he needs a group recovery setting to resist the addiction. Id.\n\nFurther, each testified about the substantial limitations his addiction has placed on\n\nhis life. Id. For example, Brad Buhler testified that\n\n             I know from my personal experience that addiction is a\n             chronic condition. With the proper support I can stay\n             away from alcohol but I can never get rid of the craving\n             for it.\n\n             Before I began my recovery, my addiction to alcohol\n             caused me and my family continuing harm. As a result of\n             my addiction, I had two DUI’s, my driver[’]s license was\n             suspended, lost over $500,000 financially, and served\n             fourteen months in prison.\n                                         10\n\f             Living in the Westlake Recovery House is critical to my\n             successful recovery from my addiction. The structured\n             environment, services, and support from the house and\n             other addicts helps me avoid relapsing into the use of\n             alcohol. The members of the group living in the house are\n             like a family, and we support each other. It is also very\n             helpful to me to live in an ordinary residential\n             neighborhood where, I can feel like an ordinary person\n             rather than merely another alcoholic.\n\nSCR23, ¶¶2-5.\n\n      Similarly, Kole Coward testified that for three years immediately before\n\nbeginning his recovery for addiction to marijuana, Xanax, and alcohol, he was\n\n“homeless, lost three jobs, lost all my clothes, and over $5,000.” SCR25, ¶¶2-4.\n\nJackson Hanks testified that, as a result of his former 10-year heroin addiction, he\n\n“lost all of my possessions, cost my family over $1,000,000 in losses, and spent six\n\nmonths in prison with a felony for possessing an illegal drug.” SCR27, ¶¶2-4.\n\nDaniel Kelly likewise testified that, before his recovery began, he abused alcohol for\n\nfour years, leading to the loss of “a successful job, caused two car accidents, was\n\narrested for driving while intoxicated, lost over $50,000 financially, and ended three\n\nrelationships with girlfriends.” SCR32, ¶¶2-4. In all, the seven residents testified\n\nby affidavit, each with his own similar, but unique and personal, story about how\n\nsubstance abuse had severely impacted his life, and how the recovery home has\n\nchanged that. SCR23-37.\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f       On March 24, 2014, the trial court (Judge Eric Shepperd) granted the HOA’s\n\nsecond motion for partial summary judgment as to each of Mr. Tarr’s counterclaims,\n\nas well as the HOA’s affirmative claim that Mr. Tarr breached the deed restrictions.\n\nCR497-98.\n\nThe HOA’s Third Motion for Summary Judgment\n\n       On June 12, 2014, the HOA’s filed its motion for final summary judgment\n\nseeking to permanently enjoin Mr. Tarr from “utilizing his Lot for multifamily use\n\nand/or as an income producing property” and an award of attorney’s fees. CR499-\n\n605. On July 18, 2014, Mr. Tarr responded and moved for reconsideration of the\n\ntwo partial summary judgments. CR606-13.\n\n       On July 30, 2014, the trial court (Judge Gisela D. Triana) granted the HOA’s\n\nmotion only in part, ordering only that Mr. Tarr be “commanded to desist and refrain\n\nfrom breaching the [deed restrictions]” and also awarded attorney’s fees to the\n\nHOA.2\n\nThe Final Judgment\n\n       On September 3, 2014, the trial court (Judge Amy Clark Meachum) entered a\n\nfinal judgment incorporating the three partial summary judgments and awarding the\n\n\n2\n  The trial court (Judge Triana presiding) partially granted the third motion for summary\njudgment—ordering the injunctive relief quoted above—based on the issuance of the first two\npartial summary judgments. CR617. Judge Triana also issued a letter ruling finding that the HOA\nwas entitled to attorney’s fees but finding that a fact issue exited as to the amount of fees to be\nawarded. CR619.\n\n                                                12\n\fHOA $88,000 in attorneys’ fees and $35,000 in appellate attorney’s fees if Mr. Tarr\n\nshould pursue an unsuccessful appeal. SCR70-72. This final judgment contained\n\nan error regarding the date of the first partial summary judgment, which was\n\ncorrected when, on October 28, 2014, the trial court (Judge Rhonda Hurley) entered\n\nits Final Modified Judgment. CR621-24.3\n\n                         SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n       There is no dispute that federal and state statutes protect group homes and\n\nprevent the use of restrictive covenants to prohibit their location in residential\n\nneighborhoods. Nor is there any dispute that the deed restrictions for the Lantana\n\nSouthwest subdivision recognize and incorporate those protections directly into its\n\nresidential use restriction. That is, paragraph 4.1 of the deed restrictions, the very\n\nprovision on which the HOA bases its claim, provides that uses that are protected by\n\nfederal and state law—which includes group homes for the handicapped—may not\n\nbe excluded by the residential use restriction.\n\n       Further, it cannot be reasonably disputed that alcoholics and drug addicts\n\nseeking recovery in a residential group home are handicapped under the statutory\n\ndefinitions. The HOA does not dispute that to be admitted to Westlake Recovery\n\nHouse an applicant must be handicapped. Nor does the HOA dispute the fact that\n\n\n\n3\n Mr. Tarr timely filed a motion for new trial, extending the trial court’s plenary power. SCR73-\n93.\n\n                                              13\n\fWestlake Recovery House provides services for its residents for the purpose of\n\nfacilitating their recovery from addiction. In short, the HOA does not appear to\n\ndispute that Westlake Recovery House is exactly what it purports to be: a group\n\nhome for men handicapped by reason of their addictions to drugs and alcohol and\n\nunable to remain clean or otherwise care for themselves without the care and\n\nassistance of a residential group home.\n\n      Nevertheless, the HOA does not want Westlake Recovery House in its\n\nneighborhood and, without proper notice to Mr. Tarr, sought and obtained an ex\n\nparte temporary restraining order against Mr. Tarr’s operation of his property as a\n\ngroup home. Then, through a series of piecemeal and erroneous partial summary\n\njudgments each heard by a different judge, the trial court compounded the error of\n\nthat TRO by giving the HOA summary judgment on its breach claim and dismissing\n\nMr. Tarr’s affirmative defenses and discrimination counterclaims.\n\n      First, the HOA failed to carry its summary judgment burden to prove\n\nconclusively that Mr. Tarr’s group home was not a permitted use under paragraph\n\n4.1. Indeed, the HOA did not even purport to contest that Westlake Recovery House\n\nis a protected group home. Nevertheless, the trial court ruled that the HOA had\n\nconclusively proved its breach claim.\n\n      Moreover, even if the deed restrictions had not incorporated the statutory\n\nprotections into the residential use restriction, the statutes would nevertheless\n\n                                          14\n\fprohibit discriminatory enforcement of such a deed restriction. Further, the federal\n\nand Texas FHAs provide causes of action for those aggrieved by discriminatory\n\nconduct in violation of the FHA. But the trial court erroneously ruled that there was\n\nnot even a scintilla of evidence that the residents of Westlake Recovery House are\n\nhandicapped despite testimony regarding the House’s admissions policy and\n\nservices for handicapped men seeking recovery for substance addictions. Moreover,\n\nthe trial court ignored the testimony of the residents themselves regarding their\n\nimpairment due to their addictions, the ways in which their addictions prevent them\n\nfrom caring for themselves, and the risk of relapse without the services provided by\n\nWestlake Recovery House.\n\n      This evidence is much more than a scintilla of evidence that the current and\n\nfuture residents of Westlake Recovery House are handicapped under the statutory\n\ndefinitions. Indeed, as the HOA’s pleadings and the evidence make clear, it is the\n\nresidents’ handicaps that motivated the HOA’s actions to remove them from the\n\nneighborhood.\n\n      Finally, the trial court awarded the HOA $88,000 in attorney’s fees (and\n\n$35,000 in appellate attorney’s fees). But this attorney’s fees award cannot stand.\n\nFirst, it is based on the erroneous summary judgment rulings. But, in addition, the\n\naward must be reversed because the HOA is not a “prevailing party” because the\n\ninjunction it obtained is void and unenforceable. Contrary to the rules, the injunction\n\n                                          15\n\f(1) does not specifically identify the behavior that Mr. Tarr must refrain from and\n\n(2) refers to an extraneous document, the deed covenants, to define its scope. Rather,\n\nit merely provides that Mr. Tarr must refrain from breaching the deed restrictions.\n\nThus, because the HOA did not procure a judgment that materially altered the legal\n\npositions of the parties, it is not a prevailing party and may not be awarded attorney’s\n\nfees.\n\n        For all of the reasons discussed below, this Court should reverse the trial\n\ncourt’s erroneous summary judgment and remand for trial.\n\n                                    ARGUMENT\n\n        The disjointed and piecemeal manner in which the issues were presented to\n\nfive different judges of the Travis County trial bench confused the issues in the trial\n\ncourt and complicates the presentation of the issues on appeal. Rather than address\n\nthe various partial summary judgments separately, Part I below addresses the HOA’s\n\nclaims that Mr. Tarr violated the deed restrictions (second partial summary\n\njudgment) and Mr. Tarr’s affirmative defenses (second partial summary judgment);\n\nPart II addresses the trial court’s erroneous dismissal of his counterclaims (second\n\npartial summary judgment). Part III addresses the trial court’s erroneous award of\n\nattorney’s fees and the invalidity of the injunction (third partial summary judgment\n\nand final modified judgment).\n\n\n\n\n                                          16\n\fI.     The trial court erred in granting summary judgment for the HOA on its\n       claim that Westlake Recovery House breaches the deed restrictions.\n\n       Courts have long and routinely held that group homes in residential homes are\n\nprotected by federal and state law. “Since the FHA Amendments took effect, courts\n\nhave made clear that single family deed restrictions cannot be used to exclude group\n\nhomes for disabled persons from single family neighborhoods.” United States v.\n\nWagner, 940 F. Supp. 972, 979 (N.D. Tex. 1996) (citing Martin v. Constance, 843\n\nF. Supp. 1321, 1326 (E.D. Mo. 1994).4 In Deep East Texas, the court explained:\n\n              It is now well established that the Fair Housing Act\n              prohibits the enforcement of restrictive covenants that\n              discriminate or have the effect of discriminating on the\n              basis of handicap. The Fair Housing Act has been\n              declared to prohibit special restrictions, special restrictive\n              covenants, or other terms or conditions or denials of\n              service because of an individual’s handicap and which\n              exclude congregate living arrangements for persons with\n              handicaps.\n\n877 S.W.2d 550, 558 (Tex. App.—Beaumont 1994, no writ).\n\n       Lantana moved for summary judgment on its claim that Mr. Tarr’s use of his\n\nproperty as a group home is a violation of paragraph 4.1. CR304. Because the HOA\n\nhas the burden of proof on its breach claim, it must conclusively prove all of the\n\n\n\n4\n  See also United States v. Scott, 788 F. Supp. 1555, 1562 (D.

Palmetto Pathway Homes, Inc., 303 S.C.\n308, 400 S.E.2d 484 (1991)).\n\n                                              17\n\felements of its cause of action as a matter of law. TEX. R. CIV.

To establish a violation,\n\nthe HOA must show that the deed restriction is applicable and valid with respect to\n\nMr. Tarr’s use of the home and that that use is not a permissible “residential use.”\n\nAs discussed in Part A below, the HOA failed to carry this burden. Paragraph 4.1\n\nexpressly provides that the residential use restriction does not exclude uses, such as\n\ngroup homes, that are protected by federal and state law. As courts throughout the\n\nnation routinely hold, use of a property as a group home constitutes residential use.\n\nMoreover, the HOA’s factual assertions that the group home is an impermissible\n\n“for profit” duplex are unfounded and, in any case, immaterial.\n\n      The HOA will undoubtedly argue that the trial court’s first partial summary\n\njudgment bars any argument that federal and state law protects group homes like Mr.\n\nTarr’s. But, as discussed in Part A, paragraph 4.1 expressly incorporates these\n\nstatutory protections into the deed restriction itself; protected uses, like group homes,\n\nare deemed to be permitted residential uses and, thus the HOA bore the summary\n\njudgment burden of conclusively proving that the WRH was not protected by federal\n\nand state law. Further, as discussed in Part B, even if these protections were not\n\nincorporated into the deed restriction itself, the federal and state protections would\n\nnevertheless prohibit enforcement against Mr. Tarr’s group home, and Mr. Tarr’s\n\n                                           18\n\fevidence creates a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether the residents\n\nof Westlake Recovery House are handicapped.\n\n      A.     The HOA did not meet its burden of conclusively proving that the\n             Westlake Recovery House residents were not authorized to remain\n             “by any state or federal law” and, thus that Mr. Tarr’s group home\n             violated the deed restriction.\n\n      The HOA claims that Mr. Tarr has breached paragraph 4.1 of the deed\n\nrestrictions “by turning his home, a single family residence, into a for-profit duplex.”\n\nCR304. Paragraph 4.1 provides:\n\n             Residential Use. All Lots shall be improved and used\n             solely for single family residential use, inclusive of a\n             garage, fencing and other such Improvements as are\n             necessary or customarily incident to residential use. No\n             building, outbuilding or portion of either may be built on\n             a Lot for use as income-producing property (i.e., for lease\n             to tenants who do not occupy an entire Lot). A “single\n             family” shall be defined as any number of persons related\n             by blood, marriage or adoption, and shall also include\n             foster children and domestic servants. This Declaration\n             shall not, however, exclude from a Lot any person who is\n             authorized to so remain by any state or federal law.\nCR16, ¶4.1 (emphasis added). As the party seeking to enforce the deed restriction,\n\nthe HOA has the burden of proving conclusively that the deed restriction is valid and\n\nenforceable against Mr. Tarr and that his use of the property as a group home\n\nbreached the deed restriction.

(mem.\n\nop.). Thus, the HOA’s summary judgment burden was to establish conclusively that\n\nMr. Tarr’s use of the property as a group home for recovering alcoholics and drug\n\naddicts is not a permitted “residential use” within the meaning of paragraph 4.1.\n\n      Yet not only does the evidence the HOA asserts supports this claim fail to\n\nconclusively establish a breach of the deed restriction, it is not sufficient to establish\n\neven a prima facie case for breach. The HOA points to Mr. Tarr’s Answer, which\n\nstates that he is “operating a sober house, group home.” CR 304. It also points to\n\nTarr’s deposition testimony that he receives $6,000 to $8,000 a month from the\n\ngroup home residents. The HOA asserts that this is conclusive evidence that the\n\ngroup home is “a for-profit endeavor.” CR304. The HOA’s motion does not point\n\nto any additional evidence to support its breach claim. CR304-05.\n\n      As discussed below, this evidence is woefully insufficient to carry the HOA’s\n\nsummary judgment burden. First, the restriction does not and cannot prohibit group\n\nhomes like Mr. Tarr’s (Part 1). Moreover, the HOA’s assertions that the group home\n\nis a “for profit duplex” (Part 2) are unsupported by the evidence and, in any case,\n\n                                           20\n\fimmaterial to the question of whether Mr. Tarr’s use of the home as a group home\n\nis a permissible use under paragraph 4.1.\n\n            1.     The HOA failed to meet its burden—the Texas and Federal\n                   Fair Housing Acts and supporting case law protect group\n                   homes such as Mr. Tarr’s.\n\n      Courts universally recognize that residential use restrictions are not valid or\n\nenforceable against and do not prohibit group homes for recovering alcoholics and\n\ndrug addicts like Mr. Tarr’s.

Supp. at 979 (“Since the FHA Amendments took effect, courts\n\nhave made clear that single family deed restrictions cannot be used to exclude group\n\nhomes for disabled persons from single family neighborhoods.”); Martin, 843 F.\n\nSupp. at 1326; Scott, 788 F.

Indeed, the HOA recognized this fact when it expressly stated that its\n\nown residential use restriction does not exclude any person protected by federal or\n\nstate law, which includes group home residents under the FHA.\n\n      The paragraph 4.1 use limitation expressly provides that it cannot be used or\n\ninterpreted to exclude uses protected by state and federal law. The covenant\n\n\n                                        21\n\fprovides that the residential use restriction “shall not, however, exclude” any person\n\nwhose presence is protected by federal and state law. CR16, ¶ 4.1. Thus, to establish\n\nthe deed restriction’s validity, enforceability, and breach against Mr. Tarr, the HOA\n\nmust demonstrate that—considering the exemption for group homes included in\n\nparagraph 4.1—Mr. Tarr’s use of the home is not a permitted “residential use.”\n\n      Indeed, even in cases where, unlike here, the covenant does not include\n\nexpress language including uses protected by federal and state law within the\n\nmeaning of “residential use,” courts nevertheless hold that group homes fall within\n\nthe meaning of single-family residential use. See Permian Basin Centers for Mental\n\nHealth & Mental Retardation v. Alsobrook, 723 S.W.2d 774, 777 (Tex. App.—El\n\nPaso 1986, writ ref’d n.r.e.) (holding that proposed group home for mentally retarded\n\nadults did not violate single family residential use). Numerous decisions from other\n\nstate and federal courts have similarly concluded that persons living together in\n\nresidential group homes constitute a “single family” and that the operation of such\n\nhomes constitutes a permissible “residential use” of property. See, e.g., City of\n\nLivonia v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 423 Mich. 466, 528, 378 N.W.2d 402, 431 (1985);\n\nConcord Estates Homeowners Ass’n, Inc v.

State, 71 N.J. 206, 364 A.2d 993 (1976).\n\n      The case here is even easier because the statutory protections were made part\n\nof the of “residential use” deed restriction. Paragraph 4.1 expressly provides that it\n\ndoes not exclude any person whose presence is protected by federal and state law,\n\nwhich includes the residents of Westlake Recovery House. CR16, ¶4.1. As such,\n\nthe HOA cannot prove that Mr. Tarr has breached the deed restriction unless it can\n\nshow (or on summary judgment, conclusively show) that the persons living in the\n\nhouse fall outside of the limitations of paragraph 4.1.\n\n      But the HOA has manifestly failed (or even attempted) to establish that Mr.\n\nTarr’s use of the property does not qualify as a group home for handicapped persons.\n\nIn fact, the only evidence the HOA proffered to show breach was Mr. Tarr’s own\n\nrepresentations and testimony that he is operating a “sober house, group home” for\n\nrecovering addicts. CR304. Far from demonstrating breach, this shows that Mr.\n\n                                          23\n\fTarr’s use falls squarely within a permissible “residential use” under paragraph 4.1.\n\nThe HOA offered no evidence, much less conclusive evidence that Mr. Tarr’s use\n\nfalls outside this limited definition. Indeed, all of the evidence before the trial court\n\nshows that the residents of Westlake Recovery House are handicapped and protected\n\nby the federal and state FHAs. See Part B, below. Mr. Tarr testified that to be\n\nadmitted to Westlake Recovery House, residents must have a “handicap” as defined\n\nby the FHA by reason of a drug or alcohol addiction for which they are seeking\n\nrecovery. CR294-95. Further, each resident testified that he is a recovering\n\nalcoholic and/or drug addict and that his addiction to alcohol or drugs caused severe\n\nharm and impaired his ability to function normally. SCR23-37. And each testified\n\nthat without proper support, they would relapse. Id. Mr. Tarr’s use of his property\n\nas a group recovery home for handicapped men is clearly within paragraph 4.1’s use\n\nrestriction. At the very least, there is a fact question, precluding summary judgment.\n\n             2.     The HOA’s assertion that Mr. Tarr’s group home is a “for\n                    profit duplex” is immaterial to residential use under\n                    paragraph 4.1.\n\n      As noted above, the HOA’s only contention regarding breach is that Mr.\n\nTarr’s use of the home as a group home violates paragraph 4.1’s residential use\n\nrestriction because it is a “for profit endeavor.” CR304-05. According to the HOA,\n\nMr. Tarr testified “that this is a for-profit endeavor in which he is making at least\n\n$6,000 to $8,000 per month.” CR304. First, this is a misrepresentation of Mr. Tarr’s\n\n\n                                           24\n\factual testimony. Rather, Mr. Tarr testified that on average Westlake Recovery\n\nHouse charges residents $600 to $800 per month, meaning that, with ten residents,\n\nWestlake Recovery House gross collections are between $6,000 and $8,000 each\n\nmonth. CR415. Mr. Tarr testified that the costs of operating Westlake Recovery\n\nHouse are approximately $7,200 per month and that Westlake Recovery House has\n\nnot yet broken even. SCR20.\n\n       More importantly, however, the HOA’s assertion that Mr. Tarr’s\n\nacknowledgement that he receives compensation for operating the group home is\n\nimmaterial to the HOA’s breach claim. To begin with, the term “for profit” does not\n\nappear anywhere in this restriction. And although the second sentence refers to\n\n“income producing property,” this reference prohibits construction of a building (or\n\nportion thereof) on the lot for the purpose of producing income, for example,\n\nbuilding a guest house for rent.5 It does not by its terms prohibit use of the property\n\nto generate income (or even “profit”). Indeed, paragraph 4.2 provides that the\n\nproperty may be used for business or trade under certain conditions (none of which\n\n\n\n\n5\n  Indeed, this portion of paragraph 4.1 addresses the construction of a structure on the lot for the\npurpose of producing income. “No building, outbuilding or portion of either may be built on a Lot\nfor use as income producing property (i.e., for lease to tenants who do not occupy an entire Lot).”\nCR16, ¶4.1. As in Deep East Texas and Permian Basin, this portion of the restriction addresses\nthe architectural structure, not permitted uses; it is intended to prevent the construction of a duplex,\napartment building, or other multi-family structure. Deep East Texas, 877 S.W.2d at 558; Permian\nBasin, 723 S.W.2d at 777.\n\n                                                  25\n\fare alleged to have been violated here). Presumably the HOA does not contend that\n\npermitted businesses under paragraph 4.2 must operate without income or pro bono.\n\n      Moreover, courts routinely hold that the fact that a group home operator\n\nreceives money from the residents does not make the use non-residential. As these\n\ncourts explain:\n\n             the incident necessities of operating a group home such as\n             maintaining records, filing accounting reports, managing,\n             supervising, and providing care for individuals in\n             exchange for monetary compensation are collateral to the\n             prime purpose and function of a family housekeeping unit.\n             Hence, these activities do not, in and of themselves,\n             change the character of a residence from private to\n             commercial.\n\nRhodes, 400 S.E.2d at 485-86; Jackson v. Williams, 714 P.2d 1017, 1022 (Okla.\n\n1985) (“The essential purpose of the group home is to create a normal family\n\natmosphere dissimilar from that found in traditional institutional care for the\n\nmentally handicapped. The operation of a group home is thus distinguishable from\n\na use that is commercial—i.e., a boarding house that provides food and lodging\n\nonly—or is institutional in character.”); see also Hill, 911 P.2d at 866-67 (“The\n\nCommunity’s activities in providing the group home for the residents do not render\n\nthe home a nonresidential operation such as a hospice or boarding house.”); Gregory\n\nv. State Dep’t of Mental Health, Retardation & Hosps., 495 A.2d 997, 1001-02 (R.I.\n\n1985) (finding the group home to be residential and not commercial in nature, and\n\nlisting cases from other jurisdictions reaching the same conclusion); Blevins v.\n                                        26\n\fBarry–Lawrence County Ass’n for Retarded Citizens, 707 S.W.2d 407, 408-09 (Mo.\n\n1986) (en banc) (same, listing jurisdictions); City of Livonia, 378 N.W.2d at 431\n\n(holding that the fact that residents may be required to pay for services does not\n\n“transform the nature of the activities conducted in the home from residential to\n\ncommercial.”). Indeed, the FHA “does not require group home providers to give\n\naway their services, to operate at a loss, nor to declare a particular tax status. If it\n\ndid, there would be far fewer residences for disabled persons than there presently\n\nare.” United States v. City of Chicago Heights, 161 F. Supp. 2d 819, 844 (N.D. Ill.\n\n2001).\n\n      Even if the deed restrictions prohibited the use of a residence as “income\n\nproducing property” (and it does not), it would violate the anti-discrimination\n\nprovisions of the Fair Housing Act because it has the effect of excluding congregate\n\nliving arrangements for persons with handicaps. In Martin v. Constance, the court\n\nconfronted a deed restriction that forbade use of the property “for trade or business\n\nof any kind.” 843 F. Supp. 1321, 1323 (E.D. Mo. 1994). Referring to earlier cases\n\nand the legislative history of the Fair Housing Act, the court found that the plaintiffs\n\nestablished a violation of the Act’s anti-discrimination provisions because the\n\nprohibition effectively forbade the operation of group homes. Id. at 1325; see also\n\nAdvocacy Ctr. for Persons with Disabilities, Inc. v. Woodlands Estates Ass’n, Inc.,\n\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\f192 F. Supp. 2d 1344, 1350 (M.D. Fla. 2002); Dornbach v. Holley, 854 So. 2d 211,\n\n212 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2002).\n\n      Similarly, the HOA’s assertions that the house is an impermissible “duplex”\n\nare unfounded and immaterial.       There is no evidence—much less conclusive\n\nevidence—that the house in question fails to satisfy the architectural requirements\n\nof a “single family” residence. First, contrary to the HOA’s assertions, CR304, Mr.\n\nTarr has not testified that the home is structurally a duplex or that it has ever been\n\nleased and occupied as a duplex. Second, there has been no pleading, evidence, or\n\neven suggestion that the exterior of the home does not comport with the standards\n\nof a single-family residential neighborhood. The photographs of the home do not\n\nreveal anything but a single-family residence. CR370-76. Nor is there conclusive\n\nevidence that the residence has separate entrances or separate apartments. The HOA\n\nhas not submitted any inspection report, evidence of exterior or interior alterations\n\nmade to the home, or any other evidence that the structure of the home has been\n\naltered such that it is no longer a single-family style residence within the meaning\n\nof paragraph 4.1.\n\n      The only mention of “duplex” in the record evidence is in an Internet\n\nadvertisement that offers to lease the home and refers to the accommodations as a\n\nduplex or townhouse. CR372-74. But this is not evidence (and certainly not\n\nconclusive evidence) that the house is actually, structurally a duplex that would\n\n                                         28\n\fviolate the building and architectural restrictions of paragraph 4.1. But even if this\n\nadvertisement could be considered some evidence that the home actually is a duplex,\n\nit certainly is not conclusive. Other advertisements (also appended to the HOA’s\n\napplication)—specifically those for Westlake Recovery Home, the use the home is\n\nnow put to—do not characterize the accommodations as a “duplex.” CR368-71,\n\n376. Rather, these advertisements characterize the home as a single household unit\n\nand describe the management of the home as a group home to facilitate recovery\n\nfrom debilitating alcohol and drug additions. Id. One of the defining characteristics\n\nof a group home is that it provides a communal, family-like household. See, e.g.,\n\nRhodes, 400 S.E.2d at 485-86; Jackson, 714 P.2d at 1022. Thus, at the very least,\n\nthere is a fact issue with respect to the physical structure of the home.\n\n      Indeed, the HOA motion makes clear that the problem it has with Mr. Tarr’s\n\nuse of the home is not its physical structure, but rather, that recovering alcoholics\n\nand drug addicts live there. The HOA’s duplex assertion is that the home is leased\n\nto and occupied by unrelated and separate household units. But here too, there is no\n\nevidence that this is the case. That is, there is no evidence that the house is occupied\n\nas a duplex with independent household units. Indeed, all of the record evidence\n\nsupports the opposite conclusion that it is a group home occupied and operated as a\n\nsingle household unit. Courts routinely hold that a group home is a single household\n\nunit and falls within “single family” residential restrictions. See Hill, 911 P.2d at\n\n                                          29\n\f869 (noting that courts “have consistently held that restrictive covenants mandating\n\nsingle-family residences do not bar group homes in which the occupants live as a\n\nfamily unit”); Rhodes, 400 S.E.2d at 485-86 (explaining that the “prime purpose and\n\nfunction” of group home is “a family housekeeping unit”); Jackson, 714 P.2d at 1022\n\n(“The essential purpose of the group home is to create a normal family atmosphere\n\ndissimilar from that found in traditional institutional care for the mentally\n\nhandicapped. The operation of a group home is thus distinguishable from a use that\n\nis commercial—i.e., a boarding house that provides food and lodging only—or is\n\ninstitutional in character.”); City of Livonia, 378 N.W.2d at 431 (“Numerous\n\ndecisions from other states have similarly concluded that persons living together in\n\nresidential group homes constitute a ‘single family’ or that the operation of such\n\nhomes constitutes a residential use of property.”); see also Maull v. Community\n\nLiving for the Handicapped, Inc., 813 S.W.2d 90, 92 (Mo.Ct.App.1991) (“[G]roup\n\nhomes where the residents function in a family setting, interdependent on one\n\nanother in carrying out the daily operation and routine of the residence meet the\n\nsingle family requirement of the covenant.”), transfer denied, (Aug. 8, 1991); State\n\nex rel. Region II Child & Family Servs., Inc. v. District Court, 187 Mont. 126, 609\n\nP.2d 245, 248 (1980) (holding group home constituted family as required by\n\ncovenant).\n\n\n\n\n                                        30\n\f      As discussed above, paragraph 4.1 makes clear that uses, such as group\n\nhomes, that are protected by federal and state law are not excluded by the use\n\nrestriction. The interior structure of the house is irrelevant to the protections\n\nprovided by federal law and as incorporated into paragraph 4.1 itself. Simply\n\nlabeling it as a “duplex” is not evidence that the group home is not a residential use\n\nwithin the meaning of paragraph 4.1.\n\n      B.     The trial court erred in granting summary judgment with respect\n             to the affirmative defense that statutory law prohibits enforcement\n             of the deed restriction.\n\n      As discussed above, by stating that statutorily protected uses like group homes\n\nare not excluded from permissible uses under the deed restrictions, the deed\n\nrestrictions assign to the HOA the burden of proving that the accused use of the\n\nproperty is not protected by federal and state law. But even if paragraph 4.1 was\n\nsilent on this point, federal and state law would still prohibit the enforcement of any\n\ndeed restriction that has the effect of excluding group homes like Mr. Tarr’s from\n\nresidential neighborhoods. That is, Mr. Tarr has an affirmative defense that federal\n\nand state law prohibits the use of any restrictive covenant to prohibit his use of the\n\nhouse as a group home for handicapped persons.\n\n      The trial court, however, erroneously granted summary judgment against Mr.\n\nTarr, concluding that there was no evidence that the residents of Westlake Recovery\n\nHouse are handicapped or disabled under the statutes.          Importantly, the only\n\n\n                                          31\n\fargument the HOA made in the trial court that the federal and state law protections\n\nfor group homes did not apply to Mr. Tarr’s group home is that there was no evidence\n\nthat the residents were handicapped under the FHA. CR304. Other than merely\n\nasserting there is no evidence that the residents of Westlake Recovery House are\n\nhandicapped, the HOA did not explain why Mr. Tarr’s affidavit is not some evidence\n\nof handicap. Indeed, the HOA did not reply to Mr. Tarr’s response or raise any\n\nobjection to Mr. Tarr’s affidavit in which he testified that each of the residents meets\n\nthe statutory definitions of “handicap” and “disability.” CR294-95.\n\n       The Fair Housing Act defines “handicap” as:\n\n               (1) a physical or mental impairment which substantially\n               limits one or more of such person’s major life activities,\n               (2) a record of having such impairment, or (3) being\n               regarded as having such an impairment.6\n\n42 U.S.C. § 3602(h). Similarly, the Texas Fair Housing Act defines “Disability” as\n\n“a mental or physical impairment that substantially limits at least one major life\n\nactivity, a record of the impairment, or being regarded as having the impairment.”\n\nTEX. PROP. CODE § 301.003(6).7\n\n\n\n\n6\n The FHA also provides that “handicap” does not include those who are currently and illegally\nusing a controlled substance. 42 U.S.C. § 3602(h). Residents of Westlake Recovery House must\nundergo substance testing to ensure that they are not currently using drugs or alcohol. CR294-95.\n7\n  The American with Disabilities Act defines “disabled” in the same way. 42 U.S.C. § 12102 (“In\norder to establish disabled status under the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) a physical or\nmental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such\nindividual; (2) a record of such an impairment; or (3) being regarded as having such impairment.”).\n\n                                                32\n\f      Alcoholism and drug addiction are “impairments” as a matter of law. See,\n\ne.g., Oxford House, Inc. v. City of Baton Rouge, La., 932 F. Supp. 2d 683, 688-89\n\n(M.D. La. 2013); 24 C.F.R. § 100.201(a)(2) (providing that impairment includes\n\ndrug addiction and alcoholism). Indeed, the definition of handicap in the Fair\n\nHousing Act was taken directly from section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which\n\nhas consistently been interpreted by the courts to cover alcoholics and drug addicts.\n\nOxford House, Inc. v. Twp. of Cherry Hill, 799 F. Supp. 450, 459 (D.N.J. 1992). The\n\nHouse Report accompanying the Fair Housing Act stated, “[t]he Committee intends\n\nthat the definition be interpreted consistent with regulations clarifying the meaning\n\nof the similar provision found in section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.” H.R. Rep.\n\nNo. 711, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 22 (1988), reprinted in 1988 U.S. Code Cong. &\n\nAdmin. News 2173, 2183.\n\n      And the HOA does not appear to contest that there is evidence that the\n\nresidents of Westlake Recovery House are impaired recovering alcoholics and drug\n\naddicts. Nor could it; there is clearly sufficient evidence to create a fact issue\n\nregarding whether the residents are impaired. Mr. Tarr testified that they are indeed\n\nrecovering alcoholics and drug addicts. CR294-95. This is some evidence and at\n\nleast creates a genuine issue of fact. Further, the residents themselves testified about\n\ntheir impairments due to alcohol and drug dependence. SCR23-37. Rather, the\n\ncontested issue under the first and second FHA definitions of “handicap” is whether\n\n                                          33\n\fthe residents’ impairments substantially limit them in a major life activity. As\n\ndiscussed below, the summary judgment evidence demonstrates that there is at least\n\na genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Westlake Recovery House\n\nresidents’ impairments substantially limit them in a major life activity, qualifying\n\nthem under the first statutory definition. Further, the evidence demonstrates that\n\nthere is at least a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the HOA and neighbors\n\nregarded the Westlake Recovery House residents as impaired, qualifying the\n\nresidents under the third statutory definition.\n\n       In reviewing the summary judgment evidence, the Court must review the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to Mr. Tarr, disregarding all contrary evidence\n\nand inferences. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc. v. Havner, 953 S.W.2d 706, 711 (Tex.\n\n1997). Summary judgment is improper if the respondent brings forth more than a\n\nscintilla of probative evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact. TEX. R. CIV.\n\nP. 166a(i); see also Havner, 953 S.W.2d at 711. Here, the evidence is much more\n\nthan a scintilla.\n\n              1.    The evidence indicates that the Westlake Recovery House\n                    residents’ impairments limit a major life activity.\n\n       In interpreting the FHA, the United States Supreme Court has held that the\n\nFHA has a “‘broad and inclusive’ compass” and receives a correspondingly\n\n“generous construction.” City of Edmonds v. Oxford House, Inc., 514 U.S. 725, 731,\n\n115 S.Ct. 1776, 131 L.Ed.2d 801 (1995). Indeed, some courts have concluded that\n                                          34\n\falcoholics and drug addicts living in group recovery homes are handicapped within\n\nthe statutory definition as a matter of law. See, e.g., Sullivan v. City of Pittsburgh,\n\n811 F.2d 171, 182 (3d Cir. 1987) (“case law establishes that alcoholics are\n\nhandicapped within the meaning of § 504”); Rodgers v. Lehman, 869 F.2d 253, 258\n\n(4th Cir. 1989) (“Alcoholism is a handicapping condition within the meaning of the\n\nAct.”); Crewe v. U.S. Office of Pers. Mgmt., 834 F.2d 140, 141-42 (8th Cir. 1987)\n\n(“there can be little doubt that alcoholism is a handicap for the purposes of the Act”);\n\nCorp. of Episcopal Church in Utah v. W. Valley City, 119 F. Supp. 2d 1215, 1219\n\n(D. Utah 2000) (“It is well established that individuals recovering from drug or\n\nalcohol addiction are handicapped under the Act.”); Oxford House, Inc. v. Town of\n\nBabylon, 819 F. Supp. 1179, 1182 (E.D.N.Y. 1993); Davis v. Bucher, 451 F. Supp.\n\n791, 796 (E.D. Pa. 1978) (“persons with histories of drug use, including present\n\nparticipants in methadone maintenance programs, are ‘handicapped individuals’\n\nwithin the meaning of the statutory and regulatory language”); Caron Foundation of\n\nFlorida v. City of Delray Beach, 879 F. Supp. 2d 1353, 1364 (S.D. Fla. 2012);\n\nHuman Res. Research & Mgmt. Grp., Inc. v. Cnty. of Suffolk, 687 F. Supp. 2d 237,\n\n251 (E.D.N.Y. 2010). By the very nature of their impairments, addicts are dependent\n\non substances and will relapse in the absence of such care. Reg’l Econ. Cmty. Action\n\nProgram, Inc. v. City of Middletown (“RECAP”), 294 F.3d 35, 47-48 (2d Cir. 2002).\n\nAs the court in Oxford House, Inc. v. Town of Babylon explained, “Recovering\n\n                                          35\n\falcoholics or drug addicts require a group living arrangement in a residential\n\nneighborhood for psychological and emotional support during the recovery process.”\n\n819 F. Supp. at 1183.\n\n      In any case, the record evidence here falls well within what courts hold to be\n\nsufficient to demonstrate that the residents of group homes are handicapped. As the\n\nSecond Circuit held in RECAP, admission to a group recovery home like Westlake\n\nRecovery House is itself some evidence that the resident is handicapped under the\n\nstatute. 294 F.3d at 47-48 (relying on admission criteria to determine that recovering\n\nalcoholics residing in a “halfway house” were statutorily “handicapped” and\n\n“disabled”); see also Wagner v. Fair Acres Geriatric Center, 49 F.3d 1002, 1010\n\n(3d Cir.1995) (observing that “no one would be able to meet a nursing home’s\n\nadmissions requirements in the absence of some handicapping condition\n\nnecessitating nursing home care”); McKivitz v. Twp. of Stowe, 769 F. Supp. 2d 803,\n\n822 (W.D. Pa. 2010); see also Twp. of Cherry Hill, 799 F. Supp. at 459-60 (holding\n\nthat individualized evidence for each resident is not necessary to demonstrate\n\nimpairment of a major life activity). As another federal court explained:\n\n             In the FHA context, the issue of “handicap” is sometimes\n             examined not only by reference to the characteristics of\n             the individuals in question, but also by reference to the\n             criteria for admission to the facility at issue. In other\n             words, an individual can sometimes establish that he or\n             she is “handicapped” within the meaning of the FHA\n             simply by demonstrating that he or she resides in a facility\n             that only admits “handicapped” individuals.\n                                         36\n\fMcKivitz, 769 F. Supp. 2d at 822 (emphasis in original); see also Lakeside Resort\n\nEnterprises, LP v. Board of Supervisors of Palmyra Township, 455 F.3d 154, 156\n\nn.5 (3rd Cir.2006); MX Group, Inc. v. City of Covington, 293 F.3d 326, 338-39 (6th\n\nCir. 2002); United States v. Southern Mgmt. Corp., 955 F.2d 914, 920-23 (4th Cir.\n\n1992). Even where the baseline for admission to a recovery house or program is\n\nsomewhat less than a demonstration of an inability to live independently without\n\nsuffering a relapse, courts still conclude that there is sufficient evidence to establish\n\na genuine issue of material fact. See, e.g., MX Group, 293 F.3d at 338-39 (holding\n\nthat the ADA applied even where admittance to facility was not directly linked to\n\nimpairment); Jeffrey O. v. City of Boca Raton, 511 F. Supp. 2d 1328, 1334-35 (S.D.\n\nFla. 2007) (holding that possibility of relapse was evidence of handicap).\n\n      Further, the description of the kind of support services residents would receive\n\nat a recovery group home, such as random substance testing, participation in\n\nrecovery meetings, on-site managers, accountability partners, and transportation,\n\ndemonstrates that they are limited in major life activities, including “caring for\n\noneself.” See Valley Hous. LP v. City of Derby, 802 F. Supp. 2d 359, 385 (D. Conn.\n\n2011) (finding that description of services for prospective residents with HIV/AIDS\n\ndemonstrated that they were substantially limited); RECAP, 294 F.3d at 47-48\n\n\n\n\n                                           37\n\f(inability to “caring for one’s self” without relapse is necessarily a limitation in a\n\nmajor life activity).8\n\n       Indeed, by seeking treatment for an alcohol or drug-dependency, the resident\n\n“is tacitly, if not expressly, admitting a loss of control over that problem” and, thus,\n\n“the problem rises to the level of handicap deserving of protection under [the Federal\n\nRehabilitation Act].” Burka v. New York City Transit Auth., 680 F. Supp. 590, 600\n\nn.18 (S.D.N.Y. 1988). Their “addiction substantially limit[s] their ability to live\n\nindependently or with their families.” Jeffrey O., 511 F. Supp. 2d at 1335.\n\n       This focus on the nature of the group home and the characteristics of the\n\nresidents accepted to live there makes sense considering that the resident population\n\nis not static. As residents progress in their recovery, they will move out of a group\n\nhome, and new residents will take their places. Thus, a finding with respect to a\n\nparticular individual resident may not be relevant once that resident moves out.\n\nThus, the proper focus should be on the nature of the group home.\n\n       In his first affidavit, Mr. Tarr testified that to be admitted to Westlake\n\nRecovery House, an applicant must qualify as having a “handicap” or “disability”\n\n\n8\n Congress left the definition of “major life activities” to the Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment (HUD), the agency responsible for administering the FHA. 42 U.S.C. § 3608.\nHUD’s parameters for interpreting the Act are extremely broad; caring for oneself, eating, walking,\nbreathing, learning, working, seeing, hearing, and performing manual labor are all “major life\nactivities.” 24 C.F.R. § 100.201 (1995); see also Laurie C. Malkin, Troubles at the Doorstep: The\nFair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and Group Homes for Recovering Substance Abusers, 144\nU. PA. L. REV. 757, 827 (1995).\n\n                                               38\n\funder the applicable statutory definitions. CR294-95, ¶¶5-8. Further, Mr. Tarr\n\ntestified that the residents must submit to random substance testing and participate\n\nin in-house and outside recovery meetings. CR294, ¶3. Mr. Tarr also avowed that\n\nWestlake Recovery House provides “a live-in manager, assigned accountability\n\npartners, transportation assistance to outside recovery meetings, and other services\n\nconsistent with the property’s primary purpose as a drug and alcohol recovery group\n\nhome.” CR294, ¶4.\n\n       As discussed above, this is precisely the sort of evidence that courts routinely\n\nhold to be sufficient evidence of impairment that substantially limits a major life\n\nfunction. Here, as in RECAP, admission to the group recovery home requires that\n\nthe applicant have a statutory handicap. CR294-95, ¶¶3-8; RECAP, 294 F.3d at 47-\n\n48 (2d Cir. 2002).\n\n       This is certainly more than a scintilla of probative evidence that the residents\n\nof Westlake Recovery House are handicapped under the statutory definition and,\n\nthus, is sufficient in itself to avoid summary judgment on this issue. Nevertheless,\n\nthe Court can consider additional evidence proffered in response to the second\n\nmotion for partial summary judgment on the HOA’s breach claim. 9 This evidence\n\n\n9\n  Because the first partial summary judgment was interlocutory, the trial court could have\nreconsidered the summary judgment on the affirmative defenses and considered the later-offered\nevidence, including Mr. Tarr’s second affidavit and the affidavits of the Westlake Recovery House\nresidents. SCR19-37. See Ohrt v. Union Gas Corp., 398 S.W.3d 315, 327-28 (Tex. App.—Corpus\nChristi 2012, pet. denied) (“A partial summary judgment is interlocutory and thus the trial court\nretains the right to reconsider it until it enters a final judgment.”); Fabio v. Ertel, 226 S.W.3d 557,\n                                                 39\n\ffurther supports the fact that the Westlake Recovery House residents are\n\nhandicapped.\n\n       Each resident testified that he is a recovering alcoholic and/or drug addict but\n\nno longer uses alcohol or drugs. SCR23-37. And each testified that without proper\n\nsupport, they would relapse. Id. Moreover, each testified that his addiction to\n\nalcohol or drugs caused severe harm and impaired his ability to function. Id. Brad\n\nBuhler testified that:\n\n               Before I began my recovery, my addiction to alcohol\n               caused me and my family continuing harm. As a result of\n               my addiction, I had two DUI’s, my drivers license [sic]\n               was suspended, lost over $500,000 financially, and served\n               fourteen months in prison.\nSCR23, ¶4. Kole Coward testified similarly to Buhler, noting that, for three years\n\nimmediately before beginning his recovery for addiction to marijuana, Xanax, and\n\nalcohol, he was “homeless, lost three jobs, lost all my clothes, and over $5,000.”\n\nSCR25, ¶4. Jackson Hanks testified that, as a result of his former 10-year heroin\n\naddiction, he “lost all of my possessions, cost my family over $1,000,000 in losses,\n\nand spent six months in prison with a felony for possessing an illegal drug.” SCR27,\n\n\n560-61 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, no pet.); Clark v. Strayhorn, 184 S.W.3d 906, 909\n(Tex. App.—Austin 2006, pet. denied); Loy v. Harter, 128 S.W.3d 397, 409 (Tex. App.—\nTexarkana 2004, pet. denied); see also Fruehauf Corp. v. Carrillo, 848 S.W.2d 83, 84 (Tex. 1993)\n(per curiam) (“The trial court also retains continuing control over interlocutory orders and has the\npower to set those orders aside any time before a final judgment is entered.”). Further, the trial\ncourt’s order granting the HOA’s second motion for partial summary judgment indicates that it\nconsidered Mr. Tarr’s response, which included his second affidavit and the affidavits of the\nresidents of Westlake Recovery House. CR496.\n\n                                                40\n\f¶¶2 & 4. Daniel Kelly likewise testified that, before his recovery began, he abused\n\nalcohol for four years, leading to the loss of “a successful job, caused two car\n\naccidents, was arrested for driving while intoxicated, lost over $50,000 financially,\n\nand ended three relationships with girlfriends.” SCR32, ¶¶2 & 4. In all, seven\n\nresidents testified by affidavit, each with his own similar, but unique and personal,\n\nstory about how substance abuse had severely impacted his life, and how the\n\nrecovery home has changed that.\n\n             Living in the Westlake Recovery House is critical to my\n             successful recovery from my addiction. The structured\n             environment, services, and support from the house and\n             other addicts helps me avoid relapsing into the use of\n             alcohol. The members of the group living in the house are\n             like a family, and we support each other. It is also very\n             helpful to me to live in an ordinary residential\n             neighborhood where, I can feel like an ordinary person\n             rather than merely another alcoholic.\n\nSCR23; SCR25, 27, 29, 32-33, 34, 36-37.\n\n      Courts hold that inability to remain sober without support constitutes a\n\nsubstantial limitation in a major life activity. See, e.g, Jeffrey O., 511 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n1346. Similarly, the loss of work or family relationships constitutes a qualifying\n\nsubstantial limitation. For example, in Oxford House v. City of Baton Rouge, the\n\ncourt found a substantial limitation based on testimony that “alcoholics, drug\n\naddicts, we do not know how to live,” and that living in a residential recovery home\n\nteaches them “to become accountable [and] productive members of society.” 932 F.\n\n\n                                           41\n\fSupp. 2d at 689. In Jeffrey O., the court found that the residents of a group home\n\nfor recovering alcoholics and drug addicts were handicapped because:\n\n               The recovering individuals testified about the negative\n               impact their additions had on their lives, including\n               preventing them from caring for themselves or keeping a\n               home at times, and losing jobs and families.\n\n511 F. Supp. 2d at 1346; see also United States v. Borough of Audubon, N.J., 797 F.\n\nSupp. 353 (D.N.J. 1991) (finding that testimony of the residents demonstrated that\n\ntheir handicap, drug addiction and/or alcoholism, substantially limited major life\n\nactivities).\n\n       Here, the residents of Westlake Recovery House have provided precisely this\n\nkind of testimony to show that alcoholism or drug addiction substantially limits a\n\nmajor life activity. Thus, the evidence creates a genuine issue of material fact on\n\nthis issue. Thus, summary judgment on the HOA’s breach claim was improper and\n\nthe trial court’s judgment should be reversed.\n\n               2.    There is a fact issue with respect to whether the residents\n                     are “regarded as disabled” under the third definition.\n\n       In addition to meeting the first statutory definition of “handicap,” the evidence\n\nalso shows that the residents of Westlake Recovery House were regarded as disabled\n\nby the HOA and the neighbors, satisfying the third definition. Indeed, the fact that\n\nthe residents are recovering alcoholics and drug addicts is the impetus for the HOA’s\n\nsuit to enjoin Mr. Tarr’s use of his property as a group home for such individuals.\n\n\n                                          42\n\fSee, e.g., CR304 (stating that “there is no dispute that Tarr is violating the\n\nDeclarations as his own pleadings in this case state that ‘Tarr is operating a sober\n\nhouse, group home”); SCR20-21 (relating email from HOA president stating that the\n\nreason for legal action against Mr. Tarr was because he was operating a “halfway\n\nhouse”). “It is well documented that community residents often oppose the opening\n\nof drug rehabilitation programs . . . in their neighborhoods because of fears that drug\n\naddicts will bring increased criminal activity or an unsightly and dangerous element\n\nto the neighborhood.” A Helping Hand, L.L.C. v. Baltimore Cnty., MD., No. CIV.A.\n\nCCB-02-2568, 2005 WL 2453062, at *11 (D. Md. Sept. 30, 2005); see also, e.g.,\n\nInnovative Health Sys., Inc. v. City of White Plains, 117 F.3d 37, 49 (2nd Cir. 1997);\n\nBAART v. City of Antioch, 179 F.3d 725, 729 (9th Cir. 1999); MX Group, 293 F.3d\n\nat 329.\n\n      Federal regulations provide that “regarded as having an impairment means”\n\nthe person:\n\n              (1) Has a physical or mental impairment that does not\n              substantially limit one or more major life activities but that\n              is treated by another person as constituting such a\n              limitation;\n\n              (2) Has a physical or mental impairment that substantially\n              limits one or more major life activities only as a result of\n              the attitudes of other toward such impairment; or\n\n              (3) Has none of the impairments defined in paragraph (a)\n              of this definition but is treated by another person as having\n              such an impairment.”\n\n                                           43\n\f24 C.F.R § 100.201(d). As federal courts have explained, under the “regarded as”\n\nprong, rather than trying to determine whether an individual presently suffers from\n\na substantially limiting impairment, “the Court must determine whether Defendants\n\nperceived Plaintiff’s clients as being disabled and discriminated against them on that\n\nbasis.” MX Group, 293 F.3d at 340 (citing Parry v. Mohawk Motors of Michigan,\n\nInc., 236 F.3d 299, 310 (6th Cir. 2001)); A Helping Hand, 2005 WL 2453062, at\n\n*14. Similarly, the Fourth Circuit has explained that a handicap exists where an\n\nimpaired person’s inability to obtain housing was due to the “negative reactions of\n\nothers to the impairment” regardless of the absence of an actual limitation on that\n\nperson’s mental or physical capabilities. Southern Mgmt. Corp., 955 F.2d at 918\n\n(“The clients are clearly impaired, and their ability to obtain housing (a major life\n\nactivity) was limited by the attitudes of the SMC officials. Thus, we conclude that\n\nthe clients qualify as having a handicap under the general definition at 42 U.S.C. §\n\n3602(h)(1)-(3).” (citing School Bd. of Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 283,\n\n107 S. Ct. 1123, 1128, 94 L. Ed. 2d 307 (1987))). Because the plaintiffs had been\n\ndenied housing on the basis of their status as drug addicts and alcoholics, the court\n\nreasoned that their inability to obtain housing (a major life activity) due to the\n\nattitudes of others qualified them as handicapped under the third prong of the\n\ndefinition (“being regarded as having such an impairment”). Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                         44\n\f      The record contains ample evidence that the HOA and neighborhood home\n\nowners regarded the group home residents as disabled and discriminated against\n\nthem on that basis. The materials attached to the HOA’s motion demonstrate that\n\nthe HOA knew that the residents are recovering addicts, and therefore knew they are\n\nhandicapped. CR366-77. In fact, the evidence shows that the HOA’s actions in\n\nbringing this lawsuit were intended to discriminate against the recovering addicts at\n\nthe Recovery House. SCR20-21. Prior to filing suit, the HOA president, Steve\n\nPortnoy, sent an email to a Lantana homeowner and representatives of the HOA’s\n\nmanagement company stating that\n\n             This has now escalated past the point of what is even\n             remotely acceptable for our neighborhood. A halfway\n             house? This has to be shut down and quickly. Can you\n             please have the HOA attorney contact me about pursuing\n             a more aggressive alternative course of action?\n\nSCR20-21. Here the HOA president clearly demonstrates that the reason the HOA\n\ndoes not want Westlake Recovery House residents living in the neighborhood is\n\nprecisely because the home is a group home for recovering alcoholics and drug\n\naddicts. This is more than a scintilla of probative evidence that the HOA regarded\n\nand discriminated against the residents and, consequently, evidence that the residents\n\nsatisfy the third statutory definition of “handicapped.”\n\n                             *     *      *      *     *\n\n\n\n\n                                         45\n\f      In summary, this Court should hold that the plaintiff HOA failed to\n\ndemonstrate conclusively that Mr. Tarr’s use of the property as a group home for\n\nrecovering alcoholics and drug addicts is not a permitted “residential use” as defined\n\nin the deed restriction, which incorporates statutory prohibitions against interpreting\n\nrestrictive covenants to exclude group homes. As the party asserting that Mr. Tarr\n\nbreached paragraph 4.1, it was the HOA’s burden. Because it failed to conclusively\n\nprove that Mr. Tarr’s use was not a permissible use, the HOA was not entitled to\n\nsummary judgment, and the trial court’s judgment should be reversed and remanded.\n\n      Even if the deed restriction did not incorporate the statutory protections and it\n\nwas Mr. Tarr’s burden to demonstrate that his group home was a permissible and\n\nprotected group home, Mr. Tarr carried this burden by proffering more than a\n\nscintilla of evidence that the residents of Westlake Recovery House meet one or\n\nmore of the statutory definitions of handicap. Thus, the HOA was not entitled to\n\nsummary judgment, and the trial court’s judgment should be reversed and remanded.\n\n      C.     The HOA failed to give Mr. Tarr proper notice of the alleged\n             violations of the deed restrictions.\n\n      Section 12.8 of the deed restrictions requires that the HOA give ten-days’\n\nnotice of an alleged violation of the deed restrictions before taking any action to\n\nenforce the restriction. CR34, ¶12.8. It is undisputed that the HOA failed to give\n\nMr. Tarr proper notice. In response to Mr. Tarr’s summary judgment response on\n\nthis point, the HOA produced a letter proving this point. The letter from the HOA’s\n                                          46\n\fattorney to Mr. Tarr was sent on August 10, 2012. CR474. Yet just four days later,\n\non August 14, 2012, the HOA filed suit and obtained a temporary restraining order\n\nat an ex parte hearing. CR4-50. Texas law is clear; the HOA’s failure to give Mr.\n\nTarr proper notice of the alleged violation prior to bringing suit is fatal to the HOA’s\n\nclaim. See Ashcreek Homeowner’s Ass’n, Inc. v. Smith, 902 S.W.2d 586, 589-90\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1995, no writ).\n\nII.   The trial court erroneously granted summary judgment on Mr. Tarr’s\n      counterclaims based entirely on its erroneous summary judgment on\n      the affirmative defenses.\n\n      Even though Mr. Tarr’s counterclaims were not at issue in the HOA’s first\n\nmotion for partial summary judgment, the HOA nevertheless argued that the first\n\nsummary judgment on the affirmative defenses should preclude Mr. Tarr’s\n\ncounterclaims. The HOA did not offer any other ground for dismissing Mr. Tarr’s\n\ncounterclaims. This is the entirety of the HOA’s argument on Mr. Tarr’s statutory\n\nclaims:\n\n             Tarr asserts causes of action of the Federal and Texas Fair\n             Housing Act[s], the Texas Housing Act, the Americans\n             with Disabilities Act, and the Federal Rehabilitation Act.\n             Because the Court has already ruled as a matter of law that\n             Tarr is not entitled to said protections and/or said\n             protections are inapplicable, there is no fact issue that\n             exists and, as such, said causes of action (which are\n             nothing more than a repeat of the affirmative defenses\n             should be dismissed as a matter of law.\n\n\n\n\n                                          47\n\fCR301. A motion can be granted based only on grounds raised in the motion.\n\nScience Spectrum, Inc. v. Martinez, 941 S.W.2d 910, 912 (Tex. 1997). Thus, the\n\npropriety of the summary judgment on Mr. Tarr’s statutory counterclaims rises and\n\nfalls with the assertion that the trial court had already properly “ruled as a matter of\n\nlaw” that these statutes did not protect the group home. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c);\n\nScience Spectrum, 941 S.W.2d at 912.           As discussed below, it did not and,\n\nconsequently, the judgment dismissing Mr. Tarr’s counterclaims should be reversed\n\nand remanded.\n\n      A.     Because the first partial summary judgment was in error, it cannot\n             negate Mr. Tarr’s counterclaims.\n\n      The trial court’s first partial summary judgment was based on the mistaken\n\nconclusion that Mr. Tarr had failed to adduce evidence to support the applicability\n\nof these protections. As discussed above, the evidence establishes that there is a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact regarding whether the residents of Westlake Recovery\n\nHouse are handicapped. Thus, there is no basis for granting summary judgment with\n\nrespect to the statutory affirmative defenses, much less Mr. Tarr’s counterclaims.\n\n      B.     Even a valid partial summary judgment on Mr. Tarr’s statutory\n             affirmative defenses would not negate the counterclaims.\n\n      The first partial summary judgment rules only that Mr. Tarr failed to carry his\n\nburden on his affirmative defenses based on the federal and state protections. What\n\nit does not do, and could not do, is affirmatively establish that the residents of\n\n\n                                          48\n\fWestlake Recovery Home are not handicapped or rule that Mr. Tarr presented no\n\nevidence in support of his counterclaims. C&R Transp. Inc. v. Campbell, 406\n\nS.W.2d 191, 194 (Tex. 1966) (holding that failure to meet a burden to prove\n\nsomething is not proof of the opposite proposition). Mr. Tarr’s counterclaims were\n\nnot part of the HOA’s first motion for partial summary judgment. Thus, Mr. Tarr\n\nwas not put to his proof on his counterclaims. They were not within the scope of the\n\nmotion. Instead, the HOA chose to limit the scope of its first motion to the\n\naffirmative defenses.\n\n      Further, it is improper procedurally to decide the counterclaims as part of the\n\nfirst partial summary judgment when those counterclaims were not part of the first\n\nmotion. Applying the first partial summary judgment ruling to the counterclaims\n\nimpermissibly retroactively enlarges the scope of The HOA’s first motion for partial\n\nsummary judgment.       This violates Rule 166a(c), which requires a summary\n\njudgment movant to state the grounds in the motion. The HOA’s first motion did\n\nnot purport to address the counterclaims. Further, using the first summary judgment\n\nruling as the affirmative defenses in this manner disregards and circumvents Rule\n\n166a’s notice requirements. Rule 166a(c) provides that a summary judgment\n\nmovant “shall state the specific grounds therefore.” TEX. R. CIV. PROC. 166a(c).\n\nThe first summary judgment did not include the counterclaims and did not give Mr.\n\n\n\n\n                                        49\n\fTarr notice that his counterclaims would be governed by a ruling on affirmative\n\ndefenses.\n\n      Mr. Tarr’s counterclaims should have been evaluated on the evidence before\n\nthe trial court when the motion was considered, not more limited evidence proffered\n\nin response to a different motion on a different part of the case. Mr. Tarr was free\n\nto produce evidence in support of his counterclaims when the HOA challenged them\n\nin its second motion for partial summary judgment. And because the first partial\n\nsummary judgment was interlocutory, the trial court could and should have\n\nconsidered the later-offered evidence, including Mr. Tarr’s second affidavit and the\n\naffidavits of the Westlake Recovery House residents. SCR19-37. See Ohrt, 398\n\nS.W.3d at 327-28 (“A partial summary judgment is interlocutory and thus the trial\n\ncourt retains the right to reconsider it until it enters a final judgment.”); Fabio, 226\n\nS.W.3d at 560-61; Clark, 184 S.W.3d at 909 (Tex. App.—Austin 2006, pet. denied);\n\nLoy, 128 S.W.3d at 409; see also Fruehauf Corp. v. Carrillo, 848 S.W.2d 83, 84\n\n(Tex. 1993) (per curiam) (“The trial court also retains continuing control over\n\ninterlocutory orders and has the power to set those orders aside any time before a\n\nfinal judgment is entered.”). Further, the trial court indicated in its order granting\n\nthe HOA’s second motion for partial summary judgment indicates that it considered\n\nMr. Tarr’s response, which included his second affidavit and the affidavits of the\n\nresidents of Westlake Recovery House. CR496. And there is no unfairness to the\n\n                                          50\n\fHOA in this; the HOA chose to move for summary judgment in a piecemeal fashion.\n\nIf it had intended for the first summary judgment on the affirmative defenses to\n\ngovern Mr. Tarr’s counterclaims, it should have moved on both bases in the first\n\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\n       As discussed in Part I.B above, Mr. Tarr’s affidavit in response to the first\n\nsummary judgment raises a fact issue with respect to whether the residents of his\n\ngroup home are handicapped or disabled within the meaning of the relevant statutes.\n\nAdditionally, in response to the HOA’s second motion for partial summary\n\njudgment, Mr. Tarr submitted the affidavits of seven residents of his group home\n\nsupporting this conclusion. Each explained that group living, particularly in a\n\nresidential setting, is important to his recovery from addiction. Each also testified\n\nas to how their respective drug and/or alcohol addictions have limited, and continue\n\nto substantially limit, major life activities.\n\n       Because there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the residents of\n\nWestlake Recovery House are handicapped, summary judgment on Mr. Tarr’s\n\ncounterclaims was improper and should be reversed.\n\nIII.   The trial court erred in awarding attorney’s fees to the HOA based on a\n       void and unenforceable injunction.\n\n       If the Court concludes that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment\n\non the HOA’s claim that Mr. Tarr’s group home violates the deed restriction, then it\n\nmust also reverse the award of $88,000 in attorney’s fees that is based solely on that\n                                            51\n\fclaim.10 But even if the Court upholds the trial court’s judgment with respect to the\n\nHOA’s breach claim, it must nonetheless reverse the award of $88,000 in attorney’s\n\nfees. Attorney’s fees may be awarded to the prevailing party. But, while facially\n\nsucceeding in the trial court, the HOA did not obtain any meaningful relief effecting\n\na material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties. Rather, it obtained an\n\ninjunction that is void and unenforceable. Thus, the HOA is not a prevailing party\n\nand may not recover attorney’s fees.\n\n       The HOA moved for attorney’s fees under section 5.006 of the Texas Property\n\nCode, which provides: “[i]n an action based on breach of a restrictive covenant\n\npertaining to real property, the court shall allow to a prevailing party who asserted\n\nthe action reasonable attorney’s fees in addition to the party’s costs and claim.” TEX.\n\nPROP. CODE § 5.006(a). The Property Code does not define “prevailing party,” but\n\nTexas courts have looked to federal jurisprudence when construing a contractual\n\n“prevailing party” attorney’s-fees provision that did not define the term, and, as this\n\nCourt has concluded, that analysis is instructive here. See Intercontinental Group\n\nP’ship v. KB Home Lone Star L.P., 295 S.W.3d 650, 653-54 (Tex. 2009); Norton v.\n\nDeer Creek Prop. Owners Ass’n, Inc., No. 03-09-00422-CV, 2010 WL 2867375, at\n\n*8 (Tex. App.—Austin July 22, 2010, no pet.) (mem. op.) (applying Intercontinental\n\n\n\n10\n  The HOA moved for attorney’s fees solely on the basis of its breach claim pursuant to Texas\nProperty Code section 5.006. CR499-503.\n\n                                             52\n\fto section 5.006(a); “The Texas Supreme Court’s analysis [in Intercontinental] in\n\nconstruing an undefined contractual “prevailing party” provision is equally\n\napplicable to our construction of the undefined statutory “prevailing party” provision\n\ninvolved here.”). In Intercontinental Group, the Texas Supreme Court noted that\n\nunder federal law, “a plaintiff ‘prevails’ when actual relief on the merits of his claim\n\nmaterially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the\n\ndefendant’s behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.” Id. at 654 (quoting\n\nFarrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 111-12, 113 S.Ct. 566, 121 L.Ed.2d 494 (1992)).\n\nAnd as this Court explained in Wibbenmeyer v. TechTerra Communications, Inc.,\n\nthe United States Supreme Court has held that to be a “prevailing party,” the party\n\nmust have obtained relief from the court (e.g., “enforceable judgments on the merits\n\nand court-ordered consent decrees”) that effect a “material alteration of the legal\n\nrelationship of the parties.” No. 03-09-00122-CV, 2010 WL 1173072, at *10 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Austin Mar. 26, 2010, pet. denied) (mem. op.)

In the words of the\n\nUnited States Supreme Court, “[r]espect for ordinary language requires that a\n\nplaintiff receive at least some relief on the merits of his claim before he can be said\n\nto prevail.” Hewitt v.

The position of the parties\n\nis precisely what it was before the HOA filed suit. Although the trial court issued\n\nan injunction, as discussed below, that injunction is void and unenforceable. The\n\ninjunction merely commands Mr. Tarr to “refrain from breaching the Declaration of\n\nCovenants, Conditions and Restrictions.” CR617; CR622. This injunction is void\n\nfor at least two reasons: the injunction (1) does not specifically identify the behavior\n\nthat Mr. Tarr must refrain from and (2) refers to an extraneous document, the deed\n\ncovenants, to define its scope.\n\n      As the Texas Supreme Court has stated, “an injunction decree must be as\n\ndefinite, clear and precise as possible and when practicable it should inform the\n\ndefendant of the acts he is restrained from doing, without calling on him for\n\ninferences or conclusions about which persons might well differ and without leaving\n\nanything for further hearing.” Villalobos v. Holguin, 146 Tex. 474, 208 S.W.2d 871,\n\n875 (Tex. 1948). And, as this Court has recognized, “[t]he injunction must spell out\n\nthe details of compliance in clear, specific and unambiguous terms so that such\n\nperson will readily know exactly what duties or obligations are imposed upon him.”\n\nDrew v. Unauthorized Practice of Law Comm., 970 S.W.2d 152, 156 (Tex. App.—\n\nAustin 1998, pet. denied); see also In re Krueger, No. 03-12-00838-CV, 2013 WL\n\n2157765, at *5 (Tex.

P. 683\n\nand Webb v. Glenbrook Owners Ass’n, 298 S.W.3d 374, 384 (Tex. App.—Dallas\n\n2009, no pet.))).\n\n      But the injunction issued by the trial court here does not specify what conduct\n\nis prohibited or how Mr. Tarr is to comply with the injunction. Compliance with the\n\ninjunction requires that Mr. Tarr interpret the deed restrictions and infer what\n\nconduct is prohibited. For example, what if Mr. Tarr had all new residents at\n\nWestlake Recovery House? Does the injunction prohibit just the current residents?\n\nIs Mr. Tarr prohibited from ever using the home as a group recovery home? Any\n\nfinding that the statutory protections did not apply to the previous residents would\n\nbe immaterial, and any action to enforce the injunction by contempt would require\n\nadditional factual determinations regarding whether those residents are handicapped.\n\nThe injunction’s failure to “spell out the details of compliance in clear, specific and\n\nunambiguous terms” so that Mr. Tarr can “readily know exactly what duties or\n\nobligations are imposed upon him” renders the injunction void and unenforceable.\n\nIn re Krueger, 2013 WL 2157765, at *5-6.\n\n      Further, as this Court explained in In re Krueger, an injunction is void if\n\nanother document, like the deed restrictions, “provides the means of describing the\n\n                                          55\n\fact or acts sought to be restrained.” 2013 WL 2157765, at *6. Texas Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 683 provides in relevant part: “Every order granting an injunction . . .\n\nshall describe in reasonable detail and not by reference to the complaint or other\n\ndocument, the act or acts sought to be restrained.” TEX. R. CIV. P. 683 (emphasis\n\nadded); In re Krueger, 2013 WL 2157765, at *6; Webb, 298 S.W.3d at 384. Here,\n\nthe only reference for what is prohibited or permitted is found in another document,\n\nthe deed restrictions. One might well imagine that Mr. Tarr and the HOA may differ\n\nwith respect to the proper interpretation of those deed restrictions.\n\n      Because the injunction is void, it “has no force or effect and confers no rights;\n\nit is a mere nullity.” In re Garza, 126 S.W.3d 268, 271 (Tex. App.—San Antonio\n\n2003, orig. proceeding); In re McCray, No. 05-13-01195-CV, 2013 WL 5969581, at\n\n*2 (Tex. App.—Dallas Nov. 7, 2013, orig. proceeding) (mem. op.). And “attorney’s\n\nfees based upon a void order must also be void.” In re McCray, 2013 WL 5969581,\n\nat *2 (Tex. App.—Dallas Nov. 7, 2013, orig. proceeding) (mem. op.)

App.—Tyler Feb. 16,\n\n2011, pet. denied) (mem. op.)).         The Texas Supreme Court explained in\n\nIntercontinental that “[w]hether a party prevails turns on whether the party prevails\n\nupon the court to award it something, either monetary or equitable.” And like the\n\nplaintiff in that case, the HOA “got nothing except a jury finding that [Mr. Tarr\n\n                                          56\n\fbreached the deed restrictions or failed to carry a summary judgment burden].

Thus, the attorney’s fees award must be reversed.\n\n                         CONCLUSION AND PRAYER\n\n       Appellant Mr. Tarr prays that the Court reverse the trial court’s judgment and\n\nremand for trial on both the HOA’s breach claim and Appellant’s counterclaims.\n\nAppellant further prays that the Court vacate the injunction and award of attorney’s\n\nfees.

Judge Y elenosky inadvertently put \"9 Day of September\" as the date the\n\n     Order was signed. The parties hereto agree and stipulate that this was an error and the hearing,\n\n     as well as the signing of Order Granting Lantana's No Evidence Motion for Partial Summary\n\n     Judgment as to Tarr's Federal Fair Housing Act, Texas Fair Housing Act, American's With\n\n     Disabilities Act, and Federal Rehabilitation Act affirmative defenses, both took place on\n\n     September 30, 2013.

Judge Shepperd also Granted Lantana's No Evidence Motion for\n\n Partial Summary Judgment as to Tarr's 1st and 14th Amendment rights and Texas Constitution,\n\n City of Austin's Code of Municipal Ordinances and Austin's Municipal Public Policy, and\n\n Lantana's violation of its own residential use deed restrictions causes of action.     The Court\n\n hereby includes said Order by reference in this Final Modified Judgment.\n\n        On March 24, 2014, Judge Shepperd also Granted Lantana's Traditional Motion for\n\n Partial Summary Judgment as to its breach of Lantana's Declaration of Covenants, Conditions,\n\n and Restrictions cause of action against Tarr. The Court hereby includes said Order by reference\n\n in this Final Modified Judgment.\n\n        On July 30' 2014, the Honorable Gisela D. Triana partially Granted Lantana's Motion for\n\n Final Summary Judgment whereby she commanded Tarr to deist and refrain from breaching the\n\n Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions for Lantana Southwest Single Family\n\n Properties and ordered the Clerk to issue a writ of injunctions in conformity with the law and the\n\n terms of her Order. The Court hereby includes said Order by reference in this Final Modified\n\n Judgment.\n\n        On September 3, 2014 the Honorable Amy Clark Meachum signed a Final Judgment that\n\n did not address the inadvertent September 9 date error giving rise to this Final Modified\n\n Judgment. The only remaining issue remaining in the case is Lantana's claim for attorney's fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                   622\n\f  -\n...   .   ..

Lantana and Tarr further agree that thirty five thousand dollars ($35,000.00) are\n\n          reasonable and necessary fees to be paid to Lantana should Tarr file an unsuccessful appeal of\n\n          this cause to the Texas Court of Appeals.       This agreed amount, however, is the maximum\n\n          amount to be paid by Tarr to Lantana in the event of said appeal and all amounts due and payable\n\n          must have been incurred by or on behalf of Lantana.\n\n                 No part of this Final Modified Judgment or the prior orders of this Court are agreed to by\n\n          Tarr except the amount of reasonable and necessary attorneys fees set forth above, and Tarr\n\n          reserves his right to appeal from every other ruling in this Judgment and those prior orders.\n\n                 Based on the prior orders of this Court and the parties' agreement concerning reasonable\n\n          and necessary attorney's fees it is:\n\n                  ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the Plaintiff Lantana shall have\n\n          judgment from and against the Defendant Tarr as follows:\n\n                                  1.

Kevin Tarr\n                     I\n   Dear counr l,\n\n          On July 21 , 2014, the Court considered and took under advisement Plaintiff's Motion for\n   Final Sumrhary Judgment in the above-referenced cause. After considering the motion, the\n   response, tle reply, the admissible summary judgment evidence, and the applicable law, the\n   Court will lnd as fo llows.\n\n           The Court has signed the Order Partially Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Final Summary\n   Judgment, r hich the parties have approved as to form , addressing the permanent injunction.\n   Regarding Ji>laintiffs remaining claim for attorney's fees , the Court will find that it is a fact issue\n   as to the arhount of reasonable and necessary fees , but that Plainti ff may recover the attorney's\n   fees for pr~vai ling against defenses asserted to its primary claim. The parties also disagree on\n   whether the attorney's fees must be segregated. The Court does not decide which fees, if any,\n   must be se~regated , but provides the following guidance after considering the app licable Texas\n   law on this - ssue.\n                    1\n           The question of whether segregation is required in a particular case is a legal inquiry,\n   subject to ~e novo review. See Transcon. Realty Investors, Inc. v. McGuire, Craddock, Strother\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                619\n\fCause No. D-I·Gr -12-002467 :\nIn the 98'h Judici j l Distri ct Court of Trav is Co., Tx.\nLantana Southwer;t Home01rners Ass ·n In c. v. Kevin Torr\nJul y 30, 20 14\n\n\n\n\n& Hale, P.         b.,\n                  2011 Tex. App. LEXIS 2968, * 13 (Tex. App. Dallas Apr. 20, 2011 ). When\naffirmative ld efenses are asserted to a claim for which attorney's fees can be recovered, Texas\ncourts will rot automatically allow the opposing party to suggest to the jury that overcoming\nthose defen es was unnecessary or required to be segregated. See Tony Gullo Motors I. L.P. v.\n                   1\n\nChapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 314 (Tex. 2006); see also. Transcon. Realty Investors, Inc. at *13 .\nOften the f~es associated with affirmative defenses can be recovered as part of the main claim.\nThe same 9rinciples can even apply in particular cases regarding the prevailing party having to\novercome cpunterclaims, when the counterclaim is in essence a defense to the claim. See 7979\nAirport Garage, L.L.C v. Dollar Rent A Car Sys .. Inc., 245 S.W.3d 488 , 507 (Tex. App. -\nHouston [1 f th Dist.] 2007, pet. denied) (citing Varner v. Cardenas, 218 S.W.3d 68, 69-70 (Tex.\n2007) (per ~uriam). Pursuant to this line of cases, Defendant likely cannot require segregation of\nall the exptnses ~ssocia_ted wi~h their affirmative defen~es:counte:claims since many of these\nexpenses will be mtertwmed w1th the enforcement of PlamtJffs claim . However, the Court that\noversees thbI trial on the remaining merits (the reasonable and necessary attorney ' s fees) is in the\nbest position to make specific rulings on disputes regarding segregation.\n\n                                                             Sincerely,\n\n\n\n\n                                                             Gisela D.

It is undisputed that federal and state law protects group homes for\n            recovering alcoholics and drug addicts from discrimination that\n            would prevent them from locating and operating in residential\n            neighborhoods. It is also undisputed that the deed restriction at\n            issue in this case expressly provides that its restriction of permitted\n            uses to “single family residential use” does not exclude those\n            protected by federal and state law, such as group homes.\n               a. Did the trial err in finding that the HOA conclusively proved\n                  that Mr. Tarr’s operation of his property as a group home for\n                  recovering alcoholics and drug addicts is not a “residential\n                  use” within the meaning of the deed restrictions?\n               b. Did the trial court err in ruling that it was Mr. Tarr’s burden to\n                  prove that his use of his property as a protected group home did\n                  not breach the deed restrictions?\n         2. Is there a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether the\n            residents of Westlake Recovery House are handicapped or disabled\n            under the applicable federal and state statutes?\n         3. Did the trial court err in awarding attorney’s fees to the HOA even\n            where the only relief the HOA obtained is an injunction that is void\n            and unenforceable?\nIntroduction ................................................................................................................1\nStatement of Facts ......................................................................................................3\n         The HOA’s First Motion for Partial Summary Judgment ...............................6\n         The HOA’s Second Motion for Partial Summary Judgment ...........................8\n\n                                                              v\n\f         The HOA’s Third Motion for Summary Judgment ........................................12\n         The Final Judgment .......................................................................................12\nSummary of the Argument.......................................................................................13\nArgument..................................................................................................................16\nI. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment for the HOA on its\n   claim that Westlake Recovery House breaches the deed restrictions. ..............17\n     A. The HOA did not meet its burden of conclusively proving that the\n        Westlake Recovery House residents were not authorized to remain\n        “by any state or federal law” and, thus that Mr. Tarr’s group home\n        violated the deed restriction.........................................................................19\n           1. The HOA failed to meet its burden—the Texas and Federal Fair\n              Housing Acts and supporting case law protect group homes such\n              as Mr. Tarr’s. .........................................................................................21\n           2. The HOA’s assertion that Mr. Tarr’s group home is a “for profit\n              duplex” is immaterial to residential use under paragraph 4.1. ..............24\n     B. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment with respect to\n        the affirmative defense that statutory law prohibits enforcement of\n        the deed restriction.......................................................................................31\n           1. The evidence indicates that the Westlake Recovery House\n              residents’ impairments limit a major life activity. ................................34\n           2. There is a fact issue with respect to whether the residents are\n              “regarded as disabled” under the third definition. ................................42\n     C. The HOA failed to give Mr. Tarr proper notice of the alleged\n        violations of the deed restrictions. ...............................................................46\nII. The trial court erroneously granted summary judgment on Mr. Tarr’s\n    counterclaims based entirely on its erroneous summary judgment on the\n    affirmative defenses. ..........................................................................................47\n     A. Because the first partial summary judgment was in error, it cannot\n        negate Mr. Tarr’s counterclaims..................................................................48\n     B. Even a valid partial summary judgment on Mr. Tarr’s statutory\n        affirmative defenses would not negate the counterclaims. .........................48\n\n\n                                                            vi\n\fIII.

It is undisputed that federal and state law protects group homes for\n     recovering alcoholics and drug addicts from discrimination that would\n     prevent them from locating and operating in residential neighborhoods. It\n     is also undisputed that the deed restriction at issue in this case expressly\n     provides that its restriction of permitted uses to “single family residential\n     use” does not exclude those protected by federal and state law, such as\n     group homes.\n\n     a.    Did the trial err in finding that the HOA conclusively proved that\n           Mr. Tarr’s operation of his property as a group home for recovering\n           alcoholics and drug addicts is not a “residential use” within the\n           meaning of the deed restrictions?\n\n     b.    Did the trial court err in ruling that it was Mr. Tarr’s burden to prove\n           that his use of his property as a protected group home did not breach\n           the deed restrictions?\n\n2.   Is there a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether the\n     residents of Westlake Recovery House are handicapped or disabled under\n     the applicable federal and state statutes?\n\n3.   Did the trial court err in awarding attorney’s fees to the HOA even where\n     the only relief the HOA obtained is an injunction that is void and\n     unenforceable?\n\n\n\n\n                                    xvi\n\fTO THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS:\n\n      Appellant Kevin Tarr respectfully submits this Brief.\n\n                                INTRODUCTION\n\n      Kevin Tarr owns and operates Westlake Recovery House, a residential group\n\nhome for men recovering from alcohol and drug addictions located in the Lantana\n\nSouthwest subdivision. Courts have long and routinely held that group homes in\n\nresidential neighborhoods are protected by federal and state law. “Since the [Federal\n\nHousing Act] Amendments took effect, courts have made clear that single family\n\ndeed restrictions cannot be used to exclude group homes for disabled persons from\n\nsingle family neighborhoods.” United States v.

In the Fair Housing Act (“FHA”), the federal government\n\nexpressed a clear policy in favor of removing barriers preventing individuals with\n\nphysical and mental disabilities from living in group homes in residential settings\n\nand against restrictions that serve to exclude congregate living arrangements for the\n\ndisabled. “The legislative history of the amended Fair Housing Act reflects the\n\nnational policy of deinstitutionalizing disabled individuals and integrating them into\n\nthe mainstream of society.” United States v.

App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] Aug. 29, 2013, no pet.) (mem. op.). It is beyond dispute that\n\nthose recovering from alcohol and drug addictions like the residents of Westlake\n\nRecovery House are impaired within the statutory meaning. Indeed, the record is\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\freplete with evidence that the residents are handicapped by reason of their\n\naddictions.\n\n      But the Lantana Southwest Homeowners’ Association does not want the\n\nWestlake Recovery House in its neighborhood and sought an injunction to force the\n\nhandicapped residents out. The trial court failed to properly recognize and apply the\n\nlegal protections, which arise in three separate ways in this case to protect Mr. Tarr’s\n\ngroup recovery home:\n\n      1) As an element of the HOA’s claim that Mr. Tarr’s group home violates\n         the restrictive covenant’s residential use limitation: The deed restriction\n         on which the HOA bases its claim expressly provides that it does not\n         exclude uses that are protected by federal or state law, which includes the\n         FHA’s protection of group homes for the handicapped. Thus, to prove\n         breach, the HOA must prove that Mr. Tarr’s use of the property as a group\n         home falls outside the deed restriction’s inclusive definition.\n      2) As an affirmative defense: Even if the deed restrictions had not\n         incorporated the statutory protections into the definition of residential use,\n         the statutes would nevertheless prohibit discriminatory enforcement of\n         such a deed restriction.\n      3) As claims for relief based on discrimination: The federal and Texas\n         FHAs provide causes of action for those aggrieved by discriminatory\n         conduct in violation of the FHA.\n\nThis Court should reverse and remand for a trial.\n\n                            STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      Appellant Kevin Tarr operates a group home for men recovering from drug\n\nand alcohol addictions in a residential neighborhood in southwest Austin. Mr. Tarr\n\nbegan operating Westlake Recovery House on July 1, 2012, as a group home offering\n\n\n                                           3\n\fa safe and supportive living environment for men who are recovering from drug or\n\nalcohol addiction. CR294; SCR19-20; SCR23-37. In addition to living quarters,\n\nWestlake Recovery House provides in-house twelve-step meetings, drug testing,\n\naccountability partners, and life skills coaching to facilitate recovery and to help the\n\nresidents stay off drugs and alcohol. CR294; SCR19-20; SCR23-37. The residents\n\nprocure their own food, do their own cooking, and generally live communally as a\n\nfamily. CR284, 415.\n\n      Westlake Recovery House accepts only residents who have a “handicap” or\n\n“disability” as those terms are defined in the Federal Fair Housing Act, Texas Fair\n\nHousing Act, Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Federal Rehabilitation Act.\n\nCR294-95; SCR19-20; SCR23-37. Westlake Recovery House accepts only those\n\napplicants who require the special living conditions provided in a group recovery\n\nhome like Westlake Recovery House. CR294-95; SCR20; SCR23-37. Further,\n\nWestlake Recovery House does not accept or allow any person to remain who is\n\ncurrently using drugs or alcohol. CR294-95; SCR20.\n\n      Mr. Tarr’s property is located within the Lantana Southwest subdivision and\n\nis subject to homeowners’ association deed restrictions (the “deed restrictions”).\n\nCR294; CR10-36. Paragraph 4.1 provides:\n\n             Residential Use. All Lots shall be improved and used\n             solely for single family residential use, inclusive of a\n             garage, fencing and other such Improvements as are\n             necessary or customarily incident to residential use. No\n                                           4\n\f              building, outbuilding or portion of either may be built on\n              a Lot for use as income-producing property (i.e., for lease\n              to tenants who do not occupy an entire Lot). A “single\n              family” shall be defined as any number of persons related\n              by blood, marriage or adoption, and shall also include\n              foster children and domestic servants. This Declaration\n              shall not, however, exclude from a Lot any person who is\n              authorized to so remain by any state or federal law.\n\nCR16, ¶4.1.\n\n      Responding to concerns expressed by his neighbors, Mr. Tarr sent a letter to\n\nthem explaining that he was using his property as a recovery house and that this use\n\nis protected by federal and state law. CR38. On August 10, 2012, Steve Portnoy,\n\nthe president of the HOA, sent an email to a Lantana homeowner and representatives\n\nof the HOA’s management company in which he stated:\n\n              This has now escalated past the point of what is even\n              remotely acceptable for our neighborhood. A halfway\n              house? This has to be shut down and quickly. Can you\n              please have the HOA attorney contact me about pursuing\n              a more aggressive course of action?\n\nSCR21. That same day, the HOA’s attorney sent Mr. Tarr a letter threatening to\n\nbring suit. CR474. Although the deed restrictions require ten-days’ notice before\n\nfiling suit (CR34, ¶12.8), only four days later, on August 14, 2012, Appellee Lantana\n\nSouthwest Homeowners’ Association, Inc. (the “HOA”), filed its “Original Petition,\n\nApplication for Temporary Restraining Order, & Request for Disclosure,” alleging\n\nthat Mr. Tarr’s use of his property as a group recovery home violates paragraph 4.1\n\nof the Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions (“deed restrictions”),\n\n                                          5\n\fwhich limits a landowner’s permissible use to single family residential use. CR5-\n\n50. On that same day, in an ex parte hearing, the trial court (Judge Amy Clark\n\nMeachum) granted the HOA’s temporary restraining order.\n\n      On August 27, 2012, Mr. Tarr filed his Answer and Counterclaims. Mr. Tarr\n\nargued that the use of a residential house as a group home for those recovering from\n\nsubstance abuse is protected under certain federal and state laws because its residents\n\nwere “handicapped” or “disabled” within the meaning of those laws. Mr. Tarr also\n\nbrought counterclaims against the HOA for discrimination under some of those laws.\n\n      Rather than address the issues head on, the HOA filed three separate motions\n\nfor partial summary judgment, CR168, 298, and 499, each of which was heard and\n\ndecided by a different judge on the Travis County rotating docket. CR296-97, 496-\n\n98, and 617. These partial summary judgments are incorporated in the Final\n\nModified Judgment. CR621-24.\n\nThe HOA’s First Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n\n      On August 26, 2013, the HOA moved for partial summary judgment on both\n\ntraditional and no-evidence grounds on Mr. Tarr’s affirmative defense that federal\n\nand state laws against discrimination against handicapped or disabled individuals\n\nprohibited excluding the Westlake Recovery House residents. CR168-75. The\n\nHOA’s traditional motion argued that Mr. Tarr does not have standing to assert these\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fdefenses and that the federal and state discrimination laws do not apply as a matter\n\nof law. The trial court denied the HOA’s traditional motion. CR296.\n\n       But the trial court granted the HOA’s no-evidence motion. CR297. In that\n\nmotion, the HOA asserted that Mr. Tarr has no evidence to support his affirmative\n\ndefenses under federal and state law. CR172-75. Specifically, the HOA asserted\n\nthat there was no evidence that the residents of Westlake Recovery House meet the\n\nstatutory definitions of handicap and disability under the various statutes. CR173-\n\n74.\n\n       In response, Mr. Tarr submitted an affidavit in which he testified that he is\n\noperating a recovery group home and that to be admitted to Westlake Recovery\n\nHouse, all prospective residents are required to have a “handicap” as defined by the\n\nFederal Fair Housing Act (or “disability as defined by the Texas Fair Housing Act)1\n\nby reason of a drug or alcohol addiction for which they are seeking recovery.\n\nCR294-95. Moreover, he testified that the residents must undergo substance testing\n\nto ensure that they are not currently using drugs or alcohol. Id. The residents are\n\nalso required to participate in in-house and outside recovery meetings as part of their\n\nrecovery. Id. Mr. Tarr also testified that Westlake Recovery House provides “a live-\n\n\n\n1\n  The definition of “disability” in the Texas FHA is identical to the definition of “handicap” in the\nFederal FHA, and the protections offered are the same as provided by the federal FHA. TEX. PROP.\nCODE §§ 301.002(3), 301.003(6) , 301.025. Throughout this brief, discussion of the Federal FHA\nrefers to both the federal and Texas FHA.\n\n                                                 7\n\fin manager, assigned accountability partners, transportation assistance to outside\n\nrecovery meetings, and other services consistent with the property’s primary purpose\n\nas a drug and alcohol recovery group home.” Id.\n\n      Although the HOA did not reply to Mr. Tarr’s response or respond to this\n\nevidence, on September 30, 2013, the trial court (Judge Stephen Yelenosky) granted\n\nonly the no-evidence portion of the HOA’s first motion and denied the traditional\n\nportion of the motion. CR297; CR621.\n\nThe HOA’s Second Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n\n      On January 1, 2014, the HOA filed a second motion for partial summary\n\njudgment. This motion also had two parts: The first part asserted that Mr. Tarr’s\n\ncounterclaims under federal and state discrimination statutes were barred as a matter\n\nof law because of the trial court’s ruling on the HOA’s first no-evidence motion on\n\nthe affirmative defenses. CR298-304. The HOA offered no other ground for\n\nsummary judgment on Mr. Tarr’s statutory discrimination counterclaims. CR301.\n\n      In the second part of the motion, the HOA, relying entirely on Mr. Tarr’s\n\n“pleadings and testimony,” claimed that it was entitled to summary judgment on its\n\nclaim that Mr. Tarr’s use of the property as a group recovery home breached\n\nparagraph 4.1 of the deed restrictions. CR304-05. The HOA’s “evidence” of breach\n\nis captured in a mere three sentences. First, the HOA notes that Mr. Tarr’s Answer\n\nstates that he is “operating a sober house, group home.” CR304. Next, the HOA\n\n\n                                         8\n\fnotes that Mr. Tarr testified by deposition that was aware of the deed restriction. Id.\n\nLast, the HOA asserts that Mr. Tarr testified in his deposition that “this is a for-profit\n\nendeavor in which he is making at least $6,000 to $8,000 per month.” CR304. In\n\nfact, Mr. Tarr testified that Westlake Recovery House charges residents $600 to $800\n\nper month, meaning that, with ten residents, Westlake Recovery House collects\n\nbetween $6,000 and $8,000 each month. CR415. Of course, this amount represents\n\ngross receipts, not net profits. Id. (“Q. How much money on average do you gross\n\neach month from the recovery house?”). Importantly, the HOA’s motion attached\n\nno evidence indicating that using the property as a group recovery home is not a\n\npermitted residential use within paragraph 4.1’s definition, which incorporates\n\nfederal and state law protections for group homes and provides that the restriction is\n\nviolated only if the residents are not “authorized to so remain by any state or federal\n\nlaw.” CR16, ¶ 4.1.\n\n      Mr. Tarr responded with his own affidavit and those of seven residents of the\n\nrecovery home. SCR19-37. Tarr’s affidavit states that “Westlake Recovery House\n\nis a group home that offers a safe and supportive living environment for men who\n\nare recovering from drug or alcohol addiction.” SCR19. It provides living quarters,\n\nas well as “in-house twelve step meetings, drug testing, accountability partners, and\n\nlife skills coaching to help the men stay off drugs and alcohol.” SCR19-20. Further,\n\nWestlake Recovery House accepts only those that require the special living\n\n                                            9\n\fconditions that the home provides and does not allow any person that is currently\n\nusing drugs or alcohol. SCR20.\n\n      In response to the HOA’s mischaracterization of his testimony about Westlake\n\nRecovery House’s finances, Mr. Tarr testified that “Westlake Recovery House\n\ncharges its residents for their living accommodations and other services. It has to do\n\nso in order to provide these services. Its costs of operation are approximately $7,200\n\nper month. At this time I do not take a salary or other compensation for operating\n\nthe House, and although we have been a sober house for 18 months, the company\n\nhas not yet broken even. I personally finance this loss.” SCR20.\n\n      Each of the Westlake Recovery House residents testified that they are\n\nrecovering from drug or alcohol addictions and came to Westlake Recovery House\n\nseeking recovery. SCR23-37. Each acknowledged that his addiction is a chronic\n\ncondition and that he needs a group recovery setting to resist the addiction. Id.\n\nFurther, each testified about the substantial limitations his addiction has placed on\n\nhis life. Id. For example, Brad Buhler testified that\n\n             I know from my personal experience that addiction is a\n             chronic condition. With the proper support I can stay\n             away from alcohol but I can never get rid of the craving\n             for it.\n\n             Before I began my recovery, my addiction to alcohol\n             caused me and my family continuing harm. As a result of\n             my addiction, I had two DUI’s, my driver[’]s license was\n             suspended, lost over $500,000 financially, and served\n             fourteen months in prison.\n                                         10\n\f             Living in the Westlake Recovery House is critical to my\n             successful recovery from my addiction. The structured\n             environment, services, and support from the house and\n             other addicts helps me avoid relapsing into the use of\n             alcohol. The members of the group living in the house are\n             like a family, and we support each other. It is also very\n             helpful to me to live in an ordinary residential\n             neighborhood where, I can feel like an ordinary person\n             rather than merely another alcoholic.\n\nSCR23, ¶¶2-5.\n\n      Similarly, Kole Coward testified that for three years immediately before\n\nbeginning his recovery for addiction to marijuana, Xanax, and alcohol, he was\n\n“homeless, lost three jobs, lost all my clothes, and over $5,000.” SCR25, ¶¶2-4.\n\nJackson Hanks testified that, as a result of his former 10-year heroin addiction, he\n\n“lost all of my possessions, cost my family over $1,000,000 in losses, and spent six\n\nmonths in prison with a felony for possessing an illegal drug.” SCR27, ¶¶2-4.\n\nDaniel Kelly likewise testified that, before his recovery began, he abused alcohol for\n\nfour years, leading to the loss of “a successful job, caused two car accidents, was\n\narrested for driving while intoxicated, lost over $50,000 financially, and ended three\n\nrelationships with girlfriends.” SCR32, ¶¶2-4. In all, the seven residents testified\n\nby affidavit, each with his own similar, but unique and personal, story about how\n\nsubstance abuse had severely impacted his life, and how the recovery home has\n\nchanged that. SCR23-37.\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f       On March 24, 2014, the trial court (Judge Eric Shepperd) granted the HOA’s\n\nsecond motion for partial summary judgment as to each of Mr. Tarr’s counterclaims,\n\nas well as the HOA’s affirmative claim that Mr. Tarr breached the deed restrictions.\n\nCR497-98.\n\nThe HOA’s Third Motion for Summary Judgment\n\n       On June 12, 2014, the HOA’s filed its motion for final summary judgment\n\nseeking to permanently enjoin Mr. Tarr from “utilizing his Lot for multifamily use\n\nand/or as an income producing property” and an award of attorney’s fees. CR499-\n\n605. On July 18, 2014, Mr. Tarr responded and moved for reconsideration of the\n\ntwo partial summary judgments. CR606-13.\n\n       On July 30, 2014, the trial court (Judge Gisela D. Triana) granted the HOA’s\n\nmotion only in part, ordering only that Mr. Tarr be “commanded to desist and refrain\n\nfrom breaching the [deed restrictions]” and also awarded attorney’s fees to the\n\nHOA.2\n\nThe Final Judgment\n\n       On September 3, 2014, the trial court (Judge Amy Clark Meachum) entered a\n\nfinal judgment incorporating the three partial summary judgments and awarding the\n\n\n2\n  The trial court (Judge Triana presiding) partially granted the third motion for summary\njudgment—ordering the injunctive relief quoted above—based on the issuance of the first two\npartial summary judgments. CR617. Judge Triana also issued a letter ruling finding that the HOA\nwas entitled to attorney’s fees but finding that a fact issue exited as to the amount of fees to be\nawarded. CR619.\n\n                                                12\n\fHOA $88,000 in attorneys’ fees and $35,000 in appellate attorney’s fees if Mr. Tarr\n\nshould pursue an unsuccessful appeal. SCR70-72. This final judgment contained\n\nan error regarding the date of the first partial summary judgment, which was\n\ncorrected when, on October 28, 2014, the trial court (Judge Rhonda Hurley) entered\n\nits Final Modified Judgment. CR621-24.3\n\n                         SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n       There is no dispute that federal and state statutes protect group homes and\n\nprevent the use of restrictive covenants to prohibit their location in residential\n\nneighborhoods. Nor is there any dispute that the deed restrictions for the Lantana\n\nSouthwest subdivision recognize and incorporate those protections directly into its\n\nresidential use restriction. That is, paragraph 4.1 of the deed restrictions, the very\n\nprovision on which the HOA bases its claim, provides that uses that are protected by\n\nfederal and state law—which includes group homes for the handicapped—may not\n\nbe excluded by the residential use restriction.\n\n       Further, it cannot be reasonably disputed that alcoholics and drug addicts\n\nseeking recovery in a residential group home are handicapped under the statutory\n\ndefinitions. The HOA does not dispute that to be admitted to Westlake Recovery\n\nHouse an applicant must be handicapped. Nor does the HOA dispute the fact that\n\n\n\n3\n Mr. Tarr timely filed a motion for new trial, extending the trial court’s plenary power. SCR73-\n93.\n\n                                              13\n\fWestlake Recovery House provides services for its residents for the purpose of\n\nfacilitating their recovery from addiction. In short, the HOA does not appear to\n\ndispute that Westlake Recovery House is exactly what it purports to be: a group\n\nhome for men handicapped by reason of their addictions to drugs and alcohol and\n\nunable to remain clean or otherwise care for themselves without the care and\n\nassistance of a residential group home.\n\n      Nevertheless, the HOA does not want Westlake Recovery House in its\n\nneighborhood and, without proper notice to Mr. Tarr, sought and obtained an ex\n\nparte temporary restraining order against Mr. Tarr’s operation of his property as a\n\ngroup home. Then, through a series of piecemeal and erroneous partial summary\n\njudgments each heard by a different judge, the trial court compounded the error of\n\nthat TRO by giving the HOA summary judgment on its breach claim and dismissing\n\nMr. Tarr’s affirmative defenses and discrimination counterclaims.\n\n      First, the HOA failed to carry its summary judgment burden to prove\n\nconclusively that Mr. Tarr’s group home was not a permitted use under paragraph\n\n4.1. Indeed, the HOA did not even purport to contest that Westlake Recovery House\n\nis a protected group home. Nevertheless, the trial court ruled that the HOA had\n\nconclusively proved its breach claim.\n\n      Moreover, even if the deed restrictions had not incorporated the statutory\n\nprotections into the residential use restriction, the statutes would nevertheless\n\n                                          14\n\fprohibit discriminatory enforcement of such a deed restriction. Further, the federal\n\nand Texas FHAs provide causes of action for those aggrieved by discriminatory\n\nconduct in violation of the FHA. But the trial court erroneously ruled that there was\n\nnot even a scintilla of evidence that the residents of Westlake Recovery House are\n\nhandicapped despite testimony regarding the House’s admissions policy and\n\nservices for handicapped men seeking recovery for substance addictions. Moreover,\n\nthe trial court ignored the testimony of the residents themselves regarding their\n\nimpairment due to their addictions, the ways in which their addictions prevent them\n\nfrom caring for themselves, and the risk of relapse without the services provided by\n\nWestlake Recovery House.\n\n      This evidence is much more than a scintilla of evidence that the current and\n\nfuture residents of Westlake Recovery House are handicapped under the statutory\n\ndefinitions. Indeed, as the HOA’s pleadings and the evidence make clear, it is the\n\nresidents’ handicaps that motivated the HOA’s actions to remove them from the\n\nneighborhood.\n\n      Finally, the trial court awarded the HOA $88,000 in attorney’s fees (and\n\n$35,000 in appellate attorney’s fees). But this attorney’s fees award cannot stand.\n\nFirst, it is based on the erroneous summary judgment rulings. But, in addition, the\n\naward must be reversed because the HOA is not a “prevailing party” because the\n\ninjunction it obtained is void and unenforceable. Contrary to the rules, the injunction\n\n                                          15\n\f(1) does not specifically identify the behavior that Mr. Tarr must refrain from and\n\n(2) refers to an extraneous document, the deed covenants, to define its scope. Rather,\n\nit merely provides that Mr. Tarr must refrain from breaching the deed restrictions.\n\nThus, because the HOA did not procure a judgment that materially altered the legal\n\npositions of the parties, it is not a prevailing party and may not be awarded attorney’s\n\nfees.\n\n        For all of the reasons discussed below, this Court should reverse the trial\n\ncourt’s erroneous summary judgment and remand for trial.\n\n                                    ARGUMENT\n\n        The disjointed and piecemeal manner in which the issues were presented to\n\nfive different judges of the Travis County trial bench confused the issues in the trial\n\ncourt and complicates the presentation of the issues on appeal. Rather than address\n\nthe various partial summary judgments separately, Part I below addresses the HOA’s\n\nclaims that Mr. Tarr violated the deed restrictions (second partial summary\n\njudgment) and Mr. Tarr’s affirmative defenses (second partial summary judgment);\n\nPart II addresses the trial court’s erroneous dismissal of his counterclaims (second\n\npartial summary judgment).

To establish a violation,\n\nthe HOA must show that the deed restriction is applicable and valid with respect to\n\nMr. Tarr’s use of the home and that that use is not a permissible “residential use.”\n\nAs discussed in Part A below, the HOA failed to carry this burden. Paragraph 4.1\n\nexpressly provides that the residential use restriction does not exclude uses, such as\n\ngroup homes, that are protected by federal and state law. As courts throughout the\n\nnation routinely hold, use of a property as a group home constitutes residential use.\n\nMoreover, the HOA’s factual assertions that the group home is an impermissible\n\n“for profit” duplex are unfounded and, in any case, immaterial.\n\n      The HOA will undoubtedly argue that the trial court’s first partial summary\n\njudgment bars any argument that federal and state law protects group homes like Mr.\n\nTarr’s. But, as discussed in Part A, paragraph 4.1 expressly incorporates these\n\nstatutory protections into the deed restriction itself; protected uses, like group homes,\n\nare deemed to be permitted residential uses and, thus the HOA bore the summary\n\njudgment burden of conclusively proving that the WRH was not protected by federal\n\nand state law. Further, as discussed in Part B, even if these protections were not\n\nincorporated into the deed restriction itself, the federal and state protections would\n\nnevertheless prohibit enforcement against Mr. Tarr’s group home, and Mr. Tarr’s\n\n                                           18\n\fevidence creates a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether the residents\n\nof Westlake Recovery House are handicapped.\n\n      A.     The HOA did not meet its burden of conclusively proving that the\n             Westlake Recovery House residents were not authorized to remain\n             “by any state or federal law” and, thus that Mr. Tarr’s group home\n             violated the deed restriction.\n\n      The HOA claims that Mr. Tarr has breached paragraph 4.1 of the deed\n\nrestrictions “by turning his home, a single family residence, into a for-profit duplex.”\n\nCR304. Paragraph 4.1 provides:\n\n             Residential Use. All Lots shall be improved and used\n             solely for single family residential use, inclusive of a\n             garage, fencing and other such Improvements as are\n             necessary or customarily incident to residential use. No\n             building, outbuilding or portion of either may be built on\n             a Lot for use as income-producing property (i.e., for lease\n             to tenants who do not occupy an entire Lot). A “single\n             family” shall be defined as any number of persons related\n             by blood, marriage or adoption, and shall also include\n             foster children and domestic servants. This Declaration\n             shall not, however, exclude from a Lot any person who is\n             authorized to so remain by any state or federal law.\nCR16, ¶4.1 (emphasis added). As the party seeking to enforce the deed restriction,\n\nthe HOA has the burden of proving conclusively that the deed restriction is valid and\n\nenforceable against Mr. Tarr and that his use of the property as a group home\n\nbreached the deed restriction.

Thus, the HOA’s summary judgment burden was to establish conclusively that\n\nMr. Tarr’s use of the property as a group home for recovering alcoholics and drug\n\naddicts is not a permitted “residential use” within the meaning of paragraph 4.1.\n\n      Yet not only does the evidence the HOA asserts supports this claim fail to\n\nconclusively establish a breach of the deed restriction, it is not sufficient to establish\n\neven a prima facie case for breach. The HOA points to Mr. Tarr’s Answer, which\n\nstates that he is “operating a sober house, group home.” CR 304. It also points to\n\nTarr’s deposition testimony that he receives $6,000 to $8,000 a month from the\n\ngroup home residents. The HOA asserts that this is conclusive evidence that the\n\ngroup home is “a for-profit endeavor.” CR304. The HOA’s motion does not point\n\nto any additional evidence to support its breach claim. CR304-05.\n\n      As discussed below, this evidence is woefully insufficient to carry the HOA’s\n\nsummary judgment burden. First, the restriction does not and cannot prohibit group\n\nhomes like Mr. Tarr’s (Part 1). Moreover, the HOA’s assertions that the group home\n\nis a “for profit duplex” (Part 2) are unsupported by the evidence and, in any case,\n\n                                           20\n\fimmaterial to the question of whether Mr. Tarr’s use of the home as a group home\n\nis a permissible use under paragraph 4.1.\n\n            1.     The HOA failed to meet its burden—the Texas and Federal\n                   Fair Housing Acts and supporting case law protect group\n                   homes such as Mr. Tarr’s.\n\n      Courts universally recognize that residential use restrictions are not valid or\n\nenforceable against and do not prohibit group homes for recovering alcoholics and\n\ndrug addicts like Mr. Tarr’s.

The covenant\n\n\n                                        21\n\fprovides that the residential use restriction “shall not, however, exclude” any person\n\nwhose presence is protected by federal and state law.

Thus, to establish\n\nthe deed restriction’s validity, enforceability, and breach against Mr. Tarr, the HOA\n\nmust demonstrate that—considering the exemption for group homes included in\n\nparagraph 4.1—Mr. Tarr’s use of the home is not a permitted “residential use.”\n\n      Indeed, even in cases where, unlike here, the covenant does not include\n\nexpress language including uses protected by federal and state law within the\n\nmeaning of “residential use,” courts nevertheless hold that group homes fall within\n\nthe meaning of single-family residential use.

Mr. Tarr testified that to be\n\nadmitted to Westlake Recovery House, residents must have a “handicap” as defined\n\nby the FHA by reason of a drug or alcohol addiction for which they are seeking\n\nrecovery. CR294-95. Further, each resident testified that he is a recovering\n\nalcoholic and/or drug addict and that his addiction to alcohol or drugs caused severe\n\nharm and impaired his ability to function normally. SCR23-37. And each testified\n\nthat without proper support, they would relapse. Id. Mr. Tarr’s use of his property\n\nas a group recovery home for handicapped men is clearly within paragraph 4.1’s use\n\nrestriction. At the very least, there is a fact question, precluding summary judgment.\n\n             2.     The HOA’s assertion that Mr. Tarr’s group home is a “for\n                    profit duplex” is immaterial to residential use under\n                    paragraph 4.1.\n\n      As noted above, the HOA’s only contention regarding breach is that Mr.\n\nTarr’s use of the home as a group home violates paragraph 4.1’s residential use\n\nrestriction because it is a “for profit endeavor.” CR304-05. According to the HOA,\n\nMr. Tarr testified “that this is a for-profit endeavor in which he is making at least\n\n$6,000 to $8,000 per month.” CR304. First, this is a misrepresentation of Mr. Tarr’s\n\n\n                                           24\n\factual testimony. Rather, Mr. Tarr testified that on average Westlake Recovery\n\nHouse charges residents $600 to $800 per month, meaning that, with ten residents,\n\nWestlake Recovery House gross collections are between $6,000 and $8,000 each\n\nmonth. CR415. Mr. Tarr testified that the costs of operating Westlake Recovery\n\nHouse are approximately $7,200 per month and that Westlake Recovery House has\n\nnot yet broken even. SCR20.\n\n       More importantly, however, the HOA’s assertion that Mr. Tarr’s\n\nacknowledgement that he receives compensation for operating the group home is\n\nimmaterial to the HOA’s breach claim. To begin with, the term “for profit” does not\n\nappear anywhere in this restriction. And although the second sentence refers to\n\n“income producing property,” this reference prohibits construction of a building (or\n\nportion thereof) on the lot for the purpose of producing income, for example,\n\nbuilding a guest house for rent.5 It does not by its terms prohibit use of the property\n\nto generate income (or even “profit”). Indeed, paragraph 4.2 provides that the\n\nproperty may be used for business or trade under certain conditions (none of which\n\n\n\n\n5\n  Indeed, this portion of paragraph 4.1 addresses the construction of a structure on the lot for the\npurpose of producing income. “No building, outbuilding or portion of either may be built on a Lot\nfor use as income producing property (i.e., for lease to tenants who do not occupy an entire Lot).”\nCR16, ¶4.1. As in Deep East Texas and Permian Basin, this portion of the restriction addresses\nthe architectural structure, not permitted uses; it is intended to prevent the construction of a duplex,\napartment building, or other multi-family structure. Deep East Texas, 877 S.W.2d at 558; Permian\nBasin, 723 S.W.2d at 777.\n\n                                                  25\n\fare alleged to have been violated here). Presumably the HOA does not contend that\n\npermitted businesses under paragraph 4.2 must operate without income or pro bono.\n\n      Moreover, courts routinely hold that the fact that a group home operator\n\nreceives money from the residents does not make the use non-residential. As these\n\ncourts explain:\n\n             the incident necessities of operating a group home such as\n             maintaining records, filing accounting reports, managing,\n             supervising, and providing care for individuals in\n             exchange for monetary compensation are collateral to the\n             prime purpose and function of a family housekeeping unit.\n             Hence, these activities do not, in and of themselves,\n             change the character of a residence from private to\n             commercial.\n\nRhodes, 400 S.E.2d at 485-86; Jackson v.

Dist. Ct. App. 2002).\n\n      Similarly, the HOA’s assertions that the house is an impermissible “duplex”\n\nare unfounded and immaterial.       There is no evidence—much less conclusive\n\nevidence—that the house in question fails to satisfy the architectural requirements\n\nof a “single family” residence. First, contrary to the HOA’s assertions, CR304, Mr.\n\nTarr has not testified that the home is structurally a duplex or that it has ever been\n\nleased and occupied as a duplex. Second, there has been no pleading, evidence, or\n\neven suggestion that the exterior of the home does not comport with the standards\n\nof a single-family residential neighborhood. The photographs of the home do not\n\nreveal anything but a single-family residence. CR370-76. Nor is there conclusive\n\nevidence that the residence has separate entrances or separate apartments. The HOA\n\nhas not submitted any inspection report, evidence of exterior or interior alterations\n\nmade to the home, or any other evidence that the structure of the home has been\n\naltered such that it is no longer a single-family style residence within the meaning\n\nof paragraph 4.1.\n\n      The only mention of “duplex” in the record evidence is in an Internet\n\nadvertisement that offers to lease the home and refers to the accommodations as a\n\nduplex or townhouse. CR372-74. But this is not evidence (and certainly not\n\nconclusive evidence) that the house is actually, structurally a duplex that would\n\n                                         28\n\fviolate the building and architectural restrictions of paragraph 4.1. But even if this\n\nadvertisement could be considered some evidence that the home actually is a duplex,\n\nit certainly is not conclusive. Other advertisements (also appended to the HOA’s\n\napplication)—specifically those for Westlake Recovery Home, the use the home is\n\nnow put to—do not characterize the accommodations as a “duplex.” CR368-71,\n\n376. Rather, these advertisements characterize the home as a single household unit\n\nand describe the management of the home as a group home to facilitate recovery\n\nfrom debilitating alcohol and drug additions. Id. One of the defining characteristics\n\nof a group home is that it provides a communal, family-like household. See, e.g.,\n\nRhodes, 400 S.E.2d at 485-86; Jackson, 714 P.2d at 1022. Thus, at the very least,\n\nthere is a fact issue with respect to the physical structure of the home.\n\n      Indeed, the HOA motion makes clear that the problem it has with Mr. Tarr’s\n\nuse of the home is not its physical structure, but rather, that recovering alcoholics\n\nand drug addicts live there. The HOA’s duplex assertion is that the home is leased\n\nto and occupied by unrelated and separate household units. But here too, there is no\n\nevidence that this is the case. That is, there is no evidence that the house is occupied\n\nas a duplex with independent household units. Indeed, all of the record evidence\n\nsupports the opposite conclusion that it is a group home occupied and operated as a\n\nsingle household unit. Courts routinely hold that a group home is a single household\n\nunit and falls within “single family” residential restrictions. See Hill, 911 P.2d at\n\n                                          29\n\f869 (noting that courts “have consistently held that restrictive covenants mandating\n\nsingle-family residences do not bar group homes in which the occupants live as a\n\nfamily unit”); Rhodes, 400 S.E.2d at 485-86 (explaining that the “prime purpose and\n\nfunction” of group home is “a family housekeeping unit”); Jackson, 714 P.2d at 1022\n\n(“The essential purpose of the group home is to create a normal family atmosphere\n\ndissimilar from that found in traditional institutional care for the mentally\n\nhandicapped.

The interior structure of the house is irrelevant to the protections\n\nprovided by federal law and as incorporated into paragraph 4.1 itself. Simply\n\nlabeling it as a “duplex” is not evidence that the group home is not a residential use\n\nwithin the meaning of paragraph 4.1.\n\n      B.     The trial court erred in granting summary judgment with respect\n             to the affirmative defense that statutory law prohibits enforcement\n             of the deed restriction.\n\n      As discussed above, by stating that statutorily protected uses like group homes\n\nare not excluded from permissible uses under the deed restrictions, the deed\n\nrestrictions assign to the HOA the burden of proving that the accused use of the\n\nproperty is not protected by federal and state law. But even if paragraph 4.1 was\n\nsilent on this point, federal and state law would still prohibit the enforcement of any\n\ndeed restriction that has the effect of excluding group homes like Mr. Tarr’s from\n\nresidential neighborhoods. That is, Mr. Tarr has an affirmative defense that federal\n\nand state law prohibits the use of any restrictive covenant to prohibit his use of the\n\nhouse as a group home for handicapped persons.\n\n      The trial court, however, erroneously granted summary judgment against Mr.\n\nTarr, concluding that there was no evidence that the residents of Westlake Recovery\n\nHouse are handicapped or disabled under the statutes.          Importantly, the only\n\n\n                                          31\n\fargument the HOA made in the trial court that the federal and state law protections\n\nfor group homes did not apply to Mr. Tarr’s group home is that there was no evidence\n\nthat the residents were handicapped under the FHA. CR304. Other than merely\n\nasserting there is no evidence that the residents of Westlake Recovery House are\n\nhandicapped, the HOA did not explain why Mr. Tarr’s affidavit is not some evidence\n\nof handicap. Indeed, the HOA did not reply to Mr. Tarr’s response or raise any\n\nobjection to Mr. Tarr’s affidavit in which he testified that each of the residents meets\n\nthe statutory definitions of “handicap” and “disability.” CR294-95.\n\n       The Fair Housing Act defines “handicap” as:\n\n               (1) a physical or mental impairment which substantially\n               limits one or more of such person’s major life activities,\n               (2) a record of having such impairment, or (3) being\n               regarded as having such an impairment.6\n\n42 U.S.C. § 3602(h). Similarly, the Texas Fair Housing Act defines “Disability” as\n\n“a mental or physical impairment that substantially limits at least one major life\n\nactivity, a record of the impairment, or being regarded as having the impairment.”\n\nTEX. PROP. CODE § 301.003(6).7\n\n\n\n\n6\n The FHA also provides that “handicap” does not include those who are currently and illegally\nusing a controlled substance. 42 U.S.C. § 3602(h). Residents of Westlake Recovery House must\nundergo substance testing to ensure that they are not currently using drugs or alcohol. CR294-95.\n7\n  The American with Disabilities Act defines “disabled” in the same way. 42 U.S.C. § 12102 (“In\norder to establish disabled status under the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) a physical or\nmental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such\nindividual; (2) a record of such an impairment; or (3) being regarded as having such impairment.”).\n\n                                                32\n\f      Alcoholism and drug addiction are “impairments” as a matter of law.

Nor could it; there is clearly sufficient evidence to create a fact issue\n\nregarding whether the residents are impaired. Mr. Tarr testified that they are indeed\n\nrecovering alcoholics and drug addicts. CR294-95. This is some evidence and at\n\nleast creates a genuine issue of fact. Further, the residents themselves testified about\n\ntheir impairments due to alcohol and drug dependence. SCR23-37. Rather, the\n\ncontested issue under the first and second FHA definitions of “handicap” is whether\n\n                                          33\n\fthe residents’ impairments substantially limit them in a major life activity.

Further, the evidence demonstrates that\n\nthere is at least a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the HOA and neighbors\n\nregarded the Westlake Recovery House residents as impaired, qualifying the\n\nresidents under the third statutory definition.\n\n       In reviewing the summary judgment evidence, the Court must review the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to Mr. Tarr, disregarding all contrary evidence\n\nand inferences.

Their “addiction substantially limit[s] their ability to live\n\nindependently or with their families.” Jeffrey O., 511 F. Supp. 2d at 1335.\n\n       This focus on the nature of the group home and the characteristics of the\n\nresidents accepted to live there makes sense considering that the resident population\n\nis not static. As residents progress in their recovery, they will move out of a group\n\nhome, and new residents will take their places. Thus, a finding with respect to a\n\nparticular individual resident may not be relevant once that resident moves out.\n\nThus, the proper focus should be on the nature of the group home.\n\n       In his first affidavit, Mr. Tarr testified that to be admitted to Westlake\n\nRecovery House, an applicant must qualify as having a “handicap” or “disability”\n\n\n8\n Congress left the definition of “major life activities” to the Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment (HUD), the agency responsible for administering the FHA. 42 U.S.C. § 3608.\nHUD’s parameters for interpreting the Act are extremely broad; caring for oneself, eating, walking,\nbreathing, learning, working, seeing, hearing, and performing manual labor are all “major life\nactivities.” 24 C.F.R. § 100.201 (1995); see also Laurie C. Malkin, Troubles at the Doorstep: The\nFair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and Group Homes for Recovering Substance Abusers, 144\nU. PA. L. REV. 757, 827 (1995).\n\n                                               38\n\funder the applicable statutory definitions. CR294-95, ¶¶5-8. Further, Mr. Tarr\n\ntestified that the residents must submit to random substance testing and participate\n\nin in-house and outside recovery meetings. CR294, ¶3. Mr. Tarr also avowed that\n\nWestlake Recovery House provides “a live-in manager, assigned accountability\n\npartners, transportation assistance to outside recovery meetings, and other services\n\nconsistent with the property’s primary purpose as a drug and alcohol recovery group\n\nhome.” CR294, ¶4.\n\n       As discussed above, this is precisely the sort of evidence that courts routinely\n\nhold to be sufficient evidence of impairment that substantially limits a major life\n\nfunction. Here, as in RECAP, admission to the group recovery home requires that\n\nthe applicant have a statutory handicap. CR294-95, ¶¶3-8; RECAP, 294 F.3d at 47-\n\n48 (2d Cir. 2002).\n\n       This is certainly more than a scintilla of probative evidence that the residents\n\nof Westlake Recovery House are handicapped under the statutory definition and,\n\nthus, is sufficient in itself to avoid summary judgment on this issue. Nevertheless,\n\nthe Court can consider additional evidence proffered in response to the second\n\nmotion for partial summary judgment on the HOA’s breach claim. 9 This evidence\n\n\n9\n  Because the first partial summary judgment was interlocutory, the trial court could have\nreconsidered the summary judgment on the affirmative defenses and considered the later-offered\nevidence, including Mr. Tarr’s second affidavit and the affidavits of the Westlake Recovery House\nresidents.

In all, seven\n\nresidents testified by affidavit, each with his own similar, but unique and personal,\n\nstory about how substance abuse had severely impacted his life, and how the\n\nrecovery home has changed that.\n\n             Living in the Westlake Recovery House is critical to my\n             successful recovery from my addiction.

Indeed, the fact that\n\nthe residents are recovering alcoholics and drug addicts is the impetus for the HOA’s\n\nsuit to enjoin Mr. Tarr’s use of his property as a group home for such individuals.\n\n\n                                          42\n\fSee, e.g., CR304 (stating that “there is no dispute that Tarr is violating the\n\nDeclarations as his own pleadings in this case state that ‘Tarr is operating a sober\n\nhouse, group home”); SCR20-21 (relating email from HOA president stating that the\n\nreason for legal action against Mr. Tarr was because he was operating a “halfway\n\nhouse”). “It is well documented that community residents often oppose the opening\n\nof drug rehabilitation programs . . . in their neighborhoods because of fears that drug\n\naddicts will bring increased criminal activity or an unsightly and dangerous element\n\nto the neighborhood.” A Helping Hand, L.L.C. v.

Prior to filing suit, the HOA president, Steve\n\nPortnoy, sent an email to a Lantana homeowner and representatives of the HOA’s\n\nmanagement company stating that\n\n             This has now escalated past the point of what is even\n             remotely acceptable for our neighborhood. A halfway\n             house? This has to be shut down and quickly. Can you\n             please have the HOA attorney contact me about pursuing\n             a more aggressive alternative course of action?\n\nSCR20-21. Here the HOA president clearly demonstrates that the reason the HOA\n\ndoes not want Westlake Recovery House residents living in the neighborhood is\n\nprecisely because the home is a group home for recovering alcoholics and drug\n\naddicts. This is more than a scintilla of probative evidence that the HOA regarded\n\nand discriminated against the residents and, consequently, evidence that the residents\n\nsatisfy the third statutory definition of “handicapped.”\n\n                             *     *      *      *     *\n\n\n\n\n                                         45\n\f      In summary, this Court should hold that the plaintiff HOA failed to\n\ndemonstrate conclusively that Mr. Tarr’s use of the property as a group home for\n\nrecovering alcoholics and drug addicts is not a permitted “residential use” as defined\n\nin the deed restriction, which incorporates statutory prohibitions against interpreting\n\nrestrictive covenants to exclude group homes. As the party asserting that Mr. Tarr\n\nbreached paragraph 4.1, it was the HOA’s burden. Because it failed to conclusively\n\nprove that Mr. Tarr’s use was not a permissible use, the HOA was not entitled to\n\nsummary judgment, and the trial court’s judgment should be reversed and remanded.\n\n      Even if the deed restriction did not incorporate the statutory protections and it\n\nwas Mr. Tarr’s burden to demonstrate that his group home was a permissible and\n\nprotected group home, Mr. Tarr carried this burden by proffering more than a\n\nscintilla of evidence that the residents of Westlake Recovery House meet one or\n\nmore of the statutory definitions of handicap. Thus, the HOA was not entitled to\n\nsummary judgment, and the trial court’s judgment should be reversed and remanded.\n\n      C.     The HOA failed to give Mr. Tarr proper notice of the alleged\n             violations of the deed restrictions.\n\n      Section 12.8 of the deed restrictions requires that the HOA give ten-days’\n\nnotice of an alleged violation of the deed restrictions before taking any action to\n\nenforce the restriction. CR34, ¶12.8. It is undisputed that the HOA failed to give\n\nMr. Tarr proper notice. In response to Mr. Tarr’s summary judgment response on\n\nthis point, the HOA produced a letter proving this point. The letter from the HOA’s\n                                          46\n\fattorney to Mr. Tarr was sent on August 10, 2012. CR474. Yet just four days later,\n\non August 14, 2012, the HOA filed suit and obtained a temporary restraining order\n\nat an ex parte hearing. CR4-50. Texas law is clear; the HOA’s failure to give Mr.\n\nTarr proper notice of the alleged violation prior to bringing suit is fatal to the HOA’s\n\nclaim. See Ashcreek Homeowner’s Ass’n, Inc. v.

The trial court erroneously granted summary judgment on Mr. Tarr’s\n      counterclaims based entirely on its erroneous summary judgment on\n      the affirmative defenses.\n\n      Even though Mr. Tarr’s counterclaims were not at issue in the HOA’s first\n\nmotion for partial summary judgment, the HOA nevertheless argued that the first\n\nsummary judgment on the affirmative defenses should preclude Mr. Tarr’s\n\ncounterclaims. The HOA did not offer any other ground for dismissing Mr. Tarr’s\n\ncounterclaims. This is the entirety of the HOA’s argument on Mr. Tarr’s statutory\n\nclaims:\n\n             Tarr asserts causes of action of the Federal and Texas Fair\n             Housing Act[s], the Texas Housing Act, the Americans\n             with Disabilities Act, and the Federal Rehabilitation Act.\n             Because the Court has already ruled as a matter of law that\n             Tarr is not entitled to said protections and/or said\n             protections are inapplicable, there is no fact issue that\n             exists and, as such, said causes of action (which are\n             nothing more than a repeat of the affirmative defenses\n             should be dismissed as a matter of law.\n\n\n\n\n                                          47\n\fCR301.

Thus, the\n\npropriety of the summary judgment on Mr. Tarr’s statutory counterclaims rises and\n\nfalls with the assertion that the trial court had already properly “ruled as a matter of\n\nlaw” that these statutes did not protect the group home. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c);\n\nScience Spectrum, 941 S.W.2d at 912.           As discussed below, it did not and,\n\nconsequently, the judgment dismissing Mr. Tarr’s counterclaims should be reversed\n\nand remanded.\n\n      A.     Because the first partial summary judgment was in error, it cannot\n             negate Mr. Tarr’s counterclaims.\n\n      The trial court’s first partial summary judgment was based on the mistaken\n\nconclusion that Mr. Tarr had failed to adduce evidence to support the applicability\n\nof these protections. As discussed above, the evidence establishes that there is a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact regarding whether the residents of Westlake Recovery\n\nHouse are handicapped. Thus, there is no basis for granting summary judgment with\n\nrespect to the statutory affirmative defenses, much less Mr. Tarr’s counterclaims.\n\n      B.     Even a valid partial summary judgment on Mr. Tarr’s statutory\n             affirmative defenses would not negate the counterclaims.\n\n      The first partial summary judgment rules only that Mr. Tarr failed to carry his\n\nburden on his affirmative defenses based on the federal and state protections. What\n\nit does not do, and could not do, is affirmatively establish that the residents of\n\n\n                                          48\n\fWestlake Recovery Home are not handicapped or rule that Mr. Tarr presented no\n\nevidence in support of his counterclaims.

Mr. Tarr’s counterclaims were\n\nnot part of the HOA’s first motion for partial summary judgment. Thus, Mr. Tarr\n\nwas not put to his proof on his counterclaims. They were not within the scope of the\n\nmotion. Instead, the HOA chose to limit the scope of its first motion to the\n\naffirmative defenses.\n\n      Further, it is improper procedurally to decide the counterclaims as part of the\n\nfirst partial summary judgment when those counterclaims were not part of the first\n\nmotion. Applying the first partial summary judgment ruling to the counterclaims\n\nimpermissibly retroactively enlarges the scope of The HOA’s first motion for partial\n\nsummary judgment.       This violates Rule 166a(c), which requires a summary\n\njudgment movant to state the grounds in the motion. The HOA’s first motion did\n\nnot purport to address the counterclaims. Further, using the first summary judgment\n\nruling as the affirmative defenses in this manner disregards and circumvents Rule\n\n166a’s notice requirements. Rule 166a(c) provides that a summary judgment\n\nmovant “shall state the specific grounds therefore.” TEX. R. CIV. PROC. 166a(c).\n\nThe first summary judgment did not include the counterclaims and did not give Mr.\n\n\n\n\n                                        49\n\fTarr notice that his counterclaims would be governed by a ruling on affirmative\n\ndefenses.\n\n      Mr. Tarr’s counterclaims should have been evaluated on the evidence before\n\nthe trial court when the motion was considered, not more limited evidence proffered\n\nin response to a different motion on a different part of the case. Mr. Tarr was free\n\nto produce evidence in support of his counterclaims when the HOA challenged them\n\nin its second motion for partial summary judgment. And because the first partial\n\nsummary judgment was interlocutory, the trial court could and should have\n\nconsidered the later-offered evidence, including Mr. Tarr’s second affidavit and the\n\naffidavits of the Westlake Recovery House residents. SCR19-37.

Further, the trial court indicated in its order granting\n\nthe HOA’s second motion for partial summary judgment indicates that it considered\n\nMr. Tarr’s response, which included his second affidavit and the affidavits of the\n\nresidents of Westlake Recovery House. CR496. And there is no unfairness to the\n\n                                          50\n\fHOA in this; the HOA chose to move for summary judgment in a piecemeal fashion.\n\nIf it had intended for the first summary judgment on the affirmative defenses to\n\ngovern Mr. Tarr’s counterclaims, it should have moved on both bases in the first\n\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\n       As discussed in Part I.B above, Mr. Tarr’s affidavit in response to the first\n\nsummary judgment raises a fact issue with respect to whether the residents of his\n\ngroup home are handicapped or disabled within the meaning of the relevant statutes.\n\nAdditionally, in response to the HOA’s second motion for partial summary\n\njudgment, Mr. Tarr submitted the affidavits of seven residents of his group home\n\nsupporting this conclusion. Each explained that group living, particularly in a\n\nresidential setting, is important to his recovery from addiction. Each also testified\n\nas to how their respective drug and/or alcohol addictions have limited, and continue\n\nto substantially limit, major life activities.\n\n       Because there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the residents of\n\nWestlake Recovery House are handicapped, summary judgment on Mr. Tarr’s\n\ncounterclaims was improper and should be reversed.\n\nIII.   The trial court erred in awarding attorney’s fees to the HOA based on a\n       void and unenforceable injunction.\n\n       If the Court concludes that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment\n\non the HOA’s claim that Mr. Tarr’s group home violates the deed restriction, then it\n\nmust also reverse the award of $88,000 in attorney’s fees that is based solely on that\n                                            51\n\fclaim.10 But even if the Court upholds the trial court’s judgment with respect to the\n\nHOA’s breach claim, it must nonetheless reverse the award of $88,000 in attorney’s\n\nfees. Attorney’s fees may be awarded to the prevailing party. But, while facially\n\nsucceeding in the trial court, the HOA did not obtain any meaningful relief effecting\n\na material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties. Rather, it obtained an\n\ninjunction that is void and unenforceable. Thus, the HOA is not a prevailing party\n\nand may not recover attorney’s fees.\n\n       The HOA moved for attorney’s fees under section 5.006 of the Texas Property\n\nCode, which provides: “[i]n an action based on breach of a restrictive covenant\n\npertaining to real property, the court shall allow to a prevailing party who asserted\n\nthe action reasonable attorney’s fees in addition to the party’s costs and claim.” TEX.\n\nPROP. CODE § 5.006(a). The Property Code does not define “prevailing party,” but\n\nTexas courts have looked to federal jurisprudence when construing a contractual\n\n“prevailing party” attorney’s-fees provision that did not define the term, and, as this\n\nCourt has concluded, that analysis is instructive here.

The Texas Supreme Court explained in\n\nIntercontinental that “[w]hether a party prevails turns on whether the party prevails\n\nupon the court to award it something, either monetary or equitable.” And like the\n\nplaintiff in that case, the HOA “got nothing except a jury finding that [Mr. Tarr\n\n                                          56\n\fbreached the deed restrictions or failed to carry a summary judgment burden]. It\n\nrecovered no damages; it secured no declaratory or injunctive relief; it obtained no\n\nconsent decree or settlement in its favor; it received nothing of value of any kind,\n\ncertainly none of the relief sought in its petition.” Intercontinental, 295 S.W.3d at\n\n655. Thus, the attorney’s fees award must be reversed.\n\n                         CONCLUSION AND PRAYER\n\n       Appellant Mr. Tarr prays that the Court reverse the trial court’s judgment and\n\nremand for trial on both the HOA’s breach claim and Appellant’s counterclaims.\n\nAppellant further prays that the Court vacate the injunction and award of attorney’s\n\nfees. Appellant also prays for such other and further relief to which he may be justly\n\nentitled.\n\n\n\n                                       Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                       /s/ Matthew Ploeger\n                                       Matthew Ploeger\n                                       State Bar No. 24032838\n                                       LAW OFFICE OF MATTHEW PLOEGER\n                                       901 S.

Lantana and Tarr further agree that thirty five thousand dollars ($35,000.00) are\n\n          reasonable and necessary fees to be paid to Lantana should Tarr file an unsuccessful appeal of\n\n          this cause to the Texas Court of Appeals.       This agreed amount, however, is the maximum\n\n          amount to be paid by Tarr to Lantana in the event of said appeal and all amounts due and payable\n\n          must have been incurred by or on behalf of Lantana.\n\n                 No part of this Final Modified Judgment or the prior orders of this Court are agreed to by\n\n          Tarr except the amount of reasonable and necessary attorneys fees set forth above, and Tarr\n\n          reserves his right to appeal from every other ruling in this Judgment and those prior orders.\n\n                 Based on the prior orders of this Court and the parties' agreement concerning reasonable\n\n          and necessary attorney's fees it is:\n\n                  ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the Plaintiff Lantana shall have\n\n          judgment from and against the Defendant Tarr as follows:\n\n                                  1.

Kevin Tarr\n                     I\n   Dear counr l,\n\n          On July 21 , 2014, the Court considered and took under advisement Plaintiff's Motion for\n   Final Sumrhary Judgment in the above-referenced cause. After considering the motion, the\n   response, tle reply, the admissible summary judgment evidence, and the applicable law, the\n   Court will lnd as fo llows.\n\n           The Court has signed the Order Partially Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Final Summary\n   Judgment, r hich the parties have approved as to form , addressing the permanent injunction.\n   Regarding Ji>laintiffs remaining claim for attorney's fees , the Court will find that it is a fact issue\n   as to the arhount of reasonable and necessary fees , but that Plainti ff may recover the attorney's\n   fees for pr~vai ling against defenses asserted to its primary claim. The parties also disagree on\n   whether the attorney's fees must be segregated. The Court does not decide which fees, if any,\n   must be se~regated , but provides the following guidance after considering the app licable Texas\n   law on this - ssue.\n                    1\n           The question of whether segregation is required in a particular case is a legal inquiry,\n   subject to ~e novo review. See Transcon. Realty Investors, Inc. v. McGuire, Craddock, Strother\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                619\n\fCause No. D-I·Gr -12-002467 :\nIn the 98'h Judici j l Distri ct Court of Trav is Co., Tx.\nLantana Southwer;t Home01rners Ass ·n In c. v.

When\naffirmative ld efenses are asserted to a claim for which attorney's fees can be recovered, Texas\ncourts will rot automatically allow the opposing party to suggest to the jury that overcoming\nthose defen es was unnecessary or required to be segregated.

Transcon. Realty Investors, Inc. at *13 .\nOften the f~es associated with affirmative defenses can be recovered as part of the main claim.\nThe same 9rinciples can even apply in particular cases regarding the prevailing party having to\novercome cpunterclaims, when the counterclaim is in essence a defense to the claim.

However, the Court that\noversees thbI trial on the remaining merits (the reasonable and necessary attorney ' s fees) is in the\nbest position to make specific rulings on disputes regarding segregation.\n\n                                                             Sincerely,\n\n\n\n\n                                                             Gisela D.
