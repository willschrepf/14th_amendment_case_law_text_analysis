We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>Background</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDeborah and appellee Max Lindley Burgess were married on April 6, 1991.  No\r\nchildren were born or adopted during the marriage.  In January of 2005, Max filed for\r\ndivorce.  Max cited as grounds for divorce both cruelty and insupportability due to discord\r\nor conflict of personalities.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt the bench trial, Max testified that he owned a home in Harris County before he\r\nmarried Deborah.  Max still owed $4700 on the mortgage when he and Deborah married, and\r\nhe paid the $4700 in monthly installments of $57 using funds from his paycheck.<sup> (1)</sup>  While\r\nMax and Deborah were living in the Harris County home, the home flooded, and Max\r\nreceived $56,000 from his flood insurance company.  When Max subsequently sold the\r\nHarris County home, he received $81,602, which he then paid toward the purchase of a new\r\nhome in Willis.  Max testified that he also applied $36,000 of the flood insurance settlement\r\ntoward the purchase of the Willis home.  In addition, Max borrowed $18,000 from his 401(k)\r\nplan to purchase the lot for the Willis home.  Max testified that he built a $21,900 detached\r\ngarage at the marital residence using a $15,000 loan from his mother.  According to Max, he\r\nalso received $48,000 as a gift from his mother, and he used that money for the Willis house\r\nand its garage.  Max testified that although the $48,000 was a gift, he made a few payments\r\nto his mother for the money.  However, during cross-examination, Max characterized the\r\n$48,000 as a loan, and he explained that his mother subsequently forgave the debt.  Max\r\ntestified that he advanced a total of $142,458 of his separate funds toward the construction\r\nof the Willis house.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMax testified that the marriage had become insupportable because of discord or\r\nconflicts of personalities, reconciliation was impossible, and Deborah had been cruel to him. \r\nMax opined that he should receive the house because of Deborah's cruelty to him. \r\nAccording to Max, the marriage was only enjoyable for three to four years, and he testified\r\nthat Deborah \"quit being a wife to me.\"  Max explained that Deborah did not sleep in the\r\nbedroom with him because she had to stay up late to check on her daughter Heather, who\r\nworked \"at the bars and she didn't get off 'til 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.  She talked to\r\nHeather all the way home so she wouldn't fall asleep.\"  Max testified that he and Deborah\r\nhad not been sexually intimate for eight to nine years, and although this was a problem for\r\nhim, she refused to attend counseling.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter Max married Deborah, he learned she had credit card debt that she was unable\r\nto pay.   However, Deborah did not tell him how much she owed.  Max testified that Deborah\r\nsought assistance from Consumer Credit Counseling Services (\"CCCS\"), and Max\r\ncontributed $20,000 from his pre-marriage savings toward her debt reduction program.  Max\r\nand Deborah also filed a petition for bankruptcy, and that proceeding concluded on February\r\n12, 2004.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMax testified that he \"barely made it through school\" because he \"couldn't read and\r\ncomprehend too good.\"  Max explained that when he received his paychecks, he gave them\r\nto Deborah, and \"[s]he would sign my name to . . . my check and take it to the bank.\"  Max\r\nexplained that he and Deborah usually deposited seven to eight hundred dollars from each\r\nof his biweekly paychecks into the savings account.  Max also testified that Deborah wrote\r\nthe deposits on the back of the checkbook when she went to the bank, but Max generally did\r\nnot see their bank statements despite asking Deborah for them.  Max testified that he and\r\nDeborah often fought when he saw the bank statements because \"she had stuff that was done\r\nwrong and she did not want me to see them.\"  According to Max, his disagreements with\r\nDeborah usually pertained to Deborah's credit card debt or to Heather.  Max explained that\r\nDeborah \"was taking a lot of money from me to take care of Heather.\"  Max testified, \"I\r\nwould think it was going to get better after '95, the first time, credit cards.  I loved her and\r\nI cried about it, and I told her, her and Heather both, . . . 'Don't ever do this to me again.' \r\nShe said, 'I won't.'  It didn't last two or three years; it started again.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn 2003, Max learned that Deborah was again having financial problems because he\r\nbegan receiving phone calls from creditors, and he tried unsuccessfully to make a small\r\npurchase using his debit card.  Max explained that when he attempted to make the purchase,\r\nhe believed he had $53,500 in his savings account because Deborah had written that amount\r\non a card.  When Max asked Deborah whether they had any money in the bank, she said,\r\n\"No.\"  Max testified that Deborah \"cooked the books the whole time we was married.\"  Max\r\nfurther explained that Deborah hid the mail before he got home, thereby preventing him from\r\nseeing the bank statements.  Max also testified that Deborah kept some of the bedrooms in\r\ntheir home locked with a padlock and \"a key that she hid.  I couldn't even go into my\r\nbedrooms. . . .  She had stuff hidden in there.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAccording to Max, Deborah withdrew $5,000 from his 401(k) plan without his\r\npermission.  Max also testified that he started an IRA in 1983 with $2,000, and the IRA is\r\npresently worth only $1,000 because Deborah made withdrawals from it without his consent.\r\nMax explained that he is sixty-two years old, and although he was eligible to retire at age\r\nfifty-five, he did not do so because Deborah twice ruined his credit during their marriage, and\r\nhe had no money.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMax  testified that when Deborah left, she took his truck and his paycheck with her,\r\nand he learned that their bank account only contained one hundred dollars.  After Deborah\r\nleft, Max's mother loaned him money to purchase another truck, and he bought a 2002\r\nChevrolet Silverado.  Max testified that he had been trying to convince Deborah to find a job\r\nbecause, \"[a]fter the bankruptcy, I was down to my last nickel.  I had no money.  My credit\r\nwas gone, all on account of her.\"  According to Max, after Deborah left, she called him and\r\nsaid \"she'd lied to me for a long time, and she said she'd never lie to me again.\"  Max\r\ntestified that he was shocked when Deborah left, and he had \"[n]o money, no credit, no\r\nautomobile.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMax's mother, Nell, testified that she loaned Max and Deborah $15,000 because Max\r\n\"wanted a nice house and I thought I would loan that to him to help him out.\"  Nell testified\r\nthat she gave the remainder of the money to Max as a gift.<sup> (2)</sup>  Nell testified that part of the\r\nfunds Max and Deborah used to build the garage for their home came from her.  Nell\r\nexplained that Max and Deborah made payments to her only on the $15,000 promissory note. \r\nAfter Deborah left Max, Nell loaned Max $10,000 to purchase a truck.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMax's son, Jason, testified that he had a good relationship with his father at the time\r\nof Max's marriage to Deborah, but the relationship began to deteriorate after a couple of\r\nyears.  Jason explained that Deborah \"basically would tell me bad things . . . about my\r\nfather.\"  He testified that Deborah would \"[j]ust tell me that he really didn't like me, didn't\r\ncare for me too much, and just said that I wasn't his son, and all these horrible things.\"\r\nAccording to Jason, Max \"said that wasn't true; he never said anything like that.\"  Jason\r\nfurther explained that Deborah \"would tell me horrible things about him, and she would tell\r\nhim horrible things about me.  And she just basically made it to where we didn't want to be\r\naround each other.\"  Jason testified that he and his father did not speak until two weeks after\r\nDeborah left Max.  According to Jason, Deborah told him approximately two years before\r\nshe left his father that she planned to seek a divorce.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAccording to Jason, Deborah spent $15,000 purchasing furniture for Heather's\r\napartment with Max's credit card.  Jason also testified that Heather \"was  a  bad  driver  and \r\nwrecked  her  car  a  lot,  so  they  would  have  to  help  her  out financially. . . .\"  Jason\r\nfurther explained that Heather had lost two jobs \"for drugs and stuff like that.  And they\r\nbasically had to bail her out and help her pay her rent when she lost her jobs.\"  Jason testified\r\nthat he observed Heather's drug problem \"with my own eyes.\"  Jason also testified that\r\nHeather had in her possession credit cards and ATM cards that belonged to Max and\r\nDeborah.  According to Jason, Deborah told him she gave the cards to Heather \"because she\r\ncouldn't leave at certain times, in order to get money.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJason's wife, Stacey, testified that Deborah tried to interfere with the relationship\r\nbetween Jason and Max.  According to Stacey, she only heard negative things about Max\r\nfrom Debbie and Heather, and Deborah told her and Jason that Max \"didn't really like us\r\nwhen we came around[.]\"  Stacey testified that Deborah also \"said that Max didn't think\r\nJason was his real son.\"  Stacey explained that Deborah also told her that Max had no interest\r\nin his grandchild and did not want to see her.  Stacey testified that she now believes the\r\nthings Deborah said were not true.  Stacey testified that Max became upset because \"[h]e had\r\nfound financial statements when [Deborah and Heather] had gone to the bank to make a loan. \r\nFinancial loans had come about and credit card debt that he didn't know about.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDeborah Burgess testified that when she married Max, she moved into the Harris\r\nCounty home, and she estimated that the home was worth approximately $30,000 in 1991.\r\nDeborah testified that the value of the house was $90,000 when she and Max moved out in\r\n2003.  According to Deborah, she and Max made payments on the mortgage owed on the\r\nHarris County home.  Deborah and Max paid off the mortgage on that home in 1998, and she\r\nand Max continued to reside there until 2003.  According to Deborah, the Harris County\r\nhome flooded while she and Max were residing there.  Most of their furniture was destroyed,\r\nand Deborah testified that they had to replace it.  Deborah denied that most of the items in\r\nthe house had belonged to Max before their marriage.  Deborah testified that she and Max\r\nreceived a check for $56,000 from the flood insurance company, and they deposited the\r\nmoney into Max's savings account.  Deborah denied withdrawing any of the $56,000 from\r\nthe savings account.  Deborah testified that of the $56,000 settlement from their flood\r\ninsurance, she and Max spent $20,000 repairing the Harris County home and put the\r\nremaining $36,000 into their community savings account.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDeborah testified that she and Max signed a promissory note to Nell, in which they\r\nagreed to repay Nell $15,000.  Deborah explained that she and Max also received $48,000\r\nfrom Nell, but she and Max did not sign a promissory note for that money.  Deborah testified\r\nthat the $48,000 from Nell was a gift \"[f]or us, for Max, for the garage.\"  Deborah also\r\ntestified that the $18,000 for the purchase of the lot in Willis came from Max's 401(k) plan,\r\nand Max repaid the money with funds from his paychecks.<sup> (3)</sup>  According to Deborah, the\r\n$21,900 she and Max used to build the garage at the Willis house came from Nell.  Deborah\r\nfurther testified that the $81,602 Max received from the Harris County home went toward\r\nthe purchase of the residence in Willis.  Deborah explained that she and Max sold the Harris\r\nCounty home in April of 2003, and they also purchased the property in Willis during the\r\nsame month.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDeborah denied having debt and financial problems prior to the marriage, but she\r\nadmitted that she and Max consulted CCCS about setting up a repayment plan.  Deborah\r\ntestified that she did not owe the debts prior to the marriage.  Deborah explained that\r\nalthough she received $18,000 from the sale of her hair salon, she had financial trouble due\r\nto rent increases and \"[f]rom having to take off so much\" for vacations with Max.  Deborah\r\ntestified that she put the $18,000 into their joint savings account.  Deborah testified that when\r\nshe and Max married, she had no debt.  Deborah denied that Max contributed any money\r\nfrom his separate property savings toward the CCCS debt reduction plan.  Rather, Deborah\r\naccepted another job and repaid the CCCS herself.  Deborah also denied making withdrawals\r\nfrom Max's IRA.  According to Deborah, she and Max did not have financial difficulties\r\nuntil \"the very end\" of the marriage.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDeborah testified that she and Max filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in early 2004. \r\nDeborah denied knowledge of precisely who incurred the credit card debt reflected in their\r\nbankruptcy schedules.  Deborah denied that she was the one who incurred most of the credit\r\ncard charges, which totaled $125,595, and she testified that Max knew about most of the\r\ncharges that were made.  Deborah admitted that she currently owes $6,054 on a credit card\r\nthat she obtained since the bankruptcy, and she has received calls from collectors regarding\r\nthe debt.  When asked whether she always discussed it with Max before applying for credit\r\ncards, she testified, \"I don't know.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAccording to Deborah, Max gave his paychecks to her, and she paid the bills and\r\nmade some of the ATM withdrawals.  Deborah denied giving Heather her credit cards and\r\nATM card.  Deborah admitted that she purchased furniture for Heather, but she denied\r\npaying for Heather's car repairs, apartment rent, or drug rehabilitation.  Deborah testified that\r\nHeather does not have a drug problem.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDeborah testified that she and Max paid the flood insurance premiums on the Harris\r\nCounty home from their joint checking account.  Deborah also explained that the funds she\r\nand Max received from the sale of the Harris County home \"went directly to pay for the\r\ndown payment on the new house. . . .\"  Deborah testified that she and Max moved into the\r\nWillis house in March of 2003.  Deborah testified that Max also owns the home in which\r\nNell resides because Nell deeded the home to Max to prevent her daughter from inheriting\r\nit.  However, she also testified that she and Max did not pay taxes or insurance on the home. \r\n\tDeborah denied taking any furniture or fixtures with her when she left Max. \r\nHowever, she testified that she took a 1999 Chevrolet Silverado.  Deborah testified that she\r\nwas unable to meet her necessary monthly living expenses based upon her income, and she\r\nrequested that the court award her spousal support.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the divorce decree, the trial court granted Max a divorce from Deborah on the\r\nground of cruelty, and he awarded Max the Willis home; all household furniture, furnishings,\r\nfixtures, goods, art objects, collectibles, appliances, and equipment in Max's possession or\r\nsubject to his sole control; all clothing, jewelry, and other personal effects in Max's\r\npossession or subject to his sole control; all sums of cash in Max's possession or subject to\r\nhis sole control; and all sums in any retirement plan, 401(k) plan, or employee savings plan;\r\nall insurance policies on Max's life; the 2002 Chevrolet Silverado; and a 1999 motor boat. \r\nThe trial court awarded Deborah all household furniture, furnishings, fixtures, goods, art\r\nobjects, collectibles, appliances, and equipment in her possession or subject to her sole\r\ncontrol; all clothing, jewelry, and other personal effects in her possession or subject to her\r\nsole control; all sums of cash in her possession or subject to her sole control; and the 1999\r\nChevrolet Silverado.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWith respect to the parties' debts, the trial court ordered Max to indemnify Deborah\r\nand hold her harmless for the $54,200 balance due on the marital residence; all unsecured\r\ndebts, charges, liabilities, and obligations in Max's name; any debts, charges, liabilities, and\r\nother obligations incurred solely by Max after the parties separated; and all taxes due or to\r\nbecome due on the real and personal property awarded to Max.  The trial court ordered\r\nDeborah to pay any and all debts incurred solely by her after the parties separated or standing\r\nin her name and all encumbrances, taxes, assessments, or other charges due or to become due\r\non the real and personal property awarded to Deborah.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial court also awarded Max \"for economic contribution of [Max's] separate\r\nestate to the community estate[;]\" $76,000 in equity from Max's former separate property\r\nresidence; $36,000 from insurance proceeds covering Max's former separate residence; and\r\n$48,000 \"in personal gifts of funds to [Max] from his mother.\"  The trial court further found\r\nthat \"the community estate is entitled to reimbursement from [Deborah's] separate estate for\r\nfunds expended to discharge all or part of an unsecured liability of [Deborah's] separate\r\nestate and that Max . . . is entitled to a judgment of $15,000.\"  The court decreed that \"liens\r\nfor economic contribution and for reimbursement shall be and are satisfied by the award of\r\n[Deborah's] interest in the community estate to [Max] to the extent the community estate is\r\nnot specifically awarded herein to [Deborah].\"  The trial court also entered findings of fact\r\nand conclusions of law, as discussed more fully herein.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>Standards of Review</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe review the trial court's findings of fact under the same legal standards applied to\r\nsufficiency reviews of jury verdicts.  <em>Ortiz v. Jones</em>, 917 S.W.2d 770, 772 (Tex. 1996).  In\r\nconsidering whether the evidence is legally sufficient, we consider only the evidence and\r\ninferences tending to support the trial court's finding and disregard all evidence to the\r\ncontrary.  <em>Anderson v. City of Seven Points</em>, 806 S.W.2d 791, 794-95 (Tex. 1991).  We must\r\nconsider the evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court's findings and indulge\r\nevery reasonable inference that would support them.  <em>See City of Keller v. Wilson</em>, 168\r\nS.W.3d 802, 822 (Tex. 2005).  We must credit favorable evidence if a reasonable trier of fact\r\ncould and disregard contrary evidence unless a reasonable trier of fact could not.  <em>Id</em>. at 827. \r\nHowever, we must not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court as long as the\r\nevidence falls within the zone of reasonable disagreement.  <em>Id</em>. at 822.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn reviewing the factual sufficiency of the evidence, we must weigh all of the\r\nevidence in the record.  <em>Ortiz</em>, 917 S.W.2d at 772.  We may overturn the trial court's findings\r\nonly if they are so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to be clearly\r\nwrong and unjust.  <em>Id</em>.  Findings of fact have the same force and dignity as a jury verdict. \r\n<em>McGalliard v. Kuhlmann</em>, 722 S.W.2d 694, 696 (Tex. 1986).  However, when, as here, a\r\ncomplete reporter's record appears in the appellate record, findings of fact are not conclusive\r\non appeal if the contrary is established as a matter of law, or if there is no evidence to support\r\nthe findings.  <em>Material P'ships, Inc. v. Ventura</em>, 102 S.W.3d 252, 257 (Tex. App.--Houston\r\n[14th Dist.] 2003, pet. denied); <em>see</em> <em>also Tucker v. Tucker</em>, 908 S.W.2d 530, 532 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 1995, writ denied).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe review the trial court's conclusions of law de novo, and the standard of review is\r\nwhether they are correct.  <em>Material P'ships</em>, 102 S.W.3d at 257.  We will uphold conclusions\r\nof law on appeal if the judgment can be sustained on any legal theory supported by the\r\nevidence.  <em>Id</em>.  We review the trial court's decision regarding the grounds for divorce under\r\nan abuse of discretion standard.  <em>Gonzalez v. Gonzalez</em>, 383 S.W.2d 64, 65 (Tex. Civ. App.--San Antonio 1964, no writ).  We also review the trial court's property division for abuse of\r\ndiscretion.  <em>Murff v. Murff</em>, 615 S.W.2d 696, 698 (Tex. 1981).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>Issue One</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn her first issue, Deborah argues the trial court erred in characterizing community\r\nproperty as Max's separate property.  Specifically, Deborah complains that the trial court\r\nerred in characterizing the following property as Max's separate property: (1) $15,000 paid\r\nby Max toward Deborah's separate credit card debt; (2) $36,000 from casualty insurance\r\nproceeds received when Max's separate property homestead flooded; and (3) $48,000\r\nadvanced to Max by his mother.<sup> (4)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAll property possessed by either spouse during marriage or upon dissolution of\r\nmarriage is presumed to be community property.  Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 3.003(a) (Vernon\r\n2006).  The community-property presumption may be rebutted by using the inception-of-title\r\nrule, which provides that property's character is determined by the time and manner in which\r\na person first acquires an ownership interest in it.  <em>See Jensen v. Jensen</em>, 665 S.W.2d 107, 109\r\n(Tex. 1984); <em>Zagorski v. Zagorski</em>, 116 S.W.3d 309, 316 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.]\r\n2003, pet. denied).  Once property's character is established under the inception-of-title rule,\r\nits character does not change merely because its form mutates.  <em>Chapman v. Allen</em>, 15 Tex.\r\n278, 284 (1855).  Property owned before marriage, inherited property, and property received\r\nas  a  gift  is  separate  property.   Tex.  Const.  art.  XVI,  §  15;  Tex.  Fam.  Code  Ann.\r\n§ 3.001(1), (2); Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 3.002 (Vernon 2006).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA spouse who claims that property is separate must present clear and convincing\r\nevidence of the property's separate character.  Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 3.003(b) (Vernon\r\n2006).  When separate and community property that are similar in nature have been\r\ncommingled, a spouse must use tracing to identify and segregate the portion of the property\r\nthat is separate.  <em>See Zagorski</em>, 116 S.W.3d at 319-20 (Tracing is required to establish the\r\ncharacter of separate funds contained in a bank account containing commingled funds.).  A\r\nspouse is competent to testify about the character of his property; however, his testimony\r\nusually must be corroborated by other testimonial or documentary evidence to rebut the\r\ncommunity-property presumption.  <em>See Bahr v. Kohr</em>, 980 S.W.2d 723, 730 (Tex. App.--San\r\nAntonio 1998, no pet.); <em>Robles v. Robles</em>, 965 S.W.2d 605, 620 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st\r\nDist.] 1998, pet. denied).  A spouse's uncorroborated testimony that is contradicted \"may not\r\nmeet the clear and convincing standard.\"  <em>Pace v. Pace</em>, 160 S.W.3d 706, 714 (Tex. App.--Dallas 2005, pet. denied).  A spouse's uncorroborated and uncontradicted testimony is\r\nsufficient to constitute clear and convincing evidence.  <em>See id</em>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWith respect to the $15,000, Max testified that he paid $20,000 of Deborah's separate\r\nproperty credit card debt using funds he owned before marriage.  However, Deborah testified\r\nthat she did not owe any debt prior to the marriage.  Although Deborah admitted that she and\r\nMax consulted CCCS, she denied that Max contributed any money from his separate property\r\nsavings toward the debt reduction plan.  Deborah testified that she accepted another job and\r\nrepaid CCCS herself.  In finding of fact 10, the trial court found that the \"separate estate of\r\nMax Lindley Burgess paid $15,000 toward the unsecured liabilities of the separate estate of\r\nDeborah Kay Burgess.\"  In conclusion of law 25, the trial court determined that Max proved\r\nby clear and convincing evidence that his separate estate was entitled to reimbursement in\r\nthe amount of $15,000.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMax bore the burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that the\r\n$15,000 he used to pay Deborah's debt was his separate property.   Tex. Fam. Code Ann. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>§ 3.003(b).  Max testified that he paid $20,000 from his savings account using funds that he\r\nhad acquired prior to the marriage.  However, Max did not testify regarding the balance of\r\nthe savings account prior to the marriage, nor did he provide the date or an approximate time\r\nframe as to when he paid Deborah's credit card debt.  Furthermore, Max testified that he and\r\nDeborah deposited community funds into the account during their marriage, yet he offered\r\nno evidence tracing the funds in the savings account.  <em>See Zagorski,</em> 116 S.W.3d at 319-20. \r\nAlthough Max offered some evidence that he paid Deborah's pre-marriage credit card debt\r\nusing $20,000 of his separate property funds, Max did not demonstrate the separate character\r\nof the funds by clear and convincing evidence.<sup> (5)</sup>  <em>See</em> Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 3.003(b). \r\nBecause Max did not demonstrate the separate character of the funds by clear and convincing\r\nevidence, we find that the evidence is factually insufficient to support the trial court's\r\nfinding.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWith respect to the $36,000 of casualty insurance proceeds Max received when his\r\nseparate residence flooded, the parties both testified that the residence belonged to Max prior\r\nto their marriage.  Therefore, the evidence was legally and factually sufficient to demonstrate\r\nthat the residence was Max's separate property.  <em>See</em> Tex. Const. art. XVI, § 15; Tex. Fam.\r\nCode Ann. § 3.001(1), (2); Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 3.002.  We now turn to the question of\r\nwhether the insurance proceeds received when the residence flooded constitute community\r\nproperty or separate property.  The proceeds of a casualty insurance policy take their\r\ncharacter from the property that is insured.  Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 3.008(a) (Vernon 2006);\r\n<em>see McIntire v. McIntire</em>, 702 S.W.2d 284, 288 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1985, writ\r\nref'd n.r.e.).  Hence, the proceeds of a policy insuring separate property are separate property,\r\nwhile the proceeds of a policy insuring community property are community property.  Tex.\r\nFam. Code Ann. § 3.008(a).  If a policy insures both community and separate property, the\r\nproceeds of the policy will be apportioned between the community and separate estates.  <em>See</em>\r\n<em>First Nat'l Bank in Houston v. Finn</em>, 132 S.W.2d 151, 153 (Tex. Civ. App.--Galveston 1939,\r\nwrit dism'd).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHere, Max testified that he received a settlement totaling $56,000 from the flood\r\ninsurance company, and that the settlement covered both structural damage to the home and\r\npersonal property damage.  The parties lived in the residence as husband and wife for at least\r\nthirteen years.  Max offered no evidence regarding whether the items of personal property\r\nin the home were community property, his separate property, or Deborah's separate property,\r\nnor did he testify as to the value of any of the property.  Max had the burden to prove by clear\r\nand convincing evidence that the remaining $36,000 of insurance proceeds for which he\r\nsought contribution represented compensation for the loss of his separate property.  <em>See</em> Tex.\r\nFam. Code Ann. § 3.003(b).  We find that the evidence is factually insufficient to support\r\nthe trial court's finding. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span> \tDeborah also argues in issue one that the trial court erred in characterizing $48,000 \r\nadvanced to Max by Nell as Max's separate property.  In finding of fact 13, subsection (iii),\r\nthe trial court found that Max was entitled to economic contribution for the $48,000 in funds\r\n\"received exclusively by him as gifts from his mother.\"  Implicit in the trial court's finding\r\nthat the $48,000 was a gift from Nell is a determination that the $48,000 is separate property. \r\n<em>See</em> Tex. Const. art. XVI, § 15; Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 3.001(1), (2); Tex. Fam. Code\r\nAnn. § 3.002 (Property acquired by gift is separate property.).  Nell testified unequivocally\r\nthat with the exception of a $15,000 loan, the money she advanced to Max was a gift to him. \r\nDeborah testified that the $48,000 was a gift \"[f]or us, for Max. . . .\"  Max's testimony\r\nregarding whether the $48,000 was a gift or a loan was unclear, equivocal, and sometimes\r\ncontradictory.  When asked whether he considered the $48,000 a gift or a loan, Max initially\r\ntestified, \"I guess a gift.\"  However, Max equivocated during both the remainder of his direct\r\nexamination and cross-examination regarding whether he believed the $48,000 from Nell\r\nwas a gift or a loan.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA gift is a transfer of property made voluntarily and gratuitously, without\r\nconsideration.  <em>Hilley v. Hilley</em>, 161 Tex. 569, 342 S.W.2d 565, 569 (Tex. 1961); <em>Ellebracht\r\nv. Ellebracht</em>, 735 S.W.2d 658, 659 (Tex. App.--Austin 1987, no writ).  \"Three elements are\r\nnecessary to establish the existence of a gift: (1) intent to make a gift; (2) delivery of the\r\nproperty; and (3) acceptance of the property.\"  <em>Hayes v. Rinehart</em>, 65 S.W.3d 286, 289 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Eastland 2001, no pet.).  The intent of the donor is the principal issue in determining\r\nwhether a transfer constitutes a gift.  <em>Id</em>.  Here, Nell clearly testified that she intended the\r\nfunds as a gift.  Although Max's testimony was at best equivocal as to whether he viewed \r\nthe $48,000 as a gift or a loan, the evidence clearly and convincingly demonstrated Nell's\r\ndonative intent and delivery, as well as Max's acceptance of the funds.  <em>See Hayes</em>, 65\r\nS.W.3d at 289.  The evidence is factually sufficient to support the trial court's finding that\r\nthe $48,000 constituted a gift to Max.  We sustain issue one in part and overrule it in part.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>Issue Two</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn her second issue, Deborah contends the trial court erred in awarding Max's claims\r\nfor reimbursement and economic contribution.  Specifically, Deborah asserts the trial court\r\nerred in awarding Max $15,000 reimbursement for paying Deborah's separate credit card\r\ndebt, as well as contribution for $76,000 from the sale of his separate property residence,\r\n$36,000 from insurance flood insurance proceeds after Max's separate property residence\r\nflooded, and $48,000 advanced to Max by his mother.  With respect to the trial court's\r\nfinding that Max advanced $15,000 of his separate property funds to repay Deborah's\r\nseparate estate, thereby giving rise to a claim for reimbursement, we have found that the\r\nevidence was insufficient to support Max's contention that the $15,000 was his separate\r\nproperty.  Therefore, Max's claim for reimbursement of those funds necessarily fails. \r\nFurthermore, we have found that the evidence was insufficient to support Max's claim that\r\nthe entire $36,000 of casualty insurance proceeds constituted his separate property.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe now turn to the trial court's awards of $48,000 and $76,000 in contribution claims\r\nto Max for the gift from Nell and the proceeds of the sale of his separate property residence. \r\nTo uphold the trial court's findings that Max contributed $48,000 and $76,000 to the\r\ncommunity estate from the gift and from the sale of his separate property, we must find that\r\nthey   are   supported   by   clear   and   convincing   evidence.  <em> See</em>   Tex.   Fam.   Code  \r\nAnn. §§ 3.003(b), 3.403 (Vernon 2006).  Both Max and Deborah testified that Max received\r\n$81,602 when he sold his separate residence.  Deborah testified that all of those proceeds\r\nwent toward the purchase of the community residence in Willis.  The parties both testified\r\nthat the $48,000 from Nell was used to build a garage and make other improvements to the\r\nWillis residence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDeborah apparently does not dispute that the Harris County residence was Max's\r\nseparate property, that Max put at least $76,000 of the proceeds from the sale of the residence\r\ntoward the purchase of the community residence in Willis, or that Max put the gift from Nell\r\ntoward the Willis residence.  Rather, Deborah seems to argue that the trial court erred by not\r\ntaking into consideration the community funds that were paid toward the mortgage and\r\nimprovements to the Harris County residence.  Max did testify that for seven years of the\r\nmarriage, he paid the mortgage on his separate property residence using community funds. \r\nDeborah testified that she and Max used community funds to make numerous improvements\r\nto the residence before selling it in 2003.  Deborah's argument that the trial court erred by\r\nfailing to consider the community estate's investment in Max's separate property amounts\r\nto a claim for contribution or reimbursement, and she did not raise such a claim in the trial\r\ncourt.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a).  We find the evidence clearly and convincingly showed\r\nthat Max put at least $76,000 of his separate property toward the marital residence.  We have\r\nalso found that the evidence clearly and convincingly demonstrated that Max received\r\n$48,000 as a gift from Nell.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial court stated that in calculating the amount of Max's contribution claims, it\r\napplied the statutory formula, which provides as follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(a)  A marital estate that makes an economic contribution to property owned\r\nby another marital estate has a claim for economic contribution with respect\r\nto the benefited estate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t(b)  The amount of the claim under this section is equal to the product of:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t(1)  the equity in the benefited property on the date of the dissolution\r\nof the marriage . . . multiplied by </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t(2)  a fraction of which:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t(A)  the numerator is the economic contribution to the property\r\nowned by the benefited marital estate by the contributing marital estate;\r\nand</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t(B)  the denominator is an amount equal to the sum of:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t(I)  the economic contribution to the property owned by\r\nthe benefited marital estate by the contributing marital\r\nestate; and</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t(ii)  the contribution by the benefited estate to the equity\r\nin the property owned by the benefited estate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t(b-1)  The amount of the contribution by the benefited marital estate under\r\nSubsection (b)(2)(b)(ii) is measured by determining:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t(1)  if the benefited estate is the community property estate:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t(A)  the net equity of the community property estate in the\r\nproperty owned by the community property estate as of the date of the\r\nfirst economic contribution to that property by the contributing separate\r\nproperty estate; and</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t(B)  any additional economic contribution to the equity in the\r\nproperty owned by the community property estate made by the\r\nbenefited community property estate after the date described by\r\nSubdivision (A). . . . </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 3.403(a), (b), (b-1) (Vernon 2006).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMax estimated that the Willis home is currently worth approximately $215,000. \r\nDeborah testified that including the improvements she and Max made to the home, she\r\nbelieved the marital residence in Willis was worth $260,000.  According to Deborah's\r\ninventory and appraisement, which she introduced into evidence at trial, the current market\r\nvalue of the home was $246,850.39, and the mortgage balance was $52,243.61, leaving a net\r\nequity of $194,606.78 in the property.  According to the \"divorce inventory summary sheet\"\r\nMax introduced into evidence, the value current value of the home was $220,000, the\r\n\"liability value\" was $50,000, which leaves a net equity of $170,000 in the property.  In its\r\nfindings of fact, the trial court found that the \"value of the community marital residence was\r\nat least $220,000 and the loan balance against such property was approximately $53,000.\" \r\nHowever, the trial court did not make a finding regarding the \"net equity of the community\r\nproperty estate in the property owned by the community property estate as of the date of the\r\nfirst economic contribution to that property by the contributing separate property estate[.]\" \r\nTex. Fam. Code Ann. § 3.403(b-1)(1)(A).  Therefore, on this record, we cannot ascertain\r\nwhether the trial court correctly applied the statutory formula in determining the amount of\r\nMax's contribution claim for funds from the sale of his separate property and the gift from\r\nNell.  Accordingly, we sustain issue two in part and overrule it in part, as explained above.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>Issue Three</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn her third issue, Deborah argues the trial court \"erred in offsetting Max's\r\nreimbursement and economic contribution claims\" against Deborah's community interest in\r\nthe Willis residence.  We have already held that Max's reimbursement claim and his\r\neconomic contribution claim for $36,000 from insurance proceeds was not supported by\r\nsufficient evidence.  Therefore, we need not address issue three as to those claims.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe now turn to the offset of Max's $48,000 and $76,000 contribution claims for the\r\ngift from Nell and the funds from the sale of his separate property residence.  Section\r\n3.403(a) of the Family Code provides that a marital estate that makes an economic\r\ncontribution to property owned by another marital estate has a claim for economic\r\ncontribution with respect to the benefitted estate.  Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 3.403(a) (Vernon\r\n2006).  As discussed above, the trial court correctly found that Nell gave Max $48,000,\r\nwhich he used to build a garage at the Willis house, and that Max put at least $76,000 of\r\nproceeds from the sale of his separate property toward the purchase of the marital residence\r\nin Willis.  As explained in our discussion of issue two, on this record, we cannot ascertain\r\nwhether the trial court correctly calculated Max's contribution claims.  Accordingly, we\r\nsustain issue three in part and overrule it in part.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>Issue Four</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn her fourth issue, Deborah asserts the trial court erred in granting the divorce on\r\ngrounds of cruelty.  Although Max pled as grounds for both cruelty and insupportability due\r\nto discord or conflict of personalities, the trial court only found that Deborah was guilty of\r\ncruelty and granted the divorce on that basis.  We review the trial court's decision for abuse\r\nof discretion.  <em>See Gonzalez</em>, 383 S.W.2d at 65.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tCruelty is one of the fault grounds for divorce.  Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 6.002\r\n(Vernon 2006); <em>Phillips v. Phillips</em>, 75 S.W.3d 564, 569 n.3 (Tex. App.--Beaumont 2002, no\r\npet.).  A divorce may be granted in favor of one spouse on the ground that the other spouse's\r\ncruel treatment toward the complaining spouse rendered further living together insupportable. \r\nTex. Fam. Code Ann. § 6.002 (Vernon 2006).  Cruel treatment is a relative term, and each\r\ncase must be determined on its own facts.  <em>Mobley v. Mobley</em>, 263 S.W.2d 794, 794-95 (Tex.\r\nCiv. App.--Waco 1953, no writ).  Cruel treatment requires willful and persistent infliction\r\nof unnecessary suffering.  <em>Gentry v. Gentry</em>, 394 S.W.2d 544, 546 (Tex. Civ. App.--Corpus\r\nChristi 1965, no writ).  The treatment must be of such a nature that it renders further living\r\ntogether insupportable.  <em>See</em> <em>Henry v. Henry</em>, 48 S.W.3d 468, 473 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th\r\nDist.] 2001, no pet.); Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 6.002.  The suffering may be mental or\r\nphysical, and it may consist of many different acts or combinations of misconduct.  <em>Mobley</em>,\r\n263 S.W.2d at 794.  Although any one of several acts standing alone might not constitute\r\ncruel treatment, the accumulation of the acts may be sufficient to justify the granting of a\r\ndivorce on ground of cruelty.  <em>Emerson v. Emerson</em>, 409 S.W.2d 897, 900 (Tex. Civ. App.--\r\nCorpus Christi 1966, no writ).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHere,  the  trial  court  found  that  Deborah  \"is  guilty  of  cruel  treatment  toward\r\nMax . . . of a nature that renders further living together insupportable.\"  The trial court heard\r\nevidence that Deborah refused to engage in sexual relations with Max for nine years.  There\r\nwas also evidence that Deborah spent a large amount of money without Max's knowledge\r\nor consent, and that Deborah's unauthorized spending had depleted their savings, leaving\r\nMax with no savings, ruined credit, and unable to retire.  Max testified that Deborah refused\r\nto allow him to see their bank statements because she \"cooked the books\" throughout their\r\nmarriage.  Max also testified that Deborah withdrew funds from his 401(k) and IRA without\r\nhis consent.  Max also testified that his reading and comprehension skills were limited, and\r\nDeborah handled the couple's finances.  Jason and Stacey testified that Deborah damaged\r\nJason's relationship with Max.  In addition, Stacey testified that Deborah borrowed money\r\nand incurred credit card debt without Max's knowledge.  Under the totality of the\r\ncircumstances presented, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion by granting a\r\ndivorce to Max on the ground of Deborah's cruelty.  We overrule issue four.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>Issue Five</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue five, Deborah contends the \"trial court abused its discretion in awarding Max\r\na disproportionate division of the community estate.\"  The Family Code provides that a trial\r\ncourt \"shall order a division of the estate of the parties in a manner that the court deems just\r\nand right, having due regard for the rights of each party. . . .\"  Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 7.001\r\n(Vernon 2006).  A trial court has wide latitude in dividing the estate of the parties, and may\r\nconsider many factors in making a just and right division of the property.  <em>Murff</em>, 615 S.W.2d\r\nat 698-99.  Therefore, absent an abuse of discretion, we will not disturb the trial court's\r\ndivision of property on appeal.  <em>Id</em>. at 698.  If substantive and probative evidence supporting\r\nthe trial court's decision exists, the trial court does not abuse its discretion by ordering an\r\nunequal division of the marital estate.  <em>Id</em>. at 698-99.  \"The division of the marital estate need\r\nnot be equal, and fault is one of the many factors that a trial court may consider in making\r\na division of the community estate.\"  <em>Ohendalski v. Ohendalski</em>, 203 S.W.3d 910, 914 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Beaumont 2006, no pet.).  In a fault-based divorce, the trial court \"may consider the\r\nconduct of the errant spouse in making a disproportionate distribution of the marital estate.\" \r\n<em>Id</em>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHere, the trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law expressly stated that in\r\nawarding a disproportionate share of the community estate to Max, the court took into\r\naccount the liens in favor of Max for contribution and reimbursement.  The divorce decree\r\nalso stated that \"the liens for economic contribution and for reimbursement shall be and are\r\nsatisfied by the award of [Deborah's] interest in the community estate to [Max] to the extent\r\nthe community estate is not specifically awarded herein to [Deborah].\"  We decline to hold\r\nthat the trial court abused its discretion by deciding to award a disproportionate division of\r\nthe community estate to Max.  However, we reverse and remand because the trial court's\r\nerrors in characterizing certain property, as well as the granting of Max's reimbursement\r\nclaim for $15,000 and his contribution claim for $36,000 in flood insurance proceeds\r\nnecessarily affected the accuracy of the property division in this small estate.  <em>See Scott v.\r\nScott</em>, 805 S.W.2d 835, 841 (Tex. App.--Waco 1991, writ denied) (Reversible error occurs\r\nif the trial court's mischaracterization of property materially affected the trial court's \"just\r\nand right\" property division.).

We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>Background</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDeborah and appellee Max Lindley Burgess were married on April 6, 1991.  No\r\nchildren were born or adopted during the marriage.  In January of 2005, Max filed for\r\ndivorce.  Max cited as grounds for divorce both cruelty and insupportability due to discord\r\nor conflict of personalities.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt the bench trial, Max testified that he owned a home in Harris County before he\r\nmarried Deborah.  Max still owed $4700 on the mortgage when he and Deborah married, and\r\nhe paid the $4700 in monthly installments of $57 using funds from his paycheck.<sup> (1)</sup>  While\r\nMax and Deborah were living in the Harris County home, the home flooded, and Max\r\nreceived $56,000 from his flood insurance company.  When Max subsequently sold the\r\nHarris County home, he received $81,602, which he then paid toward the purchase of a new\r\nhome in Willis.  Max testified that he also applied $36,000 of the flood insurance settlement\r\ntoward the purchase of the Willis home.  In addition, Max borrowed $18,000 from his 401(k)\r\nplan to purchase the lot for the Willis home.  Max testified that he built a $21,900 detached\r\ngarage at the marital residence using a $15,000 loan from his mother.  According to Max, he\r\nalso received $48,000 as a gift from his mother, and he used that money for the Willis house\r\nand its garage.  Max testified that although the $48,000 was a gift, he made a few payments\r\nto his mother for the money.  However, during cross-examination, Max characterized the\r\n$48,000 as a loan, and he explained that his mother subsequently forgave the debt.  Max\r\ntestified that he advanced a total of $142,458 of his separate funds toward the construction\r\nof the Willis house.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMax testified that the marriage had become insupportable because of discord or\r\nconflicts of personalities, reconciliation was impossible, and Deborah had been cruel to him. \r\nMax opined that he should receive the house because of Deborah's cruelty to him. \r\nAccording to Max, the marriage was only enjoyable for three to four years, and he testified\r\nthat Deborah \"quit being a wife to me.\"  Max explained that Deborah did not sleep in the\r\nbedroom with him because she had to stay up late to check on her daughter Heather, who\r\nworked \"at the bars and she didn't get off 'til 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.  She talked to\r\nHeather all the way home so she wouldn't fall asleep.\"  Max testified that he and Deborah\r\nhad not been sexually intimate for eight to nine years, and although this was a problem for\r\nhim, she refused to attend counseling.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter Max married Deborah, he learned she had credit card debt that she was unable\r\nto pay.   However, Deborah did not tell him how much she owed.  Max testified that Deborah\r\nsought assistance from Consumer Credit Counseling Services (\"CCCS\"), and Max\r\ncontributed $20,000 from his pre-marriage savings toward her debt reduction program.  Max\r\nand Deborah also filed a petition for bankruptcy, and that proceeding concluded on February\r\n12, 2004.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMax testified that he \"barely made it through school\" because he \"couldn't read and\r\ncomprehend too good.\"  Max explained that when he received his paychecks, he gave them\r\nto Deborah, and \"[s]he would sign my name to . . . my check and take it to the bank.\"  Max\r\nexplained that he and Deborah usually deposited seven to eight hundred dollars from each\r\nof his biweekly paychecks into the savings account.  Max also testified that Deborah wrote\r\nthe deposits on the back of the checkbook when she went to the bank, but Max generally did\r\nnot see their bank statements despite asking Deborah for them.  Max testified that he and\r\nDeborah often fought when he saw the bank statements because \"she had stuff that was done\r\nwrong and she did not want me to see them.\"  According to Max, his disagreements with\r\nDeborah usually pertained to Deborah's credit card debt or to Heather.  Max explained that\r\nDeborah \"was taking a lot of money from me to take care of Heather.\"  Max testified, \"I\r\nwould think it was going to get better after '95, the first time, credit cards.  I loved her and\r\nI cried about it, and I told her, her and Heather both, . . . 'Don't ever do this to me again.' \r\nShe said, 'I won't.'  It didn't last two or three years; it started again.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn 2003, Max learned that Deborah was again having financial problems because he\r\nbegan receiving phone calls from creditors, and he tried unsuccessfully to make a small\r\npurchase using his debit card.  Max explained that when he attempted to make the purchase,\r\nhe believed he had $53,500 in his savings account because Deborah had written that amount\r\non a card.  When Max asked Deborah whether they had any money in the bank, she said,\r\n\"No.\"  Max testified that Deborah \"cooked the books the whole time we was married.\"  Max\r\nfurther explained that Deborah hid the mail before he got home, thereby preventing him from\r\nseeing the bank statements.  Max also testified that Deborah kept some of the bedrooms in\r\ntheir home locked with a padlock and \"a key that she hid.  I couldn't even go into my\r\nbedrooms. . . .  She had stuff hidden in there.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAccording to Max, Deborah withdrew $5,000 from his 401(k) plan without his\r\npermission.  Max also testified that he started an IRA in 1983 with $2,000, and the IRA is\r\npresently worth only $1,000 because Deborah made withdrawals from it without his consent.\r\nMax explained that he is sixty-two years old, and although he was eligible to retire at age\r\nfifty-five, he did not do so because Deborah twice ruined his credit during their marriage, and\r\nhe had no money.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMax  testified that when Deborah left, she took his truck and his paycheck with her,\r\nand he learned that their bank account only contained one hundred dollars.  After Deborah\r\nleft, Max's mother loaned him money to purchase another truck, and he bought a 2002\r\nChevrolet Silverado.  Max testified that he had been trying to convince Deborah to find a job\r\nbecause, \"[a]fter the bankruptcy, I was down to my last nickel.  I had no money.  My credit\r\nwas gone, all on account of her.\"  According to Max, after Deborah left, she called him and\r\nsaid \"she'd lied to me for a long time, and she said she'd never lie to me again.\"  Max\r\ntestified that he was shocked when Deborah left, and he had \"[n]o money, no credit, no\r\nautomobile.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMax's mother, Nell, testified that she loaned Max and Deborah $15,000 because Max\r\n\"wanted a nice house and I thought I would loan that to him to help him out.\"  Nell testified\r\nthat she gave the remainder of the money to Max as a gift.<sup> (2)</sup>  Nell testified that part of the\r\nfunds Max and Deborah used to build the garage for their home came from her.  Nell\r\nexplained that Max and Deborah made payments to her only on the $15,000 promissory note. \r\nAfter Deborah left Max, Nell loaned Max $10,000 to purchase a truck.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMax's son, Jason, testified that he had a good relationship with his father at the time\r\nof Max's marriage to Deborah, but the relationship began to deteriorate after a couple of\r\nyears.  Jason explained that Deborah \"basically would tell me bad things . . . about my\r\nfather.\"  He testified that Deborah would \"[j]ust tell me that he really didn't like me, didn't\r\ncare for me too much, and just said that I wasn't his son, and all these horrible things.\"\r\nAccording to Jason, Max \"said that wasn't true; he never said anything like that.\"  Jason\r\nfurther explained that Deborah \"would tell me horrible things about him, and she would tell\r\nhim horrible things about me.  And she just basically made it to where we didn't want to be\r\naround each other.\"  Jason testified that he and his father did not speak until two weeks after\r\nDeborah left Max.  According to Jason, Deborah told him approximately two years before\r\nshe left his father that she planned to seek a divorce.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAccording to Jason, Deborah spent $15,000 purchasing furniture for Heather's\r\napartment with Max's credit card.  Jason also testified that Heather \"was  a  bad  driver  and \r\nwrecked  her  car  a  lot,  so  they  would  have  to  help  her  out financially. . . .\"  Jason\r\nfurther explained that Heather had lost two jobs \"for drugs and stuff like that.  And they\r\nbasically had to bail her out and help her pay her rent when she lost her jobs.\"  Jason testified\r\nthat he observed Heather's drug problem \"with my own eyes.\"  Jason also testified that\r\nHeather had in her possession credit cards and ATM cards that belonged to Max and\r\nDeborah.  According to Jason, Deborah told him she gave the cards to Heather \"because she\r\ncouldn't leave at certain times, in order to get money.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJason's wife, Stacey, testified that Deborah tried to interfere with the relationship\r\nbetween Jason and Max.  According to Stacey, she only heard negative things about Max\r\nfrom Debbie and Heather, and Deborah told her and Jason that Max \"didn't really like us\r\nwhen we came around[.]\"  Stacey testified that Deborah also \"said that Max didn't think\r\nJason was his real son.\"  Stacey explained that Deborah also told her that Max had no interest\r\nin his grandchild and did not want to see her.  Stacey testified that she now believes the\r\nthings Deborah said were not true.  Stacey testified that Max became upset because \"[h]e had\r\nfound financial statements when [Deborah and Heather] had gone to the bank to make a loan. \r\nFinancial loans had come about and credit card debt that he didn't know about.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDeborah Burgess testified that when she married Max, she moved into the Harris\r\nCounty home, and she estimated that the home was worth approximately $30,000 in 1991.\r\nDeborah testified that the value of the house was $90,000 when she and Max moved out in\r\n2003.  According to Deborah, she and Max made payments on the mortgage owed on the\r\nHarris County home.  Deborah and Max paid off the mortgage on that home in 1998, and she\r\nand Max continued to reside there until 2003.  According to Deborah, the Harris County\r\nhome flooded while she and Max were residing there.  Most of their furniture was destroyed,\r\nand Deborah testified that they had to replace it.  Deborah denied that most of the items in\r\nthe house had belonged to Max before their marriage.  Deborah testified that she and Max\r\nreceived a check for $56,000 from the flood insurance company, and they deposited the\r\nmoney into Max's savings account.  Deborah denied withdrawing any of the $56,000 from\r\nthe savings account.  Deborah testified that of the $56,000 settlement from their flood\r\ninsurance, she and Max spent $20,000 repairing the Harris County home and put the\r\nremaining $36,000 into their community savings account.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDeborah testified that she and Max signed a promissory note to Nell, in which they\r\nagreed to repay Nell $15,000.  Deborah explained that she and Max also received $48,000\r\nfrom Nell, but she and Max did not sign a promissory note for that money.  Deborah testified\r\nthat the $48,000 from Nell was a gift \"[f]or us, for Max, for the garage.\"  Deborah also\r\ntestified that the $18,000 for the purchase of the lot in Willis came from Max's 401(k) plan,\r\nand Max repaid the money with funds from his paychecks.<sup> (3)</sup>  According to Deborah, the\r\n$21,900 she and Max used to build the garage at the Willis house came from Nell.  Deborah\r\nfurther testified that the $81,602 Max received from the Harris County home went toward\r\nthe purchase of the residence in Willis.  Deborah explained that she and Max sold the Harris\r\nCounty home in April of 2003, and they also purchased the property in Willis during the\r\nsame month.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDeborah denied having debt and financial problems prior to the marriage, but she\r\nadmitted that she and Max consulted CCCS about setting up a repayment plan.  Deborah\r\ntestified that she did not owe the debts prior to the marriage.  Deborah explained that\r\nalthough she received $18,000 from the sale of her hair salon, she had financial trouble due\r\nto rent increases and \"[f]rom having to take off so much\" for vacations with Max.  Deborah\r\ntestified that she put the $18,000 into their joint savings account.  Deborah testified that when\r\nshe and Max married, she had no debt.  Deborah denied that Max contributed any money\r\nfrom his separate property savings toward the CCCS debt reduction plan.  Rather, Deborah\r\naccepted another job and repaid the CCCS herself.  Deborah also denied making withdrawals\r\nfrom Max's IRA.  According to Deborah, she and Max did not have financial difficulties\r\nuntil \"the very end\" of the marriage.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDeborah testified that she and Max filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in early 2004. \r\nDeborah denied knowledge of precisely who incurred the credit card debt reflected in their\r\nbankruptcy schedules.  Deborah denied that she was the one who incurred most of the credit\r\ncard charges, which totaled $125,595, and she testified that Max knew about most of the\r\ncharges that were made.  Deborah admitted that she currently owes $6,054 on a credit card\r\nthat she obtained since the bankruptcy, and she has received calls from collectors regarding\r\nthe debt.  When asked whether she always discussed it with Max before applying for credit\r\ncards, she testified, \"I don't know.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAccording to Deborah, Max gave his paychecks to her, and she paid the bills and\r\nmade some of the ATM withdrawals.  Deborah denied giving Heather her credit cards and\r\nATM card.  Deborah admitted that she purchased furniture for Heather, but she denied\r\npaying for Heather's car repairs, apartment rent, or drug rehabilitation.  Deborah testified that\r\nHeather does not have a drug problem.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDeborah testified that she and Max paid the flood insurance premiums on the Harris\r\nCounty home from their joint checking account.  Deborah also explained that the funds she\r\nand Max received from the sale of the Harris County home \"went directly to pay for the\r\ndown payment on the new house. . . .\"  Deborah testified that she and Max moved into the\r\nWillis house in March of 2003.  Deborah testified that Max also owns the home in which\r\nNell resides because Nell deeded the home to Max to prevent her daughter from inheriting\r\nit.  However, she also testified that she and Max did not pay taxes or insurance on the home. \r\n\tDeborah denied taking any furniture or fixtures with her when she left Max. \r\nHowever, she testified that she took a 1999 Chevrolet Silverado.  Deborah testified that she\r\nwas unable to meet her necessary monthly living expenses based upon her income, and she\r\nrequested that the court award her spousal support.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the divorce decree, the trial court granted Max a divorce from Deborah on the\r\nground of cruelty, and he awarded Max the Willis home; all household furniture, furnishings,\r\nfixtures, goods, art objects, collectibles, appliances, and equipment in Max's possession or\r\nsubject to his sole control; all clothing, jewelry, and other personal effects in Max's\r\npossession or subject to his sole control; all sums of cash in Max's possession or subject to\r\nhis sole control; and all sums in any retirement plan, 401(k) plan, or employee savings plan;\r\nall insurance policies on Max's life; the 2002 Chevrolet Silverado; and a 1999 motor boat. \r\nThe trial court awarded Deborah all household furniture, furnishings, fixtures, goods, art\r\nobjects, collectibles, appliances, and equipment in her possession or subject to her sole\r\ncontrol; all clothing, jewelry, and other personal effects in her possession or subject to her\r\nsole control; all sums of cash in her possession or subject to her sole control; and the 1999\r\nChevrolet Silverado.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWith respect to the parties' debts, the trial court ordered Max to indemnify Deborah\r\nand hold her harmless for the $54,200 balance due on the marital residence; all unsecured\r\ndebts, charges, liabilities, and obligations in Max's name; any debts, charges, liabilities, and\r\nother obligations incurred solely by Max after the parties separated; and all taxes due or to\r\nbecome due on the real and personal property awarded to Max.  The trial court ordered\r\nDeborah to pay any and all debts incurred solely by her after the parties separated or standing\r\nin her name and all encumbrances, taxes, assessments, or other charges due or to become due\r\non the real and personal property awarded to Deborah.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial court also awarded Max \"for economic contribution of [Max's] separate\r\nestate to the community estate[;]\" $76,000 in equity from Max's former separate property\r\nresidence; $36,000 from insurance proceeds covering Max's former separate residence; and\r\n$48,000 \"in personal gifts of funds to [Max] from his mother.\"  The trial court further found\r\nthat \"the community estate is entitled to reimbursement from [Deborah's] separate estate for\r\nfunds expended to discharge all or part of an unsecured liability of [Deborah's] separate\r\nestate and that Max . . . is entitled to a judgment of $15,000.\"  The court decreed that \"liens\r\nfor economic contribution and for reimbursement shall be and are satisfied by the award of\r\n[Deborah's] interest in the community estate to [Max] to the extent the community estate is\r\nnot specifically awarded herein to [Deborah].\"  The trial court also entered findings of fact\r\nand conclusions of law, as discussed more fully herein.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>Standards of Review</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe review the trial court's findings of fact under the same legal standards applied to\r\nsufficiency reviews of jury verdicts.  <em>Ortiz v.

Specifically, Deborah complains that the trial court\r\nerred in characterizing the following property as Max's separate property: (1) $15,000 paid\r\nby Max toward Deborah's separate credit card debt; (2) $36,000 from casualty insurance\r\nproceeds received when Max's separate property homestead flooded; and (3) $48,000\r\nadvanced to Max by his mother.<sup> (4)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAll property possessed by either spouse during marriage or upon dissolution of\r\nmarriage is presumed to be community property.  Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 3.003(a) (Vernon\r\n2006).  The community-property presumption may be rebutted by using the inception-of-title\r\nrule, which provides that property's character is determined by the time and manner in which\r\na person first acquires an ownership interest in it.  <em>See Jensen v.

When separate and community property that are similar in nature have been\r\ncommingled, a spouse must use tracing to identify and segregate the portion of the property\r\nthat is separate.  <em>See Zagorski</em>, 116 S.W.3d at 319-20 (Tracing is required to establish the\r\ncharacter of separate funds contained in a bank account containing commingled funds.).  A\r\nspouse is competent to testify about the character of his property; however, his testimony\r\nusually must be corroborated by other testimonial or documentary evidence to rebut the\r\ncommunity-property presumption.  <em>See Bahr v.

A spouse's uncorroborated and uncontradicted testimony is\r\nsufficient to constitute clear and convincing evidence.  <em>See id</em>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWith respect to the $15,000, Max testified that he paid $20,000 of Deborah's separate\r\nproperty credit card debt using funds he owned before marriage.  However, Deborah testified\r\nthat she did not owe any debt prior to the marriage.  Although Deborah admitted that she and\r\nMax consulted CCCS, she denied that Max contributed any money from his separate property\r\nsavings toward the debt reduction plan.  Deborah testified that she accepted another job and\r\nrepaid CCCS herself.  In finding of fact 10, the trial court found that the \"separate estate of\r\nMax Lindley Burgess paid $15,000 toward the unsecured liabilities of the separate estate of\r\nDeborah Kay Burgess.\"  In conclusion of law 25, the trial court determined that Max proved\r\nby clear and convincing evidence that his separate estate was entitled to reimbursement in\r\nthe amount of $15,000.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMax bore the burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that the\r\n$15,000 he used to pay Deborah's debt was his separate property.   Tex. Fam. Code Ann. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>§ 3.003(b).  Max testified that he paid $20,000 from his savings account using funds that he\r\nhad acquired prior to the marriage.  However, Max did not testify regarding the balance of\r\nthe savings account prior to the marriage, nor did he provide the date or an approximate time\r\nframe as to when he paid Deborah's credit card debt.  Furthermore, Max testified that he and\r\nDeborah deposited community funds into the account during their marriage, yet he offered\r\nno evidence tracing the funds in the savings account.  <em>See Zagorski,</em> 116 S.W.3d at 319-20. \r\nAlthough Max offered some evidence that he paid Deborah's pre-marriage credit card debt\r\nusing $20,000 of his separate property funds, Max did not demonstrate the separate character\r\nof the funds by clear and convincing evidence.<sup> (5)</sup>  <em>See</em> Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 3.003(b). \r\nBecause Max did not demonstrate the separate character of the funds by clear and convincing\r\nevidence, we find that the evidence is factually insufficient to support the trial court's\r\nfinding.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWith respect to the $36,000 of casualty insurance proceeds Max received when his\r\nseparate residence flooded, the parties both testified that the residence belonged to Max prior\r\nto their marriage.  Therefore, the evidence was legally and factually sufficient to demonstrate\r\nthat the residence was Max's separate property.  <em>See</em> Tex. Const. art. XVI, § 15; Tex. Fam.\r\nCode Ann. § 3.001(1), (2); Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 3.002.  We now turn to the question of\r\nwhether the insurance proceeds received when the residence flooded constitute community\r\nproperty or separate property.  The proceeds of a casualty insurance policy take their\r\ncharacter from the property that is insured.  Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 3.008(a) (Vernon 2006);\r\n<em>see McIntire v. McIntire</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1744655\"><a href=\"/opinion/1744655/mcintire-v-mcintire/\"><span class=\"volume\">702</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">284</span></a></span>, 288 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1985, writ\r\nref'd n.r.e.).  Hence, the proceeds of a policy insuring separate property are separate property,\r\nwhile the proceeds of a policy insuring community property are community property.  Tex.\r\nFam. Code Ann. § 3.008(a).  If a policy insures both community and separate property, the\r\nproceeds of the policy will be apportioned between the community and separate estates.  <em>See</em>\r\n<em>First Nat'l Bank in Houston v. Finn</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3959629\"><a href=\"/opinion/4189942/first-nat-bank-in-houston-v-finn/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span>, 153 (Tex. Civ. App.--Galveston 1939,\r\nwrit dism'd).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHere, Max testified that he received a settlement totaling $56,000 from the flood\r\ninsurance company, and that the settlement covered both structural damage to the home and\r\npersonal property damage.  The parties lived in the residence as husband and wife for at least\r\nthirteen years.  Max offered no evidence regarding whether the items of personal property\r\nin the home were community property, his separate property, or Deborah's separate property,\r\nnor did he testify as to the value of any of the property.  Max had the burden to prove by clear\r\nand convincing evidence that the remaining $36,000 of insurance proceeds for which he\r\nsought contribution represented compensation for the loss of his separate property.  <em>See</em> Tex.\r\nFam. Code Ann. § 3.003(b).  We find that the evidence is factually insufficient to support\r\nthe trial court's finding. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span> \tDeborah also argues in issue one that the trial court erred in characterizing $48,000 \r\nadvanced to Max by Nell as Max's separate property.  In finding of fact 13, subsection (iii),\r\nthe trial court found that Max was entitled to economic contribution for the $48,000 in funds\r\n\"received exclusively by him as gifts from his mother.\"  Implicit in the trial court's finding\r\nthat the $48,000 was a gift from Nell is a determination that the $48,000 is separate property. \r\n<em>See</em> Tex. Const. art. XVI, § 15; Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 3.001(1), (2); Tex. Fam. Code\r\nAnn. § 3.002 (Property acquired by gift is separate property.).  Nell testified unequivocally\r\nthat with the exception of a $15,000 loan, the money she advanced to Max was a gift to him. \r\nDeborah testified that the $48,000 was a gift \"[f]or us, for Max. . . .\"  Max's testimony\r\nregarding whether the $48,000 was a gift or a loan was unclear, equivocal, and sometimes\r\ncontradictory.  When asked whether he considered the $48,000 a gift or a loan, Max initially\r\ntestified, \"I guess a gift.\"  However, Max equivocated during both the remainder of his direct\r\nexamination and cross-examination regarding whether he believed the $48,000 from Nell\r\nwas a gift or a loan.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA gift is a transfer of property made voluntarily and gratuitously, without\r\nconsideration.  <em>Hilley v.

The intent of the donor is the principal issue in determining\r\nwhether a transfer constitutes a gift.  <em>Id</em>.  Here, Nell clearly testified that she intended the\r\nfunds as a gift.  Although Max's testimony was at best equivocal as to whether he viewed \r\nthe $48,000 as a gift or a loan, the evidence clearly and convincingly demonstrated Nell's\r\ndonative intent and delivery, as well as Max's acceptance of the funds.  <em>See Hayes</em>, 65\r\nS.W.3d at 289.  The evidence is factually sufficient to support the trial court's finding that\r\nthe $48,000 constituted a gift to Max.  We sustain issue one in part and overrule it in part.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>Issue Two</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn her second issue, Deborah contends the trial court erred in awarding Max's claims\r\nfor reimbursement and economic contribution.  Specifically, Deborah asserts the trial court\r\nerred in awarding Max $15,000 reimbursement for paying Deborah's separate credit card\r\ndebt, as well as contribution for $76,000 from the sale of his separate property residence,\r\n$36,000 from insurance flood insurance proceeds after Max's separate property residence\r\nflooded, and $48,000 advanced to Max by his mother.  With respect to the trial court's\r\nfinding that Max advanced $15,000 of his separate property funds to repay Deborah's\r\nseparate estate, thereby giving rise to a claim for reimbursement, we have found that the\r\nevidence was insufficient to support Max's contention that the $15,000 was his separate\r\nproperty.  Therefore, Max's claim for reimbursement of those funds necessarily fails. \r\nFurthermore, we have found that the evidence was insufficient to support Max's claim that\r\nthe entire $36,000 of casualty insurance proceeds constituted his separate property.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe now turn to the trial court's awards of $48,000 and $76,000 in contribution claims\r\nto Max for the gift from Nell and the proceeds of the sale of his separate property residence. \r\nTo uphold the trial court's findings that Max contributed $48,000 and $76,000 to the\r\ncommunity estate from the gift and from the sale of his separate property, we must find that\r\nthey   are   supported   by   clear   and   convincing   evidence.  <em> See</em>   Tex.   Fam.   Code  \r\nAnn. §§ 3.003(b), 3.403 (Vernon 2006).  Both Max and Deborah testified that Max received\r\n$81,602 when he sold his separate residence.  Deborah testified that all of those proceeds\r\nwent toward the purchase of the community residence in Willis.  The parties both testified\r\nthat the $48,000 from Nell was used to build a garage and make other improvements to the\r\nWillis residence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDeborah apparently does not dispute that the Harris County residence was Max's\r\nseparate property, that Max put at least $76,000 of the proceeds from the sale of the residence\r\ntoward the purchase of the community residence in Willis, or that Max put the gift from Nell\r\ntoward the Willis residence.  Rather, Deborah seems to argue that the trial court erred by not\r\ntaking into consideration the community funds that were paid toward the mortgage and\r\nimprovements to the Harris County residence.  Max did testify that for seven years of the\r\nmarriage, he paid the mortgage on his separate property residence using community funds. \r\nDeborah testified that she and Max used community funds to make numerous improvements\r\nto the residence before selling it in 2003.  Deborah's argument that the trial court erred by\r\nfailing to consider the community estate's investment in Max's separate property amounts\r\nto a claim for contribution or reimbursement, and she did not raise such a claim in the trial\r\ncourt.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a).  We find the evidence clearly and convincingly showed\r\nthat Max put at least $76,000 of his separate property toward the marital residence.  We have\r\nalso found that the evidence clearly and convincingly demonstrated that Max received\r\n$48,000 as a gift from Nell.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial court stated that in calculating the amount of Max's contribution claims, it\r\napplied the statutory formula, which provides as follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(a)  A marital estate that makes an economic contribution to property owned\r\nby another marital estate has a claim for economic contribution with respect\r\nto the benefited estate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t(b)  The amount of the claim under this section is equal to the product of:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t(1)  the equity in the benefited property on the date of the dissolution\r\nof the marriage . . . multiplied by </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t(2)  a fraction of which:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t(A)  the numerator is the economic contribution to the property\r\nowned by the benefited marital estate by the contributing marital estate;\r\nand</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t(B)  the denominator is an amount equal to the sum of:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t(I)  the economic contribution to the property owned by\r\nthe benefited marital estate by the contributing marital\r\nestate; and</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t(ii)  the contribution by the benefited estate to the equity\r\nin the property owned by the benefited estate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t(b-1)  The amount of the contribution by the benefited marital estate under\r\nSubsection (b)(2)(b)(ii) is measured by determining:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t(1)  if the benefited estate is the community property estate:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t(A)  the net equity of the community property estate in the\r\nproperty owned by the community property estate as of the date of the\r\nfirst economic contribution to that property by the contributing separate\r\nproperty estate; and</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t(B)  any additional economic contribution to the equity in the\r\nproperty owned by the community property estate made by the\r\nbenefited community property estate after the date described by\r\nSubdivision (A). . . . </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 3.403(a), (b), (b-1) (Vernon 2006).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMax estimated that the Willis home is currently worth approximately $215,000. \r\nDeborah testified that including the improvements she and Max made to the home, she\r\nbelieved the marital residence in Willis was worth $260,000.  According to Deborah's\r\ninventory and appraisement, which she introduced into evidence at trial, the current market\r\nvalue of the home was $246,850.39, and the mortgage balance was $52,243.61, leaving a net\r\nequity of $194,606.78 in the property.  According to the \"divorce inventory summary sheet\"\r\nMax introduced into evidence, the value current value of the home was $220,000, the\r\n\"liability value\" was $50,000, which leaves a net equity of $170,000 in the property.  In its\r\nfindings of fact, the trial court found that the \"value of the community marital residence was\r\nat least $220,000 and the loan balance against such property was approximately $53,000.\" \r\nHowever, the trial court did not make a finding regarding the \"net equity of the community\r\nproperty estate in the property owned by the community property estate as of the date of the\r\nfirst economic contribution to that property by the contributing separate property estate[.]\" \r\nTex. Fam. Code Ann. § 3.403(b-1)(1)(A).  Therefore, on this record, we cannot ascertain\r\nwhether the trial court correctly applied the statutory formula in determining the amount of\r\nMax's contribution claim for funds from the sale of his separate property and the gift from\r\nNell.  Accordingly, we sustain issue two in part and overrule it in part, as explained above.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>Issue Three</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn her third issue, Deborah argues the trial court \"erred in offsetting Max's\r\nreimbursement and economic contribution claims\" against Deborah's community interest in\r\nthe Willis residence.  We have already held that Max's reimbursement claim and his\r\neconomic contribution claim for $36,000 from insurance proceeds was not supported by\r\nsufficient evidence.  Therefore, we need not address issue three as to those claims.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe now turn to the offset of Max's $48,000 and $76,000 contribution claims for the\r\ngift from Nell and the funds from the sale of his separate property residence.  Section\r\n3.403(a) of the Family Code provides that a marital estate that makes an economic\r\ncontribution to property owned by another marital estate has a claim for economic\r\ncontribution with respect to the benefitted estate.  Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 3.403(a) (Vernon\r\n2006).  As discussed above, the trial court correctly found that Nell gave Max $48,000,\r\nwhich he used to build a garage at the Willis house, and that Max put at least $76,000 of\r\nproceeds from the sale of his separate property toward the purchase of the marital residence\r\nin Willis.  As explained in our discussion of issue two, on this record, we cannot ascertain\r\nwhether the trial court correctly calculated Max's contribution claims.  Accordingly, we\r\nsustain issue three in part and overrule it in part.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>Issue Four</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn her fourth issue, Deborah asserts the trial court erred in granting the divorce on\r\ngrounds of cruelty.  Although Max pled as grounds for both cruelty and insupportability due\r\nto discord or conflict of personalities, the trial court only found that Deborah was guilty of\r\ncruelty and granted the divorce on that basis.  We review the trial court's decision for abuse\r\nof discretion.  <em>See Gonzalez</em>, 383 S.W.2d at 65.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tCruelty is one of the fault grounds for divorce.  Tex. Fam.

There\r\nwas also evidence that Deborah spent a large amount of money without Max's knowledge\r\nor consent, and that Deborah's unauthorized spending had depleted their savings, leaving\r\nMax with no savings, ruined credit, and unable to retire.  Max testified that Deborah refused\r\nto allow him to see their bank statements because she \"cooked the books\" throughout their\r\nmarriage.  Max also testified that Deborah withdrew funds from his 401(k) and IRA without\r\nhis consent.  Max also testified that his reading and comprehension skills were limited, and\r\nDeborah handled the couple's finances.  Jason and Stacey testified that Deborah damaged\r\nJason's relationship with Max.  In addition, Stacey testified that Deborah borrowed money\r\nand incurred credit card debt without Max's knowledge.  Under the totality of the\r\ncircumstances presented, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion by granting a\r\ndivorce to Max on the ground of Deborah's cruelty.  We overrule issue four.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>Issue Five</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue five, Deborah contends the \"trial court abused its discretion in awarding Max\r\na disproportionate division of the community estate.\"  The Family Code provides that a trial\r\ncourt \"shall order a division of the estate of the parties in a manner that the court deems just\r\nand right, having due regard for the rights of each party. . . .\"  Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 7.001\r\n(Vernon 2006).  A trial court has wide latitude in dividing the estate of the parties, and may\r\nconsider many factors in making a just and right division of the property.  <em>Murff</em>, 615 S.W.2d\r\nat 698-99.

The divorce decree\r\nalso stated that \"the liens for economic contribution and for reimbursement shall be and are\r\nsatisfied by the award of [Deborah's] interest in the community estate to [Max] to the extent\r\nthe community estate is not specifically awarded herein to [Deborah].\"  We decline to hold\r\nthat the trial court abused its discretion by deciding to award a disproportionate division of\r\nthe community estate to Max.  However, we reverse and remand because the trial court's\r\nerrors in characterizing certain property, as well as the granting of Max's reimbursement\r\nclaim for $15,000 and his contribution claim for $36,000 in flood insurance proceeds\r\nnecessarily affected the accuracy of the property division in this small estate.  <em>See Scott v.\r\nScott</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2363042\"><a href=\"/opinion/2363042/scott-v-scott/\"><span class=\"volume\">805</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">835</span></a></span>, 841 (Tex.

Max later testified that he paid $4900 toward the mortgage after the marriage.\r\n</p><p>2.  Nell testified (apparently erroneously) that she gave Max a gift of $63,000 in\r\naddition to the $15,000 loan.\r\n</p><p>3.  The parties stipulated that the $18,000 from the 401(k) constituted community\r\nproperty.\r\n</p><p>4.  As part of her argument in issue one, Deborah asserts that the trial court's finding\r\nthat she secretly converted $50,000 of community property is erroneous.  However, because\r\nthis argument does not pertain to her stated issue one (<em>i.e.</em> the characterization of property as\r\nseparate or community), we do not address it.\r\n</p><p>5.  We note that although the trial court found that Max's separate estate paid a debt of\r\nDeborah's estate in the amount of $15,000, the trial court's findings erroneously state that\r\nMax is entitled to reimbursement from the community estate rather than Deborah's separate\r\nestate.</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",
