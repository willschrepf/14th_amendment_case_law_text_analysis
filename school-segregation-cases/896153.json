STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n¶1. Stanley Daniels and five co-plaintiffs filed suit against the Harrison County Board of Supervisors,\nseeking to enjoin the Board from \"carrying through with their intentions to fly the Confederate Battle\nFlag on the Mississippi Beaches and other public property located within Harrison County.\" The\nConfederate Flag was and is currently being displayed on a portion of the Gulf Coast beach known as\n\"Eight Flags.\" The flags displayed at this location represent the eight governments, including the\nConfederate States of America, which have, at some point in history, claimed sovereignty over this\narea of the State.\n\n¶2. On September 11, 1996, the Circuit Judge entered an order granting the Board's motion for\nsummary judgment, ruling that the display of the Confederate Flag by the Board was not prohibited\nby law, statutory or otherwise. Daniels appealed the trial judge's ruling to this Court.\n\n                                             II. ISSUES\n\f     A. Whether the circuit court erred by ignoring inclusio unius est exclusio alterius in its\n     analysis and construction of Miss. Code Ann. § 3-3-15 (1972).\n\n¶3. This Court employs a de novo standard in reviewing a trial court's grant of a motion for summary\njudgment. Summary judgment is proper where there exist no genuine issues of material fact and\njudgment may be rendered as a matter of law. Mississippi Ethics Com'n v. Aseme, 583 So.2d 955,\n957 (Miss. 1991). In the present appeal, there are no disputed issues of fact, and this Court is\npresented with a question of law.\n\n¶4. Daniels argues that the display of the Confederate Battle Flag at Eight Flags is barred by a proper\ninterpretation of statute. Specifically, Daniels argues that the trial court erred in failing to apply the\ndoctrine of inclusio unius est exclusio alterius in its interpretation of Miss. Code Ann. § 3-3-15\n(1972). MCA § 3-3-15 provides that:\n\n     The state flag may be displayed from all public buildings from sunrise to sunset; however, the\n     state flag may be displayed from all public buildings twenty-four hours a day if properly\n     illuminated. The state flag should not be displayed when the weather is inclement, except when\n     an all-weather flag is displayed. The state flag shall receive all of the respect and ceremonious\n     etiquette given the American flag. Provided, however, nothing in this section shall be construed\n     so as to affect the precedence given to the flag of the United States of America.\n\nDaniels notes that this Court held in Lee v. Alexander, 607 So.2d 30, 36 (Miss. 1992) that \"(w)here\na statute enumerates and specifies the subject or things upon which it is to operate, it is to be\nconstrued as excluding from its effect all those not expressly mentioned or under a general clause . .\n.\" Daniels concludes that, based upon this doctrine of statutory interpretation, \"it is thus clear that\nMCA § 3-3-15 must be construed as excluding the Confederate or battle flag from its effect or\ndelineating conditions under which the state flag may be flown.\"\n\n¶5. This argument is without merit. In the view of this Court, MCA § 3-3-15 can not validly be\ninterpreted as prohibiting the display of the Confederate Battle flag or any other flag. This statute was\nwritten to set guidelines for the display of the Mississippi state flag in a proper and respectful manner,\nand it contains no provisions which limit the display of other flags. It is clear that MCA § 3-3-15 is a\nstatute of very limited scope, and there is nothing in its language to indicate that it should be broadly\n\"interpreted\" to bar the display of the Confederate Flag. The Circuit Judge correctly stated in his\nruling granting summary judgment that there was \"no violation\" of the \"statutes underpinning\nPlaintiff's complaint,\" and this point of error is accordingly overruled.\n\n     B. Whether the use of public funds to display a racially-offensive historical symbol\n     violates public policy and existing case law.\n\n¶6. Daniels argues that there are \"compelling public policy\" considerations against the display of the\nConfederate Flag at Eight Flags. Specifically, Daniels argues that:\n\n     The message sent by a local government's flying of the Confederate flag serves to chill its\n     African-American citizens' exercise of their right to the franchise and to petition government for\n     redress of grievances.\n\fDaniels submits that the display of the Confederate Flag at Eight Flags is offensive to many residents\nof the Gulf Coast, particularly those of African-American descent. Nevertheless, he fails to cite any\nbasis on which this Court might conclude that the display of this flag is unlawful.\n\n¶7. The only authority cited by Daniels in this point of error is the United States Supreme Court\ndecision in U.S. v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144 (1938), but this decision has little if any\nfactual similarity or relevance to the present case. Moreover, Daniels' argument that the flying of the\nsingle Confederate flag at Eight Flags \"serves to chill its African-American citizens's exercise of their\nright to the franchise and to petition government for redress of grievances\" has been rejected by at\nleast one Federal Court of Appeals in a similar context.\n\n¶8. In NAACP v. Hunt, 891 F.2d 1555 (11th Cir. 1990), the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals\nrejected an attempt by the NAACP to bar the display of the confederate flag by the State of Alabama\nbased upon many of the same Constitutional arguments presented herein. In Hunt, the Court of\nAppeals held that the present issue was a \"political matter,\" the remedy for which lies within the\ndemocratic process ... and the voting rights of all its citizens.\" Hunt, 891 F.2d at 1565. The Eleventh\nCircuit concluded that \"(t)he federal judiciary is not empowered to make decisions based on social\nsensitivity. Because the NAACP has advanced no proof that the flag prohibits its members from\nspeaking or punishes them from speaking, the district court properly granted summary judgment.\" Id.\n\n¶9. As in Hunt, the record in the present case contains no indication that the flying of the single\nConfederate Flag at Eight Flags serves to deprive any citizens of this State of any constitutionally\nprotected right. Daniels is unable to present any applicable constitutional, statutory, or common law\nauthority to support his position. The circuit judge correctly ruled that \"(n)either the Plaintiffs\ndisapproval of the Board's choice of the battle flag to represent the Confederacy, of which Mississippi\nwas undeniably a part, nor their finding the Board's choice offensive, makes the Board's action\nunlawful.\" The ruling of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n¶10. JUDGMENT IS AFFIRMED.\n\nSULLIVAN AND PITTMAN, P.JJ., BANKS, ROBERTS, SMITH, MILLS AND WALLER,\nJJ., CONCUR. McRAE, J., CONCURS IN RESULT ONLY. BANKS, J., SPECIALLY\nCONCURS WITH SEPARATE WRITTEN OPINION.\n\n\n\n\n     BANKS, JUSTICE, SPECIALLY CONCURRING:\n\n¶11. While I agree with the result reached by the majority, I write separately to express my concerns\nregarding the insensitivity inherent in this issue.\n\n¶12. Harrison County, over the apparent objection of some of its citizens, persists in flying the\nConfederate battle flag at a publicly owned facility. According to its brief the battle flag is flown to\nrepresent one of the eight governments which at one time or another claimed sovereignty over the\narea. While of little legal significance, the historical accuracy of this assertion is of some interest.\n\f¶13. The first official flag of the Confederacy was the \"Stars and Bars,\" which was used as the official\nflag from March 1861 to May 1863. On May 1, 1863, a second design was adopted as the official\nflag of the Confederacy. This flag included the battle flag emblem (a/k/a the \"Southern Cross\").\nFinally on March 4, 1865, a short time before the defeat of the Confederacy, a third pattern was\nadopted as the official flag of the Confederate States of America. This flag also included the\n\"Southern Cross\" battle flag emblem, along with a broad bar of red on the fly end of the white field.\nThus, the flying of the Confederate battle flag at \"Eight Flags\" to represent the Confederate States of\nAmerica which presumably claimed sovereignty over that area at some point in time is historically\ninaccurate.\n\n¶14. The Confederate battle flag was \"initially designed as a rallying symbol for Confederate troops\nheading into battle\" to fight for, among other things, the right to continue the institution of slavery.\nSee James Forman, Jr., Driving Dixie Down: Removing the Confederate Flag from Southern State\nCapitols, 101 Yale L.J. 505, 513-14 (1991). Since the defeat of the Confederate States of America,\nthe Confederate battle flag has been used throughout history, not only to commemorate the sacrifices\nmade in support of the cause of the Confederacy, but -- most prominently -- as a symbol of white\nsupremacy.\n\n¶15. Quite recently, many state governments adopted the battle flag as a symbol of continued support\nof white supremacy, segregation and discrimination against persons of black African descent. For\nexample, the Georgia state flag was redesigned to look like the Confederate battle flag following the\nUnited States Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 349 U.S. 294\n(1955). The Confederate battle flag was raised in Alabama in 1963 by Governor Wallace as part of\nhis \"Segregation Forever\" campaign. No \"johnny-come-lately\" by any means, this state adopted the\npresent-day flag which incorporates the Confederate battle flag emblem in 1894, following the\nadoption of the 1890 Constitution which had the purpose and effect of institutionalizing white\nsupremacy.(1)\n\n¶16. Even more recently, notorious and violent white supremacist groups have proudly adopted the\nConfederate battle flag as their symbol. See John M. Glionna, Unfavorite Son, L.A. TIMES, Oct. 30,\n1990, at E1 (Tom Metzger, former Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan and leader of the White\nAryan Resistance who was ordered to pay $12.5 million in damages for his role in the killing of a\nblack man in Oregon flew the Confederate battle flag above his home); Paul W. Valentine, Police\nBoost Security at NAACP, WASH. POST, Jan. 5, 1990, at CI (Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi\nprotestors demonstrating outside the national headquarters of the NAACP carried a Confederate\nbattle flag along with signs saying \"Nuke the NAACP\"); Town Closes Shops to Protest Neo-Nazi\nMarch, L.A. TIMES, Oct. 8, 1989, at A28 (two hundred members of the neo-Nazi, Aryan Nations\norganization carrying Confederate battle flags and wearing Klan robes and Nazi uniforms\ncommemorated Confederate war hero Sam Davis' birthday in Pulaski, Tennessee, the birthplace of\nthe Klan); Ashley Dunn & Jeffrey Miller, \"I Had to Stop it,\" Says Guard Who Held Off Alleged\n\"Skinheads\", L.A. TIMES, June 1, 1989, at B1 (a group of Los Angeles skinheads wearing\nConfederate battle flag tattoos attacked a Middle Eastern couple and baby in a supermarket parking\nlot); Dan Morain & Robert Chow, Rain Dampens Event as Foes Outnumber \"Skinheads\" at Rally,\nL.A. TIMES, Mar. 5, 1989, at A3 (group of fifty white racists and skinheads celebrated an \"Aryan\nWoodstock\"; many wore the Confederate battle flag and other racist and anti-Semitic symbols);\nLouis Sahagun, Marchers in Fontana Fete King, Draw Klan Taunts, L.A. TIMES, Jan. 18, 1988, at\n\fA3 (the Imperial Wizard of the Invisible Empire of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, J.W. Farrands,\nsporting a Confederate battle flag button on his lapel flew from his home in Connecticut to California\nto protest Martin Luther King's birthday); Mary Jordan & Linda Wheeler, 14 Hurt as Anti-Klan\nProtestors Clash with Police, WASH. POST, Oct. 29, 1990, at A1 (members of the Ku Klux Klan\nhave marched from the Washington Monument to the Capital carrying a Confederate battle flag and\nchanting \"We are the KKK\").\n\n¶17. Thus, it is understandable to say the least that there is a large segment of Mississippi's citizenry\nwhich finds the state flag offensive and objectionable. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in\nNAACP v. Hunt, 891 F.2d 1555 (11th Cir. 1990) recognized that \"[c]itizens of all races\" are\noffended by the Confederate battle flag. Id. at 1562. Similarly in Coleman v. Miller, 117 F.3d 527,\n530 (11th Cir. 1997), that same court -- rejecting a group of African Americans' challenge to the\nflying of the flag in Georgia -- stated thusly:\n\n     We recognize that the Georgia flag conveys mixed meanings; to some it honors those who\n     fought in the Civil War and to others it flies as a symbol of oppression. But because the\n     Confederate battle flag emblem offends many Georgians, it has, in our view, no place in the\n     official state flag. We regret that the Georgia legislature has chosen, and continues to display, as\n     an official state symbol a battle flag emblem that divides rather than unifies the citizens of\n     Georgia. . . .\n\n¶18. Some may theorize to the contrary, but the bottom line is that the Confederate battle flag\nconjures up images of and is popularly used to symbolize slavery, white supremacy, racism and\noppression. It takes no back seat to the Nazi Swastika in this regard. Nevertheless, a common\nargument in favor of the flag is that it represents a piece of Southern history that should not be\nforgotten.\n\n¶19. I have no qualms with preserving history. Such symbols as the Confederate flag and the Nazi\nswastika are appropriate in museums, exhibits and the like. I do not believe, however, that it is\nappropriate public policy to continue to fly the Confederate battle flag at government facilities. To\ncontinue to do so under the shibboleth of \"preserving tradition\" readily lends itself to negative\nconnotations that, with good reason, offend a large number of Mississippi citizens -- sending a\nmessage that their feelings do not matter. One can only wonder what role such divisiveness plays in\nthe problems which continue to plague our state.\n\n¶20. That said, I agree with the majority here and the Hunt court that the judiciary is not the avenue to\neffectuate the removal of the Confederate battle flag from public property. Instead, Mr. Daniels and\nothers like him who are compelled to voice their objection to the battle flag should look to the\nlegislature because the legislature is the primary expositor of this state's public policy.(2) If, by its\nchoice of symbols, the legislature announces a public policy of insensitivity to persons still reeling from\nthe effects of hundreds of years of a pernicious system of oppression based upon race, so be it. The\nworld should and will take note.\n\n\n\n\n1. The Mississippi Official and Statistical Register 1996-2000 reports the origin of our state's flag\n\fthusly:\n\n     The committee recommended for the flag \"one with width two-thirds of its length; with the\n     union square, in width two-thirds of the width of the flag; the ground of the union to be red and\n     a broad blue saltier thereon, bordered with white and emblazoned with thirteen mullets or five-\n     pointed stars, corresponding with the number of the original states of the Union.\"\n\n(emphasis added) How many Mississippians are aware of the fact that the thirteen stars on the\nMississippi flag purportedly represent, not the states of the Confederacy, but the original thirteen\nstates of the Union?\n\n2. Some administrative and legislative bodies have taken action with respect to this flag. Notably the\nadministration at the University of Mississippi has made it clear that the confederate battle flag has no\nofficial status at the University of Mississippi and has taken steps to discourage its continued use by\nalumni and others at the University of Mississippi functions. Similarly, the Jackson Municipal\nSeparate School District school board removed the rebel flag as a symbol for one of its high schools\nseveral years ago.\n\f",

The circuit judge correctly ruled that \"(n)either the Plaintiffs\ndisapproval of the Board's choice of the battle flag to represent the Confederacy, of which Mississippi\nwas undeniably a part, nor their finding the Board's choice offensive, makes the Board's action\nunlawful.\" The ruling of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n¶10. JUDGMENT IS AFFIRMED.\n\nSULLIVAN AND PITTMAN, P.JJ., BANKS, ROBERTS, SMITH, MILLS AND WALLER,\nJJ., CONCUR. McRAE, J., CONCURS IN RESULT ONLY. BANKS, J., SPECIALLY\nCONCURS WITH SEPARATE WRITTEN OPINION.\n\n\n\n\n     BANKS, JUSTICE, SPECIALLY CONCURRING:\n\n¶11. While I agree with the result reached by the majority, I write separately to express my concerns\nregarding the insensitivity inherent in this issue.\n\n¶12. Harrison County, over the apparent objection of some of its citizens, persists in flying the\nConfederate battle flag at a publicly owned facility. According to its brief the battle flag is flown to\nrepresent one of the eight governments which at one time or another claimed sovereignty over the\narea. While of little legal significance, the historical accuracy of this assertion is of some interest.\n\f¶13. The first official flag of the Confederacy was the \"Stars and Bars,\" which was used as the official\nflag from March 1861 to May 1863. On May 1, 1863, a second design was adopted as the official\nflag of the Confederacy. This flag included the battle flag emblem (a/k/a the \"Southern Cross\").\nFinally on March 4, 1865, a short time before the defeat of the Confederacy, a third pattern was\nadopted as the official flag of the Confederate States of America. This flag also included the\n\"Southern Cross\" battle flag emblem, along with a broad bar of red on the fly end of the white field.\nThus, the flying of the Confederate battle flag at \"Eight Flags\" to represent the Confederate States of\nAmerica which presumably claimed sovereignty over that area at some point in time is historically\ninaccurate.\n\n¶14. The Confederate battle flag was \"initially designed as a rallying symbol for Confederate troops\nheading into battle\" to fight for, among other things, the right to continue the institution of slavery.\nSee James Forman, Jr., Driving Dixie Down: Removing the Confederate Flag from Southern State\nCapitols, 101 Yale L.J. 505, 513-14 (1991). Since the defeat of the Confederate States of America,\nthe Confederate battle flag has been used throughout history, not only to commemorate the sacrifices\nmade in support of the cause of the Confederacy, but -- most prominently -- as a symbol of white\nsupremacy.\n\n¶15. Quite recently, many state governments adopted the battle flag as a symbol of continued support\nof white supremacy, segregation and discrimination against persons of black African descent. For\nexample, the Georgia state flag was redesigned to look like the Confederate battle flag following the\nUnited States Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105312\"><a href=\"/opinion/105312/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">349</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1955). The Confederate battle flag was raised in Alabama in 1963 by Governor Wallace as part of\nhis \"Segregation Forever\" campaign. No \"johnny-come-lately\" by any means, this state adopted the\npresent-day flag which incorporates the Confederate battle flag emblem in 1894, following the\nadoption of the 1890 Constitution which had the purpose and effect of institutionalizing white\nsupremacy.(1)\n\n¶16. Even more recently, notorious and violent white supremacist groups have proudly adopted the\nConfederate battle flag as their symbol. See John M. Glionna, Unfavorite Son, L.A. TIMES, Oct. 30,\n1990, at E1 (Tom Metzger, former Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan and leader of the White\nAryan Resistance who was ordered to pay $12.5 million in damages for his role in the killing of a\nblack man in Oregon flew the Confederate battle flag above his home); Paul W. Valentine, Police\nBoost Security at NAACP, WASH. POST, Jan. 5, 1990, at CI (Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi\nprotestors demonstrating outside the national headquarters of the NAACP carried a Confederate\nbattle flag along with signs saying \"Nuke the NAACP\"); Town Closes Shops to Protest Neo-Nazi\nMarch, L.A. TIMES, Oct. 8, 1989, at A28 (two hundred members of the neo-Nazi, Aryan Nations\norganization carrying Confederate battle flags and wearing Klan robes and Nazi uniforms\ncommemorated Confederate war hero Sam Davis' birthday in Pulaski, Tennessee, the birthplace of\nthe Klan); Ashley Dunn & Jeffrey Miller, \"I Had to Stop it,\" Says Guard Who Held Off Alleged\n\"Skinheads\", L.A. TIMES, June 1, 1989, at B1 (a group of Los Angeles skinheads wearing\nConfederate battle flag tattoos attacked a Middle Eastern couple and baby in a supermarket parking\nlot); Dan Morain & Robert Chow, Rain Dampens Event as Foes Outnumber \"Skinheads\" at Rally,\nL.A. TIMES, Mar. 5, 1989, at A3 (group of fifty white racists and skinheads celebrated an \"Aryan\nWoodstock\"; many wore the Confederate battle flag and other racist and anti-Semitic symbols);\nLouis Sahagun, Marchers in Fontana Fete King, Draw Klan Taunts, L.A. TIMES, Jan. 18, 1988, at\n\fA3 (the Imperial Wizard of the Invisible Empire of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, J.W.

POST, Oct. 29, 1990, at A1 (members of the Ku Klux Klan\nhave marched from the Washington Monument to the Capital carrying a Confederate battle flag and\nchanting \"We are the KKK\").\n\n¶17. Thus, it is understandable to say the least that there is a large segment of Mississippi's citizenry\nwhich finds the state flag offensive and objectionable. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in\nNAACP v. Hunt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533854\"><a href=\"/opinion/533854/national-association-for-the-advancement-of-colored-people-naacp-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1555</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir. 1990) recognized that \"[c]itizens of all races\" are\noffended by the Confederate battle flag. Id. at 1562. Similarly in Coleman v. Miller, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"71901\"><a href=\"/opinion/71901/coleman-v-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n530 (11th Cir. 1997), that same court -- rejecting a group of African Americans' challenge to the\nflying of the flag in Georgia -- stated thusly:\n\n     We recognize that the Georgia flag conveys mixed meanings; to some it honors those who\n     fought in the Civil War and to others it flies as a symbol of oppression. But because the\n     Confederate battle flag emblem offends many Georgians, it has, in our view, no place in the\n     official state flag. We regret that the Georgia legislature has chosen, and continues to display, as\n     an official state symbol a battle flag emblem that divides rather than unifies the citizens of\n     Georgia. . . .\n\n¶18. Some may theorize to the contrary, but the bottom line is that the Confederate battle flag\nconjures up images of and is popularly used to symbolize slavery, white supremacy, racism and\noppression. It takes no back seat to the Nazi Swastika in this regard. Nevertheless, a common\nargument in favor of the flag is that it represents a piece of Southern history that should not be\nforgotten.\n\n¶19. I have no qualms with preserving history. Such symbols as the Confederate flag and the Nazi\nswastika are appropriate in museums, exhibits and the like. I do not believe, however, that it is\nappropriate public policy to continue to fly the Confederate battle flag at government facilities. To\ncontinue to do so under the shibboleth of \"preserving tradition\" readily lends itself to negative\nconnotations that, with good reason, offend a large number of Mississippi citizens -- sending a\nmessage that their feelings do not matter. One can only wonder what role such divisiveness plays in\nthe problems which continue to plague our state.\n\n¶20. That said, I agree with the majority here and the Hunt court that the judiciary is not the avenue to\neffectuate the removal of the Confederate battle flag from public property. Instead, Mr. Daniels and\nothers like him who are compelled to voice their objection to the battle flag should look to the\nlegislature because the legislature is the primary expositor of this state's public policy.(2) If, by its\nchoice of symbols, the legislature announces a public policy of insensitivity to persons still reeling from\nthe effects of hundreds of years of a pernicious system of oppression based upon race, so be it. The\nworld should and will take note.\n\n\n\n\n1. The Mississippi Official and Statistical Register 1996-2000 reports the origin of our state's flag\n\fthusly:\n\n     The committee recommended for the flag \"one with width two-thirds of its length; with the\n     union square, in width two-thirds of the width of the flag; the ground of the union to be red and\n     a broad blue saltier thereon, bordered with white and emblazoned with thirteen mullets or five-\n     pointed stars, corresponding with the number of the original states of the Union.\"\n\n(emphasis added) How many Mississippians are aware of the fact that the thirteen stars on the\nMississippi flag purportedly represent, not the states of the Confederacy, but the original thirteen\nstates of the Union?\n\n2. Some administrative and legislative bodies have taken action with respect to this flag. Notably the\nadministration at the University of Mississippi has made it clear that the confederate battle flag has no\nofficial status at the University of Mississippi and has taken steps to discourage its continued use by\nalumni and others at the University of Mississippi functions. Similarly, the Jackson Municipal\nSeparate School District school board removed the rebel flag as a symbol for one of its high schools\nseveral years ago.\n\f</pre>",
