On July 6, 2004, Mr. Freeman was the subject of a\n\ndisciplinary hearing at CSP for events that took place at FCF. He was found guilty of\n\n\n\n       * This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of\nlaw of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its\npersuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.\n\fassault on a guard and sanctioned with the loss of 45 days of good time credits, 90 days\n\nof lost privileges, and $1,626.20 in restitution.1\n\n       After pursuing his state court remedies, Mr. Freeman filed a 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\naction in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado against the hearing\n\nboard members—Lts. Charles Tappe, Brian Braden, and Betty Riggin—and John Carroll,\n\nthe staff member assigned as a staff substitute for an inmate representative at the\n\ndisciplinary hearing (collectively “Defendants”). In several orders, the district court\n\ngranted summary judgment in favor of the Defendants.\n\n       On appeal, Mr. Freeman argues that the district court erred in (1) concluding that\n\nhe was not denied due process at his disciplinary hearing, and (2) refusing to grant his\n\nmotion to reopen discovery. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, we affirm.\n\n                                  I.     BACKGROUND\n\n       A. Factual Background\n\n              1. June 26, 2004 Incident\n\n       Mr. Freeman has served over 30 years of a 40-year-to-life sentence. On June 26,\n\n2004, an incident occurred between Mr. Freeman and Officer Maria Bork at FCF.\n\nOfficer Bork’s report, according to the notice of charges, stated:\n\n\n       1\n         He was also found guilty of and sanctioned for tampering with a lock or a\nsecurity device. On December 18, 2008, the Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed the\nassault conviction but overturned the tampering conviction. See Freeman v. Watkins, No.\n08CA0423 (Colo. App. Dec. 18, 2008). The tampering conviction is not at issue on\nappeal.\n\n                                              --\n                                              2\n\f              On Saturday, June 26, 2004, at approximately 1:25 p.m.,\n              Officer Maria Bork observed an inmate leaving the cell\n              assigned to [Mr. Freeman and another inmate]. The inmate\n              exiting the cell had something under his shirt. Officer Bork\n              approached the cell and saw that there were (3) inmates still\n              in the cell, including [Mr. Freeman] and (2) visiting inmates.\n              Officer Bork asked the visitors to leave the cell and they\n              complied. [Officer] Bork then entered the cell and asked [Mr.\n              Freeman] what was in the box. [Mr. Freeman] became\n              agitated[,] stating “You guys just want to take all my fucking\n              things.” [Officer] Bork then tried to calm [Mr. Freeman]\n              down and asked him to come to the operations office to\n              discuss the contents of the box. [Mr. Freeman] then came\n              toward [Officer] Bork with the box and forcibly shoved the\n              box at her, striking her in the chest. [Mr. Freeman] then took\n              an aggressive posture, yelling and clenching his fists at her.\n              [Officer] Bork then attempted to disengage by exiting the cell\n              and ordering [Mr. Freeman] to stay in the cell. As [Officer]\n              Bork closed the cell door with her key set, [Mr. Freeman]\n              blocked the door from closing with his body and exited the\n              cell. [Officer] Bork raised up her right hand at [Mr.\n              Freeman’s] stomach-level to stop his attack. [Mr. Freeman]\n              then pushed her with his body into the 2nd tier railing\n              fronting the cell, causing Officer Bork’s back to strike the\n              railing with considerable force. [Mr. Freeman] then left the\n              area. [Officer Bork] followed and observed [Mr. Freeman]\n              next to the [Cell House 8] entry talking to Sgts. Bell and\n              McMorran. She immediately reported what had transpired\n              earlier and that [Mr. Freeman] needed to cuff up. [Mr.\n              Freeman] then lunged toward [Officer] Bork in an aggressive\n              manner and Sgt. McMorran stepped between [Mr. Freeman]\n              and [Officer] Bork. [Mr. Freeman’s] left hand was cuffed by\n              [Officer] Bork when he pulled away from her, causing injury\n              to her right hand. Security staff responded and finally\n              restrained [Mr. Freeman’s] right hand. [Mr. Freeman] was\n              then escorted out of the area by security staff and placed on\n              RFP status.\n\nROA at 370.\n\n     Mr. Freeman’s account of the incident is different. In a declaration prepared for\n                                            --\n                                            3\n\fthe district court, he stated: Officer Bork confronted him about a box of art supplies that\n\nanother inmate had left in his cell. Officer Bork told him to give her the box. He handed\n\nit to her, and she then put her hand up to his chest to stop him from leaving his cell and\n\nused her security key to close his cell door. He lived in a cell block where he was free to\n\ncome and go, except at night, so he waited five seconds for the locking mechanism to\n\nreset and then pushed a button to open the cell door. As he left his cell, he walked around\n\nOfficer Bork, who was standing to the side of the doorway, and went downstairs. He\n\nsaid, “At no point did I make any contact with Officer Bork.” Id. at 373.\n\n       Mr. Freeman also declared: He was speaking with two other officers when Officer\n\nBork left the Cell House office and ordered him to let her handcuff him. As she put the\n\nhandcuff on his left wrist, it became so tight that he “accidentally pulled [his] hand away\n\nfrom the position it was in.” Id. at 373. Officer Bork had already called for security, so\n\nhe told her that he would wait for security to finish cuffing him. Security officers took\n\nhim to the security office and then to solitary confinement. Mr. Freeman was in solitary\n\nconfinement for only 10 minutes before he was taken to another office, strip-searched,\n\nand then transported to CSP. For the next 18 days, he “had no access to the phones,\n\nletter-writing materials, or any other means of communication.” Id. at 376.\n\n              2. Notice of Charges\n\n       On July 2, 2004, Mr. Freeman was served with a Colorado Department of\n\nCorrections (“CDOC”) Notice of Charges, which charged him with assault and recited\n\nOfficer Bork’s summary of the event. No witnesses were identified in the space\n                                             --\n                                             4\n\fprovided. Officer Bork and Lt. Darryl Directo, the disciplinary officer assigned to\n\ninvestigate the case, signed the notice to “certify that [the] charges and summary are true\n\nand correct.” Id. at 370.\n\n       The notice advised Mr. Freeman, “If you desire witnesses, in accordance with the\n\nCode of Penal Discipline, please notify the Reviewing Supervisor as soon as possible, but\n\nno later than 24 hours prior to scheduled hearing, to avoid a continuance.” Id. Mr.\n\nFreeman checked the box indicating that he wanted an inmate representative. In the\n\nspace following “Name of representative,” someone typed, “If representation is desired,\n\nreport to hearing 10 minutes early.” Id.\n\n                3. July 6, 2004 Hearing\n\n       In his declaration for the district court, Mr. Freeman stated that he was escorted to\n\nthe hearing less than five minutes before it started and was introduced to John Carroll, a\n\nCDOC case manager, who would serve as his inmate representative. Mr. Freeman also\n\nstated that he told Mr. Carroll he wanted to call certain witnesses. Mr. Carroll responded,\n\naccording to Mr. Freeman, that he was there to help protect Mr. Freeman’s rights, not to\n\nadvocate on his behalf.\n\n       The hearing board consisted of Lts. Charles Tappe, Brian Braden, and Betty\n\nRiggin.2 The board advised Mr. Freeman of his right to request representation, witnesses,\n\nand continuances, as well as his right to remain silent. The board asked if he understood\n\n\n       2\n           At the time of the hearing, Lt. Betty Fulton.\n\n                                               --\n                                               5\n\f“the charges against [him], as they are defined by the Code of Penal Discipline and the\n\npossible sanctions if [he was] found guilty,” and he responded that he did. Id. at 386-87.\n\nThe chair then read the charges and asked whether Mr. Freeman understood them. Mr.\n\nFreeman responded that he did. The chair also stated that the sanctions for assault are up\n\nto 90 days of lost privileges, 30 days of punitive segregation, and 45 days of lost good\n\ntime.\n\n        After the chair noted that Mr. Freeman had requested an inmate representative but\n\nnot witnesses when he was served the notice, Mr. Freeman responded that he had\n\nrequested witnesses. The chair told Mr. Freeman that he could request witnesses while\n\ngiving his testimony. The chair asked whether Mr. Freeman understood, but the\n\ntranscript states there was no audible response. When the chair asked Mr. Freeman how\n\nhe pled, he responded not guilty. The chair then swore in Lt. Directo and directed him to\n\npresent the department’s case.\n\n        Lt. Directo related the incident and charges as they were stated in the Notice of\n\nCharges. He also testified that Officer Bork sought medical treatment. The chair\n\ndirected that a letter from a CDOC risk management case manager, stating the costs to\n\ndate for Officer Bork’s medical treatment, be shown to Mr. Freeman.\n\n        After Lt. Directo finished, the chair told Mr. Freeman that he could make a\n\nstatement regarding his plea, “ask for witnesses to present evidence[,] or give testimony\n\nif you wish.” Id. at 392-93. Mr. Freeman responded that he would “like to talk to some\n\nwitnesses first.” Id. at 393. There was a long pause. Then, apparently referring to the\n                                              --\n                                              6\n\fletter stating the costs for Officer Bork’s treatment that had been handed to him, Mr.\n\nFreeman said, “This here doesn’t say what injuries were caused. She could have got in a\n\ncar accident or something.” Id. The chair responded, “Go ahead and present your case\n\nthen, Mr. Freeman.” Id.\n\n       Mr. Freeman related his version of the incident and tried to point out problems\n\nwith the case against him. He stated that he “never initiated any forceful or passive\n\ncontact or any physical contact with” Officer Bork. Id. He asked why, if Officer Bork\n\nsaw another inmate leave his cell with something hidden under his shirt, she had not\n\nstopped that inmate to investigate. He stated that, given their size difference, Officer\n\nBork would have been in the hospital if he had pushed her. He also told the board that, if\n\nhe had done all Officer Bork said, he would not have turned around and let her cuff him\n\nup when she told him to.\n\n       The chair interrupted Mr. Freeman when he began talking about the difficulty\n\nofficers later had in removing the handcuffs. The chair told him that he had gone beyond\n\nthe incident in question and that the tightness of the cuffs had no bearing on the case. Mr.\n\nFreeman stated that he was trying to explain why he turned around while being cuffed\n\nand that Officer Bork could not be believed. The chair then repeatedly told Mr. Freeman\n\nthat he had described the pain that he felt from the tightness of the cuffs and to move on,\n\nfinally telling him that if he continued the board would cut him off completely. The chair\n\ndirected Mr. Carroll to explain to him that he needed to move on.\n\n       Mr. Freeman next attempted to discredit Lt. Directo’s investigation by asking him\n                                             --\n                                             7\n\fif he had spoken to any of the inmates who witnessed the incident. Lt. Directo responded\n\nthat he had not. Mr. Freeman again asked him, and Lt. Directo stated, “I asked the staff\n\nthat were involved. I completed my investigation. That’s why you are getting charged\n\nwith this.” Id. at 400. Mr. Freeman then asked if he spoke with Lance Spurlock, a\n\nCDOC staff member, and Lt. Directo admitted that he had not.3\n\n       Asked if he had anything else to present, Mr. Freeman requested polygraph tests\n\nfor himself and Officer Bork. He asked why, if he had pushed Officer Bork so hard, the\n\npaints had not spilled out of the box she was holding and why she had not pushed the\n\npanic button like she was supposed to do.\n\n       The chair again asked if Mr. Freeman had anything else to present, and Mr.\n\nFreeman responded that he did not.\n\n       After conferencing with one another, the board found Mr. Freeman guilty of\n\nassault for pushing Officer Bork into a railing, pushing the box into her chest, and pulling\n\naway from her while she was trying to handcuff him. It explained that its decision was\n\n“based on the report by [Officer] Bork, presentation by Lieutenant Directo and by your\n\nown statements.” Id. at 404. It then imposed $1,626.20 in restitution for the injuries\n\nsustained by Officer Bork, a 90-day loss of privileges, and a 45-day loss of good time.\n\n       The board later issued a written Disposition of Charges in which it found Mr.\n\nFreeman guilty of assault for the same conduct as in the oral disposition. The written\n\n       3\n       In his opening brief, Mr. Freeman explains that he anticipated that Officer\nSpurlock would testify to having heard Officer Bork plotting to get Freeman.\n\n                                             --\n                                             8\n\fdisposition listed as supporting evidence Officer Bork’s written statement, Lt. Directo’s\n\npresentation, and Mr. Freeman’s testimony. As the reasons for the penalties, it stated,\n\n“The seriousness of the assault; the assault was on staff and staff was injured.” Id. at 410.\n\n       Mr. Freeman appealed to the Colorado state district court, which affirmed the\n\nconviction and sentence. On December 18, 2008, the Colorado Court of Appeals\n\naffirmed the assault conviction.\n\n       B. Procedural History\n\n       On March 8, 2006, Mr. Freeman filed a complaint based on 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in\n\nthe United States District Court for the District of Colorado, alleging constitutional\n\nviolations related to this and other hearings at FCF and CSP. On August 28, 2006, the\n\ndistrict court dismissed the complaint for failure to plead exhaustion of administrative\n\nremedies. Due to an intervening change in law, the Tenth Circuit vacated the judgment\n\nand remanded the case for further proceedings.\n\n              1. District Court’s May 4, 2010 Order\n\n       On May 4, 2010, the district court made three rulings in response to a motion for\n\nsummary judgment by the Defendants.\n\n       First, the court noted that Mr. Freeman had “not specified whether he is asserting\n\nhis claims against the Defendants in their individual or official capacities.” Id. at 204. It\n\nliberally construed the pleadings, “assum[ing] that Mr. Freeman intended to assert both\n\ntypes of claims.” Id. The court concluded, however, that “no official capacity claims are\n\ncognizable” because “Mr. Freeman’s claims are based on discrete acts and because he\n                                              --\n                                              9\n\fseeks no specific prospective remedy.” Id. The court therefore considered all the claims\n\nas brought against the Defendants in their individual capacities. The court also dismissed\n\nall individual capacity claims in which Mr. Freeman had not shown personal participation\n\nby a defendant.\n\n       Second, the district court denied the motion seeking summary judgment for Mr.\n\nCarroll on the claim that Mr. Carroll had deprived Mr. Freeman of his right to call\n\nwitnesses while acting as his inmate representative. The court also concluded that Mr.\n\nCarroll was not entitled to qualified immunity. The court later reversed course and\n\ndismissed Mr. Carroll.\n\n       Third, the court concluded there was insufficient evidence to support a prima facie\n\nclaim against Lts. Tappe, Braden, and Riggin. “[B]ecause Mr. Carroll allegedly did not\n\nadvise the hearing officers of Mr. Freeman’s desire to call witnesses, the hearing officers\n\ncannot reasonably he held liable for failing to afford [him] a procedural protection they\n\nwere not aware he had requested.” Id. at 213.\n\n       Following these rulings, the only remaining defendant was Mr. Carroll, to be\n\nrejoined later by Lts. Tappe, Braden, and Riggin.\n\n              2. Reinstatement of Claims Against Hearing Board Members\n\n       On January 5, 2011, Mr. Freeman filed a Rule 60(b)(1) motion for relief from\n\njudgment. He argued that the district court had erred in finding that he had failed to\n\nallege that the hearing board members were personally involved in the deprivation of Mr.\n\nFreeman’s rights. Given this mistake of fact, he requested that the court reinstate Lts.\n                                             --\n                                             10\n\fTappen, Braden, and Riggin as parties.\n\n       On March 4, 2011, the district court concluded it had mistakenly determined that\n\nthere were no allegations of Lts. Tappe, Braden, and Riggin’s personal participation in\n\nthe deprivation of his rights. Accordingly, the district court granted Mr. Freeman’s\n\nmotion, reinstating the claim against them for the denial of due process at the July 6\n\ndisciplinary hearing.\n\n              3. District Court’s January 18, 2012 Order\n\n       On May 17, 2011, Mr. Freeman moved for summary judgment. On May 20, 2011,\n\nthe defendants filed an amended motion to dismiss. On November 18, 2011, the district\n\ncourt denied Mr. Freeman’s motion for summary judgment. The court also stated that the\n\nevidence appeared to be insufficient for Mr. Freeman to establish his prima facie case and\n\nthat there appeared to be no genuine issues of material fact to be resolved at trial. It\n\ntherefore ordered him to present additional evidence demonstrating a prima facie case or\n\notherwise to show cause why the court should not enter summary judgment. Mr.\n\nFreeman responded to the order with exhibits, and he requested additional time to\n\nconduct discovery pursuant to Rule 56(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n       On January 18, 2012, the district court denied Mr. Freeman’s request for further\n\ndiscovery: (1) it doubted that he was a non-movant who could make a Rule 56(d)\n\nmotion, as he had brought the motion for summary judgment; and (2) Mr. Freeman\n\nsought to discover evidence outside the context of the July 6, 2004 hearing, and there was\n\nno showing that such discovery was related to his due process rights during the hearing.\n                                              --\n                                              11\n\f       As will be discussed in further detail below, the district court also concluded that\n\nMr. Freeman had not presented sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case for his\n\ndue process claims and therefore granted summary judgment in favor of the hearing\n\nboard defendants and Mr. Carroll.\n\n                                     II.    DISCUSSION\n\n       Mr. Freeman appeals regarding two issues. First, he argues that the district court\n\nerred in granting summary judgment on his due process claim arising from the July 6,\n\n2004 hearing. Second, he argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to\n\nreopen discovery after the court filed an order to show cause.\n\n       A. Official Capacity and Individual Capacity Claims\n\n       Before reaching the due process and discovery issues, we first address whether\n\nany official capacity claims are at issue on appeal. In its May 2010 order, the district\n\ncourt concluded “that no official capacity claims are cognizable” in this case “because\n\nMr. Freeman’s claims are based on discrete acts and because he seeks no specific\n\nprospective remedy.” Id. at 204. The district court therefore considered all claims to be\n\nagainst the Defendants in their individual capacities. We can find nothing in the district\n\ncourt’s subsequent orders indicating that it reinstated the official capacity claims.\n\n       In his notice of appeal from the January 2012 summary judgment order and final\n\njudgment, Mr. Freeman stated that he is “appeal[ing] from any and all orders antecedent\n\nand ancillary thereto.” Id. at 692. In the conclusion of his opening brief, he requests that\n\nwe reverse the district court’s grant of summary judgment against CDOC Executive\n                                             --\n                                             12\n\fDirector Tom Clements in his official capacity and against the Defendants in their\n\nindividual and official capacities. In his reply brief, Mr. Freeman again states that he is\n\nmaking a claim against Mr. Clements in his official capacity and against the Defendants\n\nin their official and individual capacities. At oral argument, he asserted that he was\n\nmaking official capacity claims for injunctive relief—reversal of the restitution order and\n\nthe return of the funds taken from his prison account—and individual capacity claims for\n\nmonetary damages from the Defendants.\n\n       A party waives an issue when he or she fails to raise it in an opening brief.\n\nAnderson v. U.S. Dep’t of Labor, 422 F.3d 1155, 1174 (10th Cir. 2005); see also Adams-\n\nArapahoe Joint Sch. Dist. No. 28-J v. Cont’l Ins. Co., 891 F.2d 772, 776 (10th Cir. 1989)\n\n(“An issue not included in either the docketing statement or the statement of issues in the\n\nparty’s initial brief is waived on appeal. . . . Merely mentioning inherent defects in\n\nanother context is not enough.”). A party also waives an issue by raising it insufficiently\n\nin an opening brief. San Juan Citizens Alliance v. Stiles, 654 F.3d 1038, 1056 (10th Cir.\n\n2011). “Arguments raised in a perfunctory manner . . . are waived.” United States v.\n\nHardman, 297 F.3d 1116, 1131 (10th Cir. 2002).\n\n       Mr. Freeman has not sufficiently raised the issue of whether there are any official\n\ncapacity claims, much less argued it. He asserts that he is making official capacity\n\nclaims. But he fails to argue in his briefs that the district court erred in dismissing the\n\nofficial capacity claims for failure to state a prospective remedy. Mr. Freeman has\n\nthereby waived the argument on appeal that the district court erred in dismissing the\n                                              --\n                                              13\n\fofficial capacity claims. We therefore review Mr. Freeman’s remaining claims against\n\nthe Defendants in their individual capacities only.\n\n       B. Legal Background on Due Process in Prison Disciplinary Hearings\n\n       Although a prisoner’s “rights may be diminished by the needs and exigencies of\n\nthe institutional environment, a prisoner is not wholly stripped of constitutional\n\nprotections when he is imprisoned for crime.” Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 555\n\n(1974). “[Prisoners] may not be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process\n\nof law,” but their due process rights are “subject to restrictions imposed by the nature of\n\nthe regime to which they have been lawfully committed.” Id. at 556. “[T]he full panoply\n\nof rights due a defendant in [criminal] proceedings does not apply.” Id. at 556; see also\n\nGrossman v. Bruce, 447 F.3d 801, 804-05 (10th Cir. 2006) (prisoners are entitled to some\n\ndue process in prison disciplinary proceedings, but not the full panoply of rights of a\n\ncriminal prosecution).\n\n       Due process requires that an inmate\n\n              receive: (1) advance written notice of the disciplinary\n              charges; (2) an opportunity, when consistent with institutional\n              safety and correctional goals, to call witnesses and present\n              documentary evidence in his defense; and (3) a written\n              statement by the factfinder of the evidence relied on and the\n              reasons for the disciplinary action.\n\nSuperintendent, Mass. Corr. Inst., Walpole v. Hill, 472 U.S. 445, 454 (1985) (citing\n\nWolff, 418 U.S. at 563-67). In addition, “the minimum requirements of procedural due\n\nprocess” demand that “the findings of the prison disciplinary board are supported by\n\n                                             --\n                                             14\n\fsome evidence in the record.” Id.; see also Howard v. U.S. Bureau of Prisons, 487 F.3d\n\n808, 812 (10th Cir. 2007).\n\n       The Supreme Court said in Wolff that it was “not prepared to hold that inmates\n\nhave a right to either retained or appointed counsel in disciplinary proceedings.” 418\n\nU.S. at 570. Nevertheless, “[w]here an illiterate inmate is involved,” or where “the\n\ncomplexity of the issue makes it unlikely that [an] inmate will be able to collect and\n\npresent the evidence necessary for an adequate comprehension of the case, he should be\n\nfree to seek the aid of a fellow inmate.” Id. If a prisoner is not allowed to seek the aid of\n\na fellow inmate, he should be given “adequate substitute aid in the form of help from the\n\nstaff or from a sufficiently competent inmate designated by the staff.” Id.\n\n       C. Summary Judgment on Due Process\n\n       Mr. Freeman argues that his due process rights were violated due to (1) inadequate\n\nnotice of the restitution penalty; (2) insufficient evidence; (3) an inadequate written\n\nstatement explaining the board’s decision; (4) his not being allowed to present witnesses;\n\nand (5) inadequate assistance of counsel.\n\n       We review de novo a district court’s decision to grant summary judgment,\n\napplying the same standards the district court should apply. E.E.O.C. v. C.R. England,\n\n644 F.3d 1028, 1037 (10th Cir. 2011). A court “shall grant summary judgment if the\n\nmovant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). “[W]e construe all facts\n\nand reasonable inferences in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party.” Champagne\n                                             --\n                                             15\n\fMetals v. Ken-Mac Metals, Inc., 458 F.3d 1073, 1078 (10th Cir. 2006) (quotations\n\nomitted).\n\n              1. Notice of the Restitution Penalty\n\n       Mr. Freeman asserts that his advance written notice of the disciplinary charges\n\nwas constitutionally deficient because it did not inform him of the possible sanctions for\n\nthose charges. The district court rejected this claim. It explained that, under Wolff, the\n\npurpose of notice “is to give the charged party a chance to marshal the facts in his\n\ndefense and to clarify what the charges are.” See Wolff, 418 U.S. at 564. Written notice\n\nmust be given at least 24 hours before the hearing “to inform [the defendant] of the\n\ncharges and to enable him to marshal the facts and prepare a defense.” Id. The district\n\ncourt noted that advance notice of possible sanctions is not one of the explicit\n\nrequirements of Wolff.\n\n       Neither Wolff nor Hill states that due process requires notice of potential sanctions\n\nin addition to notice of the disciplinary charges. On appeal, Mr. Freeman cites to\n\nMcMillan v. Healey, 739 F. Supp. 153 (S.D.N.Y. 1990), which held that, although\n\ninmates do not have to be informed of potential penalties prior to misconduct, “failure to\n\nnotify an inmate, after he has been charged with misconduct, of the potential penalties\n\nthat could be imposed for that misconduct,” violates due process. Id. at 157.\n\n       Few courts have followed McMillan in requiring such notice. For example, a\n\nfederal court in Indiana granted defendants qualified immunity, noting that McMillan was\n\nthe only case holding that there is a due process right to notice of potential penalties. See\n                                             --\n                                             16\n\fHiggason v. Swihart, CIV. 3:93-CV-805AS, 1995 WL 358769, at *8-9 (N.D. Ind. May\n\n11, 1995); see also Jolley v. Wezner, CV 970407988S, 1999 WL 509810, at *5 (Conn.\n\nSuper. Ct. July 6, 1999) (“The ruling in McMillan v. Healey, has not been widely used\n\nand goes beyond the minimum requirements set forth in Wolff v. McDonnell.”).\n\n       No federal circuit court has recognized a right to notice of penalties in prison\n\ndisciplinary hearings. In an unpublished decision, we held that “notice of potential\n\npenalties is not one of the requirements of due process.” White v. Golder, 245 F. App’x.\n\n763, 764 (10th Cir. 2007) (unpublished) (cited only for persuasive value, Fed. R. App. P.\n\n32.1; 10th Cir. R. 32.1(A)). In the absence of clearly established authority that Mr.\n\nFreeman was entitled to notice of potential sanctions, the board defendants are protected\n\nby qualified immunity from § 1983 liability. See Currier v. Doran, 242 F.3d 905, 923\n\n(10th Cir. 2001).4\n\n              2. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n       Mr. Freeman continues to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support the\n\ndisciplinary board’s determination. We review “the findings of [a] prison disciplinary\n\nboard” for “some evidence.” Howard v. U.S. Bureau of Prisons, 487 F.3d 808, 812 (10th\n\nCir. 2007) (quoting Hill, 472 U.S. at 454). Review under this standard “does not require\n\nexamination of the entire record, independent assessment of the credibility of witnesses,\n\nor weighing of the evidence.” Id. (quotations omitted). Rather, the court evaluates\n\n       4\n       We note that the district court pointed to the Colorado Code of Penal Discipline,\nwhich provides for restitution as a possible sanction.\n\n                                             --\n                                             17\n\f“whether there is any evidence that could support the conclusion reached by the\n\ndisciplinary board.” Id. (quotations omitted). “A disciplinary board’s decision can be\n\nupheld . . . even if the evidence supporting the decision is meager.” Id. (quotations\n\nomitted). Here, the district court concluded that the evidence in Mr. Freeman’s hearing\n\nmet the “some evidence” requirement. See Hill, 472 U.S. at 455 (stating that\n\nrequirements of due process are “met if there was some evidence from which the\n\nconclusion of the administrative tribunal could be deduced” (quotations omitted)).\n\n       On appeal, Mr. Freeman argues that “[m]ere accusations unsupported by any\n\nadditional evidence do not constitute ‘some evidence.’” Aplt. Br. at 19 (quoting Moore v.\n\nPlaster, 266 F.3d 928, 931-32 (8th Cir. 2001) (conduct violation report containing\n\naccusations but not based on prison officer’s personal knowledge and not listing any\n\nwitnesses is not evidence). He asserts that other circuits—including the Second Circuit in\n\nLuna v. Pico, 356 F.3d 481, 488 (2d Cir. 2004)—have found disciplinary convictions\n\ninvalid when the evidence is unreliable. He also cites Taylor v. Wallace, 931 F.2d 698\n\n(10th Cir. 1991), for the proposition that “indicia of reliability” are particularly important\n\nin disciplinary hearings given the limited due process rights required. Id. at 702. In\n\nTaylor, we held “that the testimony of confidential informants cannot be given any\n\nweight absent a determination made by the prison staff that indicated that the informant\n\nwas reliable.” Id. at 701.\n\n       Mr. Freeman’s reliance on cases like Luna and Taylor is misplaced. His case\n\nlacks the levels of hearsay involved in Luna, where the inmate victim refused to testify.\n                                              --\n                                              18\n\f356 F.3d at 484. In Luna, the disciplinary determination was based on a misbehavior\n\nreport prepared by a prison officer using information provided by another prison officer\n\nwho had spoken with the victim. Id. at 489. The officer preparing the report never spoke\n\nwith the inmate victim and had no idea if the victim was telling the truth, and the officer\n\nwho had spoken with the inmate victim was not called as a witness. Id. Taylor and other\n\ncases Mr. Freeman cites for support involve accusations by a confidential informant,5 and\n\nthat is plainly not the case here.\n\n       Rather than a report prepared by a prison guard providing the hearsay of either an\n\ninmate victim who refused to testify or a confidential informant, the Notice of Charges\n\nhere contains the statement of a known prison guard who was the victim and who signed\n\nthe statement of the incident, certifying it as “true and correct.” ROA at 370. And before\n\npresenting Officer Bork’s statement at the hearing, Lt. Directo interviewed other staff\n\nmembers rather than merely relying on her statement. Lt. Directo also presented a memo\n\nto the board listing the costs of Officer Bork’s treatment as evidence of her injuries.\n\n       We are satisfied that “the findings of the prison disciplinary board are supported\n\n       5\n          Mr. Freeman also cites the following: Sira v. Morton, 380 F.3d 57, 78 (2d Cir.\n2004) (hearing officer must independently assess the credibility of confidential\ninformants, considering totality of circumstances); Kyle v. Hanberry, 677 F.2d 1386,\n1390 (11th Cir. 1982) (hearing committee violated due process in not establishing\ninformant credibility, where determination based on hearsay information derived from a\nconfidential informant). Mr. Freeman also cites Biggs v. Terhune, 334 F.3d 910, 915 (9th\nCir. 2003) (“[T]he evidence underlying the board’s decision must have some indicia of\nreliability.” (quotations omitted)), overruled by Hayward v. Marshall, 603 F.3d 546 (9th\nCir. 2010), which is inapposite to this case because the record here provided a reliable\nbasis for the board’s decision.\n\n                                             --\n                                             19\n\fby some evidence in the record.” Hill, 472 U.S. at 454.\n\n              3. Written Statement of Determination\n\n       Mr. Freeman argues that the disciplinary board’s written statement of its decision\n\nwas insufficient. A “written statement by the factfinders as to the evidence relied on and\n\nreasons for the disciplinary action” is required to “protect the inmate against collateral\n\nconsequences” and to ensure that the board acts fairly. Wolff, 418 U.S. at 565.\n\n       In Taylor, the board stated only that it “found [the prisoner] guilty in reliance upon\n\nconfidential witness statements.” 931 F.2d at 703. We considered this evidence\n\nsufficient because of “the explicit description of the conduct set out in the offense report\n\nand the obvious institutional concerns implicated.” Id.\n\n       In Mitchell v. Maynard, 80 F.3d 1433 (10th Cir. 1996), we rejected a prisoner’s\n\nchallenge to the sufficiency of the board’s statement when it wrote that the prisoner “was\n\nfound guilty based on an officer’s report ‘related to this officer.’” Id. at 1445. We\n\nexplained that the prisoner knew “the conduct he was accused of committing and whose\n\nstatement had incriminated him.” Id. Moreover, “[t]he lack of more specific findings\n\nalso did not hamper our ability to review the proceeding and [the board’s] findings.” Id.;\n\nsee also Smith v. Maschner, 899 F.2d 940, 946 (10th Cir. 1990) (A transcript of a\n\ndisciplinary proceeding is an adequate substitute for a written statement of findings).\n\n       Here, the Disposition of Charges states that the supporting evidence consists of the\n\nwritten statement by Officer Bork, the presentation by Lt. Directo, and the testimony by\n\nMr. Freeman. It also states the board’s finding that Mr. Freeman used force against\n                                             --\n                                             20\n\fOfficer Bork by pushing her into a railing, pushing the box of paints into her chest, and\n\npulling away from her as she was trying to cuff him. Finally, the disposition states that\n\nthe reasons for its decision were the seriousness of the assault, that the assault was on\n\nstaff, and that the staff member was injured.\n\n       The notice of charges provides an explicit description of Mr. Freeman’s conduct.\n\nSee Taylor, 931 F.2d at 703. Mr. Freeman knows the conduct he was charged with and\n\nwhose statement incriminated him. See Mitchell, 80 F.3d at 1445. Nothing in terms of\n\nnotice hampers his ability to contest the ruling or our ability to review the proceeding and\n\nthe findings. The district court did not err in concluding that the board’s written\n\nstatement was adequate.\n\n              4. Opportunity to Present Witnesses\n\n       Mr. Freeman argues that the hearing board violated his right to call witnesses. The\n\ndistrict court held: “Regardless of whether Mr. Freeman told Mr. Carroll the names of\n\nthe witnesses he wanted or not, at the hearing Mr. Freeman knew that witnesses he\n\ndesired were not present. He was advised that he could call witnesses or that he could\n\nrequest a continuance, but he did neither.” ROA at 678. The court therefore concluded\n\nthat the board had not denied Mr. Freeman his right to call witnesses.\n\n       Prisoners have only a qualified right to call witnesses in a disciplinary hearing.\n\nAn inmate’s interest must be balanced “against the needs of the prison, and some amount\n\nof flexibility and accommodation is required.” Wolff, 418 U.S. at 566. Prison officials\n\nmust have “discretion to keep the hearing within reasonable limits and to refuse to call\n                                             --\n                                             21\n\fwitnesses that may create a risk of reprisal or undermine authority, as well as to limit\n\naccess to other inmates to collect statements or to compile other documentary evidence.”\n\nId.; see also Grossman, 447 F.3d at 805 (inmates are entitled to call witnesses and present\n\nevidence as long as doing so “will not be unduly hazardous to institutional safety or\n\ncorrectional goals” (quotations omitted)). Because of the danger of reprisal and\n\nresentment, “the Constitution should not be read to” require the right to confront and\n\ncross-examine witnesses against a prisoner in a disciplinary hearing. Wolff, 418 U.S. at\n\n568; see also Taylor, 931 F.2d at 701.\n\n       Mr. Freeman states that “[t]here is no question that the hearing board and Carroll\n\nknew that [he] desired to call witnesses to the hearing. There is no dispute that no\n\nwitnesses were ever called.” Aplt. Br. at 18. He argues that this “[b]lanket exclusion of\n\n[his] witnesses . . . is an ‘obvious procedural defect’ entitling [him] to relief.” Id. at 17.\n\nHe also argues that his due process rights were violated when he was “prevented from\n\ninterviewing potential witnesses and identifying those who could testify in his defense.”\n\nId. at 18.\n\n       When Mr. Freeman’s hearing began, the chair of the board told him that he “ha[d]\n\nthe right to request representation, witnesses, and continuances.” ROA at 385-86. When\n\nthe chair noted that Mr. Freeman had not notified the prison of his desire to request\n\nwitnesses, Mr. Freeman stated that he had done so. The chair responded that Mr.\n\nFreeman could “request them when [he was] giving [his] testimony.” Id. at 388. The\n\n\n                                               --\n                                               22\n\fchair asked Mr. Freeman if he had any other questions, and Mr. Freeman stated that he\n\ndid not.\n\n       After Lt. Directo presented his case, the chair told Mr. Freeman that he could\n\n“make a statement regarding [his] plea” and that he could “ask for witnesses to present\n\nevidence or give testimony.” Id. at 392-93. Mr. Freeman responded, “I’d like to talk to\n\nsome witnesses first.” Id. at 393. After a pause, and referring to the letter documenting\n\nthe costs of Officer Bork’s treatment that had been handed to him, Mr. Freeman said,\n\n“This here doesn’t say what injuries were caused. She could have got in a car accident or\n\nsomething.” Id. The chair then stated, “Okay. Go ahead and present your case then, Mr.\n\nFreeman.” Id. During the course of Mr. Freeman’s presentation, the chair repeatedly\n\nasked Mr. Freeman if he had anything else to present or any other questions for Lt.\n\nDirecto. Mr. Freeman finally responded, “No, man.” Id. at 402.\n\n       Rather than requesting a continuance to gather evidence, as he had been told was\n\nhis right, Mr. Freeman proceeded to present his case. Although Mr. Freeman indicated\n\nthat he wanted to request witnesses before Lt. Directo presented the prison’s case and\n\nwas told that he could do so when it was time to present his case, he failed to do so when\n\nthat time came, even though the chair explicitly told him at that time that he could call\n\nwitnesses. The chair asked him five times if he had anything else left to present, and at\n\nno point did Mr. Freeman name the witnesses that he had written down while speaking\n\nwith Mr. Carroll before the hearing.\n\n\n                                             --\n                                             23\n\f         Prisoners have only a qualified right to call witnesses, and prison officials may\n\nevaluate a request for witnesses and refuse to provide them for various reasons. See\n\nWolff, 418 U.S. at 566. Regarding the calling of witnesses, the Notice of Charges\n\ninstructed Mr. Freeman to notify prison officials “as soon as possible, but no later than 24\n\nhours prior to the scheduled hearing.” ROA at 370. The record lacks evidence that he\n\nnotified anyone of his desire to call witnesses at least 24 hours before the hearing. Mr.\n\nFreeman had an opportunity to request witnesses, and he failed to do so at the appointed\n\ntime. The board might have asked him if he no longer desired to call witnesses, but it\n\nwas not required to act as his advocate. Mr. Freeman never asked for a continuance to\n\ninterview witnesses or obtain other evidence, although the board advised him of this\n\nright.\n\n         The district court therefore did not err in finding that Mr. Freeman’s qualified right\n\nto call witnesses was not violated.\n\n                5. Inmate Aid in Preparing and Presenting Case\n\n         Mr. Freeman argues that he was entitled to assistance in preparing his defense\n\nbecause he was unable to do it himself, and he asserts that Mr. Carroll failed to provide\n\nsuch assistance.\n\n         The district court stated that, under Wolff, “[t]he appointment of an inmate\n\nrepresentative . . . does not give an inmate greater procedural rights than he would\n\notherwise have.” Id. at 684. The court further stated that Mr. Freeman was “entitled to\n\n\n                                               --\n                                               24\n\fthe opportunity to present evidence; this he was provided.” Id. at 685. The court\n\ntherefore dismissed the claim against Mr. Carroll.\n\n       Prisoners have no right to the assistance of counsel in prison disciplinary hearings.\n\nSee Wolff, 418 U.S. at 569-70. Nevertheless, a prisoner is entitled to “the aid of a fellow\n\ninmate” or an adequate substitute when he is “illiterate” or where the issues are so\n\ncomplex that he cannot “collect and present the evidence necessary for an adequate\n\ncomprehension of the case.” Id. at 570.\n\n       Neither of the situations applies to Mr. Freeman. Id. He argues, however, that he\n\nwas entitled to assistance because he was locked in isolation and unable to collect\n\nevidence.\n\n       Mr. Freeman’s appeal on this issue fails. Because, as discussed earlier, he has no\n\nofficial capacity claims, his inadequate assistance claim must be against a defendant in\n\nhis individual capacity. The only defendant Mr. Freeman mentions with respect to his\n\nassistance claim is Mr. Carroll. But even if Mr. Carroll were a proper defendant for this\n\nclaim, he would as a state actor have qualified immunity.\n\n       Mr. Carroll asserts that he is entitled to qualified immunity because it is not\n\n“sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would have understood that his conduct\n\nviolated” a right to inmate assistance under these circumstances. Aplee. Br. at 15\n\n(quoting Currier, 242 F.3d at 923). He contends there is no Supreme Court or Tenth\n\nCircuit decision on point and the weight of authority from the other circuits does not\n\nclearly establish the right.\n                                             --\n                                             25\n\f       We agree with Mr. Carroll that the law was not clearly established that Mr.\n\nFreeman was entitled to assistance. Neither this court nor the Supreme Court has\n\naddressed Mr. Freeman’s inadequate assistance theory, and the two circuit courts that\n\nhave addressed it are in conflict. Compare Eng v. Coughlin, 858 F.2d 889, 897 (2d Cir.\n\n1988), with Miller v. Duckworth, 963 F.2d 1002, 1004 (7th Cir. 1992).\n\n       The district court correctly dismissed Mr. Freeman’s claim against Mr. Carroll.\n\n       D. Denial of Request to Reopen Discovery\n\n       Mr. Freeman argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment\n\nwithout giving him an adequate opportunity to conduct discovery. This court reviews for\n\nan abuse of discretion a district court’s denial of a Rule 56(d) motion. Trask v. Franco,\n\n446 F.3d 1036, 1042 (10th Cir. 2006). To constitute an abuse of discretion, the court’s\n\ndecision must exceed “the bounds of the rationally available choices given the facts and\n\nthe applicable law in the case at hand.” Valley Forge Ins. Co. v. Health Care Mgmt.\n\nPartners, Ltd., 616 F.3d 1086, 1096 (10th Cir. 2010) (quotations omitted).\n\n       Under Rule 56(d), “the court may . . . defer considering [a summary judgment]\n\nmotion or . . . allow time . . . to take discovery” if the “nonmovant shows by affidavit or\n\ndeclaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its\n\nopposition.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d). The nonmovant must file an affidavit explaining why\n\nfacts necessary to rebut the motion for summary judgment cannot be presented. Valley\n\nForge Ins., 616 F.3d at 1096. The affidavit must identify the unavailable facts, why the\n\nfacts cannot be presented, the steps taken to obtain them, and how additional time will\n                                               --\n                                               26\n\fhelp the party obtain the facts and rebut the motion for summary judgment. Id.\n\n       The district court denied Mr. Freeman’s Rule 56(d) motion for several reasons.\n\nFirst, the court concluded that Mr. Freeman was not eligible to bring the motion because\n\nhe was not a nonmovant. It had ordered him to show cause why it should not grant\n\nsummary judgment in the Defendants’ favor in its order denying Mr. Freeman’s summary\n\njudgment motion. Mr. Freeman filed his Rule 56(d) motion in response to this order to\n\nshow cause. The court treated the Rule 56(d) motion as connected to Mr. Freeman’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment, and thus as filed by the movant.\n\n       Second, the court determined that the discovery Mr. Freeman desired was\n\nirrelevant to his claims. It stated, “Mr. Freeman seeks to discover evidence outside the\n\ncontext of the hearing, but there is no showing that such discovery would impact Mr.\n\nFreeman’s rights to due process during the hearing.” ROA at 687. The court explained\n\nthat “due process provides protections as to procedure rather than outcome” and that Mr.\n\nFreeman sought discovery that went to the board’s decision rather than the procedures\n\nfollowed in the hearing. Id. at 687 n.15.\n\n       Third, the court concluded that Mr. Freeman’s request to discover evidence of bias\n\nwas based on pure speculation and was “not a legitimate basis to reopen discovery.” Id.\n\n       Fourth, the court stated that Mr. Freeman sought evidence to “challenge the\n\nvalidity of the CDOC’s restitution regime as a whole” and concluded that such discovery\n\nwas “not pertinent to the claim asserted against these Defendants.” Id.\n\n       Finally, in a footnote, the district court explained that counsel commenced\n                                            --\n                                            27\n\frepresentation of Mr. Freeman after discovery closed and, rather than moving to reopen\n\ndiscovery, filed a motion for summary judgment, “apparently assuming that his evidence\n\nwas sufficient . . . to prevail on the claim as a matter of law.” Id. at 685 n.12. Then, after\n\nthe court denied Mr. Freeman’s motion for summary judgment and ordered him to show\n\ncause why summary judgment should not be entered against him, Mr. Freeman sought to\n\nreopen discovery. The court stated that, given this history, it was “not inclined to view\n\nMr. Freeman’s prior pro se status as a significant factor in reviewing the request.” Id.\n\n       On appeal, Mr. Freeman’s three arguments fail to persuade us that the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion.\n\n       First, he asserts that the district court erred in not treating liberally his initial pro se\n\nstatus. This argument fails because it does not address the basis of the court’s holding:\n\nthe district court denied the motion because the desired discovery was irrelevant to the\n\nissue of alleged due process violations at the disciplinary hearing.\n\n       Second, he argues that the district court erred in restricting procedural due process\n\nreview to the process rather than the outcome of the hearing because a court has a duty to\n\nreview the sufficiency of the evidence. But the district court did review the evidence and\n\nfound it sufficient, and so have we.\n\n       Third, Mr. Freeman argues that the district court erred in concluding that he did\n\nnot need further discovery. He states that the district court in its order to show cause\n\napplied a heightened legal standard to the denial of witnesses. He therefore needed to\n\nproduce information that he had not anticipated before filing his motion for summary\n                                               --\n                                               28\n\fjudgment. Mr. Freeman fails to argue this issue adequately for us to address it. He has\n\ntherefore waived this argument. See Hardman, 297 F.3d at 1131 (“Arguments raised in a\n\nperfunctory manner . . . are waived.”).\n\n       In sum, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Rule 56(d)\n\nmotion.\n\n                                   III.   CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court’s orders granting summary\n\njudgment and denying Mr. Freeman’s Rule 56(d) motion to reopen discovery.\n\n                                          ENTERED FOR THE COURT\n\n\n\n                                          Scott M.

He was found guilty of\n\n\n\n       * This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of\nlaw of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.

June 26, 2004 Incident\n\n       Mr. Freeman has served over 30 years of a 40-year-to-life sentence. On June 26,\n\n2004, an incident occurred between Mr. Freeman and Officer Maria Bork at FCF.\n\nOfficer Bork’s report, according to the notice of charges, stated:\n\n\n       1\n         He was also found guilty of and sanctioned for tampering with a lock or a\nsecurity device. On December 18, 2008, the Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed the\nassault conviction but overturned the tampering conviction. See Freeman v. Watkins, No.\n08CA0423 (Colo. App. Dec. 18, 2008). The tampering conviction is not at issue on\nappeal.\n\n                                              --\n                                              2\n\f              On Saturday, June 26, 2004, at approximately 1:25 p.m.,\n              Officer Maria Bork observed an inmate leaving the cell\n              assigned to [Mr. Freeman and another inmate]. The inmate\n              exiting the cell had something under his shirt. Officer Bork\n              approached the cell and saw that there were (3) inmates still\n              in the cell, including [Mr. Freeman] and (2) visiting inmates.\n              Officer Bork asked the visitors to leave the cell and they\n              complied. [Officer] Bork then entered the cell and asked [Mr.\n              Freeman] what was in the box. [Mr. Freeman] became\n              agitated[,] stating “You guys just want to take all my fucking\n              things.” [Officer] Bork then tried to calm [Mr. Freeman]\n              down and asked him to come to the operations office to\n              discuss the contents of the box. [Mr. Freeman] then came\n              toward [Officer] Bork with the box and forcibly shoved the\n              box at her, striking her in the chest. [Mr. Freeman] then took\n              an aggressive posture, yelling and clenching his fists at her.\n              [Officer] Bork then attempted to disengage by exiting the cell\n              and ordering [Mr. Freeman] to stay in the cell. As [Officer]\n              Bork closed the cell door with her key set, [Mr. Freeman]\n              blocked the door from closing with his body and exited the\n              cell. [Officer] Bork raised up her right hand at [Mr.\n              Freeman’s] stomach-level to stop his attack. [Mr. Freeman]\n              then pushed her with his body into the 2nd tier railing\n              fronting the cell, causing Officer Bork’s back to strike the\n              railing with considerable force. [Mr. Freeman] then left the\n              area. [Officer Bork] followed and observed [Mr. Freeman]\n              next to the [Cell House 8] entry talking to Sgts. Bell and\n              McMorran. She immediately reported what had transpired\n              earlier and that [Mr. Freeman] needed to cuff up. [Mr.\n              Freeman] then lunged toward [Officer] Bork in an aggressive\n              manner and Sgt. McMorran stepped between [Mr. Freeman]\n              and [Officer] Bork. [Mr. Freeman’s] left hand was cuffed by\n              [Officer] Bork when he pulled away from her, causing injury\n              to her right hand. Security staff responded and finally\n              restrained [Mr. Freeman’s] right hand. [Mr. Freeman] was\n              then escorted out of the area by security staff and placed on\n              RFP status.\n\nROA at 370.\n\n     Mr. Freeman’s account of the incident is different. In a declaration prepared for\n                                            --\n                                            3\n\fthe district court, he stated: Officer Bork confronted him about a box of art supplies that\n\nanother inmate had left in his cell. Officer Bork told him to give her the box. He handed\n\nit to her, and she then put her hand up to his chest to stop him from leaving his cell and\n\nused her security key to close his cell door. He lived in a cell block where he was free to\n\ncome and go, except at night, so he waited five seconds for the locking mechanism to\n\nreset and then pushed a button to open the cell door. As he left his cell, he walked around\n\nOfficer Bork, who was standing to the side of the doorway, and went downstairs. He\n\nsaid, “At no point did I make any contact with Officer Bork.” Id. at 373.\n\n       Mr. Freeman also declared: He was speaking with two other officers when Officer\n\nBork left the Cell House office and ordered him to let her handcuff him. As she put the\n\nhandcuff on his left wrist, it became so tight that he “accidentally pulled [his] hand away\n\nfrom the position it was in.” Id. at 373. Officer Bork had already called for security, so\n\nhe told her that he would wait for security to finish cuffing him. Security officers took\n\nhim to the security office and then to solitary confinement. Mr. Freeman was in solitary\n\nconfinement for only 10 minutes before he was taken to another office, strip-searched,\n\nand then transported to CSP. For the next 18 days, he “had no access to the phones,\n\nletter-writing materials, or any other means of communication.” Id. at 376.\n\n              2. Notice of Charges\n\n       On July 2, 2004, Mr. Freeman was served with a Colorado Department of\n\nCorrections (“CDOC”) Notice of Charges, which charged him with assault and recited\n\nOfficer Bork’s summary of the event. No witnesses were identified in the space\n                                             --\n                                             4\n\fprovided. Officer Bork and Lt. Darryl Directo, the disciplinary officer assigned to\n\ninvestigate the case, signed the notice to “certify that [the] charges and summary are true\n\nand correct.” Id. at 370.\n\n       The notice advised Mr. Freeman, “If you desire witnesses, in accordance with the\n\nCode of Penal Discipline, please notify the Reviewing Supervisor as soon as possible, but\n\nno later than 24 hours prior to scheduled hearing, to avoid a continuance.” Id. Mr.\n\nFreeman checked the box indicating that he wanted an inmate representative. In the\n\nspace following “Name of representative,” someone typed, “If representation is desired,\n\nreport to hearing 10 minutes early.” Id.\n\n                3. July 6, 2004 Hearing\n\n       In his declaration for the district court, Mr. Freeman stated that he was escorted to\n\nthe hearing less than five minutes before it started and was introduced to John Carroll, a\n\nCDOC case manager, who would serve as his inmate representative. Mr. Freeman also\n\nstated that he told Mr. Carroll he wanted to call certain witnesses. Mr. Carroll responded,\n\naccording to Mr. Freeman, that he was there to help protect Mr. Freeman’s rights, not to\n\nadvocate on his behalf.\n\n       The hearing board consisted of Lts. Charles Tappe, Brian Braden, and Betty\n\nRiggin.2 The board advised Mr. Freeman of his right to request representation, witnesses,\n\nand continuances, as well as his right to remain silent. The board asked if he understood\n\n\n       2\n           At the time of the hearing, Lt. Betty Fulton.\n\n                                               --\n                                               5\n\f“the charges against [him], as they are defined by the Code of Penal Discipline and the\n\npossible sanctions if [he was] found guilty,” and he responded that he did. Id. at 386-87.\n\nThe chair then read the charges and asked whether Mr. Freeman understood them. Mr.\n\nFreeman responded that he did. The chair also stated that the sanctions for assault are up\n\nto 90 days of lost privileges, 30 days of punitive segregation, and 45 days of lost good\n\ntime.\n\n        After the chair noted that Mr. Freeman had requested an inmate representative but\n\nnot witnesses when he was served the notice, Mr. Freeman responded that he had\n\nrequested witnesses. The chair told Mr. Freeman that he could request witnesses while\n\ngiving his testimony. The chair asked whether Mr. Freeman understood, but the\n\ntranscript states there was no audible response. When the chair asked Mr. Freeman how\n\nhe pled, he responded not guilty. The chair then swore in Lt. Directo and directed him to\n\npresent the department’s case.\n\n        Lt. Directo related the incident and charges as they were stated in the Notice of\n\nCharges. He also testified that Officer Bork sought medical treatment. The chair\n\ndirected that a letter from a CDOC risk management case manager, stating the costs to\n\ndate for Officer Bork’s medical treatment, be shown to Mr. Freeman.\n\n        After Lt. Directo finished, the chair told Mr. Freeman that he could make a\n\nstatement regarding his plea, “ask for witnesses to present evidence[,] or give testimony\n\nif you wish.” Id. at 392-93. Mr. Freeman responded that he would “like to talk to some\n\nwitnesses first.” Id. at 393. There was a long pause. Then, apparently referring to the\n                                              --\n                                              6\n\fletter stating the costs for Officer Bork’s treatment that had been handed to him, Mr.\n\nFreeman said, “This here doesn’t say what injuries were caused. She could have got in a\n\ncar accident or something.” Id. The chair responded, “Go ahead and present your case\n\nthen, Mr. Freeman.” Id.\n\n       Mr. Freeman related his version of the incident and tried to point out problems\n\nwith the case against him. He stated that he “never initiated any forceful or passive\n\ncontact or any physical contact with” Officer Bork. Id. He asked why, if Officer Bork\n\nsaw another inmate leave his cell with something hidden under his shirt, she had not\n\nstopped that inmate to investigate. He stated that, given their size difference, Officer\n\nBork would have been in the hospital if he had pushed her. He also told the board that, if\n\nhe had done all Officer Bork said, he would not have turned around and let her cuff him\n\nup when she told him to.\n\n       The chair interrupted Mr. Freeman when he began talking about the difficulty\n\nofficers later had in removing the handcuffs. The chair told him that he had gone beyond\n\nthe incident in question and that the tightness of the cuffs had no bearing on the case. Mr.\n\nFreeman stated that he was trying to explain why he turned around while being cuffed\n\nand that Officer Bork could not be believed. The chair then repeatedly told Mr. Freeman\n\nthat he had described the pain that he felt from the tightness of the cuffs and to move on,\n\nfinally telling him that if he continued the board would cut him off completely. The chair\n\ndirected Mr. Carroll to explain to him that he needed to move on.\n\n       Mr. Freeman next attempted to discredit Lt. Directo’s investigation by asking him\n                                             --\n                                             7\n\fif he had spoken to any of the inmates who witnessed the incident. Lt. Directo responded\n\nthat he had not. Mr. Freeman again asked him, and Lt. Directo stated, “I asked the staff\n\nthat were involved. I completed my investigation. That’s why you are getting charged\n\nwith this.” Id. at 400. Mr. Freeman then asked if he spoke with Lance Spurlock, a\n\nCDOC staff member, and Lt. Directo admitted that he had not.3\n\n       Asked if he had anything else to present, Mr. Freeman requested polygraph tests\n\nfor himself and Officer Bork. He asked why, if he had pushed Officer Bork so hard, the\n\npaints had not spilled out of the box she was holding and why she had not pushed the\n\npanic button like she was supposed to do.\n\n       The chair again asked if Mr. Freeman had anything else to present, and Mr.\n\nFreeman responded that he did not.\n\n       After conferencing with one another, the board found Mr. Freeman guilty of\n\nassault for pushing Officer Bork into a railing, pushing the box into her chest, and pulling\n\naway from her while she was trying to handcuff him. It explained that its decision was\n\n“based on the report by [Officer] Bork, presentation by Lieutenant Directo and by your\n\nown statements.” Id. at 404. It then imposed $1,626.20 in restitution for the injuries\n\nsustained by Officer Bork, a 90-day loss of privileges, and a 45-day loss of good time.\n\n       The board later issued a written Disposition of Charges in which it found Mr.\n\nFreeman guilty of assault for the same conduct as in the oral disposition. The written\n\n       3\n       In his opening brief, Mr. Freeman explains that he anticipated that Officer\nSpurlock would testify to having heard Officer Bork plotting to get Freeman.\n\n                                             --\n                                             8\n\fdisposition listed as supporting evidence Officer Bork’s written statement, Lt. Directo’s\n\npresentation, and Mr. Freeman’s testimony. As the reasons for the penalties, it stated,\n\n“The seriousness of the assault; the assault was on staff and staff was injured.” Id. at 410.\n\n       Mr. Freeman appealed to the Colorado state district court, which affirmed the\n\nconviction and sentence. On December 18, 2008, the Colorado Court of Appeals\n\naffirmed the assault conviction.\n\n       B. Procedural History\n\n       On March 8, 2006, Mr. Freeman filed a complaint based on 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in\n\nthe United States District Court for the District of Colorado, alleging constitutional\n\nviolations related to this and other hearings at FCF and CSP. On August 28, 2006, the\n\ndistrict court dismissed the complaint for failure to plead exhaustion of administrative\n\nremedies. Due to an intervening change in law, the Tenth Circuit vacated the judgment\n\nand remanded the case for further proceedings.\n\n              1. District Court’s May 4, 2010 Order\n\n       On May 4, 2010, the district court made three rulings in response to a motion for\n\nsummary judgment by the Defendants.\n\n       First, the court noted that Mr. Freeman had “not specified whether he is asserting\n\nhis claims against the Defendants in their individual or official capacities.” Id. at 204. It\n\nliberally construed the pleadings, “assum[ing] that Mr. Freeman intended to assert both\n\ntypes of claims.” Id. The court concluded, however, that “no official capacity claims are\n\ncognizable” because “Mr. Freeman’s claims are based on discrete acts and because he\n                                              --\n                                              9\n\fseeks no specific prospective remedy.” Id. The court therefore considered all the claims\n\nas brought against the Defendants in their individual capacities. The court also dismissed\n\nall individual capacity claims in which Mr. Freeman had not shown personal participation\n\nby a defendant.\n\n       Second, the district court denied the motion seeking summary judgment for Mr.\n\nCarroll on the claim that Mr. Carroll had deprived Mr. Freeman of his right to call\n\nwitnesses while acting as his inmate representative. The court also concluded that Mr.\n\nCarroll was not entitled to qualified immunity. The court later reversed course and\n\ndismissed Mr. Carroll.\n\n       Third, the court concluded there was insufficient evidence to support a prima facie\n\nclaim against Lts. Tappe, Braden, and Riggin. “[B]ecause Mr. Carroll allegedly did not\n\nadvise the hearing officers of Mr. Freeman’s desire to call witnesses, the hearing officers\n\ncannot reasonably he held liable for failing to afford [him] a procedural protection they\n\nwere not aware he had requested.” Id. at 213.\n\n       Following these rulings, the only remaining defendant was Mr. Carroll, to be\n\nrejoined later by Lts. Tappe, Braden, and Riggin.\n\n              2. Reinstatement of Claims Against Hearing Board Members\n\n       On January 5, 2011, Mr. Freeman filed a Rule 60(b)(1) motion for relief from\n\njudgment. He argued that the district court had erred in finding that he had failed to\n\nallege that the hearing board members were personally involved in the deprivation of Mr.\n\nFreeman’s rights. Given this mistake of fact, he requested that the court reinstate Lts.\n                                             --\n                                             10\n\fTappen, Braden, and Riggin as parties.\n\n       On March 4, 2011, the district court concluded it had mistakenly determined that\n\nthere were no allegations of Lts. Tappe, Braden, and Riggin’s personal participation in\n\nthe deprivation of his rights. Accordingly, the district court granted Mr. Freeman’s\n\nmotion, reinstating the claim against them for the denial of due process at the July 6\n\ndisciplinary hearing.\n\n              3. District Court’s January 18, 2012 Order\n\n       On May 17, 2011, Mr. Freeman moved for summary judgment. On May 20, 2011,\n\nthe defendants filed an amended motion to dismiss. On November 18, 2011, the district\n\ncourt denied Mr. Freeman’s motion for summary judgment. The court also stated that the\n\nevidence appeared to be insufficient for Mr. Freeman to establish his prima facie case and\n\nthat there appeared to be no genuine issues of material fact to be resolved at trial. It\n\ntherefore ordered him to present additional evidence demonstrating a prima facie case or\n\notherwise to show cause why the court should not enter summary judgment. Mr.\n\nFreeman responded to the order with exhibits, and he requested additional time to\n\nconduct discovery pursuant to Rule 56(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n       On January 18, 2012, the district court denied Mr. Freeman’s request for further\n\ndiscovery: (1) it doubted that he was a non-movant who could make a Rule 56(d)\n\nmotion, as he had brought the motion for summary judgment; and (2) Mr. Freeman\n\nsought to discover evidence outside the context of the July 6, 2004 hearing, and there was\n\nno showing that such discovery was related to his due process rights during the hearing.\n                                              --\n                                              11\n\f       As will be discussed in further detail below, the district court also concluded that\n\nMr. Freeman had not presented sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case for his\n\ndue process claims and therefore granted summary judgment in favor of the hearing\n\nboard defendants and Mr. Carroll.\n\n                                     II.    DISCUSSION\n\n       Mr. Freeman appeals regarding two issues. First, he argues that the district court\n\nerred in granting summary judgment on his due process claim arising from the July 6,\n\n2004 hearing. Second, he argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to\n\nreopen discovery after the court filed an order to show cause.\n\n       A. Official Capacity and Individual Capacity Claims\n\n       Before reaching the due process and discovery issues, we first address whether\n\nany official capacity claims are at issue on appeal. In its May 2010 order, the district\n\ncourt concluded “that no official capacity claims are cognizable” in this case “because\n\nMr. Freeman’s claims are based on discrete acts and because he seeks no specific\n\nprospective remedy.” Id. at 204. The district court therefore considered all claims to be\n\nagainst the Defendants in their individual capacities. We can find nothing in the district\n\ncourt’s subsequent orders indicating that it reinstated the official capacity claims.\n\n       In his notice of appeal from the January 2012 summary judgment order and final\n\njudgment, Mr. Freeman stated that he is “appeal[ing] from any and all orders antecedent\n\nand ancillary thereto.” Id. at 692. In the conclusion of his opening brief, he requests that\n\nwe reverse the district court’s grant of summary judgment against CDOC Executive\n                                             --\n                                             12\n\fDirector Tom Clements in his official capacity and against the Defendants in their\n\nindividual and official capacities. In his reply brief, Mr. Freeman again states that he is\n\nmaking a claim against Mr. Clements in his official capacity and against the Defendants\n\nin their official and individual capacities. At oral argument, he asserted that he was\n\nmaking official capacity claims for injunctive relief—reversal of the restitution order and\n\nthe return of the funds taken from his prison account—and individual capacity claims for\n\nmonetary damages from the Defendants.\n\n       A party waives an issue when he or she fails to raise it in an opening brief.\n\nAnderson v.

He asserts that he is making official capacity\n\nclaims. But he fails to argue in his briefs that the district court erred in dismissing the\n\nofficial capacity claims for failure to state a prospective remedy. Mr. Freeman has\n\nthereby waived the argument on appeal that the district court erred in dismissing the\n                                              --\n                                              13\n\fofficial capacity claims. We therefore review Mr. Freeman’s remaining claims against\n\nthe Defendants in their individual capacities only.\n\n       B. Legal Background on Due Process in Prison Disciplinary Hearings\n\n       Although a prisoner’s “rights may be diminished by the needs and exigencies of\n\nthe institutional environment, a prisoner is not wholly stripped of constitutional\n\nprotections when he is imprisoned for crime.” Wolff v.

Nevertheless, “[w]here an illiterate inmate is involved,” or where “the\n\ncomplexity of the issue makes it unlikely that [an] inmate will be able to collect and\n\npresent the evidence necessary for an adequate comprehension of the case, he should be\n\nfree to seek the aid of a fellow inmate.” Id.

Notice of the Restitution Penalty\n\n       Mr. Freeman asserts that his advance written notice of the disciplinary charges\n\nwas constitutionally deficient because it did not inform him of the possible sanctions for\n\nthose charges. The district court rejected this claim. It explained that, under Wolff, the\n\npurpose of notice “is to give the charged party a chance to marshal the facts in his\n\ndefense and to clarify what the charges are.” See Wolff, 418 U.S. at 564. Written notice\n\nmust be given at least 24 hours before the hearing “to inform [the defendant] of the\n\ncharges and to enable him to marshal the facts and prepare a defense.” Id. The district\n\ncourt noted that advance notice of possible sanctions is not one of the explicit\n\nrequirements of Wolff.\n\n       Neither Wolff nor Hill states that due process requires notice of potential sanctions\n\nin addition to notice of the disciplinary charges. On appeal, Mr. Freeman cites to\n\nMcMillan v. Healey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1610299\"><a href=\"/opinion/1610299/mcmillan-v-healey/\"><span class=\"volume\">739</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Id. at 157.\n\n       Few courts have followed McMillan in requiring such notice. For example, a\n\nfederal court in Indiana granted defendants qualified immunity, noting that McMillan was\n\nthe only case holding that there is a due process right to notice of potential penalties.

Id. at 702. In\n\nTaylor, we held “that the testimony of confidential informants cannot be given any\n\nweight absent a determination made by the prison staff that indicated that the informant\n\nwas reliable.” Id. at 701.\n\n       Mr. Freeman’s reliance on cases like Luna and Taylor is misplaced. His case\n\nlacks the levels of hearsay involved in Luna, where the inmate victim refused to testify.\n                                              --\n                                              18\n\f356 F.3d at 484. In Luna, the disciplinary determination was based on a misbehavior\n\nreport prepared by a prison officer using information provided by another prison officer\n\nwho had spoken with the victim. Id. at 489. The officer preparing the report never spoke\n\nwith the inmate victim and had no idea if the victim was telling the truth, and the officer\n\nwho had spoken with the inmate victim was not called as a witness. Id. Taylor and other\n\ncases Mr. Freeman cites for support involve accusations by a confidential informant,5 and\n\nthat is plainly not the case here.\n\n       Rather than a report prepared by a prison guard providing the hearsay of either an\n\ninmate victim who refused to testify or a confidential informant, the Notice of Charges\n\nhere contains the statement of a known prison guard who was the victim and who signed\n\nthe statement of the incident, certifying it as “true and correct.” ROA at 370. And before\n\npresenting Officer Bork’s statement at the hearing, Lt. Directo interviewed other staff\n\nmembers rather than merely relying on her statement. Lt. Directo also presented a memo\n\nto the board listing the costs of Officer Bork’s treatment as evidence of her injuries.\n\n       We are satisfied that “the findings of the prison disciplinary board are supported\n\n       5\n          Mr. Freeman also cites the following: Sira v.

Written Statement of Determination\n\n       Mr. Freeman argues that the disciplinary board’s written statement of its decision\n\nwas insufficient. A “written statement by the factfinders as to the evidence relied on and\n\nreasons for the disciplinary action” is required to “protect the inmate against collateral\n\nconsequences” and to ensure that the board acts fairly. Wolff, 418 U.S. at 565.\n\n       In Taylor, the board stated only that it “found [the prisoner] guilty in reliance upon\n\nconfidential witness statements.” 931 F.2d at 703. We considered this evidence\n\nsufficient because of “the explicit description of the conduct set out in the offense report\n\nand the obvious institutional concerns implicated.” Id.\n\n       In Mitchell v. Maynard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"715843\"><a href=\"/opinion/715843/carl-demetrius-mitchell-v-gary-d-maynard-director-of-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1433</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir. 1996), we rejected a prisoner’s\n\nchallenge to the sufficiency of the board’s statement when it wrote that the prisoner “was\n\nfound guilty based on an officer’s report ‘related to this officer.’” Id. at 1445. We\n\nexplained that the prisoner knew “the conduct he was accused of committing and whose\n\nstatement had incriminated him.” Id. Moreover, “[t]he lack of more specific findings\n\nalso did not hamper our ability to review the proceeding and [the board’s] findings.” Id.;\n\nsee also Smith v. Maschner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538916\"><a href=\"/opinion/538916/jerry-wayne-smith-v-herb-maschner-director-dale-bohannon-deputy/\"><span class=\"volume\">899</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">940</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 946 (10th Cir. 1990) (A transcript of a\n\ndisciplinary proceeding is an adequate substitute for a written statement of findings).\n\n       Here, the Disposition of Charges states that the supporting evidence consists of the\n\nwritten statement by Officer Bork, the presentation by Lt. Directo, and the testimony by\n\nMr. Freeman. It also states the board’s finding that Mr. Freeman used force against\n                                             --\n                                             20\n\fOfficer Bork by pushing her into a railing, pushing the box of paints into her chest, and\n\npulling away from her as she was trying to cuff him. Finally, the disposition states that\n\nthe reasons for its decision were the seriousness of the assault, that the assault was on\n\nstaff, and that the staff member was injured.\n\n       The notice of charges provides an explicit description of Mr. Freeman’s conduct.\n\nSee Taylor, 931 F.2d at 703. Mr. Freeman knows the conduct he was charged with and\n\nwhose statement incriminated him. See Mitchell, 80 F.3d at 1445. Nothing in terms of\n\nnotice hampers his ability to contest the ruling or our ability to review the proceeding and\n\nthe findings. The district court did not err in concluding that the board’s written\n\nstatement was adequate.\n\n              4. Opportunity to Present Witnesses\n\n       Mr. Freeman argues that the hearing board violated his right to call witnesses. The\n\ndistrict court held: “Regardless of whether Mr. Freeman told Mr. Carroll the names of\n\nthe witnesses he wanted or not, at the hearing Mr. Freeman knew that witnesses he\n\ndesired were not present. He was advised that he could call witnesses or that he could\n\nrequest a continuance, but he did neither.” ROA at 678. The court therefore concluded\n\nthat the board had not denied Mr. Freeman his right to call witnesses.\n\n       Prisoners have only a qualified right to call witnesses in a disciplinary hearing.\n\nAn inmate’s interest must be balanced “against the needs of the prison, and some amount\n\nof flexibility and accommodation is required.” Wolff, 418 U.S. at 566. Prison officials\n\nmust have “discretion to keep the hearing within reasonable limits and to refuse to call\n                                             --\n                                             21\n\fwitnesses that may create a risk of reprisal or undermine authority, as well as to limit\n\naccess to other inmates to collect statements or to compile other documentary evidence.”\n\nId.; see also Grossman, 447 F.3d at 805 (inmates are entitled to call witnesses and present\n\nevidence as long as doing so “will not be unduly hazardous to institutional safety or\n\ncorrectional goals” (quotations omitted)). Because of the danger of reprisal and\n\nresentment, “the Constitution should not be read to” require the right to confront and\n\ncross-examine witnesses against a prisoner in a disciplinary hearing. Wolff, 418 U.S. at\n\n568; see also Taylor, 931 F.2d at 701.\n\n       Mr. Freeman states that “[t]here is no question that the hearing board and Carroll\n\nknew that [he] desired to call witnesses to the hearing. There is no dispute that no\n\nwitnesses were ever called.” Aplt. Br. at 18. He argues that this “[b]lanket exclusion of\n\n[his] witnesses . . . is an ‘obvious procedural defect’ entitling [him] to relief.” Id. at 17.\n\nHe also argues that his due process rights were violated when he was “prevented from\n\ninterviewing potential witnesses and identifying those who could testify in his defense.”\n\nId. at 18.\n\n       When Mr. Freeman’s hearing began, the chair of the board told him that he “ha[d]\n\nthe right to request representation, witnesses, and continuances.” ROA at 385-86. When\n\nthe chair noted that Mr. Freeman had not notified the prison of his desire to request\n\nwitnesses, Mr. Freeman stated that he had done so. The chair responded that Mr.\n\nFreeman could “request them when [he was] giving [his] testimony.” Id. at 388. The\n\n\n                                               --\n                                               22\n\fchair asked Mr. Freeman if he had any other questions, and Mr. Freeman stated that he\n\ndid not.\n\n       After Lt. Directo presented his case, the chair told Mr. Freeman that he could\n\n“make a statement regarding [his] plea” and that he could “ask for witnesses to present\n\nevidence or give testimony.” Id. at 392-93. Mr. Freeman responded, “I’d like to talk to\n\nsome witnesses first.” Id. at 393. After a pause, and referring to the letter documenting\n\nthe costs of Officer Bork’s treatment that had been handed to him, Mr. Freeman said,\n\n“This here doesn’t say what injuries were caused. She could have got in a car accident or\n\nsomething.” Id. The chair then stated, “Okay. Go ahead and present your case then, Mr.\n\nFreeman.” Id. During the course of Mr. Freeman’s presentation, the chair repeatedly\n\nasked Mr. Freeman if he had anything else to present or any other questions for Lt.\n\nDirecto. Mr. Freeman finally responded, “No, man.” Id. at 402.\n\n       Rather than requesting a continuance to gather evidence, as he had been told was\n\nhis right, Mr. Freeman proceeded to present his case. Although Mr. Freeman indicated\n\nthat he wanted to request witnesses before Lt. Directo presented the prison’s case and\n\nwas told that he could do so when it was time to present his case, he failed to do so when\n\nthat time came, even though the chair explicitly told him at that time that he could call\n\nwitnesses. The chair asked him five times if he had anything else left to present, and at\n\nno point did Mr. Freeman name the witnesses that he had written down while speaking\n\nwith Mr. Carroll before the hearing.\n\n\n                                             --\n                                             23\n\f         Prisoners have only a qualified right to call witnesses, and prison officials may\n\nevaluate a request for witnesses and refuse to provide them for various reasons. See\n\nWolff, 418 U.S. at 566. Regarding the calling of witnesses, the Notice of Charges\n\ninstructed Mr. Freeman to notify prison officials “as soon as possible, but no later than 24\n\nhours prior to the scheduled hearing.” ROA at 370. The record lacks evidence that he\n\nnotified anyone of his desire to call witnesses at least 24 hours before the hearing. Mr.\n\nFreeman had an opportunity to request witnesses, and he failed to do so at the appointed\n\ntime. The board might have asked him if he no longer desired to call witnesses, but it\n\nwas not required to act as his advocate. Mr. Freeman never asked for a continuance to\n\ninterview witnesses or obtain other evidence, although the board advised him of this\n\nright.\n\n         The district court therefore did not err in finding that Mr. Freeman’s qualified right\n\nto call witnesses was not violated.\n\n                5. Inmate Aid in Preparing and Presenting Case\n\n         Mr. Freeman argues that he was entitled to assistance in preparing his defense\n\nbecause he was unable to do it himself, and he asserts that Mr. Carroll failed to provide\n\nsuch assistance.\n\n         The district court stated that, under Wolff, “[t]he appointment of an inmate\n\nrepresentative . . . does not give an inmate greater procedural rights than he would\n\notherwise have.” Id. at 684. The court further stated that Mr. Freeman was “entitled to\n\n\n                                               --\n                                               24\n\fthe opportunity to present evidence; this he was provided.” Id. at 685. The court\n\ntherefore dismissed the claim against Mr. Carroll.\n\n       Prisoners have no right to the assistance of counsel in prison disciplinary hearings.\n\nSee Wolff, 418 U.S. at 569-70. Nevertheless, a prisoner is entitled to “the aid of a fellow\n\ninmate” or an adequate substitute when he is “illiterate” or where the issues are so\n\ncomplex that he cannot “collect and present the evidence necessary for an adequate\n\ncomprehension of the case.” Id. at 570.\n\n       Neither of the situations applies to Mr. Freeman. Id. He argues, however, that he\n\nwas entitled to assistance because he was locked in isolation and unable to collect\n\nevidence.\n\n       Mr. Freeman’s appeal on this issue fails. Because, as discussed earlier, he has no\n\nofficial capacity claims, his inadequate assistance claim must be against a defendant in\n\nhis individual capacity. The only defendant Mr. Freeman mentions with respect to his\n\nassistance claim is Mr. Carroll. But even if Mr. Carroll were a proper defendant for this\n\nclaim, he would as a state actor have qualified immunity.\n\n       Mr. Carroll asserts that he is entitled to qualified immunity because it is not\n\n“sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would have understood that his conduct\n\nviolated” a right to inmate assistance under these circumstances. Aplee. Br. at 15\n\n(quoting Currier, 242 F.3d at 923). He contends there is no Supreme Court or Tenth\n\nCircuit decision on point and the weight of authority from the other circuits does not\n\nclearly establish the right.\n                                             --\n                                             25\n\f       We agree with Mr. Carroll that the law was not clearly established that Mr.\n\nFreeman was entitled to assistance. Neither this court nor the Supreme Court has\n\naddressed Mr. Freeman’s inadequate assistance theory, and the two circuit courts that\n\nhave addressed it are in conflict. Compare Eng v.

R. Civ. P. 56(d). The nonmovant must file an affidavit explaining why\n\nfacts necessary to rebut the motion for summary judgment cannot be presented. Valley\n\nForge Ins., 616 F.3d at 1096. The affidavit must identify the unavailable facts, why the\n\nfacts cannot be presented, the steps taken to obtain them, and how additional time will\n                                               --\n                                               26\n\fhelp the party obtain the facts and rebut the motion for summary judgment. Id.\n\n       The district court denied Mr. Freeman’s Rule 56(d) motion for several reasons.\n\nFirst, the court concluded that Mr. Freeman was not eligible to bring the motion because\n\nhe was not a nonmovant. It had ordered him to show cause why it should not grant\n\nsummary judgment in the Defendants’ favor in its order denying Mr. Freeman’s summary\n\njudgment motion. Mr. Freeman filed his Rule 56(d) motion in response to this order to\n\nshow cause. The court treated the Rule 56(d) motion as connected to Mr. Freeman’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment, and thus as filed by the movant.\n\n       Second, the court determined that the discovery Mr. Freeman desired was\n\nirrelevant to his claims. It stated, “Mr. Freeman seeks to discover evidence outside the\n\ncontext of the hearing, but there is no showing that such discovery would impact Mr.\n\nFreeman’s rights to due process during the hearing.” ROA at 687. The court explained\n\nthat “due process provides protections as to procedure rather than outcome” and that Mr.\n\nFreeman sought discovery that went to the board’s decision rather than the procedures\n\nfollowed in the hearing. Id. at 687 n.15.\n\n       Third, the court concluded that Mr. Freeman’s request to discover evidence of bias\n\nwas based on pure speculation and was “not a legitimate basis to reopen discovery.” Id.\n\n       Fourth, the court stated that Mr. Freeman sought evidence to “challenge the\n\nvalidity of the CDOC’s restitution regime as a whole” and concluded that such discovery\n\nwas “not pertinent to the claim asserted against these Defendants.” Id.\n\n       Finally, in a footnote, the district court explained that counsel commenced\n                                            --\n                                            27\n\frepresentation of Mr. Freeman after discovery closed and, rather than moving to reopen\n\ndiscovery, filed a motion for summary judgment, “apparently assuming that his evidence\n\nwas sufficient . . . to prevail on the claim as a matter of law.” Id. at 685 n.12. Then, after\n\nthe court denied Mr. Freeman’s motion for summary judgment and ordered him to show\n\ncause why summary judgment should not be entered against him, Mr. Freeman sought to\n\nreopen discovery. The court stated that, given this history, it was “not inclined to view\n\nMr. Freeman’s prior pro se status as a significant factor in reviewing the request.” Id.\n\n       On appeal, Mr. Freeman’s three arguments fail to persuade us that the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion.\n\n       First, he asserts that the district court erred in not treating liberally his initial pro se\n\nstatus. This argument fails because it does not address the basis of the court’s holding:\n\nthe district court denied the motion because the desired discovery was irrelevant to the\n\nissue of alleged due process violations at the disciplinary hearing.\n\n       Second, he argues that the district court erred in restricting procedural due process\n\nreview to the process rather than the outcome of the hearing because a court has a duty to\n\nreview the sufficiency of the evidence. But the district court did review the evidence and\n\nfound it sufficient, and so have we.\n\n       Third, Mr. Freeman argues that the district court erred in concluding that he did\n\nnot need further discovery. He states that the district court in its order to show cause\n\napplied a heightened legal standard to the denial of witnesses. He therefore needed to\n\nproduce information that he had not anticipated before filing his motion for summary\n                                               --\n                                               28\n\fjudgment. Mr. Freeman fails to argue this issue adequately for us to address it. He has\n\ntherefore waived this argument. See Hardman, 297 F.3d at 1131 (“Arguments raised in a\n\nperfunctory manner . . . are waived.”).\n\n       In sum, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Rule 56(d)\n\nmotion.\n\n                                   III.   CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court’s orders granting summary\n\njudgment and denying Mr. Freeman’s Rule 56(d) motion to reopen discovery.\n\n                                          ENTERED FOR THE COURT\n\n\n\n                                          Scott M. Matheson, Jr.\n                                          Circuit Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                             --\n                                             29\n\f</pre>",
