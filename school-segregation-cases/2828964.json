Stepanski, JOHNSON, ROSATI, LaBARGE,\nASELTYNE & FIELD, Farmington Hills, Michigan, for Defendants.\n                                       _________________\n                                           OPINION\n                                       _________________\n         ALICE M. BATCHELDER, Circuit Judge. These consolidated appeals are taken from\njudgments entered by the district court in Matthew Daniels’s 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action arising out of\nDaniels’s pre-trial detention as a 16-year-old on charges of murder. Daniels appeals the district\ncourt’s grant of summary judgment to Ronald Tuscany, Macomb County Sheriff, on Daniels’s\nclaims that Tuscany violated his Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by permitting him\nto be housed in the Macomb County Jail as an adult in violation of the Michigan law governing pre-\ntrial detention of juveniles, and by housing him under inhumane conditions. Daniels also appeals\nthe district court’s grant of summary judgment to the Anchor Bay School District (“Anchor Bay”)\non his claim that Anchor Bay denied him due process by expelling him from an alternative education\nprogram upon his arrest and pre-trial detention, and refusing to permit him to re-enroll in that\nprogram after his release from pre-trial detention. Leonard Woodside, Anchor Bay’s superintendent,\nappeals the district court’s denial of his motion for summary judgment on Daniels’s due process\nclaim.\n        Daniels does not challenge the constitutionality of the Michigan law governing pre-trial\ndetention of juveniles but rather complains of Tuscany’s alleged violation of that law. Because we\nconclude that Daniels was confined in accordance with Michigan law and that the restrictions and\nconditions of his confinement were an incident of the state’s legitimate goal of preventing him from\ncommitting suicide, we will affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of Sheriff Tuscany.\nFurther, because we conclude that Michigan law does not create in a Michigan resident a property\nright in alternative education provided by a public school district, and therefore Anchor Bay and\nWoodside did not violate Daniels’s constitutional rights in terminating his participation in that\nprogram or in denying him readmission to it, we will affirm the grant of summary judgment to\nAnchor Bay and reverse the denial of summary judgment to Woodside.\n                      FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n         Daniels and two others were charged on October 27, 2000, with the murder of Justin Mello.\nDaniels was remanded by the Macomb County District Court to the custody of the Macomb County\nJail, an adult correctional facility, pending his preliminary examination. The court notified the jail\nadministrators, including Sheriff Tuscany, that because Daniels was 16 years old, he was to be\nsegregated from the adult prisoners in accordance with Michigan statutory law. When Daniels\narrived at the jail, he was initially housed in the medical ward, one of only three places in the\nMacomb County Jail where he could be segregated from adults. Shortly thereafter, he was\ntransferred to the mental health floor, another area where he could be segregated from adult\nprisoners, until mental health professionals could evaluate him and rule out any risk of suicide.\nRecords of Daniels’s mental health evaluations at the jail reflect that he expressed suicidal thoughts\n\fNos. 03-2053/2117/2369                Daniels v. Woodside, et al.                                Page 3\n\n\nduring the evaluations, and he was therefore placed on suicide watch. Daniels claims that while he\nwas on suicide watch, he was kept under twenty-four hour lock-down; he was not permitted to leave\nhis cell for four days, except for limited visits with a clergyman and an attorney; he was denied the\nability to attend to any basic hygiene needs; he was required to wear a “suicide robe,” which is a\nsleeveless, legless gown that did not adequately fasten in the back; and for the first several days of\nhis confinement he had neither socks for his feet nor sheets or pillows for his bed.\n         Daniels was released from jail after his preliminary hearing resulted in a finding of no\nprobable cause due to a lack of admissible evidence. After his release, Daniels asked Woodside to\nre-admit him to Anchor Bay’s voluntary alternative education program in which he had been\nenrolled for about one month prior to his arrest. This program, called “Skill Quest,” is described in\nthe literature of the school district as “a special alternative high school program which is offered\nduring the day for youth under 19 without diplomas, who have returned to school after being out for\nat least one semester.” Admission to the Skill Quest program is discretionary with the\nsuperintendent, and students in the program are required to adhere to the program’s attendance\npolicy and the school district’s written code of conduct. The attendance policy provides that if a\nstudent misses more than six hours of class, he automatically loses credit for that course.\n         Daniels had enrolled in Skill Quest some eight months after he dropped out of high school\nupon attaining the age of 16, the age at which Michigan law permits students to withdraw from\nschool. During the month in which Daniels was enrolled in the program, he had not missed any\nclasses or been subject to any disciplinary actions. Because of his arrest and pre-trial detention,\nhowever, Daniels missed substantially more than six hours of class. He therefore automatically lost\ncredit in the courses in which he was enrolled, and in order to participate any further in the program,\nhe was required to seek re-enrollment for the following semester. Superintendent Woodside denied\nDaniels’s request for readmission to Skill Quest, citing the advice of the school district’s counsel\nto the effect that, despite the court’s finding of no probable cause, Daniels was still implicated in the\nMello murder and presented a danger to students and staff. In April 2000, after another individual\nconfessed to the murder, Woodside notified Daniels that he would be permitted to enroll in Skill\nQuest at the commencement of the next semester, that is, in September 2001. Daniels enrolled at\nthat time, but after attending classes for only about one month, he began to accrue excessive\nabsences, lost class credit, and dropped out of the program.\n       On October 15, 2001, Daniels filed this 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action in the United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Michigan against numerous state, county and school district\ndefendants, complaining that these defendants had violated various of his constitutional rights in\nconnection with his arrest and pre-trial detention. Only defendants Tuscany, Woodside and Anchor\nBay remain in the action, all other defendants having been dismissed by stipulation of the parties\nduring the course of this litigation.\n        Daniels’s Complaint alleges that Woodside and Anchor Bay violated his right to due process\neither by refusing, without a hearing, to allow him to re-enroll in the Skill Quest program, or by\nexpelling him, without a hearing, from his initial participation in the Skill Quest program. Daniels\nclaims that Tuscany, as the Macomb County Sheriff, deprived Daniels of his rights under the Fifth,\nEighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution by improperly housing him\nas an adult and by mistreating him during his detention.\n        Tuscany moved for dismissal or, in the alternative, for summary judgment and the district\ncourt granted the motion. Anchor Bay and Woodside filed a joint motion for summary judgment.\nAnchor Bay argued that its policies are constitutional and have not been shown to be the cause of\nany injury to Daniels, and that the school district cannot be held vicariously liable for the acts of its\nemployees. Woodside argued that he is entitled to qualified immunity for his actions. The district\ncourt granted Anchor Bay’s motion, but denied Woodside’s. Woodside then filed a Motion to\n\fNos. 03-2053/2117/2369               Daniels v. Woodside, et al.                              Page 4\n\n\nAmend Judgment, arguing that Daniels did not have a property right in the alternative education\nprogram Skill Quest, and therefore Daniels’s due process rights were not violated when he was\ndropped from the program initially or when Woodside refused to re-enroll him in that program. The\ndistrict court denied the motion. Woodside brings an interlocutory appeal of the district court’s\ndenial of his motion for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds and the denial of his\nmotion to amend the judgment.\n       Daniels filed a motion to permit an interlocutory appeal of the district court’s order granting\nsummary judgment to Tuscany and Anchor Bay. The district court entered final judgment as to\nTuscany and Anchor Bay and certified Daniels’s dismissed claims for immediate appeal under\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), fully satisfying the requirements of that rule.\n                                            ANALYSIS\n        We review de novo a district court’s grant of summary judgment, using the same standard\nunder Rule 56(c) used by the district court. Williams v. Mehra, 186 F.3d 685, 689 (6th Cir. 1999)\n(en banc). We must view the evidence, all facts, and any inferences that may be drawn from the\nfacts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith\nRadio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986). Summary judgment is proper if “the pleadings, depositions,\nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that\nthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment\nas a matter of law.” FED. R. CIV. P. 56(c). To withstand summary judgment, the non-movant must\npresent sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact. Klepper v. First Am. Bank, 916\nF.2d 337, 341-42 (6th Cir. 1990). A mere scintilla of evidence is insufficient; “there must be\nevidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the [non-movant].” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,\nInc., 477 U.S. 242, 252 (1986). Entry of summary judgment is appropriate “against a party who fails\nto make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case,\nand on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S.\n317, 322 (1986).\n                                                  I.\n        The Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit a pretrial\ndetainee from being punished prior to an adjudication of guilt. Roberts v. City of Troy, 773 F.2d\n720, 723 (6th Cir. 1985). Through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, pretrial\ndetainees are entitled to the same Eighth Amendment rights as are other inmates. Thompson v.\nCounty of Medina, Ohio, 29 F.3d 238, 242 (6th Cir. 1994). In determining whether conditions of\npretrial confinement violate the Fifth, Fourteenth, or Eighth Amendments, the court must evaluate\nwhether a restriction imposed on a detainee was imposed for the purpose of punishment, or was in\nfurtherance of some other legitimate government goal. Roberts, 773 F.2d at 723.\n        As we understand his argument, Daniels claims that Tuscany, as Sheriff in charge of the\nMacomb County Jail where Daniels was housed, permitted Daniels to be housed in the jail as an\nadult in violation of Michigan law; that in doing so, Tuscany was deliberately indifferent to\nMichigan statutes governing the placement of juveniles being detained on criminal charges; and this\ndeliberate indifference violated Daniels’sEighth Amendment Right to be free from cruel and unusual\npunishment. Daniels, however, fails at the first step of his argument. He has not presented evidence\nthat Tuscany violated Michigan law.\n         As a general rule, in Michigan juveniles may not be confined in a jail while awaiting trial.\nM.C.L.A. § 764.27a(1). A judge may, however, order a juvenile to be detained in a jail before trial\nif he is “considered to be a menace to other children, or [he] may not otherwise be safely detained.”\nM.C.L.A. § 764.27a(2). If a juvenile is housed in a jail, then he must be kept “in a room or ward\n\fNos. 03-2053/2117/2369               Daniels v. Woodside, et al.                               Page 5\n\n\nout of sight and sound from adults.” M.C.L.A. § 764.27a(2). The evidence before the district court\nestablishes that the judge ordered Daniels to be housed at the jail and to be segregated from the adult\npopulation. The evidence further establishes that Daniels was at no time kept where he was within\neither sight of or sound from adults. The procedure followed by the judge and the jail staff in\ndetaining Daniels follows Michigan law to the letter.\n         Daniels also alleges that Tuscany violated Daniels’s constitutional rights under the Fifth,\nEighth, and Fourteenth Amendments by confining Daniels to twenty-four hour lock-down, depriving\nhim of exercise, dressing him in a suicide gown that did not completely close in the back as opposed\nto a jail uniform, denying him access to a shower and personal hygiene products such as soap and\ntoothpaste, and denying him visitors. Daniels asserts that there is a material question of fact as to\nwhether Tuscany had a legitimate purpose for imposing such restrictions. The record demonstrates,\nhowever, that Daniels told jail personnel of his suicidal thoughts. The deprivations imposed on\nDaniels were affirmative steps to secure Daniels’s well-being, in furtherance of the jail staff’s\nlegitimate and non-punitive purpose of preventing Daniels’s suicide or injury. The district court\nheld, and we agree, that Daniels’s attempts to create a genuine issue of fact with regard to this claim\nare without support in the record.\n                                                  II.\n        Daniels complains that Anchor Bay and Woodside denied him due process when, without\naffording him a hearing, they deprived him of his property interest in a free public education by\nterminating his participation in the Skill Quest program in which he was enrolled at the time of his\narrest and pre-trial detention, and refusing to permit him to enroll again in the program immediately\nfollowing his release from detention. “Property interests are not created by the Constitution, ‘they\nare created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an\nindependent source such as state law . . . .’” Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532,\n538 (1985) (quoting Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972)). State statutes or rules\ncreate protected property interests by entitling a citizen to certain benefits. Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S.\n565, 573 (1975) (“Here, on the basis of state law, appellees plainly had legitimate claims of\nentitlement to a public education.”) There is no question that Michigan law gave Daniels a protected\nproperty interest in a free public education. M.C.L.A. Const. Art. 8, §2; see, e.g. Goss, 419 U.S. at\n574. The issue before us, however, is whether Daniels has a legitimate claim of entitlement to\nAnchor Bay’s program of alternative free public education.\n        The Michigan Constitution mandates “free public elementary and secondary schools as\ndefined by law,” rather than simply providing a broad right to “public education.” M.C.L.A. Const.\nArt. 8, §2 (emphasis added). Michigan law also requires residents between the ages of six and\nsixteen (through the sixteenth birthday) to attend school. M.C.L.A. §380.1561(1). There is no\nquestion that Daniels had the right to attend his local public high school. We conclude, however,\nthat he chose to forego that right when he dropped out of Anchor Bay High School shortly after his\nsixteenth birthday. And we note that Daniels does not claim that he attempted to re-enroll in high\nschool after voluntarily withdrawing or that he was prevented from doing so.\n        Neither the Michigan Constitution nor any other Michigan law mandates that school districts\nprovide alternative education. See MICH. ATT’Y GEN. REP., No. 6271, p. 13 (February 7, 1985). But\nif the state—through the school district—creates in people of the plaintiff’s class in general an\nentitlement to an alternative education, the state may not withdraw that entitlement without adequate\nprocess. Goss, 419 U.S. at 574. We have not addressed in a published opinion the question of\nwhether Michigan residents are entitled to alternative education, although in an unpublished opinion,\nwe have held that Michigan residents have no property interest in adult education programs. In\nMercado v. Kingsley Area Schools, 956 F.2d 269, 1992 WL 34471 (6th Cir. 1992), we said that a\nMichigan student’s participation in adult education programs was analogous to interscholastic\n\fNos. 03-2053/2117/2369               Daniels v. Woodside, et al.

We think\nthat Mercado’s reasoning is sound but it is not dispositive of Daniels’s claim that although Anchor\nBay is not required to offer alternative education programs, by doing so it has created an entitlement\nto those programs.\n        Although it is under no mandate to do so, Anchor Bay has chosen to establish Skill Quest,\nan alternative education program for individuals such as Daniels, who are under the age of 19, have\nno high school diploma, and have been out of school for at least one semester. Importantly,\nhowever, Anchor Bay has limited participation in that program in two significant ways. First, the\nsuperintendent has discretion over who may be admitted to the program. Second, in order to remain\nin the program, students must abide by the program policies, including the attendance policy, and\nfailure to comply with the attendance policy results in automatic loss of course credit.\n        In order to establish a property interest in participating in the Skill Quest program, Daniels\nmust demonstrate that he has a “legitimate claim of entitlement” to that participation. Goss, 419\nU.S. at 573; LRL Properties v. Portage Metro Housing Authority, 55 F.3d 1097, 1108 (6th Cir.\n1995). Daniels cannot demonstrate any such entitlement because participation in the Skill Quest\nprogram is entirely at the discretion of the superintendent, and continues only so long as the\nparticipant abides by the program’s rules and policies. Daniels therefore has no property right in\nthe alternative education he sought.\n        Because Daniels cannot demonstrate any property right to alternative education in the Skill\nQuest program, he cannot demonstrate that Anchor Bay or Woodside denied him due process by\nenforcing the program’s automatic loss of credit resulting from his absence from class during his\npre-trial detention, or by refusing to permit him to re-enroll after his release from detention.\n                                                 III.\n       For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the orders of the district court granting summary\njudgment to Ronald Tuscany and to Anchor Bay School District. We REVERSE the district court’s\norder denying summary judgment to Leonard Woodside, and REMAND this matter to the district\ncourt with instructions to enter an order granting summary judgment to Woodside.\n\f",

Stepanski, JOHNSON, ROSATI, LaBARGE,\nASELTYNE & FIELD, Farmington Hills, Michigan, for Defendants.\n                                       _________________\n                                           OPINION\n                                       _________________\n         ALICE M. BATCHELDER, Circuit Judge. These consolidated appeals are taken from\njudgments entered by the district court in Matthew Daniels’s 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action arising out of\nDaniels’s pre-trial detention as a 16-year-old on charges of murder. Daniels appeals the district\ncourt’s grant of summary judgment to Ronald Tuscany, Macomb County Sheriff, on Daniels’s\nclaims that Tuscany violated his Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by permitting him\nto be housed in the Macomb County Jail as an adult in violation of the Michigan law governing pre-\ntrial detention of juveniles, and by housing him under inhumane conditions. Daniels also appeals\nthe district court’s grant of summary judgment to the Anchor Bay School District (“Anchor Bay”)\non his claim that Anchor Bay denied him due process by expelling him from an alternative education\nprogram upon his arrest and pre-trial detention, and refusing to permit him to re-enroll in that\nprogram after his release from pre-trial detention. Leonard Woodside, Anchor Bay’s superintendent,\nappeals the district court’s denial of his motion for summary judgment on Daniels’s due process\nclaim.\n        Daniels does not challenge the constitutionality of the Michigan law governing pre-trial\ndetention of juveniles but rather complains of Tuscany’s alleged violation of that law. Because we\nconclude that Daniels was confined in accordance with Michigan law and that the restrictions and\nconditions of his confinement were an incident of the state’s legitimate goal of preventing him from\ncommitting suicide, we will affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of Sheriff Tuscany.\nFurther, because we conclude that Michigan law does not create in a Michigan resident a property\nright in alternative education provided by a public school district, and therefore Anchor Bay and\nWoodside did not violate Daniels’s constitutional rights in terminating his participation in that\nprogram or in denying him readmission to it, we will affirm the grant of summary judgment to\nAnchor Bay and reverse the denial of summary judgment to Woodside.\n                      FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n         Daniels and two others were charged on October 27, 2000, with the murder of Justin Mello.\nDaniels was remanded by the Macomb County District Court to the custody of the Macomb County\nJail, an adult correctional facility, pending his preliminary examination. The court notified the jail\nadministrators, including Sheriff Tuscany, that because Daniels was 16 years old, he was to be\nsegregated from the adult prisoners in accordance with Michigan statutory law. When Daniels\narrived at the jail, he was initially housed in the medical ward, one of only three places in the\nMacomb County Jail where he could be segregated from adults. Shortly thereafter, he was\ntransferred to the mental health floor, another area where he could be segregated from adult\nprisoners, until mental health professionals could evaluate him and rule out any risk of suicide.\nRecords of Daniels’s mental health evaluations at the jail reflect that he expressed suicidal thoughts\n\fNos. 03-2053/2117/2369                Daniels v. Woodside, et al.                                Page 3\n\n\nduring the evaluations, and he was therefore placed on suicide watch. Daniels claims that while he\nwas on suicide watch, he was kept under twenty-four hour lock-down; he was not permitted to leave\nhis cell for four days, except for limited visits with a clergyman and an attorney; he was denied the\nability to attend to any basic hygiene needs; he was required to wear a “suicide robe,” which is a\nsleeveless, legless gown that did not adequately fasten in the back; and for the first several days of\nhis confinement he had neither socks for his feet nor sheets or pillows for his bed.\n         Daniels was released from jail after his preliminary hearing resulted in a finding of no\nprobable cause due to a lack of admissible evidence. After his release, Daniels asked Woodside to\nre-admit him to Anchor Bay’s voluntary alternative education program in which he had been\nenrolled for about one month prior to his arrest. This program, called “Skill Quest,” is described in\nthe literature of the school district as “a special alternative high school program which is offered\nduring the day for youth under 19 without diplomas, who have returned to school after being out for\nat least one semester.” Admission to the Skill Quest program is discretionary with the\nsuperintendent, and students in the program are required to adhere to the program’s attendance\npolicy and the school district’s written code of conduct. The attendance policy provides that if a\nstudent misses more than six hours of class, he automatically loses credit for that course.\n         Daniels had enrolled in Skill Quest some eight months after he dropped out of high school\nupon attaining the age of 16, the age at which Michigan law permits students to withdraw from\nschool. During the month in which Daniels was enrolled in the program, he had not missed any\nclasses or been subject to any disciplinary actions. Because of his arrest and pre-trial detention,\nhowever, Daniels missed substantially more than six hours of class. He therefore automatically lost\ncredit in the courses in which he was enrolled, and in order to participate any further in the program,\nhe was required to seek re-enrollment for the following semester. Superintendent Woodside denied\nDaniels’s request for readmission to Skill Quest, citing the advice of the school district’s counsel\nto the effect that, despite the court’s finding of no probable cause, Daniels was still implicated in the\nMello murder and presented a danger to students and staff. In April 2000, after another individual\nconfessed to the murder, Woodside notified Daniels that he would be permitted to enroll in Skill\nQuest at the commencement of the next semester, that is, in September 2001. Daniels enrolled at\nthat time, but after attending classes for only about one month, he began to accrue excessive\nabsences, lost class credit, and dropped out of the program.\n       On October 15, 2001, Daniels filed this 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action in the United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Michigan against numerous state, county and school district\ndefendants, complaining that these defendants had violated various of his constitutional rights in\nconnection with his arrest and pre-trial detention. Only defendants Tuscany, Woodside and Anchor\nBay remain in the action, all other defendants having been dismissed by stipulation of the parties\nduring the course of this litigation.\n        Daniels’s Complaint alleges that Woodside and Anchor Bay violated his right to due process\neither by refusing, without a hearing, to allow him to re-enroll in the Skill Quest program, or by\nexpelling him, without a hearing, from his initial participation in the Skill Quest program. Daniels\nclaims that Tuscany, as the Macomb County Sheriff, deprived Daniels of his rights under the Fifth,\nEighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution by improperly housing him\nas an adult and by mistreating him during his detention.\n        Tuscany moved for dismissal or, in the alternative, for summary judgment and the district\ncourt granted the motion. Anchor Bay and Woodside filed a joint motion for summary judgment.\nAnchor Bay argued that its policies are constitutional and have not been shown to be the cause of\nany injury to Daniels, and that the school district cannot be held vicariously liable for the acts of its\nemployees. Woodside argued that he is entitled to qualified immunity for his actions. The district\ncourt granted Anchor Bay’s motion, but denied Woodside’s. Woodside then filed a Motion to\n\fNos. 03-2053/2117/2369               Daniels v. Woodside, et al.                              Page 4\n\n\nAmend Judgment, arguing that Daniels did not have a property right in the alternative education\nprogram Skill Quest, and therefore Daniels’s due process rights were not violated when he was\ndropped from the program initially or when Woodside refused to re-enroll him in that program. The\ndistrict court denied the motion. Woodside brings an interlocutory appeal of the district court’s\ndenial of his motion for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds and the denial of his\nmotion to amend the judgment.\n       Daniels filed a motion to permit an interlocutory appeal of the district court’s order granting\nsummary judgment to Tuscany and Anchor Bay. The district court entered final judgment as to\nTuscany and Anchor Bay and certified Daniels’s dismissed claims for immediate appeal under\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), fully satisfying the requirements of that rule.\n                                            ANALYSIS\n        We review de novo a district court’s grant of summary judgment, using the same standard\nunder Rule 56(c) used by the district court.

In determining whether conditions of\npretrial confinement violate the Fifth, Fourteenth, or Eighth Amendments, the court must evaluate\nwhether a restriction imposed on a detainee was imposed for the purpose of punishment, or was in\nfurtherance of some other legitimate government goal. Roberts, 773 F.2d at 723.\n        As we understand his argument, Daniels claims that Tuscany, as Sheriff in charge of the\nMacomb County Jail where Daniels was housed, permitted Daniels to be housed in the jail as an\nadult in violation of Michigan law; that in doing so, Tuscany was deliberately indifferent to\nMichigan statutes governing the placement of juveniles being detained on criminal charges; and this\ndeliberate indifference violated Daniels’sEighth Amendment Right to be free from cruel and unusual\npunishment. Daniels, however, fails at the first step of his argument. He has not presented evidence\nthat Tuscany violated Michigan law.\n         As a general rule, in Michigan juveniles may not be confined in a jail while awaiting trial.\nM.C.L.A. § 764.27a(1). A judge may, however, order a juvenile to be detained in a jail before trial\nif he is “considered to be a menace to other children, or [he] may not otherwise be safely detained.”\nM.C.L.A. § 764.27a(2). If a juvenile is housed in a jail, then he must be kept “in a room or ward\n\fNos. 03-2053/2117/2369               Daniels v. Woodside, et al.                               Page 5\n\n\nout of sight and sound from adults.” M.C.L.A. § 764.27a(2). The evidence before the district court\nestablishes that the judge ordered Daniels to be housed at the jail and to be segregated from the adult\npopulation. The evidence further establishes that Daniels was at no time kept where he was within\neither sight of or sound from adults. The procedure followed by the judge and the jail staff in\ndetaining Daniels follows Michigan law to the letter.\n         Daniels also alleges that Tuscany violated Daniels’s constitutional rights under the Fifth,\nEighth, and Fourteenth Amendments by confining Daniels to twenty-four hour lock-down, depriving\nhim of exercise, dressing him in a suicide gown that did not completely close in the back as opposed\nto a jail uniform, denying him access to a shower and personal hygiene products such as soap and\ntoothpaste, and denying him visitors. Daniels asserts that there is a material question of fact as to\nwhether Tuscany had a legitimate purpose for imposing such restrictions. The record demonstrates,\nhowever, that Daniels told jail personnel of his suicidal thoughts. The deprivations imposed on\nDaniels were affirmative steps to secure Daniels’s well-being, in furtherance of the jail staff’s\nlegitimate and non-punitive purpose of preventing Daniels’s suicide or injury. The district court\nheld, and we agree, that Daniels’s attempts to create a genuine issue of fact with regard to this claim\nare without support in the record.\n                                                  II.\n        Daniels complains that Anchor Bay and Woodside denied him due process when, without\naffording him a hearing, they deprived him of his property interest in a free public education by\nterminating his participation in the Skill Quest program in which he was enrolled at the time of his\narrest and pre-trial detention, and refusing to permit him to enroll again in the program immediately\nfollowing his release from detention. “Property interests are not created by the Constitution, ‘they\nare created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an\nindependent source such as state law . . . .’” Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v.

Lopez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109136\"><a href=\"/opinion/109136/goss-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 573 (1975) (“Here, on the basis of state law, appellees plainly had legitimate claims of\nentitlement to a public education.”) There is no question that Michigan law gave Daniels a protected\nproperty interest in a free public education. M.C.L.A. Const. Art. 8, §2; see, e.g. Goss, 419 U.S. at\n574. The issue before us, however, is whether Daniels has a legitimate claim of entitlement to\nAnchor Bay’s program of alternative free public education.\n        The Michigan Constitution mandates “free public elementary and secondary schools as\ndefined by law,” rather than simply providing a broad right to “public education.” M.C.L.A. Const.\nArt. 8, §2 (emphasis added). Michigan law also requires residents between the ages of six and\nsixteen (through the sixteenth birthday) to attend school. M.C.L.A. §380.1561(1). There is no\nquestion that Daniels had the right to attend his local public high school. We conclude, however,\nthat he chose to forego that right when he dropped out of Anchor Bay High School shortly after his\nsixteenth birthday. And we note that Daniels does not claim that he attempted to re-enroll in high\nschool after voluntarily withdrawing or that he was prevented from doing so.\n        Neither the Michigan Constitution nor any other Michigan law mandates that school districts\nprovide alternative education. See MICH. ATT’Y GEN. REP., No. 6271, p. 13 (February 7, 1985). But\nif the state—through the school district—creates in people of the plaintiff’s class in general an\nentitlement to an alternative education, the state may not withdraw that entitlement without adequate\nprocess. Goss, 419 U.S. at 574. We have not addressed in a published opinion the question of\nwhether Michigan residents are entitled to alternative education, although in an unpublished opinion,\nwe have held that Michigan residents have no property interest in adult education programs. In\nMercado v. Kingsley Area Schools, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">956</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">269</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">34471</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 1992), we said that a\nMichigan student’s participation in adult education programs was analogous to interscholastic\n\fNos. 03-2053/2117/2369               Daniels v. Woodside, et al.                              Page 6\n\n\nathletics, rather than to public education, inasmuch as Michigan law did not require school districts\nto offer either interscholastic athletic programs or adult education programs. Id. at **3. We think\nthat Mercado’s reasoning is sound but it is not dispositive of Daniels’s claim that although Anchor\nBay is not required to offer alternative education programs, by doing so it has created an entitlement\nto those programs.\n        Although it is under no mandate to do so, Anchor Bay has chosen to establish Skill Quest,\nan alternative education program for individuals such as Daniels, who are under the age of 19, have\nno high school diploma, and have been out of school for at least one semester. Importantly,\nhowever, Anchor Bay has limited participation in that program in two significant ways. First, the\nsuperintendent has discretion over who may be admitted to the program. Second, in order to remain\nin the program, students must abide by the program policies, including the attendance policy, and\nfailure to comply with the attendance policy results in automatic loss of course credit.\n        In order to establish a property interest in participating in the Skill Quest program, Daniels\nmust demonstrate that he has a “legitimate claim of entitlement” to that participation. Goss, 419\nU.S. at 573; LRL Properties v. Portage Metro Housing Authority, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"696596\"><a href=\"/opinion/696596/lrl-properties-v-portage-metro-housing-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1097</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1108 (6th Cir.\n1995). Daniels cannot demonstrate any such entitlement because participation in the Skill Quest\nprogram is entirely at the discretion of the superintendent, and continues only so long as the\nparticipant abides by the program’s rules and policies. Daniels therefore has no property right in\nthe alternative education he sought.\n        Because Daniels cannot demonstrate any property right to alternative education in the Skill\nQuest program, he cannot demonstrate that Anchor Bay or Woodside denied him due process by\nenforcing the program’s automatic loss of credit resulting from his absence from class during his\npre-trial detention, or by refusing to permit him to re-enroll after his release from detention.\n                                                 III.\n       For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the orders of the district court granting summary\njudgment to Ronald Tuscany and to Anchor Bay School District. We REVERSE the district court’s\norder denying summary judgment to Leonard Woodside, and REMAND this matter to the district\ncourt with instructions to enter an order granting summary judgment to Woodside.\n\f</pre>",
