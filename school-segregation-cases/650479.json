I. In its now-famous Citizens United v. FEC decision,\nthe Supreme Court recognized that the First Amendment \"has\nits fullest and most urgent application to speech uttered during\na campaign for political office.\" 130 S. Ct. 876, 898 (2010)\n(quoting Eu v. S.F. Cnty. Democratic Cent. Comm., 489 U.S.\n214, 223 (1989)) (internal quotation marks omitted). How-\never, at the same time, the Supreme Court has emphasized the\nimportance of providing the electorate with information about\nthe source of campaign spending—even when these disclo-\nsure requirements burden election-related speech. See, e.g.,\nMcConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S. 93, 196 (2003), overruled on\nother grounds by Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. 876; Buckley v.\nValeo, 424 U.S. 1, 64, 66-67 (1976) (per curiam). In this case,\n\f6           CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT\nwe confront the delicate balance between protecting political\nspeech and informing the electorate about the organizations\nthat bankroll modern elections. Specifically, we consider\nwhether West Virginia’s campaign-finance reporting and dis-\nclaimer requirements can survive constitutional scrutiny.\n\n   Appellee and Cross-Appellant Center for Individual Free-\ndom (CFIF) and Appellee West Virginians for Life (WVFL)\nare § 501(c)(4) organizations that engage in election-related\nspeech. These organizations and Zane Lawhorn1—a West Vir-\nginia resident who wishes to receive WVFL’s communica-\ntions—brought suit against West Virginia’s secretary of state,\nmembers of the West Virginia State Election Commission,\nand a class of West Virginia’s prosecuting attorneys, alleging\nthat West Virginia’s campaign finance statutes were constitu-\ntionally impermissible. The district court struck down some of\nthe provisions and upheld other portions of the statutory\nscheme, and both West Virginia2 and CFIF appealed. We now\naffirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceed-\nings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                    I.\n\n                                    A.\n\n   Following the 2004 election, the West Virginia legislature\nacted to strengthen the state’s election statutes due to an \"ex-\nplosion of expenditures by groups independent of candidates.\"\nThese new laws required organizations to file reports with the\nWest Virginia secretary of state and include disclaimers on\ntheir communications when they made certain election-related\nexpenditures and engaged in campaign-related speech. CFIF\nand WVFL filed separate challenges to the new laws, alleging\n    1\n     For purposes of this opinion, we refer to WVFL and Lawhorn collec-\ntively as \"WVFL.\"\n   2\n     We refer to this case’s Defendants, Appellants, and Cross-Appellees as\n\"West Virginia\" for ease of reference.\n\f            CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT                     7\nthat they feared prosecution under the statutes because they\ndisseminated communications that fell within the laws’ scope\nbut were unwilling to disclose the sources of their contribu-\ntions.\n\n   CFIF’s mission \"is to protect and defend individual free-\ndoms and individual rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitu-\ntion.\" CFIF plans to use broadcast media, print media, and\ntelephone banks \"to speak to the public in the Southern Dis-\ntrict of West Virginia on matters of litigation reform and\nrelated justice issues, including criminal law enforcement and\nsentencing, legal reform, and judicial decision-making.\" To\nthis end, CFIF will \"refer to West Virginia candidates to illus-\ntrate its points and ask members of the public to contact the\ncandidates and petition them to take or maintain certain posi-\ntions.\" WVFL, in turn, aims \"to present information upon\nwhich individuals and the general public may make informed\ndecisions about such topics as fetal development, abortion and\nits alternatives, and euthanasia.\" To further this purpose,\n\"WVFL has distributed candidate-comparison fliers, placed\ncandidate comparisons in ads for newspaper and television as\nwell as on the Internet, and issued petitions and mailings.\" In\nsum, both CFIF and WVFL engage in election-related speech\nto promote their organizational goals.\n\n                                    B.\n\n   CFIF filed its initial complaint against Betty Ireland3\n—West Virginia’s secretary of state—and a class of West\nVirginia’s prosecuting attorneys on March 21, 2008, challeng-\ning West Virginia’s reporting and disclaimer requirements for\n(1) expenses associated with \"advocating or opposing the\nnomination, election or defeat of any candidate;\" (2) expendi-\ntures \"in support of or opposition to the nomination or elec-\n  3\n    In 2009, Appellant and Cross-Appellee Natalie Tennant replaced for-\nmer Defendant Betty Ireland as West Virginia’s secretary of state. The dis-\ntrict court substituted Tennant for Ireland on January 19, 2009.\n\f8         CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT\ntion\" of a candidate; and (3) \"electioneering communication.\"\nBy order, the district court permitted the West Virginia Edu-\ncation Association (WVEA), the West Virginia American\nFederation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations\n(AFL-CIO), Robert M. Bastress, Jr., Margaret L. Workman,\nand Menis E. Ketchum to intervene as defendants. The West\nVirginia AFL-CIO and WVEA intervened due to their \"con-\ncrete interests, distinct from those of other parties, in uphold-\ning the West Virginia campaign finance provisions at issue.\"\nBastress, Workman, and Ketchum were each seeking nomina-\ntion for election to a seat on the West Virginia Supreme Court\nof Appeals and alleged that CFIF had targeted them through\nits communications.\n\n   On April 22, 2008, the district court entered an injunction\npreventing West Virginia from applying the campaign finance\nstatutes to \"anything other than communications that\nexpressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identi-\nfied candidate\" and restricting the definition of \"electioneer-\ning communication\" to certain broadcast media. Ctr. for\nIndividual Freedom, Inc. v. Ireland (CFIF I), No. 1:08-00190,\n2008 WL 1837324, at *7 (S.D. W. Va. Apr. 22, 2008).\nShortly thereafter, the West Virginia legislature amended the\ncode sections that were the subject of the injunction, and West\nVirginia moved to dissolve the injunction, arguing that the\namendments rendered it moot. The district court granted West\nVirginia’s motion and directed CFIF to seek a new injunction\nbased on the amended language.\n\n   On September 30, 2008, WVFL filed its verified complaint\nand motion for a preliminary injunction raising challenges to\nthe amended statutory provisions. Specifically, WVFL chal-\nlenged the statutory scheme’s reporting requirements and its\ndefinitions of \"electioneering communication\" and \"expressly\nadvocating.\" Less than a week later, CFIF filed a motion for\na preliminary injunction and challenged many of the same\nprovisions, and the district court consolidated the two cases:\nCenter for Individual Freedom, Inc. v. Ireland, No. 1:08-cv-\n\f          CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT            9\n00190, and West Virginians for Life, Inc. v. Ireland, No. 1:08-\ncv-0113. The district court issued its memorandum opinion\nand order regarding the preliminary injunction motions on\nOctober 17, 2008, and released its amended opinion and order\non February 12, 2009. Notably, the district court held that (1)\nWest Virginia’s definition of \"expressly advocating\" was\nvague and (2) its definition of \"electioneering communica-\ntion\" was overbroad because it applied to more media than the\ndefinition that appears in the federal Bipartisan Campaign\nReform Act (BCRA), which—unlike West Virginia’s then-\nexisting definition—includes only broadcast media. The court\ntherefore granted CFIF’s and WVFL’s requests for prelimi-\nnary injunctions with respect to those provisions. See Ctr. for\nIndividual Freedom, Inc. v. Ireland (CFIF II), 613 F. Supp.\n2d 777, 790-92, 800-01 (S.D. W. Va. 2009).\n\n  After the district court ruled on their preliminary injunction\nmotions, both CFIF and WVFL moved for summary judg-\nment. However, due to pending petitions for rehearing en\nbanc and a writ of certiorari in The Real Truth About Obama,\nInc. v. FEC, 575 F.3d 342 (4th Cir. 2009), the district court\ngranted WVFL’s motion to stay the case on September 16,\n2009. The Supreme Court ultimately granted the certiorari\npetition, vacated this Court’s decision in Real Truth, and\nremanded the case in light of Citizens United, see The Real\nTruth About Obama, Inc. v. FEC, 130 S. Ct. 2371 (2010),\ncausing the district court to dissolve the stay on May 26,\n2010.\n\n                              C.\n\n   In 2010, West Virginia’s legislature amended the provi-\nsions at issue in this case for a second time. The amendments\nwent into effect on June 11, 2010, and concerned West Vir-\nginia Code section 3-8-1, which states the purposes of the\nlaw; section 3-8-1a, which includes the definitions of \"elec-\ntioneering communication\" and \"expressly advocating\"; and\nsection 3-8-2, which lays out the requirements for reporting\n\f10          CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT\nelection-related spending that is not coordinated with a candi-\ndate or political party, also known as independent expendi-\ntures. Presumably to more closely comport with the October\n2008 preliminary injunction order,4 the West Virginia legisla-\nture removed direct mailings, telephone banks, and billboard\nadvertising from the \"electioneering communication\" defini-\ntion. See W. Va. Code § 3-8-1a(11)(A). In relevant part, the\nlatest version of the statute requires individuals and organiza-\ntions to (1) file reports with West Virginia’s secretary of state\nif they make independent expenditures of a certain amount,\nid. § 3-8-2(b)(1), (c)(1)-(2), (d)(1)-(2); (2) file reports with\nWest Virginia’s secretary of state if they engage in election-\neering communication, which \"means any paid communica-\ntion made by broadcast, cable or satellite signal, or published\nin any newspaper, magazine or other periodical,\" id. §§ 3-8-\n1a(11)(A), 3-9-2b(a)(1)-(2); and (3) include disclaimers on\nelectioneering communications and communications financed\nby independent expenditures identifying the individuals mak-\ning the expenditure and indicating that a candidate or candi-\ndate’s committee did not authorize the communication, id.\n§§ 3-8-2(2), 3-8-2b(e).\n\n   CFIF filed a renewed motion for summary judgment on\nSeptember 14, 2010, and WVFL filed a second motion for\nsummary judgment on the same day. Both organizations con-\ntended that the amendments failed to remedy the constitu-\ntional defects in the campaign finance regime. On August 3,\n2011, the district court granted in part and denied in part their\nmotions for summary judgment. See Ctr. for Individual Free-\ndom, Inc. v. Tennant (CFIF III), 849 F. Supp. 2d 659 (S.D.\nW. Va. 2011). In its opinion, the district court came to the fol-\nlowing pertinent conclusions:\n  4\n    The West Virginia legislature provides little, if any, formal legislative\nhistory. See Ctr. for Individual Freedom v. Tennant, 849 F. Supp. 2d 659,\n668 n.6 (S.D. W. Va. 2011); Appalachian Power Co. v. Sadler, 314 F.\nSupp. 2d 639, 641 n.2 (S.D. W. Va. 2004).\n\f          CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT            11\n1. The district court held that subsection (C) of the statute’s\n   definition of \"expressly advocating\"—which defines \"ex-\n   pressly advocating\" as \"any communication that . . . [i]s\n   susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an\n   appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,\" W. Va.\n   Code § 3-8-1a(12)(C)—was fatally vague. The court there-\n   fore severed subsection (C) from the remainder of the defi-\n   nition. CFIF III, 849 F. Supp. 2d at 685-87.\n\n2. The district court held that West Virginia’s inclusion of\n   periodicals in its definition of \"electioneering communica-\n   tion\" rendered the definition overbroad. Id. at 697. In\n   reaching its conclusion, the district court emphasized the\n   West Virginia legislature’s failure to develop a record or\n   make findings that supported its inclusion of print media.\n   See id. at 694-97. Consequently, the court severed West\n   Virginia Code section 3-8-1a(11)’s reference to materials\n   \"published in any newspaper, magazine or other periodi-\n   cal.\" Id. at 697.\n\n3. The court determined that various exemptions to the \"elec-\n   tioneering communication\" definition were constitutional.\n   First, the court upheld a \"grassroots lobbying\" exemption,\n   which provides that \"electioneering communication\" does\n   not include \"communication[s] made while the Legislature\n   is in session which, incidental to promoting or opposing a\n   specific piece of legislation pending before the Legislature,\n   urges the audience to communicate with a member or\n   members of the Legislature concerning that piece of legis-\n   lation.\" W. Va. Code § 3-8-1a(11)(B)(v); CFIF III, 849 F.\n   Supp. 2d at 700-03. Second, the court declined to address\n   the merits of CFIF’s challenge to an exemption for \"bona\n   fide news account[s],\" which provides:\n\n    (i) A news story, commentary or editorial dissemi-\n    nated through the facilities of any broadcast, cable or\n    satellite television or radio station, newspaper, maga-\n    zine or other periodical publication not owned or\n\f12         CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT\n     controlled by a political party, political committee or\n     candidate: Provided, That a news story disseminated\n     through a medium owned or controlled by a political\n     party, political committee or candidate is neverthe-\n     less exempt if the news is:\n\n         (I) A bona fide news account communi-\n         cated in a publication of general circulation\n         or through a licensed broadcasting facili-\n         ty[.]\n\nW. Va. Code § 3-8-1a(11)(B)(i). The court determined that\nCFIF lacked standing to challenge this exemption because\nCFIF failed to demonstrate that it intended to publish news\nstories or functioned as a \"political party, political committee\nor candidate.\" CFIF III, 849 F. Supp. 2d at 707. Third, the\ncourt upheld a provision that exempts communications by\n§ 501(c)(3) organizations because federal law prohibits these\ngroups from engaging in express advocacy. Id. at 707-09.\n\n4. The district court determined that the statutory scheme’s\n   twenty-four-hour and forty-eight-hour reporting and dis-\n   claimer requirements could survive exacting scrutiny.\n   CFIF III, 849 F. Supp. 2d at 711-15.\n\n5. However, the district court concluded that the reporting\n   requirement for electioneering communications was\n   ambiguous insofar as it mandated disclosure of the \"names\n   and addresses of any contributors who contributed a total\n   of more than one thousand dollars between the first day of\n   the preceding calendar year and the disclosure date and\n   whose contributions were used to pay for electioneering\n   communications.\" W. Va. Code § 3-8-2b(b)(5) (emphasis\n   added); CFIF III, 849 F. Supp. 2d at 717-19. To cure the\n   ambiguity of the emphasized portion, the court restricted\n   the reporting requirement to \"individuals who respond to\n   a solicitation for electioneering communications or ear-\n   mark their contributions for such use.\" Id. at 719.\n\f          CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT           13\nThe district court chose not to vacate the April 2008 and\nOctober 2008 injunctions due to the legislature’s amend-\nments, which would have allowed West Virginia to prosecute\ngroups for violating the enjoined portions of the statutory\nscheme while the injunctions were in effect. Instead, the dis-\ntrict court \"dissolve[ed]\" the injunctions, thereby prohibiting\nthese prosecutions. CFIF III, 849 F. Supp. 2d at 719-20.\n\n                              D.\n\n   West Virginia now appeals the district court’s determina-\ntion that subsection (C) of the statute’s \"expressly advocating\"\ndefinition was vague, its decision to strike periodicals from\nthe \"electioneering communication\" definition, and its deci-\nsion to apply an \"earmarked funds\" limiting construction to\nthe reporting requirement for electioneering communications.\nFurthermore, West Virginia contends that the district court\nshould have vacated the earlier injunctions as moot rather\nthan barring prosecutions for violations that occurred when\nthe injunctions were in effect. CFIF cross-appeals the court’s\nconclusion that it lacked standing to challenge the \"bona fide\nnews account\" exemption and its determinations that the\n\"grassroots lobbying\" and § 501(c)(3) exemptions were con-\nstitutional. Although WVFL did not file a notice of appeal in\nthis case, it contends that, if we uphold the statutory scheme’s\n\"electioneering communication\" and \"expressly advocating\"\ndefinitions, we should strike down the reporting and dis-\nclaimer requirements due to these provisions’ alleged vague-\nness and overbreadth. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. § 1291. The WVEA, the West Virginia AFL-CIO,\nBastress, Workman, and Ketchum are not parties to this\nappeal.\n\n   We affirm the district court’s decisions to (1) strike \"news-\npaper, magazine or other periodical\" from West Virginia’s\n\"electioneering communication\" definition; (2) uphold the\n\"electioneering communication\" definition’s exemption for\ngrassroots lobbying; (3) decline to consider the merits of\n\f14        CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT\nCFIF’s challenge to the bona fide news accounts exemption\nbecause the organization lacks standing; and (4) prohibit pros-\necutions for violations that occurred while the earlier injunc-\ntions were in effect. However, we reverse the district court’s\ndecision with respect to (1) its conclusion that subsection (C)\nof the \"expressly advocating\" definition is unconstitutional;\n(2) its choice to uphold the \"electioneering communication\"\ndefinition’s § 501(c)(3) exemption; and (3) its application of\nan \"earmarked funds\" limiting construction to the reporting\nrequirement for electioneering communications. Because\nWVFL did not file a notice of appeal in this case, we cannot\nconsider its challenge to the district court’s finding that the\nstatutory scheme’s twenty-four- and forty-eight-hour report-\ning requirements are constitutional. We consequently affirm\nin part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                               II.\n\n   A court considering a summary judgment motion must\nview the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.\nUnited States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655 (1962) (per\ncuriam). We review de novo both the district court’s decision\nto grant in part and deny in part CFIF’s and WVFL’s motions\nfor summary judgment and its conclusions of law. Moore\nBros. Co. v. Brown & Root, Inc., 207 F.3d 717, 724 (4th Cir.\n2000); Shaw v. Stroud, 13 F.3d 791, 798 (4th Cir. 1994). With\nrespect to the district court’s decision to prohibit prosecutions\nfor violations that occurred while the April 2008 and October\n2008 injunctions were in place, we review for abuse of discre-\ntion. See Conservation Council of N.C. v. Costanzo, 528 F.2d\n250, 251-52 (4th Cir. 1975).\n\n                              III.\n\n   First, we consider West Virginia’s contention that the dis-\ntrict court erred in concluding that subsection (C) of the stat-\nute’s     definition    of    \"expressly     advocating\"      is\n\f           CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT              15\nunconstitutionally vague. Subsection (C) provides that \"ex-\npressly advocating\" includes \"any communication that . . . [i]s\nsusceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an\nappeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.\" W. Va.\nCode § 3-8-1a(12)(C). The statutory scheme incorporates the\nphrase \"expressly advocating\" into the definition of \"indepen-\ndent expenditure\" and does not include the phrase elsewhere.\nPursuant to the statute, an \"independent expenditure\" is \"an\nexpenditure . . . [e]xpressly advocating the election or defeat\nof a clearly identified candidate\" and \"[t]hat is not made in\nconcert or cooperation with or at the request or suggestion of\nsuch candidate, his or her agents, the candidates authorized\npolitical committee or a political party committee or its\nagents.\" W. Va. Code § 3-8-1a(15).\n\n   Relying on FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., (WRTL\nII), 551 U.S. 449 (2007), the district court determined that the\nSupreme Court endorsed \"appeal to vote\" tests—such as sub-\nsection (C)—only within the confines of the BCRA’s \"elec-\ntioneering communication\" definition. CFIF III, 849 F. Supp.\n2d at 686-97. In other words, the district court held that, pur-\nsuant to WRTL II, provisions such as subsection (C) can sur-\nvive vagueness challenges only when they reach\ncommunications that (1) are disseminated via cable, broad-\ncast, or satellite; (2) refer to a clearly identified candidate; (3)\nare disseminated within certain time periods before an elec-\ntion; and (4) are directed at the relevant electorate. The dis-\ntrict court declined to fully address CFIF’s and WVFL’s\noverbreadth challenges because it invalidated subsection (C)\non vagueness grounds. Id. at 685. For the reasons discussed\nbelow, we find that the district court erred in holding that sub-\nsection (C) is vague and decline to strike down the provision\non overbreadth grounds.\n\n   Statutory provisions are unconstitutionally vague if they\nfail to \"give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable\nopportunity to know what is prohibited.\" Grayned v. City of\nRockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108 (1972). When a statute \"is capa-\n\f16        CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT\nble of reaching expression sheltered by the First Amendment,\nthe [vagueness] doctrine demands a greater degree of specific-\nity than in other contexts.\" Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S. 566,\n573 (1974); United States v. Sun, 278 F.3d 302, 309 (4th Cir.\n2002). Due to this Court’s recent decision in The Real Truth\nAbout Abortion, Inc. v. FEC, 681 F.3d 544 (4th Cir. 2012),\nCFIF’s and WVFL’s vagueness arguments cannot succeed. In\nReal Truth, this Court held that the federal definition of \"ex-\npressly advocating\" is not unconstitutionally vague. Id. at 555.\nPer the federal definition—which appears in 11 C.F.R.\n§ 100.22(b)—\"expressly advocating\" is a communication that,\n\n     [w]hen taken as a whole and with limited reference\n     to external events, such as the proximity to the elec-\n     tion, could only be interpreted by a reasonable per-\n     son as containing advocacy of the election or defeat\n     of one or more clearly identified candidate(s)\n     because—\n\n     (1) The electoral portion of the communication is\n     unmistakable, unambiguous, and suggestive of only\n     one meaning; and\n\n     (2) Reasonable minds could not differ as to whether\n     it encourages actions to elect or defeat one or more\n     clearly identified candidate(s) or encourages some\n     other kind of action.\n\nReal Truth held that the differences between § 100.22(b) and\nthe WRTL II \"functional equivalent\" test—which specifies\nthat \"a court should find that an ad is the functional equivalent\nof express advocacy only if the ad is susceptible of no reason-\nable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or\nagainst a specific candidate,\" WRTL II, 551 U.S. at 470-\n71—were \"not meaningful.\" Real Truth, 681 F.3d at 552.\nBecause the WRTL II test and the portion of the West Virginia\ndefinition at issue here are identical, Real Truth’s holding\n\f          CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT           17\napplies to this case. We therefore hold that subsection (C) is\nnot unconstitutionally vague.\n\n   Although CFIF and WVFL argue that this Court’s decision\nin North Carolina Right to Life, Inc. v. Leake, 525 F.3d 274\n(4th Cir. 2008), necessitates finding that subsection (C) is\nvague, the situation at issue in Leake is distinguishable from\nthe circumstances in this case for the same reasons this Court\ndistinguished it in Real Truth. Notably, like the provision\nbefore this Court in Real Truth, the \"expressly advocating\"\ndefinition under review in this case is a component of West\nVirginia’s \"independent expenditure\" definition. W. Va. Code\n§ 3-8-1a(15); Real Truth, 681 F.3d at 553. The Leake panel\nelected to cabin the North Carolina provision at issue in that\ncase within the confines of the statute’s \"electioneering com-\nmunication\" definition due to concerns about the provision’s\nbroad applicability. Leake, 525 F.3d at 283-84. Those con-\ncerns are not at play in this case because, as previously noted,\nthe West Virginia legislature embedded the \"expressly advo-\ncating\" term within the \"independent expenditure\" definition,\nthereby limiting its applicability. Consequently, Leake does\nnot alter our conclusion that Real Truth compels us to reverse\nthe district court’s determination that subsection (C) is uncon-\nstitutionally vague.\n\n   Because the district court erred in invalidating subsection\n(C) on vagueness grounds, we must consider whether the pro-\nvision is impermissibly broad. WVFL argues in its reply brief\nthat subsection (C) is overbroad because it reaches beyond\nexpress advocacy, and CFIF adopts this contention in its brief.\nReal Truth again controls our decision because the federal\nregulatory provision at issue in that case is comparable to sub-\nsection (C) of West Virginia Code section 3-8-1a(12). In Real\nTruth, this Court emphasized the Supreme Court’s Citizens\nUnited decision, which explained that regulators need not\nlimit disclosure requirements to \"speech that is the functional\nequivalent of express advocacy.\" Real Truth, 681 F.3d at 551-\n52 (citing Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 890). Because regula-\n\f18         CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT\ntions may extend beyond speech that is the functional equiva-\nlent of express advocacy and subsection (C) invokes WRTL\nII’s \"functional equivalent\" test, subsection (C) cannot be\noverbroad. Therefore, CFIF and WVFL’s overbreadth argu-\nment fails, and we hold that subsection (C) is constitutional.\n\n                               IV.\n\n  Next, we consider the constitutionality of the West Virginia\nCode’s definition of \"electioneering communication.\" Section\n3-8-1a(11) defines the term as\n\n     any paid communication made by broadcast, cable or\n     satellite signal, or published in any newspaper, mag-\n     azine or other periodical that:\n\n     (i) Refers to a clearly identified candidate for Gover-\n     nor, Secretary of State, Attorney General, Treasurer,\n     Auditor, Commissioner of Agriculture, Supreme\n     Court of Appeals or the Legislature;\n\n     (ii) Is publicly disseminated within:\n\n         (I) Thirty days before a primary election at\n         which the nomination for office sought by\n         the candidate is to be determined; or\n\n         (II) Sixty days before a general or special\n         election at which the office sought by the\n         candidate is to be filled; and\n\n     (iii) Is targeted to the relevant electorate.\n\nCFIF challenges the definition’s inclusion of materials \"pub-\nlished in any newspaper, magazine or other periodical.\"\n\n  In Citizens United, the Supreme Court specified that courts\nshould apply \"exacting scrutiny\" to evaluate campaign\n\f          CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT            19\nfinance disclaimer and disclosure provisions, such as the\n\"electioneering communication\" definition. 130 S. Ct. at 914.\nThis standard requires the government to show that the statute\nbears a \"substantial relation\" to a \"sufficiently important\"\ngovernmental interest. Id. (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 64,\n66). CFIF alleges that the \"electioneering communication\"\ndefinition fails to survive exacting scrutiny for two reasons:\n(1) the government has no interest that justifies the statute’s\napplication to non-broadcast media, and (2) even if the gov-\nernment could demonstrate a sufficiently important interest,\nthe legislature’s failure to empirically justify the statute’s\napplication to periodicals renders it overbroad and prevents it\nfrom bearing a substantial relation to West Virginia’s stated\ninterests. As we explain below, the district court correctly\nagreed with CFIF’s second contention, so we affirm the dis-\ntrict court’s decision to sever West Virginia Code section 3-8-\n1a(11)’s reference to materials \"published in any newspaper,\nmagazine or other periodical.\"\n\n                    Governmental Interest\n\n   We first address CFIF’s argument that West Virginia has\nno sufficiently important governmental interest that justifies\nthe statutory scheme’s application to non-broadcast media. In\nBuckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court highlighted three state\ninterests that can justify disclosure requirements: (1) \"provid[-\ning] the electorate with information\" about the source of\ncampaign-related spending, (2) \"deter[ring] actual corruption\nand avoid[ing] the appearance of corruption,\" and (3) \"gather-\ning the data necessary to detect violations of . . . contribution\nlimitations.\" 424 U.S. at 66-67. The second inter-\nest—preventing corruption and the appearance of corrup-\ntion—does not apply to the case at hand because\n\"electioneering communication\" does not include activity by\ncandidates or their committees. See W. Va. Code § 3-8-\n1a(11)(B)(ii). \"Electioneering communication\" therefore\nincludes only materials that third parties finance, and the\nSupreme Court has held that third-party expenditures \"do not\n\f20         CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT\ngive rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.\" Citi-\nzens United, 130 S. Ct. at 909; see also Leake, 525 F.3d at\n292 (explaining that \"independent expenditures are made\nwithout candidate consultation, rendering it unlikely that such\nexpenditures would be made in exchange for ‘improper com-\nmitments from the candidate’\" (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at\n47)). The third interest—gathering data to enforce more sub-\nstantive electioneering restrictions—is also inapposite\nbecause states cannot limit contributions collected to fund\nindependent electioneering communications or prohibit such\ncommunications. See Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 913. Con-\nsequently, West Virginia cannot use the second or third Buck-\nley interests to justify its \"electioneering communication\"\ndefinition.\n\n   However, West Virginia can rely on the first interest: pro-\nviding the electorate with election-related information.\nRequiring organizations and individuals who engage in elec-\ntioneering communication to file certain reports \"alert[s] the\nvoter to the interests to which a candidate is most likely to be\nresponsive and thus facilitate[s] predictions of future perfor-\nmance in office.\" Buckley, 424 U.S. at 67. Furthermore, as the\nSupreme Court recognized in McConnell v. FEC, organiza-\ntions such as CFIF often have \"dubious and misleading\nnames,\" and \"disclosure provisions require these organiza-\ntions to reveal their identities so that the public is able to iden-\ntify the source of the funding behind . . . advertisements\ninfluencing certain elections.\" 540 U.S. at 196-97. Despite\nCFIF’s argument that the public’s informational interest\nextends only to broadcast media, there is no reason why the\npublic would not have a similar interest in knowing the source\nof campaign-related spending when it takes the form of print\ncommunication. Therefore, West Virginia can point to its\ninterest in informing the public to justify including print\nmedia in its \"electioneering communication\" definition.\n\n                      Substantial Relation\n\n   Next, West Virginia must be able to demonstrate that\nincluding materials \"published in any newspaper, magazine or\n\f           CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT             21\nother periodical\" in its \"electioneering communication\" defi-\nnition bears a substantial relation to the state’s interest in pro-\nviding information. The district court concluded that West\nVirginia failed to make this showing because the state legisla-\nture neglected to make findings regarding the need to regulate\nnon-targeted print communications, which rendered the \"elec-\ntioneering communication\" definition fatally overbroad. CFIF\nIII, 849 F. Supp. 2d at 696-97. In Turner Broadcasting Sys-\ntem, Inc. v. FCC, the Supreme Court explained that, \"[e]ven\nin the realm of First Amendment questions,\" legislatures\n\"must base [their] conclusions on substantial evidence.\" 520\nU.S. 180, 196 (1997). The Turner Court pointed out that\ncourts must defer to legislative findings because legislatures\nare \"far better equipped than the judiciary to amass and evalu-\nate the vast amounts of data bearing upon legislative ques-\ntions.\" Id. at 195 (quoting Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. FCC,\n512 U.S. 622, 665-66 (1994)) (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). In another opinion, the Supreme Court clarified that the\n\"quantum of empirical evidence\" required should \"vary up or\ndown with the novelty and plausibility of the justification\" for\nthe regulation. Nixon v. Shrink Mo. Gov’t PAC, 528 U.S. 377,\n391 (2000). Because West Virginia has raised a well-accepted\nrationale for its electioneering communication defini-\ntion—informing the electorate—its evidentiary burden falls at\nthe bottom of this spectrum.\n\n   Nevertheless, we find that the district court correctly deter-\nmined that West Virginia failed to demonstrate a substantial\nrelation between its interest in informing the electorate and its\ndecision to include periodicals—but not other non-broadcast\nmaterials—in its \"electioneering communication\" definition.\nHowever, recognizing that we may \"affirm the district court\non any ground that would support the judgment in favor of the\nparty prevailing below,\" Everett v. Pitt Cnty. Bd. of Educ.,\n678 F.3d 281, 291 (4th Cir. 2012) (quoting Crosby v. City of\nGastonia, 635 F.3d 634, 643 n.10 (4th Cir. 2011)) (internal\nquotation marks omitted), we reach our conclusion using a\ndifferent logical path than the district court. The district court\n\f22        CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT\nbased its ruling on the \"conclusory\" and \"anecdotal\" nature of\nthe affidavits that West Virginia used to establish the need to\nregulate periodicals, stating that \"[a]lthough several of the\naffidavits illustrate the potential of non-broadcast media as an\neffective electioneering tool, none of them presents anything\nmore than anecdotal claims.\" CFIF III, 849 F. Supp. 2d at\n694. However, in Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC,\nthe Supreme Court credited an affidavit that noted that \"large\ncontributions have ‘the real potential to buy votes’\" and found\nthat the quoted language and several newspaper articles pro-\nvided sufficient justification for the campaign finance law at\nissue in that case. 528 U.S. at 393-94. In fact, the Supreme\nCourt noted that the case did not even \"present a close call.\"\nId. at 393. In light of Nixon, the district court mistakenly dis-\ncounted affidavits supporting the inclusion of periodicals in\nthe \"electioneering communication\" definition.\n\n   When combined with other materials in the record, the affi-\ndavits discussed above provide ample support for including\nnewspapers, magazines, and other periodicals in West Virgin-\nia’s \"electioneering communication\" definition. The West\nVirginia Code specifies that the West Virginia legislature\nenacted the campaign finance regime to \"serve[ ] a substantial\ngovernmental interest in informing the electorate.\" W. Va\nCode. § 3-8-1(a)(5). Furthermore, the statute explicitly men-\ntions the legislature’s fear that \"[f]ailing to regulate non-\nbroadcast media messages would permit those desiring to\ninfluence elections to avoid the principles and policies that are\nembodied in existing state law.\" Id. § 3-8-1(a)(7). The affida-\nvits explain that including non-broadcast media—such as\nperiodicals—in the \"electioneering communication\" definition\naddresses these concerns. David H. Gold, the president of a\ndirect mailing company, attested that \"[t]he use of direct mail\nand other forms of non-broadcast media is and has been\nincreasing\" and that limiting disclosure rules to broadcast\nmedia causes \"entities seeking to hide the source of their\nfunds [to] shift their expenditures into direct mail and other\ncost effective non-broadcast media.\" In fact, as Pamela M.\n\f           CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT            23\nVan Horn—the executive director of the West Virginia Dem-\nocratic Legislative Council—highlighted in her affidavit,\nCFIF itself shifted its spending from broadcast media to\nnewspaper advertisements so it did not have to comply with\nWest Virginia’s reporting requirements. These affidavits\nclearly support the informational purpose that the West Vir-\nginia legislature enunciated in the statutory text, especially in\nlight of our duty to defer to legislative judgments.\n\n   In addition to downplaying the relevance of these affida-\nvits, the district court also discredited a spreadsheet that Nich-\nolas Casey—the chairman of the West Virginia State\nDemocratic Party—compiled and submitted. The spreadsheet\ndetails third-party spending during select 2006 and 2008 West\nVirginia elections. Because the spreadsheet specifies that only\n\"a minuscule 0.4% of third-party spending\" financed\n\"print/newspaper\" communications, the district court deter-\nmined that (1) including periodicals in the \"electioneering\ncommunication\" definition did not bear a substantial relation\nto the state’s interests and (2) the law is \"severely underinclu-\nsive\" because it neglects to include other, more prevalent\nforms of print media, such as direct mail. CFIF III, 849 F.\nSupp. 2d at 695. However, independent groups’ current\neschewal of periodical advertising says nothing regarding the\nlegislature’s fear that these organizations will shift from\nbroadcast to print media to avoid the reporting and disclaimer\nrequirements, thereby preventing the electorate from receiv-\ning valuable information about the source of campaign-related\nspending. Consequently, regardless of how little electioneer-\ning communication appears in periodicals, regulating this\nform of communication furthers the state’s interest in inform-\ning the electorate.\n\n   The district court’s uneasiness about the \"electioneering\ncommunication\" definition’s underinclusivity more closely\napproximates our concern with that provision. We recognize\nthe Supreme Court’s admonition that \"a statute is not invalid\nunder the Constitution because it might have gone farther than\n\f24         CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT\nit did, . . . a legislature need not strike at all evils at the same\ntime, and . . . reform may take one step at a time.\" Buckley,\n424 U.S. at 105 (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). However, a state legislature must provide some\nrationale for electing to proceed one step at a time. See Tur-\nner, 520 U.S. at 196. Although the affidavits that West Vir-\nginia submitted sufficiently support its decision to regulate\nperiodicals and other non-broadcast media, they do not justify\nthe legislature’s decision to regulate periodicals to the exclu-\nsion of other non-broadcast media, such as direct mailings.\n\n   We recognize that the West Virginia legislature likely elim-\ninated direct mailings, telephone banks, and billboard adver-\ntising from its \"electioneering communication\" definition to\ncomply with the district court’s October 2008 decision—a\ndecision we now see as erroneous because it found that West\nVirginia could not regulate non-broadcast media as a general\nmatter. See CFIF II, 613 F. Supp. 2d at 800-01. However, we\nmust \"err on the side of protecting political speech rather than\nsuppressing it,\" WRTL II, 551 U.S. at 457, and limiting the\ncampaign finance regime’s applicability to only broadcast\nmedia causes it to burden fewer election-related communica-\ntions. We consequently affirm the district court’s decision to\nstrike \"newspaper, magazine or other periodical\" from West\nVirginia’s \"electioneering communication\" definition.\n\n                                V.\n\n   Next, we consider CFIF’s argument that the district court\nerred in its decisions regarding three exemptions to West Vir-\nginia’s \"electioneering communication\" definition. For the\nreasons we outline below, we find that the district court cor-\nrectly upheld the definition’s \"grassroots lobbying\" exemption\nand properly determined that CFIF lacked standing to chal-\nlenge the \"bona fide news account\" exemption. However, we\nconclude that the district court erred in finding that the\n§ 501(c)(3) exemption could survive constitutional scrutiny.\n\f           CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT            25\n                               A.\n\n   CFIF raises two challenges to West Virginia’s \"grassroots\nlobbying\" exemption, which specifies that \"electioneering\ncommunication\" does not include \"communication[s] made\nwhile the Legislature is in session which, incidental to pro-\nmoting or opposing a specific piece of legislation pending\nbefore the legislature, urges the audience to communicate\nwith a member or members of the Legislature concerning that\npiece of legislation.\" W. Va. Code § 3-8-1a(11)(B)(v). CFIF\nargues (1) that the phrase \"promoting or opposing\" and the\nword \"incidental\" are vague and (2) that the provision dis-\ncriminates based on content and viewpoint. However, as dis-\ncussed below, CFIF’s contentions lack merit.\n\n                     Vagueness Challenge\n\n   As noted above, statutes are unconstitutionally vague when\nthey fail to \"give the person of ordinary intelligence a reason-\nable opportunity to know what is prohibited.\" Grayned, 408\nU.S. at 108. CFIF relies upon this Court’s decision in North\nCarolina Right to Life, Inc. v. Bartlett to support its vagueness\nargument. 168 F.3d 705 (4th Cir. 1999). The relevant portion\nof the statute at issue in Bartlett defined a political committee\nas a group whose \"primary or incidental purpose . . . is to sup-\nport or oppose any candidate or to influence or attempt to\ninfluence the result of an election.\" Id. at 712. The plaintiff in\nthat case similarly argued that the provision was unconstitu-\ntionally vague, and this Court agreed. Id. at 713. However,\ndifferences between the circumstances at issue in Bartlett and\nthe situation at hand counsel against adopting Bartlett’s rea-\nsoning in this case.\n\n   As the district court correctly pointed out, the North Caro-\nlina statute at issue in Bartlett and the statute under consider-\nation in this case use the word \"incidental\" in different\nmanners. In Bartlett, this Court implied that \"incidental\"\ncould mean \"accidental\" or \"unplanned\" in the context of the\n\f26         CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT\nNorth Carolina statute when it explained that the word \"ex-\npressly sweeps within [the statute’s] ambit those groups that\nonly incidentally engage in express advocacy.\" 168 F.3d at\n712; see also The American Heritage College Dictionary 700\n(4th ed. 2002) (defining \"incidental\" as \"[o]ccurring or likely\nto occur as an unpredictable or minor accompaniment\"). This\nreading of the statute essentially requires organizations seek-\ning to comply with its requirements to discern when their\ncommunications unintentionally promote or oppose a candi-\ndate or accidentally influence an election, which, understand-\nably, a person of ordinary intelligence would find difficult. By\ncontrast, the district court properly recognized that the West\nVirginia statute’s language—\"incidental to promoting or\nopposing a specific piece of legislation\"—clearly invokes the\nphrase \"incident to\" despite its inapt use of the word \"inciden-\ntal.\" CFIF III, 849 F. Supp. 2d at 701. Black’s Law Dictio-\nnary defines \"incident\" as \"[d]ependent upon, subordinate to,\narising out of, or otherwise connected with.\" Black’s Law\nDictionary 830 (9th ed. 2009). In light of the wording of West\nVirginia’s statute, it is clear that the legislature intended this\nmeaning rather than the definition that this Court held to be\nvague in Bartlett. Consequently, the exemption’s incorpora-\ntion of the word \"incidental\" does not prevent a person of\nordinary intelligence from understanding its import.\n\n   Next, CFIF alleges that the phrase \"promoting or opposing\"\nis impermissibly vague because it \"turn[s] on the speaker’s\nperceived intent\" and requires speculation regarding the \"po-\ntential effect of the speech on listeners.\" To support its argu-\nment, CFIF relies on Buckley v. Valeo, which held that the\nD.C. Circuit failed to cure an election statute’s vagueness\nwhen that circuit construed the statute to apply only to speech\n\"advocating the election or defeat of\" a candidate. 424 U.S.\nat 42-43. In Buckley, the Supreme Court determined that the\nD.C. Circuit’s clarification remained vague because it consti-\ntuted an impermissible \"intent-and-effect\" test that put speak-\ners \"at the mercy of the varied understanding of [their] hearers\n\f            CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT                 27\nand consequently of whatever inference may be drawn as to\n[their] intent and meaning.\" Id.\n\n   The district court countered CFIF’s argument by citing\nfootnote 64 of McConnell v. FEC, which explicitly held that\nthe words \"promote\" and \"oppose\" were not unconstitution-\nally vague. 540 U.S. at 170 n.64. In McConnell, the Supreme\nCourt held that campaign finance statutes featuring the words\n\"promote\" and \"oppose\" \"give the person of ordinary intelli-\ngence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited.\"\nId. Although the Court recognized that \"[t]his is particularly\nthe case here, since actions taken by political parties are pre-\nsumed to be in connection with election campaigns,\" it did not\nlimit its holding to situations involving political parties. Id.\n\n   Despite CFIF’s arguments that this Court’s decision in\nLeake \"flatly rejected the notion that footnote 64 in McCon-\nnell applies to speech beyond that by political parties,\" Leake\nmerely held that a statutory scheme incorporating the phrase\n\"support or oppose\" was unconstitutionally vague due to addi-\ntional language that does not appear in West Virginia’s stat-\nute. 525 F.3d at 280-81, 285-86 (concluding that the statute\nwas vague because it \"determine[d] whether speech [was]\nregulable based on how a ‘reasonable person’ interpret[ed] the\nspeech’s ‘essential nature’ in light of four ‘contextual fac-\ntors’\"). Additionally, WRTL II does not require us to strike\ndown the exemption because—contrary to CFIF’s asser-\ntions—that case has no effect on McConnell’s conclusion\nregarding \"promote and oppose\"; WRTL II simply reiterated\nthat intent-and-effect tests were impermissible while passing\nno judgment regarding McConnell’s vagueness holding. 551\nU.S. at 465. Consequently, pursuant to McConnell, the words\n\"promote\" and \"oppose\" do not render the grassroots lobbying\nexemption vague, allowing the exemption to survive CFIF’s\nvagueness challenge.5\n  5\n   CFIF also argues that the phrase \"urges the audience\" is vague in its\nreply brief. However, in its renewed motion for summary judgment, CFIF\n\f28          CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT\n       Content and Viewpoint Discrimination Challenge\n\n   In addition to arguing that the grassroots lobbying exemp-\ntion is impermissibly vague, CFIF contends that the provision\nunconstitutionally discriminates based on communications’\ncontent and viewpoint. In particular, CFIF points out that the\nprovision (1) exempts speech that occurs while the legislature\nis in session but burdens speech that takes place at other\ntimes, (2) exempts communications that concern specific,\npending legislation but burdens speech regarding other legis-\nlation, (3) exempts speech urging contact with legislators but\nburdens communications that encourage reaching out to non-\nincumbents or executive branch officials, and (4) exempts\ncommunications that support or oppose legislation but bur-\ndens speech that requests other action, such as recommending\nthat a nominee be confirmed. Although the Supreme Court\ntypically applies strict scrutiny to content-based speech\nrestrictions, see Brown v. Entm’t Merchants Ass’n, 131 S. Ct.\n2729, 2738 (2011), disclosure and disclaimer requirements\nare subject to exacting scrutiny. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at\n914. Therefore, the grassroots lobbying exemption is constitu-\ntionally permissible if, in its absence, the \"electioneering\ncommunication\" definition would not bear a \"substantial rela-\ntion\" to a \"sufficiently important\" governmental interest. Id.\nFor the reasons we outline below, the exemption survives\nexacting scrutiny.\n\n   As explained above, the only sufficiently important interest\nat stake in this case is informing the electorate about the\nsource of campaign-related spending. Thus, the \"electioneer-\ning communication\" definition must bear a substantial relation\n\nfailed to raise this vagueness challenge, and the district court did not\naddress it. We therefore decline to discuss this argument. See Lovelace v.\nLee, 472 F.3d 174, 202 n.10 (4th Cir. 2006); see also 10A Charles Alan\nWright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure § 2716 (3d ed. 1998)\n(explaining that a party appealing a denial of its motion for summary judg-\nment cannot \"advance new theories or raise new issues in order to secure\na reversal of the lower court’s determination\").\n\f          CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT           29\nto that interest to withstand exacting scrutiny; in other words,\nwe will uphold the grassroots lobbying exemption if the com-\nmunications that it encompasses do not bear a substantial rela-\ntion to providing the public with information. The district\ncourt reasoned that communications that relate to pending leg-\nislation and take place while the legislature is in session are\nmore likely to be true issue advocacy—the regulation of\nwhich the Supreme Court has been loath to endorse—rather\nthan express advocacy masquerading as issue advocacy.\nWRTL II, 551 U.S. at 455-57; CFIF III, 849 F. Supp. 2d at\n703. The court therefore held that the exemption was neces-\nsary because the statutory scheme \"imposes reporting require-\nments on communications more likely to be ‘sham issue ads’\nand because the exemption spares from reporting require-\nments those communications least likely to be ‘sham issue\nads.’\" Id.\n\n   Although West Virginia offers weak evidentiary support\nfor its argument that the legislature crafted this exemption to\navoid burdening pure issue advocacy, considering the type of\nspeech the legislature chose to exempt makes the legislature’s\naim abundantly clear. Furthermore, the statute itself recog-\nnizes the importance of distinguishing issue advocacy from\nexpress advocacy by explaining that \"[d]isclosure by persons\nand entities that make expenditures for communications that\nexpressly advocate the election or defeat of clearly identified\ncandidates\" is a \"reasonable and minimally restrictive method\nof furthering First Amendment values by public exposure.\"\nW. Va. Code § 3-8-1(a)(6). In all likelihood, if West Virginia\nhad not included this exemption, CFIF would have challenged\nthe regulatory scheme as overbroad due to its applicability to\nissue advocacy. Therefore, the district court correctly found\nthat the grassroots lobbying exemption allows the \"election-\neering communication\" definition to survive exacting scru-\ntiny, and the exemption does not impermissibly discriminate\non the basis of communications’ content and viewpoint.\n\f30        CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT\n                              B.\n\n   Next, CFIF alleges that the statute’s exemption for news\naccounts is unconstitutionally vague due to its inclusion of the\nphrase \"bona fide news account.\" Under the exemption, \"bona\nfide news account[s]\" that a speaker \"disseminate[s] through\na medium owned or controlled by a political party, political\ncommittee or candidate\" are not electioneering communica-\ntions. W. Va. § 3-8-1a(11)(B)(i). The district court held that\nCFIF lacked standing to challenge this provision because\nCFIF (1) does not publish or intend to publish news stories\nand (2) does not function as a political party, political com-\nmittee, or candidate. CFIF III, 849 F. Supp. 2d at 706-07.\nAlthough CFIF correctly points out that it need not be a politi-\ncal party, political committee, or candidate to disseminate a\nnews story through a medium that such an entity owns or con-\ntrols, it has never averred that it has published a news story\nthrough one of these media outlets or that it plans to do so.\nFurthermore, contrary to CFIF’s assertions, the fact that CFIF\nis \"an entity subject to West Virginia’s campaign finance\nlaws\" does not give it carte blanche to challenge laws that are\ninapplicable to its activities. Members of City Council v. Tax-\npayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 797 (1984) (explaining that\nthe doctrine allowing facial challenges to overbroad statutes\n\"did not create any exception from the general rule that con-\nstitutional adjudication requires a review of the application of\na statute to the conduct of the party before the Court\"). There-\nfore, the district court properly held that CFIF lacks standing\nto challenge the \"bona fide news account\" exemption.\n\n                              C.\n\n   Finally, CFIF contends that the statute’s exemption for\n\"communication[s] paid for by any organization operating\nunder § 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code\" unconstitu-\ntionally discriminates against § 501(c)(4) organizations such\nas CFIF. W. Va. Code § 3-8-1a(11)(B)(iv). Once again, we\napply exacting scrutiny to determine if the exemption is con-\n\f           CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT            31\nstitutionally permissible, Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 914,\nand, as explained above, the only sufficiently important gov-\nernmental interest at stake in this case is providing the elector-\nate with information about the source of campaign-related\nspending. Consequently, because we are evaluating an\nexemption to the campaign finance regime, West Virginia\nmust demonstrate that regulating communications that fall\nwithin the exemption does not bear a substantial relation to\nthis governmental interest. For the reasons we outline below,\nWest Virginia has failed to make this showing.\n\n   The Internal Revenue Code prohibits § 501(c)(3) organiza-\ntions from \"participat[ing] in, or interven[ing] in (including\nthe publishing or distributing of statements), any political\ncampaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for\npublic office.\" 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3). As noted above, West\nVirginia exempts these organizations from complying with\nreporting and disclaimer requirements that other organizations\nengaging in electioneering communication must satisfy. West\nVirginia’s § 501(c)(3) exemption is identical to a since-\nrepealed regulatory provision that the FEC promulgated to\nenforce the BCRA. 11 C.F.R. § 100.29(c)(6) (repealed Jan.\n19, 2006). In light the fact that the Internal Revenue Code\nprohibits § 501(c)(3) organizations from engaging in express\nadvocacy, the FEC noted that commentators had concluded\nthat the \"‘BCRA’s application to 501(c)(3)s [would] prohib-\nit[ ] activity that is already forbidden,’ and the activities the\nInternal Revenue Service permits 501(c)(3) organizations to\nengage in are activities ‘that BCRA was not intended to\nreach.’\" 67 Fed. Reg. 65,190-01, 65,199 (Oct. 23, 2002)\n(alteration in original). The district court relied on this logic\nwhen upholding the West Virginia exemption. See CFIF III,\n849 F. Supp. 2d at 707-08.\n\n   However, the district court erred in finding that the\n§ 501(c)(3) exemption could withstand exacting scrutiny for\nat least two reasons. First, exemptions such as the one at issue\nin this case assume that campaign finance laws and\n\f32         CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT\n§ 501(c)(3) are coextensive in terms of the electioneering\ncommunication that they prohibit, which may not be the case.\nSee Shays v. FEC, 337 F. Supp. 2d 28, 126-28 (D.D.C. 2004).\nTherefore, by exempting communications by § 501(c)(3)\norganizations from the definition of \"electioneering communi-\ncation,\" West Virginia likely deprived the electorate of infor-\nmation about these organizations’ election-related activities.\nSecond, the district court recognized that \"the West Virginia\nLegislature has not set forth comprehensive findings for\nenacting such an exemption\" and implied that the legislature\nmust have relied on the logic behind the defunct FEC regula-\ntion. See CFIF III, 849 F. Supp. 2d at 708. The FEC rescinded\nthis regulation in 2006 after a district court held that the\nexception lacked \"reasoned analysis\" to support it. See Shays,\n337 F. Supp. 2d at 127-28. As discussed in detail above, legis-\nlatures must base their conclusions on substantial evidence.\nSee Turner, 520 U.S. at 196. In light of the federal regula-\ntion’s history and the lack of other support for the exemption,\nwe are unable to find that the \"electioneering communication\"\ndefinition bears a substantial relation to the government’s\ninterest in informing the electorate with the § 501(c)(3)\nexemption in place.\n\n   CFIF contends that, if any of the exemptions is constitu-\ntionally impermissible, we must invalidate the entire regula-\ntory scheme affecting electioneering communications because\nstriking the exemption would burden more speech than the\nlegislature intended to restrict. Although CFIF correctly sug-\ngests that \"when a section of a statute is declared void, the\nstatute cannot be given effect as though the legislature had not\nenacted the conditions limiting its operation,\" Quinn v.\nComm’r, 524 F.2d 617, 626 (7th Cir. 1975), this drastic rem-\nedy is unnecessary in this case. In McCorkle v. United States,\nthis Court explained that, \"[u]nless it is evident that the legis-\nlature would not have enacted those provisions which are\nwithin its power, independently of that which is not, the\ninvalid part may be dropped if what is left is fully operative\nas a law.\" 559 F.2d 1258, 1261 (4th Cir. 1977). It is hard to\n\f           CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT          33\nbelieve that West Virginia would have foregone regulating\nelectioneering communications if it had to subject § 501(c)(3)\norganizations to the statutory requirements. We therefore\ninvalidate the § 501(c)(3) exemption while leaving the rest of\nthe \"electioneering communication\" definition intact.\n\n                              VI.\n\n   In addition to challenging the definitional portions of West\nVirginia’s campaign finance laws, CFIF also challenges one\nof the statutory scheme’s substantive requirements. In rele-\nvant part, the West Virginia Code requires individuals who\nengage in electioneering communication to comply with the\nfollowing reporting requirements:\n\n1. Every person who spends a total of $5,000 or more during\n   any calendar year on electioneering communication must\n   file reports with West Virginia’s secretary of state within\n   twenty-four hours of the \"disclosure date,\" which is the\n   date when the individual spends $5,000 on electioneering\n   communication in a calendar year. Individuals must file\n   these reports each time they spend $5,000. W. Va. Code\n   §§ 3-8-1a(9), 3-8-2b(a)(1).\n\n2.   Every person who spends a total of $1,000 or more dur-\n     ing the two weeks immediately preceding an election\n     must file a report with West Virginia’s secretary of state.\n     Individuals must file these reports within twenty-four\n     hours of the \"disclosure date,\" which West Virginia\n     defines in the same manner for both electioneering com-\n     munication reporting requirements. Id. §§ 3-8-1a(9), 3-8-\n     2b(a)(2).\n\nWest Virginia also requires electioneering communications to\nfeature certain disclaimers. The disclaimers must (1) clearly\nindicate that a candidate or candidate’s committee did not\nauthorize the communication and (2) clearly identify the per-\nson making the expenditure. Id. § 3-8-2b(e). CFIF’s challenge\n\f34        CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT\nfocuses on the reporting requirements for electioneering com-\nmunications rather than the disclaimer requirements.\n\n   CFIF specifically contends that West Virginia Code section\n3-8-2b(b)(5) is ambiguous. That provision mandates disclo-\nsure of the \"names and addresses of any contributors who\ncontributed a total of more than one thousand dollars between\nthe first day of the preceding calendar year and the disclosure\ndate whose contributions were used to pay for electioneering\ncommunications\" but provides no clear guide for determining\nwhen an organization \"used\" a contribution \"to pay for elec-\ntioneering communications.\" See W. Va. Code § 3-8-2b(b)(5).\nIn light of this alleged ambiguity, CFIF argues that the provi-\nsion requires cautious organizations to disclose the names and\naddresses of all contributors who donate more than $1,000\nwithin the applicable timeframe, even when they contributed\nto the organization’s general treasury. CFIF then maintains\nthat requiring organizations to file reports regarding their gen-\neral treasury contributions does not serve West Virginia’s\ninterest in informing the electorate, precluding the reporting\nrequirement from surviving exacting scrutiny. West Virginia,\nin turn, asserts that section 3-8-2b(b)(5) is not ambiguous and\nthat the provision can survive exacting scrutiny even if we\naccept CFIF’s broad interpretation.\n\n   Like all campaign finance-related disclosure requirements,\nWest Virginia Code section 3-8-2b(b)(5) is subject to exacting\nscrutiny. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 914. As previously\nnoted, this standard requires regulatory provisions to bear a\n\"substantial relation\" to a \"sufficiently important\" governmen-\ntal interest. Id. (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 64, 66). For the\nreasons we outline above, the only governmental interest at\nstake in this case is West Virginia’s interest in providing the\nelectorate with information about the source of campaign-\nrelated spending. Consequently, West Virginia Code section\n3-8-2b(b)(5) must bear a substantial relation to this interest to\npass constitutional muster.\n\f          CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT          35\n   The district court agreed with CFIF’s contention that West\nVirginia code section 3-8-2b(b)(5)’s ambiguity prevented it\nfrom surviving exacting scrutiny. The court determined that\ncompelling expansive disclosure of treasury contributions\nwould result in a \"flood of information\" about donors who\nmay not have directly financed electioneering communica-\ntions. The court reasoned that, rather than furthering West\nVirginia’s interest in informing the electorate, providing\ninformation about corporate treasury donations could hinder\nWest Virginia’s goal by inundating the public with marginally\nrelevant information. The district court also feared that a\nbroad disclosure requirement would be so administratively\nonerous for organizations such as CFIF that it would discour-\nage them from speaking at all. To avoid overwhelming the\npublic with information and unduly burdening groups who\nengage in electioneering communication, the district court\nrestricted the reporting requirement to contributions from \"in-\ndividuals who respond to a solicitation for electioneering\ncommunications or earmark their contributions for such use,\"\na solution that it drew from an FEC regulation. CFIF III, 849\nF. Supp. 2d at 717-19 (citing 72 Fed. Reg. 72,899, 72,910\n(Dec. 26, 2007)). As discussed below, we find that the court\nerred in determining that West Virginia code section 3-8-\n2b(b)(5) could not survive exacting scrutiny and in circum-\nscribing its scope via the \"earmarked funds\" limiting con-\nstruction.\n\n   To combat CFIF’s argument that West Virginia code sec-\ntion 3-8-2b(b)(5) is unconstitutional, West Virginia points to\nMcConnell, in which the Supreme Court upheld a similar stat-\nute that imposed reporting requirements on \"[e]very person\nwho makes a disbursement for the direct costs of producing\nand airing electioneering communications.\" 2 U.S.C.\n§ 434(f)(1); McConnell, 540 U.S. at 196. Specifically, the\nMcConnell Court found that the state interests that Buckley\nenumerated—including providing the public with informa-\ntion—\"amply support[ed]\" imposing reporting requirements\non organizations that engaged in electioneering communica-\n\f36        CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT\ntion. McConnell, 540 U.S. at 196. As the below analysis illus-\ntrates, we find that McConnell controls this case and\nnecessitates reversing the district court’s conclusion that West\nVirginia’s electioneering communication reporting require-\nments cannot survive exacting scrutiny.\n\n   At the time the Supreme Court decided McConnell, the\nBCRA barred corporations from using general treasury funds\nto finance electioneering communications and required them\nto establish a \"separate segregated fund\" for such expendi-\ntures. 2 U.S.C. § 441b(b)(2), invalidated by Citizens United,\n130 S. Ct. 876; McConnell, 540 U.S. at 195 & n.79. Conse-\nquently, when the Supreme Court decided McConnell,\n§ 434(f)(1) could not suffer from the same purported ambigu-\nity that allegedly prevents West Virginia Code section 3-8-\n2b(b)(5) from surviving exacting scrutiny, even though aver-\nage individuals could just as easily interpret § 434(f)(1) to\nencompass general treasury donations absent the \"separate\nsegregated fund\" requirement. However, in Citizens United,\nthe Supreme Court ruled that federal law’s ban on using cor-\nporate treasury funds to engage in express advocacy was\nunconstitutional while simultaneously approving of McCon-\nnell’s conclusion that 2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(1) was facially valid.\nSee Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 913-14. Citizens United\ntherefore demonstrates that the Supreme Court’s conclusion\nregarding § 434(f)(1)’s constitutionality was not tied to the\nprohibition regarding corporate treasury funds. Accordingly,\neven if we assume for the sake of argument that section 3-8-\n2b(b)(5) is ambiguous, McConnell compels us to find that the\nprovision is constitutional. We therefore reverse the district\ncourt’s conclusion that section 3-8-2b(b)(5) cannot survive\nexacting scrutiny and its decision to impose an \"earmarked\nfunds\" limiting construction to cure the provision’s alleged\nunconstitutionality.\n\f            CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT                    37\n                                   VII.\n\n   Like CFIF, WVFL also raises certain challenges to the stat-\nutory scheme’s substantive requirements. Specifically, WVFL\ncontends in its reply brief that the electioneering communica-\ntion reporting and disclaimer requirements described above\nand the similar reporting and disclaimer requirements for\ngroups that make independent expenditures6 are \"patently\nunreasonable\" and \"severely burden First Amendment rights.\"\nHowever, we cannot consider this issue because WVFL did\nnot file an appeal in this case. See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(3);\nThurston v. United States, 810 F.2d 438, 447 (4th Cir. 1987).\nThe district court’s conclusion that the reporting and dis-\nclaimer requirements are constitutional therefore remains\nundisturbed. See CFIF III, 849 F. Supp. 2d at 711-15.\n  6\n   Organizations that make independent expenditures must comply with\nthe following requirements:\n1. A person who makes independent expenditures totaling more than\n   $1,000 during a calendar year must file a report with West Virginia’s\n   secretary of state. W. Va. Code § 3-8-2(b)(1).\n2. Any person who makes or contracts to make independent expenditures\n   aggregating $10,000 or more at any time before an election must file\n   a report with West Virginia’s secretary of state within forty-eight\n   hours. Id. § 3-8-2(d)(1). Thereafter, the person must file an additional\n   report for each aggregate $10,000 he or she spends within forty-eight\n   hours of the expenditure. Id. § 3-8-2(d)(2).\n3. Any person who makes or contracts to make independent expenditures\n   within the two weeks before an election aggregating either $1,000 (for\n   multi-county or statewide elections) or $500 (for single-county or\n   municipal elections) must file a report describing the expenditure with\n   West Virginia’s secretary of state within twenty-four hours. Id. § 3-8-\n   2(c)(1). The person must file an additional report for each aggregate\n   $1,000 or $500 he or she spends within twenty-four hours of the expen-\n   diture. Id. § 3-8-2(c)(2).\nFinally, West Virginia imposes the same disclaimer requirements on both\nindependent expenditures and electioneering communications. As noted\nabove, these disclaimers must (1) clearly indicate that a candidate or can-\ndidate’s committee did not authorize the communication and (2) clearly\nidentify the person making the expenditure. Id. §§ 3-8-2(e), 3-8-2b(e).\n\f38         CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT\n                              VIII.\n\n   Finally, West Virginia contends that the district court\nshould have vacated as moot its earlier injunctions because\nWest Virginia had repealed the statutory provisions that were\nsubject to the injunctions. Instead of vacating the injunctions,\nthe court reiterated the decision it made when it dissolved the\nApril 2008 injunction: \"‘dissolution of this court’s prelimi-\nnary injunction order . . . does not mean that either the new\nor old versions of West Virginia’s Election Code may be\napplied to violations that are alleged to have occurred prior to’\nthe date of dissolution.\" CFIF III, 849 F. Supp. 2d at 719-20\n(alteration in original) (quoting Ctr. for Individual Freedom,\nInc. v. Ireland, No. 1:08-00190, 2008 WL 4452659, at *2 n.2\n(S.D. W. Va. Sept. 29, 2008)). Hence, under the district\ncourt’s ruling, West Virginia cannot punish offenders for vio-\nlating the provisions that were subject to the injunctions while\nthe injunctions were in effect.\n\n   Under West Virginia law, the state can enforce a repealed\nlaw after the repeal becomes effective as long as the offense\noccurred while the statute was in effect. W. Va. Code § 2-2-\n8. Therefore, if we vacate the injunctions as moot, West Vir-\nginia will have the power to punish organizations for earlier\nviolations of the statute. In Jacobus v. Alaska, on which CFIF\nrelies, the Ninth Circuit explained that, \"[d]espite superseding\nevents, an issue is not moot if there are present effects that are\nlegally significant.\" 338 F.3d 1095, 1104 (9th Cir. 2003). The\nNinth Circuit found that the plaintiffs’ claims were not moot\nbecause the state was \"likely\" to prosecute, citing a letter from\nthe relevant regulatory body reserving the right to prosecute\npast violations. Jacobus, 338 F.3d at 1104.\n\n   In this case, West Virginia’s secretary of state attested that\nher \"office will not seek to enforce those provisions of said\nArticles that have been repealed.\" CFIF relies primarily on a\nstatement that another official made during a radio broadcast\nin 2008 and an election law complaint that West Virginia’s\n\f           CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT            39\nattorney general filed over three years ago to support its argu-\nment. We admit that this evidence does not overwhelmingly\ndemonstrate that the repealed provisions remain \"legally sig-\nnificant,\" especially in light of the secretary of state’s affida-\nvit. However, as discussed above, we review the district\ncourt’s decision regarding the preliminary injunction for\nabuse of discretion. See Conservation Council of N.C., 528\nF.2d at 251-52. Despite the weakness of the evidence in favor\nof CFIF’s argument, we decline to go so far as to find that the\ndistrict court abused its discretion when it decided to dissolve\nthe injunctions rather than vacating them as moot. We there-\nfore affirm the district court’s decision to prohibit West Vir-\nginia from prosecuting individuals who violated the enjoined\ncampaign finance provisions while the injunctions were in\neffect.\n\n                               IX.\n\n  For the foregoing reasons, we affirm in part, reverse in part,\nand remand for further proceedings consistent with this opin-\nion.\n\n                                         AFFIRMED IN PART,\n                                         REVERSED IN PART,\n                                            AND REMANDED\n\f",

In this case,\n\f6           CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT\nwe confront the delicate balance between protecting political\nspeech and informing the electorate about the organizations\nthat bankroll modern elections. Specifically, we consider\nwhether West Virginia’s campaign-finance reporting and dis-\nclaimer requirements can survive constitutional scrutiny.\n\n   Appellee and Cross-Appellant Center for Individual Free-\ndom (CFIF) and Appellee West Virginians for Life (WVFL)\nare § 501(c)(4) organizations that engage in election-related\nspeech. These organizations and Zane Lawhorn1—a West Vir-\nginia resident who wishes to receive WVFL’s communica-\ntions—brought suit against West Virginia’s secretary of state,\nmembers of the West Virginia State Election Commission,\nand a class of West Virginia’s prosecuting attorneys, alleging\nthat West Virginia’s campaign finance statutes were constitu-\ntionally impermissible. The district court struck down some of\nthe provisions and upheld other portions of the statutory\nscheme, and both West Virginia2 and CFIF appealed. We now\naffirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceed-\nings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                    I.\n\n                                    A.\n\n   Following the 2004 election, the West Virginia legislature\nacted to strengthen the state’s election statutes due to an \"ex-\nplosion of expenditures by groups independent of candidates.\"\nThese new laws required organizations to file reports with the\nWest Virginia secretary of state and include disclaimers on\ntheir communications when they made certain election-related\nexpenditures and engaged in campaign-related speech. CFIF\nand WVFL filed separate challenges to the new laws, alleging\n    1\n     For purposes of this opinion, we refer to WVFL and Lawhorn collec-\ntively as \"WVFL.\"\n   2\n     We refer to this case’s Defendants, Appellants, and Cross-Appellees as\n\"West Virginia\" for ease of reference.\n\f            CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT                     7\nthat they feared prosecution under the statutes because they\ndisseminated communications that fell within the laws’ scope\nbut were unwilling to disclose the sources of their contribu-\ntions.\n\n   CFIF’s mission \"is to protect and defend individual free-\ndoms and individual rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitu-\ntion.\" CFIF plans to use broadcast media, print media, and\ntelephone banks \"to speak to the public in the Southern Dis-\ntrict of West Virginia on matters of litigation reform and\nrelated justice issues, including criminal law enforcement and\nsentencing, legal reform, and judicial decision-making.\" To\nthis end, CFIF will \"refer to West Virginia candidates to illus-\ntrate its points and ask members of the public to contact the\ncandidates and petition them to take or maintain certain posi-\ntions.\" WVFL, in turn, aims \"to present information upon\nwhich individuals and the general public may make informed\ndecisions about such topics as fetal development, abortion and\nits alternatives, and euthanasia.\" To further this purpose,\n\"WVFL has distributed candidate-comparison fliers, placed\ncandidate comparisons in ads for newspaper and television as\nwell as on the Internet, and issued petitions and mailings.\" In\nsum, both CFIF and WVFL engage in election-related speech\nto promote their organizational goals.\n\n                                    B.\n\n   CFIF filed its initial complaint against Betty Ireland3\n—West Virginia’s secretary of state—and a class of West\nVirginia’s prosecuting attorneys on March 21, 2008, challeng-\ning West Virginia’s reporting and disclaimer requirements for\n(1) expenses associated with \"advocating or opposing the\nnomination, election or defeat of any candidate;\" (2) expendi-\ntures \"in support of or opposition to the nomination or elec-\n  3\n    In 2009, Appellant and Cross-Appellee Natalie Tennant replaced for-\nmer Defendant Betty Ireland as West Virginia’s secretary of state.

TENNANT\ntion\" of a candidate; and (3) \"electioneering communication.\"\nBy order, the district court permitted the West Virginia Edu-\ncation Association (WVEA), the West Virginia American\nFederation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations\n(AFL-CIO), Robert M. Bastress, Jr., Margaret L. Workman,\nand Menis E. Ketchum to intervene as defendants. The West\nVirginia AFL-CIO and WVEA intervened due to their \"con-\ncrete interests, distinct from those of other parties, in uphold-\ning the West Virginia campaign finance provisions at issue.\"\nBastress, Workman, and Ketchum were each seeking nomina-\ntion for election to a seat on the West Virginia Supreme Court\nof Appeals and alleged that CFIF had targeted them through\nits communications.\n\n   On April 22, 2008, the district court entered an injunction\npreventing West Virginia from applying the campaign finance\nstatutes to \"anything other than communications that\nexpressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identi-\nfied candidate\" and restricting the definition of \"electioneer-\ning communication\" to certain broadcast media. Ctr. for\nIndividual Freedom, Inc. v. Ireland (CFIF I), No. 1:08-00190,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1837324</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7 (S.D. W. Va. Apr. 22, 2008).\nShortly thereafter, the West Virginia legislature amended the\ncode sections that were the subject of the injunction, and West\nVirginia moved to dissolve the injunction, arguing that the\namendments rendered it moot. The district court granted West\nVirginia’s motion and directed CFIF to seek a new injunction\nbased on the amended language.\n\n   On September 30, 2008, WVFL filed its verified complaint\nand motion for a preliminary injunction raising challenges to\nthe amended statutory provisions. Specifically, WVFL chal-\nlenged the statutory scheme’s reporting requirements and its\ndefinitions of \"electioneering communication\" and \"expressly\nadvocating.\" Less than a week later, CFIF filed a motion for\na preliminary injunction and challenged many of the same\nprovisions, and the district court consolidated the two cases:\nCenter for Individual Freedom, Inc. v. Ireland, No. 1:08-cv-\n\f          CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT            9\n00190, and West Virginians for Life, Inc. v. Ireland, No. 1:08-\ncv-0113. The district court issued its memorandum opinion\nand order regarding the preliminary injunction motions on\nOctober 17, 2008, and released its amended opinion and order\non February 12, 2009. Notably, the district court held that (1)\nWest Virginia’s definition of \"expressly advocating\" was\nvague and (2) its definition of \"electioneering communica-\ntion\" was overbroad because it applied to more media than the\ndefinition that appears in the federal Bipartisan Campaign\nReform Act (BCRA), which—unlike West Virginia’s then-\nexisting definition—includes only broadcast media. The court\ntherefore granted CFIF’s and WVFL’s requests for prelimi-\nnary injunctions with respect to those provisions. See Ctr. for\nIndividual Freedom, Inc. v. Ireland (CFIF II), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2156747\"><a href=\"/opinion/2156747/cfif-v-ireland/\"><span class=\"volume\">613</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Va. 2009).\n\n  After the district court ruled on their preliminary injunction\nmotions, both CFIF and WVFL moved for summary judg-\nment. However, due to pending petitions for rehearing en\nbanc and a writ of certiorari in The Real Truth About Obama,\nInc. v. FEC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1029672\"><a href=\"/opinion/1029672/real-truth-about-obama-v-federal-election-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">575</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">342</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 2009), the district court\ngranted WVFL’s motion to stay the case on September 16,\n2009. The Supreme Court ultimately granted the certiorari\npetition, vacated this Court’s decision in Real Truth, and\nremanded the case in light of Citizens United, see The Real\nTruth About Obama, Inc. v. FEC, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2371</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2010),\ncausing the district court to dissolve the stay on May 26,\n2010.\n\n                              C.\n\n   In 2010, West Virginia’s legislature amended the provi-\nsions at issue in this case for a second time. The amendments\nwent into effect on June 11, 2010, and concerned West Vir-\nginia Code section 3-8-1, which states the purposes of the\nlaw; section 3-8-1a, which includes the definitions of \"elec-\ntioneering communication\" and \"expressly advocating\"; and\nsection 3-8-2, which lays out the requirements for reporting\n\f10          CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT\nelection-related spending that is not coordinated with a candi-\ndate or political party, also known as independent expendi-\ntures. Presumably to more closely comport with the October\n2008 preliminary injunction order,4 the West Virginia legisla-\nture removed direct mailings, telephone banks, and billboard\nadvertising from the \"electioneering communication\" defini-\ntion. See W. Va. Code § 3-8-1a(11)(A). In relevant part, the\nlatest version of the statute requires individuals and organiza-\ntions to (1) file reports with West Virginia’s secretary of state\nif they make independent expenditures of a certain amount,\nid. § 3-8-2(b)(1), (c)(1)-(2), (d)(1)-(2); (2) file reports with\nWest Virginia’s secretary of state if they engage in election-\neering communication, which \"means any paid communica-\ntion made by broadcast, cable or satellite signal, or published\nin any newspaper, magazine or other periodical,\" id. §§ 3-8-\n1a(11)(A), 3-9-2b(a)(1)-(2); and (3) include disclaimers on\nelectioneering communications and communications financed\nby independent expenditures identifying the individuals mak-\ning the expenditure and indicating that a candidate or candi-\ndate’s committee did not authorize the communication, id.\n§§ 3-8-2(2), 3-8-2b(e).\n\n   CFIF filed a renewed motion for summary judgment on\nSeptember 14, 2010, and WVFL filed a second motion for\nsummary judgment on the same day. Both organizations con-\ntended that the amendments failed to remedy the constitu-\ntional defects in the campaign finance regime. On August 3,\n2011, the district court granted in part and denied in part their\nmotions for summary judgment. See Ctr. for Individual Free-\ndom, Inc. v. Tennant (CFIF III), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">849</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">659</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (S.D.\nW. Va. 2011). In its opinion, the district court came to the fol-\nlowing pertinent conclusions:\n  4\n    The West Virginia legislature provides little, if any, formal legislative\nhistory. See Ctr. for Individual Freedom v. Tennant, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">849</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Va. 2004).\n\f          CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT            11\n1. The district court held that subsection (C) of the statute’s\n   definition of \"expressly advocating\"—which defines \"ex-\n   pressly advocating\" as \"any communication that . . . [i]s\n   susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an\n   appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,\" W. Va.\n   Code § 3-8-1a(12)(C)—was fatally vague. The court there-\n   fore severed subsection (C) from the remainder of the defi-\n   nition. CFIF III, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">849</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 685-87.\n\n2. The district court held that West Virginia’s inclusion of\n   periodicals in its definition of \"electioneering communica-\n   tion\" rendered the definition overbroad. Id. at 697. In\n   reaching its conclusion, the district court emphasized the\n   West Virginia legislature’s failure to develop a record or\n   make findings that supported its inclusion of print media.\n   See id. at 694-97. Consequently, the court severed West\n   Virginia Code section 3-8-1a(11)’s reference to materials\n   \"published in any newspaper, magazine or other periodi-\n   cal.\" Id. at 697.\n\n3. The court determined that various exemptions to the \"elec-\n   tioneering communication\" definition were constitutional.\n   First, the court upheld a \"grassroots lobbying\" exemption,\n   which provides that \"electioneering communication\" does\n   not include \"communication[s] made while the Legislature\n   is in session which, incidental to promoting or opposing a\n   specific piece of legislation pending before the Legislature,\n   urges the audience to communicate with a member or\n   members of the Legislature concerning that piece of legis-\n   lation.\" W. Va. Code § 3-8-1a(11)(B)(v); CFIF III, 849 F.\n   Supp. 2d at 700-03. Second, the court declined to address\n   the merits of CFIF’s challenge to an exemption for \"bona\n   fide news account[s],\" which provides:\n\n    (i) A news story, commentary or editorial dissemi-\n    nated through the facilities of any broadcast, cable or\n    satellite television or radio station, newspaper, maga-\n    zine or other periodical publication not owned or\n\f12         CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT\n     controlled by a political party, political committee or\n     candidate: Provided, That a news story disseminated\n     through a medium owned or controlled by a political\n     party, political committee or candidate is neverthe-\n     less exempt if the news is:\n\n         (I) A bona fide news account communi-\n         cated in a publication of general circulation\n         or through a licensed broadcasting facili-\n         ty[.]\n\nW. Va. Code § 3-8-1a(11)(B)(i). The court determined that\nCFIF lacked standing to challenge this exemption because\nCFIF failed to demonstrate that it intended to publish news\nstories or functioned as a \"political party, political committee\nor candidate.\" CFIF III, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">849</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 707. Third, the\ncourt upheld a provision that exempts communications by\n§ 501(c)(3) organizations because federal law prohibits these\ngroups from engaging in express advocacy. Id. at 707-09.\n\n4. The district court determined that the statutory scheme’s\n   twenty-four-hour and forty-eight-hour reporting and dis-\n   claimer requirements could survive exacting scrutiny.\n   CFIF III, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">849</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 711-15.\n\n5. However, the district court concluded that the reporting\n   requirement for electioneering communications was\n   ambiguous insofar as it mandated disclosure of the \"names\n   and addresses of any contributors who contributed a total\n   of more than one thousand dollars between the first day of\n   the preceding calendar year and the disclosure date and\n   whose contributions were used to pay for electioneering\n   communications.\" W. Va. Code § 3-8-2b(b)(5) (emphasis\n   added); CFIF III, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">849</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 717-19. To cure the\n   ambiguity of the emphasized portion, the court restricted\n   the reporting requirement to \"individuals who respond to\n   a solicitation for electioneering communications or ear-\n   mark their contributions for such use.\" Id. at 719.\n\f          CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT           13\nThe district court chose not to vacate the April 2008 and\nOctober 2008 injunctions due to the legislature’s amend-\nments, which would have allowed West Virginia to prosecute\ngroups for violating the enjoined portions of the statutory\nscheme while the injunctions were in effect. Instead, the dis-\ntrict court \"dissolve[ed]\" the injunctions, thereby prohibiting\nthese prosecutions. CFIF III, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">849</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

CFIF cross-appeals the court’s\nconclusion that it lacked standing to challenge the \"bona fide\nnews account\" exemption and its determinations that the\n\"grassroots lobbying\" and § 501(c)(3) exemptions were con-\nstitutional. Although WVFL did not file a notice of appeal in\nthis case, it contends that, if we uphold the statutory scheme’s\n\"electioneering communication\" and \"expressly advocating\"\ndefinitions, we should strike down the reporting and dis-\nclaimer requirements due to these provisions’ alleged vague-\nness and overbreadth. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. § 1291. The WVEA, the West Virginia AFL-CIO,\nBastress, Workman, and Ketchum are not parties to this\nappeal.\n\n   We affirm the district court’s decisions to (1) strike \"news-\npaper, magazine or other periodical\" from West Virginia’s\n\"electioneering communication\" definition; (2) uphold the\n\"electioneering communication\" definition’s exemption for\ngrassroots lobbying; (3) decline to consider the merits of\n\f14        CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT\nCFIF’s challenge to the bona fide news accounts exemption\nbecause the organization lacks standing; and (4) prohibit pros-\necutions for violations that occurred while the earlier injunc-\ntions were in effect. However, we reverse the district court’s\ndecision with respect to (1) its conclusion that subsection (C)\nof the \"expressly advocating\" definition is unconstitutional;\n(2) its choice to uphold the \"electioneering communication\"\ndefinition’s § 501(c)(3) exemption; and (3) its application of\nan \"earmarked funds\" limiting construction to the reporting\nrequirement for electioneering communications. Because\nWVFL did not file a notice of appeal in this case, we cannot\nconsider its challenge to the district court’s finding that the\nstatutory scheme’s twenty-four- and forty-eight-hour report-\ning requirements are constitutional. We consequently affirm\nin part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                               II.\n\n   A court considering a summary judgment motion must\nview the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.\nUnited States v.

In\nReal Truth, this Court held that the federal definition of \"ex-\npressly advocating\" is not unconstitutionally vague. Id. at 555.\nPer the federal definition—which appears in 11 C.F.R.\n§ 100.22(b)—\"expressly advocating\" is a communication that,\n\n     [w]hen taken as a whole and with limited reference\n     to external events, such as the proximity to the elec-\n     tion, could only be interpreted by a reasonable per-\n     son as containing advocacy of the election or defeat\n     of one or more clearly identified candidate(s)\n     because—\n\n     (1) The electoral portion of the communication is\n     unmistakable, unambiguous, and suggestive of only\n     one meaning; and\n\n     (2) Reasonable minds could not differ as to whether\n     it encourages actions to elect or defeat one or more\n     clearly identified candidate(s) or encourages some\n     other kind of action.\n\nReal Truth held that the differences between § 100.22(b) and\nthe WRTL II \"functional equivalent\" test—which specifies\nthat \"a court should find that an ad is the functional equivalent\nof express advocacy only if the ad is susceptible of no reason-\nable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or\nagainst a specific candidate,\" WRTL II, 551 U.S. at 470-\n71—were \"not meaningful.\" Real Truth, 681 F.3d at 552.\nBecause the WRTL II test and the portion of the West Virginia\ndefinition at issue here are identical, Real Truth’s holding\n\f          CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT           17\napplies to this case. We therefore hold that subsection (C) is\nnot unconstitutionally vague.\n\n   Although CFIF and WVFL argue that this Court’s decision\nin North Carolina Right to Life, Inc. v. Leake, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1025593\"><a href=\"/opinion/1025593/north-carolina-right-to-life-inc-v-leake/\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(4th Cir. 2008), necessitates finding that subsection (C) is\nvague, the situation at issue in Leake is distinguishable from\nthe circumstances in this case for the same reasons this Court\ndistinguished it in Real Truth. Notably, like the provision\nbefore this Court in Real Truth, the \"expressly advocating\"\ndefinition under review in this case is a component of West\nVirginia’s \"independent expenditure\" definition. W. Va. Code\n§ 3-8-1a(15); Real Truth, 681 F.3d at 553. The Leake panel\nelected to cabin the North Carolina provision at issue in that\ncase within the confines of the statute’s \"electioneering com-\nmunication\" definition due to concerns about the provision’s\nbroad applicability. Leake, 525 F.3d at 283-84. Those con-\ncerns are not at play in this case because, as previously noted,\nthe West Virginia legislature embedded the \"expressly advo-\ncating\" term within the \"independent expenditure\" definition,\nthereby limiting its applicability. Consequently, Leake does\nnot alter our conclusion that Real Truth compels us to reverse\nthe district court’s determination that subsection (C) is uncon-\nstitutionally vague.\n\n   Because the district court erred in invalidating subsection\n(C) on vagueness grounds, we must consider whether the pro-\nvision is impermissibly broad. WVFL argues in its reply brief\nthat subsection (C) is overbroad because it reaches beyond\nexpress advocacy, and CFIF adopts this contention in its brief.\nReal Truth again controls our decision because the federal\nregulatory provision at issue in that case is comparable to sub-\nsection (C) of West Virginia Code section 3-8-1a(12). In Real\nTruth, this Court emphasized the Supreme Court’s Citizens\nUnited decision, which explained that regulators need not\nlimit disclosure requirements to \"speech that is the functional\nequivalent of express advocacy.\" Real Truth, 681 F.3d at 551-\n52 (citing Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 890). Because regula-\n\f18         CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT\ntions may extend beyond speech that is the functional equiva-\nlent of express advocacy and subsection (C) invokes WRTL\nII’s \"functional equivalent\" test, subsection (C) cannot be\noverbroad. Therefore, CFIF and WVFL’s overbreadth argu-\nment fails, and we hold that subsection (C) is constitutional.\n\n                               IV.\n\n  Next, we consider the constitutionality of the West Virginia\nCode’s definition of \"electioneering communication.\" Section\n3-8-1a(11) defines the term as\n\n     any paid communication made by broadcast, cable or\n     satellite signal, or published in any newspaper, mag-\n     azine or other periodical that:\n\n     (i) Refers to a clearly identified candidate for Gover-\n     nor, Secretary of State, Attorney General, Treasurer,\n     Auditor, Commissioner of Agriculture, Supreme\n     Court of Appeals or the Legislature;\n\n     (ii) Is publicly disseminated within:\n\n         (I) Thirty days before a primary election at\n         which the nomination for office sought by\n         the candidate is to be determined; or\n\n         (II) Sixty days before a general or special\n         election at which the office sought by the\n         candidate is to be filled; and\n\n     (iii) Is targeted to the relevant electorate.\n\nCFIF challenges the definition’s inclusion of materials \"pub-\nlished in any newspaper, magazine or other periodical.\"\n\n  In Citizens United, the Supreme Court specified that courts\nshould apply \"exacting scrutiny\" to evaluate campaign\n\f          CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT            19\nfinance disclaimer and disclosure provisions, such as the\n\"electioneering communication\" definition. 130 S. Ct. at 914.\nThis standard requires the government to show that the statute\nbears a \"substantial relation\" to a \"sufficiently important\"\ngovernmental interest. Id. (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 64,\n66). CFIF alleges that the \"electioneering communication\"\ndefinition fails to survive exacting scrutiny for two reasons:\n(1) the government has no interest that justifies the statute’s\napplication to non-broadcast media, and (2) even if the gov-\nernment could demonstrate a sufficiently important interest,\nthe legislature’s failure to empirically justify the statute’s\napplication to periodicals renders it overbroad and prevents it\nfrom bearing a substantial relation to West Virginia’s stated\ninterests. As we explain below, the district court correctly\nagreed with CFIF’s second contention, so we affirm the dis-\ntrict court’s decision to sever West Virginia Code section 3-8-\n1a(11)’s reference to materials \"published in any newspaper,\nmagazine or other periodical.\"\n\n                    Governmental Interest\n\n   We first address CFIF’s argument that West Virginia has\nno sufficiently important governmental interest that justifies\nthe statutory scheme’s application to non-broadcast media. In\nBuckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court highlighted three state\ninterests that can justify disclosure requirements: (1) \"provid[-\ning] the electorate with information\" about the source of\ncampaign-related spending, (2) \"deter[ring] actual corruption\nand avoid[ing] the appearance of corruption,\" and (3) \"gather-\ning the data necessary to detect violations of . . . contribution\nlimitations.\" 424 U.S. at 66-67. The second inter-\nest—preventing corruption and the appearance of corrup-\ntion—does not apply to the case at hand because\n\"electioneering communication\" does not include activity by\ncandidates or their committees. See W. Va. Code § 3-8-\n1a(11)(B)(ii). \"Electioneering communication\" therefore\nincludes only materials that third parties finance, and the\nSupreme Court has held that third-party expenditures \"do not\n\f20         CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT\ngive rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.\" Citi-\nzens United, 130 S. Ct. at 909; see also Leake, 525 F.3d at\n292 (explaining that \"independent expenditures are made\nwithout candidate consultation, rendering it unlikely that such\nexpenditures would be made in exchange for ‘improper com-\nmitments from the candidate’\" (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at\n47)). The third interest—gathering data to enforce more sub-\nstantive electioneering restrictions—is also inapposite\nbecause states cannot limit contributions collected to fund\nindependent electioneering communications or prohibit such\ncommunications. See Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 913. Con-\nsequently, West Virginia cannot use the second or third Buck-\nley interests to justify its \"electioneering communication\"\ndefinition.\n\n   However, West Virginia can rely on the first interest: pro-\nviding the electorate with election-related information.\nRequiring organizations and individuals who engage in elec-\ntioneering communication to file certain reports \"alert[s] the\nvoter to the interests to which a candidate is most likely to be\nresponsive and thus facilitate[s] predictions of future perfor-\nmance in office.\" Buckley, 424 U.S. at 67. Furthermore, as the\nSupreme Court recognized in McConnell v. FEC, organiza-\ntions such as CFIF often have \"dubious and misleading\nnames,\" and \"disclosure provisions require these organiza-\ntions to reveal their identities so that the public is able to iden-\ntify the source of the funding behind . . . advertisements\ninfluencing certain elections.\" 540 U.S. at 196-97. Despite\nCFIF’s argument that the public’s informational interest\nextends only to broadcast media, there is no reason why the\npublic would not have a similar interest in knowing the source\nof campaign-related spending when it takes the form of print\ncommunication. Therefore, West Virginia can point to its\ninterest in informing the public to justify including print\nmedia in its \"electioneering communication\" definition.\n\n                      Substantial Relation\n\n   Next, West Virginia must be able to demonstrate that\nincluding materials \"published in any newspaper, magazine or\n\f           CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT             21\nother periodical\" in its \"electioneering communication\" defi-\nnition bears a substantial relation to the state’s interest in pro-\nviding information. The district court concluded that West\nVirginia failed to make this showing because the state legisla-\nture neglected to make findings regarding the need to regulate\nnon-targeted print communications, which rendered the \"elec-\ntioneering communication\" definition fatally overbroad.

The district court\n\f22        CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT\nbased its ruling on the \"conclusory\" and \"anecdotal\" nature of\nthe affidavits that West Virginia used to establish the need to\nregulate periodicals, stating that \"[a]lthough several of the\naffidavits illustrate the potential of non-broadcast media as an\neffective electioneering tool, none of them presents anything\nmore than anecdotal claims.\" CFIF III, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">849</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at\n694. However, in Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC,\nthe Supreme Court credited an affidavit that noted that \"large\ncontributions have ‘the real potential to buy votes’\" and found\nthat the quoted language and several newspaper articles pro-\nvided sufficient justification for the campaign finance law at\nissue in that case. 528 U.S. at 393-94. In fact, the Supreme\nCourt noted that the case did not even \"present a close call.\"\nId. at 393. In light of Nixon, the district court mistakenly dis-\ncounted affidavits supporting the inclusion of periodicals in\nthe \"electioneering communication\" definition.\n\n   When combined with other materials in the record, the affi-\ndavits discussed above provide ample support for including\nnewspapers, magazines, and other periodicals in West Virgin-\nia’s \"electioneering communication\" definition. The West\nVirginia Code specifies that the West Virginia legislature\nenacted the campaign finance regime to \"serve[ ] a substantial\ngovernmental interest in informing the electorate.\" W. Va\nCode. § 3-8-1(a)(5). Furthermore, the statute explicitly men-\ntions the legislature’s fear that \"[f]ailing to regulate non-\nbroadcast media messages would permit those desiring to\ninfluence elections to avoid the principles and policies that are\nembodied in existing state law.\" Id. § 3-8-1(a)(7). The affida-\nvits explain that including non-broadcast media—such as\nperiodicals—in the \"electioneering communication\" definition\naddresses these concerns. David H. Gold, the president of a\ndirect mailing company, attested that \"[t]he use of direct mail\nand other forms of non-broadcast media is and has been\nincreasing\" and that limiting disclosure rules to broadcast\nmedia causes \"entities seeking to hide the source of their\nfunds [to] shift their expenditures into direct mail and other\ncost effective non-broadcast media.\" In fact, as Pamela M.\n\f           CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT            23\nVan Horn—the executive director of the West Virginia Dem-\nocratic Legislative Council—highlighted in her affidavit,\nCFIF itself shifted its spending from broadcast media to\nnewspaper advertisements so it did not have to comply with\nWest Virginia’s reporting requirements. These affidavits\nclearly support the informational purpose that the West Vir-\nginia legislature enunciated in the statutory text, especially in\nlight of our duty to defer to legislative judgments.\n\n   In addition to downplaying the relevance of these affida-\nvits, the district court also discredited a spreadsheet that Nich-\nolas Casey—the chairman of the West Virginia State\nDemocratic Party—compiled and submitted. The spreadsheet\ndetails third-party spending during select 2006 and 2008 West\nVirginia elections. Because the spreadsheet specifies that only\n\"a minuscule 0.4% of third-party spending\" financed\n\"print/newspaper\" communications, the district court deter-\nmined that (1) including periodicals in the \"electioneering\ncommunication\" definition did not bear a substantial relation\nto the state’s interests and (2) the law is \"severely underinclu-\nsive\" because it neglects to include other, more prevalent\nforms of print media, such as direct mail. CFIF III, 849 F.\nSupp. 2d at 695. However, independent groups’ current\neschewal of periodical advertising says nothing regarding the\nlegislature’s fear that these organizations will shift from\nbroadcast to print media to avoid the reporting and disclaimer\nrequirements, thereby preventing the electorate from receiv-\ning valuable information about the source of campaign-related\nspending. Consequently, regardless of how little electioneer-\ning communication appears in periodicals, regulating this\nform of communication furthers the state’s interest in inform-\ning the electorate.\n\n   The district court’s uneasiness about the \"electioneering\ncommunication\" definition’s underinclusivity more closely\napproximates our concern with that provision. We recognize\nthe Supreme Court’s admonition that \"a statute is not invalid\nunder the Constitution because it might have gone farther than\n\f24         CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT\nit did, . . . a legislature need not strike at all evils at the same\ntime, and . . . reform may take one step at a time.\" Buckley,\n424 U.S. at 105 (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). However, a state legislature must provide some\nrationale for electing to proceed one step at a time. See Tur-\nner, 520 U.S. at 196. Although the affidavits that West Vir-\nginia submitted sufficiently support its decision to regulate\nperiodicals and other non-broadcast media, they do not justify\nthe legislature’s decision to regulate periodicals to the exclu-\nsion of other non-broadcast media, such as direct mailings.\n\n   We recognize that the West Virginia legislature likely elim-\ninated direct mailings, telephone banks, and billboard adver-\ntising from its \"electioneering communication\" definition to\ncomply with the district court’s October 2008 decision—a\ndecision we now see as erroneous because it found that West\nVirginia could not regulate non-broadcast media as a general\nmatter.

However, we\nconclude that the district court erred in finding that the\n§ 501(c)(3) exemption could survive constitutional scrutiny.\n\f           CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT            25\n                               A.\n\n   CFIF raises two challenges to West Virginia’s \"grassroots\nlobbying\" exemption, which specifies that \"electioneering\ncommunication\" does not include \"communication[s] made\nwhile the Legislature is in session which, incidental to pro-\nmoting or opposing a specific piece of legislation pending\nbefore the legislature, urges the audience to communicate\nwith a member or members of the Legislature concerning that\npiece of legislation.\" W. Va. Code § 3-8-1a(11)(B)(v). CFIF\nargues (1) that the phrase \"promoting or opposing\" and the\nword \"incidental\" are vague and (2) that the provision dis-\ncriminates based on content and viewpoint. However, as dis-\ncussed below, CFIF’s contentions lack merit.\n\n                     Vagueness Challenge\n\n   As noted above, statutes are unconstitutionally vague when\nthey fail to \"give the person of ordinary intelligence a reason-\nable opportunity to know what is prohibited.\" Grayned, 408\nU.S. at 108. CFIF relies upon this Court’s decision in North\nCarolina Right to Life, Inc. v. Bartlett to support its vagueness\nargument. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762034\"><a href=\"/opinion/762034/north-carolina-right-to-life-incorporated-north-carolina-right-to-life/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 1999). The relevant portion\nof the statute at issue in Bartlett defined a political committee\nas a group whose \"primary or incidental purpose . . . is to sup-\nport or oppose any candidate or to influence or attempt to\ninfluence the result of an election.\" Id. at 712. The plaintiff in\nthat case similarly argued that the provision was unconstitu-\ntionally vague, and this Court agreed. Id. at 713. However,\ndifferences between the circumstances at issue in Bartlett and\nthe situation at hand counsel against adopting Bartlett’s rea-\nsoning in this case.\n\n   As the district court correctly pointed out, the North Caro-\nlina statute at issue in Bartlett and the statute under consider-\nation in this case use the word \"incidental\" in different\nmanners. In Bartlett, this Court implied that \"incidental\"\ncould mean \"accidental\" or \"unplanned\" in the context of the\n\f26         CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT\nNorth Carolina statute when it explained that the word \"ex-\npressly sweeps within [the statute’s] ambit those groups that\nonly incidentally engage in express advocacy.\" 168 F.3d at\n712; see also The American Heritage College Dictionary 700\n(4th ed. 2002) (defining \"incidental\" as \"[o]ccurring or likely\nto occur as an unpredictable or minor accompaniment\"). This\nreading of the statute essentially requires organizations seek-\ning to comply with its requirements to discern when their\ncommunications unintentionally promote or oppose a candi-\ndate or accidentally influence an election, which, understand-\nably, a person of ordinary intelligence would find difficult. By\ncontrast, the district court properly recognized that the West\nVirginia statute’s language—\"incidental to promoting or\nopposing a specific piece of legislation\"—clearly invokes the\nphrase \"incident to\" despite its inapt use of the word \"inciden-\ntal.\" CFIF III, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">849</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 701. Black’s Law Dictio-\nnary defines \"incident\" as \"[d]ependent upon, subordinate to,\narising out of, or otherwise connected with.\" Black’s Law\nDictionary 830 (9th ed. 2009). In light of the wording of West\nVirginia’s statute, it is clear that the legislature intended this\nmeaning rather than the definition that this Court held to be\nvague in Bartlett. Consequently, the exemption’s incorpora-\ntion of the word \"incidental\" does not prevent a person of\nordinary intelligence from understanding its import.\n\n   Next, CFIF alleges that the phrase \"promoting or opposing\"\nis impermissibly vague because it \"turn[s] on the speaker’s\nperceived intent\" and requires speculation regarding the \"po-\ntential effect of the speech on listeners.\" To support its argu-\nment, CFIF relies on Buckley v. Valeo, which held that the\nD.C. Circuit failed to cure an election statute’s vagueness\nwhen that circuit construed the statute to apply only to speech\n\"advocating the election or defeat of\" a candidate. 424 U.S.\nat 42-43. In Buckley, the Supreme Court determined that the\nD.C. Circuit’s clarification remained vague because it consti-\ntuted an impermissible \"intent-and-effect\" test that put speak-\ners \"at the mercy of the varied understanding of [their] hearers\n\f            CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT                 27\nand consequently of whatever inference may be drawn as to\n[their] intent and meaning.\" Id.\n\n   The district court countered CFIF’s argument by citing\nfootnote 64 of McConnell v. FEC, which explicitly held that\nthe words \"promote\" and \"oppose\" were not unconstitution-\nally vague. 540 U.S. at 170 n.64. In McConnell, the Supreme\nCourt held that campaign finance statutes featuring the words\n\"promote\" and \"oppose\" \"give the person of ordinary intelli-\ngence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited.\"\nId. Although the Court recognized that \"[t]his is particularly\nthe case here, since actions taken by political parties are pre-\nsumed to be in connection with election campaigns,\" it did not\nlimit its holding to situations involving political parties. Id.\n\n   Despite CFIF’s arguments that this Court’s decision in\nLeake \"flatly rejected the notion that footnote 64 in McCon-\nnell applies to speech beyond that by political parties,\" Leake\nmerely held that a statutory scheme incorporating the phrase\n\"support or oppose\" was unconstitutionally vague due to addi-\ntional language that does not appear in West Virginia’s stat-\nute. 525 F.3d at 280-81, 285-86 (concluding that the statute\nwas vague because it \"determine[d] whether speech [was]\nregulable based on how a ‘reasonable person’ interpret[ed] the\nspeech’s ‘essential nature’ in light of four ‘contextual fac-\ntors’\"). Additionally, WRTL II does not require us to strike\ndown the exemption because—contrary to CFIF’s asser-\ntions—that case has no effect on McConnell’s conclusion\nregarding \"promote and oppose\"; WRTL II simply reiterated\nthat intent-and-effect tests were impermissible while passing\nno judgment regarding McConnell’s vagueness holding. 551\nU.S. at 465. Consequently, pursuant to McConnell, the words\n\"promote\" and \"oppose\" do not render the grassroots lobbying\nexemption vague, allowing the exemption to survive CFIF’s\nvagueness challenge.5\n  5\n   CFIF also argues that the phrase \"urges the audience\" is vague in its\nreply brief. However, in its renewed motion for summary judgment, CFIF\n\f28          CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT\n       Content and Viewpoint Discrimination Challenge\n\n   In addition to arguing that the grassroots lobbying exemp-\ntion is impermissibly vague, CFIF contends that the provision\nunconstitutionally discriminates based on communications’\ncontent and viewpoint. In particular, CFIF points out that the\nprovision (1) exempts speech that occurs while the legislature\nis in session but burdens speech that takes place at other\ntimes, (2) exempts communications that concern specific,\npending legislation but burdens speech regarding other legis-\nlation, (3) exempts speech urging contact with legislators but\nburdens communications that encourage reaching out to non-\nincumbents or executive branch officials, and (4) exempts\ncommunications that support or oppose legislation but bur-\ndens speech that requests other action, such as recommending\nthat a nominee be confirmed.

TENNANT           29\nto that interest to withstand exacting scrutiny; in other words,\nwe will uphold the grassroots lobbying exemption if the com-\nmunications that it encompasses do not bear a substantial rela-\ntion to providing the public with information. The district\ncourt reasoned that communications that relate to pending leg-\nislation and take place while the legislature is in session are\nmore likely to be true issue advocacy—the regulation of\nwhich the Supreme Court has been loath to endorse—rather\nthan express advocacy masquerading as issue advocacy.\nWRTL II, 551 U.S. at 455-57; CFIF III, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">849</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The court therefore held that the exemption was neces-\nsary because the statutory scheme \"imposes reporting require-\nments on communications more likely to be ‘sham issue ads’\nand because the exemption spares from reporting require-\nments those communications least likely to be ‘sham issue\nads.’\" Id.\n\n   Although West Virginia offers weak evidentiary support\nfor its argument that the legislature crafted this exemption to\navoid burdening pure issue advocacy, considering the type of\nspeech the legislature chose to exempt makes the legislature’s\naim abundantly clear. Furthermore, the statute itself recog-\nnizes the importance of distinguishing issue advocacy from\nexpress advocacy by explaining that \"[d]isclosure by persons\nand entities that make expenditures for communications that\nexpressly advocate the election or defeat of clearly identified\ncandidates\" is a \"reasonable and minimally restrictive method\nof furthering First Amendment values by public exposure.\"\nW. Va. Code § 3-8-1(a)(6). In all likelihood, if West Virginia\nhad not included this exemption, CFIF would have challenged\nthe regulatory scheme as overbroad due to its applicability to\nissue advocacy. Therefore, the district court correctly found\nthat the grassroots lobbying exemption allows the \"election-\neering communication\" definition to survive exacting scru-\ntiny, and the exemption does not impermissibly discriminate\non the basis of communications’ content and viewpoint.\n\f30        CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT\n                              B.\n\n   Next, CFIF alleges that the statute’s exemption for news\naccounts is unconstitutionally vague due to its inclusion of the\nphrase \"bona fide news account.\" Under the exemption, \"bona\nfide news account[s]\" that a speaker \"disseminate[s] through\na medium owned or controlled by a political party, political\ncommittee or candidate\" are not electioneering communica-\ntions. W. Va. § 3-8-1a(11)(B)(i). The district court held that\nCFIF lacked standing to challenge this provision because\nCFIF (1) does not publish or intend to publish news stories\nand (2) does not function as a political party, political com-\nmittee, or candidate.

There-\nfore, the district court properly held that CFIF lacks standing\nto challenge the \"bona fide news account\" exemption.\n\n                              C.\n\n   Finally, CFIF contends that the statute’s exemption for\n\"communication[s] paid for by any organization operating\nunder § 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code\" unconstitu-\ntionally discriminates against § 501(c)(4) organizations such\nas CFIF.

TENNANT            31\nstitutionally permissible, Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 914,\nand, as explained above, the only sufficiently important gov-\nernmental interest at stake in this case is providing the elector-\nate with information about the source of campaign-related\nspending. Consequently, because we are evaluating an\nexemption to the campaign finance regime, West Virginia\nmust demonstrate that regulating communications that fall\nwithin the exemption does not bear a substantial relation to\nthis governmental interest. For the reasons we outline below,\nWest Virginia has failed to make this showing.\n\n   The Internal Revenue Code prohibits § 501(c)(3) organiza-\ntions from \"participat[ing] in, or interven[ing] in (including\nthe publishing or distributing of statements), any political\ncampaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for\npublic office.\" 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3). As noted above, West\nVirginia exempts these organizations from complying with\nreporting and disclaimer requirements that other organizations\nengaging in electioneering communication must satisfy. West\nVirginia’s § 501(c)(3) exemption is identical to a since-\nrepealed regulatory provision that the FEC promulgated to\nenforce the BCRA. 11 C.F.R. § 100.29(c)(6) (repealed Jan.\n19, 2006). In light the fact that the Internal Revenue Code\nprohibits § 501(c)(3) organizations from engaging in express\nadvocacy, the FEC noted that commentators had concluded\nthat the \"‘BCRA’s application to 501(c)(3)s [would] prohib-\nit[ ] activity that is already forbidden,’ and the activities the\nInternal Revenue Service permits 501(c)(3) organizations to\nengage in are activities ‘that BCRA was not intended to\nreach.’\" 67 Fed. Reg. 65,190-01, 65,199 (Oct. 23, 2002)\n(alteration in original). The district court relied on this logic\nwhen upholding the West Virginia exemption.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 707-08.\n\n   However, the district court erred in finding that the\n§ 501(c)(3) exemption could withstand exacting scrutiny for\nat least two reasons. First, exemptions such as the one at issue\nin this case assume that campaign finance laws and\n\f32         CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT\n§ 501(c)(3) are coextensive in terms of the electioneering\ncommunication that they prohibit, which may not be the case.\nSee Shays v. FEC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2470116\"><a href=\"/opinion/2470116/shays-v-fec/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

See CFIF III, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">849</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 708. The FEC rescinded\nthis regulation in 2006 after a district court held that the\nexception lacked \"reasoned analysis\" to support it. See Shays,\n337 F. Supp. 2d at 127-28. As discussed in detail above, legis-\nlatures must base their conclusions on substantial evidence.\nSee Turner, 520 U.S. at 196. In light of the federal regula-\ntion’s history and the lack of other support for the exemption,\nwe are unable to find that the \"electioneering communication\"\ndefinition bears a substantial relation to the government’s\ninterest in informing the electorate with the § 501(c)(3)\nexemption in place.\n\n   CFIF contends that, if any of the exemptions is constitu-\ntionally impermissible, we must invalidate the entire regula-\ntory scheme affecting electioneering communications because\nstriking the exemption would burden more speech than the\nlegislature intended to restrict. Although CFIF correctly sug-\ngests that \"when a section of a statute is declared void, the\nstatute cannot be given effect as though the legislature had not\nenacted the conditions limiting its operation,\" Quinn v.\nComm’r, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"330706\"><a href=\"/opinion/330706/howard-b-quinn-and-charlotte-j-quinn-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">617</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 626 (7th Cir. 1975), this drastic rem-\nedy is unnecessary in this case. In McCorkle v. United States,\nthis Court explained that, \"[u]nless it is evident that the legis-\nlature would not have enacted those provisions which are\nwithin its power, independently of that which is not, the\ninvalid part may be dropped if what is left is fully operative\nas a law.\" </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"348283\"><a href=\"/opinion/348283/william-c-mccorkle-jr-on-behalf-of-himself-and-all-others-similarly/\"><span class=\"volume\">559</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1258</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1261 (4th Cir. 1977). It is hard to\n\f           CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT          33\nbelieve that West Virginia would have foregone regulating\nelectioneering communications if it had to subject § 501(c)(3)\norganizations to the statutory requirements. We therefore\ninvalidate the § 501(c)(3) exemption while leaving the rest of\nthe \"electioneering communication\" definition intact.\n\n                              VI.\n\n   In addition to challenging the definitional portions of West\nVirginia’s campaign finance laws, CFIF also challenges one\nof the statutory scheme’s substantive requirements. In rele-\nvant part, the West Virginia Code requires individuals who\nengage in electioneering communication to comply with the\nfollowing reporting requirements:\n\n1. Every person who spends a total of $5,000 or more during\n   any calendar year on electioneering communication must\n   file reports with West Virginia’s secretary of state within\n   twenty-four hours of the \"disclosure date,\" which is the\n   date when the individual spends $5,000 on electioneering\n   communication in a calendar year. Individuals must file\n   these reports each time they spend $5,000. W. Va. Code\n   §§ 3-8-1a(9), 3-8-2b(a)(1).\n\n2.   Every person who spends a total of $1,000 or more dur-\n     ing the two weeks immediately preceding an election\n     must file a report with West Virginia’s secretary of state.\n     Individuals must file these reports within twenty-four\n     hours of the \"disclosure date,\" which West Virginia\n     defines in the same manner for both electioneering com-\n     munication reporting requirements. Id. §§ 3-8-1a(9), 3-8-\n     2b(a)(2).\n\nWest Virginia also requires electioneering communications to\nfeature certain disclaimers. The disclaimers must (1) clearly\nindicate that a candidate or candidate’s committee did not\nauthorize the communication and (2) clearly identify the per-\nson making the expenditure. Id. § 3-8-2b(e). CFIF’s challenge\n\f34        CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT\nfocuses on the reporting requirements for electioneering com-\nmunications rather than the disclaimer requirements.\n\n   CFIF specifically contends that West Virginia Code section\n3-8-2b(b)(5) is ambiguous. That provision mandates disclo-\nsure of the \"names and addresses of any contributors who\ncontributed a total of more than one thousand dollars between\nthe first day of the preceding calendar year and the disclosure\ndate whose contributions were used to pay for electioneering\ncommunications\" but provides no clear guide for determining\nwhen an organization \"used\" a contribution \"to pay for elec-\ntioneering communications.\" See W. Va. Code § 3-8-2b(b)(5).\nIn light of this alleged ambiguity, CFIF argues that the provi-\nsion requires cautious organizations to disclose the names and\naddresses of all contributors who donate more than $1,000\nwithin the applicable timeframe, even when they contributed\nto the organization’s general treasury. CFIF then maintains\nthat requiring organizations to file reports regarding their gen-\neral treasury contributions does not serve West Virginia’s\ninterest in informing the electorate, precluding the reporting\nrequirement from surviving exacting scrutiny. West Virginia,\nin turn, asserts that section 3-8-2b(b)(5) is not ambiguous and\nthat the provision can survive exacting scrutiny even if we\naccept CFIF’s broad interpretation.\n\n   Like all campaign finance-related disclosure requirements,\nWest Virginia Code section 3-8-2b(b)(5) is subject to exacting\nscrutiny. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 914. As previously\nnoted, this standard requires regulatory provisions to bear a\n\"substantial relation\" to a \"sufficiently important\" governmen-\ntal interest. Id. (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 64, 66). For the\nreasons we outline above, the only governmental interest at\nstake in this case is West Virginia’s interest in providing the\nelectorate with information about the source of campaign-\nrelated spending. Consequently, West Virginia Code section\n3-8-2b(b)(5) must bear a substantial relation to this interest to\npass constitutional muster.\n\f          CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT          35\n   The district court agreed with CFIF’s contention that West\nVirginia code section 3-8-2b(b)(5)’s ambiguity prevented it\nfrom surviving exacting scrutiny. The court determined that\ncompelling expansive disclosure of treasury contributions\nwould result in a \"flood of information\" about donors who\nmay not have directly financed electioneering communica-\ntions. The court reasoned that, rather than furthering West\nVirginia’s interest in informing the electorate, providing\ninformation about corporate treasury donations could hinder\nWest Virginia’s goal by inundating the public with marginally\nrelevant information. The district court also feared that a\nbroad disclosure requirement would be so administratively\nonerous for organizations such as CFIF that it would discour-\nage them from speaking at all. To avoid overwhelming the\npublic with information and unduly burdening groups who\nengage in electioneering communication, the district court\nrestricted the reporting requirement to contributions from \"in-\ndividuals who respond to a solicitation for electioneering\ncommunications or earmark their contributions for such use,\"\na solution that it drew from an FEC regulation.

As the below analysis illus-\ntrates, we find that McConnell controls this case and\nnecessitates reversing the district court’s conclusion that West\nVirginia’s electioneering communication reporting require-\nments cannot survive exacting scrutiny.\n\n   At the time the Supreme Court decided McConnell, the\nBCRA barred corporations from using general treasury funds\nto finance electioneering communications and required them\nto establish a \"separate segregated fund\" for such expendi-\ntures. 2 U.S.C. § 441b(b)(2), invalidated by Citizens United,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1741\"><a href=\"/opinion/1741/citizens-united-v-federal-election-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; McConnell, 540 U.S. at 195 & n.79. Conse-\nquently, when the Supreme Court decided McConnell,\n§ 434(f)(1) could not suffer from the same purported ambigu-\nity that allegedly prevents West Virginia Code section 3-8-\n2b(b)(5) from surviving exacting scrutiny, even though aver-\nage individuals could just as easily interpret § 434(f)(1) to\nencompass general treasury donations absent the \"separate\nsegregated fund\" requirement. However, in Citizens United,\nthe Supreme Court ruled that federal law’s ban on using cor-\nporate treasury funds to engage in express advocacy was\nunconstitutional while simultaneously approving of McCon-\nnell’s conclusion that 2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(1) was facially valid.\nSee Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 913-14. Citizens United\ntherefore demonstrates that the Supreme Court’s conclusion\nregarding § 434(f)(1)’s constitutionality was not tied to the\nprohibition regarding corporate treasury funds. Accordingly,\neven if we assume for the sake of argument that section 3-8-\n2b(b)(5) is ambiguous, McConnell compels us to find that the\nprovision is constitutional. We therefore reverse the district\ncourt’s conclusion that section 3-8-2b(b)(5) cannot survive\nexacting scrutiny and its decision to impose an \"earmarked\nfunds\" limiting construction to cure the provision’s alleged\nunconstitutionality.\n\f            CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT                    37\n                                   VII.\n\n   Like CFIF, WVFL also raises certain challenges to the stat-\nutory scheme’s substantive requirements. Specifically, WVFL\ncontends in its reply brief that the electioneering communica-\ntion reporting and disclaimer requirements described above\nand the similar reporting and disclaimer requirements for\ngroups that make independent expenditures6 are \"patently\nunreasonable\" and \"severely burden First Amendment rights.\"\nHowever, we cannot consider this issue because WVFL did\nnot file an appeal in this case. See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(3);\nThurston v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"482493\"><a href=\"/opinion/482493/elizabeth-hall-thurston-v-united-states-of-america-elizabeth-h-thurston/\"><span class=\"volume\">810</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">438</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 447 (4th Cir. 1987).\nThe district court’s conclusion that the reporting and dis-\nclaimer requirements are constitutional therefore remains\nundisturbed. See CFIF III, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">849</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 711-15.\n  6\n   Organizations that make independent expenditures must comply with\nthe following requirements:\n1. A person who makes independent expenditures totaling more than\n   $1,000 during a calendar year must file a report with West Virginia’s\n   secretary of state. W. Va. Code § 3-8-2(b)(1).\n2. Any person who makes or contracts to make independent expenditures\n   aggregating $10,000 or more at any time before an election must file\n   a report with West Virginia’s secretary of state within forty-eight\n   hours. Id. § 3-8-2(d)(1). Thereafter, the person must file an additional\n   report for each aggregate $10,000 he or she spends within forty-eight\n   hours of the expenditure. Id. § 3-8-2(d)(2).\n3. Any person who makes or contracts to make independent expenditures\n   within the two weeks before an election aggregating either $1,000 (for\n   multi-county or statewide elections) or $500 (for single-county or\n   municipal elections) must file a report describing the expenditure with\n   West Virginia’s secretary of state within twenty-four hours. Id. § 3-8-\n   2(c)(1). The person must file an additional report for each aggregate\n   $1,000 or $500 he or she spends within twenty-four hours of the expen-\n   diture. Id. § 3-8-2(c)(2).\nFinally, West Virginia imposes the same disclaimer requirements on both\nindependent expenditures and electioneering communications. As noted\nabove, these disclaimers must (1) clearly indicate that a candidate or can-\ndidate’s committee did not authorize the communication and (2) clearly\nidentify the person making the expenditure. Id. §§ 3-8-2(e), 3-8-2b(e).\n\f38         CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT\n                              VIII.\n\n   Finally, West Virginia contends that the district court\nshould have vacated as moot its earlier injunctions because\nWest Virginia had repealed the statutory provisions that were\nsubject to the injunctions. Instead of vacating the injunctions,\nthe court reiterated the decision it made when it dissolved the\nApril 2008 injunction: \"‘dissolution of this court’s prelimi-\nnary injunction order . . . does not mean that either the new\nor old versions of West Virginia’s Election Code may be\napplied to violations that are alleged to have occurred prior to’\nthe date of dissolution.\" CFIF III, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">849</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

W. Va. Sept. 29, 2008)). Hence, under the district\ncourt’s ruling, West Virginia cannot punish offenders for vio-\nlating the provisions that were subject to the injunctions while\nthe injunctions were in effect.\n\n   Under West Virginia law, the state can enforce a repealed\nlaw after the repeal becomes effective as long as the offense\noccurred while the statute was in effect. W. Va. Code § 2-2-\n8. Therefore, if we vacate the injunctions as moot, West Vir-\nginia will have the power to punish organizations for earlier\nviolations of the statute. In Jacobus v. Alaska, on which CFIF\nrelies, the Ninth Circuit explained that, \"[d]espite superseding\nevents, an issue is not moot if there are present effects that are\nlegally significant.\" </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783034\"><a href=\"/opinion/783034/kenneth-p-jacobus-kenneth-p-jacobus-pc-wayne-anthony-ross-ross-miner/\"><span class=\"volume\">338</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1095</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1104 (9th Cir. 2003). The\nNinth Circuit found that the plaintiffs’ claims were not moot\nbecause the state was \"likely\" to prosecute, citing a letter from\nthe relevant regulatory body reserving the right to prosecute\npast violations. Jacobus, 338 F.3d at 1104.\n\n   In this case, West Virginia’s secretary of state attested that\nher \"office will not seek to enforce those provisions of said\nArticles that have been repealed.\" CFIF relies primarily on a\nstatement that another official made during a radio broadcast\nin 2008 and an election law complaint that West Virginia’s\n\f           CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM v. TENNANT            39\nattorney general filed over three years ago to support its argu-\nment. We admit that this evidence does not overwhelmingly\ndemonstrate that the repealed provisions remain \"legally sig-\nnificant,\" especially in light of the secretary of state’s affida-\nvit. However, as discussed above, we review the district\ncourt’s decision regarding the preliminary injunction for\nabuse of discretion. See Conservation Council of N.C., 528\nF.2d at 251-52. Despite the weakness of the evidence in favor\nof CFIF’s argument, we decline to go so far as to find that the\ndistrict court abused its discretion when it decided to dissolve\nthe injunctions rather than vacating them as moot. We there-\nfore affirm the district court’s decision to prohibit West Vir-\nginia from prosecuting individuals who violated the enjoined\ncampaign finance provisions while the injunctions were in\neffect.\n\n                               IX.\n\n  For the foregoing reasons, we affirm in part, reverse in part,\nand remand for further proceedings consistent with this opin-\nion.\n\n                                         AFFIRMED IN PART,\n                                         REVERSED IN PART,\n                                            AND REMANDED\n\f</pre>",
