We affirm.\n\n                                BACKGROUND\n\n      In 2011, Paul Ziff, Ziff Energy Group, Ltd., and Ziff Energy Management\n\nCorporation [collectively, “the Ziffs”] filed suit against KPMG, LLP (Canada) in a\n\nCanadian court alleging accounting malpractice and professional liability.       In\n\nAugust 2011, KPMG (Canada) then filed a third-party claim against Feldman and\n\nthe Feldman Law firm [collectively, “Feldman”] seeking indemnity and\n\ncontribution in the event that KPMG (Canada) was held liable to the Ziffs.\n\nFeldman failed to appear and KPMG (Canada) obtained a default judgment against\n\nFeldman in September 2011.\n\n      In October 2011, after he was already in default in the Canadian court,\n\nFeldman filed a suit against KPMG (Canada), its U.S. counterpart, KPMG, LLP\n\n[collectively, “KPMG” unless specified as KPMG (Canada)] and the Ziffs.\n\nSpecifically, Feldman sought a declaratory judgment “under the Uniform\n\nDeclaratory Judgments Act (“UDHA”) decreeing that neither Paul Ziff, Ziff\n\nEnergy, Ziff Management, nor [KPMG] can bring an action against [him] in a\n\nforeign country for claims that have long expired.”\n\n      KPMG answered, asserted a compulsory counterclaim against Feldman, and\n\nrequested the trial court to dismiss the suit “because a declaratory judgment is not\n\n                                         2\n\favailable to resolve an issue when another action is pending that will adjudicate the\n\nsame issue between the parties.” The Ziffs also answered and filed a plea to the\n\njurisdiction, asserting, among other reasons, that the declaratory judgment should\n\nbe dismissed because of the pending suit in Canada.\n\n         Thereafter, Ziff settled its Canadian claims against KPMG (Canada) in\n\nJanuary 2012. Nevertheless, Feldman continued to pursue discovery in the Harris\n\nCounty case “to ensure that the Plaintiffs are out of this matter once and for all and\n\nto recover their costs.” The Ziffs then offered Feldman a mutual release, which\n\nFeldman declined, continuing to pursue discovery. Feldman was not interested in\n\na mutual release in which each party would incur its own costs. Rather, he wanted\n\na “full release from liability, after which the parties could discuss costs incurred to\n\ndate.”\n\n         In January 2012, KPMG (Canada) filed a notice of nonsuit as to its\n\ncounterclaims against Feldman in the Harris County case. The nonsuit stated that\n\nthe counterclaim was moot “as a result of a settlement reached in the underlying\n\nCalgary litigation.” An exhibit attached to the non-suit was a “Discontinuance” of\n\nthe third-party claim against Feldman in Canada. Soon thereafter, the Ziffs sent\n\nFeldman both a mutual release, which Feldman again refused to sign, and a\n\nunilateral release.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f      Thereafter, the trial court granted the plea to the jurisdiction and dismissed\n\nFeldman’s claims on February 28, 2012.\n\n      On March 9, 2012, the Ziffs filed a motion to modify the judgment to\n\ninclude their attorney’s fees and costs. On April 18, 2012, the trial court denied\n\nthe Ziffs’ motion to modify, but instead, reinstated the case in part and set the case\n\nfor trial on the issue of the Ziffs’ request for attorney’s fees under the UDJA.\n\n      After a jury trial, the court entered a final judgment in which it “ORDERED,\n\nADJUDGED, AND DECREED that it is both equitable and just that the Ziff\n\nDefendants recover their reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees from the\n\nPlaintiffs under the Declaratory Judgment Act.” Based on the jury verdict, the\n\njudgment also awarded the Ziffs $36,952 in attorney’s fees, post-judgment interest,\n\nplus contingent amounts available in the event of post-judgment appeals. This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n      PROPRIETY OF DISMISSAL FOR WANT OF JURISDICTION\n\nStandard of Review\n\n      A plea to the jurisdiction challenges a trial court’s authority to decide the\n\nsubject matter of a specific cause of action. See Tex. Dep’t of Parks & Wildlife v.\n\nMiranda, 133 S.W.3d 217, 225–26 (Tex. 2004). Whether this authority exists turns\n\nin the first instance on the content of the claimant’s live pleadings. Id. at 226. The\n\nplaintiff has the initial burden of alleging facts that would affirmatively\n\n                                          4\n\fdemonstrate the trial court’s jurisdiction to hear the cause. Id. (citing Tex. Ass’n of\n\nBus. v. Tex. Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 446 (Tex. 1993)). Mere unsupported\n\nlegal conclusions do not suffice. See Creedmoor–Maha Water Supply Corp. v. Tex.\n\nComm’n on Envtl. Quality, 307 S.W.3d 505, 515–16 & nn. 7 & 8 (Tex. App.—\n\nAustin 2010, no pet.). We construe the pleadings liberally, taking them as true, and\n\nlook to the pleader’s intent. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 226. If the pleadings fail to\n\nallege sufficient facts to affirmatively demonstrate the trial court’s jurisdiction but\n\nalso fail to affirmatively demonstrate incurable defects in jurisdiction, the issue is\n\none of pleading sufficiency, and the plaintiff should be afforded the opportunity to\n\namend. Id. at 226–27. If, on the other hand, the pleadings affirmatively negate the\n\nexistence of jurisdiction, then a plea to the jurisdiction may be granted without\n\nallowing the plaintiff an opportunity to amend. Id. at 227.\n\n       We may also consider evidence that the parties have submitted and must do\n\nso when necessary to resolve the jurisdictional issues. Bland Indep. Sch. Dist. v.\n\nBlue, 34 S.W.3d 547, 555 (Tex. 2000). In fact, in a plea to the jurisdiction, a party\n\nmay present evidence to negate the existence of a jurisdictional fact alleged in the\n\npleadings, which we would otherwise presume to be true. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at\n\n227; Hendee v. Dewhurst, 228 S.W.3d 354, 367 (Tex. App.—Austin 2007, pet.\n\ndenied). How we review a trial court’s explicit or implicit determination of such a\n\nchallenge depends on whether the jurisdictional fact being challenged overlaps\n\n                                          5\n\fwith the merits of the plaintiff’s claims. If the challenged jurisdictional fact\n\noverlaps with the merits of the plaintiff's claims, the party asserting the plea to\n\nthe jurisdiction must overcome a traditional-summary-judgment-like burden and\n\nconclusively negate that fact. See Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228; Hendee, 228\n\nS.W.3d at 367. But if the challenged jurisdictional fact does not overlap the merits,\n\nthe fact issue may be resolved by the trial court when resolving the jurisdictional\n\nissue, and its explicit or implicit fact finding (or failure-to-find) may be challenged\n\nin the same manner as fact findings generally. Combs v. Entm’t Publ'ns, Inc., 292\n\nS.W.3d 712, 719 (Tex. App.—Austin 2009, no pet.).\n\n      Our ultimate inquiry is whether the particular facts presented, as determined\n\nby the foregoing review of the pleadings and any evidence, affirmatively\n\ndemonstrate a claim within the trial court’s subject-matter jurisdiction,\n\nsee Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 226; Creedmoor–Maha, 307 S.W.3d at 513, 516 &\n\nn.8, which is a question of law that we review de novo. See Miranda, 133 S.W.3d\n\nat 226.\n\nAnalysis\n\n      Feldman argues that the trial court erred in dismissing its suit for want of\n\njurisdiction because there is a justiciable issue between the parties, the district\n\ncourt is a court of general jurisdiction and may declare the legal rights and\n\nobligations of the parties, and the case exceeds the amount in controversy required\n\n                                          6\n\fto maintain a suit in district court. Feldman further cites MBM Fin. Corp v.\n\nWoodlands Operating Co., L.P., 292 S.W.3d 660, 668 (Tex. 2009) for the\n\nproposition that a declaratory judgment is a proper vehicle for asserting a claim of\n\n“non-liability” in a contract case. MBM Financial, however, is distinguishable\n\nbecause the Canadian suit appears to be a claim for professional malpractice, i.e., a\n\ntort claim. Under most circumstances, Texas courts should decline to exercise\n\njurisdiction in a case seeking a declaration of non-liability in a tort suit because to\n\ndo so deprives the potential plaintiff of the right to determine where and when to\n\nfile suit. See MBM Financial, 292 S.W.3d at 668; Abor v. Black, 695 S.W.2d 564,\n\n566 (Tex. 1985).\n\n      However, even if the Canadian suit involves contract claims, we would still\n\nfind MBM Financial distinguishable. We agree that a declaratory judgment may be\n\nused to assert a claim of non-liability in a contract case. See MBM Financial, 292\n\nS.W.3d at 668.     The issue presented here, however, is whether a declaratory\n\njudgment may be used to assert a claim of non-liability in a contract case when\n\nthere is already a breach-of-contract case pending in another court. As such, this\n\ncase is distinguishable from MBM Financial, in which the plaintiff filed a breach-\n\nof-contract case and, in the same suit, requested a declaration of non-liability to the\n\ndefendant. 292 S.W.3d at 663. The Supreme Court held that a declaration of non-\n\nliability was an appropriate subject of a declaratory judgment in a contract case, as\n\n                                          7\n\fopposed to a tort case, because both parties suffer when a contract collapses and\n\nthere is no “real plaintiff” necessarily deserving of the right to choose the\n\njurisdiction. Id. at 668. However, the plaintiff could not recover attorney’s fees\n\nwhen it had failed to recover damages on its breach-of-contract claim. Id. at 669–\n\n70. There was no previously filed breach-of-contract lawsuit in MBM Financial;\n\nmerely a declaratory judgment request that was “tacked on” to the plaintiff’s own\n\nbreach-of-contract suit. As such, MBM Financial does not resolve the issue of\n\nwhether a district court should exercise jurisdiction over a declaratory judgment\n\naction requesting a declaration of non-liability in a contract case when a breach-of-\n\ncontract case is already pending in another court.\n\n      The Ziffs and KPMG contend that this case is controlled by Texas Liquor\n\nControl Board v. Canyon Creek Land Corp., 456 S.W.2d 891 (Tex. 1970).             In\n\nCanyon Creek, the plaintiffs filed a declaratory judgment seeking to prevent the\n\nTexas Liquor Control Board from enforcing its interpretation of a statutory\n\nprovision in the Texas Liquor Control Act. Id. at 893. At the time the declaratory\n\njudgment suit was filed, there were already two administrative license suspension\n\nproceedings pending against the plaintiffs involving their alleged violation of the\n\nsame statute. Id. at 894. The supreme court noted that, “As a general rule, an\n\naction for declaratory judgment will not be entertained if there is pending, at the\n\ntime it is filed, another action or proceeding between the same parties and in which\n\n                                          8\n\fmay be adjudicated the issues involved in the declaratory action.” Id. at 895. The\n\ncourt then concluded that “[i]n so far as plaintiffs are seeking a declaratory\n\njudgment for the purpose of overturning the administrative interpretation of the\n\nstatute so that no further proceedings will be instituted against them, we hold that\n\nthe facts of these cases do not warrant an exercise of jurisdiction.” Id. at 896.\n\n      The Fourteenth Court of Appeals has addressed the issue raised in Canyon\n\nCreek. See In re BP Oil Supply Co., 317 S.W.3d 915 (Tex. App—Houston [14th\n\nDist.] 2010, no pet.). In BP Oil, the dispute involved a contract between BP and\n\nConocoPhillips.    Id.   After an unsuccessful mediation, BP filed a breach-of-\n\ncontract action against ConocoPhillips in Delaware State court. Id. at 917–18.\n\nSeveral hours later on the same day, ConocoPhillips filed an action in Harris\n\nCounty seeking a declaratory judgment that it did not breach the contract involved.\n\nId. at 918. After determining that comity required that the Harris County court\n\ndefer to the earlier-filed Delaware court, the court noted that “ConocoPhillips’\n\nnon-liability declaratory judgment action is merely a mirror-image of the Delaware\n\nbreach-of-contract action[,]” and that “Texas public policy does not favor the\n\npursuit of a declaratory action when a previously filed liability action already\n\naddresses the same issues.” Id. at 921. ConocoPhillips, however, argued that\n\nMBM Financial controlled and that defensive declaratory judgments could be\n\nmaintained in breach-of-contract cases because there is no “real plaintiff,” thus no\n\n                                           9\n\fconcern about depriving a plaintiff of its chosen jurisdiction. Id. at 921–22. The\n\ncourt disagreed and distinguished MBM Financial by noting (1) that the case was\n\nnot one in which both parties were claiming breach-of-contract, thus BP, the only\n\nparty with claims for affirmative relief was the “real plaintiff,” and (2) that the\n\ndeclaratory judgment in MBM was not the mirror image of a first-filed breach-of-\n\ncontract case in another state.     Id. at 922.    The court concluded that “MBM\n\nFinancial does not displace the first-filed rule or the plaintiff’s choice of forum in\n\na breach-of-contract action when the second-filed declaratory-judgment action is a\n\nmirror image of the first-filed claim for affirmative relief.” Id.\n\n      This Court has also addressed the Canyon Creek issue. In Space Master\n\nInt’l, Inc. v. Porta-Kamp Mfg. Co., 794 S.W.2d 944, 948 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] 1990, no writ), a dispute arose between Space Master and Porta-Kamp\n\nManufacturing over two contracts that were to be performed in Massachusetts and\n\nNew Jersey. Id. at 945. Porta-Kamp sued Space Master for breach of contract in\n\nboth of those jurisdictions. Id. While the Massachusetts and New Jersey lawsuits\n\nwere pending, Space Master filed suit in Texas seeking a declaratory judgment that\n\nthe contracts at issue were usurious. Id. Porta-Kamp filed a motion to dismiss,\n\nwhich the trial court granted. Id. at 946. On appeal, Space Master argued that the\n\ntrial court had no authority to dismiss its suit for declaratory judgment, filed while\n\nproceedings involving the same parties and issues were pending in the other courts.\n\n                                          10\n\fId. Recognizing that declaratory judgment actions are neither legal nor equitable,\n\nbut instead, sui generis, this Court followed Canyon Creek, holding that a party\n\nshould not be allowed to use declaratory relief as a forum-shopping device where\n\nthe same parties and issues, i.e., breach-of-contract actions for money damages,\n\nwere pending in New Jersey state court and Massachusetts federal court, and where\n\nthe declaratory-judgment action alleged that those same contracts should not be\n\nenforced because of usurious interest rates. Id. at 948. Accordingly, this Court\n\nconcluded that the trial court did not err in dismissing Space Master’s suit for\n\ndeclaratory judgment and affirmed the trial court’s judgment. Id.\n\n      We conclude that this case is controlled by the holdings in Canyon Creek,\n\nBP Oil, and Space Master. Here, it is undisputed that, at the time Feldman filed\n\nsuit,1 there was a suit pending involving the same parties2 and the same issues in\n\nCanada.    Indeed, Feldman’s suit “seek[s] a declaration under the Uniform\n\nDeclaratory Judgments Act (“UDJA”) decreeing that neither Paul Ziff, Ziff\n\n\n1\n      Subject-matter jurisdiction is determined as of the date a suit is filed. See Grupo\n      Dataflux v. Atlas Global Group, L.P., 541 U.S. 567, 570, 124 S. Ct. 1920, 1924\n      (2004) (It has long been the case that “the jurisdiction of the court depends upon\n      the state of things at the time of the action brought.”)\n\n\n2\n      KPMG (US) is not a party to the suit in Canada, but the claims that Feldman\n      asserts against it are exactly the same claims as those asserted against KPMP\n      (Canada). Furthermore, Canyon Creek also involved an extra party in the\n      declaratory judgment that was not present in the ongoing administrative\n      proceedings. See Canyon Creek, 456 S.W.2d at 893.\n\n                                          11\n\fEnergy, Ziff Management nor KPMG can bring an action against [Feldman and his\n\nlaw firm] in a foreign country for claims that have long expired.” As in BP Oil, the\n\nZiffs are the “true plaintiffs” in the Canadian suit because they have claims for\n\naffirmative relief against KPMG (Canada).3 Feldman has no affirmative claim for\n\nrelief in either court, thus cannot be considered a “true plaintiff.” And, Feldman’s\n\ndeclaratory judgment is a “mirror image” of the claims being adjudicated in\n\nCanada. While the cross-claim against him in Canada seeks to hold him liable to\n\nKPMG (Canada) in the event that KPMG (Canada) is held liable to the Ziffs, the\n\ndeclaratory judgment seeks a decree that no such action will lie. To allow a\n\ndefensive declaratory judgment in this case, would not only deny the Ziffs their\n\nchoice of forum, it would force them to litigate in a jurisdiction chosen by a third-\n\nparty defendant against whom they have filed no claim for affirmative relief.\n\n      Further, even though the first-filed proceeding in this case was filed in\n\nCanada, and the cases in BP Oil and Space Master involved first-filed proceedings\n\nin other states, we see no reason to treat the cases differently. “Because Canada is\n\na sister common-law jurisdiction, American courts have consistently deferred to\n\nCanadian courts under the comity principle.” Caddel v. Clairton Corp., 105 B.R.\n\n366, 366 (N.D. Tex. 1989); see also Fleeger v. Clarkson Co., Ltd., 86 F.R.D. 388,\n\n\n3\n      And, as noted by the supreme court in MBM Financial, in a tort suit there is a true\n      plaintiff. 292 S.W.3d at 668. Here, the Ziffs are the true plaintiffs on their\n      professional liability tort claims.\n                                          12\n\f393 (N.D. Tex. 1980) (“Indeed, the Court is aware of no case in which an\n\nAmerican court has refused to defer to Canada.”). Although Feldman argues that\n\nthe Canadian court has no personal jurisdiction over him and the claims against\n\nhim in Canada have long since expired, he chose not to appear in Canada to assert\n\nthose defenses.\n\n      Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court did not err in\n\ndismissing Feldman’s claims for declaratory relief. We overrule Feldman’s first\n\nissue on appeal.\n\n                               ATTORNEY’S FEES\n\n      In his second issue on appeal, Feldman contends the trial court erred by\n\nawarding attorney’s fees to the Ziffs because (1) the trial court lacked jurisdiction\n\nto do so; (2) the fees were not equitable and just; (3) the trial court “pushed the jury\n\ntoward a fee award”; (4) Feldman was the prevailing party; and (5) the Ziffs failed\n\nto segregate their fees. We will address each argument respectively.\n\nApplicable Law\n\n      In “any proceeding” under the UDJA, “the court may award costs and\n\nreasonable and necessary attorney’s fees as are equitable and just.” TEX. CIV.\n\nPRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 37.009 (Vernon 2008). The UDJA “entrusts attorney\n\nfee awards to the trial court’s sound discretion, subject to the requirements that any\n\nfees awarded be reasonable and necessary, which are matters of fact, and to the\n\n                                          13\n\fadditional requirements that fees be equitable and just, which are matters of law.”\n\nBocquet v. Herring, 972 S.W.2d 19, 21 (Tex. 1998). “Unreasonable fees cannot be\n\nawarded, even if the court believed them just, but the court may conclude that it is\n\nnot equitable or just to award even reasonable and necessary fees.” Id. Further, the\n\naward of attorney’s fees is not dependent on a finding that the party “substantially\n\nprevailed.” Barshop v. Medina Cnty. Underground Water Conservation Dist., 925\n\nS.W.2d 618, 637 (Tex. 1996). Instead, a trial court may award attorney’s fees to a\n\nnon-prevailing party as are equitable and just. State Farm Lloyds v. C.M.W., 53\n\nS.W.3d 877, 894 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2001, pet. denied). Thus, the attorney’s fees\n\nprovision grants the trial court broad discretion to (i) afford all parties the\n\nopportunity to request fees; (ii) decline to award fees; and (iii) allow an award only\n\nwhen reasonable, necessary, equitable, and just.\n\nJurisdiction to Award Fees\n\n      Feldman argues that, by having the case dismissed for lack of jurisdiction\n\nand then seeking an award of attorney’s fees, the Ziffs have attempted “to game the\n\nsystem” and “have it both ways.” The Ziffs respond, arguing that trial courts have\n\nthe power to award attorney’s fees under Section 37.009 even when the trial court\n\nhas dismissed the plaintiff’s request for a declaratory relief for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nWe agree with the Ziffs.\n\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\f      Under section 37.009, a trial court may exercise its discretion to award\n\nattorneys’ fees to the prevailing party, the nonprevailing party, or neither.\n\nSee Barshop, 925 S.W.2d at 637 (award of attorneys’ fees in declaratory judgment\n\naction is not dependent on finding that party “substantially prevailed”). Moreover,\n\nthe statute does not require a judgment on the merits of the dispute as a prerequisite\n\nto a fee award. See Castro v. McNabb, 319 S.W.3d 721, 736 (Tex. App.—El Paso\n\n2009, no pet.) (“Our determination that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to render\n\nthe specific declarations sought does not change the nature of the proceedings\n\nbelow. Because this was a proceeding under the [UDJA], the trial court properly\n\nexercised jurisdiction under Section 37.009 to award attorney’s fees to\n\n[appellee].”); see also Zurita v. SVH-1Partners, Ltd., No. 03-10-00650-CV, 2011\n\nWL 6118573, *8 (Tex. App.—Austin Dec. 8, 2011, pet. denied) (not designated\n\nfor publication) (same).4 Thus, we conclude that the trial court had the power to\n\naward attorney’s fees under Section 37.009 even though it had dismissed\n\nFeldman’s claim for declaratory relief for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n4\n      Feldman relies on Utica Lloyd’s of Tex. v. Mitchell, 138 F.3d 208, 210 (5th Cir.\n      1998), in which the Court stated that “[a]lthough the [UDJA] expressly provides\n      for attorney’s fees, it functions solely as a procedural mechanism for resolving\n      substantive controversies which are already within the jurisdiction of the courts.”\n      However, Feldman cites this language out of context. The Fifth Circuit was not\n      deciding whether attorney’s fees were appropriate when a Texas state court\n      dismisses a declaratory judgment. Rather, it was holding that the UDJA was not\n      the “substantive law” of Texas, but rather, was procedural, and could not be used\n      as a basis for an award of attorney’s fees in a diversity case in federal court. See\n      id.\n                                           15\n\fEquitable and Just\n\n         Whether the awarded fees are “equitable and just” is a question of law.\n\nBocquet, 972 S.W.2d at 21. In a declaratory judgment case, we review a trial\n\ncourt’s award of attorney’s fees for an abuse of discretion. Id. It is an abuse of\n\ndiscretion for a trial court to rule arbitrarily, unreasonably, or without regard to\n\nguiding legal principles. Id .We must view the evidence in the light most favorable\n\nto the trial court’s ruling, indulging every presumption in its favor. Approach\n\nResources I, L.P. v. Clayton, 360 S.W.3d 632, 639 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2012, no\n\npet.).\n\n         Feldman argues that the trial court abused its discretion in holding that the\n\nattorney’s fees were equitable and just because “[t]he parties controlling the\n\nCanadian litigation manipulated the outcome of that suit [by settling and offering\n\nreleases] and were then allowed to come into the Harris County court and claim\n\nthere was no subject matter jurisdiction because the Canadian case was settled and,\n\ntherefore, there was no justiciable controversy to be decided in the declaratory\n\njudgment action.”       However, Feldman fails to acknowledge that the plea in\n\nabatement was also based on the pendency of the Canadian proceeding at the time\n\nthe declaratory judgment was filed, not merely because the Canadian suit\n\nsubsequently settled.\n\n\n\n\n                                           16\n\f      And, there were circumstances in this case that the court could have\n\ndetermined supported an equitable and just award of attorney’s fees to the Ziffs.\n\nFor example, the Ziffs filed their lawsuit against KPMG in Canada. The Ziffs\n\nnever asserted a claim against Feldman in the Canadian suit; Feldman was brought\n\ninto that suit as a third-party defendant by KPMG, not the Ziffs. Once KPMG\n\ncross-claimed against Feldman, rather than answer and defend the suit by asserting\n\na lack of personal jurisdiction in the Canadian court, Feldman chose to bring suit in\n\nTexas to avoid having to appear in Canada. In effect, Feldman sought to transfer\n\nthe case from the Ziffs’ chosen venue, even though the Ziffs never asserted a claim\n\nagainst him. Finally, when the Ziffs offered Feldman a release for a liability they\n\nhad never asserted against him, he refused to accept it unless they agreed to pay his\n\nattorney’s fees.   Accordingly, the trial court could have concluded that the\n\ndeclaratory judgment was an attempt at forum shopping by Feldman so that he\n\nwould not have to appear in Canada and could recover his attorney’s fees here in\n\nthe declaratory judgment action. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that\n\nthe trial court’s award of attorney’s fees to the Ziffs was an abuse of discretion.\n\nTrial Court “Pushed the Jury Toward a Fee Award”?\n\n      Before trial, the trial court instructed Feldman that the trial was only as to\n\nthe amount of attorney’s fees, not the Ziffs’ entitlement to fees. The trial court\n\nwarned Feldman to refrain from arguing that the Ziff were not entitled to the fees\n\n                                          17\n\fbecause the issue of the Ziffs’ entitlement to the fees was a matter of law for the\n\ncourt. The Court further warned Feldman that if he made such an argument, the\n\ncourt would have to instruct the jury that the Ziffs’ fees were recoverable.\n\n      However, when Feldman was being questioned as an expert witness on\n\nattorney’s fees, he was asked why he was there, and he responded as follows:\n\n      I’m here to—it’s a good question why I’m here today. This is like\n      man bites dog situation. I’m here to testify to attorney’s fees.\n      Offering an opinion on attorney’s fees that were incurred by the Ziff\n      parties. Even though we won the underlying litigation, even though\n      we’re vindicated in the underlying litigation.\n\nCounsel for the Ziffs objected, and the trial court sustained the objection, stating\n\n“[t]he objection is sustained, that’s not relevant . . . . The only issue is the amount\n\nof reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees, not whether or not they are\n\nrecoverable. They are recoverable for you to determine what is reasonable and\n\nnecessary.”    Thereafter, Feldman repeatedly attempted to argue that he had\n\n“prevailed” in the lawsuit and should not have to pay attorney’s fees, and each\n\ntime, the trial court sustained an objection to the relevancy of such testimony\n\ninstructed the jury to disregard it.\n\n      On appeal, appellant argues that the trial court’s rulings “improperly\n\nnudged” the jury toward an award of fees. Essentially, Feldman argues that the\n\ntrial court had prematurely determined that the fees were equitable and just and\n\nthat its rulings led the jury to believe that they must award some amount as\n\n                                          18\n\freasonable and just. However, Feldman cites no case to support his position that\n\nthe trial court’s “equitable and just” decision must be made after the jury\n\ndetermines an amount that is “reasonable and necessary.” The case Feldman relies\n\non, Ridge Oil Co., Inc. v. Guinn Investments, Inc., 148 S.W.3d 143, 162 (Tex.\n\n2004), merely holds that even after a jury determines an amount that is reasonable\n\nand necessary, the trial court has the authority to lower that amount because it is\n\nnot, as a matter of law, equitable and just. The trial court’s rulings correctly stated\n\nthat the issue of whether Feldman was a “prevailing party” was irrelevant because\n\nthat goes to whether the award is “equitable and just,” which is a legal issue and\n\nnot for the jury’s consideration. See Bocquet, 972 S.W.2d at 21. Furthermore, the\n\ntrial court’s statements to the jury were made after the trial court warned Feldman\n\nnot to get into the issue of whether he was a prevailing party. As such, we cannot\n\nagree that the trial court’s statements to the jury nudged it toward finding\n\nreasonable and necessary fees.\n\nPrevailing Party\n\n      Feldman also argues that he was the “prevailing party” in the declaratory\n\njudgment action because, by filing the suit, he obtained releases from both the Ziffs\n\nand KPMG. We disagree. Feldman did not obtain any of the declaratory relief he\n\nrequested; he was not a prevailing party. Indeed, the Ziffs and KPMG “prevailed”\n\nbecause they successfully had Feldman’s claims dismissed. In any event, an award\n\n                                          19\n\fof attorney’s fees is not dependent on a finding that the party “substantially\n\nprevailed.” Barshop, 925 S.W.2d at 637. Thus, the trial court had the discretion to\n\naward fees to the Ziffs even if they were not a “prevailing party.”\n\nFailure to Segregate Fees\n\n      Finally, Feldman argues that the Ziffs failed to segregate their fees “between\n\nthose legal services performed in defending against the declaratory judgment\n\naction and those services that merely furthered the position of the Ziff entities.”\n\nHowever, there was evidence from the Ziffs’ attorney that, “One hundred percent\n\nof our time on this case was responding to this case alone. That was it. We didn’t\n\nrepresent anybody else, we didn’t work on anybody else’s claims.”\n\n      In Lindley v. McKnight, 349 S.W.3d 113, 136 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth\n\n2011, no pet.), the plaintiff argued that the defendant was not entitled to recover\n\nattorney’s fees related to their unsuccessful motions to transfer venue that they had\n\nfiled in the declaratory judgment action. In refusing to require the defendant to\n\nsegregate out those portions of the fees it noted that all of the services provided by\n\nthe defendant’s attorney were incidental to its defense of the plaintiff’s declaratory\n\njudgment claim even if the service did not affect the ultimate resolution of the\n\nclaim. Id. The same is true here. Thus, no segregation of fees was required.\n\n      Having disposed of each issue related to the trial court’s award of attorney’s\n\nfees to the Ziffs, we overrule Feldman’s second issue on appeal.\n\n                                         20\n\f                                CONCLUSION\n\n      We affirm the trial court’s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                              Sherry Radack\n                                              Chief Justice\n\nPanel consists of Chief Justice Radack and Justices Massengale and Huddle.\n\n\n\n\n                                        21\n\f",

We affirm.\n\n                                BACKGROUND\n\n      In 2011, Paul Ziff, Ziff Energy Group, Ltd., and Ziff Energy Management\n\nCorporation [collectively, “the Ziffs”] filed suit against KPMG, LLP (Canada) in a\n\nCanadian court alleging accounting malpractice and professional liability.       In\n\nAugust 2011, KPMG (Canada) then filed a third-party claim against Feldman and\n\nthe Feldman Law firm [collectively, “Feldman”] seeking indemnity and\n\ncontribution in the event that KPMG (Canada) was held liable to the Ziffs.\n\nFeldman failed to appear and KPMG (Canada) obtained a default judgment against\n\nFeldman in September 2011.\n\n      In October 2011, after he was already in default in the Canadian court,\n\nFeldman filed a suit against KPMG (Canada), its U.S. counterpart, KPMG, LLP\n\n[collectively, “KPMG” unless specified as KPMG (Canada)] and the Ziffs.\n\nSpecifically, Feldman sought a declaratory judgment “under the Uniform\n\nDeclaratory Judgments Act (“UDHA”) decreeing that neither Paul Ziff, Ziff\n\nEnergy, Ziff Management, nor [KPMG] can bring an action against [him] in a\n\nforeign country for claims that have long expired.”\n\n      KPMG answered, asserted a compulsory counterclaim against Feldman, and\n\nrequested the trial court to dismiss the suit “because a declaratory judgment is not\n\n                                         2\n\favailable to resolve an issue when another action is pending that will adjudicate the\n\nsame issue between the parties.” The Ziffs also answered and filed a plea to the\n\njurisdiction, asserting, among other reasons, that the declaratory judgment should\n\nbe dismissed because of the pending suit in Canada.\n\n         Thereafter, Ziff settled its Canadian claims against KPMG (Canada) in\n\nJanuary 2012. Nevertheless, Feldman continued to pursue discovery in the Harris\n\nCounty case “to ensure that the Plaintiffs are out of this matter once and for all and\n\nto recover their costs.” The Ziffs then offered Feldman a mutual release, which\n\nFeldman declined, continuing to pursue discovery. Feldman was not interested in\n\na mutual release in which each party would incur its own costs. Rather, he wanted\n\na “full release from liability, after which the parties could discuss costs incurred to\n\ndate.”\n\n         In January 2012, KPMG (Canada) filed a notice of nonsuit as to its\n\ncounterclaims against Feldman in the Harris County case. The nonsuit stated that\n\nthe counterclaim was moot “as a result of a settlement reached in the underlying\n\nCalgary litigation.” An exhibit attached to the non-suit was a “Discontinuance” of\n\nthe third-party claim against Feldman in Canada. Soon thereafter, the Ziffs sent\n\nFeldman both a mutual release, which Feldman again refused to sign, and a\n\nunilateral release.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f      Thereafter, the trial court granted the plea to the jurisdiction and dismissed\n\nFeldman’s claims on February 28, 2012.\n\n      On March 9, 2012, the Ziffs filed a motion to modify the judgment to\n\ninclude their attorney’s fees and costs. On April 18, 2012, the trial court denied\n\nthe Ziffs’ motion to modify, but instead, reinstated the case in part and set the case\n\nfor trial on the issue of the Ziffs’ request for attorney’s fees under the UDJA.\n\n      After a jury trial, the court entered a final judgment in which it “ORDERED,\n\nADJUDGED, AND DECREED that it is both equitable and just that the Ziff\n\nDefendants recover their reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees from the\n\nPlaintiffs under the Declaratory Judgment Act.” Based on the jury verdict, the\n\njudgment also awarded the Ziffs $36,952 in attorney’s fees, post-judgment interest,\n\nplus contingent amounts available in the event of post-judgment appeals. This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n      PROPRIETY OF DISMISSAL FOR WANT OF JURISDICTION\n\nStandard of Review\n\n      A plea to the jurisdiction challenges a trial court’s authority to decide the\n\nsubject matter of a specific cause of action.

See Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228; Hendee, 228\n\nS.W.3d at 367. But if the challenged jurisdictional fact does not overlap the merits,\n\nthe fact issue may be resolved by the trial court when resolving the jurisdictional\n\nissue, and its explicit or implicit fact finding (or failure-to-find) may be challenged\n\nin the same manner as fact findings generally.

MBM Financial, however, is distinguishable\n\nbecause the Canadian suit appears to be a claim for professional malpractice, i.e., a\n\ntort claim. Under most circumstances, Texas courts should decline to exercise\n\njurisdiction in a case seeking a declaration of non-liability in a tort suit because to\n\ndo so deprives the potential plaintiff of the right to determine where and when to\n\nfile suit. See MBM Financial, 292 S.W.3d at 668; Abor v.

The issue presented here, however, is whether a declaratory\n\njudgment may be used to assert a claim of non-liability in a contract case when\n\nthere is already a breach-of-contract case pending in another court. As such, this\n\ncase is distinguishable from MBM Financial, in which the plaintiff filed a breach-\n\nof-contract case and, in the same suit, requested a declaration of non-liability to the\n\ndefendant. 292 S.W.3d at 663. The Supreme Court held that a declaration of non-\n\nliability was an appropriate subject of a declaratory judgment in a contract case, as\n\n                                          7\n\fopposed to a tort case, because both parties suffer when a contract collapses and\n\nthere is no “real plaintiff” necessarily deserving of the right to choose the\n\njurisdiction. Id. at 668. However, the plaintiff could not recover attorney’s fees\n\nwhen it had failed to recover damages on its breach-of-contract claim. Id. at 669–\n\n70. There was no previously filed breach-of-contract lawsuit in MBM Financial;\n\nmerely a declaratory judgment request that was “tacked on” to the plaintiff’s own\n\nbreach-of-contract suit. As such, MBM Financial does not resolve the issue of\n\nwhether a district court should exercise jurisdiction over a declaratory judgment\n\naction requesting a declaration of non-liability in a contract case when a breach-of-\n\ncontract case is already pending in another court.\n\n      The Ziffs and KPMG contend that this case is controlled by Texas Liquor\n\nControl Board v.

In\n\nCanyon Creek, the plaintiffs filed a declaratory judgment seeking to prevent the\n\nTexas Liquor Control Board from enforcing its interpretation of a statutory\n\nprovision in the Texas Liquor Control Act. Id. at 893. At the time the declaratory\n\njudgment suit was filed, there were already two administrative license suspension\n\nproceedings pending against the plaintiffs involving their alleged violation of the\n\nsame statute. Id. at 894. The supreme court noted that, “As a general rule, an\n\naction for declaratory judgment will not be entertained if there is pending, at the\n\ntime it is filed, another action or proceeding between the same parties and in which\n\n                                          8\n\fmay be adjudicated the issues involved in the declaratory action.” Id. at 895. The\n\ncourt then concluded that “[i]n so far as plaintiffs are seeking a declaratory\n\njudgment for the purpose of overturning the administrative interpretation of the\n\nstatute so that no further proceedings will be instituted against them, we hold that\n\nthe facts of these cases do not warrant an exercise of jurisdiction.” Id. at 896.\n\n      The Fourteenth Court of Appeals has addressed the issue raised in Canyon\n\nCreek.

After an unsuccessful mediation, BP filed a breach-of-\n\ncontract action against ConocoPhillips in Delaware State court. Id. at 917–18.\n\nSeveral hours later on the same day, ConocoPhillips filed an action in Harris\n\nCounty seeking a declaratory judgment that it did not breach the contract involved.\n\nId. at 918. After determining that comity required that the Harris County court\n\ndefer to the earlier-filed Delaware court, the court noted that “ConocoPhillips’\n\nnon-liability declaratory judgment action is merely a mirror-image of the Delaware\n\nbreach-of-contract action[,]” and that “Texas public policy does not favor the\n\npursuit of a declaratory action when a previously filed liability action already\n\naddresses the same issues.” Id. at 921. ConocoPhillips, however, argued that\n\nMBM Financial controlled and that defensive declaratory judgments could be\n\nmaintained in breach-of-contract cases because there is no “real plaintiff,” thus no\n\n                                           9\n\fconcern about depriving a plaintiff of its chosen jurisdiction. Id. at 921–22. The\n\ncourt disagreed and distinguished MBM Financial by noting (1) that the case was\n\nnot one in which both parties were claiming breach-of-contract, thus BP, the only\n\nparty with claims for affirmative relief was the “real plaintiff,” and (2) that the\n\ndeclaratory judgment in MBM was not the mirror image of a first-filed breach-of-\n\ncontract case in another state.     Id. at 922.    The court concluded that “MBM\n\nFinancial does not displace the first-filed rule or the plaintiff’s choice of forum in\n\na breach-of-contract action when the second-filed declaratory-judgment action is a\n\nmirror image of the first-filed claim for affirmative relief.” Id.\n\n      This Court has also addressed the Canyon Creek issue.

Id. at 945. Porta-Kamp sued Space Master for breach of contract in\n\nboth of those jurisdictions. Id. While the Massachusetts and New Jersey lawsuits\n\nwere pending, Space Master filed suit in Texas seeking a declaratory judgment that\n\nthe contracts at issue were usurious. Id. Porta-Kamp filed a motion to dismiss,\n\nwhich the trial court granted. Id. at 946. On appeal, Space Master argued that the\n\ntrial court had no authority to dismiss its suit for declaratory judgment, filed while\n\nproceedings involving the same parties and issues were pending in the other courts.\n\n                                          10\n\fId. Recognizing that declaratory judgment actions are neither legal nor equitable,\n\nbut instead, sui generis, this Court followed Canyon Creek, holding that a party\n\nshould not be allowed to use declaratory relief as a forum-shopping device where\n\nthe same parties and issues, i.e., breach-of-contract actions for money damages,\n\nwere pending in New Jersey state court and Massachusetts federal court, and where\n\nthe declaratory-judgment action alleged that those same contracts should not be\n\nenforced because of usurious interest rates. Id. at 948. Accordingly, this Court\n\nconcluded that the trial court did not err in dismissing Space Master’s suit for\n\ndeclaratory judgment and affirmed the trial court’s judgment. Id.\n\n      We conclude that this case is controlled by the holdings in Canyon Creek,\n\nBP Oil, and Space Master.

Furthermore, Canyon Creek also involved an extra party in the\n      declaratory judgment that was not present in the ongoing administrative\n      proceedings.

While the cross-claim against him in Canada seeks to hold him liable to\n\nKPMG (Canada) in the event that KPMG (Canada) is held liable to the Ziffs, the\n\ndeclaratory judgment seeks a decree that no such action will lie.

The Fifth Circuit was not\n      deciding whether attorney’s fees were appropriate when a Texas state court\n      dismisses a declaratory judgment. Rather, it was holding that the UDJA was not\n      the “substantive law” of Texas, but rather, was procedural, and could not be used\n      as a basis for an award of attorney’s fees in a diversity case in federal court.

It is an abuse of\n\ndiscretion for a trial court to rule arbitrarily, unreasonably, or without regard to\n\nguiding legal principles. Id .We must view the evidence in the light most favorable\n\nto the trial court’s ruling, indulging every presumption in its favor. Approach\n\nResources I, L.P. v. Clayton, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">360</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 639 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2012, no\n\npet.).\n\n         Feldman argues that the trial court abused its discretion in holding that the\n\nattorney’s fees were equitable and just because “[t]he parties controlling the\n\nCanadian litigation manipulated the outcome of that suit [by settling and offering\n\nreleases] and were then allowed to come into the Harris County court and claim\n\nthere was no subject matter jurisdiction because the Canadian case was settled and,\n\ntherefore, there was no justiciable controversy to be decided in the declaratory\n\njudgment action.”       However, Feldman fails to acknowledge that the plea in\n\nabatement was also based on the pendency of the Canadian proceeding at the time\n\nthe declaratory judgment was filed, not merely because the Canadian suit\n\nsubsequently settled.\n\n\n\n\n                                           16\n\f      And, there were circumstances in this case that the court could have\n\ndetermined supported an equitable and just award of attorney’s fees to the Ziffs.\n\nFor example, the Ziffs filed their lawsuit against KPMG in Canada. The Ziffs\n\nnever asserted a claim against Feldman in the Canadian suit; Feldman was brought\n\ninto that suit as a third-party defendant by KPMG, not the Ziffs. Once KPMG\n\ncross-claimed against Feldman, rather than answer and defend the suit by asserting\n\na lack of personal jurisdiction in the Canadian court, Feldman chose to bring suit in\n\nTexas to avoid having to appear in Canada. In effect, Feldman sought to transfer\n\nthe case from the Ziffs’ chosen venue, even though the Ziffs never asserted a claim\n\nagainst him. Finally, when the Ziffs offered Feldman a release for a liability they\n\nhad never asserted against him, he refused to accept it unless they agreed to pay his\n\nattorney’s fees.   Accordingly, the trial court could have concluded that the\n\ndeclaratory judgment was an attempt at forum shopping by Feldman so that he\n\nwould not have to appear in Canada and could recover his attorney’s fees here in\n\nthe declaratory judgment action. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that\n\nthe trial court’s award of attorney’s fees to the Ziffs was an abuse of discretion.\n\nTrial Court “Pushed the Jury Toward a Fee Award”?\n\n      Before trial, the trial court instructed Feldman that the trial was only as to\n\nthe amount of attorney’s fees, not the Ziffs’ entitlement to fees. The trial court\n\nwarned Feldman to refrain from arguing that the Ziff were not entitled to the fees\n\n                                          17\n\fbecause the issue of the Ziffs’ entitlement to the fees was a matter of law for the\n\ncourt. The Court further warned Feldman that if he made such an argument, the\n\ncourt would have to instruct the jury that the Ziffs’ fees were recoverable.\n\n      However, when Feldman was being questioned as an expert witness on\n\nattorney’s fees, he was asked why he was there, and he responded as follows:\n\n      I’m here to—it’s a good question why I’m here today. This is like\n      man bites dog situation. I’m here to testify to attorney’s fees.\n      Offering an opinion on attorney’s fees that were incurred by the Ziff\n      parties. Even though we won the underlying litigation, even though\n      we’re vindicated in the underlying litigation.\n\nCounsel for the Ziffs objected, and the trial court sustained the objection, stating\n\n“[t]he objection is sustained, that’s not relevant . . . . The only issue is the amount\n\nof reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees, not whether or not they are\n\nrecoverable. They are recoverable for you to determine what is reasonable and\n\nnecessary.”    Thereafter, Feldman repeatedly attempted to argue that he had\n\n“prevailed” in the lawsuit and should not have to pay attorney’s fees, and each\n\ntime, the trial court sustained an objection to the relevancy of such testimony\n\ninstructed the jury to disregard it.\n\n      On appeal, appellant argues that the trial court’s rulings “improperly\n\nnudged” the jury toward an award of fees. Essentially, Feldman argues that the\n\ntrial court had prematurely determined that the fees were equitable and just and\n\nthat its rulings led the jury to believe that they must award some amount as\n\n                                          18\n\freasonable and just. However, Feldman cites no case to support his position that\n\nthe trial court’s “equitable and just” decision must be made after the jury\n\ndetermines an amount that is “reasonable and necessary.” The case Feldman relies\n\non, Ridge Oil Co., Inc. v.

The trial court’s rulings correctly stated\n\nthat the issue of whether Feldman was a “prevailing party” was irrelevant because\n\nthat goes to whether the award is “equitable and just,” which is a legal issue and\n\nnot for the jury’s consideration. See Bocquet, 972 S.W.2d at 21. Furthermore, the\n\ntrial court’s statements to the jury were made after the trial court warned Feldman\n\nnot to get into the issue of whether he was a prevailing party. As such, we cannot\n\nagree that the trial court’s statements to the jury nudged it toward finding\n\nreasonable and necessary fees.\n\nPrevailing Party\n\n      Feldman also argues that he was the “prevailing party” in the declaratory\n\njudgment action because, by filing the suit, he obtained releases from both the Ziffs\n\nand KPMG. We disagree. Feldman did not obtain any of the declaratory relief he\n\nrequested; he was not a prevailing party. Indeed, the Ziffs and KPMG “prevailed”\n\nbecause they successfully had Feldman’s claims dismissed. In any event, an award\n\n                                          19\n\fof attorney’s fees is not dependent on a finding that the party “substantially\n\nprevailed.” Barshop, 925 S.W.2d at 637. Thus, the trial court had the discretion to\n\naward fees to the Ziffs even if they were not a “prevailing party.”\n\nFailure to Segregate Fees\n\n      Finally, Feldman argues that the Ziffs failed to segregate their fees “between\n\nthose legal services performed in defending against the declaratory judgment\n\naction and those services that merely furthered the position of the Ziff entities.”\n\nHowever, there was evidence from the Ziffs’ attorney that, “One hundred percent\n\nof our time on this case was responding to this case alone. That was it. We didn’t\n\nrepresent anybody else, we didn’t work on anybody else’s claims.”\n\n      In Lindley v.

In refusing to require the defendant to\n\nsegregate out those portions of the fees it noted that all of the services provided by\n\nthe defendant’s attorney were incidental to its defense of the plaintiff’s declaratory\n\njudgment claim even if the service did not affect the ultimate resolution of the\n\nclaim. Id. The same is true here. Thus, no segregation of fees was required.\n\n      Having disposed of each issue related to the trial court’s award of attorney’s\n\nfees to the Ziffs, we overrule Feldman’s second issue on appeal.\n\n                                         20\n\f                                CONCLUSION\n\n      We affirm the trial court’s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                              Sherry Radack\n                                              Chief Justice\n\nPanel consists of Chief Justice Radack and Justices Massengale and Huddle.\n\n\n\n\n                                        21\n\f</pre>",
