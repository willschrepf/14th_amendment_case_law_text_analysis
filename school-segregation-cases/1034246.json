These appeals arise out of a dispute\nbetween two specialty food businesses regarding the\nscope of their obligations under a distribution\nagreement and the legal effect of oral promises regard-\ning the formation of a joint venture between the busi-\nnesses. The plaintiffs, Randall Weiss and his company,\nGourmet and Specialty Food Works, LLC (Food Works),\ncommenced this action against the defendants, Michael\nD. Smulders and his company, Garden of Light Natural\nFood Markets, Inc. (Garden of Light), seeking to recover\nmoney damages for, inter alia, breach of an oral contract\nand promissory estoppel for failing to form the joint\nventure. The defendants filed counterclaims asserting,\ninter alia, that the plaintiffs had breached the parties’\nwritten contract by failing to pay for goods purchased.\nFollowing a bench trial, the court rendered judgment\nfor the plaintiffs on their promissory estoppel claim\nagainst Smulders, but awarded limited damages on the\nground that the plaintiffs had not proved the value of\ntheir share of the new venture to a reasonable certainty,\nand rendered judgment for the defendants on their\nbreach of contract counterclaim. The plaintiffs and the\ndefendants filed separate appeals from the judgment.1\nIn their appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court\nimproperly: (1) found that the evidence adduced at trial\nwas insufficient to establish their damages with reason-\nable certainty; (2) reversed its decision to hold a post-\ntrial evidentiary hearing to allow the plaintiffs to present\nfurther evidence regarding damages; and (3) rendered\njudgment for the defendants on their breach of contract\ncounterclaim because the defendants had committed\nprior material breaches. In their appeal, the defendants\nclaim that the court improperly rendered judgment for\nthe plaintiffs on their promissory estoppel claim\nbecause: (1) the plaintiffs lacked standing in light of\nWeiss’ bankruptcy filing; and (2) that claim contradicts\nthe fully integrated distribution agreement. We affirm\nthe judgment of the trial court in all respects.\n   The trial court reasonably could have found the fol-\nlowing facts.2 Smulders and Weiss had their first busi-\nness interaction in 2001. At that time, Smulders was\nthe president and sole shareholder of Garden of Light,\na company that owned and operated two natural foods\ngrocery stores in Avon and Glastonbury and a bakery\nthat produced natural granola products sold in those\nstores. Weiss was the owner and operator of Aegean\nInternational, an olive oil and balsamic vinegar distribu-\ntion and marketing company. The business relationship\nbetween the two men began when Weiss approached\nSmulders about selling his olive oil in Garden of Light’s\nGlastonbury store. Smulders agreed, and due to suc-\ncessful sales, Smulders continued to purchase olive oil\nfrom Weiss.\n  In the late spring or early summer of 2003, while\n\fWeiss was visiting the Garden of Light grocery store,\nSmulders asked Weiss if he thought that Garden of\nLight’s granola could be packaged for wholesale distri-\nbution. At that time, the granola products were being\nsold only in the two Garden of Light grocery stores,\nand were packed in a plastic bag bearing a plain black\nand white ‘‘scale’’ label. Weiss responded that, if prop-\nerly packaged, the product potentially could do well.\nSmulders acknowledged that he did not have any whole-\nsale marketing experience. He further indicated to\nWeiss that he would need Weiss’ assistance in this area\nand that he had approached Weiss because of Weiss’\nolive oil marketing campaign. As a result of this conver-\nsation, the interest of both parties was piqued, and\nthey had numerous subsequent conversations in the\nlate spring or early summer of 2003, in which they\nagreed to work to distribute the granola products.\n  In or around August, 2003, the parties discussed\nworking together as two separate companies to produce\nand distribute the granola products. Smulders also indi-\ncated that they would merge their companies to form\na new enterprise if that relationship proved successful.\nShortly thereafter, Weiss formed Food Works to distrib-\nute Garden of Light’s granola products. In December,\n2003, Garden of Light and Food Works executed a writ-\nten ‘‘Master Distributorship Agreement’’ (distribution\nagreement), the purpose of which was to designate\nFood Works the exclusive distributor of granola prod-\nucts produced by Garden of Light. The distribution\nagreement expressly acknowledged that the parties had\nentered into discussions with respect to the formation\nof a new company. Subsequent to the execution of the\ndistribution agreement and until approximately the time\ntheir relationship ended in 2006, Smulders made\nrepeated representations to Weiss that he would spin\noff his bakery business from Garden of Light, merge it\nwith Food Works, and that he and Weiss would be equal\npartners in the new company, which they referred to\nas ‘‘NEWCO.’’\n   In the period that followed the execution of the distri-\nbution agreement, Weiss wound down his olive oil busi-\nness to focus primarily on the granola products\nbusiness, expending many hours on marketing and\nresearch. Weiss also paid a brand manager $14,000 to\npromote that business. At some point during this period,\nWeiss and Smulders began labeling the granola prod-\nucts with the trade name Bakery on Main. While Food\nWorks purchased and distributed Garden of Light’s gra-\nnola products, Weiss and Smulders continued to main-\ntain their separate companies.\n  In September, 2006, Smulders sent an e-mail to Weiss,\ninforming Weiss that he would not merge companies. At\nthe same time, Smulders sent a letter to Weiss, asserting\nthat Food Works was not in compliance with the distri-\nbution agreement because it had failed to compensate\n\fGarden of Light for products that had been purchased\nfor distribution. As required by the distribution\nagreement, Smulders, acting on behalf of Garden of\nLight, gave Food Works thirty days to cure the breach.\nThereafter, Garden of Light continued to fulfill Food\nWorks’ orders, as it was bound to do under the distribu-\ntion agreement, and Food Works’ debt continued to\naccumulate. After Food Works failed to make full pay-\nment within the thirty day period, Garden of Light for-\nmally terminated the distribution agreement.\n   The record reveals the following procedural history.\nThe plaintiffs commenced this action against the defen-\ndants, alleging in the operative complaint: breach of\noral contract and promissory estoppel as to Smulders;\nbreach of written contract as to Garden of Light; and\nnegligent misrepresentation, intentional misrepresenta-\ntion, and unjust enrichment as to both defendants. The\ndefendants asserted various special defenses and two\ncounterclaims against the plaintiffs, alleging breach of\ncontract and fraudulent misrepresentation.3\n  After the close of evidence, the defendants moved to\ndismiss the plaintiffs’ breach of oral contract count\nin its entirety and portions of the remaining counts,\nincluding the promissory estoppel count, claiming that,\nbecause Weiss had filed for bankruptcy protection sub-\nsequent to the occurrence of some of the events that\nconstituted the claims, those claims belonged to Weiss’\nbankruptcy estate, not to the plaintiffs. The trial court\ndenied the motion, determining with respect to the\npromissory estoppel claim that this claim had not fully\naccrued in December, 2003, when Weiss filed his bank-\nruptcy petition. In reliance on this finding, the court\nconcluded that the plaintiffs, rather than the bankruptcy\ntrustee, had standing to pursue the claim.\n   Thereafter, the court found in favor of the defendants\non all of the plaintiffs’ claims except promissory estop-\npel.4 With respect to that claim, the court found that\nthe plaintiffs had met their burden of establishing that\nSmulders made promises regarding an eventual merger\nof their two companies and that Weiss acted in reliance\non those promises to his detriment. With respect to\nthe defendants’ counterclaims, the court found that the\ndefendants had met their burden of establishing that\nthe plaintiffs breached the distribution agreement by\nfailing to compensate Garden of Light for products that\nthe plaintiffs had purchased for distribution, but found\nin favor of the plaintiffs on the defendants’ claim of\nfraudulent misrepresentation.5\n  With respect to damages, the court awarded the\ndefendants $110,463.50 in principal and interest for the\nplaintiffs’ breach of the distribution agreement. As to\nthe plaintiffs’ damages for promissory estoppel, the\ncourt found that they were entitled to be compensated\nas if the companies had merged as promised and for\ncosts expended on the venture that never came to be.\n\fWith respect to the latter, the court found that Weiss\nwas entitled to one half of the $14,000 that he had paid\nto the brand manager to promote the granola products,\nas he would have benefited from one half of those\nservices as a partner in NEWCO. The court also found\nthat Weiss was entitled to the value of a 50 percent\nshare of NEWCO, but that neither party had offered\nsufficient evidence to demonstrate the value of\nNEWCO. In light of this deficiency, the court deter-\nmined that further evidence of NEWCO’s value was\nnecessary and ordered the parties to return to court to\npresent additional evidence on that issue. Subsequently,\nthe defendants moved to reargue the court’s decision\nto hold the additional hearing, and the plaintiffs moved\nfor reconsideration of the court’s decision that the plain-\ntiffs had failed to present sufficient evidence of\nNEWCO’s value. The trial court granted the defendants’\nmotion, reversing its decision to allow the parties to\nintroduce additional evidence on damages, and denied\nthe plaintiffs’ motion. Thereafter, the plaintiffs and the\ndefendants filed appeals. Additional facts and proce-\ndural history will be set forth as necessary.\n                             I\n  All of the parties raise claims challenging the trial\ncourt’s judgment with respect to the plaintiffs’ promis-\nsory estoppel claim—the defendants on the merits and\nthe plaintiffs on damages. The defendants contend that\nthe plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue the promissory\nestoppel claim because the bankruptcy trustee\nappointed to oversee Weiss’ bankruptcy estate had\nexclusive standing to pursue the claim. The defendants\nfurther contend that, even if the plaintiffs had standing,\nthe court improperly allowed the plaintiffs to recover\non this claim because it contradicted the fully integrated\ndistribution agreement. The plaintiffs dispute both of\nthese contentions and argue with respect to damages\nthat the trial court improperly found that the evidence\nadduced at trial was insufficient to establish the value\nof NEWCO to a reasonable certainty, and improperly\nreversed its decision to hold a posttrial evidentiary hear-\ning on damages. We conclude that the plaintiffs had\nstanding to bring their promissory estoppel claim and\nwere not precluded by the terms of the distribution\nagreement from advancing this claim. Nevertheless, we\nconclude that the trial court properly determined that\nthe plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of proving\ntheir damages with reasonable certainty and properly\ndeclined to allow the plaintiffs to present further evi-\ndence posttrial.\n                            A\n   We first turn to the defendants’ challenge to the plain-\ntiffs’ standing to bring their promissory estoppel claim\nbecause that issue implicates the trial court’s subject\nmatter jurisdiction. Because of the jurisdictional nature\nof the claim, it presents a threshold issue that must be\n\fresolved before any determination of the merits. New\nHartford v. Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority,\n291 Conn. 511, 518, 970 A.2d 583 (2009). The defendants\nargue that the roots of the plaintiffs’ promissory estop-\npel claim arose from prebankruptcy activity. Accord-\ningly, the defendants contend that any cause of action\nbased on a claim of promissory estoppel was property\nbelonging to the bankruptcy estate, and thus the bank-\nruptcy trustee had exclusive standing to pursue that\nclaim. In response, the plaintiffs argue that the trial\ncourt properly determined that the date on which the\nclaim accrues controls, and because the promissory\nestoppel claim accrued after the bankruptcy petition\nwas filed, the claim was the property of Weiss, not the\nbankruptcy estate. The plaintiffs further contend that,\neven if this court were to apply the test that the defen-\ndants advocate, the plaintiffs still would have had stand-\ning under the proper application of that test.6 We agree\nwith the plaintiffs that they had standing irrespective\nof which test applies.\n   The following additional facts found by the trial court\nand procedural history are relevant to this issue.\nBetween 2003 and 2006, Smulders made several prom-\nises to Weiss that they would merge Food Works with\nthe Bakery on Main part of Garden of Light to form the\nnew enterprise known as NEWCO, and that Smulders\nand Weiss would be equal partners. These promises\nwere made in e-mails sent from Smulders to Weiss dated\nAugust 23, 2003, October 28, 2004, and March 17, 2006,\nand in a memorandum authored by Smulders in 2005,\nthat specifically referenced how and when the two com-\npanies would merge into NEWCO.7 Consistent with\nthese promises, Smulders referred to Weiss as his part-\nner on numerous occasions, including in an e-mail to\na potential customer dated April 24, 2005, and in a\nSeptember, 2005 presentation in which he identified\nhimself and Weiss as ‘‘Managing Partners.’’ Until Smuld-\ners renounced his intention to merge the companies in\nSeptember, 2006, Weiss acted in reliance on the prom-\nises to merge the two companies by abandoning his\nolive oil business, spending hundreds of hours on mar-\nketing and research that was not required of him under\nthe distribution agreement, and working to improve\nboth his and Smulders’ businesses.\n   During the period when Weiss was working toward\nthe goal of merging the companies, however, he filed\na voluntary chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in the United\nStates Bankruptcy Court for the District of Connecticut.\nSpecifically, Weiss filed the petition on December 5,\n2003, after Smulders had made his initial promise to\nWeiss, but before the parties had executed the distribu-\ntion agreement and well before Smulders had repudi-\nated the promised merger of the companies. Weiss did\nnot list the distribution agreement or his interest in\nNEWCO in his bankruptcy petition.\n\f   In considering the standing issue raised in this case,\nan issue over which we exercise plenary review; Wilcox\nv. Webster Ins., Inc., 294 Conn. 206, 213–14, 982 A.2d\n1053 (2009); we first are guided by certain fundamental\nprinciples of bankruptcy law. When a debtor files for\nbankruptcy protection, a bankruptcy estate is created.\nCharts v. Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., 300 B.R. 552,\n556–57 (Bankr. D. Conn. 2003). Title 11 of the United\nStates Code, § 541, prescribes the property interests of\nthe debtor that comprise the bankruptcy estate. Subject\nto a few exceptions, such property is defined as ‘‘all\nlegal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as\nof the commencement of the case.’’8 (Emphasis added.)\n11 U.S.C. § 541 (a) (1) (2012). It is well settled that such\nproperty includes causes of action possessed by the\ndebtor at that time. See, e.g., In re Crysen/Montenay\nEnergy Co., 902 F.2d 1098, 1101 (2d Cir. 1990); In re\nCottrell, 876 F.2d 540, 542–43 (6th Cir. 1989); Sierra\nSwitchboard Co. v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., 789\nF.2d 705, 707–709 (9th Cir. 1986). A bankruptcy debtor\ndoes not have standing to pursue claims that constitute\nproperty of a bankruptcy estate. Tilley v. Anixter, Inc.,\n332 B.R. 501, 507 (Bankr. D. Conn. 2005); see Seward\nv. Devine, 888 F.2d 957, 963 (2d Cir. 1989).\n    Thus, the ultimate question is whether a cause of\naction that was instituted postpetition constitutes the\nproperty of the debtor at the time the bankruptcy case\nhas commenced, namely, by the filing of the petition.\nThe federal courts are split on the proper approach to\nresolve this question. Some courts, relying on Butner\nv. United States, 440 U.S. 48, 99 S. Ct. 914, 59 L. Ed.\n2d 136 (1979),9 have determined that applicable state\nlaw determines when a cause of action accrues and\ntherefore consider that date in relation to the date on\nwhich the petition was filed. See, e.g., In re Witko, 374\nF.3d 1040, 1043 (11th Cir. 2004) (applying state law to\ndetermine whether legal malpractice cause of action\nhad accrued at time debtor filed bankruptcy petition);\nIn re Segerstrom, 247 F.3d 218, 224 (5th Cir. 2001) (‘‘[a]\ndebtor’s pre-petition rights in property, such as a cause\nof action, are determined according to state law’’); In\nre de Hertogh, 412 B.R. 24, 29 (Bankr. D. Conn. 2009)\n(‘‘the [c]ourt’s analysis focuses on when [prepetition or\npostpetition] and to whom [the estate or the postpeti-\ntion debtor] a legally cognizable interest in the cause of\naction arose under the applicable state law’’ [emphasis\nomitted]). These courts reason that ‘‘[a]lthough federal\nbankruptcy law determines the outer boundary of what\nmay constitute property of the estate, state law deter-\nmines the nature of a debtor’s interest in a given item.’’\n(Internal quotation marks omitted.) In re Crysen/Mon-\ntenay Energy Co., supra, 902 F.2d 1101; In re de Her-\ntogh, supra, 29. Therefore, ‘‘whereas federal law\ninstructs us that [a cause of action] may constitute\nproperty of [the debtor’s] estate, state law determines\nwhether [the debtor’s] interest in the cause of action\n\fis sufficient to confer on the estate a property right\nin the action.’’ (Emphasis in original.) In re Crysen/\nMontenay Energy Co., supra, 1101. The Second Circuit,\nwhose decisions ‘‘ ‘carry particularly persuasive\nweight’ ’’ in our resolution of issues of federal law;\nDayner v. Archdiocese of Hartford, 301 Conn. 759, 783,\n23 A.3d 1192 (2011); follows this approach. See, e.g.,\nHirsch v. Arthur Andersen & Co., 72 F.3d 1085, 1093\n(2d Cir. 1995) (‘‘Whether the rights belong to the debtor\n. . . is a question of state law. . . . Thus, the trustee\nstands in the shoes of the debtors, and can only maintain\nthose actions that the debtors could have brought prior\nto the bankruptcy proceedings.’’ [Citations omitted;\ninternal quotation marks omitted.]); In re de Hertogh,\nsupra, 29 (same); see also In re Crysen/Montenay\nEnergy Co., supra, 1101 (state law determines nature\nof debtor’s interest in given item).\n   Other courts, relying on Segal v. Rochelle, 382 U.S.\n375, 86 S. Ct. 511, 15 L. Ed. 2d 428 (1966),10 deem the\npurposes of federal bankruptcy law controlling, namely,\nto secure for creditors everything of value the debtor\nmay possess in alienable or leviable form when he files\nhis petition, while leaving the debtor free after the peti-\ntion date to accumulate new wealth in the future. See\nid., 379–80. These courts consider whether, even if a\ncause of action accrued postpetition under state law,\nthat action nonetheless was ‘‘sufficiently rooted in the\npre-bankruptcy past and so little entangled with the\nbankrupt’s ability to make an unencumbered fresh start\nthat it should be regarded as property’’ of the bank-\nruptcy estate. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.,\n380; see, e.g., In re Jenkins, 410 B.R. 182, 191–92 (Bankr.\nW.D. Va. 2008) (holding that bankruptcy law, not state\nlaw, ‘‘determines whether a debtor’s interest is property\nof the estate’’ and, as such, plaintiff’s tort claims are\nsufficiently rooted in prepetition conduct because they\n‘‘derive solely from the conduct of the [d]efendants that\ntook place prior to the commencement of the bank-\nruptcy case’’ [emphasis in original]); In re Riccitelli,\n320 B.R. 483, 491–92 (Bankr. D. Mass. 2005) (holding\nthat malpractice claim that accrued postpetition was\nnot ‘‘sufficiently rooted in the pre-bankruptcy past’’\nbecause harm suffered occurred postpetition and was\nentangled with debtor’s ability to have unencumbered\nfresh start); Field v. Transcontinental Ins. Co., 219 B.R.\n115, 119 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1998) (holding that claim for\nbad faith failure to insure brought against insurance\ncompany, which accrued postpetition, was ‘‘sufficiently\nrooted in [the] pre-bankruptcy past’’ to become part of\nbankruptcy estate because accident and right to cover-\nage occurred prepetition), aff’d, 173 F.3d 424 (4th Cir.\n1999). Under this approach, if the claim has sufficient\nroots in the prebankruptcy past but does not materially\nimpair the bankrupt’s ability to obtain the fresh start\nintended under bankruptcy law, the claim belongs\nexclusively to the estate.11 See Tyler v. DH Capital\n\fManagement, Inc., 736 F.3d 455, 461–62 (6th Cir. 2013);\nIn re Riccitelli, supra, 491–92.\n   Despite this split of authority, we conclude that we\nneed not resolve in the present case which approach\nis correct because the defendants’ claim fails under\nboth approaches. We first apply the approach that looks\nto applicable state law to determine whether the claim\nexisted as of the petition date. The doctrine of promis-\nsory estoppel serves as an alternative basis to enforce\na contract in the absence of competing common-law\nconsiderations. See D’Ulisse-Cupo v. Board of Direc-\ntors of Notre Dame High School, 202 Conn. 206, 213,\n520 A.2d 217 (1987); Torringford Farms Assn., Inc. v.\nTorrington, 75 Conn. App. 570, 576, 816 A.2d 736, cert.\ndenied, 263 Conn. 924, 823 A.2d 1217 (2003). ‘‘The law\nconcerning when a breach of contract action accrues\nis well settled. This court has stated that [i]n an action\nfor breach of contract . . . the cause of action is com-\nplete at the time the breach of contract occurs, that is,\nwhen the injury has been inflicted.’’ (Internal quotation\nmarks omitted.) Tolbert v. Connecticut General Life\nIns. Co., 257 Conn. 118, 124, 778 A.2d 1 (2001); see also\nEngelman v. Connecticut General Life Ins. Co., 240\nConn. 287, 294–95 n.7, 690 A.2d 882 (1997) (noting in\ncontract action wherein defendant is claimed to have\nbreached his obligation to pay sum of money, cause of\naction accrues when defendant fails to pay promised\nsum). Therefore, it follows that a cause of action for\npromissory estoppel accrues when the defendant fails\nto fulfill its promise. See Torringford Farms Assn., Inc.\nv. Torrington, supra, 577–78.\n   As we previously indicated, Weiss filed his petition\nfor bankruptcy on December 5, 2003, and Smulders\nrenounced his promise to merge companies in Septem-\nber, 2006. Therefore, under state law, the plaintiffs’\npromissory estoppel claim did not accrue until 2006,\nafter Weiss filed for bankruptcy. Indeed, the defendants\ndo not dispute that, under the accrual date approach,\nthe plaintiffs’ cause of action premised on a promissory\nestoppel claim was not property of the bankruptcy\nestate.\n  We reach the same conclusion by applying the alter-\nnative approach under which federal bankruptcy law\ncontrols. The courts taking this approach have indi-\ncated that a cause of action does not become property\nof the bankruptcy estate merely because it has some\nprepetition roots; rather, the facts forming the cause\nof action determine whether it is sufficiently rooted\nin the prepetition past. See, e.g., Tyler v. DH Capital\nManagement, Inc., supra, 736 F.3d 462 (‘‘pre-petition\nconduct or facts alone will not ‘root’ a claim in the\npast; there must be a pre-petition violation’’); In re\nde Hertogh, supra, 412 B.R. 30–31 (holding prepetition\nroots of malpractice action outweighed by postpetition\nsuffering of harm, thus rendering cause of action debt-\n\for’s property); In re Jenkins, supra, 410 B.R. 191 (hold-\ning tort claims sufficiently rooted in prepetition conduct\nbecause ‘‘claims derive solely from the conduct of the\n[d]efendants that took place prior to the commence-\nment of the bankruptcy case’’ [emphasis in original]); In\nre Riccitelli, supra, 320 B.R. 491–92 (noting negligence\nclaim not sufficiently rooted in prebankruptcy past pri-\nmarily because harm occurred postpetition as harm\nresulted from filing of petition). Some courts have\nstrictly construed the test to require that all or most of\nthe facts constituting the cause of action exist at the\ncommencement of the bankruptcy case; see, e.g., Tyler\nv. DH Capital Management, Inc., supra, 462; In re Jen-\nkins, supra, 194; In re Riccitelli, supra, 491–92; while\nother courts have applied the test expansively to include\ncontingent and unripe claims as property of the estate.\nSee, e.g., Fix v. First State Bank of Roscoe, 559 F.3d\n803, 809 (8th Cir. 2009) (claims based on breach of\npromise ‘‘have sufficient roots in [debtor’s] pre-bank-\nruptcy activities to be considered property of the bank-\nruptcy estate, even though the [b]ank’s alleged breach\nof its promise occurred post-petition’’); In re Parker,\nDocket No. 06-8053, 2007 Bankr. LEXIS 1523, *26\n(B.A.P. 6th Cir. May 10, 2007) (holding legal malpractice\nclaim became part of estate at time of negligence, not\nwhen damages incurred).\n   Irrespective of whether we construe the test strictly\nor expansively, however, the result is the same. The\ntrial court found that promissory estoppel arose from\nWeiss’ detrimental reliance on a series of promises and\nstatements made by Smulders between 2003 and 2006.\nOnly one of those communications occurred before the\nbankruptcy petition was filed—the August, 2003 e-mail.\nThe distribution agreement executed in December,\n2003, however, unequivocally reflects that no firm\npromise to merge the companies had yet been made.\nThat distribution agreement acknowledges that ‘‘[t]he\nparties have entered into discussions with respect to\nthe formation of a new company . . . .’’ (Emphasis\nadded.) Therefore, any promise supporting the promis-\nsory estoppel claim occurred after the petition was\nfiled. Similarly, all of Weiss’ actions demonstrating det-\nrimental reliance and harm occurred postpetition.\nTherefore, even under the sufficiently rooted test, it is\nclear that the plaintiffs’ promissory estoppel claim is\na postpetition asset that was not property of Weiss’\nbankruptcy estate because all of the actions supporting\nthe claim occurred subsequent to the date Weiss filed\nhis bankruptcy petition. Accordingly, we conclude that\nthe plaintiffs had standing to pursue their promissory\nestoppel claim, irrespective of which test applies.\n                            B\n   We next turn to the defendants’ claim that the plain-\ntiffs cannot recover on their promissory estoppel claim\nbecause it contradicts the fully integrated distribution\n\fagreement. Specifically, the defendants point to a\nmerger clause in the distribution agreement, and to\nlanguage therein indicating that any agreement regard-\ning the formation of a new business must be evidenced\nin writing. As such, the defendants argue that the trial\ncourt violated the parol evidence rule by allowing the\nplaintiffs to prevail on their promissory estoppel claim.12\nIn response, the plaintiffs argue that the defendants’\nclaim is unpreserved because they did not object to the\nintroduction of parol evidence at trial or assert that\nthe distribution agreement was fully integrated. The\nplaintiffs further argue that the defendants’ claim never-\ntheless fails on the merits because the subject matter\nof Smulders’ promise to merge companies did not come\nwithin the scope of the distribution agreement. We con-\nclude that, even though the defendants did not directly\nraise this claim at trial, they are permitted to pursue it\non appeal because the trial court addressed this matter.\nSee Practice Book § 60-5 (‘‘[an appellate] court shall\nnot be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly\nraised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial’’\n[emphasis added]); Azia v. DiLascia, 64 Conn. App.\n540, 558–59 n.13, 780 A.2d 992 (addressing issue on\nappeal that arose for first time in trial court’s memoran-\ndum of decision), cert. denied, 258 Conn. 914, 782 A.2d\n1241 (2001). We further conclude that the trial court\nproperly admitted evidence in support of the plaintiffs’\npromissory estoppel claim because Smulders’ promise\ndid not vary or contradict the subject matter of the\ndistribution agreement.\n    ‘‘[T]he parol evidence rule is not an exclusionary rule\nof evidence . . . but a rule of substantive contract law\n. . . to which we afford plenary review.’’ (Internal quo-\ntation marks omitted.)

The preface\nto the distribution agreement sets forth several recital\nprovisions, including the following: ‘‘This Master Distri-\nbution Agreement . . . is made and entered into . . .\nwith reference to the following facts . . .\n  ‘‘2. The parties have entered into discussions with\nrespect to the formation of a new company, joint ven-\nture or other similar arrangement which would replace\nthe business arrangement detailed in this [a]greement;\n  ‘‘3. Unless and until the above-described arrangement\nhas been finalized and evidenced by written\nagreement(s), [Garden of Light] wishes to appoint\n[Food Works] as its exclusive distributor for the sale\nof Products under the Marks to Dealers in the Territory\n(as such terms are hereinafter defined) . . . .’’\n   Following the recitations, the distribution agreement\nthen provides: ‘‘THEREFORE, [Garden of Light] and\n[Food Works] hereby agree as follows . . . .’’ The dis-\ntribution agreement then prescribes substantive terms\nof the agreement, including, among others, the grant of\na distributorship to Food Works, Food Works’ general\nobligations, Garden of Light’s general obligations,\nprices and terms of payment, the duration of the\nagreement, and termination. One such term is a merger\nclause, which provides in relevant part: ‘‘This\n[a]greement contains all of the terms and conditions\n\fagreed upon by the parties hereto with reference to the\nsubject matter hereof. No other agreements, oral or\notherwise, shall be deemed to exist or to bind either\nof the parties hereto, and all prior agreements and\nunderstandings are superseded hereby. . . .’’ (Empha-\nsis added.)\n   We conclude that, even if the distribution agreement\nis fully integrated, the defendants’ claim fails because\nan examination of the distribution agreement clearly\nindicates that the evidence admitted at trial to prove\nthat Smulders promised Weiss that they would merge\ncompanies to form NEWCO is collateral to the subject\nmatter of the distribution agreement. The subject mat-\nter of the distribution agreement is Food Works’ pur-\nchase and distribution of Garden of Light’s products,\nnot the formation of NEWCO. Cf. Perricone v. Perri-\ncone, 292 Conn. 187, 196, 972 A.2d 666 (2009) (holding\nconfidentiality agreement collateral to separation\nagreement because ‘‘relevant subject matter of the sepa-\nration agreement was the division of property between\nthe parties, while the subject matter of the confidential-\nity agreement was the disclosure of information con-\ncerning the parties’ property and the parties\nthemselves’’ [emphasis in original]); Shelton Yacht &\nCabana Club, Inc. v. Suto, 150 Conn. 251, 257, 259–60,\n188 A.2d 493 (1963) (holding that although written and\nunwritten contracts related to advertising and promo-\ntion of defendant’s clubs, unwritten contracts are collat-\neral to written contracts because written contracts\nconcern promise to advertise, promote, and sell mem-\nberships to defendant’s clubs, while unwritten con-\ntracts concerned expenses paid and incurred by\nplaintiffs in promoting clubs, therefore exceeding scope\nof written contracts). All of the substantive rights and\nobligations under the distribution agreement pertain to\nthat distribution agreement. There is no provision in\nthe distribution agreement addressing the parameters\nunder which NEWCO would be created or the parties’\nobligations upon the creation of NEWCO. Indeed, the\ntrial court’s finding that the distribution agreement\nmerely pertained to the distribution relationship is\nwholly consistent with the title of the agreement—\n’’Master Distributorship Agreement’’—and the obliga-\ntions imposed thereunder.\n   The only reference to the future formation of the\nnew company is in the recital provisions. The related\nlanguage in the recital on which the defendants rely\nthat addresses the new venture being ‘‘finalized and\nevidenced by written agreement(s),’’ however, appears\nto conflict with substantive provisions of the distribu-\ntion agreement. Specifically, the recital indicates that\nFood Works will continue as distributor unless and until\na new company or joint venture has been finalized. The\nsubstantive provision pertaining to the duration of the\ncontract states that the agreement is to last for three\nyears from the date of execution ‘‘[u]nless sooner termi-\n\fnated in accordance with the provisions of [a]rticle 9\n[Termination].’’ Article 9 enumerates specific grounds\non which either party may terminate the agreement,\nnone of which includes the formation of NEWCO or\nany other joint venture. Any conflict between the recital\nprovisions and the substantive terms of the distribution\nagreement is resolved by the fact that the subject matter\nof the distribution agreement is the distribution rela-\ntionship between the parties. As such, the substantive\nprovisions regarding the duration and termination of\nthat matter necessarily would control over what is evi-\ndently a collateral matter.13 See McKinnon v. Baker,\n220 Neb. 314, 317, 370 N.W.2d 492 (1985) (noting well\nsettled principle that ‘‘[i]f both the recitals and the oper-\native part are clear, but they are inconsistent with each\nother, the operative part must control’’ [internal quota-\ntion marks omitted]); see also Jamison v. Franklin Life\nIns. Co., 60 Ariz. 308, 317, 136 P.2d 265 (1943) (same);\nWilliams v. Barkley, 165 N.Y. 48, 57, 58 N.E. 765 (1900)\n(same). In light of these considerations, it is apparent\nthat the formation of NEWCO was collateral to the\nsubject matter of the distribution agreement. Therefore,\nthe trial court properly admitted evidence to prove\nSmulders’ promises to Weiss because such evidence\ndid not vary the terms of the writing contained in the\ndistribution agreement.\n                             C\n   Having disposed of the defendants’ appeal contesting\nthe merits of the plaintiffs’ promissory estoppel claim,\nwe turn to the plaintiffs’ claims in their appeal regarding\ndamages on that claim. The plaintiffs contend that the\ntrial court improperly concluded that they failed to\nprove the value of the merged company with reasonable\ncertainty because their expert was entitled to rely on\nreasonable assumptions in assigning a valuation to\nNEWCO. In response, the defendants argue that the\ntrial court properly decided that the plaintiffs had failed\nto prove the value of NEWCO because they valued\nthe wrong entity during the wrong time period. We\nconclude that the plaintiffs failed to meet their burden\nbecause they did not produce evidence valuing a com-\npany that is substantially similar to what NEWCO would\nhave been to form a comparative basis on which to\nprove damages.\n   The legal principles that govern our review of damage\nawards are well established. ‘‘It is axiomatic that the\nburden of proving damages is on the party claiming\nthem. . . . Damages are recoverable only to the extent\nthat the evidence affords a sufficient basis for estimat-\ning their amount in money with reasonable certainty.’’\n(Internal quotation marks omitted.)

The trial court’s determination\nthat damages have not been proved to a reasonable\ncertainty is reviewed under a clearly erroneous stan-\ndard. See Gianetti v. Norwalk Hospital, 304 Conn. 754,\n780, 43 A.3d 567 (2012).\n   The record reveals the following relevant facts. To\ndemonstrate damages in support of their claim of prom-\nissory estoppel, the plaintiffs proffered expert testi-\nmony from Richard A. Royston, a forensic accountant,\nand a report prepared by Royston. Royston testified\nthat he had been asked by the plaintiffs to perform an\nappraisal of the value of Garden of Light and to calculate\na valuation of a 50 percent share of the company on\nas late a date as possible. Royston’s calculation was\npremised on the company’s value as of December 31,\n2008. To value Garden of Light, Royston used the capi-\ntalization of earnings methodology, which values an\nentity by its sales and profits and does not take physical\nassets into account. See West Haven Sound Develop-\nment Corp. v. West Haven, 201 Conn. 305, 329, 514 A.2d\n734 (1986) (‘‘[w]hile there are several different methods\nby which to determine the value of a closely-held corpo-\nration, these methods, and their variants, are of two\ngeneral types: [1] capitalization of earnings, or the net\npresent value of a future income stream; and [2] net\nasset value, or the present sale price of the business\nassets less its liabilities’’).\n   Royston derived his valuation determination by first\nexamining Garden of Light’s gross sales and profits, as\nstated in its federal income tax returns from 2003 to\n2008. Royston testified that he had observed a sharp\nincrease in Garden of Light’s sales from 2006 to 2008,\nin which the annual sales almost doubled, and that he\nfocused on that increase in carrying out his valuation.\nHe also stated that there was a corresponding increase\n\fin gross profits as well. Royston then made two deduc-\ntions in the company’s value: to account for its market-\nability; and to address the fact that there would be a\nlack of control of the company due to the nonmajority\n50 percent share that Weiss expected he would obtain.\nTaking all of the information into account, Royston\nopined that the market value of Garden of Light in its\nentirety was $720,000, and thus a 50 percent share\nwould be valued at $360,000.\n  Royston further testified that he had requested infor-\nmation from Smulders and Weiss to segregate the gro-\ncery store operations of Garden of Light from the\ngranola products of Bakery on Main, but neither Weiss\nnor Smulders had such information. He testified that\nhe used the capitalization of earnings methodology\nbecause he was unable to distinguish between the\nincome of the grocery stores and the income of Bakery\non Main, and thus was unable to come up with a compa-\nrable peer group of companies to compare with NEWCO\nin order to extrapolate its value, which would have\nbeen an alternative market-based method of valuing\nNEWCO.\n  On cross-examination, Royston testified that he did\nnot take Weiss’ bankruptcy into account in valuing Gar-\nden of Light and that Weiss’ poor credit could have had\nan impact on NEWCO’s ability to take out future loans.\nRoyston further admitted that, although he understood\nthat NEWCO would be comprised of the Bakery on\nMain division of Garden of Light and Food Works, he\ndid not value the merged entity. Further, Royston stated\nthat he was not given any financial data for Food Works,\nnor did he value that company. He also admitted that\nto perform a valuation of NEWCO, it would have been\nextremely helpful to have the value of Food Works and\nthe value of Bakery on Main, rather than the value of\nGarden of Light in its entirety. Although Royston did\nnot value Bakery on Main separately, he opined that\nthe grocery stores were not a material part of Garden\nof Light’s value. In support of this conclusion, Royston\npointed to three facts: a sharp increase in marketing\nexpenses that he attributed to Bakery on Main; a two-\nfold increase in Garden of Light’s business between\n2006 and 2007; and the arrival of a competing natural\nfoods store in 2008. Royston reasoned that the volume\nof business at one of the grocery store locations was\ndowntrending due to the competition and, therefore,\nthe increase in Garden of Light’s business was due to\nBakery on Main’s granola business rather than the gro-\ncery stores.\n  In its memorandum of decision, the trial court found\nthat there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the\nvalue of NEWCO. The court agreed with the defendants\nthat Royston’s valuation was flawed because it did not\nmeasure the value of NEWCO, which was to consist\nof Food Works and Bakery on Main. The court first\n\fdetermined that the value of the merged company likely\nwould be different than the value of Garden of Light.\nThe court reasoned that Garden of Light included two\ngrocery stores that were not intended to be included\nin NEWCO. Therefore, the court determined that any\nvalue those stores contributed or detracted from the\n$720,000 valuation should not have been considered in\nthe calculation of damages. The court also pointed to\nthe following factors that were not accounted for in\nthat valuation by Royston’s own admission: Weiss’ par-\nticipation as a co-owner of NEWCO would have likely\nlessened the value of NEWCO based on his poor credit;\nand the value of Food Works, for which no evidence\nhad been produced, would need to be measured and\nincluded in the value of NEWCO.\n  Applying the aforementioned damages principles to\nthe facts in the present case, we conclude that, for\nprecisely the reasons identified by the trial court, the\nevidence presented at trial was inadequate to establish\nthe value of NEWCO with as much reasonable certainty\nas the case permitted. The plaintiffs contend, however,\nthat they may prove their damages by comparing the\nvalue of a comparable business, which they did when\nthey valued Garden of Light. Although this court has\napproved evidence of a similar business as probative\non the issue of lost profits of a business that never\ncame to fruition; see Cheryl Terry Enterprises, Ltd. v.\nHartford, 270 Conn. 619, 655, 854 A.2d 1066 (2004);\nBeverly Hills Concepts, Inc. v. Schatz & Schatz, Ribi-\ncoff & Kotkin, supra, 247 Conn. 73; we have emphasized\nthat ‘‘[t]he underlying requirement for [this type] of\nevidence is a substantial similarity between the facts\nforming the basis of the profit projections and the busi-\nness opportunity that was destroyed.’’ Beverly Hills\nConcepts, Inc. v. Schatz & Schatz, Ribicoff & Kotkin,\nsupra, 74. As such, the plaintiffs had the burden of\nestablishing that Garden of Light and NEWCO were\nsubstantially similar companies.\n   There are two readily apparent deficiencies in the\nplaintiffs’ evidence: (1) the value of Garden of Light\nincluded the sales and profits of the two grocery stores\nthat would not be part of NEWCO; and (2) the value\nof Garden of Light did not include the value of Food\nWorks, which would be part of NEWCO. Royston\nacknowledged that he would need to account for both of\nthese facts to properly determine the value of NEWCO.\nThus, although a damages theory may be based on\nassumptions, those assumptions must be reasonable in\nlight of the record evidence. Id., 70. A simple measure-\nment of a different, albeit related, company is not\nenough for the court to make a reasonable estimation\nof the value of a 50 percent share of NEWCO when\nthere were significant differences between Garden of\nLight and NEWCO.\n  Although Royston testified on cross-examination that\n\fGarden of Light’s two grocery stores were not a material\npart of the company, he did not provide the court with\nsufficient, credible evidence to support this conclusion.\nRoyston assumed that Garden of Light’s drastic increase\nin profits between 2006 and 2008 was due to Bakery\non Main’s success because the company’s marketing\nexpenses were higher than in previous years and\nbecause a new competing grocery store opened in 2008.\nCorrelation, however, is not causation. More fundamen-\ntally, even if that increase could be attributable solely\nto Bakery on Main that fact does not account for what\nportion of Garden of Light’s value prior to this increase\nwas attributable to the grocery stores. Accordingly, the\nplaintiffs did not ‘‘lay a foundation [that would] enable\nthe trier to make a fair and reasonable estimate’’ of the\ndamages. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Ameri-\ncan Diamond Exchange, Inc. v. Alpert, supra, 302\nConn. 511.\n   Nonetheless, the plaintiffs argue that the evidence is\nreasonable in light of the fact that Royston testified\nthat he had asked for information that would allow him\nto separate the sales of the two grocery stores from\nBakery on Main, but was unable to obtain such informa-\ntion. We reject this argument for two reasons. First,\nduring his testimony, Royston repeatedly stated that he\nwas engaged to value Garden of Light, not an entity\ncomprised of Food Works and Bakery on Main. Indeed,\nthe plaintiffs do not claim that they made any attempt\nto gather such evidence from the defendants, other than\npointing to Royston’s statement at trial. Second, even\nif we were to excuse the plaintiffs from offering more\ndefinite proof by virtue of the defendants’ failure to\nprovide Royston with such information, the plaintiffs\nnevertheless failed to take into account the value of\nFood Works. Royston testified that he did not have any\nknowledge of Food Works’ sales and profits for any\npoint during the relevant time period and that he could\nnot opine on the value of the company. Although Roys-\nton opined that Food Works’ value in 2006 would not\nimpact his valuation of Garden of Light in 2008, assum-\ning that Food Works had no assets and that all of its\ncustomers and sales were absorbed by Garden of Light,\nthis assumption appears to be pure speculation as it\nwas not supported by any objective facts, figures, or\ndata, nor was there any testimony to the effect that\nsuch data were not available. Therefore, the plaintiffs’\nfailure to produce evidence of the value of Food Works,\nwhich we must assume was readily available to them,\nrequires us to conclude that they have not met their\nburden of establishing the value of NEWCO with reason-\nable certainty.\n   Finally, the plaintiffs cite an Appellate Court case for\nthe proposition that doubts as to exact amounts of\ndamages are generally resolved against the parties in\nbreach and thus any uncertainty in their damages calcu-\nlation should be resolved against the defendants. See\n\fMessage Center Management, Inc. v. Shell Oil Products\nCo., 85 Conn. App. 401, 413, 857 A.2d 936 (2004). This\nprinciple may only be invoked, however, once the plain-\ntiffs have demonstrated the amount of damages with\nreasonable certainty, which the plaintiffs have failed\nto do. See 3 Restatement (Second), Contracts § 352,\ncomment (a), pp. 144–45 (1981) (noting while doubts\nin amount of damages are resolved against party in\nbreach, to prevent windfalls plaintiff must still prove\namount with reasonable certainty). In light of the afore-\nmentioned considerations, we conclude that the trial\ncourt’s finding that the plaintiffs failed to prove their\ndamages with reasonable certainty with respect to the\nvalue of NEWCO was not clearly erroneous.14\n                             D\n   In light of our conclusion in part I C of this opinion\nas to the evidentiary deficiency, we must address the\nplaintiffs’ claim that the trial court improperly granted\nthe defendants’ motion for reargument and reversed\nits decision to hold a posttrial evidentiary hearing on\ndamages.15 Specifically, the plaintiffs claim that the trial\ncourt improperly relied on the fact that the case had\nbeen pending for five years before trial in the absence\nof a finding that the alleged delay was the plaintiffs’\nfault, and failed to consider that its decision would have\nthe effect of precluding the plaintiffs from providing\nthe court with a sufficient basis on which to award\ndamages. We disagree.\n   We review the trial court’s decision to not reopen\nevidence for a hearing on damages under the abuse of\ndiscretion standard. See, e.g., Wood v. Bridgeport, 216\nConn. 604, 606, 583 A.2d 124 (1990) (‘‘[w]hether . . .\na trial court will permit further evidence to be offered\nafter the close of testimony in a case is a matter resting\nin the sound discretion of the court’’ [internal quotation\nmarks omitted]). Similarly, we review the adjudication\nof a motion to reargue for an abuse of discretion. See\nLiberti v. Liberti, 132 Conn. App. 869, 874, 37 A.3d\n166 (2012). ‘‘In determining whether there has been\nan abuse of discretion, every reasonable presumption\nshould be given in favor of the correctness of the court’s\nruling. . . . Reversal is required only [when] an abuse\nof discretion is manifest or [when] injustice appears to\nhave been done.’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\nPatino v. Birken Mfg. Co., 304 Conn. 679, 698, 41 A.3d\n1013 (2012).\n   The plaintiffs’ claim merits little discussion. We do\nnot construe the trial court’s decision as punishing the\nplaintiffs for delaying the commencement of trial.\nRather, the court simply determined that the plaintiffs\nhad ample opportunity to obtain evidence, through dis-\ncovery or otherwise, pertaining to their alleged damages\nin the years preceding the trial. The court was entitled\nto presume that the plaintiffs were prepared to present\ntheir case when trial commenced. The plaintiffs did not\n\frequest a continuance or seek sanctions due to the\ndefendants’ failure to comply with discovery requests\nto obtain evidence relating to valuation. Indeed, the\ntrial court sua sponte ordered further evidentiary pro-\nceedings after the close of evidence. When a party has\nbeen afforded ample opportunity to obtain and present\nevidence, a trial court acts well within its discretion to\ndecline to allow that party to obtain a conclusive ruling\nas to whether the evidence presented satisfied the par-\nty’s burden of proof, and then to reopen the evidentiary\nportion of the trial in order to present further evidence\nif the ruling is adverse. Accordingly, given the facts and\ncircumstances of this case, we cannot conclude that\nthe trial court abused its discretion in granting the\ndefendants’ motion to reargue and reversing its sua\nsponte decision to hold a posttrial evidentiary hearing\non damages.\n                            II\n   Finally, we turn to the plaintiffs’ claim that the trial\ncourt improperly rendered judgment for the defendants\non their breach of contract counterclaim due to Food\nWorks’ failure to pay for certain granola products\nreceived from Garden of Light. The plaintiffs contend\nthat they were discharged from their obligations\nbecause the defendants committed prior material\nbreaches of the distribution agreement. Specifically,\nthey argue that they presented evidence that the defen-\ndants had made direct sales to customers outside of\nthe Garden of Light stores in breach of the provisions\nin the distribution agreement under which Food Works\nwas deemed the sole distributor of Bakery on Main\nproducts and Garden of Light was afforded the limited\nright to sell such products only in direct sales in its\ntwo stores. The evidence indicated that Garden of Light\nhad made approximately $10,000 in direct sales of its\nproducts to customers over the Internet, but refused\nto share the revenue generated with Food Works.16 In\nresponse, the defendants argue that the plaintiffs were\nnot discharged from their obligations under the distribu-\ntion agreement because: (1) the alleged breaches were\nnot material; and (2) the plaintiffs failed to give written\nnotice to the defendants of these alleged breaches as\nrequired by the distribution agreement.17 With respect\nto the latter, the defendants point to the trial court’s\nrejection of the plaintiffs’ breach of contract claim on\nthe basis of its finding that the plaintiffs had failed to\nabide by the terms of the distribution agreement for\nnotification of breach. We conclude that, even if the\ndefendants’ alleged breaches were material, the plain-\ntiffs’ failure to notify the defendants of the breaches\nand to provide them with an opportunity to cure them\nin accordance with the provisions of the distribution\nagreement precludes them from raising this defense.\n  Under contract law, it is well settled that a material\nbreach by one party discharges the other party’s subse-\n\fquent duty to perform on the contract. See Bernstein\nv. Nemeyer, 213 Conn. 665, 672–73, 570 A.2d 164 (1990);\nsee also Vesce v. Lee, 185 Conn. 328, 334, 441 A.2d 556\n(1981); 2 Restatement (Second), supra, § 237 (‘‘it is a\ncondition of each party’s remaining duties to render\nperformances to be exchanged under an exchange of\npromises that there be no uncured material failure by\nthe other party to render any such performance due at\nan earlier time’’). Whether a breach is material depends\non the circumstances of the case. 669 Atlantic Street\nAssociates v. Atlantic-Rockland Stamford Associates,\n43 Conn. App. 113, 128, 682 A.2d 572 (1996). In addition\nto considering the multifactor standards for materiality\nof breach contained in § 241 of the Restatement (Sec-\nond) of Contracts to assess whether a party’s uncured\nfailure to render or to offer performance discharges the\nother party’s remaining duties to render performance,\nthe Restatement (Second) of Contracts notes: ‘‘The rea-\nsonableness of the injured party’s conduct in communi-\ncating his grievances and in seeking satisfaction is a\nfactor to be considered in this connection.’’ 2\nRestatement (Second), supra, § 242, comment (b), p.\n245.\n   The distribution agreement unambiguously states\nthat if either party wishes to terminate the agreement\nupon the default of the other party, it must notify the\nbreaching party and provide that party with thirty days\nto cure such default.18 At trial, Weiss admitted in his\ntestimony that he had not notified Smulders of the\nalleged breaches by Garden of Light because he did not\nwant to harm their relationship. In reliance upon this\nfact, the trial court held that the plaintiffs could not\nsucceed on their claim for breach of the agreement\nbecause they had failed to abide by the terms of the\ndistribution agreement. ‘‘Where the language of the con-\ntract is clear and unambiguous, the contract is to be\ngiven effect according to its terms.’’ (Internal quotation\nmarks omitted.) Office of Labor Relations v. New\nEngland Health Care Employees Union, District 1199,\nAFL-CIO, 288 Conn. 223, 231–32, 951 A.2d 1249 (2008).\nTherefore, the plaintiffs waived their right to assert a\nmaterial breach of contract in defense of the defen-\ndants’ counterclaim when they failed to notify the defen-\ndants of the alleged breaches and failed to provide them\nwith an opportunity to cure such breaches. In light of\nthis conclusion, we need not reach the issue of whether\nthe defendants’ alleged breaches were in fact material.19\n      The judgment is affirmed.\n      In this opinion the other justices concurred.\n  1\n    The parties appealed to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the\nappeals to this court pursuant to General Statutes § 51-199 (c) and Practice\nBook § 65-1. Although the defendants originally filed a cross appeal to the\nAppellate Court, this court, subsequent to the transfer of the appeals, issued\nan order that the cross appeal would be treated as a direct appeal.\n  2\n    The trial court, in its memorandum of decision, relied on certain testi-\nmony in its recitation of the background of the case, without expressly\nindicating which testimony it found credible, except with respect to limited\n\ffindings in connection with its resolution of various claims. Accordingly,\nwe read the record in the light most favorable to sustaining the trial court’s\njudgment. See Smith v. Greenwich, 278 Conn. 428, 440–41, 899 A.2d 563\n(2006); Reyes v. Chetta, 143 Conn. App. 758, 764–65, 71 A.3d 1255 (2013).\n   3\n     We note that, at common law, fraudulent misrepresentation and inten-\ntional misrepresentation are the same tort. Kramer v. Petisi, 285 Conn. 674,\n684 n.9, 940 A.2d 800 (2008).\n   4\n     The court found that the plaintiffs failed to provide sufficient evidence\nto demonstrate that there was a meeting of the minds as to the clear and\ndefinite terms of the merging of the parties’ companies and therefore rejected\nthe plaintiffs’ breach of oral contract claim. The court found that the plaintiffs\nfailed to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that Smulders knew or\nshould have known that his representations to Weiss regarding the merging\nof the companies were false when he made them, i.e., that the merger would\nnot occur, and therefore rejected the plaintiffs’ negligent misrepresentation\nclaim. The court rejected the plaintiffs’ intentional misrepresentation claim\nbecause it found that the plaintiffs did not provide sufficient evidence to\ndemonstrate by clear, precise, and unequivocal evidence that the defendants\nuttered a false statement that was untrue and known to be untrue. The\ncourt rejected the plaintiffs’ breach of written contract claim because it\nfound that the plaintiffs failed to inform Garden of Light of the alleged\nbreach and to provide it with thirty days to cure such breach as required\nby the distribution agreement. Finally, the court rejected the plaintiffs’ unjust\nenrichment claim in light of its judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on their\npromissory estoppel claim.\n   5\n     The court found that the defendants had not demonstrated by clear,\nprecise, and unequivocal evidence that Weiss intentionally misled the defen-\ndants as to his financial condition with respect to his bankruptcy.\n   6\n     The plaintiffs further argue that the trial court’s judgment may be affirmed\non the alternative ground that Weiss’ promissory estoppel claim does not\nbelong to the bankruptcy estate because it is based on personal services\nperformed by Weiss after he filed for bankruptcy. In light of our conclusion\nthat the plaintiffs have standing even if the claim is deemed property, we\nneed not reach this alternative ground for affirmance.\n   7\n     As we explain later in this part of the opinion, the August, 2003 e-mail,\nin and of itself, could not be construed as containing a firm promise to\nmerge the companies.\n   8\n     The estate also includes ‘‘[a]ny interest in property that the estate\nacquires after the commencement of the case.’’ 11 U.S.C. § 541 (a) (7) (2012).\nThe federal courts have reached inconsistent results in determining whether\ncauses of actions that accrued after the bankruptcy petition has been filed\nbut during the pendency of the bankruptcy case were ‘‘acquired’’ by the\nestate or remained property of the debtor. Compare Correll v. Equifax\nCheck Services, Inc., 234 B.R. 8, 11 (Bankr. D. Conn. 1997) (holding Fair\nDebt Collection Practices Act cause of action arising out of letters received\nby debtor postpetition but prior to discharge and close of bankruptcy case\nconstituted property of estate), with In re Durrett, 187 B.R. 413, 417–19\n(Bankr. D.N.H. 1995) (holding that personal injury action arising out of\npostpetition airplane accident did not become part of bankruptcy estate);\nIn re Doemling, 127 B.R. 954, 955–56 (Bankr. W.D. Pa. 1991) (holding that\npersonal injury action arising out of postpetition automobile accident did\nnot become part of bankruptcy estate). In the present case, neither party\nargues that Weiss’ bankruptcy estate acquired the promissory estoppel claim\nafter the commencement of the case pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 541 (a) (7). As\nsuch, we need not consider it. We note, however, that, according to Weiss’\nbankruptcy docket, his case closed on March 29, 2004. Therefore, Weiss’\ncase closed prior to the occurrence of all of the conduct constituting the\nplaintiffs’ promissory estoppel claim, with the exception of Smulders’ initial\nAugust, 2003 e-mail.\n   9\n     Butner arose out of a dispute between a bankruptcy trustee and a second\nmortgagee over the right to the rents collected during the mortgagor’s bank-\nruptcy case. Butner v. United States, supra, 440 U.S. 50. The lower courts\nhad disagreed whether the bankruptcy court’s adjudication of the debtor\nas bankrupt had terminated the receivership that the debtor had previously\nestablished to collect rents, thus requiring the debtor to make a new request\nduring the bankruptcy case for the appointment of a receiver. Id., 50–51.\nThe United States Supreme Court specifically noted that it ‘‘did not grant\ncertiorari to decide whether the Court of Appeals correctly applied [the\nstate] law.’’ Id., 51. Rather, the sole issue before the Supreme Court was\nwhether state law or a federal rule of equity should govern the issue. Id.,\n\f52–53. The Supreme Court held that ‘‘[p]roperty interests are created and\ndefined by state law. Unless some federal interest requires a different result,\nthere is no reason why such interests should be analyzed differently simply\nbecause an interested party is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding.’’ Id., 55.\n   10\n      In Segal, the United States Supreme Court addressed whether loss-\ncarryback tax refunds were property of the bankruptcy estate under the\npredecessor to 11 U.S.C. § 541 (a) (1), when the refunds were sought and\nobtained after the debtors had filed for bankruptcy, but the losses constitut-\ning the refunds had been suffered prior to the date the debtors filed their\npetition. Segal v. Rochelle, supra, 382 U.S. 376–77. The court noted that,\nunder the version of the bankruptcy statutory scheme then in effect, the\nbankruptcy estate included ‘‘property . . . which prior to the filing of the\npetition . . . [the debtor] could by any means have transferred.’’ (Internal\nquotation marks omitted.) Id., 377. Relying on the purposes and policies of\nthe then current bankruptcy scheme; id., 379; the Supreme Court held that\nthe debtors’ loss-carryback refund claim ‘‘is sufficiently rooted in the pre-\nbankruptcy past and so little entangled with the [debtors’] ability to make\nan unencumbered fresh start that it should be regarded as ‘property’ under\n[our bankruptcy law].’’ Id., 380. The Supreme Court contrasted future wages\nor expected bequests, even though those might be transferable under state\nlaw, because they would nonetheless not be called property within the\nmeaning of the bankruptcy provisions then in effect as that would defeat\nthe fresh start policy embodied in the bankruptcy discharge. Id., 379–80.\n   11\n      We note that there is a debate among the federal courts as to whether\nthe sufficiently rooted test of Segal survived the enactment of the Bankruptcy\nReform Act of 1978, which replaced the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 with the\ncurrent Bankruptcy Code. Compare In re Burgess, 438 F.3d 493, 498–99\n(5th Cir. 2006) (noting sufficiently rooted test did not survive enactment of\nBankruptcy Code because 11 U.S.C. § 541 expressly defines property of\nbankruptcy estate and former § 70a [5] of Bankruptcy Act did not); In re\nRhinesmith, 450 B.R. 630, 632–33 n.1 (Bankr. W.D. Tex. 2011) (same), with In\nre Feiler, 218 F.3d 948, 955–56 (9th Cir. 2000) (noting Congress affirmatively\nadopted Segal holding when it enacted current Bankruptcy Code because\nlegislative history states that ‘‘[t]he result of Segal . . . is followed, and the\nright to a refund is property of the estate’’ [internal quotation marks omit-\nted]); see also In re Andrews, 80 F.3d 906, 910 n.9 (4th Cir. 1996) (result\nof Segal remains valid under current Bankruptcy Code). In light of our\nconclusion that the plaintiffs had standing to pursue their promissory estop-\npel claim irrespective of which test applies, we do not weigh in on this debate.\n   12\n      In the section of their brief addressing this claim, the defendants also\nasserted a distinct claim that a statement of intent to enter into a contract\nin the future cannot form the basis of a promissory estoppel claim. According\nto the defendants, Smulders’ discussions with Weiss were statements of\nintent to enter into a contract in the future. Our review of the defendants’\nanswer and posttrial brief reveal that they did not raise this issue at trial.\nMoreover, the defendants failed to identify this claim as an issue for our\nreview in their preliminary statement of the issues; see Practice Book § 67-\n4 (a); and failed to set forth a standard of review for this claim. See Practice\nBook § 67-4 (d). Accordingly, we decline to address this claim. See Practice\nBook § 60-5; see also River Bend Associates, Inc. v. Conservation & Inland\nWetlands Commission, 269 Conn. 57, 82, 848 A.2d 395 (2004); Bell Atlantic\nMobile, Inc. v. Dept. of Public Utility Control, 253 Conn. 453, 485, 754 A.2d\n128 (2000).\n   13\n      The plaintiffs cite an Appellate Court case that recognized that ‘‘[r]ecitals\nin a contract, such as whereas clauses, are merely explanations of the\ncircumstances surrounding the execution of the contract, and are not binding\nobligations unless referred to in the operative provisions of the contract.’’\n(Internal quotation marks omitted.) DeMorais v. Wisniowski, 81 Conn. App.\n595, 610, 841 A.2d 226, cert. denied, 268 Conn. 923, 848 A.2d 472 (2004); id.,\n610–11 (citing authority from other jurisdictions recognizing principle). Our\nresearch also reveals that other jurisdictions have held that although recitals\ndo not control over the substantive provisions of a contract, they may be\nread in conjunction with those provisions to ascertain the parties’ intention,\nparticularly where the substantive provisions are ambiguous. See, e.g., Ara-\nmony v. United Way of America, 254 F.3d 403, 413 (2d Cir. 2001) (‘‘we\nhave held that although a statement in a whereas clause may be useful in\ninterpreting an ambiguous operative clause in a contract, it cannot create\nany right beyond those arising from the operative terms of the document’’\n[internal quotation marks omitted]); Stowers v. Community Medical Center,\nInc., 340 Mont. 116, 121, 172 P.3d 1252 (2007) (‘‘while ‘whereas’ clauses\n\fcannot be permitted to control over the express provisions of a contract,\nthey are to be read in conjunction with the operative portions of the contract\nin order to ascertain the intention of the parties’’); McKinnon v. Baker, 220\nNeb. 314, 317, 370 N.W.2d 492 (1985) (‘‘[Recitals] are generally background\nstatements and do not ordinarily form any part of the real agreement. If the\nagreement proper is ambiguous, then the recitals may be of value in constru-\ning the same.’’). In light of our conclusion that the formation of NEWCO is\ncollateral to the subject matter of the distribution agreement, and because\nthe substantive provisions do not refer to the particular language in the\nrecitals nor is the language of the distribution agreement ambiguous, we\nneed not analyze or adopt any of these additional rules.\n   14\n      In light of our conclusion that the plaintiffs failed to meet their burden\nbecause the valuation of Garden of Light included its two grocery stores\nand excluded the value of Food Works, we do not address the plaintiffs’\nargument that the trial court improperly found that Weiss’ participation as\na co-owner of NEWCO would likely have lessened its value as we do not\nrely on that factor. Similarly, in light of our conclusion, we need not address\nthe defendants’ argument that the plaintiffs presented improper evidence\nof the value of NEWCO by including sales and profits of Garden of Light\nfrom the time period of 2006 through 2008, after Smulders had breached\nhis promise to Weiss.\n   15\n      In their motion for reargument, the defendants contended both that the\ntrial court lacked authority to reopen the evidence and that they would be\nprejudiced by a reopening of the evidence. The trial court did not address\neither argument specifically, and the defendants have not argued in their\nbrief to this court as an alternative ground to affirm the trial court’s decision\nthat it lacked authority to reopen the evidence. Therefore, we do not address\nthis issue.\n   16\n      The plaintiffs also contend that the defendants made approximately\n$100 of sales in person outside of its stores. These sales must be deemed\nde minimis by any standard, and therefore we do not consider them.\n   17\n      Additionally, the defendants argue that this claim is barred because the\nplaintiffs did not plead prior material breach as a separate special defense\nas required by Practice Book § 10-50. The defendants have raised this claim\nfor the first time on appeal. In light of well settled law that ‘‘the failure to\nfile a special defense may be treated as waived when no objection has been\nraised to the offer of evidence on the issue’’; Pepe v. New Britain, 203 Conn.\n281, 286, 524 A.2d 629 (1987); see also Schilberg Integrated Metals Corp. v.\nContinental Casualty Co., 263 Conn. 245, 273, 819 A.2d 773 (2003); it is\nevident that the defendants are not entitled to review of this issue on appeal.\n   18\n      The distribution agreement provides in relevant part: ‘‘[E]ither party\nmay terminate this [a]greement for failure by the other party to perform or\nadhere to any of its obligations under this [a]greement by notifying the other\nparty of such default and allowing the other party thirty (30) days within\nwhich to cure such default.’’\n   19\n      The plaintiffs further claim that the trial court improperly rendered\njudgment for the defendants on their breach of contract counterclaim\nbecause the defendants had unclean hands, arguing that: (1) in rendering\njudgment for the plaintiffs on their promissory estoppel claim, the trial court\nfound that Smulders had induced Weiss to make significant sacrifices for\nthe benefit of Garden of Light in reliance on Smulders’ promise to merge\ncompanies; and (2) Garden of Light repeatedly breached the distribution\nagreement by making direct sales to customers. We reject the plaintiffs’\nargument for two reasons. First, the equitable defense of unclean hands\nbars only equitable relief. See, e.g., Thompson v. Orcutt, 257 Conn. 301, 308,\n777 A.2d 670 (2001); Eldridge v. Eldridge, 244 Conn. 523, 536, 710 A.2d 757\n(1998); DeCecco v. Beach, 174 Conn. 29, 34, 381 A.2d 543 (1977). The defen-\ndants sought a legal remedy in the form of money damages for their breach\nof contract counterclaim. Second, the plaintiffs have not demonstrated on\nthe record that the defendants engaged in ‘‘wilful misconduct . . . so as\nto invoke the equitable maxim as claimed.’’ DeCecco v. Beach, supra, 35;\nsee also A & B Auto Salvage, Inc. v. Zoning Board of Appeals, 189 Conn.\n573, 578, 456 A.2d 1187 (1983). Indeed, Smulders testified that he would\nhave cured a breach had he been notified of one. Accordingly, the trial court\ndid not abuse its discretion in rejecting the plaintiffs’ defense. See Thompson\nv. Orcutt, supra, 308 (noting application of unclean hands doctrine rests\nwithin sound discretion of trial court).\n\f",

These appeals arise out of a dispute\nbetween two specialty food businesses regarding the\nscope of their obligations under a distribution\nagreement and the legal effect of oral promises regard-\ning the formation of a joint venture between the busi-\nnesses. The plaintiffs, Randall Weiss and his company,\nGourmet and Specialty Food Works, LLC (Food Works),\ncommenced this action against the defendants, Michael\nD. Smulders and his company, Garden of Light Natural\nFood Markets, Inc. (Garden of Light), seeking to recover\nmoney damages for, inter alia, breach of an oral contract\nand promissory estoppel for failing to form the joint\nventure. The defendants filed counterclaims asserting,\ninter alia, that the plaintiffs had breached the parties’\nwritten contract by failing to pay for goods purchased.\nFollowing a bench trial, the court rendered judgment\nfor the plaintiffs on their promissory estoppel claim\nagainst Smulders, but awarded limited damages on the\nground that the plaintiffs had not proved the value of\ntheir share of the new venture to a reasonable certainty,\nand rendered judgment for the defendants on their\nbreach of contract counterclaim. The plaintiffs and the\ndefendants filed separate appeals from the judgment.1\nIn their appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court\nimproperly: (1) found that the evidence adduced at trial\nwas insufficient to establish their damages with reason-\nable certainty; (2) reversed its decision to hold a post-\ntrial evidentiary hearing to allow the plaintiffs to present\nfurther evidence regarding damages; and (3) rendered\njudgment for the defendants on their breach of contract\ncounterclaim because the defendants had committed\nprior material breaches. In their appeal, the defendants\nclaim that the court improperly rendered judgment for\nthe plaintiffs on their promissory estoppel claim\nbecause: (1) the plaintiffs lacked standing in light of\nWeiss’ bankruptcy filing; and (2) that claim contradicts\nthe fully integrated distribution agreement. We affirm\nthe judgment of the trial court in all respects.\n   The trial court reasonably could have found the fol-\nlowing facts.2 Smulders and Weiss had their first busi-\nness interaction in 2001. At that time, Smulders was\nthe president and sole shareholder of Garden of Light,\na company that owned and operated two natural foods\ngrocery stores in Avon and Glastonbury and a bakery\nthat produced natural granola products sold in those\nstores. Weiss was the owner and operator of Aegean\nInternational, an olive oil and balsamic vinegar distribu-\ntion and marketing company. The business relationship\nbetween the two men began when Weiss approached\nSmulders about selling his olive oil in Garden of Light’s\nGlastonbury store. Smulders agreed, and due to suc-\ncessful sales, Smulders continued to purchase olive oil\nfrom Weiss.\n  In the late spring or early summer of 2003, while\n\fWeiss was visiting the Garden of Light grocery store,\nSmulders asked Weiss if he thought that Garden of\nLight’s granola could be packaged for wholesale distri-\nbution. At that time, the granola products were being\nsold only in the two Garden of Light grocery stores,\nand were packed in a plastic bag bearing a plain black\nand white ‘‘scale’’ label. Weiss responded that, if prop-\nerly packaged, the product potentially could do well.\nSmulders acknowledged that he did not have any whole-\nsale marketing experience. He further indicated to\nWeiss that he would need Weiss’ assistance in this area\nand that he had approached Weiss because of Weiss’\nolive oil marketing campaign. As a result of this conver-\nsation, the interest of both parties was piqued, and\nthey had numerous subsequent conversations in the\nlate spring or early summer of 2003, in which they\nagreed to work to distribute the granola products.\n  In or around August, 2003, the parties discussed\nworking together as two separate companies to produce\nand distribute the granola products. Smulders also indi-\ncated that they would merge their companies to form\na new enterprise if that relationship proved successful.\nShortly thereafter, Weiss formed Food Works to distrib-\nute Garden of Light’s granola products. In December,\n2003, Garden of Light and Food Works executed a writ-\nten ‘‘Master Distributorship Agreement’’ (distribution\nagreement), the purpose of which was to designate\nFood Works the exclusive distributor of granola prod-\nucts produced by Garden of Light. The distribution\nagreement expressly acknowledged that the parties had\nentered into discussions with respect to the formation\nof a new company. Subsequent to the execution of the\ndistribution agreement and until approximately the time\ntheir relationship ended in 2006, Smulders made\nrepeated representations to Weiss that he would spin\noff his bakery business from Garden of Light, merge it\nwith Food Works, and that he and Weiss would be equal\npartners in the new company, which they referred to\nas ‘‘NEWCO.’’\n   In the period that followed the execution of the distri-\nbution agreement, Weiss wound down his olive oil busi-\nness to focus primarily on the granola products\nbusiness, expending many hours on marketing and\nresearch. Weiss also paid a brand manager $14,000 to\npromote that business. At some point during this period,\nWeiss and Smulders began labeling the granola prod-\nucts with the trade name Bakery on Main. While Food\nWorks purchased and distributed Garden of Light’s gra-\nnola products, Weiss and Smulders continued to main-\ntain their separate companies.\n  In September, 2006, Smulders sent an e-mail to Weiss,\ninforming Weiss that he would not merge companies. At\nthe same time, Smulders sent a letter to Weiss, asserting\nthat Food Works was not in compliance with the distri-\nbution agreement because it had failed to compensate\n\fGarden of Light for products that had been purchased\nfor distribution. As required by the distribution\nagreement, Smulders, acting on behalf of Garden of\nLight, gave Food Works thirty days to cure the breach.\nThereafter, Garden of Light continued to fulfill Food\nWorks’ orders, as it was bound to do under the distribu-\ntion agreement, and Food Works’ debt continued to\naccumulate. After Food Works failed to make full pay-\nment within the thirty day period, Garden of Light for-\nmally terminated the distribution agreement.\n   The record reveals the following procedural history.\nThe plaintiffs commenced this action against the defen-\ndants, alleging in the operative complaint: breach of\noral contract and promissory estoppel as to Smulders;\nbreach of written contract as to Garden of Light; and\nnegligent misrepresentation, intentional misrepresenta-\ntion, and unjust enrichment as to both defendants. The\ndefendants asserted various special defenses and two\ncounterclaims against the plaintiffs, alleging breach of\ncontract and fraudulent misrepresentation.3\n  After the close of evidence, the defendants moved to\ndismiss the plaintiffs’ breach of oral contract count\nin its entirety and portions of the remaining counts,\nincluding the promissory estoppel count, claiming that,\nbecause Weiss had filed for bankruptcy protection sub-\nsequent to the occurrence of some of the events that\nconstituted the claims, those claims belonged to Weiss’\nbankruptcy estate, not to the plaintiffs. The trial court\ndenied the motion, determining with respect to the\npromissory estoppel claim that this claim had not fully\naccrued in December, 2003, when Weiss filed his bank-\nruptcy petition. In reliance on this finding, the court\nconcluded that the plaintiffs, rather than the bankruptcy\ntrustee, had standing to pursue the claim.\n   Thereafter, the court found in favor of the defendants\non all of the plaintiffs’ claims except promissory estop-\npel.4 With respect to that claim, the court found that\nthe plaintiffs had met their burden of establishing that\nSmulders made promises regarding an eventual merger\nof their two companies and that Weiss acted in reliance\non those promises to his detriment. With respect to\nthe defendants’ counterclaims, the court found that the\ndefendants had met their burden of establishing that\nthe plaintiffs breached the distribution agreement by\nfailing to compensate Garden of Light for products that\nthe plaintiffs had purchased for distribution, but found\nin favor of the plaintiffs on the defendants’ claim of\nfraudulent misrepresentation.5\n  With respect to damages, the court awarded the\ndefendants $110,463.50 in principal and interest for the\nplaintiffs’ breach of the distribution agreement. As to\nthe plaintiffs’ damages for promissory estoppel, the\ncourt found that they were entitled to be compensated\nas if the companies had merged as promised and for\ncosts expended on the venture that never came to be.\n\fWith respect to the latter, the court found that Weiss\nwas entitled to one half of the $14,000 that he had paid\nto the brand manager to promote the granola products,\nas he would have benefited from one half of those\nservices as a partner in NEWCO. The court also found\nthat Weiss was entitled to the value of a 50 percent\nshare of NEWCO, but that neither party had offered\nsufficient evidence to demonstrate the value of\nNEWCO. In light of this deficiency, the court deter-\nmined that further evidence of NEWCO’s value was\nnecessary and ordered the parties to return to court to\npresent additional evidence on that issue. Subsequently,\nthe defendants moved to reargue the court’s decision\nto hold the additional hearing, and the plaintiffs moved\nfor reconsideration of the court’s decision that the plain-\ntiffs had failed to present sufficient evidence of\nNEWCO’s value. The trial court granted the defendants’\nmotion, reversing its decision to allow the parties to\nintroduce additional evidence on damages, and denied\nthe plaintiffs’ motion. Thereafter, the plaintiffs and the\ndefendants filed appeals. Additional facts and proce-\ndural history will be set forth as necessary.\n                             I\n  All of the parties raise claims challenging the trial\ncourt’s judgment with respect to the plaintiffs’ promis-\nsory estoppel claim—the defendants on the merits and\nthe plaintiffs on damages. The defendants contend that\nthe plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue the promissory\nestoppel claim because the bankruptcy trustee\nappointed to oversee Weiss’ bankruptcy estate had\nexclusive standing to pursue the claim. The defendants\nfurther contend that, even if the plaintiffs had standing,\nthe court improperly allowed the plaintiffs to recover\non this claim because it contradicted the fully integrated\ndistribution agreement. The plaintiffs dispute both of\nthese contentions and argue with respect to damages\nthat the trial court improperly found that the evidence\nadduced at trial was insufficient to establish the value\nof NEWCO to a reasonable certainty, and improperly\nreversed its decision to hold a posttrial evidentiary hear-\ning on damages. We conclude that the plaintiffs had\nstanding to bring their promissory estoppel claim and\nwere not precluded by the terms of the distribution\nagreement from advancing this claim. Nevertheless, we\nconclude that the trial court properly determined that\nthe plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of proving\ntheir damages with reasonable certainty and properly\ndeclined to allow the plaintiffs to present further evi-\ndence posttrial.\n                            A\n   We first turn to the defendants’ challenge to the plain-\ntiffs’ standing to bring their promissory estoppel claim\nbecause that issue implicates the trial court’s subject\nmatter jurisdiction. Because of the jurisdictional nature\nof the claim, it presents a threshold issue that must be\n\fresolved before any determination of the merits. New\nHartford v. Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">291</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 518, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">583</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2009). The defendants\nargue that the roots of the plaintiffs’ promissory estop-\npel claim arose from prebankruptcy activity. Accord-\ningly, the defendants contend that any cause of action\nbased on a claim of promissory estoppel was property\nbelonging to the bankruptcy estate, and thus the bank-\nruptcy trustee had exclusive standing to pursue that\nclaim. In response, the plaintiffs argue that the trial\ncourt properly determined that the date on which the\nclaim accrues controls, and because the promissory\nestoppel claim accrued after the bankruptcy petition\nwas filed, the claim was the property of Weiss, not the\nbankruptcy estate. The plaintiffs further contend that,\neven if this court were to apply the test that the defen-\ndants advocate, the plaintiffs still would have had stand-\ning under the proper application of that test.6 We agree\nwith the plaintiffs that they had standing irrespective\nof which test applies.\n   The following additional facts found by the trial court\nand procedural history are relevant to this issue.\nBetween 2003 and 2006, Smulders made several prom-\nises to Weiss that they would merge Food Works with\nthe Bakery on Main part of Garden of Light to form the\nnew enterprise known as NEWCO, and that Smulders\nand Weiss would be equal partners. These promises\nwere made in e-mails sent from Smulders to Weiss dated\nAugust 23, 2003, October 28, 2004, and March 17, 2006,\nand in a memorandum authored by Smulders in 2005,\nthat specifically referenced how and when the two com-\npanies would merge into NEWCO.7 Consistent with\nthese promises, Smulders referred to Weiss as his part-\nner on numerous occasions, including in an e-mail to\na potential customer dated April 24, 2005, and in a\nSeptember, 2005 presentation in which he identified\nhimself and Weiss as ‘‘Managing Partners.’’ Until Smuld-\ners renounced his intention to merge the companies in\nSeptember, 2006, Weiss acted in reliance on the prom-\nises to merge the two companies by abandoning his\nolive oil business, spending hundreds of hours on mar-\nketing and research that was not required of him under\nthe distribution agreement, and working to improve\nboth his and Smulders’ businesses.\n   During the period when Weiss was working toward\nthe goal of merging the companies, however, he filed\na voluntary chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in the United\nStates Bankruptcy Court for the District of Connecticut.\nSpecifically, Weiss filed the petition on December 5,\n2003, after Smulders had made his initial promise to\nWeiss, but before the parties had executed the distribu-\ntion agreement and well before Smulders had repudi-\nated the promised merger of the companies. Weiss did\nnot list the distribution agreement or his interest in\nNEWCO in his bankruptcy petition.\n\f   In considering the standing issue raised in this case,\nan issue over which we exercise plenary review; Wilcox\nv.

Therefore, it follows that a cause of action for\npromissory estoppel accrues when the defendant fails\nto fulfill its promise. See Torringford Farms Assn., Inc.\nv. Torrington, supra, 577–78.\n   As we previously indicated, Weiss filed his petition\nfor bankruptcy on December 5, 2003, and Smulders\nrenounced his promise to merge companies in Septem-\nber, 2006. Therefore, under state law, the plaintiffs’\npromissory estoppel claim did not accrue until 2006,\nafter Weiss filed for bankruptcy. Indeed, the defendants\ndo not dispute that, under the accrual date approach,\nthe plaintiffs’ cause of action premised on a promissory\nestoppel claim was not property of the bankruptcy\nestate.\n  We reach the same conclusion by applying the alter-\nnative approach under which federal bankruptcy law\ncontrols. The courts taking this approach have indi-\ncated that a cause of action does not become property\nof the bankruptcy estate merely because it has some\nprepetition roots; rather, the facts forming the cause\nof action determine whether it is sufficiently rooted\nin the prepetition past.

LEXIS 1523, *26\n(B.A.P. 6th Cir. May 10, 2007) (holding legal malpractice\nclaim became part of estate at time of negligence, not\nwhen damages incurred).\n   Irrespective of whether we construe the test strictly\nor expansively, however, the result is the same. The\ntrial court found that promissory estoppel arose from\nWeiss’ detrimental reliance on a series of promises and\nstatements made by Smulders between 2003 and 2006.\nOnly one of those communications occurred before the\nbankruptcy petition was filed—the August, 2003 e-mail.\nThe distribution agreement executed in December,\n2003, however, unequivocally reflects that no firm\npromise to merge the companies had yet been made.\nThat distribution agreement acknowledges that ‘‘[t]he\nparties have entered into discussions with respect to\nthe formation of a new company . . . .’’ (Emphasis\nadded.) Therefore, any promise supporting the promis-\nsory estoppel claim occurred after the petition was\nfiled. Similarly, all of Weiss’ actions demonstrating det-\nrimental reliance and harm occurred postpetition.\nTherefore, even under the sufficiently rooted test, it is\nclear that the plaintiffs’ promissory estoppel claim is\na postpetition asset that was not property of Weiss’\nbankruptcy estate because all of the actions supporting\nthe claim occurred subsequent to the date Weiss filed\nhis bankruptcy petition. Accordingly, we conclude that\nthe plaintiffs had standing to pursue their promissory\nestoppel claim, irrespective of which test applies.\n                            B\n   We next turn to the defendants’ claim that the plain-\ntiffs cannot recover on their promissory estoppel claim\nbecause it contradicts the fully integrated distribution\n\fagreement. Specifically, the defendants point to a\nmerger clause in the distribution agreement, and to\nlanguage therein indicating that any agreement regard-\ning the formation of a new business must be evidenced\nin writing. As such, the defendants argue that the trial\ncourt violated the parol evidence rule by allowing the\nplaintiffs to prevail on their promissory estoppel claim.12\nIn response, the plaintiffs argue that the defendants’\nclaim is unpreserved because they did not object to the\nintroduction of parol evidence at trial or assert that\nthe distribution agreement was fully integrated. The\nplaintiffs further argue that the defendants’ claim never-\ntheless fails on the merits because the subject matter\nof Smulders’ promise to merge companies did not come\nwithin the scope of the distribution agreement. We con-\nclude that, even though the defendants did not directly\nraise this claim at trial, they are permitted to pursue it\non appeal because the trial court addressed this matter.\nSee Practice Book § 60-5 (‘‘[an appellate] court shall\nnot be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly\nraised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial’’\n[emphasis added]); Azia v.

The preface\nto the distribution agreement sets forth several recital\nprovisions, including the following: ‘‘This Master Distri-\nbution Agreement . . . is made and entered into . . .\nwith reference to the following facts . . .\n  ‘‘2. The parties have entered into discussions with\nrespect to the formation of a new company, joint ven-\nture or other similar arrangement which would replace\nthe business arrangement detailed in this [a]greement;\n  ‘‘3.

One such term is a merger\nclause, which provides in relevant part: ‘‘This\n[a]greement contains all of the terms and conditions\n\fagreed upon by the parties hereto with reference to the\nsubject matter hereof. No other agreements, oral or\notherwise, shall be deemed to exist or to bind either\nof the parties hereto, and all prior agreements and\nunderstandings are superseded hereby. . . .’’ (Empha-\nsis added.)\n   We conclude that, even if the distribution agreement\nis fully integrated, the defendants’ claim fails because\nan examination of the distribution agreement clearly\nindicates that the evidence admitted at trial to prove\nthat Smulders promised Weiss that they would merge\ncompanies to form NEWCO is collateral to the subject\nmatter of the distribution agreement. The subject mat-\nter of the distribution agreement is Food Works’ pur-\nchase and distribution of Garden of Light’s products,\nnot the formation of NEWCO. Cf. Perricone v.

All of the substantive rights and\nobligations under the distribution agreement pertain to\nthat distribution agreement. There is no provision in\nthe distribution agreement addressing the parameters\nunder which NEWCO would be created or the parties’\nobligations upon the creation of NEWCO. Indeed, the\ntrial court’s finding that the distribution agreement\nmerely pertained to the distribution relationship is\nwholly consistent with the title of the agreement—\n’’Master Distributorship Agreement’’—and the obliga-\ntions imposed thereunder.\n   The only reference to the future formation of the\nnew company is in the recital provisions. The related\nlanguage in the recital on which the defendants rely\nthat addresses the new venture being ‘‘finalized and\nevidenced by written agreement(s),’’ however, appears\nto conflict with substantive provisions of the distribu-\ntion agreement. Specifically, the recital indicates that\nFood Works will continue as distributor unless and until\na new company or joint venture has been finalized. The\nsubstantive provision pertaining to the duration of the\ncontract states that the agreement is to last for three\nyears from the date of execution ‘‘[u]nless sooner termi-\n\fnated in accordance with the provisions of [a]rticle 9\n[Termination].’’ Article 9 enumerates specific grounds\non which either party may terminate the agreement,\nnone of which includes the formation of NEWCO or\nany other joint venture. Any conflict between the recital\nprovisions and the substantive terms of the distribution\nagreement is resolved by the fact that the subject matter\nof the distribution agreement is the distribution rela-\ntionship between the parties. As such, the substantive\nprovisions regarding the duration and termination of\nthat matter necessarily would control over what is evi-\ndently a collateral matter.13 See McKinnon v.

In light of these considerations, it is apparent\nthat the formation of NEWCO was collateral to the\nsubject matter of the distribution agreement. Therefore,\nthe trial court properly admitted evidence to prove\nSmulders’ promises to Weiss because such evidence\ndid not vary the terms of the writing contained in the\ndistribution agreement.\n                             C\n   Having disposed of the defendants’ appeal contesting\nthe merits of the plaintiffs’ promissory estoppel claim,\nwe turn to the plaintiffs’ claims in their appeal regarding\ndamages on that claim. The plaintiffs contend that the\ntrial court improperly concluded that they failed to\nprove the value of the merged company with reasonable\ncertainty because their expert was entitled to rely on\nreasonable assumptions in assigning a valuation to\nNEWCO. In response, the defendants argue that the\ntrial court properly decided that the plaintiffs had failed\nto prove the value of NEWCO because they valued\nthe wrong entity during the wrong time period. We\nconclude that the plaintiffs failed to meet their burden\nbecause they did not produce evidence valuing a com-\npany that is substantially similar to what NEWCO would\nhave been to form a comparative basis on which to\nprove damages.\n   The legal principles that govern our review of damage\nawards are well established. ‘‘It is axiomatic that the\nburden of proving damages is on the party claiming\nthem. . . .

To\ndemonstrate damages in support of their claim of prom-\nissory estoppel, the plaintiffs proffered expert testi-\nmony from Richard A. Royston, a forensic accountant,\nand a report prepared by Royston. Royston testified\nthat he had been asked by the plaintiffs to perform an\nappraisal of the value of Garden of Light and to calculate\na valuation of a 50 percent share of the company on\nas late a date as possible. Royston’s calculation was\npremised on the company’s value as of December 31,\n2008. To value Garden of Light, Royston used the capi-\ntalization of earnings methodology, which values an\nentity by its sales and profits and does not take physical\nassets into account. See West Haven Sound Develop-\nment Corp. v. West Haven, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">201</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 329, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">734</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986) (‘‘[w]hile there are several different methods\nby which to determine the value of a closely-held corpo-\nration, these methods, and their variants, are of two\ngeneral types: [1] capitalization of earnings, or the net\npresent value of a future income stream; and [2] net\nasset value, or the present sale price of the business\nassets less its liabilities’’).\n   Royston derived his valuation determination by first\nexamining Garden of Light’s gross sales and profits, as\nstated in its federal income tax returns from 2003 to\n2008. Royston testified that he had observed a sharp\nincrease in Garden of Light’s sales from 2006 to 2008,\nin which the annual sales almost doubled, and that he\nfocused on that increase in carrying out his valuation.\nHe also stated that there was a corresponding increase\n\fin gross profits as well. Royston then made two deduc-\ntions in the company’s value: to account for its market-\nability; and to address the fact that there would be a\nlack of control of the company due to the nonmajority\n50 percent share that Weiss expected he would obtain.\nTaking all of the information into account, Royston\nopined that the market value of Garden of Light in its\nentirety was $720,000, and thus a 50 percent share\nwould be valued at $360,000.\n  Royston further testified that he had requested infor-\nmation from Smulders and Weiss to segregate the gro-\ncery store operations of Garden of Light from the\ngranola products of Bakery on Main, but neither Weiss\nnor Smulders had such information. He testified that\nhe used the capitalization of earnings methodology\nbecause he was unable to distinguish between the\nincome of the grocery stores and the income of Bakery\non Main, and thus was unable to come up with a compa-\nrable peer group of companies to compare with NEWCO\nin order to extrapolate its value, which would have\nbeen an alternative market-based method of valuing\nNEWCO.\n  On cross-examination, Royston testified that he did\nnot take Weiss’ bankruptcy into account in valuing Gar-\nden of Light and that Weiss’ poor credit could have had\nan impact on NEWCO’s ability to take out future loans.\nRoyston further admitted that, although he understood\nthat NEWCO would be comprised of the Bakery on\nMain division of Garden of Light and Food Works, he\ndid not value the merged entity. Further, Royston stated\nthat he was not given any financial data for Food Works,\nnor did he value that company. He also admitted that\nto perform a valuation of NEWCO, it would have been\nextremely helpful to have the value of Food Works and\nthe value of Bakery on Main, rather than the value of\nGarden of Light in its entirety. Although Royston did\nnot value Bakery on Main separately, he opined that\nthe grocery stores were not a material part of Garden\nof Light’s value. In support of this conclusion, Royston\npointed to three facts: a sharp increase in marketing\nexpenses that he attributed to Bakery on Main; a two-\nfold increase in Garden of Light’s business between\n2006 and 2007; and the arrival of a competing natural\nfoods store in 2008. Royston reasoned that the volume\nof business at one of the grocery store locations was\ndowntrending due to the competition and, therefore,\nthe increase in Garden of Light’s business was due to\nBakery on Main’s granola business rather than the gro-\ncery stores.\n  In its memorandum of decision, the trial court found\nthat there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the\nvalue of NEWCO. The court agreed with the defendants\nthat Royston’s valuation was flawed because it did not\nmeasure the value of NEWCO, which was to consist\nof Food Works and Bakery on Main. The court first\n\fdetermined that the value of the merged company likely\nwould be different than the value of Garden of Light.\nThe court reasoned that Garden of Light included two\ngrocery stores that were not intended to be included\nin NEWCO. Therefore, the court determined that any\nvalue those stores contributed or detracted from the\n$720,000 valuation should not have been considered in\nthe calculation of damages. The court also pointed to\nthe following factors that were not accounted for in\nthat valuation by Royston’s own admission: Weiss’ par-\nticipation as a co-owner of NEWCO would have likely\nlessened the value of NEWCO based on his poor credit;\nand the value of Food Works, for which no evidence\nhad been produced, would need to be measured and\nincluded in the value of NEWCO.\n  Applying the aforementioned damages principles to\nthe facts in the present case, we conclude that, for\nprecisely the reasons identified by the trial court, the\nevidence presented at trial was inadequate to establish\nthe value of NEWCO with as much reasonable certainty\nas the case permitted. The plaintiffs contend, however,\nthat they may prove their damages by comparing the\nvalue of a comparable business, which they did when\nthey valued Garden of Light.

Schatz & Schatz, Ribicoff & Kotkin,\nsupra, 74. As such, the plaintiffs had the burden of\nestablishing that Garden of Light and NEWCO were\nsubstantially similar companies.\n   There are two readily apparent deficiencies in the\nplaintiffs’ evidence: (1) the value of Garden of Light\nincluded the sales and profits of the two grocery stores\nthat would not be part of NEWCO; and (2) the value\nof Garden of Light did not include the value of Food\nWorks, which would be part of NEWCO. Royston\nacknowledged that he would need to account for both of\nthese facts to properly determine the value of NEWCO.\nThus, although a damages theory may be based on\nassumptions, those assumptions must be reasonable in\nlight of the record evidence. Id., 70. A simple measure-\nment of a different, albeit related, company is not\nenough for the court to make a reasonable estimation\nof the value of a 50 percent share of NEWCO when\nthere were significant differences between Garden of\nLight and NEWCO.\n  Although Royston testified on cross-examination that\n\fGarden of Light’s two grocery stores were not a material\npart of the company, he did not provide the court with\nsufficient, credible evidence to support this conclusion.\nRoyston assumed that Garden of Light’s drastic increase\nin profits between 2006 and 2008 was due to Bakery\non Main’s success because the company’s marketing\nexpenses were higher than in previous years and\nbecause a new competing grocery store opened in 2008.\nCorrelation, however, is not causation. More fundamen-\ntally, even if that increase could be attributable solely\nto Bakery on Main that fact does not account for what\nportion of Garden of Light’s value prior to this increase\nwas attributable to the grocery stores. Accordingly, the\nplaintiffs did not ‘‘lay a foundation [that would] enable\nthe trier to make a fair and reasonable estimate’’ of the\ndamages. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Ameri-\ncan Diamond Exchange, Inc. v. Alpert, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">302</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n   Nonetheless, the plaintiffs argue that the evidence is\nreasonable in light of the fact that Royston testified\nthat he had asked for information that would allow him\nto separate the sales of the two grocery stores from\nBakery on Main, but was unable to obtain such informa-\ntion. We reject this argument for two reasons. First,\nduring his testimony, Royston repeatedly stated that he\nwas engaged to value Garden of Light, not an entity\ncomprised of Food Works and Bakery on Main. Indeed,\nthe plaintiffs do not claim that they made any attempt\nto gather such evidence from the defendants, other than\npointing to Royston’s statement at trial. Second, even\nif we were to excuse the plaintiffs from offering more\ndefinite proof by virtue of the defendants’ failure to\nprovide Royston with such information, the plaintiffs\nnevertheless failed to take into account the value of\nFood Works. Royston testified that he did not have any\nknowledge of Food Works’ sales and profits for any\npoint during the relevant time period and that he could\nnot opine on the value of the company. Although Roys-\nton opined that Food Works’ value in 2006 would not\nimpact his valuation of Garden of Light in 2008, assum-\ning that Food Works had no assets and that all of its\ncustomers and sales were absorbed by Garden of Light,\nthis assumption appears to be pure speculation as it\nwas not supported by any objective facts, figures, or\ndata, nor was there any testimony to the effect that\nsuch data were not available. Therefore, the plaintiffs’\nfailure to produce evidence of the value of Food Works,\nwhich we must assume was readily available to them,\nrequires us to conclude that they have not met their\nburden of establishing the value of NEWCO with reason-\nable certainty.\n   Finally, the plaintiffs cite an Appellate Court case for\nthe proposition that doubts as to exact amounts of\ndamages are generally resolved against the parties in\nbreach and thus any uncertainty in their damages calcu-\nlation should be resolved against the defendants. See\n\fMessage Center Management, Inc. v. Shell Oil Products\nCo., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.

This\nprinciple may only be invoked, however, once the plain-\ntiffs have demonstrated the amount of damages with\nreasonable certainty, which the plaintiffs have failed\nto do. See 3 Restatement (Second), Contracts § 352,\ncomment (a), pp. 144–45 (1981) (noting while doubts\nin amount of damages are resolved against party in\nbreach, to prevent windfalls plaintiff must still prove\namount with reasonable certainty). In light of the afore-\nmentioned considerations, we conclude that the trial\ncourt’s finding that the plaintiffs failed to prove their\ndamages with reasonable certainty with respect to the\nvalue of NEWCO was not clearly erroneous.14\n                             D\n   In light of our conclusion in part I C of this opinion\nas to the evidentiary deficiency, we must address the\nplaintiffs’ claim that the trial court improperly granted\nthe defendants’ motion for reargument and reversed\nits decision to hold a posttrial evidentiary hearing on\ndamages.15 Specifically, the plaintiffs claim that the trial\ncourt improperly relied on the fact that the case had\nbeen pending for five years before trial in the absence\nof a finding that the alleged delay was the plaintiffs’\nfault, and failed to consider that its decision would have\nthe effect of precluding the plaintiffs from providing\nthe court with a sufficient basis on which to award\ndamages. We disagree.\n   We review the trial court’s decision to not reopen\nevidence for a hearing on damages under the abuse of\ndiscretion standard. See, e.g., Wood v. Bridgeport, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">216</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">604</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 606, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">583</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1990) (‘‘[w]hether . . .\na trial court will permit further evidence to be offered\nafter the close of testimony in a case is a matter resting\nin the sound discretion of the court’’ [internal quotation\nmarks omitted]).

We do\nnot construe the trial court’s decision as punishing the\nplaintiffs for delaying the commencement of trial.\nRather, the court simply determined that the plaintiffs\nhad ample opportunity to obtain evidence, through dis-\ncovery or otherwise, pertaining to their alleged damages\nin the years preceding the trial. The court was entitled\nto presume that the plaintiffs were prepared to present\ntheir case when trial commenced. The plaintiffs did not\n\frequest a continuance or seek sanctions due to the\ndefendants’ failure to comply with discovery requests\nto obtain evidence relating to valuation. Indeed, the\ntrial court sua sponte ordered further evidentiary pro-\nceedings after the close of evidence. When a party has\nbeen afforded ample opportunity to obtain and present\nevidence, a trial court acts well within its discretion to\ndecline to allow that party to obtain a conclusive ruling\nas to whether the evidence presented satisfied the par-\nty’s burden of proof, and then to reopen the evidentiary\nportion of the trial in order to present further evidence\nif the ruling is adverse. Accordingly, given the facts and\ncircumstances of this case, we cannot conclude that\nthe trial court abused its discretion in granting the\ndefendants’ motion to reargue and reversing its sua\nsponte decision to hold a posttrial evidentiary hearing\non damages.\n                            II\n   Finally, we turn to the plaintiffs’ claim that the trial\ncourt improperly rendered judgment for the defendants\non their breach of contract counterclaim due to Food\nWorks’ failure to pay for certain granola products\nreceived from Garden of Light. The plaintiffs contend\nthat they were discharged from their obligations\nbecause the defendants committed prior material\nbreaches of the distribution agreement. Specifically,\nthey argue that they presented evidence that the defen-\ndants had made direct sales to customers outside of\nthe Garden of Light stores in breach of the provisions\nin the distribution agreement under which Food Works\nwas deemed the sole distributor of Bakery on Main\nproducts and Garden of Light was afforded the limited\nright to sell such products only in direct sales in its\ntwo stores. The evidence indicated that Garden of Light\nhad made approximately $10,000 in direct sales of its\nproducts to customers over the Internet, but refused\nto share the revenue generated with Food Works.16 In\nresponse, the defendants argue that the plaintiffs were\nnot discharged from their obligations under the distribu-\ntion agreement because: (1) the alleged breaches were\nnot material; and (2) the plaintiffs failed to give written\nnotice to the defendants of these alleged breaches as\nrequired by the distribution agreement.17 With respect\nto the latter, the defendants point to the trial court’s\nrejection of the plaintiffs’ breach of contract claim on\nthe basis of its finding that the plaintiffs had failed to\nabide by the terms of the distribution agreement for\nnotification of breach. We conclude that, even if the\ndefendants’ alleged breaches were material, the plain-\ntiffs’ failure to notify the defendants of the breaches\nand to provide them with an opportunity to cure them\nin accordance with the provisions of the distribution\nagreement precludes them from raising this defense.\n  Under contract law, it is well settled that a material\nbreach by one party discharges the other party’s subse-\n\fquent duty to perform on the contract.

In reliance upon this\nfact, the trial court held that the plaintiffs could not\nsucceed on their claim for breach of the agreement\nbecause they had failed to abide by the terms of the\ndistribution agreement. ‘‘Where the language of the con-\ntract is clear and unambiguous, the contract is to be\ngiven effect according to its terms.’’ (Internal quotation\nmarks omitted.)

The Supreme Court contrasted future wages\nor expected bequests, even though those might be transferable under state\nlaw, because they would nonetheless not be called property within the\nmeaning of the bankruptcy provisions then in effect as that would defeat\nthe fresh start policy embodied in the bankruptcy discharge.

If the\nagreement proper is ambiguous, then the recitals may be of value in constru-\ning the same.’’). In light of our conclusion that the formation of NEWCO is\ncollateral to the subject matter of the distribution agreement, and because\nthe substantive provisions do not refer to the particular language in the\nrecitals nor is the language of the distribution agreement ambiguous, we\nneed not analyze or adopt any of these additional rules.\n   14\n      In light of our conclusion that the plaintiffs failed to meet their burden\nbecause the valuation of Garden of Light included its two grocery stores\nand excluded the value of Food Works, we do not address the plaintiffs’\nargument that the trial court improperly found that Weiss’ participation as\na co-owner of NEWCO would likely have lessened its value as we do not\nrely on that factor. Similarly, in light of our conclusion, we need not address\nthe defendants’ argument that the plaintiffs presented improper evidence\nof the value of NEWCO by including sales and profits of Garden of Light\nfrom the time period of 2006 through 2008, after Smulders had breached\nhis promise to Weiss.\n   15\n      In their motion for reargument, the defendants contended both that the\ntrial court lacked authority to reopen the evidence and that they would be\nprejudiced by a reopening of the evidence. The trial court did not address\neither argument specifically, and the defendants have not argued in their\nbrief to this court as an alternative ground to affirm the trial court’s decision\nthat it lacked authority to reopen the evidence. Therefore, we do not address\nthis issue.\n   16\n      The plaintiffs also contend that the defendants made approximately\n$100 of sales in person outside of its stores. These sales must be deemed\nde minimis by any standard, and therefore we do not consider them.\n   17\n      Additionally, the defendants argue that this claim is barred because the\nplaintiffs did not plead prior material breach as a separate special defense\nas required by Practice Book § 10-50. The defendants have raised this claim\nfor the first time on appeal. In light of well settled law that ‘‘the failure to\nfile a special defense may be treated as waived when no objection has been\nraised to the offer of evidence on the issue’’; Pepe v. New Britain, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">203</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">281</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 286, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">629</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987); see also Schilberg Integrated Metals Corp. v.\nContinental Casualty Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">263</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">245</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 273, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">819</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">773</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2003); it is\nevident that the defendants are not entitled to review of this issue on appeal.\n   18\n      The distribution agreement provides in relevant part: ‘‘[E]ither party\nmay terminate this [a]greement for failure by the other party to perform or\nadhere to any of its obligations under this [a]greement by notifying the other\nparty of such default and allowing the other party thirty (30) days within\nwhich to cure such default.’’\n   19\n      The plaintiffs further claim that the trial court improperly rendered\njudgment for the defendants on their breach of contract counterclaim\nbecause the defendants had unclean hands, arguing that: (1) in rendering\njudgment for the plaintiffs on their promissory estoppel claim, the trial court\nfound that Smulders had induced Weiss to make significant sacrifices for\nthe benefit of Garden of Light in reliance on Smulders’ promise to merge\ncompanies; and (2) Garden of Light repeatedly breached the distribution\nagreement by making direct sales to customers. We reject the plaintiffs’\nargument for two reasons. First, the equitable defense of unclean hands\nbars only equitable relief. See, e.g., Thompson v. Orcutt, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 308,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">777</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">670</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001); Eldridge v.

The defen-\ndants sought a legal remedy in the form of money damages for their breach\nof contract counterclaim. Second, the plaintiffs have not demonstrated on\nthe record that the defendants engaged in ‘‘wilful misconduct . . . so as\nto invoke the equitable maxim as claimed.’’ DeCecco v. Beach, supra, 35;\nsee also A & B Auto Salvage, Inc. v. Zoning Board of Appeals, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1901065\"><a href=\"/opinion/1901065/a-b-auto-salvage-inc-v-zoning-board-of-appeals/\"><span class=\"volume\">189</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">573</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 578, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1187</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1983). Indeed, Smulders testified that he would\nhave cured a breach had he been notified of one. Accordingly, the trial court\ndid not abuse its discretion in rejecting the plaintiffs’ defense. See Thompson\nv. Orcutt, supra, 308 (noting application of unclean hands doctrine rests\nwithin sound discretion of trial court).\n\f</pre>",
