In its first two issues,\n\nthe State asserts that the trial court abused its discretion when it admitted the\n\ntestimony of the Chana’s real estate appraisal expert. The State’s third issue\n\nchallenges the admission of certain comparable land sales, and the State’s fourth\n\nissue assails the trial court’s exclusion of records from a tax-protest hearing in\n\nwhich the Chanas challenged the taxes assessed for the property.\n\n      We affirm.\n\n                                   Background\n\n      Jasdeep Singh Chana, Manjit Singh Chana, and Amar Pal Singh Chana (“the\n\nChanas”) owned a 7.765-acre tract of vacant land in Harris County, Texas. The\n\nland sat at the intersection of FM 529 and Enchanted Creek Drive in Katy, Texas.\n\nThe rectangular-shaped tract was bounded by FM 529 on its northern side and\n\nEnchanted Creek Drive on its western side. The tract’s eastern side was bounded\n\nby Dinner Creek.      Behind the tract’s southern property line was a housing\n\nsubdivision.\n\n      In 2010, the State sought to obtain 2.385 acres out of the 7.765-acre tract for\n\nthe construction of a detention pond, needed as part of the roadway expansion of\n\nFM 529. The State planned to construct the detention pond on the eastern most\n\n                                         2\n\fpart of the Chanas’ property next to Dinner Creek. The Chanas requested the State\n\nto decrease the size of the taking to permit the Chanas’s remaining 5.693 acres of\n\nland to maintain access to Dinner creek for drainage and detention purposes. The\n\nState agreed and shifted the back boundary of the taking 30 feet forward to the\n\nnorth. This gave the Chanas a strip of land behind the State’s taking, which\n\nconnected the remainder of their property to Dinner Creek, allowing for future\n\ndrainage and water detention. After this change, the amount of land condemned by\n\nthe State for construction of the detention pond was reduced from 2.385 acres to\n\nthe 2.072 acres.\n\n      The State petitioned the county court to condemn the 2.072 acres to use in\n\nconjunction with TxDOT’s roadway expansion of FM 529. The county court\n\nappointed three special commissioners to determine the fair market value of the\n\nland. Following a hearing, the commissioners awarded the Chanas $722,176.00.\n\nThe State objected to the award and requested a jury trial. On November 29, 2010,\n\nthe State deposited the full amount of the commissioner’s award into the court’s\n\nregistry, thereby establishing the date of the taking and the date that the State\n\nacquired the 2.072 acres of land.\n\n      The case proceeded to trial before a jury for a determination of the amount\n\nof money due the Chanas for the 2.072 acres of land condemned by the State for its\n\n                                        3\n\froadway-expansion project. Each side offered the testimony of its own real-estate\n\nappraisal expert to show the fair market value of the property as of November 29,\n\n2010.\n\n        The State filed a pre-trial motion to exclude the testimony of the Chanas’\n\nreal-estate appraisal expert, Mark Sikes. The trial court denied the motion and,\n\nover the State’s continued objections at trial, permitted Sikes to testify. Sikes\n\ntestified that the highest and best use for the Chanas’ 7.765-acre piece of land was\n\nto divide it into three separate, independent land parcels or “economic units” for\n\ncommercial development. He opined that the 2.072 acres taken by the State would\n\nbe part of a 2.385-acre self-sufficient economic unit. Located on the eastern most\n\nside of the Chanas’ property, this rectangular-shaped economic unit was fronted on\n\nits northern side by FM 529, a major thoroughfare. The economic unit had Dinner\n\nCreek on its eastern boundary, the Chanas’ remaining property on its western\n\nboundary—which Sikes opined should be divided into two other self-sufficient\n\neconomic units—and a housing subdivision behind its southern boundary.\n\nAlthough he testified that the Chanas’ remaining property could be divided into\n\ntwo additional economic units, Sikes testified that he did not appraise those\n\neconomic units because he had been retained to appraise only the property\n\ncondemned by the State, which was part of the eastern economic unit.\n\n                                         4\n\f      Sikes acknowledged that the economic unit, containing the condemned\n\nproperty, mirrored the dimensions of the parcel of land that the State had originally\n\nplanned to condemn before agreeing to permit the Chanas to retain a 30-foot strip\n\nat the back of the property for drainage purposes. Sikes testified that the 2.385-\n\nacre economic unit was independent of, and could be marketed and sold separately\n\nfrom, the remaining land owned by the Chanas.\n\n      According to Sikes, the highest and best use of the 2.385-acre economic unit\n\nwould be commercial development. Sikes testified that, both before and after the\n\ncondemnation in this case, the commercial real-estate market was active in the area\n\nwhere the Chanas’ property is located. He stated that there had been commercial\n\ndevelopment of properties to the east and to the west of the land. Sikes pointed out\n\nthat the Chanas’ property was located less than a mile from the major intersection\n\nof Fry Road and FM 529. This intersection had been commercially developed with\n\nnationally recognized stores and a bank. Sikes testified that these businesses\n\ngenerated traffic and that the Chanas’s property was in the “sphere of influence” of\n\nthat intersection. Sikes also stated that, in the last decade, there had been a growth\n\nof housing subdivisions in that area, which provided a residential base for\n\ncommercial property.      According to Sikes, there had been “quite a bit” of\n\nresidential development around the Chanas’ property, and it sat at “one of the\n\n                                          5\n\fprimary commercial thoroughfares that provides access to that residential\n\nproperty.”\n\n      In forming his opinion, Sikes relied on the sale of 10 properties, which he\n\naverred were comparable to the condemned property. He testified that he had\n\nbased his conclusion that the condemned property could be sold as part of a\n\nseparate 2.385-acre economic unit for commercial development on these property\n\nsales. He stated that these comparable properties were in the area surrounding the\n\nChanas’ property. Eight of the ten properties were less than one mile from the\n\nChanas’ property and two were slightly further away. The sales of these 10\n\nproperties occurred between June 2006 and November 2011. These properties\n\nranged in size from .776 acres to 2.939 acres in size. The sales price of these\n\nproperties ranged from $7.70 to $20.00 per square foot. Sikes stated that it is\n\nunusual for him as an appraiser to find so many property sales in such close\n\nproximity to the property that is the subject of appraisal. Sikes stated that this\n\nindicated that real estate, sold as smaller economic units for commercial develop,\n\nwas in demand in the area of the Chanas’ property.\n\n      A few of the properties relied on by Sikes to appraise the subject property\n\nhad been subdivided from larger tracts of land and then sold as separate economic\n\nunits for commercial development. With regard to the area where the Chana’s\n\n                                        6\n\fproperty was located, Sikes testified that “everybody’s selling and developing\n\nsmaller tracts out of larger tracts. I think that the highest and best use of the\n\nChanas’ [property] would be the exact same, what the market is doing.” Sikes\n\ntestified that he did not find property along FM 529 being sold as large seven acre\n\ntracts of land. Rather, he stated that landowners in the area were dividing their\n\nproperty and selling off smaller economic units.\n\n      On cross-examination, Sikes acknowledged that the 10 properties he utilized\n\nas comparable properties were either located on a corner or had access to two\n\nmajor thoroughfares. In comparison, the 2.385-acre economic unit defined by\n\nSikes on the Chanas’ property had frontage on one major thoroughfare, FM 529,\n\nand was located “mid-block” with the nearest intersection being FM 529 and\n\nEnchanted Forest, a street accessing a housing subdivision.               Sikes also\n\nacknowledged that some of the comparable properties had more infrastructure and\n\nutilities in place than the economic unit he had defined.\n\n      Sikes explained, however, that appraising real estate is an art, not a science,\n\nentailing a subjective, qualitative analysis. He stated that an appraiser looks at the\n\nmarketplace to find comparable properties.           He indicated that, the more\n\ncomparable properties an appraiser had to analyze, the better his analysis would be.\n\nSikes explained that, when a comparable property differs in terms of location, size,\n\n                                          7\n\futility availability, access, and frontage from the subject property being appraised,\n\nan appraiser makes adjustments to the valuation of the subject property.\n\n      Sikes testified that, if he were to value the property taken by the State as a\n\npart of the Chanas’ whole 7.765-acre tract, then he would not be valuing the\n\nproperty at its highest and best use. Sikes explained that property sells for more\n\nmoney per square foot when it is sold as a smaller tract of land. Sikes stated that,\n\nas a certified real estate appraiser, it was his job to determine the highest and best\n\nuse of the Chana’s property.\n\n      Based on his analysis, Sikes testified that the 2.385-acre economic unit,\n\ncontaining the condemned land, was worth $9.50 per square foot. Thus, the total\n\nvalue for the whole 2.385-acre economic unit would be $986,927.                 After\n\ndiscounting the portion of the economic unit that was not part of the condemnation,\n\nSikes testified that his “compensation estimate,” that is, the amount owed the\n\nChanas for the fair market value of the 2.072 acres acquired by the State, was\n\n$922,256.\n\n      At trial, the State offered the testimony of David Dominy, a certified real\n\nestate appraiser. He testified that, in his opinion, the Chanas’ property should be\n\nvalued as one whole 7.765-acre piece of property and that the subject property\n\ntaken by the State should be valued as a part of that whole. According to Dominy,\n\n                                          8\n\fthe market, in 2010, did not support dividing the Chanas’ property into separate\n\neconomic units.\n\n      According to Dominy, the highest and best use of the Chanas’ property was\n\n“future commercial development” after “some of the other vacant land in the\n\nmarket’s been absorbed and developed.” He stated, “[T]hen, at that point in time I\n\nbelieve commercial development would be viable.”\n\n      Dominy acknowledged that, in the area of the subject property, it had been a\n\ncommon practice to carve out and sell smaller economic units from larger tracts of\n\nland. But Dominy did not believe that, in 2010, this had been a viable option for\n\nthe Chana’s property. Dominy pointed out that there were large tracts of land\n\naround the Chanas’ property, which were vacant. Dominy emphasized that the\n\nsubject property also did not have much infrastructure in place. Because of the\n\nlack of infrastructure, Dominy indicated that the subject property was not\n\ncomparable to certain properties in the area that had been carved out of larger tracts\n\nof land and sold as separate economic units for as much as $20.00 a square foot.\n\nWhen asked, Dominy opined that some of the comparable properties utilized by\n\nSikes in his appraisal were not comparable to the subject property.          Dominy\n\nindicated that these other properties had more infrastructures in place than the\n\nsubject property and were more marketable as independent economic units.\n\n                                          9\n\f      To formulate his appraisal of the condemned property, Dominy relied on\n\ninformation from the sale of five properties, which he opined were comparable to\n\nthe Chanas’ property. Dominy utilized two of the same property sales as Sikes had\n\nused. The five properties relied on by Dominy ranged in size from .786 acres to\n\n4.813 acres in size. The sales price of these properties ranged from $3.67 to\n\n$12.95 per square foot.\n\n      Based on his analysis, utilizing the five comparable land sales, Dominy\n\nopined that the Chanas’ 7.76-acre tract was worth $5.00 per square foot. Using\n\nthat figure, Dominy explained the additional calculations he performed to arrive at\n\nthe amount owed the Chanas’ to compensate them for the State’s condemnation of\n\nthe 2.072 acres of their property. Dominy testified that, in his opinion, the total\n\ncompensation owed the Chanas’ was $484,735.00.\n\n      The jury was presented the following question: “What do you determine to\n\nbe the just compensation owed to the Chanas for the value of the part taken and\n\ndamages to the remainder as of November 29, 2010?” The jury responded by\n\nawarding the Chanas $922,256.000, which is the same amount as Sikes had\n\ntestified was owed to the Chanas.\n\n      The trial court rendered judgment on the jury’s verdict.        This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                                        10\n\f      On appeal, the State identifies four issues. In its first two issues, the State\n\nasserts that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting Sikes’ expert\n\ntestimony regarding the value of the condemned property. Relatedly, in its third\n\nissue, the State complains that the trial court erred by admitting documentary\n\nevidence of five of the comparable property sales relied on by Sikes in forming his\n\nappraisal of the condemned property. Lastly, in its fourth issue, the State asserts\n\nthat the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to admit a statement from a tax-\n\nprotest hearing in 2010 at which the Chanas had sought to lower the tax assessed\n\nvalue on the 7.765-acre tract.\n\n                   Admissibility of Sikes’s Opinion Testimony\n\n      In issues one and two, the State claims that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by admitting Sikes’s opinion testimony regarding the compensation\n\nowed to the Chanas as a result of the State’s taking.\n\nA. Standards Applicable to Expert Opinion Evidence\n\n      If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge would assist the jury,\n\na witness who is qualified as an expert by “knowledge, skill, experience, training,\n\nor education” may testify as an expert. TEX. R. EVID. 702. Such expert witness\n\n“may testify . . . in the form of an opinion or otherwise.” Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\f      The proponent of the expert’s testimony bears the burden of showing that\n\nthe expert’s testimony is relevant and rests on a “reliable foundation.” E.I. du Pont\n\nde Nemours & Co. v. Robinson, 923 S.W.2d 549, 556 (Tex. 1995) (adopting\n\nanalysis of Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 589–90, 113 S.\n\nCt. 2786, 2795, (1993)). The trial court must make the threshold determination of\n\nwhether the testimony meets both the relevancy and reliability standards for\n\nadmissibility under Rule 702. Robinson, 923 S.W.2d at 557. We review the trial\n\ncourt’s decision to admit the testimony for an abuse of discretion. Whirlpool Corp.\n\nv. Camacho, 298 S.W.3d 631, 638 (Tex. 2009).               Serving as an evidentiary\n\ngatekeeper by screening out irrelevant and unreliable expert evidence, the trial\n\ncourt has broad discretion to determine the admissibility of that evidence.\n\nRobinson, 923 S.W.2d 549 at 558. A court abuses its discretion when it acts\n\nwithout reference to any guiding rules or principles. Id\n\n      Appraisal expertise—as involved in this case—is a form of “‘specialized\n\nknowledge [used to] assist the trier of fact to determine a fact in issue.’”\n\nGuadalupe–Blanco River Auth. v. Kraft, 77 S.W.3d 805, 807 (Tex. 2002) (quoting\n\nTEX. R. EVID. 702). Thus, to be admissible, an appraisal expert’s opinion must be\n\nrelevant and reliable. See id.\n\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\f      The relevance requirement, which incorporates traditional relevancy analysis\n\nunder Rules of Evidence 401 and 402, is met if the expert testimony is “sufficiently\n\ntied to the facts of the case that it will aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute.”\n\nRobinson, 923 S.W.2d at 556. Evidence that has no relationship to any issue in the\n\ncase does not satisfy Rule 702; it is thus inadmissible under Rule 702, as well as\n\nunder Rules 401 and 402. Id.\n\n      Rule 702’s reliability requirement centers on the principles, research, and\n\nmethodology underlying an expert’s conclusions. Exxon Pipeline Co. v. Zwahr, 88\n\nS.W.3d 623, 629 (Tex. 2002).         “Under this requirement, expert testimony is\n\nunreliable if it is not grounded ‘in the methods and procedures of science’ and is no\n\nmore than ‘subjective belief or unsupported speculation.’” Id. (quoting Robinson,\n\n923 S.W.2d at 557). If an expert relies on unreliable foundational data, any\n\nopinion drawn from that data likewise is unreliable. Helena Chem. Co. v. Wilkins,\n\n47 S.W.3d 486, 499 (Tex. 2001) (citing Merrell Dow Pharm ., Inc. v. Havner, 953\n\nS.W.2d 706, 714 (Tex. 1997)). Expert testimony also is unreliable if “there is too\n\ngreat an analytical gap between the data the expert relies upon and the opinion\n\noffered.” Zwahr, 88 S.W.3d at 629.\n\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\fB. Project-Enhancement Rule\n\n      The State asserts, “Sikes’s opinion impermissibly relies on project\n\nenhancement because his economic unit is defined by the State’s parameters of its\n\nacquisition area; therefore, his opinion is unreliable and inadmissible under Texas\n\nRule of Evidence 702.” In support of this assertion, the State relies on Exxon\n\nPipeline Company v. Zwahr, 88 S.W.3d 623 (Tex. 2002).\n\n      In Zwahr, the supreme court determined whether the trial court had abused\n\nits discretion in admitting the opinion testimony of Brad Kangieser, a real estate\n\nappraisal expert.   See id. at 626. Kangieser testified regarding the fair market\n\nvalue of a pipeline easement taken by condemnation by Exxon. See id. The\n\nsupreme court restated the well-established legal standards applicable to valuing\n\nreal property in a condemnation proceeding:\n\n      Compensation for land taken by eminent domain is measured by the\n      fair-market value of the land at the time of the taking. The general\n      rule for determining fair-market value is the before-and-after rule,\n      which requires measuring the difference in the value of the land\n      immediately before and immediately after the taking. When, as here,\n      only part of the land is taken for an easement, a partial taking occurs.\n      In this situation, the before-and-after rule still applies, but\n      compensation is measured by the market value of the part taken plus\n      any diminution in value to the remainder of the land.\n\n            In determining market value, the project-enhancement rule\n      provides that the factfinder may not consider any enhancement to the\n      value of the land-owner’s property that results from the taking itself.\n      This is because the objective of the judicial process in the\n                                        14\n\f      condemnation context is to make the landowner whole.                 To\n      compensate a landowner for value attributable to the condemnation\n      project itself, however, would place the landowner in a better position\n      than he would have enjoyed had there been no condemnation. . . .\n\n             On the other hand, the factfinder may consider the highest and\n      best use to which the land taken can be adapted. The existing use of\n      the land, . . . is its presumed highest and best use, but the landowner\n      can rebut this presumption by showing a reasonable probability that\n      when the taking occurred, the property was adaptable and needed or\n      would likely be needed in the near future for another use.\n\n              Finally, Texas law permits landowners to introduce testimony\n      that the condemned land is a self-sufficient separate economic unit,\n      independent from the remainder of the parent tract with a different\n      highest and best use and different value from the remaining land. In\n      this situation, the market value of the severed land can be determined\n      without reference to the remaining land. But when the portion of the\n      land taken by eminent domain cannot be considered as a separate\n      economic unit, the before-and-after method requires determining\n      market value by evaluating the taken land as a proportionate part of\n      the remaining land.\n\nId. at 627–28 (internal citations omitted).\n\n      Applying these legal principles, the Zwahr court concluded that Kangieser’s\n\ntestimony was irrelevant, and therefore inadmissible, to determining the value of\n\nthe land taken from the Zwahrs; thus, the trial court had abused its discretion in\n\nadmitting Kangieser’s testimony. Id. at 631. The Zwahr court provided two rea-\n\nsons for its holding: (1) Kangieser had impermissibly premised his valuation of the\n\neasement on the fact of Exxon’s taking, in violation of the project-enhancement\n\n\n\n                                          15\n\frule, and (2) Kangieser had failed to utilize the before-and-after method in valuing\n\nthe easement. Id. at 630–31.\n\n       The supreme court concluded that “Kangieser’s testimony as a whole\n\nreveal[ed] that he premised his valuation on the fact of Exxon’s condemnation,\n\nthus improperly including project enhancement in that valuation.” Id. at 629. Of\n\nparticular relevance to the Zwahr court was Kangieser’s testimony that Exxon’s\n\ncondemnation defined the parameters of the economic unit.           Id. at 629–30.\n\nKangieser testified that the 1.01 acre easement acquired by Exxon was a separate\n\neconomic unit, which had a “highest and best use” as a pipeline easement. Id. at\n\n626, 629. Kangieser stated that Exxon’s taking “created the economic unit.” Id. at\n\n630.\n\n       The court also emphasized that “[n]ot only did Kangieser rely on the Exxon\n\nproject to establish a separate economic unit, he relied on Exxon’s condemnation\n\nto assign a value to the condemned land.” Id. The Exxon easement overlapped an\n\nexisting easement owned by Koch by 82%, or approximately .82 acres.              Id.\n\nKangieser testified that before Exxon’s project, the Zwahrs’ interest in the .82\n\nacres burdened by the Koch easement was of “negligible” or “nominal” value\n\nbecause it was an exclusive easement owned by Koch. Id. He then testified that\n\nonce Exxon received Koch’s consent to lay another pipeline within the easement,\n\n                                        16\n\fthe value of the .82–acres increased to $35,720 per acre, making the 1.01–acre\n\nExxon easement worth $36,077. Id. “In other words, had the Exxon project never\n\ncome along, the .82 acres would have continued to have no value to the Zwahrs.”\n\nId. In addition, Kangieser “admitted twice that the value he placed on the land did\n\nnot exist before Exxon’s condemnation.” Id.\n\n      Because Kangieser relied on Exxon’s condemnation in establishing a\n      separate economic unit and in assigning a value to that unit, his final\n      opinion reflected enhancement in the land’s value that occurred only\n      because of the Exxon project itself. As explained earlier, value that\n      exists because of the condemnation project is not, under the project-\n      enhancement rule, value for which a landowner may recover. . . . In\n      addition, after Kangieser identified the 1.01–acre tract as a separate\n      economic unit, he evaluated it without reference to the Zwahrs’ entire\n      49–acre tract. Thus at best, Kangieser determined the value of the\n      easement to Exxon, not the value of the loss to the Zwahrs for the\n      taking of the easement. . . . Kangieser failed to apply the before-and-\n      after valuation method, which would have required him to evaluate\n      the 1.01–acre as a proportionate part of the entire forty-nine acres.\n\nId. at 630–31 (citations omitted). The Zwahr court concluded that “Kangieser’s\n\ntestimony was irrelevant to determining the value of the land taken from the\n\nZwahrs and therefore inadmissible under Texas Rule of Evidence 702.” Id at 631.\n\nThe court held that the trial court had abused its discretion in admitting\n\nKangieser’s testimony. Id.\n\n      In both WestTex 66 Pipeline Co. v. Bulanek, 213 S.W.3d 353 (Tex.—App.\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2003), aff’d as modified 209 S.W.3d 98 (Tex. 2006) and\n\n                                        17\n\fWesTTex 66 Pipeline Co. v. Baltzell, No. 01-01-00826-CV, 2003 WL 21665312\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2003, pet. denied) we were presented with the\n\nissue of whether the trial court had abused its discretion by admitting the testimony\n\nof a real estate appraisal expert who had testified regarding the value of a pipeline\n\neasement taken by condemnation. In each case, the pipeline company, WesTTex,\n\nobjected to the testimony, asserting that the experts had impermissibly included\n\nproject enhancement in their appraisals by relying on WesTTex’s condemnation to\n\ndefine the economic unit and to compute the easement’s fair-market value.\n\nBaltzell, 2003 WL 21665312 at *2; Bulanek, 213 S.W.3d at 357. We agreed.\n\n      As in Zwahr, the experts in Baltzell and in Bulanek testified that the pipeline\n\neasements being acquired were separate economic units, thereby demonstrating\n\nthat the condemnation involved in each case defined the parameters of the\n\neconomic unit. See Zwahr, 88 S.W.3d at 629; Baltzell, 2003 WL 21665312 at *5;\n\nBulanek, 213 S.W.3d at 357. From the experts’ testimony, it was clear that the\n\nseparate economic unit derived from the condemnation itself and would not have\n\nexisted independent of the condemnation. Baltzell, 2003 WL 21665312 at *5;\n\nBulanek, 213 S.W.3d at 357.\n\n      In addition, as in Zwahr, the experts’ testimony in Baltzell and in Bulanek\n\nindicated that, not only had they relied on the condemnation to define the\n\n                                         18\n\feconomic unit, they had also relied on the condemnation in each case to assign\n\nvalue. Baltzell, 2003 WL 21665312 at *6–7; Bulanek, 213 S.W.3d at 358. In other\n\nwords, the experts had improperly assessed the value of the easements to\n\nWesTTex, not the loss suffered by the landowners. Baltzell, 2003 WL 21665312\n\nat *7; Bulanek, 213 S.W.3d at 358. We also concluded that the experts failed to\n\nemploy the before-and-after valuation method, which, as stated in Zwahr, is the\n\nappropriate method to apply in pipeline condemnation proceedings in which the\n\nsubject land is not a separate economic unit. Baltzell, 2003 WL 21665312 at *7;\n\nBulanek, 213 S.W.3d at 358.\n\n      Applying the standards enunciated in Zwahr, we concluded in both Baltzell\n\nand Bulanek that the experts’ opinions were irrelevant to determining the value of\n\nthe property taken by WesTTex and, therefore, the testimony was inadmissible\n\nunder Rule of Evidence 702. Baltzell, 2003 WL 21665312 at *7; Bulanek, 213\n\nS.W.3d at 358.    We held that the trial courts had abused their discretion in\n\nadmitting the expert appraisal testimony. See Baltzell, 2003 WL 21665312 at *8;\n\nBulanek, 213 S.W.3d at 358–59.\n\n      Here, citing Zwahr, Baltzell, and Bulanek, the State asserts that “Sikes’\n\nappraisal methodology defines an economic unit created from the State’s\n\ncondemnation itself, which violates the project enhancement rule.” The State\n\n                                       19\n\fpoints out that the boundaries of the 2.385-acre economic unit appraised by Sikes\n\nhas the same parameters as the original acquisition the State had planned to take\n\nfor the detention pond. At the Chanas’ request, the State did not take a 30-foot\n\nstrip at the back of the originally-defined acquisition to provide drainage access to\n\nDinner Creek for the reminder of the Chanas’ property. This reduced the size of\n\nthe State’s acquisition from the 2.385 acres originally planned to the 2.072 acres\n\nthat was ultimately condemned.\n\n      The State points to Sikes’s testimony on direct examination in which he\n\nstated that the reason he valued the eastern portion of the Chanas’ 7.765-acre tract\n\nwas because “that’s what’s actually being taken here.” Also, near the end of his\n\ndirect examination, when asked whether he was “valuing that eastern [part of the\n\nproperty] because that’s where the state . . . took the property?” He answered,\n\n“Correct.”\n\n      The State further points to Sikes’s testimony on cross-examination in which\n\nhe acknowledged that the economic unit, appraised by him, appeared to be nearly\n\nidentical to the State’s originally-planned acquisition. He also acknowledged that,\n\nhad the State not agreed to move the southern boundary, the economic unit\n\nappraised by him would have had the same parameters as the State’s acquisition.\n\n\n\n\n                                         20\n\f      It is, however, useful to place the testimony cited by the State in context. In\n\nthis respect, Sikes testified as follows on cross-examination:\n\n      Q. [I]t’s your testimony that when you determine the size and shape of\n      this separate economic unit that would sell in the open place, you did\n      that based upon market data that you identified and not on the\n      acquisition?\n\n      A. I based it upon market data, you know, that the property would be\n      subdivided into three economic units.\n\n      Q. And you further said it’s going to be 2.3-acre—three point—2.385-\n      acre tract?\n\n      A. Yeah, that’s my opinion.\n\n      Q. Almost identical boundaries as the State’s acquisition?\n\n      A. That’s my opinion.\n\n      Q. And you did that based on market data, not the acquisition itself?\n\n      A. I looked at the market and how the property would be developed to\n      its highest and best use.\n\n      Q. And the State’s acquisition had absolutely no influence on your\n      articulation of the boundaries of your separate economic unit?\n\n      A. It’s—it is the economic unit.\n\n      Q. But that’s not what I asked. I asked you whether the State’s\n      acquisition had any influence on your articulation of the parameters of\n      your separate economic unit?\n\n      A. No, it didn’t.\n\n      Q. So, it’s just a coincidence that they’re virtually identical?\n                                          21\n\f      A. Well, yeah. It’s not a coincidence.         It’s based upon what’s\n      happening in the market.\n\n      Q. That’s right. It’s not based on the survey order here?\n\n      A. No. It’s not based upon the survey; but, you know, as we started\n      the process, the role is to estimate just compensation to the Chanas.\n\n      Sikes’s testimony on cross-examination was consistent with his testimony\n\ngiven on direct examination. During direct examination, testified as follows:\n\n      Q. Did you do that analysis with regard to your appraisal of the Chana\n      property?\n\n      A. I did.\n\n      Q. And what did you determine was the highest and best use for the\n      Chana property?\n\n      A. A commercial development. The vacant land would be developed\n      commercially.\n\n      Q. Is this also—well, let me ask you this, first of all: Are you, in fact,\n      required to value the Chana property as though it’s put to its highest\n      and best use in this proceeding?\n\n      A. That’s all appraisals, by the definition of market value.\n\n      Q. Okay. So, you determine a commercial use. Does that—is this\n      also—the highest and best use analysis also where you evaluate the\n      economic unit concept?\n\n      A. Exactly. They have over a 7-acre tract, but if you look in the\n      marketplace how the market was developed—you can look right\n      down the road and see these economic units cut out of this larger\n      parcel. That’s how this property would be developed. That would be\n                                         22\n\fthe highest and best use of the property. So, in my opinion, the\neconomic use is the highest and best use.\n\nQ. The economic unit—\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. —is the highest and best use?\n\nA. Economic unit.\n\nQ. Okay. And during the—there’s been some suggestion, maybe in\nopening statement or whatnot, that you—your economic unit has\nsome problems because it’s all the way on the eastern side of the\nproperty. Can you explain to the jury your overall analysis and why\nyou valued the part on the eastern portion of the property?\n\nA. Well, very commonsensical. That’s what’s actually being taken\nhere. The corner in Enchanted Oak is not being taken. We’re here to\nestimate the value of that acquisition. If you look at the property,\nwhere it’s located, the size of the parent tract, it could be cut up into\nthree different tracts. So, I’m looking at the economic unit based\nupon, okay, I've got a 7-acre parent tract; but if I look at the properties\nin the marketplace, everybody’s selling and developing smaller tracts\nout of the larger tract. I think the highest and best use of the Chanas’\n[property] would be the exact same, what the market is doing.\n\nQ. And so, when you say you determined an economic unit, you\nactually are—did you speak in terms of the whole property being\ndivided into multiple economic units?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Okay. So, there would be one—an economic unit at the hard\ncorner of Enchanted Creek?\n\n\n\n\n                                    23\n\fA. I think you’re—you’re—if you look at the Chana property and\nlook at how the property was developed across the street, you can see\nhow it’s cut up.\n\nQ. But we’re talking in this lawsuit about the eastern and that—and\nyou valued the eastern economic unit.\n\nA. Correct. I didn’t value anything to the west of the . . . [line] there. I\njust valued that component, that economic unit.\n\nQ. Okay. And why did you value the eastern economic unit?\n\nA. Well, it’s my opinion that that property can stand on its own. It\ndoesn’t need the entire 7 acres. And if you look at other development\nthat’s. You know, just down the street from us, that’s how those\nproperties were developed.\n\nQ. Okay. But I’m kind of thinking even more basic than that. You\nsay two or three—three or four economic units on the Chana property.\nThat would be the highest and best use.\n\nA. You know multiple economic units.\n\nQ. Okay. But why are we talking about the ones to the east?\n\nA. Because they’re not taking the ones to the west.\n\nQ. Okay. So, in order to assist the jury when determining value, you\nvalued what the State is taking?\n\nA. Right, because it can stand alone.\n\nQ. If the State were taking the hard corner at enchanted Creek, would\nyou have valued an economic unit there?\n\nA. That would be a different analysis.\n\n\n\n                                    24\n\f      Q. Okay. But it would be—would it be correct to say that you only\n      carved out one economic unit from this property, and it’s all the way\n      to the eastern boundary of the property?\n\n      A. Correct.\n\n      Q. Would that be correct to say?\n\n      A. That would be correct.\n\n      Q. Okay. But—make sure—I don’t think we’re communicating.\n\n      A. Okay.\n\n      Q. Overall, you would carve up the Chana property into multiple\n      economic units?\n\n      A. Yeah. I think of the 7 acres, you’d have three economic units—\n      three different pad sites.\n\n      Q. Okay. And all my question is: If there’s a suggestion that you’re\n      only creating one economic unit on the property and it’s all the way to\n      the eastern boundary, that wouldn’t be correct, would it?\n\n      A. No.\n\n      Q. But you valued that one because that’s where they’re taking it?\n\n      A. Exact—exactly. And they’re not taking the—the other economic\n      units.\n\n      Sikes’s testimony stands in contrast to the testimony of the appraisal expert\n\nin Zwahr and in Baltzell. In Zwahr, the landowners’ expert testified that “Exxon’s\n\ncondemnation ‘created the economic unit,’” and that the 1.01 acre “did not exist\n\nuntil after the condemnation.” See Zwahr, 88 S.W.3d at 630.\n                                         25\n\f      Similarly, in Baltzell, the landowners’ experts determined the economic unit\n\nto be the same 5.47 acres of land that had been condemned for a pipeline easement.\n\n2003 WL 21665312 at *7. One of landowners’ appraisal experts testified that\n\n“WesTTex created the economic unit that I valued.” Id. at *5. Their other expert\n\ntestified that he adopted the pipeline easement as his economic unit and stated that\n\npipeline’s placement on the 5.47–acre strip of land was what made it a separate\n\neconomic unit. Id.\n\n      Here, unlike the experts in Zwahr and Baltzell, Sikes expressly denied using\n\nthe State’s original condemnation survey as the basis for his opinion regarding the\n\nboundaries of the economic unit. In addition, Sikes explained why he appraised\n\nthe eastern section of the Chanas’ property, taken by the State, as a separate\n\neconomic unit; that is, he explained the basis for his opinion.\n\n      Sikes testified that the highest and best use for the Chanas’ 7.765 acre tract\n\nwas to subdivide it into three separate, independent tracts to be sold individually\n\nfor commercial use. Sikes testified that this is how other comparable properties in\n\nthe area were selling at the relevant time. Larger properties like the Chanas were\n\nnot selling as a whole but were being divided and sold as smaller properties for\n\ncommercial use. Sikes stated that he appraised only the eastern most of the three\n\n\n\n\n                                         26\n\feconomic units because that economic unit contains the property condemned by\n\nthe State.\n\n      We conclude that the trial court had ample evidence to reject the State’s\n\nassertion that Sikes’s testimony violated the project-enhancement rule because the\n\neconomic unit appraised by Sikes had the same dimensions as the original\n\ncondemnation planned by the State. We hold that the trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion by refusing to exclude Sikes’s testimony on the ground that his appraisal\n\nviolated the project enhancement rule as set forth in Zwahr.\n\nC.    Separate Economic Unit\n\n      The State further assails Sikes’s valuation methodology by asserting that\n\nSikes should not have evaluated the condemned 2.072 acres as part of a separate\n\n2.385-acre economic unit; rather, the State asserts that Sikes should have evaluated\n\nthe condemned property as a proportionate part of the entire 7.765 acres owned by\n\nthe Chanas. To support this assertion, the State relies on the following language\n\nfrom Zwahr:\n\n      Texas law permits landowners to introduce testimony that the\n      condemned land is a self-sufficient separate economic unit,\n      independent from the remainder of the parent tract with a different\n      highest and best use and different value from the remaining land. In\n      this situation, the market value of the severed land can be determined\n      without reference to the remaining land. But when the portion of the\n      land taken by eminent domain cannot be considered as a separate\n      economic unit, the before-and-after method requires determining\n                                        27\n\f      market value by evaluating the taken land as a proportionate part of\n      the remaining land.\n\nZwahr, 88 S.W.3d at 628 (citations omitted). The State first asserts that, pursuant\n\nto the foregoing language in Zwahr, Sikes’s testimony did not establish that the\n\n2.385-acre tract he appraised was a separate economic unit because it did not have\n\na different highest and best use from the remainder of the Chanas’ property.\n\n      As shown above, Sikes testified that the highest and best use of the Chanas’\n\n7.765 acres was dividing it into three separate, self-sufficient tracts. The highest\n\nand best use for each of these individual parcels, including the one appraised by\n\nSikes, is commercial development.         Under this methodology, there is no\n\n“remaining property”; rather, the whole property is comprised of three separate,\n\nself-sufficient units. Nonetheless, Sikes’s testimony indicated that the highest and\n\nbest use of the 7.765-acre parent tract (division into three parcels) is not the same\n\nas the highest and best use for the economic unit appraised by Sikes (commercial\n\ndevelopment).\n\n      The State further asserts that Sikes’s testimony failed to show that the\n\nappraised economic unit was self-sufficient or independent from the remaining\n\nacreage. The State points to Sikes’s testimony in which he explained how access\n\nto the appraised economic unit could be gained. Sikes stated that there would be a\n\ndriveway on FM 529 for direct access. He also stated that access could be gained\n                                         28\n\ffrom Enchanted Creek Drive by cross-access over the two economic units to be\n\ndeveloped on the Chanas’ property. Sikes testified: “[Y]ou’re going to have a\n\nportion of access off 529; but since the Chanas own all that other property, you’re\n\ngoing to have cross access over to Enchanted [Creek], just like many of these tracts\n\nin the marketplace have cross access.”\n\n      The State argues that the appraised economic unit was not self-sufficient\n\nbecause cross-access to the unit would need to be through the other portions of the\n\nChanas’ property. We disagree that such evidence showed that the appraised\n\neconomic unit was not independent and self-sufficient. Sikes testified that the\n\neconomic unit would have its own direct access from FM 529, a major\n\nthoroughfare. In addition, Sikes indicated that, not only is cross-access common in\n\nthe market between economic units, it is beneficial to the economic unit and adds\n\nto its value: He testified:\n\n      You’d have what would be cross access around the front so you could\n      drive from the east to the west. Economic units, they like synergy.\n      They share customers. If you look at the properties right up here\n      (indicating), there is an access drive you can see there. And there’s\n      also an access drive back here (indicating). That’s how that property\n      was developed. You might have rear access, as well; but you’re going\n      to try to—you know, properties with more access are worth more than\n      properties with less access, all other things being equal.\n\n      The State further assails Sikes’s opinion that the appraised economic unit\n\nwas self-sufficient on the ground that “basic infrastructure,” such as sewer and\n                                         29\n\fwater, had not been developed on the unit. However, a review of the record\n\nreveals that the State’s claim of the lack of basic infrastructure is not entirely\n\naccurate.\n\n      The State points out that, although a sanitary sewer line existed on the\n\nwestern boundary of the Chanas’ 7.765-acre tract, the line would need to be\n\nextended 550 feet to reach the appraised economic unit. However, Sikes testified,\n\n“That’s [i.e., 550 feet] fairly close for this type of development.”\n\n      The evidence also showed that a water line ran along the northern boundary\n\nof the appraised economic unit and a storm sewer existed on the property’s\n\nsouthern border. The evidence further showed that the property was within a\n\nmunicipal utility district (MUD).       Sikes testified that much of the costs of\n\ndeveloping the infrastructure were reimbursable from the MUD, although he\n\nacknowledged that reimbursement was not guaranteed.\n\n      In addition, the State assails Sikes’s appraisal of the property as a separate\n\neconomic unit on the ground that the Chanas’ property had not been previously\n\npartitioned or marketed as a separate 2.385-acre tract. The State also asserts that\n\nthis rendered Sikes’s opinion “too speculative to be admitted as direct evidence of\n\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\fmarket value.”1 In support of this assertion, the State relies on State v. Willey, 360\n\nS.W.2d 524 (Tex. 1962) and City of Harlingen v. Sharboneau, 48 S.W.3d 177, 182\n\n(Tex. 2001). We agree with the Chanas that these cases are distinguishable.\n\n      In Willey, the landowner sought to offer evidence that the best and highest\n\nuse of a 3-acre tract, which had been condemned out of a 104-acre tract, was\n\n“subdivision into residential homesites, with some commercial sites.” State v.\n\nWilley, 351 S.W.2d 904, 905 (Tex. Civ. App.—Waco 1961), rev’d, 360 S.W.2d\n\n524 (Tex. 1962). The Supreme Court of Texas held that this evidence was not\n\nadmissible because “at the time of the taking . . . there had been no subdivision or\n\ndevelopment of the 104–acre tract in question.” Willey, 360 S.W.2d at 524. The\n\ncourt also held that “one seeking to prove the value of such a tract of land may not\n\nshow what the price of the lots would be if subdivided, or show the price for which\n\nalready subdivided lots were selling.” Id. at 525.\n\n      Here, unlike in Willey, Sikes’s valuation methodology is not based on selling\n\nthe property as a residential subdivision; rather, it is based on “something much\n\nsimpler.” In re State, 355 S.W.3d 611, 616 (Tex. 2011) (holding that Willey did\n\nnot bar admittance of landowner’s evidence that highest and best use of property\n\n\n\n1\n      This argument was made under the State’s third issue, but because it is related to\n      argument made under the State’s second issue, we discuss it here.\n                                          31\n\fwas partitioning it into separate parcels to be sold as highway frontage commercial\n\nproperty). Sikes testified that the highest and best use of the Chanas’ entire\n\nproperty was partitioning it into three separate tracts, which could each be sold for\n\ncommercial development. Sikes explained that his opinion was supported by what\n\nhe found was happening in the market in the area surrounding the property. He\n\nstated that larger parcels, such as the Chanas’ 7.765-acre tract, were not being sold\n\nas whole properties for future development. Rather, the sales in the area showed\n\nthat smaller tracts were being sold from larger tracts to be used for development of\n\na single commercial enterprise. Because it is distinguishable, the holding in Willey\n\ndoes not negate Sikes’s designation of the 2.385-acre tract as a separate economic\n\nunit or render his opinion speculative.\n\n      Sharboneau involved the condemnation of a 10-acre tract of land to be used\n\nfor a city park. See 48 S.W.3d at 180. Before trial, the parties stipulated that the\n\nhighest and best use for the land was a residential subdivision. Id. At trial, the\n\nlandowners’ expert used the subdivision development method to appraise the\n\ncondemned land. Id. “This method values an undeveloped tract by calculating\n\nwhat a developer could expect to realize from sales of individual lots, taking into\n\naccount the costs of development and discounting future revenues to present\n\nvalue.” Id. The analysis employed by the landowner’s expert under the\n\n                                          32\n\fsubdivision development method was complicated and complex. See id. at 180–\n\n81.\n\n      In contrast, the city’s expert in Sharboneau used the comparable-sales\n\nmethod of appraisal to determine the land’s value. Id. The city’s expert offered\n\nevidence of three comparable land sales that were suitable for residential\n\ndevelopment.    Id.    The city’s expert determined the value of the condemned\n\nproperty after making adjustments to the three comparable properties to\n\ncompensate for their varying characteristics. Id.\n\n      The Sharboneau court explained that the subdivision development method is\n\ndistinct from the comparable sales approach.         Id. at 183–84.      “Although\n\nsubdivision development analysis requires the appraiser to examine the market for\n\nready-to-build lots, such properties are not comparable to the larger, unsubdivided\n\nproperty actually being appraised.\n\n      The court also recognized that “[c]ourts have long favored the comparable\n\nsales approach when determining the market value of real property.” Id. at 182.\n\nThe court continued,\n\n      If the goal of an appraisal is to ascertain market value, then logically\n      there can be no better guide than the prices that willing buyers and\n      sellers actually negotiate in the relevant market. Under a comparable\n      sales analysis, the appraiser finds data for sales of similar property,\n      then makes upward or downward adjustments to these sales prices\n      based on differences in the subject property.\n                                         33\n\fId.\n\n      Ultimately, the Sharboneau court recognized that the subdivision\n\ndevelopment method may be a valid appraisal methodology for undeveloped land.\n\nId. at 186. However, the court held the subdivision development method could not\n\nserve as a basis for the judgment in that case because the expert’s opinion “did not\n\ndemonstrate what a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller in the relevant\n\nmarket”; thus it was not reliable or relevant. Id.\n\n      Unlike the landowner’s expert in Sharboneau, Sikes did not appraise the\n\ncondemned property in this case utilizing the subdivision development method.\n\nRather, as the city’s expert did in Sharboneau, Sikes appraised the property using\n\nthe comparable-sales method.\n\n      In addition, we note that the Supreme Court of Texas distinguished\n\nSharboneau in a case in which the landowner asserted that the highest and best use\n\nof a 39-acre tract, condemned out of a 185-acre tract, was to partition the 39-acres\n\ninto several individual tracts that could be sold as highway frontage commercial\n\nproperty. In re State, 355 S.W.3d at 615–16. Distinguishing Sharboneau, the\n\nState court wrote:\n\n      In a 10–acre tract like that considered in Sharboneau, it is unlikely\n      that a 1/44th-tract lot would be bought for residential purposes unless\n      the entirety of the residential subdivision had been planned and\n                                          34\n\f      created, and substantial funds had been invested. Inferences like these\n      are unnecessary to support the sale of parcels such as those into which\n      the [landowners] divided their property. The costs of dividing raw\n      land are insubstantial. If the [landowners] were to offer evidence that\n      the typical size of highway-frontage commercial parcels was similar\n      to their subdivided parcels, and that those parcels were similarly\n      appropriate for that use, it would not be speculative to permit them to\n      admit valuation evidence on that basis. Of course, the State would be\n      permitted to offer its own evidence that the land was best valued as a\n      single unit.\n\nId. at 616.\n\n      This reasoning also applies in this case. Valuing the separate economic unit\n\nappraised by Sikes does not involve the same inferences that would be required to\n\nvalue a residential tract in an undeveloped residential subdivision. See id. Here,\n\nthrough Sikes, the Chanas offered evidence showing that similarly sized and\n\nsituated parcels of land, comparable to the economic unit appraised by Sikes, were\n\nbeing purchased in the vicinity for commercial development. 2 Thus, it was not\n\nspeculative for the Chanas to offer valuation evidence based on the premise that\n\nthe appraised economic unit was a separate, self-sufficient unit. See id. In short,\n\nthe holding in Sharboneau does not serve to render the basis for Sikes’s opinion\n\nspeculative. We hold that the State has not shown that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by refusing to grant its motion to exclude the opinion testimony of Sikes\n\n\n2\n      As discussed infra, the State objects to the admission of only five out of the ten\n      comparable land sales relied on by Sikes.\n                                          35\n\fon the basis that the 2.385-acre tract, containing the condemned property, could not\n\nbe valued as a separate economic unit.\n\n      We overrule the State’s first and second issues.\n\n                Admissibility of Five Comparable Property Sales\n\n      In its third issue, the State asserts that the trial court abused its discretion by\n\nadmitting into evidence certain property sales. Through Sikes, the Chanas offered\n\ninto evidence ten property sales, which they asserted were comparable to the\n\neconomic unit appraised by Sikes. The State objected to the admission of five of\n\nthese sales: Chana Sale Numbers 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. The State asserted that these\n\nfive sales were not comparable to the condemned property because each sale had\n\ninvolved land that was part of an existing commercial subdivision, located at a\n\nbusy intersection, with developed ready-to-build “pad sites,” and infrastructure\n\nalready in place. See Sharboneau, 48 S.W.3d at 182 (“Comparable sales must . . .\n\ntake place near in time to the condemnation, occur in the vicinity of the condemned\n\nproperty, and involve land with similar characteristics.”). The State averred that,\n\nin contrast, the Chanas’ property was “raw,” “undeveloped,” and not subdivided.\n\nThe State has also asserted that it would be unlikely that the appraised economic\n\nunit would be the first parcel to sell out of the Chanas’ land because it is an interior\n\ntract, not the corner tract of the property.\n\n                                           36\n\f      We review the trial court’s decision to admit or exclude evidence for an\n\nabuse of discretion. Tex. Dep’t of Transp. v. Able, 35 S.W.3d 608, 617 (Tex.\n\n2000); City of Brownsville v. Alvarado, 897 S.W.2d 750, 753 (Tex. 1995). A trial\n\ncourt abuses its discretion when it acts without regard to any guiding rules or\n\nprinciples. Alvarado, 897 S.W.2d at 754.\n\n      A trial court’s error in admitting evidence is reversible only if the error\n\nprobably (though not necessarily) resulted in an improper judgment. Kia Motors\n\nCorp. v. Ruiz, 432 S.W.3d 865, 883 (Tex. 2014); see also TEX. R. APP. P.\n\n44.1(a)(1) (providing that error does not result in reversal unless it “(1) probably\n\ncaused the rendition of an improper judgment; or (2) probably prevented the\n\nappellant from properly presenting the case to the court of appeals”). To determine\n\nwhether the trial court’s error was harmful, we review the entire record and require\n\nthe complaining party to demonstrate that the judgment turns on the particular\n\nevidence admitted. Kia Motors Corp., 432 S.W.3d at 883. Error in admitting\n\nevidence is generally harmless if the objecting party later permits the same or\n\nsimilar evidence to be introduced without objection or the contested evidence is\n\nmerely cumulative of properly admitted evidence and is not controlling on a\n\nmaterial issue dispositive of the case.      Bay Area Healthcare Group, Ltd. v.\n\nMcShane, 239 S.W.3d 231, 234 (Tex. 2007); Interstate Northborough P’ship v.\n\n                                        37\n\fState, 66 S.W.3d 213, 220 (Tex. 2001); Richardson v. Green, 677 S.W.2d 497, 501\n\n(Tex. 1984).\n\n      For purposes of analysis, we will presume, without deciding, that the trial\n\ncourt abused its discretion by admitting Chana Sale Numbers 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.\n\nAlthough it has alleged that the trial court erred by admitting the five comparable\n\nland sales, the State has not explained how this alleged error caused harm. See\n\nCortez v. HCCI–San Antonio, Inc., 131 S.W.3d 113, 119 (Tex. App.—San Antonio\n\n2004), aff’d, 159 S.W .3d 87 (Tex. 2005) (explaining that on appeal appellant has\n\nburden of showing how he or she was harmed by the exclusion of evidence).\n\nNonetheless, we turn to the record to determine whether harm resulted from the\n\nadmittance of the complained-of evidence.\n\n      The State does mention that Sikes relied on these land sales as examples\n\nsupporting his statement that the trend in the market was to carve out and sell\n\nsmaller tracts of land from bigger tracts for commercial development. This in turn\n\nsupported Sikes’ opinion that the appraised tract was a separate economic unit.\n\nHowever, there were other sales admitted into evidence involving a sale of a\n\nsmaller tract sold out of a larger tract. Chana Sale Number 1, of which the State\n\ndoes not complain, also involved the sale of a parcel of land, 2.167 acres, that was\n\nsold from a larger tract. This tract was less than one mile from the Chanas’ land,\n\n                                        38\n\fwas equivalent in size to the appraised economic unit, and sold for $19.07 per\n\nsquare foot.\n\n      In addition, through its expert, Dominy, the State also offered into evidence\n\na sale in which a smaller tract of land had been sold out a larger tract. The State’s\n\nSale Number 1 involved the sale of a 1.19-acre tract that sat at an intersection.\n\nThat tract had been sold off from a larger tract of land. In addition, on cross-\n\nexamination, Dominy acknowledged that the 1.19-acre tract had not been the first\n\nsmaller tract to sell from that larger tract. He admitted that the first smaller tract to\n\nsell had been a tract “away from the intersection.” As the Chanas point out, a tract\n\n“away from the intersection” would be similarly situated to the economic unit\n\nappraised by Sikes in this case.\n\n      In addition, Chana Sale Numbers 1, 2, 3, 7, and 10, of which the State does\n\nnot complain, also provided support for the jury’s monetary award. These land\n\nsales involved property that sold from $7.70 to $19.07 per square foot. Sikes\n\ntestified that he valued the condemned property to be worth $9.50 per square foot\n\nwith the total compensation due the Chanas to be $922,256.00. Thus, Chana Sale\n\nNumbers 1, 2, 3, 7, and 10 support the monetary award.\n\n\n\n\n                                           39\n\f      We hold that the trial court’s error, if any, in admitting Chana Sale Numbers\n\n4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 was harmless error. See TEX. R. APP. P. 44.1(a)(1). We overrule\n\nthe State’s third issue.\n\n                           Exclusion of Tax Protest Records\n\n      In its fourth issue, the State asserts that the trial court abused its discretion\n\nwhen it excluded testimony from a tax-protest hearing in which the Chanas\n\nchallenged the taxes assessed on the property.\n\n      Four months before the date of the taking in this case, Brandon Fisher, a tax\n\nconsultant, appeared on behalf of the Chanas before the Harris County Appraisal\n\nReview Board to protest the taxes assessed on the Chanas’ property. Fisher stated\n\nunder oath at the hearing that the market value of the Chanas’ 7.765-acre tract was\n\n$3.24 per square foot.\n\n      The State sought to admit the record of the tax-protest hearing, asserting that\n\nFisher’s statement, as to the market value of the property, was admissible as an\n\nadmission or a statement against interest. See TEX. R. EVID. 801(e). The Chanas\n\nfiled a motion to exclude the tax-protest hearing record.        They asserted that,\n\npursuant to Rule of Evidence 403, the probative value of the evidence was\n\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and would confuse the issues for the\n\njury. See TEX. R. EVID. 403.\n\n                                         40\n\f      Following a pretrial hearing, the trial court granted the Chanas’ motion to\n\nexclude tax protest hearing record. The trial court stated that “using . . . Rule 403,\n\nI do believe the probative value of this tax protest record is substantially\n\noutweighed by the risk of unduly prejudice[ing] and confusing the jury.”\n\n      During trial, the State requested the trial court to reconsider its ruling on the\n\nChanas’ motion to exclude the tax protest evidence. The trial court denied the\n\nmotion to reconsider. The State made an offer of proof for the appellate record\n\nwith respect to the transcript of the tax-protest hearing.\n\n      On appeal, the State asserts that the trial court erred by excluding the\n\nevidence because “[i]t is clearly established under Texas law that a property\n\nowner’s prior statements regarding fair market value of the owner’s property are\n\nadmissible as substantive evidence in an eminent domain proceeding when the\n\nproperty owner participates in or adopts the declared value.” The State further\n\navers, “This rule applies even where the prior statements of value were generated\n\nfor tax purposes.”\n\n      In their brief, the Chanas do not dispute “that evidence of a tax rendition\n\nvaluation can be admissible as an admission, or a statement against interest . . . .”\n\nThe Chanas assert, however, that the State sought to admit more than just Fisher’s\n\nstatement of the property’s value. Rather, at the hearing in the trial court, the State\n\n                                          41\n\fmade clear that it sought to admit the entire transcript of the tax protest hearing\n\ninto evidence. 3\n\n      At the tax-protest hearing, Fisher sought to lower the tax assessed value on\n\nthe Chana’s entire 7.785-acre property to $3.24 per square foot. To support this\n\nvaluation, Fisher relied on three property sales and six property listings in the area\n\nof the Chanas’ property. Before the appraisal review board, Fisher testified as\n\nfollows:\n\n      I’m looking at some comparable properties in the area and I found\n      three sales, six listings. I think the listings definitely overpower the\n      sales. In fact, there was only a couple of indicated sales in the area,\n      especially because it’s hard to find sales in this size. Subject’s almost\n      eight acres. Most of the properties in the area that are selling are\n      much smaller tracts. Based on the listings of these properties and\n      three sales, the median indicated value per square foot is $3.24 a\n      square [foot], divide that by the subject property, gives me a value of\n      [$] 1,095,975.\n\n             The next couple pages are just a break down of their sales, their\n      size, and also the listings, as well. . . .\n\n\n3\n      At the pretrial hearing on the motion to exclude, the trial court asked, “The records\n      we are talking about here are not only their Exhibit D, right, the hearing affidavit,\n      but you’re also talking about [the] testimony on the records?” The State\n      responded that it had brought the file from the proceeding, including an audio\n      recording of the tax protest hearing. The trial court then asked, “[P]lease tell me\n      what kind of records we’re talking about. So in addition to the audio-recording,\n      what else are we talking about?” The State responded that there was “[a] sworn\n      affidavit from Mr. Fisher testifying as to market value of the property . . . [a]nd\n      then the hearing evidence that they submitted in support of his opinion where he\n      opines that the property is valued at $3.24 per square foot . . . .” Later, during its\n      offer of proof, the State offered the entire transcript from the tax protest hearing.\n                                            42\n\fFisher then proceeded to discuss a number of the comparable sales and listings on\n\nwhich he based his valuation.\n\n      As shown in the foregoing excerpt, Fisher testified that he formulated his\n\nopinion regarding the value of the property based—not only on what he regarded\n\nas comparable sales—but also on property listings, which he stated “overpowered”\n\nthe comparable sales information.      The Chanas correctly point out that, in a\n\ncondemnation suit, evidence of the price for which a similar property is being\n\noffered for sale is not admissible evidence to establish the fair market value of the\n\ncondemned property. We have previously recognized, “The law is well settled that\n\nunaccepted offers to buy or sell are incompetent evidence of land value in\n\ncondemnation suits.” State v. Clevenger, 384 S.W.2d 207, 209 (Tex. Civ. App.—\n\nHouston 1964, writ ref’d n.r.e.) (citing Hanks v. Gulf, Colo. & S. F. Ry. Co., 320\n\nS.W.2d 333, 336 (Tex. 1959); Taub v. Hous. Indep.

See Clevenger, 384 S.W.2d at\n\n209. The State made no attempt to segregate this inadmissible evidence from the\n\nadmissible evidence from the tax hearing. “It is well settled that where evidence is\n\noffered as a whole, only a part of which is admissible, the court does not commit\n\nerror in sustaining an objection to such testimony, and in such case it is not the\n\nduty of the court or the party objecting thereto to separate the admissible from the\n\ninadmissible.” Perry v. Tex. Mun. Power Agency, 667 S.W.2d 259, 265 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1984, writ ref’d n.r.e.).

In its first two issues,\n\nthe State asserts that the trial court abused its discretion when it admitted the\n\ntestimony of the Chana’s real estate appraisal expert. The State’s third issue\n\nchallenges the admission of certain comparable land sales, and the State’s fourth\n\nissue assails the trial court’s exclusion of records from a tax-protest hearing in\n\nwhich the Chanas challenged the taxes assessed for the property.\n\n      We affirm.\n\n                                   Background\n\n      Jasdeep Singh Chana, Manjit Singh Chana, and Amar Pal Singh Chana (“the\n\nChanas”) owned a 7.765-acre tract of vacant land in Harris County, Texas. The\n\nland sat at the intersection of FM 529 and Enchanted Creek Drive in Katy, Texas.\n\nThe rectangular-shaped tract was bounded by FM 529 on its northern side and\n\nEnchanted Creek Drive on its western side. The tract’s eastern side was bounded\n\nby Dinner Creek.      Behind the tract’s southern property line was a housing\n\nsubdivision.\n\n      In 2010, the State sought to obtain 2.385 acres out of the 7.765-acre tract for\n\nthe construction of a detention pond, needed as part of the roadway expansion of\n\nFM 529. The State planned to construct the detention pond on the eastern most\n\n                                         2\n\fpart of the Chanas’ property next to Dinner Creek. The Chanas requested the State\n\nto decrease the size of the taking to permit the Chanas’s remaining 5.693 acres of\n\nland to maintain access to Dinner creek for drainage and detention purposes. The\n\nState agreed and shifted the back boundary of the taking 30 feet forward to the\n\nnorth. This gave the Chanas a strip of land behind the State’s taking, which\n\nconnected the remainder of their property to Dinner Creek, allowing for future\n\ndrainage and water detention. After this change, the amount of land condemned by\n\nthe State for construction of the detention pond was reduced from 2.385 acres to\n\nthe 2.072 acres.\n\n      The State petitioned the county court to condemn the 2.072 acres to use in\n\nconjunction with TxDOT’s roadway expansion of FM 529. The county court\n\nappointed three special commissioners to determine the fair market value of the\n\nland. Following a hearing, the commissioners awarded the Chanas $722,176.00.\n\nThe State objected to the award and requested a jury trial. On November 29, 2010,\n\nthe State deposited the full amount of the commissioner’s award into the court’s\n\nregistry, thereby establishing the date of the taking and the date that the State\n\nacquired the 2.072 acres of land.\n\n      The case proceeded to trial before a jury for a determination of the amount\n\nof money due the Chanas for the 2.072 acres of land condemned by the State for its\n\n                                        3\n\froadway-expansion project. Each side offered the testimony of its own real-estate\n\nappraisal expert to show the fair market value of the property as of November 29,\n\n2010.\n\n        The State filed a pre-trial motion to exclude the testimony of the Chanas’\n\nreal-estate appraisal expert, Mark Sikes. The trial court denied the motion and,\n\nover the State’s continued objections at trial, permitted Sikes to testify. Sikes\n\ntestified that the highest and best use for the Chanas’ 7.765-acre piece of land was\n\nto divide it into three separate, independent land parcels or “economic units” for\n\ncommercial development. He opined that the 2.072 acres taken by the State would\n\nbe part of a 2.385-acre self-sufficient economic unit. Located on the eastern most\n\nside of the Chanas’ property, this rectangular-shaped economic unit was fronted on\n\nits northern side by FM 529, a major thoroughfare. The economic unit had Dinner\n\nCreek on its eastern boundary, the Chanas’ remaining property on its western\n\nboundary—which Sikes opined should be divided into two other self-sufficient\n\neconomic units—and a housing subdivision behind its southern boundary.\n\nAlthough he testified that the Chanas’ remaining property could be divided into\n\ntwo additional economic units, Sikes testified that he did not appraise those\n\neconomic units because he had been retained to appraise only the property\n\ncondemned by the State, which was part of the eastern economic unit.\n\n                                         4\n\f      Sikes acknowledged that the economic unit, containing the condemned\n\nproperty, mirrored the dimensions of the parcel of land that the State had originally\n\nplanned to condemn before agreeing to permit the Chanas to retain a 30-foot strip\n\nat the back of the property for drainage purposes. Sikes testified that the 2.385-\n\nacre economic unit was independent of, and could be marketed and sold separately\n\nfrom, the remaining land owned by the Chanas.\n\n      According to Sikes, the highest and best use of the 2.385-acre economic unit\n\nwould be commercial development. Sikes testified that, both before and after the\n\ncondemnation in this case, the commercial real-estate market was active in the area\n\nwhere the Chanas’ property is located. He stated that there had been commercial\n\ndevelopment of properties to the east and to the west of the land. Sikes pointed out\n\nthat the Chanas’ property was located less than a mile from the major intersection\n\nof Fry Road and FM 529. This intersection had been commercially developed with\n\nnationally recognized stores and a bank. Sikes testified that these businesses\n\ngenerated traffic and that the Chanas’s property was in the “sphere of influence” of\n\nthat intersection. Sikes also stated that, in the last decade, there had been a growth\n\nof housing subdivisions in that area, which provided a residential base for\n\ncommercial property.      According to Sikes, there had been “quite a bit” of\n\nresidential development around the Chanas’ property, and it sat at “one of the\n\n                                          5\n\fprimary commercial thoroughfares that provides access to that residential\n\nproperty.”\n\n      In forming his opinion, Sikes relied on the sale of 10 properties, which he\n\naverred were comparable to the condemned property. He testified that he had\n\nbased his conclusion that the condemned property could be sold as part of a\n\nseparate 2.385-acre economic unit for commercial development on these property\n\nsales. He stated that these comparable properties were in the area surrounding the\n\nChanas’ property. Eight of the ten properties were less than one mile from the\n\nChanas’ property and two were slightly further away. The sales of these 10\n\nproperties occurred between June 2006 and November 2011. These properties\n\nranged in size from .776 acres to 2.939 acres in size. The sales price of these\n\nproperties ranged from $7.70 to $20.00 per square foot. Sikes stated that it is\n\nunusual for him as an appraiser to find so many property sales in such close\n\nproximity to the property that is the subject of appraisal. Sikes stated that this\n\nindicated that real estate, sold as smaller economic units for commercial develop,\n\nwas in demand in the area of the Chanas’ property.\n\n      A few of the properties relied on by Sikes to appraise the subject property\n\nhad been subdivided from larger tracts of land and then sold as separate economic\n\nunits for commercial development. With regard to the area where the Chana’s\n\n                                        6\n\fproperty was located, Sikes testified that “everybody’s selling and developing\n\nsmaller tracts out of larger tracts. I think that the highest and best use of the\n\nChanas’ [property] would be the exact same, what the market is doing.” Sikes\n\ntestified that he did not find property along FM 529 being sold as large seven acre\n\ntracts of land. Rather, he stated that landowners in the area were dividing their\n\nproperty and selling off smaller economic units.\n\n      On cross-examination, Sikes acknowledged that the 10 properties he utilized\n\nas comparable properties were either located on a corner or had access to two\n\nmajor thoroughfares. In comparison, the 2.385-acre economic unit defined by\n\nSikes on the Chanas’ property had frontage on one major thoroughfare, FM 529,\n\nand was located “mid-block” with the nearest intersection being FM 529 and\n\nEnchanted Forest, a street accessing a housing subdivision.               Sikes also\n\nacknowledged that some of the comparable properties had more infrastructure and\n\nutilities in place than the economic unit he had defined.\n\n      Sikes explained, however, that appraising real estate is an art, not a science,\n\nentailing a subjective, qualitative analysis. He stated that an appraiser looks at the\n\nmarketplace to find comparable properties.           He indicated that, the more\n\ncomparable properties an appraiser had to analyze, the better his analysis would be.\n\nSikes explained that, when a comparable property differs in terms of location, size,\n\n                                          7\n\futility availability, access, and frontage from the subject property being appraised,\n\nan appraiser makes adjustments to the valuation of the subject property.\n\n      Sikes testified that, if he were to value the property taken by the State as a\n\npart of the Chanas’ whole 7.765-acre tract, then he would not be valuing the\n\nproperty at its highest and best use. Sikes explained that property sells for more\n\nmoney per square foot when it is sold as a smaller tract of land. Sikes stated that,\n\nas a certified real estate appraiser, it was his job to determine the highest and best\n\nuse of the Chana’s property.\n\n      Based on his analysis, Sikes testified that the 2.385-acre economic unit,\n\ncontaining the condemned land, was worth $9.50 per square foot. Thus, the total\n\nvalue for the whole 2.385-acre economic unit would be $986,927.                 After\n\ndiscounting the portion of the economic unit that was not part of the condemnation,\n\nSikes testified that his “compensation estimate,” that is, the amount owed the\n\nChanas for the fair market value of the 2.072 acres acquired by the State, was\n\n$922,256.\n\n      At trial, the State offered the testimony of David Dominy, a certified real\n\nestate appraiser. He testified that, in his opinion, the Chanas’ property should be\n\nvalued as one whole 7.765-acre piece of property and that the subject property\n\ntaken by the State should be valued as a part of that whole. According to Dominy,\n\n                                          8\n\fthe market, in 2010, did not support dividing the Chanas’ property into separate\n\neconomic units.\n\n      According to Dominy, the highest and best use of the Chanas’ property was\n\n“future commercial development” after “some of the other vacant land in the\n\nmarket’s been absorbed and developed.” He stated, “[T]hen, at that point in time I\n\nbelieve commercial development would be viable.”\n\n      Dominy acknowledged that, in the area of the subject property, it had been a\n\ncommon practice to carve out and sell smaller economic units from larger tracts of\n\nland. But Dominy did not believe that, in 2010, this had been a viable option for\n\nthe Chana’s property. Dominy pointed out that there were large tracts of land\n\naround the Chanas’ property, which were vacant. Dominy emphasized that the\n\nsubject property also did not have much infrastructure in place. Because of the\n\nlack of infrastructure, Dominy indicated that the subject property was not\n\ncomparable to certain properties in the area that had been carved out of larger tracts\n\nof land and sold as separate economic units for as much as $20.00 a square foot.\n\nWhen asked, Dominy opined that some of the comparable properties utilized by\n\nSikes in his appraisal were not comparable to the subject property.          Dominy\n\nindicated that these other properties had more infrastructures in place than the\n\nsubject property and were more marketable as independent economic units.\n\n                                          9\n\f      To formulate his appraisal of the condemned property, Dominy relied on\n\ninformation from the sale of five properties, which he opined were comparable to\n\nthe Chanas’ property. Dominy utilized two of the same property sales as Sikes had\n\nused. The five properties relied on by Dominy ranged in size from .786 acres to\n\n4.813 acres in size. The sales price of these properties ranged from $3.67 to\n\n$12.95 per square foot.\n\n      Based on his analysis, utilizing the five comparable land sales, Dominy\n\nopined that the Chanas’ 7.76-acre tract was worth $5.00 per square foot. Using\n\nthat figure, Dominy explained the additional calculations he performed to arrive at\n\nthe amount owed the Chanas’ to compensate them for the State’s condemnation of\n\nthe 2.072 acres of their property. Dominy testified that, in his opinion, the total\n\ncompensation owed the Chanas’ was $484,735.00.\n\n      The jury was presented the following question: “What do you determine to\n\nbe the just compensation owed to the Chanas for the value of the part taken and\n\ndamages to the remainder as of November 29, 2010?” The jury responded by\n\nawarding the Chanas $922,256.000, which is the same amount as Sikes had\n\ntestified was owed to the Chanas.\n\n      The trial court rendered judgment on the jury’s verdict.        This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                                        10\n\f      On appeal, the State identifies four issues. In its first two issues, the State\n\nasserts that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting Sikes’ expert\n\ntestimony regarding the value of the condemned property. Relatedly, in its third\n\nissue, the State complains that the trial court erred by admitting documentary\n\nevidence of five of the comparable property sales relied on by Sikes in forming his\n\nappraisal of the condemned property. Lastly, in its fourth issue, the State asserts\n\nthat the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to admit a statement from a tax-\n\nprotest hearing in 2010 at which the Chanas had sought to lower the tax assessed\n\nvalue on the 7.765-acre tract.\n\n                   Admissibility of Sikes’s Opinion Testimony\n\n      In issues one and two, the State claims that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by admitting Sikes’s opinion testimony regarding the compensation\n\nowed to the Chanas as a result of the State’s taking.\n\nA.

See id. at 626. Kangieser testified regarding the fair market\n\nvalue of a pipeline easement taken by condemnation by Exxon. See id. The\n\nsupreme court restated the well-established legal standards applicable to valuing\n\nreal property in a condemnation proceeding:\n\n      Compensation for land taken by eminent domain is measured by the\n      fair-market value of the land at the time of the taking. The general\n      rule for determining fair-market value is the before-and-after rule,\n      which requires measuring the difference in the value of the land\n      immediately before and immediately after the taking. When, as here,\n      only part of the land is taken for an easement, a partial taking occurs.\n      In this situation, the before-and-after rule still applies, but\n      compensation is measured by the market value of the part taken plus\n      any diminution in value to the remainder of the land.\n\n            In determining market value, the project-enhancement rule\n      provides that the factfinder may not consider any enhancement to the\n      value of the land-owner’s property that results from the taking itself.\n      This is because the objective of the judicial process in the\n                                        14\n\f      condemnation context is to make the landowner whole.                 To\n      compensate a landowner for value attributable to the condemnation\n      project itself, however, would place the landowner in a better position\n      than he would have enjoyed had there been no condemnation. . . .\n\n             On the other hand, the factfinder may consider the highest and\n      best use to which the land taken can be adapted. The existing use of\n      the land, . . . is its presumed highest and best use, but the landowner\n      can rebut this presumption by showing a reasonable probability that\n      when the taking occurred, the property was adaptable and needed or\n      would likely be needed in the near future for another use.\n\n              Finally, Texas law permits landowners to introduce testimony\n      that the condemned land is a self-sufficient separate economic unit,\n      independent from the remainder of the parent tract with a different\n      highest and best use and different value from the remaining land. In\n      this situation, the market value of the severed land can be determined\n      without reference to the remaining land. But when the portion of the\n      land taken by eminent domain cannot be considered as a separate\n      economic unit, the before-and-after method requires determining\n      market value by evaluating the taken land as a proportionate part of\n      the remaining land.\n\nId. at 627–28 (internal citations omitted).\n\n      Applying these legal principles, the Zwahr court concluded that Kangieser’s\n\ntestimony was irrelevant, and therefore inadmissible, to determining the value of\n\nthe land taken from the Zwahrs; thus, the trial court had abused its discretion in\n\nadmitting Kangieser’s testimony. Id. at 631. The Zwahr court provided two rea-\n\nsons for its holding: (1) Kangieser had impermissibly premised his valuation of the\n\neasement on the fact of Exxon’s taking, in violation of the project-enhancement\n\n\n\n                                          15\n\frule, and (2) Kangieser had failed to utilize the before-and-after method in valuing\n\nthe easement. Id. at 630–31.\n\n       The supreme court concluded that “Kangieser’s testimony as a whole\n\nreveal[ed] that he premised his valuation on the fact of Exxon’s condemnation,\n\nthus improperly including project enhancement in that valuation.” Id. at 629. Of\n\nparticular relevance to the Zwahr court was Kangieser’s testimony that Exxon’s\n\ncondemnation defined the parameters of the economic unit.           Id. at 629–30.\n\nKangieser testified that the 1.01 acre easement acquired by Exxon was a separate\n\neconomic unit, which had a “highest and best use” as a pipeline easement. Id. at\n\n626, 629. Kangieser stated that Exxon’s taking “created the economic unit.” Id. at\n\n630.\n\n       The court also emphasized that “[n]ot only did Kangieser rely on the Exxon\n\nproject to establish a separate economic unit, he relied on Exxon’s condemnation\n\nto assign a value to the condemned land.” Id. The Exxon easement overlapped an\n\nexisting easement owned by Koch by 82%, or approximately .82 acres.              Id.\n\nKangieser testified that before Exxon’s project, the Zwahrs’ interest in the .82\n\nacres burdened by the Koch easement was of “negligible” or “nominal” value\n\nbecause it was an exclusive easement owned by Koch. Id. He then testified that\n\nonce Exxon received Koch’s consent to lay another pipeline within the easement,\n\n                                        16\n\fthe value of the .82–acres increased to $35,720 per acre, making the 1.01–acre\n\nExxon easement worth $36,077. Id. “In other words, had the Exxon project never\n\ncome along, the .82 acres would have continued to have no value to the Zwahrs.”\n\nId. In addition, Kangieser “admitted twice that the value he placed on the land did\n\nnot exist before Exxon’s condemnation.” Id.\n\n      Because Kangieser relied on Exxon’s condemnation in establishing a\n      separate economic unit and in assigning a value to that unit, his final\n      opinion reflected enhancement in the land’s value that occurred only\n      because of the Exxon project itself. As explained earlier, value that\n      exists because of the condemnation project is not, under the project-\n      enhancement rule, value for which a landowner may recover. . . . In\n      addition, after Kangieser identified the 1.01–acre tract as a separate\n      economic unit, he evaluated it without reference to the Zwahrs’ entire\n      49–acre tract. Thus at best, Kangieser determined the value of the\n      easement to Exxon, not the value of the loss to the Zwahrs for the\n      taking of the easement. . . . Kangieser failed to apply the before-and-\n      after valuation method, which would have required him to evaluate\n      the 1.01–acre as a proportionate part of the entire forty-nine acres.\n\nId. at 630–31 (citations omitted). The Zwahr court concluded that “Kangieser’s\n\ntestimony was irrelevant to determining the value of the land taken from the\n\nZwahrs and therefore inadmissible under Texas Rule of Evidence 702.” Id at 631.\n\nThe court held that the trial court had abused its discretion in admitting\n\nKangieser’s testimony.

In each case, the pipeline company, WesTTex,\n\nobjected to the testimony, asserting that the experts had impermissibly included\n\nproject enhancement in their appraisals by relying on WesTTex’s condemnation to\n\ndefine the economic unit and to compute the easement’s fair-market value.\n\nBaltzell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">21665312</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *2; Bulanek, 213 S.W.3d at 357. We agreed.\n\n      As in Zwahr, the experts in Baltzell and in Bulanek testified that the pipeline\n\neasements being acquired were separate economic units, thereby demonstrating\n\nthat the condemnation involved in each case defined the parameters of the\n\neconomic unit.

At the Chanas’ request, the State did not take a 30-foot\n\nstrip at the back of the originally-defined acquisition to provide drainage access to\n\nDinner Creek for the reminder of the Chanas’ property. This reduced the size of\n\nthe State’s acquisition from the 2.385 acres originally planned to the 2.072 acres\n\nthat was ultimately condemned.\n\n      The State points to Sikes’s testimony on direct examination in which he\n\nstated that the reason he valued the eastern portion of the Chanas’ 7.765-acre tract\n\nwas because “that’s what’s actually being taken here.” Also, near the end of his\n\ndirect examination, when asked whether he was “valuing that eastern [part of the\n\nproperty] because that’s where the state . . . took the property?” He answered,\n\n“Correct.”\n\n      The State further points to Sikes’s testimony on cross-examination in which\n\nhe acknowledged that the economic unit, appraised by him, appeared to be nearly\n\nidentical to the State’s originally-planned acquisition. He also acknowledged that,\n\nhad the State not agreed to move the southern boundary, the economic unit\n\nappraised by him would have had the same parameters as the State’s acquisition.\n\n\n\n\n                                         20\n\f      It is, however, useful to place the testimony cited by the State in context. In\n\nthis respect, Sikes testified as follows on cross-examination:\n\n      Q. [I]t’s your testimony that when you determine the size and shape of\n      this separate economic unit that would sell in the open place, you did\n      that based upon market data that you identified and not on the\n      acquisition?\n\n      A. I based it upon market data, you know, that the property would be\n      subdivided into three economic units.\n\n      Q. And you further said it’s going to be 2.3-acre—three point—2.385-\n      acre tract?\n\n      A. Yeah, that’s my opinion.\n\n      Q. Almost identical boundaries as the State’s acquisition?\n\n      A. That’s my opinion.\n\n      Q. And you did that based on market data, not the acquisition itself?\n\n      A. I looked at the market and how the property would be developed to\n      its highest and best use.\n\n      Q. And the State’s acquisition had absolutely no influence on your\n      articulation of the boundaries of your separate economic unit?\n\n      A. It’s—it is the economic unit.\n\n      Q. But that’s not what I asked. I asked you whether the State’s\n      acquisition had any influence on your articulation of the parameters of\n      your separate economic unit?\n\n      A. No, it didn’t.\n\n      Q. So, it’s just a coincidence that they’re virtually identical?\n                                          21\n\f      A. Well, yeah. It’s not a coincidence.         It’s based upon what’s\n      happening in the market.\n\n      Q. That’s right. It’s not based on the survey order here?\n\n      A. No. It’s not based upon the survey; but, you know, as we started\n      the process, the role is to estimate just compensation to the Chanas.\n\n      Sikes’s testimony on cross-examination was consistent with his testimony\n\ngiven on direct examination. During direct examination, testified as follows:\n\n      Q. Did you do that analysis with regard to your appraisal of the Chana\n      property?\n\n      A. I did.\n\n      Q. And what did you determine was the highest and best use for the\n      Chana property?\n\n      A. A commercial development. The vacant land would be developed\n      commercially.\n\n      Q. Is this also—well, let me ask you this, first of all: Are you, in fact,\n      required to value the Chana property as though it’s put to its highest\n      and best use in this proceeding?\n\n      A. That’s all appraisals, by the definition of market value.\n\n      Q. Okay. So, you determine a commercial use. Does that—is this\n      also—the highest and best use analysis also where you evaluate the\n      economic unit concept?\n\n      A. Exactly. They have over a 7-acre tract, but if you look in the\n      marketplace how the market was developed—you can look right\n      down the road and see these economic units cut out of this larger\n      parcel. That’s how this property would be developed. That would be\n                                         22\n\fthe highest and best use of the property. So, in my opinion, the\neconomic use is the highest and best use.\n\nQ. The economic unit—\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. —is the highest and best use?\n\nA. Economic unit.\n\nQ. Okay. And during the—there’s been some suggestion, maybe in\nopening statement or whatnot, that you—your economic unit has\nsome problems because it’s all the way on the eastern side of the\nproperty. Can you explain to the jury your overall analysis and why\nyou valued the part on the eastern portion of the property?\n\nA. Well, very commonsensical. That’s what’s actually being taken\nhere. The corner in Enchanted Oak is not being taken. We’re here to\nestimate the value of that acquisition. If you look at the property,\nwhere it’s located, the size of the parent tract, it could be cut up into\nthree different tracts. So, I’m looking at the economic unit based\nupon, okay, I've got a 7-acre parent tract; but if I look at the properties\nin the marketplace, everybody’s selling and developing smaller tracts\nout of the larger tract. I think the highest and best use of the Chanas’\n[property] would be the exact same, what the market is doing.\n\nQ. And so, when you say you determined an economic unit, you\nactually are—did you speak in terms of the whole property being\ndivided into multiple economic units?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Okay. So, there would be one—an economic unit at the hard\ncorner of Enchanted Creek?\n\n\n\n\n                                    </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span>\n\f<span class=\"reporter\">A.</span> <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> think you’re—you’re—if you look at the Chana property and\nlook at how the property was developed across the street, you can see\nhow it’s cut up.\n\nQ. But we’re talking in this lawsuit about the eastern and that—and\nyou valued the eastern economic unit.\n\nA. Correct. I didn’t value anything to the west of the . . . [line] there. I\njust valued that component, that economic unit.\n\nQ. Okay. And why did you value the eastern economic unit?\n\nA. Well, it’s my opinion that that property can stand on its own. It\ndoesn’t need the entire 7 acres. And if you look at other development\nthat’s. You know, just down the street from us, that’s how those\nproperties were developed.\n\nQ. Okay. But I’m kind of thinking even more basic than that. You\nsay two or three—three or four economic units on the Chana property.\nThat would be the highest and best use.\n\nA. You know multiple economic units.\n\nQ. Okay. But why are we talking about the ones to the east?\n\nA. Because they’re not taking the ones to the west.\n\nQ. Okay. So, in order to assist the jury when determining value, you\nvalued what the State is taking?\n\nA. Right, because it can stand alone.\n\nQ. If the State were taking the hard corner at enchanted Creek, would\nyou have valued an economic unit there?\n\nA. That would be a different analysis.\n\n\n\n                                    24\n\f      Q. Okay. But it would be—would it be correct to say that you only\n      carved out one economic unit from this property, and it’s all the way\n      to the eastern boundary of the property?\n\n      A. Correct.\n\n      Q. Would that be correct to say?\n\n      A. That would be correct.\n\n      Q. Okay. But—make sure—I don’t think we’re communicating.\n\n      A. Okay.\n\n      Q. Overall, you would carve up the Chana property into multiple\n      economic units?\n\n      A. Yeah. I think of the 7 acres, you’d have three economic units—\n      three different pad sites.\n\n      Q. Okay. And all my question is: If there’s a suggestion that you’re\n      only creating one economic unit on the property and it’s all the way to\n      the eastern boundary, that wouldn’t be correct, would it?\n\n      A. No.\n\n      Q. But you valued that one because that’s where they’re taking it?\n\n      A. Exact—exactly. And they’re not taking the—the other economic\n      units.\n\n      Sikes’s testimony stands in contrast to the testimony of the appraisal expert\n\nin Zwahr and in Baltzell. In Zwahr, the landowners’ expert testified that “Exxon’s\n\ncondemnation ‘created the economic unit,’” and that the 1.01 acre “did not exist\n\nuntil after the condemnation.” See Zwahr, 88 S.W.3d at 630.\n                                         25\n\f      Similarly, in Baltzell, the landowners’ experts determined the economic unit\n\nto be the same 5.47 acres of land that had been condemned for a pipeline easement.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">21665312</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *7. One of landowners’ appraisal experts testified that\n\n“WesTTex created the economic unit that I valued.” Id. at *5. Their other expert\n\ntestified that he adopted the pipeline easement as his economic unit and stated that\n\npipeline’s placement on the 5.47–acre strip of land was what made it a separate\n\neconomic unit. Id.\n\n      Here, unlike the experts in Zwahr and Baltzell, Sikes expressly denied using\n\nthe State’s original condemnation survey as the basis for his opinion regarding the\n\nboundaries of the economic unit. In addition, Sikes explained why he appraised\n\nthe eastern section of the Chanas’ property, taken by the State, as a separate\n\neconomic unit; that is, he explained the basis for his opinion.\n\n      Sikes testified that the highest and best use for the Chanas’ 7.765 acre tract\n\nwas to subdivide it into three separate, independent tracts to be sold individually\n\nfor commercial use. Sikes testified that this is how other comparable properties in\n\nthe area were selling at the relevant time. Larger properties like the Chanas were\n\nnot selling as a whole but were being divided and sold as smaller properties for\n\ncommercial use. Sikes stated that he appraised only the eastern most of the three\n\n\n\n\n                                         26\n\feconomic units because that economic unit contains the property condemned by\n\nthe State.\n\n      We conclude that the trial court had ample evidence to reject the State’s\n\nassertion that Sikes’s testimony violated the project-enhancement rule because the\n\neconomic unit appraised by Sikes had the same dimensions as the original\n\ncondemnation planned by the State. We hold that the trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion by refusing to exclude Sikes’s testimony on the ground that his appraisal\n\nviolated the project enhancement rule as set forth in Zwahr.\n\nC.    Separate Economic Unit\n\n      The State further assails Sikes’s valuation methodology by asserting that\n\nSikes should not have evaluated the condemned 2.072 acres as part of a separate\n\n2.385-acre economic unit; rather, the State asserts that Sikes should have evaluated\n\nthe condemned property as a proportionate part of the entire 7.765 acres owned by\n\nthe Chanas. To support this assertion, the State relies on the following language\n\nfrom Zwahr:\n\n      Texas law permits landowners to introduce testimony that the\n      condemned land is a self-sufficient separate economic unit,\n      independent from the remainder of the parent tract with a different\n      highest and best use and different value from the remaining land. In\n      this situation, the market value of the severed land can be determined\n      without reference to the remaining land. But when the portion of the\n      land taken by eminent domain cannot be considered as a separate\n      economic unit, the before-and-after method requires determining\n                                        27\n\f      market value by evaluating the taken land as a proportionate part of\n      the remaining land.\n\nZwahr, 88 S.W.3d at 628 (citations omitted). The State first asserts that, pursuant\n\nto the foregoing language in Zwahr, Sikes’s testimony did not establish that the\n\n2.385-acre tract he appraised was a separate economic unit because it did not have\n\na different highest and best use from the remainder of the Chanas’ property.\n\n      As shown above, Sikes testified that the highest and best use of the Chanas’\n\n7.765 acres was dividing it into three separate, self-sufficient tracts. The highest\n\nand best use for each of these individual parcels, including the one appraised by\n\nSikes, is commercial development.         Under this methodology, there is no\n\n“remaining property”; rather, the whole property is comprised of three separate,\n\nself-sufficient units. Nonetheless, Sikes’s testimony indicated that the highest and\n\nbest use of the 7.765-acre parent tract (division into three parcels) is not the same\n\nas the highest and best use for the economic unit appraised by Sikes (commercial\n\ndevelopment).\n\n      The State further asserts that Sikes’s testimony failed to show that the\n\nappraised economic unit was self-sufficient or independent from the remaining\n\nacreage. The State points to Sikes’s testimony in which he explained how access\n\nto the appraised economic unit could be gained. Sikes stated that there would be a\n\ndriveway on FM 529 for direct access. He also stated that access could be gained\n                                         28\n\ffrom Enchanted Creek Drive by cross-access over the two economic units to be\n\ndeveloped on the Chanas’ property. Sikes testified: “[Y]ou’re going to have a\n\nportion of access off 529; but since the Chanas own all that other property, you’re\n\ngoing to have cross access over to Enchanted [Creek], just like many of these tracts\n\nin the marketplace have cross access.”\n\n      The State argues that the appraised economic unit was not self-sufficient\n\nbecause cross-access to the unit would need to be through the other portions of the\n\nChanas’ property. We disagree that such evidence showed that the appraised\n\neconomic unit was not independent and self-sufficient. Sikes testified that the\n\neconomic unit would have its own direct access from FM 529, a major\n\nthoroughfare. In addition, Sikes indicated that, not only is cross-access common in\n\nthe market between economic units, it is beneficial to the economic unit and adds\n\nto its value: He testified:\n\n      You’d have what would be cross access around the front so you could\n      drive from the east to the west. Economic units, they like synergy.\n      They share customers. If you look at the properties right up here\n      (indicating), there is an access drive you can see there. And there’s\n      also an access drive back here (indicating). That’s how that property\n      was developed. You might have rear access, as well; but you’re going\n      to try to—you know, properties with more access are worth more than\n      properties with less access, all other things being equal.\n\n      The State further assails Sikes’s opinion that the appraised economic unit\n\nwas self-sufficient on the ground that “basic infrastructure,” such as sewer and\n                                         29\n\fwater, had not been developed on the unit. However, a review of the record\n\nreveals that the State’s claim of the lack of basic infrastructure is not entirely\n\naccurate.\n\n      The State points out that, although a sanitary sewer line existed on the\n\nwestern boundary of the Chanas’ 7.765-acre tract, the line would need to be\n\nextended 550 feet to reach the appraised economic unit. However, Sikes testified,\n\n“That’s [i.e., 550 feet] fairly close for this type of development.”\n\n      The evidence also showed that a water line ran along the northern boundary\n\nof the appraised economic unit and a storm sewer existed on the property’s\n\nsouthern border. The evidence further showed that the property was within a\n\nmunicipal utility district (MUD).       Sikes testified that much of the costs of\n\ndeveloping the infrastructure were reimbursable from the MUD, although he\n\nacknowledged that reimbursement was not guaranteed.\n\n      In addition, the State assails Sikes’s appraisal of the property as a separate\n\neconomic unit on the ground that the Chanas’ property had not been previously\n\npartitioned or marketed as a separate 2.385-acre tract. The State also asserts that\n\nthis rendered Sikes’s opinion “too speculative to be admitted as direct evidence of\n\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\fmarket value.”1 In support of this assertion, the State relies on State v.

Sikes testified that the highest and best use of the Chanas’ entire\n\nproperty was partitioning it into three separate tracts, which could each be sold for\n\ncommercial development. Sikes explained that his opinion was supported by what\n\nhe found was happening in the market in the area surrounding the property. He\n\nstated that larger parcels, such as the Chanas’ 7.765-acre tract, were not being sold\n\nas whole properties for future development. Rather, the sales in the area showed\n\nthat smaller tracts were being sold from larger tracts to be used for development of\n\na single commercial enterprise. Because it is distinguishable, the holding in Willey\n\ndoes not negate Sikes’s designation of the 2.385-acre tract as a separate economic\n\nunit or render his opinion speculative.\n\n      Sharboneau involved the condemnation of a 10-acre tract of land to be used\n\nfor a city park. See 48 S.W.3d at 180. Before trial, the parties stipulated that the\n\nhighest and best use for the land was a residential subdivision. Id. At trial, the\n\nlandowners’ expert used the subdivision development method to appraise the\n\ncondemned land. Id. “This method values an undeveloped tract by calculating\n\nwhat a developer could expect to realize from sales of individual lots, taking into\n\naccount the costs of development and discounting future revenues to present\n\nvalue.” Id. The analysis employed by the landowner’s expert under the\n\n                                          32\n\fsubdivision development method was complicated and complex. See id. at 180–\n\n81.\n\n      In contrast, the city’s expert in Sharboneau used the comparable-sales\n\nmethod of appraisal to determine the land’s value. Id. The city’s expert offered\n\nevidence of three comparable land sales that were suitable for residential\n\ndevelopment.    Id.    The city’s expert determined the value of the condemned\n\nproperty after making adjustments to the three comparable properties to\n\ncompensate for their varying characteristics. Id.\n\n      The Sharboneau court explained that the subdivision development method is\n\ndistinct from the comparable sales approach.         Id. at 183–84.      “Although\n\nsubdivision development analysis requires the appraiser to examine the market for\n\nready-to-build lots, such properties are not comparable to the larger, unsubdivided\n\nproperty actually being appraised.\n\n      The court also recognized that “[c]ourts have long favored the comparable\n\nsales approach when determining the market value of real property.” Id. at 182.\n\nThe court continued,\n\n      If the goal of an appraisal is to ascertain market value, then logically\n      there can be no better guide than the prices that willing buyers and\n      sellers actually negotiate in the relevant market. Under a comparable\n      sales analysis, the appraiser finds data for sales of similar property,\n      then makes upward or downward adjustments to these sales prices\n      based on differences in the subject property.\n                                         33\n\fId.\n\n      Ultimately, the Sharboneau court recognized that the subdivision\n\ndevelopment method may be a valid appraisal methodology for undeveloped land.\n\nId. at 186. However, the court held the subdivision development method could not\n\nserve as a basis for the judgment in that case because the expert’s opinion “did not\n\ndemonstrate what a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller in the relevant\n\nmarket”; thus it was not reliable or relevant. Id.\n\n      Unlike the landowner’s expert in Sharboneau, Sikes did not appraise the\n\ncondemned property in this case utilizing the subdivision development method.\n\nRather, as the city’s expert did in Sharboneau, Sikes appraised the property using\n\nthe comparable-sales method.\n\n      In addition, we note that the Supreme Court of Texas distinguished\n\nSharboneau in a case in which the landowner asserted that the highest and best use\n\nof a 39-acre tract, condemned out of a 185-acre tract, was to partition the 39-acres\n\ninto several individual tracts that could be sold as highway frontage commercial\n\nproperty. In re State, 355 S.W.3d at 615–16. Distinguishing Sharboneau, the\n\nState court wrote:\n\n      In a 10–acre tract like that considered in Sharboneau, it is unlikely\n      that a 1/44th-tract lot would be bought for residential purposes unless\n      the entirety of the residential subdivision had been planned and\n                                          34\n\f      created, and substantial funds had been invested. Inferences like these\n      are unnecessary to support the sale of parcels such as those into which\n      the [landowners] divided their property. The costs of dividing raw\n      land are insubstantial. If the [landowners] were to offer evidence that\n      the typical size of highway-frontage commercial parcels was similar\n      to their subdivided parcels, and that those parcels were similarly\n      appropriate for that use, it would not be speculative to permit them to\n      admit valuation evidence on that basis. Of course, the State would be\n      permitted to offer its own evidence that the land was best valued as a\n      single unit.\n\nId. at 616.\n\n      This reasoning also applies in this case. Valuing the separate economic unit\n\nappraised by Sikes does not involve the same inferences that would be required to\n\nvalue a residential tract in an undeveloped residential subdivision. See id. Here,\n\nthrough Sikes, the Chanas offered evidence showing that similarly sized and\n\nsituated parcels of land, comparable to the economic unit appraised by Sikes, were\n\nbeing purchased in the vicinity for commercial development. 2 Thus, it was not\n\nspeculative for the Chanas to offer valuation evidence based on the premise that\n\nthe appraised economic unit was a separate, self-sufficient unit. See id. In short,\n\nthe holding in Sharboneau does not serve to render the basis for Sikes’s opinion\n\nspeculative. We hold that the State has not shown that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by refusing to grant its motion to exclude the opinion testimony of Sikes\n\n\n2\n      As discussed infra, the State objects to the admission of only five out of the ten\n      comparable land sales relied on by Sikes.\n                                          35\n\fon the basis that the 2.385-acre tract, containing the condemned property, could not\n\nbe valued as a separate economic unit.\n\n      We overrule the State’s first and second issues.\n\n                Admissibility of Five Comparable Property Sales\n\n      In its third issue, the State asserts that the trial court abused its discretion by\n\nadmitting into evidence certain property sales. Through Sikes, the Chanas offered\n\ninto evidence ten property sales, which they asserted were comparable to the\n\neconomic unit appraised by Sikes. The State objected to the admission of five of\n\nthese sales: Chana Sale Numbers 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. The State asserted that these\n\nfive sales were not comparable to the condemned property because each sale had\n\ninvolved land that was part of an existing commercial subdivision, located at a\n\nbusy intersection, with developed ready-to-build “pad sites,” and infrastructure\n\nalready in place. See Sharboneau, 48 S.W.3d at 182 (“Comparable sales must . . .\n\ntake place near in time to the condemnation, occur in the vicinity of the condemned\n\nproperty, and involve land with similar characteristics.”). The State averred that,\n\nin contrast, the Chanas’ property was “raw,” “undeveloped,” and not subdivided.\n\nThe State has also asserted that it would be unlikely that the appraised economic\n\nunit would be the first parcel to sell out of the Chanas’ land because it is an interior\n\ntract, not the corner tract of the property.\n\n                                           36\n\f      We review the trial court’s decision to admit or exclude evidence for an\n\nabuse of discretion.

This in turn\n\nsupported Sikes’ opinion that the appraised tract was a separate economic unit.\n\nHowever, there were other sales admitted into evidence involving a sale of a\n\nsmaller tract sold out of a larger tract. Chana Sale Number 1, of which the State\n\ndoes not complain, also involved the sale of a parcel of land, 2.167 acres, that was\n\nsold from a larger tract. This tract was less than one mile from the Chanas’ land,\n\n                                        38\n\fwas equivalent in size to the appraised economic unit, and sold for $19.07 per\n\nsquare foot.\n\n      In addition, through its expert, Dominy, the State also offered into evidence\n\na sale in which a smaller tract of land had been sold out a larger tract. The State’s\n\nSale Number 1 involved the sale of a 1.19-acre tract that sat at an intersection.\n\nThat tract had been sold off from a larger tract of land. In addition, on cross-\n\nexamination, Dominy acknowledged that the 1.19-acre tract had not been the first\n\nsmaller tract to sell from that larger tract. He admitted that the first smaller tract to\n\nsell had been a tract “away from the intersection.” As the Chanas point out, a tract\n\n“away from the intersection” would be similarly situated to the economic unit\n\nappraised by Sikes in this case.\n\n      In addition, Chana Sale Numbers 1, 2, 3, 7, and 10, of which the State does\n\nnot complain, also provided support for the jury’s monetary award. These land\n\nsales involved property that sold from $7.70 to $19.07 per square foot. Sikes\n\ntestified that he valued the condemned property to be worth $9.50 per square foot\n\nwith the total compensation due the Chanas to be $922,256.00. Thus, Chana Sale\n\nNumbers 1, 2, 3, 7, and 10 support the monetary award.\n\n\n\n\n                                           39\n\f      We hold that the trial court’s error, if any, in admitting Chana Sale Numbers\n\n4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 was harmless error. See TEX. R. APP. P. 44.1(a)(1). We overrule\n\nthe State’s third issue.\n\n                           Exclusion of Tax Protest Records\n\n      In its fourth issue, the State asserts that the trial court abused its discretion\n\nwhen it excluded testimony from a tax-protest hearing in which the Chanas\n\nchallenged the taxes assessed on the property.\n\n      Four months before the date of the taking in this case, Brandon Fisher, a tax\n\nconsultant, appeared on behalf of the Chanas before the Harris County Appraisal\n\nReview Board to protest the taxes assessed on the Chanas’ property. Fisher stated\n\nunder oath at the hearing that the market value of the Chanas’ 7.765-acre tract was\n\n$3.24 per square foot.\n\n      The State sought to admit the record of the tax-protest hearing, asserting that\n\nFisher’s statement, as to the market value of the property, was admissible as an\n\nadmission or a statement against interest. See TEX. R. EVID. 801(e). The Chanas\n\nfiled a motion to exclude the tax-protest hearing record.        They asserted that,\n\npursuant to Rule of Evidence 403, the probative value of the evidence was\n\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and would confuse the issues for the\n\njury. See TEX. R. EVID. 403.\n\n                                         40\n\f      Following a pretrial hearing, the trial court granted the Chanas’ motion to\n\nexclude tax protest hearing record. The trial court stated that “using . . . Rule 403,\n\nI do believe the probative value of this tax protest record is substantially\n\noutweighed by the risk of unduly prejudice[ing] and confusing the jury.”\n\n      During trial, the State requested the trial court to reconsider its ruling on the\n\nChanas’ motion to exclude the tax protest evidence. The trial court denied the\n\nmotion to reconsider. The State made an offer of proof for the appellate record\n\nwith respect to the transcript of the tax-protest hearing.\n\n      On appeal, the State asserts that the trial court erred by excluding the\n\nevidence because “[i]t is clearly established under Texas law that a property\n\nowner’s prior statements regarding fair market value of the owner’s property are\n\nadmissible as substantive evidence in an eminent domain proceeding when the\n\nproperty owner participates in or adopts the declared value.” The State further\n\navers, “This rule applies even where the prior statements of value were generated\n\nfor tax purposes.”\n\n      In their brief, the Chanas do not dispute “that evidence of a tax rendition\n\nvaluation can be admissible as an admission, or a statement against interest . . . .”\n\nThe Chanas assert, however, that the State sought to admit more than just Fisher’s\n\nstatement of the property’s value. Rather, at the hearing in the trial court, the State\n\n                                          41\n\fmade clear that it sought to admit the entire transcript of the tax protest hearing\n\ninto evidence. 3\n\n      At the tax-protest hearing, Fisher sought to lower the tax assessed value on\n\nthe Chana’s entire 7.785-acre property to $3.24 per square foot. To support this\n\nvaluation, Fisher relied on three property sales and six property listings in the area\n\nof the Chanas’ property. Before the appraisal review board, Fisher testified as\n\nfollows:\n\n      I’m looking at some comparable properties in the area and I found\n      three sales, six listings. I think the listings definitely overpower the\n      sales. In fact, there was only a couple of indicated sales in the area,\n      especially because it’s hard to find sales in this size. Subject’s almost\n      eight acres. Most of the properties in the area that are selling are\n      much smaller tracts. Based on the listings of these properties and\n      three sales, the median indicated value per square foot is $3.24 a\n      square [foot], divide that by the subject property, gives me a value of\n      [$] 1,095,975.\n\n             The next couple pages are just a break down of their sales, their\n      size, and also the listings, as well. . . .\n\n\n3\n      At the pretrial hearing on the motion to exclude, the trial court asked, “The records\n      we are talking about here are not only their Exhibit D, right, the hearing affidavit,\n      but you’re also talking about [the] testimony on the records?” The State\n      responded that it had brought the file from the proceeding, including an audio\n      recording of the tax protest hearing. The trial court then asked, “[P]lease tell me\n      what kind of records we’re talking about. So in addition to the audio-recording,\n      what else are we talking about?” The State responded that there was “[a] sworn\n      affidavit from Mr. Fisher testifying as to market value of the property . . . [a]nd\n      then the hearing evidence that they submitted in support of his opinion where he\n      opines that the property is valued at $3.24 per square foot . . . .” Later, during its\n      offer of proof, the State offered the entire transcript from the tax protest hearing.\n                                            42\n\fFisher then proceeded to discuss a number of the comparable sales and listings on\n\nwhich he based his valuation.\n\n      As shown in the foregoing excerpt, Fisher testified that he formulated his\n\nopinion regarding the value of the property based—not only on what he regarded\n\nas comparable sales—but also on property listings, which he stated “overpowered”\n\nthe comparable sales information.      The Chanas correctly point out that, in a\n\ncondemnation suit, evidence of the price for which a similar property is being\n\noffered for sale is not admissible evidence to establish the fair market value of the\n\ncondemned property. We have previously recognized, “The law is well settled that\n\nunaccepted offers to buy or sell are incompetent evidence of land value in\n\ncondemnation suits.” State v.

See Clevenger, 384 S.W.2d at\n\n209. The State made no attempt to segregate this inadmissible evidence from the\n\nadmissible evidence from the tax hearing. “It is well settled that where evidence is\n\noffered as a whole, only a part of which is admissible, the court does not commit\n\nerror in sustaining an objection to such testimony, and in such case it is not the\n\nduty of the court or the party objecting thereto to separate the admissible from the\n\ninadmissible.” Perry v.
