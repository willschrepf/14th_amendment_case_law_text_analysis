CLEMENT , JR., J., joined.\n\nPhillip L. Davidson, Nashville, Tennessee, for the appellant, Raymond P. White.\n\nPeggy L. Tolson, Catherine Schmidt, Brentwood, Tennessee, for the appellee, Hickman County,\nTennessee.\n\n                                            OPINION\n\n       Plaintiffs are residents of Hickman County, Tennessee, and brought this suit seeking relief\nfrom payment of disposal fees imposed by the County for solid waste disposal.\n\n        By chapter 451 of the Public Acts of 1991, Tennessee adopted the Solid Waste Management\nAct. This Act was codified as Tennessee Code Annotated Title 68, parts 8 and 9. Pursuant to\nTennessee Code Annotated section 68-9-211, the county legislative body of Hickman County, on\nApril 18, 1994, declared Hickman County to be a solid waste region and undertook by committee\nto establish a 10-year Municipal Solid Waste Management Plan. Following the development of such\nplan, the Hickman County legislative body, on September 19, 1994, adopted Resolution No. 9456\nimplementing the 10-year Municipal Solid Waste Management Plan. On October 16, 1995, the\n\fHickman County legislative body adopted Resolution No. 9570, which, pursuant to Tennessee Code\nAnnotated section 68-211-835, imposed a fee schedule for solid waste disposal services. This\nResolution provided in pertinent part:\n\n              SECTION 1: Pursuant to § 68-211-835, Tennessee Code Annotated, the\n       following fee schedule for Municipal Solid Waste Disposal in Hickman County is\n       hereby adopted:\n\n              RESIDENTIAL – $ 90.00 per dwelling unit per year\n              BUSINESS    – $180.00 per business unit per year\n              INDUSTRIAL – $ 10.00 per ton over disposal cost\n\n               SECTION 2: RESIDENTIAL and BUSINESS MSW FEES shall be billed\n       semi-annually to the owner of the residential or business unit. Residential and\n       Business billing, including home-based businesses, shall be determined by how the\n       property is listed in the Hickman County Assessor’s Office. Owners of multi-unit\n       residential property shall be billed for each unit. The Hickman County Finance office\n       shall be responsible for billing and collecting such fees.\n\n              ....\n\n              SECTION 7: Elderly and disabled property owners qualifying for property\n       tax reductions, according to records in the Hickman County Trustee’s Office, shall\n       also qualify for a like deduction in MSW Fees.\n\n              ....\n\n               SECTION 9: The fees generated by this resolution shall be deposited into the\n       Hickman County Solid Waste Management Fund and shall be used only for the\n       purpose for which they were collected. The amount of fees charged may be adjusted\n       as required, but shall at all times bear a reasonable relationship to the cost of\n       providing solid waste disposal. All residents of the county shall have equat (sic)\n       access to the services provided.\n\n      On May 19, 1997, the Hickman County legislative body further amended Resolution No.\n9570 by the adoption of Resolution No. 9724 providing in pertinent part:\n\n             SECTION 1: The following terms which are used throughout the Hickman\n       County Solid Waste program are hereby defined as follows:\n\n              RESIDENTIAL            --      Any dwelling unit constructed for human\n                                             habitation, either in use or intended for use\n                                             during the current billing cycle.\n\n\n                                               -2-\n\f       NON-PERMANENT --                Any dwelling unit used only for recreation\n                                       purposes or as a part-time residence (hunting\n                                       cabins, etc.)\n\n       COMMERCIAL              –       Any for-profit, non-profit or not-for-profit\n                                       business and/or organization that buys and/or\n                                       sells as retail or wholesale, or is service\n                                       related, including assembly and or\n                                       construction. Commercial customers shall be\n                                       classified into one of five waste generators.\n\n       INDUSTRIAL              --      Any business whose main purpose is\n                                       manufacturing or the production of a specific\n                                       product or products, and any entity whose\n                                       waste volume fluctuates and is deemed to be\n                                       out of compliance with current Commercial\n                                       Classifications. Waste shall be delivered\n                                       directly to the Hickman County Solid Waste\n                                       Transfer Station where it will be weighed and\n                                       billed through a pre-approved charge account.\n\n        SECTION 2: Sections 1, 2, and 3 of Resolution No. 9570, with respect to\nBusiness or Commercial accounts and the fee charged to them is hereby changed to\nthe following five classifications and fees:\n\n        Class A – In-Home Business (residential fee exempt)        $125.00 annually\n        Class B – Extra Small (up to 2 cu.yds per week             $ 90.00 annually\n        Class C – Small (above 2 and up to 5 cu.yds. per           $150.00 annually\n        week)\n        Class D – Medium (above 5 and up to 10 cu.yds.per          $300.00 annually\n        week\n        Class E – Large (above 10 cu.yds. per week)                $600.00 annually\n\nThe above fees will be billed annually on the first day of July of each year and shall\nbe due and payable by September 30 of each year. This change shall become\neffective upon July 1, 1997, and customers shall be credited for any payment made\nprior to this change with respect to the current billing cycle.\n\n        SECTION 3: Section 7 of Resolution No. 9570 is hereby further amended\nto include a fifty percent (50%) exemption for low income households based upon\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f       the most current poverty guideline index as prepared by the Federal government.\n       Persons desiring to take advantage of this exemption shall furnish a copy of the\n       household most recent IRS 1040 statement. Additionally, there is hereby authorized\n       a fifty percent (50%) exemption for hunting cabins and second homes (cabins and\n       homes which are used only for part-time recreational purposes). The aforementioned\n       exemptions shall be in effect retroactively to residential billing for the first half of the\n       calendar year 1997. Also, retroactively effective to July 1, 1996, all churches are\n       hereby exempt from solid waste fees unless they have a daily operation or program\n       (day school, etc.). In such cases, they shall be billed according to the current\n       Commercial billing system.\n\n         Contemporaneously with Resolution No. 9570, the county legislative body, in October of\n1995, approved Resolution Nos. 9571 and 9572 authorizing capital outlay notes in the respective\namounts of $900,000 and $700,000. The $900,000 note was issued for the purpose of financing the\ncost of final closure of the existing landfill and to establish a reserve for post-closure care of that\nfacility. The $700,000 note was issued for the purpose of constructing a transfer station and two (2)\nconvenience centers, together with building roads, grading and purchasing equipment for the solid\nwaste disposal department. Both of these notes contained language mandated by Tennessee Code\nAnnotated section 9-21-603, same being:\n\n       That, the Notes shall be direct general obligations of Hickman County and Hickman\n       County hereby pledges its taxing power as to all taxable property in Hickman County\n       for the purpose of providing funds for the payment of principal and interest on the\n       Notes. The Legislative Body of Hickman County hereby authorizes the levy and\n       collection of a special tax on all taxable property of Hickman County to create a\n       sinking fund to retire the Notes with interest as they mature in an amount necessary\n       for that purpose.\n\n       There were seven original plaintiffs, five of whom were owners of business property in\nHickman County and two of whom were owners of residential property in Hickman County. The\nlawsuit, in a nutshell, is stated in the Complaint:\n\n              3.1. That the fee set forth in the Resolution collects more funds than are\n       required to meet services.\n\n               3.2.    That the fee is not being levied in a uniform, non-discriminatory\n       manner. Some owners of property described in the Resolution are not charged.\n       Some residents are being charged, but receive no services. Others are not charged\n       equally such as elderly and disabled persons, business on property where the\n       taxpayers homes are also located are charged unequally in relation to taxpayers who\n       run a small business out of their homes. Some industrial users pay less of a fee than\n       business and residential property owners.\n\n\n\n                                                   -4-\n\f             3.3. The fee is not equally levied in that some property owners are granted\n       exemptions by an arbitrary method known only to County officials.\n\n              3.4. The disposal fee heretofore set forth and described in paragraph 2.6\n       (Exhibit A) violates the Tennessee Solid Waste Management Act, Tenn. Code Ann.\n       68-211-101, et seq., in that it collects funds not solely used for solid waste\n       management purposes and is not uniformly assessed against all Hickman County\n       residents.\n\n              WHEREFORE, the plaintiffs, demand the following relief.\n\n              1. That this Court grant them a hearing at which time the issues raised in\n       this complaint may be fully adjudicated.\n\n              2. That this court Declare the Resolution (Exhibit A) to be in violation of\n       Tennessee Code Ann. §§ 68-24-101, et seq., or in the alternate, that the County has\n       exceeded its legal authority by its continued implementation of the Resolution.\n\n              3. That the Court order that the County reimburse all county citizens who\n       have paid fees set forth by the Resolution they have paid to the County.\n\n              4.    That the Court grant such other and further relief as it deems proper.\n\n       After a considerable amount of discovery, the case was heard on November 20, 2002, before\nthe Honorable R.E. Lee Davies, circuit judge, on Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment. This\nhearing resulted in an Order of December 17, 2002, providing in pertinent part:\n\n              This case presents three issues for determination by the Court.\n\n              1. Whether the fees charged by Defendants for the providing of solid waste\n       disposal services bears a reasonable relationship to the costs of providing said\n       services;\n              2. Whether the fees collected by Defendant’s solid waste disposal fund are\n       properly segregated and only used for solid waste purposes; and\n              3. Whether the exemption process utilized by the County for the payment of\n       solid waste disposal services is uniformly applied under the equal protection clause.\n\n               With regard to the first issue, the Court finds that summary judgment is\n       proper. T.C.A. § 68-211-835(g)(1) requires that the fees charged bear a reasonable\n       relationship to the cost of providing solid waste services. This does not require that\n       the amount charged be identified with mathematical certainty. The undisputed\n       testimony of the State Auditor who is responsible for auditing the Fund reveals that\n       the Fund is losing money. Thus, no unreasonable relationship between fees and\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f       services exists as the Fund is not making a profit. The Auditor further testified that\n       this Fund is required to be maintained as a Enterprise Fund and the accrual method\n       of accounting is the proper method for evaluating the profitability of the this (sic)\n       fund. Plaintiffs have offered no expert proof to contradict these facts, therefore,\n       summary judgment on this issue is GRANTED.\n\n               The statute requires fees to be segregated from the general fund and used only\n       for the purpose collected. The funds generated are to be used to establish and\n       maintain solid waste collection and disposal services. With regard to this second\n       issue, as a matter of law, this Court finds that the capital outlay notes in the amount\n       of $700,000.00 and $900,000.00 are start up costs for the Fund and are properly\n       payable from this Fund. However, disputed issues of fact remain regarding whether\n       funds transferred from this Solid Waste Fund to the County’s General Fund are\n       properly being used to retire these notes. Moreover, there remains questions with\n       regard to the authority of the County to make repayment of the notes from the Solid\n       Waste Disposal Fund based upon the language of Resolution Nos. 9571 and 9572\n       authorizing the County to incur the notes. Summary judgment is therefore DENIED\n       with regard to these issues at this time.\n\n               Finally, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have no standing to complain about\n       how property owners other than themselves may have been mistreated in relationship\n       to the exemption process established by the County for payment of solid waste\n       disposal fees. However, the Plaintiffs may be able to show that others are being\n       treated more favorably than Plaintiffs and, if so, they will have met their prima facie\n       burden of proof. The Court finds that, with the passage of Resolution No. 9724\n       amending the original Resolution No. 9570, the current Resolution, as written,\n       containing exemptions is not arbitrary and has a rational basis in fact and has\n       corrected any prior inequities. Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment with\n       regard to this third issued is, therefore, DENIED at this time, but Plaintiffs’ proof is\n       limited to post-amendment examples of unequal treatment, if any.\n\n         The first question to be resolved is whether or not the grant of summary judgment by Judge\nDavies is correct in holding that the fees charged by Defendant for the providing of solid waste\ndisposal services bears a reasonable relationship to the cost of providing said services. The answer\nto this question depends on whether or not we are concerned with a cash basis accounting method\nas opposed to an accrual accounting method. The Supreme Court has held:\n\n       The Solid Waste Management Act expressly regulates the imposition, collection, and\n       use of fees and surcharges by the state and local governments; it limits the use of\n       proceeds collected by local governments; and it requires that the comprehensive plan\n       for the management of solid waste include a uniform accounting system developed\n       by the State comptroller.\n\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\fCity of Tullahoma v. Bedford County, 938 S.W.2d 408, 413-14 (Tenn.1997).\n\n       Tennessee Code Annotated section 68-211-874 (2000) provides:\n\n          68-211-874. Accounting for financial activities — Funds — Uniform solid\n       waste financial accounting system — Development — Approval — Requirement\n       for state funds. — (a) Each county, solid waste authority and municipality shall\n       account for financial activities related to the management of solid waste in either a\n       special revenue fund or an enterprise fund established expressly for that purpose.\n       Any county, solid waste authority or municipality that operates a landfill and/or\n       incinerator shall account for financial activities related specifically to that landfill\n       and/or incinerator in an enterprise fund. Each county, solid waste authority and\n       municipality shall use a uniform solid waste financial accounting system and chart\n       of accounts developed by the comptroller of the treasury.\n           (b) The comptroller of the treasury is directed to develop a uniform financial\n       accounting system conforming to generally accepted accounting principles for use as\n       required by this section.\n            (c) Such uniform accounting system shall be subject to the approval of the\n       commissioner of finance and administration. Upon such approval, each county shall\n       establish and maintain the uniform solid waste financial accounting system.\n         (d) No state funds for solid waste management shall be released to a county, solid\n       waste authority or municipality unless financial activities related to the management\n       of solid waste are accounted for in either a special revenue fund or an enterprise fund\n       established solely for that purpose. No state funds for solid waste management shall\n       be released to a county, solid waste authority or municipality that operates a landfill\n       and/or incinerator unless financial activities related to that landfill and/or incinerator\n       are accounted for in an enterprise fund.\n\n         The documentary evidence before the Court, using a cash flow analysis, creates at least a\nmaterial question of fact as to whether or not the fees generated are excessive. The undisputed\nexpert proof, however, establishes that the solid waste management fund in Hickman County is an\n“enterprise fund” as defined in section 68-211-874 of the Code and as developed by the comptroller\nof the treasury pursuant to that same statute.\n\n        The expert testimony offered by Jerry Durham, state auditor employed by the comptroller of\nthe treasury, established that the County was required by state law to begin operating the solid waste\ndisposal system under “an enterprise fund,” which requires an accrual basis of accounting rather than\na cash basis. At the start of the operation, the County contributed to the enterprise fund all\nequipment, land and buildings, together with related property, which contributions form\nintergovernmental contributed capital. Long-term obligations must be provided for under the accrual\nmethod and taken into consideration in determining the financial performance of the enterprise fund.\nMr. Durham testified:\n\n\n\n                                                  -7-\n\f       Q             Overall, did you find that the fund was, from inception, was making\n       money or losing money?\n\n       A               It was typically losing money.\n\n       Q                 And that’s what accounts for even as of the last completed audit\n       period, a nearly three-quarter of a million dollar retained earnings?\n\n       A              That and, of course, the fact that everything is recorded on the accrual\n       basis of accounting, which requires your post closure care cost to be recorded now\n       even though you’re going to be paying for them over 30 years. And that requires the\n       booking of that $900,000 note, even though you’re going to be paying for that over\n       whatever the life of the loan would be. So, when you look at your assets compared\n       to your liabilities, and because you’ve booked these two large liabilities, it makes\n       your deficit look worse than you might consider it to be. But it is a true deficit based\n       upon generally accepted accounting principles.\n\n        The familiar standard of appellate review relative to a grant of summary judgment requires\nthat the record before this Court affirmatively disclose that there is no genuine issue of material fact\nwarranting trial. The moving party has the burden of showing the court that there are no disputed\nmaterial facts and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Byrd v. Hall, 847\nS.W.2d 208 (Tenn.1993). This expert testimony being undisputed, the results of a cash basis\naccounting would be immaterial, and summary judgment was properly granted.\n\n        Appellants next complain of the method used by the County for the payback of the two\ncapital outlay notes by which money was procured to close the existing Hickman County Landfill\nand to construct new landfill facilities.\n\n        At the outset, these two capital outlay notes were approved by the Hickman County\nlegislative body and forwarded to the comptroller of the treasury on October 18, 1995. The letter\nfrom Hickman County Executive Steve Gregory to the director of local finance of the office of the\ncomptroller provided:\n\n       Enclosed you will find two Capital Outlay Notes recently approved by the Hickman\n       County Legislative Body. Both have to do with solid waste, but were separated\n       because they will be utilized at different times and will be paid back by different\n       means.\n\n       The first, Resolution No. 9571, is for an amount not to exceed $900,000. This is for\n       closure of current cells at the Hickman County Landfill, and we do not plan to\n       execute this note until next spring. The note will be retired through the General Debt\n       Service.\n\n\n\n                                                  -8-\n\f       The second, Resolution No. 9572, is for and (sic) amount not to exceed $700,000 and\n       will be executed as soon as possible. The note is for construction of landfill facilities\n       and will be retired through user fees generated by the Hickman County Solid Waste\n       Department.\n\n       Regardless of the source of funds contemplated by the County legislative body to be used for\nthe payback of these two capital outlay notes, state law found in section 9-21-603 of the Code\nrequires that both notes be general obligations of Hickman County and that Hickman County\n“pledges its taxing power as to all taxable property in Hickman County for the purpose of providing\nfunds for the payment of principal and interest on the notes.”\n\n        The problem lies with the insistence of Plaintiffs that the method contemplated for repayment\nof the notes by the County legislative body had to, in fact, be put into place and followed in the\nfuture. The trial court held:\n\n       21. Initially, the $900,000 note was to be retired through the County’s General Debt\n           Service Fund, and the $700,000 note was to be retired from income generated\n           by the Solid Waste Disposal Fund.\n\n       22. After the recommendation of the state auditor, the County began paying the\n           $900,000 note from the Solid Waste Disposal Fund and the $700,000 note from\n           the General Debt Service Fund.\n\n        How the County chose to pay back the money has no bearing on the fact that both of the\nnotes, by their terms and by statutory mandate, constituted general obligations of the County. Since\nthe proceeds of both notes were contributed by the County to the enterprise fund, as clearly reflected\nin the Enterprise Fund Audit Report of June 30, 1996, the future payback of these notes plus interest\nhad to be attributed to the enterprise fund under the accrual method of accounting. This is the\nundisputed testimony of State Auditor Jerry Durham. He testified, while reviewing the June 30,\n1997, audit of the enterprise fund:\n\n       Q               Total expenses 910,515?\n\n       A               Right.\n\n       Q               Did this 910,515 include post closure care costs?\n\n       A               Yes, it did.\n\n       Q                Can you explain, and we’re going to see this several times in some\n       of these audits, so we might as well go ahead and explain this now. What is, to your\n       understanding, is post closure care cost here?\n\n\n\n                                                 -9-\n\fA               Post closure care costs are a percentage of a figure that is calculated\nby an engineer of how much it’s going to cost to close and then to maintain closure\nof a land fill for a period of 30 years. So this number on Page 110 represents a\npercent of the capacity of the land fill used, multiplied times an estimated number of\nthose costs.\n\nQ                 To a layman though, this money, this $239,000, is not actual, real\ndollars that the county paid out in that year, right?\n\nA                 That’s right. It’s an estimated number based on an engineer, what he’s\ntold us.\n\nQ               Was there also a charge in here for building a transfer plant? It may\nnot be in this year. I’m just asking.\n\nA               No. Because of the nature of the enterprise fund, it’s operated on an\naccrual basis, so that would have been booked as an asset. And any number that we\nwould have used to record the cost of a building would be recorded as an asset and\nnot in the expenditures.\n\n           ....\n\nQ             Let’s see if I can go over to the – – to any findings, and I think they\nwould be on 128. Is that the – – basically the only finding that you made here in this\nyear?\n\nA                   Yes.\n\nQ              Now, let’s talk about this finding if I could. Did you find that the\nproblems that you had noted in the year before, in terms of – – had been corrected?\n\nA               Yes, they were able to provide us with a detailed listing of accounts\nreceivable in this audit year.\n\nQ                  Now, explain to me your finding on Section B there on 128?\n\nA                  Let me read it just briefly.\n\nQ                  Sure. Take your time.\n\nA              Basically what I’m saying is there was a note. And that note, which\nwas payable to a bank, had not been recorded on the balance sheet of this fund. And\nsince it’s an enterprise fund operating under a full accrual basis of accounting, it\n\n\n                                             -10-\n\fshould have been. They also charged interest to this fund, but they did not charge the\ncorrect amount of interest to this fund. And the difference was $18,939. And so we\nshowed that amount as being due to, I believe, the debt service fund.\n\nQ              Now, this was a note to build the land fill is that – – not the land fill,\nbut the transfer?\n\nA               No. This $900,000 note, if I recall correctly, was a note to actually\nclose the land fill, put the cover on it basically, and then to set up a reserve for any\npost closure care costs that might have been incurred after the land fill was closed.\nI believe we set up something like $262,000 worth of reserve at this point.\n\nQ                 Was this money supposed to be taken out of solid waste disposal\nfund?\n\nA             That’s – – it really didn’t have to be at first. The money was paid out\nof the debt service fund. But then by resolution of the county commission, they\ndecided to put this $900,000 debt into the fund and allow the fund to pay the\nprinciple and interest on that debt.\n\nQ               Originally it was not supposed to be done that way?\n\nA               Actually, you can’t say it wasn’t supposed to be done that way. It\nwould be correct to do it either way. It would have been correct, in terms of\naccounting, to have placed it in the debt service fund or to have placed it in the\nenterprise fund. In my judgment is that the most appropriate accounting for this\n900,000 is in the land fill fund, because it should operate as an enterprise. It should\npay its own debt.\n\nQ              Now, what about the transfer station, was that also to be paid out of\nsolid waste disposal?\n\nA               That money was the $700,000 note, and they chose not to pay that out\nof the – – out of the land fill fund. That’s being paid through the general debt service\nfund of the county.\n\nQ              So if money had been taken out the (sic) of the solid waste disposal\naccount to pay for that, that would have been improper?\n\nA               No, sir, it wouldn’t.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\f        Q                   Well, it would have gone against what the county commission\n        originally determined was going to be the method of payment for that land – – for\n        that transfer station, would it not?\n\n                        MR. SCHWALB: Object to the form of the question.\n\n                         THE WITNESS: As I say, they could have done it either way they\n        wanted to. At first, I think it was – – now, this is only my opinion, if you understand.\n        I think they didn’t do a lot of thinking about it. They borrowed the money. They\n        built the transfer station. They closed the land fill. And sort of as an afterthought\n        they said, well, why shouldn’t the land fill pay for at least one of these notes; I mean\n        if one of these notes has gone to either build the transfer station or operate the land\n        fill. But they chose to put in the enterprise fund the one that did – – that dealt with\n        the closure of the land fill specifically. And I think if you’re going to choose one of\n        the two, that would be the most appropriate one, because it strictly dealt with the land\n        fill.\n\n        It is clear that under the accrual method of accounting, the payback of the entire $1,600,000\ndebt, evidenced by the two notes, was correctly chargeable to the enterprise fund, regardless of\nwhether the payback actually occurred from the enterprise fund or from other general funds of the\nCounty. Nothing in Tennessee Code Annotated section 68-211-835(g)(1) or in any other statute\nprovides that the enterprise fund be the sole source to be used by the County in repaying these capital\noutlay notes. The statute only provides that funds generated in the form of solid waste fees may only\nbe used to defray the costs of solid waste disposal services.\n\n        Every dime of the $1,600,000 evidenced by the two capital outlay notes was transferred by\nthe County to the enterprise fund in 1996. If one could relieve the enterprise fund of the obligation\nof repaying these notes with interest, the fees collected would be excessive. However, the payback\nof the notes and interest is clearly contemplated by the accrual method of accounting to be charged\nagainst the enterprise fund, and the result is a continuing deficit in that fund. The fact that portions\nof the payback are made from the general funds of the County is not a material consideration since\nboth of the notes are general obligations of the County anyway. As held by the trial court, there is\nno proof that solid waste disposal fees have been used for any purpose other than solid waste\ndisposal and management. Here, the inquiry comes to an end.\n\n        The remaining issue posed by Plaintiffs involves their assertion of unequal treatment of\nthemselves in relation to the exemption process relative to solid waste disposal fees and the further\nassertion that the exemption process is arbitrary and capricious. In this respect, it is well to note that\nonly three of the plaintiffs testified in the case or presented any evidence to support any allegation\nof unequal treatment.\n\n        In its findings of fact, the trial court stated in pertinent part:\n\n\n\n                                                   -12-\n\f2. . . . Elderly and disabled residents who qualified for a reduction in property taxes\n   qualified for a like reduction for payment of the disposal fee.\n\n3. On May 19, 1997 the County passed Resolution No. 9724 to amend Resolution\n   No. 9570 and clarify the classification system and provide for additional\n   exemptions. Resolution No. 9724 established more specific definitions for the\n   previous three classifications and added a fourth classification, Non-Permanent.\n   It also provided a 50% exemption for low-income households, owners of hunting\n   cabins or second homes used for recreational purposes, and churches which have\n   no daily operations or programs. The basic fee and exemption structure set forth\n   in Resolution Nos. 9570 & 9724 remain in effect today. (Trial Exhibit 3)\n\n4. Both Resolutions required payment for residential dwelling units. If the property\n   did not contain a habitable dwelling, no payment was required. If the property\n   contained a habitable dwelling, but the dwelling would not be used during the\n   year, no payment was required. It was the property owner’s responsibility to\n   pursue the exemptions with the Solid Waste Department.\n\n5. Resolution No. 9570 authorizes the Solid Waste Committee to handle disputes\n   with regard to matters not specifically addressed in the Resolution, including\n   billing.\n\n6. The testimony is undisputed that the Solid Waste Committee has the power to\n   grant exemptions from payment of the disposal fee.\n\n7. The committee delegated this duty in part to the Director of Solid Waste and the\n   billing clerks in the solid waste office. When the exemption requested clearly fit\n   with an exemption from the Resolutions, this office could grant the exemption.\n   If the solid waste office refused to grant an exemption, the individual was entitled\n   to come before the Solid Waste Committee and request the exemption. The\n   committee would then vote on whether an exemption should be granted.\n\n8. Resolution No. 9570 provided little guidance to the committee as to when to\n   grant exemptions. The committee recommended changes to Resolution No. 9570\n   which were ultimately incorporated into Resolution No. 9724.\n\n9. Only Plaintiffs Maxie White (White), Charles Holt (Holt) and James Moss\n   (Moss) appeared at trial and testified in this matter regarding their experience\n   with the exemption process and/or the disposal fee assessed to them for their\n   residence and/or business. No other named Plaintiff testified or otherwise\n   produced any proof of the treatment they received with regard to their particular\n   circumstances.\n\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\f10. Holt, operator of a small business, filed for an exemption based upon the fact that\n    he was not producing enough garbage to justify the fee. His request for an\n    exemption was denied. White, an operator of an in-home woodwork business,\n    applied for an exemption for the same reason and it was granted. Moss, an owner\n    and landlord for some fifteen (15) rental dwellings, filed for an exemption\n    because he believed the fee was unfair. He complains that he should not have to\n    pay fees for every residential property he owns because he rents them out. His\n    request for an exemption was denied. Moss alleged that the Keg County Cowboy\n    Club was granted an exemption and he should be treated similarly. The Keg\n    County Cowboy Club is a recreational campground and not a residential property.\n\n11. For the initial billing in 1996 (the first time the fee was billed), White was\n    assessed the $90 fee for her residence and $180 for her business. White testified\n    that she paid the fee for her residence and went to the Committee and requested\n    an exemption from payment for her in-home business because she did not\n    generate any waste from her business. This exemption was granted. Thereafter\n    this lawsuit was filed and she has not requested any further exemptions for her\n    home or business and she has not paid any fee assessed to her for her home or\n    business. In particular, White has not paid the assessed fees or requested any\n    type of exemption since the enactment of Resolution 9724. Her basic contention\n    is that the fees charged to her are excessive in proportion to the waste she\n    generates.\n\n12. White could not specifically identify any person or individual similarly situated\n    to her who received treatment more favorable than she since the enactment of\n    Resolution 9724.\n\n13. For the initial billing in 1996, Holt was assessed a fee for his residence in the\n    amount of $90 and $180 for his business. Holt requested that he be exempted\n    because “I did not produce enough garbage for the fee.” The requested\n    exemption was denied. Holt admitted that his business generated waste, he\n    simply thinks that the fee of $180 was excessive in proportion to the waste he\n    personally generated. Holt testified that he believes that the residential fee is also\n    excessive based upon the amount of trash generated by him and he believes that\n    the County should, instead, implement a tipping fee so that citizens would only\n    pay for what they generate/use. Like White, Holt has not paid any fee assessed\n    to his residence or business since the filing of this lawsuit. Nor has he applied\n    for any exemption since 1996.\n\n14. Moss has never paid any fee assessed to him since its implementation and has\n    never applied to the Committee for an exemption.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\f       Assertions that the solid waste disposal fees are improper because they are not keyed to a\nproportional use of the solid waste facilities provide no basis for relief. It has been held that a county\ncan legally impose a monthly fee on all of its residents for solid waste disposal services regardless\nof whether or not the services are actually utilized. Horton v. Carroll County, 968 S.W.2d 841\n(Tenn.Ct.App. 1997).\n\n        As to the issue of the alleged arbitrary and capricious nature of the exemption process, the\ntrial court held:\n\n             The last issue for this Court to determine is whether the exemption process\n        utilized by the County is arbitrary and capricious. The County is authorized by\n        statute it (sic) impose the solid waste disposal fee on all residence (sic). The manner\n        by which this fee was being imposed bears a reasonable relation to a proper\n        legislative purpose. Newton v. Cox, 878 S.W.2d 105 (Tenn. 1994). Further, the\n        statutory procedure, as it was imposed, was neither arbitrary nor discriminatory and\n        comports with substantive due process. This Court finds that there is no evidence of\n        any discriminatory purpose for the classification system and that the exemptions have\n        not been granted in an arbitrary manner.\n\n            Plaintiffs presented two lists summarizing exemptions granted by the County.\n        (Trial Exhibits 15 & 16). Both lists appear to contain inconsistencies regarding the\n        granting of exemptions. Dwight Sullivan, former chairman of the Solid Waste\n        Committee, testified regarding the supposed inconsistencies. Mr. Sullivan explained\n        that even though two people on the list claimed the same exemption (disability, fixed\n        income, etc.), the exemption was only granted to those who actually established that\n        they met the criteria. One way to establish this was to demonstrate to the committee\n        that they qualified for the property tax reduction. These lists do not adequately\n        provide the Court with evidence to conclude that the conduct of the County was\n        arbitrary and capricious.\n\n            White and Holt provided the only conclusive evidence of inconsistent treatment.\n        White requested and was granted an exemption in 1996 for her in-home business.\n        She was assessed a fee for her home ($90) and her in-home business ($180). The\n        Solid Waste Committee found that her in-home business was not generating enough\n        waste to justify the $180 fee in addition to the $90 she was already paying for the\n        same building. She has not applied for another exemption since 1996. Holt\n        requested and was denied exemptions in 1996. He was also assessed a fee for his\n        home ($90) and his in-home business ($180). He has not applied for another\n        exemption since 1996. In response to similar situations, the County Commission\n        passed Resolution 9724 that amended the amount residents would have to pay for\n        their residences and in-home businesses to $135 total. Both have been assessed the\n        same fee since Resolution 9724 came into effect in 1997. This isolated incident is\n\n\n\n                                                  -15-\n\f        not enough to convince the Court that the entire system of exemptions has been\n        implemented in an arbitrary and capricious manner.\n\nPlaintiffs simply offered no proof to support their assertions that the actions of County officials, in\neither granting or withholding exemptions, has been arbitrary or capricious.\n\n        Plaintiffs predicate almost their entire case on an assertion that, on a revenue versus\nexpenditure cash analysis, solid waste fee collections have been excessive. They offer no proof that\nsuch a method of accounting is either mandated by law or proper when dealing with a statutorily\nmandated enterprise fund. The undisputed expert testimony is that an accrual method of accounting\nis mandated when dealing with an enterprise fund. It is further clear that the two capital outlay notes\ntotaling $1,600,000 are mandated by statute to be general obligations of the County and that\nrepayment of the same may be made from any funds available to the County. The only statutory\nmandate as to the use of the fees generated by the solid waste disposal program is that they must be\nused for solid waste disposal purposes. When the accrual method of accounting is used and both the\nproceeds of the capital outlay notes and the scheduled payback with interest of the notes is properly\nattributed to the enterprise fund, that fund is operating at a deficit. No proof is offered by Plaintiffs\nthat would support a finding that the exemptions authorized by the statute are either unauthorized\nor applied in an arbitrary and capricious manner.\n\n       The judgment of the trial court is in all respects affirmed, and costs of the appeal are assessed\nto Appellants.\n\n\n                                                         ___________________________________\n                                                         WILLIAM B.

This Act was codified as Tennessee Code Annotated Title 68, parts 8 and 9. Pursuant to\nTennessee Code Annotated section 68-9-211, the county legislative body of Hickman County, on\nApril 18, 1994, declared Hickman County to be a solid waste region and undertook by committee\nto establish a 10-year Municipal Solid Waste Management Plan. Following the development of such\nplan, the Hickman County legislative body, on September 19, 1994, adopted Resolution No. 9456\nimplementing the 10-year Municipal Solid Waste Management Plan. On October 16, 1995, the\n\fHickman County legislative body adopted Resolution No. 9570, which, pursuant to Tennessee Code\nAnnotated section 68-211-835, imposed a fee schedule for solid waste disposal services. This\nResolution provided in pertinent part:\n\n              SECTION 1: Pursuant to § 68-211-835, Tennessee Code Annotated, the\n       following fee schedule for Municipal Solid Waste Disposal in Hickman County is\n       hereby adopted:\n\n              RESIDENTIAL – $ 90.00 per dwelling unit per year\n              BUSINESS    – $180.00 per business unit per year\n              INDUSTRIAL – $ 10.00 per ton over disposal cost\n\n               SECTION 2: RESIDENTIAL and BUSINESS MSW FEES shall be billed\n       semi-annually to the owner of the residential or business unit. Residential and\n       Business billing, including home-based businesses, shall be determined by how the\n       property is listed in the Hickman County Assessor’s Office. Owners of multi-unit\n       residential property shall be billed for each unit. The Hickman County Finance office\n       shall be responsible for billing and collecting such fees.\n\n              ....\n\n              SECTION 7: Elderly and disabled property owners qualifying for property\n       tax reductions, according to records in the Hickman County Trustee’s Office, shall\n       also qualify for a like deduction in MSW Fees.\n\n              ....\n\n               SECTION 9: The fees generated by this resolution shall be deposited into the\n       Hickman County Solid Waste Management Fund and shall be used only for the\n       purpose for which they were collected. The amount of fees charged may be adjusted\n       as required, but shall at all times bear a reasonable relationship to the cost of\n       providing solid waste disposal. All residents of the county shall have equat (sic)\n       access to the services provided.\n\n      On May 19, 1997, the Hickman County legislative body further amended Resolution No.\n9570 by the adoption of Resolution No. 9724 providing in pertinent part:\n\n             SECTION 1: The following terms which are used throughout the Hickman\n       County Solid Waste program are hereby defined as follows:\n\n              RESIDENTIAL            --      Any dwelling unit constructed for human\n                                             habitation, either in use or intended for use\n                                             during the current billing cycle.\n\n\n                                               -2-\n\f       NON-PERMANENT --                Any dwelling unit used only for recreation\n                                       purposes or as a part-time residence (hunting\n                                       cabins, etc.)\n\n       COMMERCIAL              –       Any for-profit, non-profit or not-for-profit\n                                       business and/or organization that buys and/or\n                                       sells as retail or wholesale, or is service\n                                       related, including assembly and or\n                                       construction. Commercial customers shall be\n                                       classified into one of five waste generators.\n\n       INDUSTRIAL              --      Any business whose main purpose is\n                                       manufacturing or the production of a specific\n                                       product or products, and any entity whose\n                                       waste volume fluctuates and is deemed to be\n                                       out of compliance with current Commercial\n                                       Classifications. Waste shall be delivered\n                                       directly to the Hickman County Solid Waste\n                                       Transfer Station where it will be weighed and\n                                       billed through a pre-approved charge account.\n\n        SECTION 2: Sections 1, 2, and 3 of Resolution No. 9570, with respect to\nBusiness or Commercial accounts and the fee charged to them is hereby changed to\nthe following five classifications and fees:\n\n        Class A – In-Home Business (residential fee exempt)        $125.00 annually\n        Class B – Extra Small (up to 2 cu.yds per week             $ 90.00 annually\n        Class C – Small (above 2 and up to 5 cu.yds. per           $150.00 annually\n        week)\n        Class D – Medium (above 5 and up to 10 cu.yds.per          $300.00 annually\n        week\n        Class E – Large (above 10 cu.yds. per week)                $600.00 annually\n\nThe above fees will be billed annually on the first day of July of each year and shall\nbe due and payable by September 30 of each year. This change shall become\neffective upon July 1, 1997, and customers shall be credited for any payment made\nprior to this change with respect to the current billing cycle.\n\n        SECTION 3: Section 7 of Resolution No. 9570 is hereby further amended\nto include a fifty percent (50%) exemption for low income households based upon\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f       the most current poverty guideline index as prepared by the Federal government.\n       Persons desiring to take advantage of this exemption shall furnish a copy of the\n       household most recent IRS 1040 statement. Additionally, there is hereby authorized\n       a fifty percent (50%) exemption for hunting cabins and second homes (cabins and\n       homes which are used only for part-time recreational purposes). The aforementioned\n       exemptions shall be in effect retroactively to residential billing for the first half of the\n       calendar year 1997. Also, retroactively effective to July 1, 1996, all churches are\n       hereby exempt from solid waste fees unless they have a daily operation or program\n       (day school, etc.). In such cases, they shall be billed according to the current\n       Commercial billing system.\n\n         Contemporaneously with Resolution No. 9570, the county legislative body, in October of\n1995, approved Resolution Nos. 9571 and 9572 authorizing capital outlay notes in the respective\namounts of $900,000 and $700,000. The $900,000 note was issued for the purpose of financing the\ncost of final closure of the existing landfill and to establish a reserve for post-closure care of that\nfacility. The $700,000 note was issued for the purpose of constructing a transfer station and two (2)\nconvenience centers, together with building roads, grading and purchasing equipment for the solid\nwaste disposal department. Both of these notes contained language mandated by Tennessee Code\nAnnotated section 9-21-603, same being:\n\n       That, the Notes shall be direct general obligations of Hickman County and Hickman\n       County hereby pledges its taxing power as to all taxable property in Hickman County\n       for the purpose of providing funds for the payment of principal and interest on the\n       Notes. The Legislative Body of Hickman County hereby authorizes the levy and\n       collection of a special tax on all taxable property of Hickman County to create a\n       sinking fund to retire the Notes with interest as they mature in an amount necessary\n       for that purpose.\n\n       There were seven original plaintiffs, five of whom were owners of business property in\nHickman County and two of whom were owners of residential property in Hickman County. The\nlawsuit, in a nutshell, is stated in the Complaint:\n\n              3.1. That the fee set forth in the Resolution collects more funds than are\n       required to meet services.\n\n               3.2.    That the fee is not being levied in a uniform, non-discriminatory\n       manner. Some owners of property described in the Resolution are not charged.\n       Some residents are being charged, but receive no services. Others are not charged\n       equally such as elderly and disabled persons, business on property where the\n       taxpayers homes are also located are charged unequally in relation to taxpayers who\n       run a small business out of their homes. Some industrial users pay less of a fee than\n       business and residential property owners.\n\n\n\n                                                   -4-\n\f             3.3. The fee is not equally levied in that some property owners are granted\n       exemptions by an arbitrary method known only to County officials.\n\n              3.4. The disposal fee heretofore set forth and described in paragraph 2.6\n       (Exhibit A) violates the Tennessee Solid Waste Management Act, Tenn. Code Ann.\n       68-211-101, et seq., in that it collects funds not solely used for solid waste\n       management purposes and is not uniformly assessed against all Hickman County\n       residents.\n\n              WHEREFORE, the plaintiffs, demand the following relief.\n\n              1. That this Court grant them a hearing at which time the issues raised in\n       this complaint may be fully adjudicated.\n\n              2. That this court Declare the Resolution (Exhibit A) to be in violation of\n       Tennessee Code Ann. §§ 68-24-101, et seq., or in the alternate, that the County has\n       exceeded its legal authority by its continued implementation of the Resolution.\n\n              3. That the Court order that the County reimburse all county citizens who\n       have paid fees set forth by the Resolution they have paid to the County.\n\n              4.    That the Court grant such other and further relief as it deems proper.\n\n       After a considerable amount of discovery, the case was heard on November 20, 2002, before\nthe Honorable R.E. Lee Davies, circuit judge, on Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment. This\nhearing resulted in an Order of December 17, 2002, providing in pertinent part:\n\n              This case presents three issues for determination by the Court.\n\n              1. Whether the fees charged by Defendants for the providing of solid waste\n       disposal services bears a reasonable relationship to the costs of providing said\n       services;\n              2. Whether the fees collected by Defendant’s solid waste disposal fund are\n       properly segregated and only used for solid waste purposes; and\n              3. Whether the exemption process utilized by the County for the payment of\n       solid waste disposal services is uniformly applied under the equal protection clause.\n\n               With regard to the first issue, the Court finds that summary judgment is\n       proper. T.C.A. § 68-211-835(g)(1) requires that the fees charged bear a reasonable\n       relationship to the cost of providing solid waste services. This does not require that\n       the amount charged be identified with mathematical certainty. The undisputed\n       testimony of the State Auditor who is responsible for auditing the Fund reveals that\n       the Fund is losing money. Thus, no unreasonable relationship between fees and\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f       services exists as the Fund is not making a profit. The Auditor further testified that\n       this Fund is required to be maintained as a Enterprise Fund and the accrual method\n       of accounting is the proper method for evaluating the profitability of the this (sic)\n       fund. Plaintiffs have offered no expert proof to contradict these facts, therefore,\n       summary judgment on this issue is GRANTED.\n\n               The statute requires fees to be segregated from the general fund and used only\n       for the purpose collected. The funds generated are to be used to establish and\n       maintain solid waste collection and disposal services. With regard to this second\n       issue, as a matter of law, this Court finds that the capital outlay notes in the amount\n       of $700,000.00 and $900,000.00 are start up costs for the Fund and are properly\n       payable from this Fund. However, disputed issues of fact remain regarding whether\n       funds transferred from this Solid Waste Fund to the County’s General Fund are\n       properly being used to retire these notes. Moreover, there remains questions with\n       regard to the authority of the County to make repayment of the notes from the Solid\n       Waste Disposal Fund based upon the language of Resolution Nos. 9571 and 9572\n       authorizing the County to incur the notes. Summary judgment is therefore DENIED\n       with regard to these issues at this time.\n\n               Finally, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have no standing to complain about\n       how property owners other than themselves may have been mistreated in relationship\n       to the exemption process established by the County for payment of solid waste\n       disposal fees. However, the Plaintiffs may be able to show that others are being\n       treated more favorably than Plaintiffs and, if so, they will have met their prima facie\n       burden of proof. The Court finds that, with the passage of Resolution No. 9724\n       amending the original Resolution No. 9570, the current Resolution, as written,\n       containing exemptions is not arbitrary and has a rational basis in fact and has\n       corrected any prior inequities. Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment with\n       regard to this third issued is, therefore, DENIED at this time, but Plaintiffs’ proof is\n       limited to post-amendment examples of unequal treatment, if any.\n\n         The first question to be resolved is whether or not the grant of summary judgment by Judge\nDavies is correct in holding that the fees charged by Defendant for the providing of solid waste\ndisposal services bears a reasonable relationship to the cost of providing said services. The answer\nto this question depends on whether or not we are concerned with a cash basis accounting method\nas opposed to an accrual accounting method. The Supreme Court has held:\n\n       The Solid Waste Management Act expressly regulates the imposition, collection, and\n       use of fees and surcharges by the state and local governments; it limits the use of\n       proceeds collected by local governments; and it requires that the comprehensive plan\n       for the management of solid waste include a uniform accounting system developed\n       by the State comptroller.\n\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\fCity of Tullahoma v.

Accounting for financial activities — Funds — Uniform solid\n       waste financial accounting system — Development — Approval — Requirement\n       for state funds. — (a) Each county, solid waste authority and municipality shall\n       account for financial activities related to the management of solid waste in either a\n       special revenue fund or an enterprise fund established expressly for that purpose.\n       Any county, solid waste authority or municipality that operates a landfill and/or\n       incinerator shall account for financial activities related specifically to that landfill\n       and/or incinerator in an enterprise fund. Each county, solid waste authority and\n       municipality shall use a uniform solid waste financial accounting system and chart\n       of accounts developed by the comptroller of the treasury.\n           (b) The comptroller of the treasury is directed to develop a uniform financial\n       accounting system conforming to generally accepted accounting principles for use as\n       required by this section.\n            (c) Such uniform accounting system shall be subject to the approval of the\n       commissioner of finance and administration. Upon such approval, each county shall\n       establish and maintain the uniform solid waste financial accounting system.\n         (d) No state funds for solid waste management shall be released to a county, solid\n       waste authority or municipality unless financial activities related to the management\n       of solid waste are accounted for in either a special revenue fund or an enterprise fund\n       established solely for that purpose. No state funds for solid waste management shall\n       be released to a county, solid waste authority or municipality that operates a landfill\n       and/or incinerator unless financial activities related to that landfill and/or incinerator\n       are accounted for in an enterprise fund.\n\n         The documentary evidence before the Court, using a cash flow analysis, creates at least a\nmaterial question of fact as to whether or not the fees generated are excessive. The undisputed\nexpert proof, however, establishes that the solid waste management fund in Hickman County is an\n“enterprise fund” as defined in section 68-211-874 of the Code and as developed by the comptroller\nof the treasury pursuant to that same statute.\n\n        The expert testimony offered by Jerry Durham, state auditor employed by the comptroller of\nthe treasury, established that the County was required by state law to begin operating the solid waste\ndisposal system under “an enterprise fund,” which requires an accrual basis of accounting rather than\na cash basis. At the start of the operation, the County contributed to the enterprise fund all\nequipment, land and buildings, together with related property, which contributions form\nintergovernmental contributed capital. Long-term obligations must be provided for under the accrual\nmethod and taken into consideration in determining the financial performance of the enterprise fund.\nMr. Durham testified:\n\n\n\n                                                  -7-\n\f       Q             Overall, did you find that the fund was, from inception, was making\n       money or losing money?\n\n       A               It was typically losing money.\n\n       Q                 And that’s what accounts for even as of the last completed audit\n       period, a nearly three-quarter of a million dollar retained earnings?\n\n       A              That and, of course, the fact that everything is recorded on the accrual\n       basis of accounting, which requires your post closure care cost to be recorded now\n       even though you’re going to be paying for them over 30 years. And that requires the\n       booking of that $900,000 note, even though you’re going to be paying for that over\n       whatever the life of the loan would be. So, when you look at your assets compared\n       to your liabilities, and because you’ve booked these two large liabilities, it makes\n       your deficit look worse than you might consider it to be. But it is a true deficit based\n       upon generally accepted accounting principles.\n\n        The familiar standard of appellate review relative to a grant of summary judgment requires\nthat the record before this Court affirmatively disclose that there is no genuine issue of material fact\nwarranting trial. The moving party has the burden of showing the court that there are no disputed\nmaterial facts and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Byrd v. Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2388306\"><a href=\"/opinion/2388306/byrd-v-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tenn.1993). This expert testimony being undisputed, the results of a cash basis\naccounting would be immaterial, and summary judgment was properly granted.\n\n        Appellants next complain of the method used by the County for the payback of the two\ncapital outlay notes by which money was procured to close the existing Hickman County Landfill\nand to construct new landfill facilities.\n\n        At the outset, these two capital outlay notes were approved by the Hickman County\nlegislative body and forwarded to the comptroller of the treasury on October 18, 1995. The letter\nfrom Hickman County Executive Steve Gregory to the director of local finance of the office of the\ncomptroller provided:\n\n       Enclosed you will find two Capital Outlay Notes recently approved by the Hickman\n       County Legislative Body. Both have to do with solid waste, but were separated\n       because they will be utilized at different times and will be paid back by different\n       means.\n\n       The first, Resolution No. 9571, is for an amount not to exceed $900,000. This is for\n       closure of current cells at the Hickman County Landfill, and we do not plan to\n       execute this note until next spring. The note will be retired through the General Debt\n       Service.\n\n\n\n                                                  -8-\n\f       The second, Resolution No. 9572, is for and (sic) amount not to exceed $700,000 and\n       will be executed as soon as possible. The note is for construction of landfill facilities\n       and will be retired through user fees generated by the Hickman County Solid Waste\n       Department.\n\n       Regardless of the source of funds contemplated by the County legislative body to be used for\nthe payback of these two capital outlay notes, state law found in section 9-21-603 of the Code\nrequires that both notes be general obligations of Hickman County and that Hickman County\n“pledges its taxing power as to all taxable property in Hickman County for the purpose of providing\nfunds for the payment of principal and interest on the notes.”\n\n        The problem lies with the insistence of Plaintiffs that the method contemplated for repayment\nof the notes by the County legislative body had to, in fact, be put into place and followed in the\nfuture. The trial court held:\n\n       21. Initially, the $900,000 note was to be retired through the County’s General Debt\n           Service Fund, and the $700,000 note was to be retired from income generated\n           by the Solid Waste Disposal Fund.\n\n       22. After the recommendation of the state auditor, the County began paying the\n           $900,000 note from the Solid Waste Disposal Fund and the $700,000 note from\n           the General Debt Service Fund.\n\n        How the County chose to pay back the money has no bearing on the fact that both of the\nnotes, by their terms and by statutory mandate, constituted general obligations of the County. Since\nthe proceeds of both notes were contributed by the County to the enterprise fund, as clearly reflected\nin the Enterprise Fund Audit Report of June 30, 1996, the future payback of these notes plus interest\nhad to be attributed to the enterprise fund under the accrual method of accounting. This is the\nundisputed testimony of State Auditor Jerry Durham. He testified, while reviewing the June 30,\n1997, audit of the enterprise fund:\n\n       Q               Total expenses 910,515?\n\n       A               Right.\n\n       Q               Did this 910,515 include post closure care costs?\n\n       A               Yes, it did.\n\n       Q                Can you explain, and we’re going to see this several times in some\n       of these audits, so we might as well go ahead and explain this now. What is, to your\n       understanding, is post closure care cost here?\n\n\n\n                                                 -9-\n\fA               Post closure care costs are a percentage of a figure that is calculated\nby an engineer of how much it’s going to cost to close and then to maintain closure\nof a land fill for a period of 30 years. So this number on Page 110 represents a\npercent of the capacity of the land fill used, multiplied times an estimated number of\nthose costs.\n\nQ                 To a layman though, this money, this $239,000, is not actual, real\ndollars that the county paid out in that year, right?\n\nA                 That’s right. It’s an estimated number based on an engineer, what he’s\ntold us.\n\nQ               Was there also a charge in here for building a transfer plant? It may\nnot be in this year. I’m just asking.\n\nA               No. Because of the nature of the enterprise fund, it’s operated on an\naccrual basis, so that would have been booked as an asset. And any number that we\nwould have used to record the cost of a building would be recorded as an asset and\nnot in the expenditures.\n\n           ....\n\nQ             Let’s see if I can go over to the – – to any findings, and I think they\nwould be on 128. Is that the – – basically the only finding that you made here in this\nyear?\n\nA                   Yes.\n\nQ              Now, let’s talk about this finding if I could. Did you find that the\nproblems that you had noted in the year before, in terms of – – had been corrected?\n\nA               Yes, they were able to provide us with a detailed listing of accounts\nreceivable in this audit year.\n\nQ                  Now, explain to me your finding on Section B there on 128?\n\nA                  Let me read it just briefly.\n\nQ                  Sure. Take your time.\n\nA              Basically what I’m saying is there was a note. And that note, which\nwas payable to a bank, had not been recorded on the balance sheet of this fund. And\nsince it’s an enterprise fund operating under a full accrual basis of accounting, it\n\n\n                                             -10-\n\fshould have been. They also charged interest to this fund, but they did not charge the\ncorrect amount of interest to this fund. And the difference was $18,939. And so we\nshowed that amount as being due to, I believe, the debt service fund.\n\nQ              Now, this was a note to build the land fill is that – – not the land fill,\nbut the transfer?\n\nA               No. This $900,000 note, if I recall correctly, was a note to actually\nclose the land fill, put the cover on it basically, and then to set up a reserve for any\npost closure care costs that might have been incurred after the land fill was closed.\nI believe we set up something like $262,000 worth of reserve at this point.\n\nQ                 Was this money supposed to be taken out of solid waste disposal\nfund?\n\nA             That’s – – it really didn’t have to be at first. The money was paid out\nof the debt service fund. But then by resolution of the county commission, they\ndecided to put this $900,000 debt into the fund and allow the fund to pay the\nprinciple and interest on that debt.\n\nQ               Originally it was not supposed to be done that way?\n\nA               Actually, you can’t say it wasn’t supposed to be done that way. It\nwould be correct to do it either way. It would have been correct, in terms of\naccounting, to have placed it in the debt service fund or to have placed it in the\nenterprise fund. In my judgment is that the most appropriate accounting for this\n900,000 is in the land fill fund, because it should operate as an enterprise. It should\npay its own debt.\n\nQ              Now, what about the transfer station, was that also to be paid out of\nsolid waste disposal?\n\nA               That money was the $700,000 note, and they chose not to pay that out\nof the – – out of the land fill fund. That’s being paid through the general debt service\nfund of the county.\n\nQ              So if money had been taken out the (sic) of the solid waste disposal\naccount to pay for that, that would have been improper?\n\nA               No, sir, it wouldn’t.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\f        Q                   Well, it would have gone against what the county commission\n        originally determined was going to be the method of payment for that land – – for\n        that transfer station, would it not?\n\n                        MR. SCHWALB: Object to the form of the question.\n\n                         THE WITNESS: As I say, they could have done it either way they\n        wanted to. At first, I think it was – – now, this is only my opinion, if you understand.\n        I think they didn’t do a lot of thinking about it. They borrowed the money. They\n        built the transfer station. They closed the land fill. And sort of as an afterthought\n        they said, well, why shouldn’t the land fill pay for at least one of these notes; I mean\n        if one of these notes has gone to either build the transfer station or operate the land\n        fill. But they chose to put in the enterprise fund the one that did – – that dealt with\n        the closure of the land fill specifically. And I think if you’re going to choose one of\n        the two, that would be the most appropriate one, because it strictly dealt with the land\n        fill.\n\n        It is clear that under the accrual method of accounting, the payback of the entire $1,600,000\ndebt, evidenced by the two notes, was correctly chargeable to the enterprise fund, regardless of\nwhether the payback actually occurred from the enterprise fund or from other general funds of the\nCounty. Nothing in Tennessee Code Annotated section 68-211-835(g)(1) or in any other statute\nprovides that the enterprise fund be the sole source to be used by the County in repaying these capital\noutlay notes. The statute only provides that funds generated in the form of solid waste fees may only\nbe used to defray the costs of solid waste disposal services.\n\n        Every dime of the $1,600,000 evidenced by the two capital outlay notes was transferred by\nthe County to the enterprise fund in 1996. If one could relieve the enterprise fund of the obligation\nof repaying these notes with interest, the fees collected would be excessive. However, the payback\nof the notes and interest is clearly contemplated by the accrual method of accounting to be charged\nagainst the enterprise fund, and the result is a continuing deficit in that fund. The fact that portions\nof the payback are made from the general funds of the County is not a material consideration since\nboth of the notes are general obligations of the County anyway. As held by the trial court, there is\nno proof that solid waste disposal fees have been used for any purpose other than solid waste\ndisposal and management. Here, the inquiry comes to an end.\n\n        The remaining issue posed by Plaintiffs involves their assertion of unequal treatment of\nthemselves in relation to the exemption process relative to solid waste disposal fees and the further\nassertion that the exemption process is arbitrary and capricious. In this respect, it is well to note that\nonly three of the plaintiffs testified in the case or presented any evidence to support any allegation\nof unequal treatment.\n\n        In its findings of fact, the trial court stated in pertinent part:\n\n\n\n                                                   -12-\n\f2. . . . Elderly and disabled residents who qualified for a reduction in property taxes\n   qualified for a like reduction for payment of the disposal fee.\n\n3. On May 19, 1997 the County passed Resolution No. 9724 to amend Resolution\n   No. 9570 and clarify the classification system and provide for additional\n   exemptions. Resolution No. 9724 established more specific definitions for the\n   previous three classifications and added a fourth classification, Non-Permanent.\n   It also provided a 50% exemption for low-income households, owners of hunting\n   cabins or second homes used for recreational purposes, and churches which have\n   no daily operations or programs. The basic fee and exemption structure set forth\n   in Resolution Nos. 9570 & 9724 remain in effect today. (Trial Exhibit 3)\n\n4. Both Resolutions required payment for residential dwelling units. If the property\n   did not contain a habitable dwelling, no payment was required. If the property\n   contained a habitable dwelling, but the dwelling would not be used during the\n   year, no payment was required. It was the property owner’s responsibility to\n   pursue the exemptions with the Solid Waste Department.\n\n5. Resolution No. 9570 authorizes the Solid Waste Committee to handle disputes\n   with regard to matters not specifically addressed in the Resolution, including\n   billing.\n\n6. The testimony is undisputed that the Solid Waste Committee has the power to\n   grant exemptions from payment of the disposal fee.\n\n7. The committee delegated this duty in part to the Director of Solid Waste and the\n   billing clerks in the solid waste office. When the exemption requested clearly fit\n   with an exemption from the Resolutions, this office could grant the exemption.\n   If the solid waste office refused to grant an exemption, the individual was entitled\n   to come before the Solid Waste Committee and request the exemption. The\n   committee would then vote on whether an exemption should be granted.\n\n8. Resolution No. 9570 provided little guidance to the committee as to when to\n   grant exemptions. The committee recommended changes to Resolution No. 9570\n   which were ultimately incorporated into Resolution No. 9724.\n\n9. Only Plaintiffs Maxie White (White), Charles Holt (Holt) and James Moss\n   (Moss) appeared at trial and testified in this matter regarding their experience\n   with the exemption process and/or the disposal fee assessed to them for their\n   residence and/or business. No other named Plaintiff testified or otherwise\n   produced any proof of the treatment they received with regard to their particular\n   circumstances.\n\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\f10. Holt, operator of a small business, filed for an exemption based upon the fact that\n    he was not producing enough garbage to justify the fee. His request for an\n    exemption was denied. White, an operator of an in-home woodwork business,\n    applied for an exemption for the same reason and it was granted. Moss, an owner\n    and landlord for some fifteen (15) rental dwellings, filed for an exemption\n    because he believed the fee was unfair. He complains that he should not have to\n    pay fees for every residential property he owns because he rents them out. His\n    request for an exemption was denied. Moss alleged that the Keg County Cowboy\n    Club was granted an exemption and he should be treated similarly. The Keg\n    County Cowboy Club is a recreational campground and not a residential property.\n\n11. For the initial billing in 1996 (the first time the fee was billed), White was\n    assessed the $90 fee for her residence and $180 for her business. White testified\n    that she paid the fee for her residence and went to the Committee and requested\n    an exemption from payment for her in-home business because she did not\n    generate any waste from her business. This exemption was granted. Thereafter\n    this lawsuit was filed and she has not requested any further exemptions for her\n    home or business and she has not paid any fee assessed to her for her home or\n    business. In particular, White has not paid the assessed fees or requested any\n    type of exemption since the enactment of Resolution 9724. Her basic contention\n    is that the fees charged to her are excessive in proportion to the waste she\n    generates.\n\n12. White could not specifically identify any person or individual similarly situated\n    to her who received treatment more favorable than she since the enactment of\n    Resolution 9724.\n\n13. For the initial billing in 1996, Holt was assessed a fee for his residence in the\n    amount of $90 and $180 for his business. Holt requested that he be exempted\n    because “I did not produce enough garbage for the fee.” The requested\n    exemption was denied. Holt admitted that his business generated waste, he\n    simply thinks that the fee of $180 was excessive in proportion to the waste he\n    personally generated. Holt testified that he believes that the residential fee is also\n    excessive based upon the amount of trash generated by him and he believes that\n    the County should, instead, implement a tipping fee so that citizens would only\n    pay for what they generate/use. Like White, Holt has not paid any fee assessed\n    to his residence or business since the filing of this lawsuit. Nor has he applied\n    for any exemption since 1996.\n\n14. Moss has never paid any fee assessed to him since its implementation and has\n    never applied to the Committee for an exemption.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\f       Assertions that the solid waste disposal fees are improper because they are not keyed to a\nproportional use of the solid waste facilities provide no basis for relief. It has been held that a county\ncan legally impose a monthly fee on all of its residents for solid waste disposal services regardless\nof whether or not the services are actually utilized. Horton v. Carroll County, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">841</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Tenn.Ct.App. 1997).\n\n        As to the issue of the alleged arbitrary and capricious nature of the exemption process, the\ntrial court held:\n\n             The last issue for this Court to determine is whether the exemption process\n        utilized by the County is arbitrary and capricious. The County is authorized by\n        statute it (sic) impose the solid waste disposal fee on all residence (sic). The manner\n        by which this fee was being imposed bears a reasonable relation to a proper\n        legislative purpose. Newton v. Cox, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2410380\"><a href=\"/opinion/2410380/newton-v-cox/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tenn. 1994). Further, the\n        statutory procedure, as it was imposed, was neither arbitrary nor discriminatory and\n        comports with substantive due process. This Court finds that there is no evidence of\n        any discriminatory purpose for the classification system and that the exemptions have\n        not been granted in an arbitrary manner.\n\n            Plaintiffs presented two lists summarizing exemptions granted by the County.\n        (Trial Exhibits 15 & 16). Both lists appear to contain inconsistencies regarding the\n        granting of exemptions. Dwight Sullivan, former chairman of the Solid Waste\n        Committee, testified regarding the supposed inconsistencies. Mr. Sullivan explained\n        that even though two people on the list claimed the same exemption (disability, fixed\n        income, etc.), the exemption was only granted to those who actually established that\n        they met the criteria. One way to establish this was to demonstrate to the committee\n        that they qualified for the property tax reduction. These lists do not adequately\n        provide the Court with evidence to conclude that the conduct of the County was\n        arbitrary and capricious.\n\n            White and Holt provided the only conclusive evidence of inconsistent treatment.\n        White requested and was granted an exemption in 1996 for her in-home business.\n        She was assessed a fee for her home ($90) and her in-home business ($180). The\n        Solid Waste Committee found that her in-home business was not generating enough\n        waste to justify the $180 fee in addition to the $90 she was already paying for the\n        same building. She has not applied for another exemption since 1996. Holt\n        requested and was denied exemptions in 1996. He was also assessed a fee for his\n        home ($90) and his in-home business ($180). He has not applied for another\n        exemption since 1996. In response to similar situations, the County Commission\n        passed Resolution 9724 that amended the amount residents would have to pay for\n        their residences and in-home businesses to $135 total. Both have been assessed the\n        same fee since Resolution 9724 came into effect in 1997. This isolated incident is\n\n\n\n                                                  -15-\n\f        not enough to convince the Court that the entire system of exemptions has been\n        implemented in an arbitrary and capricious manner.\n\nPlaintiffs simply offered no proof to support their assertions that the actions of County officials, in\neither granting or withholding exemptions, has been arbitrary or capricious.\n\n        Plaintiffs predicate almost their entire case on an assertion that, on a revenue versus\nexpenditure cash analysis, solid waste fee collections have been excessive. They offer no proof that\nsuch a method of accounting is either mandated by law or proper when dealing with a statutorily\nmandated enterprise fund. The undisputed expert testimony is that an accrual method of accounting\nis mandated when dealing with an enterprise fund. It is further clear that the two capital outlay notes\ntotaling $1,600,000 are mandated by statute to be general obligations of the County and that\nrepayment of the same may be made from any funds available to the County. The only statutory\nmandate as to the use of the fees generated by the solid waste disposal program is that they must be\nused for solid waste disposal purposes. When the accrual method of accounting is used and both the\nproceeds of the capital outlay notes and the scheduled payback with interest of the notes is properly\nattributed to the enterprise fund, that fund is operating at a deficit. No proof is offered by Plaintiffs\nthat would support a finding that the exemptions authorized by the statute are either unauthorized\nor applied in an arbitrary and capricious manner.\n\n       The judgment of the trial court is in all respects affirmed, and costs of the appeal are assessed\nto Appellants.\n\n\n                                                         ___________________________________\n                                                         WILLIAM B.
