She brought an action\n\nagainst the school district and the board of education, alleging violations of the\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213. She also\n\nbrought an action against the district, the board, and several individual district\n\nemployees, alleging violations of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 based on Defendants’ failure\n\nto provide rights guaranteed by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\n\n(IDEA), 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1487. Defendants moved to dismiss on various\n\ngrounds, including qualified immunity, but the district court denied their motion\n\nexcept as to one of the individual defendants. This court has jurisdiction over the\n\nremaining individual defendants’ qualified immunity appeal pursuant to Mitchell\n\nv. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511 (1985), and over the appeal of the district court’s other\n\ndeterminations pursuant to its certification for immediate appeal under 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1292(b). 1\n\n                                            I.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          Plaintiff’s motions to dismiss this appeal and for attorney fees are denied.\n\n                                           -4-\n\f      In 1975, Congress enacted the Education of the Handicapped Act (EHA),\n\nthe IDEA’s predecessor. 2 Its primary purpose is “to assure that all children with\n\ndisabilities have available to them . . . a free appropriate public education which\n\nemphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique\n\nneeds [and] to assure that the rights of children with disabilities and their parents\n\nor guardians are protected.” 20 U.S.C. § 1400(d)(1)(A)-(B). 3 To implement these\n\ngoals, Congress mandated that state and local educational agencies receiving\n\nassistance under the IDEA establish procedures to ensure the provision of such\n\nservices and the protection of these rights. See id. § 1415(a). To identify\n\nnecessary services, the IDEA requires representatives of the responsible\n\neducational agencies, in meetings with parents and teachers, to develop an\n\nindividualized education program (IEP) for each child with a disability. The IEP\n\nincludes a written statement of the present educational level of such child, of\n\nannual goals and short-term instructional objectives, and of “specific educational\n\n      2\n       Congress changed the EHA’s name to the IDEA in 1990. See Pub. L. No.\n101-476, 104 Stat. 1141 (1990). We use EHA and IDEA interchangeably\nthroughout the opinion.\n      3\n         Congress amended the IDEA and recodified several provisions in 1997.\nSee Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997, Pub. L. No.\n105-17, 111 Stat. 37 (1997). The material events giving rise to the case at hand\noccurred prior to these amendments. Moreover, the 1997 amendments are not\nretroactive. See Fowler v. Unified Sch. Dist. No. 259 , 128 F.3d 1431, 1434-35\n(10th Cir. 1997). We therefore apply and cite to the IDEA provisions as codified\nprior to enactment of the 1997 amendments. In any event,   no party has suggested\nthat any revision would change the analysis or outcome of this case.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fservices to be provided to such child.” § 1401(a)(20). Before developing or\n\nchanging a child’s IEP, the agency must provide written notice to the parents.\n\nSee id. § 1415(b)(1)(C). The agency must also provide parents who present\n\ncomplaints regarding these matters an impartial due process hearing. See id.\n\n§ 1415(b)(1)-(2). Any party aggrieved by the decision of a local educational\n\nagency may appeal to the state educational agency. See id. § 1415(c). Further, an\n\naggrieved party has the right to bring a civil action with respect to its complaints\n\nif the state has not provided an administrative appeals process or if the aggrieved\n\nparty is dissatisfied with the findings or decision of the administrative appeal\n\nagency. See id. § 1415(e).\n\n                                          II.\n\n      “Because this appeal arises on a motion to dismiss, we construe the facts,\n\nand reasonable inferences that might be drawn from them, in favor of the\n\nplaintiff.” Breidenbach v. Bolish, 126 F.3d 1288, 1292 (10th Cir. 1997).\n\nAccording to Plaintiff, during the five-year period between 1992 and 1997,\n\nDefendants failed to provide her with the behavioral programming, augmentative\n\ncommunication, and tube feeding services identified in her IEP.\n\n      She also asserts Defendants repeatedly “placed her in a windowless closet,\n\nrestrained in a stroller without supervision,” contrary to her IEP. During one of\n\nthese incidents she tipped over and hit her head on the floor, suffering serious\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fphysical injuries, including a skull fracture and exacerbation of a seizure disorder,\n\nwhich kept her from attending school for the remainder of the term. The school\n\ndistrict thereafter failed to provide homebound schooling adequate to insure the\n\nfree appropriate public education to which she was entitled.\n\n      In August 1997, Plaintiff moved to a new school district and began\n\nattending a different school, neither of which is a party to this action. In February\n\n1998, she requested an administrative hearing from the defendant school district\n\nto “contest certain actions of . . . [district] personnel.” In her request, Plaintiff\n\nsought “any relief” available through the administrative process, “including\n\nmoney damages and attorney fees.” Plaintiff’s hearing request was denied by the\n\nhearing officer, who ruled that he lacked jurisdiction “as the petitioner does not\n\nreside within the school district,” and that he lacked authority to grant the\n\nrequested relief.\n\n      Thereafter, Plaintiff filed the instant suit, raising two claims. First, she\n\nalleged that the school district and the board of education violated her rights\n\nunder the ADA by excluding her from participation in publicly funded general\n\nand special education programs based on her disability. Second, she brought an\n\naction under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that the school district, the board of\n\neducation, and several individual district employees violated her rights under the\n\n\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fIDEA by denying her a free and appropriate public education. Plaintiff\n\nspecifically seeks monetary damages for both the ADA and § 1983 claims.\n\n       Defendants moved to dismiss, arguing that (1) Plaintiff failed to exhaust\n\nher administrative remedies; (2) damages are unavailable under the IDEA and\n\ntherefore unavailable in a § 1983 claim based on an IDEA violation; (3) the IDEA\n\ndoes not allow individual liability actions, and, therefore, individuals cannot be\n\nliable under a § 1983 claim based on an IDEA violation; and (4) the individual\n\ndefendants were entitled to qualified immunity. The district court dismissed\n\nPlaintiff’s § 1983 claim as it applied to one of the individual defendants but\n\ndenied the motion in all other respects, and the remaining defendants brought this\n\nappeal.\n\n                                             III.\n\n       “We review the denial or grant of a motion to dismiss de novo, applying the\n\nsame standard used by the district court.”      Breidenbach , 126 F.3d at 1291. We\n\nfirst address the viability of Plaintiff’s IDEA-based § 1983 claims. The district\n\ncourt determined that the IDEA allows for damage awards and that it may be\n\nenforced against individuals. Therefore, the court reasoned, Plaintiff can likewise\n\nsue individuals and seek damages in a § 1983 suit based on the IDEA. The\n\ndistrict court’s analysis presupposes that § 1983 may be used to enforce the IDEA\n\n\n\n\n                                             -8-\n\fin the first place. This court has not previously ruled on this issue.   4\n                                                                                 Circuits that\n\nhave addressed the question have not come to the same conclusion.            5\n\n\n\n\n       4\n         In L.C. v. Utah State Board of Education , 57 F. Supp. 2d 1214, 1220 (D.\nUtah 1999), the district court stated that two Tenth Circuit cases have held that\n§ 1983 claims may be predicated on the IDEA. We respectfully disagree with the\ndistrict court’s interpretations.  Hayes v. Unified School District No. 377    , 877\nF.2d 809, 811 (10th Cir. 1989), involved a plaintiff asserting a § 1983 claim\nbased on alleged constitutional violations, not IDEA violations. I     n the other case\ncited by the district court, Association For Community Living v. Romer       , 992 F.2d\n1040, 1042 (10th Cir. 1993), it appears the plaintiffs’ § 1983 claim asserted\nviolations of the IDEA and the Equal Protection Clause. However, in dismissing\nthe plaintiffs’ claims for failure to exhaust their administrative remedies, the\npanel did not discuss the viability of the IDEA-based § 1983 claim. Thus, we do\nnot read Romer as holding, or otherwise compelling the conclusion, that IDEA\nviolations may form the substantive basis for § 1983 claims.\n       5\n        A majority of the circuits have case law holding or at least implying that\n§ 1983 suits may be based on IDEA violations.        See Mrs. W. v. Tirozzi , 832 F.2d\n748, 753-55 (2d Cir. 1987) (express holding);      W.B. v. Matula , 67 F.3d 484, 493-\n94 (3d Cir. 1995) (express holding);    Angela L. v. Pasadena Indep. Sch. Dist.     , 918\nF.2d 1188, 1193 n.3 (5th Cir. 1990) (dicta);     Crocker v. Tennessee Secondary Sch.\nAthletic Ass’n , 980 F.2d 382, 387 (6th Cir. 1992) (implying that the IDEA may be\nthe basis for a § 1983 suit, but holding that damages were not available);\nHeidemann v. Rother , 84 F.3d 1021, 1032-33 (8th Cir. 1996) (same);          Digre v.\nRoseville Sch. Indep. Dist. No. 623 , 841 F.2d 245, 249-50 (8th Cir. 1988)\n(express holding); N.B. by D.G. v. Alachua County Sch. Bd.         , 84 F.3d 1376, 1379\n(11th Cir. 1996), cert. denied , 519 U.S. 1092 (1997) (holding that plaintiff must\nexhaust administrative remedies before proceeding with an IDEA-based § 1983\nclaim (though not specifically addressing the claim’s viability));      Walker v.\nDistrict of Columbia , 969 F. Supp. 794, 796-97 (D.D.C. 1997) (express holding).\n\n       The Fourth Circuit has held that § 1983 cannot be used to remedy a\nviolation of the IDEA. See Sellers v. Sch. Bd. , 141 F.3d 524, 529-32 (4th Cir.\n1998), cert. denied , 525 U.S. 871 (1998).\n\n       The First, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits have cases appearing to go both\nways. Compare Doe v. Town of Framingham , 965 F. Supp. 226, 230 (D. Mass.\n1997) (assuming § 1983’s applicability to the IDEA),  with Andrew S. v. Sch.\n\n                                              -9-\n\f       It is well settled that § 1983 is “a generally and presumptively available\n\nremedy for claimed violations of federal law.”   Livadas v. Bradshaw , 512 U.S.\n\n107, 133 (1994). Nonetheless, Congress can foreclose recourse to § 1983 “either\n\nby express words or by providing a comprehensive alternative enforcement\n\nscheme.” Id. ; see also Blessing v. Freestone , 520 U.S. 329, 341 (1997). Congress\n\nhas not expressly prohibited § 1983 suits as remedies for IDEA violations, so we\n\nmust turn to the question of whether the IDEA’s administrative remedies\n\nnevertheless imply congressional intent to do so. Supreme Court precedent guides\n\nour inquiry.\n\n       In Smith v. Robinson , 468 U.S. 992 (1984), the Supreme Court considered\n\nwhether the plaintiffs could pursue “virtually identical” claims for a free\n\nappropriate education under the EHA (IDEA’s predecessor), the Rehabilitation\n\nAct, and § 1983 (based on alleged Equal Protection and Due Process\n\ndeprivations).   Id. at 1009. The Court concluded that the EHA’s thorough\n\nenforcement mechanisms indicated Congress’ intent to proscribe such a course of\n\n\n\nComm. , 59 F. Supp. 2d 237, 244 (D. Mass. 1999) (stating that garden variety.\nviolations of the IDEA cannot form the basis of a § 1983 claim);      compare Marie\nO. v. Edgar , 131 F.3d 610, 621-22 (7th Cir. 1997) (stating § 1983 may be used to\nenforce the IDEA), with Anderson v. Thompson , 658 F.2d 1205, 1214-17 (7th\nCir. 1981) (prohibiting IDEA-based § 1983 claims);      compare Emma C. v. Eastin ,\n985 F. Supp. 940, 945 (N.D. Cal. 1997) (holding that Congress “specifically\nauthorized § 1983 actions predicated on the IDEA”),      with Dep’t of Educ. v.\nKatharina D. , 727 F.2d 809, 819-20 (9th Cir. 1983),    cert. denied , 471 U.S. 1117\n(1985) (holding that the IDEA cannot provide the basis for a § 1983 claim).\n\n                                          -10-\n\faction. See id. at 1012-13, 1018. For example, as to the plaintiffs’ § 1983 claim\n\nbased on the Equal Protection Clause, the Court stated that\n\n      where the EHA is available to a handicapped child asserting a right\n      to a free appropriate public education, based either on the EHA or on\n      the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the EHA\n      is the exclusive avenue through which the child and his parents or\n      guardian can pursue their claim.\n\nId. at 1013. Smith did not specifically involve the question of whether the EHA\n\nprecludes § 1983 suits based on EHA violations. In fact, the Court expressly\n\nrecognized that the plaintiffs’ § 1983 claims alleged constitutional violations, not\n\nEHA violations.   See id. at 1008-09. Nonetheless, the    Court’s holding that the\n\nEHA provided a comprehensive enforcement scheme that preempted other\n\noverlapping but independent statutory or constitutional claims necessarily meant\n\nthat the EHA also supplanted § 1983 claims based simply on EHA violations.\n\n      In response to Smith , Congress amended the EHA in 1986.        See Pub. L. No.\n\n99-372, 100 Stat. 796 (1986); S. Rep. No. 99-112, at 2 (1985),    reprinted in 1986\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 1798, 1799. Among other provisions, Congress added § 1415(f),\n\nwhich stated in pertinent part: “Nothing in this title shall be construed to restrict\n\nor limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available under the Constitution, title\n\nV of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or other Federal statutes protecting the rights\n\nof handicapped children and youth.” This provision obviously voided       Smith ’s\n\nbroad holding that the EHA precludes overlapping but independent claims\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\fotherwise cognizable under the Constitution, the Rehabilitation Act, or other\n\nFederal laws. See Hayes v. Unified Sch. Dist. No. 377      , 877 F.2d 809, 812 (10th\n\nCir. 1989) (“Congress’ amendment of the EHA makes clear that the EHA is not\n\nthe exclusive remedy available to handicapped students seeking public\n\neducational benefits.”); H.R. Rep. No. 99-296, at 6 (1985) (stating that § 1415(f)\n\nis intended to reaffirm “the viability of section 504 [of the Rehabilitation Act]\n\nand other federal statutes such as 42 U.S.C. 1983 as separate from but equally\n\nviable with the EHA as vehicles for securing the rights of handicapped children\n\nand youth”). It is less obvious, however, whether Congress intended § 1415(f) to\n\nalso overrule Smith ’s more narrow implication that the EHA provides a\n\ncomprehensive remedial framework that forecloses recourse to § 1983 as a\n\nremedy for strictly EHA violations. This difficult question has created a split in\n\nthe circuits. Compare, e.g. , Marie O. v. Edgar , 131 F.3d 610, 622 (7th Cir. 1997)\n\n(“§ 1415(f) was enacted for the express purpose of ensuring that § 1983 claims\n\nwould be available to enforce the IDEA.”    ), and W.B. v. Matula , 67 F.3d 484, 494\n\n(3d Cir. 1995) (same), with Sellers v. Sch. Bd. , 141 F.3d 524, 530-32 (4th Cir.\n\n1998) (stating that § 1415(f) does not allow plaintiffs to sue under § 1983 for an\n\nIDEA violation and that § 1415 does not overrule      Smith on that point).\n\n      We agree with the Fourth Circuit that § 1415(f) left intact   Smith ’s\n\nimplication that the EHA may not provide the basis for § 1983 claims.         See\n\n\n                                           -12-\n\fSellers , 141 F.3d at 529-30. Post- Smith Supreme Court precedent compels this\n\nconclusion. Since Congress passed § 1415(f) in 1986, the Court has nevertheless\n\ncited Smith and the EHA/IDEA on at least two occasions as an example of an\n\nexhaustive legislative enforcement scheme that precludes § 1983 causes of action.\n\nSee Blessing , 520 U.S. at 347-48; Wright v. City of Roanoke Redevelopment and\n\nHous. Auth. , 479 U.S. 418, 423-24, 427 (1987). In   Wright , the Court noted that\n\nthe EHA itself “provided for private judicial remedies, thereby evidencing\n\ncongressional intent to supplant the § 1983 remedy.” 479 U.S. at 427. The\n\nBlessing Court discussed Smith as one of only two cases in which it had “found a\n\nremedial scheme sufficiently comprehensive to supplant § 1983.”      520 U.S. at\n\n347. Moreover, the Court used the EHA/IDEA in both cases as a benchmark for\n\nassessing the comprehensiveness of the remedial scheme provided by the statutes\n\nin question. See id. at 348; Wright , 479 U.S. at 427. Based on these cases, it\n\nappears the Supreme Court considers    Smith to be alive and well insofar as it\n\nasserts that § 1983 may not be used to remedy IDEA violations. Accordingly, we\n\nreverse the trial court’s denial of the motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s IDEA-based\n\n§ 1983 claims against the school district, the board of education, and the\n\nindividual defendants. This conclusion moots the qualified immunity issues.\n\nFurthermore, in light of our holding and Plaintiff’s failure to make an\n\n\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\findependent IDEA claim, we need not address whether the IDEA imposes\n\nindividual liability or permits damage awards.\n\n                                            IV.\n\n       Defendants argue that the trial court erred in denying their motion to\n\ndismiss Plaintiff’s ADA claim against the school district and the board of\n\neducation for failure to exhaust her administrative remedies.\n\n       Although Plaintiff proceeds under the auspices of the ADA, the IDEA\n\nnonetheless requires her to first exhaust its administrative procedures and\n\nremedies prior to commencing her ADA suit if she is “      seeking relief that is also\n\navailable under ” the IDEA. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f) (emphasis added). Like the\n\nSeventh Circuit, we understand “available” relief “to mean relief for the events,\n\ncondition, or consequences of which the person complains, not necessarily relief\n\nof the kind the person prefers,”   Charlie F. v. Bd. of Educ. , 98 F.3d 989, 992 (7th\n\nCir. 1996), or specifically seeks. Thus, our primary concern in determining\n\nwhether a plaintiff must utilize the IDEA’s administrative procedures relates to\n\nthe source and nature of the alleged injuries for which he or she seeks a remedy,\n\nnot the specific remedy itself.    See Hayes v. Unified Sch. Dist. No. 377   , 877 F.2d\n\n809, 812 (10th Cir. 1989) (stating that the IDEA’s remedies must be exhausted\n\nbefore a plaintiff files a non-IDEA suit if that “suit could have been filed under\n\nthe” IDEA). In essence, the dispositive question generally is whether the plaintiff\n\n\n                                            -14-\n\fhas alleged injuries that could be redressed to any degree by the IDEA’s\n\nadministrative procedures and remedies. If so, exhaustion of those remedies is\n\nrequired. If not, the claim necessarily falls outside the IDEA’s scope, and\n\nexhaustion is unnecessary. Where the IDEA’s ability to remedy a particular\n\ninjury is unclear, exhaustion should be required in order to give educational\n\nagencies an initial opportunity to ascertain and alleviate the alleged problem.\n\nSee, e.g. , Charlie F. , 98 F.3d at 992, 993.\n\n       So far as we can tell in the instant case, Plaintiff seeks damages solely to\n\nredress the fractured skull and other physical injuries she suffered allegedly as a\n\nresult of the school district’s and board of education’s purported ADA violations.\n\nPlaintiff makes no complaints regarding her current educational situation. Indeed,\n\nshe expressly attests that her new school “meets her educational needs” and that\n\nshe presently receives “the full benefits of a free and appropriate education in an\n\nintegrated, least restrictive educational environment.” Under these narrow\n\ncircumstances, we fail to see how the IDEA’s administrative remedies, oriented as\n\nthey are to providing prospective educational benefits, could possibly begin to\n\nassuage Plaintiff’s severe physical, and completely non-educational, injuries.\n\nThat is not to say damages are unavailable under the IDEA. We have not\n\npreviously addressed that question and need not to resolve this case. Our holding\n\nsimply recognizes the fact that even if damages are available under the IDEA they\n\n\n                                           -15-\n\fshould be awarded in civil actions, not in administrative hearings.      Cf. Covington\n\nv. Knox County Sch. Sys. , 205 F.3d 912, 918 (6th Cir. 2000) (stating that\n\ndamages are “unavailable through the [IDEA] administrative process”);           W.B. v.\n\nMatula , 67 F.3d 484, 494-96 (3d Cir. 1995) (holding that IDEA-based § 1983\n\nsuits permit damage awards, but damages cannot be awarded during the course of\n\nthe IDEA’s administrative proceedings).\n\n       We affirm the district court’s denial of Defendants’ motion to dismiss for\n\nfailure to exhaust administrative remedies. Under the narrow circumstances of\n\nthis case, exhaustion was unnecessary because, so far as we can tell, Plaintiff’s\n\nADA claim is not seeking “relief that is also available” under the IDEA.\n\n       In conclusion, we note that other circuits, although employing slightly\n\ndifferent approaches to the problem, have reached similar conclusions under\n\nsimilar circumstances. For example, in       Witte v. Clark County Sch. Dist.   , 197\n\nF.3d 1271, 1275-76 (9th Cir. 1999), the Ninth Circuit held that exhaustion was\n\nnot required where the plaintiff was seeking “only monetary damages” for alleged\n\n“physical abuse and injury” and “all educational issues already have been\n\nresolved to the parties’ mutual satisfaction.”      The court noted that “[t]he remedies\n\navailable under the IDEA would not appear to be well suited to addressing past\n\nphysical injuries adequately; such injuries typically are remedied through an\n\naward of monetary damages.”       Id. at 1276. Likewise, in Matula , 67 F.3d at 496,\n\n\n                                             -16-\n\fthe Third Circuit refused to require administrative exhaustion in a claim for\n\ncompensatory damages in part because the parties had already settled their\n\ndisputes over IDEA rights.\n\n      Moreover, circuit court cases cited by Defendants that have required\n\nplaintiffs who seek damages to exhaust their IDEA administrative remedies have\n\ndone so where the plaintiffs’ alleged injuries were educational in nature and\n\ntherefore presumptively redressable through the IDEA’s administrative\n\nprocedures. See, e.g. , Thompson v. Bd. of Special Sch. Dist. 1   , 144 F.3d 574,\n\n580 (8th Cir. 1998) (requiring exhaustion where plaintiff sought damages and\n\none-on-one tutoring to remedy alleged denial of free and appropriate public\n\neducation, and dismissing § 1983 claim on insufficient evidence grounds);     Charlie\n\nF., 98 F.3d at 993 (requiring exhaustion where the plaintiff alleged “that his\n\neducation has suffered”);   N.B. by D.G. v. Alachua County Sch. Bd.    , 84 F.3d\n\n1376, 1378 (11th Cir. 1996) (requiring exhaustion where the plaintiff’s alleged\n\ninjuries included segregation from non-disabled children and unnecessary absence\n\nfrom school). Under those distinct circumstances, we would also require\n\nexhaustion.\n\n      The denial of the motion to dismiss the § 1983 actions is REVERSED. The\n\ndenial of the motion to dismiss the ADA action is AFFIRMED. The case is\n\nREMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\f",

See id. § 1415(a). To identify\n\nnecessary services, the IDEA requires representatives of the responsible\n\neducational agencies, in meetings with parents and teachers, to develop an\n\nindividualized education program (IEP) for each child with a disability. The IEP\n\nincludes a written statement of the present educational level of such child, of\n\nannual goals and short-term instructional objectives, and of “specific educational\n\n      2\n       Congress changed the EHA’s name to the IDEA in 1990.

During one of\n\nthese incidents she tipped over and hit her head on the floor, suffering serious\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fphysical injuries, including a skull fracture and exacerbation of a seizure disorder,\n\nwhich kept her from attending school for the remainder of the term. The school\n\ndistrict thereafter failed to provide homebound schooling adequate to insure the\n\nfree appropriate public education to which she was entitled.\n\n      In August 1997, Plaintiff moved to a new school district and began\n\nattending a different school, neither of which is a party to this action. In February\n\n1998, she requested an administrative hearing from the defendant school district\n\nto “contest certain actions of . . . [district] personnel.” In her request, Plaintiff\n\nsought “any relief” available through the administrative process, “including\n\nmoney damages and attorney fees.” Plaintiff’s hearing request was denied by the\n\nhearing officer, who ruled that he lacked jurisdiction “as the petitioner does not\n\nreside within the school district,” and that he lacked authority to grant the\n\nrequested relief.\n\n      Thereafter, Plaintiff filed the instant suit, raising two claims. First, she\n\nalleged that the school district and the board of education violated her rights\n\nunder the ADA by excluding her from participation in publicly funded general\n\nand special education programs based on her disability. Second, she brought an\n\naction under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that the school district, the board of\n\neducation, and several individual district employees violated her rights under the\n\n\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fIDEA by denying her a free and appropriate public education. Plaintiff\n\nspecifically seeks monetary damages for both the ADA and § 1983 claims.\n\n       Defendants moved to dismiss, arguing that (1) Plaintiff failed to exhaust\n\nher administrative remedies; (2) damages are unavailable under the IDEA and\n\ntherefore unavailable in a § 1983 claim based on an IDEA violation; (3) the IDEA\n\ndoes not allow individual liability actions, and, therefore, individuals cannot be\n\nliable under a § 1983 claim based on an IDEA violation; and (4) the individual\n\ndefendants were entitled to qualified immunity. The district court dismissed\n\nPlaintiff’s § 1983 claim as it applied to one of the individual defendants but\n\ndenied the motion in all other respects, and the remaining defendants brought this\n\nappeal.\n\n                                             III.\n\n       “We review the denial or grant of a motion to dismiss de novo, applying the\n\nsame standard used by the district court.”      Breidenbach , 126 F.3d at 1291. We\n\nfirst address the viability of Plaintiff’s IDEA-based § 1983 claims. The district\n\ncourt determined that the IDEA allows for damage awards and that it may be\n\nenforced against individuals. Therefore, the court reasoned, Plaintiff can likewise\n\nsue individuals and seek damages in a § 1983 suit based on the IDEA. The\n\ndistrict court’s analysis presupposes that § 1983 may be used to enforce the IDEA\n\n\n\n\n                                             -8-\n\fin the first place.

For example, as to the plaintiffs’ § 1983 claim\n\nbased on the Equal Protection Clause, the Court stated that\n\n      where the EHA is available to a handicapped child asserting a right\n      to a free appropriate public education, based either on the EHA or on\n      the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the EHA\n      is the exclusive avenue through which the child and his parents or\n      guardian can pursue their claim.\n\nId. at 1013. Smith did not specifically involve the question of whether the EHA\n\nprecludes § 1983 suits based on EHA violations. In fact, the Court expressly\n\nrecognized that the plaintiffs’ § 1983 claims alleged constitutional violations, not\n\nEHA violations.   See id. at 1008-09. Nonetheless, the    Court’s holding that the\n\nEHA provided a comprehensive enforcement scheme that preempted other\n\noverlapping but independent statutory or constitutional claims necessarily meant\n\nthat the EHA also supplanted § 1983 claims based simply on EHA violations.\n\n      In response to Smith , Congress amended the EHA in 1986.        See Pub. L. No.\n\n99-372, 100 Stat. 796 (1986); S. Rep. No. 99-112, at 2 (1985),    reprinted in 1986\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 1798, 1799. Among other provisions, Congress added § 1415(f),\n\nwhich stated in pertinent part: “Nothing in this title shall be construed to restrict\n\nor limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available under the Constitution, title\n\nV of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or other Federal statutes protecting the rights\n\nof handicapped children and youth.” This provision obviously voided       Smith ’s\n\nbroad holding that the EHA precludes overlapping but independent claims\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\fotherwise cognizable under the Constitution, the Rehabilitation Act, or other\n\nFederal laws.

It is less obvious, however, whether Congress intended § 1415(f) to\n\nalso overrule Smith ’s more narrow implication that the EHA provides a\n\ncomprehensive remedial framework that forecloses recourse to § 1983 as a\n\nremedy for strictly EHA violations.

Since Congress passed § 1415(f) in 1986, the Court has nevertheless\n\ncited Smith and the EHA/IDEA on at least two occasions as an example of an\n\nexhaustive legislative enforcement scheme that precludes § 1983 causes of action.\n\nSee Blessing , 520 U.S. at 347-48; Wright v. City of Roanoke Redevelopment and\n\nHous. Auth. , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111790\"><a href=\"/opinion/111790/wright-v-roanoke-redevelopment-and-housing-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">418</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 423-24, 427 (1987). In   Wright , the Court noted that\n\nthe EHA itself “provided for private judicial remedies, thereby evidencing\n\ncongressional intent to supplant the § 1983 remedy.” 479 U.S. at 427. The\n\nBlessing Court discussed Smith as one of only two cases in which it had “found a\n\nremedial scheme sufficiently comprehensive to supplant § 1983.”      520 U.S. at\n\n347. Moreover, the Court used the EHA/IDEA in both cases as a benchmark for\n\nassessing the comprehensiveness of the remedial scheme provided by the statutes\n\nin question. See id. at 348; Wright , 479 U.S. at 427. Based on these cases, it\n\nappears the Supreme Court considers    Smith to be alive and well insofar as it\n\nasserts that § 1983 may not be used to remedy IDEA violations. Accordingly, we\n\nreverse the trial court’s denial of the motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s IDEA-based\n\n§ 1983 claims against the school district, the board of education, and the\n\nindividual defendants. This conclusion moots the qualified immunity issues.\n\nFurthermore, in light of our holding and Plaintiff’s failure to make an\n\n\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\findependent IDEA claim, we need not address whether the IDEA imposes\n\nindividual liability or permits damage awards.\n\n                                            IV.\n\n       Defendants argue that the trial court erred in denying their motion to\n\ndismiss Plaintiff’s ADA claim against the school district and the board of\n\neducation for failure to exhaust her administrative remedies.\n\n       Although Plaintiff proceeds under the auspices of the ADA, the IDEA\n\nnonetheless requires her to first exhaust its administrative procedures and\n\nremedies prior to commencing her ADA suit if she is “      seeking relief that is also\n\navailable under ” the IDEA. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f) (emphasis added). Like the\n\nSeventh Circuit, we understand “available” relief “to mean relief for the events,\n\ncondition, or consequences of which the person complains, not necessarily relief\n\nof the kind the person prefers,”   Charlie F. v. Bd. of Educ. , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"728121\"><a href=\"/opinion/728121/charlie-f-by-his-parents-and-next-friends-neil-and-bonnie-f-v-board-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 992 (7th\n\nCir. 1996), or specifically seeks. Thus, our primary concern in determining\n\nwhether a plaintiff must utilize the IDEA’s administrative procedures relates to\n\nthe source and nature of the alleged injuries for which he or she seeks a remedy,\n\nnot the specific remedy itself.    See Hayes v. Unified Sch. Dist. No. 377   , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"525078\"><a href=\"/opinion/525078/dennis-hayes-a-minor-and-sally-hayes-a-minor-through-their-parents/\"><span class=\"volume\">877</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">809</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 812 (10th Cir. 1989) (stating that the IDEA’s remedies must be exhausted\n\nbefore a plaintiff files a non-IDEA suit if that “suit could have been filed under\n\nthe” IDEA). In essence, the dispositive question generally is whether the plaintiff\n\n\n                                            -14-\n\fhas alleged injuries that could be redressed to any degree by the IDEA’s\n\nadministrative procedures and remedies. If so, exhaustion of those remedies is\n\nrequired. If not, the claim necessarily falls outside the IDEA’s scope, and\n\nexhaustion is unnecessary. Where the IDEA’s ability to remedy a particular\n\ninjury is unclear, exhaustion should be required in order to give educational\n\nagencies an initial opportunity to ascertain and alleviate the alleged problem.\n\nSee, e.g. , Charlie F. , 98 F.3d at 992, 993.\n\n       So far as we can tell in the instant case, Plaintiff seeks damages solely to\n\nredress the fractured skull and other physical injuries she suffered allegedly as a\n\nresult of the school district’s and board of education’s purported ADA violations.\n\nPlaintiff makes no complaints regarding her current educational situation. Indeed,\n\nshe expressly attests that her new school “meets her educational needs” and that\n\nshe presently receives “the full benefits of a free and appropriate education in an\n\nintegrated, least restrictive educational environment.” Under these narrow\n\ncircumstances, we fail to see how the IDEA’s administrative remedies, oriented as\n\nthey are to providing prospective educational benefits, could possibly begin to\n\nassuage Plaintiff’s severe physical, and completely non-educational, injuries.\n\nThat is not to say damages are unavailable under the IDEA. We have not\n\npreviously addressed that question and need not to resolve this case. Our holding\n\nsimply recognizes the fact that even if damages are available under the IDEA they\n\n\n                                           -15-\n\fshould be awarded in civil actions, not in administrative hearings.

Under the narrow circumstances of\n\nthis case, exhaustion was unnecessary because, so far as we can tell, Plaintiff’s\n\nADA claim is not seeking “relief that is also available” under the IDEA.\n\n       In conclusion, we note that other circuits, although employing slightly\n\ndifferent approaches to the problem, have reached similar conclusions under\n\nsimilar circumstances.

Likewise, in Matula , 67 F.3d at 496,\n\n\n                                             -16-\n\fthe Third Circuit refused to require administrative exhaustion in a claim for\n\ncompensatory damages in part because the parties had already settled their\n\ndisputes over IDEA rights.\n\n      Moreover, circuit court cases cited by Defendants that have required\n\nplaintiffs who seek damages to exhaust their IDEA administrative remedies have\n\ndone so where the plaintiffs’ alleged injuries were educational in nature and\n\ntherefore presumptively redressable through the IDEA’s administrative\n\nprocedures. See, e.g. , Thompson v. Bd. of Special Sch. Dist. 1   , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754529\"><a href=\"/opinion/754529/leroy-thompson-a-minor-by-and-through-his-parent-and-legal-guardian/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n580 (8th Cir. 1998) (requiring exhaustion where plaintiff sought damages and\n\none-on-one tutoring to remedy alleged denial of free and appropriate public\n\neducation, and dismissing § 1983 claim on insufficient evidence grounds);     Charlie\n\nF., 98 F.3d at 993 (requiring exhaustion where the plaintiff alleged “that his\n\neducation has suffered”);   N.B. by D.G. v.
