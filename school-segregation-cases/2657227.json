Department of Envtl.\n\nProtection, 429 Mass. 798, 801 (1999) (General Electric), we\n\nheld that \"materials privileged as work product . . . are not\n\nprotected from disclosure under the public records statute\n\nunless those materials fall within the scope of an express\n\nstatutory exemption.\"   We noted that there is not an express\n\nstatutory exemption for work product and rejected the claim that\n\nwork product is protected from disclosure by an implied\n\nexemption.   See id. at 801-806.   In General Electric, the\n\nparties were not yet in litigation, so the work product was\n\nsought under the public records act rather than in discovery.\n\nAnd in General Electric we did not reach the issue whether the\n\f                                                                     3\n\n\nwork product would be protected from disclosure under the\n\n\"policy deliberation\" exemption, G. L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-\n\nsixth (d), known as exemption (d).   Here, the parties are in\n\nlitigation, and the work product in the possession of the city\n\nof New Bedford (city) was sought in discovery.   We now revisit\n\nour holding in General Electric and explore the scope of the\n\n\"policy deliberation\" exemption in the context of work product\n\nsought in discovery from a municipality during litigation.      We\n\nconclude that \"opinion\" work product that, as codified in Mass.\n\nR. Civ. P. 26 (b) (3), 365 Mass. 772 (1974), was \"prepared in\n\nanticipation of litigation or for trial by or for [a] party or\n\n. . . that . . . party's representative\" falls within the scope\n\nof exemption (d) and therefore falls outside the definition of\n\n\"public records\" under G. L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth.   We also\n\nconclude that \"fact\" work product under Mass. R. Civ. P. 26 (b)\n\n(3) that was prepared in anticipation of litigation or trial\n\nfalls within the scope of exemption (d), and therefore falls\n\noutside the definition of \"public records,\" where it is not a\n\nreasonably completed study or report or, if it is reasonably\n\ncompleted, where it is interwoven with opinions or analysis\n\nleading to opinions.   Where work product is exempted from\n\ndisclosure under the public records act, it is protected from\n\f                                                                   4\n\n\ndisclosure in discovery to the extent provided by Mass. R. Civ.\n\nP. 26.3\n\n     Background.   The case underlying this appeal concerns\n\nliability for the costs of environmental cleanup of widespread\n\nsoil contamination at and around a site that the city allegedly\n\noperated until the 1970s as an unrestricted ash dump for\n\nindustrial and other waste (site).   In October, 2008, property\n\nowners from a neighborhood around the site filed a civil action\n\nin the Superior Court against the city bringing common-law\n\nclaims and a claim under G. L. c. 21E4 seeking damages arising\n\nfrom the soil contamination.   In December, 2009, the city filed\n\na third-party complaint alleging common-law claims and cost\n\nrecovery claims under G. L. c. 21E against various third-party\n\ndefendants.   After the original complaint was filed and before\n\nthe city filed its third-party complaint, the city solicitor, on\n\n\n     3\n       We acknowledge the amicus briefs submitted by the\nCommonwealth and by the Massachusetts Municipal Association.\n     4\n       G. L. c. 21E, the so-called Massachusetts \"Superfund\" law,\nprovides, in relevant part, that \"any person who . . . caused or\nis legally responsible for a release or threat of release of oil\nor hazardous material from a . . . site\" -- including \"any\nperson who at the time of storage or disposal of any hazardous\nmaterial owned or operated\" the site, and \"any person who . . .\narranged for the transport, disposal, storage or treatment of\nhazardous material to\" the site -- is (subject to statutory\nexceptions) strictly liable, jointly and severally, \"to the\ncommonwealth for all costs of assessment, containment and\nremoval,\" and \"to any person for damage to his real or personal\nproperty incurred or suffered as a result of such release or\nthreat of release.\" G. L. c. 21E, § 5 (a).\n\f                                                                   5\n\n\nbehalf of the city, retained Andrew Smyth, a consultant at TRC\n\nEnvironmental Corporation (TRC), to evaluate the issues related\n\nto the claims in the civil action and to identify sources of the\n\ncontamination that may be legally responsible to pay for the\n\ncleanup.5   Smyth provided his services directly to the city\n\nsolicitor in connection with the litigation pending against the\n\ncity.6\n\n     During the course of discovery, various third-party\n\ndefendants moved to strike the city's privilege and work product\n\nobjections to TRC documents and to compel their production.7   The\n\nthird-party defendants asked, as part of the relief requested,\n\nthat the city be compelled to produce documents that Smyth had\n\nprepared for the city, including two letters to the city\n\nsolicitor and a fifty-two-page \"evaluation report,\" described as\n\n\n     5\n       In the course of conducting response actions at the site\nof the contamination pursuant to G. L. c. 21E and 310 Code Mass.\nRegs. §§ 40.0000, the city of New Bedford (city) retained other\nconsultants as \"Licensed Site Professionals\" for the site. The\ncity represents that the data and records of all licensed site\nprofessionals it retained in connection with the contaminated\nsite, as well as the data and records that Andrew Smyth\nevaluated for the city solicitor, were made available during\ndiscovery to all parties involved in the present litigation.\n     6\n       After the city retained outside legal counsel later in\n2009, Smyth provided his services directly to outside counsel.\n     7\n       The motion was brought by third-party defendants Monsanto\nCompany, Pharmacia Corporation, and Solutia, Inc., and was\njoined by AVX. The motion was pursued by AVX after the three\nthird-party defendants who originally brought the motion were\ndismissed from the case.\n\f                                                                    6\n\n\na draft, regarding the sources and occurrence of soil\n\ncontamination in the relevant area of the city (collectively,\n\nTRC work product).   The city responded that the TRC work product\n\nwas protected from discovery by the attorney-client privilege\n\nand the work product doctrine.   The motion judge rejected the\n\ncity's claim of attorney-client privilege.   The judge also\n\nrejected the city's contention that the documents were protected\n\nfrom disclosure under the work product doctrine codified in\n\nMass. R. Civ. P. 26 (b) (3), even though he found that the\n\ndocuments contained \"information which was intended to assist\n\nthe city solicitor in advising the [c]ity as to the potential\n\nlitigation.\"   Citing General Electric, the judge concluded that\n\nthe TRC work product, having been received by the city\n\nsolicitor, constituted \"public records\" as defined in G. L.\n\nc. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth, and therefore was subject to discovery\n\nunless it fit \"within an enumerated exception.\"   Because there\n\nis no enumerated exception for work product, and because the\n\ndocuments were not protected by the attorney-client privilege,\n\nthe judge allowed the third-party defendants' motion, and\n\nordered that the work product be produced.   The judge noted that\n\n\"but for the public records law, said materials would clearly\n\nconstitute attorney work product, and would be subject to a\n\nheightened standard for disclosure as codified in Mass. R. Civ.\n\nP. 26 (b) (3).\"\n\f                                                                      7\n\n\n    Following the ruling, the city moved for a protective order\n\nto preclude the third-party defendants from inquiring into the\n\nTRC work product at a deposition.    The judge construed the\n\nmotion as seeking a stay of the court's order, and allowed the\n\nmotion to give the city an opportunity to file an interlocutory\n\nappeal.    The city petitioned a single justice of the Appeals\n\nCourt for interlocutory review, and the single justice allowed\n\nthe petition and reported it to a full panel of the Appeals\n\nCourt.    We granted direct appellate review.\n\n    On appeal, the city claims that the court should exercise\n\nits inherent authority to rule that the TRC work product, even\n\nif it consists of \"public records,\" should be protected from\n\ndiscovery during pending litigation by the work product doctrine\n\ncodified in Mass. R. Civ. P. 26 (b) (3).       The city also argues\n\nthat these documents are not \"public records\" because they are\n\nprotected from public disclosure by the \"policy deliberation\"\n\nexemption in G. L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth (d).       Finally, the\n\ncity argues that the TRC work product is protected from\n\ndisclosure by the so-called derivative attorney-client\n\nprivilege.\n\n    Discussion.     1.   Work product.    We begin our analysis by\n\ndiscussing the public records law.       Under the public records\n\nact, G. L. c. 66, § 10 (act), \"Every person having custody of\n\nany public record, as defined in [G. L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-\n\f                                                                   8\n\n\nsixth], shall, . . . without unreasonable delay, permit it, or\n\nany segregable portion of a record which is an independent\n\npublic record, to be inspected and examined by any person\n\n. . . .\"   G. L. c. 66, § 10 (a).   \"Public records,\" as defined\n\nin G. L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth, includes \"all . . .\n\ndocumentary materials or data . . .    made or received by any\n\nofficer or employee\" of any agency, office, or authority of\n\nState or local government, unless such records fall within one\n\nof twenty exemptions.   Exemption (d), the so-called \"policy\n\ndeliberation\" exemption, protects from public disclosure \"inter-\n\nagency or intra-agency memoranda or letters relating to policy\n\npositions being developed by the agency; but . . . shall not\n\napply to reasonably completed factual studies or reports on\n\nwhich the development of such policy positions has been or may\n\nbe based.\"   G. L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth (d).\n\n    In General Electric, 429 Mass. at 799, we \"consider[ed]\n\n. . . whether a governmental entity subject to the [act] . . .\n\nmay withhold from public disclosure documents and other records\n\non the basis of an implied exemption for materials covered by\n\nthe work product doctrine.\"   When the Department of\n\nEnvironmental Protection (DEP) withheld a set of documents in\n\nresponse to a public records request, General Electric commenced\n\nan action in the Superior Court under G. L. c. 66, § 10 (b),\n\nseeking disclosure of the withheld documents, and the parties\n\f                                                                     9\n\n\nfiled cross motions for summary judgment.    See id. at 799-800.\n\nThe judge allowed DEP's motion, \"concluding that because the\n\n[act] should not be read as an implicit legislative abrogation\n\nof well-established legal doctrines, work product enjoys an\n\nimplied exemption from disclosure under the statute.\"       Id. at\n\n800-801.    We disagreed, concluding that work product as defined\n\nin Mass. R. Civ. P. 26 (b) (3) is \"not protected from disclosure\n\nunder the [act] unless those materials fall within the scope of\n\nan express statutory exemption.\"    Id. at 801.\n\n    In support of this conclusion, we noted the broad scope of\n\nthe act and its definition of \"public records.\"    See id.     We\n\nalso noted that the act specifically declares that, in any court\n\nproceeding challenging the withholding of a requested document,\n\n\"there shall be a presumption that the record sought is public,\n\nand the burden shall be upon the custodian to prove with\n\nspecificity the exemption which applies.\"    G. L. c. 66,\n\n§ 10 (c).   See General Electric, 429 Mass. at 801.   We\n\ndetermined that \"the statute's clear and unambiguous language\n\nmandates disclosure of requested public records limited only by\n\nthe definition of public record found in G. L. c. 4, § 7,\n\nTwenty-sixth.\"   Id. at 802.   In short, we determined that the\n\f                                                                  10\n\n\nonly exemptions in the act are those identified in the act, and\n\nrefused to imply any exemption from disclosure.8\n\n     We further noted that the act was modeled on the Federal\n\nFreedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552 (2012) (FOIA), which\n\ncontains an exemption protecting from disclosure \"inter-agency\n\nor intra-agency memorand[a] or letters which would not be\n\navailable by law to a party other than an agency in litigation\n\nwith the agency.\"   5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5).   See General Electric,\n\n429 Mass. at 803-804.   The comparable exemption in the act,\n\nexemption (d), excluded from public disclosure \"inter-agency or\n\nintra-agency memoranda or letters relating to policy positions\n\nbeing developed by the agency,\" and does not expressly exclude\n\ninternal memoranda or letters that would not be available to a\n\nparty in litigation with the agency.   G. L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-\n\n\n     8\n       Apart from the \"clear and unambiguous language\" of the\npublic records act (act), we concluded that the Legislature did\nnot intend to include an implied exemption for work product\nbecause an exemption (k) that had been included in the bill that\nbecame the act when the bill was originally passed by the House\nof Representatives was excluded from the bill subsequently\nrecommended by the conference committee and was not ultimately\nenacted. See General Elec. Co. v. Department of Envtl.\nProtection, 429 Mass. 798, 802-803 (1999) (General Electric).\nExemption (k) would have shielded from public disclosure all\n\"records pertaining to any civil litigation in which an agency\n. . . is involved, except in response to a subpoena, and only\nprior to final judicial determination or settlement of such\nlitigation.\" Id. See 1973 House Doc. No. 7433, § 1. We\ndeclared, \"The express deletion of this provision confirms our\nconclusion that the Legislature did not intend implicitly to\nincorporate a work product exemption.\" General Electric, supra\nat 803.\n\f                                                                   11\n\n\nsixth (d).   We concluded that the \"differences between the two\n\nstatutes reflect a conscious decision by the Legislature to\n\ndeviate from the standard embodied in the Federal statute\n\nconcerning the disclosure of [attorney work product].\"    General\n\nElectric, supra at 804, quoting Globe Newspaper Co. v. Boston\n\nRetirement Bd., 388 Mass. 427, 433 (1983).\n\n    Having concluded that the act includes no implied exemption\n\nfor documents within the common-law work product doctrine, we\n\nvacated that part of the judgment that allowed the DEP to\n\nwithhold documents under such an implied exemption, but affirmed\n\nthat part of the judgment that authorized DEP to withhold\n\ndocuments if they met the requirements of the \"policy\n\ndeliberation\" exemption in G. L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth (d).\n\nGeneral Electric, 429 Mass. at 807.    We did not address the\n\nscope of this exemption, or whether it may protect from\n\ndisclosure all or some of the documents that had been withheld\n\nunder the common-law work product doctrine.\n\n    Today, we revisit the reasoning and holding in General\n\nElectric.    We note that this appeal comes to us in a different\n\nposture from General Electric, in that it is not an appeal under\n\nthe act from a judge's decision regarding a public records\n\nrequest, but rather an interlocutory appeal from a judge's\n\f                                                                  12\n\n\nallowance of discovery of work product in a pending lawsuit.9   We\n\nalso note that the judge appeared to understand General Electric\n\nto hold that work product otherwise protected from disclosure in\n\nlitigation under Mass. R. Civ. P. 26 (b) (3) is not protected\n\nwhere it is received by a public employee.   The judge's decision\n\ndid not address whether the reports at issue fall within\n\nexemption (d) of the act and for that reason are not public\n\nrecords under the act.\n\n     We no longer hold to the view declared in General Electric\n\nthat there are no implied exemptions to the public records act,\n\nand that all records in the possession of a governmental entity\n\n     9\n       AVX did additionally file a public records request with\nthe city solicitor's office seeking access to \"correspondence\nand evaluative material created by TRC Companies, Inc.\" The\ncity solicitor denied AVX's request, and -- instead of\nchallenging the denial by bringing a civil action against the\ncity solicitor pursuant to G. L. c. 66, § 10 (b) -- AVX filed an\nadministrative appeal with the supervisor of public records\n(supervisor), also pursuant to G. L. c. 66, § 10 (b). After we\nhad taken the city's appeal in this case under advisement, the\nsupervisor issued a letter ruling in which the city was \"ordered\nto provide all responsive records to [AVX] in a manner\nconsistent with this order.\" Letter Determination of the\nSupervisor of Public Records, SPR 14/766, Mar. 10, 2015, at 4.\nThe supervisor found that the city had \"failed to meet its\nburden in withholding the responsive records pursuant to\n[e]xemption (d),\" because its response did \"not contain the\nspecificity required for the denial of access to public\nrecords.\" Id. at 2. The supervisor also found that the city\n\"had failed to meet[] its burden of specificity to show the\n[attorney-client] privilege exists.\" Id. at 3. After the\nsupervisor issued this decision, the city requested that the\ndecision be withdrawn pending resolution of the city's appeal to\nthis court and, in the alternative, requested that the\nsupervisor reconsider her decision and schedule a hearing on the\nmatter. The supervisor has yet to rule on the city's request.\n\f                                                                     13\n\n\nmust be disclosed under the act unless they fall within one of\n\nthe exemptions identified in G. L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth.     In\n\nSuffolk Constr. Co. v. Division of Capital Asset Mgt., 449 Mass.\n\n444, 445-446, 455-461 (2007), we concluded that communications\n\nwithin the attorney-client privilege are impliedly exempt from\n\nthe definition of \"public records\" and therefore are protected\n\nfrom public disclosure under the act.   We declared that \"the\n\nattorney-client privilege is a fundamental component of the\n\nadministration of justice,\" and that withdrawal of the privilege\n\nis \"not required by the plain terms of the public records law\"\n\nand would \"severely inhibit the ability of government officials\n\nto obtain quality legal advice essential to the faithful\n\ndischarge of their duties, place public entities at an unfair\n\ndisadvantage vis-à-vis private parties with whom they transact\n\nbusiness and for whom the attorney-client privilege is all but\n\ninviolable, and impede the public's strong interest in the fair\n\nand effective administration of justice.\"   Id. at 446.\n\n    Later, in Commonwealth v. Fremont Inv. & Loan, 459 Mass.\n\n209, 211-216 (2011), we determined that documents that had been\n\nprovided in discovery by a defendant to the Attorney General in\n\nan enforcement action and were protected from disclosure to\n\nothers by a protective order were not subject to disclosure\n\nunder the act.   In response to the argument that such records,\n\nonce received by the Attorney General, were not excluded from\n\f                                                                     14\n\n\nthe act by any exemption, we stated that the argument was \"based\n\non the mistaken premise that all documents in the hands of\n\npublic officials must, absent an applicable exception, be made\n\npublic notwithstanding a court order prohibiting their\n\ncirculation.\"   Id. at 215.   We noted that the issuance of such\n\nprotective orders is among the \"inherent powers\" of a court, and\n\nthat such orders \"serve to shield litigants and third parties\n\nfrom unwarranted disclosures, and, as a practical matter, to\n\nfacilitate the discovery necessary for a trial.\"     Id. at 213-\n\n214.    We also noted that the act \"is silent on the issue of\n\nprotective orders,\" and that, \"as a matter of statutory\n\nconstruction,\" we did not believe that \"the Legislature would\n\nendeavor to effect such a significant change to a long-standing\n\nand fundamental power of the judiciary by implication.\"     Id. at\n\n215.    In essence, we declared an implied exemption for records\n\nwhose disclosure is limited by a court's protective order.\n\n       Before considering whether an implied exemption for work\n\nproduct otherwise protected in discovery under Mass. R. Civ. P.\n\n26 (b) (3) might be necessary to preserve the fair\n\nadministration of justice, we consider whether some or all such\n\nwork product might be protected from disclosure under the act by\n\nthe \"policy deliberation\" exemption in Twenty-sixth (d).10      We\n\n\n       10\n       The third-party defendants claim that the city waived its\nright to argue on appeal that the work product at issue in this\n\f                                                                   15\n\n\nreject the suggestion that the Legislature, in crafting the\n\nexemptions under the act, intended that all such work product\n\nwould be public records under the act and therefore would be\n\navailable to the public upon request.    In General Electric, we\n\nconcluded that the Legislature did not intend a separate,\n\nimplied exemption for work product; we did not conclude that all\n\nwork product would be outside the scope of other express\n\nexemptions.   In fact, we specifically affirmed \"that part of the\n\njudgment declaring that [DEP] 'may withhold documents requested\n\nunder G. L. c. 66, § 10 . . . if they meet the requirements of\n\nG. L. c. 4, § 7, [Twenty-sixth] (d).'\"   General Electric, 429\n\nMass. at 807.11   The holding in General Electric was concisely\n\n\n\n\ncase is within the scope of exemption (d) because the city\nfailed to raise that argument in opposition to the third-party\ndefendants' motion to strike the city's privilege objections and\ncompel production. We reject this claim where, at the hearing\non the motion, the city solicitor stated that \"the reference in\n[General Electric] to noted exemptions . . . would apply to work\nconducted in anticipation of litigation,\" and, at the hearing on\nthe city's subsequent motion for a protective order, the judge\ndeclared that he had considered the \"deliberative process\nexemption\" in allowing the third-party defendants' motion.\n     11\n       In General Electric, where the Department of\nEnvironmental Protection (DEP) had shared documents with the\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency \"as part of\ncoordinated investigative or remedial efforts,\" we held that DEP\nwas \"entitled to assert protection of the shared materials under\nexemption (d)\" even though exemption (d) only protects \"inter-\nagency or intra-agency\" documents, and the public records\nstatute defines \"agency\" to mean \"agency of the commonwealth\"\nand does not expressly include Federal agencies within the scope\nof that definition. General Electric, 429 Mass. at 806-807.\n\f                                                                  16\n\n\nsummarized in the Suffolk Construction decision:   \"We concluded,\n\nin relevant part, that the [act] and its history expressed the\n\nLegislature's intent to abrogate the broad attorney work-product\n\nprivilege, and instead to provide to attorney work product the\n\nnarrower, time-limited protection afforded under G. L. c. 4,\n\n§ 7, Twenty-sixth (d) . . . .\"   Suffolk Constr. Co., 449 Mass.\n\nat 455, citing General Electric, supra at 802-804.12\n\n     In discerning legislative intent, we recognize the\n\nimportance of the difference in language that we identified in\n\nGeneral Electric between exemption (d) and its Federal FOIA\n\ncounterpart, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5), but to understand the\n\nsignificance of those differences, we must look to the governing\n\ninterpretation of FOIA exemption (5) in 1973, when exemption (d)\n\nwas enacted.   In Environmental Protection Agency v. Mink, 410\n\nU.S. 73, 85-94 (1973) (Mink), the United States Supreme Court\n\n\nBut we did not reach the question whether any of the documents\nat issue otherwise met the requirements of exemption (d).\n     12\n       We reject any suggestion that we can infer that the\nLegislature intended that all work product in the possession of\na government agency be publicly available because the\nLegislature failed to enact exemption (k). The proposed\nexemption (k) would have shielded much more than work product\n\"prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for\n[a] party or . . . that . . . party's representative,\" Mass. R.\nCiv. P. 26 (b) (3), 365 Mass. 772 (1974), because it included\nall \"records pertaining to any civil litigation in which an\nagency . . . is involved.\" 1973 House Doc. No. 7433, § 1.\nAlthough we recognize that we found the failure to enact\nexemption (k) significant in General Electric, 429 Mass. at 802-\n803, we now conclude that little can be inferred from the\nrejection of so broad and ambiguous an exemption.\n\f                                                                   17\n\n\ninterpreted the rather barebones language of exemption (5),\n\nwhich exempts from disclosure \"inter-agency or intra-agency\n\nmemorand[a] or letters which would not be available by law to a\n\nparty . . . in litigation with the agency.\"   The Court declared\n\nthat the legislative history of exemption (5) demonstrates that\n\nit was \"intended to incorporate generally the recognized rule\n\nthat 'confidential intra-agency advisory opinions . . . are\n\nprivileged from inspection'\" in order to further the public\n\npolicy of \"'open, frank discussion between subordinate and chief\n\nconcerning administrative action.'\"   Id. at 86-87, quoting\n\nKaiser Aluminum & Chem. Corp. v. United States, 141 Ct. Cl. 38,\n\n48-49 (1958).   The Court quoted the following passage from the\n\nreport of the Senate committee that drafted the legislation:\n\n    \"It was pointed out in the comments of many of the agencies\n    that it would be impossible to have any frank discussion of\n    legal or policy matters in writing if all such writings\n    were to be subjected to public scrutiny. It was argued,\n    and with merit, that efficiency of Government would be\n    greatly hampered if, with respect to legal and policy\n    matters, all Government agencies were prematurely forced to\n    'operate in a fishbowl.' The committee is convinced of the\n    merits of this general proposition, but it has attempted to\n    delimit the exception as narrowly as consistent with\n    efficient Government operation.\"\n\nMink, supra at 87, quoting S. Rep. No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st\n\nSess. 9 (1965).   The Court noted the difficulty of attempting to\n\nascertain in the absence of litigation whether documents would\n\nbe available in discovery, where \"we do not know whether the\n\nGovernment is to be treated as though it were a prosecutor, a\n\f                                                                  18\n\ncivil plaintiff, or a defendant.\"    Mink, supra at 86.   And,\n\ndistinguishing \"matters of law, policy, or opinion\" from \"purely\n\nfactual material,\" the Court stated, \"in the absence of a claim\n\nthat disclosure would jeopardize state secrets, . . .     memoranda\n\nconsisting only of compiled factual material or purely factual\n\nmaterial contained in deliberative memoranda and severable from\n\nits context would generally be available for discovery by\n\nprivate parties in litigation with the Government\" and would not\n\nbe protected by exemption (5) (citation omitted).    Id. at 87-89,\n\n91.\n\n      Later that year, when the Massachusetts Legislature was\n\ncrafting the act, it made clear from the language of\n\nexemption (d) that it protected documents \"relating to policy\n\npositions being developed by the agency,\" but did not protect\n\n\"reasonably completed factual studies or reports on which the\n\ndevelopment of such policy positions has been or may be based.\"\n\nG. L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth (d).   In short, although the\n\nlegislative history is silent on this point, the Legislature\n\navoided the difficulty of ascertaining in the absence of\n\nlitigation what might be discoverable by omitting the litigation\n\nlanguage in FOIA exemption (5), and the Legislature added\n\nlanguage clarifying the focus on the formulation of policy that\n\nwas only implied by the language in FOIA exemption (5), and\n\f                                                                  19\n\n\nexpressly incorporated the understanding stated in Mink\n\nregarding purely factual material.13\n\n     The word \"policy\" is not defined in the act, but we discern\n\nfrom the language of exemption (d) of the act and from the\n\nhistorical context of its enactment that the word was intended\n\nto be defined broadly to accomplish the purpose it shares with\n\nexemption (5) of FOIA:   the protection of open, frank inter-\n\nagency and intra-agency deliberations regarding government\n\ndecisions.14   Compare General Electric, 429 Mass. at 807 (\"The\n\npurpose of exemption [d] is to foster independent discussions\n\nbetween those responsible for a governmental decision in order\n\nto secure the quality of the decision\"), with National Labor\n\nRelations Bd. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 150 (1975),\n\nquoting S. Rep. No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 9 (1965), and\n\nCarl Zeiss Stiftung v. V.E.B. Carl Zeiss, Jena, 40 F.R.D. 318,\n\n324 (D.D.C. 1966) (\"the 'frank discussion of legal or policy\n\nmatters' in writing might be inhibited if the discussion were\n\nmade public; and . . . the 'decisions' and 'policies [ . . . ]\n\n\n     13\n       We note that it was not until 1975, almost one and one-\nhalf years after the act was signed into law, that the United\nStates Supreme Court explicitly stated that the work product\ndoctrine is incorporated in exemption (5) of the Freedom of\nInformation Act. See National Labor Relations Bd. v. Sears,\nRoebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 154-155 (1975).\n     14\n       Cf. Webster's New World Dictionary 1045 (3d ed. 1988)\n(broadly defining \"policy\" in relevant part as \"a principle,\nplan, or course of action, as pursued by a government\").\n\f                                                                    20\n\n\nformulated' would be the poorer as a result\").     And where FOIA\n\nincorporates within its scope the Federal common-law\n\n\"deliberative process privilege,\" we think that a parallel\n\nprotection from disclosure under the public records statute was\n\ncodified by the \"policy deliberation\" exemption in Twenty-\n\nsixth (d).   See, e.g., National Council of La Raza v. Department\n\nof Justice, 411 F.3d 350, 356 (2d Cir. 2005), quoting Grand\n\nCent. Partnership v. Cuomo, 166 F.3d 473, 482 (2d Cir. 1999)\n\n(\"An inter- or intra-agency document may be withheld pursuant to\n\nthe deliberative process privilege if it is:   (1)\n\n'predecisional,' i.e., 'prepared in order to assist an agency\n\ndecisionmaker in arriving at his decision,' and (2)\n\n'deliberative,' i.e., 'actually . . . related to the process by\n\nwhich policies are formulated'\").\n\n    Where an agency, as here, is engaged in litigation,\n\ndecisions regarding litigation strategy and case preparation\n\nfall within the rubric of \"policy deliberation.\"     A decision\n\nmade in anticipation of litigation or during litigation is no\n\nless a \"policy\" decision and is no less in need of the\n\nprotection from disclosure provided by exemption (d) simply\n\nbecause it is made in the context of litigation.     See Bobkoski\n\nv. Board of Educ. of Cary Consol. Sch. Dist. 26, 141 F.R.D. 88,\n\n92-93 (N.D. Ill. 1992) (\"trial related strategy discussions\n\nnecessarily involve a governmental entity's deliberative process\n\f                                                                   21\n\n\nwhereby the entity's members review and select among various\n\noptions presented,\" and \"the value of such strategic discussions\n\ndepends upon the open and frank recommendations and opinions\n\nthat the deliberative process privilege attempts to foster\").15\n\nIf anything, the need for nondisclosure of materials relating to\n\nthe government's preparation for litigation is even greater than\n\nthe need for nondisclosure of deliberative materials in other\n\ncontexts, because litigation is an adversarial process, where\n\nthe disclosure of these materials might be used to the detriment\n\nof the government by its litigation adversary.   See National\n\nCouncil of La Raza, 411 F.3d at 356, quoting Department of\n\nInterior v. Klamath Water Users Protective Ass'n, 532 U.S. 1, 8-\n\n9 (2001) (Klamath) (\"deliberative process privilege . . . is\n\nbased on 'the obvious realization that officials will not\n\ncommunicate candidly among themselves if each remark is a\n\npotential item of discovery'\").\n\n     In describing the scope of exemption (d) as it applies to\n\nlitigation-related work product, it makes sense to apply the\n\nwork product terminology we apply in discovery during civil\n\nlitigation under Mass. R. Civ. P. 26.   We have recognized that\n\nthere are two categories of work product under rule 26:     fact\n\n\n     15\n       See also Heggestad v. United States Dep't of Justice, 182\nF. Supp. 2d 1, 7 (D.D.C. 2000) (\"Documents covered by the\ndeliberative process privilege are often also protected by the\nattorney work-product privilege\").\n\f                                                                  22\n\n\nwork product and opinion work product.    See Commissioner of\n\nRevenue v. Comcast Corp., 453 Mass. 293, 314 (2009) (Comcast).\n\nUnder rule 26 (b) (3), \"[t]he protection [for work product] is\n\nqualified, and can be overcome if the party seeking discovery\n\ndemonstrates \"'substantial need of the materials' and that it is\n\n'unable without undue hardship to obtain the substantial\n\nequivalent of the materials by other means.'\"    Id., quoting\n\nMass. R. Civ. P. 26 (b) (3).   Opinion work product, which is\n\ndescribed in rule 26 (b) (3) as \"the mental impressions,\n\nconclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an attorney or other\n\nrepresentative of a party concerning the litigation,\" is\n\n\"afforded greater protection than 'fact' work product.\"\n\nComcast, supra.   We have yet to decide whether the protection of\n\nopinion work product is absolute, see id. at 315, but \"at a\n\nminimum . . . a highly persuasive showing\" is needed to justify\n\nthe disclosure of opinion work product.   United States v.\n\nAdlman, 134 F.3d 1194, 1204 (2d Cir. 1998).   See Comcast, supra,\n\nquoting Reporters' Notes to Rule 26, Mass. Ann. Laws Court\n\nRules, Rules of Civil Procedure, at 545 (LexisNexis 2008)\n\n(disclosure of opinion work product might be appropriate \"only\n\nin rare or 'extremely unusual' circumstances\").\n\n    Opinion work product sought in anticipation of or during\n\nthe pendency of litigation is related to \"policy positions being\n\ndeveloped by the agency\" and therefore is protected from\n\f                                                                   23\n\n\ndisclosure by exemption (d).   Therefore, a litigant should not\n\nsucceed in obtaining opinion work product that would be\n\nprotected from discovery by rule 26 (b) (3) by seeking the\n\nopinion work product through a public records request.16    Fact\n\nwork product is not protected from disclosure under\n\nexemption (d), even if related to policy positions being\n\ndeveloped by the agency, if it is a \"reasonably completed\n\nfactual stud[y] or report[] on which the development of such\n\npolicy positions has been or may be based.\"   G. L. c. 4, § 7,\n\nTwenty-sixth (d).   Where fact work product is not contained\n\nwithin a \"factual study or report,\" or where it is contained in\n\na \"factual study or report\" that is not \"reasonably completed,\"\n\nthen it, too, is protected from disclosure, at least until the\n\nstudy or report is reasonably completed.   Moreover, where a\n\nfactual study or report is reasonably completed but is\n\ninterwoven with opinions or with analysis leading to opinions, a\n\n     16\n       We recognize that exemption (d) protects documents from\ndisclosure \"only while policy is 'being developed,' that is,\nwhile the deliberative process is ongoing and incomplete.\"\nBabets v. Secretary of the Executive Office of Human Servs., 403\nMass. 230, 237 n.8 (1988). But we also recognize that the\ndeliberative process is always ongoing and incomplete during the\ncourse of litigation, because every decision relevant to\nlitigation may be revisited and revised as circumstances change.\nWe leave for another day the question whether opinion work\nproduct might no longer be protected once the litigation is\nconcluded. That issue is not presented here, and may depend on\nthe particular circumstances, such as the risk of similar\nlitigation. It suffices here to conclude that opinion work\nproduct is protected from disclosure under exemption (d) prior\nto and through the pendency of the litigation.\n\f                                                                   24\n\n\npurely factual section of the report might fall outside\n\nexemption (d) but a discussion or analysis section interwoven\n\nwith facts would be protected from disclosure.17\n\n     Under this analysis, exemption (d) would permit a litigant\n\nto obtain more documents through a public records request, at\n\nleast with respect to fact work product, than would be subject\n\nto discovery under rule 26.   See Suffolk Constr. Co., 449 Mass.\n\nat 455.   See also Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Department of Justice,\n\n432 F.3d 366, 372 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (\"the [deliberative process]\n\nprivilege and the [attorney work product] doctrine are not\n\ncoterminous in their sweep\").   We do not believe that this\n\nresult is so inconsistent with the administration of justice\n\nthat we should imply an exemption for work product under the act\n\nconterminous with the sweep of Mass. R. Civ. P. 26 (b) (3), and\n\ndepart from our refusal to do so in General Electric.     Where\n\nopinion work product and some fact work product are already\n\nprotected under exemption (d), where fact work product receives\n\n\n     17\n       Cf. Judicial Watch, Inc. v.

Cf. Fremont Inv. & Loan, 459\n\nMass. at 213-214.   Nor does it so interfere with the fair\n\nadministration of justice that we can reasonably infer that the\n\nLegislature did not intend to require such disclosure.     Cf.\n\nSuffolk Constr. Co., 449 Mass. at 457-461.\n\n    Finally, we conclude that the administration of justice is\n\nbetter served by requiring a public agency to disclose in\n\ndiscovery any requested fact work product that would be\n\ndisclosed pursuant to a public records act request -- even if it\n\nwould otherwise be protected under rule 26 (b) (3) were it not a\n\npublic record -- rather than requiring the litigant to make a\n\npublic records act request for these same documents.   See Babets\n\nv. Secretary of the Executive Office of Human Servs., 403 Mass.\n\n230, 237 n.8 (1988), citing Bougas v. Chief of Police of\n\nLexington, 371 Mass. 59, 64 (1976) (\"It arguably would be\n\nanomalous if access to [public records], intended to be\n\navailable even to the merely 'idly curious,' should be denied to\n\nthose who, like the plaintiffs here, have a specific and\n\f                                                                    26\n\n\ndemonstrable need for them\"); Friedman v. Bache Halsey Stuart\n\nShields, Inc., 738 F.2d 1336, 1344 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (FOIA \"acts\n\nas a 'floor' when discovery of government documents is sought in\n\nthe course of civil litigation,\" such that \"information\n\navailable under the FOIA is likely to be available through\n\ndiscovery\").    We recognize that this might require the judge in\n\nthe underlying litigation to determine the scope of\n\nexemption (d) in resolving a discovery dispute, but a judge\n\nmight have been asked to make the same determination if a\n\nlitigant who made a public records act request appealed the\n\ndenial of that request by a custodian of public records under\n\nG. L. c. 66, § 10 (b).    The difference is that it would likely\n\ntake far longer to resolve the appeal of the public records\n\nrequest denial than it would to resolve a discovery dispute, and\n\nthe appeal might not be decided before the underlying litigation\n\nis concluded.   Where work product is protected from disclosure\n\nunder the act by exemption (d), it must be treated like any\n\nother work product under rule 26 (b) (3), and would be subject\n\nto disclosure only upon the showing of need set forth in that\n\nrule.\n\n    In the case on appeal, the judge concluded that the\n\ndocuments at issue \"clearly constitute attorney work product\"\n\nunder rule 26 (b) (3), and would be \"public records\" unless they\n\nfit within one of the enumerated exemptions, but did not address\n\f                                                                    27\n\n\nwhether the work product is protected from disclosure by\n\nexemption (d).     We conclude that the judge erred in failing to\n\nconsider whether the documents at issue are protected from\n\ndisclosure by exemption (d).\n\n    We also consider the third-party defendants' argument that\n\nthe documents could not be protected by exemption (d) because\n\nreports, letters, or memoranda written by an outside consultant\n\nto the city cannot be \"inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or\n\nletters\" as required by exemption (d).     Where a memorandum or\n\nletter received by the government was prepared at the\n\ngovernment's request by a consultant hired by the government to\n\nassist it in the performance of its own functions, it is both\n\n\"textually possible\" and \"in accord with the purpose\" of\n\nexemption (d) to regard the document as an \"intra-agency\"\n\nmemorandum or letter.     Klamath, 532 U.S. at 9-10, quoting\n\nDepartment of Justice v. Julian, 486 U.S. 1, 18 n.1 (1988)\n\n(Scalia, J., dissenting) (interpreting language in exemption [5]\n\nof FOIA).   There is no reason to require the disclosure of such\n\ndocuments simply because they were prepared by an outside\n\nconsultant temporarily hired by the government rather than by a\n\npublic employee.     See Soucie v. David, 448 F.2d 1067, 1077-1078\n\n& n.44 (D.C. Cir. 1971) (report prepared for government by\n\nconsultant was not necessarily outside scope of FOIA exemption\n\nfor \"inter-agency or intra-agency memorand[a] or letters,\"\n\f                                                                  28\n\n\nbecause \"[t]he [g]overnment may have a special need for the\n\nopinions and recommendations of temporary consultants, and those\n\nindividuals should be able to give their judgments freely\n\nwithout fear of publicity\"); Xerox Corp. v. Webster, 65 N.Y.2d\n\n131, 133 (1985) (\"It would make little sense to protect the\n\ndeliberative process when . . . reports are prepared by agency\n\nemployees yet deny this protection when reports are prepared for\n\nthe same purpose by outside consultants retained by agencies\").\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that the work product in this case is\n\nnot outside the scope of exemption (d)'s protection of \"inter-\n\nagency or intra-agency memoranda or letters\" simply because\n\nSmyth was an outside consultant.\n\n    The practical consequence of our holding today, stated\n\nsimply, is that opinion work product that was prepared in\n\nanticipation of litigation or for trial by or for a party or\n\nparty representative is protected from discovery to the extent\n\nprovided under Mass. R. Civ. P. 26 (b) (3), even where the\n\nopinion work product has been made or received by a State or\n\nlocal government employee.   So is fact work product that is\n\nprepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial where it is\n\nnot a reasonably completed study or report, or, if it is\n\nreasonably completed, is interwoven with opinions or analysis\n\nleading to opinions.   Other fact work product that has been made\n\nor received by a State or local government employee must be\n\f                                                                    29\n\n\ndisclosed in discovery, even if it would be protected from\n\ndiscovery under rule 26 (b) (3) were it not a public record.\n\n    2.     Derivative attorney-client privilege.   We also consider\n\nthe city's argument that, regardless whether the documents are\n\nprotected from disclosure by exemption (d), they are protected\n\nfrom disclosure under the derivative attorney-client privilege\n\nbecause Smyth \"translated\" for the city solicitor \"technical\n\ninformation contained in laboratory data and field observations\"\n\nrelating to the site, and such assistance was necessary for the\n\ncity solicitor to provide legal advice to the city.    Generally,\n\nthe attorney-client privilege protects only \"confidential\n\ncommunications between a client and its attorney undertaken for\n\nthe purpose of obtaining legal advice.\"    Suffolk Constr. Co.,\n\n449 Mass. at 448.   See Comcast, 453 Mass. at 303 (indorsing\n\nWigmore's \"classic formulation\" of attorney-client privilege).\n\nHowever, we have recognized that the derivative attorney-client\n\nprivilege \"can shield communications of a third party employed\n\nto facilitate communication between the attorney and client and\n\nthereby assist the attorney in rendering legal advice to the\n\nclient.\"    Id. at 306, citing United States v. Kovel, 296 F.2d\n\n918, 921-922 (2d Cir. 1961).\n\n    The derivative attorney-client privilege is sharply limited\n\nin scope.   It attaches \"only when the [third party's] role is to\n\nclarify or facilitate communications between attorney and\n\f                                                                     30\n\n\nclient,\" Comcast, 453 Mass. at 308, as where \"the [third party]\n\nfunctions as a 'translator' between the client and the\n\nattorney,\" In re G-I Holdings Inc., 218 F.R.D. 428, 434 (D.N.J.\n\n2003), and is therefore \"nearly indispensable or serve[s] some\n\nspecialized purpose in facilitating the attorney-client\n\ncommunications.\"   Comcast, supra at 307, quoting Cavallaro v.\n\nUnited States, 284 F.3d 236, 249 (1st Cir. 2002).    The privilege\n\ndoes not apply simply because \"an attorney's ability to\n\nrepresent a client is improved, even substantially, by the\n\nassistance\" of an expert.   Comcast, supra.   In short, the\n\nderivative attorney-client privilege protects otherwise\n\nprivileged communications between an attorney and client despite\n\nthe presence of a third party where, without the assistance of\n\nthe third party, what the client says would be \"Greek\" to the\n\nattorney, either because the client is actually speaking in\n\nGreek or because the information provided by the client is so\n\ntechnical in nature that it might as well be spoken in Greek if\n\nthere were not an expert to interpret it for the attorney.     See\n\nid. at 306 (derivative privilege is exception to rule that\n\n\"[d]isclosing attorney-client communications to a third party\n\n. . . undermines the privilege\").\n\n    The communications at issue fail to meet this test.       Even\n\nif Smyth's analysis were critical to the city solicitor's\n\nability to effectively represent the city because the technical\n\f                                                                  31\n\n\ndata would otherwise have been difficult to understand, Smyth\n\nwas \"translating\" public record technical data relating to the\n\nsite, not confidential communications from the client.    The\n\npurpose of the derivative attorney-client privilege is to\n\nmaintain the privilege for communications between the attorney\n\nand the client in circumstances where a third party's presence\n\nwould otherwise constitute a waiver of the privilege, and that\n\npurpose would not be fulfilled by shielding Smyth's analysis of\n\ntechnical data from disclosure.   See Comcast, 453 Mass. at 307-\n\n310, and cases cited (reviewing Federal cases rejecting claim\n\nthat similar communications from outside experts retained by\n\nclient's attorney are within derivative attorney-client\n\nprivilege).   Consequently, if the TRC work product is to be\n\nshielded from disclosure, that shield must rest on the work\n\nproduct doctrine, not the derivative attorney-client privilege.18\n\n     Conclusion.   For the reasons stated above, we vacate the\n\njudge's order allowing the third-party defendants' motion to\n\ncompel production of the work product at issue in this case, and\n\nremand the matter to the motion judge so that he may determine\n\n\n     18\n       Because we conclude that the TRC work product is not\nprivileged, we need not address the third-party defendants'\nadditional claim that the city waived its right to assert the\nprivilege by failing to take reasonable steps to maintain the\nconfidentiality of the TRC work product after it had been\ninadvertently produced by TRC in February, 2013, in response to\na keeper of records subpoena served on TRC by third-party\ndefendants.\n\f                                                                  32\n\n\nwhether the work product, in whole or in part, is protected from\n\ndisclosure under the act because it is exempted from the\n\ndefinition of \"public records,\" under G. L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-\n\nsixth (d).   Any work product that is a \"public record\" because\n\nit does not fall within exemption (d) (or any other exemption)\n\nshall be ordered to be produced in discovery by the city.    If\n\nany work product is not a \"public record\" because it falls\n\nwithin exemption (d) (or any another exemption), the work\n\nproduct may not be ordered to be produced in discovery unless\n\nthe third-party defendants have made the required showing of\n\nneed to justify disclosure of this work product under Mass. R.\n\nCiv. P. 26 (b) (3).\n\n                                    So ordered.\n\f",

See id. at 801-806.   In General Electric, the\n\nparties were not yet in litigation, so the work product was\n\nsought under the public records act rather than in discovery.\n\nAnd in General Electric we did not reach the issue whether the\n\f                                                                     3\n\n\nwork product would be protected from disclosure under the\n\n\"policy deliberation\" exemption, G.

Here, the parties are in\n\nlitigation, and the work product in the possession of the city\n\nof New Bedford (city) was sought in discovery.   We now revisit\n\nour holding in General Electric and explore the scope of the\n\n\"policy deliberation\" exemption in the context of work product\n\nsought in discovery from a municipality during litigation.      We\n\nconclude that \"opinion\" work product that, as codified in Mass.\n\nR. Civ.

L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth.   We also\n\nconclude that \"fact\" work product under Mass. R. Civ. P. 26 (b)\n\n(3) that was prepared in anticipation of litigation or trial\n\nfalls within the scope of exemption (d), and therefore falls\n\noutside the definition of \"public records,\" where it is not a\n\nreasonably completed study or report or, if it is reasonably\n\ncompleted, where it is interwoven with opinions or analysis\n\nleading to opinions.   Where work product is exempted from\n\ndisclosure under the public records act, it is protected from\n\f                                                                   4\n\n\ndisclosure in discovery to the extent provided by Mass. R. Civ.\n\nP. 26.3\n\n     Background.   The case underlying this appeal concerns\n\nliability for the costs of environmental cleanup of widespread\n\nsoil contamination at and around a site that the city allegedly\n\noperated until the 1970s as an unrestricted ash dump for\n\nindustrial and other waste (site).   In October, 2008, property\n\nowners from a neighborhood around the site filed a civil action\n\nin the Superior Court against the city bringing common-law\n\nclaims and a claim under G. L. c. 21E4 seeking damages arising\n\nfrom the soil contamination.   In December, 2009, the city filed\n\na third-party complaint alleging common-law claims and cost\n\nrecovery claims under G. L. c. 21E against various third-party\n\ndefendants.   After the original complaint was filed and before\n\nthe city filed its third-party complaint, the city solicitor, on\n\n\n     3\n       We acknowledge the amicus briefs submitted by the\nCommonwealth and by the Massachusetts Municipal Association.\n     4\n       G. L. c. 21E, the so-called Massachusetts \"Superfund\" law,\nprovides, in relevant part, that \"any person who . . . caused or\nis legally responsible for a release or threat of release of oil\nor hazardous material from a . . . site\" -- including \"any\nperson who at the time of storage or disposal of any hazardous\nmaterial owned or operated\" the site, and \"any person who . . .\narranged for the transport, disposal, storage or treatment of\nhazardous material to\" the site -- is (subject to statutory\nexceptions) strictly liable, jointly and severally, \"to the\ncommonwealth for all costs of assessment, containment and\nremoval,\" and \"to any person for damage to his real or personal\nproperty incurred or suffered as a result of such release or\nthreat of release.\" G. L. c. 21E, § 5 (a).\n\f                                                                   5\n\n\nbehalf of the city, retained Andrew Smyth, a consultant at TRC\n\nEnvironmental Corporation (TRC), to evaluate the issues related\n\nto the claims in the civil action and to identify sources of the\n\ncontamination that may be legally responsible to pay for the\n\ncleanup.5   Smyth provided his services directly to the city\n\nsolicitor in connection with the litigation pending against the\n\ncity.6\n\n     During the course of discovery, various third-party\n\ndefendants moved to strike the city's privilege and work product\n\nobjections to TRC documents and to compel their production.7   The\n\nthird-party defendants asked, as part of the relief requested,\n\nthat the city be compelled to produce documents that Smyth had\n\nprepared for the city, including two letters to the city\n\nsolicitor and a fifty-two-page \"evaluation report,\" described as\n\n\n     5\n       In the course of conducting response actions at the site\nof the contamination pursuant to G. L. c. 21E and 310 Code Mass.\nRegs. §§ 40.0000, the city of New Bedford (city) retained other\nconsultants as \"Licensed Site Professionals\" for the site. The\ncity represents that the data and records of all licensed site\nprofessionals it retained in connection with the contaminated\nsite, as well as the data and records that Andrew Smyth\nevaluated for the city solicitor, were made available during\ndiscovery to all parties involved in the present litigation.\n     6\n       After the city retained outside legal counsel later in\n2009, Smyth provided his services directly to outside counsel.\n     7\n       The motion was brought by third-party defendants Monsanto\nCompany, Pharmacia Corporation, and Solutia, Inc., and was\njoined by AVX. The motion was pursued by AVX after the three\nthird-party defendants who originally brought the motion were\ndismissed from the case.\n\f                                                                    6\n\n\na draft, regarding the sources and occurrence of soil\n\ncontamination in the relevant area of the city (collectively,\n\nTRC work product).   The city responded that the TRC work product\n\nwas protected from discovery by the attorney-client privilege\n\nand the work product doctrine.   The motion judge rejected the\n\ncity's claim of attorney-client privilege.   The judge also\n\nrejected the city's contention that the documents were protected\n\nfrom disclosure under the work product doctrine codified in\n\nMass. R. Civ. P. 26 (b) (3), even though he found that the\n\ndocuments contained \"information which was intended to assist\n\nthe city solicitor in advising the [c]ity as to the potential\n\nlitigation.\"   Citing General Electric, the judge concluded that\n\nthe TRC work product, having been received by the city\n\nsolicitor, constituted \"public records\" as defined in G. L.\n\nc. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth, and therefore was subject to discovery\n\nunless it fit \"within an enumerated exception.\"   Because there\n\nis no enumerated exception for work product, and because the\n\ndocuments were not protected by the attorney-client privilege,\n\nthe judge allowed the third-party defendants' motion, and\n\nordered that the work product be produced.   The judge noted that\n\n\"but for the public records law, said materials would clearly\n\nconstitute attorney work product, and would be subject to a\n\nheightened standard for disclosure as codified in Mass. R. Civ.\n\nP. 26 (b) (3).\"\n\f                                                                      7\n\n\n    Following the ruling, the city moved for a protective order\n\nto preclude the third-party defendants from inquiring into the\n\nTRC work product at a deposition.    The judge construed the\n\nmotion as seeking a stay of the court's order, and allowed the\n\nmotion to give the city an opportunity to file an interlocutory\n\nappeal.    The city petitioned a single justice of the Appeals\n\nCourt for interlocutory review, and the single justice allowed\n\nthe petition and reported it to a full panel of the Appeals\n\nCourt.    We granted direct appellate review.\n\n    On appeal, the city claims that the court should exercise\n\nits inherent authority to rule that the TRC work product, even\n\nif it consists of \"public records,\" should be protected from\n\ndiscovery during pending litigation by the work product doctrine\n\ncodified in Mass. R. Civ. P. 26 (b) (3).       The city also argues\n\nthat these documents are not \"public records\" because they are\n\nprotected from public disclosure by the \"policy deliberation\"\n\nexemption in G. L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth (d).       Finally, the\n\ncity argues that the TRC work product is protected from\n\ndisclosure by the so-called derivative attorney-client\n\nprivilege.\n\n    Discussion.     1.   Work product.    We begin our analysis by\n\ndiscussing the public records law.       Under the public records\n\nact, G. L. c. 66, § 10 (act), \"Every person having custody of\n\nany public record, as defined in [G. L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-\n\f                                                                   8\n\n\nsixth], shall, . . . without unreasonable delay, permit it, or\n\nany segregable portion of a record which is an independent\n\npublic record, to be inspected and examined by any person\n\n. . . .\"   G. L. c. 66, § 10 (a).   \"Public records,\" as defined\n\nin G. L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth, includes \"all . . .\n\ndocumentary materials or data . . .    made or received by any\n\nofficer or employee\" of any agency, office, or authority of\n\nState or local government, unless such records fall within one\n\nof twenty exemptions.   Exemption (d), the so-called \"policy\n\ndeliberation\" exemption, protects from public disclosure \"inter-\n\nagency or intra-agency memoranda or letters relating to policy\n\npositions being developed by the agency; but . . . shall not\n\napply to reasonably completed factual studies or reports on\n\nwhich the development of such policy positions has been or may\n\nbe based.\"   G. L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth (d).\n\n    In General Electric, 429 Mass. at 799, we \"consider[ed]\n\n. . . whether a governmental entity subject to the [act] . . .\n\nmay withhold from public disclosure documents and other records\n\non the basis of an implied exemption for materials covered by\n\nthe work product doctrine.\"   When the Department of\n\nEnvironmental Protection (DEP) withheld a set of documents in\n\nresponse to a public records request, General Electric commenced\n\nan action in the Superior Court under G. L. c. 66, § 10 (b),\n\nseeking disclosure of the withheld documents, and the parties\n\f                                                                     9\n\n\nfiled cross motions for summary judgment.    See id. at 799-800.\n\nThe judge allowed DEP's motion, \"concluding that because the\n\n[act] should not be read as an implicit legislative abrogation\n\nof well-established legal doctrines, work product enjoys an\n\nimplied exemption from disclosure under the statute.\"       Id. at\n\n800-801.    We disagreed, concluding that work product as defined\n\nin Mass. R. Civ. P. 26 (b) (3) is \"not protected from disclosure\n\nunder the [act] unless those materials fall within the scope of\n\nan express statutory exemption.\"    Id. at 801.\n\n    In support of this conclusion, we noted the broad scope of\n\nthe act and its definition of \"public records.\"    See id.     We\n\nalso noted that the act specifically declares that, in any court\n\nproceeding challenging the withholding of a requested document,\n\n\"there shall be a presumption that the record sought is public,\n\nand the burden shall be upon the custodian to prove with\n\nspecificity the exemption which applies.\"    G. L. c. 66,\n\n§ 10 (c).   See General Electric, 429 Mass. at 801.   We\n\ndetermined that \"the statute's clear and unambiguous language\n\nmandates disclosure of requested public records limited only by\n\nthe definition of public record found in G. L. c. 4, § 7,\n\nTwenty-sixth.\"   Id. at 802.   In short, we determined that the\n\f                                                                  10\n\n\nonly exemptions in the act are those identified in the act, and\n\nrefused to imply any exemption from disclosure.8\n\n     We further noted that the act was modeled on the Federal\n\nFreedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552 (2012) (FOIA), which\n\ncontains an exemption protecting from disclosure \"inter-agency\n\nor intra-agency memorand[a] or letters which would not be\n\navailable by law to a party other than an agency in litigation\n\nwith the agency.\"   5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5).   See General Electric,\n\n429 Mass. at 803-804.   The comparable exemption in the act,\n\nexemption (d), excluded from public disclosure \"inter-agency or\n\nintra-agency memoranda or letters relating to policy positions\n\nbeing developed by the agency,\" and does not expressly exclude\n\ninternal memoranda or letters that would not be available to a\n\nparty in litigation with the agency.   G. L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-\n\n\n     8\n       Apart from the \"clear and unambiguous language\" of the\npublic records act (act), we concluded that the Legislature did\nnot intend to include an implied exemption for work product\nbecause an exemption (k) that had been included in the bill that\nbecame the act when the bill was originally passed by the House\nof Representatives was excluded from the bill subsequently\nrecommended by the conference committee and was not ultimately\nenacted.

We did not address the\n\nscope of this exemption, or whether it may protect from\n\ndisclosure all or some of the documents that had been withheld\n\nunder the common-law work product doctrine.\n\n    Today, we revisit the reasoning and holding in General\n\nElectric.    We note that this appeal comes to us in a different\n\nposture from General Electric, in that it is not an appeal under\n\nthe act from a judge's decision regarding a public records\n\nrequest, but rather an interlocutory appeal from a judge's\n\f                                                                  12\n\n\nallowance of discovery of work product in a pending lawsuit.9   We\n\nalso note that the judge appeared to understand General Electric\n\nto hold that work product otherwise protected from disclosure in\n\nlitigation under Mass.

The judge's decision\n\ndid not address whether the reports at issue fall within\n\nexemption (d) of the act and for that reason are not public\n\nrecords under the act.\n\n     We no longer hold to the view declared in General Electric\n\nthat there are no implied exemptions to the public records act,\n\nand that all records in the possession of a governmental entity\n\n     9\n       AVX did additionally file a public records request with\nthe city solicitor's office seeking access to \"correspondence\nand evaluative material created by TRC Companies, Inc.\" The\ncity solicitor denied AVX's request, and -- instead of\nchallenging the denial by bringing a civil action against the\ncity solicitor pursuant to G. L. c. 66, § 10 (b) -- AVX filed an\nadministrative appeal with the supervisor of public records\n(supervisor), also pursuant to G. L. c. 66, § 10 (b). After we\nhad taken the city's appeal in this case under advisement, the\nsupervisor issued a letter ruling in which the city was \"ordered\nto provide all responsive records to [AVX] in a manner\nconsistent with this order.\" Letter Determination of the\nSupervisor of Public Records, SPR 14/766, Mar. 10, 2015, at 4.\nThe supervisor found that the city had \"failed to meet its\nburden in withholding the responsive records pursuant to\n[e]xemption (d),\" because its response did \"not contain the\nspecificity required for the denial of access to public\nrecords.\" Id. at 2. The supervisor also found that the city\n\"had failed to meet[] its burden of specificity to show the\n[attorney-client] privilege exists.\" Id. at 3. After the\nsupervisor issued this decision, the city requested that the\ndecision be withdrawn pending resolution of the city's appeal to\nthis court and, in the alternative, requested that the\nsupervisor reconsider her decision and schedule a hearing on the\nmatter. The supervisor has yet to rule on the city's request.\n\f                                                                     13\n\n\nmust be disclosed under the act unless they fall within one of\n\nthe exemptions identified in G.

We declared that \"the\n\nattorney-client privilege is a fundamental component of the\n\nadministration of justice,\" and that withdrawal of the privilege\n\nis \"not required by the plain terms of the public records law\"\n\nand would \"severely inhibit the ability of government officials\n\nto obtain quality legal advice essential to the faithful\n\ndischarge of their duties, place public entities at an unfair\n\ndisadvantage vis-à-vis private parties with whom they transact\n\nbusiness and for whom the attorney-client privilege is all but\n\ninviolable, and impede the public's strong interest in the fair\n\nand effective administration of justice.\"   Id. at 446.\n\n    Later, in Commonwealth v.

In response to the argument that such records,\n\nonce received by the Attorney General, were not excluded from\n\f                                                                     14\n\n\nthe act by any exemption, we stated that the argument was \"based\n\non the mistaken premise that all documents in the hands of\n\npublic officials must, absent an applicable exception, be made\n\npublic notwithstanding a court order prohibiting their\n\ncirculation.\"   Id. at 215.   We noted that the issuance of such\n\nprotective orders is among the \"inherent powers\" of a court, and\n\nthat such orders \"serve to shield litigants and third parties\n\nfrom unwarranted disclosures, and, as a practical matter, to\n\nfacilitate the discovery necessary for a trial.\"     Id. at 213-\n\n214.    We also noted that the act \"is silent on the issue of\n\nprotective orders,\" and that, \"as a matter of statutory\n\nconstruction,\" we did not believe that \"the Legislature would\n\nendeavor to effect such a significant change to a long-standing\n\nand fundamental power of the judiciary by implication.\"     Id. at\n\n215.    In essence, we declared an implied exemption for records\n\nwhose disclosure is limited by a court's protective order.\n\n       Before considering whether an implied exemption for work\n\nproduct otherwise protected in discovery under Mass. R. Civ. P.\n\n26 (b) (3) might be necessary to preserve the fair\n\nadministration of justice, we consider whether some or all such\n\nwork product might be protected from disclosure under the act by\n\nthe \"policy deliberation\" exemption in Twenty-sixth (d).10      We\n\n\n       10\n       The third-party defendants claim that the city waived its\nright to argue on appeal that the work product at issue in this\n\f                                                                   15\n\n\nreject the suggestion that the Legislature, in crafting the\n\nexemptions under the act, intended that all such work product\n\nwould be public records under the act and therefore would be\n\navailable to the public upon request.    In General Electric, we\n\nconcluded that the Legislature did not intend a separate,\n\nimplied exemption for work product; we did not conclude that all\n\nwork product would be outside the scope of other express\n\nexemptions.   In fact, we specifically affirmed \"that part of the\n\njudgment declaring that [DEP] 'may withhold documents requested\n\nunder G. L. c. 66, § 10 . . . if they meet the requirements of\n\nG.

We reject this claim where, at the hearing\non the motion, the city solicitor stated that \"the reference in\n[General Electric] to noted exemptions . . . would apply to work\nconducted in anticipation of litigation,\" and, at the hearing on\nthe city's subsequent motion for a protective order, the judge\ndeclared that he had considered the \"deliberative process\nexemption\" in allowing the third-party defendants' motion.\n     11\n       In General Electric, where the Department of\nEnvironmental Protection (DEP) had shared documents with the\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency \"as part of\ncoordinated investigative or remedial efforts,\" we held that DEP\nwas \"entitled to assert protection of the shared materials under\nexemption (d)\" even though exemption (d) only protects \"inter-\nagency or intra-agency\" documents, and the public records\nstatute defines \"agency\" to mean \"agency of the commonwealth\"\nand does not expressly include Federal agencies within the scope\nof that definition.

The Court quoted the following passage from the\n\nreport of the Senate committee that drafted the legislation:\n\n    \"It was pointed out in the comments of many of the agencies\n    that it would be impossible to have any frank discussion of\n    legal or policy matters in writing if all such writings\n    were to be subjected to public scrutiny. It was argued,\n    and with merit, that efficiency of Government would be\n    greatly hampered if, with respect to legal and policy\n    matters, all Government agencies were prematurely forced to\n    'operate in a fishbowl.' The committee is convinced of the\n    merits of this general proposition, but it has attempted to\n    delimit the exception as narrowly as consistent with\n    efficient Government operation.\"\n\nMink, supra at 87, quoting S. Rep. No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st\n\nSess. 9 (1965).   The Court noted the difficulty of attempting to\n\nascertain in the absence of litigation whether documents would\n\nbe available in discovery, where \"we do not know whether the\n\nGovernment is to be treated as though it were a prosecutor, a\n\f                                                                  18\n\ncivil plaintiff, or a defendant.\"    Mink, supra at 86.   And,\n\ndistinguishing \"matters of law, policy, or opinion\" from \"purely\n\nfactual material,\" the Court stated, \"in the absence of a claim\n\nthat disclosure would jeopardize state secrets, . . .     memoranda\n\nconsisting only of compiled factual material or purely factual\n\nmaterial contained in deliberative memoranda and severable from\n\nits context would generally be available for discovery by\n\nprivate parties in litigation with the Government\" and would not\n\nbe protected by exemption (5) (citation omitted).    Id. at 87-89,\n\n91.\n\n      Later that year, when the Massachusetts Legislature was\n\ncrafting the act, it made clear from the language of\n\nexemption (d) that it protected documents \"relating to policy\n\npositions being developed by the agency,\" but did not protect\n\n\"reasonably completed factual studies or reports on which the\n\ndevelopment of such policy positions has been or may be based.\"\n\nG. L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth (d).   In short, although the\n\nlegislative history is silent on this point, the Legislature\n\navoided the difficulty of ascertaining in the absence of\n\nlitigation what might be discoverable by omitting the litigation\n\nlanguage in FOIA exemption (5), and the Legislature added\n\nlanguage clarifying the focus on the formulation of policy that\n\nwas only implied by the language in FOIA exemption (5), and\n\f                                                                  19\n\n\nexpressly incorporated the understanding stated in Mink\n\nregarding purely factual material.13\n\n     The word \"policy\" is not defined in the act, but we discern\n\nfrom the language of exemption (d) of the act and from the\n\nhistorical context of its enactment that the word was intended\n\nto be defined broadly to accomplish the purpose it shares with\n\nexemption (5) of FOIA:   the protection of open, frank inter-\n\nagency and intra-agency deliberations regarding government\n\ndecisions.14   Compare General Electric, 429 Mass. at 807 (\"The\n\npurpose of exemption [d] is to foster independent discussions\n\nbetween those responsible for a governmental decision in order\n\nto secure the quality of the decision\"), with National Labor\n\nRelations Bd. v.

We recognize that this might require the judge in\n\nthe underlying litigation to determine the scope of\n\nexemption (d) in resolving a discovery dispute, but a judge\n\nmight have been asked to make the same determination if a\n\nlitigant who made a public records act request appealed the\n\ndenial of that request by a custodian of public records under\n\nG.

The difference is that it would likely\n\ntake far longer to resolve the appeal of the public records\n\nrequest denial than it would to resolve a discovery dispute, and\n\nthe appeal might not be decided before the underlying litigation\n\nis concluded.   Where work product is protected from disclosure\n\nunder the act by exemption (d), it must be treated like any\n\nother work product under rule 26 (b) (3), and would be subject\n\nto disclosure only upon the showing of need set forth in that\n\nrule.\n\n    In the case on appeal, the judge concluded that the\n\ndocuments at issue \"clearly constitute attorney work product\"\n\nunder rule 26 (b) (3), and would be \"public records\" unless they\n\nfit within one of the enumerated exemptions, but did not address\n\f                                                                    27\n\n\nwhether the work product is protected from disclosure by\n\nexemption (d).

Derivative attorney-client privilege.   We also consider\n\nthe city's argument that, regardless whether the documents are\n\nprotected from disclosure by exemption (d), they are protected\n\nfrom disclosure under the derivative attorney-client privilege\n\nbecause Smyth \"translated\" for the city solicitor \"technical\n\ninformation contained in laboratory data and field observations\"\n\nrelating to the site, and such assistance was necessary for the\n\ncity solicitor to provide legal advice to the city.

See Comcast, 453 Mass. at 303 (indorsing\n\nWigmore's \"classic formulation\" of attorney-client privilege).\n\nHowever, we have recognized that the derivative attorney-client\n\nprivilege \"can shield communications of a third party employed\n\nto facilitate communication between the attorney and client and\n\nthereby assist the attorney in rendering legal advice to the\n\nclient.\"    Id. at 306, citing United States v.

The privilege\n\ndoes not apply simply because \"an attorney's ability to\n\nrepresent a client is improved, even substantially, by the\n\nassistance\" of an expert.   Comcast, supra.   In short, the\n\nderivative attorney-client privilege protects otherwise\n\nprivileged communications between an attorney and client despite\n\nthe presence of a third party where, without the assistance of\n\nthe third party, what the client says would be \"Greek\" to the\n\nattorney, either because the client is actually speaking in\n\nGreek or because the information provided by the client is so\n\ntechnical in nature that it might as well be spoken in Greek if\n\nthere were not an expert to interpret it for the attorney.     See\n\nid. at 306 (derivative privilege is exception to rule that\n\n\"[d]isclosing attorney-client communications to a third party\n\n. . . undermines the privilege\").\n\n    The communications at issue fail to meet this test.       Even\n\nif Smyth's analysis were critical to the city solicitor's\n\nability to effectively represent the city because the technical\n\f                                                                  31\n\n\ndata would otherwise have been difficult to understand, Smyth\n\nwas \"translating\" public record technical data relating to the\n\nsite, not confidential communications from the client.    The\n\npurpose of the derivative attorney-client privilege is to\n\nmaintain the privilege for communications between the attorney\n\nand the client in circumstances where a third party's presence\n\nwould otherwise constitute a waiver of the privilege, and that\n\npurpose would not be fulfilled by shielding Smyth's analysis of\n\ntechnical data from disclosure.   See Comcast, 453 Mass. at 307-\n\n310, and cases cited (reviewing Federal cases rejecting claim\n\nthat similar communications from outside experts retained by\n\nclient's attorney are within derivative attorney-client\n\nprivilege).   Consequently, if the TRC work product is to be\n\nshielded from disclosure, that shield must rest on the work\n\nproduct doctrine, not the derivative attorney-client privilege.18\n\n     Conclusion.   For the reasons stated above, we vacate the\n\njudge's order allowing the third-party defendants' motion to\n\ncompel production of the work product at issue in this case, and\n\nremand the matter to the motion judge so that he may determine\n\n\n     18\n       Because we conclude that the TRC work product is not\nprivileged, we need not address the third-party defendants'\nadditional claim that the city waived its right to assert the\nprivilege by failing to take reasonable steps to maintain the\nconfidentiality of the TRC work product after it had been\ninadvertently produced by TRC in February, 2013, in response to\na keeper of records subpoena served on TRC by third-party\ndefendants.\n\f                                                                  32\n\n\nwhether the work product, in whole or in part, is protected from\n\ndisclosure under the act because it is exempted from the\n\ndefinition of \"public records,\" under G.
