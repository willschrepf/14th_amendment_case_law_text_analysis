This is a direct appeal from a jury conviction for: (1)\n\nkidnapping resulting in the death of the victim, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1201(a); (2) carrying and\n\nusing a firearm during and in relation to kidnapping, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c); and (3)\n\nattempted escape, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 751(a). The defendant-appellant, Shannon Shields,\n\nreceived a sentence of life imprisonment for the kidnapping charge, ten consecutive years of\n\nincarceration for the firearms charge, and five consecutive years of incarceration for the escape\n\ncharge. A prior adjudication that determined Defendant to be mentally retarded rendered him\n\nineligible to receive the death penalty. Defendant appeals the jury’s verdict and his sentences on\n\nseveral grounds: (1) that there is insufficient evidence to sustain Defendant’s convictions for the\n\nkidnapping and firearms charges; (2) that the District Court improperly admitted certain testimony\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nand otherwise denied Defendant a fair trial; (3) that the District Court erred in denying Defendant’s\n\nmotion to suppress incriminating, post-arrest recorded statements that he made to the police; and (4)\n\nthat Defendant’s sentence of life imprisonment for the kidnapping charge, imposed pursuant to a\n\nstatutorily mandated minimum sentence, is disproportionate to his level of culpability and therefore\n\nviolates the Eighth Amendment’s bar against cruel and unusual punishment. These claims of error\n\nare insubstantial. The evidence against Defendant is very strong.\n\n                                          I. Background\n\n       The pertinent facts are as follows. On the evening of May 19, 2004, Defendant and his\n\ncousin, Sonny Shields, carjacked and abducted Jerrell Lott at the Corner Grocery Store in Memphis,\n\nTennessee. In addition to surveillance camera footage confirming that Defendant and Sonny Shields\n\napproached Lott’s car (a silver 1994 Mitsubishi Diamante) on that evening, there was one eyewitness\n\nto the crime itself, a thirteen year-old boy named Tony Tapplin. At trial, Tapplin testified that he\n\nsaw two men approach Lott’s car once Lott, whom Tapplin recognized as his neighbor, had left the\n\nstore and gotten back inside the vehicle. According to Tapplin, the men spoke briefly with Lott, at\n\nwhich point one of the men pulled out a gun and pointed it at Lott while the other ran around to the\n\npassenger side and demanded that Lott unlock the car and let him inside. Lott complied. Tapplin\n\nfurther testified that the man holding the gun then jumped into the backseat, and that Lott drove away\n\nwhile the man held the gun to the back of his head. On May 25, six days after witnessing the\n\ncarjacking, Tapplin identified Sonny Shields from a police photo spread as the man who had pulled\n\nthe gun on Lott. However, Tapplin was unable to identify Sonny Shields a second time when police\n\n\n\n                                                 -2-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nshowed him a new photo spread on May 30, five days later, and he was never able to identify\n\nDefendant as the second perpetrator.\n\n         The testimony of other witnesses pieced together events subsequent to Lott’s carjacking and\n\nabduction and culminating in his murder. Soon after leaving the Corner Grocery, Defendant and\n\nSonny Shields pulled over, forced Lott to strip to his underwear, beat him, and locked him in the\n\ntrunk of his car. After locating Lott’s ATM card, Defendant and Sonny Shields then drove to a local\n\nbank and used the card to withdraw $800 in cash.1 Next, they drove across town to the house of\n\nSonny Shields’ friend, Lendzo Parker, at 917 Polk Street. Parker testified at trial as to the events that\n\noccurred at the Polk Street address. According to him, Defendant and Sonny Shields arrived at the\n\nhouse around midnight in a silver Mitsubishi Diamante. He further testified that Defendant, upon\n\nexiting the car, announced “I got a nigger in the trunk,” prompting Sonny Shields to explain to\n\nParker that he and Defendant had just robbed a man, that the man had seen their faces, and that they\n\nneeded Parker to help them get rid of the car. Parker agreed. Parker and two other witnesses who\n\nwere also present at the Polk Street address, Parker’s sister, Lauren Parker Turner, and Parker’s\n\nfriend, Kevin Jordan, testified that they also observed Defendant flashing a large wad of cash.\n\nJordan further testified that Defendant told him to stay away from the Diamante because it was “hot.”\n\nSometime thereafter, Defendant and Sonny Shields left 917 Polk Street in the Diamante, with Lott\n\nstill trapped in the trunk. Parker and Parker’s friend, James Stafford, followed behind in Parker’s\n\nHonda. Both Turner and Jordan witnessed and testified to the cars’ departure.\n\n\n        1\n         At trial, a records custodian for the bank testified that the bank’s ATM video camera captured an individual\nwithdrawing money from Lott’s bank account on the evening of May 19, 2004.\n\n                                                        -3-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\n       Parker’s trial testimony provides an account of what happened next. After departing from\n\n917 Polk Street, the four men crossed the Mississippi River into Arkansas before stopping at a gas\n\nstation to buy gas and a plastic gas can. Stafford filled up the latter with gas at the pump. The four\n\nmen then left the gas station and drove for some time before turning onto a secluded road, and\n\nfinally, parking on an adjoining unpaved field road. Once parked, Defendant and Sonny Shields\n\nexited the Diamante, opened the trunk, and directed Lott to get out. Lott begged for his life, to no\n\navail. When Lott attempted to run away, Sonny Shields drew his gun and fired at the fleeing figure.\n\nAt this point, Defendant grabbed the gun from Sonny, and exclaimed “You can’t do nothing right”\n\nbefore running after Lott, firing shots as he ran. Sonny Shields followed. Parker testified that,\n\nalthough the three men disappeared from his line of sight, he heard several more shots before\n\nDefendant and Sonny Shields returned to the parked cars. Sonny Shields, shoeless and carrying the\n\npistol, collected the gas can from Stafford and walked back across the field with Defendant to burn\n\nLott’s body. After some time, Defendant and Sonny Shields returned to the cars, and all four men\n\ndrove away.\n\n       On the road back to Memphis, the men stopped at a different gas station to refill the gas can.\n\nSonny Shields noticed that the gas cap was missing and grew concerned that he had accidentally left\n\nit behind. Consequently, all four men returned to the field and searched, unsuccessfully, for the\n\nerrant item. As they attempted to depart for the second time, both cars became stuck in the muddy\n\nfield, forcing the men to get out and push them free, muddying their clothes and shoes in the process.\n\nOnce back in Memphis, the men drove around looking for a place to burn Lott’s car. They\n\neventually stopped at a location near Hernando and Kerr streets, where Sonny Shields got out of the\n\n                                                 -4-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nDiamante and joined Parker and Stafford in the Honda. Defendant proceeded to burn the Diamante\n\nin a nearby field. The car exploded as it burned, injuring Defendant’s arms and face. He ran back\n\nto the others, yelling that he was hurt, and directed them to take him to his aunt’s house. Sonny\n\nShields, Parker, and Stafford complied and dropped Defendant off at his aunt’s address sometime\n\nbetween 3a.m. and 4a.m. on the morning of May 20. Defendant’s aunt, Stephanie Long, greeted him\n\nat the door and immediately noticed that he was muddy, burned, and reeking of gasoline. Defendant\n\ntold his aunt and his aunt’s husband, Tony Long, that he had been working on a car and had gotten\n\ninjured when the car’s battery caught fire. After changing clothes and shoes, Defendant asked his\n\naunt to drive him to a place where he could meet up with his girlfriend, Frenchetta Leavy. His aunt\n\nagreed, and Defendant and his aunt met Leavy in Grenada, Mississippi. Defendant told Leavy that\n\nhe’d injured himself in a barbecuing accident.2 Leavy then drove Defendant to a nearby hospital,\n\nwhere he checked in under the pseudonym “Willie Oliver.” He continued to use this false name\n\nwhen the hospital transferred him to a burn center in Greenville, Mississippi.\n\n         The Memphis Police Department became aware of Defendant’s involvement in Lott’s\n\nabduction and murder when Sonny Shields turned himself in to local investigators on the evening\n\nof May 21, 2004. By this point, the police investigation was already underway.3 Sonny Shields\n\nmade a number of inculpatory statements, but largely shifted the blame to Defendant. He also told\n\n\n         2\n             Once in custody, Defendant told Leavy that he had been present when Sonny Shields shot a man and that he’d\ngotten burned when he set someone’s car on fire.\n\n         3\n          Police officers had already found both Lott’s body and the charred Diamante, and local television stations had\nbegun airing the surveillance camera footage showing two men approaching Lott’s car in the Corner Grocery parking\nlot.\n\n                                                           -5-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nthe police where they could find Defendant. Consequently, the Sheriff’s Department in Washington\n\nCounty, Mississippi, took Defendant into custody on the evening of the same day. Three days later,\n\non May 24, Memphis police detectives Joseph Pearlman and Jasper Clay drove to Greenville, and,\n\npursuant to a federal warrant, interviewed Defendant as he waited in a holding cell prior to his initial\n\ncourt appearance. Pearlman and Clay advised Defendant of his Miranda rights, and he waived them\n\nboth orally and in a written statement. He thereafter made a tape-recorded statement that was self-\n\nserving but incriminating. Defendant admitted to being present throughout Lott’s carjacking,\n\nabduction, and murder, but placed primary blame on his cousin, just as Sonny Shields had done to\n\nhim. Defendant’s statement was admitted at trial, where the jury returned guilty verdicts on all three\n\ncounts of the indictment.\n\n                                           II. Discussion\n\n                                   1. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n        The evidence is clearly sufficient to support the jury’s verdict. Defendant first asserts that\n\nthe government failed to adequately link him to Lott’s kidnapping because the only non-accomplice\n\neyewitness to the crime, thirteen year-old Tapplin, was never able to identify Defendant as one of\n\nthe perpetrators. This argument ignores the Corner Grocery Store surveillance video showing\n\nDefendant and Sonny Shields approaching the location where Lott was sitting in his car on the\n\nevening of May 19, 2004. Tapplin, moreover, identified Sonny Shields in the first of two police\n\nphoto spreads as the man who held the gun.\n\n        Second, Defendant contends that Parker’s testimony was biased and that the jury should not\n\nhave credited it in light of the fact that Parker testified pursuant to a plea agreement under which he\n\n                                                  -6-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nwill receive a reduced sentence of twenty years imprisonment for the kidnapping charge and a\n\ndismissal of the firearms charge. The jury, however, knew of Parker’s plea agreement; it was their\n\nfunction to judge his credibility. Further, those portions of Parker’s testimony which connect\n\nDefendant to Lott’s stolen Mitsubishi Diamante, and to events that transpired at 917 Polk Street on\n\nthe night of Lott’s abduction, are strongly corroborated by the statements of other, non-accomplice\n\neyewitnesses. Defendant himself admitted – both to the police and to his girlfriend – that he was\n\npresent in the Arkansas field when, according to Defendant, Sonny Shields shot and killed Lott.4\n\nThus, even conceding the possibility that Defendant may never have pulled the trigger, there was\n\nample evidence to convince a rational trier of fact that Defendant was guilty of the charged offenses.\n\nSee U.S. v. Henderson, 626 F.3d 326, 341 (6th Cir. 2010).\n\n                          2. Prejudicial Effect of Various District Court Rulings\n\n         Defendant next asserts that the District Court made a variety of rulings that unfairly\n\nprejudiced the jury against him. These include: (1) improperly allowing expert opinion testimony\n\nfrom a lay witness; (2) improperly allowing testimony regarding Defendant’s medical treatment and\n\nuse of a pseudonym to obtain such treatment; (3) refusing to permit Defendant to appear at trial in\n\nstreet clothes instead of prison garb; and (4) failing to sever Defendant’s charge for escape from the\n\nkidnapping and firearms charges.\n\n\n\n\n        4\n           Defendant also argues on appeal that his statement to the police should have been suppressed. This assertion\nis addressed, and dismissed, later in the opinion.\n\n                                                         -7-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\n                                      (a) Evidentiary Rulings\n\n       Defendant contends that the District Court wrongly permitted Dale Arnold of the Arkansas\n\nState Police to highlight for the jury “what appeared to be similarities” between the tread on\n\nDefendant’s muddy shoes and a photograph of the shoe prints found near Lott’s body, despite\n\nlacking “specialized training in footprint or shoe identification.” (Appellant’s Brief at 29.) This\n\nargument lacks merit. It is true that Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence prohibits any witness\n\nfrom providing opinion testimony based on scientific, technical, or other specialized areas of\n\nknowledge unless that witness first qualifies as an expert. SeeFED . R. EVID . 702. However, Rule\n\n701 supplies an important corollary: a witness may nonetheless offer lay opinion testimony that is\n\nrationally based on the witness’s perception, or that will help the jury understand the testimony or\n\ndetermine a fact in issue, so long as it is not otherwise restricted by Rule 702. See id. 701.\n\n       Arnold’s testimony fits squarely within the limitations contemplated by Rule 701. First,\n\nArnold led the police discovery of Lott’s body and thus had sufficient personal knowledge to testify\n\nabout whether the prints in the field were similar to the tread on Defendant’s shoes. And second,\n\nthe jury benefitted from Arnold’s testimony in light of the fact that Arnold had enjoyed significantly\n\nmore time to study and compare the evidence. See U.S. v. Zepeda-Lopez, 478 F.3d 1213, 1222 (10th\n\nCir. 2007). The District Court did not err by admitting it.\n\n       Defendant also asserts that the District Court improperly admitted testimony regarding\n\nDefendant’s medical treatment in Mississippi, including his use of the pseudonym “Willie Oliver”\n\nto obtain such treatment. Defendant maintains that this evidence lacked probative value, as it\n\noccurred after the crime was completed, and that it unfairly prejudiced the jury against him. We\n\n                                                 -8-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\ndisagree. The mere fact that evidence relates to activities committed after completion of a crime\n\ndoes not render it inadmissible. Rather, it is elementary that post-crime evidence is admissible when\n\nit tends to show consciousness of guilt and is not unfairly prejudicial. See e.g., U.S. v. Cody, 498\n\nF.3d 582, 591-92 (6th Cir. 2006). In this case, evidence that Defendant sought medical treatment\n\nwell over one hundred miles from Memphis, and under a false name, tended to prove that Defendant\n\nhoped to avoid apprehension for his crimes. Further, evidence relating to the treatment itself tended\n\nto link Defendant, through his injuries, to the burning of Lott’s car.\n\n              (b) Denial of Defendant’s Request to Appear in Street Clothes at Trial\n\n        Defendant next contends that the District Court denied him a fair trial by refusing his request\n\nto stand before the jury in street clothing. Although it is well-established that a trial court cannot\n\nforce a criminal defendant to appear before the jury in prison garb, no compulsion was present in this\n\ncase. See Estelle v. Williams, 425 U.S. 501, 504-05 (1970); U.S. v. Brown, 367 F.3d 549, 553-54\n\n(6th Cir. 2004). To the contrary, Defendant strategically chose to appear in prison clothes, only\n\nchanging his mind the first morning of trial. And while Defendant did at this point object to\n\nappearing before the jury in an orange jumpsuit, the District Court made all reasonable efforts, short\n\nof delaying trial, to accommodate him. Echoing Brown, this Court recently held that a trial court is\n\nnot required to either furnish alternate clothing for a defendant or else delay trial, so long as the court\n\nmakes clear that it would allow the defendant to change clothes if substitute attire could feasibly be\n\nmade available. See U.S. v. Williams, 641 F.3d 758, 767 (6th Cir. 2011) (citing Brown, 367 F.3d at\n\n554). The District Court clearly provided Defendant with an opportunity to change his clothes, even\n\nsuggesting that Defendant’s counsel borrow a jacket from a colleague on Defendant’s behalf. As\n\n                                                   -9-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nsuch, the District Court’s refusal to delay trial at the last minute did not amount to compelling\n\nDefendant to appear in prison clothes in violation of his constitutional rights.\n\n                      (c) Failure to Sever Escape Charge from Other Charges\n\n        Defendant also claims that the District Court prejudiced his defense by failing to sever his\n\ncharge for escape from the other charges against him. Because Defendant failed to renew his pretrial\n\nmotion to sever at the close of all the evidence, we review for plain error. See U.S. v. Walls, 293\n\nF.3d 959, 966 (6th Cir. 2002). Defendant concedes that the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\n\npermit the joinder of related offenses, but supports his argument by invoking a court’s discretionary\n\nability to sever certain offenses if it appears that prejudice would otherwise result. See FED . R. CRIM .\n\nP. 8(a), 14. Defendant, however, suffered no additional prejudice from a concurrent trial on all\n\ncharges. Evidence of his attempted escape would have been admissible circumstantially as tending\n\nto prove consciousness of guilt in a separate trial on the kidnapping and firearms charges. See U.S.\n\nv. Williams, 295 F.3d 817, 819 (8th Cir. 2002); U.S. v. Hankins, 931 F.2d 1256, 1261 (8th Cir.\n\n1991). Thus, as to the joinder of counts, the District Court committed no error, much less plain\n\nerror. See Williams, 295 F.3d at 819.\n\n                            3. Denial of Defendant’s Motion to Suppress\n\n        Prior to trial, Defendant moved to suppress the tape-recorded statement he gave to police on\n\nMay 24, 2004, on the ground that it was not voluntary, despite Defendant’s oral and written waiver\n\nof his Miranda rights. The District Court denied the motion and admitted the statement at trial.\n\nDefendant now contends, for the first time, that the District Court’s pretrial adjudication of his\n\nmental retardation, which rendered him ineligible to receive the death penalty, also invalidated his\n\n                                                  -10-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nwaiver of rights because it was not made knowingly and intelligently. Defendant also asserts that,\n\nbecause he is mentally retarded, his statement was the product of inherent police coercion.\n\nDefendant’s claim of ineffective waiver is a losing one because it both has no merit and was waived.\n\n         There is case law to support the proposition that diminished mental capacity can, by limiting\n\na defendant’s ability to understand the nature of his or her rights and the consequences of abandoning\n\nthem, contribute to a determination that a waiver was invalid. See U.S. v. Garibay, 143 F.3d 534,\n\n539 (9th Cir. 1998). But Defendant failed to raise this issue before the District Court, despite ample\n\nopportunity. Specifically, the chronology of events was such that Defendant, once adjudicated\n\nmentally retarded, could have filed a supplemental memorandum in support of his motion to\n\nsuppress that specifically addressed the question of whether he was capable of signing a knowing,\n\nintelligent, and voluntary waiver of his rights. He did not. Defendant also did not object at trial to\n\nthe admission of his statement on this basis.5 As a general rule, this Court refuses to consider an\n\nissue on appeal that a defendant did not first raise before the District Court, except in “‘exceptional\n\ncases or particular circumstances’” not present here. See U.S. v. Pickett, 941 F.2d 411, 415 (6th Cir.\n\n1991) (quoting Pinney Dock & Transp. Co. v. Penn Cent. Corp., 838 F.2d 1445, 1461) (6th Cir.\n\n1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 880 (1988)) (permitting appeal on the merits when both parties had\n\nextensively briefed the “wholly legal” issues at stake). Defendant has therefore waived his claim.\n\n         Further, even absent waiver, Defendant’s claim fails on the merits. In Garner v. Mitchell,\n\n557 F.3d 257, 264, 270-71 (6th Cir. 2009), this Court held that a defendant in the “‘borderline range\n\n\n        5\n            Defendant’s counsel objected to admission of the statement but on the basis that portions of it were\nunintelligible, thus calling into question the accuracy of the text which ran across the screen as an aid to listeners.\n\n                                                         -11-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nof intelligence’” who also suffered from a troubled upbringing and poor education knowingly,\n\nintelligently, and voluntarily waived his Miranda rights. Noting that “diminished mental capacity\n\nalone does not prevent a defendant from validly waiving his or her Miranda rights,” we reasoned that\n\nthis factor must instead “be viewed alongside other factors, including evidence of the defendant’s\n\nconduct during, and leading up to, the interrogation.” Id. at 264-65. In this case, the District Court\n\nfound that:\n\n       Defendant was alert and attentive and manifested no outward signs of being\n       incoherent or otherwise incapable of giving a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary\n       waiver of his rights. Using the term “Miranda” specifically, Defendant stated he\n       knew his rights and wanted to make a statement.\n\n       (Order Denying Defendant’s Motion to Suppress at 3.) Defendant’s cooperativeness and\n\ncoherency thus demonstrate that he grasped both the nature of the charges against him and the\n\nconsequences that could flow from his interactions with police to effectuate a knowing, intelligent,\n\nand voluntary waiver of his Miranda rights. See Garner, 557 F.3d at 265. Moreover, retarded or\n\nnot, he was capable of recounting facts he had experienced.\n\n                4. Imposition of Mandatory Life Sentence for Kidnapping Charge\n\n       Defendant’s final argument relies heavily on Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 321 (2002) to\n\nsupport the proposition that, because he is mentally retarded, his mandatory sentence of life\n\nimprisonment for kidnapping resulting in the death of the victim violates his Eighth Amendment\n\nprotection against cruel and unusual punishment. We review this constitutional challenge de novo.\n\nIn Atkins, the Supreme Court held that “death is not a suitable punishment for a mentally retarded\n\ncriminal.” 536 U.S. at 321. Indeed, Defendant was saved from the possibility of capital punishment\n\n\n                                                -12-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nby the District Court’s reliance on Atkins. Defendant now asks this Court to extend Atkins by\n\nholding that his sentence of life imprisonment, made mandatory by statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1201(a),\n\nsimilarly violates the Eighth Amendment because it fails to account for his inherently reduced\n\nculpability.\n\n        Atkins, however, has proven resistant to expansion beyond capital punishment. See U.S. v.\n\nTucker , 204 Fed. Appx. 518, 521-22 (6th Cir. 2006); U.S. v. Laffoon, 145 Fed. Appx. 964, 964 (5th\n\nCir. 2005). In Tucker, this Court explicitly held that “imposing a mandatory minimum sentence on\n\na defendant with limited mental capabilities does not violate the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel\n\nand unusual punishment.” 204 Fed. Appx. at 521. Because we do not agree with Defendant’s\n\nassertion that the distinction between capital and non-capital sentences is “artificial” when assessing\n\nproportionality, we follow the holding in that case. See id. The Supreme Court and other courts\n\nhave consistently recognized the crucial difference between capital and non-capital sentences. See\n\ne.g., Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957, 994 (1991) (reasoning that “proportionality review is one\n\nof several respects in which we have held that ‘death is different,’ and have imposed protections\n\nwhich the Constitution nowhere else provides”). As a matter of retributive justice, life imprisonment\n\nis not an unconstitutionally severe punishment for the crime of kidnapping and participating in the\n\nmurder of Lott.\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -13-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\n        CLAY, Circuit Judge, dissenting. I write separately because Shannon Shields, a mentally\n\nretarded defendant, suffered a serious injustice when the district court largely disregarded and\n\nminimized his mental status during the trial proceedings. As a result, Shields’ right to a fair and\n\nconstitutionally adequate trial was seriously compromised. I therefore respectfully dissent.\n\n        The kidnapping and murder of Jerrell Lott was a senseless and shocking crime. Soon after\n\napprehending Shannon Shields and his cousin, Sonny Shields, the government announced its\n\nintention to seek the death penalty against the two accused men. Shannon Shields then requested\n\na pretrial hearing to determine whether he was mentally retarded and thus ineligible to face the death\n\npenalty under Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 321 (2002).\n\n        The district court held an extensive eight-day evidentiary hearing on the matter. In the course\n\nof the hearing, the defense presented the expert testimony of two psychologists, as well as the lay\n\ntestimony of Shields’ parents, his sister, his longtime girlfriend, several of his former educators, and\n\na prison counselor. The government presented the competing expert testimony of two additional\n\npsychologists. After considering the evidence and post-hearing memoranda, the district court issued\n\na lengthy order finding Shields mentally retarded and thus ineligible to face the death penalty. (See\n\nRE 557, Order on Mental Retardation.)\n\n        The hearing produced ample evidence to conclude that Shields is mentally retarded. In five\n\nIQ tests administered over Shields’ lifetime, his scores ranged from 69 at the lowest to 73 at the\n\nhighest.1 Shields cannot live independently, and he does not work. He relies extensively on the\n\n\n       1\n       According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.–Text\nRevision) (“DSM-IV”), “significantly subaverage intellectual functioning” is defined as an IQ of 70\n\n                                                 -14-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nassistance of his parents and his girlfriend to complete common, everyday tasks. Shields cannot\n\nprepare his own food, follow a recipe, or shop for groceries. He cannot budget his own money, pay\n\nhis monthly bills, or master a checkbook. Concepts that are, to the normal-functioning person,\n\nsimple matters of common sense, are beyond Shields’ grasp. To cite but a few salient examples,\n\nShields does not understand the obligation to repay purchases made with a credit card. He does not\n\nsee the need for and lacks the follow-through to obtain an identification card. He does not grasp the\n\ndangers of leaving a hot iron unattended.\n\n       Shields is completely unable to set his own priorities, to self-direct, or to complete even the\n\nmost rudimentary tasks without the continual supervision and frequent reminders of a parent or other\n\nresponsible adult. Although Shields has worked for brief periods in several unskilled positions, such\n\nas a dishwasher and a furniture mover, he has never been able to maintain steady employment due\n\nto his innate mental limitations. His inability to follow directions or to work productively without\n\ncontinual direction has also hindered his job prospects. As a result of these limitations, Shields has\n\nreceived some form of social security disability assistance since his teenage years.\n\n       Shields’ mental limitations became manifest early in his childhood education. Without\n\nparental assistance, he struggled with grooming and personal hygiene, and he did not relate to his\n\nclassmates in “age-appropriate” ways. After a year in kindergarten, Shields was unable to even\n\nrecognize his own name in writing, let alone read or write it himself, despite his teacher’s personal\n\nefforts to help him master this simple goal. In later years, Shields was disallowed from riding the\n\n\n\nor below.\n\n                                                -15-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nschool bus because of his lack of independence and his frequent outbursts. In the classroom, Shields\n\nrequired constant individualized attention and instruction because he was unable to work\n\nindependently or to stay on task without a teacher’s direct supervision. Although Shields initially\n\nstarted on a mixed track of special education and regular classes, he struggled with the regular\n\ncurricula and fell appreciably behind his peer group. By the ninth grade, school administrators\n\ncompletely removed Shields from the regular classroom and placed him on track to receive a\n\n“certificate of attendance” rather than a high school diploma.            Shields’ special education\n\nprogramming did not teach mainstream educational curricula, but instead focused on functional\n\nskills, such as learning how to count money and how to write basic information, like his address and\n\nhis parents’ names. Ultimately, Shields dropped out of school entirely by the tenth grade.\n\n        Despite the extent of Shields’ mental deficiencies, his hindrances are not of the type that\n\nwould be readily apparent to the average observer. As an adult, Shields is now “careful about his\n\nappearance” and “tries to keep himself well-groomed.” He can speak well, and he possesses some\n\nlimited reading skills, although his comprehension is sub-average, and he “lack[s] the ability to\n\nengage in deep and meaningful conversation.” He is skilled at convincing others around him to\n\naccomplish tasks on his behalf, he ignores social strictures (for example, he drives although he has\n\nno license to do so), and he deceives others to achieve his personal objectives. Shields is often\n\ndeceptive and manipulative; however, his stratagems are “transparent” and “not well thought out.”\n\nShields is gullible, susceptible to the influence of his peers, and he seemingly lacks ambition or long-\n\nterm goals of his own. To quote the district court, Shields is an individual whose mental limitations\n\n\n\n                                                 -16-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nrender him “largely disconnected from the types of social responsibilities and tasks expected of\n\nregularly functioning adults in society.”\n\n         The district court deserves commendation for the attention it devoted to Shields’ mental\n\nretardation hearing and its evaluations of Shields’ eligibility for the death penalty. However, a\n\ndefendant is not mentally retarded for purposes of the death penalty alone. As with any factual\n\nfinding in a criminal proceeding, the district court’s rulings on mental retardation should have proven\n\nsalient throughout the remainder of Shields’ trial proceedings. Unfortunately, after making detailed\n\nfactual assessments about Shields’ mental limitations, the district court then inexplicably shelved\n\nthose facts and proceeded as though Shields’ innate limitations did not exist for the remainder of his\n\ntrial.\n\n         While defense counsel’s willingness to also ignore Shields’ mental retardation is\n\nincomprehensible, it is equally inexcusable for the district court to have set aside its own factual\n\nfindings for the remainder of the trial. Although the district court was not obligated to try defense\n\ncounsel’s case, the court was not relieved of its duty to avoid glaring errors or to make independent\n\ninquiries to ensure that Shields received his right to a fair trial.\n\n         Specifically, the district court should have considered Shields’ mental retardation when it\n\nruled on the motion to suppress. Shields freely admits that he received a Miranda warning and that\n\nhe waived his rights before he provided his recorded statement to police. See Miranda v. Arizona,\n\n384 U.S. 436, 444 (1966). However, for better or worse, Miranda’s now-familiar questions are an\n\nimperfect and approximate instrument for measuring the validity of a suspect’s waiver. Ultimately,\n\nwhether a suspect validly waived his rights depends not only on whether the Miranda warning was\n\n                                                  -17-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nproperly given, but also on whether the waiver of the suspect’s Miranda rights was made\n\n“voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently.” Id. at 444–45.\n\n        This fact-sensitive inquiry has two distinct dimensions. Moran v. Burbine, 475 U.S. 412, 421\n\n(1986) (citing Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U.S. 477, 482 (1981); Brewer v. Williams, 430 U.S. 387, 404\n\n(1977)). For a waiver to have been “voluntary,” it must have been “the product of a free and\n\ndeliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or deception.” Id. For the waiver to have been\n\nmade “knowingly and intelligently,” it must have been made “with a full awareness of both the\n\nnature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.” Id. “Only\n\nif the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation reveal both an uncoerced choice and\n\nthe requisite level of comprehension may a court properly conclude that the Miranda rights [were]\n\nwaived.” Id. (citing Fare v. Michael C., 442 U.S. 707, 725 (1979) (internal quotation marks and\n\nadditional citations omitted)).\n\n        Defense counsel only addressed the issue of voluntariness with respect to the Miranda\n\nwaiver, summarily arguing that Shields’ statement ought to be suppressed because “coercive police\n\nactivity overbore his will.” After considering the testimony of the interrogating officers, the district\n\ncourt disagreed with defense counsel’s argument. It would appear that the district court correctly\n\ndecided the issue of voluntariness, inasmuch as no evidence was elicited to suggest that the officers\n\ndeliberately intimidated, coerced, or deceived Shields into giving an involuntary statement. See\n\nGarner v. Mitchell, 557 F.3d 257, 274 (2009) (en banc) (Moore, J., dissenting).\n\n        However, the district court never reached the second part of the waiver inquiry. The court\n\nnever asked whether Shields—with all his innate mental deficiencies—possessed “the maturity,\n\n                                                 -18-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nintelligence, and competency to make a knowing and intelligent waiver.” Id. at 274. Despite the fact\n\nthat the district court’s own earlier, detailed ruling strongly cast doubt on that issue, the court simply\n\nignored Shields’ mental retardation and failed to take it into account for the purposes of the\n\nsuppression motion.\n\n        The government would have us fault defense counsel for this omission, arguing that Shields\n\nwaived the opportunity to raise the “knowing and intelligent” argument because counsel failed to\n\nmake that contention before the district court. If so, the government only highlights for our attention\n\na glaring ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\n\n        Regardless of what defense counsel did or did not argue, however, the district court’s inquiry\n\nshould not have ended with respect to the officer’s conduct. Id. at 275–76. The waiver inquiry\n\nencompasses two distinct parts, which work conjunctively, are therefore indivisible, and must both\n\nbe considered to determine whether a valid waiver was made. See id. at 275. Deciding the validity\n\nof a waiver based solely on police conduct, without regard for whether the defendant had the capacity\n\nto make a knowing and intelligent waiver, reads the second element out of the waiver inquiry, and\n\nis clearly out of line with established Supreme Court Miranda jurisprudence. Id. In any event, it is\n\nutterly perplexing that Shields’ mental retardation did not arise as a topic of concern during the\n\nsuppression hearing, whether spontaneously or by the court’s direction, given the obvious connection\n\nbetween Shields’ mental limitations and his capacity to make a knowing and intelligent waiver of\n\nhis Miranda rights.\n\n        As the majority correctly points out, finding a defendant mentally retarded does not preclude\n\nhim from validly waiving his Miranda rights. See Garner, 557 F.3d at 264–65 (Rogers, J., majority).\n\n                                                  -19-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nHowever, the waiver inquiry is always fact-sensitive and dependent on the totality of the\n\ncircumstances—even more so in a case like this one. Id. In this instance, the evidence indicates that\n\nShields lacks basic life skills, is easily manipulated, and operates largely outside the realm of\n\ncommon sense reasoning. Under such circumstances, Shields’ ability to mention Miranda by name\n\nis not necessarily indicative of his grasp of the charges against him or his understanding of the\n\nconsequences of waiving his rights.2 Unfortunately, this Court has no basis on which to evaluate\n\nShields’ capacity to make a valid waiver, because the district court failed to make the necessary and\n\nreasonable inquiries required to address the waiver issue.\n\n       The district court also should have taken Shields’ mental limitations into account when\n\nShields timely asked to wear street attire to his trial. Citing two prior cases from this Circuit, the\n\nmajority reasons that the district court was not obligated to significantly delay proceedings to\n\naccommodate Shields’ last-minute request. See United States v. Brown, 367 F.3d 549, 553–54 (6th\n\nCir. 2004); United States v. Williams, 641 F.3d 758, 767 (6th Cir. 2011). However, Brown and\n\nWilliams are clearly distinguishable from the case before us, because neither of those cases involved\n\na mentally retarded defendant.\n\n       By contrast, in this case the district court was thoroughly aware that Shields’ mental\n\nretardation may have rendered him slow to fully appreciate the nature and the seriousness of the\n\nproceedings, including the effects his prison clothes might have on the jury’s impartiality. Rather\n\n\n\n       2\n        Of course, these findings also bear directly on the central factual dispute raised by the\ndefense—whether it was Defendant’s cousin, Sonny Shields, who was primarily responsible for\norchestrating the kidnapping and ultimately murdering Jerrell Lott.\n\n                                                -20-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nthan accommodate Shields’ reasonable request, the district court instead offered the defense an even\n\nmore limited option than was granted by the courts in Brown and Williams. The district court’s\n\nproposed solution—that Shields wear a sport coat over his prison uniform—was really no solution\n\nat all. The court’s limited offer was insufficient to protect Shields’ right to an impartial jury,\n\nparticularly given that his request, though admittedly belated, was technically timely. Furthermore,\n\nthere was no substance to the district court’s contention that permitting a short recess to allow\n\nShields to change clothes would have significantly delayed the proceedings.\n\n        Finally, it is troubling that the escape charge was not severed from the rest of Shields’ trial.\n\nAt best, the evidence elicited on the escape count was minimal. Shields’ attempted “escape” was\n\nchildishly ill-planned and ill-thought out, which is perhaps unsurprising given his mental retardation.\n\nWhile awaiting trial on the kidnapping and murder charges, Shields was segregated in a high-security\n\nprison that allowed him one hour outdoors in an isolated pen housed within the prison’s recreation\n\nyard. Shields and a fellow inmate pried loose the wire fence of their segregation pens, but they were\n\nquickly apprehended clinging to the inner perimeter fence of the recreation yard. Even if Shields’\n\nineffective defense counsel unjustifiably waived its chance to request a severance of the escape\n\ncharge, its facts were obviously weak and entirely tertiary to the other issues at trial. The district\n\ncourt should have been more vigilant in protecting Shields against the inclusion of this wholly\n\nunrelated, but highly prejudicial charge. At a minimum, some inquiry by the district court with\n\nrespect to this issue would have been appropriate.\n\n        In any criminal trial, the presiding judge has an obligation to steward the proceedings in a\n\nmanner that takes into account the full range of facts before the court and that steers clear of obvious\n\n                                                  -21-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nviolations of the defendant’s constitutional rights. I cannot agree that Shields received this\n\nconsideration when the district court largely disregarded Shields’ mental deficiencies, shunted aside\n\nits own detailed factual findings with respect to Shields’ mental retardation, and failed to take into\n\naccount the obvious inadequacies of the ineffective assistance defense counsel provided to the\n\ndefendant. Accordingly, and for the reasons discussed above, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -22-\n\f",

This is a direct appeal from a jury conviction for: (1)\n\nkidnapping resulting in the death of the victim, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1201(a); (2) carrying and\n\nusing a firearm during and in relation to kidnapping, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c); and (3)\n\nattempted escape, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 751(a). The defendant-appellant, Shannon Shields,\n\nreceived a sentence of life imprisonment for the kidnapping charge, ten consecutive years of\n\nincarceration for the firearms charge, and five consecutive years of incarceration for the escape\n\ncharge. A prior adjudication that determined Defendant to be mentally retarded rendered him\n\nineligible to receive the death penalty. Defendant appeals the jury’s verdict and his sentences on\n\nseveral grounds: (1) that there is insufficient evidence to sustain Defendant’s convictions for the\n\nkidnapping and firearms charges; (2) that the District Court improperly admitted certain testimony\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nand otherwise denied Defendant a fair trial; (3) that the District Court erred in denying Defendant’s\n\nmotion to suppress incriminating, post-arrest recorded statements that he made to the police; and (4)\n\nthat Defendant’s sentence of life imprisonment for the kidnapping charge, imposed pursuant to a\n\nstatutorily mandated minimum sentence, is disproportionate to his level of culpability and therefore\n\nviolates the Eighth Amendment’s bar against cruel and unusual punishment. These claims of error\n\nare insubstantial. The evidence against Defendant is very strong.\n\n                                          I. Background\n\n       The pertinent facts are as follows. On the evening of May 19, 2004, Defendant and his\n\ncousin, Sonny Shields, carjacked and abducted Jerrell Lott at the Corner Grocery Store in Memphis,\n\nTennessee. In addition to surveillance camera footage confirming that Defendant and Sonny Shields\n\napproached Lott’s car (a silver 1994 Mitsubishi Diamante) on that evening, there was one eyewitness\n\nto the crime itself, a thirteen year-old boy named Tony Tapplin. At trial, Tapplin testified that he\n\nsaw two men approach Lott’s car once Lott, whom Tapplin recognized as his neighbor, had left the\n\nstore and gotten back inside the vehicle. According to Tapplin, the men spoke briefly with Lott, at\n\nwhich point one of the men pulled out a gun and pointed it at Lott while the other ran around to the\n\npassenger side and demanded that Lott unlock the car and let him inside. Lott complied. Tapplin\n\nfurther testified that the man holding the gun then jumped into the backseat, and that Lott drove away\n\nwhile the man held the gun to the back of his head. On May 25, six days after witnessing the\n\ncarjacking, Tapplin identified Sonny Shields from a police photo spread as the man who had pulled\n\nthe gun on Lott. However, Tapplin was unable to identify Sonny Shields a second time when police\n\n\n\n                                                 -2-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nshowed him a new photo spread on May 30, five days later, and he was never able to identify\n\nDefendant as the second perpetrator.\n\n         The testimony of other witnesses pieced together events subsequent to Lott’s carjacking and\n\nabduction and culminating in his murder. Soon after leaving the Corner Grocery, Defendant and\n\nSonny Shields pulled over, forced Lott to strip to his underwear, beat him, and locked him in the\n\ntrunk of his car. After locating Lott’s ATM card, Defendant and Sonny Shields then drove to a local\n\nbank and used the card to withdraw $800 in cash.1 Next, they drove across town to the house of\n\nSonny Shields’ friend, Lendzo Parker, at 917 Polk Street. Parker testified at trial as to the events that\n\noccurred at the Polk Street address. According to him, Defendant and Sonny Shields arrived at the\n\nhouse around midnight in a silver Mitsubishi Diamante. He further testified that Defendant, upon\n\nexiting the car, announced “I got a nigger in the trunk,” prompting Sonny Shields to explain to\n\nParker that he and Defendant had just robbed a man, that the man had seen their faces, and that they\n\nneeded Parker to help them get rid of the car. Parker agreed. Parker and two other witnesses who\n\nwere also present at the Polk Street address, Parker’s sister, Lauren Parker Turner, and Parker’s\n\nfriend, Kevin Jordan, testified that they also observed Defendant flashing a large wad of cash.\n\nJordan further testified that Defendant told him to stay away from the Diamante because it was “hot.”\n\nSometime thereafter, Defendant and Sonny Shields left 917 Polk Street in the Diamante, with Lott\n\nstill trapped in the trunk. Parker and Parker’s friend, James Stafford, followed behind in Parker’s\n\nHonda. Both Turner and Jordan witnessed and testified to the cars’ departure.\n\n\n        1\n         At trial, a records custodian for the bank testified that the bank’s ATM video camera captured an individual\nwithdrawing money from Lott’s bank account on the evening of May 19, 2004.\n\n                                                        -3-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\n       Parker’s trial testimony provides an account of what happened next. After departing from\n\n917 Polk Street, the four men crossed the Mississippi River into Arkansas before stopping at a gas\n\nstation to buy gas and a plastic gas can. Stafford filled up the latter with gas at the pump. The four\n\nmen then left the gas station and drove for some time before turning onto a secluded road, and\n\nfinally, parking on an adjoining unpaved field road. Once parked, Defendant and Sonny Shields\n\nexited the Diamante, opened the trunk, and directed Lott to get out. Lott begged for his life, to no\n\navail. When Lott attempted to run away, Sonny Shields drew his gun and fired at the fleeing figure.\n\nAt this point, Defendant grabbed the gun from Sonny, and exclaimed “You can’t do nothing right”\n\nbefore running after Lott, firing shots as he ran. Sonny Shields followed. Parker testified that,\n\nalthough the three men disappeared from his line of sight, he heard several more shots before\n\nDefendant and Sonny Shields returned to the parked cars. Sonny Shields, shoeless and carrying the\n\npistol, collected the gas can from Stafford and walked back across the field with Defendant to burn\n\nLott’s body. After some time, Defendant and Sonny Shields returned to the cars, and all four men\n\ndrove away.\n\n       On the road back to Memphis, the men stopped at a different gas station to refill the gas can.\n\nSonny Shields noticed that the gas cap was missing and grew concerned that he had accidentally left\n\nit behind. Consequently, all four men returned to the field and searched, unsuccessfully, for the\n\nerrant item. As they attempted to depart for the second time, both cars became stuck in the muddy\n\nfield, forcing the men to get out and push them free, muddying their clothes and shoes in the process.\n\nOnce back in Memphis, the men drove around looking for a place to burn Lott’s car. They\n\neventually stopped at a location near Hernando and Kerr streets, where Sonny Shields got out of the\n\n                                                 -4-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nDiamante and joined Parker and Stafford in the Honda. Defendant proceeded to burn the Diamante\n\nin a nearby field. The car exploded as it burned, injuring Defendant’s arms and face. He ran back\n\nto the others, yelling that he was hurt, and directed them to take him to his aunt’s house. Sonny\n\nShields, Parker, and Stafford complied and dropped Defendant off at his aunt’s address sometime\n\nbetween 3a.m. and 4a.m. on the morning of May 20. Defendant’s aunt, Stephanie Long, greeted him\n\nat the door and immediately noticed that he was muddy, burned, and reeking of gasoline. Defendant\n\ntold his aunt and his aunt’s husband, Tony Long, that he had been working on a car and had gotten\n\ninjured when the car’s battery caught fire. After changing clothes and shoes, Defendant asked his\n\naunt to drive him to a place where he could meet up with his girlfriend, Frenchetta Leavy. His aunt\n\nagreed, and Defendant and his aunt met Leavy in Grenada, Mississippi. Defendant told Leavy that\n\nhe’d injured himself in a barbecuing accident.2 Leavy then drove Defendant to a nearby hospital,\n\nwhere he checked in under the pseudonym “Willie Oliver.” He continued to use this false name\n\nwhen the hospital transferred him to a burn center in Greenville, Mississippi.\n\n         The Memphis Police Department became aware of Defendant’s involvement in Lott’s\n\nabduction and murder when Sonny Shields turned himself in to local investigators on the evening\n\nof May 21, 2004. By this point, the police investigation was already underway.3 Sonny Shields\n\nmade a number of inculpatory statements, but largely shifted the blame to Defendant. He also told\n\n\n         2\n             Once in custody, Defendant told Leavy that he had been present when Sonny Shields shot a man and that he’d\ngotten burned when he set someone’s car on fire.\n\n         3\n          Police officers had already found both Lott’s body and the charred Diamante, and local television stations had\nbegun airing the surveillance camera footage showing two men approaching Lott’s car in the Corner Grocery parking\nlot.\n\n                                                           -5-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nthe police where they could find Defendant. Consequently, the Sheriff’s Department in Washington\n\nCounty, Mississippi, took Defendant into custody on the evening of the same day. Three days later,\n\non May 24, Memphis police detectives Joseph Pearlman and Jasper Clay drove to Greenville, and,\n\npursuant to a federal warrant, interviewed Defendant as he waited in a holding cell prior to his initial\n\ncourt appearance. Pearlman and Clay advised Defendant of his Miranda rights, and he waived them\n\nboth orally and in a written statement. He thereafter made a tape-recorded statement that was self-\n\nserving but incriminating. Defendant admitted to being present throughout Lott’s carjacking,\n\nabduction, and murder, but placed primary blame on his cousin, just as Sonny Shields had done to\n\nhim. Defendant’s statement was admitted at trial, where the jury returned guilty verdicts on all three\n\ncounts of the indictment.\n\n                                           II. Discussion\n\n                                   1. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n        The evidence is clearly sufficient to support the jury’s verdict. Defendant first asserts that\n\nthe government failed to adequately link him to Lott’s kidnapping because the only non-accomplice\n\neyewitness to the crime, thirteen year-old Tapplin, was never able to identify Defendant as one of\n\nthe perpetrators. This argument ignores the Corner Grocery Store surveillance video showing\n\nDefendant and Sonny Shields approaching the location where Lott was sitting in his car on the\n\nevening of May 19, 2004. Tapplin, moreover, identified Sonny Shields in the first of two police\n\nphoto spreads as the man who held the gun.\n\n        Second, Defendant contends that Parker’s testimony was biased and that the jury should not\n\nhave credited it in light of the fact that Parker testified pursuant to a plea agreement under which he\n\n                                                  -6-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nwill receive a reduced sentence of twenty years imprisonment for the kidnapping charge and a\n\ndismissal of the firearms charge. The jury, however, knew of Parker’s plea agreement; it was their\n\nfunction to judge his credibility. Further, those portions of Parker’s testimony which connect\n\nDefendant to Lott’s stolen Mitsubishi Diamante, and to events that transpired at 917 Polk Street on\n\nthe night of Lott’s abduction, are strongly corroborated by the statements of other, non-accomplice\n\neyewitnesses. Defendant himself admitted – both to the police and to his girlfriend – that he was\n\npresent in the Arkansas field when, according to Defendant, Sonny Shields shot and killed Lott.4\n\nThus, even conceding the possibility that Defendant may never have pulled the trigger, there was\n\nample evidence to convince a rational trier of fact that Defendant was guilty of the charged offenses.\n\nSee U.S. v. Henderson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"179514\"><a href=\"/opinion/179514/united-states-v-henderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">626</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">326</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 341 (6th Cir. 2010).\n\n                          2. Prejudicial Effect of Various District Court Rulings\n\n         Defendant next asserts that the District Court made a variety of rulings that unfairly\n\nprejudiced the jury against him. These include: (1) improperly allowing expert opinion testimony\n\nfrom a lay witness; (2) improperly allowing testimony regarding Defendant’s medical treatment and\n\nuse of a pseudonym to obtain such treatment; (3) refusing to permit Defendant to appear at trial in\n\nstreet clothes instead of prison garb; and (4) failing to sever Defendant’s charge for escape from the\n\nkidnapping and firearms charges.\n\n\n\n\n        4\n           Defendant also argues on appeal that his statement to the police should have been suppressed. This assertion\nis addressed, and dismissed, later in the opinion.\n\n                                                         -7-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\n                                      (a) Evidentiary Rulings\n\n       Defendant contends that the District Court wrongly permitted Dale Arnold of the Arkansas\n\nState Police to highlight for the jury “what appeared to be similarities” between the tread on\n\nDefendant’s muddy shoes and a photograph of the shoe prints found near Lott’s body, despite\n\nlacking “specialized training in footprint or shoe identification.” (Appellant’s Brief at 29.) This\n\nargument lacks merit. It is true that Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence prohibits any witness\n\nfrom providing opinion testimony based on scientific, technical, or other specialized areas of\n\nknowledge unless that witness first qualifies as an expert. SeeFED . R. EVID . 702. However, Rule\n\n701 supplies an important corollary: a witness may nonetheless offer lay opinion testimony that is\n\nrationally based on the witness’s perception, or that will help the jury understand the testimony or\n\ndetermine a fact in issue, so long as it is not otherwise restricted by Rule 702. See id. 701.\n\n       Arnold’s testimony fits squarely within the limitations contemplated by Rule 701. First,\n\nArnold led the police discovery of Lott’s body and thus had sufficient personal knowledge to testify\n\nabout whether the prints in the field were similar to the tread on Defendant’s shoes. And second,\n\nthe jury benefitted from Arnold’s testimony in light of the fact that Arnold had enjoyed significantly\n\nmore time to study and compare the evidence. See U.S. v. Zepeda-Lopez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"168872\"><a href=\"/opinion/168872/united-states-v-zepeda-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1213</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1222 (10th\n\nCir. 2007). The District Court did not err by admitting it.\n\n       Defendant also asserts that the District Court improperly admitted testimony regarding\n\nDefendant’s medical treatment in Mississippi, including his use of the pseudonym “Willie Oliver”\n\nto obtain such treatment. Defendant maintains that this evidence lacked probative value, as it\n\noccurred after the crime was completed, and that it unfairly prejudiced the jury against him. We\n\n                                                 -8-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\ndisagree. The mere fact that evidence relates to activities committed after completion of a crime\n\ndoes not render it inadmissible. Rather, it is elementary that post-crime evidence is admissible when\n\nit tends to show consciousness of guilt and is not unfairly prejudicial. See e.g., U.S. v. Cody, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">582</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 591-92 (6th Cir. 2006). In this case, evidence that Defendant sought medical treatment\n\nwell over one hundred miles from Memphis, and under a false name, tended to prove that Defendant\n\nhoped to avoid apprehension for his crimes. Further, evidence relating to the treatment itself tended\n\nto link Defendant, through his injuries, to the burning of Lott’s car.\n\n              (b) Denial of Defendant’s Request to Appear in Street Clothes at Trial\n\n        Defendant next contends that the District Court denied him a fair trial by refusing his request\n\nto stand before the jury in street clothing. Although it is well-established that a trial court cannot\n\nforce a criminal defendant to appear before the jury in prison garb, no compulsion was present in this\n\ncase. See Estelle v. Williams, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 504-05 (1970); U.S. v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786089\"><a href=\"/opinion/786089/united-states-v-don-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 553-54\n\n(6th Cir. 2004). To the contrary, Defendant strategically chose to appear in prison clothes, only\n\nchanging his mind the first morning of trial. And while Defendant did at this point object to\n\nappearing before the jury in an orange jumpsuit, the District Court made all reasonable efforts, short\n\nof delaying trial, to accommodate him. Echoing Brown, this Court recently held that a trial court is\n\nnot required to either furnish alternate clothing for a defendant or else delay trial, so long as the court\n\nmakes clear that it would allow the defendant to change clothes if substitute attire could feasibly be\n\nmade available. See U.S. v. Williams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"216505\"><a href=\"/opinion/216505/united-states-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">641</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">758</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 767 (6th Cir. 2011) (citing Brown, 367 F.3d at\n\n554). The District Court clearly provided Defendant with an opportunity to change his clothes, even\n\nsuggesting that Defendant’s counsel borrow a jacket from a colleague on Defendant’s behalf. As\n\n                                                   -9-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nsuch, the District Court’s refusal to delay trial at the last minute did not amount to compelling\n\nDefendant to appear in prison clothes in violation of his constitutional rights.\n\n                      (c) Failure to Sever Escape Charge from Other Charges\n\n        Defendant also claims that the District Court prejudiced his defense by failing to sever his\n\ncharge for escape from the other charges against him. Because Defendant failed to renew his pretrial\n\nmotion to sever at the close of all the evidence, we review for plain error. See U.S. v. Walls, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778025\"><a href=\"/opinion/778025/united-states-v-franklin-walls-00-5867-jackie-phillip-stephens-00-5868/\"><span class=\"volume\">293</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">959</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 966 (6th Cir. 2002). Defendant concedes that the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\n\npermit the joinder of related offenses, but supports his argument by invoking a court’s discretionary\n\nability to sever certain offenses if it appears that prejudice would otherwise result. See FED . R. CRIM .\n\nP. 8(a), 14. Defendant, however, suffered no additional prejudice from a concurrent trial on all\n\ncharges. Evidence of his attempted escape would have been admissible circumstantially as tending\n\nto prove consciousness of guilt in a separate trial on the kidnapping and firearms charges. See U.S.\n\nv. Williams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778239\"><a href=\"/opinion/778239/united-states-v-darrell-henry-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">817</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 819 (8th Cir. 2002); U.S. v. Hankins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"560398\"><a href=\"/opinion/560398/united-states-v-larry-wayne-hankins/\"><span class=\"volume\">931</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1256</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1261 (8th Cir.\n\n1991). Thus, as to the joinder of counts, the District Court committed no error, much less plain\n\nerror. See Williams, 295 F.3d at 819.\n\n                            3. Denial of Defendant’s Motion to Suppress\n\n        Prior to trial, Defendant moved to suppress the tape-recorded statement he gave to police on\n\nMay 24, 2004, on the ground that it was not voluntary, despite Defendant’s oral and written waiver\n\nof his Miranda rights. The District Court denied the motion and admitted the statement at trial.\n\nDefendant now contends, for the first time, that the District Court’s pretrial adjudication of his\n\nmental retardation, which rendered him ineligible to receive the death penalty, also invalidated his\n\n                                                  -10-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nwaiver of rights because it was not made knowingly and intelligently. Defendant also asserts that,\n\nbecause he is mentally retarded, his statement was the product of inherent police coercion.\n\nDefendant’s claim of ineffective waiver is a losing one because it both has no merit and was waived.\n\n         There is case law to support the proposition that diminished mental capacity can, by limiting\n\na defendant’s ability to understand the nature of his or her rights and the consequences of abandoning\n\nthem, contribute to a determination that a waiver was invalid. See U.S. v. Garibay, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754206\"><a href=\"/opinion/754206/98-cal-daily-op-serv-3361-98-daily-journal-dar-4667-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">534</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n539 (9th Cir. 1998). But Defendant failed to raise this issue before the District Court, despite ample\n\nopportunity. Specifically, the chronology of events was such that Defendant, once adjudicated\n\nmentally retarded, could have filed a supplemental memorandum in support of his motion to\n\nsuppress that specifically addressed the question of whether he was capable of signing a knowing,\n\nintelligent, and voluntary waiver of his rights. He did not. Defendant also did not object at trial to\n\nthe admission of his statement on this basis.5 As a general rule, this Court refuses to consider an\n\nissue on appeal that a defendant did not first raise before the District Court, except in “‘exceptional\n\ncases or particular circumstances’” not present here. See U.S. v. Pickett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566352\"><a href=\"/opinion/566352/united-states-v-keith-pickett/\"><span class=\"volume\">941</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 415 (6th Cir.\n\n1991) (quoting Pinney Dock & Transp.

Defendant has therefore waived his claim.\n\n         Further, even absent waiver, Defendant’s claim fails on the merits. In Garner v. Mitchell,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1433538\"><a href=\"/opinion/1433538/garner-v-mitchell/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 264, 270-71 (6th Cir. 2009), this Court held that a defendant in the “‘borderline range\n\n\n        5\n            Defendant’s counsel objected to admission of the statement but on the basis that portions of it were\nunintelligible, thus calling into question the accuracy of the text which ran across the screen as an aid to listeners.\n\n                                                         -11-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nof intelligence’” who also suffered from a troubled upbringing and poor education knowingly,\n\nintelligently, and voluntarily waived his Miranda rights. Noting that “diminished mental capacity\n\nalone does not prevent a defendant from validly waiving his or her Miranda rights,” we reasoned that\n\nthis factor must instead “be viewed alongside other factors, including evidence of the defendant’s\n\nconduct during, and leading up to, the interrogation.” Id. at 264-65. In this case, the District Court\n\nfound that:\n\n       Defendant was alert and attentive and manifested no outward signs of being\n       incoherent or otherwise incapable of giving a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary\n       waiver of his rights. Using the term “Miranda” specifically, Defendant stated he\n       knew his rights and wanted to make a statement.\n\n       (Order Denying Defendant’s Motion to Suppress at 3.) Defendant’s cooperativeness and\n\ncoherency thus demonstrate that he grasped both the nature of the charges against him and the\n\nconsequences that could flow from his interactions with police to effectuate a knowing, intelligent,\n\nand voluntary waiver of his Miranda rights. See Garner, 557 F.3d at 265. Moreover, retarded or\n\nnot, he was capable of recounting facts he had experienced.\n\n                4. Imposition of Mandatory Life Sentence for Kidnapping Charge\n\n       Defendant’s final argument relies heavily on Atkins v. Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121158\"><a href=\"/opinion/121158/atkins-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 321 (2002) to\n\nsupport the proposition that, because he is mentally retarded, his mandatory sentence of life\n\nimprisonment for kidnapping resulting in the death of the victim violates his Eighth Amendment\n\nprotection against cruel and unusual punishment. We review this constitutional challenge de novo.\n\nIn Atkins, the Supreme Court held that “death is not a suitable punishment for a mentally retarded\n\ncriminal.” 536 U.S. at 321. Indeed, Defendant was saved from the possibility of capital punishment\n\n\n                                                -12-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nby the District Court’s reliance on Atkins. Defendant now asks this Court to extend Atkins by\n\nholding that his sentence of life imprisonment, made mandatory by statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1201(a),\n\nsimilarly violates the Eighth Amendment because it fails to account for his inherently reduced\n\nculpability.\n\n        Atkins, however, has proven resistant to expansion beyond capital punishment. See U.S. v.\n\nTucker , 204 Fed. Appx. 518, 521-22 (6th Cir. 2006); U.S. v. Laffoon, 145 Fed. Appx. 964, 964 (5th\n\nCir. 2005). In Tucker, this Court explicitly held that “imposing a mandatory minimum sentence on\n\na defendant with limited mental capabilities does not violate the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel\n\nand unusual punishment.” 204 Fed.

Because we do not agree with Defendant’s\n\nassertion that the distinction between capital and non-capital sentences is “artificial” when assessing\n\nproportionality, we follow the holding in that case.

As a matter of retributive justice, life imprisonment\n\nis not an unconstitutionally severe punishment for the crime of kidnapping and participating in the\n\nmurder of Lott.\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -13-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\n        CLAY, Circuit Judge, dissenting. I write separately because Shannon Shields, a mentally\n\nretarded defendant, suffered a serious injustice when the district court largely disregarded and\n\nminimized his mental status during the trial proceedings. As a result, Shields’ right to a fair and\n\nconstitutionally adequate trial was seriously compromised. I therefore respectfully dissent.\n\n        The kidnapping and murder of Jerrell Lott was a senseless and shocking crime. Soon after\n\napprehending Shannon Shields and his cousin, Sonny Shields, the government announced its\n\nintention to seek the death penalty against the two accused men. Shannon Shields then requested\n\na pretrial hearing to determine whether he was mentally retarded and thus ineligible to face the death\n\npenalty under Atkins v. Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121158\"><a href=\"/opinion/121158/atkins-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 321 (2002).\n\n        The district court held an extensive eight-day evidentiary hearing on the matter. In the course\n\nof the hearing, the defense presented the expert testimony of two psychologists, as well as the lay\n\ntestimony of Shields’ parents, his sister, his longtime girlfriend, several of his former educators, and\n\na prison counselor. The government presented the competing expert testimony of two additional\n\npsychologists. After considering the evidence and post-hearing memoranda, the district court issued\n\na lengthy order finding Shields mentally retarded and thus ineligible to face the death penalty. (See\n\nRE 557, Order on Mental Retardation.)\n\n        The hearing produced ample evidence to conclude that Shields is mentally retarded. In five\n\nIQ tests administered over Shields’ lifetime, his scores ranged from 69 at the lowest to 73 at the\n\nhighest.1 Shields cannot live independently, and he does not work. He relies extensively on the\n\n\n       1\n       According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.–Text\nRevision) (“DSM-IV”), “significantly subaverage intellectual functioning” is defined as an IQ of 70\n\n                                                 -14-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nassistance of his parents and his girlfriend to complete common, everyday tasks. Shields cannot\n\nprepare his own food, follow a recipe, or shop for groceries. He cannot budget his own money, pay\n\nhis monthly bills, or master a checkbook. Concepts that are, to the normal-functioning person,\n\nsimple matters of common sense, are beyond Shields’ grasp. To cite but a few salient examples,\n\nShields does not understand the obligation to repay purchases made with a credit card. He does not\n\nsee the need for and lacks the follow-through to obtain an identification card. He does not grasp the\n\ndangers of leaving a hot iron unattended.\n\n       Shields is completely unable to set his own priorities, to self-direct, or to complete even the\n\nmost rudimentary tasks without the continual supervision and frequent reminders of a parent or other\n\nresponsible adult. Although Shields has worked for brief periods in several unskilled positions, such\n\nas a dishwasher and a furniture mover, he has never been able to maintain steady employment due\n\nto his innate mental limitations. His inability to follow directions or to work productively without\n\ncontinual direction has also hindered his job prospects. As a result of these limitations, Shields has\n\nreceived some form of social security disability assistance since his teenage years.\n\n       Shields’ mental limitations became manifest early in his childhood education. Without\n\nparental assistance, he struggled with grooming and personal hygiene, and he did not relate to his\n\nclassmates in “age-appropriate” ways. After a year in kindergarten, Shields was unable to even\n\nrecognize his own name in writing, let alone read or write it himself, despite his teacher’s personal\n\nefforts to help him master this simple goal. In later years, Shields was disallowed from riding the\n\n\n\nor below.\n\n                                                -15-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nschool bus because of his lack of independence and his frequent outbursts. In the classroom, Shields\n\nrequired constant individualized attention and instruction because he was unable to work\n\nindependently or to stay on task without a teacher’s direct supervision. Although Shields initially\n\nstarted on a mixed track of special education and regular classes, he struggled with the regular\n\ncurricula and fell appreciably behind his peer group. By the ninth grade, school administrators\n\ncompletely removed Shields from the regular classroom and placed him on track to receive a\n\n“certificate of attendance” rather than a high school diploma.            Shields’ special education\n\nprogramming did not teach mainstream educational curricula, but instead focused on functional\n\nskills, such as learning how to count money and how to write basic information, like his address and\n\nhis parents’ names. Ultimately, Shields dropped out of school entirely by the tenth grade.\n\n        Despite the extent of Shields’ mental deficiencies, his hindrances are not of the type that\n\nwould be readily apparent to the average observer. As an adult, Shields is now “careful about his\n\nappearance” and “tries to keep himself well-groomed.” He can speak well, and he possesses some\n\nlimited reading skills, although his comprehension is sub-average, and he “lack[s] the ability to\n\nengage in deep and meaningful conversation.” He is skilled at convincing others around him to\n\naccomplish tasks on his behalf, he ignores social strictures (for example, he drives although he has\n\nno license to do so), and he deceives others to achieve his personal objectives. Shields is often\n\ndeceptive and manipulative; however, his stratagems are “transparent” and “not well thought out.”\n\nShields is gullible, susceptible to the influence of his peers, and he seemingly lacks ambition or long-\n\nterm goals of his own. To quote the district court, Shields is an individual whose mental limitations\n\n\n\n                                                 -16-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nrender him “largely disconnected from the types of social responsibilities and tasks expected of\n\nregularly functioning adults in society.”\n\n         The district court deserves commendation for the attention it devoted to Shields’ mental\n\nretardation hearing and its evaluations of Shields’ eligibility for the death penalty. However, a\n\ndefendant is not mentally retarded for purposes of the death penalty alone. As with any factual\n\nfinding in a criminal proceeding, the district court’s rulings on mental retardation should have proven\n\nsalient throughout the remainder of Shields’ trial proceedings. Unfortunately, after making detailed\n\nfactual assessments about Shields’ mental limitations, the district court then inexplicably shelved\n\nthose facts and proceeded as though Shields’ innate limitations did not exist for the remainder of his\n\ntrial.\n\n         While defense counsel’s willingness to also ignore Shields’ mental retardation is\n\nincomprehensible, it is equally inexcusable for the district court to have set aside its own factual\n\nfindings for the remainder of the trial. Although the district court was not obligated to try defense\n\ncounsel’s case, the court was not relieved of its duty to avoid glaring errors or to make independent\n\ninquiries to ensure that Shields received his right to a fair trial.\n\n         Specifically, the district court should have considered Shields’ mental retardation when it\n\nruled on the motion to suppress. Shields freely admits that he received a Miranda warning and that\n\nhe waived his rights before he provided his recorded statement to police. See Miranda v. Arizona,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 444 (1966). However, for better or worse, Miranda’s now-familiar questions are an\n\nimperfect and approximate instrument for measuring the validity of a suspect’s waiver. Ultimately,\n\nwhether a suspect validly waived his rights depends not only on whether the Miranda warning was\n\n                                                  -17-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nproperly given, but also on whether the waiver of the suspect’s Miranda rights was made\n\n“voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently.” Id. at 444–45.\n\n        This fact-sensitive inquiry has two distinct dimensions. Moran v. Burbine, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111614\"><a href=\"/opinion/111614/moran-v-burbine/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">412</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 421\n\n(1986) (citing Edwards v. Arizona, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110475\"><a href=\"/opinion/110475/edwards-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">477</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 482 (1981); Brewer v.

For a waiver to have been “voluntary,” it must have been “the product of a free and\n\ndeliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or deception.” Id. For the waiver to have been\n\nmade “knowingly and intelligently,” it must have been made “with a full awareness of both the\n\nnature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.” Id. “Only\n\nif the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation reveal both an uncoerced choice and\n\nthe requisite level of comprehension may a court properly conclude that the Miranda rights [were]\n\nwaived.” Id. (citing Fare v. Michael C., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110117\"><a href=\"/opinion/110117/fare-v-michael-c/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 725 (1979) (internal quotation marks and\n\nadditional citations omitted)).\n\n        Defense counsel only addressed the issue of voluntariness with respect to the Miranda\n\nwaiver, summarily arguing that Shields’ statement ought to be suppressed because “coercive police\n\nactivity overbore his will.” After considering the testimony of the interrogating officers, the district\n\ncourt disagreed with defense counsel’s argument. It would appear that the district court correctly\n\ndecided the issue of voluntariness, inasmuch as no evidence was elicited to suggest that the officers\n\ndeliberately intimidated, coerced, or deceived Shields into giving an involuntary statement. See\n\nGarner v. Mitchell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1433538\"><a href=\"/opinion/1433538/garner-v-mitchell/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 274 (2009) (en banc) (Moore, J., dissenting).\n\n        However, the district court never reached the second part of the waiver inquiry. The court\n\nnever asked whether Shields—with all his innate mental deficiencies—possessed “the maturity,\n\n                                                 -18-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nintelligence, and competency to make a knowing and intelligent waiver.” Id. at 274. Despite the fact\n\nthat the district court’s own earlier, detailed ruling strongly cast doubt on that issue, the court simply\n\nignored Shields’ mental retardation and failed to take it into account for the purposes of the\n\nsuppression motion.\n\n        The government would have us fault defense counsel for this omission, arguing that Shields\n\nwaived the opportunity to raise the “knowing and intelligent” argument because counsel failed to\n\nmake that contention before the district court. If so, the government only highlights for our attention\n\na glaring ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\n\n        Regardless of what defense counsel did or did not argue, however, the district court’s inquiry\n\nshould not have ended with respect to the officer’s conduct. Id. at 275–76. The waiver inquiry\n\nencompasses two distinct parts, which work conjunctively, are therefore indivisible, and must both\n\nbe considered to determine whether a valid waiver was made. See id. at 275. Deciding the validity\n\nof a waiver based solely on police conduct, without regard for whether the defendant had the capacity\n\nto make a knowing and intelligent waiver, reads the second element out of the waiver inquiry, and\n\nis clearly out of line with established Supreme Court Miranda jurisprudence. Id. In any event, it is\n\nutterly perplexing that Shields’ mental retardation did not arise as a topic of concern during the\n\nsuppression hearing, whether spontaneously or by the court’s direction, given the obvious connection\n\nbetween Shields’ mental limitations and his capacity to make a knowing and intelligent waiver of\n\nhis Miranda rights.\n\n        As the majority correctly points out, finding a defendant mentally retarded does not preclude\n\nhim from validly waiving his Miranda rights. See Garner, 557 F.3d at 264–65 (Rogers, J., majority).\n\n                                                  -19-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nHowever, the waiver inquiry is always fact-sensitive and dependent on the totality of the\n\ncircumstances—even more so in a case like this one. Id. In this instance, the evidence indicates that\n\nShields lacks basic life skills, is easily manipulated, and operates largely outside the realm of\n\ncommon sense reasoning. Under such circumstances, Shields’ ability to mention Miranda by name\n\nis not necessarily indicative of his grasp of the charges against him or his understanding of the\n\nconsequences of waiving his rights.2 Unfortunately, this Court has no basis on which to evaluate\n\nShields’ capacity to make a valid waiver, because the district court failed to make the necessary and\n\nreasonable inquiries required to address the waiver issue.\n\n       The district court also should have taken Shields’ mental limitations into account when\n\nShields timely asked to wear street attire to his trial. Citing two prior cases from this Circuit, the\n\nmajority reasons that the district court was not obligated to significantly delay proceedings to\n\naccommodate Shields’ last-minute request. See United States v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786089\"><a href=\"/opinion/786089/united-states-v-don-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 553–54 (6th\n\nCir. 2004); United States v. Williams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"216505\"><a href=\"/opinion/216505/united-states-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">641</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">758</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 767 (6th Cir. 2011). However, Brown and\n\nWilliams are clearly distinguishable from the case before us, because neither of those cases involved\n\na mentally retarded defendant.\n\n       By contrast, in this case the district court was thoroughly aware that Shields’ mental\n\nretardation may have rendered him slow to fully appreciate the nature and the seriousness of the\n\nproceedings, including the effects his prison clothes might have on the jury’s impartiality. Rather\n\n\n\n       2\n        Of course, these findings also bear directly on the central factual dispute raised by the\ndefense—whether it was Defendant’s cousin, Sonny Shields, who was primarily responsible for\norchestrating the kidnapping and ultimately murdering Jerrell Lott.\n\n                                                -20-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nthan accommodate Shields’ reasonable request, the district court instead offered the defense an even\n\nmore limited option than was granted by the courts in Brown and Williams. The district court’s\n\nproposed solution—that Shields wear a sport coat over his prison uniform—was really no solution\n\nat all. The court’s limited offer was insufficient to protect Shields’ right to an impartial jury,\n\nparticularly given that his request, though admittedly belated, was technically timely. Furthermore,\n\nthere was no substance to the district court’s contention that permitting a short recess to allow\n\nShields to change clothes would have significantly delayed the proceedings.\n\n        Finally, it is troubling that the escape charge was not severed from the rest of Shields’ trial.\n\nAt best, the evidence elicited on the escape count was minimal. Shields’ attempted “escape” was\n\nchildishly ill-planned and ill-thought out, which is perhaps unsurprising given his mental retardation.\n\nWhile awaiting trial on the kidnapping and murder charges, Shields was segregated in a high-security\n\nprison that allowed him one hour outdoors in an isolated pen housed within the prison’s recreation\n\nyard. Shields and a fellow inmate pried loose the wire fence of their segregation pens, but they were\n\nquickly apprehended clinging to the inner perimeter fence of the recreation yard. Even if Shields’\n\nineffective defense counsel unjustifiably waived its chance to request a severance of the escape\n\ncharge, its facts were obviously weak and entirely tertiary to the other issues at trial. The district\n\ncourt should have been more vigilant in protecting Shields against the inclusion of this wholly\n\nunrelated, but highly prejudicial charge. At a minimum, some inquiry by the district court with\n\nrespect to this issue would have been appropriate.\n\n        In any criminal trial, the presiding judge has an obligation to steward the proceedings in a\n\nmanner that takes into account the full range of facts before the court and that steers clear of obvious\n\n                                                  -21-\n\fNo. 10-5097\nUnited States v. Shields\n\nviolations of the defendant’s constitutional rights. I cannot agree that Shields received this\n\nconsideration when the district court largely disregarded Shields’ mental deficiencies, shunted aside\n\nits own detailed factual findings with respect to Shields’ mental retardation, and failed to take into\n\naccount the obvious inadequacies of the ineffective assistance defense counsel provided to the\n\ndefendant. Accordingly, and for the reasons discussed above, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -22-\n\f</pre>",
