The members excepted two of the 17 overt acts:\n\f                   United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nviolation of Articles 81, 118, and 121, Uniform Code of Military Justice\n(UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. §§ 881, 918, and 921 (2005).2 The members sentenced the\nappellant to 2,627 days’ confinement3 and a bad-conduct discharge. The\nconvening authority (CA) approved the sentence as adjudged and, except for\nthe punitive discharge, ordered the sentence executed.\n    The appellant raises 13 assignments of error (AOE): (1) the military\njudge’s denial of the defense motion to suppress evidence of conduct for which\nthe appellant was acquitted at his first trial; (2) admission of former\ntestimony where the declarants were not unavailable and there was no\nsimilar motive for cross-examination; (3) unlawful command influence (UCI)\nfrom the Secretary of the Navy; (4) the military judge’s finding that apparent\nUCI stemming from the prosecution’s search of defense counsel’s office in\nanother case was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt; (5) denial of the\ndefense motion for recusal; (6) denial of the defense request to abate\nproceedings until the appellant’s attorney-client relationship was restored;\n(7) denial of the defense motion to dismiss based on the government’s\nviolation of the appellant’s Article 13, UCMJ, rights; (8) denial of the defense\nrequest for a site visit; (9) admission of an exhibit founded on hearsay; (10)\ndenial of the defense request for a mistrial after the members heard a\ngovernment witness testify that the appellant asserted his right to remain\nsilent; (11) the impact of the significant accumulation of errors on the\noutcome of the case; (12) the appellant’s excessive and disproportionate\nsentence to roughly six years’ confinement in light of companion cases; and\n(13) the legal and factual insufficiency of the findings.\n\n\n\n\n           m.

Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n    After carefully considering the pleadings, oral arguments, and the record\nof trial, we find no error materially prejudicial to the substantial rights of the\nappellant and affirm the findings and sentence. Arts. 59(a) and 66(c), UCMJ.\n                                I. BACKGROUND\n    First, a procedural orientation may be helpful. The appellant was\noriginally convicted in August 2007 for his role in the shooting death of an\nunknown Iraqi man in Hamdaniyah, Iraq, the morning of 26 April 2006. This\ncourt set aside the findings and sentence for an improper severance of\nattorney-client relationship in April 2010. United States v. Hutchins, 68 M.J.\n623, 631 (N-M. Ct. Crim. App. 2010) (Hutchins I). The Court of Appeals for\nthe Armed Forces (CAAF) reversed that decision and remanded the case to\nthis court to complete its review under Article 66, UCMJ, in January 2011.\nUnited States v. Hutchins, 69 M.J. 282, 293 (C.A.A.F. 2011) (Hutchins II).\nThis court completed that review and affirmed the findings and sentence of\nthe first court-martial in March 2012. United States v. Hutchins, No.\n200800393, 2012 CCA LEXIS 93, *32, unpublished op. (N-M. Ct. Crim. App.\n20 Mar 2012) (Hutchins III). Finding a violation of the appellant’s Fifth\nAmendment rights against self-incrimination, the CAAF reversed our 2012\ndecision, set aside the findings and sentence of the 2007 court-martial, and\nremanded the case with authorization for a rehearing. United States v.\nHutchins, 72 M.J. 294, 301 (C.A.A.F. 2013) (Hutchins IV). The results of that\nrehearing are before us here.\n   As for the events of the night and early morning of 25-26 April 2006, we\nrevisit our summary from Hutchins III, which the CAAF republished in\nHutchins IV:\n           The appellant was assigned as squad leader for 1st Squad,\n       2nd Platoon, Kilo Company, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines,\n       assigned to Task Force Chromite, conducting counter-\n       insurgency operations in the Hamdaniyah area of Iraq in April\n       2006. In the evening hours of 25 April 2006, the appellant led a\n       combat patrol to conduct a deliberate ambush aimed at\n       interdicting insurgent emplacement of improvised explosive\n       devices (IEDs). The court-martial received testimony from\n       several members of the squad that indicated the intended\n       ambush mission morphed into a conspiracy to deliberately\n       capture and kill a high value individual (HVI), believed to be a\n       leader of the insurgency. The witnesses gave varying testimony\n       as to the depth of their understanding of alternative targets,\n       such as family members of the HVI or another random\n       military-aged Iraqi male.\n\n\n\n                                        3\n\f                 United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n         Considerable effort and preparation went into the execution\n      of this conspiracy. Tasks were accomplished by various\n      Marines and their corpsman, including the theft of a shovel\n      and AK-47 from an Iraqi dwelling to be used as props to\n      manufacture a scene where it appeared that an armed\n      insurgent was digging to emplace an IED. Some squad\n      members advanced to the ambush site while others captured\n      an unknown Iraqi man, bound and gagged him, and brought\n      him to the would-be IED emplacement.\n          The stage set, the squad informed higher headquarters by\n      radio that they had come upon an insurgent planting an IED\n      and received approval to engage. The squad opened fire,\n      mortally wounding the man. The appellant approached the\n      victim and fired multiple rifle rounds into the man's face at\n      point blank range.\n          The scene was then manipulated to appear consistent with\n      the insurgent/IED story. The squad removed the bindings from\n      the victim's hands and feet and positioned the victim’s body\n      with the shovel and AK-47 rifle they had stolen from local\n      Iraqis. To simulate that the victim fired on the squad, the\n      Marines fired the AK-47 rifle into the air and collected the\n      discharged casings. When questioned about the action, the\n      appellant, like other members of the squad, made false official\n      statements, describing the situation as a legitimate ambush\n      and a “good shoot.” The death was brought to the appellant’s\n      battalion commander’s attention by a local sheikh and the\n      ensuing investigation led to the case before us.\nHutchins IV, 72 M.J. at 296 (quoting Hutchins III, 2012 CCA LEXIS 93 at *4-\n6).\n   For ease of understanding the hierarchy within the appellant’s squad, his\nsquad members and co-conspirators will be identified by the ranks they held\non 26 April 2006. They were Corporal (Cpl) Magincalda, Cpl Thomas, Lance\nCorporal (LCpl) Jackson, LCpl Pennington, LCpl Shumate, Private First\nClass (PFC) Jodka, and Navy corpsman, Hospitalman Third Class (HM3)\nBacos. Other witnesses will also be identified by ranks they held in 2006.\n   We will incorporate additional facts as we address the AOEs.\n\n\n\n\n                                     4\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n                                    II. DISCUSSION\nA. Admissibility of evidence and issue preclusion\n    In his first AOE, the appellant avers that the military judge erred in\nadmitting evidence of conduct of which the appellant had been acquitted at\nhis first trial. Specifically, the evidence of acquitted misconduct included\n“evidence of ‘housebreaking,’ ‘kidnapping,’ the alternate plan to seize a\nrandom Iraqi, and the alleged seizure of a random Iraqi by the snatch team.”4\n   We review a military judge’s ruling on a motion to suppress evidence for\nan abuse of discretion. United States v. Harrell, 75 M.J. 359, 362 (C.A.A.F.\n2016). The military judge’s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error;\nconclusions of law are reviewed de novo. Id. “If the military judge fails to\nplace his findings and analysis on the record, less deference will be accorded.”\nUnited States v. Flesher, 73 M.J. 303, 312 (C.A.A.F. 2014).\n   Intertwined with the appellant’s AOE regarding the admission of\nevidence are two related issues—collateral estoppel (also known as issue\npreclusion) and the appellant’s purported acquittal of conspiring to kill\nanyone other than high value individual and suspected insurgency leader,\nS.G.5 We must address these two issues and their relationships to\nadmissibility of evidence before reviewing the military judge’s ruling. It is\nhelpful to keep in mind that the case before us is a rehearing.\n   1. Collateral estoppel / issue preclusion\n    When, as here, the government retries a criminal case, findings of not\nguilty from the first trial establish precedents limiting all future prosecutions\nof the same matter. Once acquitted of an offense, an accused need never “‘run\nthe gantlet’” again with regard to that specific offense. Ashe v. Swenson, 397\nU.S. 436, 446 (1970) (quoting Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184, 190\n(1957)). The Double Jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the\nConstitution protects the accused from being “subject, for the same offence, to\nbe twice put in jeopardy of life or limb[.]” U.S. CONST., amend. V. Courts have\nlong recognized the civil litigation concept of collateral estoppel. See Hoag v.\nNew Jersey, 356 U.S. 464, 470 (1958) (“‘[W]here a question of fact essential to\nthe judgment is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final\njudgment, the determination is conclusive between the parties in a\nsubsequent action on a different cause of action.’”) (quoting RESTATEMENT,\nJUDGMENTS, § 68(1) (1942)). In Ashe, the Supreme Court held that criminal\n\n   4   Appellant’s Brief of 28 Jun 2016 at 30-31 (citation omitted).\n   5  S.G. was a suspected Iraqi insurgency leader and an HVI in the Hamdaniyah\narea, believed to be responsible for a number of IED attacks on American forces. He\nwas also the intended target of the conspiracy and killing at issue in this case.\n\n\n                                            5\n\f                   United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\ncollateral estoppel was embodied in the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee\nagainst double jeopardy. 397 U.S. at 445. After the incorporation of criminal\ncollateral estoppel into double jeopardy protection in Ashe, courts began to\nrefer to it as issue preclusion. See Schiro v. Farley, 510 U.S. 222, 232 (1994).\n    The Ashe Court concluded that when a final and valid verdict resolved an\nissue of ultimate fact, the government could not litigate it again in a\nsubsequent prosecution. Ashe, 397 U.S. at 446. An issue of fact is ultimate\nwhen it is critical to the verdict. “Issue preclusion bars successive litigation of\n‘an issue of fact or law’ that ‘is actually litigated and determined by a valid\nand final judgment, and . . . is essential to the judgment.’” Bobby v. Bies, 556\nU.S. 825, 834 (2009) (citation omitted) (emphasis added).\n    The issue of ultimate fact in Ashe’s case was whether he was among the\nband of robbers who broke into a poker game in a private home and stole\nmoney and a car from the six players around the table. Id. at 437. Ashe had\nbeen arrested in connection with the robbery and charged with robbing one of\nthe players. Id. at 437-38. There was no question that the poker player had\nbeen robbed; the only issue in dispute was whether Ashe was one of the\nrobbers. Id. at 438-39. Despite a jury’s acquittal at this first trial, Ashe was\nlater charged and convicted of robbing a different player at the same game.\nId. at 439-440. On a petition for habeas corpus, the Ashe Court honed in on\nthe “issue in dispute,” finding:\n       [T]he record is utterly devoid of any indication that the first\n       jury could rationally have found that an armed robbery had not\n       occurred, or that [the victim in the first trial] had not been a\n       victim of that robbery. The single rationally conceivable issue\n       in dispute before the jury was whether the petitioner had been\n       one of the robbers. And the jury by its verdict found that he\n       had not. The federal rule of law, therefore, would make a\n       second prosecution for the robbery of [the victim in the second\n       trial] wholly impermissible.\nId. at 445 (emphasis added). The issue in dispute, Ashe’s presence at the\nrobbery, was an issue of ultimate fact as it was essential to charges of robbery\nat his first and second trials. With reasonable doubt as to this essential\nultimate fact, the government could not proceed with it at a second trial that\nalso depended on it. Id. at 446. See also Dowling v. United States, 493 U.S.\n342, 348 (1990) (rejecting the claim of collateral estoppel because “the prior\nacquittal did not determine an ultimate issue in the present case”); see also\nid. at 356 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (“Thus, in addition to being protected\nagainst retrial for the ‘same offense,’ the defendant is protected against\nprosecution for an offense that requires proof of a fact found in his favor in a\nprior proceeding.” (emphasis added)).\n\n\n                                        6\n\f                   United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n    The burden is on the accused to proffer that a previous set of not guilty\nfindings resolved an issue of ultimate fact and move for dismissal of\nsubsequent charges also dependent on that same issue. The accused must\nidentify the issue in dispute, demonstrate that the verdict in the previous\ntrial definitively resolved the proffered issue, and pray that it be foreclosed\nfrom further dispute in court. Dowling, 493 U.S. at 350. Once the accused\nproffers an issue of ultimate fact, the court must then test the accused’s\nproffer. Ashe, 397 U.S. at 444. The Ashe Court charged trial courts testing for\nissue preclusion with delving back into prior findings:\n       [T]he rule of collateral estoppel in criminal cases is not to be\n       applied with the hypertechnical and archaic approach of a 19th\n       century pleading book, but with realism and rationality. Where\n       a previous judgment of acquittal was based upon a general\n       verdict, as is usually the case, this approach requires a court to\n       “examine the record of [the] prior proceeding, taking into\n       account the pleadings, evidence, charge, and other relevant\n       matter, and conclude whether a rational jury could have\n       grounded its verdict on an issue other than that which the\n       defendant seeks to foreclose from consideration.”\nId. (citations omitted). See also Bravo-Fernandez v. United States, 580 U.S.\n__, 137 S. Ct. 352, 359 (2016) (noting that “[t]o identify what a jury in a\nprevious trial necessarily decided . . . a court ‘must examine the record of a\nprior proceeding, taking into account the pleadings, evidence, charge, and\nother relevant matter’” (quoting Ashe, 397 U.S. at 444)). Cf Dowling, 493 U.S.\nat 352 (finding “any number of possible explanations for the jury’s acquittal\nverdict at Dowling’s first trial[,]” the Court concluded that “the petitioner has\nfailed to satisfy his burden of demonstrating” the proffered issue had been\nresolved in his favor). Having established that issue preclusion protects an\nissue of ultimate fact that is essential to both prior trial and trial at hand, we\nnow consider issues of less than ultimate fact—relevant but not essential to\npending charges.\n   2. Extension of issue preclusion to evidence suppression\n    When an issue of fact is not essential to both verdicts and thus not\nultimate in both cases, preclusion is not automatic. The government need not\nprove the acquitted issue beyond a reasonable doubt to secure a new\nconviction, so it can proceed with the new prosecution. But can the\ngovernment present evidence of that acquitted issue at a pending trial? With\nvarying degrees of success, criminal defendants have invoked issue\npreclusion to suppress evidence from a prior acquittal in a subsequent trial.\nSee Dowling, 493 U.S. at 348 (declining to extend Ashe’s bar on relitigation\n“to exclude in all circumstances . . . relevant and probative evidence that is\n\n\n                                        7\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\notherwise admissible under the Rules of Evidence simply because it relates to\nalleged criminal conduct for which a defendant has been acquitted”); see also\nUnited States v. Hicks, 24 M.J. 3, 8 (C.M.A. 1987) (noting “disagreement\namong the courts about the extent of the application of the doctrine of\ncollateral estoppel to the evidentiary use of prior acts of which an accused has\nbeen acquitted.”)\n    The appellant urges us to follow case precedent from the Second and Fifth\nCircuits and extend issue preclusion beyond issues of ultimate fact to\nevidence of prior bad acts subject to acquittal. See United States v.\nMespoulede, 597 F.2d 329, 334 (2d Cir. 1979) (challenging the notion that\ncollateral estoppel only applies to facts essential to conviction); Wingate v.\nWainwright, 464 F.2d 209, 213 (5th Cir. 1972) (finding no “meaningful\ndifference in the quality of ‘jeopardy’ to which a defendant is again subjected\nwhen the state attempts to prove his guilt by relitigating a settled fact issue\nwhich depends upon whether the relitigated issue is one of ‘ultimate’ fact or\nmerely an ‘evidentiary’ fact in the second prosecution”).\n    In Hicks, our superior court explicitly rejected what it characterized as\nthe minority approach of allowing collateral estoppel “to determine\nadmissibility of evidence which resulted in acquittal at a prior trial.” 24 M.J.\nat 8.6 Opting for the majority approach, the court declared that, “otherwise\nadmissible evidence” was still admissible, “even though it was previously\nintroduced on charges of which an accused has been acquitted.” Id. (citations\nomitted). As the court succinctly stated in an opinion nearly thirty years\nlater, “the admissibility of other acts evidence is governed by the Military\nRules of Evidence . . . , and not by the members’ verdict.” United States v.\nWashington, 63 M.J. 418, 422 (C.A.A.F. 2006). See also United States v.\nMiller, 46 M.J. 63, 66 (C.A.A.F. 1997) (affirming a military judge’s application\nof Military Rule of Evidence 404(b), SUPPLEMENT TO MANUAL FOR COURTS-\nMARTIAL, UNITED STATES (2012 ed.) (MIL. R. EVID.) and the Reynolds test7 in\nadmitting evidence of prior misconduct for which the appellant was\nacquitted).\n    In Hicks, trial defense counsel (TDC) sought to suppress the testimony of\nfour women who would describe Sergeant (Sgt) Hicks extorting them. 24 M.J.\nat 6-7. Sgt Hicks was charged with demanding sex from a woman in return\nfor not reporting her boyfriend’s misconduct. Id. at 5. The trial court found\n\n\n   6 Citing E.

Reynolds, 25 M.J. 105, 109 (C.M.A. 1989).\n\n\n                                           8\n\f                  United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nthe evidence of uncharged misconduct “highly probative of a certain method\nor scheme employed by appellant to use his position of authority ‘to\norchestrate events’ to obtain sexual or monetary favors from vulnerable\nfemales.” Id. at 7 (citation omitted). Hicks argued that collateral estoppel\nshould prevent two of the women from testifying because he had been\nacquitted of their allegations at courts-martial. Id. In rejecting Hicks’\nargument to apply collateral estoppel and suppress some of the evidence in\nhis case, the Court of Military Appeals distinguished his case from Ashe. “In\nAshe v. Swenson, . . . the fact underlying the issue of identity—that is,\nwhether the accused was present at the robbery—was an ultimate fact and\nessential for conviction in both proceedings. On the other hand, the other-acts\nevidence here was totally separate from the instant offenses in time and\nplace; was used for a limited evidentiary point; did not require proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt; and, although probative, was unnecessary to support a\nconviction of the instant charges.” Id. at 8-9.\n   3. Admissibility of evidence from an acquittal at court-martial\n    Instead of issue preclusion, three Military Rules of Evidence govern the\nrelevance and admissibility of evidence of conduct already litigated in a prior\ncourt-martial. Miller, 46 M.J. at 66; Hicks, 24 M.J. at 8. First, “[e]vidence is\nrelevant if: (a) it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than\nit would be without the evidence; and (b) the fact is of consequence in\ndetermining the action.” MIL. R. EVID. 401. “The military judge may exclude\nrelevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a\ndanger of one or more of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues,\nmisleading the members, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting\ncumulative evidence.” MIL. R. EVID. 403. “Evidence of a crime, wrong, or\nother act is not admissible to prove a person’s character in order to show that\non a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.”\nMIL. R. EVID. 404(b)(1). But “[t]his evidence may be admissible for another\npurpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan,\nknowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident” MIL. R. EVID.\n404(b)(2).\n   In United States v. Reynolds, 29 M.J. 105 (C.M.A. 1989), the Court of\nMilitary Appeals articulated a three-part test for the admissibility of\nuncharged misconduct, including prior misconduct of which the accused was\nacquitted:\n           1. Does the evidence reasonably support a finding by the\n       court members that appellant committed prior crimes, wrongs,\n       or acts?\n          2. What “fact . . . of consequence” is made “more” or “less\n       probable” by the existence of this evidence?\n\n                                       9\n\f                    United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n            3. Is the “probative value . . . substantially outweighed by\n         the danger of unfair prejudice”?\nId. at 109 (internal citations omitted, alterations in original).\n    Although the Military Rules of Evidence and the Reynolds test, not issue\npreclusion, govern the admissibility of uncharged misconduct, the fact of an\nacquittal is still a factor in the analysis. When an accused has been acquitted\nof conduct the government seeks to present as evidence in a subsequent case,\nthat acquittal is a factor in the test for admissibility. “The fact of the prior\nacquittal may diminish the probative value of the evidence, however, and\nshould be considered by the military judge when determining whether\n‘probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair\nprejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the members, or by\nconsiderations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of\ncumulative evidence.’” Hicks, 24 M.J. at 9 (quoting MIL. R. EVID. 403). An\naccused also has the right to prove that he or she was previously acquitted of\nthe acts admitted into evidence under MIL. R. EVID. 404(b). United States v.\nCuellar, 27 M.J. 50, 56 (C.M.A. 1988). While issue preclusion is not a sword\nat the appellant’s disposal in this case, does he nonetheless deserve the\nbenefit of his purported acquittal of an issue of ultimate fact at his first court-\nmartial? Our superior court has not prohibited us from querying whether we\ncan extrapolate an acquittal from prior findings. To begin to answer whether\nthat purported acquittal affects the admissibility of related evidence, we must\nconsider the proffered acquittal.\n   4. Proffered acquittal of conspiring to kill anyone other than S.G.\n    As part of his motion in limine to suppress evidence of uncharged\nmisconduct, the appellant asserted that the findings of his first court-martial\nindicated an acquittal of an issue of ultimate fact. Based on specific\ninstructions to the members and their not guilty findings to housebreaking,\nkidnapping, and conspiring to commit them, the appellant asserted that the\nmembers must have concluded that (1) the appellant did not order his\nMarines to seize anyone other than suspected insurgency leader and HVI,\nS.G.; (2) the appellant believed that the individual seized was S.G.; and (3)\nthe appellant was not responsible for his squad members going to a house\nand seizing an unknown Iraqi man (who was not S.G.).8 TDC exhorted the\nmilitary judge to examine the findings and exceptions made by the members\nat his first trial to confirm that they resolved this issue in the appellant’s\nfavor. Citing collateral estoppel, the appellant sought to exclude evidence\nthat the appellant conspired to kill anyone other than S.G.\n\n\n   8   AE XCVIII at 6-7.\n\n\n                                        10\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n   a. Not an issue of ultimate fact in the case before us\n    Whom the appellant conspired to kill was central to the government’s\ntheme and theory at both trials but was not an issue of ultimate fact at his\nsecond court-martial. The conspiracy specification did not name the victim\nthe appellant and his co-conspirators agreed to murder. Whether the man\nshot by the IED crater was the same man the appellant intended to kill was\nnot critical to a finding of guilty for murder. As the military judge instructed\nthe members, in cases of mistake or carelessness, “the intent to kill or inflict\nbodily harm is transferred in the intended victim of [the accused’s] action to\nthe actual victim.”9 And for the same reasons, the identity of the appellant’s\nintended victim was not essential to the other charges referred to his second\ncourt-martial. With no pending charges dependent upon whom the appellant\nagreed to kidnap and kill, there is no issue of ultimate fact.\n    Without the required issue of ultimate fact at the pending court-martial,10\nwe can find no abuse of discretion in the military judge’s apparent decision\nnot to explore the findings and record of the first court-martial for the\npurported acquittal. The military judge made no written findings of fact or\nconclusions of law in response to the appellant’s request that he examine the\nfirst record of trial but said “[t]here is no requirement to speculate on the\nrationale on the last panel of members. In fact it’s folly to try to do that.”11\n    Though there appears to be no requirement to mine a prior record of trial\nfor acquittal of an issue of less than ultimate fact, our superior court has not\nprohibited it. The analysis and conclusion of acquittal exemplified in Ashe is\na preliminary step that may, but need not, result in issue preclusion. Even\nwith issue preclusion off the table, the existence of an acquittal remains\nrelevant to admission of evidence under the Military Rules of Evidence and\nReynolds. For that reason, we believe the appellant’s proffered acquittal\ndeserves our consideration.\n   b. Findings of the appellant’s first court-martial\n    The first panel of members returned mixed, and to some extent\ninconsistent,12 findings. Those findings are summarized below:\n    Charge I: Conspiracy - Guilty of one specification of conspiracy to commit\nlarceny, false official statements, murder, and obstruction of justice; but not\n\n\n   9   Record at 2276.\n   10   See Ashe, 397 U.S. at 443; Dowling, 493 U.S. at 348, discussed supra.\n   11   Record at 778.\n   12 As previously stated, the appellant’s acquittal of premeditated murder and\nconviction of conspiracy to commit murder are irreconcilably inconsistent.\n\n\n                                           11\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nguilty of conspiracy to commit housebreaking and kidnapping and excepting\nfour of 21 overt acts effecting the conspiracy.13\n    Charge II: False Official Statement - Guilty of one specification of false\nofficial statement for a written statement made on 28 April 2006; but not\nguilty of a second false official statement for the 8 May 2006 interview with\nthe NCIS Special Agents.\n   Charge III: Premeditated Murder - Not guilty of premeditated murder,\nbut guilty of the lesser included offense of unpremeditated murder of an\nunknown Iraqi man;\n   Charge IV: Larceny - Guilty of one specification of larceny;\n   Charges V, VI, and VII - Not guilty of assault consummated by battery,\nhousebreaking, kidnapping, and obstruction of justice.14\n   The appellant contends, “[t]he removal of housebreaking and kidnapping\nas predicate offenses to the conspiracy charge indicate that the members\nfound, as ultimate facts, that the conspiracy was only to kill [S.G.], and did\nnot include any plans for alternate victims.”15\n   c. Examination of the record of the prior proceeding\n   Our review of the record of the appellant’s first court-martial aligns\nsubstantially with the appellant’s account and conclusions regarding the\nmeaning of the appellant’s prior acquittal of housebreaking and kidnapping.\n     From their opening statements, trial counsel (TC) and TDC at the first\ncourt-martial presented conflicting theories of whom the appellant and his\nsquad members conspired to kill on 25 and 26 April 2006. The government\npreviewed their three-pronged conspiracy theory—“plan ‘A’, get [S.G.], plan\n‘B’, get a brother, or plan ‘C’, get somebody[.]”16 According to the government,\nthe evidence would show that the appellant, Cpls Magincalda and Thomas,\n\n\n   13  The four excepted overt acts were: (1) Cpl Magincalda, Cpl Thomas, LCpl\nPennington, and HM3 Bacos walking from S.G.’s house to the home of an unknown\nIraqi and Cpl Magincalda and Cpl Thomas entering the house; (2) Cpl Magincalda\nand Cpl Thomas taking an unknown Iraqi man from his house against his will; (3)\nthe appellant’s false statements to Staff Sergeant O.B. on 26 April 2006 regarding\nthe facts and circumstances of the unknown Iraqi man’s death; and (4) the\nappellant’s false statements to Special Agents J.C. and S.L., Naval Criminal\nInvestigative Service, on 8 May 2006 regarding the facts and circumstances of the\nunknown Iraqi man’s death.\n   14   First trial record, charge sheet and findings worksheet (AE CXXIV).\n   15   Appellant’s Brief at 27.\n   16   First trial record at 1015.\n\n\n                                          12\n\f                       United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nand LCpl Pennington spent an hour and a half deliberating and developing a\nplan for four squad members to walk to the home of S.G., seize him, bring\nhim about a kilometer to a crater formed by an IED, disturb the dirt with a\nstolen shovel so it appeared S.G. was trying to plant a new IED, stage a\nfirefight with a stolen AK-47, and kill S.G. That was Plan A.\n            Plan “B” is, Hey, if we can’t get [S.G.], let’s get one of his\n         brothers, grab somebody from his house because we want to\n         send a message. And as they talk about plan “B”, then they\n         say, What if we can’t get into the house?\n            Sergeant Hutchins tells them, Get someone else. Bring\n         somebody back here tonight. We need to send a message. So\n         they move from plan “B” to plan “C” to get somebody. Get\n         somebody.17\nIn response to the government’s opening statement, the appellant’s TDC\nfocused the members on command pressure to eliminate S.G., a “high value\ntarget,”18 and challenged the existence of a three-prong conspiracy. TDC\nasserted that the appellant believed the man he shot at the IED crater was\nS.G.\n    Five members of the appellant’s squad testified at his first court-martial.\nThe refrain of a single plan repeated throughout their testimony—“To get\n[S.G.], bring him down to the IED hole, and shoot and kill him, sir.”19\nAccording to LCpl Pennington and HM3 Bacos, the only two of the original\nplanners to testify, they originally discussed storming S.G.’s house and\nkilling him there, in what would look like a mujahedeen attack. Then they\nconsidered commandeering a car and using that to drive S.G. from his home\nto the IED crater. But they discarded these ideas in favor of a four-man\n“snatch team” seizing S.G. from his home and bringing him, on foot, to the\nIED crater.\n    Testimony about a substitute for S.G. was not consistent. When TC asked\nLCpl Jackson what would happen if the snatch team could not seize S.G., he\nresponded, “[t]hey would get a relative of his or any other male in the house,\nsir.”20 TC did not pose the question to PFC Jodka, but in response to a\nquestion from a member, PFC Jodka specifically refuted any suggestion that\nthe appellant planned to seize one of S.G.’s family members. PFC Jodka\ntestified, “The plan was to get [S.G.] personally because he was the insurgent,\n\n   17   Id. at 1014.\n   18   Id. at 1031.\n   19   Id. at 1127.\n   20   Id. at 1125.\n\n\n                                         13\n\f                       United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nand that he was the one that we were going to put in this IED hole, that it\nwasn’t just anybody, sir.”21 On cross-examination, TDC asked LCpl Shumate\nif the plan involved killing anyone other than S.G., and LCpl Shumate\nreplied, “Not that I can think of, sir.”22\n     LCpl Pennington and HM3 Bacos testified differently. According to LCpl\nPennington, “[i]f we were compromised at the [S.G.] house and couldn’t go\ninside without everyone knowing we were there, we would move on to\nanother house where we would get another military age male.”23 LCpl\nPennington conceded to TDC that “it would have been a significant departure\n. . . to grab somebody else” and “[i]t would have defeated the whole purpose\nnot to grab [S.G.].”24 HM3 Bacos also testified to Plans B and C:\n         [W]e were tasked out to go retrieve an AK-47 and shovel from a\n         nearby house, stash it somewhere, go patrol to [S.G.]’s house.\n             If not—if we couldn’t get [S.G.] because someone saw us in\n         the family, we would go try getting someone else, anyone, and\n         then walk that military-aged male—it was going to be a male—\n         down to the IED hole with the AK-47 and shovel, disturb the\n         dirt, make it look like he was digging and make it look like he\n         is doing a terrorist act.25\nHM3 Bacos remembered hearing the appellant say, “someone was going to\ndie tonight[.]”26\n    The appellant did not testify on the merits at his first court-martial, but\nthe statement he gave to Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) on 19\nMay 2006 went to the members as Prosecution Exhibit (PE) 1.27 In his\nstatement, the appellant acknowledged a back-up plan to seize and kill one of\nS.G.’s brothers if S.G. were not home. Amidst all the discussion, he\nremembered Cpl Thomas singing lyrics from a rap song “Somebody’s gonna\ndie tonight.” According to the plan, the snatch team would bind S.G.’s hands\nwith flexible handcuffs, gag him, and walk him to the IED crater. When Cpl\n\n   21   Id. at 1203.\n   22   Id. at 1265.\n   23   Id. at 1337.\n   24   Id. at 1379.\n   25   Id. at 1406.\n   26   Id. at 1410.\n   27 The CAAF subsequently held that NCIS obtained this statement from the\nappellant in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination and,\naccordingly, set aside his convictions. Hutchins IV, 72 M.J. at 299-300.\n\n\n                                         14\n\f                       United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nThomas and Cpl Magincalda called the appellant on his personal radio\nreceiver and told him they had “him,” the appellant thought they were\nreferring to S.G.28 Not until after the shooting, when he approached the body,\ndid the appellant realize they had killed another Iraqi man, not S.G. HM3\nBacos’s testimony corroborated a radio exchange between the snatch team\nand the appellant as the snatch team approached the IED crater. “I\nremember Corporal Thomas saying that Sergeant Hutchins wanted to see the\nman, to bring the man to the tree. But Corporal Magincalda disagreed and\nsaid, ‘No, we’re not going to do that, let’s just stick with the plan.’”29 On cross-\nexamination, TDC confirmed with HM3 Bacos that the appellant wanted to\nsee the man with them, but Cpl Magincalda objected.30\n    In his closing argument, TC acknowledged the discrepancies in the\ntestimony about plans A, B, and C but argued that the appellant planned to\nkidnap and kill not S.G., but somebody. “They couldn’t get [S.G.] or one of his\nbrothers, so they got somebody. They got somebody, because somebody was\ngoing to die tonight.”31 TDC closed by inviting the members’ attention to what\nHM3 Bacos overheard on the radio between the appellant and the two\ncorporals to dispute the government’s assertion that he planned to kidnap\nand kill anyone other than S.G. Throughout the trial, the government and\nTDC advocated conflicting positions about whom the appellant conspired to\nkill by the IED crater on 26 April 2006.\n    As the appellant was not a member of the snatch team, the government\nrelied on both principal and co-conspirator liability32 to prosecute him for\nmany of the offenses charged—larceny, housebreaking, kidnapping, and\nassault consummated by battery actually carried out by the snatch team\nmembers. TC ended his closing argument with a preview of the legal concept\nfor members. The military judge instructed the members on principal liability\nof those who aid, abet, command, counsel, or procure an offense, and co-\nconspirator liability, when the offense is committed in furtherance of the\nconspiracy.\n   Prompted by evidence presented during the court-martial, the military\njudge also instructed the members about a possible mistake of fact defense\nwith regard to the appellant’s authority to detain S.G., a high value target.\n\n\n   28   First trial record, PE 1 at 7.\n   29   Id. at 1422.\n   30   Id. at 1449.\n   31   Id. at 1726.\n   32 See MANUAL FOR COURTS-MARTIAL, UNITED STATES (2005 ed.), Part IV, ¶¶\n77b(2)(b) and 81c(5).\n\n\n                                         15\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n“If the accused at the time of the offense was under the mistaken belief that\nhe was authorized to detain [S.G.] at any time, then he cannot be found guilty\nof the offense of housebreaking.”33 “Now, the accused is not guilty of the\noffense of kidnapping if: First, he mistakenly believed he had the authority to\ndetain [S.G.] at any time, and; Second, if such belief on his part was\nreasonable.”34\n    In light of these instructions, the evidence, and counsel’s arguments, the\nfindings of not guilty of housebreaking, kidnapping, and conspiracy to commit\nthem along with the exception of the overt acts of walking to an unknown\nIraqi man’s house, entering the house, and taking the man from his home\nagainst his will, support the appellant’s proffered acquittal. We are not\npersuaded by the government’s argument that the appellant could have\nreasonably expected an Iraqi to open his home to a knock in the middle of the\nnight and voluntarily accompany American troops. But for the squad’s legal\nauthority to arrest and detain high value targets such as S.G., the plan\nrequired housebreaking and kidnapping.35 The mistake of fact defense\nregarding the authority to detain applied only to S.G.; no one else was\nidentified as a high value target. To borrow language from Ashe, “the record\nis utterly devoid of any indication that the first jury could rationally have\nfound that” housebreaking and kidnapping of an unknown Iraqi man “had\nnot occurred, or that” the unknown Iraqi man “had not been a victim of”\nhousebreaking and kidnapping. 397 U.S. at 445.\n    With regard to the appellant’s liability for committing housebreaking and\nkidnapping, “[t]he single rationally conceivable issue in dispute before the\njury was whether” the appellant had conspired to enter the home of S.G. and\nseize him or to break into the home of someone else to kidnap someone other\nthan S.G. Id. “And the jury by its verdict found” that the appellant had not\nconspired to break into the home of anyone other than S.G. or kidnap anyone\nother than S.G. Id. The members demonstrated they understood both\n\n\n   33   First trial record at 1789.\n   34   Id.\n    35 The elements of housebreaking are: “(1) That the accused unlawfully entered a\n\ncertain building or structure of a certain other person; and (2) That the unlawful\nentry was made with the intent to commit a criminal offense therein.” MANUAL FOR\nCOURTS-MARTIAL, UNITED STATES (2005 ed.), Part IV, ¶ 56.b. The elements of\nkidnapping are: (1) That the accused seized, confined, inveigled, decoyed, or carried\naway a certain person; (2) That the accused then held such person against that\nperson’s will; (3) That the accused did so willfully and wrongfully; and (4) That,\nunder the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to the prejudice of good\norder and discipline in the armed forces or was of a nature to bring discredit upon the\narmed forces. Id., Part IV, ¶ 92.b.\n\n\n                                          16\n\f                       United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\ntheories of liability by convicting the appellant of stealing an AK-47 and\nshovel he never touched. Their decision to acquit the appellant of\nhousebreaking and kidnapping demonstrates that the members believed the\nmistake of fact defense applied, and the conspiracy was to get and kill S.G.\n   Again, we find no abuse of discretion in the military judge’s failure to\nconclude that the appellant was acquitted of conspiring to kill anyone but\nS.G., but we will include this among the acquitted acts of misconduct as we\nproceed with analysis of the ruling on admission of evidence.\n    5. Military judge’s ruling on motion to suppress evidence\n    In advance of his second trial, the appellant moved “to exclude evidence\nand testimony regarding conduct that was the subject of the members’ ‘not\nguilty’ findings” at his first trial.36 Specifically, the appellant sought to\nexclude evidence of premeditated murder, housebreaking, kidnapping, and a\nfalse official statement to NCIS agents regarding the placement of a shovel or\nAK-47 near the deceased.37 The evidence to be suppressed was presented\ncategorically and not delineated as physical exhibits, statements, or excerpts\nof statements. At the time of the motion, both parties anticipated that the\nappellant’s former squad mates might testify to much of this evidence.\nUltimately and unexpectedly, the government relied on transcripts of the\nprior court-martial testimony of four of the squad members, and the\nappellant objected to numerous excerpts of that prior testimony relating to\nacquitted offenses.\n   In a ruling from the bench, the military judge denied the appellant’s\nmotion to suppress evidence.\n               The motion to suppress is denied. There is no requirement\n          to speculate on the rationale of the last panel of members. In\n          fact, it’s folly to try to do that. The real risk of confusing them\n          is if we try to parse the facts as proposed by the defense\n          counsel. Misconduct can violate more than one article of the\n          UCMJ and the conduct alleged in Paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of\n          the defense motion are not mutually exclusive to the charges of\n          which the accused was acquitted.38\n\n\n    36   AE XCVIII at 1.\n    37   Id. at 5-7.\n    38Record at 778. Paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) referred, respectively, to “Evidence of\n‘Premeditation,’” “Evidence of Kidnapping and Housebreaking,” and “Evidence of\nFalse Statements to NCIS About Underlying Facts.” AE XCVIII at 5-7. As previously\nstated, the appellant’s AOE focuses, almost exclusively, on the evidence in paragraph\n(b), housebreaking and kidnapping. We will confine our analysis to housebreaking\n\n\n                                           17\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n    This statement of the military judge issued contemporaneously with his\ndenial of the appellant’s motion to suppress constitutes the sum total of the\nrecord reflective of the military judge’s reasoning in support of his ruling. The\nrecord includes no explicit findings of fact or conclusions of law or any other\nexplanation or justification in support of the military judge’s ruling. In the\ncontext of the pleadings and argument during the surrounding Article 39(a),\nUCMJ, hearing, we can glean two findings of fact from the military judge’s\nruling and simultaneous comments.\n    First, the military judge apparently found that the evidence of which the\nappellant had been acquitted applied to other charges pending before the\ncourt. Early in the Article 39(a), UCMJ, session, the military judge posed to\ncivilian defense counsel that conduct “can cut across more than one article of\nthe UCMJ.”39 And “[w]hy can’t the underlying conduct, if it applies to other\ncharges, still come in?”40 Neither the TC nor the military judge specified the\npending charges to which the underlying misconduct applied. But in their\nresponse to the motion to suppress, the government “opine[d] that these acts\ndemonstrate the accused’s preparation, intent, lack of mistake or accident,\nand plan to execute the offense for which he is charged and escape culpability\nand suspicion for the charged offenses.”41\n    In his second finding of fact, the military judge concluded that\nsuppression of evidence of housebreaking, kidnapping, and the detour to the\nhome of the unknown Iraqi man would leave the members confused. TC, in\ntheir response to the defense motion, asserted that, “[c]ourts should decline\nany invitation [to] create an artificial gap in the witness’s narrative that will\nleave the fact-finder confused and uninformed.”42 The prospect of confused\nmembers resonated with the military judge, who then challenged the civilian\ndefense counsel on censoring from witnesses’ testimony how they transported\nthe Iraqi man from his home to the IED crater and “how he got in—allegedly\ngot into the IED hole.”43 TC then invoked the MIL. R. EVID. 403 balancing test\nand warned that “to simply omit those facts of the housebreaking and the\nkidnapping, to simply omit those facts, that is what would confuse the\n\n\n\n\nand kidnapping and the underlying facts necessarily resolved by acquittal of those\ntwo charges.\n   39   Record at 768.\n   40   Id.\n   41   AE XCIX at 10.\n   42   Id. at 8.\n   43   Record at 770.\n\n\n                                       18\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nmembers.”44 From the argument on the record, we can conclude that the\nmilitary judge found that excising uncharged misconduct of which the\nappellant had been acquitted from testimony would confuse the members,\nand admitting it was necessary to prevent that confusion.\n    We presume the military judge knows the law and correctly applies it,\nunless the record in this case suggests otherwise. See United States v.\nErickson, 65 M.J. 221, 225 (C.A.A.F. 2007) (holding that “[m]ilitary judges\nare presumed to know the law and to follow it absent clear evidence to the\ncontrary”). However, if the military judge analyzed the evidence of prior\nmisconduct in accordance with MIL. R. EVID. 401, 403, or 404(b) or the three-\npart Reynolds test,45 he did not so articulate on the record. Aside from the\nnecessity for a coherent narrative, TC did not volunteer and the military\njudge did not solicit the probative value of the evidence. The military judge\ndid not acknowledge how the appellant’s prior acquittal impacted its\nprobative value, and he was silent as to any potential prejudice.\n   In his instructions to the members, the military judge provided the\nstandard MIL. R. EVID. 404(b) instruction regarding acquitted offenses and\nadded:\n         I remind you again that the accused was acquitted at a prior\n         proceeding of the offenses of kidnapping, housebreaking,\n         assault, obstruction of justice, premeditated murder, and false\n         official statement on or about 8 May, as well as conspiracy to\n         commit kidnapping and housebreaking. You may therefore\n         consider evidence that the accused may have been involved in\n         plans or acts involving entering the alleged victim’s home,\n         moving him to another location, involvement in a shooting, and\n         providing a statement to NCIS on or about 8 May for the\n         limited purpose of its tendency, if any, to prove a plan or design\n         of the accused to commit the charged acts.46\n   Given the absence of any substantive findings or analysis by the military\njudge, we will conduct our own Reynolds analysis.\n   6. Application of the Reynolds test\n    The appellant moved to suppress evidence of the offenses of which he had\nbeen acquitted: conspiracy to commit housebreaking and kidnapping, false\nofficial statement for the 8 May 2006 interview with NCIS, premeditated\n\n\n   44   Id. at 776.\n   45   29 M.J. at 109.\n   46   Record at 2285-86.\n\n\n                                        19\n\f                  United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nmurder, obstruction of justice, assault consummated by battery,\nhousebreaking, and kidnapping. In addition, we analyze the admissibility of\nevidence to conspire to kill anyone other than S.G.\n   a. Support of prior crimes, wrongs, or acts\n    Evidence in the form of direct testimony from multiple former squad\nmates reasonably supports findings that the appellant instigated, advised,\ncounseled, encouraged, and conspired to commit the offenses of which he was\nacquitted, including, as a contingency, conspiring to kill someone other than\nS.G. See Reynolds, 29 M.J. at 109. In particular, through their testimony at\nthe first court-martial, snatch team members LCpl Pennington and HM3\nBacos recounted the carefully considered and crafted plan to enter a home,\nseize S.G. or a substitute, transport him to the IED crater, kill him, and stage\nthe incident to look like a legitimate firefight. They both testified to the\ncontingency plan to seize one of S.G.’s relatives or any Iraqi man if they could\nnot get S.G. LCpl Pennington and HM3 Bacos then provided consistent, step-\nby-step accounts of the execution of that plan, including the actual\nhousebreaking, kidnapping, and assault consummated by battery. The other\njunior squad members corroborated the plan to obstruct justice with details of\nthe carefully staged scene. All of this testimony contradicted the appellant’s\ninitial accounts of discovering and engaging an insurgent digging a hole in\nwhich to bury an IED and suggests deceit and false official statement. This\nfirst factor inures to the admission of the evidence.\n   b. Probability of facts of consequence\n    Evidence that the appellant instigated, advised, encouraged, and\nconspired to commit the acquitted offenses and that they were committed in\nfurtherance of that conspiracy makes it more probable that the death of an\nunknown Iraqi man in Hamdaniyah on 26 April 2006 was the result of a\nconspiracy the appellant hatched and led. Id. The granularity of detail\nevident in the testimony about conspiring to enter the home of S.G. and seize\nhim—or someone else, to kill S.G., and to cover it up made it more probable\nthat the larceny and murder were also products of the same deliberate and\ncomprehensive planning process. Evidence of all the actions taken to carry\nout the plan made it more probable that the squad members and the\nappellant had committed to the plan’s goal of a killing in an IED crater.\nFinally, evidence that the appellant and the snatch team members\nconsidered a contingency such as S.G.’s absence from his home and the\nidentification of a substitute victim made it more probable that the fatal\nshooting was both intentional and wrongful.\n\n\n\n\n                                      20\n\f                  United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n   c. Does the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweigh the\nprobative value?\n    First, we consider the probative value of evidence of the acquitted\noffenses. Id. As the government argued, the primary probative value was\nnarrative cohesion. A cohesive narrative revealed a well-thought out plan\nindicating preparation, intent, and lack of mistake or accident.\n    As for unfair prejudice that might substantially outweigh probative value,\nthe appellant submits very little. Relying on suppression by issue preclusion,\nTDC did not address the Reynolds factors or Military Rules of Evidence in\ntheir motion. The parties discussed the MIL. R. EVID. 403 balancing test only\nwith regard to evidence of housebreaking and kidnapping and the confusion\nof extracting part of the narrative. To complete our analysis, we consider the\npotential prejudice of evidence of acquitted misconduct.\n   Prejudice from evidence of premeditated murder, obstruction of justice,\nand the 8 May 2006 false official statement was minimal. The appellant had\nbeen acquitted of committing those offenses but convicted of conspiring to\ncommit them. Evidence of the completed offenses was essentially\nindistinguishable from evidence of conspiracy to commit them and thus\npresented little, if any, danger of unfair prejudice.\n   As for evidence of housebreaking, kidnapping, and the conspiracy to\ncommit them, their absence would have likely been conspicuous to members.\nSome members may have independently understood the authority to seize\nand detain high value targets, but there might not have been an instruction\nexplaining the legal distinction. Faced with a logical gap in the narrative, the\nmembers may have assumed details similar to, or more aggravating than,\nwhat the evidence revealed. Suppressing the evidence may have done little to\nreduce prejudice.\n    More important, the evidence of housebreaking and kidnapping was\nembedded in the larger narrative. The consistent eyewitness testimony of one\nco-conspirator after another compounded the evidence of both conspiracy to\ncommit murder and murder itself. There was little danger of conviction based\non character evidence stemming from the housebreaking and kidnapping that\npreceded the murder. Inclusion of evidence explaining how the unknown\nIraqi civilian arrived at the IED crater was therefore not unduly prejudicial.\n   With regard to the appellant’s agreement to kill anyone other than S.G.,\nthe appellant fell short of articulating unfair prejudice that might have\noutweighed probative value. Evidence of Plans B and C, conspiracy to commit\nsomeone other than S.G., is undeniably probative of a conspiracy to commit\nmurder and the ultimate murder of an unknown Iraqi man. The appellant’s\n\n\n\n\n                                      21\n\f                       United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nacquittal of these two plans does diminish their probative value but likely not\nin an appreciable way.\n    Nevertheless, the potential prejudice loomed large. The counsel\nprosecuting the appellant’s second court-martial resurrected and recycled the\nconspiracy to kill a random Iraqi as the government’s “theory of\nprosecution.”47 Sounding remarkably like his predecessor seven years earlier,\nTC in the appellant’s second trial began his opening statement with:\n“Sergeant Hutchins had a perfect plan, a perfect plan to commit a murder\nand send a message. Sergeant Hutchins was the mastermind of the plan, and\nhis squad executed.”48 The prosecutor quickly referred to “a plan to drag\nsomeone out of their bed in the middle of the night and kill them.”49 Then he\nlaid out “Plan A, get [S.G.]. Plan B, get [S.G.’s] brothers . . . Plan C, you get\nany Iraqi male . . . you get any Iraqi male because this town is going to get\nthe message.”50 TC then repeated Plan A, Plan B, Plan C. As he wrapped up\nhis opening statement, the TC again referred to the appellant’s “perfect plan\nto send a message.”51 The three-prong conspiracy theory debunked at the first\ntrial reappeared as a central theory of the second trial, and the intent to kill\nsomeone and send a message was its theme. Although the charge sheet was\nsilent as to a victim of the conspiracy, the members might have been forgiven\nfor assuming the appellant was charged with conspiring to kill a random\nIraqi man.\n   Unlike in Hicks, where “the other-acts evidence was totally separate from\nthe instant offenses in time and place; was used for a limited evidentiary\npoint; did not require proof beyond a reasonable doubt; and, although\nprobative, was unnecessary to support a conviction of the instant charges[,]”\nhere, although the other-acts evidence did not require proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt and was unnecessary to conviction, it was part and parcel of\nthe instant offenses and prominently presented as the theme and theory of\nthe case. 24 M.J. at 9.\n    The government’s depiction of the appellant as someone who conspired to\nkill an innocent Iraqi civilian at random was at least arguably aggravating,\nbut it did not ultimately amount to unfair prejudice in this case. “[T]he term\n‘unfair prejudice’ in the context of [MIL. R. EVID.] 403 ‘speaks to the capacity\nof some concededly relevant evidence to lure the factfinder into declaring\n\n\n   47   Appellant’s Brief at 17, 24.\n   48   Record at 1255.\n   49   Id.\n   50   Id. at 1259.\n   51   Id. at 1265.\n\n\n                                         22\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nguilty on a ground different from proof specific to the offense charged.’”\nUnited States v. Collier, 67 M.J. 347, 354 (C.A.A.F. 2009) (quoting Old Chief\nv. United States, 519 U.S. 172 (1997)). In light of the substantial and less\ncontroverted evidence that the appellant conspired to kill S.G., the members\nwould not have needed to rely on evidence of a conspiracy to kill anyone else\nto prove the charge itself. Although Plans B and C were a contingency on\nwhich the snatch team needed to rely, evidence of Plans B and C was a\ncontingency of proof the government did not need.\n   Finally, had the appellant exercised his right to prove his acquittal of\nconspiracy to murder anyone other than S.G.,52 the diversion necessary for\ndoing so might have tipped the scales of the MIL. R. EVID. 403 balancing test.\nMIL. R. EVID. 403 (providing for the exclusion of evidence “if its probative\nvalue is substantially outweighed by the danger of . . . confusion of the issues,\nor misleading the members, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of\ntime, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.”) But this prejudice is\npurely speculative. The appellant did not attempt to prove his acquittal to the\nmembers of the second court-martial, and thus this potential prejudice never\nbecame an issue.\n   Despite the potential for unfair prejudice in the admission of evidence of a\nconspiracy to kill anyone other than S.G., that prejudice was not before the\nmilitary judge at the time he admitted the evidence. The actual prejudice did\nnot substantially outweigh the evidence’s probative value.\n    Having progressed through the three factors of the Reynolds test and\nfinding them all in favor of admission, we can find no abuse of discretion in\nthe military judge’s decision to admit the evidence of acquitted misconduct,\nincluding evidence of a conspiracy to kill anyone other than S.G. The evidence\noffered proof of motive, intent, preparation, plan, and an absence of mistake\nor accident with regard to the charges against the appellant, particularly\nconspiracy to commit murder and murder. MIL. R. EVID. 404. The probative\nvalue of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of\nunfair prejudice or other unjustified distraction from the court-martial. MIL.\nR. EVID. 403.\n   7. Prejudice\n   Even if we had found abuse of discretion on the military judge’s part in\nadmitting evidence of a conspiracy to commit Plans B and C, there was no\nactual prejudice to the appellant. “We evaluate prejudice from an erroneous\nevidentiary ruling by weighing (1) the strength of the Government’s case, (2)\nthe strength of the defense case, (3) the materiality of the evidence in\n\n\n   52   See Cuellar, 27 M.J. at 56, discussed supra.\n\n\n                                           23\n\f                  United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nquestion, and (4) the quality of the evidence in question.” United States v.\nBarnett, 63 M.J. 388, 397 (C.A.A.F. 2006) (citations and internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n    Even though the appellant’s second trial defense team did not concede his\nplan to kill S.G., the evidence of a conspiracy to kill him was overwhelming.\nThe appellant’s primary defense was that the account of the night’s events\nwas fabricated and forced upon his squad during coercive interrogations. The\nvivid, granular details the co-conspirators recounted with calm, confident\ncertainty ring with credibility. Evidence of a conspiracy to kill anyone other\nthan S.G. was material to the government’s case but of inferior quality to the\nevidence of an agreement to kill S.G. Despite the prominence the government\ngave the evidence of Plans B and C and the murderous callousness the\ngovernment presumably sought to depict in the appellant, the evidence of\nPlan A was sufficient to assuage any concerns that members needed to fall\nback on evidence of Plans B and C. With those concerns assuaged, there is no\nprejudice.\nB. Former testimony of co-conspirators\n   The appellant challenges the military judge’s ruling that certain\ngovernment witnesses were unavailable and their prior testimony was\nadmissible.\n   “So long as the military judge understood and applied the correct law, and\nthe factual findings are not clearly erroneous, neither the military judge’s\ndecision to admit evidence, nor his unavailability ruling, should be\noverturned.” United States v. Cabrera-Frattini, 65 M.J. 241, 245 (C.A.A.F.\n2007).\n    An accused’s Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him\nnormally prevents the government from admitting a witness’s former\ntestimony—testimonial evidence—without producing the witness for cross-\nexamination. See Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 51 (2004). But if the\nwitness is unavailable, and has previously been subject to the accused’s cross-\nexamination, such testimonial evidence may be admissible. Id. at 59\n(concluding that “[t]estimonial statements of witnesses absent from trial have\nbeen admitted only where the declarant is unavailable, and only where the\ndefendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine”); see also Cabrera-\nFrattini, 65 M.J. at 245.\n   1. Unavailability of witnesses\n    “The test for unavailability focuses on ‘whether the witness is not present\nin court in spite of good-faith efforts by the Government to locate and present\nthe witness.’” Cabrera-Frattini, 65 M.J. at 245 (quoting United States v.\nCokeley, 22 M.J. 225, 228 (C.M.A. 1986)). We review a military judge’s\n\n\n                                      24\n\f                   United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\ndeterminations of witness unavailability—and the government’s good faith\nefforts to produce the witness—for an abuse of discretion. Id.\n    Among the reasons for witness unavailability enumerated in MIL. R.\nEVID. 804(a) are “(1) exempt[ion] from testifying about the subject matter of\nthe declarant’s statement because the military judge rules that a privilege\napplies;” and “(2) refus[al] to testify about the subject matter despite the\nmilitary judge’s order to do so[.]” A witness may refuse to testify by invoking\nhis privilege against compulsory self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth\nAmendment and, where applicable, Article 31, UCMJ. U.S. CONST. amend V.\nTo overcome a witness’s privilege against self-incrimination and compel his\ntestimony, the government must confer testimonial immunity, as described in\nMIL. R. EVID. 301(d)(1):\n        The minimum grant of immunity adequate to overcome the\n        privilege is that which under either R.C.M. 70453 or other\n        proper authority provides that neither the testimony of the\n        witness nor any evidence obtained from that testimony may be\n        used against the witness at any subsequent trial other than in\n        a prosecution for perjury, false swearing, the making of a false\n        official statement, or failure to comply with an order to testify\n        after the military judge has ruled that the privilege may not be\n        asserted by reason of immunity.\n(emphasis added). Testimonial immunity does not protect against prosecution\nfor perjury, United States v. Swan, 45 M.J. 672, 679 (N-M. Ct. Crim. App.\n1996); that protection requires transactional immunity.54 But “[t]he\ngovernment is not required to seek transactional immunity to demonstrate a\ngood faith effort.” United States v. Trank, No. 20130742, 2013 CCA LEXIS\n985, at *16 (A. Ct. Crim. App. 2013) (citing Kastigar v. United States, 406\nU.S. 441, 453 (1972)).\n    In Trank, the alleged victim—a civilian—testified under oath at an\nArticle 32, UCMJ, preliminary hearing about sexual abuse and was subject to\ncross-examination. Id. at *5-*6. Later, she indicated through counsel that she\nintended to recant her allegation and would invoke her Fifth Amendment\nright against self-incrimination rather than testify at court-martial. Id. at *6.\nThe government obtained a grant of testimonial immunity for the alleged\nvictim from an Assistant United States Attorney and unsuccessfully sought\n\n   53RULE FOR COURTS-MARTIAL (R.C.M.) 704, MANUAL FOR COURTS-MARTIAL,\nUNITED STATES (2012 ed.) provides for grants of immunity to witnesses subject to the\nUCMJ.\n   54  See R.C.M. 704(a)(1). “A person may be granted transactional immunity from\ntrial by court-martial for one or more offenses under the [UCMJ].”\n\n\n                                        25\n\f                   United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\ntransactional immunity from the state government, but prosecutors declined\nto return to the United States Attorney for a grant of transactional\nimmunity. Id. at *7. The military judge found the alleged victim to be\nunavailable, and the Army Court of Criminal Appeals agreed that a grant of\ntransactional immunity was not required before finding a witness\nunavailable. Id. at *16.\n    In Swan, a witness testified at an Article 39(a), UCMJ, session that his\nstatement to NCIS implicating Swan was a fabrication. 45 M.J. at 679. The\ngovernment offered the witness testimonial immunity, but not transactional\nimmunity, and instead pursued perjury charges against him for his Article\n39(a), UCMJ, testimony. Id. The military judge questioned the witness about\nhis refusal to testify, determined that he had invoked his Article 31(b),\nUCMJ, rights, and declared him unavailable. Id. at 679-80. This court\naffirmed the military judge’s ruling of unavailability, finding that he “made\nsufficient inquiries to establish that [the witness] would exercise his privilege\nagainst compelled self-incrimination despite the purported grant of\nimmunity.” Id. at 680.\n    In the case before us, the government subpoenaed the appellant’s former\nsquad mates, all civilians by the time of trial, to testify for the prosecution.\nHM3 Bacos, PFC Jodka, LCpl Pennington, and LCpl Shumate took the stand\nin Article 39(a), UCMJ, sessions. Despite receiving grants of testimonial\nimmunity,55 they each invoked their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-\nincrimination, cited a fear of prosecution for perjury, and declined to comply\nwith the military judge’s order to testify. Based on this Article 39(a), UCMJ,\ntestimony, the military judge found HM3 Bacos, PFC Jodka, and LCpl\nPennington unavailable. LCpl Shumate’s Article 39(a), UCMJ, session\nfollowed the military judge’s verbal ruling that the three preceding witnesses\nwere unavailable, and he neglected to explicitly declare LCpl Shumate\nunavailable. This oversight elicited no objection from the appellant, and the\nmilitary judge simply dismissed LCpl Shumate after his Article 39, UCMJ,\ntestimony and proceeded with the admission of his prior testimony based on\nhis refusal to testify.\n    The military judge made no specific findings of fact, but he elicited from\neach of the four witnesses testimony that met the MIL. R. EVID. 804(b)(1)\ncriteria for unavailability—their intent to invoke their privilege against self-\n\n    55 AE CXXX, CXXXII-CXXXIV. HM3 Bacos, PFC Jodka, LCpl Pennington, and\n\nLCpl Shumate each received a “Grant of Testimonial Immunity and Order to Testify”\nfrom the CA under authority from the Justice Department. In return for testifying\ntruthfully, each had “immunity from the use of [his] testimony or other information\ngiven by [him] . . . except a prosecution for perjury, giving a false statement, or\notherwise failing to comply with an order to testify in these matters.”\n\n\n                                        26\n\f                  United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nincrimination to avoid testifying that they had committed perjury at the first\ncourt-martial and their refusal to testify despite being ordered to do so.\nAlthough the military judge did not elaborate on the good faith efforts of the\ngovernment to produce the witnesses, all witnesses were present and took the\nstand to confirm the circumstances that made them unavailable. The\ngovernment had procured the required grants of testimonial immunity.\nDespite the appellant’s argument that good faith required TC’s application\nfor transactional immunity, our military case law precedent is clear that only\ntestimonial immunity is necessary. The military judge’s rulings were in\naccordance with MIL. R. EVID. 804(b)(1) and Swan, which he cited as\nauthority, as well as Trank. We find no abuse of discretion with regard to the\nunavailability of HM3 Bacos, PFC Jodka, LCpl Pennington, and LCpl\nShumate.\n    Having found the four witnesses unavailable, the military judge invited\nthe government to seek admission of their testimony from the prior court-\nmartial. To determine if admission of that prior testimony were an abuse of\ndiscretion, we next look at the appellant’s opportunity to cross-examine the\nwitnesses.\n   2. Opportunity and similar motive for cross-examination\n    If a witness is unavailable, MIL. R. EVID. 804(b)(1) provides an exception\nto the rules against hearsay allowing admission of the unavailable witness’s\nformer testimony. The exception applies to testimony that “(A) was given by a\nwitness at a trial, hearing, or lawful deposition, whether given during the\ncurrent proceeding or a different one; and (B) is now offered against a party\nwho had an opportunity and similar motive to develop it by direct, cross-, or\nredirect examination.” MIL. R. EVID. 804(b)(1).\n   The appellant argues he did not have a similar motive to cross-examine\nthe four unavailable co-conspirators at his first trial.\n    Whether there was a similar motive to cross-examine a witness at a prior\nproceeding is a question of law we review de novo. Trank, 2013 CCA LEXIS\n985, at *15. The party seeking to admit prior testimony as evidence must\ndemonstrate similarity of motive. United States v. Salerno, 505 U.S. 317, 322\n(1992) (finding no exception to MIL. R. EVID. 804(b)(1)’s “similar motive”\nrequirement for admitting prior testimony). The appellant steers us to United\nStates v. DiNapoli, 8 F.3d 909 (2nd Cir. 1993), for the meaning of similar\nmotive to develop testimony. In DiNapoli, the Second Circuit composed a test\nfor what constitutes a similar motive at two proceedings: “whether the party\nresisting the offered testimony at a pending proceeding had at a prior\nproceeding an interest of substantially similar intensity to prove (or disprove)\nthe same side of a substantially similar issue.” 8 F.3d at 914-15. The\n“relevant though not conclusive” factors for comparing relative intensity of\n\n                                      27\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\ninterest are “[t]he nature of the two proceedings—both what is at stake and\nthe applicable burden of proof—and, to a lesser extent, the cross-examination\nat the prior proceeding—both what was undertaken and what was available\nbut forgone . . . .” Id. at 915.\n    The context of this analysis in DiNapoli is revealing. The party resisting\nadmission of the offered testimony was the government. Id. at 911. The two\nproceedings were a grand jury and a trial. Id. A prosecutor declined to cross-\nexamine a witness at a grand jury “in order not to reveal the identity of then\nundisclosed cooperating witnesses or the existence of then undisclosed\nwiretapped conversations that refuted [the witness’s] denials . . . .” Id. It is\nlogical to conclude that the lower stakes and burden of proof at the grand jury\nprompted the prosecutor to forego that line of cross-examination. On the\nother hand, when the nature of the two proceedings is the same—for\nexample, testimony on findings at a court-martial—the prospect of conviction\nor acquittal is the same, and the government’s burden of proof is the same. A\nshift in cross-examination strategy does little to change the intensity of the\naccused’s interest in avoiding conviction. In fact, the DiNapoli court noted\nthat “[w]here both proceedings are trials and the same matter is seriously\ndisputed at both trials, it will normally be the case that the side opposing the\nversion of a witness at the first trial had a motive to develop that witness’s\ntestimony similar to the motive at the second trial.” Id. at 912.\n    In this case, the military judge found “that the exception [MIL. R. EVID.]\n804(b)1 [sic] regarding former testimony would apply, making the former\ntestimony in this prior trial, not the other cases we’ve heard about, would\nbecome [sic] admissible if so desired by the government to introduce them.” 56\nThis ruling immediately followed the military judge’s declaration that three\nof the appellant’s squad members were unavailable as witnesses. TC did not\nfile a written motion in limine to admit the prior testimony, nor did they\nproffer the appellant’s similar motives to develop the testimony at the first\nand second courts-martial on the record. As the appellant points out, the\nmilitary judge made no findings of fact or conclusions of law regarding\nsimilarity of motive, from the bench or in writing.\n    But again, we presume the military judge knows and follows the law\nunless there is evidence to the contrary. See Erickson, 65 M.J. at 225 (holding\nthat “[m]ilitary judges are presumed to know the law and to follow it absent\nclear evidence to the contrary”). And here we find no evidence to the contrary,\nparticularly in light of our de novo review of the similarity of motives. The\ngovernment sought to introduce the prior testimony of witnesses to prove the\nsame charges against the same accused in the same forum—a contested\n\n\n   56   Record at 1528.\n\n\n                                       28\n\f                       United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\ngeneral court-martial. Even the DiNapoli court would agree that the motive\nto develop that testimony would normally be the same. 8 F.3d at 912. The\nappellant fails to rebut that expectation of similarity.\n    On the record, TDC argued that the defense team at the first trial was\nineffective. TDC further contended that “different charges pending, different\ntheories of the government and defense, and different motivations and\nstrategic decisions made by both counsel” negated the appellant’s prior\nconfrontation of the witnesses.57 In his brief, the appellant alleged that his\nfirst trial defense counsel team “explicitly conceded nearly all of the charged\noffenses.”58 But all of the charges referred to the appellant’s second court-\nmartial were also referred to his first court-martial. Housebreaking and\nkidnapping fell off the charge sheet, and premeditated murder became\nunpremeditated murder, but the appellant was still accused of murder and\nconspiracy to commit murder. The appellant pleaded not guilty to all charges\non both occasions. TDC offered no evidence that the intensity of the\nappellant’s interest in fighting for his life against murder charges differed\nfrom one trial to the next. “A shift in the theory of the case does not defeat\nadmissibility when the underlying liability remains the same, thereby\nguaranteeing cross-examination with the same purpose . . . .” 5-804\nWeinstein’s Federal Evidence § 804.04 (2017); see also United States v.\nAvants, 367 F.3d 433, 444 (5th Cir. 2004) (finding that, in a case where the\nappellant’s “motive was to discredit a witness . . . whose testimony could, if\nbelieved, convict him,” a change in trial strategy did not create dissimilarity\nin motive).\n    Much of the appellant’s strategy for attacking his squad mates’ testimony\nrests on their freshly sworn affidavits renouncing their previous statements\nto NCIS and earlier testimony as coerced and false. Nevertheless, the\ndiscovery of new evidence useful to cross-examining a witness does not inject\ndissimilarity into the comparison of motives. “The ‘similar motive’\nrequirement is satisfied if counsel had the opportunity to cross-examine the\nwitness without restriction on the scope of the examination even if counsel\nsubsequently discovers information which was not available at the [previous]\nhearing.” Trank, 2013 CCA LEXIS 985, *13-14 (citation omitted); see also\nUnited States v. Hubbard, 28 M.J. 27, 32 (C.M.A. 1989) (reiterating that\n“admissibility of former testimony is not precluded because, after the giving\nof that testimony, material information is obtained as to which the defense\nhad no opportunity to cross-examine the absent witness”). Nothing prevented\nthe appellant’s first trial defense counsel team from exploring the\n\n\n   57   Id. at 1642.\n   58   Appellant’s Brief at 46.\n\n\n                                         29\n\f                  United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\ncircumstances under which the squad members made their statements to\nNCIS then negotiated immunity and favorable pretrial agreements in return\nfor testifying at other courts-martial, including the appellant’s.\n    Comparing his two trial defense teams in hyperbolic terms, the appellant\ntries to elevate difference in strategy to a difference in motive. The difference\nin strategy manifested in the zeal with which the trial defense teams sought\nto discredit the squad members’ testimony. But the purported unreliability of\ntestimonial evidence alone will not prevent its admission, even under MIL. R.\nEVID. 804(b)(1). Our superior court has declined to suppress testimonial\nevidence based on credibility concerns alone because “factual reliability does\nnot have to be established as a prerequisite for admitting hearsay evidence\npursuant to a well-recognized hearsay exceptions.” See Hubbard, 28 M.J. at\n33.\n    While we have no findings of fact from the military judge, the appellant\ndoes not dispute that his first defense counsel team had the opportunity to\ncross-examine all four witnesses later declared unavailable. The charges the\nappellant faced at his first court-martial and his not guilty pleas are not\nsubject to debate. The appellant has not introduced evidence sufficient to\novercome those undisputed facts. The military judge also cited the correct\nrule, MIL. R. EVID. 804(b)(1), in admitting the testimonial evidence, and his\nruling does not run afoul of the appellant’s preferred legal standard in\nDiNapoli: “whether the party resisting the offered testimony at a pending\nproceeding had at a prior proceeding an interest of substantially similar\nintensity to prove (or disprove) the same side of a substantially similar issue.”\n8 F.3d at 914-15. Finding interests of substantially similar intensity at both\ncourts-martial to dispute a substantially similar set of testimony and\ndisprove a substantially similar set of charges, we find no abuse of discretion\nin the military judge’s admission of the four unavailable squad members’\nformer testimony.\nC. UCI\n   The appellant alleges that public statements made by then-Secretary of\nthe Navy (SECNAV) Ray Mabus constituted UCI on the appellant’s clemency\nproceedings, appellate review, and second court-martial.\n   We review allegations of UCI de novo. United States v. Salyer, 72 M.J.\n415, 423 (C.A.A.F. 2013).\n   Article 37(a), UCMJ, prohibits unlawful influence on the military justice\nprocess by someone in a position of authority:\n       No authority convening a general, special, or summary court-\n       martial, nor any other commanding officer, may censure,\n       reprimand, or admonish the court or any member, military\n\n\n                                       30\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n         judge, or counsel thereof, with respect to the findings or\n         sentence adjudged by the court, or with respect to any other\n         exercises of its or his functions in the conduct of the\n         proceedings. No person subject to this chapter may attempt to\n         coerce or, by any unauthorized means, influence the action of a\n         court-martial or any other military tribunal or any member\n         thereof, in reaching the findings or sentence in any case, or the\n         action of any convening, approving, or reviewing authority with\n         respect to his judicial acts.\n10 U.S.C. § 837(a) (2012).\n    Interpreting Article 37, UCMJ, in light of case law explored infra, we can\ndistill something of a formula for facts constituting UCI: (1) a government\nactor (2) takes action which influences or appears to influence (3) a decision-\nmaker in the court-martial process. The affected decision-maker might be a\npotential court-martial member, CA, or military judge. In his analysis of\nalleged UCI in this very case, former Chief Judge Baker of the CAAF set out\nthe following factors in the context of a government actor making a public\nstatement: the comments’ intended audience, the intended and larger\naudience’s perception of the comments, existence of an intent to influence a\nproceeding’s outcome, the implicit or explicit threat of repercussions for\ndissent, and regardless of any intent, an effect of influencing outcome or\nactors. Hutchins IV, 72 M.J. at 313 (Baker, C.J., dissenting). These factors,\nwhile admittedly not binding, are instructive. The potential influence is\nunauthorized or unlawful because through “censure, reprimand, or\nadmonish[ment]”59 or something similar, a government actor manipulates,\ninterferes with, or improperly strips the actors in the court-martial process of\ntheir independence.\n    To show prejudice or compromise of the military justice process, a\ncomplaining party must tie these facts constituting UCI to some effect. “In\ncases involving [UCI], the key to our analysis is effect—not knowledge or\nintent” of the government actor. United States v. Boyce, 76 M.J. 242, 251\n(C.A.A.F. 2017). The effect may be actual prejudice to the complainant or the\nappearance of it. The prejudice may be unforeseen, accidental collateral\ndamage, but it nevertheless results from—or in the case of apparent UCI,\nappears to result from—governmental interference in the military justice\nprocess. See United States v. Stombaugh, 40 M.J. 208, 211 (C.A.A.F. 1994)\n(focusing on “interference with the substantial rights of the accused” in\nanalyzing allegations of UCI).\n\n\n\n   59   Art. 37(a), UCMJ.\n\n\n                                        31\n\f                   United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n   1. Actual UCI\n    “[A]ctual [UCI] has commonly been recognized as occurring when there is\nan improper manipulation of the criminal justice process which negatively\naffects the fair handling and/or disposition of a case.” Boyce, 76 M.J. at 247\n(citations omitted). An appellant has the initial burden of raising UCI by\nshowing: (1) “facts which, if true, constitute [UCI];” (2) “that the proceedings\nwere unfair;” and (3) “that UCI was the cause of the unfairness.” United\nStates v. Biagase, 50 M.J. 143, 150 (C.A.A.F. 1999). The evidentiary standard\nfor raising the issue of UCI is “some evidence.” United States v. Stoneman, 57\nM.J. 35, 41 (C.A.A.F. 2002); United States v. Ayala, 43 M.J. 296, 300\n(C.A.A.F. 1995). The appellant’s burden of proof is low, but it must be more\nthan mere allegations or speculation. Stoneman, 57 M.J. at 41. The\nappearance of evil is not enough to justify action by an appellate court in a\nparticular case or, said another way, “[p]roof of command influence in the air”\nwill not suffice. Stombaugh, 40 M.J. at 213 (internal quotation marks\nomitted) (alteration in original).\n   If the appellant raises some evidence of UCI the burden shifts to the\ngovernment to rebut the allegation by persuading the court, beyond a\nreasonable doubt, that: (1) the predicate facts do not exist; (2) the facts do not\nconstitute UCI; (3) the UCI did not affect the findings or sentence; or (4) if on\nappeal, by persuading the appellate court that the UCI had no prejudicial\nimpact on the court-martial. Salyer, 72 M.J. at 423; Biagase, 50 M.J. at 151.\n   2. Apparent UCI\n     “Even if there [is] no actual [UCI], there may be a question whether the\ninfluence of command placed an ‘intolerable strain on public perception of the\nmilitary justice system.’” Stoneman, 57 M.J. at 42-43 (quoting United States\nv. Wiesen, 56 M.J. 172, 175 (C.A.A.F. 2001)). Unlike actual UCI, which\nrequires prejudice to the accused, “no such showing is required for a\nmeritorious claim of an appearance of [UCI]. Rather, the prejudice involved . .\n. is the damage to the public’s perception of the fairness of the military justice\nsystem as a whole[.]” Boyce, 76 M.J. at 248. An appellant raises a claim of\napparent UCI by demonstrating (1) “facts, which if true, constitute [UCI];”\nand (2) that “this [UCI] placed an ‘intolerable strain’ on the public’s\nperception of the military justice system because ‘an objective, disinterested\nobserver, fully informed of all the facts and circumstances, would harbor a\nsignificant doubt about the fairness of the proceeding.’” Id. at 249 (quoting\nUnited States v. Lewis, 63 M.J. 405, 415 (C.A.A.F. 2006)). As with actual UCI,\nthe appellant must show “some evidence” greater than “mere allegation or\nspeculation.” Biagase, 50 M.J. at 150. Some evidence of UCI will again shift\nthe burden to the government to disprove one prong or the other beyond a\nreasonable doubt. Boyce, 76 M.J. at 249-250.\n\n\n                                       32\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n   With this framework for analyzing UCI in mind, we turn to the facts of\nthe case before us.\n   3. SECNAV’s statements to the media\n    The appellant identifies SECNAV as the singular source of the UCI\nallegedly impacting him. It appears SECNAV became personally involved in\nthe appellant’s case two years after his first court-martial. The appellant\napproached some of his congressional representatives and requested they\nsolicit clemency from SECNAV on his behalf.60 As later reported in the\nmedia, SECNAV reviewed the records of the Hamdaniyah courts-martial,\ndenied the appellant’s request for clemency, and ordered that his four most\njunior squad members be administratively separated from the Marine Corps\nand Navy and that the squad lieutenant be ordered to show cause why he\nshould remain in the Marine Corps.\n   These were acts outside the court-martial process and within SECNAV’s\nauthority. Administrative separation is not an authorized court-martial\npunishment.61 SECNAV was and is the highest separation authority in the\nMarine Corps and the Navy.62 We will discuss SECNAV’s role and authority\nin granting clemency below. But it is SECNAV’s public announcement of\nthese administrative actions and his reasons for them that form the basis of\nthe appellant’s UCI claims.\n    In November 2009, SECNAV gave interviews about his recent\nadministrative actions regarding the appellant and other members of his\nsquad implicated in the killing at Hamdaniyah. The appellant attached two\nof the resulting news articles to his Motion to Dismiss for UCI: one printed in\nThe Marine Corps Times and one printed in The North County Times, a San\nDiego regional newspaper.63 From the newspaper articles, we can conclude\nthat SECNAV’s audience was Marines, the Marine Corps community, and\nspecifically, the community surrounding Camp Pendleton, California.\n   One article quoted SECNAV on his reasons for denying the appellant’s\nclemency request: “‘I thought that it was a sentence commensurate with the\n\n\n   60   AE LXXXVIII at 78.\n   61   R.C.M. 1003(b)(8).\n   62  See Marine Corps Separation and Retirement Manual at ¶¶ 1002.51, 6002.17,\n6214.1 (Ch-2, 6 Jun 2007); Naval Military Personnel Manual, Art. 1910-704 (22 Aug\n2002).\n   63  AE LXXXVIII at 74-78 (Gidget Fuentes, SecNav: No Clemency in Iraqi murder\nplot, THE MARINE CORPS TIMES, Nov. 17, 2009; Mark Walker, Navy Secretary boots 4\nPendleton troops involved in Iraqi’s killing, THE NORTH COUNTY TIMES, Nov. 17,\n2009).\n\n\n                                       33\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\ncrime,’” and “a senior Marine Corps commander’s” reduction of the appellant\nsentence from 15 years to 11 years “‘shows greatly substantial clemency\nalready.’”64 The reporter later identified that senior Marine Corps\ncommander as then-Lieutenant General James Mattis, the CA. The article\nwent on to share SECNAV’s impression of the case:\n             Mabus said he was surprised to learn that the killing was\n         “so completely premeditated, that it was not in the heat of\n         battle that not only was the action planned but the cover-up\n         was planned, and that they picked somebody at random, just\n         because he happened to be in a house that was convenient. He\n         was murdered.”\n             “It wasn’t somebody coming apart under pressure. It wasn’t\n         in the middle of action, in the middle of battle,” the [SECNAV]\n         said. “It was completely planned and completely executed. . . .\n         That was disconcerting.”65\nThe remainder of the article addressed SECNAV’s concurrent decision to\norder the administrative separations of LCpl Jackson, LCpl Shumate, PFC\nJodka, and HM3 Bacos, and his order that the squad lieutenant show cause\nwhy he should remain in the Marine Corps.\n   The second article led with SECNAV’s orders that the four junior squad\nmembers be administratively separated and that the lieutenant show cause.66\nWhile the second article reported SECNAV’s decision to deny clemency to the\nappellant, it contained no comments from SECNAV about the appellant’s\nclemency request. The reporter quoted SECNAV about the squad members\nmore generally:\n         “None of their actions lived up to the core values of the Marine\n         Corps and the Navy . . . . This was not a ‘fog of war’ case\n         occurring in the heat of battle. This was carefully planned and\n         executed, as was the cover-up. The plan was carried out exactly\n         as it had been conceived.”67\n\n\n\n\n   64   Id. at 74 (Fuentes, SecNav: No Clemency in Iraqi murder plot).\n   65   Id. at 75 (Fuentes, SecNav: No Clemency in Iraqi murder plot).\n     66 Id. at 77 (Walker, Navy Secretary boots 4 Pendleton troops involved in Iraqi’s\n\nkilling).\n   67  Id. at 77 (Walker, Navy Secretary boots 4 Pendleton troops involved in Iraqi’s\nkilling).\n\n\n                                           34\n\f                    United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nThe second reporter then quoted military law experts and two of the junior\nsquad members’ defense counsel on their reaction to the ordered\nadministrative separations.\n    SECNAV, a government actor capable of UCI,68 informed the Marine\nCorps community and the general public of administrative actions he had\ntaken toward Marines and a Sailor implicated in the killing at Hamdaniyah,\nall but one of whom had previously been convicted at court-martial. The\nquestion before this court, then, is whether SECNAV’s public\npronouncements amount to “censure, reprimand, admonish[ment]” of, or an\nattempt to threaten, coerce, or influence, another player in the court-martial\nprocess.69 As this is not the first case in which a senior official has spoken out\nabout a high visibility issue, we look at two earlier cases resulting in similar\nallegations of UCI.\n    In 1998, a Marine Corps aircraft struck cables supporting an alpine\ngondola near Aviano, Italy; all 20 people in the gondola died. See United\nStates v. Ashby, 68 M.J. 108, 112 (C.A.A.F. 2009). While a Marine Corps\nCommand Investigation Board (CIB) conducted a preliminary investigation,\n“there was intense international media coverage of the gondola incident and\nunsettled political relations between the United States and Italy.” Id. at 126.\nUpon completion of the preliminary investigation, the general officer who led\nthe CIB held a press conference announcing their findings. Id. at 127. The\ngeneral officer who ordered the investigation and would later refer charges\nagainst Ashby issued a press release announcing his agreement with the\nCIB’s conclusions. Id. One day after the Article 32, UCMJ, hearing in the\ncase, the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) told one of Ashby’s peers\nthat the “mishap crew would be disciplined if they did anything wrong and\nthat ‘if someone is guilty, they need to be punished.’” Id. Behind the scenes,\nthe CMC, CA, the CIB, and other senior officials exchanged multiple phone\ncalls about the status of the investigation and its findings. Id. at 126.\n   Citing pressure on the CIB and multiple public statements about his case\nfrom senior Marine Corps officials, Ashby raised a claim of UCI. Finding no\nactual UCI, the CAAF focused on Ashby’s speculation vice presentation of\nactual evidence:\n         His claims regarding the CIB are predicated on\n         communications between the members of the CIB and various\n\n   68 SECNAV is neither a CA nor a commanding officer, and is not subject to the\nUCMJ, thus Article 37, UCMJ, does not appear to apply to him. The CAAF’s opinion\nin Boyce, however, clearly holds that a service secretary can be the source of UCI. 76\nM.J. at 252.\n   69   Art. 37, UCMJ.\n\n\n                                         35\n\f                   United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n        senior military officers. However, he has failed to show facts\n        which, if true, would demonstrate that the CIB members were\n        wrongfully influenced.\n                                   ....\n            With regard to Ashby’s claim of [UCI] arising from the\n        other actions by senior military officials, including the\n        Commandant, Ashby has not pointed to any . . . specific facts\n        that the court-martial process was tainted by unlawful\n        command influence. Because of the highly publicized\n        international nature of the incident, it is understandable that\n        many senior military officials became publicly involved in the\n        aftermath and investigation of the accident. However, there is\n        no direct evidence that the actions of any of those officials\n        improperly influenced Ashby’s court-martial.\nId. at 128-29. Nor did the CAAF find some evidence of apparent UCI in the\npublic statements. Id. at 129.\n    While not necessarily an international incident, the issue of sexual\nassault was one of the highest visibility issues in the military in 2012. The\nCMC embarked on a four-month tour of Marine Corps installations,\ndelivering what was coined the “Heritage Brief” to as many Marine officers\nand staff noncommissioned officers as he could reach. United States v.\nHowell, 2014 CCA LEXIS 321, at *3 (N-M. Ct. Crim. App. 22 May 2014). In\nthe brief, the CMC stressed the legitimacy of 80% of sexual assault claims\nand the underreporting of sexual assaults. Id. at *6-*7. He expressed his deep\ndisappointment in Marine Corps court-martial members, among others, for\nbecoming soft and retaining Marines who commit misconduct instead of\nholding them accountable and getting rid of them. Id. at *7-*8. Howell’s\ncourt-martial for sexual assault was pending at Parris Island, South\nCarolina, when the CMC delivered the Heritage Brief there, id. at *3-*4, and\nthe Heritage Brief was the subject of national media coverage the week\nbefore the members reported for the trial. Id. at *11.\n   On appeal, this court found some evidence of UCI in the CMC’s remarks\nabout sexual assault in the Marine Corps and the need to hold those who\ncommit sexual assault accountable. Id. at *28. Voir dire of the members\nrevealed that:\n        eight of the eleven members attended the Heritage Brief; many\n        had also either read White Letter 2-1270 or the media coverage;\n\n\n   70In conjunction with the Heritage Brief tour, the CMC issued White Letter 2-12,\naddressed to all Marines, announcing a Marine Corps-wide campaign to address\n\n\n                                          36\n\f                  United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n       virtually all acknowledged a high degree of deference to the\n       CMC, particularly when he holds a strong opinion on a topic;\n       they recalled the Heritage Brief primarily focusing on two\n       things – sexual assault and accountability; almost all\n       remembered and accepted as true the CMC’s statement that\n       80% of sexual assault allegations are legitimate; and, most\n       would characterize the CMC as unhappy, frustrated, or\n       disappointed in his officers and senior enlisted for their failure\n       to hold Marines accountable.\nId. at *14. This court concluded that the three military judges presiding over\nthe case had failed to cure the appearance of UCI by not excusing more of the\nmembers or rehabilitating them through curative instruction. Id. at 35-37. A\nmore carefully vetted panel of members, instructed on their independence as\nfact finders, could have tried the case with an objective outsider’s confidence\nin the integrity of the process. But this court did not believe the Heritage\nBrief in and of itself was fatal and necessitated dismissal of the charges with\nprejudice. Id. at *37-38; see also id. at *39 (Ward, S.J. concurring) (agreeing\nwith the majority that the Heritage Brief does not create an appearance of\nUCI per se).\n    Returning to the case at bar, we look for evidence of actual influence or\nsome effect that suggests influence on military justice proceedings. In this\ncase, SECNAV publicized administrative actions he had already taken or\nordered while the appellant’s court-martial was still pending appeal before\nthis court in November 2009. But SECNAV made no mention of a pending\nappeal. He cited the findings of the courts-martial as justification for the\nadministrative actions he had already taken.\n    The appellant accuses SECNAV of deliberately misrepresenting the facts\nand findings of his case in the articles. SECNAV described the killing as\npremeditated, contrary to the appellant’s acquittal of premeditated murder.\nBut in light of the appellant’s concurrent conviction for conspiracy to commit\nmurder, we cannot impugn intentional misrepresentation to his use of the\nword “premeditated.” SECNAV also appeared not to have interpreted the\nappellant’s acquittal of housebreaking and kidnapping as an acquittal of a\nconspiracy to murder a random Iraqi man. In light of our analysis of that\nissue above, we also decline to find SECNAV’s lack of precision intentionally\ndeceptive.\n\n\n\n\nsexual assault and his expectation that leadership be engaged in addressing it.\nHowell, 2014 CCA LEXIS 321, at *9.\n\n\n                                      37\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n   SECNAV’s words of “censure, reprimand, or admonish[ment]”71 were\nreserved for the appellant, his squad members, and the squad lieutenant. To\nthe extent SECNAV rebuked earlier decisions to retain the three junior\nMarines and the Sailor, he indirectly criticized administrative separation\ndecisions separate and distinct from the court-martial process. But there\nwere no expressions of disappointment or frustration with CAs, members, or\nanyone else referring or adjudicating charges at courts-martial.\n    Although SECNAV’s comments, excerpted from the November 2009\narticles, have been repeatedly reproduced in numerous publicly available\nprint and online articles, the record reveals no new comments or actions from\nSECNAV regarding the appellant since the interviews in November 2009.\nOther than a vague reference to requests for information about the status of\nthe appellant’s second court-martial from “the Secretariat” in a staff judge\nadvocate’s routine email correspondence,72 there is no evidence of SECNAV,\nor anyone acting on his behalf, directly contacting anyone, in or out of the\nDepartment of the Navy, about the appellant or this case. In fact, the\nappellant alleges that SECNAV’s subordinates were influenced by nothing\nmore than their awareness of their superior’s opinions from these articles. In\nhis brief, the appellant repeatedly alleges that subordinates bowed to\nSECNAV’s influence because they “were aware of Secretary Mabus’\ncomments.”73\n   4. Decision-makers allegedly influenced\n    We turn now to government actors and entities who subsequently made a\nrecommendation, a decision, a ruling, or took some action related to the\nappellant’s first or second court-martial. Assuming without deciding that the\nappellant has alleged facts constituting UCI in SECNAV’s words alone, we\nproceed with the Biagase and Boyce tests. To find actual UCI, we must find\n“that the proceedings were unfair” and “that [UCI] was the cause of the\nunfairness.” Biagase, 50 M.J. at 150. To find apparent UCI, we must find that\n“an objective, disinterested observer, fully informed of all the facts and\ncircumstances, would harbor a significant doubt about the fairness of the\nproceeding.” Boyce, 76 M.J. at 249 (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n\n\n\n\n   71   Art. 37, UCMJ.\n   72   AE LXXXIII.\n   73   Appellant’s Brief at 63.\n\n\n                                        38\n\f                        United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n   a. Naval Clemency and Parole Board (NC&PB)\n   The appellant cites “denied clemency/parole in Jan 2010” as the first of\nthe “unfair actions” resulting from SECNAV’s comments.74\n    Clemency is available to service members primarily through three\nstatutory avenues: Article 60, UCMJ; Article 74, UCMJ; and 10 U.S.C. § 953.\nArticle 60, UCMJ, requires a CA to consider matters an accused submits in\nclemency before taking action on the findings and sentence of a court-martial.\nAt the time of the appellant’s first court-martial, the CA had unfettered\nauthority under Article 60, UCMJ, to “disapprove, commute, or suspend the\nsentence in whole or in part.”75 Under Article 74(a), UCMJ: “The Secretary\nconcerned and, when designated by him, any Under Secretary, Assistant\nSecretary, Judge Advocate General, or commanding officer may remit or\nsuspend any part or amount of the unexecuted part of any sentence,\nincluding all uncollected forfeitures other than a sentence approved by the\nPresident.” Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 953, SECNAV maintains the NC&PB as\nhis system for granting clemency.76\n    With a few inapplicable exceptions, SECNAV has delegated his authority\nto act in matters of clemency and parole to the Assistant SECNAV for\nManpower and Reserve Affairs (ASN(M&RA)).77 The NC&PB is composed of\na civilian director and four senior officers representing communities in the\nMarine Corps and Navy.78 The board’s mission is to “act for or provide\nrecommendations or advice to SECNAV in the issuance of decisions regarding\nclemency or parole matters[.]”79 Among the board’s functions is to “submit to\nSECNAV, with recommendation for final action . . .\n         (a)    Cases in which SECNAV or a designee has indicated in\n         writing an official interest. . . .\n         (d)    Any individual whose clemency may be the subject of\n         controversy or substantial congressional or press interest as\n         determined by SECNAV or a designee . . .\n\n\n\n\n   74   Id. at 61.\n    75 Art. 60(c)(2), UCMJ. The appellant’s CA reduced his sentence to confinement\n\nfrom 15 years to 11 years pursuant to his Article 60, UCMJ, authority.\n   76   Secretary of the Navy Instruction (SECNAVINST) 5815.3J (12 Jun 2003).\n   77   Id. at ¶ 205 (emphasis omitted).\n   78   Id. at ¶ 307.\n   79   Id. at ¶ 306.\n\n\n                                           39\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n         (e)    Cases in which the NC&PB recommends clemency for\n         any offender whose approved unsuspended, [sic] sentence to\n         confinement is in excess of 10 years . . . .”80\nClemency and parole are not rights but decisions within the NC&PB’s and\nSECNAV’s discretion.81 While consideration of clemency is part of the post-\ntrial process, it is considered an executive, not a judicial function. See United\nStates v. Healy, 26 M.J. 394, 395-96 (C.M.A. 1988).\n    Given SECNAV’s statutory authority to grant or deny clemency, we are\nskeptical that his influence over the process, assuming he had any, was\ninappropriate, much less unlawful. As Chief Judge Baker wrote in his dissent\nin Hutchins IV, “[SECNAV] would be hard pressed to exercise unlawful\ncommand influence over the NC&PB clemency decision over which he retains\nsole discretion with the sort of public comments attributed to him in this\ncase.” 72 M.J. at 317 (Baker, C.J., dissenting). Judge Ryan, in her concurring\nopinion in Hutchins IV, acknowledged that “SECNAVINST 5815.3J limits the\nNC&PB’s role in Appellant’s clemency process to one that merely advises the\nSecretary on a matter committed, by statute, to his discretion.” Id. at 303\n(Ryan, J. concurring in the result). The appellant accuses SECNAV of\ninterfering in his own process by revealing his opinion to his own advisers. If\nSECNAV’s public comments are the source of UCI, the revelation of the\nopinion, not the manner in which SECNAV reached it, is the issue. Assuming\nwithout deciding that SECNAV could inappropriately influence his own\nadvisers by communicating a decision to them, we evaluate the evidence in\nlight of the tests in Biagase and Boyce.\n    The appellant offers no evidence as to why a decision to deny him\nclemency or parole was unfair. He simply includes it in a list of unfavorable\nactions and decisions made since November 2009 that he characterizes as\n“unfair.”82\n   Moving to the third Biagase factor, causation, the appellant alleges that\nthe NC&PB reversed course and recommended no clemency—when they had\npreviously recommended a six-year reduction in confinement—because they\nwere “aware” of SECNAV’s opinion.83 First, that argument rests on the\nunsupported assumption that board membership was constant from 2009 to\n2010. But more important, the government presented evidence undermining\nthe purported effect of SECNAV’s statement. TC presented the acting\n\n   80   Id. at ¶ 308.a.(6) (emphasis omitted).\n   81   Id. at ¶ 308.a and b.\n   82   Appellant’s Brief at 61.\n   83   Id. at 63.\n\n\n                                            40\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nASN(M&RA)’s 10 March 2009 memorandum notifying the President of the\nNC&PB of his disagreement with the board’s recommendation and denial of\nany clemency for the appellant.84\n    In his Motion to Dismiss for UCI, the appellant detailed his further\nrequests for clemency and the results. In June 2010, the appellant was\nreleased from confinement following this court’s decision to set aside his\nconviction. After being ordered back into confinement in February 2011, the\nappellant filed a special request for clemency with the NC&PB. The board\nrecommended reducing the appellant’s sentence by 251 days, and the acting\nASN(M&RA) approved.85 The NC&PB subsequently recommended parole in\nJune 2011, but the new ASN(M&RA) disapproved. A year later, the NC&PB\nrecommended against clemency and parole, but then in 2013, the board\nrecommended granting parole. ASN(M&RA) rejected the recommendation.86\nThis fluctuation further undermines any reasonable expectation of\nconsistency in recommendations from year to year.\n    Looking at the facts presented by both the appellant and the government,\nwe do not see “some evidence” that the appellant’s proceedings for requesting\nclemency were unfair or that the appellant was denied additional clemency\nbecause of SECNAV’s public statements. ASN(M&RA) rejected NC&PB’s\nrecommendation for clemency in March 2009 and communicated his decision\ndirectly to the President of the NC&PB. The appellant has failed to\ndemonstrate how SECNAV subsequently interfered with the process or\ninappropriately influenced the NC&PB by reaching the identical decision\neight months later and indirectly communicating it to the NC&PB via the\nmedia.\n    Turning to apparent UCI of the NC&PB, we note that a member of the\nCAAF previously concluded that “[n]o member of the public, aware of the\nremarks made and the change in clemency recommendation that occurred,\ncould fail to harbor grave concerns that the change in the NC&PB’s clemency\nrecommendation was directly related to the Secretary’s intemperate remarks\nabout Appellant[.]” Hutchins IV, 72 M.J. at 302-03 (Ryan, J. concurring in the\nresult). However, it appears Judge Ryan reached her conclusion without the\nbenefit of ASN(M&RA)’s March 2009 memorandum, which the government\nsubsequently submitted during the appellant’s second court-martial. In light\nof that evidence, we are convinced, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the\ngovernment has dispelled any notion that “[UCI] placed an intolerable strain\non the public’s perception of the military justice system because an objective,\n\n   84   AE LXXXIX at 23.\n   85   AE LXXXVIII at 8.\n   86   Id. at 8-9.\n\n\n                                        41\n\f                    United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\ndisinterested observer, fully informed of all the facts and circumstances,\nwould harbor a significant doubt about the fairness of the proceeding.” Boyce,\n76 M.J. at 249.\n    When the appellant raised the effect of UCI on the NC&PB before his\nsecond court-martial, the government presented ASN(M&RA)’s 10 March\n2009 memorandum to the President of NC&PB. In it, he declined to approve\nthe board’s recommendation to reduce the appellant’s confinement by six\nyears and denied any clemency for the appellant. In the routine\ncorrespondence documenting his decision, ASN(M&RA) went on to respond to\nthe NC&PB’s recommendation with the following:\n             Having thoroughly reviewed Private Hutchins’ case,\n         specifically including the evidence presented on his behalf, I\n         found the adjudged sentence to be appropriate for the murder\n         of an innocent Iraqi national and the subsequent attempts to\n         fraudulently cast the incident as an attack upon United States\n         forces. These acts represented a significant departure from the\n         conduct expected of a Marine, no matter how dire the situation\n         or circumstances.87\nThe decision and the comments supporting it predated SECNAV’s comments\nby eight months, and there is no evidence that SECNAV was aware of the\nexchange or in any way influenced ASN(M&RA). In fact, the record suggests\nthat SECNAV only became involved in the appellant’s case when\ncongressional members approached him personally on the appellant’s behalf.\nAny consultation between SECNAV and ASN(M&RA) in advance of\nASN(M&RA)’s decision to deny the clemency recommendation would have\ndefeated the purpose of SECNAV’s delegation of authority.\n    Although apparent UCI does not require evidence of causation, it is the\nappearance that SECNAV abruptly derailed the appellant’s prospects for\nclemency with his comments that constitutes the evidence of apparent UCI in\nthis case. ASN(M&RA)’s unequivocal denial of the appellant’s clemency in\nremarkably similar terms, addressed directly to the board eight months\nearlier, negates that appearance. No observer aware of that March 2009\ndenial can believe that, but for SECNAV’s comments, the appellant would\nhave received the NC&PB’s recommended clemency. To the extent\nsubsequent NC&PB board members felt chilled against recommending\nclemency for the appellant, a reasonable observer would be hard pressed to\nattribute that chilling effect to SECNAV instead of the senior official who had\nalready disapproved the recommendation as a matter of due course.\n\n\n   87   AE LXXXIX at 23.\n\n\n                                       42\n\f                  United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n    This evidence undermining the appearance that NC&PB reversed course\nin response to SECNAV’s comments also addresses the first of three points\nJudge Ryan found bolstered her concerns about the fairness of the clemency\nprocess:\n       (1) the NC&PB’s dramatic change following the Secretary’s\n       comments that Appellant receive no clemency or parole; (2) the\n       subordinate status of all NC&PB members to the Secretary,\n       and (3) the fact that any NC&PB clemency or parole\n       recommendation would have to be approved by the\n       [ASN(M&RA)], who was presumably aware of the Secretary’s\n       position on this matter.\nHutchins IV, 72 M.J. at 302 (Ryan, J. concurring in the result) (internal\ncitations omitted). We respectfully submit that awareness of ASN(M&RA)’s\nMarch 2009 memorandum significantly weakens any apparent causal link\nbetween SECNAV’s comments and NC&PB’s change in recommendation.\nSecond, members of NC&PB are also subordinate to ASN(M&RA), and they\nunderstand their role is to submit cases like the appellant’s with\nrecommendations for final action by ASN(M&RA) or SECNAV. Third, the\nmemorandum reveals that ASN(M&RA) communicated a disinclination to\naward the appellant clemency eight months before he presumably learned of\nSECNAV’s position on the matter. Thus, for NC&PB, SECNAV’s comments\nwere less of an influence than an echo.\n    Finally, someone aware that NC&PB membership and recommendations\nare not consistent from year to year would not expect consistency in the\nboard’s recommendations. We are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that\na reasonable observer, cognizant of all of the facts and circumstances, would\nfind SECNAV’s comments far less consequential to subsequent NC&PB\nrecommendations, if consequential at all. We find that, at the appellant’s\nsecond court-martial, the government successfully rebutted the appearance of\nUCI infecting the NC&PB’s consideration of the appellant’s clemency\nrequests.\n   b. The Judge Advocate General\n    Next, the appellant claims that, following this court’s decision in Hutchins\nI, the Judge Advocate General (JAG) of the Navy succumbed to UCI and felt\ncompelled to certify the case to the CAAF for further review.\n   Pursuant to Article 67, UCMJ, and RULE FOR COURTS-MARTIAL (R.C.M.)\n1203, MANUAL FOR COURTS-MARTIAL, UNITED STATES (2012 ed.), the JAG\nmay “forward the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals to the Court of\nAppeals for the Armed Forces for review with respect to any matter of law.”\nR.C.M. 1203(c)(1).\n\n\n                                      43\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n    On 22 April 2010, this court set aside the findings and sentence of the\nappellant’s first court-martial, citing an improper severance of the appellant’s\nattorney-client relationship with one of his detailed defense counsel.\nHutchins I, 68 M.J. at 631. The record was returned to the JAG for remand to\nan appropriate CA with authority to order a rehearing. Id. Instead, the JAG\nexercised his authority to certify issues related to the severance of counsel to\nthe CAAF. Hutchins II, 69 M.J. at 283-84. The CAAF found that severance of\nthe appellant’s relationship with one of his detailed defense counsel did not\nmaterially prejudice his rights and remanded the case to this court for a new\nreview under Article 66, UCMJ. Id. at 293.\n    Citing the JAG’s occupation of his billet in November 2009—a billet in\nwhich he was SECNAV’s direct subordinate—the appellant assumes the JAG\nwas aware of SECNAV’s comments. The appellant also offers media reports\nthat the JAG’s advisors recommended against certification of the case,\npresumably to suggest that the JAG acted in accordance with something\nother than sound legal judgment.88 He alleges that “certification of Hutchins I\nto CAAF ultimately led to the reinstatement of Sgt Hutchins’ convictions, and\nled to Sgt Hutchins serving an additional 29 months of confinement.”89\n    Assuming, arguendo, that the JAG was familiar with the newspaper\narticles, the appellant fails to demonstrate that the decision to certify his case\nwas prejudicial, much less unfair. Had the JAG not certified the appellant’s\ncase to CAAF, he would have remanded it to a CA with the authority to order\na rehearing. Ultimately, that happened, after the CAAF’s decision to set\naside the findings and sentence in Hutchins IV. Attributing an additional 29\nmonths of confinement to that delay is baseless, as there is no way to know\nhow the appellant’s rehearing and subsequent appeals might have unfolded\nwithout the certification. Instead, the JAG acted within his authority, and\nthe appellant cannot show some evidence of an unfair proceeding or prejudice\nresulting from the JAG’s decision, much less from UCI.\n   We agree with Chief Judge Baker’s observation that “subordination, a\ndivergence in staff advice, and a certification do not alone amount to some\nevidence of [UCI]. Rather they reflect the ordinary process of review and\nappeal.” Hutchins IV, 72 M.J. at 315 (Baker, C.J., dissenting). There is no\ncause for an “objective, disinterested observer, fully informed of all the facts\nand circumstances,” to “harbor a significant doubt about the fairness of the\nproceeding.” Boyce, 76 M.J. at 249.\n\n\n    88 Regardless of what advice the JAG might have received, his judgment was\n\nsound. The CAAF overturned this court’s decision based on one of the issues the JAG\ncertified. Hutchins II, 69 M.J. at 292-93.\n   89   Appellant’s Brief at 65.\n\n\n                                        44\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n   Accordingly, we find that the appellant has failed to satisfy his initial\nburden of providing some evidence of UCI of the JAG.\n   c. Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals (NMCCA)\n    The appellant speculates that three former judges of this court “desire[d]\nto validate the Secretary of the Navy” when they “failed to diligently review\nthe record and the pleadings, and were predisposed to affirm the conviction\nand find that Secretary Mabus did not engage in [UCI]” in Hutchins III, 2012\nCCA LEXIS 93.90\n    When the newspaper articles appeared in November 2009, the appellant’s\ncase was still pending its first review before this court. Although not\nappearing to address the appellate court, SECNAV publicly shared that, after\nreading the record of the appellant’s court-martial, he was convinced the\nappellant led his squad in planning, executing, and covering up the\npremeditated murder of an Iraqi civilian. According to SECNAV, the\nappellant had received the sentence he deserved. Five months later, this\ncourt set aside the findings and sentence from the appellant’s court-martial\nand remanded the case for rehearing. The CAAF, comprised entirely of judges\noutside the Department of the Navy, reversed and remanded to this court for\na new review. Two of the three appellate judges on the panel deciding\nHutchins III had concurred in the en banc decision to set aside in Hutchins I.\nHutchins III, 2012 CCA LEXIS 93, at *1 (opinion by Perlak, S.J. with\nCarberry, S.J. and Modzelewski, J. concurring); Hutchins I, 68 M.J. at 631\n(Carberry, S.J. and Perlak, J., concurring in the majority opinion). In\nHutchins III, this court affirmed the findings and sentence, finding no merit\nin an allegation of UCI or other AOEs. 2012 CCA LEXIS 93, at *11, *32.\n    In addition to presenting some evidence of UCI, the appellant must also\novercome the presumption that appellate judges “know the law and apply it\ncorrectly.” United States v. Clark, 75 M.J. 298, 300 (C.A.A.F. 2016) (citations\nomitted). “Without such evidence, courts will not conclude that a military\njudge was affected by unlawful command influence.” Hutchins IV, 72 M.J. at\n314 (Baker, C.J., dissenting) (citing United States v. Rivers, 49 M.J. 434, 443\n(C.A.A.F. 1998)).\n   To rebut “the presumption of regularity that applies to the acts of the\nappellate military judges”91 and demonstrate some unfairness in the\nappellate review of his case, the appellant focuses on the content of the\nopinion. According to the appellant, the opinion’s author failed to recite the\ncharges, specifications, or language of which the appellant was acquitted, he\n\n\n   90   Id. at 69.\n   91   Clark, 75 M.J. at 300.\n\n\n                                       45\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nsummarized, instead of quoted, SECNAV’s statements as published in the\narticles, and he “falsely claimed to have granted all the defense motions to\nattach UCI-related documents to the record.”92 From this third, readily\nprovable oversight, the appellant concludes the panel either failed to read the\nrecord of trial or the pleadings, or knowingly made a false statement.93\nReading the Hutchins III opinion, and particularly the UCI analysis, we find\nno merit in the appellant’s allegations of impropriety, or unfairness, at the\nappellate court level.\n    The appellant also falls short of demonstrating some evidence of\ncausation. To tie Hutchins III to SECNAV’s UCI, the appellant characterizes\nthe opinion as “a complete validation of Secretary Mabus’ actions and an\nadoption of his view of the case”94 instead of the full or partial dismissal the\nappellant requested.95 Striving to explain how Senior Judges Perlak and\nCarberry suddenly abdicated their judicial responsibility under pressure from\nSECNAV in Hutchins III, when they had been comfortable reversing the\nconvictions in Hutchins I, the appellant speculates that in April 2010 this\ncourt was not yet aware of SECNAV’s comments. The appellant’s tangled\nexplanation of whom the UCI affected and when is nothing more than “mere\nallegation or speculation.” Stoneman, 57 M.J. at 41; see also Hutchins, 72\nM.J. at 314 (Baker, C.J., dissenting) (concluding that the “Appellant has not\nmoved beyond mere allegation or speculation in demonstrating ‘some\nevidence’ that the CCA proceedings were unfair or affected by unlawful\ncommand influence.”).\n    Finally, the CAAF’s subsequent decision setting aside the appellant’s\nfindings and sentence and authorizing a new trial in Hutchins IV nullifies\nthis court’s holdings in Hutchins III and any negative effect the appellant\nmight have suffered therefrom. He received a new trial. The appellant\ndisputes mootness by insisting this court shirked its Article 66, UCMJ, duty\nto dismiss the charges with prejudice for factual insufficiency. But the\nevidence against the appellant simply did not support a finding of factual\ninsufficiency. Despite the harmless misstatement regarding motions to attach\nin Hutchins III, the appellant has failed to demonstrate some evidence that\nhis appeal was unfair or that the appellant judges ceded their judicial\nindependence in an effort to please SECNAV. For the same reasons, the\nappellant has also failed to demonstrate some evidence that an objective,\n\n\n   92   Appellant’s Brief at 68 (citation omitted).\n   93   Id. at 69.\n   94   Appellant’s Reply of 6 Mar 2017 at 44.\n   95   Appellant’s Brief at 70.\n\n\n                                             46\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\ndisinterested observer, fully informed of all the facts and circumstances,\nwould harbor a significant doubt about the fairness of the proceeding.\n   d. CAs and their staff judge advocates\n    The appellant avers that the two CAs who referred charges to his second\ngeneral court-martial and rejected his requests for administrative separation\nin lieu of trial (SILT) and offers to plead guilty were compromised by UCI. He\nasserts that UCI affected the staff judge advocates (SJAs) who advised them\nas well.\n    To demonstrate the impact of UCI on his CAs in this case, the appellant\nproffers evidence that the CAs were aware of SECNAV’s published statement\nas they made decisions propelling the appellant toward court-martial.\n    The first of the two CAs, Lieutenant General (LtGen) Robert Neller,\nUSMC, referred the charges to the appellant’s second court-martial. In his\nrole as CA, he also received and ultimately denied appellant’s requests for\nrelease from pretrial confinement, assignment to desired duties, SILT, and\nacceptance of a proposed pretrial agreement.\n   In an affidavit signed 14 August 2014, LtGen Neller wrote:\n         I was generally aware of [sic] the Secretary of the Navy made\n         some comment to the press and others in 2009 about the case,\n         but do not know any of the specifics. This had no influence on\n         my referral decision. I did not receive any direct or indirect\n         influences from any senior officer or official regarding the\n         handling of this case.96\nAt an Article 39(a), UCMJ, session on 5 March 2015, LtGen Neller testified\nthat SECNAV’s comments “had no bearing on anything that [he] did in\nrelation to this case.”97 According to his testimony and his electronic\ncorrespondence, he consulted only with his legal counsel about this case.\nLtGen Neller referred charges based on his personal knowledge of the\ncharged events, having been in Iraq at the time, and his review of\nstatements.98 Excerpts of LtGen Neller’s electronic correspondence contain no\nevidence that SECNAV or anyone else in LtGen Neller’s chain of command\ncommunicated with him regarding his decisions.\n   The appellant alleges that UCI tainted advice the SJA, Colonel (Col) G,\ngave LtGen Neller. SJAs, like military judges, enjoy the presumption of\nknowledge of and compliance with the law and their independent duties,\n\n   96   AE LIV.\n   97   Record at 698.\n   98   Id. at 701.\n\n\n                                        47\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nabsent evidence to the contrary. See Ashby, 68 M.J. at 130 (C.A.A.F. 2009)\n(presuming that “legal officers properly performed their professional duties\nwhich included independent review of the evidence and preparation of only\nthose charges for which they determined probable cause existed.”). Relying on\nsupport from Col G’s electronic correspondence, the appellant proffers that\nCol G was cognizant of SECNAV’s comments, the motion to dismiss for UCI,\nrequests for information “originating from the ‘Secretariat,’” and LtGen\nNeller’s desire for input from the SJA to the CMC following the reversal of\nconvictions.\n    The appellant also alleges that the SJA’s office and the prosecution “were\non the same ‘team’” because Col G addressed his deputy and the trial counsel\nas “Team” in an email asking that defense counsel route their requests for\nthe CA through trial counsel.99 This does not amount to evidence that Col G\nassumed a prosecutorial role. Nor did the email require Col G to disqualify\nhimself as the SJA. See United States v. Chessani, 2009 CCA LEXIS 84, *5-6,\n*21 (N-M. Ct. Crim. App. 17 Mar 2009) (affirming apparent UCI based on the\npresence of a disqualified SJA—who had interviewed Chessani, elicited\nincriminating statements from him, and was “intimately involved in drafting\nfindings and conclusions” about him—when subordinate SJAs briefed the CA\nabout the case). The appellant has not presented sufficient evidence to\novercome the presumption of Col G’s compliance with the law or to\ndemonstrate that Col G or any of the other SJAs acted as an investigator,\nmilitary judge, or counsel in this case and thus should be disqualified.\n    The appellant also alludes to a memorandum to the Justice Department\nrequesting testimonial immunity for one of the appellant’s squad members. It\nwas likely drafted by TC, reviewed by Col G, and bore LtGen Neller’s\nsignature. Citing concerns about the armed forces’ image abroad and\ndifficulties in renewing the Status of Forces Agreement with Iraq, the\nmemorandum sought assistance “to reinstate Sergeant Hutchins’\nconvictions.”100 LtGen Neller testified that the wrong words were used in that\nstatement and clarified his intent was to seek retrial, not reinstatement of\nconvictions.101 Regardless of the propriety of references to political concerns\nor Status of Forces Agreements, the memorandum provides no evidence of\nSECNAV’s influence.\n   LtGen Neller was relieved by LtGen Kenneth McKenzie, USMC, who\nthen became the appellant’s CA. As evidence of the impact of UCI on LtGen\nMcKenzie, the appellant cites his denial of a SILT request. The appellant’s\n\n   99   Appellant’s Brief at 72.\n   100   AE LXXXVIII at 151.\n   101   Record at 704.\n\n\n                                        48\n\f                       United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nSILT request “specifically highlighted Secretary Mabus’ comments in detail,\nalong with referencing Air Force cases of political retaliation against\nconvening authorities, as justification for the SILT, in order to restore public\nconfidence in the independence of convening authorities.”102 LtGen McKenzie\nalso refused to meet with the appellant’s civilian defense counsel or to\nnegotiate a pretrial agreement with him.\n    In an affidavit, LtGen McKenzie wrote, “I do not recall any prior specific\ncomments made about this case by any particular individual, including the\nSecretary of the Navy, the Honorable Ray Mabus, General Hagee and\nGeneral Conway.”103 Based on his “independent review of this matter post-\nreferral,” LtGen McKenzie concurred with the SJA’s Article 34, UCMJ,\nadvice.104 LtGen McKenzie declared his independence as a CA, denied any\nattempts to influence him, and affirmed his presumption of the appellant’s\ninnocence and right to a fair trial.105\n    At the Article 39(a), UCMJ, hearing, LtGen McKenzie testified to having\nno recollection of SECNAV’s comments at the time of their publication and to\nlearning about them only through the appellant’s motion to dismiss for UCI.\nWhen asked for his “immediate reaction” to SECNAV’s comments, LtGen\nMcKenzie testified, “I’m dealing in, you know, 2014, 2015 and they don’t\nseem to have any bearing on what I’m going to do and what actions I’m going\n[to] take as the [CA] in the case. So, no, they did not particularly concern\nme.”106 LtGen McKenzie confirmed that he had conducted his own\nindependent review of the appellant’s case upon assuming command from\nLtGen Neller and concurred with the decision to refer charges.107\n   With regard to LtGen Neller, Col G, and LtGen McKenzie, the appellant\nsubmits that their unwillingness to grant his requests for a more favorable\ndisposition, coupled with their full knowledge of SECNAV’s opinions in 2009,\nconstitutes at least some evidence of UCI. Their electronic correspondence\nreveals no evidence of influence from SECNAV or a lack of independence in\npursuing the case.108 But for the briefings and publicity surrounding the\nappellant’s motion to dismiss for UCI, it is unclear whether the CAs would\nhave even known what SECNAV said. Neither LtGen Neller nor LtGen\n\n   102   Appellant’s Brief at 81 (citation omitted).\n   103   AE LVIII at 3.\n   104   Id. at 4.\n   105   Id.\n   106   Record at 785.\n   107   Id. at 790-91.\n   108   AE LXXXIII.\n\n\n                                             49\n\f                    United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nMcKenzie could have testified more emphatically about the irrelevance of\nSECNAV’s comments to their deliberative process or their independence of\njudgment. The appellant has again fallen short of presenting some evidence\nof either unfairness or causation.\n    Finally, there is not some evidence of apparent UCI. This case has none of\nthe hallmarks of apparent UCI identified in Boyce. In Boyce, the CA had\ndrawn considerable public criticism from Congress and the media for setting\naside sexual assault convictions in the court-martial of a lieutenant colonel\nand direct but quiet criticism from the JAG of the Air Force for declining to\nrefer charges of sexual assault against an airman. 76 M.J. at 244-45. The\nnewly confirmed Secretary of the Air Force directed the Air Force Chief of\nStaff to call the CA and present him with two choices—“voluntarily\nretire from the Air Force at the lower grade of major general, or wait for the\nSecretary to remove him from his command in the immediate future.” Id. at\n251-52. Within three hours of the call, the CA decided to retire early. Id. at\n252. In formally requesting retirement, the CA wrote, “[m]y decisions as a\nGeneral Court Martial [sic] [CA] . . . have come under great public scrutiny,\nand media attention . . . will likely occur on subsequent sexual assault cases I\ndeal with.” Id. at 245-46 (internal quotation marks omitted). The effect on\nBoyce came ten days later when the CA referred charges of sexual assault\nagainst him. Id. The CAAF found the appearance of UCI in the facts\npreceding the CA’s decision. Id. at 251. They “conclude[d] that members of\nthe public would understandably question whether the conduct of the\nSecretary of the Air Force and/or the Chief of Staff of the Air Force\nimproperly inhibited [the CA] from exercising his court-martial convening\nauthority in a truly independent and impartial manner as is required to\nensure the integrity of the referral process.” Id. at 252-253; see also United\nStates v. Gerlich, 45 M.J. 309, 314 (C.A.A.F. 1996) (setting aside findings and\nsentence because a general court-martial CA wrote a letter to his subordinate\nspecial court-martial CA questioning his resolution of a sexual assault\nallegation with nonjudicial punishment and “request[ing]” that the special\ncourt-martial CA consider further investigation).\n    In contrast, there is no evidence of implicit or explicit threats of\nretaliation, congressional chastisement, or even a phone call to any of the\nCAs in this case at the behest of SECNAV or anyone else. SECNAV’s\ndisapproval of decisions to retain some of the appellant’s most junior squad\nmates, expressed five years earlier, does not amount to the kind of “censure,\nreprimand, or admonish[ment]”109 that creates an appearance of UCI. Unlike\nthe CA in Boyce, who was forced to retire for his actions, both LtGen Neller\nand LtGen McKenzie affirmed their unhindered independence and the\n\n   109   Art. 37, UCMJ.\n\n\n                                      50\n\f                  United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nabsence of SECNAV’s influence from their decisions. Again, the appellant has\noffered nothing more than speculation and allegation. Unfavorable decisions\nmade with awareness of a five-year-old SECNAV article and nothing more do\nnot create an appearance of UCI.\n   e. Military judge\n    Finally, the appellant alleges that the military judge, with full awareness\nof SECNAV’s statements, made legally unsupported rulings on motions\nrelated to UCI to protect SECNAV and his own post-retirement employment\nin the Department of Defense.\n    Absent evidence to the contrary, military judges enjoy a presumption of\nresistance to UCI in their decisions. Rivers, 49 M.J. at 443; see also\nStombaugh, 40 M.J. at 213 (holding that the court would “not presume that a\nmilitary judge has been influenced simply by the proximity of events which\ngive the appearance of command influence in the absence of a connection to\nthe result of a particular trial.” (citations omitted)).\n    It is worth examining a case of unlawful influence of a military judge for\nperspective. In Salyer, prosecutors and a supervisory circuit judge took action\ntoward the military judge presiding over Salyer’s court-martial. “Perplexed”\nby one of the military judge’s rulings on a pretrial motion, trial counsel\naccessed the military judge’s personnel record looking for evidence of a\npotential personal bias. Salyer, 72 M.J. at 420. Trial counsel then questioned\nthe military judge about personal information from his file in voir dire and\nchallenged him for actual and implied bias. Id. Eager to warn the military\njudge’s supervisory judge about this unusual turn of events, one of the senior\nprosecutors shared the discovered personal information and plans for voir\ndire with the supervisory judge as a courtesy. Id. In a subsequent\nconversation between the two judges, the supervisory judge mentioned the\nphone call from the prosecutor, the perplexing ruling, the reaction to it, and\nthe government’s intent to seek the military judge’s recusal. Id. at 421.\nRecusing himself from the case, the military judge cited “an inappropriate\nmethod for addressing a disagreement with [his] ruling” as cause for a\nreasonable person to question his impartiality on future decisions in the case.\nId. at 421-422. The CAAF agreed with the military judge, finding that “[a]n\nobjective, disinterested observer, fully informed of these facts and\ncircumstances, might well be left with the impression that the prosecution in\na military trial has the power to manipulate which military judge presides in\na given case . . . .” Id. at 427; see also Lewis, 63 M.J. at 414, 416 (finding\nactual UCI in the command’s “unlawful effort to unseat an otherwise\nproperly detailed and qualified military judge” and ordering dismissal with\nprejudice because the government could not render its error harmless). In\nSalyer’s case, the government successfully replaced the military judge.\n\n\n                                      51\n\f                  United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n    The appellant offers no evidence of prosecutorial skullduggery,\ngovernment efforts to embarrass, manipulate, or replace the military judge in\nthis case, or criticism or questions from anyone in the military judge’s chain\nof command. Instead, the appellant attempts to demonstrate unlawful\ninfluence with the military judge’s subordinate position to SECNAV, his\nknowledge of SECNAV’s statements five years earlier, and the rulings he\nmade. Once again, the appellant’s differing interpretation of the law and the\nfacts is not evidence of an unfair proceeding. SECNAV’s position at the top of\nthe military judge’s chain of command and the theoretical prospect of\ndownward pressure alone are not evidence of causation. The appellant\nimplies that the military judge’s post-retirement employment aspirations\nwith the Department of Defense and possibly the Department of the Navy are\nevidence of UCI. Without evidence that SECNAV retaliated against—or\nrewarded—anyone for their actions resolving the Hamdaniyah cases, such an\nimplication is bare allegation and speculation.\n    While this court does not condone senior officials making public\ncomments about courts-martial pending appeal, the appellant has, with one\nexception, failed to present some evidence of actual or apparent UCI on his\ncourt-martial proceedings. In the case of apparent UCI affecting the NC&PB,\nthe government rebutted the appearance of UCI, and we are convinced,\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, that an objective observer, cognizant of all the\nfacts and circumstances, would not harbor a significant doubt about the\nfairness of the clemency process.\nD. Apparent UCI from the search of defense counsel’s office\n    The appellant argues that apparent UCI arising from a government\nsearch of one of his detailed defense counsel’s office necessitates setting aside\nhis findings and sentence and ordering the government to pay reasonable\nattorney fees for his civilian defense counsel.\n   “‘Where the issue of unlawful command influence is litigated on the\nrecord, the military judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under a clearly-\nerroneous standard, but the question of command influence flowing from\nthose facts is a question of law that this Court reviews de novo.’” United\nStates v. Reed, 65 M.J. 487, 488 (C.A.A.F 2008) (quoting United States v.\nWallace, 39 M.J. 284, 286 (C.M.A. 1994)).\n   The command authorized search at issue arose and was litigated in a\nseparate case this court has reviewed and affirmed. United States v.\nBetancourt, No. 201500400, 2017 CCA LEXIS 386, unpublished op. (N-M. Ct.\nCrim. App. 6 Jun 2017), rev. denied, __ M.J. __, 2017 CAAF LEXIS 1118\n(C.A.A.F. Dec. 4, 2017). On 2 May 2014, Criminal Investigative Division\n(CID) agents executed a command search authorization and searched\nmultiple defense counsel offices within Legal Support Services Section (LSSS)\n\n                                       52\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n–West spaces aboard Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California. Agents\nsuspected a cell phone belonging to Sgt Betancourt was in the office of one of\nhis defense attorneys. Id. at *9-*10. With the cooperation of the senior trial\ncounsel, three CID agents searched defense counsel offices, and a fourth\nagent recorded video of the search. Id. at *11. “The agents were professional\nbut extremely thorough, searching through desk drawers, file cabinets,\nlockers, garbage cans, and ceiling tiles. The agents opened case files, but\nquickly flipped through the files without pausing to read documents within\nthe files.” Id. at *12.\n    This court found some evidence of apparent UCI in Betancourt but was\n“convinced beyond reasonable doubt that an objective, disinterested observer,\nfully informed of all the facts and circumstances, would not harbor a\nsignificant doubt as to the fairness of [Betancourt’s] court-martial[.]” Id. at\n*27. “[T]he government took significant corrective action after the search to\nlimit disclosure of any information obtained by CID agents during the search.\nThis included removing the [senior trial counsel], the trial counsel, and the\ninvestigators from further involvement with the investigation or court-\nmartial. . . . The video recording of the search was secured by order until a\nspecial investigating officer was appointed to review it for potential leakage\nof privileged information. Subsequently, the recording was sealed by the\nmilitary judge who reviewed it in camera.” Id. at *27-*28.\n    Unbeknownst to prosecutors, the command search authorization was not\nlimited to Sgt Betancourt’s counsels’ offices, and the search extended to the\noffices of five other defense counsel not associated with Sgt Betancourt’s case.\nId. at *11-*12. One of the offices searched belonged to Captain (Capt) S.L.,\none of the detailed defense counsel in the case before us. The appellant’s TDC\nfiled a motion to disqualify members of LSSS-West and any CID personnel\ninvolved in the 2 May 2014 search, and the parties litigated the impact of the\nsearch on the appellant’s case.\n    In his written ruling on the motion, the military judge reached findings of\nfact supported by the record that are not clearly erroneous. Returning to his\noffice after it was searched, Capt S.L. “noticed ‘many books and binders out of\nplace on the bookshelf’ where his kept his Hutchins case file, [but] he could\nnot say whether documents therein were searched.”110 The four CID agents\nwho participated in the search testified to only flipping through file folders in\nsearch of the cell phone and not reading the files’ contents. Review of the\nvideo recording of the search of Capt S.L.’s office111 by the military judge and\nthis court corroborates the agents’ testimony. The video indicates that the\n\n   110   AE LIX at 2 (quoting AE XXXI at 33)\n   111   AE LVII.\n\n\n                                         53\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nsearch of Capt S.L.’s office lasted about five minutes. The agents also testified\nthat they knew nothing about the appellant’s case.\n    TC who prosecuted the appellant at his second court-martial were also\nnot involved in the search authorization or the search. As documented in an\naffidavit, Capt P.M. “played no role in the planning or execution of the\nBetancourt Command Authorization for Search and Seizure.”112 Almost six\nweeks after the search, he was assigned to the trial team in the Betancourt\ncase because the original trial counsel were disqualified. Despite litigating\nissues related to the search in multiple courts-martial, Capt P.M. never\nviewed video of the search or discussed it with the senior trial counsel who\nfacilitated the search, any of the investigators, or the judge advocate who\nconducted the taint review.113 Capt P.M. stated in his affidavit, “I have not\nheard, reviewed, seen, learned, read, or gleaned anything related to Sgt\nHutchins as a result of the search.”114 The other trial counsel, Major (Maj)\nA.W., also swore in an affidavit, “I have not heard, reviewed, seen, learned,\nread, or gleaned anything related to Sgt Hutchins as a result of the\nsearch.”115 Maj A.W. was stationed in Austin, Texas, on the day of the search.\n   The military judge concluded that the circumstances of the search of\ndefense counsel offices raised some evidence of apparent UCI in this case. We\ndo not dispute that finding, particularly in light of our similar conclusion in\nBetancourt. While the military judge found the government could not\ndisprove the “predicate facts on which the allegation of UCI is based[,]” he\ndetermined the government had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that a\nreasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts would not perceive\nthat the deck is unfairly stacked against the accused.116\n    Reviewing the military judge’s legal conclusion de novo, we also find the\ngovernment has rebutted, beyond a reasonable doubt, any notion that “an\nobjective, disinterested observer, fully informed of all the facts and\ncircumstances, would harbor a significant doubt about the fairness of the\nproceeding” against the appellant. Boyce, 76 M.J. at 249 (citation and\ninternal quotation marks omitted). Despite the government’s troubling\n\n   112   AE LIX at 15.\n   113 Id. at 15-17. Capt P.M. acknowledged receiving a call from one of the CID\nagents after the agent received a call from the appellant’s civilian defense counsel.\nThe agent did not disclose any information about the search with Capt P.M. during\nthat call.\n   114   Id. at 15.\n   115   Id. at 18.\n   116 Id. at 13-14; see United States v. Morrison, 66 M.J. 508, 510-11 (N-M. Ct.\nCrim. App. 2008).\n\n\n                                         54\n\f                  United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nintrusion into defense counsel spaces, the testimony and the video recording\nof the search of Capt S.L.’s office provide overwhelming evidence that any\nexposure to privileged information about the appellant’s case, if it occurred,\nwas momentary, at most. The CID agents who executed the search were\nwholly uninvolved with the appellant’s investigation and therefore would not\nhave recognized the significance of any information they might have\nglimpsed. The agents were subject to a gag order, prohibiting them from\ndiscussing what they might have seen with anyone. There is no evidence to\nsuggest any agent violated that gag order or that any privileged information\nabout the appellant’s defense reached the prosecution in his case. The\ngovernment has also dispelled, beyond a reasonable doubt, any suspicion that\nprosecutors directed, knew, or even anticipated that CID agents would gain\naccess to privileged files about the appellant.\n    Corrective measures we deemed adequate to prevent apparent UCI in\nBetancourt are more than adequate to protect against apparent UCI in this\ncase, where the appellant was subject to substantially less exposure. We find\nno apparent UCI in this case stemming from the brief search of Capt S.L.’s\noffice.\nE. Recusal of the military judge\n    The appellant avers that the military judge erred in refusing to recuse\nhimself based upon actual and/or apparent bias stemming from (1) UCI, (2) a\nconflict of interest with supervisory judges in his chain of command, and (3)\nhis independent investigation and ex parte communications.\n    We review a military judge’s decision not to recuse himself for an abuse of\ndiscretion. United States v. McIlwain, 66 M.J. 312, 314 (C.A.A.F. 2008) (citing\nUnited States v. Butcher, 56 M.J. 87, 90 (C.A.A.F. 2001)).\n   R.C.M. 902 details the grounds for disqualification of a military judge:\n       (a) In general. Except as provided in subsection (e) of this rule,\n       a military judge shall disqualify himself or herself in any\n       proceeding in which that military judge’s impartiality might\n       reasonably be questioned.\n       (b) Specific grounds. A military judge shall also disqualify\n       himself or herself in the following circumstances:\n          (1) Where the military judge has a personal bias or\n       prejudice concerning a party . . . .\n                                  ....\n          (5) Where the military judge . . . :\n\n\n\n\n                                         55\n\f                    United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n                  (B) Is known by the military judge to have an interest,\n                 financial or otherwise, that could be substantially\n                 affected by the outcome of the proceeding . . . .\nAs with UCI, maintaining public confidence in the independence and\nimpartiality of military judges requires us to consider both actual bias and\nthe appearance of bias as possible bases for disqualification. See United\nStates v. Quintanilla, 56 M.J. 37, 44-45 (C.A.A.F. 2001). “The first step asks\nwhether disqualification is required under the specific circumstances listed in\n[R.C.M.] 902(b). If the answer to that question is no, the second step asks\nwhether the circumstances nonetheless warrant disqualification based upon\na reasonable appearance of bias.” Id. at 45.\n   “There is a strong presumption that a judge is impartial, and a party\nseeking to demonstrate bias must overcome a high hurdle, particularly when\nthe alleged bias involves actions taken in conjunction with judicial\nproceedings.” Quintanilla, 56 M.J. at 44 (citation omitted). But “‘[a]ny\nconduct that would lead a reasonable man knowing all the circumstances to\nthe conclusion that the judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned is\na basis for the judge’s disqualification.’” Id. at 78 (quoting United States v.\nKincheloe, 14 M.J. 40, 50 (CMA 1982) (additional citation and internal\nquotation marks omitted); see also R.C.M. 902(a).\n   The appellant filed a pretrial motion seeking recusal of the military judge\nand the entire Navy-Marine Corps Trial Judiciary.117 The military judge\ndenied the motion for recusal without making a written ruling. In the\nabsence of detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law on the record, we\nmust accord his ruling less deference. See Flesher, 73 M.J. at 312. With the\nexception of one subsequently mooted basis for judicial recusal, the appellant\nhas raised the same purported sources of judicial bias on appeal. We now\nparse those allegations for reasonable questions about the military judge’s\nimpartiality.\n   1. UCI\n   The appellant argues that SECNAV’s UCI and evidence of its effect on\nmembers of this court create and confirm an actual, or at least apparent, bias\nagainst the appellant in the military judge.\n    Our superior court has recognized that we test for apparent bias in\nviolation of R.C.M. 902(a) in essentially the same way we test for apparent\nUCI. See Lewis, 63 M.J. at 415. “We focus upon the perception of fairness in\nthe military justice system as viewed through the eyes of a reasonable\nmember of the public.” Id. Accordingly, the appellant reiterates his\n\n   117   AE C.\n\n\n                                        56\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\narguments for finding actual and apparent UCI—SECNAV’s 2009 comments\npoisoned the military justice system adjudicating the appellant, whether that\nadulteration manifested as UCI or apparent bias. Only the requested\nremedies are different. Instead of arguing for dismissal of the charges, the\nappellant challenges the military judge’s decision not to recuse himself.\n    In section C of this opinion, we exhaustively analyzed the appellant’s\nallegations of actual and apparent UCI. Having found no actual or apparent\nUCI impacting the appellate court or the military judge, we necessarily\nconclude that neither the military judge, nor the former appellate court\njudges who participated in Hutchins I or Hutchins III, labored under an\nactual or apparent bias born of SECNAV’s 2009 comments about this case.\n   2. Conflict of interest with the judicial chain of command\n    The appellant also asserts that the military judge suffered from a conflict\nof interest with supervisory judges in his chain of command.\n    R.C.M. 902(b)(5) targets a military judge’s conflicts of interest by\ndemanding disqualification when he or she “has a personal interest, financial\nor otherwise, that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the\nproceeding.” In this context, a personal interest is “extra-judicial” as opposed\nto judicial. Quintanilla, 56 M.J. at 43 (citing Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S.\n540, 549 (1994); In re Corrugated Container Antitrust Litigation, 614 F.2d\n958, 964 (5th Cir. 1980); In re Boston’s Children First, 244 F.3d 164, 168 (1st\nCir. 2001)). The UCMJ acknowledges and mitigates the personal interest\nthat “results from the well-recognized effect of fitness-report evaluations on a\nmilitary lawyer’s service advancement and security.” United States v. Mabe,\n33 M.J. 200, 205 (C.M.A. 1991) (citations omitted). Article 26(c), UCMJ,\nprohibits a CA or any member of a CA’s staff from “prepar[ing] or review[ing]\nany report concerning the effectiveness, fitness, or efficiency of the military\njudge so detailed, which relates to his performance of duty as a military\njudge.” The Navy Performance Evaluation System Manual specifically\naddresses evaluation of the performance of military justice duties: “[Fitness\nreports] on military judges and appellate judges may properly evaluate their\nprofessional and military performance, but may not include marks,\ncomments, or recommendations based on their judicial opinions or rulings, or\nthe results thereof.”118\n   With safeguards such as these in place, our superior court has held that\nthe administration of military justice by judges subject to a military chain of\ncommand does not present an inherent conflict of interest. See United States\nv. Mitchell, 39 M.J. 131, 142 (C.M.A. 1994) (rejecting Mitchell’s argument\n\n\n   118   Bureau of Personnel Instruction 1610.10D, Encl (2) at I-3 (1 May 2015).\n\n\n                                           57\n\f                  United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nthat the naval officer fitness report system creates “a reasonable possibility of\na perceived pecuniary interest of his judges in deciding his case unfairly” as\n“simply too speculative and remote to violate the Constitutional norm”\nagainst an appearance of unfairness). See also United States v. Graf, 35 M.J.\n450, 466 (C.M.A. 1992) (affirming the effectiveness of the UCMJ and Court of\nMilitary Appeals in protecting military judges from conflicts with their own\n“security of tenure” and “financial security” in the context of the military\nchain of command and performance evaluation system). Nor does the military\njustice system, per se, foster an apparent conflict of interest in violation of\nR.C.M. 902(a). See United States v. Norfleet, 53 M.J. 262, 269 (C.A.A.F. 2000)\n(holding “that preparation of fitness reports for appellate military judges by\nsenior judge advocates does not create a circumstance in which the\nimpartiality of a judge might reasonably be questioned under [R.C.M.]\n902(a)” (citation omitted)).\n    An actual or apparent conflict of interest between a military judge’s\nrulings and his or her personal interest in protecting career prospects arises\nonly in extraordinary circumstances. An example is when a supervisory judge\ndeviates from the UCMJ, regulations, and case precedent and affirmatively\nquestions a subordinate judge’s ruling. See Mabe, 33 M.J. at 205-06 (referring\nto a memorandum from a Chief of the Trial Judiciary to a military judge\nabout the subordinate judge’s sentences as a “military justice taboo” and\nconcurring that removal of the offending chief trial judge from the military\njudge’s chain of command restored the appellant’s right to a fair trial and the\nintegrity of the military justice system). The appellant offers no evidence of\nsupervisory intrusion on subordinate discretion in this case.\n    a. Conflict regarding SECNAV’s alleged UCI and former appellate judges\nin the chain of command\n    In support of their motion to recuse the military judge, the appellant\nconducted voir dire. First, TDC asked the military judge to detail his chain of\ncommand within the trial judiciary. The military judge identified Col M.R.,\nthe Circuit Judge of the Western Judicial District, as his immediate superior\nand confirmed Col M.R. would sign his next fitness report. Col M.R. reported\ndirectly to the Chief Trial Judge, who in turn reported to the Chief Judge of\nthe Department of the Navy. All of the military judges, as members of the\nDepartment of the Navy, were subordinate to SECNAV.\n   In response to the basis for the challenge—SECNAV’s 2009 comments\nabout this case—the military judge disavowed any memory of them prior to\nreading the appellant’s pleadings regarding UCI. Then he stated:\n       I profoundly and deeply don’t care what the Secretary of the\n       Navy thinks as far as this case goes. . . .\n\n\n\n                                       58\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n          As how it effects [sic] my career, a post-command senior O-6\n          who is retiring next summer, don’t care. Deeply, profoundly\n          don’t care. Deeply, profoundly don’t care what [the Chief Trial\n          Judge] or [the Chief Judge of the Department of the Navy]\n          would think about it as well.\n             They are professional colleagues and I think they would be\n          profoundly disappointed in me . . . if I took any action,\n          whatsoever, of speculating about what they might think. That\n          would be abdicating my role as a military judge, as an officer of\n          the Navy, and a member of the Judge Advocate General [sic]\n          Corps, and certainly of the California Bar.\n              . . . I just want to make it clear on the record that,\n          something that Secretary Mabus may have said in 2009 has\n          beyond no bearing on anything that I might do or might not do\n          in this case.119\n    To overcome the presumption against a conflict of interest in the military\njustice system and the military judge’s emphatic denial of any personal\ninterest susceptible to his rulings in this case, the appellant asserts that the\nmilitary judge had a personal interest in not embarrassing his supervisory\njudges with adverse findings about them. According to the appellant, the\nprospective damage to these senior judges’ reputations necessitated the\nmilitary judge’s recusal. See Norfleet, 53 M.J. at 271 (acknowledging “[t]here\nmay be cases in which the ruling by a military judge on an issue would have\nsuch a significant and lasting adverse direct impact on the professional\nreputation of a superior for competence and integrity that recusal should be\nconsidered.”).\n    Motions filed on behalf of the appellant solicited the military judge to\nmake findings about his chain of command. The Chief Trial Judge and the\nChief Judge of the Department of the Navy were both former members of this\ncourt and concurred in the majority opinions in Hutchins III and Hutchins I,\nrespectively. In his motion to dismiss for UCI, the appellant asked the\nmilitary judge “to make potentially adverse findings against the [Chief Judge\nof the Department of the Navy] and [the Chief Trial Judge] [.]”120 Specifically,\nthe military judge might have to determine that they “were unlawfully\ninfluenced by Secretary Mabus, and/or had made/adopted materially false\nstatements.”121 As previously discussed infra in section C, we do not impute\n\n\n   119   Record at 96.\n   120   Appellant’s Brief at 120.\n   121   Id.\n\n\n                                         59\n\f                       United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nmendacity to the Chief Judge of the Department of the Navy and the Chief\nTrial Judge from immaterial discrepancies in prior appellate opinions. Nor do\nwe fault the military judge for failing to do so.\n   b. Conflicts involving the military judge’s immediate supervisor\n    Col M.R., the military judge’s immediate supervisor, was the original\nmilitary judge in this case before recusing himself during pretrial motions.\nHe had a personal relationship with another senior Marine judge advocate\nlikely to testify as a witness in litigation of a motion. Nonetheless, the\nappellant argued that Col M.R. remained a witness to contested facts in this\ncase.122 First, in his position as the circuit judge, Col M.R. possessed\ninvestigative materials and notes relevant to the CID search of defense\ncounsel spaces in Betancourt, discussed, supra, in section D. Second, the\nappellant alleged that Col M.R., after learning of the appellant’s continued\ninstructor role at the Marksmanship Training Unit (MTU) aboard Camp\nPendleton, notified the senior Marine judge advocate with whom he had a\npersonal relationship. Shortly thereafter, that senior Marine judge advocate\nadvised his commander to remove the appellant from the MTU—a transfer\nthe appellant asserts violated Article 13, UCMJ.\n    According to the appellant’s motion for recusal, these allegations\nnecessitate the military judge’s recusal because (1) a trial judge’s interference\nin the duty assignment of an accused appearing before him “would cause\nsignificant damage to the public perception of the integrity of the military\njustice system”123 and must be fully vetted “through witness testimony at\nopen hearing.”124 But (2) that trial judge, Col M.R., could not testify if he\nmust appear before his subordinate military judge. So the subordinate\nmilitary judge must recuse himself. Like the military judge, we decline the\nappellant’s invitation to resolve these allegations. Once Col M.R. recused\nhimself from this court-martial, his own possible bias against the appellant\nbecame irrelevant. The court could and did adjudicate the CID search of\ndefense counsel spaces and the appellant’s Article 13, UCMJ, motion without\nfurther inquiring into Col M.R.’s possible involvement. Our review of these\ntwo issues, submitted to us as AOEs, confirms they were susceptible to\nresolution without the need to call Col M.R. to the stand.\n   A subordinate military judge should disqualify him or herself from ruling\non a credible allegation of impropriety by a supervisory judge. The desire to\nspare a superior such an ordeal does create an apparent, if not an actual,\n\n\n   122   AE C at 16.\n   123   Id. at 17.\n   124   Id.\n\n\n                                         60\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nconflict of interest. But a party cannot incite a conflict by raising unsupported\nand/or irrelevant allegations of judicial misconduct.\n   In this case, the appellant has not presented evidence of a credible\nextrajudicial threat to the military judge that overcomes the presumption\nthat his supervisors will follow the law. The prospect of a conflict of interest\nin presiding over this case remains far too speculative and remote to\nconstitute an actual or apparent conflict of interest necessitating recusal.\n   3. Independent investigation / ex parte communications\n   The appellant accuses the military judge of violating the judicial canon\nprohibiting ex parte communications and submits this violation as evidence of\nbias against the appellant necessitating his recusal.\n   In pursuit of the military judge’s recusal, the appellant levies a serious\ncharge against the military judge and at least three other current and former\nNavy judge advocates. Pursuant to instruction,125 the military judge’s conduct\nwas governed by the American Bar Association (ABA) Model Code of Judicial\nConduct. Canon 2.9 of the ABA Model Code governs ex parte communications:\n         (A) A judge shall not initiate, permit, or consider ex parte\n         communications, or consider other communications made to the\n         judge outside the presence of the parties or their lawyers,\n         concerning a pending or impending matter, except as follows:\n             (1) When circumstances require it, ex parte communication\n             for scheduling, administrative, or emergency purposes,\n             which does not address substantive matters, is permitted,\n             provided:\n                 (a) the judge reasonably believes that no party will gain\n                 a procedural, substantive, or tactical advantage as a\n                 result of the ex parte communication; and\n                 (b) the judge makes provision promptly to notify all\n                 other parties of the substance of the ex parte\n                 communication, and gives the parties an opportunity to\n                 respond.\nABA, Model Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 2.9: Ex Parte Communications\n(2011 ed.) (internal asterisks omitted). While the facts of the military judge’s\nalleged breach of this canon are necessary to our analysis of this AOE, we\nneed not determine whether he actually breached it. “[A]ctivity inconsistent\nwith standards of judicial conduct does not mandate recusal unless it rises to\nthe level of a violation of applicable disqualification standards.” Butcher, 56\n\n   125   Judge Advocate General’s Instruction 5803.1D at ¶ 7 (1 May 2012).\n\n\n                                          61\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nM.J. at 92 (citing R.C.M. 902). Thus we need only focus on whether the\nmilitary judge’s ex parte communications required his disqualification and\nrecusal.\n   When an allegation of ex parte communication forms part of a motion for\nrecusal,\n         [a] decision on disqualification will “depend on [1] the nature of\n         the communication; [2] the circumstances under which it was\n         made; [3] what the judge did as a result of the ex parte\n         communication; [4] whether it adversely affected a party who\n         has standing to complain; [5] whether the complaining party\n         may have consented to the communication being made ex\n         parte, and, if so, [6] whether the judge solicited such consent;\n         [7] whether the party who claims to have been adversely\n         affected by the ex parte communication objected in a timely\n         manner; and [8] whether the party seeking disqualification\n         properly preserved its objection.”\nQuintanilla, 56 M.J. at 44 (quoting RICHARD E. FLAMM, JUDICIAL\nDISQUALIFICATION § 14.3.1 at 411-12 (1996) (footnotes omitted)). Our\nanalysis will focus primarily on the first four of the eight factors above, as the\nlast four all inure to the appellant. For clarity, we will begin with factor 2,\nthe circumstances under which the communication was made, and then\nproceed to the nature of the communication, factor 1.\n   a. Circumstances under which communications were made\n   On 24 September 2014, the appellant’s trial defense counsel requested the\nCA approve and provide logistical support for a site visit to Iraq.126 Upon\ndenial of this request, the appellant filed a motion to compel a site visit. 127\nBoth the appellant and the government acknowledged that the appellant’s\nprevious trial defense team traveled to Iraq and briefly visited the alleged\ncrime scene in January 2007. In his written ruling denying the motion to\ncompel a site visit, the military judge noted that “the current Defense team\nhas access to the files from the former team which visited the situs—and may\nconsult with former counsel Lt.Col. [J.S.] who has been made available by his\nsupervisor.”128\n   Lieutenant Colonel (LtCol) J.S. was one of the appellant’s detailed\ndefense counsel at his first court-martial, and he traveled to Iraq with the\n\n\n   126   AE LXIX at 4, 12.\n   127   AE LXIX.\n   128   AE CXXV at 6.\n\n\n                                        62\n\f                       United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nappellant’s original civilian defense counsel in January 2007. By the time of\nthe second court-martial and the motion to compel, LtCol J.S. had\ntransitioned from active duty to the Marine Corps Reserve. He was an\nAssistant U.S. Attorney in his civilian capacity and a Reserve appellate\nmilitary judge on this court. LtCol J.S. was the subject of the ex parte\ncommunication.\n   The appellant’s current civilian defense counsel asked the military judge\nabout LtCol J.S.’s availability in a telephonic R.C.M. 802 conference on 25\nNovember 2014.129 The military judge explained that he contacted the Chief\nTrial Judge to inquire of this court whether LtCol J.S. could be made\navailable “to assist the defense based on his prior representation of Sgt\nHutchins.”130 He went on to confirm that he and the Chief Trial Judge\n“agreed to make sure LtCol [J.S.] is available to assist the defense.”131\n   b. Nature of the communications\n    Proceeding to the nature of the communication, it was a single telephone\ncall from the military judge to the Chief Trial Judge. On the record, the\nmilitary judge explained that he “contacted [the Chief Trial Judge] to ensure\n[the NMCCA] would be sure to wall [LtCol J.S.] off from any Hutchins\nmatters should the defense desire to consult with him on their own, (a); and\n(b), should the case reach that venue again.”132 LtCol J.S. later testified at an\nArticle 39, UCMJ, session about his knowledge of the ex parte\ncommunications. The then-Chief Judge of this appellate court called him\n“and indicated that there would be an order coming out on this case and that\nthe trial counsel had reached out to the Chief Judge of the [Department of\nthe] Navy . . . to confirm that [LtCol J.S.] could—the level of [LtCol J.S.’s]\nparticipation, and they had some sort of conversation.”133 LtCol J.S.\nunderstood that he was authorized to “provide information from [his]\nprevious representation” of the appellant.134 He summarized the scope of this\nauthority as follows: “So basically I can sort of dump every single bit of\ninformation that I have regarding the site visit . . . it’s a one-way flow of\n\n\n   129 AE C at 40. Details of that R.C.M. 802 conference come from an affidavit by\none of the appellant’s detailed defense counsel, who was also on the conference call.\nThe appellant submitted the affidavit in support of his motion for the military judge’s\nrecusal.\n   130   Id.\n   131   Id. at 41.\n   132   Record at 655.\n   133   Id. at 728.\n   134   Id.\n\n\n                                          63\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\ncommunication.” LtCol J.S. understood that the Chief Judge of the\nDepartment of the Navy was the source of this authority, and the then-Chief\nJudge of this appellate court conveyed it to LtCol J.S.\n   c. What the judge did as a result of the ex parte communication\n   Next we consider what the military judge did as a result of this ex parte\ncommunication. From his written ruling on the appellant’s motion to compel\na site visit, it appears the military judge communicated to the appellant’s\ncounsel that they could consult with LtCol J.S. regarding his 2007 site visit.\nIn his Findings of Fact, the military judge concluded that the appellant’s\n“previous Defense counsel were afforded a site visit to [Hamdaniyah] to\nsurvey the scene, conduct interviews, and investigate the circumstances\nsurrounding the event.”135 In a footnote to this finding, the military judge\nnoted that the appellant’s former civilian defense counsel was\n          unavailable for consultation due to the filing of an ineffective\n          assistance of counsel (IAC) claim after the first trial. However,\n          Lt.Col. [J.S.], a reserve judge at N.M.C.C.A., has been advised\n          by his supervisors that he may discuss the case with the\n          Defense and assist them in interpreting any of the information\n          in the file.136\nThe military judge also allowed LtCol J.S. to testify for the defense in support\nof their efforts to compel a subsequent site visit.\n    In his motion for recusal of the military judge and again on appeal, the\nappellant averred that the military judge’s ex parte communication resulted\nin him reaching three “opinions”:\n              (1) the ineffective assistance of counsel claim against LtCol\n          [J.S.] and the other members of the original trial defense team\n          does not give rise to a conflict of interest;\n              (2) the site visit conducted by LtCol [J.S.] was sufficient for\n          the defense to recover any desired evidence or witness\n          testimony; and\n              (3) LtCol [J.S.] was concurrently an appellate judge and,\n          without need to consult Sgt Hutchins, a participant in the\n          defense team; [sic] LtCol [J.S.] could actively assist the defense\n          interpretation of evidence and strategy discussions under the\n          protection of attorney-client privilege.137\n\n   135   AE CXXV at 3 (footnote omitted).\n   136   Id., n.5.\n   137   Appellant’s Brief at 123. See also AE C at 18.\n\n\n                                            64\n\f                       United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n     We address these alleged opinions in turn. First, the appellant alleges\nthat the military judge relied on the ex parte communication to resolve a\nconflict of interest that arguably prevented LtCol J.S. from assisting with the\nappellant’s defense team. During an Article 39(a), UCMJ, session to litigate\nthe appellant’s motion to compel a site visit, the appellant identified two\nconflicts of interest affecting LtCol J.S.: his position as a Reserve judge on\nthis court and the ineffective assistance of counsel claim that extinguished\nhis attorney-client relationship with the appellant.138 When asked about that\nineffective assistance claim, LtCol [J.S.] disputed suffering a conflict of\ninterest that prevented him from assisting the appellant’s new defense\ncounsel. He was able to “provide the information in a narrative sense”\nbecause the appellate issues for which attorney-client relationship was\nwaived were irrelevant to the site visit.139 The military judge did not\nexplicitly address LtCol J.S.’s purported conflict of interest on the record, so\nwe do not know the extent to which he considered the issue, if at all. We find\nno merit in the appellant’s claim that LtCol J.S. suffered from a conflict of\ninterest and thus find nothing to resolve. When our superior court set aside\nthe findings of the appellant’s first court-martial, his detailed defense\ncounsel’s effectiveness or lack thereof became moot. As LtCol J.S. commented\nin his testimony, his waiver of his attorney-client privilege in the course of\nlitigation about his effectiveness did not conflict with his ability to relay his\nsite visit experience to counsel. The military judge’s ex parte communications\ncould not impact a claim with no merit on its face.\n    Secondly, the appellant alleges that the military judge’s ex parte\nprocurement of LtCol J.S.’s assistance allowed him to conclude that the 2007\nsite visit was “sufficient for the defense to recover any desired evidence or\nwitness testimony[.]”140 As will be discussed below, in section H, the security\nsituation on the ground in and around Hamdaniyah made a site visit\nessentially impossible for any counsel in 2014 and 2015. Instead the military\njudge faced a more academic question about counsels’ equality of opportunity\nto obtain witnesses and other evidence in compliance with Article 46, UCMJ.\nLtCol J.S.’s availability to the appellant’s defense team was a factor in\nevaluating the appellant’s opportunity and access to evidence. But the\nappellant was never entitled to “recover[y of] any desired evidence or witness\ntestimony,” nor did the military judge ever reach that conclusion.\n   Third and finally, the appellant alleges that he was excluded from the\ndecision to include LtCol J.S. in his defense team’s “interpretation of evidence\n\n   138   Record at 498.\n   139   Id. at 742.\n   140   Appellant’s Brief at 123.\n\n\n                                         65\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nand strategy discussions under the protection of attorney-client privilege.”141\nSuch a characterization overstates LtCol J.S.’s authorized role in the\nappellant’s second defense. Once the appellant’s first court-martial was\nforwarded for appellate review, LtCol J.S.’s attorney-client relationship with\nthe appellant ended.142 LtCol J.S. testified to clear guidance from the then-\nChief Judge of this court that he “cannot get involved in tactical decisions,\nstrategic decisions, in giving [the appellant’s defense team] theories of\ndefense . . . .”143 His disclosures to the new defense team were a “one-way\nstreet” in which both he and the new counsel were obligated to protect\nattorney-work product from their respective representations of the\nappellant.144\n   Thus we decline to find that the military judge’s ex parte communications\nspawned any of these “opinions.”\n   d. Whether the communications adversely affected a party who has\n      standing to complain\n    Turning to the fourth Quintanilla factor, we consider any adverse effect of\nthe ex parte communication on the appellant. Beyond the three purported\nopinions, the appellant alleges that the “‘availability’ of LtCol [J.S.] was a key\nbasis for the military judge’s denial of the defense request for a site visit.”145\nAllegedly, this amounted to apparent bias against the appellant in that “as a\nmatter of public perception, the appearance is that the military judge’s\nindependent investigation and ex parte communications were made for the\nexpress purpose of gathering evidence to support a denial of the defense\nmotion.”146\n   But the facts again rebut the appellant’s characterization. “[A] reasonable\nman knowing all the circumstances” would not reasonably question the\njudge’s impartiality. Quintanilla, 56 M.J. at 78. As will be explained in\ngreater detail below in section H., the security situation in and around\nHamdaniyah, not LtCol J.S.’s availability, precluded a site visit. Even if the\nmilitary judge had ordered a site visit, witness testimony cast significant\ndoubt on its enforceability. The military judge’s ex parte communication\nserved no other purpose than to facilitate the trial defense team’s access to a\n\n\n   141   Id.\n   142   Record at 742.\n   143   Id.\n   144   Id. at 729-30, 742.\n   145   Appellant’s Brief at 124 (citation omitted).\n   146   Id.\n\n\n                                             66\n\f                    United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nMarine judge advocate who traveled to Hamdaniyah on the appellant’s behalf\nin 2007 and was still within the court’s jurisdiction. But by procuring LtCol\nJ.S.’s assistance, the military judge helped restore the balance required by\nArticle 46, UCMJ, and thus mitigated concerns raised by the appellant’s\nsubsequent Motion to Dismiss for Denial of Site Visit, or Alternatively, to\nAbate Proceedings Until Such Time As a Site Visit Can be Conducted, which\ndepended on a violation of Article 46, UCMJ.147\n    Analyzing the eight Quintanilla factors— (1) the nature of the military\njudge’s ex parte communication, (2) the circumstances surrounding it, (3) its\nconsequences, (4) the adverse effect on the appellant, and (5-8) the\nappellant’s timely objection and preservation of the issue at trial—we detect\nnot a bias against the appellant but an effort to remove obstacles to his access\nto evidence.\n   A reasonable person aware of the military judge’s ex parte\ncommunications, their effect, the appellant’s rationale for challenging those\ncommunications, and the subsequent production of LtCol J.S. would find no\ncause to question the military judge’s impartiality. Thus there is no need for\ndisqualification.\n   Even in light of the military judge’s brief and entirely verbal bases for his\ndecisions not to recuse himself from this case, and the resulting diminution of\nour deference to his judgment, we still find no abuse of discretion.\nF. Abatement for severance of attorney-client relationship\n   The appellant claims the military judge erred when he refused to abate\nthe proceedings until the appellant’s attorney-client relationship with his\nappellate defense attorney, Maj S.B.K., was restored. The military judge also\ndeclined to order Maj S.B.K’s appointment as the appellant’s individual\nmilitary counsel (IMC).\n    “A military judge’s failure to abate proceedings is reviewed for an abuse of\ndiscretion.” United States v. Simmermacher, 74 M.J. 196, 199 (C.A.A.F. 2015)\n(citing United States v. Ivey, 55 M.J. 251, 256 (C.A.A.F. 2001)).\n    An accused’s right to IMC is not absolute but subject to the discretion of\nthe CA and a determination of the availability of the requested counsel. See\nUnited States v. Eason, 45 C.M.R. 109, 111 (C.M.A. 1972). “The ruling of a\nmilitary judge on an IMC request, including the question whether such a\nruling severed an attorney-client relationship, is a mixed question of fact and\nlaw. Legal conclusions are subject to de novo review, and findings of fact are\nreviewed under a clearly erroneous standard.” United States v. Spriggs, 52\nM.J. 235, 244 (C.A.A.F. 2000) (citing United States v. White, 48 M.J. 251, 257\n\n   147   AE XCVI.\n\n\n                                      67\n\f                        United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n(C.A.A.F. 1998); S. CHILDRESS & M. DAVIS, 2 FEDERAL STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n§ 7.05 at 7-26 to 36 (2d ed. 1992)).\n   1. IMC\n    Pursuant to Article 38(b), UCMJ, an accused has the right to be\nrepresented at court-martial “by military counsel of his own selection if that\ncounsel is reasonably available[.]” Art. 38(b)(3)(B), UCMJ. If reasonably\navailable, that military counsel may be appointed to the accused’s trial\ndefense team as an IMC. Reasonable availability is defined by the service\nsecretary but excludes persons serving, inter alia, as trial counsel or\nappellate defense counsel. Art. 38(b)(7), UCMJ; R.C.M. 506(b)(1)(C)-(D). The\nManual of the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, or JAGMAN, implements\nArticle 38(b)(3)(B), UCMJ, and R.C.M. 506 with regard to counsel in the Navy\nand Marine Corps.148 First, counsel must be on active duty to be reasonably\navailable.149 Then a list of disqualifying criteria significantly limits the pool of\navailable counsel.150 Those disqualifying criteria include, inter alia,\nperformance of duties as trial counsel or appellate defense counsel and\npermanent assignment to a command outside the Trial Judicial Circuit\nwhere the court-martial will be held or beyond 500 miles from the site of the\ncourt-martial.151\n   The military judge found—and the record supports—that Maj S.B.K. was\ndetailed as the appellant’s appellate defense counsel, pursuant to Article 70,\nUCMJ, in May 2008.152 In preparation for his second court-martial, the\nappellant filed his IMC request for Maj S.B.K. on 8 August 2014.153 By then,\nMaj S.B.K. was assigned to a trial counsel billet more than 500 miles from\nCamp Pendleton, the site of the appellant’s court-martial. For these reasons,\nMaj S.B.K.’s chain of command denied the request on 11 September 2014.\nThe appellant appealed, but his appeal was denied on 24 September 2014.\nMaj S.B.K. had left active duty the previous day and transferred to the\nIndividual Ready Reserve.\n   Citing R.C.M. 506(b) and the list of assignments that disqualify counsel\nfrom serving as IMC per se, the military judge concluded that Maj S.B.K. was\n\n\n   148   Judge Advocate General Instruction 5800.7F (JAGMAN) § 0131 (26 Jun 2012).\n   149   Id. at § 0131b.(4).\n   150   Id.\n   151   Id. at § 0131b.(4)(b), (d)(1).\n   152Appellee’s Response to Court’s Order to Produce of 16 Nov 2017, Ruling on\nDefense Motion re: IMC Request for Maj S.B.K. of 5 May 2015 at 2; AE CXI at 2.\n   153   AE CXI at 8.\n\n\n                                          68\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n“per se not reasonably available while serving as a trial counsel and then\nagain when he left active duty shortly thereafter.”154\n   2. Existing attorney-client relationship\n    Despite Maj S.B.K.’s nonavailability, the appellant asserted his attorney-\nclient relationship with Maj S.B.K. and argued denial of the IMC request\nwould sever that preexisting relationship. R.C.M. 506 provides for exceptions\nto availability requirements “when merited by the existence of an attorney-\nclient relationship regarding matters relating to a charge in question.”\nR.C.M. 506(b)(1). But the exceptions do not apply “if the attorney-client\nrelationship arose solely because the counsel represented the accused on\nreview under Article 70[.]” R.C.M. 506(b)(1).\n   Article 70, UCMJ, governs the detail of appellate counsel. Specifically, the\nJAG shall appoint “[a]ppellate defense counsel [who] shall represent the\naccused before the Court of Criminal Appeals, the Court of Appeals for the\nArmed Forces, or the Supreme Court[.]” Art. 70(c), UCMJ. The authority\ngoverning detail of appellate counsel is separate and distinct from Article 27,\nUCMJ,155 which mandates the detail of trial counsel and defense counsel “for\neach general and special court-martial.” Art. 27(a)(1), UCMJ.\n    The distinction between representation at courts-martial arising under\nArticle 27, UCMJ, and representation on appeal arising under Article 70,\nUCMJ, appears in the JAGMAN’s relevant definition of an attorney-client\nrelationship. “For purposes of this section [0131 Standards for Determining\nAvailability of Requested Individual Military Counsel], an attorney-client\nrelationship exists between the accused and requested counsel when counsel\nand the accused have had a privileged conversation relating to a charge\npending before the proceeding, and counsel has engaged in active pretrial\npreparation and strategy with regard to that charge.”156 Among the “[a]ctions\n\n   154Appellee’s Response to Court’s Order to Produce of 16 Nov 2017, Ruling on\nDefense Motion re: IMC Request for Maj S.B.K. of 5 May 2015 at 8.\n   155  Article 70, UCMJ, does require that appellate counsel be qualified under\nArticle 27(b)(1), UCMJ. Qualifications detailed at Article 27(b)(1), UCMJ, include\nbeing a judge advocate, graduation from an accredited law school, membership in a\nfederal or state bar, and certification as competent to perform duties as trial or\ndefense counsel by the Judge Advocate General.\n   156  JAGMAN § 0131b(3) (emphasis added). The JAGMAN definition of attorney-\nclient relationship continues:\n             Actions by counsel deemed to constitute active pretrial\n         preparation and strategy which materially limit the range of options\n         available to the accused include but are not limited to: advising the\n         accused to waive or assert a legal right . . .; representing the accused\n         at a pretrial investigation under Article 32, UCMJ . . . ; submitting\n\n\n                                           69\n\f                       United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nthat, in and of themselves, will not be deemed to constitute ‘active pretrial\npreparation and strategy’” is “representing the accused in appellate review\nproceedings under Article 70, UCMJ[.]”157 Finally, the JAGMAN references\nthe JAGINST 5803.1 series158 “prohibiting a counsel from establishing an\nattorney-client relationship until properly detailed, assigned, or otherwise\nauthorized.” Id. at § 0131b.(3).\n   The military judge concluded that the appellant “provided no evidence to\nsuggest that Maj. [S.B.K.] engaged in active pretrial preparation and strategy\nwith regard to the charges now before the trial court—or that he was\nauthorized to do so under JAGINST 5803.1E.”159 In detailed Findings of Fact,\nthe military judge described Maj S.B.K.’s representation of the appellant:\n           zealous advocacy through the overturn of the accused’s\n           conviction by CAAF on 26 June 2013 including representation\n           at NMCCA, CAAF, a 2009 Dubay [sic] hearing, a 2010 IRO\n           hearing, and at the Naval Clemency and Parole Board, among\n           other actions. [Maj S.B.K.] continued to provide appellate\n           advocacy for Sgt Hutchins subsequent to the re-referral of\n           charges on 6 January 2014, co-signing a Writ of Mandamus on\n           behalf of Sgt. Hutchins in May 2014.160\nWhile the record does not explicitly corroborate each of these acts on behalf of\nthe appellant, there is also no indication they are clearly erroneous. It is also\nunclear the circumstances under which Maj S.B.K. represented the appellant\nat the 2009 DuBay hearing or the 2010 Initial Review Officer (IRO) hearing\nand whether he was formally detailed to do so. TDC, not appellate counsel,\ntypically provide representation at those types of hearings. But those\nhearings are not typically associated with active pretrial preparation and\nstrategy. Finally, Article 70, UCMJ, was the authority for Maj S.B.K.’s\nrepresentation of the appellant, and the scope of that representation was\n\n           evidence for testing or analysis; . . . offering a pretrial agreement on\n           behalf of the accused; submitting a request for an administrative\n           discharge in lieu of trial on behalf of the accused; or interviewing\n           witnesses relative to any charge pending before the proceeding.\nId. at § 0131b.(3)(a).\n    157   Id. at § 0131b.(3)(b) (emphasis added).\n   158 JAGINST 5803.1 series governs “Professional Conduct of Attorneys Practicing\n\nUnder the Cognizance and Supervision of the Judge Advocate General” including\nMarine Corps judge advocates, active duty and Reserve.\n      Appellee’s Response to Court’s Order to Produce of 16 Nov 2017, Ruling on\n    159\n\nDefense Motion re: IMC Request for Maj S.B.K. of 5 May 2015 at 8.\n    160   Id. at 2.\n\n\n                                             70\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nappellate review and other post-trial matters arising after the release of the\nappellant’s original trial defense counsel.\n    The military judge relied on the distinctions between trial and appellate\nadvocacy in ruling that the appellant had not demonstrated the kind of\nattorney-client relationship with Maj S.B.K. that required restoration at the\ntrial level. The military judge cited United States v. Kelker, 4 M.J. 323, 325\n(C.M.A. 1978), in support of the “separability of the trial and appellate\nfunctions.” As in the case before us, Private Kelker requested assignment of\nhis appellate defense counsel to his trial defense team for his second court-\nmartial. Id. at 323-24. Our superior court held that attorney-client\nrelationships formed pursuant to Article 70, UCMJ, for appellate\nrepresentation do not extend to the trial level, even for a rehearing of the\nsame case. Id. at 325.\n    Citing Spriggs, supra, extensively, the military judge focused on what\ntriggers the kind of attorney-client relationship that cannot be severed and\nthus compels appointment as an IMC. Establishing such a relationship\nrequires demonstrating “‘both a bilateral understanding as to the nature of\nfuture representation and active engagement by the attorney in the\npreparation and pretrial strategy of the case.’”161 Although absent from the\nmilitary judge’s ruling, the JAGMAN explicitly precludes IMC approval\nauthorities from considering appellate representation as pretrial preparation\nand strategy.162\n   The appellant cites United States v. Morgan, 62 M.J. 631, 635 (N-M. Ct.\nCrim. App. 2006), for the proposition that the attorney-client relationship\nwith appellate defense counsel continues “through remands and retrials,\nunless properly excused by the client or other competent authority.”163 For\nthat reason, we disagree with the military judge’s implication that Maj\nS.B.K’s representation of the appellant was complete. In fact, Maj S.B.K.\ncontinues to represent the appellant before this court. But that relationship,\nformed under the authority of Article 70, UCMJ, is still limited to\nrepresentation before appellate authorities. Despite Maj S.B.K.’s\nrepresentation of the appellant at a DuBay hearing and an IRO hearing—\nrepresentation normally provided by trial defense counsel—there is no\nevidence the statutory authority for the representation changed. Nor did the\n\n   161   Id. at 6 (quoting Spriggs, 52 M.J.at 241).\n   162   JAGMAN at § 0131b.(3)(b).\n   163 Appellant’s Brief at 130 (citing Morgan, 62 M.J. at 635 (noting that “appellate\ncounsel . . . join the appellant’s growing defense team. Each attorney remains on that\nteam until such time as he or she is released by the appellant or a court having\njurisdiction, or is excused by competent authority for good cause shown.”)\n\n\n                                            71\n\f                  United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nmilitary judge clearly err in finding no evidence that Maj. S.B.K. was\nengaged in active pretrial preparation and strategy.\n    Finding no clearly erroneous findings of fact and no error in the military\njudge’s legal conclusion that the appellant and Maj S.B.K. did not share the\nkind of attorney-client relationship that demands assignment as an IMC, we\naffirm the military judge’s decision not to order Maj S.B.K.’s assignment to\nthe trial defense team. We also find no abuse of discretion in the military\njudge’s denial of the appellant’s request to abate the proceedings.\nG. Pretrial punishment in violation of Article 13, UCMJ\n   The appellant contends that the government violated the Article 13,\nUCMJ, prohibition against unlawful pretrial punishment when it subjected\nhim to unduly harsh pretrial confinement in Iraq and at Camp Pendleton,\nreassigned him from a MTU to an administrative billet, and withheld a\nNavy-Marine Corps Achievement Medal (NAM) from him.\n    “The burden is on appellant to establish entitlement to additional\nsentence credit because of a violation of Article 13[, UCMJ].” United States v.\nMosby, 56 M.J. 309, 310 (C.A.A.F. 2002) (citing R.C.M. 905(c)(2)). Whether an\nappellant is entitled to relief for a violation of Article 13, UCMJ, is a mixed\nquestion of law and fact. Id. (citing United States v. Smith, 53 M.J. 168, 170\n(C.A.A.F. 2000); United States v. McCarthy, 47 M.J. 162, 165 (C.A.A.F.\n1997)). “We will not overturn a military judge’s findings of fact, including a\nfinding of no intent to punish, unless they are clearly erroneous. We will\nreview de novo the ultimate question whether an appellant is entitled to\ncredit for a violation of Article 13.” Id. (citing Smith, 53 M.J. at 170).\n    Article 13, UCMJ, states that “[n]o person, while being held for trial, may\nbe subjected to punishment or penalty other than arrest or confinement upon\nthe charges pending against him, nor shall the arrest or confinement imposed\nupon him be any more rigorous than the circumstances required to insure his\npresence[.]” In United States v. Fischer, the CAAF interpreted Article 13,\nUCMJ, to prohibit “(1) the intentional imposition of punishment on an\naccused prior to trial, i.e., illegal pretrial punishment; and (2) pretrial\nconfinement conditions that are more rigorous than necessary to ensure the\naccused’s presence at trial[.]” 61 M.J. 415, 418 (C.A.A.F. 2005) (citing United\nStates v. Inong, 58 M.J. 460, 463 (C.A.A.F. 2003); McCarthy, 47 M.J. at 165).\nIllegal pretrial punishment “‘entails a purpose or intent to punish an accused\nbefore guilt or innocence has been adjudicated.’” Id. (quoting McCarthy, 47\nM.J. at 165). “We apply this standard by examining the intent of detention\nofficials or by examining whether the purposes served by the restriction or\ncondition are ‘reasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective.’” Id.\n(quoting United States v. King, 61 M.J. 225, 227 (C.A.A.F. 2005)) (citations\nomitted). Similarly, we consider whether a condition or term of pretrial\n\n                                      72\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nconfinement “‘is imposed for . . . punishment or whether it is but an incident\nof some other legitimate governmental purpose.’” United States v. James, 28\nM.J. 214, 216 (C.M.A. 1989) (quoting Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 538\n(1979)).\n    In this case, the appellant filed a motion for “appropriate legal and\ninjunctive relief for unlawful pretrial punishment”164 which the military\njudge denied.165 We will examine the military judge’s findings with regard to\nthe four types of alleged punishment the appellant has challenged again on\nappeal. The military judge correctly placed the burden of demonstrating\nviolation of Article 13, UCMJ, on the appellant. R.C.M. 905(c)(2); see also\nMosby, 56 M.J. at 310.\n   1. Pretrial restriction in Iraq\n    From 11 to 23 May 2006, the appellant was “placed in pretrial restriction\nand housed in a climate-controlled Containerized Housing Unit (CHU) with\nan escort” in Iraq.166 There has been no dispute that this restriction was\ntantamount to confinement, and the appellant received day-for-day\nconfinement credit for this restriction.167 The Results of Trial from the first\ncourt-martial did not indicate clearly how pretrial confinement credit was\ncalculated, but the record reflects that the appellant received at least one day\nof pretrial confinement credit for each day spent restricted to the CHU in\nIraq.168\n    This period was also the focus of the CAAF’s opinion in Hutchins, IV, 72\nM.J. 294. The government’s failure to facilitate the appellant’s access to an\nattorney, despite his request for counsel upon his initial Article 31(b) rights\nnotification, contributed significantly to the CAAF’s suppression of his\nstatements to NCIS, reversal of his initial convictions, and his new trial. Id.\nat 296-300.\n\n\n\n\n   164   AE LXV at 1.\n   165   AE LXXXVII.\n   166   Id. at 2.\n   167  Id. at 6. The military judge attributed the credit to United States v. Allen, 17\nM.J. 126 (C.M.A. 1984). Allen entitles an accused to day-to-day sentence credit for\npretrial confinement, but, with one exception, the military judge referred to the\nperiod for which the appellant received the credit as “pre-trial restraint” and\n“restriction.” Id.\n   168   AE LXVI at 120; Record at 629.\n\n\n                                          73\n\f                    United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n    At his second court-martial, the appellant moved for additional remedies\nfor the command’s failure to comply with R.C.M. 305 and his “unduly harsh\npre-trial confinement conditions”169 in Iraq.\n    R.C.M. 305 prescribes requirements and rules to ensure pretrial\nconfinement is not unduly rigorous or otherwise in breach of Article 13,\nUCMJ.170 R.C.M. 305(j)(2) directs military judges to order administrative\ncredit under R.C.M. 305(k) “for any pretrial confinement served as a result of\nan abuse of discretion or failure to comply with” the provisions affording\nmembers command documentation of probable cause for confinement,\nindependent review of probable cause, and access to military counsel. R.C.M.\n305(k) credit ordered for noncompliance “is to be applied in addition to any\nother credit the accused may be entitled as a result of pretrial confinement\nserved.” R.C.M. 305(k). But the military judge declined to award R.C.M.\n305(k) or Article 13, UCMJ, credit for the appellant’s restriction in Iraq\nbecause “the law does not twice rebuke the Government for an after-the-fact\nreclassification of restraint absent evidence of other unusually harsh\ncircumstances not present here.”171\n    Our superior court has held that “R.C.M. 305 applies to restriction\ntantamount to confinement only when the conditions and constraints of that\nrestriction constitute physical restraint, the essential characteristics of\nconfinement.” United States v. Rendon, 58 M.J. 221, 224 (C.A.A.F. 2003).\nWhile restriction tantamount to confinement may entitle an accused to day-\nfor-day confinement credit under Allen, supra, or United States v. Mason, 19\nM.J. 274 (C.M.A. 1985), the accused is not entitled to double that\nconfinement credit under R.C.M. 305(k). Rendon, 58 M.J. at 224. We see no\nevidence in the record leading us to disturb the military judge’s implicit\nfinding that the appellant’s period of restriction did not include physical\nrestraint and thus did not amount to confinement. Despite the isolated\n\n\n   169   AE LXV at 1.\n   170  Pretrial confinement requires probable cause, meaning “a reasonable belief\nthat: (1) [a]n offense triable by court-martial has been committed; (2)[t]he person\nconfined committed it; and (3) [c]onfinement is required by the circumstances.”\nR.C.M. 305(d). Continued confinement requires a documented probable cause\ndetermination made by the commander not more than 72 hours after learning a\nmember is in confinement. R.C.M. 305(h)(2)(A). A neutral and detached officer shall\nreview the probable cause determination within seven days of the imposition of\nconfinement and memorialize his or her factual findings and conclusions. R.C.M.\n305(i)(2). At the request of the prisoner, military counsel shall be provided before the\n72-hour probable cause determination or the seven-day review, whichever occurs\nfirst. R.C.M. 305(f).\n   171   AE LXXXVII at 7.\n\n\n                                          74\n\f                    United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nnature of the appellant’s restriction, the unique circumstances of restriction\nin a war zone, and our superior court’s characterizations of the period in\nHutchins, IV, 72 M.J. at 296-97, the appellant has inexplicably offered no\nevidence of physical restraint. Therefore, we affirm the military judge’s\ndecision not to apply R.C.M. 305(k) credit.\n    Regarding the punitive nature of the restraint and violation of Article 13,\nUCMJ, the military judge found that the appellant had not provided the\nnecessary evidence to demonstrate that “this confinement was either illegal\nor punitive in nature.”172 R.C.M. 304(f) prohibits punitive pretrial restraint\nsuch as “punitive duty hours or training, . . . punitive labor, or . . . special\nuniforms prescribed only for post-trial prisoners.” The appellant alleged none\nof these but argued only that his solitary confinement in Iraq deprived him of\n“the ability to communicate with anyone else, including his family or\nfriends.”173 The government countered by asserting there was\ncontemporaneous probable cause to believe that the appellant and his squad\nmembers conspired to commit murder—and committed it—and thus it was\nnecessary to segregate them to prevent further obstruction of justice.174\n    The military judge concluded that “[g]iven the nature of the charged\noffenses and the proximity of the command in the midst of a war zone in a\nforeign country, solitary restriction to a CHU was not beyond the pale.”175\nOur review of the record does not contradict this finding as to the nature of\nthe restriction. The military judge correctly cited Mosby in support of his\nlegal conclusions. 56 M.J. at 310 (denying additional sentence credit for an\nArticle 13, UCMJ, violation when “[o]ther than introducing evidence that\nappellant was placed in solitary confinement based on the charge alone,\nappellant has not introduced any evidence of an intent to punish.”) Based on\nthis record, we conclude that the military judge’s findings are not clearly\nerroneous and that the circumstances of the restriction were not punitive. We\naffirm the military judge’s decision not to award additional credit or other\nremedies pursuant to Article 13, UCMJ.\n   2. Pretrial confinement at Camp Pendleton\n   The appellant was redeployed from Iraq to Camp Pendleton and began a\nperiod of pretrial confinement from 24 May 2006 to 3 August 2007. As in\nIraq, he argues his “extreme confinement conditions” were punitive.176\n\n   172   Id.\n   173   AE LXV at 5.\n   174   AE LXVI at 1.\n   175   AE LXXXVII at 7.\n   176   AE LXV at 7.\n\n\n                                      75\n\f                       United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n   Specifically, the appellant alleges he was held in “a sound-proof, solitary-\nconfinement cell for ten out of the fifteen months” of pretrial confinement and\n“was shackled every time he left his cell.”177 He argues the conditions of his\npretrial confinement were not necessary and were intended “to exact\npunishment, harassment, and abuse[.]”178\n    The military judge made the following findings of fact regarding the\nappellant’s pretrial confinement at Camp Pendleton. The appellant’s custody\nclassification on 24 May 2006 was “‘maximum’” based on “the nature of the\nallegations against him and an assessment of other factors.”179 The command\ncomplied with R.C.M. 305 by providing the appellant a pretrial confinement\nadvice letter on 25 May 2006 and conducting a status review with an IRO on\n26 May 2006. The IRO’s “comments clearly indicate his view that continued\npretrial confinement was appropriate.”180 About three weeks later, brig\nofficials cited the appellant’s “‘entirely appropriate’” behavior in downgrading\nhis custody classification and increasing his privileges.181 The military judge\nnoted that the appellant’s claim that he was placed in Maximum-[Potentially\nViolent and Dangerous] status for 150 days was “expressly contradicted by\nevidence of brig records revealing a downgrade from MAX (maximum) to MDI\n(medium) after 23 days.”182 Because of “the nature of his charges and\nconcerns about problems in the brig general population” and ease of access to\nfrequent family and legal visitors, the appellant remained in Special\nQuarters housing.183 The military judge noted that on or about 5 October\n2006, the appellant complained to the brig officer about problems he had\nencountered with other inmates on the general population mess decks.\nExtensive documentation from the Camp Pendleton Base Brig corroborates\nthe military judge’s findings.\n   Detailing administrative and safety reasons for the conditions of the\nappellant’s custody, the military judge concluded that the “Defense has not\nmet its burden to show that the conditions of pretrial confinement at the\nCamp Pendleton Base Brig were more rigorous than necessary to ensure the\naccused’s presence at trial.”184 The military judge found that the high profile\n\n   177   Appellant’s Brief at 136 (citation omitted).\n   178   Id. at 137.\n   179   AE LXXXVII at 2.\n   180   Id.\n   181   Id.\n   182   Id. at 8, n.14.\n   183   Id. at 2-3.\n   184   Id. at 7.\n\n\n                                             76\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nof the appellant’s case, the number of alleged co-conspirators, and concerns\nabout the appellant’s presence in the general population were safety concerns\nthat amounted to legitimate administrative purposes for continued\nconfinement in Special Quarters housing. He cited Smith, 53 M.J. at 173, in\nwhich the CAAF affirmed a military judge’s determination that (1) “the\nGovernment had not restricted the appellant with an intent to punish prior\nto trial” and (2) “that there were legitimate nonpunitive governmental\nobjectives served by the restrictions placed on appellant and that, therefore,\nArticle 13 was not violated[.]” Id. at 169.\n    Although the Smith court analyzed pretrial restriction, not confinement,\nid. at 170, our superior court has repeatedly applied the same test to pretrial\nconfinement. In United States v. Crawford, 62 M.J. 411 (C.A.A.F. 2006), the\nCAAF pledged deference to prison officials who adopt and execute “‘policies\nand practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal order\nand discipline and to maintain institutional security.’” Id. at 416 (quoting\nBell, 441 U.S. at 547). In light of confinement officials’ responsibility to\nensure a detainee’s presence for trial and the security of the facility, the\nburden was on Crawford to demonstrate that the conditions of his\nconfinement were “unreasonable or arbitrary[.]” Id. at 414. See also\nMcCarthy, 47 M.J. at 167 (holding, in the context of maximum custody\nconfinement, that “[i]f the conditions of pretrial restraint are ‘reasonably\nrelated to a legitimate governmental objective, it does not, without more,\namount to punishment.’”) (quoting James, 28 M.J. at 216) (additional\ncitations omitted).\n    The military judge implied that solitary confinement and shackles were\n“‘discomforting’ administrative measures reasonably related to the effective\nmanagement of the confinement facility” and “‘de minimus’ impositions” and\ntherefore not punitive.185 However, United States v. Corteguera, 56 M.J. 330\n(C.A.A.F. 2002), the source of that language, addressed a confinement facility\norientation process requiring pretrial detainees to briefly sing and shout. We\ndo not equate solitary confinement and shackles with embarrassment.\nHowever, we concur with the military judge that the appellant has failed to\nprovide evidence his confinement was unduly rigorous. Unlike in King, 61\nM.J. at 225, the appellant has not demonstrated that any conditions of his\nconfinement were “an arbitrary response to the physical limitations” of the\nfacility. Id. at 228. Instead, the record—especially regular reports from his\nbrig counselor—reveals considered justifications for his custody\nclassifications and his segregation from his squad mates and the general\npopulation.\n\n   185    Id. at 8 (quoting United States v. Corteguera, 56 M.J. 330, 334 (C.A.A.F.\n2002)).\n\n\n                                         77\n\f                          United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n    Finding no clear error in the military judge’s conclusions that the\nappellant’s confinement conditions stemmed from legitimate purposes, and,\nimpliedly, not punitive intent, we concur there was no Article 13, UCMJ,\nviolation during his pretrial confinement.\n   3. Transfer from the MTU\n    The appellant alleges that his reassignment from a marksmanship\ninstructor position to an administrative billet was arbitrary and the result of\npunitive intent.\n    While his first court-martial progressed through appellate review, the\nappellant was in and out of post-trial confinement. After this court set aside\nhis convictions in Hutchins I, 68 M.J. at 631, the appellant was released from\nconfinement and returned to duty at Camp Pendleton in June 2010. He was\nassigned as an instructor at the Battalion Headquarters MTU. In January\n2011, the CAAF reversed Hutchins I and remanded the case for review.\nHutchins II, 69 M.J. at 293. The next month, the appellant was returned to\nconfinement. In June 2013, the CAAF set aside the appellant’s convictions,\nHutchins IV, 72 M.J. at 300. He was released from confinement again and\nreturned to Camp Pendleton the next month. He served again as an MTU\ninstructor.\n    At some point after the appellant’s return to Camp Pendleton in July\n2013, his assignment as an MTU instructor came to the attention of Col M.,\nthe Officer in Charge of the Camp Pendleton LSSS. Col M. contacted the\nappellant’s commanding officer, Col Co., and “relayed his concern about the\n‘optics’ of a Marine working on a rifle range who stood accused of killing a\ncivilian with a rifle.”186 Sometime thereafter, Col Co. transferred the\nappellant from the MTU to the S4 Logistics Division, which had repeatedly\nfailed inspections. “Col [Co.] testified that Col [M.]’s call affected the timing of\nthis move, but given the [appellant’s] outstanding performance and the\nperpetual failings of S4, he ‘probably’ would have moved Sgt. Hutchins there\nat some point to shore up the division.”187 He did not consider the\nreassignment to be punitive and believed the S4 billet was rated one or two\npaygrades above the appellant’s paygrade of E-5.\n   When Col Co. retired in July 2014, Col Cr. relieved him as the appellant’s\ncommanding officer. A month later, the appellant was reassigned to the\nMTU. Conflicting evidence was presented as to Col Cr.’s awareness of the\nchange, and the military judge refrained from making findings of fact on the\nmatter. Col M. contacted Col Cr. to express his continuing concerns about the\n\n\n   186   Id. at 4.\n   187   Id. at 4, n.9.\n\n\n                                            78\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n“‘optics’” of the assignment, and the appellant was returned to S4.188 “Col\n[Cr.] disavowed an ulterior motive for the transfer and praised Sgt. Hutchins’\nwork.”189 He rated the pay grade of the S4 billet as higher than E-5 and\npossibly as high as a junior officer.\n   Substantial testimony from the colonels and members of their staff\nsupports these findings of fact from the military judge.\n    Again, the military judge found that the appellant had not met his burden\nto show that his reassignment from MTU to S4 was punitive. He applied the\ntwo-part Smith test again. 53 M.J. at 169, 72-73. The military judge found no\nevidence that assignment to S4 was considered punitive, and he held that\nassignment outside of one’s military occupational specialty was not, “ipso\nfacto,” punitive.190 He questioned the propriety of the LSSS Officer in Charge\nintervening in the appellant’s duties but detected “no evidence of either\nimproper motive or an improper result.”191\n    We find no reason to question the military judge’s findings and ultimate\nconclusion as to the appellant’s reassignment from MTU to S4. The appellant\nurges us to infer punitive intent from the “chief prosecutor’s” intervention,\ninconclusive evidence as to why the appellant was briefly returned to the\nMTU, and his assertion that there was no legitimate reason for him to leave\nthe MTU. This is not evidence of punitive intent, nor does it successfully\nrebut the nonpunitive reasons the colonels cited for their advice and\ndecisions.\n   4. Withdrawal of nomination for a NAM\n    Finally, the appellant avers that a prosecutor, acting with punitive intent,\ndissuaded the appellant’s commanding officer from awarding him a proposed\nimpact award and thus punished him.\n    The military judge found that the appellant made an immediate, positive\nimpact at both MTU and S4 and that praise for his performance was both\nuniversal and effusive. Col Co. remembered reviewing a recommendation\nthat the appellant receive a NAM as an impact award for his tenure at MTU.\nBut Col Co. demurred in favor of a letter of continuity because the appellant\nhad been on board less than a year. Col Co. also advocated for the appellant\nto receive a Combat Action Ribbon.\n\n\n\n   188   Id. at 5.\n   189   Id.\n   190   Id. at 9.\n   191   Id.\n\n\n                                       79\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n    The appellant asserts that Col Co. withheld his NAM because a\nprosecutor, Maj S., warned it “would not ‘look good’ given that he was\ncharged with murder.”192 As support, the appellant cited a deposition of the\nBattalion Operations Officer, Maj B., who nominated the appellant for the\naward. Maj B did not testify before the military judge, but a transcript of his\ndeposition was attached to the appellant’s motion. According to the deposition\ntranscript, Maj B. remembered being present for a telephone call between Col\nCo. and Maj S. during which Maj S. balked at awarding a NAM to someone\ncharged with murder because it wouldn’t look good. Col Co. then decided to\nleave the appellant’s proposed NAM citation in the awards system and “‘wait\nuntil everything clears up.’”193 He expected similar recognition for the\nappellant from S4 and, according to Maj B., said, “‘[j]ust hold off to all his\nrecognitions. He’s not denied but he’s not approved.’”194 Col Co. testified that\nhe frequently consulted with Maj S. on other cases but did not remember\ndiscussing the appellant with him.\n    While there is some disagreement between Col Co. and Maj B., it does not\nprompt us to disregard the military judge’s findings of fact as clearly\nerroneous. Maj S.’s concerns about the appearance of awarding a murder\nsuspect a NAM are consistent with Col M.’s concerns about the optics of\nassigning a murder suspect to train Marines in marksmanship. Col Co.\ntestified, “I think you should write [the appellant] up for a letter of continuity\nbecause we can’t have a Marine getting three awards to reach a senior’s ears,\njust because we moved him around.”195 This does not directly contradict Maj\nB.’s memory of Col Co. deciding to hold the appellant’s recognitions from\nMTU, S4, and others until his court-martial.\n   The military judge again found that the defense had not met its burden to\nshow that Col Co.’s decision not to approve the appellant’s NAM was\npunitive. He cited Col Co.’s testimony that a NAM for less than a year of\nperformance was premature. While he did not explicitly cite the Smith test in\nthe context of this alleged punishment, he concluded there was no evidence of\npunishment to overcome the evidence that a legitimate, alternative purpose\nmotivated the decision not to award the NAM to the appellant.\n    None of the military judge’s findings as to the lack of punitive intent and\nthe existence of legitimate, nonpunitive reasons regarding the appellant’s\nrestriction in Iraq, pretrial confinement at Camp Pendleton, reassignment\n\n\n   192   Appellant’s Brief at 143.\n   193   AE LXV at 90.\n   194   Id.\n   195   Record at 612.\n\n\n                                        80\n\f                    United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nfrom MTU to S4, or impact award is clearly erroneous. Thus we affirm his\nconclusions that the appellant was not subject to pretrial punishment in\nviolation of Article 13, UCMJ.\nH. Denial of trial defense counsel’s site visit to Iraq\n   The appellant alleges that the military judge erred in denying his TDC’s\nrequest for a site visit to Iraq, depriving him of equal access to evidence, due\nprocess, and effective representation.\n   We review a military judge’s discovery rulings for an abuse of discretion.\nUnited States v. Stellato, 74 M.J. 473, 480 (C.A.A.F. 2015).\n   1. Equal access under Article 46, UCMJ\n    Article 46, UCMJ, affords trial counsel, trial defense counsel, and the\ncourt-martial “equal opportunity to obtain witnesses and other evidence[.]” It\nis implemented in R.C.M. 701 and R.C.M. 703. R.C.M. 701 ensures “[e]ach\nparty shall have adequate opportunity to prepare its case and equal\nopportunity to interview witnesses and inspect evidence. . . . No party may\nunreasonably impede the access of another party to a witness or evidence.”\nR.C.M. 701(e). The government must make evidence in the “possession,\ncustody, or control of military authorities” available if it is “material to the\npreparation of the defense[.]” R.C.M. 701(a)(2). The standard for production\nof evidence not in a military authority’s possession, custody, or control is\nhigher. Parties to a court-martial are “entitled to production of evidence that\nis relevant and necessary.” R.C.M. 703(f)(1).\n   When moving “for discovery under R.C.M. 701 or for production of\nwitnesses or evidence[,]” the burden is on the moving party to prove, by a\npreponderance of the evidence, “any factual issue the resolution of which is\nnecessary to decide a motion[.]” R.C.M. 905(b)(4), (c).\n   a. Motion to compel\n   The appellant filed a motion to compel after the CA denied his TDC’s\nrequest for a site visit to Hamdaniyah, Iraq.196 He sought government-funded\nand facilitated travel and access to Hamdaniyah so his trial defense counsel\ncould inspect the site of the alleged offenses and locate and interview\nprospective witnesses.\n   At an Article 39(a), UCMJ, session, the deputy intelligence officer at\nMarine Forces Central testified about conditions on the ground near\nHamdaniyah. Beginning in June 2014, 80-90% of surrounding Al Anbar\nProvince had fallen under the control of the Islamic State of Iraq and the\nLevant, and nearby Abu Ghraib was “one of the more contested violent areas\n\n   196   AE LXIX.\n\n\n                                      81\n\f                       United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nin Al Anbar[.]”197 The intelligence officer opined that it would be “very, very\ndifficult, if not impossible” to send a team of investigators or attorneys to the\ngeneral area.198 Testimony about the current condition of the homes of SG\nand the Iraqi man killed on 26 April 2006 was inconclusive. Finally, the\nintelligence officer understood that the Department of State, not the\nDepartment of Defense, had the final authority for such travel to Iraq, and he\nwas doubtful of their approval given the danger and lack of Iraqi\ngovernmental control of Hamdaniyah.199\n   During argument at the Article 39(a), UCMJ, session, TDC proposed, as\nan alternative, a limitation on the government’s admission of evidence\nobtained in Iraq. In rebuttal, TC asserted that his team had given the\nappellant’s trial defense team “everything [they had] . . . that was collected or\nproduced in Iraq[.]”200 TDC did not dispute the availability of the\ngovernment’s evidence but questioned the adequacy of the NCIS\ninvestigation and the evidence it yielded. Challenging the objectivity of the\nNCIS investigation, TDC speculated that the cache of evidence and exhibits\n“may have been very different had defense counsel been on the ground[.]”201\nWhen the military judge queried TDC about what evidence he hoped to find\non-site after eight years, TDC responded, “[i]nterviews.”202 Posed with the\ninability to compel production of any Iraqi witnesses, the TDC replied, “we\nask questions and then we open up doors, and we go down this path or that\npath, and that’s what—sometimes you run into some dead ends and\nsometimes you run into leads.”203\n    In his initial written ruling denying the site visit, the military judge made\nfindings of fact, all supported by the record and not clearly erroneous.\nConducting a de novo review of his application of the law, we concur with his\napplication and conclusions. The military judge held the appellant to the\nburden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that evidence and\nwitnesses beyond government control in Iraq were relevant and necessary at\ntrial. He concluded that the appellant offered nothing more than speculation\nas to the value of personally inspecting the site or the ability to locate\nwitnesses to the events. In a footnote to his written ruling, the military judge\n\n   197   Record at 489-90.\n   198   Id. at 490.\n   199   Id. at 491-494.\n   200   Id. at 501.\n   201   Id. at 502.\n   202   Id. at 496.\n   203   Id. at 497.\n\n\n                                         82\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nnoted that the appellant had failed to distinguish his request for a site visit\nfrom a “pro forma” request, offering nothing to demonstrate “the necessity of\na site visit in this case.”204 The appellant failed to prove by a preponderance of\nthe evidence that a visit to Hamdaniyah, eight and a half war-torn years\nafter the incident, would yield evidence relevant and necessary to his defense.\n    Article 46, UCMJ, does not obviate an accused’s requirement to\ndemonstrate the necessity of evidence or assistance beyond what is already at\nhand. See R.C.M. 703(f)(1) (production of evidence); R.C.M. 703(d)\n(employment of expert witnesses). Military courts have rejected the notion\nthat the mere prospect of finding relevant and necessary evidence satisfies\nthe requirement for showing relevance and necessity. See United States v.\nWashington, 46 M.J. 477, 479 (C.A.A.F. 1997) (finding that the appellant had\nfailed to demonstrate the necessity of investigative assistance when, inter\nalia, “the defense appears to be on a ‘fishing expedition’ as to defense\nwitnesses who ‘may exist who can refute the charges’ or ‘may be helpful.’”);\nUnited States v. Kinsler, 24 M.J. 855, 856 (A.C.M.R. 1987) (noting that “[a]\ncourt need not provide for investigative services for a mere ‘fishing\nexpedition’”) (citing United States v. Shultz, 431 F.2d 907, 911 (8th Cir.\n1970)).\n    The military judge also addressed trial defense counsel’s alternative\nremedy of suppressing government evidence collected in Iraq. He found that\n“[b]oth sides have equal access to the evidence available at trial and the\nGovernment is not calling any Iraqi witnesses on the merits.”205 The military\njudge initiated arrangements for the appellant’s former detailed defense\ncounsel, LtCol J.S., then a Reserve appellate judge on this court, to be made\navailable for privileged consultation with the appellant’s current defense\nteam. LtCol J.S. had made a brief visit to Hamdaniyah in January 2007 and\nhad seen the IED crater and interviewed one Iraqi witness. With the\nappellant’s access to all of the evidence and to detailed military counsel from\nthe first trial, the military judge concluded there was no violation of Article\n46, UCMJ, in this case, in 2007 or at the time of the motion.\n   We find no abuse of discretion in the military judge’s initial two rulings.\n   b. Motion to dismiss\n   In a subsequent Motion to Dismiss for Denial of Site Visit or,\nAlternatively, to Abate Proceedings Until Such Time as a Site Visit Can Be\nConducted, the appellant argued that without a new site visit, he would\nreceive neither due process nor effective representation. The motion raised\n\n\n   204   AE CXXV at 6, n.7.\n   205   Id. at 6.\n\n\n                                       83\n\f                       United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nthe inadequacy of the appellant’s first trial defense counsel’s site visit to Iraq\nin 2007. The military judge issued a second written ruling, again denying a\nsite visit as well as the motion to dismiss or abate proceedings.206\n    We again find no clear error in the military judge’s findings of fact. The\nmilitary judge adopted his statement of law from his previous ruling and\nruled that the appellant had still failed to meet his burden of demonstrating\nthat a new site visit would “recover relevant and/or admissible evidence\nregarding the offenses allegedly committed there nine years ago.”207\nRegarding the appellant’s arguments about the insufficiency of his former\ntrial defense counsel’s site visit in 2007, the military judge found “the\nDefense must be considered at least somewhat complicit given the short\nnotice they provided in the face of the operational and security constraints in\nthe region.”208\n    The military judge did not abuse his discretion in finding no Article 46,\nUCMJ, violation in original trial defense counsel’s 2007 site visit. The right of\naccess to evidence—or sources of evidence—is not unlimited. There is usually\nno obligation to arrange interviews between trial defense counsel and\nwitnesses, but the government may not hinder them. United States v.\nKillebrew, 9 M.J. 154, 160 (C.M.A. 1980). The government may not\n“unreasonably impede the access of another party to a witness or evidence.”\nR.C.M. 701(3). “‘[A]bsent special circumstances, the right to a pretrial\ninterview—guaranteed to [the defense] under the Manual [for Courts-\nMartial] and the Code—encompasses the right to an interview free from\ninsistence by the Government upon the presence of its representative.’”\nKillebrew, 9 M.J. at 159 (quoting United States v. Enloe, 35 C.M.R. 228, 232\n(C.M.A. 1965)) (alterations in original). A witness cannot be compelled to\nspeak to TDC, as long as the government did not bring about the refusal.

We decline to find that impediments arising from safety and\nsecurity measures taken in 2007 were unreasonable and thus in violation of\nR.C.M. 701(e).\n   We find no abuse of discretion in this second pair of rulings.\n   Our superior court has interpreted Article 46, UCMJ, to be a statement of\ncongressional intent to prevent the government from marshaling its\nresources to gain an unfair advantage over an accused and thus to ensure “a\nmore even playing field.” United States v. Warner, 62 M.J. 114, 120 (C.A.A.F.\n2005). But the parity contemplated in Article 46, UCMJ, does not entitle an\naccused to a blank check. Id. at 118 (citing United States v. Calhoun, 49 M.J.\n485, 487-88 (C.A.A.F. 1998) (noting that an accused is not entitled to the\nparticular expert consultant or witness requested).\n    Assuming, arguendo, a violation of Article 46, UCMJ, the appellant must\ndemonstrate material prejudice. See Adens, 56 M.J. at 732 (holding that\n“violations of a [service member’s] Article 46, UCMJ, rights that do not\namount to constitutional error under Brady and its progeny must still be\ntested under the material prejudice standard of Article 59(a), UCMJ.”).\nArticle 59(a), UCMJ, states that “[a] finding or sentence of a court-martial\nmay not be held incorrect on the ground of an error of law unless the error\nmaterially prejudices the substantial rights of the accused.” Without\nspecifying the “substantial prejudice” to him, the appellant attributes it to\ndefense counsel being “compelled . . . to rely on the observations and filtered\ncrime scene investigative findings of NCIS and other government agents[.]”209\nThe appellant, not the NCIS agents, was at the crime scene on the morning of\n26 April 2006. His TDC were able to exploit the weaknesses in the chain of\ncustody of the decedent’s body and the appellant’s alleged weapon. The\ngovernment’s case rested largely on the testimony of the appellant’s squad\nmates—not evidence collected in Iraq or from Iraqi witnesses. The appellant\nhas failed to articulate how his lost opportunity to conduct a site visit\ncontributed to the members’ findings and thus materially prejudiced him.\n   We turn now to whether the appellant’s inability to conduct a site visit\nand independent on-site investigation and interviews deprived him of due\nprocess.\n   2. Due process\n   The appellant asserts a due process right to “the opportunity to conduct a\nmeaningful and full investigation of the underlying conduct, which\nnecessarily includes the opportunity to inspect the scene of the alleged\n\n   209   Appellant’s Brief at 148.\n\n\n                                        85\n\f                    United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\ncrime.”210 According to the appellant, “[t]he military judge’s denial [of a site\nvisit] limited the defense in its ability to inspect for evidence perhaps missed,\noverlooked or omitted by the government and infringed on due process\nrights.”211\n    The Supreme Court has “long interpreted” the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment “to require that criminal defendants be afforded a\nmeaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.” Cal. v. Trombetta,\n467 U.S. 479, 485 (1984).212 “To safeguard that right, the Court has developed\n‘what might loosely be called the area of constitutionally guaranteed access to\nevidence.’” Id. (quoting United States v. Valenzuela-Bernal, 458 U.S. 858, 867\n(1982)). “Less clear from [the Court’s] access-to-evidence cases is the extent to\nwhich the Due Process Clause imposes on the government the additional\nresponsibility of guaranteeing criminal defendants access to exculpatory\nevidence beyond the government’s possession.” Id. at 486. “Whenever\npotentially exculpatory evidence is permanently lost, courts face the\ntreacherous task of divining the import of materials whose contents are\nunknown and, very often, disputed.” Id. (citation omitted).\n    Due process does not demand government prescience. The Court has\ndistinguished the government’s obligation to recognize and preserve\nexculpatory evidence from an obligation to predict the exculpatory value of\nevidence or a source of evidence. A line of Supreme Court cases addressed the\napplication of due process to “potentially exculpatory evidence” the\ngovernment lost or destroyed, depriving the accused of the opportunity to\nextract something exonerative from independent investigation of that\nevidence. See Illinois v. Fisher, 540 U.S. 544, 548-49 (2004) (a plastic bag\ncontaining a white powdery substance forensics tests revealed to be cocaine);\nAriz. v. Youngblood, 488 U.S. 51, 52 (1988) (semen samples from the victim’s\nbody and clothing); Trombetta, 467 U.S. at 481 (breath sample of a suspected\ndrunken driver). The Trombetta Court found no due process violation when\nthe government acted “‘in good faith and in accord with their normal\npractice[,]’” and the loss or destruction of evidence was not attributable to a\n“conscious effort to suppress exculpatory evidence.” Id. at 488 (quoting\nKillian v. United States, 368 U.S. 231, 242 (1961)). The constitutional duty to\n\n   210   Id.\n   211   Id.\n    212 We acknowledge that the Fourteenth Amendment does not govern accused at\n\ncourts-martial. But our superior court has found the same right to present a complete\ndefense in the Fifth Amendment, applying Trombetta to courts-martial. United States\nv. Webb, 66 M.J. 89, 92 (C.A.A.F. 2008); see also United States v. Bess, 75 M.J. 70, 74\nn.3 (C.A.A.F. 2016) (finding no reason the right to present a complete defense would\nbe any narrower under the Fifth Amendment than the Fourteenth Amendment).\n\n\n                                          86\n\f                  United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\npreserve evidence applies to material evidence, which “must both possess an\nexculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence was destroyed, and\nbe of such a nature that the defendant would be unable to obtain comparable\nevidence by other reasonably available means.” Id. at 489. See also United\nStates v. Garries, 22 M.J. 288, 292 (C.M.A. 1986); United States v. Kern, 22\nM.J. 49, 51 (C.M.A. 1996). The Supreme Court subsequently confirmed that a\ndue process violation requires evidence of “bad faith” on the part of the\ngovernment when “potentially useful evidence”—but not “material\nexculpatory evidence”—is lost or destroyed. Fisher, 540 U.S. at 548-49 (citing\nYoungblood, 488 U.S.at 57). An accused cannot claim a due process right to\nevidence, or a source of evidence, with only the potential to yield something\nexculpatory, unless the government has lost or destroyed that evidence in bad\nfaith.\n    Although the appellant frames this AOE as a denial of discovery, it is\nmore accurately a denial of opportunity. He does not accuse the trial counsel\nor the government of withholding a piece of material exculpatory evidence.\nInstead, the government has allegedly withheld funding and support for an\nindependent investigation that might have uncovered something exculpatory.\nAt best, hypothetical evidence is potentially useful; therefore, the appellant\nmust attribute its loss or destruction to bad faith on the part of the\ngovernment. Id. Evidence of bad faith is missing here. We found no abuse of\ndiscretion in the military judge’s decision to deny a site visit to Hamdaniyah.\nThe appellant failed to demonstrate the required necessity of the site visit.\nNor did we find an abuse of discretion in the military judge’s conclusion that\nthe government did not violate discovery obligations during the original trial\ndefense counsel’s site visit to Hamdaniyah in January 2007. The appellant’s\nlost opportunity, attributable to circumstances beyond the U.S. government’s\ncontrol, does not equate to a lack of due process.\n   3. Effective representation\n    Invoking United States v. Strickland, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), the appellant\nimplies that counsel must conduct a site visit and independent investigation\nto be competent.\n    Legal representation is deemed ineffective under Strickland when the\nappellant can demonstrate that “(1) his counsel’s performance fell below an\nobjective standard of reasonableness; and (2) the counsel’s deficient\nperformance gives rise to a ‘reasonable probability’ that the result of the\nproceeding would have been different without counsel’s unprofessional\nerrors.” United States v. Akbar, 74 M.J. 364, 371 (C.A.A.F. 2015) (quoting\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 688, 694). “Trial defense counsel have ‘a duty to make\nreasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes\nparticular investigations unnecessary.’” Id. at 379 (quoting Strickland, 466\n\n\n                                      87\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nU.S. at 691) (emphasis added). “The Supreme Court has ‘rejected the notion\nthat the same [type and breadth of] investigation will be required in every\ncase.’” Id. at 380 (quoting Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S. 170, 195 (2011)\n(additional citation omitted) (alteration in original)).\n    The appellant overreaches when he claims that the Army Court of\nMilitary Review “intimated” that “‘failure to visit a crime scene ipso facto\ncontributes to deficient performance of trial’” in United States v. Boone, 39\nM.J. 541, 544 (A.C.M.R. 1994).213 The court adopted this concession for sake\nof argument before summarily dismissing it in Boone’s case. Id. Although\nBoone alleged his TDC’s “failure to visit the crime scenes . . . led to a serious\nfactual error in [his] closing argument[,]” the court found “there [was] no\nobvious prejudice to the appellant in [Boone’s] case.” Id. Nor has this court\nfound “deficiencies in defense counsel’s performance under the Strickland\nstandards” when counsel “was denied the ability to view the crime scene by\nthe Staff Judge Advocate and the military judge” and “had extreme difficulty\nin interviewing the witnesses[.]” United States v. Ryan, 2007 CCA LEXIS\n111, *11-*12, unpublished op. (N-M. Ct. Crim. App. 2007), rev’d. as to\nsentence, 65 M.J. 328 (C.A.A.F. 2007) (summary disposition). In a case similar\nto the one before us, civilian defense counsel declined to pursue a site visit to\nthe scene of an alleged murder in Afghanistan because “the area became so\nkinetic that U.S. forces withdrew from there altogether.” United States v.\nLorance, 2017 CCA LEXIS 429, *19 (A. Ct. Crim. App. 27 Jun 2017), rev.\ndenied, __ M.J. __, 2017 CAAF LEXIS 1165 (C.A.A.F. 19 Dec 2017). The\nArmy Court of Criminal Appeals found no merit in Lorance’s claim of\nineffective assistance of counsel in light of the defense team’s overall\nperformance and the lack of prejudice in the face of “overwhelming evidence\nagainst [him].” Id. at *18-*19. In the case before us, conditions on the ground\nin Hamdaniyah made trial defense counsel’s request to travel there to\ninvestigate unreasonable.\n    Not only does the appellant fail to demonstrate that denial of a site visit\nrobbed him of TDC performance within an objective standard of\nreasonableness, he fails to articulate how a site visit would have altered the\noutcome of his court-martial. His assertion of prejudice is detached from the\nfacts of his case and is almost circular; instead he claims that denial of a site\nvisit robbed him of his rights to a fair trial and due process. As discussed\npreviously, we disagree.\n   Instead, we find that the appellant benefited from zealous, competent\nrepresentation throughout his second court-martial. His TDC effectively\nchallenged the evidence brought from Iraq, and there were no Iraqi witnesses\n\n\n   213   Appellant’s Brief at 146.\n\n\n                                        88\n\f                  United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nto impeach. The strength of the government’s case lay in the testimony of the\nMarines and Navy corpsmen present in Hamdaniyah on the morning of 26\nApril 2006. Nothing in Iraq could have better equipped TDC to challenge\ntheir testimony.\n    The appellant does not point to a piece of evidence or witness whose\ntestimony would have altered the outcome of his trial. His assertion of\nprejudice is speculative. Not only has he failed to demonstrate that “his\ncounsel’s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,” he\nhas also failed to demonstrate that his “counsel’s performance gives rise to a\n‘reasonable probability’ that the result of the proceeding would have been\ndifferent without counsel’s unprofessional errors.” Akbar, 74 M.J. at 371.\nWithout either, there is no ineffective assistance of counsel.\nI. Admissibility of identification on autopsy report\n    The appellant claims that the military judge abused his discretion when\nhe admitted an autopsy report whose relevance depended upon impermissible\ntestimonial hearsay from Iraqi citizens who identified the body.\n    This AOE presents us with hearsay within hearsay—alleged testimonial\nhearsay appearing in a routine professional report prepared by and informing\nthe testimony of an expert witness. Whether the imbedded evidence was\ntestimonial hearsay is a question of law we review de novo. United States v.\nKatso, 74 M.J. 273, 278 (C.A.A.F. 2015) (citing United States v. Tearman, 72\nM.J. 54, 58 (C.A.A.F. 2013)). We review the military judge’s decision to admit\nevidence that contains testimonial hearsay for an abuse of discretion,\n“‘considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing\nparty.’” Katso, 74 M.J. at 278-79 (quoting United States v. Reister, 44 M.J.\n409, 413 (C.A.A.F. 1996)).\n   1. Testimonial hearsay\n    First we examine the appellant’s allegation of testimonial hearsay.\n“[A]dmission of ‘testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at\ntrial’” violates the Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause unless the\nwitness is “‘unavailable to testify, and the [accused] had had a prior\nopportunity for cross-examination.’” Id. at 278 (quoting Crawford, 541 U.S. at\n53-54); U.S. CONST., amend VI. In Crawford, the Supreme Court defined\ntestimony as “typically ‘[a] solemn declaration or affirmation made for the\npurpose of establishing or proving some fact.’ . . . An accuser who makes a\nformal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a\nperson who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not.” 541 U.S. at\n51 (quoting 2 N. WEBSTER, AN AMERICAN DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH\nLANGUAGE (1828)) (alteration in original). Our superior court has\ncharacterized a statement as testimonial “‘if made under circumstances\n\n\n                                     89\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nwhich would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the\nstatement would be available for use at a later trial.’” Katso, 74 M.J. at 278\n(quoting United States v. Sweeney, 70 M.J. 296, 301 (C.A.A.F. 2011)\n(additional citations omitted). There are also three factors to guide this\nobjective, but contextual, analysis, often referred to as Rankin factors:\n            (1) the statement was elicited by or made in response to law\n         enforcement or prosecutorial inquiry;\n             (2) the statement involved more than a routine and\n         objective cataloging of unambiguous factual matters; and\n             (3) the primary purpose for making, or eliciting, the\n         statement was the production of evidence with an eye toward\n         trial.\nUnited States v. Squire, 72 M.J. 285, 288 (C.A.A.F. 2013) (citing United\nStates v. Gardinier, 65 M.J. 60, 65 (C.A.A.F. 2007)); United States v. Rankin,\n64 M.J. 348, 352 (C.A.A.F. 2007)).\n    The appellant asserts that the identification of the body exhumed and\nautopsied in the course of investigating this case constitutes testimonial\nhearsay. The lead NCIS agent, Special Agent (SA) J.C., testified about his\nefforts to exhume the body of the man shot in the IED crater on 26 April\n2006. The victim’s family led a convoy of military personnel, including SA\nJ.C., to the burial site, but an IED detonated under one of the vehicles in the\nconvoy en route to the site. SA J.C. never reached the burial site that day. At\nSA J.C.’s request, the appellant’s company commander visited the victim’s\nfamily and obtained GPS coordinates for the burial site. The company\ncommander testified during the second court-martial but was not asked to\nconfirm that he collected GPS coordinates of the burial site from the family at\nSA J.C.’s request. Following the GPS coordinates, a second convoy traveled to\nthe site, and SA J.C. led the exhumation. SA J.C. testified that the victim’s\nbrother accompanied him to the burial site, pointed to the grave, “and at one\npoint, he started digging in the grave site.”214 No Iraqi witness was subject to\ncross-examination or made available for either trial of the appellant.\n    Applying the Rankin factors to this information, we find it constitutes\ntestimonial hearsay. 72 M.J. at 288. First, the victim’s family revealed the\nburial site location at the request of NCIS, a law enforcement entity\nsupporting the Navy and Marine Corps. Second, the information involved the\nrecent death of a family member. The family attributed the death to\nAmerican service members and had pressed a complaint with the military\nleadership in the area. “[T]he statement involved more than a routine and\n\n   214   Record at 1515.\n\n\n                                       90\n\f                        United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nobjective cataloging of unambiguous factual matters[.]” Id. Finally, NCIS\nrequested the information after securing an order to exhume the Iraqi\ncitizen’s remains with the intent to transport them to the United States for\nan autopsy. During cross-examination, SA J.C. acknowledged the difficulty in\nobtaining the exhumation order. As NCIS sought the autopsy in furtherance\nof its investigation of serious criminal offenses, presentation of the resulting\nevidence at court-martial was a possible, if not likely and intended, outcome.\n   2. Admissibility of the autopsy report\n    Having found there was testimonial hearsay in identification of the body\nautopsied, we now turn to whether it rendered the medical examiner’s report\nand testimony inadmissible. TDC objected to admission of the autopsy report\nbased on hearsay and lack of relevance. With regard to hearsay, the military\njudge ruled from the bench that the report satisfied the hearsay exception for\nrecords of regularly conducted activities under MIL. R. EVID. 803(6). As to\nrelevance, TDC protested, “[t]hey haven’t even identified the body yet, sir, if\nthis is even the person that they should be doing [the] autopsy report on.” 215\nThe military judge acknowledged, “that’s certainly a link in the chain that\nthe government—they got that problem.”216 But then the military judge\nposited that “wounds consistent to what witnesses have testified to being\ninflicted on [the victim]” were circumstantial evidence of identity and thus\nrelevant and admissible.217\n    TDC did not explicitly invoke testimonial hearsay and the Confrontation\nClause in his objection to the autopsy report. Nevertheless, the references to\nlinks in the chain on the record reveal the parties’ cognizance of flaws in the\nbody’s chain of custody. Testimonial hearsay formed not just a weak link but\nthe chain’s questionable origin. To determine whether the testimonial\nhearsay should have resulted in exclusion of this report from evidence, we\nexamine the significance of that testimonial hearsay to the report and\ntestimony about it.\n   When testimonial hearsay is presented to the court through an expert\nwitness, we determine whether that expert testimony violates the\nConfrontation Clause by asking:\n          First, did the expert’s testimony rely in some way on out-of-\n          court statements that were themselves testimonial?\n\n\n\n\n   215   Id. at 1814.\n   216   Id.\n   217   Id.\n\n\n                                          91\n\f                        United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n          Second, if so, was the expert’s testimony nonetheless\n          admissible because he reached his own conclusions based on\n          knowledge of the underlying data and facts, such that the\n          expert himself, not the out-of-court declarant, was the ‘witness\n          against [the appellant]’ under the Sixth Amendment?\nKatso, 74 M.J. at 279 (citing Crawford, 541 U.S. at 44, 51-52) (additional\ncitations omitted). Put another way, we ask whether the expert witness “had\nsufficient personal knowledge to reach an independent conclusion as to the\nobject of his testimony and his expert opinion.” Id. at 280 (citing United\nStates v. Blazier (Blazier II), 69 M.J. 218, 224-25 (C.A.A.F. 2010)).\n    Navy CAPT S.L., the Deputy Medical Examiner at the Armed Forces\nMedical Examiner at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, conducted the\nautopsy, authored the report, and authenticated it while testifying at the\nappellant’s second court-martial. After the NCIS-directed exhumation of the\nbody identified as the shooting victim in this case, Master-at-Arms Second\nClass (MA2) I.D. accepted custody of the body from “mortuary affairs”218 on 6\nJune 2006 and escorted it from Camp Fallujah, Iraq, to Dover. An NCIS\nagent met MA2 ID when he landed at Dover and took custody of the body\nfrom him. On 8 June 2006, CAPT SL, performed the autopsy.219 His report of\n6 July 2006 includes a “[p]resumptive identification . . . established by\naccompanying documentation and photographs.”220 CAPT S.L. testified that\nNCIS typically provided a history on a decedent “[t]o give us some\nbackground information. . . . You have to get something specific to focus your\nattention on.”221 Based on the information provided by NCIS, the decedent\nwas “believed to be” H.I.A., a 52-year-old Iraqi civilian who died in\nHamdaniyah, Iraq on 26 April 2006.222 For the circumstances of death,\n“[i]nvestigation reports that United States Military Personnel detained this\nIraqi civilian, bound him with flexible cuffs, and shot him multiple times at\ndifferent ranges of fire.”223\n    The remaining 14 pages of the report detailed CAPT S.L.’s external and\ninternal examinations of the body and its injuries, his diagnosis, and his\nopinion. Descriptions of the gunshot wounds to the body comprised the\nmajority of the report and supported CAPT S.L.’s diagnosis of multiple\n\n   218   Id. at 1826.\n   219   PE 88 at 1, 15.\n   220   Id. at 1.\n   221   Record at 1861.\n   222   PE 88 at 1, Record at 1887.\n   223   PE 88 at 1.\n\n\n                                          92\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\ngunshot wounds as the cause of death. Responding to the information that\nthe shooting victim was bound, CAPT S.L. noted that “[d]issection into the\nskin and soft tissues of the wrists and ankles revealed no hemorrhage or\nother injury, which might be expected if the individual was bound.”224 But the\nuse of flexible cuffs and the advanced state of composition prevented him\nfrom excluding the possibility that he was bound. CAPT S.L. also commented\non findings from which he could infer that the man “had some degree of\ndifficulty with ambulation.”225 Nowhere in the report did CAPT S.L. appear to\nrely on any information from NCIS to form his opinion.\n    Qualified as an expert witness in forensic pathology, CAPT S.L.\nauthenticated and explained his report, including the process of performing\nan autopsy and his specific findings in this case. TC asked CAPT S.L. about\nthe trajectory of gunshot wounds, the existence of stippling and its evidence\nof the range of the shot, and his interpretation of metal fragments recovered\nfrom the body. CAPT S.L.’s testimony relied almost entirely on the\napplication of his expertise to observations he made during an autopsy he\nperformed.226 He relied on the purported identity of the body, the\ncircumstances surrounding the death, or anything else flowing from the\ntestimonial hearsay only for the nexus they created between the body and\nthis case. Presented with background details such as the possible use of\nflexible handcuffs, the purported victim’s reported limp, and the location of\ngunshot wounds, he indicated whether his autopsy findings were consistent,\nor inconsistent, with such facts. Ultimately the relevance of the report, not\nthe report’s findings themselves, relied on testimonial hearsay.\n    With some reliance on the testimonial hearsay, we proceed to the second\nKatso factor—whether the expert’s testimony was nonetheless admissible\nbecause he reached his own conclusions based on knowledge of the\nunderlying data and facts, and his opinions, not those of an out-of-court\ndeclarant, were subject to the cross-examination required by the\nConfrontation Clause. 74 M.J. at 279. While testimonial hearsay formed the\nbasis of the relevance of CAPT S.L.’s report and testimony to this case, the\nconclusions in the report and testimony suggest no reliance on that\ntestimonial hearsay.

New Mexico, 564 U.S. 647, 661 (2011) (holding that the\nConfrontation Clause requires that prosecutors call the analysts who write the\nreports to introduce them into evidence).\n\n\n                                        93\n\f                        United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nour conclusion that testimonial hearsay was incidental, not foundational, to\nCAPT S.L.’s report, testimony, and opinion. Furthermore, CAPT S.L.\nacknowledged early in cross-examination that he had not independently\nidentified the body he autopsied through DNA, dental records, fingerprints,\nor other scientific methods. But other than reporting the background\ninformation NCIS provided, CAPT S.L. did not opine on the identity of the\nbody in his report or his testimony. We conclude CAPT S.L. demonstrated\nsufficient personal knowledge, education, and expertise to reach the\nindependent conclusions of his report and testimony. Id. at 280.\n    In his closing argument, TC minimized the significance of the identity of\nthe body in the autopsy report and asked members “to consider the\ncircumstantial evidence. Look at the wound patterns.”227 TC encouraged the\nmembers to compare the wounds CAPT S.L. highlighted on the autopsy\nreport to the photograph of the man killed in the IED crater on 26 April 2006.\nThis was circumstantial evidence from which the members could identify the\nbody as that of the man killed in the IED crater on 26 April 2006. Even\nwithout the direct evidence of a fully documented chain of custody for the\nbody, circumstantial evidence in the report tying the body to the victim in\nthis court-martial was sufficient to render the report relevant. See United\nStates v. Hurt, 27 C.M.R. 3, 31 (C.M.A. 1958) (citing United States v. Walker,\n6 U.S.C.M.A. 158 (C.M.A. 1955) (holding that circumstantial evidence can be\nas dispositive as direct evidence).\n    The problems in the body’s chain of custody and the reliance on\ntestimonial hearsay to link the body to this case affected the weight of the\nautopsy report, not its admissibility. Testimonial hearsay and identity were\nnot so imbedded in the expert’s report and testimony as to violate the\nappellant’s right of confrontation and render the report and subsequent\ntestimony inadmissible. We find no abuse of discretion in the military judge’s\nfinding that the report and testimony were admissible.\nJ. Failure to Grant a Mistrial\n   The appellant contends that the military judge abused his discretion\nwhen he declined to grant a mistrial after the lead NCIS agent testified\nbefore members that the appellant “invoked at the interview.”228\n    “We will not reverse a military judge’s determination on a mistrial absent\nclear evidence of an abuse of discretion.” Ashby, 68 M.J. at 122 (citing United\nStates v. Rushatz, 31 M.J. 450, 456 (C.M.A. 1990)).\n\n\n\n   227   Record at 2306.\n   228   Id. at 1417.\n\n\n                                          94\n\f                    United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n    A military judge “may, as a matter of discretion, declare a mistrial when\nsuch action is manifestly necessary in the interest of justice because of\ncircumstances arising during the proceedings which cast substantial doubt\nupon the fairness of the proceedings.” R.C.M. 915(a). But “a mistrial is an\nunusual and disfavored remedy. It should be applied only as a last resort to\nprotect the guarantee for a fair trial.” United States v. Diaz, 59 M.J. 79, 90\n(C.A.A.F. 2003). “A curative instruction is the preferred remedy, and the\ngranting of a mistrial is an extreme remedy which should only be done when\n‘inadmissible matters so prejudicial that a curative instruction would be\ninadequate are brought to the attention of the members.’” Diaz, 59 M.J. at 92\n(quoting R.C.M. 915(a), Discussion).\n    Inadmissible matters include mention that an accused exercised his or\nher rights under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution or Article 31(b),\nUCMJ, by remaining silent, refusing to answer a question, requesting\ncounsel, or requesting to terminate an interview. MIL. R. EVID. 301(f)(2). The\nerroneous presentation of such evidence to members implicates constitutional\nrights; therefore, to be harmless, “‘the court must be able to declare a belief\nthat it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.’” United States v. Moran, 65\nM.J. 178, 187 (C.A.A.F. 2007) (quoting Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18,\n24 (1967)). The inadmissible evidence must not have contributed to the\nverdict. Id. To determine an error does not contribute to the verdict is “‘to\nfind that error unimportant in relation to everything else the jury considered\non the issue in question, as revealed in the record.’” Id. (quoting Yates v.\nEvatt, 500 U.S. 391, 403 (1991), overruled on other grounds by Estelle v.\nMcGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 72 n.4 (1991)).\n   1. “[H]e invoked”\n    In this case, the inadmissible evidence of the appellant’s invocation of his\nright to remain silent came from the lead investigator, SA J.C. SA J.C. was\non the stand authenticating physical evidence in the government’s case. The\nprosecutor asked him if he confronted the appellant with the appellant’s\nafter-action report about the shooting, and SA J.C. responded:\n              Well, I don’t remember specifically showing that to him at\n          that time. But like I said, eventually after a time into the\n          interview, it was time to start playing some of our cards that\n          we had developed through some of the other interviews\n          through some of the other squad members from earlier in the\n          day. And at which time, he invoked at the interview.229\n\n\n\n\n   229   Id.\n\n\n                                       95\n\f                       United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n    TDC objected immediately, requested a mistrial, and protested, “[h]e’s\ngoing into Sergeant Hutchins’s Constitutional right to remain silent.”230 At a\nbrief Article 39(a), UCMJ, session immediately following the comments and\nobjection, the military judge decided to give the members a curative\ninstruction right away but to postpone litigation of the motion for a mistrial\nuntil the next morning. As soon as the members reassembled in the\ncourtroom, the military judge admonished them to disregard any invocation\nof rights by the appellant231 and then confirmed with them as a group that\nthey understood.\n    The following day, after hearing arguments from both parties, the\nmilitary judge adopted TDC’s proposed curative instruction232 and agreed to\nconduct individual voir dire of the members. We must now determine\nwhether—in light of the requirement that the members’ exposure to the\ninadmissible evidence be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt—the military\njudge abused his discretion in declining to declare a mistrial. He briefly made\nfindings of fact from the bench:\n          [W]hat I found here is that this was a [sic] isolated reference to\n          a singular invocation of rights by the witness. It was extremely\n          brief. There are no details about the rights invoked or the\n          offense or offenses to which the rights were invoked. We\n          immediately called a[n Article] 39(a) [session]. I immediately\n          gave instructions to disregard. I find that the inadmissible\n          invocation testimony didn’t have any direct bearing on the\n\n\n\n   230   Id.\n   231   The military judge told the members:\n               Members, you heard some testimony that suggesting, perhaps,\n          that the accused in this case may have invoked some rights when\n          being questioned by this witness. That’s a completely improper\n          discussion point for us here. It’s irrelevant to your consideration, and\n          it’s never, ever, to be held against anyone accused of a crime that they\n          invoked, whether they invoked, whether they didn’t invoke.\n              It’s not to be considered by you for any reason whatsoever. That\n          testimony is stricken, and it’s to be completely disregard [sic] by you\n          for any purpose whatsoever. It will not be held against Sergeant\n          Hutchins in any manner whatsoever. If you all understand that,\n          could you please indicate by raising your hand.\n               That’s an affirmative response from all the members.\n   Id. at 1419-20.\n   232   AE CXLVIII; Record at 1450-51.\n\n\n                                            96\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n         testimony prior to it. It was toward the end and was unrelated\n         to the other issues in any substantive manner.233\n   The military judge did not articulate the legal standard he followed, but\nhe referred counsel to two cases: United States v. Sidwell, 51 M.J. 262\n(C.A.A.F 1999) and United States v. Boore, 2014 CCA LEXIS 609,\nunpublished op. (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 21 Aug 2014) (per curiam).\n   2. Sidwell test\n    In Sidwell, the CAAF analyzed testimony from a law enforcement agent\nwho uttered, “[s]ubsequent to [Sidwell] invoking his rights, he made – ” before\nbeing interrupted by trial defense counsel’s objection. 51 M.J. at 263\n(emphasis in original). To assess the possible prejudice resulting from this\nerroneous admission and gauge whether it was, instead, harmless beyond a\nreasonable doubt, the CAAF considered three things: the nature of the\ncomment, the curative instruction given, and the “effect of the error on the\nother prosecution and defense evidence presented in the case.” Id. at 265\n(citing United States v. Riley, 47 M.J. 276, 279-80 (C.A.A.F. 1997)). The CAAF\nconcluded that, “viewed in its entirety, [the error] did not have great\npotential to prejudice appellant.” Id. In support of their conclusion, the CAAF\ncited the isolated nature of the reference, its extreme brevity, the immediacy\nwith which the military judge called an Article 39(a), UCMJ, session, the\nprompt instruction to the members to disregard the evidence, and trial\ncounsel’s silence about Sidwell’s invocation in argument. Id.\n    The military judge’s factual findings mirrored those on which the CAAF\nrelied, in part, in Sidwell. The record supports his characterization of SA\nJ.C.’s comment as isolated and extremely brief. Aside from the trial counsel’s\nquestion about the appellant’s after-action report and SA J.C.’s reference to\nthe other squad members’ interviews, this statement was bereft of context.\nTrial defense counsel’s objection, the Article 39(a), UCMJ, session, and the\ninitial curative instruction came in quick succession. TC then asked SA J.C.\none more brief question about the appellant’s interview and his after-action\nreport before returning to the authentication of physical evidence.\n    The next day, the military judge adopted the appellant’s proposed\ncurative instruction and read it to members before TDC began his cross-\nexamination of SA J.C. While the appellant does not object to the content of\nhis own curative instruction, we nevertheless note that it closely hews to the\ncurative instruction in United States v. Garrett, 24 M.J. 413, 417 (C.M.A.\n1987), which the CAAF has endorsed. See Sidwell, 51 M.J. at 265; United\nStates v. Whitney, 55 M.J. 413, 416 (C.A.A.F. 2001). After reminding the\n\n\n   233   Record at 1435.\n\n\n                                       97\n\f                        United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nmembers that they all enjoyed the “absolute and moral right to exercise their\nconstitutional privileges,” the military judge echoed the Garrett instruction in\nstating:\n              The only thing that matters in this case is that Sergeant\n          Hutchins always has a constitutional right to exercise his legal\n          prerogative and no adverse result may obtain from his exercise\n          of those constitutional rights. You may not infer guilt, nor may\n          you infer any other fact based on Sergeant Hutchins’ proper\n          exercise of his constitutional rights.234\n    The military judge then conducted individual voir dire of the members,\nconfirming their ability to follow the instruction. “Absent evidence to the\ncontrary, court members are presumed to comply with the military judge’s\ninstructions.” United States v. Thompkins, 58 M.J. 43, 47 (C.A.A.F. 2003)\n(citations omitted). There is no evidence the members disregarded the\nmilitary judge’s instructions.\n    Finally, we consider the impact of the error on the subsequent\npresentation of evidence. The appellant does not allege any impact on the rest\nof the case. Suppression of the appellant’s statements to NCIS and the\nrelated reversal of his first court-martial had already transformed the\nappellant’s statements to SA J.C. into a third rail for the government. The\nprosecution focused some attention on the appellant’s after-action report,\nwhich was the subject of the only false official statement charge against the\nappellant. But the appellant’s interviews with NCIS were otherwise absent\nfrom the government’s case. Nor did the trial counsel allude to the appellant’s\ninvocation in his closing argument.\n    Errant mention of the invocation did not affect the trial defense team’s\npresentation of evidence either. Recognizing that the strongest evidence\nagainst the appellant lay in the testimony of his squad mates, TDC focused\non attacking their interrogations and testimony at the first court-martial.\nAccording to the defense theory, the appellant’s guilt was an NCIS\nfabrication imposed on the frightened and coerced members of the appellant’s\nsquad. SA J.C. had not confronted the appellant with a truth he could not\nrefute. SA J.C. had confronted the appellant with a concocted version of\nevents. The appellant’s decision to remain silent did not matter.\n    Instead of pointing to where the error manifested elsewhere in the trial,\nthe appellant alleges substantial prejudice by framing SA J.C.’s brief\nstatement as improper lie detector testimony. According to the appellant,\nmembers were left with the impression that SA J.C. “determined Sgt\n\n\n   234   Id. at 1451.\n\n\n                                          98\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nHutchins was lying during the initial portion of the interrogation, so then he\nconfronted Sgt Hutchins with the overwhelming evidence of guilt—the\n‘cards’—, and that caused Sgt Hutchins to opt for silence because he could not\nexplain it away.”235\n    We do not find that argument persuasive. The members acquitted the\nappellant of the sole specification of false official statement for submitting his\nafter-action report. This acquittal indicates that their findings of guilty did\nnot rely on their assessments of the appellant’s credibility. Nor do we believe\ntheir findings relied on SA J.C.’s assessment of his credibility. Without the\ncontext of the appellant’s interrogations, SA J.C.’s comment came in a\nvacuum and simply did not carry the weight the defense alleges. SA J.C. was\nnot an expert or other authoritative witness on whom members might unduly\nrely for his insight. Cf Diaz, 59 M.J. at 93 (concluding that a curative\ninstruction was inadequate to correct the expert witness’s testimony that\nDiaz murdered the victim).\n   Secondly, the appellant argues that the members would interpret the\ninvocation in conjunction with their knowledge of a prior trial set aside for\nsome technicality and assume only someone guilty would face retrial. This\nargument requires us to assume the members disregarded the military\njudge’s clear instruction about everything from the presumption of innocence\nand the burden of proof to inferring guilt from the act of invocation. Without\nany evidence to support such an assumption, we decline to do so.\n    We find no clear error in the military judge’s finding that the reference to\ninvocation was so brief and isolated as to be effectively cured by the\ninstructions he promptly gave. Notably, those curative instructions were\nconsistent with curative instructions the CAAF has favorably endorsed under\nsimilar circumstances. See Sidwell, 51 M.J. at 265. We conclude that the\nmilitary judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the appellant’s motion\nfor a mistrial.\nK. Cumulative error\n   The appellant urges us to set aside the findings and sentence based on the\ncumulative effect of the errors in this case.\n   “The cumulative effect of all plain errors and preserved errors is reviewed\nde novo.” United States v. Pope, 69 M.J. 328, 335 (C.A.A.F. 2011). When the\naccumulation of errors deprived the appellant of a fair trial, Article 59(a),\nUCMJ, compels us to reverse it. United States v. Banks, 36 M.J. 150, 171\n(C.M.A. 1992).\n\n\n\n   235   Appellant’s Brief at 161.\n\n\n                                        99\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n   Despite the military judge’s failure to consider the appellant’s proffered\nacquittal of conspiring to kill anyone other than S.G., we ultimately found no\nerror in the admission of the evidence of a conspiracy to commit Plans B and\nC.\n    We found only one error in the course of this trial—NCIS SA J.C.’s\nreference to the appellant’s invocation of his right to remain silent. As\npreviously discussed in section J., not one but two curative instructions\nsufficiently addressed any risk of prejudice from the members’ brief exposure\nto evidence the appellant invoked his right to remain silent.\n    These two errors, even in aggregate, did not deprive the appellant of a fair\ntrial, and Article 59(a), UCMJ, does not require reversal. Further, we decline\nthe appellant’s invitation to set aside the findings and sentence under Article\n66(c).236\nL. Sentence appropriateness\n   The appellant argues that his sentence “was excessive and\ndisproportionate,” particularly in light of his squad members’ and co-\nconspirators’ sentences.\n    Article 66(c), UCMJ, requires us to approve a court-martial sentence only\nif we find it “correct in law and fact and [determine], on the basis of the entire\nrecord, [that it] should be approved.” “The power to review a case for sentence\nappropriateness, which reflects the unique history and attributes of the\nmilitary justice system, includes but is not limited to considerations of\nuniformity and evenhandedness of sentencing decisions.” United States v.\nSothen, 54 M.J. 294, 296 (C.A.A.F. 2001) (citing United States v. Lacy, 50\nM.J. 286, 287-88 (C.A.A.F. 1999)) (additional citation omitted). Uniformity in\nsentencing is typically subsumed in the discretionary assessment of\nappropriateness encompassed in our Article 66, UCMJ, review authority. But\nin certain circumstances, sentence disparity can rise to a question of law.\n   1. Sentence disparity\n    Assessing sentence appropriateness by comparison to other cases has long\nbeen disfavored, except in specific circumstances. See United States v.\nBallard, 20 M.J. 282, 283 (C.M.A. 1985) (“It is well settled that, except in\nthose rare instances in which sentence appropriateness can be fairly\ndetermined only by reference to disparate sentences adjudged in closely\nrelated cases, such as those of accomplices, sentence appropriateness should\nbe determined without reference to or comparison with the sentences\nreceived by other offenders.” (citation omitted)). The burden falls on the\nappellant to demonstrate those exceptional circumstances: (1) the cases the\n\n   236   Id. at 163-64.\n\n\n                                        100\n\f                       United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nappellant cites for comparison are “‘closely related’ to his or her case” and (2)\n“the sentences are ‘highly disparate.’” Lacy, 50 M.J. at 288 (internal citations\nomitted in original). If the appellant succeeds on both prongs, then the\nburden shifts to the government to “show that there is a rational basis for the\ndisparity.” Id.; see also United States v. Kelly, 40 M.J. 558, 570 (N.M.C.M.R.\n1994) (noting that Article 66, UCMJ, authorizes reduction of “widely\ndisparate dispositions or sentences” between “closely related” cases when\n“unsupported by good and cogent reasons”).\n    Cases may be “closely related” by virtue of “coactors involved in a common\ncrime, servicemembers involved in a common or parallel scheme, or some\nother direct nexus between the servicemembers whose sentences are sought\nto be compared[.]” Lacy, 50 M.J. at 288. See also Kelly, 40 M.J. at 570\n(defining “closely related” cases as those that “involve offenses that are\nsimilar in both nature and seriousness or which arise from a common scheme\nor design”). The appellant and his seven squad mates were accused of being\nparty to the same conspiracy. The charges referred against all of them arose\nfrom the same course of events. We need not belabor our determination that\nthe appellant’s case is closely related to his squad mates’ and co-conspirators’\ncases. Thus we turn to whether the outcomes were highly disparate.\n    On appeal, the appellant alleges that his sentence is highly disparate\nbecause none of his squad mates served more than 18 months of confinement,\nand only two left the Marine Corps with bad-conduct discharges.237 To meet\nhis burden, the appellant submits his squad mates’ “final approved\nsentences” and details their convictions, punitive discharges where\napplicable, and confinement served.238 However, we gauge disparity among\nclosely related cases based on adjudged sentences, not approved sentences.\nSee United States v. Roach, 69 M.J. 17, 21 (C.A.A.F. 2010) (clarifying that\nCourts of Criminal Appeals compare the adjudged sentences of closely related\ncases because “there are several intervening and independent factors\nbetween trial and appeal—including discretionary grants of clemency and\nlimits from pretrial agreements—that might properly create the disparity in\nwhat are otherwise closely related cases”). Disparity is also relative to the\nmaximum punishment an accused faces. Lacy, 50 M.J. at 289.\n    The appellant was found guilty of conspiracy to commit larceny, false\nofficial statements, murder, and obstruction of justice, unpremeditated\nmurder, and larceny of a shovel and an AK-47 assault rifle and faced a\ndishonorable discharge and life imprisonment.239 He was sentenced to a bad-\n\n   237   Id. at 166.\n   238   Id. at 165-66.\n   239   AE CXCIII.\n\n\n                                         101\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nconduct discharge and 2,627 days’ confinement, which equated to time\nserved.240 Military judges awarded all five of the most junior members of the\nappellant’s squad dishonorable discharges and sentences to confinement\nranging from five to 14 years.241 Only PFC Jodka received a shorter sentence\nof confinement than the appellant. With the exception of LCpl Pennington,\nthe junior squad members pleaded guilty to less serious charges and faced far\nless than confinement for life. Only LCpl Pennington pleaded guilty to\nconspiracy to commit murder, and he was awarded 14 years’ confinement.\nPursuant to pretrial agreements, the CA significantly reduced their terms of\nconfinement and disapproved their punitive discharges. Any disparity\nbetween the appellant’s sentence and his junior squad members’ adjudged\nsentences lay in the relative leniency he received. Perhaps for this reason, the\nappellant asks us to limit the pool of closely related cases to Cpl Thomas and\nCpl Magincalda. But he cites no authority for his self-serving selection of\ncomparables.\n    Both Cpl Thomas and Cpl Magincalda pleaded not guilty to all charges\nbefore panels with enlisted representation but were convicted of conspiracy to\ncommit murder and other less serious charges.242 Members sentenced Cpl\nThomas to a bad-conduct discharge and reduction to pay grade E-1.243 Cpl\nMagincalda was awarded 448 days’ confinement (time served) and reduction\nto pay grade E-1.\n    Assuming, arguendo, we disregard the sentences military judges handed\ndown and find the appellant’s sentence to be highly disparate among\nmembers’ sentences, we look at whether the government has offered “a\nrational basis for disparity.” Lacy, 50 M.J. at 288. The government argues\nthat the appellant’s position as squad leader and highest ranking member of\nthe conspiracy is the rational basis for the disparity. Citing squad member\ntestimony, the government asserts that the appellant\n          first raised the topic and hatched the scheme to commit\n          murder, . . . asked each junior Marine and Sailor to agree to\n          engage in the plot, . . . gave the order to fire, . . . [and] held two\n          meetings with the squad to encourage them to “stick to the\n          story.” In short, Appellant was the mastermind of this plot—\n          from inception, to firing the fatal shots into the Victim’s face as\n\n\n\n   240   AE CXCVII.\n   241   Staff Judge Advocate’s Recommendation of 18 Sep 2015, Enclosures (4)–(8).\n   242   Id., Enclosures (9) and (10).\n   243   Id., Enclosure (9).\n\n\n                                          102\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n         he gurgled his last breathes [sic], to orchestrating the cover-\n         up.244\nThe record supports the appellant’s leadership role in the formation and\nexecution of the conspiracy and lacks any evidence that one of the more\ncombat-experienced corporals superseded him. While we do not find the\nappellant’s sentence to be highly disparate, the presence of a rational basis\nand good and cogent reasons for a more severe sentence for the appellant\neffectively rebuts the appellant’s claim of a highly disparate sentence among\nclosely related cases. See e.g., United States v. Fee, 50 M.J. 290, 291-92\n(C.A.A.F. 1999) (upholding this court’s affirmation of allegedly highly\ndisparate sentences awarded to a wife and husband based on the\nidentification of “a rational basis for the differences in the sentences”).\n   Thus we are left with the more generalized assessment of the\nappropriateness of the appellant’s sentence.\n   2. Sentence appropriateness\n   Article 66, UCMJ, obliges us to evaluate the appellant’s sentence\nindependently for appropriateness. See United States v. Baier, 60 M.J. 382,\n384-85 (C.A.A.F. 2005). We review sentence appropriateness de novo. United\nStates v. Lane, 64 M.J. 1, 2 (C.A.A.F. 2006).\n    “Sentence appropriateness involves the judicial function of assuring that\njustice is done and that the accused gets the punishment he deserves.” Healy,\n26 M.J. at 395. This requires our “‘individualized consideration’ of the\nparticular accused ‘on the basis of the nature and seriousness of the offense\nand the character of the offender.’” United States v. Snelling, 14 M.J. 267, 268\n(C.M.A. 1988) (quoting United States v. Mamaluy, 27 C.M.R. 176, 180-81\n(C.M.A. 1959)). In making this assessment, we analyze the record as a whole.\nHealy, 26 M.J. at 395. Notwithstanding our significant discretion to\ndetermine appropriateness, we may not engage in acts of clemency, which is\nthe prerogative of the CA. United States v. Nerad, 69 M.J. 138, 146 (C.A.A.F.\n2010).\n   As the appellant requests, we may consider approved as well as adjudged\nsentences in companion cases when assessing sentence appropriateness. See\nRoach, 69 M.J. at 21 (“In contrast, when the CCA (Courts of Criminal\nAppeals) is exercising its power over sentence appropriateness generally, it\nmay consider both adjudged and approved sentences.”). The CA in this case\nnegotiated pretrial agreements with the five junior squad members and\ngranted clemency to LCpl Pennington, greatly reducing their sentences. But\neven Article 66, UCMJ, does not grant CCAs the same unfettered discretion\n\n   244   Answer on Behalf of Appellee of 20 Dec 2016 at 150-51 (citations omitted).\n\n\n                                          103\n\f                  United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nCAs enjoyed under Article 60, UCMJ, or command prerogative. See Nerad, 69\nM.J. at 145. “While the CCA clearly has the authority to disapprove part or\nall of the sentence and findings, nothing suggests that Congress intended to\nprovide the CCAs with unfettered discretion to do so for any reason, for no\nreason, or on equitable grounds[.]” Id. Uniformity of sentence is but one\nconsideration when evaluating appropriateness,245 and equity is not a proper\nbasis for disapproving a sentence.\n    Considering the entire record, there is nothing excessive or\ndisproportionate about a sentence to a bad-conduct discharge and less than\neight years’ confinement for the murder of the unknown Iraqi man in this\ncase. The appellant’s widespread reputation as a charismatic and effective\nleader of Marines and his compelling account of his confinement following his\nfirst court-martial earned him significant extenuation and mitigation and\nspared him a dishonorable discharge and a return to confinement. Further\nreduction of his sentence would not be an act of justice but of mercy, or\nperhaps equity, and beyond our authority under Article 66, UCMJ. See id.\nM. Legal and factual sufficiency\n    Finally, the appellant alleges that the case against him was legally and\nfactually insufficient.\n    We review the legal and factual sufficiency of evidence de novo. Art. 66(c),\nUCMJ; United States v. Washington, 57 M.J. 394, 399 (C.A.A.F. 2002). The\ntest for the legal sufficiency of evidence is “whether, considering the evidence\nin the light most favorable to the prosecution, a reasonable factfinder could\nhave found all the essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt.” United\nStates v. Turner, 25 M.J. 324 (C.M.A. 1987) (quoting Jackson v. Virginia, 443\nU.S. 307, 319 (1979)). In resolving questions of legal sufficiency, “we are\nbound to draw every reasonable inference from the evidence of record in favor\nof the prosecution.” United States v. Barner, 56 M.J. 131, 134 (C.A.A.F. 2001)\n(citations omitted).\n    “For factual sufficiency, the test is whether, after weighing the evidence\nin the record of trial and making allowances for not having personally\nobserved the witnesses, the members of the [appellate court] are themselves\nconvinced of the accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Turner, 25 M.J.\nat 325. “Such a review involves a fresh, impartial look at the evidence, giving\nno deference to the decision of the trial court on factual sufficiency beyond the\nadmonition in Article 66(c), UCMJ, to take into account the fact that the trial\n\n   245 See Snelling, 14 M.J. at 268 (“However proper it may be for the convening\nauthority and [Courts of Criminal Appeals] to consider sentence comparison as an\naspect of sentence appropriateness, it is only one of many aspects of that\nconsideration.”) (citations omitted).\n\n\n                                      104\n\f                  United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\ncourt saw and heard the witnesses.” Washington, 57 M.J. at 399. “By\n‘reasonable doubt’ is not intended a fanciful or ingenious doubt or conjecture,\nbut an honest, conscientious doubt suggested by the material evidence or lack\nof it in this case. . . . The proof must be such as to exclude not every\nhypothesis or possibility of innocence, but every fair and rational hypothesis\nexcept that of guilt.” United States v. Loving, 41 M.J. 213, 281 (C.A.A.F.\n1994).\n    The remarkably detailed and consistent testimony of the five squad\nmembers provided overwhelming evidence of the appellant’s guilt, covering\nall elements of the offenses of which he was convicted. Although we were\nunable to personally observe the squad members testify at the first and\nsecond courts-martial, the minute details that brought their depictions to life,\nincluding specifics with no real bearing on the offenses, conveyed their\ncredibility. Details varied depending on the role each member played—\nproviding security, participating in the initial planning discussion, stepping\noff with the snatch team, or remaining behind. But the squad members\ncorroborated each other, and their narratives wove together to form a\ncomplete and clear account of the night’s events.\n    The appellant challenges his squad mates’ testimony as a fabrication\nforced upon them during coercive interrogations. TDC accused Hospitalman\nSecond Class (HM2) S., the platoon’s other Navy corpsman and a member of\nthe Quick Reaction Force that responded to the scene minutes after the\nshooting, of framing his close friend and mentor, HM3 Bacos, the appellant\nand the other members of the squad for murder. According to the appellant,\nHM2 S. is the source of the elaborate conspiracy to kill S.G. or someone close\nto him. Although HM2 S. admitted to later fabricating a threatening note in\norder to escape the squad he had implicated and their platoon, no convincing\nmotive for such a large-scale fiction as this conspiracy ever came to light.\nInstead, HM3 Bacos’s testimony foreshadowed the crisis of conscience that\nprompted him to confide in HM2 S., who later reported those confidences to\nNCIS.\n    According to the appellant, multiple NCIS agents then forced HM3 Bacos\nto adopt HM2 S.’s statement and forced the other members of the squad to\nadopt HM3 Bacos’s statement. Again, the appellant offers no plausible motive\nfor an entire team of investigators to strong-arm him and five other members\nof his squad into parroting the statement of a non-participant. Nor does he\ncredibly explain how a relatively brief interview between NCIS agents and\nHM2 S. evolved into the robust testimony before us. The conspicuously\nuniform affidavits from HM3 Bacos, LCpl Pennington, LCpl Shumate, and\nPFC Jodka alleging coercive interrogations and resulting perjury are\ninsufficient to raise reasonable doubt, even in light of our superior court’s\n\n\n                                      105\n\f                  United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nsuppression of the appellant’s confession. The overwhelming weight of the\ntestimony of the appellant’s co-conspirators also renders the autopsy,\nphysical evidence collected, and the testimony of lead SA J.C., who did little\nmore than authenticate the evidence, inconsequential.\n    Not only do we find the evidence legally sufficient, but we also find it\nfactually sufficient.\n                              III. CONCLUSION\n   The findings and sentence are affirmed.\n   Chief Judge GLASER-ALLEN and Senior Judge HUTCHISON concur.\n                                      For the Court\n\n\n\n\n                                      R.H.

The\nconvening authority (CA) approved the sentence as adjudged and, except for\nthe punitive discharge, ordered the sentence executed.\n    The appellant raises 13 assignments of error (AOE): (1) the military\njudge’s denial of the defense motion to suppress evidence of conduct for which\nthe appellant was acquitted at his first trial; (2) admission of former\ntestimony where the declarants were not unavailable and there was no\nsimilar motive for cross-examination; (3) unlawful command influence (UCI)\nfrom the Secretary of the Navy; (4) the military judge’s finding that apparent\nUCI stemming from the prosecution’s search of defense counsel’s office in\nanother case was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt; (5) denial of the\ndefense motion for recusal; (6) denial of the defense request to abate\nproceedings until the appellant’s attorney-client relationship was restored;\n(7) denial of the defense motion to dismiss based on the government’s\nviolation of the appellant’s Article 13, UCMJ, rights; (8) denial of the defense\nrequest for a site visit; (9) admission of an exhibit founded on hearsay; (10)\ndenial of the defense request for a mistrial after the members heard a\ngovernment witness testify that the appellant asserted his right to remain\nsilent; (11) the impact of the significant accumulation of errors on the\noutcome of the case; (12) the appellant’s excessive and disproportionate\nsentence to roughly six years’ confinement in light of companion cases; and\n(13) the legal and factual insufficiency of the findings.\n\n\n\n\n           m.

Arts. 59(a) and 66(c), UCMJ.\n                                I. BACKGROUND\n    First, a procedural orientation may be helpful. The appellant was\noriginally convicted in August 2007 for his role in the shooting death of an\nunknown Iraqi man in Hamdaniyah, Iraq, the morning of 26 April 2006. This\ncourt set aside the findings and sentence for an improper severance of\nattorney-client relationship in April 2010. United States v. Hutchins, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">623</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 631 (N-M. Ct. Crim. App. 2010) (Hutchins I). The Court of Appeals for\nthe Armed Forces (CAAF) reversed that decision and remanded the case to\nthis court to complete its review under Article 66, UCMJ, in January 2011.\nUnited States v. Hutchins, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">282</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 293 (C.A.A.F. 2011) (Hutchins II).\nThis court completed that review and affirmed the findings and sentence of\nthe first court-martial in March 2012. United States v. Hutchins, No.\n200800393, 2012 CCA LEXIS 93, *32, unpublished op. (N-M. Ct. Crim. App.\n20 Mar 2012) (Hutchins III). Finding a violation of the appellant’s Fifth\nAmendment rights against self-incrimination, the CAAF reversed our 2012\ndecision, set aside the findings and sentence of the 2007 court-martial, and\nremanded the case with authorization for a rehearing. United States v.\nHutchins, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 301 (C.A.A.F. 2013) (Hutchins IV). The results of that\nrehearing are before us here.\n   As for the events of the night and early morning of 25-26 April 2006, we\nrevisit our summary from Hutchins III, which the CAAF republished in\nHutchins IV:\n           The appellant was assigned as squad leader for 1st Squad,\n       2nd Platoon, Kilo Company, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines,\n       assigned to Task Force Chromite, conducting counter-\n       insurgency operations in the Hamdaniyah area of Iraq in April\n       2006. In the evening hours of 25 April 2006, the appellant led a\n       combat patrol to conduct a deliberate ambush aimed at\n       interdicting insurgent emplacement of improvised explosive\n       devices (IEDs). The court-martial received testimony from\n       several members of the squad that indicated the intended\n       ambush mission morphed into a conspiracy to deliberately\n       capture and kill a high value individual (HVI), believed to be a\n       leader of the insurgency. The witnesses gave varying testimony\n       as to the depth of their understanding of alternative targets,\n       such as family members of the HVI or another random\n       military-aged Iraqi male.\n\n\n\n                                        3\n\f                 United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n         Considerable effort and preparation went into the execution\n      of this conspiracy. Tasks were accomplished by various\n      Marines and their corpsman, including the theft of a shovel\n      and AK-47 from an Iraqi dwelling to be used as props to\n      manufacture a scene where it appeared that an armed\n      insurgent was digging to emplace an IED. Some squad\n      members advanced to the ambush site while others captured\n      an unknown Iraqi man, bound and gagged him, and brought\n      him to the would-be IED emplacement.\n          The stage set, the squad informed higher headquarters by\n      radio that they had come upon an insurgent planting an IED\n      and received approval to engage. The squad opened fire,\n      mortally wounding the man. The appellant approached the\n      victim and fired multiple rifle rounds into the man's face at\n      point blank range.\n          The scene was then manipulated to appear consistent with\n      the insurgent/IED story. The squad removed the bindings from\n      the victim's hands and feet and positioned the victim’s body\n      with the shovel and AK-47 rifle they had stolen from local\n      Iraqis. To simulate that the victim fired on the squad, the\n      Marines fired the AK-47 rifle into the air and collected the\n      discharged casings. When questioned about the action, the\n      appellant, like other members of the squad, made false official\n      statements, describing the situation as a legitimate ambush\n      and a “good shoot.” The death was brought to the appellant’s\n      battalion commander’s attention by a local sheikh and the\n      ensuing investigation led to the case before us.\nHutchins IV, 72 M.J. at 296 (quoting Hutchins III, 2012 CCA LEXIS 93 at *4-\n6).\n   For ease of understanding the hierarchy within the appellant’s squad, his\nsquad members and co-conspirators will be identified by the ranks they held\non 26 April 2006. They were Corporal (Cpl) Magincalda, Cpl Thomas, Lance\nCorporal (LCpl) Jackson, LCpl Pennington, LCpl Shumate, Private First\nClass (PFC) Jodka, and Navy corpsman, Hospitalman Third Class (HM3)\nBacos. Other witnesses will also be identified by ranks they held in 2006.\n   We will incorporate additional facts as we address the AOEs.\n\n\n\n\n                                     4\n\f                     United States v.

Admissibility of evidence and issue preclusion\n    In his first AOE, the appellant avers that the military judge erred in\nadmitting evidence of conduct of which the appellant had been acquitted at\nhis first trial. Specifically, the evidence of acquitted misconduct included\n“evidence of ‘housebreaking,’ ‘kidnapping,’ the alternate plan to seize a\nrandom Iraqi, and the alleged seizure of a random Iraqi by the snatch team.”4\n   We review a military judge’s ruling on a motion to suppress evidence for\nan abuse of discretion. United States v. Harrell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 362 (C.A.A.F.\n2016). The military judge’s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error;\nconclusions of law are reviewed de novo. Id. “If the military judge fails to\nplace his findings and analysis on the record, less deference will be accorded.”\nUnited States v. Flesher, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 312 (C.A.A.F. 2014).\n   Intertwined with the appellant’s AOE regarding the admission of\nevidence are two related issues—collateral estoppel (also known as issue\npreclusion) and the appellant’s purported acquittal of conspiring to kill\nanyone other than high value individual and suspected insurgency leader,\nS.G.5 We must address these two issues and their relationships to\nadmissibility of evidence before reviewing the military judge’s ruling. It is\nhelpful to keep in mind that the case before us is a rehearing.\n   1. Collateral estoppel / issue preclusion\n    When, as here, the government retries a criminal case, findings of not\nguilty from the first trial establish precedents limiting all future prosecutions\nof the same matter. Once acquitted of an offense, an accused need never “‘run\nthe gantlet’” again with regard to that specific offense. Ashe v. Swenson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108114\"><a href=\"/opinion/108114/ashe-v-swenson/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 446 (1970) (quoting Green v.

The Double Jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the\nConstitution protects the accused from being “subject, for the same offence, to\nbe twice put in jeopardy of life or limb[.]” U.S. CONST., amend. V. Courts have\nlong recognized the civil litigation concept of collateral estoppel. See Hoag v.\nNew Jersey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105687\"><a href=\"/opinion/105687/hoag-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">464</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 470 (1958) (“‘[W]here a question of fact essential to\nthe judgment is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final\njudgment, the determination is conclusive between the parties in a\nsubsequent action on a different cause of action.’”) (quoting RESTATEMENT,\nJUDGMENTS, § 68(1) (1942)). In Ashe, the Supreme Court held that criminal\n\n   4   Appellant’s Brief of 28 Jun 2016 at 30-31 (citation omitted).\n   5  S.G. was a suspected Iraqi insurgency leader and an HVI in the Hamdaniyah\narea, believed to be responsible for a number of IED attacks on American forces. He\nwas also the intended target of the conspiracy and killing at issue in this case.\n\n\n                                            5\n\f                   United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\ncollateral estoppel was embodied in the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee\nagainst double jeopardy. 397 U.S. at 445. After the incorporation of criminal\ncollateral estoppel into double jeopardy protection in Ashe, courts began to\nrefer to it as issue preclusion. See Schiro v.

Ashe, 397 U.S. at 446. An issue of fact is ultimate\nwhen it is critical to the verdict. “Issue preclusion bars successive litigation of\n‘an issue of fact or law’ that ‘is actually litigated and determined by a valid\nand final judgment, and . . . is essential to the judgment.’” Bobby v.

Id. at 437. Ashe had\nbeen arrested in connection with the robbery and charged with robbing one of\nthe players. Id. at 437-38. There was no question that the poker player had\nbeen robbed; the only issue in dispute was whether Ashe was one of the\nrobbers. Id. at 438-39. Despite a jury’s acquittal at this first trial, Ashe was\nlater charged and convicted of robbing a different player at the same game.\nId. at 439-440. On a petition for habeas corpus, the Ashe Court honed in on\nthe “issue in dispute,” finding:\n       [T]he record is utterly devoid of any indication that the first\n       jury could rationally have found that an armed robbery had not\n       occurred, or that [the victim in the first trial] had not been a\n       victim of that robbery. The single rationally conceivable issue\n       in dispute before the jury was whether the petitioner had been\n       one of the robbers. And the jury by its verdict found that he\n       had not. The federal rule of law, therefore, would make a\n       second prosecution for the robbery of [the victim in the second\n       trial] wholly impermissible.\nId. at 445 (emphasis added). The issue in dispute, Ashe’s presence at the\nrobbery, was an issue of ultimate fact as it was essential to charges of robbery\nat his first and second trials. With reasonable doubt as to this essential\nultimate fact, the government could not proceed with it at a second trial that\nalso depended on it. Id. at 446. See also Dowling v.

Dowling, 493 U.S. at 350. Once the accused\nproffers an issue of ultimate fact, the court must then test the accused’s\nproffer. Ashe, 397 U.S. at 444. The Ashe Court charged trial courts testing for\nissue preclusion with delving back into prior findings:\n       [T]he rule of collateral estoppel in criminal cases is not to be\n       applied with the hypertechnical and archaic approach of a 19th\n       century pleading book, but with realism and rationality. Where\n       a previous judgment of acquittal was based upon a general\n       verdict, as is usually the case, this approach requires a court to\n       “examine the record of [the] prior proceeding, taking into\n       account the pleadings, evidence, charge, and other relevant\n       matter, and conclude whether a rational jury could have\n       grounded its verdict on an issue other than that which the\n       defendant seeks to foreclose from consideration.”\nId.

Extension of issue preclusion to evidence suppression\n    When an issue of fact is not essential to both verdicts and thus not\nultimate in both cases, preclusion is not automatic. The government need not\nprove the acquitted issue beyond a reasonable doubt to secure a new\nconviction, so it can proceed with the new prosecution.

In rejecting Hicks’\nargument to apply collateral estoppel and suppress some of the evidence in\nhis case, the Court of Military Appeals distinguished his case from Ashe. “In\nAshe v. Swenson, . . . the fact underlying the issue of identity—that is,\nwhether the accused was present at the robbery—was an ultimate fact and\nessential for conviction in both proceedings. On the other hand, the other-acts\nevidence here was totally separate from the instant offenses in time and\nplace; was used for a limited evidentiary point; did not require proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt; and, although probative, was unnecessary to support a\nconviction of the instant charges.” Id. at 8-9.\n   3. Admissibility of evidence from an acquittal at court-martial\n    Instead of issue preclusion, three Military Rules of Evidence govern the\nrelevance and admissibility of evidence of conduct already litigated in a prior\ncourt-martial. Miller, 46 M.J. at 66; Hicks, 24 M.J. at 8. First, “[e]vidence is\nrelevant if: (a) it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than\nit would be without the evidence; and (b) the fact is of consequence in\ndetermining the action.” MIL. R. EVID. 401. “The military judge may exclude\nrelevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a\ndanger of one or more of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues,\nmisleading the members, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting\ncumulative evidence.” MIL. R. EVID. 403. “Evidence of a crime, wrong, or\nother act is not admissible to prove a person’s character in order to show that\non a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.”\nMIL. R. EVID. 404(b)(1). But “[t]his evidence may be admissible for another\npurpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan,\nknowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident” MIL. R. EVID.\n404(b)(2).\n   In United States v. Reynolds, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (C.M.A. 1989), the Court of\nMilitary Appeals articulated a three-part test for the admissibility of\nuncharged misconduct, including prior misconduct of which the accused was\nacquitted:\n           1. Does the evidence reasonably support a finding by the\n       court members that appellant committed prior crimes, wrongs,\n       or acts?\n          2. What “fact . . . of consequence” is made “more” or “less\n       probable” by the existence of this evidence?\n\n                                       9\n\f                    United States v.

Is the “probative value . . . substantially outweighed by\n         the danger of unfair prejudice”?\nId. at 109 (internal citations omitted, alterations in original).\n    Although the Military Rules of Evidence and the Reynolds test, not issue\npreclusion, govern the admissibility of uncharged misconduct, the fact of an\nacquittal is still a factor in the analysis. When an accused has been acquitted\nof conduct the government seeks to present as evidence in a subsequent case,\nthat acquittal is a factor in the test for admissibility. “The fact of the prior\nacquittal may diminish the probative value of the evidence, however, and\nshould be considered by the military judge when determining whether\n‘probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair\nprejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the members, or by\nconsiderations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of\ncumulative evidence.’” Hicks, 24 M.J. at 9 (quoting MIL. R. EVID. 403). An\naccused also has the right to prove that he or she was previously acquitted of\nthe acts admitted into evidence under MIL. R. EVID. 404(b). United States v.\nCuellar, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 56 (C.M.A. 1988). While issue preclusion is not a sword\nat the appellant’s disposal in this case, does he nonetheless deserve the\nbenefit of his purported acquittal of an issue of ultimate fact at his first court-\nmartial? Our superior court has not prohibited us from querying whether we\ncan extrapolate an acquittal from prior findings. To begin to answer whether\nthat purported acquittal affects the admissibility of related evidence, we must\nconsider the proffered acquittal.\n   4. Proffered acquittal of conspiring to kill anyone other than S.G.\n    As part of his motion in limine to suppress evidence of uncharged\nmisconduct, the appellant asserted that the findings of his first court-martial\nindicated an acquittal of an issue of ultimate fact. Based on specific\ninstructions to the members and their not guilty findings to housebreaking,\nkidnapping, and conspiring to commit them, the appellant asserted that the\nmembers must have concluded that (1) the appellant did not order his\nMarines to seize anyone other than suspected insurgency leader and HVI,\nS.G.; (2) the appellant believed that the individual seized was S.G.; and (3)\nthe appellant was not responsible for his squad members going to a house\nand seizing an unknown Iraqi man (who was not S.G.).8 TDC exhorted the\nmilitary judge to examine the findings and exceptions made by the members\nat his first trial to confirm that they resolved this issue in the appellant’s\nfavor. Citing collateral estoppel, the appellant sought to exclude evidence\nthat the appellant conspired to kill anyone other than S.G.\n\n\n   8   AE XCVIII at 6-7.\n\n\n                                        10\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n   a. Not an issue of ultimate fact in the case before us\n    Whom the appellant conspired to kill was central to the government’s\ntheme and theory at both trials but was not an issue of ultimate fact at his\nsecond court-martial. The conspiracy specification did not name the victim\nthe appellant and his co-conspirators agreed to murder. Whether the man\nshot by the IED crater was the same man the appellant intended to kill was\nnot critical to a finding of guilty for murder. As the military judge instructed\nthe members, in cases of mistake or carelessness, “the intent to kill or inflict\nbodily harm is transferred in the intended victim of [the accused’s] action to\nthe actual victim.”9 And for the same reasons, the identity of the appellant’s\nintended victim was not essential to the other charges referred to his second\ncourt-martial. With no pending charges dependent upon whom the appellant\nagreed to kidnap and kill, there is no issue of ultimate fact.\n    Without the required issue of ultimate fact at the pending court-martial,10\nwe can find no abuse of discretion in the military judge’s apparent decision\nnot to explore the findings and record of the first court-martial for the\npurported acquittal. The military judge made no written findings of fact or\nconclusions of law in response to the appellant’s request that he examine the\nfirst record of trial but said “[t]here is no requirement to speculate on the\nrationale on the last panel of members. In fact it’s folly to try to do that.”11\n    Though there appears to be no requirement to mine a prior record of trial\nfor acquittal of an issue of less than ultimate fact, our superior court has not\nprohibited it. The analysis and conclusion of acquittal exemplified in Ashe is\na preliminary step that may, but need not, result in issue preclusion. Even\nwith issue preclusion off the table, the existence of an acquittal remains\nrelevant to admission of evidence under the Military Rules of Evidence and\nReynolds. For that reason, we believe the appellant’s proffered acquittal\ndeserves our consideration.\n   b. Findings of the appellant’s first court-martial\n    The first panel of members returned mixed, and to some extent\ninconsistent,12 findings. Those findings are summarized below:\n    Charge I: Conspiracy - Guilty of one specification of conspiracy to commit\nlarceny, false official statements, murder, and obstruction of justice; but not\n\n\n   9   Record at 2276.\n   10   See Ashe, 397 U.S. at 443; Dowling, 493 U.S. at 348, discussed supra.\n   11   Record at 778.\n   12 As previously stated, the appellant’s acquittal of premeditated murder and\nconviction of conspiracy to commit murder are irreconcilably inconsistent.\n\n\n                                           11\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nguilty of conspiracy to commit housebreaking and kidnapping and excepting\nfour of 21 overt acts effecting the conspiracy.13\n    Charge II: False Official Statement - Guilty of one specification of false\nofficial statement for a written statement made on 28 April 2006; but not\nguilty of a second false official statement for the 8 May 2006 interview with\nthe NCIS Special Agents.\n   Charge III: Premeditated Murder - Not guilty of premeditated murder,\nbut guilty of the lesser included offense of unpremeditated murder of an\nunknown Iraqi man;\n   Charge IV: Larceny - Guilty of one specification of larceny;\n   Charges V, VI, and VII - Not guilty of assault consummated by battery,\nhousebreaking, kidnapping, and obstruction of justice.14\n   The appellant contends, “[t]he removal of housebreaking and kidnapping\nas predicate offenses to the conspiracy charge indicate that the members\nfound, as ultimate facts, that the conspiracy was only to kill [S.G.], and did\nnot include any plans for alternate victims.”15\n   c. Examination of the record of the prior proceeding\n   Our review of the record of the appellant’s first court-martial aligns\nsubstantially with the appellant’s account and conclusions regarding the\nmeaning of the appellant’s prior acquittal of housebreaking and kidnapping.\n     From their opening statements, trial counsel (TC) and TDC at the first\ncourt-martial presented conflicting theories of whom the appellant and his\nsquad members conspired to kill on 25 and 26 April 2006. The government\npreviewed their three-pronged conspiracy theory—“plan ‘A’, get [S.G.], plan\n‘B’, get a brother, or plan ‘C’, get somebody[.]”16 According to the government,\nthe evidence would show that the appellant, Cpls Magincalda and Thomas,\n\n\n   13  The four excepted overt acts were: (1) Cpl Magincalda, Cpl Thomas, LCpl\nPennington, and HM3 Bacos walking from S.G.’s house to the home of an unknown\nIraqi and Cpl Magincalda and Cpl Thomas entering the house; (2) Cpl Magincalda\nand Cpl Thomas taking an unknown Iraqi man from his house against his will; (3)\nthe appellant’s false statements to Staff Sergeant O.B. on 26 April 2006 regarding\nthe facts and circumstances of the unknown Iraqi man’s death; and (4) the\nappellant’s false statements to Special Agents J.C. and S.L., Naval Criminal\nInvestigative Service, on 8 May 2006 regarding the facts and circumstances of the\nunknown Iraqi man’s death.\n   14   First trial record, charge sheet and findings worksheet (AE CXXIV).\n   15   Appellant’s Brief at 27.\n   16   First trial record at 1015.\n\n\n                                          12\n\f                       United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nand LCpl Pennington spent an hour and a half deliberating and developing a\nplan for four squad members to walk to the home of S.G., seize him, bring\nhim about a kilometer to a crater formed by an IED, disturb the dirt with a\nstolen shovel so it appeared S.G. was trying to plant a new IED, stage a\nfirefight with a stolen AK-47, and kill S.G. That was Plan A.\n            Plan “B” is, Hey, if we can’t get [S.G.], let’s get one of his\n         brothers, grab somebody from his house because we want to\n         send a message. And as they talk about plan “B”, then they\n         say, What if we can’t get into the house?\n            Sergeant Hutchins tells them, Get someone else. Bring\n         somebody back here tonight. We need to send a message. So\n         they move from plan “B” to plan “C” to get somebody. Get\n         somebody.17\nIn response to the government’s opening statement, the appellant’s TDC\nfocused the members on command pressure to eliminate S.G., a “high value\ntarget,”18 and challenged the existence of a three-prong conspiracy. TDC\nasserted that the appellant believed the man he shot at the IED crater was\nS.G.\n    Five members of the appellant’s squad testified at his first court-martial.\nThe refrain of a single plan repeated throughout their testimony—“To get\n[S.G.], bring him down to the IED hole, and shoot and kill him, sir.”19\nAccording to LCpl Pennington and HM3 Bacos, the only two of the original\nplanners to testify, they originally discussed storming S.G.’s house and\nkilling him there, in what would look like a mujahedeen attack. Then they\nconsidered commandeering a car and using that to drive S.G. from his home\nto the IED crater. But they discarded these ideas in favor of a four-man\n“snatch team” seizing S.G. from his home and bringing him, on foot, to the\nIED crater.\n    Testimony about a substitute for S.G. was not consistent. When TC asked\nLCpl Jackson what would happen if the snatch team could not seize S.G., he\nresponded, “[t]hey would get a relative of his or any other male in the house,\nsir.”20 TC did not pose the question to PFC Jodka, but in response to a\nquestion from a member, PFC Jodka specifically refuted any suggestion that\nthe appellant planned to seize one of S.G.’s family members.

According to LCpl\nPennington, “[i]f we were compromised at the [S.G.] house and couldn’t go\ninside without everyone knowing we were there, we would move on to\nanother house where we would get another military age male.”23 LCpl\nPennington conceded to TDC that “it would have been a significant departure\n. . . to grab somebody else” and “[i]t would have defeated the whole purpose\nnot to grab [S.G.].”24 HM3 Bacos also testified to Plans B and C:\n         [W]e were tasked out to go retrieve an AK-47 and shovel from a\n         nearby house, stash it somewhere, go patrol to [S.G.]’s house.\n             If not—if we couldn’t get [S.G.] because someone saw us in\n         the family, we would go try getting someone else, anyone, and\n         then walk that military-aged male—it was going to be a male—\n         down to the IED hole with the AK-47 and shovel, disturb the\n         dirt, make it look like he was digging and make it look like he\n         is doing a terrorist act.25\nHM3 Bacos remembered hearing the appellant say, “someone was going to\ndie tonight[.]”26\n    The appellant did not testify on the merits at his first court-martial, but\nthe statement he gave to Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) on 19\nMay 2006 went to the members as Prosecution Exhibit (PE) 1.27 In his\nstatement, the appellant acknowledged a back-up plan to seize and kill one of\nS.G.’s brothers if S.G. were not home. Amidst all the discussion, he\nremembered Cpl Thomas singing lyrics from a rap song “Somebody’s gonna\ndie tonight.” According to the plan, the snatch team would bind S.G.’s hands\nwith flexible handcuffs, gag him, and walk him to the IED crater.

Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nThomas and Cpl Magincalda called the appellant on his personal radio\nreceiver and told him they had “him,” the appellant thought they were\nreferring to S.G.28 Not until after the shooting, when he approached the body,\ndid the appellant realize they had killed another Iraqi man, not S.G. HM3\nBacos’s testimony corroborated a radio exchange between the snatch team\nand the appellant as the snatch team approached the IED crater. “I\nremember Corporal Thomas saying that Sergeant Hutchins wanted to see the\nman, to bring the man to the tree. But Corporal Magincalda disagreed and\nsaid, ‘No, we’re not going to do that, let’s just stick with the plan.’”29 On cross-\nexamination, TDC confirmed with HM3 Bacos that the appellant wanted to\nsee the man with them, but Cpl Magincalda objected.30\n    In his closing argument, TC acknowledged the discrepancies in the\ntestimony about plans A, B, and C but argued that the appellant planned to\nkidnap and kill not S.G., but somebody. “They couldn’t get [S.G.] or one of his\nbrothers, so they got somebody. They got somebody, because somebody was\ngoing to die tonight.”31 TDC closed by inviting the members’ attention to what\nHM3 Bacos overheard on the radio between the appellant and the two\ncorporals to dispute the government’s assertion that he planned to kidnap\nand kill anyone other than S.G. Throughout the trial, the government and\nTDC advocated conflicting positions about whom the appellant conspired to\nkill by the IED crater on 26 April 2006.\n    As the appellant was not a member of the snatch team, the government\nrelied on both principal and co-conspirator liability32 to prosecute him for\nmany of the offenses charged—larceny, housebreaking, kidnapping, and\nassault consummated by battery actually carried out by the snatch team\nmembers. TC ended his closing argument with a preview of the legal concept\nfor members. The military judge instructed the members on principal liability\nof those who aid, abet, command, counsel, or procure an offense, and co-\nconspirator liability, when the offense is committed in furtherance of the\nconspiracy.\n   Prompted by evidence presented during the court-martial, the military\njudge also instructed the members about a possible mistake of fact defense\nwith regard to the appellant’s authority to detain S.G., a high value target.\n\n\n   28   First trial record, PE 1 at 7.\n   29   Id. at 1422.\n   30   Id. at 1449.\n   31   Id. at 1726.\n   32 See MANUAL FOR COURTS-MARTIAL, UNITED STATES (2005 ed.), Part IV, ¶¶\n77b(2)(b) and 81c(5).\n\n\n                                         15\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n“If the accused at the time of the offense was under the mistaken belief that\nhe was authorized to detain [S.G.] at any time, then he cannot be found guilty\nof the offense of housebreaking.”33 “Now, the accused is not guilty of the\noffense of kidnapping if: First, he mistakenly believed he had the authority to\ndetain [S.G.] at any time, and; Second, if such belief on his part was\nreasonable.”34\n    In light of these instructions, the evidence, and counsel’s arguments, the\nfindings of not guilty of housebreaking, kidnapping, and conspiracy to commit\nthem along with the exception of the overt acts of walking to an unknown\nIraqi man’s house, entering the house, and taking the man from his home\nagainst his will, support the appellant’s proffered acquittal. We are not\npersuaded by the government’s argument that the appellant could have\nreasonably expected an Iraqi to open his home to a knock in the middle of the\nnight and voluntarily accompany American troops. But for the squad’s legal\nauthority to arrest and detain high value targets such as S.G., the plan\nrequired housebreaking and kidnapping.35 The mistake of fact defense\nregarding the authority to detain applied only to S.G.; no one else was\nidentified as a high value target. To borrow language from Ashe, “the record\nis utterly devoid of any indication that the first jury could rationally have\nfound that” housebreaking and kidnapping of an unknown Iraqi man “had\nnot occurred, or that” the unknown Iraqi man “had not been a victim of”\nhousebreaking and kidnapping. 397 U.S. at 445.\n    With regard to the appellant’s liability for committing housebreaking and\nkidnapping, “[t]he single rationally conceivable issue in dispute before the\njury was whether” the appellant had conspired to enter the home of S.G. and\nseize him or to break into the home of someone else to kidnap someone other\nthan S.G.

Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\ntheories of liability by convicting the appellant of stealing an AK-47 and\nshovel he never touched. Their decision to acquit the appellant of\nhousebreaking and kidnapping demonstrates that the members believed the\nmistake of fact defense applied, and the conspiracy was to get and kill S.G.\n   Again, we find no abuse of discretion in the military judge’s failure to\nconclude that the appellant was acquitted of conspiring to kill anyone but\nS.G., but we will include this among the acquitted acts of misconduct as we\nproceed with analysis of the ruling on admission of evidence.\n    5. Military judge’s ruling on motion to suppress evidence\n    In advance of his second trial, the appellant moved “to exclude evidence\nand testimony regarding conduct that was the subject of the members’ ‘not\nguilty’ findings” at his first trial.36 Specifically, the appellant sought to\nexclude evidence of premeditated murder, housebreaking, kidnapping, and a\nfalse official statement to NCIS agents regarding the placement of a shovel or\nAK-47 near the deceased.37 The evidence to be suppressed was presented\ncategorically and not delineated as physical exhibits, statements, or excerpts\nof statements. At the time of the motion, both parties anticipated that the\nappellant’s former squad mates might testify to much of this evidence.\nUltimately and unexpectedly, the government relied on transcripts of the\nprior court-martial testimony of four of the squad members, and the\nappellant objected to numerous excerpts of that prior testimony relating to\nacquitted offenses.\n   In a ruling from the bench, the military judge denied the appellant’s\nmotion to suppress evidence.\n               The motion to suppress is denied. There is no requirement\n          to speculate on the rationale of the last panel of members. In\n          fact, it’s folly to try to do that. The real risk of confusing them\n          is if we try to parse the facts as proposed by the defense\n          counsel. Misconduct can violate more than one article of the\n          UCMJ and the conduct alleged in Paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of\n          the defense motion are not mutually exclusive to the charges of\n          which the accused was acquitted.38\n\n\n    36   AE XCVIII at 1.\n    37   Id. at 5-7.\n    38Record at 778. Paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) referred, respectively, to “Evidence of\n‘Premeditation,’” “Evidence of Kidnapping and Housebreaking,” and “Evidence of\nFalse Statements to NCIS About Underlying Facts.” AE XCVIII at 5-7. As previously\nstated, the appellant’s AOE focuses, almost exclusively, on the evidence in paragraph\n(b), housebreaking and kidnapping. We will confine our analysis to housebreaking\n\n\n                                           17\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n    This statement of the military judge issued contemporaneously with his\ndenial of the appellant’s motion to suppress constitutes the sum total of the\nrecord reflective of the military judge’s reasoning in support of his ruling. The\nrecord includes no explicit findings of fact or conclusions of law or any other\nexplanation or justification in support of the military judge’s ruling. In the\ncontext of the pleadings and argument during the surrounding Article 39(a),\nUCMJ, hearing, we can glean two findings of fact from the military judge’s\nruling and simultaneous comments.\n    First, the military judge apparently found that the evidence of which the\nappellant had been acquitted applied to other charges pending before the\ncourt. Early in the Article 39(a), UCMJ, session, the military judge posed to\ncivilian defense counsel that conduct “can cut across more than one article of\nthe UCMJ.”39 And “[w]hy can’t the underlying conduct, if it applies to other\ncharges, still come in?”40 Neither the TC nor the military judge specified the\npending charges to which the underlying misconduct applied. But in their\nresponse to the motion to suppress, the government “opine[d] that these acts\ndemonstrate the accused’s preparation, intent, lack of mistake or accident,\nand plan to execute the offense for which he is charged and escape culpability\nand suspicion for the charged offenses.”41\n    In his second finding of fact, the military judge concluded that\nsuppression of evidence of housebreaking, kidnapping, and the detour to the\nhome of the unknown Iraqi man would leave the members confused. TC, in\ntheir response to the defense motion, asserted that, “[c]ourts should decline\nany invitation [to] create an artificial gap in the witness’s narrative that will\nleave the fact-finder confused and uninformed.”42 The prospect of confused\nmembers resonated with the military judge, who then challenged the civilian\ndefense counsel on censoring from witnesses’ testimony how they transported\nthe Iraqi man from his home to the IED crater and “how he got in—allegedly\ngot into the IED hole.”43 TC then invoked the MIL. R. EVID. 403 balancing test\nand warned that “to simply omit those facts of the housebreaking and the\nkidnapping, to simply omit those facts, that is what would confuse the\n\n\n\n\nand kidnapping and the underlying facts necessarily resolved by acquittal of those\ntwo charges.\n   39   Record at 768.\n   40   Id.\n   41   AE XCIX at 10.\n   42   Id. at 8.\n   43   Record at 770.\n\n\n                                       18\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nmembers.”44 From the argument on the record, we can conclude that the\nmilitary judge found that excising uncharged misconduct of which the\nappellant had been acquitted from testimony would confuse the members,\nand admitting it was necessary to prevent that confusion.\n    We presume the military judge knows the law and correctly applies it,\nunless the record in this case suggests otherwise. See United States v.\nErickson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 225 (C.A.A.F. 2007) (holding that “[m]ilitary judges\nare presumed to know the law and to follow it absent clear evidence to the\ncontrary”). However, if the military judge analyzed the evidence of prior\nmisconduct in accordance with MIL. R. EVID. 401, 403, or 404(b) or the three-\npart Reynolds test,45 he did not so articulate on the record. Aside from the\nnecessity for a coherent narrative, TC did not volunteer and the military\njudge did not solicit the probative value of the evidence. The military judge\ndid not acknowledge how the appellant’s prior acquittal impacted its\nprobative value, and he was silent as to any potential prejudice.\n   In his instructions to the members, the military judge provided the\nstandard MIL. R. EVID. 404(b) instruction regarding acquitted offenses and\nadded:\n         I remind you again that the accused was acquitted at a prior\n         proceeding of the offenses of kidnapping, housebreaking,\n         assault, obstruction of justice, premeditated murder, and false\n         official statement on or about 8 May, as well as conspiracy to\n         commit kidnapping and housebreaking. You may therefore\n         consider evidence that the accused may have been involved in\n         plans or acts involving entering the alleged victim’s home,\n         moving him to another location, involvement in a shooting, and\n         providing a statement to NCIS on or about 8 May for the\n         limited purpose of its tendency, if any, to prove a plan or design\n         of the accused to commit the charged acts.46\n   Given the absence of any substantive findings or analysis by the military\njudge, we will conduct our own Reynolds analysis.\n   6. Application of the Reynolds test\n    The appellant moved to suppress evidence of the offenses of which he had\nbeen acquitted: conspiracy to commit housebreaking and kidnapping, false\nofficial statement for the 8 May 2006 interview with NCIS, premeditated\n\n\n   44   Id. at 776.\n   45   29 M.J. at 109.\n   46   Record at 2285-86.\n\n\n                                        19\n\f                  United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nmurder, obstruction of justice, assault consummated by battery,\nhousebreaking, and kidnapping. In addition, we analyze the admissibility of\nevidence to conspire to kill anyone other than S.G.\n   a. Support of prior crimes, wrongs, or acts\n    Evidence in the form of direct testimony from multiple former squad\nmates reasonably supports findings that the appellant instigated, advised,\ncounseled, encouraged, and conspired to commit the offenses of which he was\nacquitted, including, as a contingency, conspiring to kill someone other than\nS.G. See Reynolds, 29 M.J. at 109. In particular, through their testimony at\nthe first court-martial, snatch team members LCpl Pennington and HM3\nBacos recounted the carefully considered and crafted plan to enter a home,\nseize S.G. or a substitute, transport him to the IED crater, kill him, and stage\nthe incident to look like a legitimate firefight. They both testified to the\ncontingency plan to seize one of S.G.’s relatives or any Iraqi man if they could\nnot get S.G. LCpl Pennington and HM3 Bacos then provided consistent, step-\nby-step accounts of the execution of that plan, including the actual\nhousebreaking, kidnapping, and assault consummated by battery. The other\njunior squad members corroborated the plan to obstruct justice with details of\nthe carefully staged scene. All of this testimony contradicted the appellant’s\ninitial accounts of discovering and engaging an insurgent digging a hole in\nwhich to bury an IED and suggests deceit and false official statement. This\nfirst factor inures to the admission of the evidence.\n   b. Probability of facts of consequence\n    Evidence that the appellant instigated, advised, encouraged, and\nconspired to commit the acquitted offenses and that they were committed in\nfurtherance of that conspiracy makes it more probable that the death of an\nunknown Iraqi man in Hamdaniyah on 26 April 2006 was the result of a\nconspiracy the appellant hatched and led. Id. The granularity of detail\nevident in the testimony about conspiring to enter the home of S.G. and seize\nhim—or someone else, to kill S.G., and to cover it up made it more probable\nthat the larceny and murder were also products of the same deliberate and\ncomprehensive planning process. Evidence of all the actions taken to carry\nout the plan made it more probable that the squad members and the\nappellant had committed to the plan’s goal of a killing in an IED crater.\nFinally, evidence that the appellant and the snatch team members\nconsidered a contingency such as S.G.’s absence from his home and the\nidentification of a substitute victim made it more probable that the fatal\nshooting was both intentional and wrongful.\n\n\n\n\n                                      20\n\f                  United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n   c. Does the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweigh the\nprobative value?\n    First, we consider the probative value of evidence of the acquitted\noffenses. Id. As the government argued, the primary probative value was\nnarrative cohesion. A cohesive narrative revealed a well-thought out plan\nindicating preparation, intent, and lack of mistake or accident.\n    As for unfair prejudice that might substantially outweigh probative value,\nthe appellant submits very little. Relying on suppression by issue preclusion,\nTDC did not address the Reynolds factors or Military Rules of Evidence in\ntheir motion. The parties discussed the MIL. R. EVID. 403 balancing test only\nwith regard to evidence of housebreaking and kidnapping and the confusion\nof extracting part of the narrative. To complete our analysis, we consider the\npotential prejudice of evidence of acquitted misconduct.\n   Prejudice from evidence of premeditated murder, obstruction of justice,\nand the 8 May 2006 false official statement was minimal. The appellant had\nbeen acquitted of committing those offenses but convicted of conspiring to\ncommit them. Evidence of the completed offenses was essentially\nindistinguishable from evidence of conspiracy to commit them and thus\npresented little, if any, danger of unfair prejudice.\n   As for evidence of housebreaking, kidnapping, and the conspiracy to\ncommit them, their absence would have likely been conspicuous to members.\nSome members may have independently understood the authority to seize\nand detain high value targets, but there might not have been an instruction\nexplaining the legal distinction. Faced with a logical gap in the narrative, the\nmembers may have assumed details similar to, or more aggravating than,\nwhat the evidence revealed. Suppressing the evidence may have done little to\nreduce prejudice.\n    More important, the evidence of housebreaking and kidnapping was\nembedded in the larger narrative. The consistent eyewitness testimony of one\nco-conspirator after another compounded the evidence of both conspiracy to\ncommit murder and murder itself. There was little danger of conviction based\non character evidence stemming from the housebreaking and kidnapping that\npreceded the murder. Inclusion of evidence explaining how the unknown\nIraqi civilian arrived at the IED crater was therefore not unduly prejudicial.\n   With regard to the appellant’s agreement to kill anyone other than S.G.,\nthe appellant fell short of articulating unfair prejudice that might have\noutweighed probative value. Evidence of Plans B and C, conspiracy to commit\nsomeone other than S.G., is undeniably probative of a conspiracy to commit\nmurder and the ultimate murder of an unknown Iraqi man. The appellant’s\n\n\n\n\n                                      21\n\f                       United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nacquittal of these two plans does diminish their probative value but likely not\nin an appreciable way.\n    Nevertheless, the potential prejudice loomed large. The counsel\nprosecuting the appellant’s second court-martial resurrected and recycled the\nconspiracy to kill a random Iraqi as the government’s “theory of\nprosecution.”47 Sounding remarkably like his predecessor seven years earlier,\nTC in the appellant’s second trial began his opening statement with:\n“Sergeant Hutchins had a perfect plan, a perfect plan to commit a murder\nand send a message. Sergeant Hutchins was the mastermind of the plan, and\nhis squad executed.”48 The prosecutor quickly referred to “a plan to drag\nsomeone out of their bed in the middle of the night and kill them.”49 Then he\nlaid out “Plan A, get [S.G.]. Plan B, get [S.G.’s] brothers . . . Plan C, you get\nany Iraqi male . . . you get any Iraqi male because this town is going to get\nthe message.”50 TC then repeated Plan A, Plan B, Plan C. As he wrapped up\nhis opening statement, the TC again referred to the appellant’s “perfect plan\nto send a message.”51 The three-prong conspiracy theory debunked at the first\ntrial reappeared as a central theory of the second trial, and the intent to kill\nsomeone and send a message was its theme. Although the charge sheet was\nsilent as to a victim of the conspiracy, the members might have been forgiven\nfor assuming the appellant was charged with conspiring to kill a random\nIraqi man.\n   Unlike in Hicks, where “the other-acts evidence was totally separate from\nthe instant offenses in time and place; was used for a limited evidentiary\npoint; did not require proof beyond a reasonable doubt; and, although\nprobative, was unnecessary to support a conviction of the instant charges[,]”\nhere, although the other-acts evidence did not require proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt and was unnecessary to conviction, it was part and parcel of\nthe instant offenses and prominently presented as the theme and theory of\nthe case. 24 M.J. at 9.\n    The government’s depiction of the appellant as someone who conspired to\nkill an innocent Iraqi civilian at random was at least arguably aggravating,\nbut it did not ultimately amount to unfair prejudice in this case. “[T]he term\n‘unfair prejudice’ in the context of [MIL. R. EVID.] 403 ‘speaks to the capacity\nof some concededly relevant evidence to lure the factfinder into declaring\n\n\n   47   Appellant’s Brief at 17, 24.\n   48   Record at 1255.\n   49   Id.\n   50   Id. at 1259.\n   51   Id. at 1265.\n\n\n                                         22\n\f                     United States v.

In light of the substantial and less\ncontroverted evidence that the appellant conspired to kill S.G., the members\nwould not have needed to rely on evidence of a conspiracy to kill anyone else\nto prove the charge itself. Although Plans B and C were a contingency on\nwhich the snatch team needed to rely, evidence of Plans B and C was a\ncontingency of proof the government did not need.\n   Finally, had the appellant exercised his right to prove his acquittal of\nconspiracy to murder anyone other than S.G.,52 the diversion necessary for\ndoing so might have tipped the scales of the MIL. R. EVID. 403 balancing test.\nMIL. R. EVID. 403 (providing for the exclusion of evidence “if its probative\nvalue is substantially outweighed by the danger of . . . confusion of the issues,\nor misleading the members, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of\ntime, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.”) But this prejudice is\npurely speculative. The appellant did not attempt to prove his acquittal to the\nmembers of the second court-martial, and thus this potential prejudice never\nbecame an issue.\n   Despite the potential for unfair prejudice in the admission of evidence of a\nconspiracy to kill anyone other than S.G., that prejudice was not before the\nmilitary judge at the time he admitted the evidence. The actual prejudice did\nnot substantially outweigh the evidence’s probative value.\n    Having progressed through the three factors of the Reynolds test and\nfinding them all in favor of admission, we can find no abuse of discretion in\nthe military judge’s decision to admit the evidence of acquitted misconduct,\nincluding evidence of a conspiracy to kill anyone other than S.G. The evidence\noffered proof of motive, intent, preparation, plan, and an absence of mistake\nor accident with regard to the charges against the appellant, particularly\nconspiracy to commit murder and murder.

The\nvivid, granular details the co-conspirators recounted with calm, confident\ncertainty ring with credibility. Evidence of a conspiracy to kill anyone other\nthan S.G. was material to the government’s case but of inferior quality to the\nevidence of an agreement to kill S.G. Despite the prominence the government\ngave the evidence of Plans B and C and the murderous callousness the\ngovernment presumably sought to depict in the appellant, the evidence of\nPlan A was sufficient to assuage any concerns that members needed to fall\nback on evidence of Plans B and C.

Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\ndeterminations of witness unavailability—and the government’s good faith\nefforts to produce the witness—for an abuse of discretion. Id.\n    Among the reasons for witness unavailability enumerated in MIL. R.\nEVID. 804(a) are “(1) exempt[ion] from testifying about the subject matter of\nthe declarant’s statement because the military judge rules that a privilege\napplies;” and “(2) refus[al] to testify about the subject matter despite the\nmilitary judge’s order to do so[.]” A witness may refuse to testify by invoking\nhis privilege against compulsory self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth\nAmendment and, where applicable, Article 31, UCMJ. U.S. CONST. amend V.\nTo overcome a witness’s privilege against self-incrimination and compel his\ntestimony, the government must confer testimonial immunity, as described in\nMIL. R. EVID. 301(d)(1):\n        The minimum grant of immunity adequate to overcome the\n        privilege is that which under either R.C.M. 70453 or other\n        proper authority provides that neither the testimony of the\n        witness nor any evidence obtained from that testimony may be\n        used against the witness at any subsequent trial other than in\n        a prosecution for perjury, false swearing, the making of a false\n        official statement, or failure to comply with an order to testify\n        after the military judge has ruled that the privilege may not be\n        asserted by reason of immunity.\n(emphasis added).

The military judge found the alleged victim to be\nunavailable, and the Army Court of Criminal Appeals agreed that a grant of\ntransactional immunity was not required before finding a witness\nunavailable. Id. at *16.\n    In Swan, a witness testified at an Article 39(a), UCMJ, session that his\nstatement to NCIS implicating Swan was a fabrication. 45 M.J. at 679. The\ngovernment offered the witness testimonial immunity, but not transactional\nimmunity, and instead pursued perjury charges against him for his Article\n39(a), UCMJ, testimony. Id. The military judge questioned the witness about\nhis refusal to testify, determined that he had invoked his Article 31(b),\nUCMJ, rights, and declared him unavailable. Id. at 679-80. This court\naffirmed the military judge’s ruling of unavailability, finding that he “made\nsufficient inquiries to establish that [the witness] would exercise his privilege\nagainst compelled self-incrimination despite the purported grant of\nimmunity.” Id. at 680.\n    In the case before us, the government subpoenaed the appellant’s former\nsquad mates, all civilians by the time of trial, to testify for the prosecution.\nHM3 Bacos, PFC Jodka, LCpl Pennington, and LCpl Shumate took the stand\nin Article 39(a), UCMJ, sessions. Despite receiving grants of testimonial\nimmunity,55 they each invoked their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-\nincrimination, cited a fear of prosecution for perjury, and declined to comply\nwith the military judge’s order to testify. Based on this Article 39(a), UCMJ,\ntestimony, the military judge found HM3 Bacos, PFC Jodka, and LCpl\nPennington unavailable. LCpl Shumate’s Article 39(a), UCMJ, session\nfollowed the military judge’s verbal ruling that the three preceding witnesses\nwere unavailable, and he neglected to explicitly declare LCpl Shumate\nunavailable. This oversight elicited no objection from the appellant, and the\nmilitary judge simply dismissed LCpl Shumate after his Article 39, UCMJ,\ntestimony and proceeded with the admission of his prior testimony based on\nhis refusal to testify.\n    The military judge made no specific findings of fact, but he elicited from\neach of the four witnesses testimony that met the MIL. R. EVID. 804(b)(1)\ncriteria for unavailability—their intent to invoke their privilege against self-\n\n    55 AE CXXX, CXXXII-CXXXIV. HM3 Bacos, PFC Jodka, LCpl Pennington, and\n\nLCpl Shumate each received a “Grant of Testimonial Immunity and Order to Testify”\nfrom the CA under authority from the Justice Department. In return for testifying\ntruthfully, each had “immunity from the use of [his] testimony or other information\ngiven by [him] . . . except a prosecution for perjury, giving a false statement, or\notherwise failing to comply with an order to testify in these matters.”\n\n\n                                        26\n\f                  United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nincrimination to avoid testifying that they had committed perjury at the first\ncourt-martial and their refusal to testify despite being ordered to do so.\nAlthough the military judge did not elaborate on the good faith efforts of the\ngovernment to produce the witnesses, all witnesses were present and took the\nstand to confirm the circumstances that made them unavailable. The\ngovernment had procured the required grants of testimonial immunity.\nDespite the appellant’s argument that good faith required TC’s application\nfor transactional immunity, our military case law precedent is clear that only\ntestimonial immunity is necessary. The military judge’s rulings were in\naccordance with MIL. R. EVID. 804(b)(1) and Swan, which he cited as\nauthority, as well as Trank. We find no abuse of discretion with regard to the\nunavailability of HM3 Bacos, PFC Jodka, LCpl Pennington, and LCpl\nShumate.\n    Having found the four witnesses unavailable, the military judge invited\nthe government to seek admission of their testimony from the prior court-\nmartial. To determine if admission of that prior testimony were an abuse of\ndiscretion, we next look at the appellant’s opportunity to cross-examine the\nwitnesses.\n   2. Opportunity and similar motive for cross-examination\n    If a witness is unavailable, MIL. R. EVID. 804(b)(1) provides an exception\nto the rules against hearsay allowing admission of the unavailable witness’s\nformer testimony. The exception applies to testimony that “(A) was given by a\nwitness at a trial, hearing, or lawful deposition, whether given during the\ncurrent proceeding or a different one; and (B) is now offered against a party\nwho had an opportunity and similar motive to develop it by direct, cross-, or\nredirect examination.” MIL. R. EVID. 804(b)(1).\n   The appellant argues he did not have a similar motive to cross-examine\nthe four unavailable co-conspirators at his first trial.\n    Whether there was a similar motive to cross-examine a witness at a prior\nproceeding is a question of law we review de novo. Trank, 2013 CCA LEXIS\n985, at *15. The party seeking to admit prior testimony as evidence must\ndemonstrate similarity of motive. United States v. Salerno, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112772\"><a href=\"/opinion/112772/united-states-v-salerno/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 322\n(1992) (finding no exception to MIL. R. EVID. 804(b)(1)’s “similar motive”\nrequirement for admitting prior testimony). The appellant steers us to United\nStates v. DiNapoli, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"656568\"><a href=\"/opinion/656568/united-states-v-vincent-dinapoli-louis-dinapoli-nicholas-auletta-edward/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">909</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2nd Cir. 1993), for the meaning of similar\nmotive to develop testimony. In DiNapoli, the Second Circuit composed a test\nfor what constitutes a similar motive at two proceedings: “whether the party\nresisting the offered testimony at a pending proceeding had at a prior\nproceeding an interest of substantially similar intensity to prove (or disprove)\nthe same side of a substantially similar issue.” 8 F.3d at 914-15. The\n“relevant though not conclusive” factors for comparing relative intensity of\n\n                                      27\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\ninterest are “[t]he nature of the two proceedings—both what is at stake and\nthe applicable burden of proof—and, to a lesser extent, the cross-examination\nat the prior proceeding—both what was undertaken and what was available\nbut forgone . . . .” Id. at 915.\n    The context of this analysis in DiNapoli is revealing. The party resisting\nadmission of the offered testimony was the government. Id. at 911. The two\nproceedings were a grand jury and a trial. Id. A prosecutor declined to cross-\nexamine a witness at a grand jury “in order not to reveal the identity of then\nundisclosed cooperating witnesses or the existence of then undisclosed\nwiretapped conversations that refuted [the witness’s] denials . . . .” Id. It is\nlogical to conclude that the lower stakes and burden of proof at the grand jury\nprompted the prosecutor to forego that line of cross-examination. On the\nother hand, when the nature of the two proceedings is the same—for\nexample, testimony on findings at a court-martial—the prospect of conviction\nor acquittal is the same, and the government’s burden of proof is the same. A\nshift in cross-examination strategy does little to change the intensity of the\naccused’s interest in avoiding conviction. In fact, the DiNapoli court noted\nthat “[w]here both proceedings are trials and the same matter is seriously\ndisputed at both trials, it will normally be the case that the side opposing the\nversion of a witness at the first trial had a motive to develop that witness’s\ntestimony similar to the motive at the second trial.” Id. at 912.\n    In this case, the military judge found “that the exception [MIL. R. EVID.]\n804(b)1 [sic] regarding former testimony would apply, making the former\ntestimony in this prior trial, not the other cases we’ve heard about, would\nbecome [sic] admissible if so desired by the government to introduce them.” 56\nThis ruling immediately followed the military judge’s declaration that three\nof the appellant’s squad members were unavailable as witnesses. TC did not\nfile a written motion in limine to admit the prior testimony, nor did they\nproffer the appellant’s similar motives to develop the testimony at the first\nand second courts-martial on the record. As the appellant points out, the\nmilitary judge made no findings of fact or conclusions of law regarding\nsimilarity of motive, from the bench or in writing.\n    But again, we presume the military judge knows and follows the law\nunless there is evidence to the contrary. See Erickson, 65 M.J. at 225 (holding\nthat “[m]ilitary judges are presumed to know the law and to follow it absent\nclear evidence to the contrary”). And here we find no evidence to the contrary,\nparticularly in light of our de novo review of the similarity of motives. The\ngovernment sought to introduce the prior testimony of witnesses to prove the\nsame charges against the same accused in the same forum—a contested\n\n\n   56   Record at 1528.\n\n\n                                       28\n\f                       United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\ngeneral court-martial. Even the DiNapoli court would agree that the motive\nto develop that testimony would normally be the same. 8 F.3d at 912. The\nappellant fails to rebut that expectation of similarity.\n    On the record, TDC argued that the defense team at the first trial was\nineffective. TDC further contended that “different charges pending, different\ntheories of the government and defense, and different motivations and\nstrategic decisions made by both counsel” negated the appellant’s prior\nconfrontation of the witnesses.57 In his brief, the appellant alleged that his\nfirst trial defense counsel team “explicitly conceded nearly all of the charged\noffenses.”58 But all of the charges referred to the appellant’s second court-\nmartial were also referred to his first court-martial. Housebreaking and\nkidnapping fell off the charge sheet, and premeditated murder became\nunpremeditated murder, but the appellant was still accused of murder and\nconspiracy to commit murder. The appellant pleaded not guilty to all charges\non both occasions. TDC offered no evidence that the intensity of the\nappellant’s interest in fighting for his life against murder charges differed\nfrom one trial to the next. “A shift in the theory of the case does not defeat\nadmissibility when the underlying liability remains the same, thereby\nguaranteeing cross-examination with the same purpose . . . .” 5-804\nWeinstein’s Federal Evidence § 804.04 (2017); see also United States v.\nAvants, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"34855\"><a href=\"/opinion/34855/united-states-v-avants/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">433</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 444 (5th Cir. 2004) (finding that, in a case where the\nappellant’s “motive was to discredit a witness . . . whose testimony could, if\nbelieved, convict him,” a change in trial strategy did not create dissimilarity\nin motive).\n    Much of the appellant’s strategy for attacking his squad mates’ testimony\nrests on their freshly sworn affidavits renouncing their previous statements\nto NCIS and earlier testimony as coerced and false. Nevertheless, the\ndiscovery of new evidence useful to cross-examining a witness does not inject\ndissimilarity into the comparison of motives. “The ‘similar motive’\nrequirement is satisfied if counsel had the opportunity to cross-examine the\nwitness without restriction on the scope of the examination even if counsel\nsubsequently discovers information which was not available at the [previous]\nhearing.” Trank, 2013 CCA LEXIS 985, *13-14 (citation omitted); see also\nUnited States v.

Nothing prevented\nthe appellant’s first trial defense counsel team from exploring the\n\n\n   57   Id. at 1642.\n   58   Appellant’s Brief at 46.\n\n\n                                         29\n\f                  United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\ncircumstances under which the squad members made their statements to\nNCIS then negotiated immunity and favorable pretrial agreements in return\nfor testifying at other courts-martial, including the appellant’s.\n    Comparing his two trial defense teams in hyperbolic terms, the appellant\ntries to elevate difference in strategy to a difference in motive. The difference\nin strategy manifested in the zeal with which the trial defense teams sought\nto discredit the squad members’ testimony. But the purported unreliability of\ntestimonial evidence alone will not prevent its admission, even under MIL. R.\nEVID. 804(b)(1). Our superior court has declined to suppress testimonial\nevidence based on credibility concerns alone because “factual reliability does\nnot have to be established as a prerequisite for admitting hearsay evidence\npursuant to a well-recognized hearsay exceptions.” See Hubbard, 28 M.J. at\n33.\n    While we have no findings of fact from the military judge, the appellant\ndoes not dispute that his first defense counsel team had the opportunity to\ncross-examine all four witnesses later declared unavailable. The charges the\nappellant faced at his first court-martial and his not guilty pleas are not\nsubject to debate. The appellant has not introduced evidence sufficient to\novercome those undisputed facts. The military judge also cited the correct\nrule, MIL. R. EVID. 804(b)(1), in admitting the testimonial evidence, and his\nruling does not run afoul of the appellant’s preferred legal standard in\nDiNapoli: “whether the party resisting the offered testimony at a pending\nproceeding had at a prior proceeding an interest of substantially similar\nintensity to prove (or disprove) the same side of a substantially similar issue.”\n8 F.3d at 914-15. Finding interests of substantially similar intensity at both\ncourts-martial to dispute a substantially similar set of testimony and\ndisprove a substantially similar set of charges, we find no abuse of discretion\nin the military judge’s admission of the four unavailable squad members’\nformer testimony.\nC.

The affected decision-maker might be a\npotential court-martial member, CA, or military judge. In his analysis of\nalleged UCI in this very case, former Chief Judge Baker of the CAAF set out\nthe following factors in the context of a government actor making a public\nstatement: the comments’ intended audience, the intended and larger\naudience’s perception of the comments, existence of an intent to influence a\nproceeding’s outcome, the implicit or explicit threat of repercussions for\ndissent, and regardless of any intent, an effect of influencing outcome or\nactors. Hutchins IV, 72 M.J. at 313 (Baker, C.J., dissenting). These factors,\nwhile admittedly not binding, are instructive. The potential influence is\nunauthorized or unlawful because through “censure, reprimand, or\nadmonish[ment]”59 or something similar, a government actor manipulates,\ninterferes with, or improperly strips the actors in the court-martial process of\ntheir independence.\n    To show prejudice or compromise of the military justice process, a\ncomplaining party must tie these facts constituting UCI to some effect. “In\ncases involving [UCI], the key to our analysis is effect—not knowledge or\nintent” of the government actor.

The appellant’s burden of proof is low, but it must be more\nthan mere allegations or speculation. Stoneman, 57 M.J. at 41. The\nappearance of evil is not enough to justify action by an appellate court in a\nparticular case or, said another way, “[p]roof of command influence in the air”\nwill not suffice. Stombaugh, 40 M.J. at 213 (internal quotation marks\nomitted) (alteration in original).\n   If the appellant raises some evidence of UCI the burden shifts to the\ngovernment to rebut the allegation by persuading the court, beyond a\nreasonable doubt, that: (1) the predicate facts do not exist; (2) the facts do not\nconstitute UCI; (3) the UCI did not affect the findings or sentence; or (4) if on\nappeal, by persuading the appellate court that the UCI had no prejudicial\nimpact on the court-martial. Salyer, 72 M.J. at 423; Biagase, 50 M.J. at 151.\n   2. Apparent UCI\n     “Even if there [is] no actual [UCI], there may be a question whether the\ninfluence of command placed an ‘intolerable strain on public perception of the\nmilitary justice system.’” Stoneman, 57 M.J. at 42-43 (quoting United States\nv. Wiesen, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 175 (C.A.A.F. 2001)). Unlike actual UCI, which\nrequires prejudice to the accused, “no such showing is required for a\nmeritorious claim of an appearance of [UCI]. Rather, the prejudice involved . .\n. is the damage to the public’s perception of the fairness of the military justice\nsystem as a whole[.]” Boyce, 76 M.J. at 248. An appellant raises a claim of\napparent UCI by demonstrating (1) “facts, which if true, constitute [UCI];”\nand (2) that “this [UCI] placed an ‘intolerable strain’ on the public’s\nperception of the military justice system because ‘an objective, disinterested\nobserver, fully informed of all the facts and circumstances, would harbor a\nsignificant doubt about the fairness of the proceeding.’” Id. at 249 (quoting\nUnited States v. Lewis, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 415 (C.A.A.F. 2006)). As with actual UCI,\nthe appellant must show “some evidence” greater than “mere allegation or\nspeculation.” Biagase, 50 M.J. at 150. Some evidence of UCI will again shift\nthe burden to the government to disprove one prong or the other beyond a\nreasonable doubt. Boyce, 76 M.J. at 249-250.\n\n\n                                       32\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n   With this framework for analyzing UCI in mind, we turn to the facts of\nthe case before us.\n   3. SECNAV’s statements to the media\n    The appellant identifies SECNAV as the singular source of the UCI\nallegedly impacting him. It appears SECNAV became personally involved in\nthe appellant’s case two years after his first court-martial. The appellant\napproached some of his congressional representatives and requested they\nsolicit clemency from SECNAV on his behalf.60 As later reported in the\nmedia, SECNAV reviewed the records of the Hamdaniyah courts-martial,\ndenied the appellant’s request for clemency, and ordered that his four most\njunior squad members be administratively separated from the Marine Corps\nand Navy and that the squad lieutenant be ordered to show cause why he\nshould remain in the Marine Corps.\n   These were acts outside the court-martial process and within SECNAV’s\nauthority. Administrative separation is not an authorized court-martial\npunishment.61 SECNAV was and is the highest separation authority in the\nMarine Corps and the Navy.62 We will discuss SECNAV’s role and authority\nin granting clemency below. But it is SECNAV’s public announcement of\nthese administrative actions and his reasons for them that form the basis of\nthe appellant’s UCI claims.\n    In November 2009, SECNAV gave interviews about his recent\nadministrative actions regarding the appellant and other members of his\nsquad implicated in the killing at Hamdaniyah. The appellant attached two\nof the resulting news articles to his Motion to Dismiss for UCI: one printed in\nThe Marine Corps Times and one printed in The North County Times, a San\nDiego regional newspaper.63 From the newspaper articles, we can conclude\nthat SECNAV’s audience was Marines, the Marine Corps community, and\nspecifically, the community surrounding Camp Pendleton, California.\n   One article quoted SECNAV on his reasons for denying the appellant’s\nclemency request: “‘I thought that it was a sentence commensurate with the\n\n\n   60   AE LXXXVIII at 78.\n   61   R.C.M. 1003(b)(8).\n   62  See Marine Corps Separation and Retirement Manual at ¶¶ 1002.51, 6002.17,\n6214.1 (Ch-2, 6 Jun 2007); Naval Military Personnel Manual, Art. 1910-704 (22 Aug\n2002).\n   63  AE LXXXVIII at 74-78 (Gidget Fuentes, SecNav: No Clemency in Iraqi murder\nplot, THE MARINE CORPS TIMES, Nov. 17, 2009; Mark Walker, Navy Secretary boots 4\nPendleton troops involved in Iraqi’s killing, THE NORTH COUNTY TIMES, Nov. 17,\n2009).\n\n\n                                       33\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\ncrime,’” and “a senior Marine Corps commander’s” reduction of the appellant\nsentence from 15 years to 11 years “‘shows greatly substantial clemency\nalready.’”64 The reporter later identified that senior Marine Corps\ncommander as then-Lieutenant General James Mattis, the CA. The article\nwent on to share SECNAV’s impression of the case:\n             Mabus said he was surprised to learn that the killing was\n         “so completely premeditated, that it was not in the heat of\n         battle that not only was the action planned but the cover-up\n         was planned, and that they picked somebody at random, just\n         because he happened to be in a house that was convenient. He\n         was murdered.”\n             “It wasn’t somebody coming apart under pressure. It wasn’t\n         in the middle of action, in the middle of battle,” the [SECNAV]\n         said. “It was completely planned and completely executed. . . .\n         That was disconcerting.”65\nThe remainder of the article addressed SECNAV’s concurrent decision to\norder the administrative separations of LCpl Jackson, LCpl Shumate, PFC\nJodka, and HM3 Bacos, and his order that the squad lieutenant show cause\nwhy he should remain in the Marine Corps.\n   The second article led with SECNAV’s orders that the four junior squad\nmembers be administratively separated and that the lieutenant show cause.66\nWhile the second article reported SECNAV’s decision to deny clemency to the\nappellant, it contained no comments from SECNAV about the appellant’s\nclemency request. The reporter quoted SECNAV about the squad members\nmore generally:\n         “None of their actions lived up to the core values of the Marine\n         Corps and the Navy . . . . This was not a ‘fog of war’ case\n         occurring in the heat of battle. This was carefully planned and\n         executed, as was the cover-up. The plan was carried out exactly\n         as it had been conceived.”67\n\n\n\n\n   64   Id. at 74 (Fuentes, SecNav: No Clemency in Iraqi murder plot).\n   65   Id. at 75 (Fuentes, SecNav: No Clemency in Iraqi murder plot).\n     66 Id. at 77 (Walker, Navy Secretary boots 4 Pendleton troops involved in Iraqi’s\n\nkilling).\n   67  Id. at 77 (Walker, Navy Secretary boots 4 Pendleton troops involved in Iraqi’s\nkilling).\n\n\n                                           34\n\f                    United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nThe second reporter then quoted military law experts and two of the junior\nsquad members’ defense counsel on their reaction to the ordered\nadministrative separations.\n    SECNAV, a government actor capable of UCI,68 informed the Marine\nCorps community and the general public of administrative actions he had\ntaken toward Marines and a Sailor implicated in the killing at Hamdaniyah,\nall but one of whom had previously been convicted at court-martial. The\nquestion before this court, then, is whether SECNAV’s public\npronouncements amount to “censure, reprimand, admonish[ment]” of, or an\nattempt to threaten, coerce, or influence, another player in the court-martial\nprocess.69 As this is not the first case in which a senior official has spoken out\nabout a high visibility issue, we look at two earlier cases resulting in similar\nallegations of UCI.\n    In 1998, a Marine Corps aircraft struck cables supporting an alpine\ngondola near Aviano, Italy; all 20 people in the gondola died. See United\nStates v. Ashby, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">108</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 112 (C.A.A.F. 2009). While a Marine Corps\nCommand Investigation Board (CIB) conducted a preliminary investigation,\n“there was intense international media coverage of the gondola incident and\nunsettled political relations between the United States and Italy.” Id. at 126.\nUpon completion of the preliminary investigation, the general officer who led\nthe CIB held a press conference announcing their findings. Id. at 127. The\ngeneral officer who ordered the investigation and would later refer charges\nagainst Ashby issued a press release announcing his agreement with the\nCIB’s conclusions. Id. One day after the Article 32, UCMJ, hearing in the\ncase, the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) told one of Ashby’s peers\nthat the “mishap crew would be disciplined if they did anything wrong and\nthat ‘if someone is guilty, they need to be punished.’” Id. Behind the scenes,\nthe CMC, CA, the CIB, and other senior officials exchanged multiple phone\ncalls about the status of the investigation and its findings. Id. at 126.\n   Citing pressure on the CIB and multiple public statements about his case\nfrom senior Marine Corps officials, Ashby raised a claim of UCI. Finding no\nactual UCI, the CAAF focused on Ashby’s speculation vice presentation of\nactual evidence:\n         His claims regarding the CIB are predicated on\n         communications between the members of the CIB and various\n\n   68 SECNAV is neither a CA nor a commanding officer, and is not subject to the\nUCMJ, thus Article 37, UCMJ, does not appear to apply to him. The CAAF’s opinion\nin Boyce, however, clearly holds that a service secretary can be the source of UCI. 76\nM.J. at 252.\n   69   Art. 37, UCMJ.\n\n\n                                         35\n\f                   United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n        senior military officers. However, he has failed to show facts\n        which, if true, would demonstrate that the CIB members were\n        wrongfully influenced.\n                                   ....\n            With regard to Ashby’s claim of [UCI] arising from the\n        other actions by senior military officials, including the\n        Commandant, Ashby has not pointed to any . . . specific facts\n        that the court-martial process was tainted by unlawful\n        command influence. Because of the highly publicized\n        international nature of the incident, it is understandable that\n        many senior military officials became publicly involved in the\n        aftermath and investigation of the accident. However, there is\n        no direct evidence that the actions of any of those officials\n        improperly influenced Ashby’s court-martial.\nId. at 128-29. Nor did the CAAF find some evidence of apparent UCI in the\npublic statements. Id. at 129.\n    While not necessarily an international incident, the issue of sexual\nassault was one of the highest visibility issues in the military in 2012. The\nCMC embarked on a four-month tour of Marine Corps installations,\ndelivering what was coined the “Heritage Brief” to as many Marine officers\nand staff noncommissioned officers as he could reach. United States v.\nHowell, 2014 CCA LEXIS 321, at *3 (N-M. Ct. Crim. App. 22 May 2014). In\nthe brief, the CMC stressed the legitimacy of 80% of sexual assault claims\nand the underreporting of sexual assaults. Id. at *6-*7. He expressed his deep\ndisappointment in Marine Corps court-martial members, among others, for\nbecoming soft and retaining Marines who commit misconduct instead of\nholding them accountable and getting rid of them. Id. at *7-*8. Howell’s\ncourt-martial for sexual assault was pending at Parris Island, South\nCarolina, when the CMC delivered the Heritage Brief there, id. at *3-*4, and\nthe Heritage Brief was the subject of national media coverage the week\nbefore the members reported for the trial. Id. at *11.\n   On appeal, this court found some evidence of UCI in the CMC’s remarks\nabout sexual assault in the Marine Corps and the need to hold those who\ncommit sexual assault accountable. Id. at *28. Voir dire of the members\nrevealed that:\n        eight of the eleven members attended the Heritage Brief; many\n        had also either read White Letter 2-1270 or the media coverage;\n\n\n   70In conjunction with the Heritage Brief tour, the CMC issued White Letter 2-12,\naddressed to all Marines, announcing a Marine Corps-wide campaign to address\n\n\n                                          36\n\f                  United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n       virtually all acknowledged a high degree of deference to the\n       CMC, particularly when he holds a strong opinion on a topic;\n       they recalled the Heritage Brief primarily focusing on two\n       things – sexual assault and accountability; almost all\n       remembered and accepted as true the CMC’s statement that\n       80% of sexual assault allegations are legitimate; and, most\n       would characterize the CMC as unhappy, frustrated, or\n       disappointed in his officers and senior enlisted for their failure\n       to hold Marines accountable.\nId. at *14. This court concluded that the three military judges presiding over\nthe case had failed to cure the appearance of UCI by not excusing more of the\nmembers or rehabilitating them through curative instruction. Id. at 35-37. A\nmore carefully vetted panel of members, instructed on their independence as\nfact finders, could have tried the case with an objective outsider’s confidence\nin the integrity of the process. But this court did not believe the Heritage\nBrief in and of itself was fatal and necessitated dismissal of the charges with\nprejudice. Id. at *37-38; see also id. at *39 (Ward, S.J. concurring) (agreeing\nwith the majority that the Heritage Brief does not create an appearance of\nUCI per se).\n    Returning to the case at bar, we look for evidence of actual influence or\nsome effect that suggests influence on military justice proceedings. In this\ncase, SECNAV publicized administrative actions he had already taken or\nordered while the appellant’s court-martial was still pending appeal before\nthis court in November 2009. But SECNAV made no mention of a pending\nappeal. He cited the findings of the courts-martial as justification for the\nadministrative actions he had already taken.\n    The appellant accuses SECNAV of deliberately misrepresenting the facts\nand findings of his case in the articles. SECNAV described the killing as\npremeditated, contrary to the appellant’s acquittal of premeditated murder.\nBut in light of the appellant’s concurrent conviction for conspiracy to commit\nmurder, we cannot impugn intentional misrepresentation to his use of the\nword “premeditated.” SECNAV also appeared not to have interpreted the\nappellant’s acquittal of housebreaking and kidnapping as an acquittal of a\nconspiracy to murder a random Iraqi man. In light of our analysis of that\nissue above, we also decline to find SECNAV’s lack of precision intentionally\ndeceptive.\n\n\n\n\nsexual assault and his expectation that leadership be engaged in addressing it.\nHowell, 2014 CCA LEXIS 321, at *9.\n\n\n                                      37\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n   SECNAV’s words of “censure, reprimand, or admonish[ment]”71 were\nreserved for the appellant, his squad members, and the squad lieutenant. To\nthe extent SECNAV rebuked earlier decisions to retain the three junior\nMarines and the Sailor, he indirectly criticized administrative separation\ndecisions separate and distinct from the court-martial process. But there\nwere no expressions of disappointment or frustration with CAs, members, or\nanyone else referring or adjudicating charges at courts-martial.\n    Although SECNAV’s comments, excerpted from the November 2009\narticles, have been repeatedly reproduced in numerous publicly available\nprint and online articles, the record reveals no new comments or actions from\nSECNAV regarding the appellant since the interviews in November 2009.\nOther than a vague reference to requests for information about the status of\nthe appellant’s second court-martial from “the Secretariat” in a staff judge\nadvocate’s routine email correspondence,72 there is no evidence of SECNAV,\nor anyone acting on his behalf, directly contacting anyone, in or out of the\nDepartment of the Navy, about the appellant or this case. In fact, the\nappellant alleges that SECNAV’s subordinates were influenced by nothing\nmore than their awareness of their superior’s opinions from these articles. In\nhis brief, the appellant repeatedly alleges that subordinates bowed to\nSECNAV’s influence because they “were aware of Secretary Mabus’\ncomments.”73\n   4. Decision-makers allegedly influenced\n    We turn now to government actors and entities who subsequently made a\nrecommendation, a decision, a ruling, or took some action related to the\nappellant’s first or second court-martial. Assuming without deciding that the\nappellant has alleged facts constituting UCI in SECNAV’s words alone, we\nproceed with the Biagase and Boyce tests. To find actual UCI, we must find\n“that the proceedings were unfair” and “that [UCI] was the cause of the\nunfairness.” Biagase, 50 M.J. at 150. To find apparent UCI, we must find that\n“an objective, disinterested observer, fully informed of all the facts and\ncircumstances, would harbor a significant doubt about the fairness of the\nproceeding.” Boyce, 76 M.J. at 249 (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n\n\n\n\n   71   Art. 37, UCMJ.\n   72   AE LXXXIII.\n   73   Appellant’s Brief at 63.\n\n\n                                        38\n\f                        United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n   a. Naval Clemency and Parole Board (NC&PB)\n   The appellant cites “denied clemency/parole in Jan 2010” as the first of\nthe “unfair actions” resulting from SECNAV’s comments.74\n    Clemency is available to service members primarily through three\nstatutory avenues: Article 60, UCMJ; Article 74, UCMJ; and 10 U.S.C. § 953.\nArticle 60, UCMJ, requires a CA to consider matters an accused submits in\nclemency before taking action on the findings and sentence of a court-martial.\nAt the time of the appellant’s first court-martial, the CA had unfettered\nauthority under Article 60, UCMJ, to “disapprove, commute, or suspend the\nsentence in whole or in part.”75 Under Article 74(a), UCMJ: “The Secretary\nconcerned and, when designated by him, any Under Secretary, Assistant\nSecretary, Judge Advocate General, or commanding officer may remit or\nsuspend any part or amount of the unexecuted part of any sentence,\nincluding all uncollected forfeitures other than a sentence approved by the\nPresident.” Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 953, SECNAV maintains the NC&PB as\nhis system for granting clemency.76\n    With a few inapplicable exceptions, SECNAV has delegated his authority\nto act in matters of clemency and parole to the Assistant SECNAV for\nManpower and Reserve Affairs (ASN(M&RA)).77 The NC&PB is composed of\na civilian director and four senior officers representing communities in the\nMarine Corps and Navy.78 The board’s mission is to “act for or provide\nrecommendations or advice to SECNAV in the issuance of decisions regarding\nclemency or parole matters[.]”79 Among the board’s functions is to “submit to\nSECNAV, with recommendation for final action . . .\n         (a)    Cases in which SECNAV or a designee has indicated in\n         writing an official interest. . . .\n         (d)    Any individual whose clemency may be the subject of\n         controversy or substantial congressional or press interest as\n         determined by SECNAV or a designee . . .\n\n\n\n\n   74   Id. at 61.\n    75 Art. 60(c)(2), UCMJ. The appellant’s CA reduced his sentence to confinement\n\nfrom 15 years to 11 years pursuant to his Article 60, UCMJ, authority.\n   76   Secretary of the Navy Instruction (SECNAVINST) 5815.3J (12 Jun 2003).\n   77   Id. at ¶ 205 (emphasis omitted).\n   78   Id. at ¶ 307.\n   79   Id. at ¶ 306.\n\n\n                                           39\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n         (e)    Cases in which the NC&PB recommends clemency for\n         any offender whose approved unsuspended, [sic] sentence to\n         confinement is in excess of 10 years . . . .”80\nClemency and parole are not rights but decisions within the NC&PB’s and\nSECNAV’s discretion.81 While consideration of clemency is part of the post-\ntrial process, it is considered an executive, not a judicial function. See United\nStates v. Healy, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">394</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 395-96 (C.M.A. 1988).\n    Given SECNAV’s statutory authority to grant or deny clemency, we are\nskeptical that his influence over the process, assuming he had any, was\ninappropriate, much less unlawful. As Chief Judge Baker wrote in his dissent\nin Hutchins IV, “[SECNAV] would be hard pressed to exercise unlawful\ncommand influence over the NC&PB clemency decision over which he retains\nsole discretion with the sort of public comments attributed to him in this\ncase.” 72 M.J. at 317 (Baker, C.J., dissenting). Judge Ryan, in her concurring\nopinion in Hutchins IV, acknowledged that “SECNAVINST 5815.3J limits the\nNC&PB’s role in Appellant’s clemency process to one that merely advises the\nSecretary on a matter committed, by statute, to his discretion.” Id. at 303\n(Ryan, J. concurring in the result). The appellant accuses SECNAV of\ninterfering in his own process by revealing his opinion to his own advisers. If\nSECNAV’s public comments are the source of UCI, the revelation of the\nopinion, not the manner in which SECNAV reached it, is the issue. Assuming\nwithout deciding that SECNAV could inappropriately influence his own\nadvisers by communicating a decision to them, we evaluate the evidence in\nlight of the tests in Biagase and Boyce.\n    The appellant offers no evidence as to why a decision to deny him\nclemency or parole was unfair. He simply includes it in a list of unfavorable\nactions and decisions made since November 2009 that he characterizes as\n“unfair.”82\n   Moving to the third Biagase factor, causation, the appellant alleges that\nthe NC&PB reversed course and recommended no clemency—when they had\npreviously recommended a six-year reduction in confinement—because they\nwere “aware” of SECNAV’s opinion.83 First, that argument rests on the\nunsupported assumption that board membership was constant from 2009 to\n2010. But more important, the government presented evidence undermining\nthe purported effect of SECNAV’s statement. TC presented the acting\n\n   80   Id. at ¶ 308.a.(6) (emphasis omitted).\n   81   Id. at ¶ 308.a and b.\n   82   Appellant’s Brief at 61.\n   83   Id. at 63.\n\n\n                                            40\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nASN(M&RA)’s 10 March 2009 memorandum notifying the President of the\nNC&PB of his disagreement with the board’s recommendation and denial of\nany clemency for the appellant.84\n    In his Motion to Dismiss for UCI, the appellant detailed his further\nrequests for clemency and the results. In June 2010, the appellant was\nreleased from confinement following this court’s decision to set aside his\nconviction. After being ordered back into confinement in February 2011, the\nappellant filed a special request for clemency with the NC&PB. The board\nrecommended reducing the appellant’s sentence by 251 days, and the acting\nASN(M&RA) approved.85 The NC&PB subsequently recommended parole in\nJune 2011, but the new ASN(M&RA) disapproved. A year later, the NC&PB\nrecommended against clemency and parole, but then in 2013, the board\nrecommended granting parole. ASN(M&RA) rejected the recommendation.86\nThis fluctuation further undermines any reasonable expectation of\nconsistency in recommendations from year to year.\n    Looking at the facts presented by both the appellant and the government,\nwe do not see “some evidence” that the appellant’s proceedings for requesting\nclemency were unfair or that the appellant was denied additional clemency\nbecause of SECNAV’s public statements. ASN(M&RA) rejected NC&PB’s\nrecommendation for clemency in March 2009 and communicated his decision\ndirectly to the President of the NC&PB. The appellant has failed to\ndemonstrate how SECNAV subsequently interfered with the process or\ninappropriately influenced the NC&PB by reaching the identical decision\neight months later and indirectly communicating it to the NC&PB via the\nmedia.\n    Turning to apparent UCI of the NC&PB, we note that a member of the\nCAAF previously concluded that “[n]o member of the public, aware of the\nremarks made and the change in clemency recommendation that occurred,\ncould fail to harbor grave concerns that the change in the NC&PB’s clemency\nrecommendation was directly related to the Secretary’s intemperate remarks\nabout Appellant[.]” Hutchins IV, 72 M.J. at 302-03 (Ryan, J. concurring in the\nresult). However, it appears Judge Ryan reached her conclusion without the\nbenefit of ASN(M&RA)’s March 2009 memorandum, which the government\nsubsequently submitted during the appellant’s second court-martial. In light\nof that evidence, we are convinced, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the\ngovernment has dispelled any notion that “[UCI] placed an intolerable strain\non the public’s perception of the military justice system because an objective,\n\n   84   AE LXXXIX at 23.\n   85   AE LXXXVIII at 8.\n   86   Id. at 8-9.\n\n\n                                        41\n\f                    United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\ndisinterested observer, fully informed of all the facts and circumstances,\nwould harbor a significant doubt about the fairness of the proceeding.” Boyce,\n76 M.J. at 249.\n    When the appellant raised the effect of UCI on the NC&PB before his\nsecond court-martial, the government presented ASN(M&RA)’s 10 March\n2009 memorandum to the President of NC&PB. In it, he declined to approve\nthe board’s recommendation to reduce the appellant’s confinement by six\nyears and denied any clemency for the appellant. In the routine\ncorrespondence documenting his decision, ASN(M&RA) went on to respond to\nthe NC&PB’s recommendation with the following:\n             Having thoroughly reviewed Private Hutchins’ case,\n         specifically including the evidence presented on his behalf, I\n         found the adjudged sentence to be appropriate for the murder\n         of an innocent Iraqi national and the subsequent attempts to\n         fraudulently cast the incident as an attack upon United States\n         forces. These acts represented a significant departure from the\n         conduct expected of a Marine, no matter how dire the situation\n         or circumstances.87\nThe decision and the comments supporting it predated SECNAV’s comments\nby eight months, and there is no evidence that SECNAV was aware of the\nexchange or in any way influenced ASN(M&RA). In fact, the record suggests\nthat SECNAV only became involved in the appellant’s case when\ncongressional members approached him personally on the appellant’s behalf.\nAny consultation between SECNAV and ASN(M&RA) in advance of\nASN(M&RA)’s decision to deny the clemency recommendation would have\ndefeated the purpose of SECNAV’s delegation of authority.\n    Although apparent UCI does not require evidence of causation, it is the\nappearance that SECNAV abruptly derailed the appellant’s prospects for\nclemency with his comments that constitutes the evidence of apparent UCI in\nthis case. ASN(M&RA)’s unequivocal denial of the appellant’s clemency in\nremarkably similar terms, addressed directly to the board eight months\nearlier, negates that appearance. No observer aware of that March 2009\ndenial can believe that, but for SECNAV’s comments, the appellant would\nhave received the NC&PB’s recommended clemency. To the extent\nsubsequent NC&PB board members felt chilled against recommending\nclemency for the appellant, a reasonable observer would be hard pressed to\nattribute that chilling effect to SECNAV instead of the senior official who had\nalready disapproved the recommendation as a matter of due course.\n\n\n   87   AE LXXXIX at 23.\n\n\n                                       42\n\f                  United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n    This evidence undermining the appearance that NC&PB reversed course\nin response to SECNAV’s comments also addresses the first of three points\nJudge Ryan found bolstered her concerns about the fairness of the clemency\nprocess:\n       (1) the NC&PB’s dramatic change following the Secretary’s\n       comments that Appellant receive no clemency or parole; (2) the\n       subordinate status of all NC&PB members to the Secretary,\n       and (3) the fact that any NC&PB clemency or parole\n       recommendation would have to be approved by the\n       [ASN(M&RA)], who was presumably aware of the Secretary’s\n       position on this matter.\nHutchins IV, 72 M.J. at 302 (Ryan, J. concurring in the result) (internal\ncitations omitted). We respectfully submit that awareness of ASN(M&RA)’s\nMarch 2009 memorandum significantly weakens any apparent causal link\nbetween SECNAV’s comments and NC&PB’s change in recommendation.\nSecond, members of NC&PB are also subordinate to ASN(M&RA), and they\nunderstand their role is to submit cases like the appellant’s with\nrecommendations for final action by ASN(M&RA) or SECNAV. Third, the\nmemorandum reveals that ASN(M&RA) communicated a disinclination to\naward the appellant clemency eight months before he presumably learned of\nSECNAV’s position on the matter. Thus, for NC&PB, SECNAV’s comments\nwere less of an influence than an echo.\n    Finally, someone aware that NC&PB membership and recommendations\nare not consistent from year to year would not expect consistency in the\nboard’s recommendations. We are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that\na reasonable observer, cognizant of all of the facts and circumstances, would\nfind SECNAV’s comments far less consequential to subsequent NC&PB\nrecommendations, if consequential at all. We find that, at the appellant’s\nsecond court-martial, the government successfully rebutted the appearance of\nUCI infecting the NC&PB’s consideration of the appellant’s clemency\nrequests.\n   b. The Judge Advocate General\n    Next, the appellant claims that, following this court’s decision in Hutchins\nI, the Judge Advocate General (JAG) of the Navy succumbed to UCI and felt\ncompelled to certify the case to the CAAF for further review.\n   Pursuant to Article 67, UCMJ, and RULE FOR COURTS-MARTIAL (R.C.M.)\n1203, MANUAL FOR COURTS-MARTIAL, UNITED STATES (2012 ed.), the JAG\nmay “forward the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals to the Court of\nAppeals for the Armed Forces for review with respect to any matter of law.”\nR.C.M. 1203(c)(1).\n\n\n                                      43\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n    On 22 April 2010, this court set aside the findings and sentence of the\nappellant’s first court-martial, citing an improper severance of the appellant’s\nattorney-client relationship with one of his detailed defense counsel.\nHutchins I, 68 M.J. at 631. The record was returned to the JAG for remand to\nan appropriate CA with authority to order a rehearing. Id. Instead, the JAG\nexercised his authority to certify issues related to the severance of counsel to\nthe CAAF. Hutchins II, 69 M.J. at 283-84. The CAAF found that severance of\nthe appellant’s relationship with one of his detailed defense counsel did not\nmaterially prejudice his rights and remanded the case to this court for a new\nreview under Article 66, UCMJ. Id. at 293.\n    Citing the JAG’s occupation of his billet in November 2009—a billet in\nwhich he was SECNAV’s direct subordinate—the appellant assumes the JAG\nwas aware of SECNAV’s comments. The appellant also offers media reports\nthat the JAG’s advisors recommended against certification of the case,\npresumably to suggest that the JAG acted in accordance with something\nother than sound legal judgment.88 He alleges that “certification of Hutchins I\nto CAAF ultimately led to the reinstatement of Sgt Hutchins’ convictions, and\nled to Sgt Hutchins serving an additional 29 months of confinement.”89\n    Assuming, arguendo, that the JAG was familiar with the newspaper\narticles, the appellant fails to demonstrate that the decision to certify his case\nwas prejudicial, much less unfair. Had the JAG not certified the appellant’s\ncase to CAAF, he would have remanded it to a CA with the authority to order\na rehearing. Ultimately, that happened, after the CAAF’s decision to set\naside the findings and sentence in Hutchins IV. Attributing an additional 29\nmonths of confinement to that delay is baseless, as there is no way to know\nhow the appellant’s rehearing and subsequent appeals might have unfolded\nwithout the certification. Instead, the JAG acted within his authority, and\nthe appellant cannot show some evidence of an unfair proceeding or prejudice\nresulting from the JAG’s decision, much less from UCI.\n   We agree with Chief Judge Baker’s observation that “subordination, a\ndivergence in staff advice, and a certification do not alone amount to some\nevidence of [UCI]. Rather they reflect the ordinary process of review and\nappeal.” Hutchins IV, 72 M.J. at 315 (Baker, C.J., dissenting). There is no\ncause for an “objective, disinterested observer, fully informed of all the facts\nand circumstances,” to “harbor a significant doubt about the fairness of the\nproceeding.” Boyce, 76 M.J. at 249.\n\n\n    88 Regardless of what advice the JAG might have received, his judgment was\n\nsound. The CAAF overturned this court’s decision based on one of the issues the JAG\ncertified. Hutchins II, 69 M.J. at 292-93.\n   89   Appellant’s Brief at 65.\n\n\n                                        44\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n   Accordingly, we find that the appellant has failed to satisfy his initial\nburden of providing some evidence of UCI of the JAG.\n   c. Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals (NMCCA)\n    The appellant speculates that three former judges of this court “desire[d]\nto validate the Secretary of the Navy” when they “failed to diligently review\nthe record and the pleadings, and were predisposed to affirm the conviction\nand find that Secretary Mabus did not engage in [UCI]” in Hutchins III, 2012\nCCA LEXIS 93.90\n    When the newspaper articles appeared in November 2009, the appellant’s\ncase was still pending its first review before this court. Although not\nappearing to address the appellate court, SECNAV publicly shared that, after\nreading the record of the appellant’s court-martial, he was convinced the\nappellant led his squad in planning, executing, and covering up the\npremeditated murder of an Iraqi civilian. According to SECNAV, the\nappellant had received the sentence he deserved. Five months later, this\ncourt set aside the findings and sentence from the appellant’s court-martial\nand remanded the case for rehearing. The CAAF, comprised entirely of judges\noutside the Department of the Navy, reversed and remanded to this court for\na new review. Two of the three appellate judges on the panel deciding\nHutchins III had concurred in the en banc decision to set aside in Hutchins I.\nHutchins III, 2012 CCA LEXIS 93, at *1 (opinion by Perlak, S.J. with\nCarberry, S.J. and Modzelewski, J. concurring); Hutchins I, 68 M.J. at 631\n(Carberry, S.J. and Perlak, J., concurring in the majority opinion). In\nHutchins III, this court affirmed the findings and sentence, finding no merit\nin an allegation of UCI or other AOEs. 2012 CCA LEXIS 93, at *11, *32.\n    In addition to presenting some evidence of UCI, the appellant must also\novercome the presumption that appellate judges “know the law and apply it\ncorrectly.” United States v. Clark, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 300 (C.A.A.F. 2016) (citations\nomitted). “Without such evidence, courts will not conclude that a military\njudge was affected by unlawful command influence.” Hutchins IV, 72 M.J. at\n314 (Baker, C.J., dissenting) (citing United States v. Rivers, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 443\n(C.A.A.F. 1998)).\n   To rebut “the presumption of regularity that applies to the acts of the\nappellate military judges”91 and demonstrate some unfairness in the\nappellate review of his case, the appellant focuses on the content of the\nopinion. According to the appellant, the opinion’s author failed to recite the\ncharges, specifications, or language of which the appellant was acquitted, he\n\n\n   90   Id. at 69.\n   91   Clark, 75 M.J. at 300.\n\n\n                                       45\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nsummarized, instead of quoted, SECNAV’s statements as published in the\narticles, and he “falsely claimed to have granted all the defense motions to\nattach UCI-related documents to the record.”92 From this third, readily\nprovable oversight, the appellant concludes the panel either failed to read the\nrecord of trial or the pleadings, or knowingly made a false statement.93\nReading the Hutchins III opinion, and particularly the UCI analysis, we find\nno merit in the appellant’s allegations of impropriety, or unfairness, at the\nappellate court level.\n    The appellant also falls short of demonstrating some evidence of\ncausation. To tie Hutchins III to SECNAV’s UCI, the appellant characterizes\nthe opinion as “a complete validation of Secretary Mabus’ actions and an\nadoption of his view of the case”94 instead of the full or partial dismissal the\nappellant requested.95 Striving to explain how Senior Judges Perlak and\nCarberry suddenly abdicated their judicial responsibility under pressure from\nSECNAV in Hutchins III, when they had been comfortable reversing the\nconvictions in Hutchins I, the appellant speculates that in April 2010 this\ncourt was not yet aware of SECNAV’s comments. The appellant’s tangled\nexplanation of whom the UCI affected and when is nothing more than “mere\nallegation or speculation.” Stoneman, 57 M.J. at 41; see also Hutchins, 72\nM.J. at 314 (Baker, C.J., dissenting) (concluding that the “Appellant has not\nmoved beyond mere allegation or speculation in demonstrating ‘some\nevidence’ that the CCA proceedings were unfair or affected by unlawful\ncommand influence.”).\n    Finally, the CAAF’s subsequent decision setting aside the appellant’s\nfindings and sentence and authorizing a new trial in Hutchins IV nullifies\nthis court’s holdings in Hutchins III and any negative effect the appellant\nmight have suffered therefrom. He received a new trial. The appellant\ndisputes mootness by insisting this court shirked its Article 66, UCMJ, duty\nto dismiss the charges with prejudice for factual insufficiency. But the\nevidence against the appellant simply did not support a finding of factual\ninsufficiency. Despite the harmless misstatement regarding motions to attach\nin Hutchins III, the appellant has failed to demonstrate some evidence that\nhis appeal was unfair or that the appellant judges ceded their judicial\nindependence in an effort to please SECNAV. For the same reasons, the\nappellant has also failed to demonstrate some evidence that an objective,\n\n\n   92   Appellant’s Brief at 68 (citation omitted).\n   93   Id. at 69.\n   94   Appellant’s Reply of 6 Mar 2017 at 44.\n   95   Appellant’s Brief at 70.\n\n\n                                             46\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\ndisinterested observer, fully informed of all the facts and circumstances,\nwould harbor a significant doubt about the fairness of the proceeding.\n   d. CAs and their staff judge advocates\n    The appellant avers that the two CAs who referred charges to his second\ngeneral court-martial and rejected his requests for administrative separation\nin lieu of trial (SILT) and offers to plead guilty were compromised by UCI. He\nasserts that UCI affected the staff judge advocates (SJAs) who advised them\nas well.\n    To demonstrate the impact of UCI on his CAs in this case, the appellant\nproffers evidence that the CAs were aware of SECNAV’s published statement\nas they made decisions propelling the appellant toward court-martial.\n    The first of the two CAs, Lieutenant General (LtGen) Robert Neller,\nUSMC, referred the charges to the appellant’s second court-martial. In his\nrole as CA, he also received and ultimately denied appellant’s requests for\nrelease from pretrial confinement, assignment to desired duties, SILT, and\nacceptance of a proposed pretrial agreement.\n   In an affidavit signed 14 August 2014, LtGen Neller wrote:\n         I was generally aware of [sic] the Secretary of the Navy made\n         some comment to the press and others in 2009 about the case,\n         but do not know any of the specifics. This had no influence on\n         my referral decision. I did not receive any direct or indirect\n         influences from any senior officer or official regarding the\n         handling of this case.96\nAt an Article 39(a), UCMJ, session on 5 March 2015, LtGen Neller testified\nthat SECNAV’s comments “had no bearing on anything that [he] did in\nrelation to this case.”97 According to his testimony and his electronic\ncorrespondence, he consulted only with his legal counsel about this case.\nLtGen Neller referred charges based on his personal knowledge of the\ncharged events, having been in Iraq at the time, and his review of\nstatements.98 Excerpts of LtGen Neller’s electronic correspondence contain no\nevidence that SECNAV or anyone else in LtGen Neller’s chain of command\ncommunicated with him regarding his decisions.\n   The appellant alleges that UCI tainted advice the SJA, Colonel (Col) G,\ngave LtGen Neller. SJAs, like military judges, enjoy the presumption of\nknowledge of and compliance with the law and their independent duties,\n\n   96   AE LIV.\n   97   Record at 698.\n   98   Id. at 701.\n\n\n                                        47\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nabsent evidence to the contrary. See Ashby, 68 M.J. at 130 (C.A.A.F. 2009)\n(presuming that “legal officers properly performed their professional duties\nwhich included independent review of the evidence and preparation of only\nthose charges for which they determined probable cause existed.”). Relying on\nsupport from Col G’s electronic correspondence, the appellant proffers that\nCol G was cognizant of SECNAV’s comments, the motion to dismiss for UCI,\nrequests for information “originating from the ‘Secretariat,’” and LtGen\nNeller’s desire for input from the SJA to the CMC following the reversal of\nconvictions.\n    The appellant also alleges that the SJA’s office and the prosecution “were\non the same ‘team’” because Col G addressed his deputy and the trial counsel\nas “Team” in an email asking that defense counsel route their requests for\nthe CA through trial counsel.99 This does not amount to evidence that Col G\nassumed a prosecutorial role. Nor did the email require Col G to disqualify\nhimself as the SJA. See United States v. Chessani, 2009 CCA LEXIS 84, *5-6,\n*21 (N-M. Ct. Crim. App. 17 Mar 2009) (affirming apparent UCI based on the\npresence of a disqualified SJA—who had interviewed Chessani, elicited\nincriminating statements from him, and was “intimately involved in drafting\nfindings and conclusions” about him—when subordinate SJAs briefed the CA\nabout the case). The appellant has not presented sufficient evidence to\novercome the presumption of Col G’s compliance with the law or to\ndemonstrate that Col G or any of the other SJAs acted as an investigator,\nmilitary judge, or counsel in this case and thus should be disqualified.\n    The appellant also alludes to a memorandum to the Justice Department\nrequesting testimonial immunity for one of the appellant’s squad members. It\nwas likely drafted by TC, reviewed by Col G, and bore LtGen Neller’s\nsignature. Citing concerns about the armed forces’ image abroad and\ndifficulties in renewing the Status of Forces Agreement with Iraq, the\nmemorandum sought assistance “to reinstate Sergeant Hutchins’\nconvictions.”100 LtGen Neller testified that the wrong words were used in that\nstatement and clarified his intent was to seek retrial, not reinstatement of\nconvictions.101 Regardless of the propriety of references to political concerns\nor Status of Forces Agreements, the memorandum provides no evidence of\nSECNAV’s influence.\n   LtGen Neller was relieved by LtGen Kenneth McKenzie, USMC, who\nthen became the appellant’s CA. As evidence of the impact of UCI on LtGen\nMcKenzie, the appellant cites his denial of a SILT request. The appellant’s\n\n   99   Appellant’s Brief at 72.\n   100   AE LXXXVIII at 151.\n   101   Record at 704.\n\n\n                                        48\n\f                       United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nSILT request “specifically highlighted Secretary Mabus’ comments in detail,\nalong with referencing Air Force cases of political retaliation against\nconvening authorities, as justification for the SILT, in order to restore public\nconfidence in the independence of convening authorities.”102 LtGen McKenzie\nalso refused to meet with the appellant’s civilian defense counsel or to\nnegotiate a pretrial agreement with him.\n    In an affidavit, LtGen McKenzie wrote, “I do not recall any prior specific\ncomments made about this case by any particular individual, including the\nSecretary of the Navy, the Honorable Ray Mabus, General Hagee and\nGeneral Conway.”103 Based on his “independent review of this matter post-\nreferral,” LtGen McKenzie concurred with the SJA’s Article 34, UCMJ,\nadvice.104 LtGen McKenzie declared his independence as a CA, denied any\nattempts to influence him, and affirmed his presumption of the appellant’s\ninnocence and right to a fair trial.105\n    At the Article 39(a), UCMJ, hearing, LtGen McKenzie testified to having\nno recollection of SECNAV’s comments at the time of their publication and to\nlearning about them only through the appellant’s motion to dismiss for UCI.\nWhen asked for his “immediate reaction” to SECNAV’s comments, LtGen\nMcKenzie testified, “I’m dealing in, you know, 2014, 2015 and they don’t\nseem to have any bearing on what I’m going to do and what actions I’m going\n[to] take as the [CA] in the case. So, no, they did not particularly concern\nme.”106 LtGen McKenzie confirmed that he had conducted his own\nindependent review of the appellant’s case upon assuming command from\nLtGen Neller and concurred with the decision to refer charges.107\n   With regard to LtGen Neller, Col G, and LtGen McKenzie, the appellant\nsubmits that their unwillingness to grant his requests for a more favorable\ndisposition, coupled with their full knowledge of SECNAV’s opinions in 2009,\nconstitutes at least some evidence of UCI. Their electronic correspondence\nreveals no evidence of influence from SECNAV or a lack of independence in\npursuing the case.108 But for the briefings and publicity surrounding the\nappellant’s motion to dismiss for UCI, it is unclear whether the CAs would\nhave even known what SECNAV said. Neither LtGen Neller nor LtGen\n\n   102   Appellant’s Brief at 81 (citation omitted).\n   103   AE LVIII at 3.\n   104   Id. at 4.\n   105   Id.\n   106   Record at 785.\n   107   Id. at 790-91.\n   108   AE LXXXIII.\n\n\n                                             49\n\f                    United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nMcKenzie could have testified more emphatically about the irrelevance of\nSECNAV’s comments to their deliberative process or their independence of\njudgment. The appellant has again fallen short of presenting some evidence\nof either unfairness or causation.\n    Finally, there is not some evidence of apparent UCI. This case has none of\nthe hallmarks of apparent UCI identified in Boyce. In Boyce, the CA had\ndrawn considerable public criticism from Congress and the media for setting\naside sexual assault convictions in the court-martial of a lieutenant colonel\nand direct but quiet criticism from the JAG of the Air Force for declining to\nrefer charges of sexual assault against an airman. 76 M.J. at 244-45. The\nnewly confirmed Secretary of the Air Force directed the Air Force Chief of\nStaff to call the CA and present him with two choices—“voluntarily\nretire from the Air Force at the lower grade of major general, or wait for the\nSecretary to remove him from his command in the immediate future.” Id. at\n251-52. Within three hours of the call, the CA decided to retire early. Id. at\n252. In formally requesting retirement, the CA wrote, “[m]y decisions as a\nGeneral Court Martial [sic] [CA] . . . have come under great public scrutiny,\nand media attention . . . will likely occur on subsequent sexual assault cases I\ndeal with.” Id. at 245-46 (internal quotation marks omitted). The effect on\nBoyce came ten days later when the CA referred charges of sexual assault\nagainst him. Id. The CAAF found the appearance of UCI in the facts\npreceding the CA’s decision. Id. at 251. They “conclude[d] that members of\nthe public would understandably question whether the conduct of the\nSecretary of the Air Force and/or the Chief of Staff of the Air Force\nimproperly inhibited [the CA] from exercising his court-martial convening\nauthority in a truly independent and impartial manner as is required to\nensure the integrity of the referral process.” Id. at 252-253; see also United\nStates v. Gerlich, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">309</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 314 (C.A.A.F. 1996) (setting aside findings and\nsentence because a general court-martial CA wrote a letter to his subordinate\nspecial court-martial CA questioning his resolution of a sexual assault\nallegation with nonjudicial punishment and “request[ing]” that the special\ncourt-martial CA consider further investigation).\n    In contrast, there is no evidence of implicit or explicit threats of\nretaliation, congressional chastisement, or even a phone call to any of the\nCAs in this case at the behest of SECNAV or anyone else. SECNAV’s\ndisapproval of decisions to retain some of the appellant’s most junior squad\nmates, expressed five years earlier, does not amount to the kind of “censure,\nreprimand, or admonish[ment]”109 that creates an appearance of UCI. Unlike\nthe CA in Boyce, who was forced to retire for his actions, both LtGen Neller\nand LtGen McKenzie affirmed their unhindered independence and the\n\n   109   Art. 37, UCMJ.\n\n\n                                      50\n\f                  United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nabsence of SECNAV’s influence from their decisions. Again, the appellant has\noffered nothing more than speculation and allegation. Unfavorable decisions\nmade with awareness of a five-year-old SECNAV article and nothing more do\nnot create an appearance of UCI.\n   e. Military judge\n    Finally, the appellant alleges that the military judge, with full awareness\nof SECNAV’s statements, made legally unsupported rulings on motions\nrelated to UCI to protect SECNAV and his own post-retirement employment\nin the Department of Defense.\n    Absent evidence to the contrary, military judges enjoy a presumption of\nresistance to UCI in their decisions. Rivers, 49 M.J. at 443; see also\nStombaugh, 40 M.J. at 213 (holding that the court would “not presume that a\nmilitary judge has been influenced simply by the proximity of events which\ngive the appearance of command influence in the absence of a connection to\nthe result of a particular trial.” (citations omitted)).\n    It is worth examining a case of unlawful influence of a military judge for\nperspective. In Salyer, prosecutors and a supervisory circuit judge took action\ntoward the military judge presiding over Salyer’s court-martial. “Perplexed”\nby one of the military judge’s rulings on a pretrial motion, trial counsel\naccessed the military judge’s personnel record looking for evidence of a\npotential personal bias. Salyer, 72 M.J. at 420. Trial counsel then questioned\nthe military judge about personal information from his file in voir dire and\nchallenged him for actual and implied bias. Id. Eager to warn the military\njudge’s supervisory judge about this unusual turn of events, one of the senior\nprosecutors shared the discovered personal information and plans for voir\ndire with the supervisory judge as a courtesy. Id. In a subsequent\nconversation between the two judges, the supervisory judge mentioned the\nphone call from the prosecutor, the perplexing ruling, the reaction to it, and\nthe government’s intent to seek the military judge’s recusal. Id. at 421.\nRecusing himself from the case, the military judge cited “an inappropriate\nmethod for addressing a disagreement with [his] ruling” as cause for a\nreasonable person to question his impartiality on future decisions in the case.\nId. at 421-422. The CAAF agreed with the military judge, finding that “[a]n\nobjective, disinterested observer, fully informed of these facts and\ncircumstances, might well be left with the impression that the prosecution in\na military trial has the power to manipulate which military judge presides in\na given case . . . .” Id. at 427; see also Lewis, 63 M.J. at 414, 416 (finding\nactual UCI in the command’s “unlawful effort to unseat an otherwise\nproperly detailed and qualified military judge” and ordering dismissal with\nprejudice because the government could not render its error harmless). In\nSalyer’s case, the government successfully replaced the military judge.\n\n\n                                      51\n\f                  United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n    The appellant offers no evidence of prosecutorial skullduggery,\ngovernment efforts to embarrass, manipulate, or replace the military judge in\nthis case, or criticism or questions from anyone in the military judge’s chain\nof command. Instead, the appellant attempts to demonstrate unlawful\ninfluence with the military judge’s subordinate position to SECNAV, his\nknowledge of SECNAV’s statements five years earlier, and the rulings he\nmade. Once again, the appellant’s differing interpretation of the law and the\nfacts is not evidence of an unfair proceeding. SECNAV’s position at the top of\nthe military judge’s chain of command and the theoretical prospect of\ndownward pressure alone are not evidence of causation. The appellant\nimplies that the military judge’s post-retirement employment aspirations\nwith the Department of Defense and possibly the Department of the Navy are\nevidence of UCI. Without evidence that SECNAV retaliated against—or\nrewarded—anyone for their actions resolving the Hamdaniyah cases, such an\nimplication is bare allegation and speculation.\n    While this court does not condone senior officials making public\ncomments about courts-martial pending appeal, the appellant has, with one\nexception, failed to present some evidence of actual or apparent UCI on his\ncourt-martial proceedings. In the case of apparent UCI affecting the NC&PB,\nthe government rebutted the appearance of UCI, and we are convinced,\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, that an objective observer, cognizant of all the\nfacts and circumstances, would not harbor a significant doubt about the\nfairness of the clemency process.\nD. Apparent UCI from the search of defense counsel’s office\n    The appellant argues that apparent UCI arising from a government\nsearch of one of his detailed defense counsel’s office necessitates setting aside\nhis findings and sentence and ordering the government to pay reasonable\nattorney fees for his civilian defense counsel.\n   “‘Where the issue of unlawful command influence is litigated on the\nrecord, the military judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under a clearly-\nerroneous standard, but the question of command influence flowing from\nthose facts is a question of law that this Court reviews de novo.’” United\nStates v.

On 2 May 2014, Criminal Investigative Division\n(CID) agents executed a command search authorization and searched\nmultiple defense counsel offices within Legal Support Services Section (LSSS)\n\n                                       52\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n–West spaces aboard Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California. Agents\nsuspected a cell phone belonging to Sgt Betancourt was in the office of one of\nhis defense attorneys. Id. at *9-*10. With the cooperation of the senior trial\ncounsel, three CID agents searched defense counsel offices, and a fourth\nagent recorded video of the search. Id. at *11. “The agents were professional\nbut extremely thorough, searching through desk drawers, file cabinets,\nlockers, garbage cans, and ceiling tiles. The agents opened case files, but\nquickly flipped through the files without pausing to read documents within\nthe files.” Id. at *12.\n    This court found some evidence of apparent UCI in Betancourt but was\n“convinced beyond reasonable doubt that an objective, disinterested observer,\nfully informed of all the facts and circumstances, would not harbor a\nsignificant doubt as to the fairness of [Betancourt’s] court-martial[.]” Id. at\n*27. “[T]he government took significant corrective action after the search to\nlimit disclosure of any information obtained by CID agents during the search.\nThis included removing the [senior trial counsel], the trial counsel, and the\ninvestigators from further involvement with the investigation or court-\nmartial. . . . The video recording of the search was secured by order until a\nspecial investigating officer was appointed to review it for potential leakage\nof privileged information. Subsequently, the recording was sealed by the\nmilitary judge who reviewed it in camera.” Id. at *27-*28.\n    Unbeknownst to prosecutors, the command search authorization was not\nlimited to Sgt Betancourt’s counsels’ offices, and the search extended to the\noffices of five other defense counsel not associated with Sgt Betancourt’s case.\nId. at *11-*12. One of the offices searched belonged to Captain (Capt) S.L.,\none of the detailed defense counsel in the case before us. The appellant’s TDC\nfiled a motion to disqualify members of LSSS-West and any CID personnel\ninvolved in the 2 May 2014 search, and the parties litigated the impact of the\nsearch on the appellant’s case.\n    In his written ruling on the motion, the military judge reached findings of\nfact supported by the record that are not clearly erroneous. Returning to his\noffice after it was searched, Capt S.L. “noticed ‘many books and binders out of\nplace on the bookshelf’ where his kept his Hutchins case file, [but] he could\nnot say whether documents therein were searched.”110 The four CID agents\nwho participated in the search testified to only flipping through file folders in\nsearch of the cell phone and not reading the files’ contents. Review of the\nvideo recording of the search of Capt S.L.’s office111 by the military judge and\nthis court corroborates the agents’ testimony. The video indicates that the\n\n   110   AE LIX at 2 (quoting AE XXXI at 33)\n   111   AE LVII.\n\n\n                                         53\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nsearch of Capt S.L.’s office lasted about five minutes. The agents also testified\nthat they knew nothing about the appellant’s case.\n    TC who prosecuted the appellant at his second court-martial were also\nnot involved in the search authorization or the search. As documented in an\naffidavit, Capt P.M. “played no role in the planning or execution of the\nBetancourt Command Authorization for Search and Seizure.”112 Almost six\nweeks after the search, he was assigned to the trial team in the Betancourt\ncase because the original trial counsel were disqualified. Despite litigating\nissues related to the search in multiple courts-martial, Capt P.M. never\nviewed video of the search or discussed it with the senior trial counsel who\nfacilitated the search, any of the investigators, or the judge advocate who\nconducted the taint review.113 Capt P.M. stated in his affidavit, “I have not\nheard, reviewed, seen, learned, read, or gleaned anything related to Sgt\nHutchins as a result of the search.”114 The other trial counsel, Major (Maj)\nA.W., also swore in an affidavit, “I have not heard, reviewed, seen, learned,\nread, or gleaned anything related to Sgt Hutchins as a result of the\nsearch.”115 Maj A.W. was stationed in Austin, Texas, on the day of the search.\n   The military judge concluded that the circumstances of the search of\ndefense counsel offices raised some evidence of apparent UCI in this case. We\ndo not dispute that finding, particularly in light of our similar conclusion in\nBetancourt. While the military judge found the government could not\ndisprove the “predicate facts on which the allegation of UCI is based[,]” he\ndetermined the government had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that a\nreasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts would not perceive\nthat the deck is unfairly stacked against the accused.116\n    Reviewing the military judge’s legal conclusion de novo, we also find the\ngovernment has rebutted, beyond a reasonable doubt, any notion that “an\nobjective, disinterested observer, fully informed of all the facts and\ncircumstances, would harbor a significant doubt about the fairness of the\nproceeding” against the appellant.

Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nintrusion into defense counsel spaces, the testimony and the video recording\nof the search of Capt S.L.’s office provide overwhelming evidence that any\nexposure to privileged information about the appellant’s case, if it occurred,\nwas momentary, at most. The CID agents who executed the search were\nwholly uninvolved with the appellant’s investigation and therefore would not\nhave recognized the significance of any information they might have\nglimpsed. The agents were subject to a gag order, prohibiting them from\ndiscussing what they might have seen with anyone. There is no evidence to\nsuggest any agent violated that gag order or that any privileged information\nabout the appellant’s defense reached the prosecution in his case. The\ngovernment has also dispelled, beyond a reasonable doubt, any suspicion that\nprosecutors directed, knew, or even anticipated that CID agents would gain\naccess to privileged files about the appellant.\n    Corrective measures we deemed adequate to prevent apparent UCI in\nBetancourt are more than adequate to protect against apparent UCI in this\ncase, where the appellant was subject to substantially less exposure. We find\nno apparent UCI in this case stemming from the brief search of Capt S.L.’s\noffice.\nE. Recusal of the military judge\n    The appellant avers that the military judge erred in refusing to recuse\nhimself based upon actual and/or apparent bias stemming from (1) UCI, (2) a\nconflict of interest with supervisory judges in his chain of command, and (3)\nhis independent investigation and ex parte communications.\n    We review a military judge’s decision not to recuse himself for an abuse of\ndiscretion.

Except as provided in subsection (e) of this rule,\n       a military judge shall disqualify himself or herself in any\n       proceeding in which that military judge’s impartiality might\n       reasonably be questioned.\n       (b) Specific grounds. A military judge shall also disqualify\n       himself or herself in the following circumstances:\n          (1) Where the military judge has a personal bias or\n       prejudice concerning a party . . . .\n                                  ....\n          (5) Where the military judge . . . :\n\n\n\n\n                                         55\n\f                    United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n                  (B) Is known by the military judge to have an interest,\n                 financial or otherwise, that could be substantially\n                 affected by the outcome of the proceeding . . . .\nAs with UCI, maintaining public confidence in the independence and\nimpartiality of military judges requires us to consider both actual bias and\nthe appearance of bias as possible bases for disqualification. See United\nStates v. Quintanilla, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 44-45 (C.A.A.F. 2001). “The first step asks\nwhether disqualification is required under the specific circumstances listed in\n[R.C.M.] 902(b). If the answer to that question is no, the second step asks\nwhether the circumstances nonetheless warrant disqualification based upon\na reasonable appearance of bias.” Id. at 45.\n   “There is a strong presumption that a judge is impartial, and a party\nseeking to demonstrate bias must overcome a high hurdle, particularly when\nthe alleged bias involves actions taken in conjunction with judicial\nproceedings.” Quintanilla, 56 M.J. at 44 (citation omitted). But “‘[a]ny\nconduct that would lead a reasonable man knowing all the circumstances to\nthe conclusion that the judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned is\na basis for the judge’s disqualification.’” Id. at 78 (quoting United States v.\nKincheloe, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 50 (CMA 1982) (additional citation and internal\nquotation marks omitted); see also R.C.M. 902(a).\n   The appellant filed a pretrial motion seeking recusal of the military judge\nand the entire Navy-Marine Corps Trial Judiciary.117 The military judge\ndenied the motion for recusal without making a written ruling. In the\nabsence of detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law on the record, we\nmust accord his ruling less deference. See Flesher, 73 M.J. at 312. With the\nexception of one subsequently mooted basis for judicial recusal, the appellant\nhas raised the same purported sources of judicial bias on appeal. We now\nparse those allegations for reasonable questions about the military judge’s\nimpartiality.\n   1. UCI\n   The appellant argues that SECNAV’s UCI and evidence of its effect on\nmembers of this court create and confirm an actual, or at least apparent, bias\nagainst the appellant in the military judge.\n    Our superior court has recognized that we test for apparent bias in\nviolation of R.C.M. 902(a) in essentially the same way we test for apparent\nUCI. See Lewis, 63 M.J. at 415. “We focus upon the perception of fairness in\nthe military justice system as viewed through the eyes of a reasonable\nmember of the public.” Id. Accordingly, the appellant reiterates his\n\n   117   AE C.\n\n\n                                        56\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\narguments for finding actual and apparent UCI—SECNAV’s 2009 comments\npoisoned the military justice system adjudicating the appellant, whether that\nadulteration manifested as UCI or apparent bias. Only the requested\nremedies are different. Instead of arguing for dismissal of the charges, the\nappellant challenges the military judge’s decision not to recuse himself.\n    In section C of this opinion, we exhaustively analyzed the appellant’s\nallegations of actual and apparent UCI. Having found no actual or apparent\nUCI impacting the appellate court or the military judge, we necessarily\nconclude that neither the military judge, nor the former appellate court\njudges who participated in Hutchins I or Hutchins III, labored under an\nactual or apparent bias born of SECNAV’s 2009 comments about this case.\n   2. Conflict of interest with the judicial chain of command\n    The appellant also asserts that the military judge suffered from a conflict\nof interest with supervisory judges in his chain of command.\n    R.C.M. 902(b)(5) targets a military judge’s conflicts of interest by\ndemanding disqualification when he or she “has a personal interest, financial\nor otherwise, that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the\nproceeding.” In this context, a personal interest is “extra-judicial” as opposed\nto judicial.

An example is when a supervisory judge\ndeviates from the UCMJ, regulations, and case precedent and affirmatively\nquestions a subordinate judge’s ruling. See Mabe, 33 M.J. at 205-06 (referring\nto a memorandum from a Chief of the Trial Judiciary to a military judge\nabout the subordinate judge’s sentences as a “military justice taboo” and\nconcurring that removal of the offending chief trial judge from the military\njudge’s chain of command restored the appellant’s right to a fair trial and the\nintegrity of the military justice system). The appellant offers no evidence of\nsupervisory intrusion on subordinate discretion in this case.\n    a. Conflict regarding SECNAV’s alleged UCI and former appellate judges\nin the chain of command\n    In support of their motion to recuse the military judge, the appellant\nconducted voir dire. First, TDC asked the military judge to detail his chain of\ncommand within the trial judiciary. The military judge identified Col M.R.,\nthe Circuit Judge of the Western Judicial District, as his immediate superior\nand confirmed Col M.R. would sign his next fitness report. Col M.R. reported\ndirectly to the Chief Trial Judge, who in turn reported to the Chief Judge of\nthe Department of the Navy. All of the military judges, as members of the\nDepartment of the Navy, were subordinate to SECNAV.\n   In response to the basis for the challenge—SECNAV’s 2009 comments\nabout this case—the military judge disavowed any memory of them prior to\nreading the appellant’s pleadings regarding UCI. Then he stated:\n       I profoundly and deeply don’t care what the Secretary of the\n       Navy thinks as far as this case goes. . . .\n\n\n\n                                       58\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n          As how it effects [sic] my career, a post-command senior O-6\n          who is retiring next summer, don’t care. Deeply, profoundly\n          don’t care. Deeply, profoundly don’t care what [the Chief Trial\n          Judge] or [the Chief Judge of the Department of the Navy]\n          would think about it as well.\n             They are professional colleagues and I think they would be\n          profoundly disappointed in me . . . if I took any action,\n          whatsoever, of speculating about what they might think. That\n          would be abdicating my role as a military judge, as an officer of\n          the Navy, and a member of the Judge Advocate General [sic]\n          Corps, and certainly of the California Bar.\n              . . . I just want to make it clear on the record that,\n          something that Secretary Mabus may have said in 2009 has\n          beyond no bearing on anything that I might do or might not do\n          in this case.119\n    To overcome the presumption against a conflict of interest in the military\njustice system and the military judge’s emphatic denial of any personal\ninterest susceptible to his rulings in this case, the appellant asserts that the\nmilitary judge had a personal interest in not embarrassing his supervisory\njudges with adverse findings about them. According to the appellant, the\nprospective damage to these senior judges’ reputations necessitated the\nmilitary judge’s recusal. See Norfleet, 53 M.J. at 271 (acknowledging “[t]here\nmay be cases in which the ruling by a military judge on an issue would have\nsuch a significant and lasting adverse direct impact on the professional\nreputation of a superior for competence and integrity that recusal should be\nconsidered.”).\n    Motions filed on behalf of the appellant solicited the military judge to\nmake findings about his chain of command. The Chief Trial Judge and the\nChief Judge of the Department of the Navy were both former members of this\ncourt and concurred in the majority opinions in Hutchins III and Hutchins I,\nrespectively. In his motion to dismiss for UCI, the appellant asked the\nmilitary judge “to make potentially adverse findings against the [Chief Judge\nof the Department of the Navy] and [the Chief Trial Judge] [.]”120 Specifically,\nthe military judge might have to determine that they “were unlawfully\ninfluenced by Secretary Mabus, and/or had made/adopted materially false\nstatements.”121 As previously discussed infra in section C, we do not impute\n\n\n   119   Record at 96.\n   120   Appellant’s Brief at 120.\n   121   Id.\n\n\n                                         59\n\f                       United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nmendacity to the Chief Judge of the Department of the Navy and the Chief\nTrial Judge from immaterial discrepancies in prior appellate opinions. Nor do\nwe fault the military judge for failing to do so.\n   b. Conflicts involving the military judge’s immediate supervisor\n    Col M.R., the military judge’s immediate supervisor, was the original\nmilitary judge in this case before recusing himself during pretrial motions.\nHe had a personal relationship with another senior Marine judge advocate\nlikely to testify as a witness in litigation of a motion. Nonetheless, the\nappellant argued that Col M.R. remained a witness to contested facts in this\ncase.122 First, in his position as the circuit judge, Col M.R. possessed\ninvestigative materials and notes relevant to the CID search of defense\ncounsel spaces in Betancourt, discussed, supra, in section D. Second, the\nappellant alleged that Col M.R., after learning of the appellant’s continued\ninstructor role at the Marksmanship Training Unit (MTU) aboard Camp\nPendleton, notified the senior Marine judge advocate with whom he had a\npersonal relationship. Shortly thereafter, that senior Marine judge advocate\nadvised his commander to remove the appellant from the MTU—a transfer\nthe appellant asserts violated Article 13, UCMJ.\n    According to the appellant’s motion for recusal, these allegations\nnecessitate the military judge’s recusal because (1) a trial judge’s interference\nin the duty assignment of an accused appearing before him “would cause\nsignificant damage to the public perception of the integrity of the military\njustice system”123 and must be fully vetted “through witness testimony at\nopen hearing.”124 But (2) that trial judge, Col M.R., could not testify if he\nmust appear before his subordinate military judge. So the subordinate\nmilitary judge must recuse himself. Like the military judge, we decline the\nappellant’s invitation to resolve these allegations. Once Col M.R. recused\nhimself from this court-martial, his own possible bias against the appellant\nbecame irrelevant. The court could and did adjudicate the CID search of\ndefense counsel spaces and the appellant’s Article 13, UCMJ, motion without\nfurther inquiring into Col M.R.’s possible involvement. Our review of these\ntwo issues, submitted to us as AOEs, confirms they were susceptible to\nresolution without the need to call Col M.R. to the stand.\n   A subordinate military judge should disqualify him or herself from ruling\non a credible allegation of impropriety by a supervisory judge. The desire to\nspare a superior such an ordeal does create an apparent, if not an actual,\n\n\n   122   AE C at 16.\n   123   Id. at 17.\n   124   Id.\n\n\n                                         60\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nconflict of interest. But a party cannot incite a conflict by raising unsupported\nand/or irrelevant allegations of judicial misconduct.\n   In this case, the appellant has not presented evidence of a credible\nextrajudicial threat to the military judge that overcomes the presumption\nthat his supervisors will follow the law. The prospect of a conflict of interest\nin presiding over this case remains far too speculative and remote to\nconstitute an actual or apparent conflict of interest necessitating recusal.\n   3. Independent investigation / ex parte communications\n   The appellant accuses the military judge of violating the judicial canon\nprohibiting ex parte communications and submits this violation as evidence of\nbias against the appellant necessitating his recusal.\n   In pursuit of the military judge’s recusal, the appellant levies a serious\ncharge against the military judge and at least three other current and former\nNavy judge advocates. Pursuant to instruction,125 the military judge’s conduct\nwas governed by the American Bar Association (ABA) Model Code of Judicial\nConduct. Canon 2.9 of the ABA Model Code governs ex parte communications:\n         (A) A judge shall not initiate, permit, or consider ex parte\n         communications, or consider other communications made to the\n         judge outside the presence of the parties or their lawyers,\n         concerning a pending or impending matter, except as follows:\n             (1) When circumstances require it, ex parte communication\n             for scheduling, administrative, or emergency purposes,\n             which does not address substantive matters, is permitted,\n             provided:\n                 (a) the judge reasonably believes that no party will gain\n                 a procedural, substantive, or tactical advantage as a\n                 result of the ex parte communication; and\n                 (b) the judge makes provision promptly to notify all\n                 other parties of the substance of the ex parte\n                 communication, and gives the parties an opportunity to\n                 respond.\nABA, Model Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 2.9: Ex Parte Communications\n(2011 ed.) (internal asterisks omitted). While the facts of the military judge’s\nalleged breach of this canon are necessary to our analysis of this AOE, we\nneed not determine whether he actually breached it. “[A]ctivity inconsistent\nwith standards of judicial conduct does not mandate recusal unless it rises to\nthe level of a violation of applicable disqualification standards.” Butcher, 56\n\n   125   Judge Advocate General’s Instruction 5803.1D at ¶ 7 (1 May 2012).\n\n\n                                          61\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nM.J. at 92 (citing R.C.M. 902). Thus we need only focus on whether the\nmilitary judge’s ex parte communications required his disqualification and\nrecusal.\n   When an allegation of ex parte communication forms part of a motion for\nrecusal,\n         [a] decision on disqualification will “depend on [1] the nature of\n         the communication; [2] the circumstances under which it was\n         made; [3] what the judge did as a result of the ex parte\n         communication; [4] whether it adversely affected a party who\n         has standing to complain; [5] whether the complaining party\n         may have consented to the communication being made ex\n         parte, and, if so, [6] whether the judge solicited such consent;\n         [7] whether the party who claims to have been adversely\n         affected by the ex parte communication objected in a timely\n         manner; and [8] whether the party seeking disqualification\n         properly preserved its objection.”\nQuintanilla, 56 M.J. at 44 (quoting RICHARD E. FLAMM, JUDICIAL\nDISQUALIFICATION § 14.3.1 at 411-12 (1996) (footnotes omitted)). Our\nanalysis will focus primarily on the first four of the eight factors above, as the\nlast four all inure to the appellant. For clarity, we will begin with factor 2,\nthe circumstances under which the communication was made, and then\nproceed to the nature of the communication, factor 1.\n   a. Circumstances under which communications were made\n   On 24 September 2014, the appellant’s trial defense counsel requested the\nCA approve and provide logistical support for a site visit to Iraq.126 Upon\ndenial of this request, the appellant filed a motion to compel a site visit. 127\nBoth the appellant and the government acknowledged that the appellant’s\nprevious trial defense team traveled to Iraq and briefly visited the alleged\ncrime scene in January 2007. In his written ruling denying the motion to\ncompel a site visit, the military judge noted that “the current Defense team\nhas access to the files from the former team which visited the situs—and may\nconsult with former counsel Lt.Col. [J.S.] who has been made available by his\nsupervisor.”128\n   Lieutenant Colonel (LtCol) J.S. was one of the appellant’s detailed\ndefense counsel at his first court-martial, and he traveled to Iraq with the\n\n\n   126   AE LXIX at 4, 12.\n   127   AE LXIX.\n   128   AE CXXV at 6.\n\n\n                                        62\n\f                       United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nappellant’s original civilian defense counsel in January 2007. By the time of\nthe second court-martial and the motion to compel, LtCol J.S. had\ntransitioned from active duty to the Marine Corps Reserve. He was an\nAssistant U.S. Attorney in his civilian capacity and a Reserve appellate\nmilitary judge on this court. LtCol J.S. was the subject of the ex parte\ncommunication.\n   The appellant’s current civilian defense counsel asked the military judge\nabout LtCol J.S.’s availability in a telephonic R.C.M. 802 conference on 25\nNovember 2014.129 The military judge explained that he contacted the Chief\nTrial Judge to inquire of this court whether LtCol J.S. could be made\navailable “to assist the defense based on his prior representation of Sgt\nHutchins.”130 He went on to confirm that he and the Chief Trial Judge\n“agreed to make sure LtCol [J.S.] is available to assist the defense.”131\n   b. Nature of the communications\n    Proceeding to the nature of the communication, it was a single telephone\ncall from the military judge to the Chief Trial Judge. On the record, the\nmilitary judge explained that he “contacted [the Chief Trial Judge] to ensure\n[the NMCCA] would be sure to wall [LtCol J.S.] off from any Hutchins\nmatters should the defense desire to consult with him on their own, (a); and\n(b), should the case reach that venue again.”132 LtCol J.S. later testified at an\nArticle 39, UCMJ, session about his knowledge of the ex parte\ncommunications. The then-Chief Judge of this appellate court called him\n“and indicated that there would be an order coming out on this case and that\nthe trial counsel had reached out to the Chief Judge of the [Department of\nthe] Navy . . . to confirm that [LtCol J.S.] could—the level of [LtCol J.S.’s]\nparticipation, and they had some sort of conversation.”133 LtCol J.S.\nunderstood that he was authorized to “provide information from [his]\nprevious representation” of the appellant.134 He summarized the scope of this\nauthority as follows: “So basically I can sort of dump every single bit of\ninformation that I have regarding the site visit . . . it’s a one-way flow of\n\n\n   129 AE C at 40. Details of that R.C.M. 802 conference come from an affidavit by\none of the appellant’s detailed defense counsel, who was also on the conference call.\nThe appellant submitted the affidavit in support of his motion for the military judge’s\nrecusal.\n   130   Id.\n   131   Id. at 41.\n   132   Record at 655.\n   133   Id. at 728.\n   134   Id.\n\n\n                                          63\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\ncommunication.” LtCol J.S. understood that the Chief Judge of the\nDepartment of the Navy was the source of this authority, and the then-Chief\nJudge of this appellate court conveyed it to LtCol J.S.\n   c. What the judge did as a result of the ex parte communication\n   Next we consider what the military judge did as a result of this ex parte\ncommunication. From his written ruling on the appellant’s motion to compel\na site visit, it appears the military judge communicated to the appellant’s\ncounsel that they could consult with LtCol J.S. regarding his 2007 site visit.\nIn his Findings of Fact, the military judge concluded that the appellant’s\n“previous Defense counsel were afforded a site visit to [Hamdaniyah] to\nsurvey the scene, conduct interviews, and investigate the circumstances\nsurrounding the event.”135 In a footnote to this finding, the military judge\nnoted that the appellant’s former civilian defense counsel was\n          unavailable for consultation due to the filing of an ineffective\n          assistance of counsel (IAC) claim after the first trial. However,\n          Lt.Col. [J.S.], a reserve judge at N.M.C.C.A., has been advised\n          by his supervisors that he may discuss the case with the\n          Defense and assist them in interpreting any of the information\n          in the file.136\nThe military judge also allowed LtCol J.S. to testify for the defense in support\nof their efforts to compel a subsequent site visit.\n    In his motion for recusal of the military judge and again on appeal, the\nappellant averred that the military judge’s ex parte communication resulted\nin him reaching three “opinions”:\n              (1) the ineffective assistance of counsel claim against LtCol\n          [J.S.] and the other members of the original trial defense team\n          does not give rise to a conflict of interest;\n              (2) the site visit conducted by LtCol [J.S.] was sufficient for\n          the defense to recover any desired evidence or witness\n          testimony; and\n              (3) LtCol [J.S.] was concurrently an appellate judge and,\n          without need to consult Sgt Hutchins, a participant in the\n          defense team; [sic] LtCol [J.S.] could actively assist the defense\n          interpretation of evidence and strategy discussions under the\n          protection of attorney-client privilege.137\n\n   135   AE CXXV at 3 (footnote omitted).\n   136   Id., n.5.\n   137   Appellant’s Brief at 123. See also AE C at 18.\n\n\n                                            64\n\f                       United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n     We address these alleged opinions in turn. First, the appellant alleges\nthat the military judge relied on the ex parte communication to resolve a\nconflict of interest that arguably prevented LtCol J.S. from assisting with the\nappellant’s defense team. During an Article 39(a), UCMJ, session to litigate\nthe appellant’s motion to compel a site visit, the appellant identified two\nconflicts of interest affecting LtCol J.S.: his position as a Reserve judge on\nthis court and the ineffective assistance of counsel claim that extinguished\nhis attorney-client relationship with the appellant.138 When asked about that\nineffective assistance claim, LtCol [J.S.] disputed suffering a conflict of\ninterest that prevented him from assisting the appellant’s new defense\ncounsel. He was able to “provide the information in a narrative sense”\nbecause the appellate issues for which attorney-client relationship was\nwaived were irrelevant to the site visit.139 The military judge did not\nexplicitly address LtCol J.S.’s purported conflict of interest on the record, so\nwe do not know the extent to which he considered the issue, if at all. We find\nno merit in the appellant’s claim that LtCol J.S. suffered from a conflict of\ninterest and thus find nothing to resolve. When our superior court set aside\nthe findings of the appellant’s first court-martial, his detailed defense\ncounsel’s effectiveness or lack thereof became moot. As LtCol J.S. commented\nin his testimony, his waiver of his attorney-client privilege in the course of\nlitigation about his effectiveness did not conflict with his ability to relay his\nsite visit experience to counsel. The military judge’s ex parte communications\ncould not impact a claim with no merit on its face.\n    Secondly, the appellant alleges that the military judge’s ex parte\nprocurement of LtCol J.S.’s assistance allowed him to conclude that the 2007\nsite visit was “sufficient for the defense to recover any desired evidence or\nwitness testimony[.]”140 As will be discussed below, in section H, the security\nsituation on the ground in and around Hamdaniyah made a site visit\nessentially impossible for any counsel in 2014 and 2015. Instead the military\njudge faced a more academic question about counsels’ equality of opportunity\nto obtain witnesses and other evidence in compliance with Article 46, UCMJ.\nLtCol J.S.’s availability to the appellant’s defense team was a factor in\nevaluating the appellant’s opportunity and access to evidence. But the\nappellant was never entitled to “recover[y of] any desired evidence or witness\ntestimony,” nor did the military judge ever reach that conclusion.\n   Third and finally, the appellant alleges that he was excluded from the\ndecision to include LtCol J.S. in his defense team’s “interpretation of evidence\n\n   138   Record at 498.\n   139   Id. at 742.\n   140   Appellant’s Brief at 123.\n\n\n                                         65\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nand strategy discussions under the protection of attorney-client privilege.”141\nSuch a characterization overstates LtCol J.S.’s authorized role in the\nappellant’s second defense. Once the appellant’s first court-martial was\nforwarded for appellate review, LtCol J.S.’s attorney-client relationship with\nthe appellant ended.142 LtCol J.S. testified to clear guidance from the then-\nChief Judge of this court that he “cannot get involved in tactical decisions,\nstrategic decisions, in giving [the appellant’s defense team] theories of\ndefense . . . .”143 His disclosures to the new defense team were a “one-way\nstreet” in which both he and the new counsel were obligated to protect\nattorney-work product from their respective representations of the\nappellant.144\n   Thus we decline to find that the military judge’s ex parte communications\nspawned any of these “opinions.”\n   d. Whether the communications adversely affected a party who has\n      standing to complain\n    Turning to the fourth Quintanilla factor, we consider any adverse effect of\nthe ex parte communication on the appellant. Beyond the three purported\nopinions, the appellant alleges that the “‘availability’ of LtCol [J.S.] was a key\nbasis for the military judge’s denial of the defense request for a site visit.”145\nAllegedly, this amounted to apparent bias against the appellant in that “as a\nmatter of public perception, the appearance is that the military judge’s\nindependent investigation and ex parte communications were made for the\nexpress purpose of gathering evidence to support a denial of the defense\nmotion.”146\n   But the facts again rebut the appellant’s characterization. “[A] reasonable\nman knowing all the circumstances” would not reasonably question the\njudge’s impartiality. Quintanilla, 56 M.J. at 78. As will be explained in\ngreater detail below in section H., the security situation in and around\nHamdaniyah, not LtCol J.S.’s availability, precluded a site visit. Even if the\nmilitary judge had ordered a site visit, witness testimony cast significant\ndoubt on its enforceability. The military judge’s ex parte communication\nserved no other purpose than to facilitate the trial defense team’s access to a\n\n\n   141   Id.\n   142   Record at 742.\n   143   Id.\n   144   Id. at 729-30, 742.\n   145   Appellant’s Brief at 124 (citation omitted).\n   146   Id.\n\n\n                                             66\n\f                    United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nMarine judge advocate who traveled to Hamdaniyah on the appellant’s behalf\nin 2007 and was still within the court’s jurisdiction. But by procuring LtCol\nJ.S.’s assistance, the military judge helped restore the balance required by\nArticle 46, UCMJ, and thus mitigated concerns raised by the appellant’s\nsubsequent Motion to Dismiss for Denial of Site Visit, or Alternatively, to\nAbate Proceedings Until Such Time As a Site Visit Can be Conducted, which\ndepended on a violation of Article 46, UCMJ.147\n    Analyzing the eight Quintanilla factors— (1) the nature of the military\njudge’s ex parte communication, (2) the circumstances surrounding it, (3) its\nconsequences, (4) the adverse effect on the appellant, and (5-8) the\nappellant’s timely objection and preservation of the issue at trial—we detect\nnot a bias against the appellant but an effort to remove obstacles to his access\nto evidence.\n   A reasonable person aware of the military judge’s ex parte\ncommunications, their effect, the appellant’s rationale for challenging those\ncommunications, and the subsequent production of LtCol J.S. would find no\ncause to question the military judge’s impartiality. Thus there is no need for\ndisqualification.\n   Even in light of the military judge’s brief and entirely verbal bases for his\ndecisions not to recuse himself from this case, and the resulting diminution of\nour deference to his judgment, we still find no abuse of discretion.\nF. Abatement for severance of attorney-client relationship\n   The appellant claims the military judge erred when he refused to abate\nthe proceedings until the appellant’s attorney-client relationship with his\nappellate defense attorney, Maj S.B.K., was restored. The military judge also\ndeclined to order Maj S.B.K’s appointment as the appellant’s individual\nmilitary counsel (IMC).\n    “A military judge’s failure to abate proceedings is reviewed for an abuse of\ndiscretion.” United States v.

IMC\n    Pursuant to Article 38(b), UCMJ, an accused has the right to be\nrepresented at court-martial “by military counsel of his own selection if that\ncounsel is reasonably available[.]” Art. 38(b)(3)(B), UCMJ. If reasonably\navailable, that military counsel may be appointed to the accused’s trial\ndefense team as an IMC. Reasonable availability is defined by the service\nsecretary but excludes persons serving, inter alia, as trial counsel or\nappellate defense counsel. Art. 38(b)(7), UCMJ; R.C.M. 506(b)(1)(C)-(D). The\nManual of the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, or JAGMAN, implements\nArticle 38(b)(3)(B), UCMJ, and R.C.M. 506 with regard to counsel in the Navy\nand Marine Corps.148 First, counsel must be on active duty to be reasonably\navailable.149 Then a list of disqualifying criteria significantly limits the pool of\navailable counsel.150 Those disqualifying criteria include, inter alia,\nperformance of duties as trial counsel or appellate defense counsel and\npermanent assignment to a command outside the Trial Judicial Circuit\nwhere the court-martial will be held or beyond 500 miles from the site of the\ncourt-martial.151\n   The military judge found—and the record supports—that Maj S.B.K. was\ndetailed as the appellant’s appellate defense counsel, pursuant to Article 70,\nUCMJ, in May 2008.152 In preparation for his second court-martial, the\nappellant filed his IMC request for Maj S.B.K. on 8 August 2014.153 By then,\nMaj S.B.K. was assigned to a trial counsel billet more than 500 miles from\nCamp Pendleton, the site of the appellant’s court-martial. For these reasons,\nMaj S.B.K.’s chain of command denied the request on 11 September 2014.\nThe appellant appealed, but his appeal was denied on 24 September 2014.\nMaj S.B.K. had left active duty the previous day and transferred to the\nIndividual Ready Reserve.\n   Citing R.C.M. 506(b) and the list of assignments that disqualify counsel\nfrom serving as IMC per se, the military judge concluded that Maj S.B.K. was\n\n\n   148   Judge Advocate General Instruction 5800.7F (JAGMAN) § 0131 (26 Jun 2012).\n   149   Id. at § 0131b.(4).\n   150   Id.\n   151   Id. at § 0131b.(4)(b), (d)(1).\n   152Appellee’s Response to Court’s Order to Produce of 16 Nov 2017, Ruling on\nDefense Motion re: IMC Request for Maj S.B.K. of 5 May 2015 at 2; AE CXI at 2.\n   153   AE CXI at 8.\n\n\n                                          68\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n“per se not reasonably available while serving as a trial counsel and then\nagain when he left active duty shortly thereafter.”154\n   2. Existing attorney-client relationship\n    Despite Maj S.B.K.’s nonavailability, the appellant asserted his attorney-\nclient relationship with Maj S.B.K. and argued denial of the IMC request\nwould sever that preexisting relationship. R.C.M. 506 provides for exceptions\nto availability requirements “when merited by the existence of an attorney-\nclient relationship regarding matters relating to a charge in question.”\nR.C.M. 506(b)(1). But the exceptions do not apply “if the attorney-client\nrelationship arose solely because the counsel represented the accused on\nreview under Article 70[.]” R.C.M. 506(b)(1).\n   Article 70, UCMJ, governs the detail of appellate counsel. Specifically, the\nJAG shall appoint “[a]ppellate defense counsel [who] shall represent the\naccused before the Court of Criminal Appeals, the Court of Appeals for the\nArmed Forces, or the Supreme Court[.]” Art. 70(c), UCMJ. The authority\ngoverning detail of appellate counsel is separate and distinct from Article 27,\nUCMJ,155 which mandates the detail of trial counsel and defense counsel “for\neach general and special court-martial.” Art. 27(a)(1), UCMJ.\n    The distinction between representation at courts-martial arising under\nArticle 27, UCMJ, and representation on appeal arising under Article 70,\nUCMJ, appears in the JAGMAN’s relevant definition of an attorney-client\nrelationship. “For purposes of this section [0131 Standards for Determining\nAvailability of Requested Individual Military Counsel], an attorney-client\nrelationship exists between the accused and requested counsel when counsel\nand the accused have had a privileged conversation relating to a charge\npending before the proceeding, and counsel has engaged in active pretrial\npreparation and strategy with regard to that charge.”156 Among the “[a]ctions\n\n   154Appellee’s Response to Court’s Order to Produce of 16 Nov 2017, Ruling on\nDefense Motion re: IMC Request for Maj S.B.K. of 5 May 2015 at 8.\n   155  Article 70, UCMJ, does require that appellate counsel be qualified under\nArticle 27(b)(1), UCMJ. Qualifications detailed at Article 27(b)(1), UCMJ, include\nbeing a judge advocate, graduation from an accredited law school, membership in a\nfederal or state bar, and certification as competent to perform duties as trial or\ndefense counsel by the Judge Advocate General.\n   156  JAGMAN § 0131b(3) (emphasis added). The JAGMAN definition of attorney-\nclient relationship continues:\n             Actions by counsel deemed to constitute active pretrial\n         preparation and strategy which materially limit the range of options\n         available to the accused include but are not limited to: advising the\n         accused to waive or assert a legal right . . .; representing the accused\n         at a pretrial investigation under Article 32, UCMJ . . . ; submitting\n\n\n                                           69\n\f                       United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nthat, in and of themselves, will not be deemed to constitute ‘active pretrial\npreparation and strategy’” is “representing the accused in appellate review\nproceedings under Article 70, UCMJ[.]”157 Finally, the JAGMAN references\nthe JAGINST 5803.1 series158 “prohibiting a counsel from establishing an\nattorney-client relationship until properly detailed, assigned, or otherwise\nauthorized.” Id. at § 0131b.(3).\n   The military judge concluded that the appellant “provided no evidence to\nsuggest that Maj. [S.B.K.] engaged in active pretrial preparation and strategy\nwith regard to the charges now before the trial court—or that he was\nauthorized to do so under JAGINST 5803.1E.”159 In detailed Findings of Fact,\nthe military judge described Maj S.B.K.’s representation of the appellant:\n           zealous advocacy through the overturn of the accused’s\n           conviction by CAAF on 26 June 2013 including representation\n           at NMCCA, CAAF, a 2009 Dubay [sic] hearing, a 2010 IRO\n           hearing, and at the Naval Clemency and Parole Board, among\n           other actions. [Maj S.B.K.] continued to provide appellate\n           advocacy for Sgt Hutchins subsequent to the re-referral of\n           charges on 6 January 2014, co-signing a Writ of Mandamus on\n           behalf of Sgt. Hutchins in May 2014.160\nWhile the record does not explicitly corroborate each of these acts on behalf of\nthe appellant, there is also no indication they are clearly erroneous. It is also\nunclear the circumstances under which Maj S.B.K. represented the appellant\nat the 2009 DuBay hearing or the 2010 Initial Review Officer (IRO) hearing\nand whether he was formally detailed to do so. TDC, not appellate counsel,\ntypically provide representation at those types of hearings. But those\nhearings are not typically associated with active pretrial preparation and\nstrategy. Finally, Article 70, UCMJ, was the authority for Maj S.B.K.’s\nrepresentation of the appellant, and the scope of that representation was\n\n           evidence for testing or analysis; . . . offering a pretrial agreement on\n           behalf of the accused; submitting a request for an administrative\n           discharge in lieu of trial on behalf of the accused; or interviewing\n           witnesses relative to any charge pending before the proceeding.\nId. at § 0131b.(3)(a).\n    157   Id. at § 0131b.(3)(b) (emphasis added).\n   158 JAGINST 5803.1 series governs “Professional Conduct of Attorneys Practicing\n\nUnder the Cognizance and Supervision of the Judge Advocate General” including\nMarine Corps judge advocates, active duty and Reserve.\n      Appellee’s Response to Court’s Order to Produce of 16 Nov 2017, Ruling on\n    159\n\nDefense Motion re: IMC Request for Maj S.B.K. of 5 May 2015 at 8.\n    160   Id. at 2.\n\n\n                                             70\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nappellate review and other post-trial matters arising after the release of the\nappellant’s original trial defense counsel.\n    The military judge relied on the distinctions between trial and appellate\nadvocacy in ruling that the appellant had not demonstrated the kind of\nattorney-client relationship with Maj S.B.K. that required restoration at the\ntrial level. The military judge cited United States v. Kelker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 325\n(C.M.A. 1978), in support of the “separability of the trial and appellate\nfunctions.” As in the case before us, Private Kelker requested assignment of\nhis appellate defense counsel to his trial defense team for his second court-\nmartial. Id. at 323-24. Our superior court held that attorney-client\nrelationships formed pursuant to Article 70, UCMJ, for appellate\nrepresentation do not extend to the trial level, even for a rehearing of the\nsame case. Id. at 325.\n    Citing Spriggs, supra, extensively, the military judge focused on what\ntriggers the kind of attorney-client relationship that cannot be severed and\nthus compels appointment as an IMC. Establishing such a relationship\nrequires demonstrating “‘both a bilateral understanding as to the nature of\nfuture representation and active engagement by the attorney in the\npreparation and pretrial strategy of the case.’”161 Although absent from the\nmilitary judge’s ruling, the JAGMAN explicitly precludes IMC approval\nauthorities from considering appellate representation as pretrial preparation\nand strategy.162\n   The appellant cites United States v. Morgan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">631</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 635 (N-M. Ct.\nCrim. App. 2006), for the proposition that the attorney-client relationship\nwith appellate defense counsel continues “through remands and retrials,\nunless properly excused by the client or other competent authority.”163 For\nthat reason, we disagree with the military judge’s implication that Maj\nS.B.K’s representation of the appellant was complete. In fact, Maj S.B.K.\ncontinues to represent the appellant before this court. But that relationship,\nformed under the authority of Article 70, UCMJ, is still limited to\nrepresentation before appellate authorities. Despite Maj S.B.K.’s\nrepresentation of the appellant at a DuBay hearing and an IRO hearing—\nrepresentation normally provided by trial defense counsel—there is no\nevidence the statutory authority for the representation changed. Nor did the\n\n   161   Id. at 6 (quoting Spriggs, 52 M.J.at 241).\n   162   JAGMAN at § 0131b.(3)(b).\n   163 Appellant’s Brief at 130 (citing Morgan, 62 M.J. at 635 (noting that “appellate\ncounsel . . . join the appellant’s growing defense team.

Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nmilitary judge clearly err in finding no evidence that Maj. S.B.K. was\nengaged in active pretrial preparation and strategy.\n    Finding no clearly erroneous findings of fact and no error in the military\njudge’s legal conclusion that the appellant and Maj S.B.K. did not share the\nkind of attorney-client relationship that demands assignment as an IMC, we\naffirm the military judge’s decision not to order Maj S.B.K.’s assignment to\nthe trial defense team. We also find no abuse of discretion in the military\njudge’s denial of the appellant’s request to abate the proceedings.\nG. Pretrial punishment in violation of Article 13, UCMJ\n   The appellant contends that the government violated the Article 13,\nUCMJ, prohibition against unlawful pretrial punishment when it subjected\nhim to unduly harsh pretrial confinement in Iraq and at Camp Pendleton,\nreassigned him from a MTU to an administrative billet, and withheld a\nNavy-Marine Corps Achievement Medal (NAM) from him.\n    “The burden is on appellant to establish entitlement to additional\nsentence credit because of a violation of Article 13[, UCMJ].” United States v.\nMosby, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">309</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 310 (C.A.A.F. 2002) (citing R.C.M. 905(c)(2)). Whether an\nappellant is entitled to relief for a violation of Article 13, UCMJ, is a mixed\nquestion of law and fact. Id. (citing United States v.

Fischer, the CAAF interpreted Article 13,\nUCMJ, to prohibit “(1) the intentional imposition of punishment on an\naccused prior to trial, i.e., illegal pretrial punishment; and (2) pretrial\nconfinement conditions that are more rigorous than necessary to ensure the\naccused’s presence at trial[.]” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 418 (C.A.A.F. 2005) (citing United\nStates v.

The military judge correctly placed the burden of demonstrating\nviolation of Article 13, UCMJ, on the appellant. R.C.M. 905(c)(2); see also\nMosby, 56 M.J. at 310.\n   1. Pretrial restriction in Iraq\n    From 11 to 23 May 2006, the appellant was “placed in pretrial restriction\nand housed in a climate-controlled Containerized Housing Unit (CHU) with\nan escort” in Iraq.166 There has been no dispute that this restriction was\ntantamount to confinement, and the appellant received day-for-day\nconfinement credit for this restriction.167 The Results of Trial from the first\ncourt-martial did not indicate clearly how pretrial confinement credit was\ncalculated, but the record reflects that the appellant received at least one day\nof pretrial confinement credit for each day spent restricted to the CHU in\nIraq.168\n    This period was also the focus of the CAAF’s opinion in Hutchins, IV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. The government’s failure to facilitate the appellant’s access to an\nattorney, despite his request for counsel upon his initial Article 31(b) rights\nnotification, contributed significantly to the CAAF’s suppression of his\nstatements to NCIS, reversal of his initial convictions, and his new trial. Id.\nat 296-300.\n\n\n\n\n   164   AE LXV at 1.\n   165   AE LXXXVII.\n   166   Id. at 2.\n   167  Id. at 6. The military judge attributed the credit to United States v. Allen, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (C.M.A. 1984). Allen entitles an accused to day-to-day sentence credit for\npretrial confinement, but, with one exception, the military judge referred to the\nperiod for which the appellant received the credit as “pre-trial restraint” and\n“restriction.” Id.\n   168   AE LXVI at 120; Record at 629.\n\n\n                                          73\n\f                    United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n    At his second court-martial, the appellant moved for additional remedies\nfor the command’s failure to comply with R.C.M. 305 and his “unduly harsh\npre-trial confinement conditions”169 in Iraq.\n    R.C.M. 305 prescribes requirements and rules to ensure pretrial\nconfinement is not unduly rigorous or otherwise in breach of Article 13,\nUCMJ.170 R.C.M. 305(j)(2) directs military judges to order administrative\ncredit under R.C.M. 305(k) “for any pretrial confinement served as a result of\nan abuse of discretion or failure to comply with” the provisions affording\nmembers command documentation of probable cause for confinement,\nindependent review of probable cause, and access to military counsel. R.C.M.\n305(k) credit ordered for noncompliance “is to be applied in addition to any\nother credit the accused may be entitled as a result of pretrial confinement\nserved.” R.C.M. 305(k). But the military judge declined to award R.C.M.\n305(k) or Article 13, UCMJ, credit for the appellant’s restriction in Iraq\nbecause “the law does not twice rebuke the Government for an after-the-fact\nreclassification of restraint absent evidence of other unusually harsh\ncircumstances not present here.”171\n    Our superior court has held that “R.C.M. 305 applies to restriction\ntantamount to confinement only when the conditions and constraints of that\nrestriction constitute physical restraint, the essential characteristics of\nconfinement.” United States v. Rendon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 224 (C.A.A.F. 2003).\nWhile restriction tantamount to confinement may entitle an accused to day-\nfor-day confinement credit under Allen, supra, or United States v. Mason, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (C.M.A. 1985), the accused is not entitled to double that\nconfinement credit under R.C.M. 305(k). Rendon, 58 M.J. at 224. We see no\nevidence in the record leading us to disturb the military judge’s implicit\nfinding that the appellant’s period of restriction did not include physical\nrestraint and thus did not amount to confinement. Despite the isolated\n\n\n   169   AE LXV at 1.\n   170  Pretrial confinement requires probable cause, meaning “a reasonable belief\nthat: (1) [a]n offense triable by court-martial has been committed; (2)[t]he person\nconfined committed it; and (3) [c]onfinement is required by the circumstances.”\nR.C.M. 305(d). Continued confinement requires a documented probable cause\ndetermination made by the commander not more than 72 hours after learning a\nmember is in confinement. R.C.M. 305(h)(2)(A). A neutral and detached officer shall\nreview the probable cause determination within seven days of the imposition of\nconfinement and memorialize his or her factual findings and conclusions. R.C.M.\n305(i)(2). At the request of the prisoner, military counsel shall be provided before the\n72-hour probable cause determination or the seven-day review, whichever occurs\nfirst. R.C.M. 305(f).\n   171   AE LXXXVII at 7.\n\n\n                                          74\n\f                    United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nnature of the appellant’s restriction, the unique circumstances of restriction\nin a war zone, and our superior court’s characterizations of the period in\nHutchins, IV, 72 M.J. at 296-97, the appellant has inexplicably offered no\nevidence of physical restraint. Therefore, we affirm the military judge’s\ndecision not to apply R.C.M. 305(k) credit.\n    Regarding the punitive nature of the restraint and violation of Article 13,\nUCMJ, the military judge found that the appellant had not provided the\nnecessary evidence to demonstrate that “this confinement was either illegal\nor punitive in nature.”172 R.C.M. 304(f) prohibits punitive pretrial restraint\nsuch as “punitive duty hours or training, . . . punitive labor, or . . . special\nuniforms prescribed only for post-trial prisoners.” The appellant alleged none\nof these but argued only that his solitary confinement in Iraq deprived him of\n“the ability to communicate with anyone else, including his family or\nfriends.”173 The government countered by asserting there was\ncontemporaneous probable cause to believe that the appellant and his squad\nmembers conspired to commit murder—and committed it—and thus it was\nnecessary to segregate them to prevent further obstruction of justice.174\n    The military judge concluded that “[g]iven the nature of the charged\noffenses and the proximity of the command in the midst of a war zone in a\nforeign country, solitary restriction to a CHU was not beyond the pale.”175\nOur review of the record does not contradict this finding as to the nature of\nthe restriction. The military judge correctly cited Mosby in support of his\nlegal conclusions. 56 M.J. at 310 (denying additional sentence credit for an\nArticle 13, UCMJ, violation when “[o]ther than introducing evidence that\nappellant was placed in solitary confinement based on the charge alone,\nappellant has not introduced any evidence of an intent to punish.”) Based on\nthis record, we conclude that the military judge’s findings are not clearly\nerroneous and that the circumstances of the restriction were not punitive. We\naffirm the military judge’s decision not to award additional credit or other\nremedies pursuant to Article 13, UCMJ.\n   2. Pretrial confinement at Camp Pendleton\n   The appellant was redeployed from Iraq to Camp Pendleton and began a\nperiod of pretrial confinement from 24 May 2006 to 3 August 2007. As in\nIraq, he argues his “extreme confinement conditions” were punitive.176\n\n   172   Id.\n   173   AE LXV at 5.\n   174   AE LXVI at 1.\n   175   AE LXXXVII at 7.\n   176   AE LXV at 7.\n\n\n                                      75\n\f                       United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n   Specifically, the appellant alleges he was held in “a sound-proof, solitary-\nconfinement cell for ten out of the fifteen months” of pretrial confinement and\n“was shackled every time he left his cell.”177 He argues the conditions of his\npretrial confinement were not necessary and were intended “to exact\npunishment, harassment, and abuse[.]”178\n    The military judge made the following findings of fact regarding the\nappellant’s pretrial confinement at Camp Pendleton. The appellant’s custody\nclassification on 24 May 2006 was “‘maximum’” based on “the nature of the\nallegations against him and an assessment of other factors.”179 The command\ncomplied with R.C.M. 305 by providing the appellant a pretrial confinement\nadvice letter on 25 May 2006 and conducting a status review with an IRO on\n26 May 2006. The IRO’s “comments clearly indicate his view that continued\npretrial confinement was appropriate.”180 About three weeks later, brig\nofficials cited the appellant’s “‘entirely appropriate’” behavior in downgrading\nhis custody classification and increasing his privileges.181 The military judge\nnoted that the appellant’s claim that he was placed in Maximum-[Potentially\nViolent and Dangerous] status for 150 days was “expressly contradicted by\nevidence of brig records revealing a downgrade from MAX (maximum) to MDI\n(medium) after 23 days.”182 Because of “the nature of his charges and\nconcerns about problems in the brig general population” and ease of access to\nfrequent family and legal visitors, the appellant remained in Special\nQuarters housing.183 The military judge noted that on or about 5 October\n2006, the appellant complained to the brig officer about problems he had\nencountered with other inmates on the general population mess decks.\nExtensive documentation from the Camp Pendleton Base Brig corroborates\nthe military judge’s findings.\n   Detailing administrative and safety reasons for the conditions of the\nappellant’s custody, the military judge concluded that the “Defense has not\nmet its burden to show that the conditions of pretrial confinement at the\nCamp Pendleton Base Brig were more rigorous than necessary to ensure the\naccused’s presence at trial.”184 The military judge found that the high profile\n\n   177   Appellant’s Brief at 136 (citation omitted).\n   178   Id. at 137.\n   179   AE LXXXVII at 2.\n   180   Id.\n   181   Id.\n   182   Id. at 8, n.14.\n   183   Id. at 2-3.\n   184   Id. at 7.\n\n\n                                             76\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nof the appellant’s case, the number of alleged co-conspirators, and concerns\nabout the appellant’s presence in the general population were safety concerns\nthat amounted to legitimate administrative purposes for continued\nconfinement in Special Quarters housing. He cited Smith, 53 M.J. at 173, in\nwhich the CAAF affirmed a military judge’s determination that (1) “the\nGovernment had not restricted the appellant with an intent to punish prior\nto trial” and (2) “that there were legitimate nonpunitive governmental\nobjectives served by the restrictions placed on appellant and that, therefore,\nArticle 13 was not violated[.]” Id. at 169.\n    Although the Smith court analyzed pretrial restriction, not confinement,\nid. at 170, our superior court has repeatedly applied the same test to pretrial\nconfinement. In United States v.

In light of confinement officials’ responsibility to\nensure a detainee’s presence for trial and the security of the facility, the\nburden was on Crawford to demonstrate that the conditions of his\nconfinement were “unreasonable or arbitrary[.]” Id. at 414. See also\nMcCarthy, 47 M.J. at 167 (holding, in the context of maximum custody\nconfinement, that “[i]f the conditions of pretrial restraint are ‘reasonably\nrelated to a legitimate governmental objective, it does not, without more,\namount to punishment.’”) (quoting James, 28 M.J. at 216) (additional\ncitations omitted).\n    The military judge implied that solitary confinement and shackles were\n“‘discomforting’ administrative measures reasonably related to the effective\nmanagement of the confinement facility” and “‘de minimus’ impositions” and\ntherefore not punitive.185 However, United States v.

We\ndo not equate solitary confinement and shackles with embarrassment.\nHowever, we concur with the military judge that the appellant has failed to\nprovide evidence his confinement was unduly rigorous. Unlike in King, 61\nM.J. at 225, the appellant has not demonstrated that any conditions of his\nconfinement were “an arbitrary response to the physical limitations” of the\nfacility. Id. at 228.

Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n    Finding no clear error in the military judge’s conclusions that the\nappellant’s confinement conditions stemmed from legitimate purposes, and,\nimpliedly, not punitive intent, we concur there was no Article 13, UCMJ,\nviolation during his pretrial confinement.\n   3. Transfer from the MTU\n    The appellant alleges that his reassignment from a marksmanship\ninstructor position to an administrative billet was arbitrary and the result of\npunitive intent.\n    While his first court-martial progressed through appellate review, the\nappellant was in and out of post-trial confinement. After this court set aside\nhis convictions in Hutchins I, 68 M.J. at 631, the appellant was released from\nconfinement and returned to duty at Camp Pendleton in June 2010. He was\nassigned as an instructor at the Battalion Headquarters MTU. In January\n2011, the CAAF reversed Hutchins I and remanded the case for review.\nHutchins II, 69 M.J. at 293. The next month, the appellant was returned to\nconfinement. In June 2013, the CAAF set aside the appellant’s convictions,\nHutchins IV, 72 M.J. at 300. He was released from confinement again and\nreturned to Camp Pendleton the next month. He served again as an MTU\ninstructor.\n    At some point after the appellant’s return to Camp Pendleton in July\n2013, his assignment as an MTU instructor came to the attention of Col M.,\nthe Officer in Charge of the Camp Pendleton LSSS. Col M. contacted the\nappellant’s commanding officer, Col Co., and “relayed his concern about the\n‘optics’ of a Marine working on a rifle range who stood accused of killing a\ncivilian with a rifle.”186 Sometime thereafter, Col Co. transferred the\nappellant from the MTU to the S4 Logistics Division, which had repeatedly\nfailed inspections. “Col [Co.] testified that Col [M.]’s call affected the timing of\nthis move, but given the [appellant’s] outstanding performance and the\nperpetual failings of S4, he ‘probably’ would have moved Sgt. Hutchins there\nat some point to shore up the division.”187 He did not consider the\nreassignment to be punitive and believed the S4 billet was rated one or two\npaygrades above the appellant’s paygrade of E-5.\n   When Col Co. retired in July 2014, Col Cr. relieved him as the appellant’s\ncommanding officer. A month later, the appellant was reassigned to the\nMTU. Conflicting evidence was presented as to Col Cr.’s awareness of the\nchange, and the military judge refrained from making findings of fact on the\nmatter. Col M. contacted Col Cr. to express his continuing concerns about the\n\n\n   186   Id. at 4.\n   187   Id. at 4, n.9.\n\n\n                                            78\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n“‘optics’” of the assignment, and the appellant was returned to S4.188 “Col\n[Cr.] disavowed an ulterior motive for the transfer and praised Sgt. Hutchins’\nwork.”189 He rated the pay grade of the S4 billet as higher than E-5 and\npossibly as high as a junior officer.\n   Substantial testimony from the colonels and members of their staff\nsupports these findings of fact from the military judge.\n    Again, the military judge found that the appellant had not met his burden\nto show that his reassignment from MTU to S4 was punitive. He applied the\ntwo-part Smith test again. 53 M.J. at 169, 72-73. The military judge found no\nevidence that assignment to S4 was considered punitive, and he held that\nassignment outside of one’s military occupational specialty was not, “ipso\nfacto,” punitive.190 He questioned the propriety of the LSSS Officer in Charge\nintervening in the appellant’s duties but detected “no evidence of either\nimproper motive or an improper result.”191\n    We find no reason to question the military judge’s findings and ultimate\nconclusion as to the appellant’s reassignment from MTU to S4. The appellant\nurges us to infer punitive intent from the “chief prosecutor’s” intervention,\ninconclusive evidence as to why the appellant was briefly returned to the\nMTU, and his assertion that there was no legitimate reason for him to leave\nthe MTU. This is not evidence of punitive intent, nor does it successfully\nrebut the nonpunitive reasons the colonels cited for their advice and\ndecisions.\n   4. Withdrawal of nomination for a NAM\n    Finally, the appellant avers that a prosecutor, acting with punitive intent,\ndissuaded the appellant’s commanding officer from awarding him a proposed\nimpact award and thus punished him.\n    The military judge found that the appellant made an immediate, positive\nimpact at both MTU and S4 and that praise for his performance was both\nuniversal and effusive. Col Co. remembered reviewing a recommendation\nthat the appellant receive a NAM as an impact award for his tenure at MTU.\nBut Col Co. demurred in favor of a letter of continuity because the appellant\nhad been on board less than a year. Col Co. also advocated for the appellant\nto receive a Combat Action Ribbon.\n\n\n\n   188   Id. at 5.\n   189   Id.\n   190   Id. at 9.\n   191   Id.\n\n\n                                       79\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n    The appellant asserts that Col Co. withheld his NAM because a\nprosecutor, Maj S., warned it “would not ‘look good’ given that he was\ncharged with murder.”192 As support, the appellant cited a deposition of the\nBattalion Operations Officer, Maj B., who nominated the appellant for the\naward. Maj B did not testify before the military judge, but a transcript of his\ndeposition was attached to the appellant’s motion. According to the deposition\ntranscript, Maj B. remembered being present for a telephone call between Col\nCo. and Maj S. during which Maj S. balked at awarding a NAM to someone\ncharged with murder because it wouldn’t look good. Col Co. then decided to\nleave the appellant’s proposed NAM citation in the awards system and “‘wait\nuntil everything clears up.’”193 He expected similar recognition for the\nappellant from S4 and, according to Maj B., said, “‘[j]ust hold off to all his\nrecognitions. He’s not denied but he’s not approved.’”194 Col Co. testified that\nhe frequently consulted with Maj S. on other cases but did not remember\ndiscussing the appellant with him.\n    While there is some disagreement between Col Co. and Maj B., it does not\nprompt us to disregard the military judge’s findings of fact as clearly\nerroneous. Maj S.’s concerns about the appearance of awarding a murder\nsuspect a NAM are consistent with Col M.’s concerns about the optics of\nassigning a murder suspect to train Marines in marksmanship. Col Co.\ntestified, “I think you should write [the appellant] up for a letter of continuity\nbecause we can’t have a Marine getting three awards to reach a senior’s ears,\njust because we moved him around.”195 This does not directly contradict Maj\nB.’s memory of Col Co. deciding to hold the appellant’s recognitions from\nMTU, S4, and others until his court-martial.\n   The military judge again found that the defense had not met its burden to\nshow that Col Co.’s decision not to approve the appellant’s NAM was\npunitive. He cited Col Co.’s testimony that a NAM for less than a year of\nperformance was premature. While he did not explicitly cite the Smith test in\nthe context of this alleged punishment, he concluded there was no evidence of\npunishment to overcome the evidence that a legitimate, alternative purpose\nmotivated the decision not to award the NAM to the appellant.\n    None of the military judge’s findings as to the lack of punitive intent and\nthe existence of legitimate, nonpunitive reasons regarding the appellant’s\nrestriction in Iraq, pretrial confinement at Camp Pendleton, reassignment\n\n\n   192   Appellant’s Brief at 143.\n   193   AE LXV at 90.\n   194   Id.\n   195   Record at 612.\n\n\n                                        80\n\f                    United States v.

Thus we affirm his\nconclusions that the appellant was not subject to pretrial punishment in\nviolation of Article 13, UCMJ.\nH. Denial of trial defense counsel’s site visit to Iraq\n   The appellant alleges that the military judge erred in denying his TDC’s\nrequest for a site visit to Iraq, depriving him of equal access to evidence, due\nprocess, and effective representation.\n   We review a military judge’s discovery rulings for an abuse of discretion.\nUnited States v.

Equal access under Article 46, UCMJ\n    Article 46, UCMJ, affords trial counsel, trial defense counsel, and the\ncourt-martial “equal opportunity to obtain witnesses and other evidence[.]” It\nis implemented in R.C.M. 701 and R.C.M. 703. R.C.M. 701 ensures “[e]ach\nparty shall have adequate opportunity to prepare its case and equal\nopportunity to interview witnesses and inspect evidence. . . . No party may\nunreasonably impede the access of another party to a witness or evidence.”\nR.C.M. 701(e). The government must make evidence in the “possession,\ncustody, or control of military authorities” available if it is “material to the\npreparation of the defense[.]” R.C.M. 701(a)(2). The standard for production\nof evidence not in a military authority’s possession, custody, or control is\nhigher. Parties to a court-martial are “entitled to production of evidence that\nis relevant and necessary.” R.C.M. 703(f)(1).\n   When moving “for discovery under R.C.M. 701 or for production of\nwitnesses or evidence[,]” the burden is on the moving party to prove, by a\npreponderance of the evidence, “any factual issue the resolution of which is\nnecessary to decide a motion[.]” R.C.M. 905(b)(4), (c).\n   a. Motion to compel\n   The appellant filed a motion to compel after the CA denied his TDC’s\nrequest for a site visit to Hamdaniyah, Iraq.196 He sought government-funded\nand facilitated travel and access to Hamdaniyah so his trial defense counsel\ncould inspect the site of the alleged offenses and locate and interview\nprospective witnesses.\n   At an Article 39(a), UCMJ, session, the deputy intelligence officer at\nMarine Forces Central testified about conditions on the ground near\nHamdaniyah. Beginning in June 2014, 80-90% of surrounding Al Anbar\nProvince had fallen under the control of the Islamic State of Iraq and the\nLevant, and nearby Abu Ghraib was “one of the more contested violent areas\n\n   196   AE LXIX.\n\n\n                                      81\n\f                       United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nin Al Anbar[.]”197 The intelligence officer opined that it would be “very, very\ndifficult, if not impossible” to send a team of investigators or attorneys to the\ngeneral area.198 Testimony about the current condition of the homes of SG\nand the Iraqi man killed on 26 April 2006 was inconclusive. Finally, the\nintelligence officer understood that the Department of State, not the\nDepartment of Defense, had the final authority for such travel to Iraq, and he\nwas doubtful of their approval given the danger and lack of Iraqi\ngovernmental control of Hamdaniyah.199\n   During argument at the Article 39(a), UCMJ, session, TDC proposed, as\nan alternative, a limitation on the government’s admission of evidence\nobtained in Iraq. In rebuttal, TC asserted that his team had given the\nappellant’s trial defense team “everything [they had] . . . that was collected or\nproduced in Iraq[.]”200 TDC did not dispute the availability of the\ngovernment’s evidence but questioned the adequacy of the NCIS\ninvestigation and the evidence it yielded. Challenging the objectivity of the\nNCIS investigation, TDC speculated that the cache of evidence and exhibits\n“may have been very different had defense counsel been on the ground[.]”201\nWhen the military judge queried TDC about what evidence he hoped to find\non-site after eight years, TDC responded, “[i]nterviews.”202 Posed with the\ninability to compel production of any Iraqi witnesses, the TDC replied, “we\nask questions and then we open up doors, and we go down this path or that\npath, and that’s what—sometimes you run into some dead ends and\nsometimes you run into leads.”203\n    In his initial written ruling denying the site visit, the military judge made\nfindings of fact, all supported by the record and not clearly erroneous.\nConducting a de novo review of his application of the law, we concur with his\napplication and conclusions. The military judge held the appellant to the\nburden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that evidence and\nwitnesses beyond government control in Iraq were relevant and necessary at\ntrial. He concluded that the appellant offered nothing more than speculation\nas to the value of personally inspecting the site or the ability to locate\nwitnesses to the events. In a footnote to his written ruling, the military judge\n\n   197   Record at 489-90.\n   198   Id. at 490.\n   199   Id. at 491-494.\n   200   Id. at 501.\n   201   Id. at 502.\n   202   Id. at 496.\n   203   Id. at 497.\n\n\n                                         82\n\f                     United States v.

See R.C.M. 703(f)(1) (production of evidence); R.C.M. 703(d)\n(employment of expert witnesses).

He found that\n“[b]oth sides have equal access to the evidence available at trial and the\nGovernment is not calling any Iraqi witnesses on the merits.”205 The military\njudge initiated arrangements for the appellant’s former detailed defense\ncounsel, LtCol J.S., then a Reserve appellate judge on this court, to be made\navailable for privileged consultation with the appellant’s current defense\nteam. LtCol J.S. had made a brief visit to Hamdaniyah in January 2007 and\nhad seen the IED crater and interviewed one Iraqi witness. With the\nappellant’s access to all of the evidence and to detailed military counsel from\nthe first trial, the military judge concluded there was no violation of Article\n46, UCMJ, in this case, in 2007 or at the time of the motion.\n   We find no abuse of discretion in the military judge’s initial two rulings.\n   b. Motion to dismiss\n   In a subsequent Motion to Dismiss for Denial of Site Visit or,\nAlternatively, to Abate Proceedings Until Such Time as a Site Visit Can Be\nConducted, the appellant argued that without a new site visit, he would\nreceive neither due process nor effective representation.

Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nthe inadequacy of the appellant’s first trial defense counsel’s site visit to Iraq\nin 2007. The military judge issued a second written ruling, again denying a\nsite visit as well as the motion to dismiss or abate proceedings.206\n    We again find no clear error in the military judge’s findings of fact. The\nmilitary judge adopted his statement of law from his previous ruling and\nruled that the appellant had still failed to meet his burden of demonstrating\nthat a new site visit would “recover relevant and/or admissible evidence\nregarding the offenses allegedly committed there nine years ago.”207\nRegarding the appellant’s arguments about the insufficiency of his former\ntrial defense counsel’s site visit in 2007, the military judge found “the\nDefense must be considered at least somewhat complicit given the short\nnotice they provided in the face of the operational and security constraints in\nthe region.”208\n    The military judge did not abuse his discretion in finding no Article 46,\nUCMJ, violation in original trial defense counsel’s 2007 site visit. The right of\naccess to evidence—or sources of evidence—is not unlimited. There is usually\nno obligation to arrange interviews between trial defense counsel and\nwitnesses, but the government may not hinder them.

The Supreme Court subsequently confirmed that a\ndue process violation requires evidence of “bad faith” on the part of the\ngovernment when “potentially useful evidence”—but not “material\nexculpatory evidence”—is lost or destroyed. Fisher, 540 U.S. at 548-49 (citing\nYoungblood, 488 U.S.at 57). An accused cannot claim a due process right to\nevidence, or a source of evidence, with only the potential to yield something\nexculpatory, unless the government has lost or destroyed that evidence in bad\nfaith.\n    Although the appellant frames this AOE as a denial of discovery, it is\nmore accurately a denial of opportunity. He does not accuse the trial counsel\nor the government of withholding a piece of material exculpatory evidence.\nInstead, the government has allegedly withheld funding and support for an\nindependent investigation that might have uncovered something exculpatory.\nAt best, hypothetical evidence is potentially useful; therefore, the appellant\nmust attribute its loss or destruction to bad faith on the part of the\ngovernment. Id. Evidence of bad faith is missing here. We found no abuse of\ndiscretion in the military judge’s decision to deny a site visit to Hamdaniyah.\nThe appellant failed to demonstrate the required necessity of the site visit.\nNor did we find an abuse of discretion in the military judge’s conclusion that\nthe government did not violate discovery obligations during the original trial\ndefense counsel’s site visit to Hamdaniyah in January 2007.

Id. Although\nBoone alleged his TDC’s “failure to visit the crime scenes . . . led to a serious\nfactual error in [his] closing argument[,]” the court found “there [was] no\nobvious prejudice to the appellant in [Boone’s] case.” Id. Nor has this court\nfound “deficiencies in defense counsel’s performance under the Strickland\nstandards” when counsel “was denied the ability to view the crime scene by\nthe Staff Judge Advocate and the military judge” and “had extreme difficulty\nin interviewing the witnesses[.]” United States v.

The\nArmy Court of Criminal Appeals found no merit in Lorance’s claim of\nineffective assistance of counsel in light of the defense team’s overall\nperformance and the lack of prejudice in the face of “overwhelming evidence\nagainst [him].” Id. at *18-*19. In the case before us, conditions on the ground\nin Hamdaniyah made trial defense counsel’s request to travel there to\ninvestigate unreasonable.\n    Not only does the appellant fail to demonstrate that denial of a site visit\nrobbed him of TDC performance within an objective standard of\nreasonableness, he fails to articulate how a site visit would have altered the\noutcome of his court-martial. His assertion of prejudice is detached from the\nfacts of his case and is almost circular; instead he claims that denial of a site\nvisit robbed him of his rights to a fair trial and due process. As discussed\npreviously, we disagree.\n   Instead, we find that the appellant benefited from zealous, competent\nrepresentation throughout his second court-martial. His TDC effectively\nchallenged the evidence brought from Iraq, and there were no Iraqi witnesses\n\n\n   213   Appellant’s Brief at 146.\n\n\n                                        88\n\f                  United States v.

Nothing in Iraq could have better equipped TDC to challenge\ntheir testimony.\n    The appellant does not point to a piece of evidence or witness whose\ntestimony would have altered the outcome of his trial. His assertion of\nprejudice is speculative. Not only has he failed to demonstrate that “his\ncounsel’s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,” he\nhas also failed to demonstrate that his “counsel’s performance gives rise to a\n‘reasonable probability’ that the result of the proceeding would have been\ndifferent without counsel’s unprofessional errors.” Akbar, 74 M.J. at 371.\nWithout either, there is no ineffective assistance of counsel.\nI. Admissibility of identification on autopsy report\n    The appellant claims that the military judge abused his discretion when\nhe admitted an autopsy report whose relevance depended upon impermissible\ntestimonial hearsay from Iraqi citizens who identified the body.\n    This AOE presents us with hearsay within hearsay—alleged testimonial\nhearsay appearing in a routine professional report prepared by and informing\nthe testimony of an expert witness. Whether the imbedded evidence was\ntestimonial hearsay is a question of law we review de novo.

We review the military judge’s decision to admit\nevidence that contains testimonial hearsay for an abuse of discretion,\n“‘considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing\nparty.’” Katso, 74 M.J. at 278-79 (quoting United States v.

Testimonial hearsay\n    First we examine the appellant’s allegation of testimonial hearsay.\n“[A]dmission of ‘testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at\ntrial’” violates the Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause unless the\nwitness is “‘unavailable to testify, and the [accused] had had a prior\nopportunity for cross-examination.’” Id. at 278 (quoting Crawford, 541 U.S. at\n53-54); U.S. CONST., amend VI. In Crawford, the Supreme Court defined\ntestimony as “typically ‘[a] solemn declaration or affirmation made for the\npurpose of establishing or proving some fact.’ . . . An accuser who makes a\nformal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a\nperson who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not.” 541 U.S. at\n51 (quoting 2 N. WEBSTER, AN AMERICAN DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH\nLANGUAGE (1828)) (alteration in original). Our superior court has\ncharacterized a statement as testimonial “‘if made under circumstances\n\n\n                                     89\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nwhich would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the\nstatement would be available for use at a later trial.’” Katso, 74 M.J. at 278\n(quoting United States v.

There are also three factors to guide this\nobjective, but contextual, analysis, often referred to as Rankin factors:\n            (1) the statement was elicited by or made in response to law\n         enforcement or prosecutorial inquiry;\n             (2) the statement involved more than a routine and\n         objective cataloging of unambiguous factual matters; and\n             (3) the primary purpose for making, or eliciting, the\n         statement was the production of evidence with an eye toward\n         trial.\nUnited States v.

The lead NCIS agent, Special Agent (SA) J.C., testified about his\nefforts to exhume the body of the man shot in the IED crater on 26 April\n2006. The victim’s family led a convoy of military personnel, including SA\nJ.C., to the burial site, but an IED detonated under one of the vehicles in the\nconvoy en route to the site. SA J.C. never reached the burial site that day. At\nSA J.C.’s request, the appellant’s company commander visited the victim’s\nfamily and obtained GPS coordinates for the burial site. The company\ncommander testified during the second court-martial but was not asked to\nconfirm that he collected GPS coordinates of the burial site from the family at\nSA J.C.’s request. Following the GPS coordinates, a second convoy traveled to\nthe site, and SA J.C. led the exhumation. SA J.C. testified that the victim’s\nbrother accompanied him to the burial site, pointed to the grave, “and at one\npoint, he started digging in the grave site.”214 No Iraqi witness was subject to\ncross-examination or made available for either trial of the appellant.\n    Applying the Rankin factors to this information, we find it constitutes\ntestimonial hearsay. 72 M.J. at 288. First, the victim’s family revealed the\nburial site location at the request of NCIS, a law enforcement entity\nsupporting the Navy and Marine Corps. Second, the information involved the\nrecent death of a family member. The family attributed the death to\nAmerican service members and had pressed a complaint with the military\nleadership in the area. “[T]he statement involved more than a routine and\n\n   214   Record at 1515.\n\n\n                                       90\n\f                        United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nobjective cataloging of unambiguous factual matters[.]” Id. Finally, NCIS\nrequested the information after securing an order to exhume the Iraqi\ncitizen’s remains with the intent to transport them to the United States for\nan autopsy. During cross-examination, SA J.C. acknowledged the difficulty in\nobtaining the exhumation order. As NCIS sought the autopsy in furtherance\nof its investigation of serious criminal offenses, presentation of the resulting\nevidence at court-martial was a possible, if not likely and intended, outcome.\n   2. Admissibility of the autopsy report\n    Having found there was testimonial hearsay in identification of the body\nautopsied, we now turn to whether it rendered the medical examiner’s report\nand testimony inadmissible. TDC objected to admission of the autopsy report\nbased on hearsay and lack of relevance. With regard to hearsay, the military\njudge ruled from the bench that the report satisfied the hearsay exception for\nrecords of regularly conducted activities under MIL. R. EVID. 803(6). As to\nrelevance, TDC protested, “[t]hey haven’t even identified the body yet, sir, if\nthis is even the person that they should be doing [the] autopsy report on.” 215\nThe military judge acknowledged, “that’s certainly a link in the chain that\nthe government—they got that problem.”216 But then the military judge\nposited that “wounds consistent to what witnesses have testified to being\ninflicted on [the victim]” were circumstantial evidence of identity and thus\nrelevant and admissible.217\n    TDC did not explicitly invoke testimonial hearsay and the Confrontation\nClause in his objection to the autopsy report. Nevertheless, the references to\nlinks in the chain on the record reveal the parties’ cognizance of flaws in the\nbody’s chain of custody. Testimonial hearsay formed not just a weak link but\nthe chain’s questionable origin. To determine whether the testimonial\nhearsay should have resulted in exclusion of this report from evidence, we\nexamine the significance of that testimonial hearsay to the report and\ntestimony about it.\n   When testimonial hearsay is presented to the court through an expert\nwitness, we determine whether that expert testimony violates the\nConfrontation Clause by asking:\n          First, did the expert’s testimony rely in some way on out-of-\n          court statements that were themselves testimonial?\n\n\n\n\n   215   Id. at 1814.\n   216   Id.\n   217   Id.\n\n\n                                          91\n\f                        United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n          Second, if so, was the expert’s testimony nonetheless\n          admissible because he reached his own conclusions based on\n          knowledge of the underlying data and facts, such that the\n          expert himself, not the out-of-court declarant, was the ‘witness\n          against [the appellant]’ under the Sixth Amendment?\nKatso, 74 M.J. at 279 (citing Crawford, 541 U.S. at 44, 51-52) (additional\ncitations omitted). Put another way, we ask whether the expert witness “had\nsufficient personal knowledge to reach an independent conclusion as to the\nobject of his testimony and his expert opinion.” Id. at 280 (citing United\nStates v.

After the NCIS-directed exhumation of the\nbody identified as the shooting victim in this case, Master-at-Arms Second\nClass (MA2) I.D. accepted custody of the body from “mortuary affairs”218 on 6\nJune 2006 and escorted it from Camp Fallujah, Iraq, to Dover. An NCIS\nagent met MA2 ID when he landed at Dover and took custody of the body\nfrom him. On 8 June 2006, CAPT SL, performed the autopsy.219 His report of\n6 July 2006 includes a “[p]resumptive identification . . . established by\naccompanying documentation and photographs.”220 CAPT S.L. testified that\nNCIS typically provided a history on a decedent “[t]o give us some\nbackground information. . . .

Responding to the information that\nthe shooting victim was bound, CAPT S.L. noted that “[d]issection into the\nskin and soft tissues of the wrists and ankles revealed no hemorrhage or\nother injury, which might be expected if the individual was bound.”224 But the\nuse of flexible cuffs and the advanced state of composition prevented him\nfrom excluding the possibility that he was bound. CAPT S.L. also commented\non findings from which he could infer that the man “had some degree of\ndifficulty with ambulation.”225 Nowhere in the report did CAPT S.L. appear to\nrely on any information from NCIS to form his opinion.\n    Qualified as an expert witness in forensic pathology, CAPT S.L.\nauthenticated and explained his report, including the process of performing\nan autopsy and his specific findings in this case. TC asked CAPT S.L. about\nthe trajectory of gunshot wounds, the existence of stippling and its evidence\nof the range of the shot, and his interpretation of metal fragments recovered\nfrom the body. CAPT S.L.’s testimony relied almost entirely on the\napplication of his expertise to observations he made during an autopsy he\nperformed.226 He relied on the purported identity of the body, the\ncircumstances surrounding the death, or anything else flowing from the\ntestimonial hearsay only for the nexus they created between the body and\nthis case. Presented with background details such as the possible use of\nflexible handcuffs, the purported victim’s reported limp, and the location of\ngunshot wounds, he indicated whether his autopsy findings were consistent,\nor inconsistent, with such facts. Ultimately the relevance of the report, not\nthe report’s findings themselves, relied on testimonial hearsay.\n    With some reliance on the testimonial hearsay, we proceed to the second\nKatso factor—whether the expert’s testimony was nonetheless admissible\nbecause he reached his own conclusions based on knowledge of the\nunderlying data and facts, and his opinions, not those of an out-of-court\ndeclarant, were subject to the cross-examination required by the\nConfrontation Clause. 74 M.J. at 279. While testimonial hearsay formed the\nbasis of the relevance of CAPT S.L.’s report and testimony to this case, the\nconclusions in the report and testimony suggest no reliance on that\ntestimonial hearsay. CAPT S.L. carefully documented, in writing and on the\nstand, the scientific processes he followed and the data he relied on to\nsupport his conclusions.

Furthermore, CAPT S.L.\nacknowledged early in cross-examination that he had not independently\nidentified the body he autopsied through DNA, dental records, fingerprints,\nor other scientific methods. But other than reporting the background\ninformation NCIS provided, CAPT S.L. did not opine on the identity of the\nbody in his report or his testimony.

Look at the wound patterns.”227 TC encouraged the\nmembers to compare the wounds CAPT S.L. highlighted on the autopsy\nreport to the photograph of the man killed in the IED crater on 26 April 2006.\nThis was circumstantial evidence from which the members could identify the\nbody as that of the man killed in the IED crater on 26 April 2006. Even\nwithout the direct evidence of a fully documented chain of custody for the\nbody, circumstantial evidence in the report tying the body to the victim in\nthis court-martial was sufficient to render the report relevant.

SA J.C. was\non the stand authenticating physical evidence in the government’s case. The\nprosecutor asked him if he confronted the appellant with the appellant’s\nafter-action report about the shooting, and SA J.C. responded:\n              Well, I don’t remember specifically showing that to him at\n          that time. But like I said, eventually after a time into the\n          interview, it was time to start playing some of our cards that\n          we had developed through some of the other interviews\n          through some of the other squad members from earlier in the\n          day. And at which time, he invoked at the interview.229\n\n\n\n\n   229   Id.\n\n\n                                       95\n\f                       United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n    TDC objected immediately, requested a mistrial, and protested, “[h]e’s\ngoing into Sergeant Hutchins’s Constitutional right to remain silent.”230 At a\nbrief Article 39(a), UCMJ, session immediately following the comments and\nobjection, the military judge decided to give the members a curative\ninstruction right away but to postpone litigation of the motion for a mistrial\nuntil the next morning. As soon as the members reassembled in the\ncourtroom, the military judge admonished them to disregard any invocation\nof rights by the appellant231 and then confirmed with them as a group that\nthey understood.\n    The following day, after hearing arguments from both parties, the\nmilitary judge adopted TDC’s proposed curative instruction232 and agreed to\nconduct individual voir dire of the members. We must now determine\nwhether—in light of the requirement that the members’ exposure to the\ninadmissible evidence be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt—the military\njudge abused his discretion in declining to declare a mistrial. He briefly made\nfindings of fact from the bench:\n          [W]hat I found here is that this was a [sic] isolated reference to\n          a singular invocation of rights by the witness. It was extremely\n          brief. There are no details about the rights invoked or the\n          offense or offenses to which the rights were invoked. We\n          immediately called a[n Article] 39(a) [session]. I immediately\n          gave instructions to disregard. I find that the inadmissible\n          invocation testimony didn’t have any direct bearing on the\n\n\n\n   230   Id.\n   231   The military judge told the members:\n               Members, you heard some testimony that suggesting, perhaps,\n          that the accused in this case may have invoked some rights when\n          being questioned by this witness. That’s a completely improper\n          discussion point for us here. It’s irrelevant to your consideration, and\n          it’s never, ever, to be held against anyone accused of a crime that they\n          invoked, whether they invoked, whether they didn’t invoke.\n              It’s not to be considered by you for any reason whatsoever. That\n          testimony is stricken, and it’s to be completely disregard [sic] by you\n          for any purpose whatsoever. It will not be held against Sergeant\n          Hutchins in any manner whatsoever. If you all understand that,\n          could you please indicate by raising your hand.\n               That’s an affirmative response from all the members.\n   Id. at 1419-20.\n   232   AE CXLVIII; Record at 1450-51.\n\n\n                                            96\n\f                     United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n         testimony prior to it. It was toward the end and was unrelated\n         to the other issues in any substantive manner.233\n   The military judge did not articulate the legal standard he followed, but\nhe referred counsel to two cases: United States v. Sidwell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(C.A.A.F 1999) and United States v. Boore, 2014 CCA LEXIS 609,\nunpublished op. (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 21 Aug 2014) (per curiam).\n   2. Sidwell test\n    In Sidwell, the CAAF analyzed testimony from a law enforcement agent\nwho uttered, “[s]ubsequent to [Sidwell] invoking his rights, he made – ” before\nbeing interrupted by trial defense counsel’s objection. 51 M.J. at 263\n(emphasis in original). To assess the possible prejudice resulting from this\nerroneous admission and gauge whether it was, instead, harmless beyond a\nreasonable doubt, the CAAF considered three things: the nature of the\ncomment, the curative instruction given, and the “effect of the error on the\nother prosecution and defense evidence presented in the case.” Id. at 265\n(citing United States v. Riley, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">276</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 279-80 (C.A.A.F. 1997)). The CAAF\nconcluded that, “viewed in its entirety, [the error] did not have great\npotential to prejudice appellant.” Id. In support of their conclusion, the CAAF\ncited the isolated nature of the reference, its extreme brevity, the immediacy\nwith which the military judge called an Article 39(a), UCMJ, session, the\nprompt instruction to the members to disregard the evidence, and trial\ncounsel’s silence about Sidwell’s invocation in argument. Id.\n    The military judge’s factual findings mirrored those on which the CAAF\nrelied, in part, in Sidwell. The record supports his characterization of SA\nJ.C.’s comment as isolated and extremely brief. Aside from the trial counsel’s\nquestion about the appellant’s after-action report and SA J.C.’s reference to\nthe other squad members’ interviews, this statement was bereft of context.\nTrial defense counsel’s objection, the Article 39(a), UCMJ, session, and the\ninitial curative instruction came in quick succession. TC then asked SA J.C.\none more brief question about the appellant’s interview and his after-action\nreport before returning to the authentication of physical evidence.\n    The next day, the military judge adopted the appellant’s proposed\ncurative instruction and read it to members before TDC began his cross-\nexamination of SA J.C. While the appellant does not object to the content of\nhis own curative instruction, we nevertheless note that it closely hews to the\ncurative instruction in United States v. Garrett, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">413</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 417 (C.M.A.\n1987), which the CAAF has endorsed. See Sidwell, 51 M.J. at 265; United\nStates v. Whitney, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">413</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 416 (C.A.A.F. 2001). After reminding the\n\n\n   233   Record at 1435.\n\n\n                                       97\n\f                        United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nmembers that they all enjoyed the “absolute and moral right to exercise their\nconstitutional privileges,” the military judge echoed the Garrett instruction in\nstating:\n              The only thing that matters in this case is that Sergeant\n          Hutchins always has a constitutional right to exercise his legal\n          prerogative and no adverse result may obtain from his exercise\n          of those constitutional rights. You may not infer guilt, nor may\n          you infer any other fact based on Sergeant Hutchins’ proper\n          exercise of his constitutional rights.234\n    The military judge then conducted individual voir dire of the members,\nconfirming their ability to follow the instruction. “Absent evidence to the\ncontrary, court members are presumed to comply with the military judge’s\ninstructions.” United States v. Thompkins, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 47 (C.A.A.F. 2003)\n(citations omitted). There is no evidence the members disregarded the\nmilitary judge’s instructions.\n    Finally, we consider the impact of the error on the subsequent\npresentation of evidence. The appellant does not allege any impact on the rest\nof the case. Suppression of the appellant’s statements to NCIS and the\nrelated reversal of his first court-martial had already transformed the\nappellant’s statements to SA J.C. into a third rail for the government. The\nprosecution focused some attention on the appellant’s after-action report,\nwhich was the subject of the only false official statement charge against the\nappellant. But the appellant’s interviews with NCIS were otherwise absent\nfrom the government’s case. Nor did the trial counsel allude to the appellant’s\ninvocation in his closing argument.\n    Errant mention of the invocation did not affect the trial defense team’s\npresentation of evidence either. Recognizing that the strongest evidence\nagainst the appellant lay in the testimony of his squad mates, TDC focused\non attacking their interrogations and testimony at the first court-martial.\nAccording to the defense theory, the appellant’s guilt was an NCIS\nfabrication imposed on the frightened and coerced members of the appellant’s\nsquad. SA J.C. had not confronted the appellant with a truth he could not\nrefute. SA J.C. had confronted the appellant with a concocted version of\nevents. The appellant’s decision to remain silent did not matter.\n    Instead of pointing to where the error manifested elsewhere in the trial,\nthe appellant alleges substantial prejudice by framing SA J.C.’s brief\nstatement as improper lie detector testimony. According to the appellant,\nmembers were left with the impression that SA J.C. “determined Sgt\n\n\n   234   Id. at 1451.\n\n\n                                          98\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nHutchins was lying during the initial portion of the interrogation, so then he\nconfronted Sgt Hutchins with the overwhelming evidence of guilt—the\n‘cards’—, and that caused Sgt Hutchins to opt for silence because he could not\nexplain it away.”235\n    We do not find that argument persuasive. The members acquitted the\nappellant of the sole specification of false official statement for submitting his\nafter-action report. This acquittal indicates that their findings of guilty did\nnot rely on their assessments of the appellant’s credibility. Nor do we believe\ntheir findings relied on SA J.C.’s assessment of his credibility. Without the\ncontext of the appellant’s interrogations, SA J.C.’s comment came in a\nvacuum and simply did not carry the weight the defense alleges. SA J.C. was\nnot an expert or other authoritative witness on whom members might unduly\nrely for his insight. Cf Diaz, 59 M.J. at 93 (concluding that a curative\ninstruction was inadequate to correct the expert witness’s testimony that\nDiaz murdered the victim).\n   Secondly, the appellant argues that the members would interpret the\ninvocation in conjunction with their knowledge of a prior trial set aside for\nsome technicality and assume only someone guilty would face retrial. This\nargument requires us to assume the members disregarded the military\njudge’s clear instruction about everything from the presumption of innocence\nand the burden of proof to inferring guilt from the act of invocation. Without\nany evidence to support such an assumption, we decline to do so.\n    We find no clear error in the military judge’s finding that the reference to\ninvocation was so brief and isolated as to be effectively cured by the\ninstructions he promptly gave. Notably, those curative instructions were\nconsistent with curative instructions the CAAF has favorably endorsed under\nsimilar circumstances. See Sidwell, 51 M.J. at 265. We conclude that the\nmilitary judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the appellant’s motion\nfor a mistrial.\nK. Cumulative error\n   The appellant urges us to set aside the findings and sentence based on the\ncumulative effect of the errors in this case.\n   “The cumulative effect of all plain errors and preserved errors is reviewed\nde novo.” United States v. Pope, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">328</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 335 (C.A.A.F. 2011). When the\naccumulation of errors deprived the appellant of a fair trial, Article 59(a),\nUCMJ, compels us to reverse it. United States v. Banks, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 171\n(C.M.A. 1992).\n\n\n\n   235   Appellant’s Brief at 161.\n\n\n                                        99\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n   Despite the military judge’s failure to consider the appellant’s proffered\nacquittal of conspiring to kill anyone other than S.G., we ultimately found no\nerror in the admission of the evidence of a conspiracy to commit Plans B and\nC.\n    We found only one error in the course of this trial—NCIS SA J.C.’s\nreference to the appellant’s invocation of his right to remain silent. As\npreviously discussed in section J., not one but two curative instructions\nsufficiently addressed any risk of prejudice from the members’ brief exposure\nto evidence the appellant invoked his right to remain silent.\n    These two errors, even in aggregate, did not deprive the appellant of a fair\ntrial, and Article 59(a), UCMJ, does not require reversal. Further, we decline\nthe appellant’s invitation to set aside the findings and sentence under Article\n66(c).236\nL. Sentence appropriateness\n   The appellant argues that his sentence “was excessive and\ndisproportionate,” particularly in light of his squad members’ and co-\nconspirators’ sentences.\n    Article 66(c), UCMJ, requires us to approve a court-martial sentence only\nif we find it “correct in law and fact and [determine], on the basis of the entire\nrecord, [that it] should be approved.” “The power to review a case for sentence\nappropriateness, which reflects the unique history and attributes of the\nmilitary justice system, includes but is not limited to considerations of\nuniformity and evenhandedness of sentencing decisions.” United States v.\nSothen, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 296 (C.A.A.F. 2001) (citing United States v.

Uniformity in\nsentencing is typically subsumed in the discretionary assessment of\nappropriateness encompassed in our Article 66, UCMJ, review authority. But\nin certain circumstances, sentence disparity can rise to a question of law.\n   1. Sentence disparity\n    Assessing sentence appropriateness by comparison to other cases has long\nbeen disfavored, except in specific circumstances. See United States v.\nBallard, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">282</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 283 (C.M.A. 1985) (“It is well settled that, except in\nthose rare instances in which sentence appropriateness can be fairly\ndetermined only by reference to disparate sentences adjudged in closely\nrelated cases, such as those of accomplices, sentence appropriateness should\nbe determined without reference to or comparison with the sentences\nreceived by other offenders.” (citation omitted)). The burden falls on the\nappellant to demonstrate those exceptional circumstances: (1) the cases the\n\n   236   Id. at 163-64.\n\n\n                                        100\n\f                       United States v.

If the appellant succeeds on both prongs, then the\nburden shifts to the government to “show that there is a rational basis for the\ndisparity.” Id.; see also United States v. Kelly, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">558</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 570 (N.M.C.M.R.\n1994) (noting that Article 66, UCMJ, authorizes reduction of “widely\ndisparate dispositions or sentences” between “closely related” cases when\n“unsupported by good and cogent reasons”).\n    Cases may be “closely related” by virtue of “coactors involved in a common\ncrime, servicemembers involved in a common or parallel scheme, or some\nother direct nexus between the servicemembers whose sentences are sought\nto be compared[.]” Lacy, 50 M.J. at 288. See also Kelly, 40 M.J. at 570\n(defining “closely related” cases as those that “involve offenses that are\nsimilar in both nature and seriousness or which arise from a common scheme\nor design”). The appellant and his seven squad mates were accused of being\nparty to the same conspiracy. The charges referred against all of them arose\nfrom the same course of events. We need not belabor our determination that\nthe appellant’s case is closely related to his squad mates’ and co-conspirators’\ncases. Thus we turn to whether the outcomes were highly disparate.\n    On appeal, the appellant alleges that his sentence is highly disparate\nbecause none of his squad mates served more than 18 months of confinement,\nand only two left the Marine Corps with bad-conduct discharges.237 To meet\nhis burden, the appellant submits his squad mates’ “final approved\nsentences” and details their convictions, punitive discharges where\napplicable, and confinement served.238 However, we gauge disparity among\nclosely related cases based on adjudged sentences, not approved sentences.\nSee United States v. Roach, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 21 (C.A.A.F. 2010) (clarifying that\nCourts of Criminal Appeals compare the adjudged sentences of closely related\ncases because “there are several intervening and independent factors\nbetween trial and appeal—including discretionary grants of clemency and\nlimits from pretrial agreements—that might properly create the disparity in\nwhat are otherwise closely related cases”). Disparity is also relative to the\nmaximum punishment an accused faces. Lacy, 50 M.J. at 289.\n    The appellant was found guilty of conspiracy to commit larceny, false\nofficial statements, murder, and obstruction of justice, unpremeditated\nmurder, and larceny of a shovel and an AK-47 assault rifle and faced a\ndishonorable discharge and life imprisonment.239 He was sentenced to a bad-\n\n   237   Id. at 166.\n   238   Id. at 165-66.\n   239   AE CXCIII.\n\n\n                                         101\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nconduct discharge and 2,627 days’ confinement, which equated to time\nserved.240 Military judges awarded all five of the most junior members of the\nappellant’s squad dishonorable discharges and sentences to confinement\nranging from five to 14 years.241 Only PFC Jodka received a shorter sentence\nof confinement than the appellant. With the exception of LCpl Pennington,\nthe junior squad members pleaded guilty to less serious charges and faced far\nless than confinement for life. Only LCpl Pennington pleaded guilty to\nconspiracy to commit murder, and he was awarded 14 years’ confinement.\nPursuant to pretrial agreements, the CA significantly reduced their terms of\nconfinement and disapproved their punitive discharges. Any disparity\nbetween the appellant’s sentence and his junior squad members’ adjudged\nsentences lay in the relative leniency he received. Perhaps for this reason, the\nappellant asks us to limit the pool of closely related cases to Cpl Thomas and\nCpl Magincalda. But he cites no authority for his self-serving selection of\ncomparables.\n    Both Cpl Thomas and Cpl Magincalda pleaded not guilty to all charges\nbefore panels with enlisted representation but were convicted of conspiracy to\ncommit murder and other less serious charges.242 Members sentenced Cpl\nThomas to a bad-conduct discharge and reduction to pay grade E-1.243 Cpl\nMagincalda was awarded 448 days’ confinement (time served) and reduction\nto pay grade E-1.\n    Assuming, arguendo, we disregard the sentences military judges handed\ndown and find the appellant’s sentence to be highly disparate among\nmembers’ sentences, we look at whether the government has offered “a\nrational basis for disparity.” Lacy, 50 M.J. at 288. The government argues\nthat the appellant’s position as squad leader and highest ranking member of\nthe conspiracy is the rational basis for the disparity. Citing squad member\ntestimony, the government asserts that the appellant\n          first raised the topic and hatched the scheme to commit\n          murder, . . . asked each junior Marine and Sailor to agree to\n          engage in the plot, . . . gave the order to fire, . . . [and] held two\n          meetings with the squad to encourage them to “stick to the\n          story.” In short, Appellant was the mastermind of this plot—\n          from inception, to firing the fatal shots into the Victim’s face as\n\n\n\n   240   AE CXCVII.\n   241   Staff Judge Advocate’s Recommendation of 18 Sep 2015, Enclosures (4)–(8).\n   242   Id., Enclosures (9) and (10).\n   243   Id., Enclosure (9).\n\n\n                                          102\n\f                      United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\n         he gurgled his last breathes [sic], to orchestrating the cover-\n         up.244\nThe record supports the appellant’s leadership role in the formation and\nexecution of the conspiracy and lacks any evidence that one of the more\ncombat-experienced corporals superseded him. While we do not find the\nappellant’s sentence to be highly disparate, the presence of a rational basis\nand good and cogent reasons for a more severe sentence for the appellant\neffectively rebuts the appellant’s claim of a highly disparate sentence among\nclosely related cases. See e.g., United States v. Fee, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">290</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 291-92\n(C.A.A.F. 1999) (upholding this court’s affirmation of allegedly highly\ndisparate sentences awarded to a wife and husband based on the\nidentification of “a rational basis for the differences in the sentences”).\n   Thus we are left with the more generalized assessment of the\nappropriateness of the appellant’s sentence.\n   2. Sentence appropriateness\n   Article 66, UCMJ, obliges us to evaluate the appellant’s sentence\nindependently for appropriateness. See United States v. Baier, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">382</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n384-85 (C.A.A.F. 2005). We review sentence appropriateness de novo. United\nStates v. Lane, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2 (C.A.A.F. 2006).\n    “Sentence appropriateness involves the judicial function of assuring that\njustice is done and that the accused gets the punishment he deserves.” Healy,\n26 M.J. at 395. This requires our “‘individualized consideration’ of the\nparticular accused ‘on the basis of the nature and seriousness of the offense\nand the character of the offender.’” United States v. Snelling, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 268\n(C.M.A. 1988) (quoting United States v. Mamaluy, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">C.M.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 180-81\n(C.M.A. 1959)). In making this assessment, we analyze the record as a whole.\nHealy, 26 M.J. at 395. Notwithstanding our significant discretion to\ndetermine appropriateness, we may not engage in acts of clemency, which is\nthe prerogative of the CA. United States v. Nerad, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 146 (C.A.A.F.\n2010).\n   As the appellant requests, we may consider approved as well as adjudged\nsentences in companion cases when assessing sentence appropriateness. See\nRoach, 69 M.J. at 21 (“In contrast, when the CCA (Courts of Criminal\nAppeals) is exercising its power over sentence appropriateness generally, it\nmay consider both adjudged and approved sentences.”). The CA in this case\nnegotiated pretrial agreements with the five junior squad members and\ngranted clemency to LCpl Pennington, greatly reducing their sentences. But\neven Article 66, UCMJ, does not grant CCAs the same unfettered discretion\n\n   244   Answer on Behalf of Appellee of 20 Dec 2016 at 150-51 (citations omitted).\n\n\n                                          103\n\f                  United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nCAs enjoyed under Article 60, UCMJ, or command prerogative. See Nerad, 69\nM.J. at 145. “While the CCA clearly has the authority to disapprove part or\nall of the sentence and findings, nothing suggests that Congress intended to\nprovide the CCAs with unfettered discretion to do so for any reason, for no\nreason, or on equitable grounds[.]” Id. Uniformity of sentence is but one\nconsideration when evaluating appropriateness,245 and equity is not a proper\nbasis for disapproving a sentence.\n    Considering the entire record, there is nothing excessive or\ndisproportionate about a sentence to a bad-conduct discharge and less than\neight years’ confinement for the murder of the unknown Iraqi man in this\ncase. The appellant’s widespread reputation as a charismatic and effective\nleader of Marines and his compelling account of his confinement following his\nfirst court-martial earned him significant extenuation and mitigation and\nspared him a dishonorable discharge and a return to confinement. Further\nreduction of his sentence would not be an act of justice but of mercy, or\nperhaps equity, and beyond our authority under Article 66, UCMJ. See id.\nM. Legal and factual sufficiency\n    Finally, the appellant alleges that the case against him was legally and\nfactually insufficient.\n    We review the legal and factual sufficiency of evidence de novo. Art. 66(c),\nUCMJ; United States v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">394</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 399 (C.A.A.F. 2002). The\ntest for the legal sufficiency of evidence is “whether, considering the evidence\nin the light most favorable to the prosecution, a reasonable factfinder could\nhave found all the essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt.” United\nStates v. Turner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (C.M.A. 1987) (quoting Jackson v. Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110138\"><a href=\"/opinion/110138/jackson-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 319 (1979)). In resolving questions of legal sufficiency, “we are\nbound to draw every reasonable inference from the evidence of record in favor\nof the prosecution.” United States v. Barner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">131</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 134 (C.A.A.F. 2001)\n(citations omitted).\n    “For factual sufficiency, the test is whether, after weighing the evidence\nin the record of trial and making allowances for not having personally\nobserved the witnesses, the members of the [appellate court] are themselves\nconvinced of the accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Turner, 25 M.J.\nat 325. “Such a review involves a fresh, impartial look at the evidence, giving\nno deference to the decision of the trial court on factual sufficiency beyond the\nadmonition in Article 66(c), UCMJ, to take into account the fact that the trial\n\n   245 See Snelling, 14 M.J. at 268 (“However proper it may be for the convening\nauthority and [Courts of Criminal Appeals] to consider sentence comparison as an\naspect of sentence appropriateness, it is only one of many aspects of that\nconsideration.”) (citations omitted).\n\n\n                                      104\n\f                  United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\ncourt saw and heard the witnesses.” Washington, 57 M.J. at 399. “By\n‘reasonable doubt’ is not intended a fanciful or ingenious doubt or conjecture,\nbut an honest, conscientious doubt suggested by the material evidence or lack\nof it in this case. . . . The proof must be such as to exclude not every\nhypothesis or possibility of innocence, but every fair and rational hypothesis\nexcept that of guilt.” United States v. Loving, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 281 (C.A.A.F.\n1994).\n    The remarkably detailed and consistent testimony of the five squad\nmembers provided overwhelming evidence of the appellant’s guilt, covering\nall elements of the offenses of which he was convicted. Although we were\nunable to personally observe the squad members testify at the first and\nsecond courts-martial, the minute details that brought their depictions to life,\nincluding specifics with no real bearing on the offenses, conveyed their\ncredibility. Details varied depending on the role each member played—\nproviding security, participating in the initial planning discussion, stepping\noff with the snatch team, or remaining behind. But the squad members\ncorroborated each other, and their narratives wove together to form a\ncomplete and clear account of the night’s events.\n    The appellant challenges his squad mates’ testimony as a fabrication\nforced upon them during coercive interrogations. TDC accused Hospitalman\nSecond Class (HM2) S., the platoon’s other Navy corpsman and a member of\nthe Quick Reaction Force that responded to the scene minutes after the\nshooting, of framing his close friend and mentor, HM3 Bacos, the appellant\nand the other members of the squad for murder. According to the appellant,\nHM2 S. is the source of the elaborate conspiracy to kill S.G. or someone close\nto him. Although HM2 S. admitted to later fabricating a threatening note in\norder to escape the squad he had implicated and their platoon, no convincing\nmotive for such a large-scale fiction as this conspiracy ever came to light.\nInstead, HM3 Bacos’s testimony foreshadowed the crisis of conscience that\nprompted him to confide in HM2 S., who later reported those confidences to\nNCIS.\n    According to the appellant, multiple NCIS agents then forced HM3 Bacos\nto adopt HM2 S.’s statement and forced the other members of the squad to\nadopt HM3 Bacos’s statement. Again, the appellant offers no plausible motive\nfor an entire team of investigators to strong-arm him and five other members\nof his squad into parroting the statement of a non-participant. Nor does he\ncredibly explain how a relatively brief interview between NCIS agents and\nHM2 S. evolved into the robust testimony before us. The conspicuously\nuniform affidavits from HM3 Bacos, LCpl Pennington, LCpl Shumate, and\nPFC Jodka alleging coercive interrogations and resulting perjury are\ninsufficient to raise reasonable doubt, even in light of our superior court’s\n\n\n                                      105\n\f                  United States v. Hutchins, No. 200800393\n\n\nsuppression of the appellant’s confession. The overwhelming weight of the\ntestimony of the appellant’s co-conspirators also renders the autopsy,\nphysical evidence collected, and the testimony of lead SA J.C., who did little\nmore than authenticate the evidence, inconsequential.\n    Not only do we find the evidence legally sufficient, but we also find it\nfactually sufficient.\n                              III.
