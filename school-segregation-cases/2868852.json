N.R. claims that the Board's proposed\nplacement failed to provide him with a meaningful\neducational benefit in the least restrictive environment, as\nrequired by the IDEA. The District Court granted summary\njudgment in favor of the Board.\n\nWe affirm the District Court's holding that the Kingwood\nplacement provided N.R. with a sufficient educational\nbenefit to constitute a \"free and appropriate public\neducation.\" However, we vacate the court's holding that the\nKingwood placement constituted the least restrictive\nenvironment, and we remand for a determination of\nwhether the Board failed to consider any appropriate, state-\nqualified alternate placements within a reasonable distance\nof N.R's residence.\n\n                               2\n\n\nI.\n\nN.R. was born on September 7, 1991, and was classified\nas preschool handicapped in 1994. During the summer of\n1996, N.R.'s parents met with Board officials to discuss an\nIndividualized Education Program (\"IEP\") for N.R. for the\n1996-97 school year. The Board's child study team\ndetermined that N.R. had the skills to begin kindergarten in\nthe fall of 1996 and recommended his placement in the\nKingwood School's regular kindergarten program. On\nAugust 2, 1996, however, T.R. and E.M.R. rejected this\nproposed placement, stating that they planned to send N.R.\nto preschool for another year.1\n\nAt that time, Kingwood Township did not offer a regular\npreschool program for non-disabled children. Rather, the\nTownship offered a single, half-day preschool class\ncomposed of half disabled children and half non-disabled\nchildren. The Board drafted a new IEP which provided for\nN.R.'s placement in this class, with afternoon placement in\n\fthe school's resource room. N.R.'s parents rejected this\nproposal and informed the Board that they planned to have\nN.R. spend the next year at the Rainbow Rascals Learning\nCenter (\"Rainbow Rascals\"), a private daycare center that\nN.R. had attended the previous year. At the time, Rainbow\nRascals was not accredited as a preschool by the State of\nNew Jersey or by any independent educational\naccreditation agency. Nevertheless, T.R. and E.M.R.\nrequested that the Board pay for N.R.'s tuition at Rainbow\nRascals and provide supplemental special education\nservices there.\n\nThe Board filed for due process, seeking a determination\nthat its 1996-97 IEP provided N.R. with a free appropriate\npublic education in the least restrictive environment as\nrequired by the IDEA. The Administrative Law Judge found\nthat Kingwood Township's kindergarten program satisfied\nthe IDEA's requirements and that the Board should not be\nliable for the parents' decision to keep N.R. at Rainbow\nRascals.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. N.R. would have turned five the week that school began, and New\nJersey law does not require a parent to enroll a child in kindergarten\nuntil the child has reached the age of six.\n\n                                3\n\n\nIn April 1997, N.R.'s parents filed suit on his behalf in\nDistrict Court. They alleged, inter alia, that the ALJ had\nerred in finding that the Board's proposed IEPs had offered\nN.R. a free appropriate public education in the least\nrestrictive environment. The parties filed cross-motions for\nsummary judgment, and the District Court granted\nsummary judgment in favor of the Board. The District\nCourt found that the 1996-97 IEP (consisting of placement\nin Kingwood's half-day preschool class and resource room)\nprovided N.R. with a free, appropriate public education by\noffering more than a trivial education benefit. See T.R. v.\nKingwood Township Bd. of Educ., 32 F. Supp. 2d 720, 728-\n29 (D.N.J. 1998). The court pointed to testimony by the\nBoard's expert witnesses, Dr. Frances Hobbie and Dr. Leslie\nCallanan, who stated that the Kingwood program would\nmeet N.R.'s educational needs. The court also referenced\nthe testimony of Darlene Johnson, the teacher of the\nKingwood preschool class, who stated that she was familiar\nwith N.R.'s IEP and would work to implement it on a daily\nbasis.\n\nIn addition, the District Court found that the Kingwood\nclass constituted the least restrictive environment for N.R.\nunder the IDEA. See id. at 730. Finally, the court held that\nRainbow Rascals could not be considered as a possible\n\fplacement for N.R. because it was not accredited by the\nstate. See id. at 730-31.\n\nN.R. and his parents appeal, seeking reimbursement for\nN.R.'s tuition at Rainbow Rascals and for his therapy costs\nfor the 1996-97 school year.\n\nWe exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 20 U.S.C.\nS 1415(i)(2). We exercise plenary review of the legal\nstandard applied by the District Court. See Polk v. Central\nSusquehanna Intermediate Unit 16, 853 F.2d 171, 181 (3d\nCir. 1988). However, we must accept the District Court's\nfindings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. See Oberti\nv. Board of Educ. of Borough of Clementon Sch. Dist. , 995\nF.2d 1204, 1220 (3d Cir. 1993).\n\nII.\n\nThe IDEA requires states receiving federal funding under\nthe Act to have \"in effect a policy that ensures all children\n\n                               4\n\n\nwith disabilities the right to a free appropriate public\neducation.\" 20 U.S.C. S1412(1). Where a state fails to\nsatisfy this statutory mandate, parents have a right to\nreimbursement for private school tuition. See Burlington v.\nDepartment of Educ. of Commonwealth of Mass., 471 U.S.\n359, 370 (1985). Appellants argue that the District Court\nerred in finding that the Board's 1996-97 IEP provided N.R.\nwith a free appropriate public education because the Court\napplied an incorrect legal standard and failed to conduct an\nindependent review of the record. We reject this argument.\nAlthough it appears that the District Court did apply an\nincorrect legal standard, it is also apparent that the Board\nintroduced more than sufficient evidence to prove, under\nthe proper standard, that the Kingwood preschool\nplacement provided a free and appropriate education\n(hereinafter \"FAPE\") for N.R.\n\nThe Supreme Court has construed the statute's FAPE\nmandate to require \"education specially designed to meet\nthe unique needs of the handicapped child, supported by\nsuch services as are necessary to permit the child`to\nbenefit' from the instruction.\" Hendrick Hudson Dist. Bd. of\nEduc. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 188-89 (1982). The\neducation provided must \"be sufficient to confer some\neducational benefit upon the handicapped child,\" id. at\n200, although the state is not required to \"maximize the\npotential of handicapped children.\" Id. at 197 n.21. Prior to\nthe District Court's decision in this case, our Court\ninterpreted Rowley to require that an IEP offer \"more than\na trivial or de minimis educational benefit.\" Oberti, 995\n\fF.2d at 1213; see also Polk, 853 F.2d at 179 (IDEA \"calls\nfor more than a trivial educational benefit\"). Specifically, we\nsaid that a satisfactory IEP must provide \"significant\nlearning\" and confer \"meaningful benefit.\" Polk, 853 F.2d at\n182, 184.\n\nThe District Court, in apparent reliance on these\nprecedents, focused its review on \"whether [N.R.'s] IEP was\nsufficient to confer an educational, nontrivial benefit on\nhim,\" and concluded that it was. T.R., 32 F. Supp. 2d at\n728. However, in our most recent explication of the FAPE\nstandard, our Court squarely held that \"[t]he provision of\nmerely `more than a trivial educational benefit' does not\n\n                               5\n\n\nmeet\" the meaningful benefit requirement of Polk.\nRidgewood Bd. of Educ. v. N.E., 172 F.3d 238, 247 (3d Cir.\n1999). By failing to inquire into whether the Board's IEP\nwould confer a meaningful educational benefit on N.R., the\nDistrict Court applied the incorrect legal standard on this\nissue.2\n\nNevertheless, we believe that the evidence on which the\nDistrict Court relied amply satisfies the somewhat more\nstringent \"meaningful benefit\" test. As the District Court\nnoted, both Dr. Callanan and Dr. Hobbie testified to the\nbenefits N.R. would receive from resource-room work in the\nareas of communication and motor skills. (App. 32, 45.) Dr.\nHobbie also noted the educational advantages of the\nKingwood preschool program, including small class size, a\nfull-time aide, and the presence of supplemental staff and\na child study team on premises. (App. 38-39.) Darlene\nJohnson, the teacher of the Kingwood preschool class,\ntestified that she would implement N.R.'s IEP on a daily\nbasis in her class. (App. 34-35.) The District Court's\ndecision to credit this testimony is a finding of fact and is\nentitled to deference in the absence of clear error. See\nOberti, 995 F.2d at 1220. In light of this credible evidence,\nwe believe that the Board satisfied its burden to show that\nN.R. would receive a meaningful educational benefit from\nthe Kingwood preschool program.\n\nAppellants also argue that the District Court failed to give\nadequate consideration to N.R.'s individual potential in\nconcluding that the Kingwood IEP was appropriate. In\nRidgewood, this Court reiterated that the educational\nbenefit of an IEP \"must be gauged in relation to a child's\npotential.\" 172 F.3d at 247 (quoting Polk, 853 F.2d at 185).\nTo fulfill this mandate a district court must\"analyze the\ntype and amount of learning\" of which the student is\ncapable. Ridgewood, 172 F.2d at 248.\n\fContrary to appellants' suggestion, the District Court did\naddress N.R.'s specific needs in its analysis. The Court\nnoted that \"Dr. Frances Hobbie stated that the[Kingwood]\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. Although the District Court did cite to Polk, it explicitly--and\nerroneously--applied a \"more than trivial benefit\" standard. See T.R., 32\nF. Supp. 2d at 728.\n\n                               6\n\n\npreschool program would . . . suit N.R.'s needs,\" and the\nCourt cited to the portion of Dr. Hobbie's testimony that\nspecifically discussed those needs. T.R., 32 F. Supp. 2d at\n728. For example, Dr. Hobbie discussed the specific\nbenefits that N.R. could obtain from resource room work:\n\n       I like some individual attention to the areas of need.\n       . . . I would definitely think that it would be\n       tremendously beneficial for [N.R.] to have some speech\n       language therapy individually . . . certainly in the\n       resource center I would like to see him get some really\n       individual work on speech language.\n\n       As far as the motor component where he has some\n       difficulty, that again could be worked on in that special\n       program.\n\n(App. 45.)\n\nThe District Court also cited Dr. Callanan's testimony, in\nwhich she further addressed N.R.'s specific needs and\ncapabilities. See T.R., 32 F. Supp. 2d at 729. Dr. Callanan\nopined that \"N.R.'s particular difficulties\" did not\nnecessitate a full-day preschool program. (App. 8.) She\nnoted that N.R.'s participation in lunch and recess in the\nKingwood program would provide \"additional time for\nsocialization.\" (App. 8.) She further testified that N.R. would\nbenefit from time in the resource center at Kingwood\nbecause of \"his need for additional time to rehearse skills\"\n(App. 20) and noted that \"N.R.'s motoric [sic] difficulties and\nhis communication difficulties could be greatly benefitted\nby resource center placement.\" (App. 32.) This testimony--\nwhich was referenced by the District Court in support of its\nholding--explicitly assessed the Kingwood IEP in light of\nN.R.'s individual needs and potential.\n\nIn sum, the District Court's failure to enunciate the\ncorrect \"meaningful benefit\" test is not fatal to its\ndetermination that the 1996-97 IEP offered N.R. a free\nappropriate public education. Even under the proper\nstandard, the evidence in the record is more than sufficient\nto support a finding that the Kingwood program would\n\fconfer on N.R. a meaningful educational benefit in light of\nhis individual needs and potential.\n\n                               7\n\n\nIII.\n\nA.\n\nThe IDEA also contains a \"mainstreaming\" component,\nwhich requires states to establish \"procedures to assure\nthat, to the maximum extent appropriate, handicapped\nchildren . . . are educated with children who are not\nhandicapped.\" 20 U.S.C. S 1412(5)(B) (1994).3 We have\ninterpreted this mandate to require that a disabled child be\nplaced in the least restrictive environment (hereinafter\n\"LRE\") that will provide him with a meaningful educational\nbenefit. \"The least restrictive environment is the one that,\nto the greatest extent possible, satisfactorily educates\ndisabled children together with children who are not\ndisabled, in the same school the disabled child would\nattend if the child were not disabled.\" Carlisle Area Sch. v.\nScott P., 62 F.3d 520, 535 (3d Cir. 1995). Appellants\ncontend that the District Court erred in finding that the\nKingwood preschool program was the LRE for N.R. We\nagree with the appellants that the Court failed adequately\nto investigate potential alternative placements, and we\nremand for consideration of this issue.\n\nIn Oberti, this Court adopted a two-part test for assessing\ncompliance with the LRE requirement. First, the Court\nmust determine \"whether education in the regular\nclassroom, with the use of supplementary aids and\nservices, can be achieved satisfactorily.\" Oberti, 995 F.2d at\n1215. Factors the Court should consider in applying this\nprong are: (1) the steps the school district has taken to\naccommodate the child in a regular classroom; (2) the\nchild's ability to receive an educational benefit from regular\neducation; and (3) the effect the disabled child's presence\nhas on the regular classroom. See id. at 1215-17. Second,\nif the Court finds that placement outside of a regular\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. In 1997, Congress amended the IDEA, recodifying the definition of\nleast restrictive environment at 20 U.S.C. S 1412(a)(5)(A) (1998 Supp.)\nand adding a new provision that requires that state special education\nfunding formulas not result in restrictive or segregated placements, see\n20 U.S.C. S 1412(a)(5)(B) (1998 Supp.). Because the Kingwood IEP was\nformulated prior to 1997, the amendments do not apply in this case.\n\n                               8\n\fclassroom is necessary for the child's educational benefit, it\nmust evaluate \"whether the school has mainstreamed the\nchild to the maximum extent appropriate, i.e., whether the\nschool has made efforts to include the child in school\nprograms with nondisabled children whenever possible.\" Id.\nat 1215. These requirements apply to preschool children,\nsee 34 C.F.R. S 300.552, and the Board bears the burden\nof proving compliance with the IDEA's mainstreaming\nrequirement. See Oberti, 995 F.2d at 1215.\n\nB.\n\nThe peculiar facts of this case make a mechanical\napplication of the Oberti test difficult. As the District Court\ncorrectly noted, the Kingwood preschool program\"cannot\nbe described as a typical `regular class,' nor is it a typical\nspecial education class; half of the children in the class are\nhandicapped, and any preschool child living in Kingwood\nTownship may apply to attend the program.\" T.R., 32 F.\nSupp. 2d at 730. Nevertheless, it is clear that the Kingwood\npreschool class is, under the terms of the IDEA, more\nrestrictive than a \"regular,\" fully-mainstreamed preschool\nclass would be. Indeed, the Kingwood program's statement\nof philosophy states that it \"has been designed to meet the\nneeds of Kingwood Township students ages three through\nfive who have an identified disabling condition or a\nmeasurable developmental impairment and who would\nbenefit from special education.\" (App. 100) (emphasis\nadded).\n\nCertainly, the IDEA does not contemplate \"an all-or-\nnothing educational system in which handicapped children\nattend either regular or special education.\" Oberti, 995 F.2d\n1204, 1218 (quoting Daniel R.R. v. State Bd. of Educ., 874\nF.2d 1036, 1050 (5th Cir. 1989)). However, we believe that,\nunder the IDEA's strict mainstreaming requirement, a\nhybrid preschool program like Kingwood's would ordinarily\nprovide the LRE only under two circumstances: first, where\neducation in a regular classroom (with the use of\nsupplementary aids and services) could not be achieved\nsatisfactorily or, second, where a regular classroom is not\navailable within a reasonable commuting distance of the\nchild.\n\n                               9\n\n\nThe record contains no indication that N.R. could not\nhave been educated satisfactorily in a regular classroom.\nIndeed, the Board's own experts admit that N.R.'s\nplacement in Kingwood's regular kindergarten class (which\nwas rejected by the parents) would be fully appropriate.\n(App. 31-32, 40-41, 46-47, 50-51.) Based on this\nundisputed testimony, it seems clear that N.R. could have\n\freceived a meaningful educational benefit from a regular\nclassroom. Moreover, there is no contention that his\nbehavior would have been disruptive to other students.\n\nOf course, a district that does not operate a regular\npreschool program is not required to initiate one simply in\norder to create an LRE opportunity for a disabled child. See\n34 C.F.R. S 300.552, Note (1996). However, the school\ndistrict is required to take into account a continuum of\npossible alternative placement options when formulating an\nIEP, including \"[p]lacing children with disabilities in private\nschool programs for nondisabled preschool children.\" Id.\nUnder these circumstances, the District Court erred in not\ninquiring into whether regular classroom options were\navailable within a reasonable distance to implement N.R.'s\nIEP, and we remand so the District Court may consider this\nquestion.\n\nC.\n\nWe next address the appellants' contention that the\nBoard and the District Court erred specifically in failing to\ninclude Rainbow Rascals in the continuum of available\nprograms. Appellants claim that Rainbow Rascals would\nhave provided N.R. with a free and appropriate public\neducation in the least restrictive environment and that the\nstate's placement of N.R. in the Kingwood preschool\nprogram, rather than in Rainbow Rascals, was in error.\n\nAs a substantive matter, it seems likely that the Rainbow\nRascals program, aside from its lack of accreditation, could\nhave provided N.R. with an FAPE. For example, the Board's\nexperts admitted that N.R. had made substantial gains\nduring his 1995-96 placement at Rainbow Rascals. (App.\n25, 48.) In addition, Rainbow Rascals' classroom was fully\nmainstreamed and thus less restrictive under the IDEA\n\n                               10\n\n\nthan the Kingwood preschool program. Therefore, unless\nthe state was barred from considering Rainbow Rascals on\nits continuum of alternative placements for some other\nreason, the Board would have been required to approve the\nRainbow Rascals placement as the one providing an FAPE\nin the LRE.\n\nNevertheless, we agree with the District Court's\nconclusion that the Board was not required to consider\nplacement in Rainbow Rascals because that program was\nnot properly accredited under New Jersey law. Under 20\nU.S.C. S 1401(a)(18)(D), the \"free and appropriate public\neducation\" required under IDEA must \"meet the standards\nof the State educational agency.\" Although federal\n\fregulations envision placing disabled children in\"regular\"\nprivate school classes, the universe of private programs\nthat a state may consider is at least partly defined by state\nlaw.\n\nUnder the state regulations in place at the time the 1996-\n97 IEP was formulated, New Jersey's program options for\nIDEA placement included \"[a]n approved private school for\nthe handicapped,\" and \"[a]n accredited nonpublic school\nwhich is not specifically approved for the education of\nchildren with educational disabilities.\" N.J.A.C.S 6:28-4.2\n(1997).4 The regulations defined an \"approved private school\nfor the handicapped\" as \"an incorporated entity approved\nby the Department of Education . . . to provide special\neducation and related services to pupils with educational\ndisabilities.\" N.J.A.C. S 6:28-1.3 (1997). It is undisputed\nthat Rainbow Rascals lacked such approval.\n\nThe regulations also permitted placement in a non-\napproved, accredited private school \"with the consent of the\nCommissioner [of Education] or by an order of a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction.\" N.J.A.C. S 6:28-6.5(a) (1997).\nAccreditation under this regulation required \"the on-going,\non-site evaluation of a nonpublic school by a governmental\nor independent educational accreditation agency which is\nbased upon written evaluation criteria that address\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. The sections of the New Jersey Administrative Code dealing with\nspecial education were repealed and recodified as amended in 1998.\nHowever, the pre-amendment regulations govern this case.\n\n                               11\n\n\neducational programs and services, school facilities and\nschool staff.\" N.J.A.C. S 6:28-6.5(b)(1) (1997). Rainbow\nRascals was not accredited as a preschool by any state or\nindependent agency at the time the IEP was formulated,\nand there is no showing that its personnel possessed the\nprofessional certifications and licenses required by N.J.A.C.\nS 6:28-6.5(b)(5). Indeed, Rainbow Rascals' only license at\nthe time was as a daycare center. (App. 119.) Accordingly,\nit was not eligible for placement under this regulation, even\nwith the consent of the state Department of Education.5\n\nBecause Rainbow Rascals was neither approved nor\naccredited as a preschool under New Jersey law, it was\nineligible for placement consideration by the state under\nS 1401(a)(18)(D).6 Accordingly, the Board did not err by\nfailing to consider it when preparing N.R.'s IEP.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. The special education regulations in force in 1996 did contain what\n\fwas apparently a general waiver provision, which provided that\n\"[e]xceptions to the requirements of this chapter shall be [m]ade only\nwith prior written approval of the Department of Education through its\ncounty office . . . for a period not to exceed one year.\" N.J.A.C. S\n6:28-4.6\n(1997). Nevertheless, we do not believe that the IDEA required New\nJersey to make an exception for an unaccredited, unapproved program\nlike Rainbow Rascals. Requiring a state to ignore its substantive\neducational standards by forcing it to make an exception whenever a\nnon-qualifying school provides a somewhat less restrictive environment\nthan an approved school (which also offers the student an FAPE) would\neffectively replace state standards with the federal courts' case-by-case\ndeterminations of educational appropriateness. Such a reading would\nrender S 1401(a)(18)(D) a virtual nullity. As the Supreme Court\nemphasized in Rowley, the IDEA was not intended to \"displace the\nprimacy of states in the field of education\" but rather \"to assist them in\nextending their educational systems to the handicapped.\" 458 U.S. at\n208.\n\n6. The dissent suggests that New Jersey's accreditation requirement was\na mere formality, unconnected to any substantive criteria. This is\nuntrue. The accreditation regulations in effect at the time required,\ninter\n\nalia, that there be ongoing, on-site evaluation of the school by a\ngovernment or independent accreditation agency based on written\nevaluation criteria, see N.J.A.C. S 6:28-6.5(b)(1) (1997); that personnel\nproviding educational or related services hold appropriate educational\ncertifications, see N.J.A.C. S 6:28-6.5(b)(5) (1997); and that the pupil\nreceive a program comparable to that required to be provided by the\n\n                               12\n\n\nD.\n\nFinally, appellants contend that, even if Rainbow Rascals\nwas not an available option for state placement, they are\nnevertheless entitled for reimbursement for their own\nunilateral placement under Florence County School District\nFour v. Carter, 510 U.S. 7 (1993). In Florence, the school\ndistrict proposed a placement which the court found failed\nto provide the child with an FAPE. The parents rejected the\nplacement, and enrolled the child in a private program\nwhich was not on the state's \"approved list,\" but which did\nprovide a substantive FAPE. The Supreme Court held that\nthe parents were entitled to reimbursement even though\nthe school lacked state approval, because the state\nstandards requirement of 20 U.S.C. S 1401(a)(18)(D) applies\nonly to placements made by a public authority. See id. at\n13-14; see also Warren G. v. Cumberland County Sch. Dist.,\n190 F.3d 80 (1999).\n\nFlorence does not require reimbursement for appellants'\n\fRainbow Rascals placement. Both Florence and Warren G.\ninvolved disputes over the FAPE requirement. They did not\naddress the situation we face in this case, where both the\nstate-chosen (accredited) school and the parent-chosen\n(unaccredited) school would provide an FAPE, but where\nthe unaccredited school would arguably provide a less\nrestrictive environment. Extending Florence to these\ncircumstances would require a state to ensure the\nmaximally optimal LRE placement for each child, even if\nsuch a placement is not available in any qualifying school\nwithin a reasonable distance.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\npublic schools under the relevant statutes and regulations, see N.J.A.C.\nS 6:28-6.5(b)(6) (1997). There is no record evidence that Rainbow Rascals\nmet any of these substantive criteria. Moreover, the dissent's contention\nthat \"the State at the relevant point in time was not accrediting private\npreschools\" is without basis in the record. Even if the state had imposed\nsome sort of accreditation moratorium, Rainbow Rascals would still have\nbeen free to qualify for IDEA placement by obtaining accreditation from\na private agency--as it in fact did the following year. In short, there is\nno evidence that New Jersey's accreditation and approval standards were\nbeing used systematically to avoid the state's affirmative obligations\nunder the IDEA.\n\n                                13\n\n\nFlorence's own language forecloses such an\n 537<!>interpretation. Florence gives parents the right to\n\nreimbursement for a unilateral placement in a non-\nqualifying school only \"if a federal court concludes both\nthat the public placement violated IDEA and that the private\nschool placement was proper under the Act.\" Florence, 510\nU.S. at 15 (emphasis added). By its terms, this is a two-\npronged inquiry. The threshold question here focuses on\nthe first prong--viz., whether the Board's proposed\nplacement violated the IDEA by failing to consider Rainbow\nRascals. The parental reimbursement mandate comes into\nplay only if we answer yes to this initial question.\n\nFlorence, while holding that parents are not bound by\nS 1401(a)(18)(B)'s state standards requirement, did not\nsuggest that the state is required--or even permitted--to\noverlook that statutory mandate and consider placements\nthat do not meet its substantive educational standards.\nSuch a reading would go against the plain language of the\nstatute and render the state standards requirement of\nS 1401(a)(18)(D) a nullity. Because we have found that the\nBoard did not err in rejecting Rainbow Rascals as a\npotential placement, we cannot find that the \"public\nplacement violated IDEA\" on these grounds. Of course, if\nthe District Court on remand finds that the Board\n\fimproperly failed to consider other potential placements\nthat met New Jersey's substantive standards (see part\nIII(B), supra), the state may have failed to meet its\nobligations under the IDEA and reimbursement for the\nRainbow Rascals placement may be available under\nFlorence.\n\nIV.\n\nWe affirm the holding of the District Court that the 1996-\n97 Kingwood IEP provided N.R. with an FAPE. We vacate\nthe District Court's holding that the Kingwood placement\nconstituted the least restrictive environment, and remand\nfor additional proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                14\n\n\nSTAPLETON, Circuit Judge, Dissenting:\n\nThe Court concludes that, although \"public agencies that\ndo not operate programs for non-disabled preschool\nchildren are not required to initiate such programs,\" the\nfederal regulations do impose upon them an affirmative\nduty to make all reasonable efforts to find alternatives that\nwill provide the LRE. 34 C.F.R. S 300.552 Note (1987); see\nalso 34 C.F.R. S 300.551. This includes the alternative of\n\"[p]lacing children with disabilities in private school\nprograms for non-disabled preschool children.\" 34 C.F.R.\nS 300.552 Note. I agree.\n\nThe Court also concludes, quite properly, that Rainbow\nRascals was available to provide N.R. with a free and\nappropriate public education in a wholly integrated\nenvironment. It nevertheless relieves the Board of\nEducation of any duty to provide N.R. access to that\neducation because Rainbow Rascals was not \"accredited or\napproved\" under the applicable state regulation at the time\nthe placement decision was made. I would have no quarrel\nwith this holding if the record indicated that Rainbow\nRascals failed to meet educational criteria established by\nthe State. See 20 U.S.C. S 1401(a)(18)(D) (the FRAP required\nunder IDEA must \"meet the standards of the State\neducational agency.\"). The record in this case, however,\ndoes not suggest there are any such criteria that Rainbow\nRascals failed to meet. What the record does affirmatively\nestablish is that the State at the relevant point in time was\nnot accrediting private preschools, and that although state\nlaw provided for a waiver of the \"accredited or approved\"\nrequirement, see N.J. Admin. Code S 6:28-4.6 (Supp. 1994),\nno request for a waiver was made.1 If a state can so easily\navoid its affirmative duty to provide a free and appropriate\npublic education in the least restrictive environment, the\npromise of the IDEA will be illusory for many. For that\n\freason, I respectfully dissent. I would reverse and remand\nwith instructions to grant tuition reimbursement.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1.

N.R. claims that the Board's proposed\nplacement failed to provide him with a meaningful\neducational benefit in the least restrictive environment, as\nrequired by the IDEA. The District Court granted summary\njudgment in favor of the Board.\n\nWe affirm the District Court's holding that the Kingwood\nplacement provided N.R. with a sufficient educational\nbenefit to constitute a \"free and appropriate public\neducation.\" However, we vacate the court's holding that the\nKingwood placement constituted the least restrictive\nenvironment, and we remand for a determination of\nwhether the Board failed to consider any appropriate, state-\nqualified alternate placements within a reasonable distance\nof N.R's residence.\n\n                               2\n\n\nI.\n\nN.R. was born on September 7, 1991, and was classified\nas preschool handicapped in 1994. During the summer of\n1996, N.R.'s parents met with Board officials to discuss an\nIndividualized Education Program (\"IEP\") for N.R. for the\n1996-97 school year. The Board's child study team\ndetermined that N.R. had the skills to begin kindergarten in\nthe fall of 1996 and recommended his placement in the\nKingwood School's regular kindergarten program. On\nAugust 2, 1996, however, T.R. and E.M.R. rejected this\nproposed placement, stating that they planned to send N.R.\nto preschool for another year.1\n\nAt that time, Kingwood Township did not offer a regular\npreschool program for non-disabled children. Rather, the\nTownship offered a single, half-day preschool class\ncomposed of half disabled children and half non-disabled\nchildren. The Board drafted a new IEP which provided for\nN.R.'s placement in this class, with afternoon placement in\n\fthe school's resource room. N.R.'s parents rejected this\nproposal and informed the Board that they planned to have\nN.R. spend the next year at the Rainbow Rascals Learning\nCenter (\"Rainbow Rascals\"), a private daycare center that\nN.R. had attended the previous year. At the time, Rainbow\nRascals was not accredited as a preschool by the State of\nNew Jersey or by any independent educational\naccreditation agency. Nevertheless, T.R. and E.M.R.\nrequested that the Board pay for N.R.'s tuition at Rainbow\nRascals and provide supplemental special education\nservices there.\n\nThe Board filed for due process, seeking a determination\nthat its 1996-97 IEP provided N.R. with a free appropriate\npublic education in the least restrictive environment as\nrequired by the IDEA. The Administrative Law Judge found\nthat Kingwood Township's kindergarten program satisfied\nthe IDEA's requirements and that the Board should not be\nliable for the parents' decision to keep N.R. at Rainbow\nRascals.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. N.R. would have turned five the week that school began, and New\nJersey law does not require a parent to enroll a child in kindergarten\nuntil the child has reached the age of six.\n\n                                3\n\n\nIn April 1997, N.R.'s parents filed suit on his behalf in\nDistrict Court. They alleged, inter alia, that the ALJ had\nerred in finding that the Board's proposed IEPs had offered\nN.R. a free appropriate public education in the least\nrestrictive environment. The parties filed cross-motions for\nsummary judgment, and the District Court granted\nsummary judgment in favor of the Board. The District\nCourt found that the 1996-97 IEP (consisting of placement\nin Kingwood's half-day preschool class and resource room)\nprovided N.R. with a free, appropriate public education by\noffering more than a trivial education benefit.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">720</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 728-\n29 (D.N.J. 1998). The court pointed to testimony by the\nBoard's expert witnesses, Dr. Frances Hobbie and Dr. Leslie\nCallanan, who stated that the Kingwood program would\nmeet N.R.'s educational needs. The court also referenced\nthe testimony of Darlene Johnson, the teacher of the\nKingwood preschool class, who stated that she was familiar\nwith N.R.'s IEP and would work to implement it on a daily\nbasis.\n\nIn addition, the District Court found that the Kingwood\nclass constituted the least restrictive environment for N.R.\nunder the IDEA. See id. at 730. Finally, the court held that\nRainbow Rascals could not be considered as a possible\n\fplacement for N.R. because it was not accredited by the\nstate. See id. at 730-31.\n\nN.R. and his parents appeal, seeking reimbursement for\nN.R.'s tuition at Rainbow Rascals and for his therapy costs\nfor the 1996-97 school year.\n\nWe exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 20 U.S.C.\nS 1415(i)(2).

S1412(1). Where a state fails to\nsatisfy this statutory mandate, parents have a right to\nreimbursement for private school tuition. See Burlington v.\nDepartment of Educ. of Commonwealth of Mass., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111420\"><a href=\"/opinion/111420/burlington-school-comm-v-mass-dept-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">359</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 370 (1985). Appellants argue that the District Court\nerred in finding that the Board's 1996-97 IEP provided N.R.\nwith a free appropriate public education because the Court\napplied an incorrect legal standard and failed to conduct an\nindependent review of the record. We reject this argument.\nAlthough it appears that the District Court did apply an\nincorrect legal standard, it is also apparent that the Board\nintroduced more than sufficient evidence to prove, under\nthe proper standard, that the Kingwood preschool\nplacement provided a free and appropriate education\n(hereinafter \"FAPE\") for N.R.\n\nThe Supreme Court has construed the statute's FAPE\nmandate to require \"education specially designed to meet\nthe unique needs of the handicapped child, supported by\nsuch services as are necessary to permit the child`to\nbenefit' from the instruction.\" Hendrick Hudson Dist. Bd. of\nEduc. v. Rowley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110774\"><a href=\"/opinion/110774/hendrick-hudson-dist-bd-of-ed-v-rowley/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 188-89 (1982). The\neducation provided must \"be sufficient to confer some\neducational benefit upon the handicapped child,\" id. at\n200, although the state is not required to \"maximize the\npotential of handicapped children.\" Id. at 197 n.21. Prior to\nthe District Court's decision in this case, our Court\ninterpreted Rowley to require that an IEP offer \"more than\na trivial or de minimis educational benefit.\" Oberti, 995\n\fF.2d at 1213; see also Polk, 853 F.2d at 179 (IDEA \"calls\nfor more than a trivial educational benefit\"). Specifically, we\nsaid that a satisfactory IEP must provide \"significant\nlearning\" and confer \"meaningful benefit.\" Polk, 853 F.2d at\n182, 184.\n\nThe District Court, in apparent reliance on these\nprecedents, focused its review on \"whether [N.R.'s] IEP was\nsufficient to confer an educational, nontrivial benefit on\nhim,\" and concluded that it was. T.R., 32 F. Supp. 2d at\n728. However, in our most recent explication of the FAPE\nstandard, our Court squarely held that \"[t]he provision of\nmerely `more than a trivial educational benefit' does not\n\n                               5\n\n\nmeet\" the meaningful benefit requirement of Polk.\nRidgewood Bd. of Educ. v. N.E., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762759\"><a href=\"/opinion/762759/ridgewood-board-of-education-v-ne-as-guardian-ad-litem-for-me-an/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 247 (3d Cir.\n1999). By failing to inquire into whether the Board's IEP\nwould confer a meaningful educational benefit on N.R., the\nDistrict Court applied the incorrect legal standard on this\nissue.2\n\nNevertheless, we believe that the evidence on which the\nDistrict Court relied amply satisfies the somewhat more\nstringent \"meaningful benefit\" test. As the District Court\nnoted, both Dr. Callanan and Dr. Hobbie testified to the\nbenefits N.R. would receive from resource-room work in the\nareas of communication and motor skills. (App. 32, 45.) Dr.\nHobbie also noted the educational advantages of the\nKingwood preschool program, including small class size, a\nfull-time aide, and the presence of supplemental staff and\na child study team on premises. (App. 38-39.) Darlene\nJohnson, the teacher of the Kingwood preschool class,\ntestified that she would implement N.R.'s IEP on a daily\nbasis in her class. (App. 34-35.) The District Court's\ndecision to credit this testimony is a finding of fact and is\nentitled to deference in the absence of clear error. See\nOberti, 995 F.2d at 1220. In light of this credible evidence,\nwe believe that the Board satisfied its burden to show that\nN.R. would receive a meaningful educational benefit from\nthe Kingwood preschool program.\n\nAppellants also argue that the District Court failed to give\nadequate consideration to N.R.'s individual potential in\nconcluding that the Kingwood IEP was appropriate. In\nRidgewood, this Court reiterated that the educational\nbenefit of an IEP \"must be gauged in relation to a child's\npotential.\" 172 F.3d at 247 (quoting Polk, 853 F.2d at 185).\nTo fulfill this mandate a district court must\"analyze the\ntype and amount of learning\" of which the student is\ncapable. Ridgewood, 172 F.2d at 248.\n\fContrary to appellants' suggestion, the District Court did\naddress N.R.'s specific needs in its analysis. The Court\nnoted that \"Dr. Frances Hobbie stated that the[Kingwood]\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. Although the District Court did cite to Polk, it explicitly--and\nerroneously--applied a \"more than trivial benefit\" standard. See T.R., 32\nF.

T.R., 32 F. Supp. 2d at\n728. For example, Dr. Hobbie discussed the specific\nbenefits that N.R. could obtain from resource room work:\n\n       I like some individual attention to the areas of need.\n       . . . I would definitely think that it would be\n       tremendously beneficial for [N.R.] to have some speech\n       language therapy individually . . . certainly in the\n       resource center I would like to see him get some really\n       individual work on speech language.\n\n       As far as the motor component where he has some\n       difficulty, that again could be worked on in that special\n       program.\n\n(App. 45.)\n\nThe District Court also cited Dr. Callanan's testimony, in\nwhich she further addressed N.R.'s specific needs and\ncapabilities. See T.R., 32 F. Supp. 2d at 729. Dr. Callanan\nopined that \"N.R.'s particular difficulties\" did not\nnecessitate a full-day preschool program. (App. 8.) She\nnoted that N.R.'s participation in lunch and recess in the\nKingwood program would provide \"additional time for\nsocialization.\" (App. 8.) She further testified that N.R. would\nbenefit from time in the resource center at Kingwood\nbecause of \"his need for additional time to rehearse skills\"\n(App. 20) and noted that \"N.R.'s motoric [sic] difficulties and\nhis communication difficulties could be greatly benefitted\nby resource center placement.\" (App. 32.) This testimony--\nwhich was referenced by the District Court in support of its\nholding--explicitly assessed the Kingwood IEP in light of\nN.R.'s individual needs and potential.\n\nIn sum, the District Court's failure to enunciate the\ncorrect \"meaningful benefit\" test is not fatal to its\ndetermination that the 1996-97 IEP offered N.R. a free\nappropriate public education. Even under the proper\nstandard, the evidence in the record is more than sufficient\nto support a finding that the Kingwood program would\n\fconfer on N.R. a meaningful educational benefit in light of\nhis individual needs and potential.\n\n                               7\n\n\nIII.\n\nA.\n\nThe IDEA also contains a \"mainstreaming\" component,\nwhich requires states to establish \"procedures to assure\nthat, to the maximum extent appropriate, handicapped\nchildren . . . are educated with children who are not\nhandicapped.\" 20 U.S.C. S 1412(5)(B) (1994).3 We have\ninterpreted this mandate to require that a disabled child be\nplaced in the least restrictive environment (hereinafter\n\"LRE\") that will provide him with a meaningful educational\nbenefit. \"The least restrictive environment is the one that,\nto the greatest extent possible, satisfactorily educates\ndisabled children together with children who are not\ndisabled, in the same school the disabled child would\nattend if the child were not disabled.\" Carlisle Area Sch. v.\nScott P., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"701744\"><a href=\"/opinion/701744/carlisle-area-school-v-scott-p-by-and-through-his-guardians-bess-p-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 535 (3d Cir. 1995). Appellants\ncontend that the District Court erred in finding that the\nKingwood preschool program was the LRE for N.R. We\nagree with the appellants that the Court failed adequately\nto investigate potential alternative placements, and we\nremand for consideration of this issue.\n\nIn Oberti, this Court adopted a two-part test for assessing\ncompliance with the LRE requirement. First, the Court\nmust determine \"whether education in the regular\nclassroom, with the use of supplementary aids and\nservices, can be achieved satisfactorily.\" Oberti, 995 F.2d at\n1215. Factors the Court should consider in applying this\nprong are: (1) the steps the school district has taken to\naccommodate the child in a regular classroom; (2) the\nchild's ability to receive an educational benefit from regular\neducation; and (3) the effect the disabled child's presence\nhas on the regular classroom. See id. at 1215-17. Second,\nif the Court finds that placement outside of a regular\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. In 1997, Congress amended the IDEA, recodifying the definition of\nleast restrictive environment at 20 U.S.C. S 1412(a)(5)(A) (1998 Supp.)\nand adding a new provision that requires that state special education\nfunding formulas not result in restrictive or segregated placements, see\n20 U.S.C. S 1412(a)(5)(B) (1998 Supp.). Because the Kingwood IEP was\nformulated prior to 1997, the amendments do not apply in this case.\n\n                               8\n\fclassroom is necessary for the child's educational benefit, it\nmust evaluate \"whether the school has mainstreamed the\nchild to the maximum extent appropriate, i.e., whether the\nschool has made efforts to include the child in school\nprograms with nondisabled children whenever possible.\" Id.\nat 1215. These requirements apply to preschool children,\nsee 34 C.F.R. S 300.552, and the Board bears the burden\nof proving compliance with the IDEA's mainstreaming\nrequirement. See Oberti, 995 F.2d at 1215.\n\nB.\n\nThe peculiar facts of this case make a mechanical\napplication of the Oberti test difficult. As the District Court\ncorrectly noted, the Kingwood preschool program\"cannot\nbe described as a typical `regular class,' nor is it a typical\nspecial education class; half of the children in the class are\nhandicapped, and any preschool child living in Kingwood\nTownship may apply to attend the program.\" T.R., 32 F.\nSupp. 2d at 730. Nevertheless, it is clear that the Kingwood\npreschool class is, under the terms of the IDEA, more\nrestrictive than a \"regular,\" fully-mainstreamed preschool\nclass would be. Indeed, the Kingwood program's statement\nof philosophy states that it \"has been designed to meet the\nneeds of Kingwood Township students ages three through\nfive who have an identified disabling condition or a\nmeasurable developmental impairment and who would\nbenefit from special education.\" (App. 100) (emphasis\nadded).\n\nCertainly, the IDEA does not contemplate \"an all-or-\nnothing educational system in which handicapped children\nattend either regular or special education.\" Oberti, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609180\"><a href=\"/opinion/609180/rafael-oberti-by-his-parents-and-next-friends-carlos-and-jeanne-oberti/\"><span class=\"volume\">995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1204</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1218 (quoting Daniel R.R. v. State Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"523168\"><a href=\"/opinion/523168/daniel-rr-v-state-board-of-education-el-paso-independent-school/\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1036</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1050 (5th Cir. 1989)). However, we believe that,\nunder the IDEA's strict mainstreaming requirement, a\nhybrid preschool program like Kingwood's would ordinarily\nprovide the LRE only under two circumstances: first, where\neducation in a regular classroom (with the use of\nsupplementary aids and services) could not be achieved\nsatisfactorily or, second, where a regular classroom is not\navailable within a reasonable commuting distance of the\nchild.\n\n                               9\n\n\nThe record contains no indication that N.R. could not\nhave been educated satisfactorily in a regular classroom.\nIndeed, the Board's own experts admit that N.R.'s\nplacement in Kingwood's regular kindergarten class (which\nwas rejected by the parents) would be fully appropriate.\n(App. 31-32, 40-41, 46-47, 50-51.) Based on this\nundisputed testimony, it seems clear that N.R. could have\n\freceived a meaningful educational benefit from a regular\nclassroom. Moreover, there is no contention that his\nbehavior would have been disruptive to other students.\n\nOf course, a district that does not operate a regular\npreschool program is not required to initiate one simply in\norder to create an LRE opportunity for a disabled child. See\n34 C.F.R. S 300.552, Note (1996). However, the school\ndistrict is required to take into account a continuum of\npossible alternative placement options when formulating an\nIEP, including \"[p]lacing children with disabilities in private\nschool programs for nondisabled preschool children.\" Id.\nUnder these circumstances, the District Court erred in not\ninquiring into whether regular classroom options were\navailable within a reasonable distance to implement N.R.'s\nIEP, and we remand so the District Court may consider this\nquestion.\n\nC.\n\nWe next address the appellants' contention that the\nBoard and the District Court erred specifically in failing to\ninclude Rainbow Rascals in the continuum of available\nprograms. Appellants claim that Rainbow Rascals would\nhave provided N.R. with a free and appropriate public\neducation in the least restrictive environment and that the\nstate's placement of N.R. in the Kingwood preschool\nprogram, rather than in Rainbow Rascals, was in error.\n\nAs a substantive matter, it seems likely that the Rainbow\nRascals program, aside from its lack of accreditation, could\nhave provided N.R. with an FAPE. For example, the Board's\nexperts admitted that N.R. had made substantial gains\nduring his 1995-96 placement at Rainbow Rascals. (App.\n25, 48.) In addition, Rainbow Rascals' classroom was fully\nmainstreamed and thus less restrictive under the IDEA\n\n                               10\n\n\nthan the Kingwood preschool program. Therefore, unless\nthe state was barred from considering Rainbow Rascals on\nits continuum of alternative placements for some other\nreason, the Board would have been required to approve the\nRainbow Rascals placement as the one providing an FAPE\nin the LRE.\n\nNevertheless, we agree with the District Court's\nconclusion that the Board was not required to consider\nplacement in Rainbow Rascals because that program was\nnot properly accredited under New Jersey law. Under 20\nU.S.C. S 1401(a)(18)(D), the \"free and appropriate public\neducation\" required under IDEA must \"meet the standards\nof the State educational agency.\" Although federal\n\fregulations envision placing disabled children in\"regular\"\nprivate school classes, the universe of private programs\nthat a state may consider is at least partly defined by state\nlaw.\n\nUnder the state regulations in place at the time the 1996-\n97 IEP was formulated, New Jersey's program options for\nIDEA placement included \"[a]n approved private school for\nthe handicapped,\" and \"[a]n accredited nonpublic school\nwhich is not specifically approved for the education of\nchildren with educational disabilities.\" N.J.A.C.S 6:28-4.2\n(1997).4 The regulations defined an \"approved private school\nfor the handicapped\" as \"an incorporated entity approved\nby the Department of Education . . . to provide special\neducation and related services to pupils with educational\ndisabilities.\" N.J.A.C. S 6:28-1.3 (1997). It is undisputed\nthat Rainbow Rascals lacked such approval.\n\nThe regulations also permitted placement in a non-\napproved, accredited private school \"with the consent of the\nCommissioner [of Education] or by an order of a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction.\" N.J.A.C. S 6:28-6.5(a) (1997).\nAccreditation under this regulation required \"the on-going,\non-site evaluation of a nonpublic school by a governmental\nor independent educational accreditation agency which is\nbased upon written evaluation criteria that address\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. The sections of the New Jersey Administrative Code dealing with\nspecial education were repealed and recodified as amended in 1998.\nHowever, the pre-amendment regulations govern this case.\n\n                               11\n\n\neducational programs and services, school facilities and\nschool staff.\" N.J.A.C. S 6:28-6.5(b)(1) (1997). Rainbow\nRascals was not accredited as a preschool by any state or\nindependent agency at the time the IEP was formulated,\nand there is no showing that its personnel possessed the\nprofessional certifications and licenses required by N.J.A.C.\nS 6:28-6.5(b)(5). Indeed, Rainbow Rascals' only license at\nthe time was as a daycare center. (App. 119.) Accordingly,\nit was not eligible for placement under this regulation, even\nwith the consent of the state Department of Education.5\n\nBecause Rainbow Rascals was neither approved nor\naccredited as a preschool under New Jersey law, it was\nineligible for placement consideration by the state under\nS 1401(a)(18)(D).6 Accordingly, the Board did not err by\nfailing to consider it when preparing N.R.'s IEP.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. The special education regulations in force in 1996 did contain what\n\fwas apparently a general waiver provision, which provided that\n\"[e]xceptions to the requirements of this chapter shall be [m]ade only\nwith prior written approval of the Department of Education through its\ncounty office . . . for a period not to exceed one year.\" N.J.A.C. S\n6:28-4.6\n(1997). Nevertheless, we do not believe that the IDEA required New\nJersey to make an exception for an unaccredited, unapproved program\nlike Rainbow Rascals. Requiring a state to ignore its substantive\neducational standards by forcing it to make an exception whenever a\nnon-qualifying school provides a somewhat less restrictive environment\nthan an approved school (which also offers the student an FAPE) would\neffectively replace state standards with the federal courts' case-by-case\ndeterminations of educational appropriateness. Such a reading would\nrender S 1401(a)(18)(D) a virtual nullity. As the Supreme Court\nemphasized in Rowley, the IDEA was not intended to \"displace the\nprimacy of states in the field of education\" but rather \"to assist them in\nextending their educational systems to the handicapped.\" 458 U.S. at\n208.\n\n6. The dissent suggests that New Jersey's accreditation requirement was\na mere formality, unconnected to any substantive criteria. This is\nuntrue. The accreditation regulations in effect at the time required,\ninter\n\nalia, that there be ongoing, on-site evaluation of the school by a\ngovernment or independent accreditation agency based on written\nevaluation criteria, see N.J.A.C. S 6:28-6.5(b)(1) (1997); that personnel\nproviding educational or related services hold appropriate educational\ncertifications, see N.J.A.C. S 6:28-6.5(b)(5) (1997); and that the pupil\nreceive a program comparable to that required to be provided by the\n\n                               12\n\n\nD.\n\nFinally, appellants contend that, even if Rainbow Rascals\nwas not an available option for state placement, they are\nnevertheless entitled for reimbursement for their own\nunilateral placement under Florence County School District\nFour v. Carter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112910\"><a href=\"/opinion/112910/florence-county-school-dist-four-v-carter/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993). In Florence, the school\ndistrict proposed a placement which the court found failed\nto provide the child with an FAPE. The parents rejected the\nplacement, and enrolled the child in a private program\nwhich was not on the state's \"approved list,\" but which did\nprovide a substantive FAPE. The Supreme Court held that\nthe parents were entitled to reimbursement even though\nthe school lacked state approval, because the state\nstandards requirement of 20 U.S.C. S 1401(a)(18)(D) applies\nonly to placements made by a public authority. See id. at\n13-14; see also Warren G. v. Cumberland County Sch. Dist.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765990\"><a href=\"/opinion/765990/warren-g-grant-g-by-and-through-their-parents-and-nearest-friends-tom/\"><span class=\"volume\">190</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1999).\n\nFlorence does not require reimbursement for appellants'\n\fRainbow Rascals placement. Both Florence and Warren G.\ninvolved disputes over the FAPE requirement. They did not\naddress the situation we face in this case, where both the\nstate-chosen (accredited) school and the parent-chosen\n(unaccredited) school would provide an FAPE, but where\nthe unaccredited school would arguably provide a less\nrestrictive environment. Extending Florence to these\ncircumstances would require a state to ensure the\nmaximally optimal LRE placement for each child, even if\nsuch a placement is not available in any qualifying school\nwithin a reasonable distance.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\npublic schools under the relevant statutes and regulations, see N.J.A.C.\nS 6:28-6.5(b)(6) (1997). There is no record evidence that Rainbow Rascals\nmet any of these substantive criteria. Moreover, the dissent's contention\nthat \"the State at the relevant point in time was not accrediting private\npreschools\" is without basis in the record. Even if the state had imposed\nsome sort of accreditation moratorium, Rainbow Rascals would still have\nbeen free to qualify for IDEA placement by obtaining accreditation from\na private agency--as it in fact did the following year. In short, there is\nno evidence that New Jersey's accreditation and approval standards were\nbeing used systematically to avoid the state's affirmative obligations\nunder the IDEA.\n\n                                13\n\n\nFlorence's own language forecloses such an\n 537<!>interpretation. Florence gives parents the right to\n\nreimbursement for a unilateral placement in a non-\nqualifying school only \"if a federal court concludes both\nthat the public placement violated IDEA and that the private\nschool placement was proper under the Act.\" Florence, 510\nU.S. at 15 (emphasis added). By its terms, this is a two-\npronged inquiry. The threshold question here focuses on\nthe first prong--viz., whether the Board's proposed\nplacement violated the IDEA by failing to consider Rainbow\nRascals. The parental reimbursement mandate comes into\nplay only if we answer yes to this initial question.\n\nFlorence, while holding that parents are not bound by\nS 1401(a)(18)(B)'s state standards requirement, did not\nsuggest that the state is required--or even permitted--to\noverlook that statutory mandate and consider placements\nthat do not meet its substantive educational standards.\nSuch a reading would go against the plain language of the\nstatute and render the state standards requirement of\nS 1401(a)(18)(D) a nullity. Because we have found that the\nBoard did not err in rejecting Rainbow Rascals as a\npotential placement, we cannot find that the \"public\nplacement violated IDEA\" on these grounds. Of course, if\nthe District Court on remand finds that the Board\n\fimproperly failed to consider other potential placements\nthat met New Jersey's substantive standards (see part\nIII(B), supra), the state may have failed to meet its\nobligations under the IDEA and reimbursement for the\nRainbow Rascals placement may be available under\nFlorence.\n\nIV.\n\nWe affirm the holding of the District Court that the 1996-\n97 Kingwood IEP provided N.R. with an FAPE. We vacate\nthe District Court's holding that the Kingwood placement\nconstituted the least restrictive environment, and remand\nfor additional proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                14\n\n\nSTAPLETON, Circuit Judge, Dissenting:\n\nThe Court concludes that, although \"public agencies that\ndo not operate programs for non-disabled preschool\nchildren are not required to initiate such programs,\" the\nfederal regulations do impose upon them an affirmative\nduty to make all reasonable efforts to find alternatives that\nwill provide the LRE. 34 C.F.R. S 300.552 Note (1987); see\nalso 34 C.F.R. S 300.551. This includes the alternative of\n\"[p]lacing children with disabilities in private school\nprograms for non-disabled preschool children.\" 34 C.F.R.\nS 300.552 Note. I agree.\n\nThe Court also concludes, quite properly, that Rainbow\nRascals was available to provide N.R. with a free and\nappropriate public education in a wholly integrated\nenvironment. It nevertheless relieves the Board of\nEducation of any duty to provide N.R. access to that\neducation because Rainbow Rascals was not \"accredited or\napproved\" under the applicable state regulation at the time\nthe placement decision was made. I would have no quarrel\nwith this holding if the record indicated that Rainbow\nRascals failed to meet educational criteria established by\nthe State. See 20 U.S.C. S 1401(a)(18)(D) (the FRAP required\nunder IDEA must \"meet the standards of the State\neducational agency.\"). The record in this case, however,\ndoes not suggest there are any such criteria that Rainbow\nRascals failed to meet. What the record does affirmatively\nestablish is that the State at the relevant point in time was\nnot accrediting private preschools, and that although state\nlaw provided for a waiver of the \"accredited or approved\"\nrequirement, see N.J. Admin. Code S 6:28-4.6 (Supp. 1994),\nno request for a waiver was made.1 If a state can so easily\navoid its affirmative duty to provide a free and appropriate\npublic education in the least restrictive environment, the\npromise of the IDEA will be illusory for many. For that\n\freason, I respectfully dissent. I would reverse and remand\nwith instructions to grant tuition reimbursement.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. In addition to placement in accredited private schools, state law also\nauthorized placement in preschools \"in approved facilities.\" N.J. Admin.\nCode S 6:28-1.1(e)(3) (Supp. 1994). The record does not reflect, however,\nthat the State maintained any list of preschools in\"approved facilities.\"\n\n                               15\n\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               16\n\f</pre>",
