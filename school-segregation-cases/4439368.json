Appellant Sandra Saks is referred to as “Sandra.”\n\nAppellant Margaret Landen Saks is referred to as “Landen.” Appellant Lee\n\nNick McFadin III is referred to as “McFadin.” Collectively, Sandra, Landen,\n\nand McFadin are referred to as the “Saks Parties.” Appellee Broadway\n\nCoffeehouse, LLC is referred to as “Coffeehouse.”        Appellee Marcus\n\nRogers, as Trustee for the Saks Children Trust a/k/a ATFL&L is referred to\n\nas the “Trust.”\n\n      The Clerk’s Record.     The two-volume Clerk’s Record is cited as\n\nCR1 [page] and CR2 [page].       Key items from the Clerk’s Record are\n\nincluded in the Appendix attached to this brief and referenced as Appendix,\n\ntab [number].\n\n      The Reporter’s Record. There are three Reporter’s Records filed in\n\nthis appeal. The Reporter’s Record from the August 19, 2014 hearing on\n\nCoffeehouse’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment was filed on October\n\n22, 2014, but is not referenced herein, as it is not proper summary\n\njudgment evidence. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c); Hollywood Park Humane\n\nSoc. v. Town of Hollywood Park, 261 S.W.3d 135, 139 n. 2 (Tex. App.—\n\nSan Antonio 2008, no pet.) The Reporter’s Record from the October 31,\n\n2014 hearing on the Saks Parties’ Motion to Suspend and Supersede\n\n\n\n                                    1\n\fJudgment and to Set the Amount of Supersedeas Bond was filed on\n\nNovember 14, 2014, and is cited as Nov. RR [page]:[line]. The Reporter’s\n\nRecord from the October 20, 2014 trial on the merits was filed on\n\nDecember 19, 2014, and is cited as Dec. RR [page]:[line].\n\n                      STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n      Some of the underlying circumstances of this case are already\n\nreported in this Court’s opinion in Davis v. Merriman, No. 04-13-00518-CV,\n\n2015 WL 1004357 (Tex. App.—San Antonio March 4, 2015, no pet. hist.),\n\nwhich involved a dispute over the Trust and its various properties. At the\n\ncenter of this lawsuit is a property in which the Trust owns an interest, a\n\ncommercial building located at 5321 Broadway, San Antonio, Texas, and\n\nits adjoining parking lot (the “Property”), more specifically described as\n\nfollows:\n\n           Lot Four (4), Block Thirty-Three (33), Alamo\n           Heights, City of Alamo Heights, Situated in Bexar\n           County, Texas, according to Plat thereof Recorded\n           in Volume 105, Pages 29-296, Deed and Plat\n           Records of Bexar County, Texas.\n\nCR2 134; Appendix, tab 18. The side of the Property facing Broadway is\n\noccupied by Starbucks, and the other side is occupied by Nix Health Care\n\nSystem. Coffeehouse and the Trust are joint owners of the Property, and\n\n\n\n\n                                    2\n\fare also joint owners of 5321 Broadway Partners (the “Partnership”), the\n\nentity which manages and holds equitable title to the Property.\n\n     Due to contentious litigation involving the Trust and the Saks Parties,\n\nand the Saks Parties’ absurd persistence in making claims against the\n\nProperty and Partnership, in spite of court orders rejecting their claims,\n\nCoffeehouse found it no longer practicable or desirable to be in business\n\nwith the Trust. Coffeehouse filed this suit on October 10, 2013, seeking\n\ndeclaratory judgment to invalidate the Saks Parties’ claims against the\n\nProperty and the Partnership, to partition the Property, and to wind up and\n\nterminate the Partnership. CR1 1. Coffeehouse filed its First Amended\n\nPetition on June 9, 2014. CR1 84; Appendix, tab 1.\n\n     On August 19, 2014, the Trial Court (the Honorable Larry Noll)\n\nentered a Partial Summary Judgment in this case declaring that\n\nCoffeehouse and the Trust own the Property and the Partnership; declaring\n\nthat the Saks Parties, as well as other parties, own no interest in the\n\nProperty or the Partnership; declaring that certain assignments and deeds\n\npertaining to the Property and the Partnership are void and of no force or\n\neffect; and ordering partition of the Property by sale, and the winding-up\n\nand termination of the Partnership. CR2 369; Appendix, tab 8.\n\n\n\n\n                                     3\n\f     On September 16, 2014, the Trust filed its Crossclaim in this case,\n\njoining in and asserting the same claims asserted by Coffeehouse against\n\nSandra and McFadin. CR2 373.\n\n     On October 20, 2014, the parties appeared for non-jury trial on the\n\nsole issue of attorney’s fees, and the Court entered a final Judgment,\n\nincorporating the previous Partial Summary Judgment.            CR2 437;\n\nAppendix, tab 9. The Trial Court (the Honorable Antonia Arteaga) awarded\n\nattorney’s fees to Coffeehouse and the Trust against the Saks Parties\n\njointly and severally.   CR2 437.   Immediately after the Judgment was\n\nentered on October 20, 2014, the Saks Parties filed their Notice of Appeal.\n\nCR2 434.\n\n     Prior to trial, on October 15, 2014, the Saks Parties had filed a\n\npremature Motion to Suspend and Supersede Judgment and to Set the\n\nAmount of Supersedeas Bond. CR2 397. The day following the trial, on\n\nOctober 21, 2014, the Saks Parties filed an Amended Motion to Suspend\n\nand Supersede Judgment and to Set the Amount of Supersedeas Bond.\n\nCR2 444. Coffeehouse responded on October 31, 2014, and a hearing\n\nwas held that same day. CR2 459. The Trial Court (the Honorable Antonia\n\nArteaga) entered an Order dated October 31, 2014, setting the amount of\n\nthe supersedeas bond at $170,237.76. CR2 457. On November 3, 2014,\n\n\n\n                                    4\n\fthe Saks Parties filed a Motion to Suspend the Judgment and to Review\n\nOrder Setting the Amount of Supersedeas Bond in this Court, which was\n\ndenied on November 7, 2014. Appendix, tabs 12 and 13. On November\n\n17, 2014, the Saks Parties filed a Motion to Reconsider En Banc Motion to\n\nSuspend the Judgment and to Review Order Setting the Amount of\n\nSupersedeas Bond, which this Court also denied on November 21, 2014.\n\nAppendix, tabs 14 and 15.\n\n                STATEMENT REGARDING ORAL ARGUMENT\n\n     Coffeehouse and the Trust request oral argument only if the Court\n\ngrants oral argument to the Saks Parties. The Saks Parties have filed a\n\ndisjointed and conclusory brief, which does not properly present the issues\n\nfor this Court’s review. The Saks Parties’ Issue Nos. 1(A) and 1(B) are\n\nunpreserved arguments that are unsupported by citations to the record or\n\nproper legal authority. Such arguments are not properly before this Court\n\nand have been waived. The Saks Parties’ Issue No. 3 is moot because it\n\nhas already been decided by this Court, the Saks Parties failed to seek\n\nfurther review in the Supreme Court, and this Court lacks further jurisdiction\n\nto consider it. The only issue that is arguably before this Court is the Saks\n\nParties’ Issue No. 2 regarding whether the Trial Court abused its discretion\n\n\n\n\n                                      5\n\fin awarding attorney’s fees. This issue is straightforward, and does not\n\nrequire oral argument.\n\n                                ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n     ISSUE NO. 1(a): Do the Saks Parties’ Issues Nos. 1(A) and\n                     (B) present anything for this Court’s\n                     review?\n\n     ISSUE NO. 1(b): Did the Saks Parties waive their arguments\n                     that (i) the summary judgment granting\n                     partition was in error because the\n                     Partnership      Agreement          prohibits\n                     withdrawal of capital; and (ii) the summary\n                     judgment winding up and terminating the\n                     Partnership was in error because there is\n                     no     agreement     to    terminate     the\n                     Partnership?\n\n     ISSUE NO. 1(c): Was it necessary for the Trial Court to\n                     make findings of fact to support its partial\n                     summary judgment ordering partition of\n                     the Property by sale?\n\n     ISSUE NO. 1(d): Are there genuine issues of material fact\n                     as to:\n\n                         i)      whether a fair and equitable division\n                                 of the Property cannot be made;\n\n                         ii)     whether    the    purpose    of   the\n                                 Partnership is frustrated;\n\n                         iii)    whether the Trust exists and has an\n                                 interest in the Property; and\n\n                         iv)     whether McFadin and Landen own\n                                 any interest in the Property or the\n                                 Partnership?\n\n                                        6\n\f     ISSUE NO. 2(a): Did the Trial Court abuse its discretion by\n                     awarding attorney’s fees to Coffeehouse\n                     and the Trust?\n\n     ISSUE NO. 2(b): Did the Saks Parties waive any issue\n                     regarding failure to segregate attorney’s\n                     fees?\n\n     ISSUE NO. 2(c): Did the Trial Court err in awarding the full\n                     amount of attorney’s fees requested by\n                     Coffeehouse and the Trust?\n\n     ISSUE NO. 3(a): Is the Saks Parties’ Issue No. 3 regarding\n                     the amount of the supersedeas bond moot\n                     because it has been waived, and does this\n                     Court therefore lack jurisdiction?\n\n     ISSUE NO. 3(b): Did the Trial Court abuse its discretion in\n                     setting the amount of the supersedeas\n                     bond?\n\n                         STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      Purchase of the Property and Formation of the Partnership\n\n     By Assumption Warranty Deed dated January 11, 1996, Guy\n\nChipman, Jr. sold the Property to the Trust. CR1 153. Several days later,\n\nby Warranty Deed dated January 16, 1996, the Trust conveyed an\n\nundivided twenty-five percent (25%) interest in and to the Property to Perry\n\nT. Donop, Jr. (“Donop”). CR1 157.\n\n     On January 16, 1996, Donop and the Trust also entered into a\n\nPartnership Agreement by which the Partnership was formed. CR1 163;\n\nAppendix, tab 3.    The stated purpose of the Partnership was to own,\n\n                                     7\n\foperate, and manage the Property. CR1 163. Record title to the Property\n\nremained jointly in the name of Donop (an undivided 25% interest) and the\n\nTrust (an undivided 75% interest).        Pursuant to Paragraph 5 of the\n\nPartnership Agreement, Donop and the TRUST transferred equitable title to\n\nthe Property to the Partnership. CR1 163-164; Appendix, tab 3.\n\n       By Special Warranty Deed dated August 22, 2012, Donop conveyed\n\nhis undivided 25% interest in and to the Property to Coffeehouse, of which\n\nDonop is Manager. CR1 170. On the same date, Donop executed an\n\nAssignment and Assumption of Partnership Interest, whereby he assigned\n\nall of his interest in the Partnership to Coffeehouse. CR1 169. Attached\n\nhereto as Appendix, tab 2, is a flow chart illustrating the Property’s chain of\n\ntitle. CR1 320.\n\n       On or about September 6, 2012, Coffeehouse and Saks Broadway,\n\nLLC (“Saks Broadway”) executed an unrecorded Agreement Confirming\n\nInterests in Partnership, which recited that the Trust had previously\n\ntransferred all of its right, title and interest in and to the Property and the\n\nPartnership to Saks Broadway. However, no such transfer or conveyance\n\nfrom the Trust to Saks Broadway was ever executed, and Saks Broadway\n\ndoes not own any interest in the Property or the Partnership. CR1 160-\n\n161.\n\n\n\n                                      8\n\f                 The Probate Suit Regarding the Trust\n\n     On or about August 17, 2011, Lauren Saks Merriman (“Merriman”)\n\nfiled suit against her mother, Sandra, and Diane Flores (“Flores”), Sandra’s\n\nsister, who was then Trustee of the Trust, in Cause No. 2011-PC-3466, in\n\nBexar County Probate Court (the “Probate Suit”). CR1 174; See Davis,\n\n2015 WL 1004357; Appendix, tab 7.          In the Probate Suit, Merriman\n\nrequested an accounting of the Trust and to remove Flores as Trustee, due\n\nto Flores’ numerous breaches of fiduciary duty and mismanagement of\n\nTrust assets. CR1 174. On or about December 21, 2011, the day before a\n\nscheduled hearing to remove Flores as Trustee, Flores signed a document\n\nreciting that the Trust had been terminated.    CR1 323.     The next day,\n\nhowever, on December 22, 2011, the Probate Court removed Flores as\n\nTrustee and appointed Marcus Rogers as Interim Trustee of the Trust.\n\nCR1 183.\n\n                  The Mediated Settlement Agreement\n\n     The parties to the Probate Suit eventually mediated their claims, and\n\nentered into a Mediated Settlement Agreement (the “MSA”) effective April\n\n2, 2012.   CR1 188; Appendix, tab 4.        Because of Flores’ attempted\n\ntermination of the Trust and due to suspicions that Flores had fraudulently\n\nassigned interests in the Partnership to Sandra, the MSA included an\n\n\n\n                                     9\n\fagreement by Sandra and Flores to transfer and assign any and all of their\n\nright, title, and interest in and to the Partnership back to the Trust. Sandra,\n\nFlores, Merriman, Landen (who is Sandra’s other daughter), and the Trust\n\n(through its Interim Trustee, Marcus Rogers) all signed the MSA. CR1 188;\n\nAppendix, tab 4. The Probate Court approved the MSA on May 8, 2012.\n\nCR1 193.\n\n      Sandra, Landen, and Flores then failed to comply with the MSA.\n\nInstead, on or about August 15, 2012, Sandra filed of record two\n\ndocuments attached to an Affidavit: a document titled “Irrevocable\n\nAssignment of Partnership Interest,” dated January 6, 1996, signed by\n\nFlores, purporting to assign 99% of the Trust’s right, title and interest in the\n\nPartnership to Sandra (the “1996 Assignment”); and another document\n\ntitled “Assignment of Interest in 5321 Broadway Partners,” dated December\n\n21, 2011, also signed by Flores, purporting to terminate the Trust and\n\nassign its 75% interest in the Partnership to Merriman and Landen (the\n\n“2011 Assignment”). CR1 321. These invalid documents were filed after\n\nthe Probate Court had removed and replaced Flores as trustee of the Trust,\n\nand served no purpose except to thwart the MSA.\n\n\n\n\n                                      10\n\f                          The Arbitration Award\n\n     As of September 5, 2012, Sandra, Landen and Flores still had not\n\ncomplied with the MSA. The Probate Court then ordered Sandra, Landen,\n\nMerriman, and the Trust to mediate and arbitrate any disputes over the\n\nMSA, as required under the terms of the MSA. CR1 195. This second\n\nmediation was unsuccessful, so the matter was arbitrated by the mediator,\n\nThomas J. Smith. On October 24, 2012, Mr. Smith, as Arbitrator, entered\n\nFindings and a Final Award (the “Arbitration Award”). CR1 200; Appendix,\n\ntab 5.   The Arbitrator found that the properties described in the MSA,\n\nincluding the interest in the Partnership, were Trust property.          The\n\nArbitrator also held that Sandra’s, Landen’s, and any other party’s failures\n\nto comply with the MSA’s requirement to transfer their right, title and\n\ninterest in the Trust property were not made in good faith or for just cause.\n\nThe Arbitrator ordered Sandra, Landen and any other party to the MSA to\n\nexecute the required documents necessary to effectuate the transfer,\n\npurpose, and intent of the MSA, which documents were attached to and\n\nincorporated by reference in the Arbitration Award. On May 7, 2013, the\n\nProbate Court confirmed the Arbitration Award, and entered it as a\n\njudgment of the Court. CR1 198.\n\n\n\n\n                                     11\n\f     Sixteen days after the Probate Court had entered the Arbitration\n\nAward as a judgment of the Court, on or about May 23, 2013, Sandra filed\n\nof record two more documents: a Deed dated April 21, 2012, by which she\n\npurported to convey all of her right, title, and interest in the Property to\n\nMcFadin (the “McFadin Deed”); and a document titled “Transfer\n\nConveyance Assignment of Interest in the 5321 Broadway Partners\n\nAgreement,” by which she purported to assign all of her right, title and\n\ninterest in the Partnership to McFadin (the “McFadin Assignment”)\n\n(collectively, with the 1996 Assignment and the 2011 Assignment, the\n\n“Assignments”).    CR1 333-343.        At the time the above-described\n\ninstruments were executed and filed of record, Sandra had no interest in\n\nthe Property or the Partnership, but in any event, the McFadin Deed and\n\nMcFadin Assignment were void and ineffective to transfer any interest in\n\nthe Property or the Partnership because McFadin acquired any such\n\ninterest subject to the Probate Suit, the MSA, and the final determination in\n\nthe Arbitration Award.\n\n                  Enforcement of the Arbitration Award\n\n     Despite being ordered by the Arbitrator and the Probate Court to\n\nexecute the documents necessary to transfer any right, title, and interest in\n\nthe Property and the Partnership to the Trust, Sandra and Landen still\n\n\n\n                                     12\n\fcontinued to refuse to sign such conveyances. On September 17, 2013,\n\nthe Probate Court entered an Order Granting Motion to Enforce, ordering\n\nSandra and Landen to execute the required documents, including a\n\nConveyance Agreement and Deed (the “Arbitration Deed”) relating to the\n\nProperty, and a Conveyance Agreement and Assignment (the “Arbitration\n\nAssignment”) relating to the Partnership. CR1 278. When Sandra and\n\nLanden still refused to comply, the Court entered an Order in Aid of\n\nEnforcement of Judgment on November 14, 2013, which deemed by\n\noperation of law that Sandra and Landen had executed the Arbitration\n\nDeed and Arbitration Assignment transferring all right, title, and interest in\n\nthe Property and the Partnership to the Trust, as well as the other required\n\ndocuments. CR1 281; Appendix, tab 6. This Order confirmed, once and\n\nfor all, title to a 75% undivided interest in the Trust, with the remaining 25%\n\nundivided interest in Coffeehouse.\n\n           Appeal of the Judgment on the Arbitration Award\n\n      On August 2, 2013, Sandra and Landen appealed the Arbitration\n\nAward and the Order entering the Arbitration Award as a Judgment. On\n\nDecember 12, 2013, Sandra, Landen, and McFadin appealed the\n\nNovember 14, 2013 Order in Aid of Enforcement of Judgment. This Court\n\nconsolidated the appeals and issued a Memorandum Opinion on March 4,\n\n\n\n                                      13\n\f2015, affirming the judgment confirming the Arbitration Award and\n\ndismissing the appeal from the Order in Aid of Enforcement of Judgment\n\nfor lack of jurisdiction. See Davis, 2015 WL 1004357. Appendix, tab 7.\n\n                     SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n     The Saks Parties failed to adequately brief their Issues Nos. 1(A) and\n\n1(B); therefore, they have presented nothing for this Court’s review and\n\nhave waived their complaints on these issues.\n\n     The Saks Parties also failed to raise Issues Nos. 1(A) and 1(B) in\n\ntheir Responses to Coffeehouse’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n\nand Amended Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, and are presenting\n\nthese complaints for the first time on appeal. Thus, the Saks Parties have\n\nwaived these issues.\n\n     It was not necessary for the Trial Court to make findings of fact to\n\nsupport its Order partitioning the Property by sale. Even if the Saks Parties\n\nhad requested findings of fact, it would have been improper for the Trial\n\nCourt to make them. Furthermore, the Trial Court did determine the shares\n\nof the joint owners in the Property in its Order Granting Partial Summary\n\nJudgment.\n\n     Even if the Saks Parties had not waived Issues Nos. 1(A) and 1(B),\n\nthe Trial Court’s Order Granting Partial Summary Judgment should be\n\n\n\n                                     14\n\faffirmed because there are no genuine issues of material fact that (i) a fair\n\nand equitable division of the Property cannot be made; (ii) the purpose of\n\nthe Partnership is frustrated; (iii) the Trust exists and owns an interest in\n\nthe Property; and (iv) McFadin and Landen own no interest in the Property\n\nor the Partnership.\n\n     The Trial Court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney’s\n\nfees to Coffeehouse and the Trust because they properly pleaded for\n\ndeclaratory relief under Section 37.001 et seq. of the Texas Civil Practice &\n\nRemedies Code (the “UDJA”), which relief was not duplicative of the other\n\nrelief they sought, and the Trial Court was statutorily authorized to make\n\nthe fee awards.\n\n     The Saks Parties have waived their argument regarding segregation\n\nof attorney’s fees because they failed to file a Motion for New Trial or\n\notherwise object in the Trial Court. Even if the issue had not been waived,\n\nthe evidence shows that the attorney’s fees of Coffeehouse and the Trust\n\ncould not be segregated; therefore, the Trial Court’s award should be\n\naffirmed.\n\n     The Saks Parties have already asked this Court to review the Order\n\nsetting the amount of supersedeas bond. This Court refused to overturn or\n\nmodify the Order, and the Saks Parties failed to file a petition for writ of\n\n\n\n                                     15\n\fmandamus to the Supreme Court of Texas to further challenge the Order.\n\nTherefore, the Saks Parties’ Issue No. 3 is moot and has been waived.\n\nThis Court also lacks jurisdiction to consider this issue. Even if it were\n\npossible for the Saks Parties to further appeal the Order setting the amount\n\nof supersedeas bond, their Notice of Appeal for this Order was untimely.\n\nFinally, even if the Saks Parties’ Issue No. 3 were properly before this\n\nCourt, the Trial Court did not abuse its discretion in setting the amount of\n\nsupersedeas bond, and its Order should be affirmed.\n\n                    ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\n\n     This Court is already familiar with many of this case’s underlying facts\n\nand arguments because this case arises out of the ongoing dispute\n\nbetween the Trust and the Saks Parties. See Davis, 2015 WL 1004357.\n\nAppendix, tab 7.    Because of this dispute and the unreasonable and\n\nunpredictable behavior of the Saks Parties, Coffeehouse’s abilities to deal\n\nwith the Trust and to effectively manage the Property have been frustrated,\n\nand it is no longer practical for Coffeehouse to be in business with the\n\nTrust. Due the fraudulent instruments filed of record by the Saks Parties,\n\nCoffeehouse had no choice but to file this action seeking to cancel the\n\ninvalid instruments and quiet the Saks Parties’ claims, so that the Property\n\ncould be sold and the Partnership terminated.\n\n\n\n                                    16\n\f            ISSUE NO. 1(a): Do the Saks Parties’ Issues Nos. 1(A)\n                            and (B) present anything for this\n                            Court’s review?\n\n      In Davis, this Court held that in attempting to raise several issues,\n\nSandra and Landen failed to properly brief their arguments under Texas\n\nRule of Appellate Procedure 38.1(i). 2015 WL 1004357 at *5. Similarly,\n\nthe Saks Parties in this case have inadequately briefed Issue Nos. 1(A) and\n\n(B) so that nothing is presented to this Court for review.\n\n      Pursuant to Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 38.1(i), an appellant’s\n\nbrief must contain “a clear and concise argument for the contentions made,\n\nwith appropriate citations to authorities and to the record.”      Nothing is\n\npresented for review if an appellate issue is unsupported by argument or\n\ncitation to the record or by proper legal authority. Davis, 2015 WL 1004357\n\nat *5; Blankinship v. Brown, 399 S.W.3d 303, 307 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2013,\n\npet. denied).   “Failure to cite legal authority or to provide substantive\n\nanalysis of the legal issues presented results in waiver of the complaint.” In\n\nre Estate of Taylor, 305 S.W.3d 829, 836 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2010, no\n\npet.). “An appellate court has no duty to perform an independent review of\n\nthe record and applicable law to determine whether the error complained of\n\noccurred.” Strange v. Cont’l Cas. Co., 126 S.W.3d 676, 678 (Tex. App.—\n\nDallas 2004, pet. denied).\n\n\n\n                                      17\n\f      In briefing their Issue No. 1(A), in which they attempt to challenge the\n\nOrder Granting Partial Summary Judgment, the Saks Parties make limited\n\ncitations to the record, and fail to provide any legal authority to support their\n\nposition. The Saks Parties’ briefing of their Issue No. 1(B) does not include\n\na single citation to either the record or supporting legal authority. Because\n\nthe Saks Parties have failed to provide adequate support for their Issues\n\nNo. 1(A) and (B) from either the record or the applicable law, they have\n\npresented nothing for this Court to review on these complaints.\n\n      Furthermore, on pages 14, 15, and 18 of their Brief, the Saks Parties\n\ncite to testimony and exhibits from the November 14, 2014, Reporter’s\n\nRecord of the hearing on their Amended Motion to Set Supersedeas Bond,\n\nwhich hearing was held after the Trial Court granted the Partial Summary\n\nJudgment, and which is not part of the summary judgment record.                A\n\nreview of a ruling granting a motion for summary judgment will be made\n\nonly on the record upon which the trial court’s ruling was based and only as\n\nit existed at the time the summary judgment was signed. Chappell v. Allen,\n\n414 S.W.3d 316, 321 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2013, no pet.); H.S.M.\n\nAcquisitions, Inc. v. West, 917 S.W.2d 872, 878 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi\n\n1996, writ denied). Because the November 14, 2014, Reporter’s Record of\n\nthe hearing on the Saks Parties’ Amended Motion to Set Supersedeas\n\n\n\n                                       18\n\fBond is not summary judgment evidence, any references to said Reporter’s\n\nRecord are improper and should be disregarded.\n\n     The Saks Parties fail to make adequate citations to the record or to\n\nappropriate legal authority, and cite to a portion of the record which is not\n\nproper summary judgment evidence.         Therefore, the Saks Parties have\n\npresented nothing for this Court to review on their Issues Nos. 1(A) and (B),\n\nand the Court should find that the Saks Parties have waived these\n\ncomplaints.\n\n     ISSUE NO. 1(b): Did the Saks Parties waive their arguments\n                     that (i) the summary judgment granting\n                     partition was in error because the\n                     Partnership      Agreement          prohibits\n                     withdrawal of capital; and (ii) the summary\n                     judgment winding up and terminating the\n                     Partnership was in error because there is\n                     no     agreement     to    terminate     the\n                     Partnership?\n\n     The Saks Parties attempt to argue that the Partnership Agreement\n\nprohibits the withdrawal of capital, and, therefore, Coffeehouse lacked\n\nstanding to request partition of the Property. The Saks Parties also try to\n\nclaim that the winding-up and termination of the Partnership is in error\n\nbecause there is no agreement to terminate the Partnership. The Saks\n\nParties failed to present these arguments to the Trial Court in their\n\nResponses to Coffeehouse’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and\n\n\n\n                                     19\n\fAmended Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, and are raising them for\n\nthe first time in this appeal. CR1 350, 406; CR2 1, 152, 171, 187. Under\n\nTexas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(c):\n\n           Issues not expressly presented to the trial court by\n\n           written motion, answer or other response shall not\n\n           be considered on appeal as grounds for reversal.\n\nThe non-movant must expressly present to the trial court any issues or\n\ngrounds for defeating the movant’s entitlement to summary judgment.\n\nFriedman v. Atl. Funding Corp., 936 S.W.2d 38, 41-42 (Tex. App.—San\n\nAntonio 1996, no writ).    Any issue not presented in the response to a\n\nsummary judgment motion cannot be raised later on appeal. Id. Because\n\nthe Saks Parties failed to present these issues to the Trial Court in their\n\nresponses to Coffeehouse’s motion for partial summary judgment, the court\n\nshould find that these issues have been waived for this reason, as well.\n\n     ISSUE NO. 1(c): Was it necessary for the Trial Court to\n                     make findings of fact to support its partial\n                     summary judgment ordering partition of\n                     the Property by sale?\n\n     The Saks Parties claim that the Trial Court’s Order Granting Partial\n\nSummary Judgment was in error because it failed to make findings that the\n\nProperty could not be partitioned in kind, or determine the share of each of\n\nthe joint owners in the Property. First, the Saks Parties did not request any\n\n                                     20\n\ffindings of fact, but even if they had, it would have been improper for the\n\nTrial Court to make findings of fact. “Findings of fact and conclusions of\n\nlaw have no place in a summary judgment proceeding.”            IKB Indus.\n\n(Nigeria) Ltd. v. Pro-Line Corp., 938 S.W.2d 440, 441 (Tex. 1997). The\n\nreason for this is that for summary judgment to be rendered, there must be\n\nno genuine issue as to any material fact, and the legal grounds must be set\n\nforth in the motion and response. Id. If the trial court properly enters\n\nsummary judgment, there are no facts to find, and the legal conclusions\n\nhave already been presented in the motion and response. Id. “The trial\n\ncourt should not make, and an appellate court cannot consider, findings of\n\nfact in connection with a summary judgment.” Id. Therefore, it was not\n\nnecessary for the Trial Court to make any findings of fact with regard to\n\npartition of the Property.\n\n      Furthermore, the Trial Court did determine, in its Judgment, the share\n\nof each of the joint owners of the Property. In its Order Granting Partial\n\nSummary Judgment (which was incorporated into the final Judgment), the\n\nCourt decreed that:\n\n            BROADWAY COFFEEHOUSE, LLC, owns an\n\n            undivided twenty-five (25%) percent interest, and\n\n            that Defendant MARCUS ROGERS, AS INTERIM\n\n\n\n                                    21\n\f           TRUSTEE FOR THE SAKS CHILDREN TRUST\n\n           A/K/A ATFL&L, A TEXAS TRUST, owns an\n\n           undivided seventy-five (75%) percent interest, in the\n\n           following real property and improvements (the\n\n           “Property”):\n\n                 Lot Four (4), Block Thirty-Three (33),\n                 Alamo Heights, City of Alamo Heights,\n                 Situated in Bexar County, Texas,\n                 according to Plat thereof Recorded in\n                 Volume 105, Pages 29-296, Deed and\n                 Plat Records of Bexar County, Texas.\n\nCR2 369; Appendix, tab 8. This is part of the Judgment, but the effect is\n\nthe same. The Saks Parties’ point is moot.\n\n     ISSUE NO. 1(d): Are there genuine issues of material fact\n                     as to:\n\n                          i)     whether a fair and equitable division\n                                 of the Property cannot be made;\n\n                          ii)    whether    the    purpose    of   the\n                                 Partnership is frustrated;\n\n                          iii)   whether the Trust exists and has an\n                                 interest in the Property; and\n\n                          iv)    whether McFadin and Landen are\n                                 owners of the Property?\n\n     A summary judgment is reviewed on appeal de novo. Provident Life\n\nand Acc. Ins. Co. v. Knott, 128 S.W.3d 211, 215 (Tex. 2003).         Under\n\n\n\n                                        22\n\fsummary judgment review, all evidence favorable to the non-movant is\n\ntaken as true, and the court indulges every reasonable inference and\n\nresolves any doubts in favor of the nonmovant. Id., at 215. Pursuant to\n\nTexas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(c), the party moving for summary\n\njudgment must show that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that it\n\nis entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Id., at 216. When a movant\n\nmeets this burden, the burden then shifts to the non-movant to raise an\n\nissue of fact as to at least one the elements of the movant’s claim.\n\nAmedisys, Inc. v. Kingwood Home Health Care, LLC, 437 S.W.3d 507, 511\n\n(Tex. 2014).\n\n     i.    There is no genuine issue of material fact that a fair\n           and equitable division of the Property cannot be\n           made.\n\n     The Trial Court’s Order Granting Partial Summary Judgment and final\n\nJudgment both order partition of the Property by sale. CR2 371, 439. In a\n\nsuit for partition, the Court shall determine whether the property is\n\nincapable of division so that the Property must be sold. Pursuant to Texas\n\nRule of Civil Procedure 770:\n\n           Should the court be of the opinion that a fair and\n\n           equitable division of the real estate, or any part\n\n           thereof, cannot be made, it shall order a sale of so\n\n\n\n                                    23\n\f           much as is incapable of partition, which sale shall\n\n           be for cash, or upon such other terms as the court\n\n           may direct, and shall be made as under execution\n\n           or by private or public sale through a receiver, if the\n\n           court so order . . . .\n\n“Incapable” of partition does not mean incapable in a physical sense, but\n\nrather the Court should focus on whether partition in kind is fair and\n\nequitable so that the property can be divided in kind without materially\n\nimpairing its value. Champion v. Robinson, 392 S.W.3d 118, 123 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Texarkana 2012, pet denied). The party seeking partition by sale\n\nbears the burden of proving a partition in kind would not be fair and\n\nequitable. Id.\n\n     Coffeehouse’s summary judgment evidence shows that a partition in\n\nkind of the Property would not be fair and equitable.            Attached to\n\nCoffeehouse’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is the Affidavit of\n\nPerry Donop, Jr. (“Donop Affidavit I”), in which Donop describes the\n\nProperty as a commercial building and adjacent parking lot, leased to retail\n\nand office tenants.     CR1 161.    The Property is a single platted lot.\n\nAppendix, tab 18.     Donop explains that there is no way to divide the\n\nbuilding or the land in a way that would not materially impair its value. CR1\n\n\n\n                                     24\n\f161. Finally, Donop explains that the Property’s value is dependent on the\n\ncommercial improvements and its operation as a commercial retail and\n\noffice building, and neither the improvements nor the land underneath the\n\nimprovements can be partitioned in kind. CR1 161.\n\n     The Saks Parties fail to point to any specific evidence in the summary\n\njudgment record that would controvert the Donop Affidavit I. It is the Saks\n\nParties’ burden to discuss their assertions of error and properly cite to\n\nsupporting evidence in the record. Valadez v. Avitia, 238 S.W.3d 843, 845\n\n(Tex. App.—El Paso 2007, no pet.). An appellate court has no duty or right\n\nto perform an independent review of the record, which would improperly\n\ntransform the court from neutral adjudicators to advocate for that party. Id.\n\nBecause it is not this Court’s duty to independently review the voluminous\n\nsummary judgment record, the Saks Parties were required to identify any\n\nsupporting evidence with proper citations to the summary judgment record,\n\nand by failing to do so, they have presented nothing for review. See Id.\n\n     The only evidence cited by the Saks Parties in support of this issue is\n\nfrom the November 14, 2014, Reporter’s Record of the hearing on\n\nAppellants’ Amended Motion to Set Supersedeas Bond.            As explained\n\nabove, the November 14, 2014, Reporter’s Record is not part of the\n\nsummary judgment record because it pertains to a separate proceeding\n\n\n\n                                     25\n\fheld on October 31, 2014, regarding the amount of the supersedeas bond,\n\nand was made well after the Court entered its Order granting Partial\n\nSummary Judgment on August 19, 2014. See Chappell, 414 S.W.3d at\n\n321; H.S.M. Acquisitions, 917 S.W.2d at 878. Because the testimony and\n\nevidence presented during the hearing regarding the supersedeas bond is\n\noutside the summary judgment record, it is not within the scope of this\n\nCourt’s summary judgment review, and should be disregarded.\n\n     The evidence presented by Coffeehouse satisfies its burden to show\n\nthat there is no genuine issue of material fact that a fair and equitable\n\ndivision of the Property cannot be made. CR1 161. The Saks Parties\n\nfailed to identify or cite to any summary judgment evidence that would raise\n\na fact question on this issue. See Chappell, 414 S.W.3d at 321 (Appellate\n\ncourt would not consider voluminous summary judgment record or matters\n\npresented at subsequent trial, but would limit scope of review to portions of\n\nsummary judgment record to which proper citations were made).\n\nTherefore, the Order Granting Partial Summary Judgment and subsequent\n\nfinal Judgment ordering partition of the Property by sale should be affirmed.\n\n     ii.   There is no genuine issue of material fact that the\n           purpose of the Partnership is frustrated.\n\n     The Trial Court’s Order Granting Partial Summary Judgment and final\n\nJudgment also order that the Partnership be wound-up and terminated.\n\n                                     26\n\fCR2 371, 439.       Under Section 11.314(1)(A) of the Texas Business\n\nOrganizations Code, a district court has jurisdiction to order the winding up\n\nand termination of a domestic partnership if the court determines that the\n\neconomic purpose of the partnership is likely to be unreasonably frustrated.\n\nAppendix, tab 19.     Coffeehouse requested partial summary judgment\n\nordering the winding-up and termination of the Partnership on this basis,\n\nsupported by the Donop Affidavit I, in which Mr. Donop stated that the\n\neconomic purpose of the Partnership was frustrated by the ongoing Trust\n\ndispute, the accusations of Flores’ mismanagement of the Trust, the\n\nlitigiousness of the Saks Parties, and their refusal to comply with court\n\norders and recognize the validity of the Trust. CR1 148-150, 161-162, 186-\n\n194, 198-199, 205-206, 245-261, 281-282, 321-324, 330-343; CR2 121-\n\n123.\n\n       The Saks Parties do not point to any summary judgment evidence to\n\nrefute the Donop Affidavit I or the other evidence, do not make a single\n\ncitation to the record on this issue, and provide no legal authority for their\n\nargument. Rather, the Saks Parties make conclusory and unsupported\n\nstatements that “the economic purpose of the Partnership is not frustrated\n\nby any dispute between the ATFL&L and any other parties because\n\nATFL&L is no longer an owner of any interest in the Property,” and “there\n\n\n\n                                     27\n\fare genuine issues of material fact . . . [as to] (4) whether the purpose of\n\nthe Partnership is frustrated.” Appellants Brief, at 19-20. The requirement\n\nthat an appellant’s brief contain a clear and concise argument, including\n\nappropriate citation to authority and to the record, is not satisfied by merely\n\nuttering brief conclusory statements unsupported by legal citations.\n\nValadez, 238 S.W.3d at 845. Because the Saks Parties have raised no\n\ngenuine issue of material fact, the Order Granting Partial Summary\n\nJudgment and final Judgment ordering winding-up and termination of the\n\nPartnership should be affirmed.\n\n      Furthermore, Coffeehouse asserted three other bases for winding-up\n\nand terminating the Partnership. Under Section 11.314(1)(B) of the Texas\n\nBusiness Organizations Code, a district court has jurisdiction to order the\n\nwinding up and termination of a domestic partnership if the court\n\ndetermines that another partner has engaged in conduct relating to the\n\npartnership’s business that makes it not reasonably practicable to carry on\n\nthe business in partnership with that partner.            Appendix, tab 19.\n\nCoffeehouse presented summary judgment evidence that this condition\n\nexisted so that winding-up and termination of the Partnership was\n\nnecessary.    The Donop Affidavit I sets forth testimony explaining that\n\nbecause of the conflicts surrounding the Trust and the Saks Parties’\n\n\n\n                                      28\n\fassertion of invalid and fraudulent claims to the Property and the\n\nPartnership, as well as their absolute refusal to recognize the existence of\n\nthe Trust or comply with the Orders of the Probate Court, it is not\n\nreasonably practicable to carry on the business with the Trust. CR1 161-\n\n162, 186-194, 198-199, 205-206, 245-261, 281-282, 321-324, 330-343.\n\n     Furthermore, pursuant to Sections 11.051(4) and 11.057(c) of the\n\nTexas Business Organizations Code, an event requiring the winding up of a\n\ndomestic general partnership includes:\n\n     (1)   in a general partnership for a particular undertaking,\n\n           the completion of the undertaking, unless otherwise\n\n           provided by the partnership agreement; [and]\n\n                                    ...\n\n     (3)   the sale of all or substantially all of the property of\n\n           the general partnership outside the ordinary course\n\n           of business, unless otherwise provided by the\n\n           partnership agreement.\n\nTEX. BUS. ORG. CODE § 11.057(c); Appendix, tab 19. Coffeehouse showed\n\nthe Trial Court that winding-up and termination of the Partnership was\n\nrequired due to such events. Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, the\n\npurpose of the Partnership was to own, operate, and manage the Property,\n\n\n\n                                     29\n\fwhich constituted all of the property of the Partnership. CR1 160, 163-164.\n\nBecause Coffeehouse (1) owns an interest in the property and (2) has a\n\nright to present possession as a cotenant, it is entitled to partition the\n\nProperty as a matter of law. CR1 159-160, 157-158, 170-172. See Savell\n\nv. Savell, 837 S.W.2d 836, 838 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1992, writ\n\ndenied); Beago v. Ceres, 619 S.W.2d 293, 294 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\n\nDist.] 1981, no writ) (holding that the right of a joint owner to partition real\n\nproperty is absolute).   Coffeehouse established that partition by sale is\n\nnecessary because a fair and equitable division of the Property cannot be\n\nmade, and the Trial Court ordered partition of the Property by sale. CR1\n\n161, CR2 371, 439.       Such a sale would constitute an event requiring\n\nwinding up the Partnership because it would: (1) complete the particular\n\nundertaking for which the Partnership was formed; and (2) constitute a sale\n\nof all of the property of the Partnership. As such, the winding up of the\n\nPartnership is required under Sections 11.051(4) and 11.057(c) of the\n\nTexas Business Organizations Code.\n\n      In their Brief, the Saks Parties have raised no issue regarding these\n\nother grounds for winding up and terminating the Partnership. The Trial\n\nCourt did not specify the grounds for ordering the winding up and\n\ntermination of the Partnership; therefore, the summary judgment must be\n\n\n\n                                      30\n\faffirmed if any of the theories presented to the Trial Court and preserved\n\nfor appellate review are meritorious. Provident, 128 S.W.3d at 217. Even if\n\nthere had been a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the\n\npurpose of the Partnership was frustrated, Coffeehouse has established\n\nthe other three bases for winding-up and termination of the Partnership as\n\na matter of law, and the Saks Parties have not disputed these grounds.\n\nTherefore, the Trial Court’s ordering the winding-up and termination of the\n\nPartnership should be affirmed.\n\n     iii.   There is no genuine issue of material fact that the Trust\n            exists and has an interest in the Property and the\n            Partnership.\n\n     The Saks Parties present no specific issue on their contentions that\n\nthe Trust was terminated and that they own interests in the Property. They\n\ndo say as an unsupported conclusion buried in the body of their confusing\n\nBrief that there are questions of fact on these issues. But these are not\n\nissues they include in their statement of the issues in this appeal (see\n\nAppellants’ Brief, at 3), and they entirely fail to present or support those\n\nunsupported conclusions with proper clarity or argument. The Saks Parties\n\nalso fail to mention that these precise issues are now conclusively decided\n\nagainst them by this Court’s opinion in Davis, 2015 WL 1004357. The\n\nCourt should simply disregard what the Saks Parties say about the Trust\n\n\n\n                                    31\n\fbeing terminated or their supposed ownership, because these statements\n\ndo not support or relate to the issues they have identified in their statement\n\nof the issues and because these issues have already been decided in favor\n\nof the Trust and against the Saks Parties.\n\n      If this Court does entertain these issues, it should quickly reject the\n\noutrageous position that the Trust was terminated and owns no interest in\n\nthe Property or the Partnership, despite the Probate Court’s appointment of\n\nan interim trustee, the Arbitration Award carrying out the MSA and stating\n\nthat the Property and Partnership are Trust property, the Probate Court’s\n\nOrders enforcing the Arbitration Award, and Trial Court’s Order Granting\n\nPartial Summary Judgment in this case declaring that the Trust owns 75%\n\nof the Property and the Partnership. CR1 188, 193, 198, 200, 205, 278,\n\n281; CR2 370; Appendix, tabs 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9.          Furthermore, in the\n\nMemorandum Opinion issued in Davis, this Court affirmed the Probate\n\nCourt’s judgment confirming the Arbitration Award, finding that, based on\n\nthe MSA and the Arbitration Award which are premised on the notion that\n\nthe Trust is in existence, the Trust was never terminated. Davis, 2015 WL\n\n1004357 at *3. Appendix, tab 7.\n\n      Additionally, the Saks Parties point to no competent summary\n\njudgment evidence that the Trust no longer owns its 75% interest in the\n\n\n\n                                     32\n\fProperty and the Partnership. CR1 157, 163. The only evidence referred\n\nto by the Saks Parties is an Affidavit of Diana Flores, dated July 1, 2014,\n\nwhich they claim shows that Flores had absolute authority to execute the\n\n1996 Assignment and the 2011 Assignment, by which Flores purported to\n\nterminate the Trust. The Saks Parties fail to indicate the page in the record\n\nwhere such Affidavit can be found, but it appears that Appellants are\n\nreferring to the Affidavit attached to Flores’ Response to Coffeehouse’s\n\nMotion for Partial Summary Judgment. CR2 78-79. It should be noted that\n\nFlores withdrew her opposition to Coffeehouse’s Motion for Partial\n\nSummary Judgment prior to the hearing, when she entered into a Rule 11\n\nAgreement agreeing to disclaim and quitclaim any interest in the Property\n\nand the Partnership. CR2 365.\n\n     First, Flores’ statements in the Affidavit that she terminated the Trust\n\non December 21, 2011, and that she had authority to execute the above-\n\nmentioned Assignments by which she allegedly distributed the Trust’s 75%\n\ninterest in the Property and the Partnership, constitute legal conclusions.\n\nCoffeehouse objected to Flores’ Affidavit on these bases in the Trial Court,\n\nbut the Trial Court did not rule on those objections. CR2 357. Because an\n\nobjection that an affidavit states a legal conclusion is an objection based on\n\na substantive defect, the objection may be raised on appeal even if it was\n\n\n\n                                     33\n\fnever ruled on, or even raised, in the trial court. Rizkallah v. Conner, 952\n\nS.W.2d 580, 587 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1997, no writ). Because\n\nthe statements in Flores’ Affidavit relied on by the Saks Parties are legal\n\nconclusions, they are improper summary judgment evidence and should be\n\ndisregarded. Additionally, the Assignments referred to by Flores in her\n\nAffidavit were invalidated by the MSA, the Arbitration Award, and the\n\nProbate Court Orders enforcing the Arbitration Award, by which Sandra,\n\nLanden, and Merriman conveyed any interest they may have had in the\n\nProperty and the Partnership to the Trust.\n\n         Because the Saks Parties have presented no evidence creating a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact as to whether the Trust exists and owns an\n\ninterest in the Property and the Partnership, summary judgment on this\n\nissue must be affirmed.\n\n         iv.     There is no genuine issue of material fact that McFadin and\n                 Landen own no interest in the Property or the Partnership.\n\n         Landen does not own any interest in the Property or the Partnership\n\nbecause the Trust was not terminated, and she was deemed to have\n\nconveyed any interest she had in the Property and the Partnership to the\n\nTrust.         CR1 281; Appendix, tab 6.     McFadin owns no interest in the\n\nProperty or the Partnership because he purports to have obtained his\n\ninterest from Sandra, who never owned any interest in the Property, and\n\n                                        34\n\fwho also was deemed to have conveyed any interest she may have had in\n\nthe Property and Partnership back to the Trust. CR1 281; Appendix, tab 6.\n\n      Coffeehouse presented summary judgment evidence that pursuant to\n\nthe MSA, Sandra and Flores agreed to transfer and assign to the Trust all\n\nof their right, title, and interest in and to the Property and the Partnership,\n\nand the Probate Court approved the MSA. CR1 189. When the MSA was\n\narbitrated, the arbitrator found:\n\n      4)    Pursuant to order of the court, Marcus Rogers is the\n\n            Interim Trustee of the Trust.\n\n                                      ...\n\n      6)    Sandra C. Saks, although settlor of the Trust, has no\n\n            current interest in the Trust.\n\n                                      ...\n\n      21)   ¶3.b. of the MSA represents the Parties’ agreement that\n\n            the properties and interests identified in that paragraph\n\n            were intended by the Parties to be assigned or conveyed\n\n            to the Trust.     The properties so identified are Trust\n\n            property.    ¶5 of the MSA provides the Parties would\n\n            cooperate with one another in the execution of the\n\n            necessary documents to effect the transfer of the\n\n\n\n                                       35\n\f            properties and interests identified in ¶3.b. to the Trust.\n\n            The documents attached hereto as Exhibits 1 – 10 are in\n\n            proper form and necessary to accomplish the transfer of\n\n            the properties to the Trust as contemplated in the MSA.\n\n                                      ...\n\n      22)   The refusal of Sandra C. Saks, Landen Saks, and/or any\n\n            other party who has failed to execute the necessary\n\n            documents to effect a conveyance of the transfer of the\n\n            title or interest of the properties listed in MSA ¶3.b. to the\n\n            Trust was not made in good faith or for just cause. Each\n\n            such party failing to cooperate shall be compelled to\n\n            cooperate in order to effect the transfer, purposes and\n\n            intents of the MSA.\n\nCR1 201, 205-206; Appendix, tab 5.          Because this Court has already\n\naffirmed the judgment confirming the Arbitration Award, the Saks Parties\n\nhave already litigated and lost on this issue.\n\n      Moreover, the documents by which Landen and Sandra were\n\ndeemed to have conveyed any Property and Partnership interests they may\n\nhave had to the Trust, and which were incorporated into the Arbitration\n\nAward as a judgment of the Probate Court, specifically state that the 1996\n\n\n\n                                      36\n\fAssignment and 2011 Assignment are now “canceled or void and of no\n\nfurther force or effect.” CR1 256; Appendix, tab 5. Because Sandra had\n\nnothing to convey or assign to McFadin, the McFadin Assignment and the\n\nMcFadin Deed are void and ineffective.\n\n      The Saks Parties point to no competent summary judgment evidence\n\nthat would show that Landen or Sandra retained any interest in the\n\nProperty or the Partnership, or that Sandra had any interest to convey to\n\nMcFadin. The Saks Parties also fail to argue or offer any evidence that the\n\npurported conveyance and assignment to McFadin were not invalidated by\n\nthe Probate Suit, the MSA, and the final determination in the Arbitration\n\nAward. Because the Saks Parties have raised no genuine issue of material\n\nfact on this issue, the summary judgment declaring that neither Landen nor\n\nMcFadin own any interest in the Property or the Partnership must be\n\naffirmed.\n\n      ISSUE NO. 2(a): Did the Trial Court abuse its discretion by\n                      awarding attorney’s fees to Coffeehouse\n                      and the Trust?\n\n      Due to the Saks Parties’ absurd persistence in their claims against\n\nthe Trust and its properties, and their unceasing litigation in the face of\n\nconclusive court rulings, it was necessary for Coffeehouse and the Trust to\n\nrequest declaratory relief to invalidate the fraudulently filed instruments and\n\n\n\n                                      37\n\frestore marketable title to the Property before partition of the Property or\n\nwinding-up of the Partnership could be accomplished. Coffeehouse asked\n\nthe Court to declare under the UDJA that Saks Broadway owns no interest\n\nin the Property or the Partnership, that the Assignments and Deed\n\nfraudulently filed by Sandra Saks are null and void, that Coffeehouse and\n\nthe Trust are the only two partners of the Partnership, that the Partnership\n\nowns equitable title to the Property, and that Coffeehouse and the Trust\n\nown 25% and 75% of the Property respectively. CR1 91.\n\n     The Saks Parties have fought Coffeehouse and the Trust every step\n\nof the way, completely disregarding the Orders of the Probate Court, as\n\nwell as the agreement and absolute right of Coffeehouse and the Trust to\n\npartition the Property and wind up the Partnership.           As a result,\n\nCoffeehouse and the Trust also sought to recover their reasonable and\n\nnecessary attorney’s fees under Section 37.009 of the UDJA. CR1 93;\n\nAppendix, tab 1.     The Trial Court granted Coffeehouse’s requested\n\ndeclaratory relief in its Order Granting Partial Summary Judgment and\n\nincorporated such relief into the final Judgment, which also awarded\n\nattorney’s fees to Coffeehouse and the Trust. CR2 369, 437; Appendix,\n\ntabs 8 and 9.\n\n     Section 37.009 of the UDJA provides:\n\n\n\n                                    38\n\f             In any proceeding under this chapter, the court may\n\n             award   costs   and    reasonable    and     necessary\n\n             attorney’s fees as are equitable and just.\n\nAppendix, tab 10.     Attorney’s fees awarded pursuant to the UDJA are\n\nreviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. Roberts v. Wilson, 394\n\nS.W.3d 45, 55 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2012, no pet.); Florey v. Estate of\n\nMcConnell, 212 S.W.3d 439, 447 (Tex. App.—Austin 2006, pet. denied);\n\nWheeler v. Phillips, 03-10-00221-CV, 2011 WL 4011455, at *9 (Tex. App.—\n\nAustin Sept. 7, 2011, pet. denied). Abuse of discretion occurs when a trial\n\ncourt acts unreasonably or without reference to any guiding rules and\n\nprinciples. Wheeler, 2011 WL 4011455, at *9.\n\n     The Saks Parties argue that because neither the Order Granting\n\nPartial Summary Judgment nor the final Judgment expressly address the\n\nrequests for declaratory judgment, then the award of attorney’s fees under\n\nthe UDJA was improper. However, the Order Granting Partial Summary\n\nJudgment and the final Judgment clearly granted declaratory relief, even if\n\nthey did not expressly refer to the UDJA or use the words “declaratory\n\njudgment.”    The final Judgment orders, adjudges, and decrees (1) that\n\nCoffeehouse and the Trust own 25% and 75% undivided interests in the\n\nProperty, respectively; (2) that Coffeehouse and the Trust own 25% and\n\n\n\n                                      39\n\f75% of the Partnership, respectively; (3) that the Partnership has equitable\n\ntitle to the Property; (4) that none of the other parties in the Trial Court,\n\nincluding the Saks Parties, own any interest in the Property or the\n\nPartnership; (5) and that the Assignments and Deed filed by Sandra Saks\n\nafter the MSA was approved by the Probate Court and the Arbitration\n\nAward was entered as a Judgment, are void and of no force and effect.\n\nCR2 369, 437; Appendix, tabs 8 and 9.\n\n     The Saks Parties’ argument that the Judgment does not mention\n\n“declaratory judgment,” is merely an attack on the form of the Judgment.\n\nHowever, nothing in the record shows that the Saks Parties called this\n\nalleged defect to the attention of the Trial Court. Because the Saks Parties\n\nfailed to object to the form of the Judgment or notify the Trial Court of the\n\nclaimed error, the Saks Parties have waived any complaint of error to the\n\nform of the judgment. 46933, Inc. v. Z & B Enterprises, Inc., 899 S.W.2d\n\n800, 808 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 1995, writ denied).\n\n     Furthermore, “under the liberal construction which must be given the\n\ndeclaratory judgment act, no particular form is necessary for the declaration\n\nof rights in a declaratory judgment action if, when construed together with\n\nthe pleadings and any findings, the rights of the parties can be determined\n\nfrom the face of the judgment.” 46933, Inc., 899 S.W.2d at 808. Because\n\n\n\n                                     40\n\fthe Trial Court’s Judgment, when construed with the Coffeehouse and\n\nTrust pleadings requesting declaratory relief, determines the rights of the\n\nparties, the Judgment constitutes a declaration under the UDJA. See In\n\nInterest of an Unborn Child, 153 S.W.3d 559, 561 (Tex. App.—Amarillo\n\n1993, no writ.) (holding that even though the trial court’s order did not make\n\na declaration, determination of law, or expressly grant any relief, because\n\nno particular form is prescribed for a declaration of rights in a declaratory\n\njudgment action, the word “finds” was construed to constitute a declaration\n\nbased upon facts found from the evidence).\n\n      The Trial Court could have properly awarded attorney’s fees to\n\nCoffeehouse and the Trust under the UDJA even if the requested\n\ndeclaratory relief had not been granted. Pursuant to Section 37.009 of the\n\nUDJA, “equitable and just” attorney’s fees and costs may be awarded “in\n\nany proceeding under this chapter.” The question, then, is whether the\n\nproceeding is a declaratory judgment action “under this chapter.” Zurita v.\n\nSVH-1 Partners, Ltd., No. 03-10-00650-CV, 2011 WL 6118573, at *8 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Austin Dec. 8, 2011, pet. denied). Under Section 37.009, it is within\n\nthe trial court’s discretion to award attorney’s fees to the prevailing party,\n\nthe nonprevailing party, or neither. Feldman v. KPMG LLP, 438 S.W.3d\n\n678, 685 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2014, no pet.); Zurita, 2011 WL\n\n\n\n                                     41\n\f6118573 at *8. Moreover, the statute does not require a judgment on the\n\nmerits of the dispute as a prerequisite to a fee award.         Feldman, 438\n\nS.W.3d at 685; Zurita, 2011 WL 6118573 at *8. In an action under the\n\nUDJA, it is within the trial court’s discretion to award attorney’s fees to any\n\nparty with pleadings requesting them, even if the party moving for\n\nattorney’s fees failed to specify the statutory authority for such an award in\n\nits motion.   Roberts, 394 S.W.3d at 55; Purvis Oil Corp. v. Hillin, 890\n\nS.W.2d 931, 939 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1994, no writ); Smith v. Reid, No.\n\n04-13-00550-CV, 2014 WL 7339586, at *10 (Tex. App.—San Antonio Dec.\n\n23, 2014, no pet.); Zurita, 2011 WL 6118573 at *8.\n\n      The Saks Parties contend that Coffeehouse and the Trust are not\n\nentitled to recover fees because they “did not claim an independent cause\n\nof action for declaratory judgment that was granted,” citing as support\n\nMorton v. Timarron Owners Ass’n., Inc., No. 02-13-00409-CV, 2014 WL\n\n2619189 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth June 12, 2014, no pet.) Appellants’ Brief,\n\nat 23. This case is distinguishable because the request for declaratory\n\njudgment in Morton was a defensive counterclaim that mirrored the\n\nplaintiff’s trademark infringement claim. The appellate court held that the\n\ndeclaratory judgment counterclaim was not an independent claim for\n\naffirmative relief because it did not seek relief beyond what the defendant\n\n\n\n                                      42\n\fwould be entitled to upon disposition of the plaintiff’s claims, and did not\n\nsurvive the plaintiff’s nonsuit.   Thus, the defendant was not entitled to\n\nattorney’s fees under the UDJA. In this case, Coffeehouse and the Trust\n\ndid specifically plead for affirmative declaratory judgment relief as an\n\nindependent claim, separate and apart from the request for partition and\n\nwinding-up of the Partnership, which relief was granted by the Trial Court’s\n\nOrder Granting Partial Summary Judgment and incorporated into the final\n\nJudgment. CR1 91, CR2 369, 437; Appendix, tabs 1, 8 and 9.\n\n      The Saks Parties also argue that Coffeehouse and the Trust\n\nimproperly pleaded the claims for partition and winding-up of the\n\npartnership as a declaratory judgment action for the sole purpose of\n\nrecovering attorney’s fees. However, it was necessary for Appellees to\n\ninclude a request for declaratory relief due to the Saks Parties’ vexatious\n\ninsistence that they own interests in the Property and the Partnership\n\ndespite the MSA, Arbitration Award, and Probate Court Orders providing\n\notherwise. CR1 186-194, 198-199, 205-206, 245-261, 278, 281; Appendix,\n\ntabs 4, 5 and 6. Furthermore, in light of the Saks Parties’ unreasonable\n\nand burdensome claims, the attorney’s fees awarded against them are\n\nequitable and just.\n\n\n\n\n                                      43\n\f     The UDJA is intended to settle and provide relief from uncertainty and\n\ninsecurity with respect to rights, and is to be liberally construed and\n\nadministered. Roberts, 394 S.W.3d at 50. Pursuant to Section 37.004 of\n\nthe UDJA:\n\n            A person interested under a deed, will, written\n\n            contract, or other writings constituting a contract or\n\n            whose rights, status, or other legal relations are\n\n            affected by a statute, municipal ordinance, contract,\n\n            or franchise may have determined any question of\n\n            construction or validity arising under the instrument,\n\n            statute, ordinance, contract, or franchise and obtain\n\n            a declaration of rights, status or other legal relations\n\n            thereunder.\n\nAppendix, tab 10.      That is exactly what Coffeehouse and the Trust\n\nrequested and what the Court did—determine the validity of various\n\ninstruments, including purported Assignments of Partnership interests and\n\nthe McFadin Deed, in construction with the MSA, Arbitration Award, and\n\nProbate Court orders, and declare the rights and status of the parties\n\nthereunder. CR1 88-91.\n\n\n\n\n                                      44\n\f      The Saks Parties state that “a party may not artfully plead a title\n\ndispute as a declaratory judgment action,” citing to I-10 Colony, Inc. v.\n\nChao Kuan Lee, 393 S.W.3d 467, 475 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n2012, pet denied). The Saks Parties, however, have artfully left out an\n\nimportant part of the court’s holding in I-10 Colony, which actually provides:\n\n            Given the mandatory language in Property Code\n\n            section 22.001 (“[a] trespass to try title action is the\n\n            method of determining title”) (emphasis added), a\n\n            party may not artfully plead a title dispute as a\n\n            declaratory judgment action just to obtain attorney’s\n\n            fees when that claim should have been brought as a\n\n            trespass-to-try-title action.\n\nA trespass-to-try-title lawsuit is an action to recover possession of land\n\nwithheld from an owner with a right to immediate possession, and imposes\n\nunique pleading and proof requirements. I-10 Colony, 393 S.W.3d at 475;\n\nFlorey, 212 S.W.3d at 449. Not all actions impacting title and possessory\n\nrights to property are necessarily trespass-to-try-title actions, and it is\n\ndoubtful “that the legislature intended for the trespass-to-try title statute to\n\ndisplace or subsume every statutory or common law claim (e.g. suits to\n\n\n\n\n                                       45\n\frescind deeds) having such an impact.” Id. This case cannot be properly\n\ncalled a trespass-to-try title action.\n\n      The Saks Parties also cite Barfield v. Holland, 844 S.W.2d 759, 771\n\n(Tex. App.—Tyler 1992, writ denied), in support of their argument that it is\n\nimproper to use the UDJA to settle a land title dispute and seek an award\n\nof attorney’s fees.      However, in Barfield, there was no question of\n\n“construction” or “validity” of the deeds by which the parties acquired their\n\ntitle, and, therefore, it was not the proper subject matter for a declaratory\n\njudgment. As in the I-10 Colony case, the court in Barfield found that the\n\nsuit was an action for trespass-to-try-title. Barfield, 844 S.W.2d at 771.\n\nAlso, in that case, there was no question of the ownership of a related\n\npartnership and the validity of assignments of interests in such partnership,\n\nas there is in this case.\n\n      This case is not a trespass-to-try-title action, and the Saks Parties do\n\nnot argue that it should have properly been brought as one. There is no\n\ndispute between Coffeehouse and the Trust as to their ownership interests\n\nin the Property or the Partnership, or who is entitled to possession. This is\n\na unique case in which it was necessary to invalidate instruments\n\nfraudulently filed by Sandra, and confirm that the Trust still exists as an\n\nowner of the Property and the Partnership, so that the Property could be\n\n\n\n                                         46\n\fsold and the Partnership could be terminated. Furthermore, much of the\n\nrequested declaratory relief has to do with voiding the Assignments of\n\nPartnership interests, and declaring the interests of its partners, which\n\nwould not be the subject of a trespass-to-try-title or any other real property\n\ntitle claim.    Therefore, the requests to invalidate the fraudulently filed\n\nAssignments and the McFadin Deed, and confirm ownership in the\n\nProperty and the Partnership as a result of such determination, were\n\nproperly asserted under the UDJA.            Therefore, the Trial Court was\n\nstatutorily authorized to award attorney’s fees to Coffeehouse and the\n\nTrust.\n\n         The Saks Parties further claim that the Judgments in this case did not\n\ninclude any substantial relief that was not recoverable under the causes of\n\naction for partition of the Property and winding-up of the Partnership, but\n\nthe cases cited by the Saks Parties are not on point. In Aaron Rents, Inc.\n\nV. Travis Cent. Appraisal Dist., 212 S.W.3d 665 (Tex. App.—Austin 2006,\n\nno pet.), the plaintiff appealed a property tax decision of the Travis County\n\nAppraisal Review Board to the district court. The appellate court held that\n\nthe plaintiff could not use the UDJA solely to obtain attorney’s fees\n\nbecause, when a statute provides an avenue for attacking an agency order,\n\na declaratory judgment action will not lie to provide redundant remedies.\n\n\n\n                                        47\n\fId. at 669.   Another case cited by the Saks Parties, Cytogenix, Inc. v.\n\nWaldroff, 213 S.W.3d 479 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2006, no pet.), is\n\na breach of contract case, in which both the plaintiff and defendant also\n\npleaded for declaratory judgment. The court held that the plaintiffs were\n\nnot entitled to attorney’s fees under the UDJA because they did not recover\n\nany actual damages, and they could not use declaratory relief, identical to\n\nthe breach of contract claim, to recover attorney’s fees not otherwise\n\navailable. Id. at 489-90. Similarly, the court held that, upon reversal of the\n\njudgment in favor of plaintiffs, the defendant was not entitled to attorney’s\n\nfees under the UDJA because its claim for declaratory relief was nothing\n\nmore than a suit in avoidance of a contract, and it did not recover any\n\nactual damages either. Id. at 490-91. These cases are not applicable or\n\ndeterminative of this case.\n\n      It is clear that the declaratory relief requested by Coffeehouse and\n\nthe Trust is not redundant of the other claims. In addition to asking the\n\nTrial Court to partition the Property by sale and to wind-up and terminate\n\nthe Partnership, Appellees also asked the Court to void the invalid\n\ninstruments and thus declare that Appellants and other parties owned no\n\ninterest in the Property or the Partnership. This relief is necessary and\n\nrelated to, but not duplicative of, the request for partition of the Property\n\n\n\n                                     48\n\fand winding-up and termination of the Partnership. The relief requested in\n\nthis case is similar to that requested in the Roberts and the Wheeler cases,\n\nwhich were suits for partition and declaratory relief in which the appellate\n\ncourts affirmed attorney’s fees awarded under the UDJA.\n\n      In Roberts, the plaintiff sought partition of real and personal property\n\nand a declaratory judgment relating to property inherited by her spouse,\n\nasking the Court to construe the wills and partition deed by which her\n\nspouse obtained his interest in the property in order to resolve the dispute\n\nabout her ownership of these interests. 394 S.W.3d at 49. On summary\n\njudgment, the trial court granted the plaintiff’s request for declaratory relief\n\nand ruled that she was entitled to attorney’s fees. Id. at 48-49. Partition of\n\nthe property was then ordered after a bench trial. Id. at 49. On appeal, the\n\ndefendants argued that the plaintiff failed to establish statutory authority for\n\na claim for attorney’s fees, but the court of appeals held that because the\n\nplaintiff sought declaratory judgment pursuant to the UDJA, the trial court\n\nwas statutorily authorized to award reasonable and necessary attorney’s\n\nfees, in its discretion. Id. at 55.\n\n      At issue in the Wheeler case was real property originally owned by\n\nBen Jones that was bequeathed to his four children, and then passed down\n\nto the children’s heirs.    2011 WL 4011455 at *1.       Through a series of\n\n\n\n                                      49\n\fpurchases, Wheeler obtained a large fractional undivided interest in the\n\nproperty from the heirs of Ben Jones’ children. Id. Two of the Jones heirs\n\nfiled suit against Wheeler and other known and unknown Jones heirs for\n\npartition of the property and to declare ownership interests, also seeking to\n\nrecover the attorney’s fees incurred for the common benefit of the joint\n\nowners. Id. at *2. The appellate court found that the trial court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in awarding attorney’s fees under the UDJA, because,\n\nin addition to seeking a partition of the property, the plaintiffs also sought\n\ndeclaratory judgment construing the Jones will and certain deeds and other\n\ninstruments, and determining the joint owners and their proportionate\n\ninterests. Id. at *9-10.\n\n      Coffeehouse     appropriately   pleaded   for   declaratory   relief   as\n\nauthorized under the UDJA, which relief was not redundant of its request\n\nfor partition of the Property and winding-up and termination of the\n\nPartnership. The Trial Court was statutorily authorized to award attorney’s\n\nfees to Coffeehouse and the Trust and did not abuse its discretion in doing\n\nso.\n\n      ISSUE NO. 2(b): Did Appellants waive any issue regarding\n                      failure to segregate attorney’s fees?\n\n      Appellants also argue that Coffeehouse and the Trust failed to\n\nsegregate their attorney’s fees under the UDJA from their other causes of\n\n                                      50\n\faction and among the other parties, and therefore, the Trial Court’s award\n\nwas an abuse of discretion. However, Appellants have waived this issue.\n\nIn a bench trial, “if the trial court awards a fee based upon evidence of\n\nservices or time spent that should have been segregated but was not, the\n\nopposing party must object to the trial court’s error by postjudgment\n\nmotion in order to urge that error on appeal.” O’Farrill Avila v. Gonzalez,\n\n974 S.W.2d 237, 249 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1998, pet. denied) (citing\n\nSouthern Concrete Co. v. Metrotec Fin. Inc., 775 S.W.2d 446, 450 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Dallas 1989, no writ)). Appellants filed no motion for new trial, nor\n\ndid they make any other postjudgment objection regarding failure to\n\nsegregate. Thus, they have failed to preserve this issue for appeal.\n\n     ISSUE NO. 2(c): Did the Trial Court err in awarding the full\n                     amount of attorney’s fees requested by\n                     Coffeehouse and the Trust?\n\n     The Trial Court did not err in awarding the full amount of fees\n\nrequested by Coffeehouse and the Trust because the attorneys’ discrete\n\nlegal services advanced both the declaratory judgment claim and the suit\n\nfor partition and winding-up of the Partnership. See Tony Gullo Motors I,\n\nL.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 313 (Tex. 2006). The need to segregate\n\nattorney’s fees is a question of law, subject to de novo review. Tony Gullo,\n\n212 S.W.3d at 312; Approach Res. I, L.P. v. Clayton, 360 S.W.3d 632, 641\n\n\n\n                                     51\n\f(Tex. App.—El Paso 2012, no pet.); Penhollow Custom Homes, LLC v.\n\nKim, 320 S.W.3d 366, 374 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2010, no pet.). In the Trial\n\nCourt, Coffeehouse’s designated expert on attorney’s fees, attorney Paul T.\n\nCurl, testified as follows:\n\n      Q:    And as I briefly addressed earlier, we did not\n\n            segregate the fees in this case. So in your opinion\n\n            would it have even been possible to segregate the\n\n            fees    and       expenses   incurred   by   Broadway\n\n            Coffeehouse in pursuing its declaratory judgment\n\n            action to declare the invalid deeds and other\n\n            instruments void from the fees and expenses\n\n            incurred by Broadway Coffeehouse in seeking\n\n            partition of the property and termination of the\n\n            partnership?\n\n      A:    I don’t think that would be reasonable or practical.\n\n      Q:    And if you could explain why.\n\n      A:    Sure. As a practical matter, virtually everything that\n\n            we did was geared toward the declaratory judgment\n\n            claim: Fixing ownership interest in the property and\n\n            the partnership, declaring the deeds void, the other\n\n\n\n                                         52\n\f     instruments. And that was really key to this whole\n\n     thing because the property could not be sold until\n\n     that was done. And that was a problem with both\n\n     these instruments clouding the title.     So all --\n\n     everything -- virtually everything that we did\n\n     advanced the declaratory judgment claim. And I\n\n     don’t think it would be fair or reasonable to\n\n     segregate those out and those other -- the other\n\n     claims. Even if the other claims had not been there,\n\n     95 percent or more of the services would still have\n\n     been required.\n\nQ:   And against whom or against what defendants are\n\n     we seeking an award of attorneys’ fees today?\n\nA:   We are seeking an award of attorneys’ fees against\n\n     Sandra Saks, Lee Nick McFadin, III, and Landen\n\n     Saks because they are the parties who had fought\n\n     us tooth and nail on this case.\n\nQ:   Okay.\n\nA:   And again as to -- going back to your question\n\n     about segregation, I don’t think you could fairly\n\n\n\n                               53\n\f          segregate as between the defendants because\n\n          really they are the defendants who have caused the\n\n          fight. The Trust was on our side from the word go.\n\n          Lauren Saks was on our side once we found out\n\n          that she had answered. She had filed a pro se\n\n          answer that initially was not served on us. Diana\n\n          Flores opposed us represented by Ron Shaw, but\n\n          when we got to the summary judgment hearing, she\n\n          folded her tent and approved the judgment. But\n\n          even she was only making the same arguments\n\n          basically adopting the same things that Sandra\n\n          Saks and Lee Nick McFadin were arguing. So there\n\n          is no question that the opponents were Saks,\n\n          McFadin, and Landen Saks. And even if the other\n\n          defendants had not been in the case, we would\n\n          have been doing virtually the same amount of work.\n\n          So I don’t think we can segregate them out to the\n\n          defendants.\n\nDec. RR 44:22-45:23.\n\n\n\n\n                                 54\n\f     The standard set forth in Tony Gullo does not require more precise\n\nproof for attorney’s fees than for any other claims or expenses.          212\n\nS.W.3d at 314. Based on Mr. Curl’s testimony, the Trial Court properly\n\ndetermined that segregation of the requested attorney’s fees was not\n\nnecessary, and did not err in awarding the full amount of fees asked for at\n\ntrial. See Tony Gullo, 212 S.W.3d at 314 (explaining that, for the trial court\n\nto determine that segregation of the contract and fraud claim fees was not\n\nnecessary, an opinion would have sufficed stating that 95 percent of the\n\nattorney’s drafting time would have been necessary even if there had been\n\nno fraud claim).\n\n     ISSUE NO. 3(a): Is Appellants’ Issue No. 3 regarding the\n                     amount of the supersedeas bond moot\n                     because it has been waived by Appellants,\n                     and does this Court therefore lack\n                     jurisdiction?\n\n     The Saks Parties endeavor to challenge the Trial Court’s Order\n\nsetting the amount of the supersedeas bond as an abuse of discretion.\n\nCR2 457.     Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 24.4(a) prescribes the\n\nmethod for appellate review of the trial court’s ruling on the amount of a\n\nsupersedeas bond. Appendix, tab 16. That review is “by motion in the\n\ncourt of appeals with jurisdiction . . . over the appeal from the judgment in\n\n\n\n\n                                     55\n\fthe case.” Id. Any further appellate review after that motion is “by petition\n\nfor writ of mandamus in the Supreme Court.” Id.\n\n     The Saks Parties filed the motion prescribed by Rule 24.4(a) in this\n\nCourt on November 3, 2014. Appendix, tab 12. This Court denied that\n\nmotion in an Order signed on November 7, 2014. Appendix, tab 13. The\n\nSaks Parties then filed a Motion to Reconsider En Banc Motion to Suspend\n\nthe Judgment and to Review Order Setting the Amount of Supersedeas\n\nBond on November 17, 2014. Appendix, tab 14. The Court denied that\n\nmotion in an Order signed on November 21, 2014. Appendix, tab 15. The\n\nSaks Parties did not file a petition for writ of mandamus in the Supreme\n\nCourt of Texas as Rule 24.4(a) directs for further review from either of this\n\nCourt’s Orders.\n\n     The Saks Parties present no new arguments on this issue in their\n\nBrief. They offer no ground or argument relating to supersedeas on which\n\nthe Court has not already ruled in its review of the supersedeas based on\n\nthe Saks Parties’ Motions under Rule 24.4. The Saks Parties do not argue\n\nthis Court erred when it denied their motions for review of the trial court’s\n\norder setting the amount of security. Nor do The Saks Parties offer any\n\nreason why this Court should reconsider its prior Orders. The Saks Parties’\n\nIssue No. 3 challenges the Trial Court’s Order setting the amount of the\n\n\n\n                                     56\n\fsupersedeas bond, but what the Trial Court did no longer matters. This\n\nCourt has reviewed what the Trial Court did, and affirmed it.\n\n      Thus, the Saks Parties’ Issue No. 3 is moot because it has already\n\nbeen reviewed and decided.         An issue is moot when the controversy\n\nceases to exist or if the trial court’s actions cannot affect the parties’ rights.\n\nHoard Gainer Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Gollin, No. 01-03-01320-CV, 2005 WL\n\n1646116, *1-2 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] July 14, 2005, no pet.) So it\n\nis here with the amount of the supersedeas bond. Because the issue is\n\nmoot, the Court lacks jurisdiction to decide this issue. Id. And because the\n\nSaks Parties did not seek review in the Supreme Court of this Court’s\n\nOrders or even ask this Court to reconsider its Orders on this issue, the\n\nSaks Parties have waived any challenge to the amount for supersedeas.\n\nReview of a supersedeas amount is under an abuse of discretion standard,\n\nso it presents a question of law. Cf. In re Bass, 113 S.W.3d 735, 738 (Tex.\n\n2003, orig. proc.) (abuse of discretion is error in application of legal\n\nprinciples). This Court has already decided that question of law by denying\n\nthe Saks Parties’ Motions; therefore the law of the case doctrine and the\n\npolicies on which that doctrine is based prevent further challenge on this\n\nissue as well. See Jones Gonzalez, P.C. v. Trinh, 340 S.W.3d 830, 836\n\n(Tex. App.—San Antonio 2011, no pet.).\n\n\n\n                                       57\n\f     Furthermore, there is no grant of jurisdiction or prescription of a\n\nmethod for review of orders on superseding judgments other than what is\n\nprovided in Rule 24.4(a). A motion under Rule 24.4(a) is “[t]he proper\n\nmethod to seek review of a trial court’s determination” on suspending\n\nenforcement of a judgment. Reagan v. NPOT Partners I, L.P., No. 06-08-\n\n00071-CV, 2009 WL 763565, at *7 (Tex. App.—Texarkana March 25, 2009,\n\npet rev. dism’d). Thus, beyond mootness and waiver, Appellants’ Issue No.\n\n3 also fails for lack of jurisdiction on this basis as well. Appellants cite\n\nAppellate Rule of Procedure 25 as the basis for jurisdiction over their\n\nappeal.   Appellants’ Brief, at 2.   Rule 25, however, is not a grant of\n\njurisdiction. It provides the method for commencing an appeal when the\n\nCourt has subject matter jurisdiction for an appeal. Most commonly, that\n\njurisdiction is under Section 51.012 of the Texas Civil Practice and\n\nRemedies Code or Section 22.220 of the Texas Government Code. Those\n\nstatutes provide this Court jurisdiction over appeals from final judgments,\n\nnot orders on supersedeas bonds.          Appellate courts generally lack\n\njurisdiction over appeals from post-judgment orders on enforcing a\n\njudgment. Davis, 2015 WL 1004357 at *5. Following that rule, there is no\n\njurisdiction (under Section 51.012 or Section 22.220) for an appeal from an\n\norder on suspending enforcement of a judgment.\n\n\n\n                                     58\n\f     Finally, this Court would not have jurisdiction over an appeal of the\n\nOrder setting the amount of the supersedeas bond because the Saks\n\nParties’ Notice of Appeal of this Order was untimely. Pursuant to Texas\n\nRule of Appellate Procedure 26.1, a notice of appeal must be filed within\n\nthirty days after the judgment is signed.     Appendix, tab 16.    The Trial\n\nCourt’s Order on the supersedeas bond was signed on October 31, 2014.\n\nCR 457; Appendix, tab 11. On February 20, 2015, 112 days later and on\n\nthe same day that they filed their brief, the Saks Parties filed a Supplement\n\nto Notice of Appeal attempting to add the Order setting the amount of the\n\nsupersedeas bond to this appeal.          Appendix, tab 17.    Because the\n\nSupplement to Notice of Appeal was filed almost four months after the\n\nOrder was signed, the appeal was not timely perfected, and the appeal of\n\nthe Order on the supersedeas bond must be dismissed. See In re A.L.B.,\n\n56 S.W.3d 651 (Tex. App.—Waco 2001, no pet.).\n\n     ISSUE NO. 3(b): Did the Trial Court abuse its discretion in\n                     setting the amount of the supersedeas\n                     bond?\n\n     Finally, if the Court does consider (or reconsider) the substance of\n\nthe Saks Parties’ Issue No. 3, the Court should reject it. Review of the\n\namount of security for supersedeas is a test for abuse of discretion. In re\n\nEstate of Hernandez, No. 04-14-00046-CV, 2014 WL 1713566, at *2 (Tex.\n\n\n\n                                     59\n\fApp.—San Antonio April 30, 2014, no pet.) The question for this Court is\n\nnot whether it would have reached the same conclusion as the Trial Court,\n\nbut whether the Trial Court acted without reference to any guiding rule or\n\nprinciple or acted arbitrarily or unreasonable. Id.\n\n      The Trial Court did what Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 24.2\n\nprescribes.   To the extent the Judgment involves an interest in real\n\nproperty, Rule 24.2(a)(2)(A) applies, and directs the Trial Court to set an\n\namount of security of at least the value of the property’s rent or revenue.\n\nCR2 459; Appendix, tab 16. The evidence of that monthly rent or revenue\n\nwas undisputed, and the trial court multiplied the rent by a reasonable\n\nestimate of the time for disposing of Appellants’ inevitable appeals. Nov.\n\n14 RR 11:4-19, 29:9-30:6, 50:8-51:20.\n\n      If the Judgment is not subject to Rule 24.2(a)(2)(A), then Rule\n\n24.2(a)(2)(B) applies, and the Trial Court had discretion to set the\n\nnecessary security in an amount the Trial Court decided would be\n\nnecessary to protect Coffeehouse and the Trust from damage that an\n\nappeal might cause. CR2 459; Nov. RR 21:9-25, 31:16, 32:9; Appendix,\n\ntab 16. The Trial Court’s Order, supported by the evidence, does just that,\n\nand the Trial Court did not abuse its discretion.

Saks, challenge a judgment confirming an arbitration award and an order in aid of\n\f                                                                    04-13-00518-CV; 04-13-00875-CV\n\n\nenforcement of judgment. The appellees, Lauren Saks and Marcus P. Rogers, urge us to affirm the\n\njudgment confirming the arbitration award and to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction the appeal from\n\nthe order in aid of enforcement of judgment. We affirm the judgment confirming the arbitration\n\naward, but dismiss for lack of jurisdiction the appeal from the order in aid of enforcement of\n\njudgment.\n\n                                         BACKGROUND\n\n       These appeals arise from disputes concerning an inter vivos trust. In 1991, Sandra created\n\nthe trust for the benefit of her children, “Gloria Lauren Nicole Saks [‘Lauren’] and Margaret\n\nLanden Saks Merriman [‘Landen’] and any other children later born or legally adopted . . . by\n\nSandra Saks [‘Sandra’].” In accordance with the terms of the trust agreement, Sandra’s sister,\n\nDiane Flores, was appointed trustee. Lauren and Landen are the trust’s sole beneficiaries.\n\n       In August 2011, Lauren filed suit against Flores, the trustee, and Sandra, the settlor, in a\n\nstatutory probate court in Bexar County, Texas. The suit, which alleged breaches of fiduciary duty\n\nand failures to comply with the trust agreement, sought an accounting and a constructive trust.\n\nLauren also sought Flores’s removal as trustee. On December 28, 2011, the probate court\n\nappointed Marcus P. Rogers as interim trustee. Thereafter, Rogers submitted a report to the probate\n\ncourt in which he concluded that any attempt by Flores to terminate the trust was ineffective.\n\n       On April 2, 2012, the parties entered into a mediated settlement agreement (“MSA”). The\n\nMSA required the parties to resolve future disputes by mediation and arbitration. Specifically, the\n\nMSA provided,\n\n       If one or more disputes arise with regard to the interpretation and/or performance\n       of this Agreement or any of its provisions, including the form of further documents\n       to be executed, the Parties agree to further mediation in an attempt to resolve same\n       with Thomas Smith, the Mediator[] who facilitated this settlement. In the event a\n       dispute arises between the Parties, it is hereby agreed that the dispute shall be\n       referred to Thomas Smith, the Mediator herein, for arbitration in accordance with\n       the applicable United States Arbitration and Mediation Rules of Arbitration. The\n                                               -2-\n\f                                                                        04-13-00518-CV; 04-13-00875-CV\n\n\n        arbitrator’s decision shall be final and legally binding and judgment may be entered\n        thereon . . . .\n\n        On May 8, 2012, the probate court signed an order approving the MSA and authorizing\n\nRogers, the interim trustee, to sign the MSA. However, the order approving the MSA did not\n\ndismiss the claims in the underlying suit.\n\n        On August 21, 2012, Lauren filed a motion to compel arbitration, claiming that matters\n\nregarding the interpretation and performance of the MSA remained unresolved. On September 4,\n\n2012, the probate court, in accordance with the MSA, ordered Sandra, Lauren, Landen, and Rogers\n\nto attend mediation and, if necessary, arbitration. The arbitration took place on October 18, 2012.\n\nThe arbitrator’s award ordered Sandra and Flores to execute certain documents conveying to the\n\ntrust all of their rights, title, and interest in certain property “no later than October 31, 2012.”\n\n        Sandra filed a motion asking the probate court to vacate the arbitrator’s award. The motion\n\nwas denied. Landen did not ask the probate court to vacate the arbitrator’s award.\n\n        On May 7, 2013, the probate court signed a final judgment confirming the arbitrator’s\n\naward. The probate court incorporated the arbitration award into its judgment and entered it as a\n\njudgment of the court. The arbitration award ordered Sandra and Landen to execute certain\n\nconveyance documents. Sandra and Landen appealed the judgment confirming the arbitrator’s\n\naward. This appeal was docketed in this court as appellate cause number 04-13-00518-CV.\n\n        On November 14, 2013, the trial court signed an order titled, “Order in Aid of Enforcement\n\nof Judgment.” In this order, the probate court found that Sandra and Landen had failed to comply\n\nwith the arbitration award and the judgment confirming the arbitration award by failing to execute\n\nthe conveyance documents as previously ordered, and deemed the documents executed. Sandra\n\nand Landen appealed this order. The latter appeal was docketed in this court as appellate cause\n\nnumber 04-13-00875-CV.\n\n\n                                                  -3-\n\f                                                                     04-13-00518-CV; 04-13-00875-CV\n\n\n                      JUDGMENT CONFIRMING THE ARBITRATION AWARD\n\n       An arbitration award is given the same effect as a judgment of last resort and is conclusive\n\nas to all matters of fact and law. CVN Group, Inc. v. Delgado, 95 S.W.3d 234, 238 (Tex. 2002);\n\nStieren v. McBroom, 103 S.W.3d 602, 605 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2003, pet. denied).

In conducting this review, we indulge all reasonable presumptions in favor of\n\nupholding the arbitration award. Gaiser Precast Constr., 394 S.W.3d at 824; GJR Mgmt.

Werline, 307 S.W.3d 267,\n\n271 (Tex. 2010).\n\n       No one disputes that the arbitration agreement in this case is governed by the Texas\n\nArbitration Act (“TAA”). See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. 171.001-.098 (West 2011). The\n\nTAA requires a trial court to confirm an arbitration award upon a party’s application unless a party\n\noffers grounds for vacating, modifying, or correcting the award. Callahan & Assoc. v. Orangefield\n\nIndep. Sch. Dist., 92 S.W.3d 841, 844 (Tex. 2002) (citing TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN.\n\n§ 171.087 (West 2011)). When no grounds for vacating the award are presented, the trial court “on\n\napplication of a party, shall confirm the award.” TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 171.087.\n\n       Bexar County Probate Courts Nos. 1 and 2 are statutory probate courts. See TEX. GOV’T\n\nCODE ANN. § 25.0171(c) (West Supp. 2014). Statutory probate courts have jurisdiction over\n\nactions by or against a trustee and actions involving inter vivos trusts. See TEX. ESTATES CODE\n\nANN. § 32.006 (West 2014). This jurisdiction is concurrent with the jurisdiction of the district\n\ncourts. See TEX. ESTATES CODE ANN. § 32.007 (West 2014). Statutory probate courts also have\n                                                -4-\n\f                                                                                      04-13-00518-CV; 04-13-00875-CV\n\n\njurisdiction over other matters, such as probate proceedings. Stauffer v. Nicholson, 438 S.W.3d\n\n205, 215 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2014, no pet.).\n\nJurisdictional Arguments\n\n            As a threshold matter, we note the arguments presented by Sandra and Landen are unrelated\n\nto any grounds presented in Sandra’s motion to vacate the arbitration award. 1 Instead, Sandra and\n\nLanden argue the probate court was deprived of subject matter jurisdiction both at the time it\n\ncompelled arbitration and at the time it rendered judgment confirming the arbitration award. 2 In\n\nmaking these jurisdictional arguments, Sandra and Landen acknowledge that the probate court\n\nacquired subject matter jurisdiction over Lauren’s suit. However, according to Sandra and Landen,\n\nprior to compelling arbitration, the probate court lost subject matter jurisdiction either because (1)\n\nthe trust had terminated or (2) the probate court’s plenary power had expired. In response, Lauren\n\nand Rogers argue the probate court did not lose subject matter jurisdiction prior to compelling\n\narbitration or prior to confirming the arbitration award.\n\n            We will address both jurisdictional theories presented by Sandra and Landen. Under their\n\nfirst theory, that the probate court lost subject matter jurisdiction because of the termination of the\n\ntrust, Sandra and Landen contend that under the language of the trust agreement, Flores, as trustee,\n\n\n\n1\n    Landen filed a motion for new trial but did not file a motion to vacate the arbitration award.\n2\n    In appellate cause number 04-13-00518-CV, Sandra and Landen state their issues as follows:\n\n       1.   Did the trial court’s plenary power end on June 9, 2012, which was 30 days after the M[ediated]\n            S[ettlement] A[greement] was approved on May 8, 2012?\n\n       2.   Did the court lack jurisdiction to compel the parties to arbitration pursuant to an [o]rder dated September\n            5, 2012?\n\n       3.   Was the arbitration award void because arbitration was commenced pursuant to a void court order rather\n            than pursuant to a petition for arbitration filed in accordance with the United States Arbitration and\n            Mediation Rules of Arbitration as provided in the Mediated Settlement Agreement?\n\n       4.   Was the trial court’s [j]udgment signed on May 7, 2013, approving a void arbitration award also void?\n\n                                                             -5-\n\f                                                                         04-13-00518-CV; 04-13-00875-CV\n\n\nwas authorized to terminate the trust and distribute the trust assets to the income beneficiaries.\n\nThey further contend that, on or about December 21, 2011, Flores terminated the trust in\n\naccordance with the trust agreement, and the termination deprived the probate court of jurisdiction\n\nto compel arbitration.\n\n        In response, Lauren and Rogers argue the trust was never terminated. This argument is\n\nsupported by the record. Both the MSA reached by the parties and the arbitration award are\n\npremised on the notion that the trust was not terminated. Additionally, Lauren argues that, even if\n\nthe trust had been terminated, the probate court would not have been deprived of jurisdiction.\n\nAccording to Lauren, the probate court’s jurisdiction was invoked when she filed the underlying\n\nsuit alleging claims for breach of fiduciary duty and failures to comply with the trust agreement.\n\nLauren contends that even if the trust had been terminated on December 21, 2011, her claims\n\nwould have survived the termination of the trust, and therefore, the probate court would have\n\nretained subject matter jurisdiction. We find Lauren and Rogers’s arguments convincing. We\n\nconclude that the probate court was not deprived of jurisdiction based on the argument that the\n\ntrust was terminated.\n\n        Under their second theory, Sandra and Landen argue that the order compelling arbitration\n\nand the judgment confirming the arbitration award are void because they were signed after the\n\nprobate court’s plenary power expired. This argument is based on the theory that the order\n\napproving the MSA constituted rendition of a final judgment and the probate court’s jurisdiction\n\nended thirty days after it signed the order approving the MSA.\n\n        Mere approval of a settlement agreement does not constitute rendition of judgment.

And, as a general rule, “a judgment issued\n\nwithout a conventional trial is final if and only if either it actually disposes of all claims and parties\n\nthen before the court, regardless of its language, or it states with unmistakable clarity that it is a\n                                                   -6-\n\f                                                                        04-13-00518-CV; 04-13-00875-CV\n\n\nfinal judgment.” Lehmann v. Har-Con Corp., 39 S.W.3d 191, 192-93 (Tex. 2001). Courts\n\ndetermine whether an order amounts to a final judgment from its language and from the record in\n\nthe case. Id. at 195.\n\n        Here, the order approving the MSA provided, in relevant part,\n\n        IT IS THEREFORE, ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the Court\n        approves the Mediated Settlement Agreement attached to the Motion to Approve\n        Settlement Agreement as Exhibit “A;” that Marcus P. Rogers, Interim Trustee of\n        the Saks Children Family Trust or ATFL&L, is authorized to sign the Mediated\n        Settlement Agreement attached to this Motion.\n\nThus, the order approving the MSA did not dispose of all claims and parties before the probate\n\ncourt, nor did it state with unmistakable clarity that it was a final judgment. See Lehmann, 39\n\nS.W.3d at 192-93. Additionally, nothing in the record indicates that the order approving the MSA\n\nwas a final judgment. Because the MSA was not a final judgment, the probate court’s plenary\n\npower did not expire thirty days after the probate court signed the order.\n\n        The only case cited by Sandra and Landen that arguably supports their jurisdictional\n\narguments is Goodman v. Summit at West Rim, Ltd., 952 S.W.2d 930 (Tex. App.—Austin 1997,\n\nno pet.). In Goodman, the executor of a decedent’s estate filed suit in the probate court to clear\n\ntitle to property owned by the estate. Id. at 932. In response, the defendant brought third-party\n\nclaims against other entities. Id. Initially, the probate court exercised its ancillary jurisdiction over\n\nthe third-party claims. Id. However, once matters concerning the estate were settled, the probate\n\ncourt dismissed all of the claims by and against the estate. Id. Thereafter, the third-party defendants\n\nmoved to dismiss the claims against them on the ground that, once the claims involving the estate\n\nwere settled, the probate court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the ancillary claims.\n\nId. The probate court agreed and dismissed the ancillary claims from the probate court. Id. The\n\ncourt of appeals upheld the dismissal, noting that the “probate court had discretion to resolve\n\nancillary claims against third parties only to the extent that such claims were necessary to resolve\n                                                  -7-\n\f                                                                                    04-13-00518-CV; 04-13-00875-CV\n\n\nclaims within its original jurisdiction. . . . The court’s discretion undoubtedly vanished with the\n\ndismissal of the estate from the probate proceeding.” Id. at 934.\n\n         Sandra and Landen’s reliance on Goodman is misplaced. Goodman involved the probate\n\ncourt’s ancillary jurisdiction over a claim related to a decedent’s estate. Id. at 933. However, unlike\n\nGoodman, the present case was not a probate proceeding and it did not involve the exercise of\n\nancillary jurisdiction. See TEX. ESTATES CODE ANN. § 22.029 (West 2014) (defining probate\n\nproceedings as proceedings or matters relating to a decedent’s estate). Instead, the present case\n\nwas an action against a trustee and it involved an inter vivos trust. See TEX. ESTATES CODE ANN.\n\n§ 32.006; Nicholson, 438 S.W.3d at 214-15 (acknowledging that a statutory probate court has\n\njurisdiction not only over matters against a trustee or involving an inter vivos trust, but also over\n\nprobate proceedings). Thus, Goodman is inapplicable to the present case.\n\n         We conclude the probate court had subject matter jurisdiction at the time it compelled\n\narbitration and at the time it rendered judgment confirming the arbitration award. 3 We, therefore,\n\noverrule Sandra and Landen’s arguments that the order compelling arbitration and the judgment\n\nconfirming the arbitration award were void.\n\nRemaining arguments\n\n         Rule 38.1(i) of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure requires a brief to contain a “clear\n\nand concise argument for the contentions made with appropriate citations to authorities and to the\n\nrecord.” TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i). An appellate issue unsupported by argument or citation to the\n\nrecord or by appropriate legal authority presents nothing for our review. Blankinship v. Brown,\n\n399 S.W.3d 303, 307 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2013, pet. denied). “Failure to cite legal authority or to\n\n\n3\n We further note that the Texas Arbitration Act confers jurisdiction on trial courts to confirm arbitration awards at any\ntime. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 171.082(a) (West 2011) (“The filing with the clerk of the court of an\napplication for an order under this chapter, including a judgment or decree, invokes the jurisdiction of the court.”);\nsee also §§ 171.081; 171.087 (West 2011).\n\n                                                          -8-\n\f                                                                               04-13-00518-CV; 04-13-00875-CV\n\n\nprovide substantive analysis of the legal issues presented results in waiver of the complaint.” In re\n\nEstate of Taylor, 305 S.W.3d 829, 836 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2010, no pet.). As the reviewing\n\nappellate court, we have neither a duty nor a right to perform an independent review of the record\n\nand applicable law to determine if there was error. Valadez v. Avitia, 238 S.W.3d 843, 845 (Tex.\n\nApp.—El Paso 2007, no pet.).\n\n        In their briefs, Sandra and Landen attempt to raise several other issues concerning the order\n\ncompelling arbitration and the judgment confirming the arbitration award. However, the arguments\n\nmade in support of these issues are wholly unsupported by citation to appropriate legal authority.\n\nWe, therefore, conclude that Sandra and Landen’s remaining issues challenging the judgment\n\nconfirming the arbitration award present nothing for our review. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i).\n\n                            ORDER IN AID OF ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENT\n\n        Next, Sandra and Landen challenge the probate court’s order in aid of enforcement of\n\njudgment. 4 This order states that Sandra and Landen failed to execute certain conveyance\n\ndocuments as ordered in the judgment confirming the arbitration award and deems these\n\ndocuments executed “by operation of law.”\n\n        Generally, post-judgment orders made for the purpose of carrying into effect a prior\n\njudgment are not subject to appeal because they are not final judgments. Wagner v. Warnasch, 295\n\nS.W.2d 890, 893 (Tex. 1956); Walter v. Marathon Oil Corp., 422 S.W.3d 848, 855 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2014, no pet.). A writ of execution and orders incident to such a writ are\n\ngenerally not appealable. Qualia v. Qualia, 37 S.W.3d 128, 129 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2001,\n\nno pet.). However, there are exceptions to this rule. A few types of post-judgment orders, such as\n\n\n4\n Lee Nick McFadin III also filed a notice of appeal in appellate cause number 04-13-00875-CV. Rogers has moved\nto dismiss McFadin from this appeal because McFadin was not a party below. Because we conclude that we have no\njurisdiction over an appeal from the order in aid of enforcement of judgment, Rogers’s motion to dismiss McFadin is\ndenied as moot.\n\n                                                       -9-\n\f                                                                     04-13-00518-CV; 04-13-00875-CV\n\n\nthose in the nature of a mandatory injunction, are appealable. Walter, 422 S.W.3d at 855; id.; see\n\nKennedy v. Hudnall, 249 S.W.3d 520, 523-24 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2008, no pet.) (concluding\n\na particular turnover order was not in the nature of a mandatory injunction and therefore was not\n\nappealable).\n\n       Here, Lauren argues that the general rule applies in this case, and therefore, the appeal from\n\nthe order in aid of enforcement of judgment must be dismissed. We agree that the order in aid of\n\nenforcement of judgment is not an appealable order. It is not in the nature of a mandatory\n\ninjunction; it merely carries into effect the judgment confirming the arbitration award. Thus, it is\n\nnot the type of post-judgment order that is reviewable by appeal. The appeal from the order in aid\n\nof enforcement of judgment is therefore dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. See Walter, 422 S.W.3d\n\nat 855-56 (dismissing appeal for lack of jurisdiction when challenged order did not fall within the\n\nlimited class of appealable, post-judgment orders); Qualia, 37 S.W.3d at 129 (dismissing for lack\n\nof jurisdiction appeal from an order that simply provided for enforcement of a judgment in\n\nMexico).\n\n                               DAMAGES FOR FRIVOLOUS APPEAL\n\n       In a cross-issue, Rogers urges this court to impose sanctions against Sandra and Landen\n\nfor filing frivolous appeals. Rule 45 of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure allows an appellate\n\ncourt, after a determination that an appeal is frivolous, to award to the prevailing party “just\n\ndamages.” TEX. R. APP. P. 45. Typically, appellate courts award the amount of attorney’s fees\n\nincurred by the appellee as proven by testimony or affidavit. Walker v. Hardin, No. 04-03-00864-\n\nCV, 2005 WL 899926, at *2 (Tex. App.—San Antonio April 20, 2005, no pet.); see Smith v.\n\nMarshall B. Brown, P.C., 51 S.W.3d 376, 382 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2001, pet. denied)\n\n(awarding $5,000.00 in appellate attorney’s fees which were proven by affidavit). Here, however,\n\nRogers has not provided an affidavit or other proof of his attorney’s fees and expenses involved in\n                                               - 10 -\n\f                                                                       04-13-00518-CV; 04-13-00875-CV\n\n\nresponding to these appeals. We, therefore, deny Rogers’s request for sanctions against Sandra\n\nand Landen for filing frivolous appeals. See Walker, 2005 WL 899926, at *2 (declining to award\n\nappellee attorney’s fees for a frivolous appeal in the absence of proof).\n\n                                           CONCLUSION\n\n        The judgment confirming the arbitration award is affirmed. The appeal from the order in\n\naid of enforcement of judgment is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n\n                                                         Karen Angelini, Justice\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 11 -\n\fTAB 8\n\f\f\f\f\fTAB 9\n\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\fTAB 10\n\f§ 37.004.

Amount of Bond, Deposit or Security\n\n                                                           Currentness\n\n\n(a) Type of Judgment.\n\n\n  (1) For Recovery of Money. When the judgment is for money, the amount of the bond, deposit, or security must equal the\n  sum of compensatory damages awarded in the judgment, interest for the estimated duration of the appeal, and costs awarded\n  in the judgment. But the amount must not exceed the lesser of:\n\n\n    (A) 50 percent of the judgment debtor's current net worth; or\n\n\n    (B) 25 million dollars.\n\n\n  (2) For Recovery of Property. When the judgment is for the recovery of an interest in real or personal property, the trial court\n  will determine the type of security that the judgment debtor must post. The amount of that security must be at least:\n\n\n    (A) the value of the property interest's rent or revenue, if the property interest is real; or\n\n\n    (B) the value of the property interest on the date when the court rendered judgment, if the property interest is personal.\n\n\n  (3) Other Judgment. When the judgment is for something other than money or an interest in property, the trial court must\n  set the amount and type of security that the judgment debtor must post. The security must adequately protect the judgment\n  creditor against loss or damage that the appeal might cause. But the trial court may decline to permit the judgment to be\n  superseded if the judgment creditor posts security ordered by the trial court in an amount and type that will secure the judgment\n  debtor against any loss or damage caused by the relief granted the judgment creditor if an appellate court determines, on\n  final disposition, that that relief was improper.\n\n\n  (4) Conservatorship or Custody. When the judgment involves the conservatorship or custody of a minor or other person under\n  legal disability, enforcement of the judgment will not be suspended, with or without security, unless ordered by the trial\n  court. But upon a proper showing, the appellate court may suspend enforcement of the judgment with or without security.\n\n\n  (5) For a Governmental Entity. When a judgment in favor of a governmental entity in its governmental capacity is one in which\n  the entity has no pecuniary interest, the trial court must determine whether to suspend enforcement, with or without security,\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                               1\n\f24.2. Amount of Bond, Deposit or Security, TX R APP Rule 24.2\n\n\n  taking into account the harm that is likely to result to the judgment debtor if enforcement is not suspended, and the harm that\n  is likely to result to others if enforcement is suspended. The appellate court may review the trial court's determination and\n  suspend enforcement of the judgment, with or without security, or refuse to suspend the judgment. If security is required,\n  recovery is limited to the governmental entity's actual damages resulting from suspension of the judgment.\n\n\n(b) Lesser Amount. The trial court must lower the amount of security required by (a) to an amount that will not cause the\njudgment debtor substantial economic harm if, after notice to all parties and a hearing, the court finds that posting a bond,\ndeposit, or security in the amount required by (a) is likely to cause the judgment debtor substantial economic harm.\n\n\n(c) Determination of Net Worth.\n\n\n  (1) Judgment Debtor's Affidavit Required; Contents; Prima Facie Evidence. A judgment debtor who provides a bond, deposit,\n  or security under (a)(1)(A) in an amount based on the debtor's net worth must simultaneously file with the trial court clerk\n  an affidavit that states the debtor's net worth and states complete, detailed information concerning the debtor's assets and\n  liabilities from which net worth can be ascertained. An affidavit that meets these requirements is prima facie evidence of the\n  debtor's net worth for the purpose of establishing the amount of the bond, deposit, or security required to suspend enforcement\n  of the judgment. A trial court clerk must receive and file a net-worth affidavit tendered for filing by a judgment debtor.\n\n\n  (2) Contest; Discovery. A judgment creditor may file a contest to the debtor's claimed net worth. The contest need not be\n  sworn. The creditor may conduct reasonable discovery concerning the judgment debtor's net worth.\n\n\n  (3) Hearing; Burden of Proof; Findings; Additional Security. The trial court must hear a judgment creditor's contest of the\n  judgment debtor's claimed net worth promptly after any discovery has been completed. The judgment debtor has the burden of\n  proving net worth. The trial court must issue an order that states the debtor's net worth and states with particularity the factual\n  basis for that determination. If the trial court orders additional or other security to supersede the judgment, the enforcement\n  of the judgment will be suspended for twenty days after the trial court's order. If the judgment debtor does not comply with\n  the order within that period, the judgment may be enforced against the judgment debtor.\n\n\n(d) Injunction. The trial court may enjoin the judgment debtor from dissipating or transferring assets to avoid satisfaction of\nthe judgment, but the trial court may not make any order that interferes with the judgment debtor's use, transfer, conveyance,\nor dissipation of assets in the normal course of business.\n\n\nCredits\nEff.

A party may seek review of the trial court's ruling by motion filed in the court of appeals with jurisdiction\nor potential jurisdiction over the appeal from the judgment in the case. A party may seek review of the court of appeals' ruling\non the motion by petition for writ of mandamus in the Supreme Court. The appellate court may review:\n\n\n  (1) the sufficiency or excessiveness of the amount of security, but when the judgment is for money, the appellate court must\n  not modify the amount of security to exceed the limits imposed by Rule 24.2(a)(1);\n\n\n  (2) the sureties on any bond;\n\n\n  (3) the type of security;\n\n\n  (4) the determination whether to permit suspension of enforcement; and\n\n\n  (5) the trial court's exercise of discretion under Rule 24.3(a).\n\n\n(b) Grounds of Review. Review may be based both on conditions as they existed at the time the trial court signed an order, and\non changes in those conditions afterward.\n\n\n(c) Temporary Orders. The appellate court may issue any temporary orders necessary to preserve the parties' rights.\n\n\n(d) Action by Appellate Court. The motion must be heard at the earliest practicable time. The appellate court may require that the\namount of a bond, deposit, or other security be increased or decreased, and that another bond, deposit, or security be provided\nand approved by the trial court clerk. The appellate court may require other changes in the trial court order. The appellate court\nmay remand to the trial court for entry of findings of fact or for the taking of evidence.\n\n\n(e) Effect of Ruling. If the appellate court orders additional or other security to supersede the judgment, enforcement will be\nsuspended for 20 days after the appellate court's order. If the judgment debtor does not comply with the order within that period,\nthe judgment may be enforced. When any additional bond, deposit, or security has been filed, the trial court clerk must notify\nthe appellate court. The posting of additional security will not release the previously posted security or affect any alternative\nsecurity arrangements that the judgment debtor previously made unless specifically ordered by the appellate court.\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The continuation of\nthe business by the other partners or by those who habitually acted in the business before the request, other than the partner\nmaking the request, without any settlement or liquidation of the partnership business, is prima facie evidence of an agreement\nto continue the partnership under this subsection.\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Merriman, No. 04-13-00518-CV,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1004357</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. App.—San Antonio March 4, 2015, no pet. hist.),\n\nwhich involved a dispute over the Trust and its various properties. At the\n\ncenter of this lawsuit is a property in which the Trust owns an interest, a\n\ncommercial building located at 5321 Broadway, San Antonio, Texas, and\n\nits adjoining parking lot (the “Property”), more specifically described as\n\nfollows:\n\n           Lot Four (4), Block Thirty-Three (33), Alamo\n           Heights, City of Alamo Heights, Situated in Bexar\n           County, Texas, according to Plat thereof Recorded\n           in Volume 105, Pages 29-296, Deed and Plat\n           Records of Bexar County, Texas.\n\nCR2 134; Appendix, tab 18. The side of the Property facing Broadway is\n\noccupied by Starbucks, and the other side is occupied by Nix Health Care\n\nSystem. Coffeehouse and the Trust are joint owners of the Property, and\n\n\n\n\n                                    2\n\fare also joint owners of 5321 Broadway Partners (the “Partnership”), the\n\nentity which manages and holds equitable title to the Property.\n\n     Due to contentious litigation involving the Trust and the Saks Parties,\n\nand the Saks Parties’ absurd persistence in making claims against the\n\nProperty and Partnership, in spite of court orders rejecting their claims,\n\nCoffeehouse found it no longer practicable or desirable to be in business\n\nwith the Trust. Coffeehouse filed this suit on October 10, 2013, seeking\n\ndeclaratory judgment to invalidate the Saks Parties’ claims against the\n\nProperty and the Partnership, to partition the Property, and to wind up and\n\nterminate the Partnership. CR1 1. Coffeehouse filed its First Amended\n\nPetition on June 9, 2014. CR1 84; Appendix, tab 1.\n\n     On August 19, 2014, the Trial Court (the Honorable Larry Noll)\n\nentered a Partial Summary Judgment in this case declaring that\n\nCoffeehouse and the Trust own the Property and the Partnership; declaring\n\nthat the Saks Parties, as well as other parties, own no interest in the\n\nProperty or the Partnership; declaring that certain assignments and deeds\n\npertaining to the Property and the Partnership are void and of no force or\n\neffect; and ordering partition of the Property by sale, and the winding-up\n\nand termination of the Partnership. CR2 369; Appendix, tab 8.\n\n\n\n\n                                     3\n\f     On September 16, 2014, the Trust filed its Crossclaim in this case,\n\njoining in and asserting the same claims asserted by Coffeehouse against\n\nSandra and McFadin. CR2 373.\n\n     On October 20, 2014, the parties appeared for non-jury trial on the\n\nsole issue of attorney’s fees, and the Court entered a final Judgment,\n\nincorporating the previous Partial Summary Judgment.            CR2 437;\n\nAppendix, tab 9. The Trial Court (the Honorable Antonia Arteaga) awarded\n\nattorney’s fees to Coffeehouse and the Trust against the Saks Parties\n\njointly and severally.   CR2 437.   Immediately after the Judgment was\n\nentered on October 20, 2014, the Saks Parties filed their Notice of Appeal.\n\nCR2 434.\n\n     Prior to trial, on October 15, 2014, the Saks Parties had filed a\n\npremature Motion to Suspend and Supersede Judgment and to Set the\n\nAmount of Supersedeas Bond. CR2 397. The day following the trial, on\n\nOctober 21, 2014, the Saks Parties filed an Amended Motion to Suspend\n\nand Supersede Judgment and to Set the Amount of Supersedeas Bond.\n\nCR2 444. Coffeehouse responded on October 31, 2014, and a hearing\n\nwas held that same day. CR2 459. The Trial Court (the Honorable Antonia\n\nArteaga) entered an Order dated October 31, 2014, setting the amount of\n\nthe supersedeas bond at $170,237.76. CR2 457. On November 3, 2014,\n\n\n\n                                    4\n\fthe Saks Parties filed a Motion to Suspend the Judgment and to Review\n\nOrder Setting the Amount of Supersedeas Bond in this Court, which was\n\ndenied on November 7, 2014. Appendix, tabs 12 and 13. On November\n\n17, 2014, the Saks Parties filed a Motion to Reconsider En Banc Motion to\n\nSuspend the Judgment and to Review Order Setting the Amount of\n\nSupersedeas Bond, which this Court also denied on November 21, 2014.\n\nAppendix, tabs 14 and 15.\n\n                STATEMENT REGARDING ORAL ARGUMENT\n\n     Coffeehouse and the Trust request oral argument only if the Court\n\ngrants oral argument to the Saks Parties. The Saks Parties have filed a\n\ndisjointed and conclusory brief, which does not properly present the issues\n\nfor this Court’s review. The Saks Parties’ Issue Nos. 1(A) and 1(B) are\n\nunpreserved arguments that are unsupported by citations to the record or\n\nproper legal authority. Such arguments are not properly before this Court\n\nand have been waived. The Saks Parties’ Issue No. 3 is moot because it\n\nhas already been decided by this Court, the Saks Parties failed to seek\n\nfurther review in the Supreme Court, and this Court lacks further jurisdiction\n\nto consider it. The only issue that is arguably before this Court is the Saks\n\nParties’ Issue No. 2 regarding whether the Trial Court abused its discretion\n\n\n\n\n                                      5\n\fin awarding attorney’s fees. This issue is straightforward, and does not\n\nrequire oral argument.\n\n                                ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n     ISSUE NO. 1(a): Do the Saks Parties’ Issues Nos. 1(A) and\n                     (B) present anything for this Court’s\n                     review?\n\n     ISSUE NO. 1(b): Did the Saks Parties waive their arguments\n                     that (i) the summary judgment granting\n                     partition was in error because the\n                     Partnership      Agreement          prohibits\n                     withdrawal of capital; and (ii) the summary\n                     judgment winding up and terminating the\n                     Partnership was in error because there is\n                     no     agreement     to    terminate     the\n                     Partnership?\n\n     ISSUE NO. 1(c): Was it necessary for the Trial Court to\n                     make findings of fact to support its partial\n                     summary judgment ordering partition of\n                     the Property by sale?\n\n     ISSUE NO. 1(d): Are there genuine issues of material fact\n                     as to:\n\n                         i)      whether a fair and equitable division\n                                 of the Property cannot be made;\n\n                         ii)     whether    the    purpose    of   the\n                                 Partnership is frustrated;\n\n                         iii)    whether the Trust exists and has an\n                                 interest in the Property; and\n\n                         iv)     whether McFadin and Landen own\n                                 any interest in the Property or the\n                                 Partnership?\n\n                                        6\n\f     ISSUE NO. 2(a): Did the Trial Court abuse its discretion by\n                     awarding attorney’s fees to Coffeehouse\n                     and the Trust?\n\n     ISSUE NO. 2(b): Did the Saks Parties waive any issue\n                     regarding failure to segregate attorney’s\n                     fees?\n\n     ISSUE NO. 2(c): Did the Trial Court err in awarding the full\n                     amount of attorney’s fees requested by\n                     Coffeehouse and the Trust?\n\n     ISSUE NO. 3(a): Is the Saks Parties’ Issue No. 3 regarding\n                     the amount of the supersedeas bond moot\n                     because it has been waived, and does this\n                     Court therefore lack jurisdiction?\n\n     ISSUE NO. 3(b): Did the Trial Court abuse its discretion in\n                     setting the amount of the supersedeas\n                     bond?\n\n                         STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      Purchase of the Property and Formation of the Partnership\n\n     By Assumption Warranty Deed dated January 11, 1996, Guy\n\nChipman, Jr. sold the Property to the Trust. CR1 153. Several days later,\n\nby Warranty Deed dated January 16, 1996, the Trust conveyed an\n\nundivided twenty-five percent (25%) interest in and to the Property to Perry\n\nT. Donop, Jr. (“Donop”). CR1 157.\n\n     On January 16, 1996, Donop and the Trust also entered into a\n\nPartnership Agreement by which the Partnership was formed. CR1 163;\n\nAppendix, tab 3.    The stated purpose of the Partnership was to own,\n\n                                     7\n\foperate, and manage the Property. CR1 163. Record title to the Property\n\nremained jointly in the name of Donop (an undivided 25% interest) and the\n\nTrust (an undivided 75% interest).        Pursuant to Paragraph 5 of the\n\nPartnership Agreement, Donop and the TRUST transferred equitable title to\n\nthe Property to the Partnership. CR1 163-164; Appendix, tab 3.\n\n       By Special Warranty Deed dated August 22, 2012, Donop conveyed\n\nhis undivided 25% interest in and to the Property to Coffeehouse, of which\n\nDonop is Manager. CR1 170. On the same date, Donop executed an\n\nAssignment and Assumption of Partnership Interest, whereby he assigned\n\nall of his interest in the Partnership to Coffeehouse. CR1 169. Attached\n\nhereto as Appendix, tab 2, is a flow chart illustrating the Property’s chain of\n\ntitle. CR1 320.\n\n       On or about September 6, 2012, Coffeehouse and Saks Broadway,\n\nLLC (“Saks Broadway”) executed an unrecorded Agreement Confirming\n\nInterests in Partnership, which recited that the Trust had previously\n\ntransferred all of its right, title and interest in and to the Property and the\n\nPartnership to Saks Broadway. However, no such transfer or conveyance\n\nfrom the Trust to Saks Broadway was ever executed, and Saks Broadway\n\ndoes not own any interest in the Property or the Partnership. CR1 160-\n\n161.\n\n\n\n                                      8\n\f                 The Probate Suit Regarding the Trust\n\n     On or about August 17, 2011, Lauren Saks Merriman (“Merriman”)\n\nfiled suit against her mother, Sandra, and Diane Flores (“Flores”), Sandra’s\n\nsister, who was then Trustee of the Trust, in Cause No. 2011-PC-3466, in\n\nBexar County Probate Court (the “Probate Suit”). CR1 174; See Davis,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1004357</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; Appendix, tab 7.          In the Probate Suit, Merriman\n\nrequested an accounting of the Trust and to remove Flores as Trustee, due\n\nto Flores’ numerous breaches of fiduciary duty and mismanagement of\n\nTrust assets. CR1 174. On or about December 21, 2011, the day before a\n\nscheduled hearing to remove Flores as Trustee, Flores signed a document\n\nreciting that the Trust had been terminated.    CR1 323.     The next day,\n\nhowever, on December 22, 2011, the Probate Court removed Flores as\n\nTrustee and appointed Marcus Rogers as Interim Trustee of the Trust.\n\nCR1 183.\n\n                  The Mediated Settlement Agreement\n\n     The parties to the Probate Suit eventually mediated their claims, and\n\nentered into a Mediated Settlement Agreement (the “MSA”) effective April\n\n2, 2012.   CR1 188; Appendix, tab 4.        Because of Flores’ attempted\n\ntermination of the Trust and due to suspicions that Flores had fraudulently\n\nassigned interests in the Partnership to Sandra, the MSA included an\n\n\n\n                                     9\n\fagreement by Sandra and Flores to transfer and assign any and all of their\n\nright, title, and interest in and to the Partnership back to the Trust. Sandra,\n\nFlores, Merriman, Landen (who is Sandra’s other daughter), and the Trust\n\n(through its Interim Trustee, Marcus Rogers) all signed the MSA. CR1 188;\n\nAppendix, tab 4. The Probate Court approved the MSA on May 8, 2012.\n\nCR1 193.\n\n      Sandra, Landen, and Flores then failed to comply with the MSA.\n\nInstead, on or about August 15, 2012, Sandra filed of record two\n\ndocuments attached to an Affidavit: a document titled “Irrevocable\n\nAssignment of Partnership Interest,” dated January 6, 1996, signed by\n\nFlores, purporting to assign 99% of the Trust’s right, title and interest in the\n\nPartnership to Sandra (the “1996 Assignment”); and another document\n\ntitled “Assignment of Interest in 5321 Broadway Partners,” dated December\n\n21, 2011, also signed by Flores, purporting to terminate the Trust and\n\nassign its 75% interest in the Partnership to Merriman and Landen (the\n\n“2011 Assignment”). CR1 321. These invalid documents were filed after\n\nthe Probate Court had removed and replaced Flores as trustee of the Trust,\n\nand served no purpose except to thwart the MSA.\n\n\n\n\n                                      10\n\f                          The Arbitration Award\n\n     As of September 5, 2012, Sandra, Landen and Flores still had not\n\ncomplied with the MSA. The Probate Court then ordered Sandra, Landen,\n\nMerriman, and the Trust to mediate and arbitrate any disputes over the\n\nMSA, as required under the terms of the MSA. CR1 195. This second\n\nmediation was unsuccessful, so the matter was arbitrated by the mediator,\n\nThomas J. Smith. On October 24, 2012, Mr. Smith, as Arbitrator, entered\n\nFindings and a Final Award (the “Arbitration Award”). CR1 200; Appendix,\n\ntab 5.   The Arbitrator found that the properties described in the MSA,\n\nincluding the interest in the Partnership, were Trust property.          The\n\nArbitrator also held that Sandra’s, Landen’s, and any other party’s failures\n\nto comply with the MSA’s requirement to transfer their right, title and\n\ninterest in the Trust property were not made in good faith or for just cause.\n\nThe Arbitrator ordered Sandra, Landen and any other party to the MSA to\n\nexecute the required documents necessary to effectuate the transfer,\n\npurpose, and intent of the MSA, which documents were attached to and\n\nincorporated by reference in the Arbitration Award. On May 7, 2013, the\n\nProbate Court confirmed the Arbitration Award, and entered it as a\n\njudgment of the Court. CR1 198.\n\n\n\n\n                                     11\n\f     Sixteen days after the Probate Court had entered the Arbitration\n\nAward as a judgment of the Court, on or about May 23, 2013, Sandra filed\n\nof record two more documents: a Deed dated April 21, 2012, by which she\n\npurported to convey all of her right, title, and interest in the Property to\n\nMcFadin (the “McFadin Deed”); and a document titled “Transfer\n\nConveyance Assignment of Interest in the 5321 Broadway Partners\n\nAgreement,” by which she purported to assign all of her right, title and\n\ninterest in the Partnership to McFadin (the “McFadin Assignment”)\n\n(collectively, with the 1996 Assignment and the 2011 Assignment, the\n\n“Assignments”).    CR1 333-343.        At the time the above-described\n\ninstruments were executed and filed of record, Sandra had no interest in\n\nthe Property or the Partnership, but in any event, the McFadin Deed and\n\nMcFadin Assignment were void and ineffective to transfer any interest in\n\nthe Property or the Partnership because McFadin acquired any such\n\ninterest subject to the Probate Suit, the MSA, and the final determination in\n\nthe Arbitration Award.\n\n                  Enforcement of the Arbitration Award\n\n     Despite being ordered by the Arbitrator and the Probate Court to\n\nexecute the documents necessary to transfer any right, title, and interest in\n\nthe Property and the Partnership to the Trust, Sandra and Landen still\n\n\n\n                                     12\n\fcontinued to refuse to sign such conveyances. On September 17, 2013,\n\nthe Probate Court entered an Order Granting Motion to Enforce, ordering\n\nSandra and Landen to execute the required documents, including a\n\nConveyance Agreement and Deed (the “Arbitration Deed”) relating to the\n\nProperty, and a Conveyance Agreement and Assignment (the “Arbitration\n\nAssignment”) relating to the Partnership. CR1 278. When Sandra and\n\nLanden still refused to comply, the Court entered an Order in Aid of\n\nEnforcement of Judgment on November 14, 2013, which deemed by\n\noperation of law that Sandra and Landen had executed the Arbitration\n\nDeed and Arbitration Assignment transferring all right, title, and interest in\n\nthe Property and the Partnership to the Trust, as well as the other required\n\ndocuments. CR1 281; Appendix, tab 6. This Order confirmed, once and\n\nfor all, title to a 75% undivided interest in the Trust, with the remaining 25%\n\nundivided interest in Coffeehouse.\n\n           Appeal of the Judgment on the Arbitration Award\n\n      On August 2, 2013, Sandra and Landen appealed the Arbitration\n\nAward and the Order entering the Arbitration Award as a Judgment. On\n\nDecember 12, 2013, Sandra, Landen, and McFadin appealed the\n\nNovember 14, 2013 Order in Aid of Enforcement of Judgment. This Court\n\nconsolidated the appeals and issued a Memorandum Opinion on March 4,\n\n\n\n                                      13\n\f2015, affirming the judgment confirming the Arbitration Award and\n\ndismissing the appeal from the Order in Aid of Enforcement of Judgment\n\nfor lack of jurisdiction.

Appendix, tab 7.\n\n                     SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n     The Saks Parties failed to adequately brief their Issues Nos. 1(A) and\n\n1(B); therefore, they have presented nothing for this Court’s review and\n\nhave waived their complaints on these issues.\n\n     The Saks Parties also failed to raise Issues Nos. 1(A) and 1(B) in\n\ntheir Responses to Coffeehouse’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n\nand Amended Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, and are presenting\n\nthese complaints for the first time on appeal. Thus, the Saks Parties have\n\nwaived these issues.\n\n     It was not necessary for the Trial Court to make findings of fact to\n\nsupport its Order partitioning the Property by sale. Even if the Saks Parties\n\nhad requested findings of fact, it would have been improper for the Trial\n\nCourt to make them. Furthermore, the Trial Court did determine the shares\n\nof the joint owners in the Property in its Order Granting Partial Summary\n\nJudgment.\n\n     Even if the Saks Parties had not waived Issues Nos. 1(A) and 1(B),\n\nthe Trial Court’s Order Granting Partial Summary Judgment should be\n\n\n\n                                     14\n\faffirmed because there are no genuine issues of material fact that (i) a fair\n\nand equitable division of the Property cannot be made; (ii) the purpose of\n\nthe Partnership is frustrated; (iii) the Trust exists and owns an interest in\n\nthe Property; and (iv) McFadin and Landen own no interest in the Property\n\nor the Partnership.\n\n     The Trial Court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney’s\n\nfees to Coffeehouse and the Trust because they properly pleaded for\n\ndeclaratory relief under Section 37.001 et seq. of the Texas Civil Practice &\n\nRemedies Code (the “UDJA”), which relief was not duplicative of the other\n\nrelief they sought, and the Trial Court was statutorily authorized to make\n\nthe fee awards.\n\n     The Saks Parties have waived their argument regarding segregation\n\nof attorney’s fees because they failed to file a Motion for New Trial or\n\notherwise object in the Trial Court. Even if the issue had not been waived,\n\nthe evidence shows that the attorney’s fees of Coffeehouse and the Trust\n\ncould not be segregated; therefore, the Trial Court’s award should be\n\naffirmed.\n\n     The Saks Parties have already asked this Court to review the Order\n\nsetting the amount of supersedeas bond. This Court refused to overturn or\n\nmodify the Order, and the Saks Parties failed to file a petition for writ of\n\n\n\n                                     15\n\fmandamus to the Supreme Court of Texas to further challenge the Order.\n\nTherefore, the Saks Parties’ Issue No. 3 is moot and has been waived.\n\nThis Court also lacks jurisdiction to consider this issue. Even if it were\n\npossible for the Saks Parties to further appeal the Order setting the amount\n\nof supersedeas bond, their Notice of Appeal for this Order was untimely.\n\nFinally, even if the Saks Parties’ Issue No. 3 were properly before this\n\nCourt, the Trial Court did not abuse its discretion in setting the amount of\n\nsupersedeas bond, and its Order should be affirmed.\n\n                    ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\n\n     This Court is already familiar with many of this case’s underlying facts\n\nand arguments because this case arises out of the ongoing dispute\n\nbetween the Trust and the Saks Parties. See Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1004357</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\nAppendix, tab 7.    Because of this dispute and the unreasonable and\n\nunpredictable behavior of the Saks Parties, Coffeehouse’s abilities to deal\n\nwith the Trust and to effectively manage the Property have been frustrated,\n\nand it is no longer practical for Coffeehouse to be in business with the\n\nTrust. Due the fraudulent instruments filed of record by the Saks Parties,\n\nCoffeehouse had no choice but to file this action seeking to cancel the\n\ninvalid instruments and quiet the Saks Parties’ claims, so that the Property\n\ncould be sold and the Partnership terminated.\n\n\n\n                                    16\n\f            ISSUE NO. 1(a): Do the Saks Parties’ Issues Nos. 1(A)\n                            and (B) present anything for this\n                            Court’s review?\n\n      In Davis, this Court held that in attempting to raise several issues,\n\nSandra and Landen failed to properly brief their arguments under Texas\n\nRule of Appellate Procedure 38.1(i). </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1004357</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *5.

The Saks Parties’ briefing of their Issue No. 1(B) does not include\n\na single citation to either the record or supporting legal authority.

Therefore, the Saks Parties have\n\npresented nothing for this Court to review on their Issues Nos. 1(A) and (B),\n\nand the Court should find that the Saks Parties have waived these\n\ncomplaints.\n\n     ISSUE NO. 1(b): Did the Saks Parties waive their arguments\n                     that (i) the summary judgment granting\n                     partition was in error because the\n                     Partnership      Agreement          prohibits\n                     withdrawal of capital; and (ii) the summary\n                     judgment winding up and terminating the\n                     Partnership was in error because there is\n                     no     agreement     to    terminate     the\n                     Partnership?\n\n     The Saks Parties attempt to argue that the Partnership Agreement\n\nprohibits the withdrawal of capital, and, therefore, Coffeehouse lacked\n\nstanding to request partition of the Property. The Saks Parties also try to\n\nclaim that the winding-up and termination of the Partnership is in error\n\nbecause there is no agreement to terminate the Partnership. The Saks\n\nParties failed to present these arguments to the Trial Court in their\n\nResponses to Coffeehouse’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and\n\n\n\n                                     19\n\fAmended Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, and are raising them for\n\nthe first time in this appeal.

First, the Saks Parties did not request any\n\n                                     20\n\ffindings of fact, but even if they had, it would have been improper for the\n\nTrial Court to make findings of fact. “Findings of fact and conclusions of\n\nlaw have no place in a summary judgment proceeding.”            IKB Indus.\n\n(Nigeria) Ltd. v.

The\n\nreason for this is that for summary judgment to be rendered, there must be\n\nno genuine issue as to any material fact, and the legal grounds must be set\n\nforth in the motion and response.

Id. “The trial\n\ncourt should not make, and an appellate court cannot consider, findings of\n\nfact in connection with a summary judgment.” Id. Therefore, it was not\n\nnecessary for the Trial Court to make any findings of fact with regard to\n\npartition of the Property.\n\n      Furthermore, the Trial Court did determine, in its Judgment, the share\n\nof each of the joint owners of the Property.

Id.\n\n     Coffeehouse’s summary judgment evidence shows that a partition in\n\nkind of the Property would not be fair and equitable.            Attached to\n\nCoffeehouse’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is the Affidavit of\n\nPerry Donop, Jr. (“Donop Affidavit I”), in which Donop describes the\n\nProperty as a commercial building and adjacent parking lot, leased to retail\n\nand office tenants.     CR1 161.    The Property is a single platted lot.\n\nAppendix, tab 18.     Donop explains that there is no way to divide the\n\nbuilding or the land in a way that would not materially impair its value. CR1\n\n\n\n                                     24\n\f161. Finally, Donop explains that the Property’s value is dependent on the\n\ncommercial improvements and its operation as a commercial retail and\n\noffice building, and neither the improvements nor the land underneath the\n\nimprovements can be partitioned in kind. CR1 161.\n\n     The Saks Parties fail to point to any specific evidence in the summary\n\njudgment record that would controvert the Donop Affidavit I. It is the Saks\n\nParties’ burden to discuss their assertions of error and properly cite to\n\nsupporting evidence in the record. Valadez v. Avitia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2361997\"><a href=\"/opinion/2361997/valadez-v-avitia/\"><span class=\"volume\">238</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">843</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 845\n\n(Tex. App.—El Paso 2007, no pet.). An appellate court has no duty or right\n\nto perform an independent review of the record, which would improperly\n\ntransform the court from neutral adjudicators to advocate for that party. Id.\n\nBecause it is not this Court’s duty to independently review the voluminous\n\nsummary judgment record, the Saks Parties were required to identify any\n\nsupporting evidence with proper citations to the summary judgment record,\n\nand by failing to do so, they have presented nothing for review. See Id.\n\n     The only evidence cited by the Saks Parties in support of this issue is\n\nfrom the November 14, 2014, Reporter’s Record of the hearing on\n\nAppellants’ Amended Motion to Set Supersedeas Bond.            As explained\n\nabove, the November 14, 2014, Reporter’s Record is not part of the\n\nsummary judgment record because it pertains to a separate proceeding\n\n\n\n                                     25\n\fheld on October 31, 2014, regarding the amount of the supersedeas bond,\n\nand was made well after the Court entered its Order granting Partial\n\nSummary Judgment on August 19, 2014. See Chappell, 414 S.W.3d at\n\n321; H.S.M. Acquisitions, 917 S.W.2d at 878. Because the testimony and\n\nevidence presented during the hearing regarding the supersedeas bond is\n\noutside the summary judgment record, it is not within the scope of this\n\nCourt’s summary judgment review, and should be disregarded.\n\n     The evidence presented by Coffeehouse satisfies its burden to show\n\nthat there is no genuine issue of material fact that a fair and equitable\n\ndivision of the Property cannot be made. CR1 161. The Saks Parties\n\nfailed to identify or cite to any summary judgment evidence that would raise\n\na fact question on this issue. See Chappell, 414 S.W.3d at 321 (Appellate\n\ncourt would not consider voluminous summary judgment record or matters\n\npresented at subsequent trial, but would limit scope of review to portions of\n\nsummary judgment record to which proper citations were made).\n\nTherefore, the Order Granting Partial Summary Judgment and subsequent\n\nfinal Judgment ordering partition of the Property by sale should be affirmed.\n\n     ii.   There is no genuine issue of material fact that the\n           purpose of the Partnership is frustrated.\n\n     The Trial Court’s Order Granting Partial Summary Judgment and final\n\nJudgment also order that the Partnership be wound-up and terminated.\n\n                                     26\n\fCR2 371, 439.       Under Section 11.314(1)(A) of the Texas Business\n\nOrganizations Code, a district court has jurisdiction to order the winding up\n\nand termination of a domestic partnership if the court determines that the\n\neconomic purpose of the partnership is likely to be unreasonably frustrated.\n\nAppendix, tab 19.     Coffeehouse requested partial summary judgment\n\nordering the winding-up and termination of the Partnership on this basis,\n\nsupported by the Donop Affidavit I, in which Mr. Donop stated that the\n\neconomic purpose of the Partnership was frustrated by the ongoing Trust\n\ndispute, the accusations of Flores’ mismanagement of the Trust, the\n\nlitigiousness of the Saks Parties, and their refusal to comply with court\n\norders and recognize the validity of the Trust. CR1 148-150, 161-162, 186-\n\n194, 198-199, 205-206, 245-261, 281-282, 321-324, 330-343; CR2 121-\n\n123.\n\n       The Saks Parties do not point to any summary judgment evidence to\n\nrefute the Donop Affidavit I or the other evidence, do not make a single\n\ncitation to the record on this issue, and provide no legal authority for their\n\nargument. Rather, the Saks Parties make conclusory and unsupported\n\nstatements that “the economic purpose of the Partnership is not frustrated\n\nby any dispute between the ATFL&L and any other parties because\n\nATFL&L is no longer an owner of any interest in the Property,” and “there\n\n\n\n                                     27\n\fare genuine issues of material fact . . . [as to] (4) whether the purpose of\n\nthe Partnership is frustrated.” Appellants Brief, at 19-20. The requirement\n\nthat an appellant’s brief contain a clear and concise argument, including\n\nappropriate citation to authority and to the record, is not satisfied by merely\n\nuttering brief conclusory statements unsupported by legal citations.\n\nValadez, 238 S.W.3d at 845. Because the Saks Parties have raised no\n\ngenuine issue of material fact, the Order Granting Partial Summary\n\nJudgment and final Judgment ordering winding-up and termination of the\n\nPartnership should be affirmed.\n\n      Furthermore, Coffeehouse asserted three other bases for winding-up\n\nand terminating the Partnership. Under Section 11.314(1)(B) of the Texas\n\nBusiness Organizations Code, a district court has jurisdiction to order the\n\nwinding up and termination of a domestic partnership if the court\n\ndetermines that another partner has engaged in conduct relating to the\n\npartnership’s business that makes it not reasonably practicable to carry on\n\nthe business in partnership with that partner.            Appendix, tab 19.\n\nCoffeehouse presented summary judgment evidence that this condition\n\nexisted so that winding-up and termination of the Partnership was\n\nnecessary.    The Donop Affidavit I sets forth testimony explaining that\n\nbecause of the conflicts surrounding the Trust and the Saks Parties’\n\n\n\n                                      28\n\fassertion of invalid and fraudulent claims to the Property and the\n\nPartnership, as well as their absolute refusal to recognize the existence of\n\nthe Trust or comply with the Orders of the Probate Court, it is not\n\nreasonably practicable to carry on the business with the Trust. CR1 161-\n\n162, 186-194, 198-199, 205-206, 245-261, 281-282, 321-324, 330-343.\n\n     Furthermore, pursuant to Sections 11.051(4) and 11.057(c) of the\n\nTexas Business Organizations Code, an event requiring the winding up of a\n\ndomestic general partnership includes:\n\n     (1)   in a general partnership for a particular undertaking,\n\n           the completion of the undertaking, unless otherwise\n\n           provided by the partnership agreement; [and]\n\n                                    ...\n\n     (3)   the sale of all or substantially all of the property of\n\n           the general partnership outside the ordinary course\n\n           of business, unless otherwise provided by the\n\n           partnership agreement.\n\nTEX. BUS. ORG. CODE § 11.057(c); Appendix, tab 19. Coffeehouse showed\n\nthe Trial Court that winding-up and termination of the Partnership was\n\nrequired due to such events. Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, the\n\npurpose of the Partnership was to own, operate, and manage the Property,\n\n\n\n                                     29\n\fwhich constituted all of the property of the Partnership. CR1 160, 163-164.\n\nBecause Coffeehouse (1) owns an interest in the property and (2) has a\n\nright to present possession as a cotenant, it is entitled to partition the\n\nProperty as a matter of law. CR1 159-160, 157-158, 170-172. See Savell\n\nv.

Coffeehouse established that partition by sale is\n\nnecessary because a fair and equitable division of the Property cannot be\n\nmade, and the Trial Court ordered partition of the Property by sale. CR1\n\n161, CR2 371, 439.       Such a sale would constitute an event requiring\n\nwinding up the Partnership because it would: (1) complete the particular\n\nundertaking for which the Partnership was formed; and (2) constitute a sale\n\nof all of the property of the Partnership. As such, the winding up of the\n\nPartnership is required under Sections 11.051(4) and 11.057(c) of the\n\nTexas Business Organizations Code.\n\n      In their Brief, the Saks Parties have raised no issue regarding these\n\nother grounds for winding up and terminating the Partnership. The Trial\n\nCourt did not specify the grounds for ordering the winding up and\n\ntermination of the Partnership; therefore, the summary judgment must be\n\n\n\n                                      30\n\faffirmed if any of the theories presented to the Trial Court and preserved\n\nfor appellate review are meritorious. Provident, 128 S.W.3d at 217. Even if\n\nthere had been a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the\n\npurpose of the Partnership was frustrated, Coffeehouse has established\n\nthe other three bases for winding-up and termination of the Partnership as\n\na matter of law, and the Saks Parties have not disputed these grounds.\n\nTherefore, the Trial Court’s ordering the winding-up and termination of the\n\nPartnership should be affirmed.\n\n     iii.   There is no genuine issue of material fact that the Trust\n            exists and has an interest in the Property and the\n            Partnership.\n\n     The Saks Parties present no specific issue on their contentions that\n\nthe Trust was terminated and that they own interests in the Property. They\n\ndo say as an unsupported conclusion buried in the body of their confusing\n\nBrief that there are questions of fact on these issues. But these are not\n\nissues they include in their statement of the issues in this appeal (see\n\nAppellants’ Brief, at 3), and they entirely fail to present or support those\n\nunsupported conclusions with proper clarity or argument. The Saks Parties\n\nalso fail to mention that these precise issues are now conclusively decided\n\nagainst them by this Court’s opinion in Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1004357</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. The\n\nCourt should simply disregard what the Saks Parties say about the Trust\n\n\n\n                                    31\n\fbeing terminated or their supposed ownership, because these statements\n\ndo not support or relate to the issues they have identified in their statement\n\nof the issues and because these issues have already been decided in favor\n\nof the Trust and against the Saks Parties.\n\n      If this Court does entertain these issues, it should quickly reject the\n\noutrageous position that the Trust was terminated and owns no interest in\n\nthe Property or the Partnership, despite the Probate Court’s appointment of\n\nan interim trustee, the Arbitration Award carrying out the MSA and stating\n\nthat the Property and Partnership are Trust property, the Probate Court’s\n\nOrders enforcing the Arbitration Award, and Trial Court’s Order Granting\n\nPartial Summary Judgment in this case declaring that the Trust owns 75%\n\nof the Property and the Partnership. CR1 188, 193, 198, 200, 205, 278,\n\n281; CR2 370; Appendix, tabs 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9.          Furthermore, in the\n\nMemorandum Opinion issued in Davis, this Court affirmed the Probate\n\nCourt’s judgment confirming the Arbitration Award, finding that, based on\n\nthe MSA and the Arbitration Award which are premised on the notion that\n\nthe Trust is in existence, the Trust was never terminated. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1004357</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *3. Appendix, tab 7.\n\n      Additionally, the Saks Parties point to no competent summary\n\njudgment evidence that the Trust no longer owns its 75% interest in the\n\n\n\n                                     32\n\fProperty and the Partnership. CR1 157, 163. The only evidence referred\n\nto by the Saks Parties is an Affidavit of Diana Flores, dated July 1, 2014,\n\nwhich they claim shows that Flores had absolute authority to execute the\n\n1996 Assignment and the 2011 Assignment, by which Flores purported to\n\nterminate the Trust. The Saks Parties fail to indicate the page in the record\n\nwhere such Affidavit can be found, but it appears that Appellants are\n\nreferring to the Affidavit attached to Flores’ Response to Coffeehouse’s\n\nMotion for Partial Summary Judgment. CR2 78-79. It should be noted that\n\nFlores withdrew her opposition to Coffeehouse’s Motion for Partial\n\nSummary Judgment prior to the hearing, when she entered into a Rule 11\n\nAgreement agreeing to disclaim and quitclaim any interest in the Property\n\nand the Partnership. CR2 365.\n\n     First, Flores’ statements in the Affidavit that she terminated the Trust\n\non December 21, 2011, and that she had authority to execute the above-\n\nmentioned Assignments by which she allegedly distributed the Trust’s 75%\n\ninterest in the Property and the Partnership, constitute legal conclusions.\n\nCoffeehouse objected to Flores’ Affidavit on these bases in the Trial Court,\n\nbut the Trial Court did not rule on those objections. CR2 357. Because an\n\nobjection that an affidavit states a legal conclusion is an objection based on\n\na substantive defect, the objection may be raised on appeal even if it was\n\n\n\n                                     33\n\fnever ruled on, or even raised, in the trial court.

App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1997, no writ). Because\n\nthe statements in Flores’ Affidavit relied on by the Saks Parties are legal\n\nconclusions, they are improper summary judgment evidence and should be\n\ndisregarded. Additionally, the Assignments referred to by Flores in her\n\nAffidavit were invalidated by the MSA, the Arbitration Award, and the\n\nProbate Court Orders enforcing the Arbitration Award, by which Sandra,\n\nLanden, and Merriman conveyed any interest they may have had in the\n\nProperty and the Partnership to the Trust.\n\n         Because the Saks Parties have presented no evidence creating a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact as to whether the Trust exists and owns an\n\ninterest in the Property and the Partnership, summary judgment on this\n\nissue must be affirmed.\n\n         iv.     There is no genuine issue of material fact that McFadin and\n                 Landen own no interest in the Property or the Partnership.\n\n         Landen does not own any interest in the Property or the Partnership\n\nbecause the Trust was not terminated, and she was deemed to have\n\nconveyed any interest she had in the Property and the Partnership to the\n\nTrust.         CR1 281; Appendix, tab 6.     McFadin owns no interest in the\n\nProperty or the Partnership because he purports to have obtained his\n\ninterest from Sandra, who never owned any interest in the Property, and\n\n                                        34\n\fwho also was deemed to have conveyed any interest she may have had in\n\nthe Property and Partnership back to the Trust. CR1 281; Appendix, tab 6.\n\n      Coffeehouse presented summary judgment evidence that pursuant to\n\nthe MSA, Sandra and Flores agreed to transfer and assign to the Trust all\n\nof their right, title, and interest in and to the Property and the Partnership,\n\nand the Probate Court approved the MSA. CR1 189. When the MSA was\n\narbitrated, the arbitrator found:\n\n      4)    Pursuant to order of the court, Marcus Rogers is the\n\n            Interim Trustee of the Trust.\n\n                                      ...\n\n      6)    Sandra C.

The properties so identified are Trust\n\n            property.    ¶5 of the MSA provides the Parties would\n\n            cooperate with one another in the execution of the\n\n            necessary documents to effect the transfer of the\n\n\n\n                                       35\n\f            properties and interests identified in ¶3.b. to the Trust.\n\n            The documents attached hereto as Exhibits 1 – 10 are in\n\n            proper form and necessary to accomplish the transfer of\n\n            the properties to the Trust as contemplated in the MSA.\n\n                                      ...\n\n      22)   The refusal of Sandra C.

Each\n\n            such party failing to cooperate shall be compelled to\n\n            cooperate in order to effect the transfer, purposes and\n\n            intents of the MSA.\n\nCR1 201, 205-206; Appendix, tab 5.          Because this Court has already\n\naffirmed the judgment confirming the Arbitration Award, the Saks Parties\n\nhave already litigated and lost on this issue.\n\n      Moreover, the documents by which Landen and Sandra were\n\ndeemed to have conveyed any Property and Partnership interests they may\n\nhave had to the Trust, and which were incorporated into the Arbitration\n\nAward as a judgment of the Probate Court, specifically state that the 1996\n\n\n\n                                      36\n\fAssignment and 2011 Assignment are now “canceled or void and of no\n\nfurther force or effect.” CR1 256; Appendix, tab 5. Because Sandra had\n\nnothing to convey or assign to McFadin, the McFadin Assignment and the\n\nMcFadin Deed are void and ineffective.\n\n      The Saks Parties point to no competent summary judgment evidence\n\nthat would show that Landen or Sandra retained any interest in the\n\nProperty or the Partnership, or that Sandra had any interest to convey to\n\nMcFadin. The Saks Parties also fail to argue or offer any evidence that the\n\npurported conveyance and assignment to McFadin were not invalidated by\n\nthe Probate Suit, the MSA, and the final determination in the Arbitration\n\nAward. Because the Saks Parties have raised no genuine issue of material\n\nfact on this issue, the summary judgment declaring that neither Landen nor\n\nMcFadin own any interest in the Property or the Partnership must be\n\naffirmed.\n\n      ISSUE NO. 2(a): Did the Trial Court abuse its discretion by\n                      awarding attorney’s fees to Coffeehouse\n                      and the Trust?\n\n      Due to the Saks Parties’ absurd persistence in their claims against\n\nthe Trust and its properties, and their unceasing litigation in the face of\n\nconclusive court rulings, it was necessary for Coffeehouse and the Trust to\n\nrequest declaratory relief to invalidate the fraudulently filed instruments and\n\n\n\n                                      37\n\frestore marketable title to the Property before partition of the Property or\n\nwinding-up of the Partnership could be accomplished. Coffeehouse asked\n\nthe Court to declare under the UDJA that Saks Broadway owns no interest\n\nin the Property or the Partnership, that the Assignments and Deed\n\nfraudulently filed by Sandra Saks are null and void, that Coffeehouse and\n\nthe Trust are the only two partners of the Partnership, that the Partnership\n\nowns equitable title to the Property, and that Coffeehouse and the Trust\n\nown 25% and 75% of the Property respectively. CR1 91.\n\n     The Saks Parties have fought Coffeehouse and the Trust every step\n\nof the way, completely disregarding the Orders of the Probate Court, as\n\nwell as the agreement and absolute right of Coffeehouse and the Trust to\n\npartition the Property and wind up the Partnership.           As a result,\n\nCoffeehouse and the Trust also sought to recover their reasonable and\n\nnecessary attorney’s fees under Section 37.009 of the UDJA. CR1 93;\n\nAppendix, tab 1.     The Trial Court granted Coffeehouse’s requested\n\ndeclaratory relief in its Order Granting Partial Summary Judgment and\n\nincorporated such relief into the final Judgment, which also awarded\n\nattorney’s fees to Coffeehouse and the Trust.

This case is distinguishable because the request for declaratory\n\njudgment in Morton was a defensive counterclaim that mirrored the\n\nplaintiff’s trademark infringement claim. The appellate court held that the\n\ndeclaratory judgment counterclaim was not an independent claim for\n\naffirmative relief because it did not seek relief beyond what the defendant\n\n\n\n                                      42\n\fwould be entitled to upon disposition of the plaintiff’s claims, and did not\n\nsurvive the plaintiff’s nonsuit.   Thus, the defendant was not entitled to\n\nattorney’s fees under the UDJA. In this case, Coffeehouse and the Trust\n\ndid specifically plead for affirmative declaratory judgment relief as an\n\nindependent claim, separate and apart from the request for partition and\n\nwinding-up of the Partnership, which relief was granted by the Trial Court’s\n\nOrder Granting Partial Summary Judgment and incorporated into the final\n\nJudgment.

However, it was necessary for Appellees to\n\ninclude a request for declaratory relief due to the Saks Parties’ vexatious\n\ninsistence that they own interests in the Property and the Partnership\n\ndespite the MSA, Arbitration Award, and Probate Court Orders providing\n\notherwise.

The Saks Parties, however, have artfully left out an\n\nimportant part of the court’s holding in I-10 Colony, which actually provides:\n\n            Given the mandatory language in Property Code\n\n            section 22.001 (“[a] trespass to try title action is the\n\n            method of determining title”) (emphasis added), a\n\n            party may not artfully plead a title dispute as a\n\n            declaratory judgment action just to obtain attorney’s\n\n            fees when that claim should have been brought as a\n\n            trespass-to-try-title action.\n\nA trespass-to-try-title lawsuit is an action to recover possession of land\n\nwithheld from an owner with a right to immediate possession, and imposes\n\nunique pleading and proof requirements. I-10 Colony, 393 S.W.3d at 475;\n\nFlorey, 212 S.W.3d at 449. Not all actions impacting title and possessory\n\nrights to property are necessarily trespass-to-try-title actions, and it is\n\ndoubtful “that the legislature intended for the trespass-to-try title statute to\n\ndisplace or subsume every statutory or common law claim (e.g. suits to\n\n\n\n\n                                       45\n\frescind deeds) having such an impact.” Id.

App.—Tyler 1992, writ denied), in support of their argument that it is\n\nimproper to use the UDJA to settle a land title dispute and seek an award\n\nof attorney’s fees.      However, in Barfield, there was no question of\n\n“construction” or “validity” of the deeds by which the parties acquired their\n\ntitle, and, therefore, it was not the proper subject matter for a declaratory\n\njudgment. As in the I-10 Colony case, the court in Barfield found that the\n\nsuit was an action for trespass-to-try-title. Barfield, 844 S.W.2d at 771.\n\nAlso, in that case, there was no question of the ownership of a related\n\npartnership and the validity of assignments of interests in such partnership,\n\nas there is in this case.\n\n      This case is not a trespass-to-try-title action, and the Saks Parties do\n\nnot argue that it should have properly been brought as one. There is no\n\ndispute between Coffeehouse and the Trust as to their ownership interests\n\nin the Property or the Partnership, or who is entitled to possession. This is\n\na unique case in which it was necessary to invalidate instruments\n\nfraudulently filed by Sandra, and confirm that the Trust still exists as an\n\nowner of the Property and the Partnership, so that the Property could be\n\n\n\n                                         46\n\fsold and the Partnership could be terminated. Furthermore, much of the\n\nrequested declaratory relief has to do with voiding the Assignments of\n\nPartnership interests, and declaring the interests of its partners, which\n\nwould not be the subject of a trespass-to-try-title or any other real property\n\ntitle claim.    Therefore, the requests to invalidate the fraudulently filed\n\nAssignments and the McFadin Deed, and confirm ownership in the\n\nProperty and the Partnership as a result of such determination, were\n\nproperly asserted under the UDJA.            Therefore, the Trial Court was\n\nstatutorily authorized to award attorney’s fees to Coffeehouse and the\n\nTrust.\n\n         The Saks Parties further claim that the Judgments in this case did not\n\ninclude any substantial relief that was not recoverable under the causes of\n\naction for partition of the Property and winding-up of the Partnership, but\n\nthe cases cited by the Saks Parties are not on point.

App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2006, no pet.), is\n\na breach of contract case, in which both the plaintiff and defendant also\n\npleaded for declaratory judgment. The court held that the plaintiffs were\n\nnot entitled to attorney’s fees under the UDJA because they did not recover\n\nany actual damages, and they could not use declaratory relief, identical to\n\nthe breach of contract claim, to recover attorney’s fees not otherwise\n\navailable. Id. at 489-90. Similarly, the court held that, upon reversal of the\n\njudgment in favor of plaintiffs, the defendant was not entitled to attorney’s\n\nfees under the UDJA because its claim for declaratory relief was nothing\n\nmore than a suit in avoidance of a contract, and it did not recover any\n\nactual damages either. Id. at 490-91. These cases are not applicable or\n\ndeterminative of this case.\n\n      It is clear that the declaratory relief requested by Coffeehouse and\n\nthe Trust is not redundant of the other claims. In addition to asking the\n\nTrial Court to partition the Property by sale and to wind-up and terminate\n\nthe Partnership, Appellees also asked the Court to void the invalid\n\ninstruments and thus declare that Appellants and other parties owned no\n\ninterest in the Property or the Partnership. This relief is necessary and\n\nrelated to, but not duplicative of, the request for partition of the Property\n\n\n\n                                     48\n\fand winding-up and termination of the Partnership. The relief requested in\n\nthis case is similar to that requested in the Roberts and the Wheeler cases,\n\nwhich were suits for partition and declaratory relief in which the appellate\n\ncourts affirmed attorney’s fees awarded under the UDJA.\n\n      In Roberts, the plaintiff sought partition of real and personal property\n\nand a declaratory judgment relating to property inherited by her spouse,\n\nasking the Court to construe the wills and partition deed by which her\n\nspouse obtained his interest in the property in order to resolve the dispute\n\nabout her ownership of these interests. 394 S.W.3d at 49. On summary\n\njudgment, the trial court granted the plaintiff’s request for declaratory relief\n\nand ruled that she was entitled to attorney’s fees. Id. at 48-49. Partition of\n\nthe property was then ordered after a bench trial. Id. at 49. On appeal, the\n\ndefendants argued that the plaintiff failed to establish statutory authority for\n\na claim for attorney’s fees, but the court of appeals held that because the\n\nplaintiff sought declaratory judgment pursuant to the UDJA, the trial court\n\nwas statutorily authorized to award reasonable and necessary attorney’s\n\nfees, in its discretion. Id. at 55.\n\n      At issue in the Wheeler case was real property originally owned by\n\nBen Jones that was bequeathed to his four children, and then passed down\n\nto the children’s heirs.    </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4011455</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *1.       Through a series of\n\n\n\n                                      49\n\fpurchases, Wheeler obtained a large fractional undivided interest in the\n\nproperty from the heirs of Ben Jones’ children. Id. Two of the Jones heirs\n\nfiled suit against Wheeler and other known and unknown Jones heirs for\n\npartition of the property and to declare ownership interests, also seeking to\n\nrecover the attorney’s fees incurred for the common benefit of the joint\n\nowners.

Id. at *9-10.\n\n      Coffeehouse     appropriately   pleaded   for   declaratory   relief   as\n\nauthorized under the UDJA, which relief was not redundant of its request\n\nfor partition of the Property and winding-up and termination of the\n\nPartnership.

In the Trial\n\nCourt, Coffeehouse’s designated expert on attorney’s fees, attorney Paul T.\n\nCurl, testified as follows:\n\n      Q:    And as I briefly addressed earlier, we did not\n\n            segregate the fees in this case. So in your opinion\n\n            would it have even been possible to segregate the\n\n            fees    and       expenses   incurred   by   Broadway\n\n            Coffeehouse in pursuing its declaratory judgment\n\n            action to declare the invalid deeds and other\n\n            instruments void from the fees and expenses\n\n            incurred by Broadway Coffeehouse in seeking\n\n            partition of the property and termination of the\n\n            partnership?\n\n      A:    I don’t think that would be reasonable or practical.\n\n      Q:    And if you could explain why.\n\n      A:    Sure. As a practical matter, virtually everything that\n\n            we did was geared toward the declaratory judgment\n\n            claim: Fixing ownership interest in the property and\n\n            the partnership, declaring the deeds void, the other\n\n\n\n                                         52\n\f     instruments. And that was really key to this whole\n\n     thing because the property could not be sold until\n\n     that was done. And that was a problem with both\n\n     these instruments clouding the title.     So all --\n\n     everything -- virtually everything that we did\n\n     advanced the declaratory judgment claim. And I\n\n     don’t think it would be fair or reasonable to\n\n     segregate those out and those other -- the other\n\n     claims. Even if the other claims had not been there,\n\n     95 percent or more of the services would still have\n\n     been required.\n\nQ:   And against whom or against what defendants are\n\n     we seeking an award of attorneys’ fees today?\n\nA:   We are seeking an award of attorneys’ fees against\n\n     Sandra Saks, Lee Nick McFadin, III, and Landen\n\n     Saks because they are the parties who had fought\n\n     us tooth and nail on this case.\n\nQ:   Okay.\n\nA:   And again as to -- going back to your question\n\n     about segregation, I don’t think you could fairly\n\n\n\n                               53\n\f          segregate as between the defendants because\n\n          really they are the defendants who have caused the\n\n          fight. The Trust was on our side from the word go.\n\n          Lauren Saks was on our side once we found out\n\n          that she had answered. She had filed a pro se\n\n          answer that initially was not served on us. Diana\n\n          Flores opposed us represented by Ron Shaw, but\n\n          when we got to the summary judgment hearing, she\n\n          folded her tent and approved the judgment. But\n\n          even she was only making the same arguments\n\n          basically adopting the same things that Sandra\n\n          Saks and Lee Nick McFadin were arguing. So there\n\n          is no question that the opponents were Saks,\n\n          McFadin, and Landen Saks. And even if the other\n\n          defendants had not been in the case, we would\n\n          have been doing virtually the same amount of work.\n\n          So I don’t think we can segregate them out to the\n\n          defendants.\n\nDec. RR 44:22-45:23.\n\n\n\n\n                                 54\n\f     The standard set forth in Tony Gullo does not require more precise\n\nproof for attorney’s fees than for any other claims or expenses.          212\n\nS.W.3d at 314. Based on Mr. Curl’s testimony, the Trial Court properly\n\ndetermined that segregation of the requested attorney’s fees was not\n\nnecessary, and did not err in awarding the full amount of fees asked for at\n\ntrial. See Tony Gullo, 212 S.W.3d at 314 (explaining that, for the trial court\n\nto determine that segregation of the contract and fraud claim fees was not\n\nnecessary, an opinion would have sufficed stating that 95 percent of the\n\nattorney’s drafting time would have been necessary even if there had been\n\nno fraud claim).\n\n     ISSUE NO. 3(a): Is Appellants’ Issue No. 3 regarding the\n                     amount of the supersedeas bond moot\n                     because it has been waived by Appellants,\n                     and does this Court therefore lack\n                     jurisdiction?\n\n     The Saks Parties endeavor to challenge the Trial Court’s Order\n\nsetting the amount of the supersedeas bond as an abuse of discretion.\n\nCR2 457.     Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 24.4(a) prescribes the\n\nmethod for appellate review of the trial court’s ruling on the amount of a\n\nsupersedeas bond. Appendix, tab 16. That review is “by motion in the\n\ncourt of appeals with jurisdiction . . . over the appeal from the judgment in\n\n\n\n\n                                     55\n\fthe case.” Id. Any further appellate review after that motion is “by petition\n\nfor writ of mandamus in the Supreme Court.” Id.\n\n     The Saks Parties filed the motion prescribed by Rule 24.4(a) in this\n\nCourt on November 3, 2014. Appendix, tab 12. This Court denied that\n\nmotion in an Order signed on November 7, 2014. Appendix, tab 13. The\n\nSaks Parties then filed a Motion to Reconsider En Banc Motion to Suspend\n\nthe Judgment and to Review Order Setting the Amount of Supersedeas\n\nBond on November 17, 2014. Appendix, tab 14. The Court denied that\n\nmotion in an Order signed on November 21, 2014. Appendix, tab 15. The\n\nSaks Parties did not file a petition for writ of mandamus in the Supreme\n\nCourt of Texas as Rule 24.4(a) directs for further review from either of this\n\nCourt’s Orders.\n\n     The Saks Parties present no new arguments on this issue in their\n\nBrief. They offer no ground or argument relating to supersedeas on which\n\nthe Court has not already ruled in its review of the supersedeas based on\n\nthe Saks Parties’ Motions under Rule 24.4. The Saks Parties do not argue\n\nthis Court erred when it denied their motions for review of the trial court’s\n\norder setting the amount of security. Nor do The Saks Parties offer any\n\nreason why this Court should reconsider its prior Orders. The Saks Parties’\n\nIssue No. 3 challenges the Trial Court’s Order setting the amount of the\n\n\n\n                                     56\n\fsupersedeas bond, but what the Trial Court did no longer matters. This\n\nCourt has reviewed what the Trial Court did, and affirmed it.\n\n      Thus, the Saks Parties’ Issue No. 3 is moot because it has already\n\nbeen reviewed and decided.         An issue is moot when the controversy\n\nceases to exist or if the trial court’s actions cannot affect the parties’ rights.\n\nHoard Gainer Indus. Co., Ltd. v.

App.—Houston [1st Dist.] July 14, 2005, no pet.) So it\n\nis here with the amount of the supersedeas bond. Because the issue is\n\nmoot, the Court lacks jurisdiction to decide this issue. Id. And because the\n\nSaks Parties did not seek review in the Supreme Court of this Court’s\n\nOrders or even ask this Court to reconsider its Orders on this issue, the\n\nSaks Parties have waived any challenge to the amount for supersedeas.\n\nReview of a supersedeas amount is under an abuse of discretion standard,\n\nso it presents a question of law. Cf. In re Bass, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1868482\"><a href=\"/opinion/1868482/in-re-bass/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">735</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 738 (Tex.\n\n2003, orig. proc.) (abuse of discretion is error in application of legal\n\nprinciples). This Court has already decided that question of law by denying\n\nthe Saks Parties’ Motions; therefore the law of the case doctrine and the\n\npolicies on which that doctrine is based prevent further challenge on this\n\nissue as well.

A motion under Rule 24.4(a) is “[t]he proper\n\nmethod to seek review of a trial court’s determination” on suspending\n\nenforcement of a judgment. Reagan v.

App.—Texarkana March 25, 2009,\n\npet rev. dism’d). Thus, beyond mootness and waiver, Appellants’ Issue No.\n\n3 also fails for lack of jurisdiction on this basis as well. Appellants cite\n\nAppellate Rule of Procedure 25 as the basis for jurisdiction over their\n\nappeal.   Appellants’ Brief, at 2.   Rule 25, however, is not a grant of\n\njurisdiction. It provides the method for commencing an appeal when the\n\nCourt has subject matter jurisdiction for an appeal. Most commonly, that\n\njurisdiction is under Section 51.012 of the Texas Civil Practice and\n\nRemedies Code or Section 22.220 of the Texas Government Code. Those\n\nstatutes provide this Court jurisdiction over appeals from final judgments,\n\nnot orders on supersedeas bonds.          Appellate courts generally lack\n\njurisdiction over appeals from post-judgment orders on enforcing a\n\njudgment. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1004357</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *5. Following that rule, there is no\n\njurisdiction (under Section 51.012 or Section 22.220) for an appeal from an\n\norder on suspending enforcement of a judgment.\n\n\n\n                                     58\n\f     Finally, this Court would not have jurisdiction over an appeal of the\n\nOrder setting the amount of the supersedeas bond because the Saks\n\nParties’ Notice of Appeal of this Order was untimely. Pursuant to Texas\n\nRule of Appellate Procedure 26.1, a notice of appeal must be filed within\n\nthirty days after the judgment is signed.     Appendix, tab 16.

Appendix, tab 17.    Because the\n\nSupplement to Notice of Appeal was filed almost four months after the\n\nOrder was signed, the appeal was not timely perfected, and the appeal of\n\nthe Order on the supersedeas bond must be dismissed.

The question for this Court is\n\nnot whether it would have reached the same conclusion as the Trial Court,\n\nbut whether the Trial Court acted without reference to any guiding rule or\n\nprinciple or acted arbitrarily or unreasonable. Id.\n\n      The Trial Court did what Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 24.2\n\nprescribes.   To the extent the Judgment involves an interest in real\n\nproperty, Rule 24.2(a)(2)(A) applies, and directs the Trial Court to set an\n\namount of security of at least the value of the property’s rent or revenue.\n\nCR2 459; Appendix, tab 16. The evidence of that monthly rent or revenue\n\nwas undisputed, and the trial court multiplied the rent by a reasonable\n\nestimate of the time for disposing of Appellants’ inevitable appeals. Nov.\n\n14 RR 11:4-19, 29:9-30:6, 50:8-51:20.\n\n      If the Judgment is not subject to Rule 24.2(a)(2)(A), then Rule\n\n24.2(a)(2)(B) applies, and the Trial Court had discretion to set the\n\nnecessary security in an amount the Trial Court decided would be\n\nnecessary to protect Coffeehouse and the Trust from damage that an\n\nappeal might cause. CR2 459; Nov. RR 21:9-25, 31:16, 32:9; Appendix,\n\ntab 16. The Trial Court’s Order, supported by the evidence, does just that,\n\nand the Trial Court did not abuse its discretion. In either event, the Saks\n\nParties’ Issue No. 3 should be overruled.\n\n\n\n                                      60\n\f                                PRAYER\n\n      WHEREFORE, Appellees respectfully pray that the Trial Court’s\n\nJudgment be affirmed and that the Order setting the amount of the\n\nsupersedeas bond be affirmed, or that appeal of that Order be dismissed\n\nfor lack of jurisdiction.\n\n\n                                Respectfully Submitted,\n\n                                CURL STAHL GEIS\n                                A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION\n                                700 North St. Mary’s Street, Suite 1800\n                                San Antonio, Texas 78205\n                                Telephone: (210) 226-2182\n                                Telecopier: (210) 226-1691\n\n\n                                BY: /s/ Brittany M.

The appellees, Lauren Saks and Marcus P. Rogers, urge us to affirm the\n\njudgment confirming the arbitration award and to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction the appeal from\n\nthe order in aid of enforcement of judgment. We affirm the judgment confirming the arbitration\n\naward, but dismiss for lack of jurisdiction the appeal from the order in aid of enforcement of\n\njudgment.\n\n                                         BACKGROUND\n\n       These appeals arise from disputes concerning an inter vivos trust. In 1991, Sandra created\n\nthe trust for the benefit of her children, “Gloria Lauren Nicole Saks [‘Lauren’] and Margaret\n\nLanden Saks Merriman [‘Landen’] and any other children later born or legally adopted . . . by\n\nSandra Saks [‘Sandra’].” In accordance with the terms of the trust agreement, Sandra’s sister,\n\nDiane Flores, was appointed trustee. Lauren and Landen are the trust’s sole beneficiaries.\n\n       In August 2011, Lauren filed suit against Flores, the trustee, and Sandra, the settlor, in a\n\nstatutory probate court in Bexar County, Texas. The suit, which alleged breaches of fiduciary duty\n\nand failures to comply with the trust agreement, sought an accounting and a constructive trust.\n\nLauren also sought Flores’s removal as trustee. On December 28, 2011, the probate court\n\nappointed Marcus P. Rogers as interim trustee. Thereafter, Rogers submitted a report to the probate\n\ncourt in which he concluded that any attempt by Flores to terminate the trust was ineffective.\n\n       On April 2, 2012, the parties entered into a mediated settlement agreement (“MSA”). The\n\nMSA required the parties to resolve future disputes by mediation and arbitration. Specifically, the\n\nMSA provided,\n\n       If one or more disputes arise with regard to the interpretation and/or performance\n       of this Agreement or any of its provisions, including the form of further documents\n       to be executed, the Parties agree to further mediation in an attempt to resolve same\n       with Thomas Smith, the Mediator[] who facilitated this settlement. In the event a\n       dispute arises between the Parties, it is hereby agreed that the dispute shall be\n       referred to Thomas Smith, the Mediator herein, for arbitration in accordance with\n       the applicable United States Arbitration and Mediation Rules of Arbitration. The\n                                               -2-\n\f                                                                        04-13-00518-CV; 04-13-00875-CV\n\n\n        arbitrator’s decision shall be final and legally binding and judgment may be entered\n        thereon . . . .\n\n        On May 8, 2012, the probate court signed an order approving the MSA and authorizing\n\nRogers, the interim trustee, to sign the MSA. However, the order approving the MSA did not\n\ndismiss the claims in the underlying suit.\n\n        On August 21, 2012, Lauren filed a motion to compel arbitration, claiming that matters\n\nregarding the interpretation and performance of the MSA remained unresolved. On September 4,\n\n2012, the probate court, in accordance with the MSA, ordered Sandra, Lauren, Landen, and Rogers\n\nto attend mediation and, if necessary, arbitration. The arbitration took place on October 18, 2012.\n\nThe arbitrator’s award ordered Sandra and Flores to execute certain documents conveying to the\n\ntrust all of their rights, title, and interest in certain property “no later than October 31, 2012.”\n\n        Sandra filed a motion asking the probate court to vacate the arbitrator’s award. The motion\n\nwas denied. Landen did not ask the probate court to vacate the arbitrator’s award.\n\n        On May 7, 2013, the probate court signed a final judgment confirming the arbitrator’s\n\naward. The probate court incorporated the arbitration award into its judgment and entered it as a\n\njudgment of the court. The arbitration award ordered Sandra and Landen to execute certain\n\nconveyance documents. Sandra and Landen appealed the judgment confirming the arbitrator’s\n\naward. This appeal was docketed in this court as appellate cause number 04-13-00518-CV.\n\n        On November 14, 2013, the trial court signed an order titled, “Order in Aid of Enforcement\n\nof Judgment.” In this order, the probate court found that Sandra and Landen had failed to comply\n\nwith the arbitration award and the judgment confirming the arbitration award by failing to execute\n\nthe conveyance documents as previously ordered, and deemed the documents executed. Sandra\n\nand Landen appealed this order. The latter appeal was docketed in this court as appellate cause\n\nnumber 04-13-00875-CV.\n\n\n                                                  -3-\n\f                                                                     04-13-00518-CV; 04-13-00875-CV\n\n\n                      JUDGMENT CONFIRMING THE ARBITRATION AWARD\n\n       An arbitration award is given the same effect as a judgment of last resort and is conclusive\n\nas to all matters of fact and law.

App.—Dallas 2014, no pet.).\n\nJurisdictional Arguments\n\n            As a threshold matter, we note the arguments presented by Sandra and Landen are unrelated\n\nto any grounds presented in Sandra’s motion to vacate the arbitration award. 1 Instead, Sandra and\n\nLanden argue the probate court was deprived of subject matter jurisdiction both at the time it\n\ncompelled arbitration and at the time it rendered judgment confirming the arbitration award. 2 In\n\nmaking these jurisdictional arguments, Sandra and Landen acknowledge that the probate court\n\nacquired subject matter jurisdiction over Lauren’s suit. However, according to Sandra and Landen,\n\nprior to compelling arbitration, the probate court lost subject matter jurisdiction either because (1)\n\nthe trust had terminated or (2) the probate court’s plenary power had expired. In response, Lauren\n\nand Rogers argue the probate court did not lose subject matter jurisdiction prior to compelling\n\narbitration or prior to confirming the arbitration award.\n\n            We will address both jurisdictional theories presented by Sandra and Landen. Under their\n\nfirst theory, that the probate court lost subject matter jurisdiction because of the termination of the\n\ntrust, Sandra and Landen contend that under the language of the trust agreement, Flores, as trustee,\n\n\n\n1\n    Landen filed a motion for new trial but did not file a motion to vacate the arbitration award.\n2\n    In appellate cause number 04-13-00518-CV, Sandra and Landen state their issues as follows:\n\n       1.   Did the trial court’s plenary power end on June 9, 2012, which was 30 days after the M[ediated]\n            S[ettlement] A[greement] was approved on May 8, 2012?\n\n       2.   Did the court lack jurisdiction to compel the parties to arbitration pursuant to an [o]rder dated September\n            5, 2012?\n\n       3.   Was the arbitration award void because arbitration was commenced pursuant to a void court order rather\n            than pursuant to a petition for arbitration filed in accordance with the United States Arbitration and\n            Mediation Rules of Arbitration as provided in the Mediated Settlement Agreement?\n\n       4.   Was the trial court’s [j]udgment signed on May 7, 2013, approving a void arbitration award also void?\n\n                                                             -5-\n\f                                                                         04-13-00518-CV; 04-13-00875-CV\n\n\nwas authorized to terminate the trust and distribute the trust assets to the income beneficiaries.\n\nThey further contend that, on or about December 21, 2011, Flores terminated the trust in\n\naccordance with the trust agreement, and the termination deprived the probate court of jurisdiction\n\nto compel arbitration.\n\n        In response, Lauren and Rogers argue the trust was never terminated. This argument is\n\nsupported by the record. Both the MSA reached by the parties and the arbitration award are\n\npremised on the notion that the trust was not terminated. Additionally, Lauren argues that, even if\n\nthe trust had been terminated, the probate court would not have been deprived of jurisdiction.\n\nAccording to Lauren, the probate court’s jurisdiction was invoked when she filed the underlying\n\nsuit alleging claims for breach of fiduciary duty and failures to comply with the trust agreement.\n\nLauren contends that even if the trust had been terminated on December 21, 2011, her claims\n\nwould have survived the termination of the trust, and therefore, the probate court would have\n\nretained subject matter jurisdiction. We find Lauren and Rogers’s arguments convincing. We\n\nconclude that the probate court was not deprived of jurisdiction based on the argument that the\n\ntrust was terminated.\n\n        Under their second theory, Sandra and Landen argue that the order compelling arbitration\n\nand the judgment confirming the arbitration award are void because they were signed after the\n\nprobate court’s plenary power expired. This argument is based on the theory that the order\n\napproving the MSA constituted rendition of a final judgment and the probate court’s jurisdiction\n\nended thirty days after it signed the order approving the MSA.\n\n        Mere approval of a settlement agreement does not constitute rendition of judgment.

Rogers, Interim Trustee of\n        the Saks Children Family Trust or ATFL&L, is authorized to sign the Mediated\n        Settlement Agreement attached to this Motion.\n\nThus, the order approving the MSA did not dispose of all claims and parties before the probate\n\ncourt, nor did it state with unmistakable clarity that it was a final judgment. See Lehmann, 39\n\nS.W.3d at 192-93. Additionally, nothing in the record indicates that the order approving the MSA\n\nwas a final judgment. Because the MSA was not a final judgment, the probate court’s plenary\n\npower did not expire thirty days after the probate court signed the order.\n\n        The only case cited by Sandra and Landen that arguably supports their jurisdictional\n\narguments is Goodman v. Summit at West Rim, Ltd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2408546\"><a href=\"/opinion/2408546/goodman-v-summit-at-west-rim-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">952</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">930</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. App.—Austin 1997,\n\nno pet.). In Goodman, the executor of a decedent’s estate filed suit in the probate court to clear\n\ntitle to property owned by the estate. Id. at 932. In response, the defendant brought third-party\n\nclaims against other entities. Id. Initially, the probate court exercised its ancillary jurisdiction over\n\nthe third-party claims. Id. However, once matters concerning the estate were settled, the probate\n\ncourt dismissed all of the claims by and against the estate. Id. Thereafter, the third-party defendants\n\nmoved to dismiss the claims against them on the ground that, once the claims involving the estate\n\nwere settled, the probate court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the ancillary claims.\n\nId. The probate court agreed and dismissed the ancillary claims from the probate court. Id. The\n\ncourt of appeals upheld the dismissal, noting that the “probate court had discretion to resolve\n\nancillary claims against third parties only to the extent that such claims were necessary to resolve\n                                                  -7-\n\f                                                                                    04-13-00518-CV; 04-13-00875-CV\n\n\nclaims within its original jurisdiction. . . . The court’s discretion undoubtedly vanished with the\n\ndismissal of the estate from the probate proceeding.” Id. at 934.\n\n         Sandra and Landen’s reliance on Goodman is misplaced. Goodman involved the probate\n\ncourt’s ancillary jurisdiction over a claim related to a decedent’s estate. Id. at 933. However, unlike\n\nGoodman, the present case was not a probate proceeding and it did not involve the exercise of\n\nancillary jurisdiction. See TEX. ESTATES CODE ANN. § 22.029 (West 2014) (defining probate\n\nproceedings as proceedings or matters relating to a decedent’s estate). Instead, the present case\n\nwas an action against a trustee and it involved an inter vivos trust. See TEX. ESTATES CODE ANN.\n\n§ 32.006; Nicholson, 438 S.W.3d at 214-15 (acknowledging that a statutory probate court has\n\njurisdiction not only over matters against a trustee or involving an inter vivos trust, but also over\n\nprobate proceedings). Thus, Goodman is inapplicable to the present case.\n\n         We conclude the probate court had subject matter jurisdiction at the time it compelled\n\narbitration and at the time it rendered judgment confirming the arbitration award. 3 We, therefore,\n\noverrule Sandra and Landen’s arguments that the order compelling arbitration and the judgment\n\nconfirming the arbitration award were void.\n\nRemaining arguments\n\n         Rule 38.1(i) of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure requires a brief to contain a “clear\n\nand concise argument for the contentions made with appropriate citations to authorities and to the\n\nrecord.” TEX.

P. 38.1(i).\n\n                            ORDER IN AID OF ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENT\n\n        Next, Sandra and Landen challenge the probate court’s order in aid of enforcement of\n\njudgment. 4 This order states that Sandra and Landen failed to execute certain conveyance\n\ndocuments as ordered in the judgment confirming the arbitration award and deems these\n\ndocuments executed “by operation of law.”\n\n        Generally, post-judgment orders made for the purpose of carrying into effect a prior\n\njudgment are not subject to appeal because they are not final judgments.

A few types of post-judgment orders, such as\n\n\n4\n Lee Nick McFadin III also filed a notice of appeal in appellate cause number 04-13-00875-CV. Rogers has moved\nto dismiss McFadin from this appeal because McFadin was not a party below. Because we conclude that we have no\njurisdiction over an appeal from the order in aid of enforcement of judgment, Rogers’s motion to dismiss McFadin is\ndenied as moot.\n\n                                                       -9-\n\f                                                                     04-13-00518-CV; 04-13-00875-CV\n\n\nthose in the nature of a mandatory injunction, are appealable.

App.—Texarkana 2008, no pet.) (concluding\n\na particular turnover order was not in the nature of a mandatory injunction and therefore was not\n\nappealable).\n\n       Here, Lauren argues that the general rule applies in this case, and therefore, the appeal from\n\nthe order in aid of enforcement of judgment must be dismissed. We agree that the order in aid of\n\nenforcement of judgment is not an appealable order. It is not in the nature of a mandatory\n\ninjunction; it merely carries into effect the judgment confirming the arbitration award. Thus, it is\n\nnot the type of post-judgment order that is reviewable by appeal. The appeal from the order in aid\n\nof enforcement of judgment is therefore dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. See Walter, 422 S.W.3d\n\nat 855-56 (dismissing appeal for lack of jurisdiction when challenged order did not fall within the\n\nlimited class of appealable, post-judgment orders); Qualia, 37 S.W.3d at 129 (dismissing for lack\n\nof jurisdiction appeal from an order that simply provided for enforcement of a judgment in\n\nMexico).\n\n                               DAMAGES FOR FRIVOLOUS APPEAL\n\n       In a cross-issue, Rogers urges this court to impose sanctions against Sandra and Landen\n\nfor filing frivolous appeals. Rule 45 of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure allows an appellate\n\ncourt, after a determination that an appeal is frivolous, to award to the prevailing party “just\n\ndamages.” TEX. R. APP. P. 45. Typically, appellate courts award the amount of attorney’s fees\n\nincurred by the appellee as proven by testimony or affidavit. Walker v.

Appeals from Trial Court Judgments and Orders (Refs & Annos)\n        Rule 24. Suspension of Enforcement of Judgment Pending Appeal in Civil Cases (Refs & Annos)\n\n                                                TX Rules App.Proc., Rule 24.2\n\n                                         24.2. Amount of Bond, Deposit or Security\n\n                                                           Currentness\n\n\n(a) Type of Judgment.\n\n\n  (1) For Recovery of Money. When the judgment is for money, the amount of the bond, deposit, or security must equal the\n  sum of compensatory damages awarded in the judgment, interest for the estimated duration of the appeal, and costs awarded\n  in the judgment. But the amount must not exceed the lesser of:\n\n\n    (A) 50 percent of the judgment debtor's current net worth; or\n\n\n    (B) 25 million dollars.\n\n\n  (2) For Recovery of Property. When the judgment is for the recovery of an interest in real or personal property, the trial court\n  will determine the type of security that the judgment debtor must post. The amount of that security must be at least:\n\n\n    (A) the value of the property interest's rent or revenue, if the property interest is real; or\n\n\n    (B) the value of the property interest on the date when the court rendered judgment, if the property interest is personal.\n\n\n  (3) Other Judgment. When the judgment is for something other than money or an interest in property, the trial court must\n  set the amount and type of security that the judgment debtor must post. The security must adequately protect the judgment\n  creditor against loss or damage that the appeal might cause. But the trial court may decline to permit the judgment to be\n  superseded if the judgment creditor posts security ordered by the trial court in an amount and type that will secure the judgment\n  debtor against any loss or damage caused by the relief granted the judgment creditor if an appellate court determines, on\n  final disposition, that that relief was improper.\n\n\n  (4) Conservatorship or Custody. When the judgment involves the conservatorship or custody of a minor or other person under\n  legal disability, enforcement of the judgment will not be suspended, with or without security, unless ordered by the trial\n  court. But upon a proper showing, the appellate court may suspend enforcement of the judgment with or without security.\n\n\n  (5) For a Governmental Entity. When a judgment in favor of a governmental entity in its governmental capacity is one in which\n  the entity has no pecuniary interest, the trial court must determine whether to suspend enforcement, with or without security,\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                               1\n\f24.2. Amount of Bond, Deposit or Security, TX R APP Rule 24.2\n\n\n  taking into account the harm that is likely to result to the judgment debtor if enforcement is not suspended, and the harm that\n  is likely to result to others if enforcement is suspended. The appellate court may review the trial court's determination and\n  suspend enforcement of the judgment, with or without security, or refuse to suspend the judgment. If security is required,\n  recovery is limited to the governmental entity's actual damages resulting from suspension of the judgment.\n\n\n(b) Lesser Amount. The trial court must lower the amount of security required by (a) to an amount that will not cause the\njudgment debtor substantial economic harm if, after notice to all parties and a hearing, the court finds that posting a bond,\ndeposit, or security in the amount required by (a) is likely to cause the judgment debtor substantial economic harm.\n\n\n(c) Determination of Net Worth.\n\n\n  (1) Judgment Debtor's Affidavit Required; Contents; Prima Facie Evidence. A judgment debtor who provides a bond, deposit,\n  or security under (a)(1)(A) in an amount based on the debtor's net worth must simultaneously file with the trial court clerk\n  an affidavit that states the debtor's net worth and states complete, detailed information concerning the debtor's assets and\n  liabilities from which net worth can be ascertained. An affidavit that meets these requirements is prima facie evidence of the\n  debtor's net worth for the purpose of establishing the amount of the bond, deposit, or security required to suspend enforcement\n  of the judgment. A trial court clerk must receive and file a net-worth affidavit tendered for filing by a judgment debtor.\n\n\n  (2) Contest; Discovery. A judgment creditor may file a contest to the debtor's claimed net worth. The contest need not be\n  sworn. The creditor may conduct reasonable discovery concerning the judgment debtor's net worth.\n\n\n  (3) Hearing; Burden of Proof; Findings; Additional Security. The trial court must hear a judgment creditor's contest of the\n  judgment debtor's claimed net worth promptly after any discovery has been completed. The judgment debtor has the burden of\n  proving net worth. The trial court must issue an order that states the debtor's net worth and states with particularity the factual\n  basis for that determination. If the trial court orders additional or other security to supersede the judgment, the enforcement\n  of the judgment will be suspended for twenty days after the trial court's order. If the judgment debtor does not comply with\n  the order within that period, the judgment may be enforced against the judgment debtor.\n\n\n(d) Injunction. The trial court may enjoin the judgment debtor from dissipating or transferring assets to avoid satisfaction of\nthe judgment, but the trial court may not make any order that interferes with the judgment debtor's use, transfer, conveyance,\nor dissipation of assets in the normal course of business.\n\n\nCredits\nEff.

A party may seek review of the trial court's ruling by motion filed in the court of appeals with jurisdiction\nor potential jurisdiction over the appeal from the judgment in the case. A party may seek review of the court of appeals' ruling\non the motion by petition for writ of mandamus in the Supreme Court. The appellate court may review:\n\n\n  (1) the sufficiency or excessiveness of the amount of security, but when the judgment is for money, the appellate court must\n  not modify the amount of security to exceed the limits imposed by Rule 24.2(a)(1);\n\n\n  (2) the sureties on any bond;\n\n\n  (3) the type of security;\n\n\n  (4) the determination whether to permit suspension of enforcement; and\n\n\n  (5) the trial court's exercise of discretion under Rule 24.3(a).\n\n\n(b) Grounds of Review. Review may be based both on conditions as they existed at the time the trial court signed an order, and\non changes in those conditions afterward.\n\n\n(c) Temporary Orders. The appellate court may issue any temporary orders necessary to preserve the parties' rights.\n\n\n(d) Action by Appellate Court. The motion must be heard at the earliest practicable time. The appellate court may require that the\namount of a bond, deposit, or other security be increased or decreased, and that another bond, deposit, or security be provided\nand approved by the trial court clerk. The appellate court may require other changes in the trial court order. The appellate court\nmay remand to the trial court for entry of findings of fact or for the taking of evidence.\n\n\n(e) Effect of Ruling. If the appellate court orders additional or other security to supersede the judgment, enforcement will be\nsuspended for 20 days after the appellate court's order. If the judgment debtor does not comply with the order within that period,\nthe judgment may be enforced. When any additional bond, deposit, or security has been filed, the trial court clerk must notify\nthe appellate court. The posting of additional security will not release the previously posted security or affect any alternative\nsecurity arrangements that the judgment debtor previously made unless specifically ordered by the appellate court.\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.
