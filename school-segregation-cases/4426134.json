No. A-15-814.\n\n                1.\t Divorce: Child Custody. When custody of minor children is an issue in\n                     a proceeding to dissolve the marriage of the children’s parents, custody\n                     is determined by parental fitness and the children’s best interests.\n                2.\t Child Custody. When both parents are found to be fit, the inquiry for\n                     the court on the issue of custody is the best interests of the children.\n                3.\t Parent and Child. The best interests of a child require a parent-\n                     ing arrangement for a child’s safety, emotional growth, health, stabil-\n                     ity, and physical care and regular and continuous school attendance\n                     and progress.\n                 4.\t ____. The best interests of a child also require that the child’s families\n                     and those serving in parenting roles remain appropriately active and\n                     involved in parenting with safe, appropriate, continuing quality contact\n                     between children and their families when they have shown the ability to\n                     act in the best interests of the child and have shared in the responsibili-\n                     ties of raising the child.\n                5.\t Divorce: Child Custody: Public Policy. It is sound public policy to\n                     keep children together when possible, but considerations of public\n                     policy do not, in all cases, prevent the splitting of the custody of the\n                     children when a marriage is dissolved; rather, the ultimate standard is\n                     the best interests of the children.\n                6.\t Child Support. The paramount concern and question in determining\n                     child support is the best interests of the child.\n                7.\t Rules of the Supreme Court: Child Support: Presumptions. In gen-\n                     eral, child support payments should be set according to the Nebraska\n                     Child Support Guidelines, adopted by the Nebraska Supreme Court,\n                     which are presumed to be in the best interests of the child.\n                8.\t Child Support. In calculating child support, the court must consider the\n                     total monthly income, defined as income of both parties derived from\n                     all sources.\n\f                                    - 324 -\n            Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n                 24 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                          BURCHAM v. BURCHAM\n                           Cite as 24 Neb. App. 323\n\n 9.\t Child Support: Presumptions. All income from employment must be\n     included in the initial child support calculation, which then becomes a\n     rebuttable presumption of appropriate support.\n10.\t Child Support. Copies of at least 2 years’ tax returns, financial state-\n     ments, and current wage stubs should be furnished to the court for\n     purposes of determining the parents’ income in order to calculate\n     child support.\n11.\t ____. Income derived from farming is subject to fluctuations. The use of\n     income averaging when dealing with farm income has been approved for\n     purposes of calculating child support.\n12.\t Divorce: Appeal and Error. In a de novo review of a judgment in\n     marriage dissolution proceedings, when the evidence is in conflict, an\n     appellate court considers, and may give weight to, the fact that the trial\n     judge heard and observed the witnesses and accepted one version of the\n     facts rather than another.\n13.\t Records: Appeal and Error. It is incumbent upon the appellant to\n     present a record supporting the errors assigned; absent such a record,\n     an appellate court will affirm the lower court’s decision regarding\n     those errors.\n14.\t Appeal and Error. Generally, a party cannot complain of error which\n     the party has invited the court to commit.\n15.\t Divorce: Minors: Stipulations. Parties in a proceeding to dissolve a\n     marriage cannot control the disposition of matters pertaining to minor\n     children by agreement.\n16.\t Parent and Child: Social Security. Social Security benefits paid to\n     children as a result of their parents’ employment are not a mere gratuity\n     from the federal government but have been earned through the parent’s\n     payment of Social Security taxes.\n17.\t Parent and Child: Child Support: Social Security. A request to apply\n     Social Security benefits received as a result of a parent’s employment to\n     the parent’s child support obligation is merely a request to identify the\n     source of payment, and a Social Security benefit can serve as a substi-\n     tute source of income.\n18.\t ____: ____: ____. Social Security benefits received on behalf of a\n     parent’s employment may be used to offset a portion of child support\n     costs, but it is not appropriate to offset child support costs where the\n     Social Security benefits are received due to the disability of the child\n     and therefore intended to mitigate the additional costs accompany-\n     ing disabilities.\n19.\t ____: ____: ____. Social Security disability benefits paid on behalf of\n     a parent’s disability can be considered income to the parent for child\n     support purposes, because the benefits are received in lieu of the par-\n     ent’s income.\n\f                                    - 325 -\n            Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n                 24 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                           BURCHAM v. BURCHAM\n                            Cite as 24 Neb. App. 323\n\n20.\t Appeal and Error. An alleged error must be both specifically assigned\n     and specifically argued in the brief of the party asserting the error to be\n     considered by an appellate court.\n21.\t Divorce: Property Division. Under Neb. Rev. Stat. § 42-365 (Reissue\n     2008), the equitable division of property is a three-step process. The\n     first step is to classify the parties’ property as marital or nonmarital.\n     The second step is to value the marital assets and marital liabilities\n     of the parties. The third step is to calculate and divide the net marital\n     estate between the parties in accordance with the principles contained\n     in § 42-365.\n22.\t ____: ____. Property which one party brings into the marriage is gener-\n     ally excluded from the marital estate.\n23.\t Divorce: Property Division: Proof. The burden of proof to show that\n     property is nonmarital remains with the person making the claim in a\n     dissolution proceeding.\n24.\t Divorce: Property Division. An exception to the general rule that\n     property owned prior to the marriage is excluded from the marital estate\n     exists where both of the spouses have contributed to the improvement\n     or operation of the nonmarital property or where the spouse not owning\n     the nonmarital property has significantly cared for the property during\n     the marriage.\n25.\t ____: ____. When applying the exception to the general rule regarding\n     premarital property, evidence of the value of the contributions and evi-\n     dence that the contributions were significant are generally required.\n26.\t ____: ____. Generally, all property accumulated and acquired by either\n     spouse during a marriage is part of the marital estate. Exceptions\n     include property that a spouse acquired before the marriage, or by gift\n     or inheritance.\n27.\t ____: ____. Setting aside nonmarital property is simple if the spouse\n     possesses the original asset, but can be problematic if the original asset\n     no longer exists.\n28.\t ____: ____. Separate property becomes marital property by commin-\n     gling if it is inextricably mixed with marital property or with the sepa-\n     rate property of the other spouse.\n29.\t ____: ____. If the separate property remains segregated or is traceable\n     into its product, commingling does not occur.\n30.\t Property Division: Proof. The burden of proof rests with the party\n     claiming that property is nonmarital.\n31.\t Property Division. Marital debt is defined as a debt incurred during\n     the marriage and before the date of separation, by either spouse or both\n     spouses, for the joint benefit of the parties.\n32.\t Divorce: Attorney Fees: Appeal and Error. In a dissolution of mar-\n     riage case, an award of attorney fees is discretionary, is reviewed de\n\f                                    - 326 -\n            Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n                 24 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                          BURCHAM v.

We otherwise affirm.\n\n                       BACKGROUND\n   Linda and David were married in 2001, and David filed\nfor dissolution of the marriage in November 2013. During the\nmarriage, the parties adopted three siblings: a daughter, H.B.,\nborn in 1997; and two sons, A.B., born in 1999, and Z.B.,\nborn in 2001. Initially during the dissolution proceedings,\n\f                              - 327 -\n         Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n              24 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                     BURCHAM v. BURCHAM\n                      Cite as 24 Neb. App. 323\n\nthe parties shared temporary joint legal and physical custody\nof the children, following a “week on, week off” schedule;\nhowever, in October 2014, the court modified the temporary\norder and placed physical custody of H.B. with Linda and\nphysical custody of A.B. and Z.B. with David. Linda received\nparenting time with the boys every other weekend, and David\nreceived parenting time with H.B. on alternating weekends but\nonly upon the agreement of Linda, David, and H.B.\n   When Linda and David first married, they lived in a house\nDavid owned prior to the marriage. In 2003, they built the\nmarital residence, located in Newcastle, Nebraska, on 45 acres\nof land that David had purchased in 1996. David worked at a\ntelephone company throughout the marriage and earned addi-\ntional income from farming. Linda worked full time during\nthe marriage until reducing her schedule to 80 percent after\nthe children were adopted. During that time, she was primarily\nresponsible for the care of the children. After nearly 8 years,\nshe resumed full-time employment.\n   All three of the children have special needs. H.B.’s mental\nhealth presented the greatest challenge for Linda and David.\nH.B. was admitted to a mental health facility on two occasions\nin 2012; the first stay was for 2 weeks and the second stay was\nfor 6 weeks. She was admitted again in March 2013 after cut-\nting herself with a knife. In September 2014, H.B. attempted\nsuicide by overdosing on various pills. Linda took H.B. to the\nemergency room, and she was admitted to the mental health\nfacility where she remained for 6 to 8 weeks.\n   Linda testified at trial that she never had any concerns\nthat H.B. would harm A.B. or Z.B., but she acknowledged\nthat an admission report from the mental health facility\ndated March 5, 2013, indicated that Linda reported finding\na graphic drawing H.B. made depicting her assaulting her\nbrothers, that Linda expressed concern about the disappear-\nance of two family cats, that Linda and David expressed\nconcern about H.B.’s safety upon returning home and the\nsafety of other family members, and that Linda reported that\n\f                               - 328 -\n          Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n               24 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                      BURCHAM v. BURCHAM\n                       Cite as 24 Neb. App. 323\n\nH.B. appears to want to hurt the ones who love her the most.\nAt trial, David testified that he does have concerns about the\nboys’ safety around H.B.\n   The evidence also established that the Department of Health\nand Human Services substantiated a report of David’s physi-\ncally abusing H.B. in October 2013. H.B. was observed with\na bruise on her face from being “smacked” by David after\nan argument. Although David was allowed visits with H.B.\nduring the pendency of the dissolution proceedings, H.B. had\nnot spent any nights with David after December 2013, and\nDavid did not communicate to Linda a desire to spend any\ntime with H.B. Throughout the case, H.B. continued to attend\ntherapy sessions with a counselor and began seeing a psychia-\ntrist at the end of 2014. According to Linda, H.B. responded\nvery well to new medications, and she noticed a significant\nimprovement in H.B.’s depression.\n   A.B., who was 15 years old at the time of trial, has been\ndiagnosed with mild mental retardation and has “IEPs at\nschool.” He also has a hearing delay. Nevertheless, he par-\nticipates in football, basketball, and track and is involved in\n4-H activities. David described A.B. as “a very happy-go-\nlucky kid” and acknowledged that he will always need some\nkind of assistance and guidance. He also said that A.B. is his\n“right-hand man” and wants to help David with everything.\nA.B. testified that he enjoys living with David because that\nway they get to spend more time together. He would like to\ncontinue living with David and seeing Linda on the week-\nends but said that he would like to see H.B. more often. He\nsaid that he, H.B., and Z.B. get along well and have a good\ntime together.\n   Z.B. was 13 years old at the time of trial. He has been\ndiagnosed with “ADHD” and has “IEPs” at school as well.\nNevertheless, like A.B., he also participates in football, basket-\nball, and track at school and is involved in 4-H activities. He\ntestified that he enjoys living with David because he can stay\nin one place instead of moving around so much.\n\f                               - 329 -\n          Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n               24 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                      BURCHAM v. BURCHAM\n                       Cite as 24 Neb. App. 323\n\n   Because of the children’s special needs, the parties receive\nan adoption subsidy of $1,300 per month from the State of\nKansas, the state from which the children were adopted. Linda\nrequested that the court return to the joint physical custody\narrangement it initially ordered utilizing the week on, week\noff schedule. She believed it was important for the children\nto remain together because she and David adopted them as a\nsibling group so they should remain a sibling group. David\ntestified, however, that he did not believe Linda and he could\ncommunicate well enough to share joint physical custody. He\nbelieved that splitting the children up was in their best interests\nbecause the boys were thriving and comfortable living with\nhim and because there are issues with H.B. that place the boys\nat risk. He did not believe sharing custody of the boys worked\nwell for them, and now that they have more structure and sta-\nbility, their grades and behavior have improved.\n   The district court entered the decree dissolving Linda and\nDavid’s marriage on August 5, 2015. The court found it was\nin the best interests of the children that David have legal\ncustody and primary physical custody of A.B. and Z.B. and\nthat Linda have legal custody and primary physical custody\nof H.B. Linda was awarded visitation with the boys every\nother weekend.\n   Linda was also ordered to pay $379 per month in child\nsupport for three children, $790 per month for two children,\nand $588 per month for one child. In calculating the parties’\nincomes for child support purposes, the court utilized the\nparties’ incomes from their employment and added $200 per\nmonth in farming income for David. The court also assigned\nthe adoption subsidy to the parent with custody of the child,\nmeaning David received the subsidy for the boys and Linda\nreceived the subsidy for H.B.\n   The court valued and divided the parties’ property utilizing\ntheir joint property statement. Ultimately, Linda was ordered\nto make an equalization payment of $16,829 to David in\nmonthly installments of $500.

The best interests of a child also require that\n      the child’s families and those serving in parenting roles\n      remain appropriately active and involved in parent-\n      ing with safe, appropriate, continuing quality contact\n      between children and their families when they have\n      shown the ability to act in the best interests of the\n      child and have shared in the responsibilities of raising\n      the child.\n§ 43-2923(3). Section 43-2923(6) further provides:\n      In determining custody and parenting arrangements, the\n      court shall consider the best interests of the minor child,\n      which shall include, but not be limited to, consideration\n      of the foregoing factors and:\n         (a) The relationship of the minor child to each parent\n      prior to the commencement of the action or any subse-\n      quent hearing;\n         (b) The desires and wishes of the minor child, if\n      of an age of comprehension but regardless of chrono-\n      logical age, when such desires and wishes are based on\n      sound reasoning;\n         (c) The general health, welfare, and social behavior of\n      the minor child;\n         (d) Credible evidence of abuse inflicted on any family\n      or household member[;] and\n         (e) Credible evidence of child abuse or neglect or\n      domestic partner abuse.\n\f                               - 332 -\n          Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n               24 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                      BURCHAM v. BURCHAM\n                       Cite as 24 Neb. App. 323\n\n    [5] Both parties submitted evidence at trial regarding cus-\ntody of A.B. and Z.B. Custody of H.B. was not at issue; the\nparties agreed that it was in her best interests to reside with\nLinda. Linda claimed that awarding her custody was in the\nboys’ best interests because she had always been their primary\ncaregiver and it would allow them to maintain their close rela-\ntionship with H.B. Although the Supreme Court has acknowl-\nedged that it is sound public policy to keep children together\nwhen possible, considerations of public policy do not, in all\ncases, prevent the splitting of the custody of the children when\na marriage is dissolved; rather, the ultimate standard is the best\ninterests of the children. Ritter v. Ritter, 234 Neb. 203, 450\nN.W.2d 204 (1990).\n    We understand Linda’s desire to keep all three siblings\ntogether, particularly her plea at trial that because she and\nDavid adopted the children as a sibling group, they deserve\nto remain a sibling group. We appreciate the district court’s\nconcern regarding the safety of the boys due to concerns about\nH.B.’s mental health but also consider Linda’s testimony that\nH.B.’s medication has resulted in significant improvement in\nher depression symptoms. We also recognize the evidence at\ntrial establishing that the children are close to one another and\n“bicker” as normal siblings do, and A.B.’s testimony that see-\ning H.B. every other weekend was not enough time and that he\nwished he had more contact with his sister.\n    Although separating the children may not be the ideal\nsituation, ultimately the record supports the conclusion that\nit is in the boys’ best interests to be placed with David. Both\nboys testified that they did not like the week on, week off\njoint custody arrangement and liked living with David. They\nindicated they enjoyed living at the marital residence because\nof the animals and the farming activities they did with David.\nDavid opined that the joint custody arrangement did not work\nfor the boys; however, they were thriving and comfortable\nliving with him, and their behavior and grades had improved\nas a result of having more structure and stability. Based on\n\f                               - 333 -\n          Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n               24 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                      BURCHAM v. BURCHAM\n                       Cite as 24 Neb. App. 323\n\nthe record before us, we cannot find that the district court\nabused its discretion in awarding custody of A.B. and Z.B.\nto David.\n   In the alternative, Linda argues that the district court\nshould have awarded joint legal and physical custody of\nA.B. and Z.B., returning to the alternating weekly schedule.\nAs explained above, both boys indicated a desire to primar-\nily reside with David, and David testified that allowing the\nboys to have a primary residence worked better for them and\nhas improved their behavior and grades. We therefore find no\nabuse of discretion in the parenting time schedule.\n\nChild Support Calculation.\n   Linda asserts that the district court erred in its calculation of\nchild support in two respects. First, she claims that the court’s\ncalculation of David’s income is incorrect because the court\nshould have utilized the parties’ 2012 joint tax return to deter-\nmine the income he earns from farming. In addition, Linda\nargues that the court improperly treated the adoption subsidy\nas income rather than using it to offset any child support obli-\ngation owed. We find no abuse of discretion in the calculation\nof David’s farming income. However, although we do not\nagree that the amount of child support owed should be offset\nby the adoption subsidy, we agree with Linda that the court’s\ntreatment of the subsidy as income was error.\n   [6,7] The paramount concern and question in determining\nchild support is the best interests of the child. See Incontro\nv. Jacobs, 277 Neb. 275, 761 N.W.2d 551 (2009). In gen-\neral, child support payments should be set according to the\nNebraska Child Support Guidelines, adopted by the Nebraska\nSupreme Court, which are presumed to be in the best interests\nof the child. See id.\n   [8,9] In calculating child support, the court must consider\nthe total monthly income, defined as income of both parties\nderived from all sources. Neb. Ct. R. § 4-204 (rev. 2016).\nThus, all income from employment must be included in the\n\f                               - 334 -\n          Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n               24 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                      BURCHAM v. BURCHAM\n                       Cite as 24 Neb. App. 323\n\ninitial calculation, which then becomes a rebuttable presump-\ntion of appropriate support. Noonan v. Noonan, 261 Neb. 552,\n624 N.W.2d 314 (2001).\n   In the present case, the district court calculated David’s\nmonthly income by utilizing the income he earns from the tele-\nphone company and adding $200 for farming income. Linda\nclaims that David’s farming income should have been estab-\nlished using the parties’ 2012 joint tax return, which indicated\nthe yearly farming income was $19,388.\n   [10,11] The Nebraska Child Support Guidelines provide\nthat copies of at least 2 years’ tax returns, financial statements,\nand current wage stubs should be furnished to the court for\npurposes of determining the parents’ income in order to calcu-\nlate child support. § 4-204. Nebraska courts have recognized\nthat income derived from farming is subject to fluctuations.\nSee, Gress v. Gress, 274 Neb. 686, 743 N.W.2d 67 (2007);\nPohlmann v. Pohlmann, 20 Neb. App. 290, 824 N.W.2d 63\n(2012); Willcock v. Willcock, 12 Neb. App. 422, 675 N.W.2d\n721 (2004). Thus, the use of income averaging when dealing\nwith farm income has been approved for purposes of calculat-\ning child support. Specifically, the Nebraska Child Support\nGuidelines provide that in the event of substantial fluctuations\nof annual earnings of either party during the immediate past 3\nyears, the income may be averaged to determine the percent\ncontribution of each parent. See Neb. Ct. R. ch. 4, art. 2, work-\nsheet 1, fn.5 (rev. 2015). In Gress v. Gress, supra, the Supreme\nCourt discussed at length the number of years that a court\nshould use when averaging income pursuant to the Nebraska\nChild Support Guidelines and concluded that a 3-year average\ntended to be the most common approach in cases where a par-\nent’s income fluctuates.\n   In the present case, however, the only evidence provided\nto establish David’s farming income was the 2012 tax return.\nLinda testified that their farming income fluctuated and that\nsome years it was higher than the earnings in 2012. The district\ncourt made a factual finding that the income David earned in\n\f                              - 335 -\n         Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n              24 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                     BURCHAM v. BURCHAM\n                      Cite as 24 Neb. App. 323\n\n2012 from farming did not accurately represent a “typical” year\nand, therefore, did not utilize that figure to calculate David’s\ntotal monthly income.\n   [12,13] In our de novo review of a judgment in marriage\ndissolution proceedings, when the evidence is in conflict, we\nconsider, and may give weight to, the fact that the trial judge\nheard and observed the witnesses and accepted one version of\nthe facts rather than another. See Catlett v. Catlett, 23 Neb.\nApp. 136, 869 N.W.2d 368 (2015). Thus, we give weight to\nthe fact that the district court found the 2012 tax return was\nnot an accurate representation of David’s farming income.\nUnfortunately, while there is no dispute that David earns some\namount of income from farming, the parties failed to elicit any\ntestimony which would allow the district court, and this court,\nto determine an appropriate or average income. Moreover,\nLinda did not request all exhibits offered and received at trial\nin her praecipe for the bill of exceptions; therefore, the record\non appeal does not contain all of the exhibits received into evi-\ndence at trial. We are unable to determine whether any exhibits\noffered and received at trial would support Linda’s argument\nthat the court should have used a higher farming income. As\na result of her failure to present a record which would support\nher argument, we can find no abuse of discretion. As a general\nproposition, it is incumbent upon the appellant to present a\nrecord supporting the errors assigned; absent such a record, an\nappellate court will affirm the lower court’s decision regarding\nthose errors. Centurion Stone of Neb. v. Whelan, 286 Neb. 150,\n835 N.W.2d 62 (2013). We therefore cannot find that the dis-\ntrict court abused its discretion in setting David’s farm income\nat $200 per month.\n   [14,15] Linda also asserts that the district court erred in\nconsidering the adoption subsidy as income for purposes of\ncalculating child support. She argues that the subsidy is similar\nin nature to the payment of a Social Security benefit and that\ntherefore, it should be considered an offset to any child support\nowed. At the outset, we recognize that although Linda now\n\f                               - 336 -\n          Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n               24 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                      BURCHAM v. BURCHAM\n                       Cite as 24 Neb. App. 323\n\nclaims the district court’s inclusion of the adoption subsidy\nas income was error, the proposed child support worksheet\nshe submitted to the court at trial also treated the subsidy as\nincome. Generally, a party cannot complain of error which the\nparty has invited the court to commit. McDonald v. McDonald,\n21 Neb. App. 535, 840 N.W.2d 573 (2013). However, parties\nin a proceeding to dissolve a marriage cannot control the dis-\nposition of matters pertaining to minor children by agreement,\nid., because the paramount concern and question in determin-\ning child support is the best interests of the child, see id. We\ntherefore address this argument in order to determine whether\nthe child support ordered is consistent with the best interests of\nthe children.\n   The issue of how adoption subsidies should be treated with\nregard to an award of child support is one of first impression in\nthis jurisdiction. Linda relies on Johnson v. Johnson, 290 Neb.\n838, 862 N.W.2d 740 (2015), to support her argument in favor\nof offsetting any child support obligation by the amount of the\nsubsidy. Her reliance on Johnson is misplaced, however. The\nchildren in Johnson received Social Security disability pay-\nments as a result of their father’s status as a retired taxpayer,\nand the issue on appeal was whether the father should have\nbeen given credit against his child support obligation for the\nSocial Security benefits which were paid to his children. The\nappeal was taken from a modification action, and the benefits\nhad not been disclosed to the court at the time of the divorce\nproceedings. Therefore, the Supreme Court affirmed the trial\ncourt’s treatment of the Social Security payments as a gratu-\nity and declined to give the father child support credit for the\nbenefits paid to his children.\n   This court has also addressed the treatment of Social Security\nbenefits. See Ward v. Ward, 7 Neb. App. 821, 585 N.W.2d 551\n(1998). In Ward, a child began receiving Social Security bene-\nfits after her mother passed away. The child’s father remarried,\nand his second wife adopted the child. When the father and his\nsecond wife divorced, at issue was whether the Social Security\n\f                               - 337 -\n          Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n               24 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                      BURCHAM v. BURCHAM\n                       Cite as 24 Neb. App. 323\n\npayments should offset some of the money each parent owed\nin child support. We held that the benefits should offset child\nsupport and reduced the amount of each parent’s obligation by\na proportion of the Social Security payment equal to that par-\nent’s share of the child support needs.\n   [16,17] In Johnson and Ward, the children were receiving\nSocial Security benefits as a result of their parents’ employ-\nment. The Supreme Court in Johnson observed that Social\nSecurity benefits in those instances are not a mere gratuity\nfrom the federal government but have been earned through the\nparent’s payment of Social Security taxes. The Supreme Court\nreiterated that a request to apply Social Security benefits to\na child support obligation in those circumstances is merely a\nrequest to identify the source of payment, and a Social Security\nbenefit can serve as a substitute source of income. See Johnson\nv. Johnson, supra.\n   The Supreme Court reached a different conclusion, however,\nin Gress v. Gress, 274 Neb. 686, 743 N.W.2d 67 (2007). There,\nthe parties’ youngest child received Social Security benefits\nas a result of having Down syndrome. When calculating the\nfather’s child support obligation, the trial court disregarded the\nSocial Security benefits, and the father challenged that decision\non appeal. In support of his argument that his child support\nobligation should be reduced in light of the Social Security\nbenefits, the father cited to Ward v. Ward, supra. The Supreme\nCourt found Ward distinguishable in part because of the basis\nfor the Social Security benefits, stating:\n      [I]t is well established that children with actual disabili-\n      ties like Down syndrome have special needs above and\n      beyond the needs of most children. All children have sup-\n      port needs, but special-needs children require additional\n      financial support to overcome developmental, cognitive,\n      or physiological problems. With this in mind, the federal\n      government provides Social Security to such children\n      with the intent that it will “supplement other income,\n      not substitute for it.” In contrast, the money allocated to\n\f                               - 338 -\n          Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n               24 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                      BURCHAM v. BURCHAM\n                       Cite as 24 Neb. App. 323\n\n      the youngest child under the [Nebraska Child Support\n      Guidelines] is meant to provide for the basic needs all\n      children have. To construe one source of money as sat-\n      isfying both needs would leave either his basic or his\n      special needs unfulfilled.\nGress v. Gress, 274 Neb. at 700, 743 N.W.2d at 79.\n   [18] The Gress court also recognized that unlike a child\nwith a disability, a child who loses a parent at a young age\ndoes not necessarily have special needs that will lead to\nincreased support costs, and in that context, Social Security\nbenefits are intended to account for the fact that the child has\nlost a source of support for his or her basic needs. The court\nfound that using Social Security benefits to offset a portion\nof child support costs is not necessarily a problem under the\ncircumstances presented by Ward, but it was not appropriate\nto offset child support costs where, as in Gress, the Social\nSecurity benefits are intended to mitigate the additional costs\nthat accompany disabilities. The Gress court therefore held\nthat the district court did not abuse its discretion when it disre-\ngarded the Social Security benefits for purposes of calculating\nchild support.\n   Stated another way, Social Security benefits paid to a child\nas a result of the disability or death of a parent are distinguish-\nable from those benefits paid as a result of the child’s disabil-\nity. Social Security benefits may be used to offset a parent’s\npayment of child support under the Nebraska Child Support\nGuidelines to provide for the child’s basic needs, because the\nbenefits are intended to replace the parent’s income source.\nHowever, Social Security benefits may not be used to offset a\nchild support obligation for a child with special needs, because\nthe benefits are intended to supplement the parent’s income\nand mitigate the increased costs associated with supporting a\nspecial needs child.\n   The question of whether the adoption subsidy in the present\ncase should offset Linda’s child support obligation is resolved\nby determining whether the subsidy constitutes a substitute for\n\f                               - 339 -\n          Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n               24 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                      BURCHAM v. BURCHAM\n                       Cite as 24 Neb. App. 323\n\nan income source or whether it is intended as a supplement to\nincome. Courts in other jurisdictions have concluded that the\npurpose of an adoption subsidy is to serve as a supplement to\nincome, not as a replacement for a parent’s income, and that\nthose payments therefore do not offset or otherwise serve as\na credit against a parent’s child support obligation. See, In\nre Marriage of Thomas, 49 Kan. App. 2d 952, 318 P.3d 672\n(2014); W.R. v. C.R., 75 So. 3d 159 (Ala. Civ. App. 2011);\nGambill v. Gambill, 137 P.3d 685 (Okla. Civ. App. 2006); In\nre Marriage of Bolding-Roberts, 113 P.3d 1265 (Colo. App.\n2005); Strandberg v. Strandberg, 664 N.W.2d 887 (Minn. App.\n2003); Hamblen v. Hamblen, 203 Ariz. 342, 54 P.3d 371 (Ariz.\nApp. 2002).\n   In the instant case, the children receive the adoption sub-\nsidy because of their special needs. Thus, the subsidy is not\nintended to replace a source of income in order to provide\nfor the children’s basic needs; rather, it is provided to allevi-\nate the additional costs of the children’s special needs. As the\nArizona Court of Appeals observed in Hamblen v. Hamblen,\nsupra, it would be inappropriate to adjust a child’s entitle-\nment to financial support because the government has elected\nto subsidize the increased financial commitment that a special\nneeds child imposes on the parents. The court further observed\nthat the subsidy is but an addition to a parent’s obligation of\nfinancial support and that if it were credited against the par-\nent’s child support obligation, it would, in effect, eliminate the\nsupplementary effect of the subsidy. Accordingly, Linda’s child\nsupport obligation should not be offset by the amount of the\nadoption subsidy.\n   We recognize, as David argues, that the Nebraska Child\nSupport Guidelines provide that in calculating the amount of\nsupport to be paid, the court must consider the total monthly\nincome, defined as the income of both parties derived from all\nsources, except all means-tested public assistance benefits. See\n§ 4-204. However, we do not agree that the adoption subsidy\nis considered income of the parents.\n\f                              - 340 -\n         Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n              24 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                     BURCHAM v. BURCHAM\n                      Cite as 24 Neb. App. 323\n\n   [19] Social Security disability benefits paid to a mother\nand her child as a result of the mother’s disability have been\nincluded in the mother’s income calculation because, as recog-\nnized above, such Social Security benefits are received in lieu\nof the parent’s income. See Hartman v. Hartman, 261 Neb.\n359, 622 N.W.2d 871 (2001). Other jurisdictions have deter-\nmined, however, that adoption subsidies should not be included\nin the calculation of the parents’ income for child support pur-\nposes because the subsidy is not income to the parent, rather\nit belongs to the child. See, Strandberg v. Strandberg, supra;\nHamblen v. Hamblen, supra; County of Ramsey v. Wilson,\n526 N.W.2d 384 (Minn. App. 1995); A.E. v. J.I.E., 179 Misc.\n2d 663, 686 N.Y.S.2d 613 (N.Y. Sup. 1999). In Hamblen, the\nArizona Court of Appeals observed that “the United States\nDepartment of Health and Human Services explicitly states in\nits Child Welfare Policy Manual” that “‘[f]oster and adoptive\nparents are not recipients of Federal foster care and adoption\nassistance payments; rather, foster care and adoption assistance\npayments are made on the child’s behalf to meet his or her\nneeds.’” 203 Ariz. at 345, 54 P.3d at 374.\n   As a result, we find that the district court erred in treating\nthe adoption subsidy as income for the purposes of calculat-\ning child support. We also reject Linda’s assertion that she is\nentitled to an offset of the child support obligation she owes\nto David, because the adoption subsidies are intended to assist\nLinda and David with the increased costs associated with rais-\ning children with special needs above and beyond the amount\nof basic support contemplated by the Nebraska Child Support\nGuidelines. We therefore reverse the child support calcula-\ntion and remand the cause with directions to the district court\nto recalculate child support excluding the adoption subsidy.\nBased on our affirmance of the custody award, David is enti-\ntled to the adoption subsidy for A.B. and Z.B., and Linda is\nentitled to the subsidy for H.B.\n   [20] Linda also assigns error with respect to the dependency\nexemptions the district court awarded, but she does not argue\n\f                               - 341 -\n          Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n               24 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                      BURCHAM v.

An alleged error must be both specifically assigned\nand specifically argued in the brief of the party asserting the\nerror to be considered by an appellate court. Cain v. Custer\nCty. Bd. of Equal., 291 Neb. 730, 868 N.W.2d 334 (2015). We\ntherefore do not address this argument.\n\nProperty Division.\n   Linda assigns error with respect to various aspects of\nthe district court’s classification, valuation, and division of\nthe parties’ property. We address her arguments individu-\nally below.\n   [21] Under Neb. Rev. Stat. § 42-365 (Reissue 2008), the\nequitable division of property is a three-step process. The first\nstep is to classify the parties’ property as marital or nonmarital.\nThe second step is to value the marital assets and marital liabil-\nities of the parties. The third step is to calculate and divide the\nnet marital estate between the parties in accordance with the\nprinciples contained in § 42-365. Plog v. Plog, 20 Neb. App.\n383, 824 N.W.2d 749 (2012).\n   [22,23] Linda first challenges the division of three retire-\nment accounts she claims were her premarital property. The\naccounts are individually identified on the joint property state-\nment. Property which one party brings into the marriage is\ngenerally excluded from the marital estate. Gress v. Gress,\n271 Neb. 122, 710 N.W.2d 318 (2006). The burden of proof to\nshow that property is nonmarital remains with the person mak-\ning the claim in a dissolution proceeding. Id.\n   Linda testified that the accounts were established prior to\nthe marriage and contained premarital funds. There was no\nevidence presented, however, as to whether she contributed\nany funds to the accounts during the marriage. Thus, we are\nunable to discern whether the balances of the accounts as of\nthe time the parties separated contained only premarital funds\nor a combination of marital and premarital funds. The district\ncourt apparently faced the same difficulty, stating in the decree\nthat because neither party made any clear record regarding\n\f                              - 342 -\n         Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n              24 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                     BURCHAM v. BURCHAM\n                      Cite as 24 Neb. App. 323\n\nthe premarital values of the retirement accounts, it divided the\naccounts equally between the parties. Therefore, Linda has not\nmet her burden of proving the funds are nonmarital, and we\nfind no merit to this argument.\n    Linda next challenges the district court’s decision to give\nDavid a credit of $21,000 for proceeds from the sale of his\npremarital home. She claims there was no evidence that he\nused any of those proceeds toward the marital home, and even\nif there were, she contributed to increasing the value of David’s\npremarital home.\n    The parties lived in David’s premarital home for the first\nfew years of their marriage. Linda testified that during that\ntime, they made minor repairs to the home such as painting,\nfixing a stairwell, repairing some plaster, and replacing some\ncarpet. Linda was asked whether her assistance in improving\nthe property had anything to do with the sale price of the home\nwhen it was sold, and she indicated that it did. The home was\nsold for $37,000 in 2003, and David testified that $21,000\nof the proceeds from the sale went directly into the marital\nresidence. Thus, we disagree with Linda’s contention that there\nwas no evidence presented to establish that any of the proceeds\nfrom the sale were put toward the marital residence.\n    [24] In the alternative, Linda argues that the court should\nhave applied the exception to the general principle set out in\nVan Newkirk v. Van Newkirk, 212 Neb. 730, 325 N.W.2d 832\n(1982). The Van Newkirk exception applies where both of the\nspouses have contributed to the improvement or operation of\nnonmarital property or where the spouse not owning the non-\nmarital property has significantly cared for the property during\nthe marriage. See Van Newkirk v. Van Newkirk, supra.\n    [25] When applying the Van Newkirk exception, evidence\nof the value of the contributions and evidence that the con-\ntributions were significant are generally required. Tyler v.\nTyler, 253 Neb. 209, 570 N.W.2d 317 (1997). In Tyler, the\nwife brought a home from a prior marriage into the marriage.\nThe husband and the wife lived in the wife’s house, sold it,\n\f                               - 343 -\n          Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n               24 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                      BURCHAM v. BURCHAM\n                       Cite as 24 Neb. App. 323\n\nand purchased another, and then another, and finally a fourth\nhome which became the focus of the appeal. This court, in a\nmemorandum opinion, modified the divorce decree to require\nthe wife to pay the husband half of the equity in the final home\nowned by the parties, and the Supreme Court reversed. The\nTyler court said that each time the Van Newkirk exception had\nbeen applied, the Supreme Court “has required evidence of the\nvalue of the contributions and evidence that the contributions\nwere significant.” 253 Neb. at 213, 570 N.W.2d at 320. The\ncourt in Tyler then recited an extensive list of items which the\nevidence suggested the husband did to the home to improve\nit, such as building a deck, carpeting and painting the family\nroom, replacing kitchen countertops, and installing four ceil-\ning fans. However, the Tyler court observed that the husband\nfailed to produce any evidence indicating the value of these\ncontributions and that he failed to demonstrate “the signifi-\ncance of the aforementioned contributions.” 253 Neb. at 214,\n570 N.W.2d at 320.\n    In the present case, based on our de novo review of the\nrecord, we find that Linda failed to establish the monetary\nvalue of her contributions to the home and demonstrate that her\ncontributions were significant. Even if Linda’s work improved\nthe home’s value, she failed to attribute the increase in value to\nsubstantial contributions she made because she did not do the\nwork alone. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court\ndid not abuse its discretion in awarding David a $21,000 credit\nfor his premarital property.\n    Linda next asserts that the district court erred in failing to\nclassify livestock included on the joint property statement as\na marital asset. The joint property statement lists eight feeder\ncalves and eight pairs of cows and calves; David indicated\nthat neither he nor Linda was the owner of the cows, whereas\nLinda assigned a total value to them of $28,800. At trial,\nDavid’s mother was asked about the cows and calves listed\non the property statement, and she testified that she and her\nhusband owned them as of November 2013. David confirmed\n\f                               - 344 -\n          Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n               24 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                      BURCHAM v. BURCHAM\n                       Cite as 24 Neb. App. 323\n\nhis mother’s testimony that his parents owned that particu-\nlar livestock.\n   Linda notes that the parties claimed five stock cows on their\n2012 joint tax return; through October 2012, she and David\ninsured $14,000 worth of stock cows; and as of June 2013,\nthey insured six head of stock cows and six head of stock\ncalves. Thus, she argues, they clearly have cattle as marital\nassets, and the court should have entered a value of $28,800\nand assigned the value to David.\n   We understand Linda’s argument that at least as late as\nJune 2013, the parties themselves acknowledged through their\ninsurance policy that they owned cattle. However, there was no\nevidence offered at trial that as of the date of separation, the\ncows and calves listed on the property statement belonged to\nLinda and David, particularly when the only testimony at trial\nwas from David and his mother that the parties were not the\nowners of the livestock listed on the property statement. We\ntherefore cannot find that the district court abused its discretion\nin failing to classify the livestock as a marital asset.\n   Next, Linda contends that the district court erred in clas-\nsifying and valuing a savings account held at a credit union.\nThe court placed a value of $7,850 on the account, classified\nit as a marital asset, and awarded it to Linda. Linda claims\nthe account was her premarital property and had a balance of\nonly “$0.07” at the time of separation. Brief for appellant at\n34. She asserts that “David’s own Exhibit 52 confirms that\nthe account [should be] valued at $0.07.” Id. However, exhibit\n52 is not contained in our record on appeal, so we are unable\nto verify Linda’s claim. We also note that David testified\nthat the first date of business for the account was in January\n2013, testimony which appears to refute Linda’s claim that\nshe owned the account prior to the marriage. Further, on\nthe parties’ joint property statement David placed a value of\n$7,850 on the savings account, a value which was accepted\nby the district court. Again, we reiterate that it is Linda’s\nburden, as the appellant, to supply a record that supports her\n\f                               - 345 -\n          Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n               24 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                      BURCHAM v.

Because of her decision\nto request only certain exhibits in her praecipe for the bill of\nexceptions, we cannot find on the record before us that the\ndistrict court’s valuation and classification of the account was\nan abuse of discretion.\n   Finally, Linda asserts two claims with respect to the marital\nresidence. She first argues that the court’s valuation of the\nproperty was erroneous. The district court accepted David’s\nvalue of $129,980 for the home and found that David was\nentitled to a credit of $21,000 for his premarital contribution;\nthus, the court’s final valuation of the residence was $108,980.\nLinda claims the correct value was $330,000, a sum which\nincludes the residence, the 45 acres of land upon which the\nhome sits, and the other structures on the land. The court,\nhowever, determined that the 45 acres of land was David’s\npremarital property because he purchased it prior to the mar-\nriage. Thus, the question is whether the district court prop-\nerly classified the 45 acres of land as premarital property or\nwhether the true value of the marital residence should include\nthe value of the land as well.\n   [26-30] Generally, all property accumulated and acquired\nby either spouse during a marriage is part of the marital\nestate. Brozek v. Brozek, 292 Neb. 681, 874 N.W.2d 17 (2016).\nExceptions include property that a spouse acquired before the\nmarriage, or by gift or inheritance. Id. Setting aside nonmarital\nproperty is simple if the spouse possesses the original asset,\nbut can be problematic if the original asset no longer exists. Id.\nSeparate property becomes marital property by commingling\nif it is inextricably mixed with marital property or with the\nseparate property of the other spouse. Id. If the separate prop-\nerty remains segregated or is traceable into its product, com-\nmingling does not occur. Id. The burden of proof rests with the\nparty claiming that property is nonmarital. Id.\n   The parties agree that David purchased the land in 1996,\nwhich was prior to the marriage, and the land retained its\n\f                              - 346 -\n         Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n              24 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                     BURCHAM v. BURCHAM\n                      Cite as 24 Neb. App. 323\n\noriginal form when the parties separated. David secured a loan\nto fund the purchase and continued to make payments on the\nloan until 2003. David testified that he applied $16,000 of\nproceeds from the sale of his premarital residence to pay off\nthe loan on the land. To the contrary, Linda testified that the\nremaining balance on the loan was wrapped into the mortgage\nthey secured on the marital residence. The trial court appar-\nently found David’s testimony more credible than Linda’s,\na finding to which we afford weight in our de novo review.\nSee Catlett v. Catlett, 23 Neb. App. 136, 869 N.W.2d 368\n(2015). Thus, David met his burden of proving the property\nwas nonmarital.\n   There is some evidence establishing that David used marital\nfunds between 2001 and 2003 to make the loan payments for\nthe land. However, there was no evidence as to the amount\nof money used, and therefore, we cannot find that the district\ncourt abused its discretion in classifying the 45 acres of land\nas David’s premarital property. Accordingly, the proper value\nof the marital residence includes the home only, and not the\nland upon which it sits.\n   Linda also claims that the court erred in dividing the resi-\ndence’s unpaid property taxes from 2012 and 2013 equally\nbetween the parties. She argues that as of December 10, 2013,\nthe parties stipulated that David have “exclusive use” of the\nmarital residence, and thus, he was obligated to pay the costs\nassociated with maintaining the residence. Brief for appel-\nlant at 36. Despite Linda’s claim, the temporary stipulation\nsigned by the parties provided that Linda receive exclusive\nuse of the parties’ residence from December 9, 2013, at 7\np.m. until April 1, 2014, or such time she notified David oth-\nerwise. The evidence reveals, however, that Linda chose not\nto reside there after being granted exclusive possession due to\nsafety concerns.\n   [31] Regardless, the property taxes for 2012 and 2013\nwere incurred during the marriage, and Linda resided in the\nhouse during 2012 and the majority of 2013. Marital debt is\n\f                               - 347 -\n          Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n               24 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                      BURCHAM v. BURCHAM\n                       Cite as 24 Neb. App. 323\n\ndefined as a debt incurred during the marriage and before the\ndate of separation, by either spouse or both spouses, for the\njoint benefit of the parties. Finley-Swanson v. Swanson, 20\nNeb. App. 316, 823 N.W.2d 697 (2012). The parties remained\ntogether and lived jointly in the home until separating in the\nfall of 2013. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in\nthe court’s treatment of the tax obligation as a marital debt and\ndividing it equally between the parties.\n   Finally, Linda asks that we order the marital residence\nto be sold and the proceeds split between the parties. We\ndecline to do so. The district court properly classified the resi-\ndence as marital property and awarded it to David. We have\nrejected all of Linda’s arguments as to the court’s division\nof property either because we find the district court’s deci-\nsion was not an abuse of discretion or because she failed to\nproduce a record sufficient for our review to support her argu-\nments. Accordingly, we affirm the classification, valuation,\nand division of property, including the equalization payment,\nin its entirety.\n\nAttorney Fees.\n   [32,33] Linda argues that the district court erred in fail-\ning to award her attorney fees. In a dissolution of marriage\ncase, an award of attorney fees is discretionary, is reviewed\nde novo on the record, and will be affirmed in the absence\nof an abuse of discretion. Brunges v. Brunges, 260 Neb. 660,\n619 N.W.2d 456 (2000). The award of attorney fees depends\non multiple factors that include the nature of the case, the\nservices performed and results obtained, the earning capacity\nof the parties, the length of time required for preparation and\npresentation of the case, customary charges of the bar, and\ngeneral equities of the case. Sitz v. Sitz, 275 Neb. 832, 749\nN.W.2d 470 (2008).\n   [34] Linda requested that her attorney fees of $20,000 be\nconsidered a marital liability and considered as a reduction\nin the amount of net marital assets awarded to her. As noted\n\f                               - 348 -\n          Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n               24 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                      BURCHAM v. BURCHAM\n                       Cite as 24 Neb. App. 323\n\nabove, a marital debt is one incurred during the marriage and\nbefore the date of separation for the joint benefit of the parties.\nSee Finley-Swanson v. Swanson, supra. In Finley-Swanson, we\nheld that the attorney fees incurred by the parties during the\npendency of the dissolution proceedings did not constitute a\nmarital debt because they were incurred after the parties were\nestranged and the wife filed the complaint for dissolution of\nmarriage and that thus, they were clearly not for the parties’\njoint benefit.\n   The same is true in the present case. The attorney fees Linda\nowes were incurred after she and David had separated and\nwere not for their joint benefit. Therefore, they were properly\ntreated as Linda’s separate obligation.\n   In our de novo review, we have considered the general\nequities of the case as well as the other relevant factors. This\ncase involved multiple contested issues, including custody of\nA.B. and Z.B., child support, alimony, and property division.\nLinda asserts that she incurred additional fees as a direct result\nof David’s actions, but the district court found, and we agree,\nthat it appears “both of the parties litigated the issues with a\nhigh degree of contentiousness.” We therefore find no abuse\nof discretion in denying Linda’s request for attorney fees and\nordering each party to pay its respective fees.\n                        CONCLUSION\n   We conclude that the district court erred in treating the\nadoption subsidy as income for the purposes of calculating\nchild support. We therefore reverse that portion of the decree\nand remand the cause with directions to the district court to\nrecalculate child support without considering the adoption sub-\nsidy. The decree is otherwise affirmed.\n\tA ffirmed in part, and in part reversed\n\t                     and remanded with directions.\n\f",

No. A-15-814.\n\n                1.\t Divorce: Child Custody. When custody of minor children is an issue in\n                     a proceeding to dissolve the marriage of the children’s parents, custody\n                     is determined by parental fitness and the children’s best interests.\n                2.\t Child Custody. When both parents are found to be fit, the inquiry for\n                     the court on the issue of custody is the best interests of the children.\n                3.\t Parent and Child. The best interests of a child require a parent-\n                     ing arrangement for a child’s safety, emotional growth, health, stabil-\n                     ity, and physical care and regular and continuous school attendance\n                     and progress.\n                 4.\t ____. The best interests of a child also require that the child’s families\n                     and those serving in parenting roles remain appropriately active and\n                     involved in parenting with safe, appropriate, continuing quality contact\n                     between children and their families when they have shown the ability to\n                     act in the best interests of the child and have shared in the responsibili-\n                     ties of raising the child.\n                5.\t Divorce: Child Custody: Public Policy. It is sound public policy to\n                     keep children together when possible, but considerations of public\n                     policy do not, in all cases, prevent the splitting of the custody of the\n                     children when a marriage is dissolved; rather, the ultimate standard is\n                     the best interests of the children.\n                6.\t Child Support. The paramount concern and question in determining\n                     child support is the best interests of the child.\n                7.\t Rules of the Supreme Court: Child Support: Presumptions.

All income from employment must be\n     included in the initial child support calculation, which then becomes a\n     rebuttable presumption of appropriate support.\n10.\t Child Support.

In a de novo review of a judgment in\n     marriage dissolution proceedings, when the evidence is in conflict, an\n     appellate court considers, and may give weight to, the fact that the trial\n     judge heard and observed the witnesses and accepted one version of the\n     facts rather than another.\n13.\t Records: Appeal and Error. It is incumbent upon the appellant to\n     present a record supporting the errors assigned; absent such a record,\n     an appellate court will affirm the lower court’s decision regarding\n     those errors.\n14.\t Appeal and Error. Generally, a party cannot complain of error which\n     the party has invited the court to commit.\n15.\t Divorce: Minors: Stipulations.

A request to apply\n     Social Security benefits received as a result of a parent’s employment to\n     the parent’s child support obligation is merely a request to identify the\n     source of payment, and a Social Security benefit can serve as a substi-\n     tute source of income.\n18.\t ____: ____: ____. Social Security benefits received on behalf of a\n     parent’s employment may be used to offset a portion of child support\n     costs, but it is not appropriate to offset child support costs where the\n     Social Security benefits are received due to the disability of the child\n     and therefore intended to mitigate the additional costs accompany-\n     ing disabilities.\n19.\t ____: ____: ____.

Under Neb. Rev. Stat. § 42-365 (Reissue\n     2008), the equitable division of property is a three-step process. The\n     first step is to classify the parties’ property as marital or nonmarital.\n     The second step is to value the marital assets and marital liabilities\n     of the parties.

David worked at a\ntelephone company throughout the marriage and earned addi-\ntional income from farming. Linda worked full time during\nthe marriage until reducing her schedule to 80 percent after\nthe children were adopted. During that time, she was primarily\nresponsible for the care of the children. After nearly 8 years,\nshe resumed full-time employment.\n   All three of the children have special needs.

See Neb. Ct. R. ch. 4, art. 2, work-\nsheet 1, fn.5 (rev. 2015). In Gress v. Gress, supra, the Supreme\nCourt discussed at length the number of years that a court\nshould use when averaging income pursuant to the Nebraska\nChild Support Guidelines and concluded that a 3-year average\ntended to be the most common approach in cases where a par-\nent’s income fluctuates.\n   In the present case, however, the only evidence provided\nto establish David’s farming income was the 2012 tax return.\nLinda testified that their farming income fluctuated and that\nsome years it was higher than the earnings in 2012.

The\nappeal was taken from a modification action, and the benefits\nhad not been disclosed to the court at the time of the divorce\nproceedings. Therefore, the Supreme Court affirmed the trial\ncourt’s treatment of the Social Security payments as a gratu-\nity and declined to give the father child support credit for the\nbenefits paid to his children.\n   This court has also addressed the treatment of Social Security\nbenefits.

We held that the benefits should offset child\nsupport and reduced the amount of each parent’s obligation by\na proportion of the Social Security payment equal to that par-\nent’s share of the child support needs.\n   [16,17] In Johnson and Ward, the children were receiving\nSocial Security benefits as a result of their parents’ employ-\nment. The Supreme Court in Johnson observed that Social\nSecurity benefits in those instances are not a mere gratuity\nfrom the federal government but have been earned through the\nparent’s payment of Social Security taxes. The Supreme Court\nreiterated that a request to apply Social Security benefits to\na child support obligation in those circumstances is merely a\nrequest to identify the source of payment, and a Social Security\nbenefit can serve as a substitute source of income. See Johnson\nv. Johnson, supra.\n   The Supreme Court reached a different conclusion, however,\nin Gress v.

There,\nthe parties’ youngest child received Social Security benefits\nas a result of having Down syndrome.

In support of his argument that his child support\nobligation should be reduced in light of the Social Security\nbenefits, the father cited to Ward v. Ward, supra. The Supreme\nCourt found Ward distinguishable in part because of the basis\nfor the Social Security benefits, stating:\n      [I]t is well established that children with actual disabili-\n      ties like Down syndrome have special needs above and\n      beyond the needs of most children.

Gress, 274 Neb. at 700, 743 N.W.2d at 79.\n   [18] The Gress court also recognized that unlike a child\nwith a disability, a child who loses a parent at a young age\ndoes not necessarily have special needs that will lead to\nincreased support costs, and in that context, Social Security\nbenefits are intended to account for the fact that the child has\nlost a source of support for his or her basic needs. The court\nfound that using Social Security benefits to offset a portion\nof child support costs is not necessarily a problem under the\ncircumstances presented by Ward, but it was not appropriate\nto offset child support costs where, as in Gress, the Social\nSecurity benefits are intended to mitigate the additional costs\nthat accompany disabilities. The Gress court therefore held\nthat the district court did not abuse its discretion when it disre-\ngarded the Social Security benefits for purposes of calculating\nchild support.\n   Stated another way, Social Security benefits paid to a child\nas a result of the disability or death of a parent are distinguish-\nable from those benefits paid as a result of the child’s disabil-\nity. Social Security benefits may be used to offset a parent’s\npayment of child support under the Nebraska Child Support\nGuidelines to provide for the child’s basic needs, because the\nbenefits are intended to replace the parent’s income source.\nHowever, Social Security benefits may not be used to offset a\nchild support obligation for a child with special needs, because\nthe benefits are intended to supplement the parent’s income\nand mitigate the increased costs associated with supporting a\nspecial needs child.\n   The question of whether the adoption subsidy in the present\ncase should offset Linda’s child support obligation is resolved\nby determining whether the subsidy constitutes a substitute for\n\f                               - 339 -\n          Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n               24 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                      BURCHAM v.

Thus, the subsidy is not\nintended to replace a source of income in order to provide\nfor the children’s basic needs; rather, it is provided to allevi-\nate the additional costs of the children’s special needs. As the\nArizona Court of Appeals observed in Hamblen v. Hamblen,\nsupra, it would be inappropriate to adjust a child’s entitle-\nment to financial support because the government has elected\nto subsidize the increased financial commitment that a special\nneeds child imposes on the parents. The court further observed\nthat the subsidy is but an addition to a parent’s obligation of\nfinancial support and that if it were credited against the par-\nent’s child support obligation, it would, in effect, eliminate the\nsupplementary effect of the subsidy. Accordingly, Linda’s child\nsupport obligation should not be offset by the amount of the\nadoption subsidy.\n   We recognize, as David argues, that the Nebraska Child\nSupport Guidelines provide that in calculating the amount of\nsupport to be paid, the court must consider the total monthly\nincome, defined as the income of both parties derived from all\nsources, except all means-tested public assistance benefits.

This court, in a\nmemorandum opinion, modified the divorce decree to require\nthe wife to pay the husband half of the equity in the final home\nowned by the parties, and the Supreme Court reversed. The\nTyler court said that each time the Van Newkirk exception had\nbeen applied, the Supreme Court “has required evidence of the\nvalue of the contributions and evidence that the contributions\nwere significant.” 253 Neb. at 213, 570 N.W.2d at 320. The\ncourt in Tyler then recited an extensive list of items which the\nevidence suggested the husband did to the home to improve\nit, such as building a deck, carpeting and painting the family\nroom, replacing kitchen countertops, and installing four ceil-\ning fans. However, the Tyler court observed that the husband\nfailed to produce any evidence indicating the value of these\ncontributions and that he failed to demonstrate “the signifi-\ncance of the aforementioned contributions.” 253 Neb. at 214,\n570 N.W.2d at 320.\n    In the present case, based on our de novo review of the\nrecord, we find that Linda failed to establish the monetary\nvalue of her contributions to the home and demonstrate that her\ncontributions were significant. Even if Linda’s work improved\nthe home’s value, she failed to attribute the increase in value to\nsubstantial contributions she made because she did not do the\nwork alone. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court\ndid not abuse its discretion in awarding David a $21,000 credit\nfor his premarital property.\n    Linda next asserts that the district court erred in failing to\nclassify livestock included on the joint property statement as\na marital asset. The joint property statement lists eight feeder\ncalves and eight pairs of cows and calves; David indicated\nthat neither he nor Linda was the owner of the cows, whereas\nLinda assigned a total value to them of $28,800. At trial,\nDavid’s mother was asked about the cows and calves listed\non the property statement, and she testified that she and her\nhusband owned them as of November 2013.

Thus, she argues, they clearly have cattle as marital\nassets, and the court should have entered a value of $28,800\nand assigned the value to David.\n   We understand Linda’s argument that at least as late as\nJune 2013, the parties themselves acknowledged through their\ninsurance policy that they owned cattle. However, there was no\nevidence offered at trial that as of the date of separation, the\ncows and calves listed on the property statement belonged to\nLinda and David, particularly when the only testimony at trial\nwas from David and his mother that the parties were not the\nowners of the livestock listed on the property statement. We\ntherefore cannot find that the district court abused its discretion\nin failing to classify the livestock as a marital asset.\n   Next, Linda contends that the district court erred in clas-\nsifying and valuing a savings account held at a credit union.\nThe court placed a value of $7,850 on the account, classified\nit as a marital asset, and awarded it to Linda. Linda claims\nthe account was her premarital property and had a balance of\nonly “$0.07” at the time of separation. Brief for appellant at\n34. She asserts that “David’s own Exhibit 52 confirms that\nthe account [should be] valued at $0.07.” Id. However, exhibit\n52 is not contained in our record on appeal, so we are unable\nto verify Linda’s claim. We also note that David testified\nthat the first date of business for the account was in January\n2013, testimony which appears to refute Linda’s claim that\nshe owned the account prior to the marriage. Further, on\nthe parties’ joint property statement David placed a value of\n$7,850 on the savings account, a value which was accepted\nby the district court. Again, we reiterate that it is Linda’s\nburden, as the appellant, to supply a record that supports her\n\f                               - 345 -\n          Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n               24 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                      BURCHAM v.

Because of her decision\nto request only certain exhibits in her praecipe for the bill of\nexceptions, we cannot find on the record before us that the\ndistrict court’s valuation and classification of the account was\nan abuse of discretion.\n   Finally, Linda asserts two claims with respect to the marital\nresidence. She first argues that the court’s valuation of the\nproperty was erroneous. The district court accepted David’s\nvalue of $129,980 for the home and found that David was\nentitled to a credit of $21,000 for his premarital contribution;\nthus, the court’s final valuation of the residence was $108,980.\nLinda claims the correct value was $330,000, a sum which\nincludes the residence, the 45 acres of land upon which the\nhome sits, and the other structures on the land. The court,\nhowever, determined that the 45 acres of land was David’s\npremarital property because he purchased it prior to the mar-\nriage. Thus, the question is whether the district court prop-\nerly classified the 45 acres of land as premarital property or\nwhether the true value of the marital residence should include\nthe value of the land as well.\n   [26-30] Generally, all property accumulated and acquired\nby either spouse during a marriage is part of the marital\nestate.

Thus, David met his burden of proving the property\nwas nonmarital.\n   There is some evidence establishing that David used marital\nfunds between 2001 and 2003 to make the loan payments for\nthe land. However, there was no evidence as to the amount\nof money used, and therefore, we cannot find that the district\ncourt abused its discretion in classifying the 45 acres of land\nas David’s premarital property. Accordingly, the proper value\nof the marital residence includes the home only, and not the\nland upon which it sits.\n   Linda also claims that the court erred in dividing the resi-\ndence’s unpaid property taxes from 2012 and 2013 equally\nbetween the parties. She argues that as of December 10, 2013,\nthe parties stipulated that David have “exclusive use” of the\nmarital residence, and thus, he was obligated to pay the costs\nassociated with maintaining the residence.

We have\nrejected all of Linda’s arguments as to the court’s division\nof property either because we find the district court’s deci-\nsion was not an abuse of discretion or because she failed to\nproduce a record sufficient for our review to support her argu-\nments.

The attorney fees Linda\nowes were incurred after she and David had separated and\nwere not for their joint benefit. Therefore, they were properly\ntreated as Linda’s separate obligation.\n   In our de novo review, we have considered the general\nequities of the case as well as the other relevant factors.
