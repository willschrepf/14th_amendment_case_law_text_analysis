At issue is the Newark\nSchool District’s proposed individual education plan for I.H.\nfor the 1999-2000 school year, which returned her to in-\ndistrict placement. I.H. and her mother, S.H., prevailed in\ntheir due process hearing at the state administrative level,\nwherein the Administrative Law Judge concluded that the\nSchool District failed to meet its burden in proving that the\nchange in placement would provide a meaningful\neducational benefit. After S.H. sought attorneys’ fees in\nfederal District Court, the School District counterclaimed\nchallenging the administrative decision. The District Court\nreversed the administrative decision. Central to this case is\nthe appropriate standard of review a District Court should\nemploy when reviewing state administrative proceedings\nunder the Individuals with Disabilities Act. We hold that\nthe appropriate standard is modified de novo review.\nBecause the District Court did not apply the correct\nstandard of review, we will reverse.\n\n                      I.   Background\n\n         A.   The Individuals with Disabilities Act\n  This case arises under a confluence of state and federal\ndisabilities law. Therefore, it is useful to review the\nstatutory framework before proceeding to the facts. Federal\nfunding of state special education programs is contingent\non the states providing a “free and appropriate education”\n\f                               3\n\n\nto all disabled children. 20 U.S.C. §1412. The Individuals\nwith Disabilities Act (IDEA) is the vehicle Congress has\nchosen to ensure that states follow this mandate. 20 U.S.C.\n§1400 et seq. “A free, appropriate public education consists\nof educational instruction specially designed to meet the\nunique needs of the handicapped child, supported by such\nservices as are necessary to permit the child to ‘benefit’\nfrom the instruction.” Susan N. v. Wilson Sch. Dist., 70 F.3d\n751, 756 (3d Cir. 1995) (citations omitted).\n   As we noted in Susan N., an Individual Education\nProgram (IEP) is the primary vehicle for providing students\nwith the required free and appropriate education. Id. An\nIEP is a written statement developed for each child that\nmust include several elements. 20 U.S.C. § 1414(1)(A). It\nmust include a statement of the child’s current level of\nperformance, and how her disability affects her\nperformance. Id. at (1)(A)(I). It must set measurable annual\ngoals relating both to progress in the general curriculum\nand additional educational needs arising from her\ndisability. Id. at (1)(A)(ii). The IEP must detail those special\neducation services and supplementary aids that the school\nwill provide, explain how they will contribute toward\nmeeting the annual goals, how they will allow the child to\nprogress in both the general curriculum and participate in\nextracurricular activities, and describe how the child will\ninteract with disabled and nondisabled children. Id. at\n(1)(A)(iii). In measuring the child’s progress, the IEP must\nexplain whether standard student assessments will be\nused. If not, the IEP must explain why not and how the\nschool will assess the child. Id. at (1)(A)(v).\n  Besides setting out the required content of an IEP, the\nIDEA explains how the school is to develop an IEP. An IEP\nteam meets and writes the IEP considering the strengths of\nthe child, the concerns of the parent, and the most recent\nevaluation of the child. Id. at (3). As to hearing impaired\nchildren, the IEP team is to:\n    (iv) consider the communication needs of the child,\n    and in the case of a child who is deaf or hard of\n    hearing,   consider   the   child’s  language    and\n    communication     needs,  opportunities  for   direct\n    communications with peers and professional personnel\n\f                                   4\n\n\n     in the child’s language and communication mode,\n     academic level, and full range of needs, including\n     opportunities for direct instruction in the child’s\n     language and communication mode; and\n     (v) consider whether the child               requires   assistive\n     technology devices and services.\nId. The IEP team is to be composed of the child’s parents,\nat least one special education teacher of the child, a\nspecialist in developing curriculum from the local district,\nand at the request of the parent or the school district,\nanyone with special knowledge or expertise related to the\nchild’s education. Id. at (1)(B).\n   In addition to the general requirements set out in the\nIDEA,    state    and   federal    regulations  detail   the\nimplementation of the statute. See, e.g., 34 C.F.R.\n§ 300.340-300.350 (setting out requirements for IEP);\nN.J.A.C.    § 6A:14-1.3   (defining   IEP).   New    Jersey’s\nrequirements for developing an IEP follow the federal\nrequirements. Fuhrmann v. East Hanover Bd. Educ., 993\nF.2d 1031, 1035 (3d Cir. 1993). The regulations require a\nchild study team (CST) evaluate the child. The members of\nthe CST are a school psychologist, a learning disabilities\nteacher-consultant, and a school social worker. N.J.A.C.\n§ 6A:14-3.1. The CST, parents, a teacher familiar with the\nstudent, and other appropriate personnel then meet.\nN.J.A.C. § 6A:14-2.3. Members from this group then work\ntogether to formulate, review, or revise the child’s IEP. 34\nC.F.R. § 300.344-300.345; N.J.A.C. § 6A:14-2.3.\n  The IEP team is required to review the IEP at least\nannually to determine whether the child is reaching the\nstated goals. In addition, the IEP team is to revise the IEP\nto address lack of progress, necessary changes arising from\nreevaluation of the child, and parental input, among other\nthings. 20 U.S.C. § 1414(1)(A)(4).\n  In addition, the IDEA includes a mainstreaming\ncomponent in its description of a free and appropriate\neducation, requiring education in the least restrictive\nenvironment. See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A).1 We have\n\n1. The IDEA describes “least restrictive environment” as:\n    In general. To the maximum extent appropriate, children with\n\f                                   5\n\n\ninterpreted this mainstreaming requirement as mandating\neducation “in the least restrictive environment that will\nprovide [her] with a meaningful educational benefit.” T.R. v.\nKingwood Township Bd. Educ., 205 F.3d 572, 578 (3d Cir.\n2000). “The least restrictive environment is the one that, to\nthe greatest extent possible, satisfactorily educates disabled\nchildren together with children who are not disabled, in the\nsame school the disabled child would attend if the child\nwere not disabled.” Carlisle Area Sch. v. Scott P., 62 F.3d\n520, 535 (3d Cir. 1995).\n  The issue here is not whether I.H. should receive special\neducation, nor is it whether the School District afforded her\ndue process. Rather, the only issue is whether the School\nDistrict’s proposed IEP, changing I.H.’s placement, would\nprovide her a meaningful educational benefit. Ridgewood,\n172 F.3d at 247.\n\n                      B.     Factual Background\n  The Appellant, S.H., brings this appeal individually and\non behalf of her daughter I.H. I.H. has severe to profound\nsensorineural hearing loss. When she was two years old,\nthe Newark Public School District identified I.H. as eligible\nfor its preschool handicapped program. After determining\nthat there was no suitable program in I.H.’s home School\nDistrict, the School District placed I.H. at the Lake Drive\nSchool for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children. I.H. began\nattending Lake Drive School in the summer of 1997 when\nshe was three years old.\n  The Lake Drive School is a public school outside the\nNewark School District. In justifying this placement, the\n\n    disabilities, including children in public or private institutions or\n    other care facilities, are educated with children who are not\n    disabled, and special classes, separate schooling, or other removal\n    of children with disabilities from the regular educational\n    environment occurs only when the nature or severity of the\n    disability of a child is such that education in regular classes with\n    the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved\n    satisfactorily.\n20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A).\n\f                             6\n\n\nSchool District noted that I.H. required a special program\nunavailable in her home district. Specifically, she required\na small, specialized, and highly structured education\nprogram tailored to her functioning levels, hearing\nimpairment, and specific sensory deficit. This program\nwould provide “developmentally appropriate curriculum,\nteachers specialized in working with hearing-impaired\nchildren, presentation of auditory training, sensory\nutilization skills and facilitation of communication\nskills.” S.H. v. Newark Bd. Educ., No. EDS7639-99, at 3\n¶1 (N.J. OAL, Oct. 4, 1999) available at http://\nlawlibrary.rutgers.edu/oal/word/initial/eds7639-99-1.doc\n  The School District developed a new IEP the next year,\nrevisiting I.H.’s placement. This IEP specified placement at\nthe Bruce Street School for the Deaf in Newark beginning in\nSeptember 1998. The Bruce Street School is a self-\ncontained school for the deaf placed within a larger school,\nthe George Washington Carver School. This is the\nneighborhood school that I.H. would have attended if she\nhad not been hearing impaired. The Bruce Street School\nwas available for I.H.’s initial placement in 1997, and the\nSchool District explains neither why it was not appropriate\nfor the initial placement, nor what changed in the interim\nmaking it appropriate.\n  S.H. challenged the School District’s change in I.H.’s\nplacement. Following mediation, I.H. was allowed to remain\nat the Lake Drive School. As a result, I.H. attended the\nLake Drive School preschool handicapped program from\n1997 to 1999. An interim IEP developed in January 1999\nalso resulted in I.H.’s continuing placement at Lake Drive\nSchool. The Lake Drive School’s evaluations of I.H.\nconducted in January 1999 concluded that she should\nremain in the school for summer school and the 1999-2000\nschool year.\n  In the spring of 1999, the School District reevaluated I.H.\nto decide the appropriate placement for the 1999-2000\nschool year, the year she would start kindergarten. In this\nJune 1999 proposed IEP, the School District found that the\nleast restrictive environment for I.H. was the Bruce Street\nSchool for the Deaf. In finding that it was the least\nrestrictive environment, the School District noted that\n\f                                7\n\n\nBruce Street School is near I.H.’s home, and differs from\nLake Drive in that I.H. could have interaction with\nnonhandicapped children between classes (e.g., lunch and\nrecess). Because she wanted I.H. to continue attending\nschool at Lake Drive, where the District initially placed I.H.,\nS.H. requested a due process hearing challenging I.H.’s\nplacement for the 1999-2000 school year.\n\n                   C.    Procedural History\n\n                        1.   ALJ Decision\n   New Jersey’s process for resolving disputes arising in\nspecial education cases starts with mediation. N.J.A.C.\n§ 1:6A-4.1. If mediation fails, the case is forwarded to the\nOffice of Administrative Law and assigned to an\nAdministrative Law Judge (ALJ). After the hearing, the ALJ\nhas forty-five days to issue his decision. There is no\nadditional review under New Jersey’s administrative\nsystem, and the case can be directly appealed to New\nJersey superior court or federal district court. N.J.C.A.\n§ 1:6A-18.1-18.3.\n   At the administrative hearing, S.H. sought to have I.H.’s\nplacement continue at the Lake Drive School for the 1999-\n2000 school year. The ALJ held hearings for three days,\nreceived evidence from both the School District and S.H.,\nand heard testimony from several witnesses for both\nparties. In his opinion, the ALJ made extensive factual\nfindings. The ALJ had before him multiple evaluations of\nI.H, including Lake Drive School’s annual review prepared\nin January, and the School District’s June proposed IEP.\nThe ALJ made his factual findings based on these reports,\nin addition to other documentary evidence, and the\ntestimony of several witnesses.\n  The primary witness for S.H. was Dr. Laura McKirdy, the\nprincipal at Lake Drive School. Besides being principal of\nLake Drive since 1978, Dr. McKirdy is a speech language\npathologist and developmental psychologist, and is a\ncertified elementary school teacher. The ALJ accepted Dr.\nMcKirdy as an expert on deaf education based on her\ntraining, education, and experience. The ALJ heavily relied\n\f                             8\n\n\non the testimony of Dr. McKirdy in reaching his decision.\nExplaining this, he noted:\n       In this particular matter, as in most, the credibility\n    and persuasiveness of the testimony is of paramount\n    concern. While I found all of the witnesses who testified\n    were credible, I was most persuaded by the testimony\n    of Dr. McKirdy. With regard to her resume, suffice it to\n    say that she is impeccably credentialed in the area of\n    deaf education. However, her credentials did not form\n    the entire basis of my decision to give controlling\n    weight to her testimony — it was the manner in which\n    she testified. It was abundantly clear to me, after\n    listening to her on both direct and cross-examination\n    and comparing her responses to those of the other\n    witnesses, that no one connected with the hearing\n    knew more about deaf education than she.\n    Furthermore, her knowledge of I.H., while admittedly\n    not as personal as others who may have testified, was\n    sufficiently informed to lead me to conclude that her\n    opinions took into account I.H.’s unique needs.\nS.H. v. Newark Bd. Educ., No. EDS7639-99 at 10.\n  Both parties and the witnesses agreed that I.H. was a\ngood student, and was making progress toward her\neducational goals. In his decision, the ALJ summarized the\nconclusions from the Lake Drive School’s evaluation. The\nLake Drive evaluation recommended continuing speech and\nlanguage therapy of four thirty-minute-sessions a week.\nThe evaluation found that I.H.’s progress was directly\nrelated to the frequency and planning of the speech and\nlanguage programs. Lake Drive’s review concluded that\ncontinuing I.H.’s “tightly structured” program was\nnecessary for her language development.\n  The ALJ contrasted Lake Drive School’s comprehensive\nevaluation to the proposed IEP. It is through the IEP that\nthe School District must prove that it will confer a\nmeaningful educational benefit on I.H. in transferring her to\nBruce Street. The School District carries the burden of\nshowing this IEP is appropriate. See, e.g., Fuhrmann, 993\nF.2d at 1034-35 (“[I]t is quite clear that when a change in\na child’s IEP is sought, regardless of whether the party\n\f                                9\n\n\nseeking the change is the school district or the parents, the\nburden of showing that the placement is ‘appropriate’ rests\nwith the school district.”).\n   A Child Study Team (CST) from Bruce Street developed\nthe June proposed IEP. Although the CST that placed I.H.\nin the Lake Drive School in 1999 was also from the Newark\nSchool District, the members of each team were different.2\nThe CST drafted the proposed IEP after observing I.H. both\nin and out of Lake Drive School. However, the ALJ found\nthat the School District drafted the IEP with little or no\ninput from the staff at Lake Drive. In his findings of fact,\nthe ALJ noted several deficiencies in the IEP. Because the\nALJ heard the witnesses and weighed the evidence in light\nof their testimony and credibility, reviewing these factual\nfindings is instructive.\n  The ALJ noted that the proposed IEP failed to recognize\nthat I.H. retained some residual hearing in her left ear.\nTestimony before the ALJ suggested that this residual\nhearing might be used to help I.H. develop some\nunderstandable oral communication. The ALJ found this\nomission from the IEP to be significant. The proposed IEP\nalso failed to reference the appropriate standardized tests\nfor evaluating I.H. The test noted in the IEP was not\nnormed for hearing impaired children as young as I.H.\n  The ALJ considered the “supplementary aides and\nservices and instructional modifications” in the proposed\nIEP and found them to be inappropriate for I.H. The IEP\nspecified the use of the “Kendall Demonstration Elementary\nSchool Curriculum.” However, the ALJ found that the\nKendall Curriculum are guidelines for a curriculum, not a\ncurriculum; that they may be outdated; and, since not\ndeveloped for New Jersey, that they may be inappropriate\nfor enabling deaf children to compete academically in New\nJersey. Instead, the ALJ found that the appropriate\ncurriculum would focus on New Jersey’s educational\nrequirements and standards. In contrast, the Lake Drive\nSchool uses New Jersey standards and materials for the\neducation of hearing impaired children.\n\n2. Perhaps explaining why the current CST could not explain why the\nSchool District initially placed I.H. at Lake Drive School.\n\f                              10\n\n\n   Although the School District placed much emphasis on\nBruce Street as the least restrictive environment because it\noffered extracurricular activities, the ALJ found that the\nproposed IEP did not support this assertion. Specifically,\nthe proposed IEP noted that I.H. would be able to\nparticipate in “art with sign interpreter.” However, the ALJ\nfound that I.H. would receive little benefit from this art\nclass because focusing on both the teacher and the sign\ninterpreter, and understanding that the message and\ndeliverer are distinct, is difficult for young deaf children. In\ncomparison, the art teacher at Lake Drive is a fluent signer.\nThe School District emphasized the “mainstreaming”\nopportunities available at Bruce Street, but the ALJ found\nthe “mainstreaming” provided at Bruce Street to be de\nminimis at best. The students are segregated for classes,\nand although they attend assemblies and recess with\nhearing children, they are further segregated by the\nuniforms the Bruce Street children wear, which\ndifferentiate them from the rest of the Carver School\nchildren.\n  Lake Drive’s evaluation of I.H. suggested that she needed\nto participate in an extended school year (summer school).\nThe ALJ found that for I.H., the extended school year was\nparticularly important in her language acquisition. The\nproposed IEP did not call for an extended school year. In\naddition, the ALJ found that the proposed IEP lacked many\nspecifics necessary to find that it would confer a\nmeaningful education benefit on I.H.\n   Finally, the ALJ found that the School District failed to\nprove that the “total communication” philosophy employed\nat Bruce Street would confer a meaningful benefit to I.H.\nTotal communication is a process of incorporating all\nmeans of communication with the children, which in\npractice can differ between institutions. The ALJ accepted\nthe testimony that consistent use of signs and word order\nwas important for teaching I.H. The total communication\npracticed at Bruce Street is apparently different from that\nused at Lake Drive, and to the extent that they are\ndifferent, the ALJ found that it would be detrimental to I.H.\nBased on his extensive factual findings, the ALJ concluded\nthat the School District did not prove “by a preponderance\n\f                             11\n\n\nof the credible evidence that it can provide I.H. with an\nappropriate education.” S.H. v. Newark Bd. Educ., No.\nEDS7639-99 at 11.\n\n              2.   District Court Proceedings\n   The ALJ issued his decision on October 4, 1999. S.H.\nwent to U.S. District Court seeking fees for the cost of the\nadministrative action on May 24, 2000. On June 8, 2000,\neight months after the ALJ’s decision, the School District\nfiled an answer and counterclaim, for the first time\nchallenging the ALJ’s decision. The matter was referred to\na Magistrate Judge on cross-motions for summary\njudgment. In recommending a decision, the Magistrate\nJudge took no new testimony.\n  In his recommendation, the Magistrate Judge reviewed\nthe facts and arguments of the parties, and summarily\nrejected the testimony of Dr. McKirdy, whose testimony the\nALJ found most persuasive and credible. After recognizing\nthat the standard of review called for giving due weight to\nthe ALJ, the Magistrate Judge conducted a one-paragraph\n“analysis”:\n      On the record before me, I conclude that the defense\n    motion should be granted. I recognize that “due weight”\n    must be afforded to the Administrative Law Judge’s\n    determination. But even granting that weight, I believe\n    the Court’s independent judgment based on a\n    preponderance of the evidence requires a determination\n    that the Administrative Law Judge in this case simply\n    “got it wrong.” It is entirely clear to me that a free and\n    appropriate public education will be provided at the\n    Bruce Street School while affording the least restrictive\n    environment for I.H., as mandated by the applicable\n    law. . . . In short, I find the defendant District’s\n    arguments more persuasive in this case.\nS.H. v. State-Operated Sch. Dist. of Newark, No. 00-2559,\nMag. R & R. at 18-19 (D. N.J. Mar 13, 2001).\n  The District Court adopted the conclusion of the\nMagistrate in a letter opinion. In adopting the\nrecommendation, the District Court added little to the\n\f                               12\n\n\nMagistrate Judge’s recommendation. It found that Bruce\nStreet was the least restrictive environment because of its\nproximity to I.H.’s home and its opportunities for\ninteraction with nondisabled children. In addition, the\nDistrict Court noted that the CST members evaluated I.H.\nand recommended that she attend Bruce Street.\n\n                               II.\n\n                          A.   Issues\n   On appeal, S.H. argues that the District Court did not\nafford the ALJ proper deference as to his findings of fact.\nS.H. also challenges the District Court’s conclusion that the\nproposed IEP would confer a meaningful educational\nbenefit. Finally, S.H. questions whether the School\nDistrict’s counterclaim appealing the ALJ decision was\ntimely.\n\n                   B.   Standard of Review\n   We exercise jurisdiction over IDEA cases pursuant to 20\nU.S.C. §1415. Our review of the legal standard the District\nCourt applied is plenary. See T.R., 205 F.3d at 576. District\nCourts are to give due weight to the factual findings of the\nALJ in IDEA cases. We have outlined the meaning of “due\nweight” through several cases, although we have not\ndefinitively addressed what constitutes “due weight.” See\nSusan N., 70 F.3d at 758; see also Holmes v. Millcreek Twp.\nSch. Dist., 205 F.3d 583, 591-92 (3d Cir. 2000) (“We must\ngive ‘due weight’ to the underlying state administrative\nproceedings. . . . [A]lthough we must consider\nadministrative fact findings, we have not interpreted Rowley\nas requiring us to accept such findings.”); D.R. v. East\nBrunswick Bd. Educ., 109 F.3d 896, 898 (3d Cir. 1996)\n(“The Third Circuit has interpreted the Supreme Court’s\ninstruction in Rowley to require that a court consider—\nalthough not necessarily to accept—the administrative fact\nfindings.”); Carlisle Area Sch. v. Scott P., 62 F.3d 520, 527\n(3d Cir. 1996) (“[A]lthough the district courts must consider\nthe administrative findings of fact, they are free to accept or\nreject them. . . . But if the district court chooses to depart\n\f                                  13\n\n\nfrom the agency’s ruling, it               should     provide    some\nexplanation for its departure.”).\n   In Susan N., we noted the Tenth Circuit’s description of\nthe “due weight” requirement as “modified de novo review.”\n70 F.3d at 758 (citing Murray v. Montrose County Sch. Dist.,\n51 F.3d 921, 927 (10th Cir. 1995)). Since then, several\nother cases have elucidated the contours of “due weight,”\nand described the standard of review as “modified de novo\nreview.” Under the IDEA, the reviewing court “is obliged to\nconduct a modified de novo review, giving ‘due weight’ to\nthe underlying administrative proceedings.” MM v. Sch. Dist.\nof Greenville County, 303 F.3d 523, 530-31 (4th Cir. 2002)\n(citations omitted). Factual findings from the administrative\nproceedings are to be considered prima facie correct. Id. at\n531. “[I]f a reviewing court fails to adhere to them, it is\nobliged to explain why. The court is not, however, to\nsubstitute its own notions of sound educational policy for\nthose of local school authorities.” Id. (citations omitted).\n  Although we have not referred to the proper standard of\nreview as modified de novo before, our cases call for this\nstandard. In discussing Pennsylvania’s two-tier system of\nadministrative review in IDEA cases, we stated that the\nappeals panel “should defer to the hearing officer’s findings\nbased on credibility judgments unless the non-testimonial,\nextrinsic evidence in the record would justify a contrary\nconclusion or unless the record read in its entirety would\ncompel a contrary conclusion.” Carlisle, 62 F.3d at 529. A\nfederal district court reviewing the administrative fact finder\nin the first instance is similarly required to defer to the\nALJ’s factual findings unless it can point to contrary non-\ntestimonial extrinsic evidence on the record.3\n  In Oberti v. Board of Education of the Borough of the\nClementon School District, we noted that where the District\nCourt hears additional evidence it is “free to accept or reject\nthe agency findings depending on whether those findings\nare supported by the new, expanded record and whether\n\n3. Under the IDEA, the District Court could have taken additional\nevidence. 20 U.S.C. §1415(e)(2). This case concerns those situations\nwhere the District Court did not hear additional evidence and based its\ndecision on the factual record as developed at the administrative level.\n\f                             14\n\n\nthey are consistent with the requirements of the Act.” 995\nF.2d 1204, 1220 (3d Cir. 1993). In contrast, where the\nDistrict Court does not hear additional evidence it must\nfind support for any factual conclusions contrary to the\nALJ’s in the record before it. Moreover, the court must\nexplain why it does not accept the ALJ’s findings of fact to\navoid the impression that it is substituting its own notions\nof sound educational policy for those of the agency it\nreviews. See Susan N., 70 F.3d at 757.\n   In addition to the Tenth Circuit and Fourth Circuit’s use\nof the modified de novo standard, the Sixth Circuit has\ndescribed the appropriate standard of review as modified de\nnovo as well. See Knable v. Bexley City Sch. Dist., 238 F.3d\n755, 764 (6th Cir. 2001) (“According to this ‘modified’ de\nnovo standard of review, a district court is required to make\nfindings of fact based on a preponderance of the evidence\ncontained in the complete record, while giving some\ndeference to the fact findings of the administrative\nproceedings.”). We agree with these other courts that the\nappropriate review of the administrative hearing is modified\nde novo.\n\n                             III.\n\n        A.   Application of modified de novo review\n  In cases where we have upheld a District Court’s decision\nto overrule the administrative fact finder, the District Court\nhas fully explained its reasons for departing from the state\ndecision. For example, in Wexler v. Westfield Board of\nEducation, “The district court, in a very thorough opinion,\nanalyzed the evidence in a responsible and sensitive\nfashion. It reviewed all the test results, and all the\nadministrative proceedings, including the transcripts and\nreports. Its findings are detailed and supported by the\nevidence.” 784 F.2d 176, 181 (3d Cir. 1986). Similarly in\nGeis v. Board of Education, we noted that “In a thorough\nopinion, the district court [made an independent\ndetermination based on a preponderance of the evidence],\nspecifically citing the evidence in its record and the\nadministrative record that supported its conclusion, as well\n\f                             15\n\n\nas discussing the conflicting evidence.” 774 F.2d 575, 583\n(3d Cir. 1985). In Oberti, the District Court held a three day\ntrial and took new evidence before concluding that the ALJ\nerred. 995 F.2d at 1210.\n  In contrast, the Magistrate Judge here concluded that the\nALJ “simply got it wrong.” Although the report and\nrecommendation adopted by the District Court does set\nforth the arguments from the School District and S.H., it\ndoes not explain why the District Court reached the\nconclusion that the ALJ “simply got it wrong.” The District\nCourt did not address any of the extensive factual findings\nnoted above regarding the deficiencies with the proposed\nIEP. Under the modified de novo standard of review, this\ndoes not accord sufficient deference to the factual\nconclusions of the ALJ.\n\n                B.   Appropriateness of IEP\n   The issue of whether an IEP is appropriate is a question\nof fact. Carlisle, 62 F.3d at 526. Even if the District Court\napplied the wrong standard of review, we may still uphold\nits decision if correct under the appropriate standard of\nreview. See T.R., 205 F.3d at 577 (finding that although the\ndistrict court applied the wrong test, its decision could\nnevertheless be upheld under application of the correct\nstandard.). We review the decision of the ALJ under the\nmodified de novo standard, giving due weight to the ALJ’s\ndecision. The issue is the appropriateness of the IEP\nchanging I.H.’s placement to the Bruce Street School, and\nthe burden is on the School District. We will defer to the\nALJ’s credibility determinations unless countered by non-\ntestimonial evidence on the record.\n  As discussed above, the ALJ noted several deficiencies in\nthe proposed IEP. Taking the ALJ’s factual findings as\nprima facie correct, we must decide whether the record\ncontradicts those factual findings. As the School District\ncorrectly points out, the issue is not a comparison between\nthe Lake Drive School and the Bruce Street School. The\nIDEA does not require the School District to provide I.H.\nwith the best possible education. However, the School\nDistrict does not meet its burden by simply showing that\n\f                              16\n\n\nan appropriate program may be available. Instead, the\nSchool District must show that the proposed IEP will\nprovide I.H. with a meaningful educational benefit. This is\nan individual determination personal to I.H. See\nRidgewood,       172   F.3d   at   248    (determining   the\nappropriateness of an IEP requires “a student-by-student\nanalysis that carefully considers the student’s individual\nabilities.”). The Lake Drive School and its program are only\nan issue as far as they relate to I.H.’s specific situation.\nHere, the School District initially placed I.H. in the Lake\nDrive School. Now, one factor of I.H.’s individual situation\nis her placement at Lake Drive. In other words, if a change\nin her placement will be detrimental, this is a factor in\ndetermining whether the new placement will achieve a\nmeaningful educational benefit.\n\n             1.   Least Restrictive Environment\n  The School District premises much of its argument on\nthe idea that Bruce Street is the least restrictive\nenvironment (LRE). The ALJ found that although Bruce\nStreet is contained within a neighborhood school with\nnondisabled children, its mainstreaming opportunities were\nactually de minimis.\n   We have adopted a two-part test for determining whether\na School District complies with the LRE requirement. The\nfirst step is for the court to determine whether the school\ncan educate the child in a regular classroom with the use\nof supplementary aids and services. If, as here, the child\ncannot be educated in a regular classroom, the next step is\nto decide whether the school is mainstreaming the child to\nthe maximum extent possible. Oberti, 995 F.2d at 1215.\nBefore we reach this two-part test though, we note that the\nchild must be educated in the LRE that will provide a\nmeaningful educational benefit. See T.R., 205 F.3d at 578.\n  In Carlisle, we noted that the LRE would ideally be the\nsame school the child would have attended if she were not\ndisabled. 62 F.3d at 535. However, we prefaced that\nstatement by noting that such placement is only\nappropriate to the extent that it “satisfactorily educates” the\ndisabled child. Id. The School District and District Court’s\n\f                             17\n\n\nemphasis on the LRE requirement here is misplaced. The\nSchool District must first prove that the IEP will provide a\nmeaningful educational benefit. The School District cannot\nbootstrap the meaningful educational benefit with the LRE\nrequirement. The “IDEA requires that disabled students be\neducated in the least restrictive appropriate educational\nenvironment.” Ridgewood, 172 F.3d at 249 (emphasis\nadded). If the educational environment is not appropriate,\nthen there is no need to consider whether it is the least\nrestrictive.\n   Even considering the mainstreaming opportunities the\nSchool District points to, we agree with the ALJ that they\nare de minimis. Other than potential interaction at lunch or\nrecess (in a uniform segregating the Bruce Street students\nfrom the nondisabled students), the School District points\nto art with sign interpreter and “after school sports with\nlate bus” proving Bruce Street is the LRE. App. at A458.\nThe LRE should be considered in light of I.H.’s specific\neducational needs. Geis v. Bd. Educ., 774 F.2d 575, 583\n(3d Cir. 1985). As the ALJ noted, art with sign interpreter\nwould provide almost no educational benefit to I.H.\nTherefore, any value from mainstreaming is marginal. As to\nthe “after school sports with late bus,” the School District\ndoes not detail to what extent I.H., in kindergarten, would\neven be able to use this program.\n\n            2.   Meaningful Educational Benefit\n   Taking each deficiency noted by the ALJ in turn, the\nevidence on the record does not overcome the ALJ’s factual\nconclusions. For several deficiencies, the School District\ndoes not present any rebuttal and none can be found in the\nrecord. The proposed IEP does not address I.H.’s residual\nhearing, nor does the School District explain why the ALJ’s\nfinding that this is a significant omission is incorrect. The\nIEP refers to use of the Stanford Achievement Test “normed\non the Hearing Impaired.” App. at A455. The School District\ndoes not rebut Dr. McKirdy’s statement that the SAT is not\nan appropriate test for determining I.H.’s performance\nlevels, as the test is not normed for children younger than\neight.\n\f                                  18\n\n\n  The proposed IEP recognizes that I.H.’s progress may\nsuffer without an extended school year. App. at A463\n(“Hearing-impaired children lose a great deal of academic\nground during the summer months . . . when they are not\nin a structured, academic setting.”). Nevertheless, the\nproposed IEP does not address extended school year\nservices.\n   The ALJ found that consistent use of signs, specifically\nrelating to the word order used and the use of connecting\nwords and word endings, was one of the most important\naspects of teaching I.H. English. S.H. v. Newark Bd. Educ.,\nNo. EDS7639-99 at 9-10, ¶ 34-36. A thorough review of the\nrecord supports the ALJ’s conclusion that the School\nDistrict did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence\nthat the communications methods of Bruce Street and Lake\nDrive are the same. The parties agree that both schools\nadhere to the “total communication” philosophy. The\nevidence in the record does not rebut the ALJ’s conclusion\nthat the execution of the total communication philosophy\nwas different between the two schools. Dr. McKirdy testified\nthat Lake Drive stresses the use of connecting words and\nword endings because those words are easily missed.4 The\nschool stresses consistency between teachers and classes to\nassure that the appropriate signs are used. In addition, Dr.\nMcKirdy testified that the school strives for consistency\nwith words for which there is not a formally accepted sign.\nThe School District’s witnesses testified that Bruce Street\nemploys the same philosophy of total communication, but\ndid not contradict the ALJ’s conclusions that there may be\nsignificant differences in the details of the language used.\nCoupled with the ALJ’s finding that I.H. is at an important\nstage in her language acquisition, the record supports the\n\n4. Dr. McKirdy gave the following example in her testimony: “putting the\ns on the end of a word, three balls, plus the plural marker on the end,\nyou would mark a past tense, you would mark . . . good, better, and\nbest, so that the er, est endings on an adjective so that you’re giving\nclues for that. Like a sentence, he walks the dog, versus he walked the\ndog, has hugely different meaning, which you use a signed marker to\nshow that it’s either active or happened in the past.”\nApp. at A276.\n\f                             19\n\n\nALJ’s conclusion that differences in the program may be\ndetrimental to I.H.\n  The non-testimonial evidence on the record does not\ncontradict the ALJ’s factual findings. Therefore, we accept\nthem as correct. In light of his factual findings, the ALJ’s\nconclusion that the School District did not prove by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the proposed IEP would\nconvey a meaningful educational benefit is not in error.\n\n                       C.   Timeliness\n   S.H. also challenges the timeliness of the School\nDistrict’s challenge to the ALJ’s decision. The District Court\ndid not address this issue. The IDEA does not contain a\nstatute of limitations relating to these suits. In Tokarcik v.\nForest Hills School District, 665 F.2d 443 (3d Cir. 1981), we\ndecided that, under Pennsylvania law, either a two-year or\nsix year statute of limitations applies. We have followed this\ndecision in later cases. See, e.g., Jeremy H. v. Mount\nLebanon Sch. Dist., 95 F.3d 272, 280 (3d Cir. 1996). In\nRidgewood, we held that the appropriate statute of\nlimitations for a parent to appeal an adverse administrative\ndecision under the IDEA in New Jersey is two years. 172\nF.3d at 251. We have also held that the time to initiate the\nadministrative procedure is a question of equity and that\nthe parents must initiate proceedings within a reasonable\ntime. Bernardsville Bd. Educ. v. J.H., 42 F.3d 149, 157-60\n(3d Cir. 1994).\n   S.H. suggests that we should extend this equitable\nprinciple to determining the appropriate time for the school\nto appeal from an adverse administrative decision. S.H.’s\nconcerns are understandable. New Jersey clearly seeks\nprompt settlement of these disputes by imposing a 45-day\nlimit on the time the ALJ may take to decide. Here, the ALJ\npromptly issued a decision as to the 1999-2000 IEP early in\nthe school year. It was not until May 26, 2000 that S.H.\nsought attorneys’ fees. This was after the May 16, 2000 IEP\ndevelopment meeting for the 2000-01 school year where the\nSchool District apparently suggested continuing placement\nat Lake Drive. Only after S.H. sought attorneys’ fees did the\nSchool District challenge the ALJ’s decision. Nevertheless,\n\f                              20\n\n\nwe are not inclined to parse our earlier decisions in an\nattempt to carve out a new statute of limitations here.\n   While we do not adopt S.H.’s suggestion to impose a\nshorter statute of limitation, we do note that the School\nDistrict’s delay should have an impact on the remedy. The\nSchool District suggests that if we uphold the ALJ’s\ndecision that the IEP is inappropriate, the proper remedy is\nto allow it to revise its IEP to properly address the\nplacement at Bruce Street. Were we to follow the School\nDistrict’s suggestion, we would strip the attorney fee\nprovisions of the IDEA of any effectiveness in similar cases.\nWe are addressing only the 1999 proposed IEP. If the\nSchool District can “correct” the IEP in 2003 (or any time\nafter the 1999-2000 school year) and then claim that the\nstudent has not prevailed, plaintiffs in these cases could\nnever recover attorneys’ fees. This is clearly not the\nintention of Congress in providing for attorneys’ fees in the\nIDEA. Had the School District promptly appealed the case\nfollowing the ALJ decision, and had it lost, it may have\nbeen able to present an IEP showing that I.H. would receive\na meaningful educational benefit at Bruce Street.\n\n                              IV.\n   The School District did not prove by a preponderance of\nthe evidence that the proposed IEP would afford I.H. with a\nfree and appropriate education. Therefore, the judgment of\nthe District Court in favor of the School is reversed and we\nremand this case with instructions to enter judgment in\nfavor of S.H.\n\nA True Copy:\n        Teste:\n\n                   Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n                               for the Third Circuit\n\f\f",

At issue is the Newark\nSchool District’s proposed individual education plan for I.H.\nfor the 1999-2000 school year, which returned her to in-\ndistrict placement. I.H. and her mother, S.H., prevailed in\ntheir due process hearing at the state administrative level,\nwherein the Administrative Law Judge concluded that the\nSchool District failed to meet its burden in proving that the\nchange in placement would provide a meaningful\neducational benefit. After S.H. sought attorneys’ fees in\nfederal District Court, the School District counterclaimed\nchallenging the administrative decision. The District Court\nreversed the administrative decision. Central to this case is\nthe appropriate standard of review a District Court should\nemploy when reviewing state administrative proceedings\nunder the Individuals with Disabilities Act. We hold that\nthe appropriate standard is modified de novo review.\nBecause the District Court did not apply the correct\nstandard of review, we will reverse.\n\n                      I.   Background\n\n         A.   The Individuals with Disabilities Act\n  This case arises under a confluence of state and federal\ndisabilities law. Therefore, it is useful to review the\nstatutory framework before proceeding to the facts. Federal\nfunding of state special education programs is contingent\non the states providing a “free and appropriate education”\n\f                               3\n\n\nto all disabled children. 20 U.S.C. §1412. The Individuals\nwith Disabilities Act (IDEA) is the vehicle Congress has\nchosen to ensure that states follow this mandate. 20 U.S.C.\n§1400 et seq. “A free, appropriate public education consists\nof educational instruction specially designed to meet the\nunique needs of the handicapped child, supported by such\nservices as are necessary to permit the child to ‘benefit’\nfrom the instruction.” Susan N. v.

Id. An\nIEP is a written statement developed for each child that\nmust include several elements. 20 U.S.C. § 1414(1)(A). It\nmust include a statement of the child’s current level of\nperformance, and how her disability affects her\nperformance. Id. at (1)(A)(I). It must set measurable annual\ngoals relating both to progress in the general curriculum\nand additional educational needs arising from her\ndisability. Id. at (1)(A)(ii). The IEP must detail those special\neducation services and supplementary aids that the school\nwill provide, explain how they will contribute toward\nmeeting the annual goals, how they will allow the child to\nprogress in both the general curriculum and participate in\nextracurricular activities, and describe how the child will\ninteract with disabled and nondisabled children. Id. at\n(1)(A)(iii). In measuring the child’s progress, the IEP must\nexplain whether standard student assessments will be\nused. If not, the IEP must explain why not and how the\nschool will assess the child. Id. at (1)(A)(v).\n  Besides setting out the required content of an IEP, the\nIDEA explains how the school is to develop an IEP. An IEP\nteam meets and writes the IEP considering the strengths of\nthe child, the concerns of the parent, and the most recent\nevaluation of the child. Id. at (3). As to hearing impaired\nchildren, the IEP team is to:\n    (iv) consider the communication needs of the child,\n    and in the case of a child who is deaf or hard of\n    hearing,   consider   the   child’s  language    and\n    communication     needs,  opportunities  for   direct\n    communications with peers and professional personnel\n\f                                   4\n\n\n     in the child’s language and communication mode,\n     academic level, and full range of needs, including\n     opportunities for direct instruction in the child’s\n     language and communication mode; and\n     (v) consider whether the child               requires   assistive\n     technology devices and services.\nId. The IEP team is to be composed of the child’s parents,\nat least one special education teacher of the child, a\nspecialist in developing curriculum from the local district,\nand at the request of the parent or the school district,\nanyone with special knowledge or expertise related to the\nchild’s education. Id. at (1)(B).\n   In addition to the general requirements set out in the\nIDEA,    state    and   federal    regulations  detail   the\nimplementation of the statute. See, e.g., 34 C.F.R.\n§ 300.340-300.350 (setting out requirements for IEP);\nN.J.A.C.    § 6A:14-1.3   (defining   IEP).

Rather, the only issue is whether the School\nDistrict’s proposed IEP, changing I.H.’s placement, would\nprovide her a meaningful educational benefit. Ridgewood,\n172 F.3d at 247.\n\n                      B.     Factual Background\n  The Appellant, S.H., brings this appeal individually and\non behalf of her daughter I.H. I.H. has severe to profound\nsensorineural hearing loss. When she was two years old,\nthe Newark Public School District identified I.H. as eligible\nfor its preschool handicapped program. After determining\nthat there was no suitable program in I.H.’s home School\nDistrict, the School District placed I.H. at the Lake Drive\nSchool for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children. I.H. began\nattending Lake Drive School in the summer of 1997 when\nshe was three years old.\n  The Lake Drive School is a public school outside the\nNewark School District. In justifying this placement, the\n\n    disabilities, including children in public or private institutions or\n    other care facilities, are educated with children who are not\n    disabled, and special classes, separate schooling, or other removal\n    of children with disabilities from the regular educational\n    environment occurs only when the nature or severity of the\n    disability of a child is such that education in regular classes with\n    the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved\n    satisfactorily.\n20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A).\n\f                             6\n\n\nSchool District noted that I.H. required a special program\nunavailable in her home district. Specifically, she required\na small, specialized, and highly structured education\nprogram tailored to her functioning levels, hearing\nimpairment, and specific sensory deficit. This program\nwould provide “developmentally appropriate curriculum,\nteachers specialized in working with hearing-impaired\nchildren, presentation of auditory training, sensory\nutilization skills and facilitation of communication\nskills.” S.H. v. Newark Bd. Educ., No. EDS7639-99, at 3\n¶1 (N.J. OAL, Oct. 4, 1999) available at http://\nlawlibrary.rutgers.edu/oal/word/initial/eds7639-99-1.doc\n  The School District developed a new IEP the next year,\nrevisiting I.H.’s placement. This IEP specified placement at\nthe Bruce Street School for the Deaf in Newark beginning in\nSeptember 1998. The Bruce Street School is a self-\ncontained school for the deaf placed within a larger school,\nthe George Washington Carver School. This is the\nneighborhood school that I.H. would have attended if she\nhad not been hearing impaired. The Bruce Street School\nwas available for I.H.’s initial placement in 1997, and the\nSchool District explains neither why it was not appropriate\nfor the initial placement, nor what changed in the interim\nmaking it appropriate.\n  S.H. challenged the School District’s change in I.H.’s\nplacement. Following mediation, I.H. was allowed to remain\nat the Lake Drive School. As a result, I.H. attended the\nLake Drive School preschool handicapped program from\n1997 to 1999. An interim IEP developed in January 1999\nalso resulted in I.H.’s continuing placement at Lake Drive\nSchool. The Lake Drive School’s evaluations of I.H.\nconducted in January 1999 concluded that she should\nremain in the school for summer school and the 1999-2000\nschool year.\n  In the spring of 1999, the School District reevaluated I.H.\nto decide the appropriate placement for the 1999-2000\nschool year, the year she would start kindergarten. In this\nJune 1999 proposed IEP, the School District found that the\nleast restrictive environment for I.H. was the Bruce Street\nSchool for the Deaf. In finding that it was the least\nrestrictive environment, the School District noted that\n\f                                7\n\n\nBruce Street School is near I.H.’s home, and differs from\nLake Drive in that I.H. could have interaction with\nnonhandicapped children between classes (e.g., lunch and\nrecess). Because she wanted I.H. to continue attending\nschool at Lake Drive, where the District initially placed I.H.,\nS.H. requested a due process hearing challenging I.H.’s\nplacement for the 1999-2000 school year.\n\n                   C.    Procedural History\n\n                        1.   ALJ Decision\n   New Jersey’s process for resolving disputes arising in\nspecial education cases starts with mediation. N.J.A.C.\n§ 1:6A-4.1. If mediation fails, the case is forwarded to the\nOffice of Administrative Law and assigned to an\nAdministrative Law Judge (ALJ). After the hearing, the ALJ\nhas forty-five days to issue his decision. There is no\nadditional review under New Jersey’s administrative\nsystem, and the case can be directly appealed to New\nJersey superior court or federal district court. N.J.C.A.\n§ 1:6A-18.1-18.3.\n   At the administrative hearing, S.H. sought to have I.H.’s\nplacement continue at the Lake Drive School for the 1999-\n2000 school year. The ALJ held hearings for three days,\nreceived evidence from both the School District and S.H.,\nand heard testimony from several witnesses for both\nparties. In his opinion, the ALJ made extensive factual\nfindings. The ALJ had before him multiple evaluations of\nI.H, including Lake Drive School’s annual review prepared\nin January, and the School District’s June proposed IEP.\nThe ALJ made his factual findings based on these reports,\nin addition to other documentary evidence, and the\ntestimony of several witnesses.\n  The primary witness for S.H. was Dr. Laura McKirdy, the\nprincipal at Lake Drive School. Besides being principal of\nLake Drive since 1978, Dr. McKirdy is a speech language\npathologist and developmental psychologist, and is a\ncertified elementary school teacher. The ALJ accepted Dr.\nMcKirdy as an expert on deaf education based on her\ntraining, education, and experience. The ALJ heavily relied\n\f                             8\n\n\non the testimony of Dr. McKirdy in reaching his decision.\nExplaining this, he noted:\n       In this particular matter, as in most, the credibility\n    and persuasiveness of the testimony is of paramount\n    concern. While I found all of the witnesses who testified\n    were credible, I was most persuaded by the testimony\n    of Dr. McKirdy. With regard to her resume, suffice it to\n    say that she is impeccably credentialed in the area of\n    deaf education. However, her credentials did not form\n    the entire basis of my decision to give controlling\n    weight to her testimony — it was the manner in which\n    she testified. It was abundantly clear to me, after\n    listening to her on both direct and cross-examination\n    and comparing her responses to those of the other\n    witnesses, that no one connected with the hearing\n    knew more about deaf education than she.\n    Furthermore, her knowledge of I.H., while admittedly\n    not as personal as others who may have testified, was\n    sufficiently informed to lead me to conclude that her\n    opinions took into account I.H.’s unique needs.\nS.H. v. Newark Bd. Educ., No. EDS7639-99 at 10.\n  Both parties and the witnesses agreed that I.H. was a\ngood student, and was making progress toward her\neducational goals. In his decision, the ALJ summarized the\nconclusions from the Lake Drive School’s evaluation. The\nLake Drive evaluation recommended continuing speech and\nlanguage therapy of four thirty-minute-sessions a week.\nThe evaluation found that I.H.’s progress was directly\nrelated to the frequency and planning of the speech and\nlanguage programs. Lake Drive’s review concluded that\ncontinuing I.H.’s “tightly structured” program was\nnecessary for her language development.\n  The ALJ contrasted Lake Drive School’s comprehensive\nevaluation to the proposed IEP. It is through the IEP that\nthe School District must prove that it will confer a\nmeaningful educational benefit on I.H. in transferring her to\nBruce Street. The School District carries the burden of\nshowing this IEP is appropriate. See, e.g., Fuhrmann, 993\nF.2d at 1034-35 (“[I]t is quite clear that when a change in\na child’s IEP is sought, regardless of whether the party\n\f                                9\n\n\nseeking the change is the school district or the parents, the\nburden of showing that the placement is ‘appropriate’ rests\nwith the school district.”).\n   A Child Study Team (CST) from Bruce Street developed\nthe June proposed IEP. Although the CST that placed I.H.\nin the Lake Drive School in 1999 was also from the Newark\nSchool District, the members of each team were different.2\nThe CST drafted the proposed IEP after observing I.H. both\nin and out of Lake Drive School. However, the ALJ found\nthat the School District drafted the IEP with little or no\ninput from the staff at Lake Drive. In his findings of fact,\nthe ALJ noted several deficiencies in the IEP. Because the\nALJ heard the witnesses and weighed the evidence in light\nof their testimony and credibility, reviewing these factual\nfindings is instructive.\n  The ALJ noted that the proposed IEP failed to recognize\nthat I.H. retained some residual hearing in her left ear.\nTestimony before the ALJ suggested that this residual\nhearing might be used to help I.H. develop some\nunderstandable oral communication. The ALJ found this\nomission from the IEP to be significant. The proposed IEP\nalso failed to reference the appropriate standardized tests\nfor evaluating I.H. The test noted in the IEP was not\nnormed for hearing impaired children as young as I.H.\n  The ALJ considered the “supplementary aides and\nservices and instructional modifications” in the proposed\nIEP and found them to be inappropriate for I.H. The IEP\nspecified the use of the “Kendall Demonstration Elementary\nSchool Curriculum.” However, the ALJ found that the\nKendall Curriculum are guidelines for a curriculum, not a\ncurriculum; that they may be outdated; and, since not\ndeveloped for New Jersey, that they may be inappropriate\nfor enabling deaf children to compete academically in New\nJersey. Instead, the ALJ found that the appropriate\ncurriculum would focus on New Jersey’s educational\nrequirements and standards. In contrast, the Lake Drive\nSchool uses New Jersey standards and materials for the\neducation of hearing impaired children.\n\n2. Perhaps explaining why the current CST could not explain why the\nSchool District initially placed I.H. at Lake Drive School.\n\f                              10\n\n\n   Although the School District placed much emphasis on\nBruce Street as the least restrictive environment because it\noffered extracurricular activities, the ALJ found that the\nproposed IEP did not support this assertion. Specifically,\nthe proposed IEP noted that I.H. would be able to\nparticipate in “art with sign interpreter.” However, the ALJ\nfound that I.H. would receive little benefit from this art\nclass because focusing on both the teacher and the sign\ninterpreter, and understanding that the message and\ndeliverer are distinct, is difficult for young deaf children. In\ncomparison, the art teacher at Lake Drive is a fluent signer.\nThe School District emphasized the “mainstreaming”\nopportunities available at Bruce Street, but the ALJ found\nthe “mainstreaming” provided at Bruce Street to be de\nminimis at best. The students are segregated for classes,\nand although they attend assemblies and recess with\nhearing children, they are further segregated by the\nuniforms the Bruce Street children wear, which\ndifferentiate them from the rest of the Carver School\nchildren.\n  Lake Drive’s evaluation of I.H. suggested that she needed\nto participate in an extended school year (summer school).\nThe ALJ found that for I.H., the extended school year was\nparticularly important in her language acquisition. The\nproposed IEP did not call for an extended school year. In\naddition, the ALJ found that the proposed IEP lacked many\nspecifics necessary to find that it would confer a\nmeaningful education benefit on I.H.\n   Finally, the ALJ found that the School District failed to\nprove that the “total communication” philosophy employed\nat Bruce Street would confer a meaningful benefit to I.H.\nTotal communication is a process of incorporating all\nmeans of communication with the children, which in\npractice can differ between institutions. The ALJ accepted\nthe testimony that consistent use of signs and word order\nwas important for teaching I.H. The total communication\npracticed at Bruce Street is apparently different from that\nused at Lake Drive, and to the extent that they are\ndifferent, the ALJ found that it would be detrimental to I.H.\nBased on his extensive factual findings, the ALJ concluded\nthat the School District did not prove “by a preponderance\n\f                             11\n\n\nof the credible evidence that it can provide I.H. with an\nappropriate education.” S.H. v. Newark Bd. Educ., No.\nEDS7639-99 at 11.\n\n              2.   District Court Proceedings\n   The ALJ issued his decision on October 4, 1999. S.H.\nwent to U.S. District Court seeking fees for the cost of the\nadministrative action on May 24, 2000. On June 8, 2000,\neight months after the ALJ’s decision, the School District\nfiled an answer and counterclaim, for the first time\nchallenging the ALJ’s decision. The matter was referred to\na Magistrate Judge on cross-motions for summary\njudgment. In recommending a decision, the Magistrate\nJudge took no new testimony.\n  In his recommendation, the Magistrate Judge reviewed\nthe facts and arguments of the parties, and summarily\nrejected the testimony of Dr. McKirdy, whose testimony the\nALJ found most persuasive and credible. After recognizing\nthat the standard of review called for giving due weight to\nthe ALJ, the Magistrate Judge conducted a one-paragraph\n“analysis”:\n      On the record before me, I conclude that the defense\n    motion should be granted. I recognize that “due weight”\n    must be afforded to the Administrative Law Judge’s\n    determination. But even granting that weight, I believe\n    the Court’s independent judgment based on a\n    preponderance of the evidence requires a determination\n    that the Administrative Law Judge in this case simply\n    “got it wrong.” It is entirely clear to me that a free and\n    appropriate public education will be provided at the\n    Bruce Street School while affording the least restrictive\n    environment for I.H., as mandated by the applicable\n    law. . . . In short, I find the defendant District’s\n    arguments more persuasive in this case.\nS.H. v. State-Operated Sch. Dist. of Newark, No. 00-2559,\nMag. R & R. at 18-19 (D. N.J. Mar 13, 2001).\n  The District Court adopted the conclusion of the\nMagistrate in a letter opinion. In adopting the\nrecommendation, the District Court added little to the\n\f                               12\n\n\nMagistrate Judge’s recommendation. It found that Bruce\nStreet was the least restrictive environment because of its\nproximity to I.H.’s home and its opportunities for\ninteraction with nondisabled children. In addition, the\nDistrict Court noted that the CST members evaluated I.H.\nand recommended that she attend Bruce Street.\n\n                               II.\n\n                          A.   Issues\n   On appeal, S.H. argues that the District Court did not\nafford the ALJ proper deference as to his findings of fact.\nS.H. also challenges the District Court’s conclusion that the\nproposed IEP would confer a meaningful educational\nbenefit. Finally, S.H. questions whether the School\nDistrict’s counterclaim appealing the ALJ decision was\ntimely.\n\n                   B.

In discussing Pennsylvania’s two-tier system of\nadministrative review in IDEA cases, we stated that the\nappeals panel “should defer to the hearing officer’s findings\nbased on credibility judgments unless the non-testimonial,\nextrinsic evidence in the record would justify a contrary\nconclusion or unless the record read in its entirety would\ncompel a contrary conclusion.” Carlisle, 62 F.3d at 529. A\nfederal district court reviewing the administrative fact finder\nin the first instance is similarly required to defer to the\nALJ’s factual findings unless it can point to contrary non-\ntestimonial extrinsic evidence on the record.3\n  In Oberti v. Board of Education of the Borough of the\nClementon School District, we noted that where the District\nCourt hears additional evidence it is “free to accept or reject\nthe agency findings depending on whether those findings\nare supported by the new, expanded record and whether\n\n3. Under the IDEA, the District Court could have taken additional\nevidence. 20 U.S.C. §1415(e)(2). This case concerns those situations\nwhere the District Court did not hear additional evidence and based its\ndecision on the factual record as developed at the administrative level.\n\f                             14\n\n\nthey are consistent with the requirements of the Act.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609180\"><a href=\"/opinion/609180/rafael-oberti-by-his-parents-and-next-friends-carlos-and-jeanne-oberti/\"><span class=\"volume\">995</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1204</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1220 (3d Cir. 1993). In contrast, where the\nDistrict Court does not hear additional evidence it must\nfind support for any factual conclusions contrary to the\nALJ’s in the record before it. Moreover, the court must\nexplain why it does not accept the ALJ’s findings of fact to\navoid the impression that it is substituting its own notions\nof sound educational policy for those of the agency it\nreviews. See Susan N., 70 F.3d at 757.\n   In addition to the Tenth Circuit and Fourth Circuit’s use\nof the modified de novo standard, the Sixth Circuit has\ndescribed the appropriate standard of review as modified de\nnovo as well. See Knable v. Bexley City Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771862\"><a href=\"/opinion/771862/justin-knable-a-minor-by-and-through-his-mother-and-next-friend-marilyn/\"><span class=\"volume\">238</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">755</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 764 (6th Cir. 2001) (“According to this ‘modified’ de\nnovo standard of review, a district court is required to make\nfindings of fact based on a preponderance of the evidence\ncontained in the complete record, while giving some\ndeference to the fact findings of the administrative\nproceedings.”). We agree with these other courts that the\nappropriate review of the administrative hearing is modified\nde novo.\n\n                             III.\n\n        A.   Application of modified de novo review\n  In cases where we have upheld a District Court’s decision\nto overrule the administrative fact finder, the District Court\nhas fully explained its reasons for departing from the state\ndecision. For example, in Wexler v. Westfield Board of\nEducation, “The district court, in a very thorough opinion,\nanalyzed the evidence in a responsible and sensitive\nfashion. It reviewed all the test results, and all the\nadministrative proceedings, including the transcripts and\nreports. Its findings are detailed and supported by the\nevidence.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"465060\"><a href=\"/opinion/465060/seymour-wexler-and-daisy-wexler-individually-and-on-behalf-of-their-child/\"><span class=\"volume\">784</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 181 (3d Cir. 1986). Similarly in\nGeis v. Board of Education, we noted that “In a thorough\nopinion, the district court [made an independent\ndetermination based on a preponderance of the evidence],\nspecifically citing the evidence in its record and the\nadministrative record that supported its conclusion, as well\n\f                             15\n\n\nas discussing the conflicting evidence.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"458991\"><a href=\"/opinion/458991/geis-robert-and-loretta-geis-v-board-of-education-of-parsippany-troy/\"><span class=\"volume\">774</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 583\n(3d Cir. 1985). In Oberti, the District Court held a three day\ntrial and took new evidence before concluding that the ALJ\nerred. 995 F.2d at 1210.\n  In contrast, the Magistrate Judge here concluded that the\nALJ “simply got it wrong.” Although the report and\nrecommendation adopted by the District Court does set\nforth the arguments from the School District and S.H., it\ndoes not explain why the District Court reached the\nconclusion that the ALJ “simply got it wrong.” The District\nCourt did not address any of the extensive factual findings\nnoted above regarding the deficiencies with the proposed\nIEP. Under the modified de novo standard of review, this\ndoes not accord sufficient deference to the factual\nconclusions of the ALJ.\n\n                B.   Appropriateness of IEP\n   The issue of whether an IEP is appropriate is a question\nof fact. Carlisle, 62 F.3d at 526. Even if the District Court\napplied the wrong standard of review, we may still uphold\nits decision if correct under the appropriate standard of\nreview. See T.R., 205 F.3d at 577 (finding that although the\ndistrict court applied the wrong test, its decision could\nnevertheless be upheld under application of the correct\nstandard.). We review the decision of the ALJ under the\nmodified de novo standard, giving due weight to the ALJ’s\ndecision. The issue is the appropriateness of the IEP\nchanging I.H.’s placement to the Bruce Street School, and\nthe burden is on the School District. We will defer to the\nALJ’s credibility determinations unless countered by non-\ntestimonial evidence on the record.\n  As discussed above, the ALJ noted several deficiencies in\nthe proposed IEP. Taking the ALJ’s factual findings as\nprima facie correct, we must decide whether the record\ncontradicts those factual findings. As the School District\ncorrectly points out, the issue is not a comparison between\nthe Lake Drive School and the Bruce Street School. The\nIDEA does not require the School District to provide I.H.\nwith the best possible education. However, the School\nDistrict does not meet its burden by simply showing that\n\f                              16\n\n\nan appropriate program may be available. Instead, the\nSchool District must show that the proposed IEP will\nprovide I.H. with a meaningful educational benefit. This is\nan individual determination personal to I.H. See\nRidgewood,       172   F.3d   at   248    (determining   the\nappropriateness of an IEP requires “a student-by-student\nanalysis that carefully considers the student’s individual\nabilities.”). The Lake Drive School and its program are only\nan issue as far as they relate to I.H.’s specific situation.\nHere, the School District initially placed I.H. in the Lake\nDrive School. Now, one factor of I.H.’s individual situation\nis her placement at Lake Drive. In other words, if a change\nin her placement will be detrimental, this is a factor in\ndetermining whether the new placement will achieve a\nmeaningful educational benefit.\n\n             1.   Least Restrictive Environment\n  The School District premises much of its argument on\nthe idea that Bruce Street is the least restrictive\nenvironment (LRE). The ALJ found that although Bruce\nStreet is contained within a neighborhood school with\nnondisabled children, its mainstreaming opportunities were\nactually de minimis.\n   We have adopted a two-part test for determining whether\na School District complies with the LRE requirement. The\nfirst step is for the court to determine whether the school\ncan educate the child in a regular classroom with the use\nof supplementary aids and services. If, as here, the child\ncannot be educated in a regular classroom, the next step is\nto decide whether the school is mainstreaming the child to\nthe maximum extent possible. Oberti, 995 F.2d at 1215.\nBefore we reach this two-part test though, we note that the\nchild must be educated in the LRE that will provide a\nmeaningful educational benefit. See T.R., 205 F.3d at 578.\n  In Carlisle, we noted that the LRE would ideally be the\nsame school the child would have attended if she were not\ndisabled. 62 F.3d at 535. However, we prefaced that\nstatement by noting that such placement is only\nappropriate to the extent that it “satisfactorily educates” the\ndisabled child. Id. The School District and District Court’s\n\f                             17\n\n\nemphasis on the LRE requirement here is misplaced. The\nSchool District must first prove that the IEP will provide a\nmeaningful educational benefit. The School District cannot\nbootstrap the meaningful educational benefit with the LRE\nrequirement. The “IDEA requires that disabled students be\neducated in the least restrictive appropriate educational\nenvironment.” Ridgewood, 172 F.3d at 249 (emphasis\nadded). If the educational environment is not appropriate,\nthen there is no need to consider whether it is the least\nrestrictive.\n   Even considering the mainstreaming opportunities the\nSchool District points to, we agree with the ALJ that they\nare de minimis. Other than potential interaction at lunch or\nrecess (in a uniform segregating the Bruce Street students\nfrom the nondisabled students), the School District points\nto art with sign interpreter and “after school sports with\nlate bus” proving Bruce Street is the LRE. App. at A458.\nThe LRE should be considered in light of I.H.’s specific\neducational needs. Geis v. Bd. Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"458991\"><a href=\"/opinion/458991/geis-robert-and-loretta-geis-v-board-of-education-of-parsippany-troy/\"><span class=\"volume\">774</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 583\n(3d Cir. 1985). As the ALJ noted, art with sign interpreter\nwould provide almost no educational benefit to I.H.\nTherefore, any value from mainstreaming is marginal. As to\nthe “after school sports with late bus,” the School District\ndoes not detail to what extent I.H., in kindergarten, would\neven be able to use this program.\n\n            2.   Meaningful Educational Benefit\n   Taking each deficiency noted by the ALJ in turn, the\nevidence on the record does not overcome the ALJ’s factual\nconclusions. For several deficiencies, the School District\ndoes not present any rebuttal and none can be found in the\nrecord. The proposed IEP does not address I.H.’s residual\nhearing, nor does the School District explain why the ALJ’s\nfinding that this is a significant omission is incorrect. The\nIEP refers to use of the Stanford Achievement Test “normed\non the Hearing Impaired.” App. at A455. The School District\ndoes not rebut Dr. McKirdy’s statement that the SAT is not\nan appropriate test for determining I.H.’s performance\nlevels, as the test is not normed for children younger than\neight.\n\f                                  18\n\n\n  The proposed IEP recognizes that I.H.’s progress may\nsuffer without an extended school year. App. at A463\n(“Hearing-impaired children lose a great deal of academic\nground during the summer months . . . when they are not\nin a structured, academic setting.”). Nevertheless, the\nproposed IEP does not address extended school year\nservices.\n   The ALJ found that consistent use of signs, specifically\nrelating to the word order used and the use of connecting\nwords and word endings, was one of the most important\naspects of teaching I.H. English. S.H. v. Newark Bd. Educ.,\nNo. EDS7639-99 at 9-10, ¶ 34-36. A thorough review of the\nrecord supports the ALJ’s conclusion that the School\nDistrict did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence\nthat the communications methods of Bruce Street and Lake\nDrive are the same. The parties agree that both schools\nadhere to the “total communication” philosophy. The\nevidence in the record does not rebut the ALJ’s conclusion\nthat the execution of the total communication philosophy\nwas different between the two schools. Dr. McKirdy testified\nthat Lake Drive stresses the use of connecting words and\nword endings because those words are easily missed.4 The\nschool stresses consistency between teachers and classes to\nassure that the appropriate signs are used. In addition, Dr.\nMcKirdy testified that the school strives for consistency\nwith words for which there is not a formally accepted sign.\nThe School District’s witnesses testified that Bruce Street\nemploys the same philosophy of total communication, but\ndid not contradict the ALJ’s conclusions that there may be\nsignificant differences in the details of the language used.\nCoupled with the ALJ’s finding that I.H. is at an important\nstage in her language acquisition, the record supports the\n\n4. Dr. McKirdy gave the following example in her testimony: “putting the\ns on the end of a word, three balls, plus the plural marker on the end,\nyou would mark a past tense, you would mark . . . good, better, and\nbest, so that the er, est endings on an adjective so that you’re giving\nclues for that. Like a sentence, he walks the dog, versus he walked the\ndog, has hugely different meaning, which you use a signed marker to\nshow that it’s either active or happened in the past.”\nApp. at A276.\n\f                             19\n\n\nALJ’s conclusion that differences in the program may be\ndetrimental to I.H.\n  The non-testimonial evidence on the record does not\ncontradict the ALJ’s factual findings. Therefore, we accept\nthem as correct. In light of his factual findings, the ALJ’s\nconclusion that the School District did not prove by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the proposed IEP would\nconvey a meaningful educational benefit is not in error.\n\n                       C.   Timeliness\n   S.H. also challenges the timeliness of the School\nDistrict’s challenge to the ALJ’s decision. The District Court\ndid not address this issue. The IDEA does not contain a\nstatute of limitations relating to these suits. In Tokarcik v.\nForest Hills School District, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"397379\"><a href=\"/opinion/397379/amber-tokarcik-a-minor-by-nileleen-n-tokarcik-her-parent-and-natural/\"><span class=\"volume\">665</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1981), we\ndecided that, under Pennsylvania law, either a two-year or\nsix year statute of limitations applies. We have followed this\ndecision in later cases. See, e.g., Jeremy H. v. Mount\nLebanon Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"726069\"><a href=\"/opinion/726069/jeremy-h-a-minor-by-his-father-and-next-friend-we-hunter-we-hunter/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 280 (3d Cir. 1996). In\nRidgewood, we held that the appropriate statute of\nlimitations for a parent to appeal an adverse administrative\ndecision under the IDEA in New Jersey is two years. 172\nF.3d at 251. We have also held that the time to initiate the\nadministrative procedure is a question of equity and that\nthe parents must initiate proceedings within a reasonable\ntime. Bernardsville Bd. Educ. v. J.H., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684087\"><a href=\"/opinion/684087/bernardsville-board-of-education-v-jh-individually-and-on-behalf-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 157-60\n(3d Cir. 1994).\n   S.H. suggests that we should extend this equitable\nprinciple to determining the appropriate time for the school\nto appeal from an adverse administrative decision. S.H.’s\nconcerns are understandable. New Jersey clearly seeks\nprompt settlement of these disputes by imposing a 45-day\nlimit on the time the ALJ may take to decide. Here, the ALJ\npromptly issued a decision as to the 1999-2000 IEP early in\nthe school year. It was not until May 26, 2000 that S.H.\nsought attorneys’ fees. This was after the May 16, 2000 IEP\ndevelopment meeting for the 2000-01 school year where the\nSchool District apparently suggested continuing placement\nat Lake Drive. Only after S.H. sought attorneys’ fees did the\nSchool District challenge the ALJ’s decision. Nevertheless,\n\f                              20\n\n\nwe are not inclined to parse our earlier decisions in an\nattempt to carve out a new statute of limitations here.\n   While we do not adopt S.H.’s suggestion to impose a\nshorter statute of limitation, we do note that the School\nDistrict’s delay should have an impact on the remedy. The\nSchool District suggests that if we uphold the ALJ’s\ndecision that the IEP is inappropriate, the proper remedy is\nto allow it to revise its IEP to properly address the\nplacement at Bruce Street. Were we to follow the School\nDistrict’s suggestion, we would strip the attorney fee\nprovisions of the IDEA of any effectiveness in similar cases.\nWe are addressing only the 1999 proposed IEP. If the\nSchool District can “correct” the IEP in 2003 (or any time\nafter the 1999-2000 school year) and then claim that the\nstudent has not prevailed, plaintiffs in these cases could\nnever recover attorneys’ fees. This is clearly not the\nintention of Congress in providing for attorneys’ fees in the\nIDEA. Had the School District promptly appealed the case\nfollowing the ALJ decision, and had it lost, it may have\nbeen able to present an IEP showing that I.H. would receive\na meaningful educational benefit at Bruce Street.\n\n                              IV.\n   The School District did not prove by a preponderance of\nthe evidence that the proposed IEP would afford I.H. with a\nfree and appropriate education. Therefore, the judgment of\nthe District Court in favor of the School is reversed and we\nremand this case with instructions to enter judgment in\nfavor of S.H.\n\nA True Copy:\n        Teste:\n\n                   Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n                               for the Third Circuit\n\f\f</pre>",
