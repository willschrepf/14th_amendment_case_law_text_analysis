Accordingly, pursuant to MCR 7.302(G)(1), in lieu of granting leave to appeal,\n\n we reverse the decision of the Workers’ Compensation Appellate Commission (WCAC)\n\fand remand this case to the WCAC for resolution of this case consistent with the law in\n\neffect before the Karaczewski decision.\n\n                      I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       In 1998, plaintiff Andre Bezeau, a professional hockey player, signed a three-year\n\ncontract with the Detroit Vipers, a professional hockey team owned by defendant Palace\n\nSports & Entertainment, Inc. At the time, plaintiff was a resident of Michigan, and the\n\ncontract was signed in Michigan.\n\n       In June 2000, plaintiff fell from a 45-foot ladder while working at his father’s\n\nroofing company in New Brunswick, Canada. As a result of the fall, he injured his groin,\n\nlower back, and right thigh. Plaintiff stayed in New Brunswick to receive treatment for\n\nhis injuries, and he became a resident of New Brunswick.\n\n       In October 2000, the Detroit Vipers loaned plaintiff to the Providence Bruins, a\n\nprofessional hockey team located in Rhode Island. In the first game of the 2000-2001\n\nseason, which took place in Rhode Island, another player struck plaintiff, aggravating his\n\ninjury. Plaintiff left the game and has been unable to play hockey since the incident.\n\n       In June 2001, plaintiff applied for workers’ compensation benefits in Michigan.\n\nHe claimed that he had developed osteitis pubis as a result of playing professional\n\nhockey. A hearing was held before a magistrate in the Worker’s Compensation Board of\n\nMagistrates. The magistrate ruled in February 2003 that although plaintiff was disabled,\n\nthere was no persuasive evidence that the incident at the October 2000 hockey game in\n\nRhode Island caused plaintiff’s disabling injuries or aggravated any preexisting injuries.\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f       Plaintiff appealed the decision to the WCAC, which reversed the magistrate’s\n\nfindings. The WCAC panel found that the incident at the October 2000 hockey game\n\nwas a contributing factor, among many, to plaintiff’s disability. The WCAC granted\n\nplaintiff an open award of benefits.\n\n       Defendant appealed the WCAC’s decision in the Court of Appeals. In February\n\n2006, the Court of Appeals issued an unpublished opinion vacating the decision of the\n\nWCAC and remanding the case to the WCAC to “determine whether plaintiff asserted an\n\n‘aggravation’ or ‘contribution’ theory at trial, whether such a theory was properly raised\n\non appeal, and, if so, whether an award of benefits is proper under Rakestraw [v Gen\n\nDynamics Land Systems, Inc, 469 Mich 220; 666 NW2d 199 (2003)].” Bezeau v Palace\n\nSports & Entertainment, Inc, unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals,\n\nissued February 28, 2006 (Docket No. 258350), p 5.\n\n       On remand from the Court of Appeals, the WCAC issued a decision in October\n\n2006 remanding the case to the board of magistrates to determine whether plaintiff’s\n\ncondition after the October 2000 hockey-game incident was medically distinguishable\n\nfrom his condition before the incident.\n\n       Meanwhile in May 2007, while the remand to the board of magistrates in the\n\ninstant case was pending, this Court issued the opinion in Karaczewski on the\n\njurisdictional requirements for workers’ compensation claims brought in Michigan. In\n\nKaraczewski, this Court overruled the interpretation of MCL 418.845 set forth in Boyd v\n\nW G Wade Shows, 443 Mich 515; 505 NW2d 544 (1993), and described what it termed\n\nan abrogation of the statute by Boyd’s precursor, Roberts v I X L Glass Corp, 259 Mich\n\n\n                                            3\n\f644; 244 NW 188 (1932). Karaczewski, 478 Mich at 30, 39-41. The new interpretation\n\nof MCL 418.845 set forth in Karaczewski stated that for Michigan workers’\n\ncompensation laws to apply to a claim for benefits, the injured employee must have been\n\na resident of Michigan at the time of the injury and the contract for hire must have been\n\nmade in Michigan.1       Id. at 33, 44.   Under Boyd and Roberts, Michigan workers’\n\ncompensation laws applied to claims for benefits even if the injured employee was not a\n\nresident of Michigan as long as the contract for hire was made in Michigan. See id. at 34,\n\n37-38.\n\n         As a result of the Karaczewski decision, defendant argued that the board of\n\nmagistrates did not have subject-matter jurisdiction because plaintiff was a resident of\n\nNew Brunswick at the time of the October 2000 incident. The magistrate agreed and\n\ndismissed plaintiff’s claim for benefits. Plaintiff appealed to the WCAC, which affirmed\n\nthe magistrate’s decision. Plaintiff applied for leave to appeal in the Court of Appeals,\n\nwhich denied leave to appeal in an unpublished order entered September 5, 2008 (Docket\n\nNo. 285593).\n\n         Plaintiff applied for leave to appeal in this Court. We ordered oral argument on\n\nthe application, directing the parties to address “whether the jurisdictional standard\n\n\n\n         1\n          The Legislature has since amended MCL 418.845 to now make it clearly\napplicable to out-of-state injuries. See 2008 PA 499, effective January 13, 2009. In this\ncase, as an alternative to overruling Karaczewski, plaintiff asks that we consider applying\n2008 PA 499 retroactively. However, we do not reach that question in this case because\nwe overrule the retroactivity of Karaczewski that applied to parties in plaintiff’s position\nof having suffered an injury before Karaczewski was decided.\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\festablished at MCL 418.845, as interpreted by this Court in Karaczewski v Farbman\n\nStein & Co, 478 Mich 28 (2007), should be applied in this case.”2\n\n                             II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n      Whether this Court’s decision in a previous case should be overruled is a question\n\nof law that this Court reviews de novo. Bush v Shabahang, 484 Mich 156, 164; 772\n\nNW2d 272 (2009).\n\n                                    III. ANALYSIS\n\n                        A. THE DECISION IN KARACZEWSKI\n\n      Karaczewski involved an employee whose contract for hire was made in\n\nMichigan, but who became a resident of another state after his employer transferred him.\n\nThe employee was injured on the job while in the other state. Karaczewski, 478 Mich at\n\n30. He filed a claim for workers’ compensation benefits in Michigan. Id. at 31.\n\n      The defendants in Karaczewski argued that under the plain language of the\n\nMichigan Worker’s Disability Compensation Act, the employee’s claim was not subject\n\nto the jurisdiction of the Michigan’s Workers’ Compensation Agency because the\n\nemployee was not a resident of Michigan at the time of the injury. Id. at 58. The WCAC\n\nand Court of Appeals agreed with the defendants that the plain language of the relevant\n\nstatute, MCL 418.845, would preclude the employee from bringing his claim in\n\nMichigan. Id. at 31-32. However, both the WCAC and the Court of Appeals noted that\n\n\n\n      2\n          Bezeau v Palace Sports & Entertainment, Inc, 483 Mich 1001, 1001-1002\n(2009).\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\fthey were unable to rule in the defendants’ favor under the binding Michigan Supreme\n\nCourt precedents of Boyd and Roberts. Id. at 32.\n\n       In Boyd, this Court interpreted MCL 418.845 when faced with a similar situation\n\ninvolving an employee whose contract for hire was made in Michigan but who was\n\ninjured and died on the job while a resident of another state. Boyd, 443 Mich at 516. The\n\nCourt examined MCL 418.845 and Roberts, a case interpreting a predecessor of MCL\n\n418.845. Id. at 517-520. The Boyd Court held that, “pursuant to [MCL 418.845] and\n\nRoberts v IXL Glass Corp, supra, the Bureau of Workers’ Disability Compensation shall\n\nhave jurisdiction over extraterritorial injuries without regard to the employee's residence,\n\nprovided the contract of employment was entered into in this state with a resident\n\nemployer.” Id. at 526.\n\n       This Court granted leave in Karaczewski to determine whether overruling Boyd\n\nwould be justified.3 Analyzing the plain language of MCL 418.845, a majority of this\n\nCourt held that the statute “confers jurisdiction on the Bureau of Worker’s\n\nCompensation, now the Workers’ Compensation Agency, for out-of-state workplace\n\ninjuries only if (1) the employee is a resident of Michigan when the injury occurs and (2)\n\nthe contract of hire was made in Michigan.”         Karaczewski, 478 Mich at 30.        The\n\nKaraczewski Court’s interpretation of MCL 418.845 directly conflicted with this Court’s\n\ninterpretation of the same statute in Boyd, and thus this Court overruled Boyd. Id. Over\n\n\n\n\n       3\n           Karaczewski v Farbman Stein & Co, 474 Mich 1087 (2006).\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fthe objections of three justices, the majority in Karaczewski gave retroactive effect to its\n\nnew interpretation of MCL 418.845. Karaczewski, Id. at 44 n 15.\n\n       In general, this Court’s decisions are given full retroactive effect. Pohutski v City\n\nof Allen Park, 465 Mich 675, 695; 641 NW2d 219 (2002). However, there are exceptions\n\nto this rule. This Court should adopt a more flexible approach if injustice would result\n\nfrom full retroactivity. Id. at 696. Prospective application may be appropriate where the\n\nholding overrules settled precedent. Id. As stated in Pohutski:\n\n               This Court adopted from Linkletter v Walker, 381 US 618; 85 S Ct\n       1731, 14 L Ed 2d 601 (1965), three factors to be weighed in determining\n       when a decision should not have retroactive application. Those factors are:\n       (1) the purpose to be served by the new rule, (2) the extent of reliance on\n       the old rule, and (3) the effect of retroactivity on the administration of\n       justice. People v Hampton, 384 Mich 669, 674; 187 NW2d 404 (1971). In\n       the civil context, a plurality of this Court noted that Chevron Oil v Huson,\n       404 US 97, 106-107; 92 S Ct 349; 30 L Ed 2d 296 (1971), recognized an\n       additional threshold question whether the decision clearly established a new\n       principle of law. Riley v Northland Geriatric Center (After Remand), 431\n       Mich 632, 645-646; 433 NW2d 787 (1988) (GRIFFIN, J.). [Id.]\n\n       In determining whether Karaczewski was incorrectly given retroactive effect, we\n\nmust first answer the threshold question whether Karaczewski clearly established a new\n\nprinciple of law. The decision in Karaczewski to overrule Boyd established a new\n\ninterpretation of MCL 418.845 that broke from the longstanding interpretation of the\n\nstatute. Although the Court interpreted the statute consistently with its plain language,\n\nthe Court’s interpretation established a new rule of law because it affected how the statute\n\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\fwould be applied to parties in workers’ compensation cases in a way that was\n\ninconsistent with how the statute had been previously applied.4\n\n       Given that Karaczewski established a new rule of law, we now weigh the factors\n\nset forth in Pohutski to determine whether Karaczewski was correctly given retroactive\n\napplication. First, we determine the purpose to be served by the new rule. The majority\n\nin Karaczewski overruled Boyd because the Boyd interpretation of MCL 418.845 failed to\n\nrecognize that the statute’s text required that an injured employee must have been a\n\nresident of Michigan at the time of the injury and the contract for hire must have been\n\nmade in Michigan in order for the employee to be able to successfully file a workers’\n\ncompensation claim in Michigan. Thus, the purpose of the new rule was to interpret the\n\nlaw consistently with the Legislature’s apparent intent when drafting MCL 418.845.\n\n       The next two factors to consider in determining whether Karaczewski was\n\ncorrectly applied retroactively are reliance interests on the old rule of law under Boyd and\n\nthe effect of Karaczewski’s retroactivity on the administration of justice. The concurring\n\nand dissenting justices in Karaczewski noted that the decision to give Karaczewski\n\nretroactive effect would seriously undermine the reliance interests of parties regarding the\n\nBoyd/Roberts decisions. Justice KELLY stated in her dissent that “[t]here are significant\n\nreliance concerns implicated by the overturning of Roberts and Boyd. The underlying\n\nrationale of these cases has been in place for seven decades. Attorneys, employers,\n\n\n       4\n           Pohutski, 465 Mich at 696-697.\n\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\finsurance carriers, and various employees have relied on the holdings of Roberts and\n\nBoyd.” Karaczewski, 478 Mich at 62 (KELLY, J., dissenting).            Furthermore, Justice\n\nWEAVER noted in her opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part:\n\n               [T]here has been extensive reliance for 14 years on Boyd’s\n       interpretation of MCL 418.845. In addition to reliance by the courts,\n       insurance decisions have undoubtedly been predicated on this Court's\n       longstanding interpretation of MCL 418.845 under Boyd. Nonresident\n       injured employees, like plaintiff, who initially entered into contracts for\n       hire in Michigan, but later agreed to work outside Michigan, have relied on\n       the ability to obtain workers' compensation benefits based on their\n       employment relationship with Michigan employers.               Prospective\n       application acknowledges that reliance and assures the fair resolution of\n       those pending workers' compensation cases. [Id. at 46 (WEAVER, J.,\n       concurring in part and dissenting in part).]\n\n       In addition to Karaczewski’s failure to give due weight to that reliance on Boyd\n\nand Roberts, the dissenting justices noted that retroactivity would result in a disruption in\n\nthe administration of justice. Id. (WEAVER, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part);\n\nid. at 62 (KELLY, J., dissenting).      As the instant case shows, it appears that the\n\nKaraczewski decision has disrupted the administration of justice in cases that came under\n\nKaraczewski’s retroactive effect. Plaintiff first filed his claim in 2001, and the parties\n\nspent six years going through the appellate process to the Court of Appeals and back to\n\nthe board of magistrates without having any argument over jurisdictional questions\n\nregarding MCL 418.845. While the case was on remand at the board of magistrates in\n\n2007, Karaczewski was decided and defendant raised the jurisdictional issue for the first\n\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\ftime in the tribunal.5 Because a long-settled part of this well-traveled case suddenly\n\nbecame a new issue and the six years of work expended on this case became moot, we\n\nconclude that Karaczewski’s retroactive effect disrupted the administration of justice.\n\n       Because the Karaczewski decision on retroactivity did not give due weight to the\n\ninterests of employers and employees relying on the well-established law of Boyd and\n\nRoberts, and because it did not give due weight to its effect on the administration of\n\njustice, we conclude that the decision to give retroactivity to Karaczewski was\n\nerroneous.6\n\n                                   B. STARE DECISIS\n\n       Having established that retroactive effect was erroneous, we next decide whether\n\nthis Court should overrule the decision that gave retroactive effect to Karaczewski. This\n\nCourt generally adheres to the principle of stare decisis. Robinson v Detroit, 462 Mich\n\n\n       5\n          Defendant did include a defense in its answer to plaintiff’s initial application for\nworkers’ compensation benefits, claiming that Michigan law did not cover the claim\nbecause the injury occurred in Rhode Island. However, defendant did not raise the issue\nat the hearing before the magistrate or at any appellate stage through the next six years\nuntil after Karaczewski was decided.\n       6\n          The purpose of the new rule from Karaczewski—interpreting the law\nconsistently with the Legislature’s apparent intent when drafting MCL 418.845—must\nalso be given weight. As can be seen from the concurrences of the justices signing this\nopinion, some of the justices in the majority agree with Justice YOUNG’s dissent that\nKaraczewski correctly interpreted the language of the statute, and some justices disagree\nwith Karaczewski’s interpretation of the statute. Nevertheless, we all conclude that the\neffect of retroactivity on the Pohutski factors of reliance and disruption of the\nadministration of justice outweigh the effects of retroactivity that in fact resulted from\nKaraczewski’s interpretation. In this instance, we find that the correct interpretation of a\nstatute is better given prospective application when retroactive application seriously\nundermines parties’ reliance on the rule of law and disrupts the administration of justice.\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\f439, 463; 613 NW2d 307 (2000). However, we should reexamine precedent when\n\nlegitimate questions have been raised about the correctness of a decision. Id. at 464.\n\nUpon such reexamination, our first step is to determine whether the precedent was\n\nwrongly decided. Id. Should we determine that precedent was wrongly decided, we also\n\n“examine the effects of overruling, including most importantly the effect on reliance\n\ninterests and whether overruling would work an undue hardship because of that reliance.”\n\nId. at 466. “As to the reliance interest, the Court must ask whether the previous decision\n\nhas become so embedded, so accepted, so fundamental, to everyone’s expectations that to\n\nchange it would produce not just readjustments, but practical real-world dislocations.”\n\nId.\n\n       As we have explained earlier, we conclude that giving retroactive effect to this\n\nCourt’s holding in Karaczewski was an erroneous decision. Having determined that the\n\nretroactivity holding was wrongly decided, we next turn to the reliance interests involved.\n\n       In this case, we are only reviewing the effect of retroactively applying\n\nKaraczewski’s interpretation of MCL 418.845. By its nature, the retroactivity applied\n\nonly to claims based on injuries that occurred before the date Karaczewski was decided.\n\nAt the time of the Karaczewski decision, the workers’ compensation system was\n\noperating under the prior precedent of Boyd and Roberts regarding jurisdictional\n\nquestions under MCL 418.845.        At the time of the Karaczewski decision, the only\n\nreliance on law regarding MCL 418.845 by parties was a reliance on the Boyd and\n\nRoberts precedents. There could not have been reliance on the law of the Karaczewski\n\ndecision for claims based on injuries that occurred before Karaczewski because\n\n\n                                            11\n\fKaraczewski was decided after the bases for those claims had arisen. Thus, we find no\n\nreliance interests regarding the retroactive effect of Karaczewski on claims in which the\n\ninjuries had occurred on or before the date Karaczewski was decided.\n\n      Our next step in examining whether the retroactive effect of Karaczewski should\n\nbe overruled is to determine whether overruling that effect will result in any undue\n\nhardships for parties involved in cases affected by our decision. As we have noted, the\n\nparties involved in cases affected by this decision had no reliance interests involving\n\nKaraczewski. By overruling the retroactivity of Karaczewski, the only effect on those\n\nparties is that their cases will be governed by the precedents that governed their claims\n\nwhen the bases for those claims first arose. We believe that such an effect is not an\n\nundue hardship on the parties because they are simply returning to the status quo for their\n\nclaims.\n\n      Further justification for overruling the retroactivity of Karaczewski can be found\n\nin the inequity in the instant case, which arose as a result of the retroactivity holding.\n\nWhen the instant case was filed, the Boyd and Roberts interpretations of MCL 418.845\n\nclearly governed the case, and plaintiff met the requirements of those interpretations.\n\nThe Boyd and Roberts interpretations remained the governing interpretations of MCL\n\n418.845 for more than six years while the case made its way from the board of\n\nmagistrates to the WCAC, then to the Court of Appeals, then back to the WCAC on\n\nremand and, finally, back to the board of magistrates.       During the entire appellate\n\nprocess, the interpretation of MCL 418.845 was not an issue in this case. But when the\n\ncase was before the board of magistrates on remand to determine an entirely unrelated\n\n\n                                            12\n\ffactual matter, this Court handed down the Karaczewski decision, overruling the Boyd\n\nand Roberts interpretations for all cases in which there had not been a final judgment.\n\nThe Karaczewski decision therefore changed the law of this case in the middle of the\n\nappellate process without the parties having raised any issue regarding that specific point\n\nof law. We find that outcome to be inequitable, and thus we feel that it should be\n\nreversed.\n\n       We have concluded that the factors for overruling precedent laid out in Robinson\n\nweigh in favor of overruling the retroactivity holding of Karaczewski. Moreover, we\n\nhave found further justification for overruling the retroactivity holding as a result of the\n\ninequity that has arisen in this case.        Accordingly, we overrule the holding of\n\nKaraczewski that gave retroactive effect to its decision.\n\n       It should be particularly noted that our holding today affects only claims based on\n\ninjuries that occurred on or before the date this Court decided Karaczewski, as long as the\n\nclaim has not already reached final resolution in the court system. We do not overrule\n\nany aspect of the Karaczewski opinion other than its retroactive effect. Contrary to the\n\nassertions in Justice YOUNG’s dissent, which Justices CORRIGAN and MARKMAN also\n\njoin, there is no majority to overrule Karaczewski in its entirety. We note that Chief\n\nJustice KELLY concurs with this opinion in part and dissents in part because she would in\n\nfact completely overrule Karaczewski. Six justices have chosen not to agree with Chief\n\nJustice KELLY’s position to completely overrule Karaczewski, and as a result, the\n\nportrayal of the lead opinion contained in Justice YOUNG’s dissent is inaccurate.\n\nKaraczewski’s interpretation of MCL 418.845 remains the law of this state for claims\n\n\n                                             13\n\fbased on injuries that occurred after the date that Karaczewski was decided but before the\n\neffective date of the amendment of MCL 418.845 by enacting 2008 PA 499.\n\n                                   IV. CONCLUSION\n\n      We reverse the decision of the WCAC. We overrule this Court’s decision to give\n\nretroactive effect to Karaczewski because the decision was erroneous, overruling it will\n\nnot affect any reliance interests of the parties affected by our decision, and no undue\n\nhardship will occur as a result of our decision. Our holding affects claims based on\n\ninjuries that occurred on or before the date this Court decided Karaczewski, as long as the\n\nclaim has not already reached final resolution in the court system. Accordingly, we\n\nremand this case to the WCAC to continue proceedings consistent with its actions before\n\nthe Karaczewski decision.\n\n      Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n      HATHAWAY, J., concurred with WEAVER, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                            14\n\f                            STATE OF MICHIGAN\n\n                                    SUPREME COURT\n\n\nANDRE BEZEAU,\n\n             Plaintiff-Appellant,\n\nv                                                           No. 137500\n\nPALACE SPORTS & ENTERTAINMENT,\nINC.,\n\n             Defendant-Appellee.\n\n\nCAVANAGH, J. (concurring).\n\n      I concur in the result, and I join the lead opinion in full except for part III(B). I\n\nagree that the interpretation of MCL 418.845 adopted in Karaczewski v Farbman Stein &\n\nCo, 478 Mich 28; 732 NW2d 56 (2007), should only have been applied prospectively and\n\nthat Karaczewski should be overruled to the extent that it held otherwise.         I write\n\nseparately because whereas the lead opinion applies the stare decisis approach from\n\nRobinson v Detroit, 462 Mich 439, 463-468; 613 NW2d 307 (2000), I continue to prefer\n\nthe modified version of this approach articulated by Chief Justice KELLY in Petersen v\n\nMagna Corp, 484 Mich 300, 316-320; 773 NW2d 564 (2009) (opinion by KELLY, C.J.).\n\nThe result, however, is the same.\n\n      Under my preferred approach to stare decisis, there is a presumption in favor of\n\nupholding precedent that may be rebutted only if there is a compelling justification to\n\noverturn precedent. Id. at 317. In determining whether a compelling justification exists,\n\fcourts may use a number of evaluative criteria if relevant but, importantly, a compelling\n\njustification requires more than a mere belief that a case was wrongly decided.1 Id. at\n\n319-320. In this case, the narrow question presented is whether there is a compelling\n\njustification to overrule the Karaczewski majority’s decision to apply its interpretation of\n\nMCL 418.845 retroactively.\n\n       One criterion is particularly relevant to this question: the extent of reliance on the\n\nprior interpretation of MCL 418.845 and the extent to which overruling it might cause\n\nspecial hardship and inequity. See id. at 320. Although the reliance interests usually\n\nweigh against overruling a decision or, at best, are neutral, this case presents the unusual\n\nsituation in which the reliance interests weigh in favor of overruling a decision.2 As\n\nnoted in the lead opinion, the cases that will be affected by prospective application of\n\nKaraczewski are only those involving injuries that occurred before Karaczewski was\n\ndecided. In those cases, overruling Karaczewski’s retroactive application and restoring\n\nthe pre-Karaczewski status quo is in accordance with the reliance interests.3 In fact,\n\n\n       1\n        In Petersen, Chief Justice KELLY provided a list of criteria that courts may use to\nconsider whether there is a compelling justification, but the list is nonexhaustive and\nnone of the criteria are determinative. They only need to be evaluated if relevant. See\nPetersen, 484 Mich at 320 (opinion by KELLY, C.J.).\n       2\n          Indeed, the usual tensions present in a stare decisis analysis are absent in this\ncase. Generally, stare decisis balances two concerns: “the need of the community for\nstability in legal rules and decisions and the need of courts to correct past errors.” Id. at\n314. In this case, however, both concerns are advanced by overruling the retroactive\napplication of Karaczewski.\n       3\n        As stated by then Justice KELLY in Karaczewski, the essential rationale of the\npre-Karaczewski interpretation of MCL 418.845 had been in place for seven decades and\nwas an essential part of the workers’ compensation regime in Michigan, such that\n                                                                        (continued…)\n\n                                             2\n\finequity and hardship could result if the retroactivity of Karaczewski is not overturned.\n\nThis is demonstrated by this case, in which the parties, relying on the pre-Karaczewski\n\nstatus of the law, had been litigating the merits of the case for six years when\n\nKaraczewski was decided. Thus, because I think that the reliance interests formed in this\n\nand other similar cases constitute a compelling justification to overrule precedent, I\n\nconcur in the majority’s decision to overrule the retroactive application of Karaczewski’s\n\ninterpretation of the statute.\n\n\n                                                       Michael F.

(concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n\n      I concur with the majority opinion that Karaczewski v Farbman Stein & Co1\n\nshould never have been applied retroactively.      I would overrule Karaczewski in its\n\nentirety because I continue to believe that it should not have overruled Boyd v W G Wade\n\nShows2 and Roberts v I X L Glass Corp.3 As I stated in my dissent in Karaczewski,\n\nduring the 74 years that Roberts was controlling law, the Legislature took no steps to\n\nchange or amend MCL 418.845.4 Again, when this Court affirmed that interpretation of\n\nMCL 418.845 in Boyd, the Legislature did nothing.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          Karaczewski v Farbman Stein & Co, 478 Mich 28; 732 NW2d 56 (2007).\n      2\n          Boyd v W G Wade Shows, 443 Mich 515; 505 NW2d 544 (1993).\n      3\n          Roberts v I X L Glass Corp, 259 Mich 644; 244 NW 188 (1932).\n      4\n          Karaczewski, 478 Mich at 46-47 (KELLY, J., dissenting).\n\f       Only after this Court upset 74 years of law in Karaczewski did the Legislature\n\nspeak by enacting 2008 PA 499. It abrogated Karaczewski scarcely more than two years\n\nafter it was decided.5 Although some discard any use of legislative acquiescence as a tool\n\nfor interpreting legislative intent, it is difficult to take issue with the fact that the\n\nLegislature took explicit action here.\n\n       Furthermore, I believe that the Robinson factors clearly call for overruling\n\nKaraczewski.6 First, as discussed previously, the enactment of 2008 PA 499 was a\n\nchange in the law that undercut and undermined the original basis for the decision.\n\nAllowing the central holding of Karaczewski to remain intact has a disturbing effect. It\n\ndisenfranchises the unfortunate group of out-of-state workers with contracts for hire\n\nmade in Michigan who were injured on the job after Karaczewski was decided but before\n\n\n\n\n       5\n         See House Legislative Analysis, SB 1596, December 11, 2008 (stating that “the\nMichigan Supreme Court reversed longstanding case law” in Karaczewski and\n“eliminated coverage for injuries that had previously been covered under the act,\nreducing compensation for injured workers, and causing potential problems for\nemployers”); Senate Legislative Analysis, SB 1596, November 12, 2008 (explaining that\nthe purpose of 2008 PA 499 is to restore the Workers’ Compensation Agency’s\njurisdiction in response to Karaczewski).\n      I recognize that 2008 PA 499 ultimately expanded jurisdiction in workers’\ncompensation cases beyond where it had been before Karaczewski. But the legislative\nanalyses make clear that the amendment was in direct response to Karaczewski and\nsought to restore jurisdiction to the Workers’ Compensation Agency.\n       6\n           Robinson v Detroit, 462 Mich 439; 613 NW2d 307 (2000).\n      I remain committed to the stare decisis factors I proposed in Petersen v Magna\nCorp, 484 Mich 300, 317-320; 773 NW2d 564 (2009), and I believe that this Court\nshould adopt those factors.\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\f2008 PA 499 went into effect. I believe that 2008 PA 499 is evidence that the Legislature\n\ndid not intend to arbitrarily deprive this group of benefits.\n\n       Second, overturning Karaczewski would not work an undue hardship. Reliance on\n\nit has been minimal, given that it was decided recently. Because it displaced 74 years of\n\nprecedent in Michigan, it is not “so embedded, so accepted, so fundamental, to\n\neveryone’s expectations” that overruling it would result in “significant dislocations.”7\n\nKaraczewski itself displaced reliance interests by overturning a fundamental part of the\n\nworkers’ compensation regime, even if only for a brief period, thanks to the Legislature’s\n\nquick enactment of 2008 PA 499.8\n\n       I believe these compelling justifications necessitate that this Court overrule\n\nKaraczewski. Accordingly, while I concur with the majority that Karaczewski does not\n\napply retroactively, I would overrule it entirely.\n\n\n                                                          Marilyn Kelly\n\n\n\n\n       7\n           Robinson, 462 Mich at 466.\n       8\n        See Karaczewski, 478 Mich at 51-61 (KELLY, J. dissenting) (discussing the\nRobinson factors as applied to Roberts and Boyd and finding that not a single factor\nsupported overruling them).\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f                            STATE OF MICHIGAN\n\n                                    SUPREME COURT\n\n\nANDRE BEZEAU,\n\n             Plaintiff-Appellant,\n\nv                                                           No. 137500\n\nPALACE SPORTS & ENTERTAINMENT,\nINC.,\n\n             Defendant-Appellee.\n\n\nWEAVER, J. (concurring).\n\n      I concur fully in and sign the lead opinion reversing the decision of the Workers’\n\nCompensation Appellate Commission (WCAC), remanding this case to the WCAC, and\n\noverruling the holding of Karaczewski v Farbman Stein & Co, 478 Mich 28; 732 NW2d\n\n56 (2007), that gave the Karaczewski decision retroactive effect.\n\n      I write separately to correct the mistaken assertions in Justice YOUNG’s dissent,\n\nwhich is signed by Justices CORRIGAN and MARKMAN,1 including the mistaken assertions\n\nof these “remaining three” regarding my position on stare decisis.\n\n      The dissent attempts to characterize the majority’s opinion and decision not to\n\napply Karaczewski retroactively as a decision to effectively overrule Karaczewski. This\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          Justices CORRIGAN, YOUNG, and MARKMAN comprise “the remaining three”\njustices of the former “majority of four,” which included former Chief Justice TAYLOR.\n\fcharacterization is not only incorrect and inaccurate, it is misleading and intellectually\n\ndeceptive.\n\n       Further, the dissent’s attempt to characterize the lead opinion as being\n\nrepresentative of a so-called new philosophical majority is also false.         There is no\n\nphilosophical majority in this case. While the justices forming the majority each agreed\n\nwith the result in this case, each justice reached his or her conclusion based on different\n\nreasons.2\n\n       It appears that the dissent is attempting to lump together the four justices who\n\nagree with parts of the lead opinion into having had some sort of previously stated\n\nfidelity to stare decisis that those justices have abandoned since former Chief Justice\n\nTAYLOR’s overwhelming defeat in the 2008 election.\n\n       The dissent quotes various past statements, made by those justices signing portions\n\nof the lead opinion, regarding stare decisis and criticizing the former “majority of four”\n\n(former Chief Justice TAYLOR, and Justices CORRIGAN, YOUNG, and MARKMAN). With\n\n       2\n         The dissent attempts to make an argument that there is some sort of philosophical\nmajority that wants to overrule Karaczewski in its entirety. However, one need look no\nfurther than the various opinions written in this case to see that there is no such majority\nfor that proposition. When Karaczewski was decided in 2007, I concurred in the\nsubstance of the opinion, and I continue to see nothing wrong with its statutory analysis.\nOn the other hand, Chief Justice KELLY is dissenting in part from the lead opinion in this\ncase for the very reason that she thinks Karaczewski needs to be completely overruled.\nHer position is understandable, given that she dissented from the entire decision in 2007\nwhen Karaczewski was decided. But there are currently not four votes for her position,\nso her position is not the majority’s position. Rather, there are in essence six justices who\nhave for whatever reason decided not to join with the Chief Justice’s position to overrule\nall of Karaczewski in this case. The dissent simply ignores that fact for the convenience\nof making the mistaken conclusions in the dissenting opinion seem more palatable.\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\frespect to myself, the dissent quotes a statement I made in response to the improper and\n\nunfair dismantling of decades of longstanding insurance contract law by the former\n\n“majority of four” in Devillers v Auto Club Ins Ass’n, 473 Mich 562; 702 NW2d 539\n\n(2005). In Devillers, I stated, “Correction for correction’s sake does not make sense.\n\nThe case has not been made why the Court should not adhere to the doctrine of stare\n\ndecisis in this case.” Id. at 622 (WEAVER, J., dissenting) (emphasis added).\n\n       The dissent’s use of my Devillers statement appears to be a weak attempt to\n\nmanufacture some sort of story to try to get people to believe that a philosophical\n\nmajority of justices exists and is out to overrule precedent created by the “majority of\n\nfour.” The dissent’s mistaken assertions that I have somehow changed my view of stare\n\ndecisis since former Chief Justice TAYLOR was defeated and that I am part of a\n\nphilosophical majority are simply incorrect.\n\n       My Devillers statement itself shows that I was criticizing the disregard for stare\n\ndecisis in that specific case. My Devillers statement is an example of my service to the\n\nrule of law and a partial expression of my view of the policy of stare decisis, which is that\n\npast precedent should generally be followed but that, in deciding whether wrongly\n\ndecided precedent should be overruled, each case should be looked at individually on its\n\nfacts and merits through the lens of judicial restraint, common sense, and fairness.3\n\n\n\n       3\n        I agree with the sentiment recently expressed by Chief Justice Roberts of the\nUnited States Supreme Court in his concurrence to the decision in Citizens United v\nFederal Election Commission, 558 US ___, ___; 130 S Ct 876, 920; 175 L Ed 2d 753,\n806 (2010), when he said that\n                                                                               (continued…)\n\n                                               3\n\f       Over the past decade, the principal tool used by this Court to decide when a\n\nprecedent should be overruled is the set of guidelines that was laid out in Robinson v\n\nDetroit, 462 Mich 439, 463; 613 NW2d 307 (2000), an opinion written by former Justice\n\nTAYLOR that Justices CORRIGAN, YOUNG, MARKMAN, and I signed, and that I have used\n\nnumerous times. In the instant case, my lead opinion specifically, and properly, applies\n\nthe Robinson guidelines. Thus, the dissent’s assertion that I have changed my view on\n\nstare decisis makes no logical sense.\n\n       Furthermore, I note that my position in Devillers is in no way inconsistent with my\n\nposition on stare decisis in this case, nor is it inconsistent with any position on stare\n\ndecisis that I have taken in other cases, such as Robinson.           Devillers involved the\n\n(…continued)\n     stare decisis is neither an “inexorable command,” Lawrence v. Texas, 539\n     U. S. 558, 577 [123 S Ct 2472; 156 L Ed 2d 508] (2003), nor “a mechanical\n     formula of adherence to the latest decision,” Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U.\n     S. 106, 119 [60 S Ct 444; 84 L Ed 604] (1940) . . . . If it were, segregation\n     would be legal, minimum wage laws would be unconstitutional, and the\n     Government could wiretap ordinary criminal suspects without first\n     obtaining warrants. See Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 [16 S Ct 1138;\n     41 L Ed 256] (1896), overruled by Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S.\n     483 [74 S Ct 686; 98 L Ed 873] (1954); Adkins v. Children’s Hospital of D.\n     C., 261 U. S. 525 [43 S. Ct. 394; 67 L Ed 785] (1923), overruled by West\n     Coast Hotel Co v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 [57 S.

S. 347 [88 S Ct\n     507; 19 L Ed 2d 576] (1967).\nChief Justice Roberts further called stare decisis a “principle of policy” and said that it “is\nnot an end in itself.” Id. at ___; 130 S Ct at 920; 175 L Ed 2d at 807. He explained that\n“[i]ts greatest purpose is to serve a constitutional ideal—the rule of law. It follows that in\nthe unusual circumstance when fidelity to any particular precedent does more to damage\nthis constitutional ideal than to advance it, we must be more willing to depart from that\nprecedent.” Id. at ___; 130 S Ct at 921; 175 L Ed 2d at 807.\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f“majority of four” overruling precedent involving contract interpretation from a case that\n\nwas nearly twenty (20) years old. In my Devillers dissent, I noted that I agreed with the\n\nmajority’s interpretation that the old precedent was incorrect, but given the passage of\n\ntime since that specific precedent was decided, the Court should not disturb that\n\nlongstanding precedent because the law had become so ingrained that to overrule it\n\nwould harm the reliance interests of parties in insurance cases. My position in Devillers\n\nwas entirely consistent with the reliance prong of the Robinson guidelines.4\n\n       My position in the instant case is also consistent with the reliance prong of the\n\nRobinson guidelines since Karaczewski, the case of which a portion is now being\n\noverruled, was only decided three (3) years ago. Furthermore, the portion that is being\n\noverruled is merely that decision’s retroactive effect—applying the new decision to\n\nparties’ past actions. My statement in Devillers is actually supportive of my position in\n\nthe instant case because in both instances my position has been to apply the longstanding\n\nlaw that parties had relied on when their cases arose.\n\n       The dissent cannot point to a statement where I professed some sort of position\n\nregarding stare decisis as an immutable doctrine, because I have not taken that position\n\nand therefore have made no such statements. For instance, I specifically chose not to\n\nsign Chief Justice KELLY’s lead opinion in Petersen v Magna Corp, 484 Mich 300, 316-\n\n320; 773 NW2d 564 (2009), because it proposed to create a standardized test for stare\n\n\n\n       4\n        For an explanation of the various prongs of the Robinson guidelines, see the lead\nopinion, ante at ___.\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\fdecisis. There is no need for this Court to adopt any standardized test regarding stare\n\ndecisis. In fact, it is an impossible task.\n\n       There are many factors to consider when deciding whether or not to overrule\n\nprecedent, and the importance of such factors often changes on a case-by-case basis. The\n\nRobinson guidelines are relevant in cases such as the instant case, in which reliance\n\ninterests are at risk. By no means do I consider the Robinson guidelines a “be-all, end-all\n\ntest” that constitutes precedent of this Court to be used whenever this Court considers\n\noverruling precedent. I view Robinson as merely providing guidelines to assist this Court\n\nin its legal analysis when pertinent.\n\n       In the end, the consideration of stare decisis and whether to overrule wrongly\n\ndecided precedent always includes service to the rule of law through an application and\n\nexercise of judicial restraint, common sense, and a sense of fairness—justice for all.\n\n\n                                                        Elizabeth A.

(dissenting).\n\n       I dissent from the decision by the majority of justices to “overrule the retroactive\n\neffect of Karaczewski.”1       Having failed to identify any flaw in the analysis of\n\nKaraczewski, overruling the application of the case is simply a means of substantively\n\noverruling Karaczewski without explicitly saying so. Karaczewski properly interpreted\n\nthe plain language of MCL 418.845, and it was appropriately applied to the case at bar by\n\nthe lower courts.     Because the majority justices essentially render Karaczewski an\n\nadvisory opinion, I dissent.\n\n       At the time of plaintiff’s injury, MCL 418.845 provided:\n\n              The bureau shall have jurisdiction over all controversies arising out\n       of injuries suffered outside this state where the injured employee is a\n       resident of this state at the time of injury and the contract of hire was made\n\n\n       1\n           Karaczewski v Farbman Stein & Co, 478 Mich 28; 732 NW2d 56 (2007).\n\f       in this state. Such employee or his dependents shall be entitled to the\n       compensation and other benefits provided by this act. [Emphasis added.]\n\nHere, there is no question that plaintiff was not a resident of this state when he was\n\ninjured. Therefore, pursuant to MCL 418.845 and Karaczewski, the magistrate correctly\n\nheld that the Workers’ Compensation Agency did not have jurisdiction.2 This Court\n\nexpressly stated in Karaczewski that its decision was to be applied to all pending cases.\n\nKaraczewski, 478 Mich at 44 n 15 (“[O]ur holding in this case shall apply to all claimants\n\nfor whom there has not been a final judgment awarding benefits as of the date of this\n\nopinion.”).   Because this was a pending case when Karaczewski was decided,\n\nKaraczewski is applicable.\n\n       As Karaczewski noted, since the very first workers’ compensation jurisdictional\n\nstatute was enacted in 1921, the law consistently provided the Michigan workers’\n\ncompensation system jurisdiction over out-of-state injuries when both (1) the injured\n\nemployee resided in this state at the time of injury and (2) the contract of hire was made\n\nin Michigan. However, in Boyd v W G Wade Shows, 443 Mich 515; 505 NW2d 544\n\n(1993), this Court declined to enforce the residency requirement because to do so would\n\n\n\n\n       2\n        It is irrelevant that defendant did not pursue this jurisdictional issue until after\nKaraczewski was decided. All courts “must upon challenge, or even sua sponte, confirm\nthat subject-matter jurisdiction exists . . . .” Reed v Yackell, 473 Mich 520, 540; 703\nNW2d 1 (2005) (opinion by TAYLOR, C.J.). Thus, subject matter jurisdiction may be\nchallenged at any time, even if raised for the first time on appeal. Lehman v Lehman, 312\nMich 102, 105-106; 19 NW2d 502 (1945); In re Cody's Estate, 293 Mich 697, 701; 292\nNW 535 (1940); In re Estate of Fraser, 288 Mich 392, 394; 285 NW 1 (1939).\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\fbe “undesirable” and “unduly restrictive”3 and because the requirement had been ignored\n\nby this Court since Roberts v I X L Glass Corp, 259 Mich 644; 244 NW 188 (1932).4\n\n       Karaczewski overruled Boyd on the basis of the rather unremarkable proposition\n\nthat the use of the conjunction “and” in MCL 418.845 was unambiguous and that the\n\nstatute must be applied as written. Nonetheless, in order to protect the reliance interests\n\nof injured plaintiffs who had already received an award of compensation benefits as part\n\nof a final judgment, Karaczewski’s holding was given limited retroactive effect, applying\n\nonly to claimants who had not received a final judgment awarding benefits as of the date\n\nof the opinion.5 While the Legislature subsequently amended the relevant statutory\n\nprovision to expand the agency’s jurisdiction over out-of-state injuries,6 the Legislature\n\n\n\n\n      3\n          Boyd, 443 Mich at 524.\n      4\n         However, as the dissenting justices in Boyd noted, the rationale of Roberts was\nbased on the elective nature of workers’ compensation in place at that time Roberts was\ndecided. The dissenters noted that the analytical underpinnings of Roberts were\neliminated when the Legislature made the workers’ compensation scheme compulsory in\n1943. Before Boyd, several Court of Appeals opinions had enforced the plain language\nof the statute on this basis. See Wolf v Ethyl Corp, 124 Mich App 368; 335 NW2d 42\n(1983); Bell v F J Boutell Driveaway Co, 141 Mich App 802; 369 NW2d 231 (1985);\nHall v Chrysler Corp, 172 Mich App 670; 432 NW2d 398 (1988).\n      5\n        Karaczewski, 478 Mich at 44 n 15. While I agree with the lead opinion’s\nstatement that this Court’s decisions are generally given full retroactive effect,\nKaraczewski was explicitly given limited retroactive effect.\n      6\n          2008 PA 499, effective January 13, 2009.\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\fchose not to give the amended statute retroactive application,7 thus leaving claimants\n\nsuch as plaintiff subject to the holding in Karaczewski.8\n\n       The justices in the majority are unable to identify any analytical defect in the\n\nsubstantive holding in Karaczewski; indeed, Justice WEAVER explicitly concurred in\n\nKaraczewski’s substantive analysis. Instead, they elect to overrule the limited retroactive\n\napplication of the opinion in favor of purely prospective application.9 However, as\n\nWayne Co v Hathcock explained, purely prospective opinions are effectively advisory\n\nopinions, and our constitutional authority to issue advisory opinions is limited to those\n\ncircumstances set forth in Const 1963, art 3, § 8, which are clearly not applicable in the\n\npresent case.10\n\n\n       7\n           See Brewer v A D Transp Express, Inc, 486 Mich 50; 782 NW2d 475 (2010).\n       8\n           The fact that the Legislature amended MCL 418.845 after this Court’s decision\nin Karaczewski without indicating that it intended the amended statute to be applied\nretroactively makes this case significantly distinguishable from Pohutski v City of Allen\nPark, 465 Mich 675; 641 NW2d 219 (2002), in which this Court did apply its holding\nprospectively only, because in Pohutski the Legislature amended the pertinent statute\nbefore this Court’s decision and, thus, had no reason to indicate that it intended the\namended statute to apply retroactively rather than this Court’s yet-to-be-decided decision\nin Pohutski. Even plaintiff’s counsel acknowledged as much at oral argument when he\nstated, “I think that is a factual difference between Pohutski and this case and\nconsequently you’d not be—certainly not required to follow or apply Pohutski to this\ncase . . . .”\n       9\n       Interestingly, Justice WEAVER would have preferred to deny the benefit of the\nKaraczewski ruling even to the parties appearing before the Court in Karaczewski.\nKaraczewski, 478 Mich at 45 (WEAVER, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n       10\n          Hathcock, 471 Mich 484 n 98 (“[T]here is a serious question as to whether it is\nconstitutionally legitimate for this Court to render purely prospective opinions, as such\nrulings are, in essence, advisory opinions. The only instance in which we are\nconstitutionally authorized to issue an advisory opinion is upon the request of either\n                                                                           (continued…)\n\n                                             4\n\f      The decision in this case is another instance in which the Court’s new\n\nphilosophical majority seems to retreat from its previously stated fidelity to stare\n\ndecisis.11 Since the shift in the Court’s philosophical majority in January 2009, the new\n\n\n\n\n(…continued)\nhouse of the Legislature or the Governor—and, then, only ‘on important questions of law\nupon solemn occasions as to the constitutionality of legislation after it has been enacted\ninto law but before its effective date.’”).\n      11\n          See, e.g., Pohutski v City of Allen Park, 465 Mich 675, 712; 641 NW2d 219\n(2002) (KELLY, J., dissenting) (“[I]f each successive Court, believing its reading is\ncorrect and past readings wrong, rejects precedent, then the law will fluctuate from year\nto year, rendering our jurisprudence dangerously unstable.”); People v Hawkins, 468\nMich 488, 517-518; 668 NW2d 602 (2003) (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting) (“‘We have\noverruled our precedents when the intervening development of the law has “removed or\nweakened the conceptual underpinnings from the prior decision, or where the later law\nhas rendered the decision irreconcilable with competing legal doctrines or policies.” . . .\nAbsent those changes or compelling evidence bearing on Congress’ original intent . . .\nour system demands that we adhere to our prior interpretations of statutes.’”), quoting\nNeal v United States, 516 US 284, 295; 116 S Ct 763; 133 L Ed 2d 709 (1996), quoting\nPatterson v McLean Credit Union, 491 US 164, 173; 109 S Ct 2363; 105 L Ed 2d 132\n(1989); Rowland v Washtenaw Co Rd Comm, 477 Mich 197, 278; 731 NW2d 41 (2007)\n(CAVANAGH, J., dissenting) (‘“Under the doctrine of stare decisis, principles of law\ndeliberately examined and decided by a court of competent jurisdiction become precedent\nwhich should not be lightly departed.’”), quoting People v Jamieson, 436 Mich 61, 79;\n461 NW2d 884 (1990); Brown v Manistee Co Rd Comm, 452 Mich 354, 365; 550 NW2d\n215 (1996) (“[A]bsent the rarest circumstances, we should remain faithful to established\nprecedent.”); Devillers v Auto Club Ins Ass’n, 473 Mich 562, 622; 702 NW2d 539 (2005)\n(WEAVER, J., dissenting) (“Correction for correction’s sake does not make sense.

FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       In 1998, plaintiff Andre Bezeau, a professional hockey player, signed a three-year\n\ncontract with the Detroit Vipers, a professional hockey team owned by defendant Palace\n\nSports & Entertainment, Inc. At the time, plaintiff was a resident of Michigan, and the\n\ncontract was signed in Michigan.\n\n       In June 2000, plaintiff fell from a 45-foot ladder while working at his father’s\n\nroofing company in New Brunswick, Canada. As a result of the fall, he injured his groin,\n\nlower back, and right thigh. Plaintiff stayed in New Brunswick to receive treatment for\n\nhis injuries, and he became a resident of New Brunswick.\n\n       In October 2000, the Detroit Vipers loaned plaintiff to the Providence Bruins, a\n\nprofessional hockey team located in Rhode Island. In the first game of the 2000-2001\n\nseason, which took place in Rhode Island, another player struck plaintiff, aggravating his\n\ninjury. Plaintiff left the game and has been unable to play hockey since the incident.\n\n       In June 2001, plaintiff applied for workers’ compensation benefits in Michigan.\n\nHe claimed that he had developed osteitis pubis as a result of playing professional\n\nhockey. A hearing was held before a magistrate in the Worker’s Compensation Board of\n\nMagistrates. The magistrate ruled in February 2003 that although plaintiff was disabled,\n\nthere was no persuasive evidence that the incident at the October 2000 hockey game in\n\nRhode Island caused plaintiff’s disabling injuries or aggravated any preexisting injuries.\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f       Plaintiff appealed the decision to the WCAC, which reversed the magistrate’s\n\nfindings.

Karaczewski, 478 Mich at 30, 39-41. The new interpretation\n\nof MCL 418.845 set forth in Karaczewski stated that for Michigan workers’\n\ncompensation laws to apply to a claim for benefits, the injured employee must have been\n\na resident of Michigan at the time of the injury and the contract for hire must have been\n\nmade in Michigan.1       Id. at 33, 44.   Under Boyd and Roberts, Michigan workers’\n\ncompensation laws applied to claims for benefits even if the injured employee was not a\n\nresident of Michigan as long as the contract for hire was made in Michigan.

ANALYSIS\n\n                        A. THE DECISION IN KARACZEWSKI\n\n      Karaczewski involved an employee whose contract for hire was made in\n\nMichigan, but who became a resident of another state after his employer transferred him.\n\nThe employee was injured on the job while in the other state. Karaczewski, 478 Mich at\n\n30. He filed a claim for workers’ compensation benefits in Michigan. Id. at 31.\n\n      The defendants in Karaczewski argued that under the plain language of the\n\nMichigan Worker’s Disability Compensation Act, the employee’s claim was not subject\n\nto the jurisdiction of the Michigan’s Workers’ Compensation Agency because the\n\nemployee was not a resident of Michigan at the time of the injury. Id. at 58. The WCAC\n\nand Court of Appeals agreed with the defendants that the plain language of the relevant\n\nstatute, MCL 418.845, would preclude the employee from bringing his claim in\n\nMichigan. Id. at 31-32. However, both the WCAC and the Court of Appeals noted that\n\n\n\n      2\n          Bezeau v Palace Sports & Entertainment, Inc, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">1001</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1001-1002\n(2009).\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\fthey were unable to rule in the defendants’ favor under the binding Michigan Supreme\n\nCourt precedents of Boyd and Roberts. Id. at 32.\n\n       In Boyd, this Court interpreted MCL 418.845 when faced with a similar situation\n\ninvolving an employee whose contract for hire was made in Michigan but who was\n\ninjured and died on the job while a resident of another state. Boyd, 443 Mich at 516. The\n\nCourt examined MCL 418.845 and Roberts, a case interpreting a predecessor of MCL\n\n418.845. Id. at 517-520. The Boyd Court held that, “pursuant to [MCL 418.845] and\n\nRoberts v IXL Glass Corp, supra, the Bureau of Workers’ Disability Compensation shall\n\nhave jurisdiction over extraterritorial injuries without regard to the employee's residence,\n\nprovided the contract of employment was entered into in this state with a resident\n\nemployer.” Id. at 526.\n\n       This Court granted leave in Karaczewski to determine whether overruling Boyd\n\nwould be justified.3 Analyzing the plain language of MCL 418.845, a majority of this\n\nCourt held that the statute “confers jurisdiction on the Bureau of Worker’s\n\nCompensation, now the Workers’ Compensation Agency, for out-of-state workplace\n\ninjuries only if (1) the employee is a resident of Michigan when the injury occurs and (2)\n\nthe contract of hire was made in Michigan.”         Karaczewski, 478 Mich at 30.        The\n\nKaraczewski Court’s interpretation of MCL 418.845 directly conflicted with this Court’s\n\ninterpretation of the same statute in Boyd, and thus this Court overruled Boyd. Id.

Karaczewski, Id. at 44 n 15.\n\n       In general, this Court’s decisions are given full retroactive effect. Pohutski v City\n\nof Allen Park, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"849007\"><a href=\"/opinion/849007/pohutski-v-city-of-allen-park/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">675</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 695; 641 NW2d 219 (2002).

Riley v Northland Geriatric Center (After Remand), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2048456\"><a href=\"/opinion/2048456/riley-v-nland-geriatric-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span>\n       <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 645-646; 433 NW2d 787 (1988) (GRIFFIN, J.). [Id.]\n\n       In determining whether Karaczewski was incorrectly given retroactive effect, we\n\nmust first answer the threshold question whether Karaczewski clearly established a new\n\nprinciple of law. The decision in Karaczewski to overrule Boyd established a new\n\ninterpretation of MCL 418.845 that broke from the longstanding interpretation of the\n\nstatute. Although the Court interpreted the statute consistently with its plain language,\n\nthe Court’s interpretation established a new rule of law because it affected how the statute\n\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\fwould be applied to parties in workers’ compensation cases in a way that was\n\ninconsistent with how the statute had been previously applied.4\n\n       Given that Karaczewski established a new rule of law, we now weigh the factors\n\nset forth in Pohutski to determine whether Karaczewski was correctly given retroactive\n\napplication. First, we determine the purpose to be served by the new rule. The majority\n\nin Karaczewski overruled Boyd because the Boyd interpretation of MCL 418.845 failed to\n\nrecognize that the statute’s text required that an injured employee must have been a\n\nresident of Michigan at the time of the injury and the contract for hire must have been\n\nmade in Michigan in order for the employee to be able to successfully file a workers’\n\ncompensation claim in Michigan. Thus, the purpose of the new rule was to interpret the\n\nlaw consistently with the Legislature’s apparent intent when drafting MCL 418.845.\n\n       The next two factors to consider in determining whether Karaczewski was\n\ncorrectly applied retroactively are reliance interests on the old rule of law under Boyd and\n\nthe effect of Karaczewski’s retroactivity on the administration of justice. The concurring\n\nand dissenting justices in Karaczewski noted that the decision to give Karaczewski\n\nretroactive effect would seriously undermine the reliance interests of parties regarding the\n\nBoyd/Roberts decisions. Justice KELLY stated in her dissent that “[t]here are significant\n\nreliance concerns implicated by the overturning of Roberts and Boyd. The underlying\n\nrationale of these cases has been in place for seven decades. Attorneys, employers,\n\n\n       4\n           Pohutski, 465 Mich at 696-697.\n\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\finsurance carriers, and various employees have relied on the holdings of Roberts and\n\nBoyd.” Karaczewski, 478 Mich at 62 (KELLY, J., dissenting).            Furthermore, Justice\n\nWEAVER noted in her opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part:\n\n               [T]here has been extensive reliance for 14 years on Boyd’s\n       interpretation of MCL 418.845. In addition to reliance by the courts,\n       insurance decisions have undoubtedly been predicated on this Court's\n       longstanding interpretation of MCL 418.845 under Boyd. Nonresident\n       injured employees, like plaintiff, who initially entered into contracts for\n       hire in Michigan, but later agreed to work outside Michigan, have relied on\n       the ability to obtain workers' compensation benefits based on their\n       employment relationship with Michigan employers.               Prospective\n       application acknowledges that reliance and assures the fair resolution of\n       those pending workers' compensation cases. [Id. at 46 (WEAVER, J.,\n       concurring in part and dissenting in part).]\n\n       In addition to Karaczewski’s failure to give due weight to that reliance on Boyd\n\nand Roberts, the dissenting justices noted that retroactivity would result in a disruption in\n\nthe administration of justice. Id. (WEAVER, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part);\n\nid. at 62 (KELLY, J., dissenting).      As the instant case shows, it appears that the\n\nKaraczewski decision has disrupted the administration of justice in cases that came under\n\nKaraczewski’s retroactive effect. Plaintiff first filed his claim in 2001, and the parties\n\nspent six years going through the appellate process to the Court of Appeals and back to\n\nthe board of magistrates without having any argument over jurisdictional questions\n\nregarding MCL 418.845. While the case was on remand at the board of magistrates in\n\n2007, Karaczewski was decided and defendant raised the jurisdictional issue for the first\n\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\ftime in the tribunal.5 Because a long-settled part of this well-traveled case suddenly\n\nbecame a new issue and the six years of work expended on this case became moot, we\n\nconclude that Karaczewski’s retroactive effect disrupted the administration of justice.\n\n       Because the Karaczewski decision on retroactivity did not give due weight to the\n\ninterests of employers and employees relying on the well-established law of Boyd and\n\nRoberts, and because it did not give due weight to its effect on the administration of\n\njustice, we conclude that the decision to give retroactivity to Karaczewski was\n\nerroneous.6\n\n                                   B. STARE DECISIS\n\n       Having established that retroactive effect was erroneous, we next decide whether\n\nthis Court should overrule the decision that gave retroactive effect to Karaczewski. This\n\nCourt generally adheres to the principle of stare decisis. Robinson v Detroit, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span>\n\n\n       <span class=\"page\">5</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n          Defendant did include a defense in its answer to plaintiff’s initial application for\nworkers’ compensation benefits, claiming that Michigan law did not cover the claim\nbecause the injury occurred in Rhode Island. However, defendant did not raise the issue\nat the hearing before the magistrate or at any appellate stage through the next six years\nuntil after Karaczewski was decided.\n       6\n          The purpose of the new rule from Karaczewski—interpreting the law\nconsistently with the Legislature’s apparent intent when drafting MCL 418.845—must\nalso be given weight. As can be seen from the concurrences of the justices signing this\nopinion, some of the justices in the majority agree with Justice YOUNG’s dissent that\nKaraczewski correctly interpreted the language of the statute, and some justices disagree\nwith Karaczewski’s interpretation of the statute. Nevertheless, we all conclude that the\neffect of retroactivity on the Pohutski factors of reliance and disruption of the\nadministration of justice outweigh the effects of retroactivity that in fact resulted from\nKaraczewski’s interpretation. In this instance, we find that the correct interpretation of a\nstatute is better given prospective application when retroactive application seriously\nundermines parties’ reliance on the rule of law and disrupts the administration of justice.\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\f439, 463; 613 NW2d 307 (2000). However, we should reexamine precedent when\n\nlegitimate questions have been raised about the correctness of a decision. Id. at 464.\n\nUpon such reexamination, our first step is to determine whether the precedent was\n\nwrongly decided. Id. Should we determine that precedent was wrongly decided, we also\n\n“examine the effects of overruling, including most importantly the effect on reliance\n\ninterests and whether overruling would work an undue hardship because of that reliance.”\n\nId. at 466. “As to the reliance interest, the Court must ask whether the previous decision\n\nhas become so embedded, so accepted, so fundamental, to everyone’s expectations that to\n\nchange it would produce not just readjustments, but practical real-world dislocations.”\n\nId.\n\n       As we have explained earlier, we conclude that giving retroactive effect to this\n\nCourt’s holding in Karaczewski was an erroneous decision. Having determined that the\n\nretroactivity holding was wrongly decided, we next turn to the reliance interests involved.\n\n       In this case, we are only reviewing the effect of retroactively applying\n\nKaraczewski’s interpretation of MCL 418.845. By its nature, the retroactivity applied\n\nonly to claims based on injuries that occurred before the date Karaczewski was decided.\n\nAt the time of the Karaczewski decision, the workers’ compensation system was\n\noperating under the prior precedent of Boyd and Roberts regarding jurisdictional\n\nquestions under MCL 418.845.        At the time of the Karaczewski decision, the only\n\nreliance on law regarding MCL 418.845 by parties was a reliance on the Boyd and\n\nRoberts precedents. There could not have been reliance on the law of the Karaczewski\n\ndecision for claims based on injuries that occurred before Karaczewski because\n\n\n                                            11\n\fKaraczewski was decided after the bases for those claims had arisen. Thus, we find no\n\nreliance interests regarding the retroactive effect of Karaczewski on claims in which the\n\ninjuries had occurred on or before the date Karaczewski was decided.\n\n      Our next step in examining whether the retroactive effect of Karaczewski should\n\nbe overruled is to determine whether overruling that effect will result in any undue\n\nhardships for parties involved in cases affected by our decision. As we have noted, the\n\nparties involved in cases affected by this decision had no reliance interests involving\n\nKaraczewski. By overruling the retroactivity of Karaczewski, the only effect on those\n\nparties is that their cases will be governed by the precedents that governed their claims\n\nwhen the bases for those claims first arose. We believe that such an effect is not an\n\nundue hardship on the parties because they are simply returning to the status quo for their\n\nclaims.\n\n      Further justification for overruling the retroactivity of Karaczewski can be found\n\nin the inequity in the instant case, which arose as a result of the retroactivity holding.\n\nWhen the instant case was filed, the Boyd and Roberts interpretations of MCL 418.845\n\nclearly governed the case, and plaintiff met the requirements of those interpretations.\n\nThe Boyd and Roberts interpretations remained the governing interpretations of MCL\n\n418.845 for more than six years while the case made its way from the board of\n\nmagistrates to the WCAC, then to the Court of Appeals, then back to the WCAC on\n\nremand and, finally, back to the board of magistrates.       During the entire appellate\n\nprocess, the interpretation of MCL 418.845 was not an issue in this case. But when the\n\ncase was before the board of magistrates on remand to determine an entirely unrelated\n\n\n                                            12\n\ffactual matter, this Court handed down the Karaczewski decision, overruling the Boyd\n\nand Roberts interpretations for all cases in which there had not been a final judgment.\n\nThe Karaczewski decision therefore changed the law of this case in the middle of the\n\nappellate process without the parties having raised any issue regarding that specific point\n\nof law. We find that outcome to be inequitable, and thus we feel that it should be\n\nreversed.\n\n       We have concluded that the factors for overruling precedent laid out in Robinson\n\nweigh in favor of overruling the retroactivity holding of Karaczewski. Moreover, we\n\nhave found further justification for overruling the retroactivity holding as a result of the\n\ninequity that has arisen in this case.        Accordingly, we overrule the holding of\n\nKaraczewski that gave retroactive effect to its decision.\n\n       It should be particularly noted that our holding today affects only claims based on\n\ninjuries that occurred on or before the date this Court decided Karaczewski, as long as the\n\nclaim has not already reached final resolution in the court system. We do not overrule\n\nany aspect of the Karaczewski opinion other than its retroactive effect. Contrary to the\n\nassertions in Justice YOUNG’s dissent, which Justices CORRIGAN and MARKMAN also\n\njoin, there is no majority to overrule Karaczewski in its entirety. We note that Chief\n\nJustice KELLY concurs with this opinion in part and dissents in part because she would in\n\nfact completely overrule Karaczewski. Six justices have chosen not to agree with Chief\n\nJustice KELLY’s position to completely overrule Karaczewski, and as a result, the\n\nportrayal of the lead opinion contained in Justice YOUNG’s dissent is inaccurate.\n\nKaraczewski’s interpretation of MCL 418.845 remains the law of this state for claims\n\n\n                                             13\n\fbased on injuries that occurred after the date that Karaczewski was decided but before the\n\neffective date of the amendment of MCL 418.845 by enacting </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">PA</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n                                   IV. CONCLUSION\n\n      We reverse the decision of the WCAC. We overrule this Court’s decision to give\n\nretroactive effect to Karaczewski because the decision was erroneous, overruling it will\n\nnot affect any reliance interests of the parties affected by our decision, and no undue\n\nhardship will occur as a result of our decision. Our holding affects claims based on\n\ninjuries that occurred on or before the date this Court decided Karaczewski, as long as the\n\nclaim has not already reached final resolution in the court system. Accordingly, we\n\nremand this case to the WCAC to continue proceedings consistent with its actions before\n\nthe Karaczewski decision.\n\n      Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n      HATHAWAY, J., concurred with WEAVER, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                            14\n\f                            STATE OF MICHIGAN\n\n                                    SUPREME COURT\n\n\nANDRE BEZEAU,\n\n             Plaintiff-Appellant,\n\nv                                                           No. 137500\n\nPALACE SPORTS & ENTERTAINMENT,\nINC.,\n\n             Defendant-Appellee.\n\n\nCAVANAGH, J.

I\n\nagree that the interpretation of MCL 418.845 adopted in Karaczewski v Farbman Stein &\n\nCo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"842966\"><a href=\"/opinion/842966/karaczewski-v-farbman-stein-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 732 NW2d 56 (2007), should only have been applied prospectively and\n\nthat Karaczewski should be overruled to the extent that it held otherwise.         I write\n\nseparately because whereas the lead opinion applies the stare decisis approach from\n\nRobinson v Detroit, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 463-468; 613 NW2d 307 (2000), I continue to prefer\n\nthe modified version of this approach articulated by Chief Justice KELLY in Petersen v\n\nMagna Corp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"836195\"><a href=\"/opinion/836195/petersen-v-magna-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 316-320; 773 NW2d 564 (2009) (opinion by KELLY, C.J.).\n\nThe result, however, is the same.\n\n      Under my preferred approach to stare decisis, there is a presumption in favor of\n\nupholding precedent that may be rebutted only if there is a compelling justification to\n\noverturn precedent. Id. at 317. In determining whether a compelling justification exists,\n\fcourts may use a number of evaluative criteria if relevant but, importantly, a compelling\n\njustification requires more than a mere belief that a case was wrongly decided.1 Id. at\n\n319-320. In this case, the narrow question presented is whether there is a compelling\n\njustification to overrule the Karaczewski majority’s decision to apply its interpretation of\n\nMCL 418.845 retroactively.\n\n       One criterion is particularly relevant to this question: the extent of reliance on the\n\nprior interpretation of MCL 418.845 and the extent to which overruling it might cause\n\nspecial hardship and inequity. See id. at 320. Although the reliance interests usually\n\nweigh against overruling a decision or, at best, are neutral, this case presents the unusual\n\nsituation in which the reliance interests weigh in favor of overruling a decision.2 As\n\nnoted in the lead opinion, the cases that will be affected by prospective application of\n\nKaraczewski are only those involving injuries that occurred before Karaczewski was\n\ndecided. In those cases, overruling Karaczewski’s retroactive application and restoring\n\nthe pre-Karaczewski status quo is in accordance with the reliance interests.3 In fact,\n\n\n       1\n        In Petersen, Chief Justice KELLY provided a list of criteria that courts may use to\nconsider whether there is a compelling justification, but the list is nonexhaustive and\nnone of the criteria are determinative. They only need to be evaluated if relevant. See\nPetersen, 484 Mich at 320 (opinion by KELLY, C.J.).\n       2\n          Indeed, the usual tensions present in a stare decisis analysis are absent in this\ncase. Generally, stare decisis balances two concerns: “the need of the community for\nstability in legal rules and decisions and the need of courts to correct past errors.” Id. at\n314. In this case, however, both concerns are advanced by overruling the retroactive\napplication of Karaczewski.\n       3\n        As stated by then Justice KELLY in Karaczewski, the essential rationale of the\npre-Karaczewski interpretation of MCL 418.845 had been in place for seven decades and\nwas an essential part of the workers’ compensation regime in Michigan, such that\n                                                                        (continued…)\n\n                                             2\n\finequity and hardship could result if the retroactivity of Karaczewski is not overturned.\n\nThis is demonstrated by this case, in which the parties, relying on the pre-Karaczewski\n\nstatus of the law, had been litigating the merits of the case for six years when\n\nKaraczewski was decided. Thus, because I think that the reliance interests formed in this\n\nand other similar cases constitute a compelling justification to overrule precedent, I\n\nconcur in the majority’s decision to overrule the retroactive application of Karaczewski’s\n\ninterpretation of the statute.\n\n\n                                                       Michael F.

(concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n\n      I concur with the majority opinion that Karaczewski v Farbman Stein & Co1\n\nshould never have been applied retroactively.      I would overrule Karaczewski in its\n\nentirety because I continue to believe that it should not have overruled Boyd v W G Wade\n\nShows2 and Roberts v I X L Glass Corp.3 As I stated in my dissent in Karaczewski,\n\nduring the 74 years that Roberts was controlling law, the Legislature took no steps to\n\nchange or amend MCL 418.845.4 Again, when this Court affirmed that interpretation of\n\nMCL 418.845 in Boyd, the Legislature did nothing.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          Karaczewski v Farbman Stein & Co, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"842966\"><a href=\"/opinion/842966/karaczewski-v-farbman-stein-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 732 NW2d 56 (2007).\n      2\n          Boyd v W G Wade Shows, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2123843\"><a href=\"/opinion/2123843/boyd-v-wg-wade-shows/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">515</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 505 NW2d 544 (1993).\n      3\n          Roberts v I X L Glass Corp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3491319\"><a href=\"/opinion/3522158/roberts-v-i-x-l-glass-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">259</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">644</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3491319\"><a href=\"/opinion/3522158/roberts-v-i-x-l-glass-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1932).\n      4\n          Karaczewski, 478 Mich at 46-47 (KELLY, J., dissenting).\n\f       Only after this Court upset 74 years of law in Karaczewski did the Legislature\n\nspeak by enacting </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">PA</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. It abrogated Karaczewski scarcely more than two years\n\nafter it was decided.5 Although some discard any use of legislative acquiescence as a tool\n\nfor interpreting legislative intent, it is difficult to take issue with the fact that the\n\nLegislature took explicit action here.\n\n       Furthermore, I believe that the Robinson factors clearly call for overruling\n\nKaraczewski.6 First, as discussed previously, the enactment of </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">PA</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> was a\n\nchange in the law that undercut and undermined the original basis for the decision.\n\nAllowing the central holding of Karaczewski to remain intact has a disturbing effect. It\n\ndisenfranchises the unfortunate group of out-of-state workers with contracts for hire\n\nmade in Michigan who were injured on the job after Karaczewski was decided but before\n\n\n\n\n       5\n         See House Legislative Analysis, SB 1596, December 11, 2008 (stating that “the\nMichigan Supreme Court reversed longstanding case law” in Karaczewski and\n“eliminated coverage for injuries that had previously been covered under the act,\nreducing compensation for injured workers, and causing potential problems for\nemployers”); Senate Legislative Analysis, SB 1596, November 12, 2008 (explaining that\nthe purpose of </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">PA</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> is to restore the Workers’ Compensation Agency’s\njurisdiction in response to Karaczewski).\n      I recognize that </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">PA</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> ultimately expanded jurisdiction in workers’\ncompensation cases beyond where it had been before Karaczewski. But the legislative\nanalyses make clear that the amendment was in direct response to Karaczewski and\nsought to restore jurisdiction to the Workers’ Compensation Agency.\n       6\n           Robinson v Detroit, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 613 NW2d 307 (2000).\n      I remain committed to the stare decisis factors I proposed in Petersen v Magna\nCorp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"836195\"><a href=\"/opinion/836195/petersen-v-magna-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 317-320; 773 NW2d 564 (2009), and I believe that this Court\nshould adopt those factors.\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">PA</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> went into effect.

Reliance on\n\nit has been minimal, given that it was decided recently. Because it displaced 74 years of\n\nprecedent in Michigan, it is not “so embedded, so accepted, so fundamental, to\n\neveryone’s expectations” that overruling it would result in “significant dislocations.”7\n\nKaraczewski itself displaced reliance interests by overturning a fundamental part of the\n\nworkers’ compensation regime, even if only for a brief period, thanks to the Legislature’s\n\nquick enactment of </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">PA</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.8\n\n       I believe these compelling justifications necessitate that this Court overrule\n\nKaraczewski.

This\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          Justices CORRIGAN, YOUNG, and MARKMAN comprise “the remaining three”\njustices of the former “majority of four,” which included former Chief Justice TAYLOR.\n\fcharacterization is not only incorrect and inaccurate, it is misleading and intellectually\n\ndeceptive.\n\n       Further, the dissent’s attempt to characterize the lead opinion as being\n\nrepresentative of a so-called new philosophical majority is also false.         There is no\n\nphilosophical majority in this case. While the justices forming the majority each agreed\n\nwith the result in this case, each justice reached his or her conclusion based on different\n\nreasons.2\n\n       It appears that the dissent is attempting to lump together the four justices who\n\nagree with parts of the lead opinion into having had some sort of previously stated\n\nfidelity to stare decisis that those justices have abandoned since former Chief Justice\n\nTAYLOR’s overwhelming defeat in the 2008 election.\n\n       The dissent quotes various past statements, made by those justices signing portions\n\nof the lead opinion, regarding stare decisis and criticizing the former “majority of four”\n\n(former Chief Justice TAYLOR, and Justices CORRIGAN, YOUNG, and MARKMAN). With\n\n       2\n         The dissent attempts to make an argument that there is some sort of philosophical\nmajority that wants to overrule Karaczewski in its entirety. However, one need look no\nfurther than the various opinions written in this case to see that there is no such majority\nfor that proposition. When Karaczewski was decided in 2007, I concurred in the\nsubstance of the opinion, and I continue to see nothing wrong with its statutory analysis.\nOn the other hand, Chief Justice KELLY is dissenting in part from the lead opinion in this\ncase for the very reason that she thinks Karaczewski needs to be completely overruled.\nHer position is understandable, given that she dissented from the entire decision in 2007\nwhen Karaczewski was decided. But there are currently not four votes for her position,\nso her position is not the majority’s position. Rather, there are in essence six justices who\nhave for whatever reason decided not to join with the Chief Justice’s position to overrule\nall of Karaczewski in this case. The dissent simply ignores that fact for the convenience\nof making the mistaken conclusions in the dissenting opinion seem more palatable.\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\frespect to myself, the dissent quotes a statement I made in response to the improper and\n\nunfair dismantling of decades of longstanding insurance contract law by the former\n\n“majority of four” in Devillers v Auto Club Ins Ass’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"848613\"><a href=\"/opinion/848613/devillers-v-auto-club-ins-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">562</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 702 NW2d 539\n\n(2005). In Devillers, I stated, “Correction for correction’s sake does not make sense.\n\nThe case has not been made why the Court should not adhere to the doctrine of stare\n\ndecisis in this case.” Id. at 622 (WEAVER, J., dissenting) (emphasis added).\n\n       The dissent’s use of my Devillers statement appears to be a weak attempt to\n\nmanufacture some sort of story to try to get people to believe that a philosophical\n\nmajority of justices exists and is out to overrule precedent created by the “majority of\n\nfour.” The dissent’s mistaken assertions that I have somehow changed my view of stare\n\ndecisis since former Chief Justice TAYLOR was defeated and that I am part of a\n\nphilosophical majority are simply incorrect.\n\n       My Devillers statement itself shows that I was criticizing the disregard for stare\n\ndecisis in that specific case. My Devillers statement is an example of my service to the\n\nrule of law and a partial expression of my view of the policy of stare decisis, which is that\n\npast precedent should generally be followed but that, in deciding whether wrongly\n\ndecided precedent should be overruled, each case should be looked at individually on its\n\nfacts and merits through the lens of judicial restraint, common sense, and fairness.3\n\n\n\n       3\n        I agree with the sentiment recently expressed by Chief Justice Roberts of the\nUnited States Supreme Court in his concurrence to the decision in Citizens United v\nFederal Election Commission, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">___, ___; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1741\"><a href=\"/opinion/1741/citizens-united-v-federal-election-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

He explained that\n“[i]ts greatest purpose is to serve a constitutional ideal—the rule of law. It follows that in\nthe unusual circumstance when fidelity to any particular precedent does more to damage\nthis constitutional ideal than to advance it, we must be more willing to depart from that\nprecedent.” Id. at ___; 130 S Ct at 921; 175 L Ed 2d at 807.\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f“majority of four” overruling precedent involving contract interpretation from a case that\n\nwas nearly twenty (20) years old. In my Devillers dissent, I noted that I agreed with the\n\nmajority’s interpretation that the old precedent was incorrect, but given the passage of\n\ntime since that specific precedent was decided, the Court should not disturb that\n\nlongstanding precedent because the law had become so ingrained that to overrule it\n\nwould harm the reliance interests of parties in insurance cases. My position in Devillers\n\nwas entirely consistent with the reliance prong of the Robinson guidelines.4\n\n       My position in the instant case is also consistent with the reliance prong of the\n\nRobinson guidelines since Karaczewski, the case of which a portion is now being\n\noverruled, was only decided three (3) years ago. Furthermore, the portion that is being\n\noverruled is merely that decision’s retroactive effect—applying the new decision to\n\nparties’ past actions. My statement in Devillers is actually supportive of my position in\n\nthe instant case because in both instances my position has been to apply the longstanding\n\nlaw that parties had relied on when their cases arose.\n\n       The dissent cannot point to a statement where I professed some sort of position\n\nregarding stare decisis as an immutable doctrine, because I have not taken that position\n\nand therefore have made no such statements. For instance, I specifically chose not to\n\nsign Chief Justice KELLY’s lead opinion in Petersen v Magna Corp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"836195\"><a href=\"/opinion/836195/petersen-v-magna-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 316-\n\n320; 773 NW2d 564 (2009), because it proposed to create a standardized test for stare\n\n\n\n       4\n        For an explanation of the various prongs of the Robinson guidelines, see the lead\nopinion, ante at ___.\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\fdecisis. There is no need for this Court to adopt any standardized test regarding stare\n\ndecisis. In fact, it is an impossible task.\n\n       There are many factors to consider when deciding whether or not to overrule\n\nprecedent, and the importance of such factors often changes on a case-by-case basis. The\n\nRobinson guidelines are relevant in cases such as the instant case, in which reliance\n\ninterests are at risk. By no means do I consider the Robinson guidelines a “be-all, end-all\n\ntest” that constitutes precedent of this Court to be used whenever this Court considers\n\noverruling precedent. I view Robinson as merely providing guidelines to assist this Court\n\nin its legal analysis when pertinent.\n\n       In the end, the consideration of stare decisis and whether to overrule wrongly\n\ndecided precedent always includes service to the rule of law through an application and\n\nexercise of judicial restraint, common sense, and a sense of fairness—justice for all.\n\n\n                                                        Elizabeth A.

(dissenting).\n\n       I dissent from the decision by the majority of justices to “overrule the retroactive\n\neffect of Karaczewski.”1       Having failed to identify any flaw in the analysis of\n\nKaraczewski, overruling the application of the case is simply a means of substantively\n\noverruling Karaczewski without explicitly saying so. Karaczewski properly interpreted\n\nthe plain language of MCL 418.845, and it was appropriately applied to the case at bar by\n\nthe lower courts.     Because the majority justices essentially render Karaczewski an\n\nadvisory opinion, I dissent.\n\n       At the time of plaintiff’s injury, MCL 418.845 provided:\n\n              The bureau shall have jurisdiction over all controversies arising out\n       of injuries suffered outside this state where the injured employee is a\n       resident of this state at the time of injury and the contract of hire was made\n\n\n       1\n           Karaczewski v Farbman Stein & Co, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"842966\"><a href=\"/opinion/842966/karaczewski-v-farbman-stein-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 732 NW2d 56 (2007).\n\f       in this state. Such employee or his dependents shall be entitled to the\n       compensation and other benefits provided by this act. [Emphasis added.]\n\nHere, there is no question that plaintiff was not a resident of this state when he was\n\ninjured. Therefore, pursuant to MCL 418.845 and Karaczewski, the magistrate correctly\n\nheld that the Workers’ Compensation Agency did not have jurisdiction.2 This Court\n\nexpressly stated in Karaczewski that its decision was to be applied to all pending cases.\n\nKaraczewski, 478 Mich at 44 n 15 (“[O]ur holding in this case shall apply to all claimants\n\nfor whom there has not been a final judgment awarding benefits as of the date of this\n\nopinion.”).   Because this was a pending case when Karaczewski was decided,\n\nKaraczewski is applicable.\n\n       As Karaczewski noted, since the very first workers’ compensation jurisdictional\n\nstatute was enacted in 1921, the law consistently provided the Michigan workers’\n\ncompensation system jurisdiction over out-of-state injuries when both (1) the injured\n\nemployee resided in this state at the time of injury and (2) the contract of hire was made\n\nin Michigan. However, in Boyd v W G Wade Shows, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2123843\"><a href=\"/opinion/2123843/boyd-v-wg-wade-shows/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">515</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 505 NW2d 544\n\n(1993), this Court declined to enforce the residency requirement because to do so would\n\n\n\n\n       2\n        It is irrelevant that defendant did not pursue this jurisdictional issue until after\nKaraczewski was decided.

Nonetheless, in order to protect the reliance interests\n\nof injured plaintiffs who had already received an award of compensation benefits as part\n\nof a final judgment, Karaczewski’s holding was given limited retroactive effect, applying\n\nonly to claimants who had not received a final judgment awarding benefits as of the date\n\nof the opinion.5 While the Legislature subsequently amended the relevant statutory\n\nprovision to expand the agency’s jurisdiction over out-of-state injuries,6 the Legislature\n\n\n\n\n      3\n          Boyd, 443 Mich at 524.\n      4\n         However, as the dissenting justices in Boyd noted, the rationale of Roberts was\nbased on the elective nature of workers’ compensation in place at that time Roberts was\ndecided. The dissenters noted that the analytical underpinnings of Roberts were\neliminated when the Legislature made the workers’ compensation scheme compulsory in\n1943.
