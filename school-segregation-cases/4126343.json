The district court1 denied their Rule 60(b)(5)\nmotion. The school districts appeal, alleging the district court applied the wrong legal\nstandard in analyzing their motion, and arguing that it is no longer just or equitable\nto give the 1992 order or the Agreement prospective application in light of the repeal\nof the Arkansas School Choice Act of 1989 (School Choice Act). See Ark. Code Ann.\n§ 6-18-206 (repealed 2013). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n\n\n      1\n        The Honorable Robert T. Dawson, United States District Judge for the Western\nDistrict of Arkansas.\n\n                                           -2-\n\fBecause the repeal of the School Choice Act does not warrant termination of the\nAgreement, we affirm.\n\n                                   I. Background\n\n       On August 18, 1989, W.T. Davis filed, individually and on behalf of a class of\ntaxpayers of Garland County, Arkansas, a class action lawsuit against Garland County\nalleging that it maintained a racially-segregated public school system in violation of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The parties agreed to settle the\ncase and entered into the Agreement on November 25, 1991. One provision of the\noverall Agreement adopted the School Choice Act, which allowed students to apply\nto attend a school outside of their resident school district, but included a race-based\nlimitation on such transfers. After a fairness hearing, the court entered an order on\nApril 28, 1992, approving the Agreement and dismissing the case with prejudice on\nthe merits.\n\n       In 2012, the district court, as a result of independent litigation, held the\nprovision of the School Choice Act limiting transfers on the basis of race violated the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Teague ex rel. T.T. v. Ark.\nBd. of Educ., 873 F. Supp. 2d 1055, 1065–68 (W.D. Ark. 2012), vacated as moot sub\nnom. Teague v. Cooper, 720 F.3d 973 (8th Cir. 2013).\n\n       The court’s decision was appealed but eventually rendered moot because, in\n2013, the Arkansas legislature repealed the 1989 Act and replaced it with the\nArkansas Public School Choice Act of 2013 (2013 School Choice Act). See Ark.\nCode Ann. § 6-18-1901 et seq. The 2013 School Choice Act removed the race-based\nlimitation on public school transfers and included a provision preventing the receiving\nschool district from discriminating on the basis of race. The Act included, however,\na carve-out restriction: Under the 2013 School Choice Act, nonresident transfers were\nonly permitted “provided that the transfer by the student does not conflict with an\n\n                                         -3-\n\fenforceable judicial decree or court order remedying the effects of past racial\nsegregation in the school district.” Ark. Code Ann. § 6-18-1901(b)(3).\n\n        The school districts wanted to know whether the changes to the state law had\nany effect on their continuing obligations under the Agreement, and on May 22, 2013,\nfiled a petition for declaratory relief seeking continued enforcement of the Agreement.\n The school districts affirmatively argued that the Teague ruling, as well as the 2013\nSchool Choice Act, did not have any impact on the efficacy of the court’s 1992 order\napproving the Agreement and its inclusion of the race-based transfer limitation. The\nschool districts explained that:\n\n      The import [of entering the settlement agreement and obtaining Court\n      approval thereof] was to incorporate by reference the language, terms\n      and provisions of the 1989 Act as a consent desegregation plan of the\n      Court applicable to all public school districts within Garland County,\n      Arkansas, for the purpose of remedy[ing] the vestiges of prior de jure\n      racial segregation within the public education system of Garland County,\n      Arkansas.\n\nThe school districts expressed the view that because the Agreement constituted a court\norder remedying the effects of past discrimination (in other words, a consent decree),\nit fell within the 2013 School Choice Act’s carve-out restriction. The district court\nagreed with the school districts’ assessment that none of the changes in the law had\nimpacted the Settlement, and granted their requested declaratory relief. The district\ncourt stated that “the Settlement Agreement constitutes a court-approved\ndesegregation plan that should remain in effect despite recent changes to the law on\nwhich the Settlement Agreement was partly based.” Davis v. Hot Springs Sch. Dist.,\net. al., No. 6:89-CV-06088, slip op. at 4 (W.D. Ark. June 10, 2013).\n\n      Now, however, the same school districts have taken a different position,\nexplaining that they requested declaratory relief in order to clarify the law during an\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\femergency, but they had “no time” to seek termination of the Agreement in court.\nWhile the type of relief requested may have been affected by timing, the districts state\nthat their position on the issue changed because of subsequent events. According to\nthe districts, “[t]he episode that awoke the Districts to the inequity of the Settlement\nAgreement was the injustice that befell the Walker children, who were denied transfer\nsolely because they are black.” Therefore, on August 25, 2014, the districts filed the\npresent motion for relief from judgment under Rule 60(b)(5), seeking termination of\nthe Agreement and relief from the court’s 1992 order in its entirety, on the grounds\nthat it is no longer just or equitable to give the 1992 order or the Agreement\nprospective application in light of the repeal of the 1989 Act. The district court\nconcluded that the school districts had failed to meet the standard for termination\nunder Rule 60(b)(5) and denied their motion. The school districts timely appeal.\n\n                                    II. Discussion\n\n       Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5) allows the court, “[o]n motion and just\nterms,” to “relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment, order, or\nproceeding” because “the judgment has been satisfied, released or discharged; it is\nbased on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated; or applying it\nprospectively is no longer equitable.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5). The parties dispute\nthe correct standard to apply to the Rule 60(b)(5) motion at issue. The district court\nheld, and the appellees maintain, that in order to terminate the Agreement, the moving\nparty must demonstrate “full compliance,” because the “‘core of the termination\nstandard’ is whether ‘the vestiges of past discrimination ha[ve] been eliminated to the\nextent practicable.’” Davis v. Hot Springs Sch. Dist., et al., No. 6:89-CV-06088, slip\nop. at 5 (W.D. Ark. March 31, 2015) (quoting Smith v. Bd. of Educ. of Palestine-\nWheatley Sch. Dist., 769 F.3d 566, 572 (8th Cir. 2014) (alteration in original)\n(explaining the test for termination of a desegregation decree set forth in Freeman v.\nPitts, 503 U.S. 467, 490–91 (1992))). The district court distinguished between\n\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fattempts to modify a settlement agreement and attempts at total termination, regardless\nof the basis for the motion.\n\n       By contrast, the school districts argue that their Rule 60(b)(5) motion should\nbe governed by the standard set forth in Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, which\nrequires a party seeking modification of a consent decree to establish “that a\nsignificant change in circumstances warrants revision.” 502 U.S. 367, 383 (1992).\nThe school districts allege that the relevant distinction is not one between modification\nand termination, but rather whether the basis for the request is changed circumstances\nor evidence of full compliance. If the modification or termination is based on a\nchange of circumstances, they argue, the Rufo standard should apply. “If the moving\nparty meets this standard, the court should consider whether the proposed\nmodification is suitably tailored to the changed circumstance.” Id.\n\n        We review the appropriate legal standard de novo and the district court’s Rule\n60(b)(5) ruling for abuse of discretion. Smith, 769 F.3d at 568. We agree with the\ndistrict court that the school districts have not shown evidence of full compliance.2\nStill, assuming without deciding that Rufo is the correct standard to apply in this\nsituation, we conclude that the change in the law presented by the school districts,\nstanding alone, is not enough to require termination of the Agreement in this case.\n\n     The school districts argue that even if they have not demonstrated full\ncompliance with the Agreement, their termination motion should be granted based on\n\n\n      2\n       The school districts concede that they are not arguing “the judgment in this\ncase has been satisfied, released, or discharged.” The district court provided the\nschool districts with the opportunity to present any evidence they deemed appropriate,\nbut they did not submit “any evidence to demonstrate full compliance with the\nAgreement” or offer “any proof that the vestiges of past discrimination have been\neliminated,” and the Hot Springs School District (defendant-appellee here) provided\nevidence that the Garland County school districts remain racially identifiable.\n\n                                          -6-\n\fa change in circumstances, namely, a change in the law. While a change in the law\nmay lead to a successful Rule 60(b)(5) motion, see, e.g., Protectoseal Co. v. Barancik,\n23 F.3d 1184, 1187 (7th Cir. 1994), and Rufo may apply in certain instances to school\ndesegregation decrees, see Smith, 769 F.3d at 571–72, the movants still retain the\nburden to show that the change in the law has an actual effect on the section of the\nconsent decree targeted, making future application inequitable, and that any such\neffect warrants termination of the entire Agreement. The school districts have done\nneither.\n\n       First, the school districts have failed to show that any change in the law affects\ntheir consent decree. The 2013 School Choice Act has a clear carve-out for school\ndistricts subject to an “enforceable judicial decree or court order remedying the effects\nof past racial segregation in the school district.” Ark. Code Ann. § 6-18-1901(b)(3).\nThe school districts present only a 2012 federal district court decision, subsequently\nrendered moot by a change in the law, to show that application of the old School\nChoice Act is prospectively inequitable. See Teague, 873 F. Supp. 2d at 1065–66.\nEven if the case had not been rendered moot, however, they have failed to show why\nit would matter. While “[a] consent decree must of course be modified if, as it later\nturns out, one or more of the obligations placed upon the parties has become\nimpermissible under federal law,” there has been no ruling that the 1989 Act is\nunconstitutional as incorporated into a judicial decree remedying the effects of past\ndiscrimination, and the school districts have not demonstrated why the reasoning that\ndrove the district court’s decision in Teague would render it impermissible for\nindividual school districts to implement in the context of a consent decree the\npractices outlined by the 1989 Act. Rufo, 502 U.S. at 388. To the contrary, Teague’s\nfinding that the 1989 Act was unconstitutional rested on the fact that “[t]he limitation\nexpressed in Ark. Code Ann. § 6-18-206(f) [the race-based transfer limitation]\napplie[d] state-wide without regard to whether a resident or non-resident school\ndistrict ha[d] a history of de jure or de facto segregation.” Teague, 873 F. Supp. 2d\nat 1066.\n\n                                          -7-\n\f       Second, even assuming a relevant change in the law, the school districts—who\nasked for full termination of the Agreement—must show that the purported change\naffects the entire Agreement. In Smith, on which the school districts primarily rely,\n“the [district] court’s finding ‘that the defendants [had] complied in good faith with\nthe remainder of the requirements set forth in the consent decree’” was relevant both\nto whether there was a “sufficient basis for the court to conclude that the District had\ndemonstrated the requisite ‘significant change of circumstances,’” and to whether the\nmodification effectively terminated the entire decree. 769 F.3d at 573–74. Some\nprovisions of the decree were effectively terminated by the court’s order granting the\nschool district’s Rule 60(b)(5) motion, yet other provisions remained unaffected.\nSince extending the school district’s motion to terminate those other provisions would\nbe “supported by nothing more than the notion they are ‘no longer convenient to live\nwith,’” we were confident that “the district court did not intend that its order terminate\nthe entire consent decree.” Id. at 574 (quoting Rufo, 502 U.S. at 383).\n\n      Here, the school districts’ motion to terminate the entire Agreement is similarly\noverbroad, and a change of law that may or may not apply to one section of that\nAgreement is not sufficient to carry their burden. The district court noted in its 2013\norder granting declaratory relief that the Agreement consists of much more\n\n      than the mere implementation of the 1989 Act. It is a contract that also\n      addresses the districts’ staff development, curricula, testing and\n      assessments, special education and gifted-and-talented programs,\n      student-teacher interactions, and other services designed to enhance and\n      improve public education in Garland County.\n\nDavis, No. 6:89-CV-06088, slip op. at 4. The school districts have presented no\nevidence that they have either fully complied or that there have been changed\ncircumstances in those other areas of the Agreement. Termination of the entire\nAgreement would therefore be “supported by nothing more than the notion [it is] ‘no\nlonger convenient to live with.’” Smith, 769 F.3d at 574. The “proposed\n\n                                           -8-\n\fmodification” of total termination is therefore not “suitably tailored to the changed\ncircumstances” alleged here, and the school districts’ motion fails under a changed\ncircumstances standard. Id. (quoting Rufo, 502 U.S. at 383).3\n\n                                   III. Conclusion\n\n      We affirm the judgment of the district court.\n                      ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n      3\n        The school districts rely entirely on a change in law to support termination of\nthe Agreement. Thus, while a change in facts may also support a Rule 60(b)(5)\nmotion, there is nothing in the record to support a conclusion that any change in\nfactual circumstances would justify termination of the Agreement in this case. See\nid. at 572 (“Rufo and its progeny grant federal courts of equity substantial flexibility\nto adapt their decrees to changes in the facts or law . . . .”).\n\n                                          -9-\n\f",

Background\n\n       On August 18, 1989, W.T. Davis filed, individually and on behalf of a class of\ntaxpayers of Garland County, Arkansas, a class action lawsuit against Garland County\nalleging that it maintained a racially-segregated public school system in violation of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The parties agreed to settle the\ncase and entered into the Agreement on November 25, 1991. One provision of the\noverall Agreement adopted the School Choice Act, which allowed students to apply\nto attend a school outside of their resident school district, but included a race-based\nlimitation on such transfers. After a fairness hearing, the court entered an order on\nApril 28, 1992, approving the Agreement and dismissing the case with prejudice on\nthe merits.\n\n       In 2012, the district court, as a result of independent litigation, held the\nprovision of the School Choice Act limiting transfers on the basis of race violated the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Teague ex rel. T.T. v. Ark.\nBd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1055</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1065–68 (W.D. Ark. 2012), vacated as moot sub\nnom. Teague v. Cooper, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">720</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">973</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir. 2013).\n\n       The court’s decision was appealed but eventually rendered moot because, in\n2013, the Arkansas legislature repealed the 1989 Act and replaced it with the\nArkansas Public School Choice Act of 2013 (2013 School Choice Act). See Ark.\nCode Ann. § 6-18-1901 et seq. The 2013 School Choice Act removed the race-based\nlimitation on public school transfers and included a provision preventing the receiving\nschool district from discriminating on the basis of race. The Act included, however,\na carve-out restriction: Under the 2013 School Choice Act, nonresident transfers were\nonly permitted “provided that the transfer by the student does not conflict with an\n\n                                         -3-\n\fenforceable judicial decree or court order remedying the effects of past racial\nsegregation in the school district.” Ark. Code Ann. § 6-18-1901(b)(3).\n\n        The school districts wanted to know whether the changes to the state law had\nany effect on their continuing obligations under the Agreement, and on May 22, 2013,\nfiled a petition for declaratory relief seeking continued enforcement of the Agreement.\n The school districts affirmatively argued that the Teague ruling, as well as the 2013\nSchool Choice Act, did not have any impact on the efficacy of the court’s 1992 order\napproving the Agreement and its inclusion of the race-based transfer limitation. The\nschool districts explained that:\n\n      The import [of entering the settlement agreement and obtaining Court\n      approval thereof] was to incorporate by reference the language, terms\n      and provisions of the 1989 Act as a consent desegregation plan of the\n      Court applicable to all public school districts within Garland County,\n      Arkansas, for the purpose of remedy[ing] the vestiges of prior de jure\n      racial segregation within the public education system of Garland County,\n      Arkansas.\n\nThe school districts expressed the view that because the Agreement constituted a court\norder remedying the effects of past discrimination (in other words, a consent decree),\nit fell within the 2013 School Choice Act’s carve-out restriction. The district court\nagreed with the school districts’ assessment that none of the changes in the law had\nimpacted the Settlement, and granted their requested declaratory relief. The district\ncourt stated that “the Settlement Agreement constitutes a court-approved\ndesegregation plan that should remain in effect despite recent changes to the law on\nwhich the Settlement Agreement was partly based.” Davis v. Hot Springs Sch. Dist.,\net. al., No. 6:89-CV-06088, slip op. at 4 (W.D. Ark. June 10, 2013).\n\n      Now, however, the same school districts have taken a different position,\nexplaining that they requested declaratory relief in order to clarify the law during an\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\femergency, but they had “no time” to seek termination of the Agreement in court.\nWhile the type of relief requested may have been affected by timing, the districts state\nthat their position on the issue changed because of subsequent events. According to\nthe districts, “[t]he episode that awoke the Districts to the inequity of the Settlement\nAgreement was the injustice that befell the Walker children, who were denied transfer\nsolely because they are black.” Therefore, on August 25, 2014, the districts filed the\npresent motion for relief from judgment under Rule 60(b)(5), seeking termination of\nthe Agreement and relief from the court’s 1992 order in its entirety, on the grounds\nthat it is no longer just or equitable to give the 1992 order or the Agreement\nprospective application in light of the repeal of the 1989 Act. The district court\nconcluded that the school districts had failed to meet the standard for termination\nunder Rule 60(b)(5) and denied their motion. The school districts timely appeal.\n\n                                    II. Discussion\n\n       Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5) allows the court, “[o]n motion and just\nterms,” to “relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment, order, or\nproceeding” because “the judgment has been satisfied, released or discharged; it is\nbased on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated; or applying it\nprospectively is no longer equitable.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5). The parties dispute\nthe correct standard to apply to the Rule 60(b)(5) motion at issue. The district court\nheld, and the appellees maintain, that in order to terminate the Agreement, the moving\nparty must demonstrate “full compliance,” because the “‘core of the termination\nstandard’ is whether ‘the vestiges of past discrimination ha[ve] been eliminated to the\nextent practicable.’” Davis v. Hot Springs Sch. Dist., et al., No. 6:89-CV-06088, slip\nop. at 5 (W.D. Ark. March 31, 2015) (quoting Smith v. Bd. of Educ. of Palestine-\nWheatley Sch.

Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, which\nrequires a party seeking modification of a consent decree to establish “that a\nsignificant change in circumstances warrants revision.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112679\"><a href=\"/opinion/112679/rufo-v-inmates-of-suffolk-county-jail/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 383 (1992).\nThe school districts allege that the relevant distinction is not one between modification\nand termination, but rather whether the basis for the request is changed circumstances\nor evidence of full compliance. If the modification or termination is based on a\nchange of circumstances, they argue, the Rufo standard should apply. “If the moving\nparty meets this standard, the court should consider whether the proposed\nmodification is suitably tailored to the changed circumstance.” Id.\n\n        We review the appropriate legal standard de novo and the district court’s Rule\n60(b)(5) ruling for abuse of discretion. Smith, 769 F.3d at 568. We agree with the\ndistrict court that the school districts have not shown evidence of full compliance.2\nStill, assuming without deciding that Rufo is the correct standard to apply in this\nsituation, we conclude that the change in the law presented by the school districts,\nstanding alone, is not enough to require termination of the Agreement in this case.\n\n     The school districts argue that even if they have not demonstrated full\ncompliance with the Agreement, their termination motion should be granted based on\n\n\n      2\n       The school districts concede that they are not arguing “the judgment in this\ncase has been satisfied, released, or discharged.” The district court provided the\nschool districts with the opportunity to present any evidence they deemed appropriate,\nbut they did not submit “any evidence to demonstrate full compliance with the\nAgreement” or offer “any proof that the vestiges of past discrimination have been\neliminated,” and the Hot Springs School District (defendant-appellee here) provided\nevidence that the Garland County school districts remain racially identifiable.\n\n                                          -6-\n\fa change in circumstances, namely, a change in the law. While a change in the law\nmay lead to a successful Rule 60(b)(5) motion, see, e.g., Protectoseal Co. v.

The school districts have done\nneither.\n\n       First, the school districts have failed to show that any change in the law affects\ntheir consent decree. The 2013 School Choice Act has a clear carve-out for school\ndistricts subject to an “enforceable judicial decree or court order remedying the effects\nof past racial segregation in the school district.” Ark. Code Ann. § 6-18-1901(b)(3).\nThe school districts present only a 2012 federal district court decision, subsequently\nrendered moot by a change in the law, to show that application of the old School\nChoice Act is prospectively inequitable. See Teague, 873 F. Supp. 2d at 1065–66.\nEven if the case had not been rendered moot, however, they have failed to show why\nit would matter. While “[a] consent decree must of course be modified if, as it later\nturns out, one or more of the obligations placed upon the parties has become\nimpermissible under federal law,” there has been no ruling that the 1989 Act is\nunconstitutional as incorporated into a judicial decree remedying the effects of past\ndiscrimination, and the school districts have not demonstrated why the reasoning that\ndrove the district court’s decision in Teague would render it impermissible for\nindividual school districts to implement in the context of a consent decree the\npractices outlined by the 1989 Act. Rufo, 502 U.S. at 388. To the contrary, Teague’s\nfinding that the 1989 Act was unconstitutional rested on the fact that “[t]he limitation\nexpressed in Ark. Code Ann. § 6-18-206(f) [the race-based transfer limitation]\napplie[d] state-wide without regard to whether a resident or non-resident school\ndistrict ha[d] a history of de jure or de facto segregation.” Teague, 873 F. Supp. 2d\nat 1066.\n\n                                          -7-\n\f       Second, even assuming a relevant change in the law, the school districts—who\nasked for full termination of the Agreement—must show that the purported change\naffects the entire Agreement. In Smith, on which the school districts primarily rely,\n“the [district] court’s finding ‘that the defendants [had] complied in good faith with\nthe remainder of the requirements set forth in the consent decree’” was relevant both\nto whether there was a “sufficient basis for the court to conclude that the District had\ndemonstrated the requisite ‘significant change of circumstances,’” and to whether the\nmodification effectively terminated the entire decree. 769 F.3d at 573–74. Some\nprovisions of the decree were effectively terminated by the court’s order granting the\nschool district’s Rule 60(b)(5) motion, yet other provisions remained unaffected.\nSince extending the school district’s motion to terminate those other provisions would\nbe “supported by nothing more than the notion they are ‘no longer convenient to live\nwith,’” we were confident that “the district court did not intend that its order terminate\nthe entire consent decree.” Id. at 574 (quoting Rufo, 502 U.S. at 383).\n\n      Here, the school districts’ motion to terminate the entire Agreement is similarly\noverbroad, and a change of law that may or may not apply to one section of that\nAgreement is not sufficient to carry their burden. The district court noted in its 2013\norder granting declaratory relief that the Agreement consists of much more\n\n      than the mere implementation of the 1989 Act. It is a contract that also\n      addresses the districts’ staff development, curricula, testing and\n      assessments, special education and gifted-and-talented programs,\n      student-teacher interactions, and other services designed to enhance and\n      improve public education in Garland County.\n\nDavis, No. 6:89-CV-06088, slip op. at 4. The school districts have presented no\nevidence that they have either fully complied or that there have been changed\ncircumstances in those other areas of the Agreement. Termination of the entire\nAgreement would therefore be “supported by nothing more than the notion [it is] ‘no\nlonger convenient to live with.’” Smith, 769 F.3d at 574. The “proposed\n\n                                           -8-\n\fmodification” of total termination is therefore not “suitably tailored to the changed\ncircumstances” alleged here, and the school districts’ motion fails under a changed\ncircumstances standard. Id. (quoting Rufo, 502 U.S. at 383).3\n\n                                   III. Conclusion\n\n      We affirm the judgment of the district court.\n                      ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n      3\n        The school districts rely entirely on a change in law to support termination of\nthe Agreement. Thus, while a change in facts may also support a Rule 60(b)(5)\nmotion, there is nothing in the record to support a conclusion that any change in\nfactual circumstances would justify termination of the Agreement in this case. See\nid. at 572 (“Rufo and its progeny grant federal courts of equity substantial flexibility\nto adapt their decrees to changes in the facts or law . . . .”).\n\n                                          -9-\n\f</pre>",
