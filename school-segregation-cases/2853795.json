Appellants, an association of\nChicago-area churches and five individual member churches\nthereof, appeal from the district court’s entry of summary\njudgment in favor of Appellee, the City of Chicago, on Ap-\npellants’ claims challenging the Chicago Zoning Ordinance\n(“CZO”), 17 MUNICIPAL CODE OF CHICAGO, ILL., §§ 1-11,\nunder the federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized\nPersons Act (“RLUIPA”), 42 UNITED STATES CODE § 2000cc\net seq., and the United States Constitution. For the reasons\nset forth below, we affirm the decision of the district court.\n\f2                                                No. 01-4030\n\n                     BACKGROUND\n  The CZO broadly divides the city into R, B, C, and M\nzones for residential, business, commercial, and manufac-\nturing uses, respectively. Each zone, in turn, is subdivided\ninto numbered districts and subdistricts. A majority of\nChicago land available for development is zoned R. The\nCZO’s stated purposes include the following: (i) “to promote\nand to protect the public health, safety, morals, comfort,\nconvenience, and the general welfare of the people,” and (ii)\n“to protect the character and maintain the stability for\nresidential, business, commercial, and manufacturing areas\nwithin the City, and to promote the orderly and beneficial\ndevelopment of such areas.” See 17 MUN. CODE CHI. § 2\n(1), (3) (2001). Churches are permitted uses as of right in all\nR zones, but are termed Variations in the Nature of Special\nUses (“Special Use”) in all B zones as well as C1, C2, C3,\nand C5 districts. All Special Uses, whether of a religious or\nnonreligious nature, require approval by the Zoning Board\nof Appeals (“ZBA”) following a public hearing. See id. §§ 7.3-\n1(4), 8.4, 9.4, & 11.10. Special Use approval is expressly\nconditioned upon the design, location, and operation of the\nproposed use consistent with the protection of public health,\nsafety, and welfare, and the proposed use must not substan-\ntially injure the value of neighboring property. See id.\n§ 11.10-4. Factoring such expenses as application, title\nsearch, and legal fees, as well as appraisal and neighbor\nnotification costs, the aggregate cost of obtaining Special\nUse approval approaches $5000. Before a church may locate\nin a C4 district or an M zone, the Chicago City Council\nmust vote in favor of a Map Amendment, effectively\nrezoning the targeted parcel. See id. §§ 9.4-4, 10, & 11.9.\nDevelopment for church use of land consisting of two or\nmore acres (necessary for congregations exceeding roughly\n500 members) requires approval by City Council vote of a\nPlanned Development. See id. § 11.11-1(a) & 11.11-3.\n\fNo. 01-4030                                                      3\n\n  Civil Liberties for Urban Believers (“CLUB”) is an\nunincorporated association of 40 to 50 Chicago-area reli-\ngious or not-for-profit Illinois corporations ranging in size\nfrom 15 to 15,000 congregants. Five of these individual\nmember churches1 joined CLUB as plaintiffs in an action\nchallenging the validity of the CZO. The district court\nsummarized as follows the encounters of the five individual\nplaintiff churches with Chicago’s zoning framework as\nalleged in Appellants’ complaint:\n    Christ Center began meeting in a high school audito-\n    rium in 1990, but soon experienced difficulties at this\n    location due to various school functions that interrupted\n    weekly worship. As a result, Christ Center began\n    searching for a building to purchase. The church was\n    unsuccessful in locating an appropriate building in any\n    R districts. In the summer of 1992, Christ Center\n    located a suitable building at 1139-43 West Madison in\n    Chicago. The building was located in a C district and\n    Christ Center promptly applied for a special use permit.\n    After completing the application process, Christ Center\n    reached out to gain the support of neighbors and\n    Alderman Theodore Mazola. Most neighbors favored a\n    taxpaying entity in the neighborhood rather than a\n    church and Alderman Mazola stated that he would\n    support the church’s special use permit on any street\n    but Madison. The Zoning Board eventually convened a\n    special hearing on September 18, 1992. On October 18,\n    1992, the special use permit was denied. Christ Center\n    subsequently found a second building in an M district\n    at 123 South Morgan. The owner of the building also\n    agreed to provide financing. However, the Chicago\n\n\n1\n  Those five Churches are (i) Christ Center; (ii) Christian\nCovenant Outreach Church (“Christian Covenant”); (iii) His Word\nMinistries to All Nations (“His Word”); (iv) Christian Bible Church\n(“Christian Bible”); and (v) Monte de Sion Church (“Mount Zion”).\n\f4                                              No. 01-4030\n\n    Department of Planning and Development informed\n    Christ Center that it would oppose any rezoning appli-\n    cation because the particular area was designated to\n    become an entertainment area and the presence of a\n    church would inhibit such development. Christ Center\n    subsequently choose not to file an application for\n    rezoning. In the fall of 1993, Christ Center obtained\n    property at 4445 South King Drive, successfully ob-\n    tained a special use permit and now operates a church\n    at this location. Christ Center now claims that it paid\n    substantial sums in attorneys fees, appraisal fees,\n    zoning application charges, title charges and other\n    expenses attempting to find suitable property.\n    Between 1986 and the summer of 1988, Christian Bible\n    met in a private home. The church eventually outgrew\n    this space and began meeting in a funeral home. The\n    funeral home, however, proved aesthetically and\n    administratively problematic. In 1990, Christian Bible\n    located a suitable building in a B district at 83rd and\n    Essex. Alderman Beavers promptly informed Christian\n    Bible that “he would not allow” a church at that loca-\n    tion. Consequently, Christian Bible did not apply for a\n    special use permit at this location. In March 1991,\n    Christian Bible purchased property in another B\n    district at 513-23 East 75th Street. The Park Manor\n    Neighbors Association and Alderman Steele both\n    opposed the church’s special use permit application. On\n    May 17, 1991, the permit was denied. Christian Bible\n    then unsuccessfully attempted to sell the building for\n    10 months. In February 1992, Christian Bible reno-\n    vated the building to enhance its appearance. During\n    these renovations, the church rented space at another\n    location, or held meetings at private homes. Christian\n    Bible later reapplied for a special use permit which was\n    granted on August 20, 1993 with the support of neigh-\n    bors in the district. Christian Bible now claims the\n\fNo. 01-4030                                              5\n\n   delay in obtaining a special use permit prevented the\n   church from obtaining a real estate tax exemption. The\n   church further alleges that it also paid substantial\n   sums in expenses related to the application process and\n   also suffered a decrease in membership. Christian Bible\n   now owns and meets at a church at 6210 S. St. Louis\n   and has successfully obtained a special use permit to\n   operate the church.\n   From February, 1988 to December, 1993, Mount Zion\n   rented space in a C district at 4545 North Kedzie.\n   During this period, Mount Zion never applied for a\n   special use permit. In 1990, a [Chicago] inspector\n   ordered Mount Zion to vacate the building. In April\n   1993, Mount Zion located suitable rental property at\n   3949 North Pulaski, and applied for a special use\n   permit. During this process, the Zoning Board informed\n   Mount Zion that the building lacked adequate parking\n   accommodations for a church and both the building and\n   each parking lot would require special use permits.\n   Alderman Wojcik and a neighborhood group also\n   opposed Mount Zion’s application. Consequently, Mount\n   Zion withdrew its application for a special use permit.\n   Mount Zion now owns and meets in a church at 3807 N.\n   Lavergne.\n   On November 1, 1992, Christian Covenant first rented\n   property in a C district. The owner of the building\n   offered to co-sign a loan enabling Christian Covenant to\n   purchase the property. However, [Chicago] inspectors\n   ordered Christian Covenant to stop using the building\n   as a church without a special use permit. As a result,\n   Christian Covenant did not purchase the building out\n   of fear [Chicago] would not allow the building to be\n   used as a church without a special use permit. Chris-\n   tian Covenant now owns and meets in a church located\n   in an R district.\n\f6                                               No. 01-4030\n\n    Between 1990 and 1992, His Word met in the basement\n    of a private home until membership outgrew these\n    accommodations. In 1992, His Word located a suitable\n    building in a C district at 1616 West Pershing. On\n    March 27, 1992, the church signed a purchase contract\n    contingent upon the grant of a special use permit. After\n    filing their special use permit application, His Word\n    met with neighbors in the district who generally\n    supported it. Alderman Patrick Huels stated he would\n    neither support nor oppose the application. On three\n    separate occasions, at the request of Alderman Huels,\n    the [ZBA] postponed a hearing on His Word’s applica-\n    tion. On October 14, 1992, Alderman Huels introduced\n    an amendment to the [CZO] to rezone the property\n    located at 1616 West Pershing from a C district to an M\n    district. After a hearing on December 10, 1992, Alder-\n    man William Banks and other aldermen on the Chicago\n    Committee on Zoning of the Chicago City Council voted\n    to recommend approval of the amendment. Both His\n    Word and Citibank, the owner of the building, opposed\n    the rezoning. On December 15, 1992, the Chicago City\n    Council voted to enact the rezoning amendment chang-\n    ing 1616 West Pershing from a C district to an M\n    district. His Word subsequently withdrew its applica-\n    tion for a special use permit; the church spent a consid-\n    erable sum on filing, attorney’s and appraiser’s fees.\n    His Word now owns and meets in a church located in an\n    R district.\nCivil Liberties for Urban Believers v. Chicago, 157\nF.Supp.2d 903, 907-08 (N.D. Ill. 2001).\n  This appeal from the district court’s summary judgment\nruling in favor of Chicago on Appellants’ fourth amended\ncomplaint reaches us via a long and tortuous procedural\n\fNo. 01-4030                                                      7\n\npath.2 Appellants amended their original complaint to\nremove claims challenging the CZO under the federal\nReligious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C. 2000bb et\nseq. (“RFRA”), after the Supreme Court invalidated relevant\nprovisions of RFRA in City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507\n(1997). In February 2000, in response to Appellants’\nremaining constitutional challenges to the CZO’s designa-\ntion of churches vis-à-vis various nonreligious assembly\nuses in B, C, and M zones, the City Council amended the\nCZO to require clubs, lodges, meeting halls, recreation\nbuildings, and community centers to obtain Special Use\napproval in order to locate within any B and C zones and a\nMap Amendment in order to locate within any M zone. The\namendments also (i) exempt churches from the requirement\nthat a Special Use applicant affirmatively demonstrate that\nthe proposed use “is necessary for the public convenience at\nthat location” and (ii) provide that a Special Use permit\nshall automatically issue in the event that the ZBA fails to\nrender a decision within 120 days of the date of application.\nSeveral months thereafter, Congress reacted to the Su-\npreme Court’s decision in City of Boerne with the enactment\nof RLUIPA and Appellants subsequently amended their\ncomplaint once more to include claims against Chicago\npursuant to RLUIPA.3\n\n\n2\n  The procedural history includes an opinion of this Court holding\nthat legislative immunity shields Chicago Aldermen William\nBanks and Patrick Huels from any liability arising out of their\nzoning-related actions. Plaintiffs Ira Iglesia de la Biblia Abierta\nand His Word sought to hold the aldermen personally liable for\nalleged civil rights violations resulting from the aldermen’s\nintroduction of legislation intended to rezone 1616 West Pershing\nRoad, effectively preventing its use as a church. See Iglesia de la\nBiblia Abierta v. Banks, 129 F.3d 899 (7th Cir. 1997); and Civil\nLiberties for Urban Believers, 157 F.Supp.2d at 908.\n3\n  Noting that the district court’s opinion narrates more thor-\noughly the procedural history of this case, see 157 F.Supp.2d at\n                                                    (continued...)\n\f8                                                 No. 01-4030\n\n  In addition to the RLUIPA claim, Appellants’ final\namended complaint argued, in part, that the CZO and the\nadministrative and legislative processes for obtaining\nSpecial Use, Map Amendment, and Planned Development\napproval violate Appellants’ rights to (i) free exercise of\nreligion, speech, and assembly under the First Amendment\nof the United States Constitution, (ii) equal protection\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States\nConstitution as well as the Illinois Constitution, and (iii)\nprocedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendment\nof the United States Constitution. Appellants also claimed\nthat the rezoning of 1616 West Pershing Road (“Pershing”)\nviolated His Word’s constitutional rights.4\n  In granting summary judgment in favor of Chicago, the\ndistrict court determined that the February 2000 amend-\nments to the CZO removed “any potential substantial\nburden” on religious exercise, such that Chicago\n    avoid[ed] the preemptive force of any provision of\n    [RLUIPA] by changing the policy or practice that\n    result[ed] in a substantial burden on religious exercise,\n    by retaining the policy or practice and exempting the\n    substantially burdened religious exercise, by providing\n    exemptions from the policy or practice for applications\n    that substantially burden religious exercise, or by any\n    other means that eliminate[ed] the substantial burden.\n42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-3(e). With respect to Appellants’ equal\nprotection claims, the district court concluded that Chi-\ncago’s zoning scheme is rationally related to a legitimate\n\n\n3\n  (...continued)\n905-08, we limit our opinion to include only those procedural\ndetails directly relating to our disposition of this appeal.\n4\n  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c), the district court dismissed\nwithout prejudice Appellants’ claim under the Illinois Religious\nFreedom Restoration Act, 775 ILL. COMP. STAT. § 35/15.\n\fNo. 01-4030                                                9\n\ngovernment purpose and thus constitutional. The district\ncourt also rejected Appellants’ due process claims, noting\nthat City Council and ZBA legislative procedures and\npractices afforded Appellants what minimal process is due\nin zoning cases. In its discussion of Appellants’ First\nAmendment claims, the district court explained that the\nCZO and its Special Use provisions are neutral and gener-\nally applicable law which do not impermissibly burden the\nfree exercise of religion, and that the operation of a church\nis subject to zoning laws, even where such operation\ninvolves conduct within the core of the First Amend-\nment—here, religious speech and assembly. Finally, while\nacknowledging that the conduct of Alderman Huels in\nconnection with the Pershing rezoning was “egregious” and\nperhaps “dishonorable”, the district court relied on this\nCourt’s decision in Biblia Abierta, 129 F.3d at 901-02, to\nconclude that such legislative action was constitutional\ninsofar as it (i) afforded His Word procedural due process,\n(ii) was taken subject to neutral and generally applicable\nordinances, and (iii) was rationally related to Chicago’s\nlegitimate interests in developing the commercial areas\nadjacent to the parcel while avoiding land-use conflicts.\n  The district court subsequently denied Appellants’\nmotion, pursuant to Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure (“FRCP”), to reconsider its summary judgment.\nSee Civil Liberties for Urban Believers v. Chicago, No. 94 C\n6151 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 29, 2002). This appeal ensued.\n\n\n                        ANALYSIS\n  We review the district court’s grant of summary judgment\nde novo. See, e.g., Freedom of Religion Foundation v.\nBugher, 249 F.3d 606, 610 (7th Cir. 2001). Summary\njudgment is proper where there is no genuine issue as to\nany material fact. Such is the case where the nonmoving\nparty has failed to make a sufficient showing on an essen-\n\f10                                                     No. 01-4030\n\ntial element of his case with respect to which he has the\nburden of proof, because a complete failure of proof concern-\ning an essential element of his case necessarily renders all\nother facts immaterial. In such a case, the moving party is\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law and summary\njudgment must issue against the nonmoving party. Celotex\nCorp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986); FED. R. CIV. P.\n56(c).\n\n\n    I. Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act\n  Appellants argue that the CZO violates RLUIPA’s\nsubstantial burden provision, which requires land-use\nregulations that substantially burden religious exercise to\nbe the least restrictive means of advancing a compelling\ngovernment interest, see 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc(a), as well as its\nnondiscrimination provision, which prohibits land-use\nregulations that either disfavor religious uses relative to\nnonreligious uses or unreasonably exclude religious uses\nfrom a particular jurisdiction, see 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc(b).5\n\n\n5\n    In relevant part, those provisions read as follows:\n    § 2000cc. Protection of land use as religious exercise.\n      (a) Substantial burdens.\n        (1) General rule. No government shall impose or imple-\n        ment a land use regulation in a manner that imposes a\n        substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person,\n        including a religious assembly or institution, unless the\n        government demonstrates that imposition of the burden\n        on that person, assembly, or institution—\n          (A) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental\n          interest; and\n          (B) is the least restrictive means of furthering that\n          compelling governmental interest.\n                                                    (continued...)\n\fNo. 01-4030                                                          11\n\n  In order to prevail on a claim under the substantial\nburden provision, a plaintiff must first demonstrate that\nthe regulation at issue actually imposes a substantial\nburden on religious exercise. RLUIPA defines “religious\nexercise” to encompass “any exercise of religion, whether or\nnot compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief,”\nincluding “[t]he use, building, or conversion of real property\nfor the purpose of religious exercise.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-\n5(7). This definition reveals Congress’s intent to expand the\nconcept of religious exercise contemplated both in decisions\n\n\n5\n    (...continued)\n          (2) Scope of application. This subsection applies in any\n          case in which. . .\n          (C) the substantial burden is imposed in the implemen-\n          tation of a land use regulation or system of land use\n          regulations, under which a government makes, or has\n          in place formal or informal procedures or practices that\n          permit the government to make, individualized assess-\n          ments of the proposed uses for the property involved.\n      (b) Discrimination and exclusion.\n        (1) Equal terms. No government shall impose or imple-\n        ment a land use regulation in a manner that treats a\n        religious assembly or institution on less than equal terms\n        with a nonreligious assembly or institution.\n        (2) Nondiscrimination. No government shall impose or\n        implement a land use regulation that discriminates\n        against any assembly or institution on the basis of\n        religion or religious denomination.\n        (3) Exclusions and limits. No government shall impose or\n        implement a land use regulation that—\n          (A) totally excludes religious assemblies from a jurisdic-\n          tion; or\n          (B) unreasonably limits religious assemblies, institutions,\n          or structures within a jurisdiction.\n42 U.S.C. § 2000cc.\n\f12                                               No. 01-4030\n\ndiscussing the precursory RFRA, see, e.g., Hicks v. Garner,\n69 F.3d 22, 26 n. 22 (5th Cir. 1995) (collecting cases defin-\ning “substantial burden on religious exercise” under RFRA),\nand in traditional First Amendment jurisprudence, see, e.g.,\nHernandez v. Commissioner, 490 U.S. 680, 699 (1989)\n(religious exercise as “the observation of a central religious\nbelief or practice” (citations omitted)); Thomas v. Review\nBd. of the Indiana Employment Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707, 718,\n(1981) (religious exercise as behavior and beliefs compelled\nby a particular religion); Sherbert v.

Although the text of the statute\ncontains no similar express definition of the term “substan-\ntial burden,” RLUIPA’s legislative history indicates that it\nis to be interpreted by reference to RFRA and First Amend-\nment jurisprudence. See 146 CONG. REC. 7774-01, 7776\n(“The term ‘substantial burden’ as used in this Act is not\nintended to be given any broader interpretation than the\nSupreme Court’s articulation of the concept of substantial\nburden or religious exercise”). Chicago cites a decision of\nthis Court which held that, within the meaning of RFRA, a\nsubstantial burden on religious exercise “is one that forces\nadherents of a religion to refrain from religiously motivated\nconduct, inhibits or constrains conduct or expression that\nmanifests a central tenet of a person’s religious beliefs, or\ncompels conduct or expression that is contrary to those\nbeliefs.” Mack v. O’Leary, 80 F.3d 1175, 1179 (7th Cir. 1996)\n(vacated on other grounds). Substituting RLUIPA’s broader\ndefinition of religious exercise, which need not be “com-\npelled by or central to” a particular religion, for that\narticulated in Mack, the meaning of “substantial burden on\nreligious exercise” could be read to include the effect of any\nregulation that “inhibits or constrains the use, building, or\nconversion of real property for the purpose of religious\nexercise.” Such a construction might lend support to Appel-\nlants’ contention that the CZO, insofar as it contributes to\nother existing constraints upon the use of specific parcels as\n\fNo. 01-4030                                                13\n\nchurches, substantially burdens religious exercise. How-\never, this cannot be the correct construction of “substantial\nburden on religious exercise” under RLUIPA. Application of\nthe substantial burden provision to a regulation inhibiting\nor constraining any religious exercise, including the use of\nproperty for religious purposes, would render meaningless\nthe word “substantial,” because the slightest obstacle to\nreligious exercise incidental to the regulation of land\nuse—however minor the burden it were to impose—could\nthen constitute a burden sufficient to trigger RLUIPA’s\nrequirement that the regulation advance a compelling\ngovernmental interest by the least restrictive means. We\ntherefore hold that, in the context of RLUIPA’s broad\ndefinition of religious exercise, a land-use regulation that\nimposes a substantial burden on religious exercise is one\nthat necessarily bears direct, primary, and fundamental\nresponsibility for rendering religious exercise—including\nthe use of real property for the purpose thereof within the\nregulated jurisdiction generally—effectively impracticable.\n  Appellants contend that the scarcity of affordable land\navailable for development in R zones, along with the costs,\nprocedural requirements, and inherent political aspects of\nthe Special Use, Map Amendment, and Planned Develop-\nment approval processes, impose precisely such a substan-\ntial burden. However, we find that these conditions—which\nare incidental to any high-density urban land use—do not\namount to a substantial burden on religious exercise. While\nthey may contribute to the ordinary difficulties associated\nwith location (by any person or entity, religious or nonreli-\ngious) in a large city, they do not render impracticable the\nuse of real property in Chicago for religious exercise, much\nless discourage churches from locating or attempting to\nlocate in Chicago. See, e.g., Love Church v. City of Evanston,\n896 F.2d 1082, 1086 (7th Cir. 1990) (“Whatever specific\ndifficulties [plaintiff church] claims to have encountered,\nthey are the same ones that face all [land users]. The harsh\n\f14                                               No. 01-4030\n\nreality of the marketplace sometimes dictates that certain\nfacilities are not available to those who desire them”).\nSignificantly, each of the five individual plaintiff churches\nhas successfully located within Chicago’s city limits. That\nthey expended considerable time and money so to do does\nnot entitle them to relief under RLUIPA’s substantial\nburden provision. See, e.g., Stuart Circle Parish v. Board of\nZoning Appeals of Richmond, 946 F. Supp. 1225, 1237 (E.D.\nVa. 1996) (“It is well established that there is no substan-\ntial burden placed on an individual’s free exercise of\nreligion where a law or policy merely ‘operates so as to\nmake the practice of [the individual’s] religious beliefs more\nexpensive.’ ”) (quoting Braunfeld v. Brown, 366 U.S. 599,\n605, (1961) (plurality opinion)). Otherwise, compliance with\nRLUIPA would require municipal governments not merely\nto treat religious land uses on an equal footing with nonreli-\ngious land uses, but rather to favor them in the form of an\noutright exemption from land-use regulations. Unfortu-\nnately for Appellants, no such free pass for religious land\nuses masquerades among the legitimate protections\nRLUIPA affords to religious exercise.\n  Though the substantial burden and nondiscrimination\nprovisions are operatively independent of one another,\nRLUIPA’s governmental discretion provision, 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000cc-3(e), upon which the district court relied in order\nto find that the February 2000 CZO amendments corrected\nany violation of the substantial burden provision, appears\nnot to reflect this distinction. That subsection provides, in\npart, that “a government may avoid the preemptive force of\nany provision of [RLUIPA] by changing the policy or\npractice that results in a substantial burden on religious\nexercise.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-3(e) (emphasis added). Rather\nthan remove any substantial burden on religious exercise,\nhowever, the February 2000 amendments simply place\nchurches on an equal footing with nonreligious assembly\nuses, thereby correcting any potential violation of the\n\fNo. 01-4030                                                    15\n\nnondiscrimination provision. Despite subsection 2000cc-\n3(e)’s reference to removal of a “substantial burden,” we\nread it to afford a government the discretion to take\ncorrective action to eliminate a nondiscrimination provision\nviolation, whether or not it was the result of a substantial\nburden on religious exercise. Thus do we find that, under\nRLUIPA’s governmental discretion provision, the February\n2000 amendments to the CZO render RLUIPA’s nondiscrim-\nination provision inapplicable to this case.6\n  Insofar as Appellants cannot demonstrate on these facts\nthat the CZO substantially burdens religious exercise, and\nbecause the February 2000 Amendments to the CZO bring\nit into compliance with RLUIPA’s nondiscrimination\nprovision, Appellants fail to make a sufficient showing on\nessential elements of their RLUIPA claims. Chicago is\ntherefore entitled to summary judgment on those claims.\n  Having found RLUIPA inapplicable to the facts of this\ncase, we need not address the issue of RLUIPA’s constitu-\ntionality, raised by the parties as well as the United States\nof America, as Intervenor, and various Amici Curiae.\n\n\n\n6\n  Appellants also challenge the district court’s ruling that their\nclaims under the pre-2000 CZO are moot. They claim that\nchurches, like other nonreligious assembly uses, should have been\npermitted uses in all zones, in which case plaintiff churches would\nnot have been subject to Special Use approval procedures. They\nallege damages resulting from the costs associated with these\nprocedures. This argument ignores the fact that the primary effect\nof the 2000 amendments was to impose similar restrictions on\nnon-religious assembly uses, rather than to relax restrictions on\nchurches. Appellants cannot demonstrate that the amended CZO\nrecognizes any preexisting right of churches to operate in B, Z, or\nM zones. The amendments simply place restrictions on nonreli-\ngious assembly uses that are similar to or greater than those\nfacing religious uses. As such, the district court correctly con-\ncluded that Appellant’s pre-2000 CZO claims are moot.\n\f16                                               No. 01-4030\n\n  II. Constitutionality of the Chicago Zoning Ordinance\n  Under the Free Exercise Clause of First Amendment of\nthe United States Constitution, made applicable to state\nand local governments by the Fourteenth Amendment, no\nlaw may prohibit the free exercise of religion. Prior to\nRLUIPA’s enactment, two Supreme Court decisions held\nthat no Free Exercise Clause violation results where a\nburden on religious exercise is the incidental effect of a\nneutral, generally applicable, and otherwise valid regula-\ntion, in which case such regulation need not be justified by\na compelling governmental interest. Employment Division,\nDepartment of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494\nU.S. 872 (1990); Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v.\nCity of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520 (1993). Appellants cite Smith\nand Hialeah as additional authority for application of the\ncompelling governmental interest and least restrictive\nmeans tests to the CZO, not unlike those urged under\nRLUIPA.\n  Appellants first argue that the CZO lacks facial neutrality\nbecause, like the law at issue in Hialeah, the CZO “refers to\na religious practice”—use of property as a church—“without\na secular meaning discernable from the language or con-\ntext.” 508 U.S. at 530. In that case, the City of Hialeah\nreacted to the intention of practitioners of the Santería\nreligion to establish a church within city limits by passing\nordinances banning public ritual sacrifice, a distinguishing\nelement of the Santería religious tradition. The Court\nexplained that a law is not neutral if its object “is to\ninfringe upon or restrict practices because of their religious\nmotivation,” and then found that the Hialeah ordinances’\nuse of the words “sacrifice” and “ritual”, which have “strong\nreligious connotations,” was evidence of their purposeful\ntargeting of Santería practices. Appellants assert by\nanalogy that the CZO’s explicit inclusion of “church” among\nthe various land uses it regulates indicates that it discrimi-\nnates against churches on its face. Unlike the Hialeah\n\fNo. 01-4030                                                     17\n\nordinances, however, the text of the CZO includes “church”\nas just one among many and varied religious and nonreli-\ngious regulated uses.7 More importantly, nothing in the\nrecord suggests, nor do Appellants articulate in anything\nbut conclusory terms, that the object and purpose of the\nCZO are anything other than those expressly stated\ntherein. See 17 MUN. CODE CHI. § 2.\n  In addition to their facial challenge under the Free\nExercise Clause as interpreted in Hialeah, Appellants\nallege that the CZO was not neutrally applied to His Word\nduring the course of Alderman Huels’ successful efforts to\ninitiate the rezoning of 1616 West Pershing Road.8 While\nthey concede that Alderman Huels may not be held person-\nally liable for his actions based on our decision in Biblia\nAbierta, 129 F.3d at 901-02, Appellants argue that his\nactions were legislative acts which improperly targeted His\nWord. However,\n    [m]unicipal liability attaches only where the\n    decisionmaker possesses final authority to establish\n\n\n7\n   The variety of regulated uses specifically referenced in the text\nof the CZO can be gleaned from the following non-exhaustive list\nof examples: dwellings, nurseries, rectories, parish houses, golf\ncourses, libraries, convents, monasteries, schools, parks, play-\ngrounds, day care centers, hospitals, clubs, lodges, restaurants,\nwireless communications facilities, cemeteries, parking lots,\nhotels, photography studios, pet shops, fraternity houses, muse-\nums, correctional institutions, tattoo parlors, pawn shops, taverns,\nkiddie parks, inter-track wagering facilities, earth station\nantennas, frozen food lockers, live bait stores, banks, barbershops,\nand paint pellet arenas.\n8\n  In a single sentence, Appellants also allege due process and\nequal protection violations as a result of the rezoning of 1616 West\nPershing Road. Though it is difficult even to evaluate claims\noffered in terms as conclusory as these, we find them meritless for\nthe same reasons that we are unmoved by Appellants’ Free\nExercise claims.\n\f18                                               No. 01-4030\n\n     municipal policy with respect to the action ordered. The\n     fact that a particular official—even a policymaking\n     official—has discretion in the exercise of particular\n     functions does not, without more, give rise to municipal\n     liability based on an exercise of that discretion.\nPembaur v. Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 481-82 (1986). Here,\nthe possibility that Alderman Huels’ motives for wanting to\nhave the property rezoned were illicit in no way demon-\nstrates that the City Council and the Mayor, who have final\nauthority under state law to enact city ordinances, see 65\nI.L.C.S. §§ 5/1-2-1(2), endorsed any such motives. Absent\nsome evidence that the policy-making body, in this case the\nCity Council, approved both the rezoning and the illicit\nmotivation therefor—and Appellants offer none—Chicago\ncannot be held liable for Alderman Huels’ actions. See, e.g.,\nCity of St. Louis v. Prapotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 128-30 (1988)\n(plurality opinion); id. at 140-42 (Brennan, J., concurring in\nthe judgment).\n  Appellants also contend that the CZO is not generally\napplicable, in that the Special Use, Map Amendment, and\nPlanned Development processes create discretionary,\nindividualized exemptions to the CZO which are then\nimpermissibly withheld from churches. As support for this\nproposition, they cite the Supreme Court’s pronouncement\nthat “[i]n circumstances in which individualized exemptions\nfrom a general requirement are available, the government\n‘may not refuse to extend that system to cases of “religious\nhardship” without compelling reason.’ ” Hialeah, 508 U.S. at\n537 (quoting Smith, 494 U.S. at 844 (citation omitted)).\nEven assuming, arguendo, that the burdens incidental to\nchurches seeking Special Use, Map Amendment, or Planned\nDevelopment approval amount to “religious hardship”\nwithin the meaning of the Court’s decision in Hialeah,\nAppellants appear to confuse exemption from a particular\nzoning provision (in the form of Special Use, Map Amend-\nment, or Planned Development approval) with exemption\n\fNo. 01-4030                                               19\n\nfrom the procedural system by which such approval may be\nsought. Under the CZO, these alternate avenues of zoning\napproval are not merely available to any would-be appli-\ncant, as Hialeah requires. They are mandatory. In short, no\nperson, nor any nonconforming land use, is exempt from the\nprocedural system in place for Special Use, Map Amend-\nment, or Planned Development approval specifically, or the\nCZO generally. Furthermore, the experiences of plaintiff\nchurches Christ Center and Christian Bible, each of which\nwas initially denied—and subsequently granted—Special\nUse approval, demonstrates that Chicago has extended\nSpecial Use exemptions to churches. It is clear to this Court\nthat it is neither the policy nor the practice of Chicago to\nrefuse to extend to churches its system of individualized\nexemptions and, thus, that the CZO is a generally applica-\nble system of land-use regulation.\n  In Smith, the Supreme Court noted that, in cases impli-\ncating the Free Exercise Clause in conjunction with other\nconstitutional protections, such as freedom of speech and\nfreedom of association, the First Amendment may subject\nthe application to religiously motivated action of a neutral,\ngenerally applicable law to a heightened level of scrutiny.\nSmith, 494 U.S. at 881-82. Seizing upon this principle,\nAppellants maintain that their Free Exercise claim involves\nhybrid rights of free exercise, freedom of speech, freedom of\nassembly, and equal protection, such that Chicago must\njustify the CZO’s incidental burdens on church location with\na compelling state interest. Based on the analyses of\nAppellants’ speech, assembly, and equal protection claims\nthat follow, however, we find them individually lacking the\nmerit necessary to withstand summary judgment. We agree\nwith the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that “a\nplaintiff does not allege a hybrid rights claim entitled to\nstrict scrutiny analysis merely by combining a free exercise\nclaim with an utterly meritless claim of the violation of\nanother alleged fundamental right.” Miller v. Reed, 176\nF.3d 1202, 1207-08 (9th Cir. 1999). Accord, e.g., Swanson v.\n\f20                                               No. 01-4030\n\nGuthrie Independent School District, 135 F.3d 694, 700\n(10th Cir. 1998); Brown v. Hot, Sexy, and Safer Products,\nInc., 68 F.3d 525, 539 (1st Cir. 1995); Kissinger v. Board of\nTrustees, 5 F.3d 177, 180 (6th Cir. 1993). Appellants have\nidentified no constitutionally protected interest upon which\nthe CZO infringes, as they must in order to establish a\nhybrid rights claim requiring heightened scrutiny.\n  Of Appellants’ remaining constitutional claims, the first\nalleges that the CZO violates Appellants’ First Amendment\nrights to freedom of speech and freedom of assembly\nbecause the CZO is neither (i) content neutral nor (ii)\nnarrowly tailored to serve a legitimate governmental\nobjective and (iii) does not leave open ample channels of\nalternative communication. See Ward v. Rock Against\nRacism, 491 U.S. 781, 782 (1989) (articulating these three\ncriteria for valid time, place, and manner restrictions on\nspeech and assembly). Appellants state in conclusory terms\nthat the CZO discriminates against religious uses, is\n“irrational and arbitrary,” restricts churches to R zones, and\nis not narrowly tailored. They also state that the CZO’s\nrequirement that churches occupying more than two acres\nobtain Planned Development approval creates a practical\nban on large churches. As discussed previously, the CZO is\nneutral and generally applicable and places churches on a\nfooting equal with, if not superior to, that of nonreligious\nassembly uses. Similarly, to the extent that the CZO\nincidentally regulates speech or assembly within churches,\nsuch regulation is motivated not by any disagreement that\nChicago might have with the message conveyed by church\nspeech or assembly, but rather by such legitimate, practical\nconsiderations as the promotion of harmonious and efficient\nland use. In this respect it is content neutral. In order to\nsatisfy the requirement that it is narrowly tailored, “a\nregulation need not be the least restrictive or least intrusive\nmeans.” Ward, 491 U.S. at 798. It need only further “a\nsubstantial government interest that would be achieved less\neffectively absent the regulation.” Id. at 799. There is no\n\fNo. 01-4030                                                21\n\nquestion that Chicago—like any population center—has a\nsubstantial interest in regulating the use of its land and\nthat the CZO promotes that interest. We are also unper-\nsuaded by Appellants’ implicit suggestion that the restric-\ntion of church use as of right to R zones leaves churches\nwith insufficient channels of communication. Not only may\nchurches freely disseminate religious speech in a majority\nof Chicago land zoned for development, but they may also\ndisseminate—and, in the cases of plaintiffs Christ Center\nand Christian Bible, have in fact disseminated—religious\nspeech in B and various C districts with Special Use\napproval. Similarly, the Planned Development approval\nprocess provides larger churches with ample opportunity to\nlocate within Chicago in a manner consistent with the\nCZO’s legitimate, stated purposes. For these reasons,\nAppellants’ First Amendment freedom of speech and\nfreedom of assembly claims are without merit.\n  Appellants further argue that the CZO violates the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment—which\nprovides that no state shall “deny to any person within its\njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws”—by treating\nchurches in a manner less favorable than that of nonreli-\ngious assembly uses. It is the well established law of this\nCircuit that, “[a]bsent a fundamental right or a suspect\nclass, to demonstrate a viable equal protection claim in the\nland use context, a plaintiff must demonstrate governmen-\ntal action wholly impossible to relate to legitimate govern-\nmental objectives.” Forseth v. Village of Sussex, 199 F.3d\n363, 370-71 (7th Cir. 2001); see also City of Cleburne v.\nCleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. 432, 440 (1985) (unless a\nstatute classifies by race, alienage, or national origin or\nimpinges on fundamental constitutional rights, “[t]he\ngeneral rule is that legislation is presumed to be valid and\nwill be sustained if the classification drawn by the statute\nis rationally related to a legitimate state interest”). Appel-\nlants urge us to elevate the level of scrutiny under which we\nreview their equal protection claim against the CZO\n\f22                                               No. 01-4030\n\nbecause the regulation of a church’s use of land necessarily\nimplicates the fundamental right of freedom of religious\nexercise. As a preliminary matter, we are quick to reiterate\nour earlier determination that any burdens on religious\nexercise imposed by the CZO are both incidental and\ninsubstantial. Furthermore, this court has held that the\nfundamental rights theory of heightened equal protection\nscrutiny applies only to laws that effect “grave interference\nwith important religious tenets or . . . affirmatively compel\n[congregants] to perform acts undeniably at odds with\nfundamental tenets of their religious beliefs.” Griffin High\nSchool v. Illinois High School Athletic Assoc., 822 F.2d 671,\n674 (7th Cir. 1987). Whatever the obstacles that the CZO\nmight present to a church’s ability to locate on a specific\nplot of Chicago land, they in no way regulate the right, let\nalone interfere with the ability, of an individual to adhere\nto the central tenets of his religious beliefs. As the district\ncourt adroitly noted, the CZO’s limitations on church\nlocation are “not the regulation of belief, any more than\nregulating the location of the Chicago Tribune building is\nthe regulation of the newspaper’s [F]irst [A]mendment-\nprotected product.” Civil Liberties for Urban Believers, 157\nF.Supp.2d at 908.\n  Viewed through the lens of the Cleburne and Forseth\nrational basis analyses, Chicago’s system of land-use\nregulation satisfies the requirements of the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause. In general, a zoning ordinance imposing\n“restrictions in respect of the use and occupation of private\nlands in urban communities” such as the “segregation of\nresidential, business, and industrial buildings” satisfies the\nrational basis test as “a valid exercise of authority.” Village\nof Euclid v. Amber Realty Company, 272 U.S. 365, 386-87,\n394, 397 (1926). Here, Chicago permits churches to locate in\nR districts as of right, while requiring Special Use approval\nin B and most C districts, not only to promote the general\npublic welfare and to protect the character, stability, order,\nand efficient development of Chicago’s varied areas, but\n\fNo. 01-4030                                                 23\n\nalso to prevent overcrowding, to limit street congestion, and\nto conserve the taxable value of city land. 17 MUN. CODE\nCHI. § 2. Moreover, the CZO makes available avenues by\nwhich exceptions for nonconforming uses may be sought\n(and has made such exceptions in the cases of two plaintiff\nchurches who applied for Special Use approval). Though the\nend result of this zoning scheme may be to afford churches\nbetter opportunities for location in R districts than B, C, or\nM districts, under the amended CZO churches still fare\nbetter than many other nonreligious assembly uses that are\ntreated equally in B, C, and M districts but excluded from\nR districts. To the extent that the CZO treats churches any\ndifferently from nonreligious assembly uses, it does not\ndisfavor churches. More importantly, any such difference is\nrationally related to Chicago’s legitimate interest in\nregulating land use within its city limits. The CZO thus\ncomplies with the requirements of the Equal Protection\nClause.\n  Finally, Appellants challenge the district court’s analysis\nof their Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process\nclaim.9 Specifically, Appellants suggest that the district\ncourt’s characterization of their claim against the Special\nUse approval procedures as one involving property rights,\nrather than any particular use or fundamental activity, is\nat odds with an earlier district court finding that Appel-\nlants’ due process claim “asserted a fundamental liberty\ninterest in their free exercise of religion, freedom of speech,\nand freedom of assembly.” See Civil Liberties for Urban\nBelievers v. Chicago, No. 94 C 6151 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 28, 1997)\n(memorandum opinion and order denying Chicago’s motion\nto dismiss multiple claims). Appellants disregard the fact\nthat this language comes from an order denying Chicago’s\n\n\n9\n  “No State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or\nproperty, without due process of law. . . .” U.S. CONST. amend.\nXIV, § 1.\n\f24                                                  No. 01-4030\n\nmotion to dismiss Appellants’ due process claims pursuant\nto Rule 12(b)(6) of the FRCP. At the summary judgment\nstage, the district court’s finding that a claim is properly\nstated for Rule 12(b)(6) purposes has no effect on its\ndetermination of the merits of that claim. Viewing the facts\nin a light most favorable to Appellants, the district court\nproperly determined that, because Appellants challenged\nthe alleged vagueness of the zoning procedures and stan-\ndards in a manner that any property owner might so do\nirrespective of a particular property use or fundamental\nliberty, the claim focused on property rights rather than\nAppellants’ right to worship. The district court then relied\nupon River Park v. City of Highland Park, 23 F.3d 164 (7th\nCir. 1994), to determine that any facial due process attack\non the CZO must be made in state court. As we stated in\nthat case, in which a plaintiff corporation alleged that\nHighland Park’s politically motivated refusal to act on its\nzoning application bankrupted the corporation and deprived\nit of procedural due process,\n     Federal courts are not boards of zoning appeals [and]\n     the procedures “due” in zoning cases are minimal.\n     Cities may elect to make zoning decisions through the\n     political process. . . . Highland Park made a political\n     decision in a political fashion, employing procedural\n     maneuvers that prevented the question from reaching\n     the floor for a vote. . . . [Plaintiff] may not have received\n     the process Illinois directs its municipalities to provide,\n     but the Constitution does not require state and local\n     governments to adhere to their procedural promises.\n     Failure to implement state law violates that state law,\n     not the Constitution; the remedy lies in state court.\nRiver Park, 23 F.3d at 165-67 (citations omitted). Here, too,\nthe CZO and its special approval procedures provide\nAppellants with all the legislative process that is due.\nMoreover, as the district court noted, the CZO expressly\nprovides for the review of zoning decisions by the Illinois\n\fNo. 01-4030                                                 25\n\nCircuit Courts. See 17 MUN. CODE CHI. § 11.3-4; 65 I.L.C.S.\n§ 5/11-13; 735 I.L.C.S. 5/3-104. As such, Appellants cannot\nprevail on their due process claim.\n\n\n                      CONCLUSION\n  Drawing all factual inferences in Appellants’ favor, we\nnonetheless conclude that their statutory and constitutional\nclaims challenging the Chicago Zoning Ordinance are\nwithout merit. We therefore AFFIRM the district court’s\norder granting the City of Chicago’s motion for summary\njudgment.\n\n\n\n\n  POSNER, Circuit Judge, dissenting. This is a difficult\ncase, but I have come to the conclusion that the restrictions\nthat Chicago’s zoning ordinance places on churches (a term\nthat I use broadly to include any religion’s place of worship)\nviolate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. I do not address the other grounds on which\nthe plaintiffs attack the restrictions. The discussion of those\ngrounds occupies most of the majority opinion, which\ndevotes little space to what seems to me to be the strongest\nground of the appeal.\n  The ordinance creates three zones so far as relates to the\nequal protection issue. (I am using the term “zones” func-\ntionally rather than to designate categories in the zoning\nordinance, which, as is apparent from the majority opinion,\nis extremely complicated.) The first “zone” is residential.\nChurches can locate there without having to obtain a\npermit from the zoning board, as can a number of other\nnonresidential entities, such as clubs, restaurants, schools,\n\f26                                               No. 01-4030\n\nlibraries, and drugstores, though restaurants and drug-\nstores only in high-rise apartment buildings. Other nonresi-\ndential land uses in the residential zone, however, either\nrequire a permit or are banned outright. The second zone,\nwhich I shall call “commercial,” is for business and other\ncommercial uses, including not only office buildings and\nretail stores but also wholesale outlets, warehouses, and\nlight manufacturing, but excluding certain transportation\nfacilities and heavy manufacturing. In the commercial zone,\nchurches require a permit. Last is a zone reserved for\ntransportation facilities and heavy manufacturing, which\nI shall call the “manufacturing” zone. In it churches are\nflatly forbidden, although bars, restaurants, and union\nlodges are freely permitted.\n  The question is whether the City’s restrictions on where\nchurches may locate are rational. But “rationality” in the\nlaw of equal protection is not in fact a single standard,\nthough the courts have been coy about admitting this. City\nof Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U.S. 432\n(1985), like this a zoning case, and decisions following it\nsuch as Congregation Kol Ami v. Abington Township, 309\nF.3d 120, 133-44 (3d Cir. 2002), and Cornerstone Bible\nChurch v. City of Hastings, 948 F.2d 464, 471-72 (8th Cir.\n1991), identify a category of sensitive uses or activities,\nwhere judges are to be more alert for unjustifiable discrimi-\nnation than in the usual case in which government regula-\ntions are challenged on equal protection grounds. See\nLawrence v. Texas, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 2484-85 (2003)\n(O’Connor, J., concurring); cf. Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202,\n224-30 (1982). It is true that Cleburne refused to deem\nmental retardation a “quasi-suspect classification” warrant-\ning a standard of review more searching than that of\nrationality, see City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center,\nInc., supra, 473 U.S. at 442-46, and on this basis the City of\nChicago in our case cites the decision in support of its\nposition. But one has only to read a little further in the\nCleburne opinion to realize that the Court was not treating\n\fNo. 01-4030                                                27\n\nthe zoning discrimination at issue there as it would have\ntreated a discrimination in the taxation of railroads or the\nzoning of bowling alleys. Compare Fitzgerald v. Racing\nAss’n of Central Iowa, 123 S. Ct. 2156, 2159-61 (2003).\nThe ordinance challenged in Cleburne required a permit\n(which was denied) for a home for mentally retarded people\nin a zone in which hospitals and nursing homes, along with\nprivate houses and a variety of other residential facilities,\nwere allowed without permit. The mentally retarded arouse\ndistaste and even fear among many people, but the Court\nsaid that “mere negative attitudes, or fear, unsubstantiated\nby factors which are properly cognizable in a zoning\nproceeding, are not permissible bases for treating a home\nfor the mentally retarded differently from apartment\nhouses, multiple dwellings, and the like.” City of Cleburne\nv. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., supra, 473 U.S. at 448. The\nCourt went through the other justifications that Cleburne\nhad offered for the discrimination, found them wanting, and\ninvalidated the ordinance.\n  The majority opinion in Cleburne is deficient in candor.\nCf. Dennis J. Hutchinson, “More Substantive Equal Protec-\ntion? A Note on Plyler v. Doe,” 1982 Supreme Court Review\n167, 168, 179, 194. As a separate opinion joined by three of\nthe Justices pointed out, “The Court holds the ordinance\ninvalid on rational-basis grounds and disclaims that\nanything special, in the form of heightened scrutiny, is\ntaking place. Yet Cleburne’s ordinance surely would be\nvalid under the traditional rational-basis test applicable to\neconomic and commercial regulation. In my view, it is\nimportant to articulate, as the Court does not, the facts and\nprinciples that justify subjecting this zoning ordinance to\nthe searching review—the heightened scrutiny—that\nactually leads to its invalidation. . . . [T]he Court does not\nlabel its handiwork heightened scrutiny, and perhaps the\nmethod employed must hereafter be called ‘second order’\nrational-basis review rather than ‘heightened scrutiny.’ But\nhowever labeled, the rational-basis test invoked today is\n\f28                                                No. 01-4030\n\nmost assuredly not the rational-basis test of Williamson v.\nLee Optical of Oklahoma, Inc., 348 U.S. 483 (1955), Allied\nStores of Ohio, Inc. v. Bowers, 358 U.S. 522 (1959), and\ntheir progeny.” City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center,\nInc., supra, 473 U.S. at 456, 458.\n  We should follow what the Supreme Court does and not\njust what it says it is doing. The Court rejects a “sliding\nscale” approach to equal protection in words but occasion-\nally accepts it in deeds. Cleburne instantiates though it does\nnot articulate the proposition that discrimination against\nsensitive uses is to be given more careful, realistic, skeptical\nscrutiny by the courts than discrimination against purely\ncommercial activities. Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 634-35\n(1996); cf. Lawrence v. Texas, supra, 123 S. Ct. at 2482. And\nwhile it is true that the Court has rejected the proposition\nthat “Cleburne stands for the broad proposition that state\ndecisionmaking reflecting ‘negative attitudes’ or ‘fear’\nnecessarily runs afoul of the Fourteenth Amendment,”\nadding that “although such biases may often accompany\nirrational (and therefore unconstitutional) discrimination,\ntheir presence alone does not a constitutional violation\nmake,” University of Alabama v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 367\n(2001), we should give due weight to “necessarily” and\n“alone.” Previous decisions of this court and other courts of\nappeals have recognized that the Cleburne line of cases\nexpands the boundaries of “rationality” review. See Milner\nv. Apfel, 148 F.3d 812, 816-17 (7th Cir. 1998); Pontarelli\nLimousine, Inc. v. City of Chicago, 929 F.2d 339, 341-42 (7th\nCir. 1991); Ramos v. Town of Vernon, 331 F.3d 315, 320 (2d\nCir. 2003); Able v. United States, 155 F.3d 628, 634 (2d Cir.\n1998).\n  Churches are no less sensitive a land use than homes for\nthe mentally retarded, as both Congregation Kol Ami v.\nAbington Township, supra, and Cornerstone Bible Church\nv. City of Hastings, supra, recognize, though the reason is\ndifferent. The mentally retarded are victims of irrational\n\fNo. 01-4030                                                29\n\nfears and cruel scorn; they are shunned. Religious people\nare not shunned, but religion arouses strong emotions,\nsectarian rivalry is intense and often bitter, and the mixing\nof religion and government is explosive. When government\nsingles out churches for special regulation, as it does in the\nChicago ordinance, the risk of discrimination, not against\nreligion as such—Chicago is not dominated by atheists—but\nagainst particular sects, is great enough to require more\ncareful judicial scrutiny than in the ordinary equal protec-\ntion challenge to zoning.\n  Chicago’s ordinance discriminates in favor of well-\nestablished sects. Not only did they acquire the land on\nwhich their churches are built in residential areas when\nsuch land was relatively cheap and abundant, and there-\nfore affordable by noncommercial entities, such as\nchurches (and there are of course some wealthy churches);\nin addition, because nonconforming uses are grandfathered,\nthe churches that have managed to get permission to\nbuild over the years in nonresidential zones are untouch-\nable. But what of new, small, or impecunious churches,\nsuch as the 40 to 50 obscure sects, one of which has only\n15 members, that compose the principal plaintiff, Civil\nLiberties for Urban Believers? And obscure they are. It\nis telling that of the six other named plaintiffs—Christ\nCenter (150 members), Christian Covenant Outreach\nChurch (ministering to teenagers and former gang mem-\nbers), His Word Ministries to All Nations, Christian Bible\nCenter (35 members), Church on the “Way” Praise Center,\nand Monte de Sino Church, only one (Christian Bible\nCenter) is on the city’s list of area churches. See\nhttp://www.thecityofchicago.org/church/.\n  As David Hume would have predicted, the greater vitality\nof American religion than of religion in countries in which\nthere is an established church or churches owes much to\nour unwillingness to allow government to favor particular\nsects. Laurence R. Iannaccone, Roger Finke & Rodney\n\f30                                               No. 01-4030\n\nStark, “Deregulating Religion: The Economics of Church\nand State,” 35 Econ. Inquiry 350 (1997); Iannaccone, “The\nConsequences of Religious Market Regulation: Adam\nSmith and the Economics of Religion,” 3 Rationality &\nSoc’y 156 (1991). By impairing religious competition, such\nfavoritism turns many people—those not comfortable\nwith the creed or clergy or congregants of the favored\nchurch—off religion.\n  Religious competition presupposes free entry into the\nreligious “marketplace.” A new church is unlikely, however,\nto have the resources necessary for building its place of\nworship in a residential area other than a slum, especially\nas the Chicago ordinance requires that the church provide\nparking, which will mean that unless its building is tiny it\nwill have to acquire more than one city lot. A church that\nwants to build in the commercial zone, where land is\ncheaper, must obtain a special permit; and if it wants to\nbuild in the manufacturing zone, it is out of luck unless it\ncan procure an amendment to the zoning ordinance. At\nissue in Congregation Kol Ami v. Abington Township was a\nzoning ordinance that excluded churches from residential\nareas; this is some evidence that the City is wrong to\nsuppose that it is any longer the case that churches fit\nbetter into residential than nonresidential areas. The\nphenomenon of the “storefront church”—an apt description\nof the churches in this case—reflects both the inability of a\nnew, small church to afford to build in a residential area\nand the fact that a new church needs to advertise its\npresence, which it can do at little cost just by being located\nin a commercial area, where there are more passersby than\nin a residential area.\n       Small storefront or house churches can be found in\n     many places in the city. A recent article by George\n     Gallup reports that 40% of all American adults meet in\n     small religious groups. Not surprisingly, a large num-\n     ber of these groups are in fact storefront or house\n\fNo. 01-4030                                                31\n\n    churches which revolve around Bible study, prayer, and\n    Sunday school.\n      This is not happening in just a Christian context.\n    Within the New Age movement, Muslim, Hindu, and\n    even Jewish traditions, small groups are gathering in\n    storefront meeting houses. These storefront worship\n    spaces will continue to grow for many reasons, but the\n    one that will affect them even more than group dynam-\n    ics is city planning. As tighter zoning laws are pass[ed]\n    in Boston and real estate prices continue to sky-rocket,\n    the only place for churches to turn to are existing\n    commercial spaces.\nRobert L. Lewis, Jr., “Ministry Research Project: Storefront\nChurches of Boston; A Photographic Study of Selected\nStorefront and Home Churches in the City of Boston,”\nhttp://www.bu.edu/ccrd/research/completed/storefront. html.\nThe article is about Boston but the analysis in it is equal-\nly applicable to Chicago.\n  Granted, Chicago’s prohibition against locating a church\nin the commercial zone is not absolute. A permit can be\nsought. But obtaining one is costly for a marginal enter-\nprise; the zoning board enjoys broad discretion in deciding\nwhether to grant or deny a permit; and a public hearing is\nrequired at which opposition to the church’s application for\na permit is predictable because churches do not enhance\ncommercial activity (see Lucinda Harper, “Storefront\nChurches: The Neighbors Upscale Stores Don’t Love,” Wall\nSt. J., Mar. 15, 2000, at B1)—this is one of the reasons the\nCity offers in defense of the ordinance. It is a bad reason,\nbut it is the kind of reason likely to impress the zoning\nauthorities.\n  It is a bad reason because while it is true that a church is\nless likely to enhance a commercial area than a\nBloomingdale’s or a Four Seasons is, there are very few\nblocks in Chicago that are purely commercial. A combina-\ntion of grandfathering, the grant of special permits, and\n\f32                                              No. 01-4030\n\nchanges in zoning law has produced a crazy quilt of\nland uses. On Michigan Avenue near our courthouse—\nan area zoned commercial as I have been using the\nterm—retail stores, restaurants, hotels, colleges, office\nbuildings, and clubs jostle cheek by jowl. If one of the\nclubs or colleges were replaced by a church, the commer-\ncial life of Michigan Avenue would not be affected, although\nthe “tone” of the avenue might be lowered by a store-\nfront church. (As a matter of fact, there is a church on\nMichigan Avenue—the Fourth Presbyterian Church. See\nhttp://www.fourthchurch.org/.) For remember those “nega-\ntive attitudes” of which the Court spoke in Cleburne? Not\nonly are mainline churches apt to be hostile to upstarts\nsuch as the members of Civil Liberties for Urban Believers,\nand particularly to storefront churches, but even people who\nare not caught up in sectarian rivalries might consider the\npresence of a church rather a downer in a “fast” district,\nsuch as Old Town. Indeed, a permit for one of CLUB’s\nmembers was denied because it was thought that the\npresence of a church would impede the transformation of\nthe area into a “nightclub district.”\n  The City’s brief offers the further, but absurdly paternal-\nistic, argument that it is bad for the churches themselves to\nbe located in commercial or industrial areas, because of\nnoise and commotion. Obviously that is a judgment for the\nchurch to make rather than government, by trading off the\ncost to the church of noisy and profane surroundings\nagainst the benefits in lower costs of land acquisition and\nproximity to sinners, including prostitutes, drug addicts,\nand gang members, whose souls are particularly in need of\nsaving. At oral argument the City’s lawyer pressed another\npoint, that the mysterious exclusion of churches from the\nmanufacturing zone is justified by the fact that if they\nclustered there they might try to expel the factories by\nbringing a nuisance suit. Because Illinois rejects the\ndoctrine of “coming to the nuisance,” City of Pana v. Central\nWashed Coal Co., 102 N.E. 992, 998 (Ill. 1913); Oehler v.\n\fNo. 01-4030                                                 33\n\nLevy, 85 N.E. 271, 273-74 (Ill. 1908); see also Wheat v.\nFreeman Coal Mining Corp., 319 N.E.2d 290, 294 (Ill. App.\n1974), it is not a defense to a nuisance suit that the nui-\nsance was there before the plaintiff. The lawyer’s vision of\nchurches concentrating in the manufacturing zone and then\nbringing a nuisance suit to transform it into—what, a\nreligious zone?—is fanciful. But even if it were realistic, the\nCity, which is a part of Illinois state government from the\nstandpoint of the application of the equal protection clause,\ncannot defend discrimination by arguing that it is coerced\nby state law. Otherwise a state could pass a law requiring\nthe police to beat anyone they arrested, and police sued for\nviolating the Fourth Amendment for using excessive force\nin effecting seizures of the person would have a defense,\nwhich no one believes. The state can untie the City’s hands\nby authorizing a “coming to the nuisance” defense, either\ngenerally or just for the benefit of manufacturers whose\nfactories are in cities. Anyway a nuisance suit would not\nsucceed unless the plaintiff could show a net increase in\nland values from abating the nuisance; and if so this would\nimply that the City was better off for the suit.\n  The City’s final argument is that the zoning ordinance\nrepresents a “global bargain” whereby churches get pre-\nferred treatment in the residential zone and secular uses\nget preferred treatment in the commercial zone. If one\nassumes, as I would, that the exclusion of commercial uses\nfrom the residential zone is rational (deny that, and one\ncondemns virtually all zoning as irrational), the exclusion\nof churches from the commercial zone would be rational if\ntheir presence would crowd out commercial users. But that\nis an absurd suggestion. A slightly more realistic worry\nwould be that if churches are allowed to bid for land zoned\ncommercial, the price of such land will rise, to the detri-\nment of commercial users of it, because the amount of land\nis fixed and the demand would have increased. But the\naggregate demand of churches for land zoned commercial is\n\f34                                               No. 01-4030\n\ntoo slight in relation to the amount of that land for allowing\nthem to bid on it to affect the price noticeably.\n   Thus far I have been discussing the ordinance as it was\namended in 2000 in virtual acknowledgment that its\npredecessor was in violation of the Constitution. For the\npredecessor ordinance allowed fraternal lodges and other\nclubs, community centers, and other meeting places to\nlocate in the commercial zone without obtaining a permit.\n(The amendment eliminated this privilege, though colleges,\nunion lodges, libraries, and funeral homes, along with the\nconventional business and commercial establishments,\nretain it.) The only difference between them and churches\nis that they are secular. There is no difference so far as the\nuse of land is concerned. The “global bargain” defense is\nparticularly questionable as applied to the old ordinance. A\nchurch is no more or less suitable for the residential zone\nthan a fraternal lodge and a fraternal lodge no more or less\nsuitable for the commercial zone than a church. The old\nordinance discriminated arbitrarily in favor of churches in\nthe residential zone and against them in the commercial\nzone, thus distorting religious competition in favor of\nexisting and against new churches. The new ordinance\nretains one completely unreasonable distinction, that\nbetween union lodges and churches, putting one in mind of\nthe Spanish Civil War, a struggle between syndicalism and\nclericalism. The distinction between churches on the one\nhand and libraries and colleges on the other hand, another\ndistinction retained by the amended ordinance, is only a\nlittle more rational.\n   The plaintiffs filed their suit almost a decade ago, before\nthe ordinance was amended. The amendment did not moot\ntheir challenge to the old ordinance because they seek\ndamages for the delay they encountered in obtaining\npermission to build in desirable locations. If as I contend\nthe requirement of a permit was unconstitutional because\nit discriminated in favor of fraternal lodges, then the delay\n\fNo. 01-4030                                               35\n\nthe plaintiffs encountered in finding suitable quarters was\nthe consequence of a constitutional violation and the\nplaintiffs are entitled to damages. As an example of the\nrunarounds that the plaintiffs experienced in obtaining a\nspecial permit in the commercial zone, consider the hegira\nof the Christian Bible Church. From small beginnings (like\nChristianity itself), meeting in a private home, the congre-\ngation in 1988 began meeting in a funeral parlor, hardly an\nauspicious site. In 1990 it found a suitable building in the\ncommercial zone, but did not apply for a permit after being\ntold that the alderman for the ward in which the building\nwas located would not allow a church at that location. The\nfollowing year Christian Bible bought a building in another\npart of the commercial zone, applied for a permit, and was\nturned down. After trying without success to sell the\nbuilding, the church renovated it, and while the building\nwas closed for renovations the congregation met in rented\nquarters or private homes. The renovations completed,\nChristian Bible applied for and this time received a permit\nto use the building as its church. By now it was 1993; it had\ntaken three years to find suitable space. As Christian Bible\nhas only 35 members, the burden that the ordinance\nimposed on it was formidable.\n  Chicago’s zoning ordinance imposes the same severe\nburden on new churches that the ordinance invalidated in\nthe Cleburne case imposed on homes for the mentally\nretarded, and with no greater justification. In doing so it\ndenied the plaintiffs the equal protection of the laws.\n\nA true Copy:\n      Teste:\n                        ________________________________\n                        Clerk of the United States Court of\n                           Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\n                   USCA-02-C-0072—8-20-03\n\f",

Appellants, an association of\nChicago-area churches and five individual member churches\nthereof, appeal from the district court’s entry of summary\njudgment in favor of Appellee, the City of Chicago, on Ap-\npellants’ claims challenging the Chicago Zoning Ordinance\n(“CZO”), 17 MUNICIPAL CODE OF CHICAGO, ILL., §§ 1-11,\nunder the federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized\nPersons Act (“RLUIPA”), 42 UNITED STATES CODE § 2000cc\net seq., and the United States Constitution. For the reasons\nset forth below, we affirm the decision of the district court.\n\f2                                                No. 01-4030\n\n                     BACKGROUND\n  The CZO broadly divides the city into R, B, C, and M\nzones for residential, business, commercial, and manufac-\nturing uses, respectively. Each zone, in turn, is subdivided\ninto numbered districts and subdistricts. A majority of\nChicago land available for development is zoned R. The\nCZO’s stated purposes include the following: (i) “to promote\nand to protect the public health, safety, morals, comfort,\nconvenience, and the general welfare of the people,” and (ii)\n“to protect the character and maintain the stability for\nresidential, business, commercial, and manufacturing areas\nwithin the City, and to promote the orderly and beneficial\ndevelopment of such areas.” See 17 MUN. CODE CHI. § 2\n(1), (3) (2001). Churches are permitted uses as of right in all\nR zones, but are termed Variations in the Nature of Special\nUses (“Special Use”) in all B zones as well as C1, C2, C3,\nand C5 districts. All Special Uses, whether of a religious or\nnonreligious nature, require approval by the Zoning Board\nof Appeals (“ZBA”) following a public hearing. See id. §§ 7.3-\n1(4), 8.4, 9.4, & 11.10. Special Use approval is expressly\nconditioned upon the design, location, and operation of the\nproposed use consistent with the protection of public health,\nsafety, and welfare, and the proposed use must not substan-\ntially injure the value of neighboring property. See id.\n§ 11.10-4. Factoring such expenses as application, title\nsearch, and legal fees, as well as appraisal and neighbor\nnotification costs, the aggregate cost of obtaining Special\nUse approval approaches $5000. Before a church may locate\nin a C4 district or an M zone, the Chicago City Council\nmust vote in favor of a Map Amendment, effectively\nrezoning the targeted parcel. See id. §§ 9.4-4, 10, & 11.9.\nDevelopment for church use of land consisting of two or\nmore acres (necessary for congregations exceeding roughly\n500 members) requires approval by City Council vote of a\nPlanned Development. See id. § 11.11-1(a) & 11.11-3.\n\fNo. 01-4030                                                      3\n\n  Civil Liberties for Urban Believers (“CLUB”) is an\nunincorporated association of 40 to 50 Chicago-area reli-\ngious or not-for-profit Illinois corporations ranging in size\nfrom 15 to 15,000 congregants. Five of these individual\nmember churches1 joined CLUB as plaintiffs in an action\nchallenging the validity of the CZO. The district court\nsummarized as follows the encounters of the five individual\nplaintiff churches with Chicago’s zoning framework as\nalleged in Appellants’ complaint:\n    Christ Center began meeting in a high school audito-\n    rium in 1990, but soon experienced difficulties at this\n    location due to various school functions that interrupted\n    weekly worship. As a result, Christ Center began\n    searching for a building to purchase. The church was\n    unsuccessful in locating an appropriate building in any\n    R districts. In the summer of 1992, Christ Center\n    located a suitable building at 1139-43 West Madison in\n    Chicago. The building was located in a C district and\n    Christ Center promptly applied for a special use permit.\n    After completing the application process, Christ Center\n    reached out to gain the support of neighbors and\n    Alderman Theodore Mazola. Most neighbors favored a\n    taxpaying entity in the neighborhood rather than a\n    church and Alderman Mazola stated that he would\n    support the church’s special use permit on any street\n    but Madison. The Zoning Board eventually convened a\n    special hearing on September 18, 1992. On October 18,\n    1992, the special use permit was denied. Christ Center\n    subsequently found a second building in an M district\n    at 123 South Morgan. The owner of the building also\n    agreed to provide financing. However, the Chicago\n\n\n1\n  Those five Churches are (i) Christ Center; (ii) Christian\nCovenant Outreach Church (“Christian Covenant”); (iii) His Word\nMinistries to All Nations (“His Word”); (iv) Christian Bible Church\n(“Christian Bible”); and (v) Monte de Sion Church (“Mount Zion”).\n\f4                                              No. 01-4030\n\n    Department of Planning and Development informed\n    Christ Center that it would oppose any rezoning appli-\n    cation because the particular area was designated to\n    become an entertainment area and the presence of a\n    church would inhibit such development. Christ Center\n    subsequently choose not to file an application for\n    rezoning. In the fall of 1993, Christ Center obtained\n    property at 4445 South King Drive, successfully ob-\n    tained a special use permit and now operates a church\n    at this location. Christ Center now claims that it paid\n    substantial sums in attorneys fees, appraisal fees,\n    zoning application charges, title charges and other\n    expenses attempting to find suitable property.\n    Between 1986 and the summer of 1988, Christian Bible\n    met in a private home. The church eventually outgrew\n    this space and began meeting in a funeral home. The\n    funeral home, however, proved aesthetically and\n    administratively problematic. In 1990, Christian Bible\n    located a suitable building in a B district at 83rd and\n    Essex. Alderman Beavers promptly informed Christian\n    Bible that “he would not allow” a church at that loca-\n    tion. Consequently, Christian Bible did not apply for a\n    special use permit at this location. In March 1991,\n    Christian Bible purchased property in another B\n    district at 513-23 East 75th Street. The Park Manor\n    Neighbors Association and Alderman Steele both\n    opposed the church’s special use permit application. On\n    May 17, 1991, the permit was denied. Christian Bible\n    then unsuccessfully attempted to sell the building for\n    10 months. In February 1992, Christian Bible reno-\n    vated the building to enhance its appearance. During\n    these renovations, the church rented space at another\n    location, or held meetings at private homes. Christian\n    Bible later reapplied for a special use permit which was\n    granted on August 20, 1993 with the support of neigh-\n    bors in the district. Christian Bible now claims the\n\fNo. 01-4030                                              5\n\n   delay in obtaining a special use permit prevented the\n   church from obtaining a real estate tax exemption. The\n   church further alleges that it also paid substantial\n   sums in expenses related to the application process and\n   also suffered a decrease in membership. Christian Bible\n   now owns and meets at a church at 6210 S. St. Louis\n   and has successfully obtained a special use permit to\n   operate the church.\n   From February, 1988 to December, 1993, Mount Zion\n   rented space in a C district at 4545 North Kedzie.\n   During this period, Mount Zion never applied for a\n   special use permit. In 1990, a [Chicago] inspector\n   ordered Mount Zion to vacate the building. In April\n   1993, Mount Zion located suitable rental property at\n   3949 North Pulaski, and applied for a special use\n   permit. During this process, the Zoning Board informed\n   Mount Zion that the building lacked adequate parking\n   accommodations for a church and both the building and\n   each parking lot would require special use permits.\n   Alderman Wojcik and a neighborhood group also\n   opposed Mount Zion’s application. Consequently, Mount\n   Zion withdrew its application for a special use permit.\n   Mount Zion now owns and meets in a church at 3807 N.\n   Lavergne.\n   On November 1, 1992, Christian Covenant first rented\n   property in a C district. The owner of the building\n   offered to co-sign a loan enabling Christian Covenant to\n   purchase the property. However, [Chicago] inspectors\n   ordered Christian Covenant to stop using the building\n   as a church without a special use permit. As a result,\n   Christian Covenant did not purchase the building out\n   of fear [Chicago] would not allow the building to be\n   used as a church without a special use permit. Chris-\n   tian Covenant now owns and meets in a church located\n   in an R district.\n\f6                                               No. 01-4030\n\n    Between 1990 and 1992, His Word met in the basement\n    of a private home until membership outgrew these\n    accommodations. In 1992, His Word located a suitable\n    building in a C district at 1616 West Pershing. On\n    March 27, 1992, the church signed a purchase contract\n    contingent upon the grant of a special use permit. After\n    filing their special use permit application, His Word\n    met with neighbors in the district who generally\n    supported it. Alderman Patrick Huels stated he would\n    neither support nor oppose the application. On three\n    separate occasions, at the request of Alderman Huels,\n    the [ZBA] postponed a hearing on His Word’s applica-\n    tion. On October 14, 1992, Alderman Huels introduced\n    an amendment to the [CZO] to rezone the property\n    located at 1616 West Pershing from a C district to an M\n    district. After a hearing on December 10, 1992, Alder-\n    man William Banks and other aldermen on the Chicago\n    Committee on Zoning of the Chicago City Council voted\n    to recommend approval of the amendment. Both His\n    Word and Citibank, the owner of the building, opposed\n    the rezoning. On December 15, 1992, the Chicago City\n    Council voted to enact the rezoning amendment chang-\n    ing 1616 West Pershing from a C district to an M\n    district. His Word subsequently withdrew its applica-\n    tion for a special use permit; the church spent a consid-\n    erable sum on filing, attorney’s and appraiser’s fees.\n    His Word now owns and meets in a church located in an\n    R district.\nCivil Liberties for Urban Believers v.

The district\ncourt also rejected Appellants’ due process claims, noting\nthat City Council and ZBA legislative procedures and\npractices afforded Appellants what minimal process is due\nin zoning cases.

Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act\n  Appellants argue that the CZO violates RLUIPA’s\nsubstantial burden provision, which requires land-use\nregulations that substantially burden religious exercise to\nbe the least restrictive means of advancing a compelling\ngovernment interest, see 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc(a), as well as its\nnondiscrimination provision, which prohibits land-use\nregulations that either disfavor religious uses relative to\nnonreligious uses or unreasonably exclude religious uses\nfrom a particular jurisdiction, see 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc(b).5\n\n\n5\n    In relevant part, those provisions read as follows:\n    § 2000cc. Protection of land use as religious exercise.\n      (a) Substantial burdens.\n        (1) General rule. No government shall impose or imple-\n        ment a land use regulation in a manner that imposes a\n        substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person,\n        including a religious assembly or institution, unless the\n        government demonstrates that imposition of the burden\n        on that person, assembly, or institution—\n          (A) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental\n          interest; and\n          (B) is the least restrictive means of furthering that\n          compelling governmental interest.\n                                                    (continued...)\n\fNo. 01-4030                                                          11\n\n  In order to prevail on a claim under the substantial\nburden provision, a plaintiff must first demonstrate that\nthe regulation at issue actually imposes a substantial\nburden on religious exercise. RLUIPA defines “religious\nexercise” to encompass “any exercise of religion, whether or\nnot compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief,”\nincluding “[t]he use, building, or conversion of real property\nfor the purpose of religious exercise.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-\n5(7). This definition reveals Congress’s intent to expand the\nconcept of religious exercise contemplated both in decisions\n\n\n5\n    (...continued)\n          (2) Scope of application. This subsection applies in any\n          case in which. . .\n          (C) the substantial burden is imposed in the implemen-\n          tation of a land use regulation or system of land use\n          regulations, under which a government makes, or has\n          in place formal or informal procedures or practices that\n          permit the government to make, individualized assess-\n          ments of the proposed uses for the property involved.\n      (b) Discrimination and exclusion.\n        (1) Equal terms.

Although the text of the statute\ncontains no similar express definition of the term “substan-\ntial burden,” RLUIPA’s legislative history indicates that it\nis to be interpreted by reference to RFRA and First Amend-\nment jurisprudence. See 146 CONG. REC. 7774-01, 7776\n(“The term ‘substantial burden’ as used in this Act is not\nintended to be given any broader interpretation than the\nSupreme Court’s articulation of the concept of substantial\nburden or religious exercise”). Chicago cites a decision of\nthis Court which held that, within the meaning of RFRA, a\nsubstantial burden on religious exercise “is one that forces\nadherents of a religion to refrain from religiously motivated\nconduct, inhibits or constrains conduct or expression that\nmanifests a central tenet of a person’s religious beliefs, or\ncompels conduct or expression that is contrary to those\nbeliefs.” Mack v. O’Leary, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1175</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1179 (7th Cir. 1996)\n(vacated on other grounds). Substituting RLUIPA’s broader\ndefinition of religious exercise, which need not be “com-\npelled by or central to” a particular religion, for that\narticulated in Mack, the meaning of “substantial burden on\nreligious exercise” could be read to include the effect of any\nregulation that “inhibits or constrains the use, building, or\nconversion of real property for the purpose of religious\nexercise.” Such a construction might lend support to Appel-\nlants’ contention that the CZO, insofar as it contributes to\nother existing constraints upon the use of specific parcels as\n\fNo. 01-4030                                                13\n\nchurches, substantially burdens religious exercise. How-\never, this cannot be the correct construction of “substantial\nburden on religious exercise” under RLUIPA. Application of\nthe substantial burden provision to a regulation inhibiting\nor constraining any religious exercise, including the use of\nproperty for religious purposes, would render meaningless\nthe word “substantial,” because the slightest obstacle to\nreligious exercise incidental to the regulation of land\nuse—however minor the burden it were to impose—could\nthen constitute a burden sufficient to trigger RLUIPA’s\nrequirement that the regulation advance a compelling\ngovernmental interest by the least restrictive means. We\ntherefore hold that, in the context of RLUIPA’s broad\ndefinition of religious exercise, a land-use regulation that\nimposes a substantial burden on religious exercise is one\nthat necessarily bears direct, primary, and fundamental\nresponsibility for rendering religious exercise—including\nthe use of real property for the purpose thereof within the\nregulated jurisdiction generally—effectively impracticable.\n  Appellants contend that the scarcity of affordable land\navailable for development in R zones, along with the costs,\nprocedural requirements, and inherent political aspects of\nthe Special Use, Map Amendment, and Planned Develop-\nment approval processes, impose precisely such a substan-\ntial burden. However, we find that these conditions—which\nare incidental to any high-density urban land use—do not\namount to a substantial burden on religious exercise. While\nthey may contribute to the ordinary difficulties associated\nwith location (by any person or entity, religious or nonreli-\ngious) in a large city, they do not render impracticable the\nuse of real property in Chicago for religious exercise, much\nless discourage churches from locating or attempting to\nlocate in Chicago. See, e.g., Love Church v. City of Evanston,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"537040\"><a href=\"/opinion/537040/love-church-an-illinois-not-for-profit-corporation-cross-appellant-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1082</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1086 (7th Cir. 1990) (“Whatever specific\ndifficulties [plaintiff church] claims to have encountered,\nthey are the same ones that face all [land users].

Otherwise, compliance with\nRLUIPA would require municipal governments not merely\nto treat religious land uses on an equal footing with nonreli-\ngious land uses, but rather to favor them in the form of an\noutright exemption from land-use regulations. Unfortu-\nnately for Appellants, no such free pass for religious land\nuses masquerades among the legitimate protections\nRLUIPA affords to religious exercise.\n  Though the substantial burden and nondiscrimination\nprovisions are operatively independent of one another,\nRLUIPA’s governmental discretion provision, 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000cc-3(e), upon which the district court relied in order\nto find that the February 2000 CZO amendments corrected\nany violation of the substantial burden provision, appears\nnot to reflect this distinction. That subsection provides, in\npart, that “a government may avoid the preemptive force of\nany provision of [RLUIPA] by changing the policy or\npractice that results in a substantial burden on religious\nexercise.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-3(e) (emphasis added). Rather\nthan remove any substantial burden on religious exercise,\nhowever, the February 2000 amendments simply place\nchurches on an equal footing with nonreligious assembly\nuses, thereby correcting any potential violation of the\n\fNo. 01-4030                                                    15\n\nnondiscrimination provision. Despite subsection 2000cc-\n3(e)’s reference to removal of a “substantial burden,” we\nread it to afford a government the discretion to take\ncorrective action to eliminate a nondiscrimination provision\nviolation, whether or not it was the result of a substantial\nburden on religious exercise. Thus do we find that, under\nRLUIPA’s governmental discretion provision, the February\n2000 amendments to the CZO render RLUIPA’s nondiscrim-\nination provision inapplicable to this case.6\n  Insofar as Appellants cannot demonstrate on these facts\nthat the CZO substantially burdens religious exercise, and\nbecause the February 2000 Amendments to the CZO bring\nit into compliance with RLUIPA’s nondiscrimination\nprovision, Appellants fail to make a sufficient showing on\nessential elements of their RLUIPA claims. Chicago is\ntherefore entitled to summary judgment on those claims.\n  Having found RLUIPA inapplicable to the facts of this\ncase, we need not address the issue of RLUIPA’s constitu-\ntionality, raised by the parties as well as the United States\nof America, as Intervenor, and various Amici Curiae.\n\n\n\n6\n  Appellants also challenge the district court’s ruling that their\nclaims under the pre-2000 CZO are moot. They claim that\nchurches, like other nonreligious assembly uses, should have been\npermitted uses in all zones, in which case plaintiff churches would\nnot have been subject to Special Use approval procedures. They\nallege damages resulting from the costs associated with these\nprocedures. This argument ignores the fact that the primary effect\nof the 2000 amendments was to impose similar restrictions on\nnon-religious assembly uses, rather than to relax restrictions on\nchurches. Appellants cannot demonstrate that the amended CZO\nrecognizes any preexisting right of churches to operate in B, Z, or\nM zones. The amendments simply place restrictions on nonreli-\ngious assembly uses that are similar to or greater than those\nfacing religious uses. As such, the district court correctly con-\ncluded that Appellant’s pre-2000 CZO claims are moot.\n\f16                                               No. 01-4030\n\n  II. Constitutionality of the Chicago Zoning Ordinance\n  Under the Free Exercise Clause of First Amendment of\nthe United States Constitution, made applicable to state\nand local governments by the Fourteenth Amendment, no\nlaw may prohibit the free exercise of religion. Prior to\nRLUIPA’s enactment, two Supreme Court decisions held\nthat no Free Exercise Clause violation results where a\nburden on religious exercise is the incidental effect of a\nneutral, generally applicable, and otherwise valid regula-\ntion, in which case such regulation need not be justified by\na compelling governmental interest.

Appellants cite Smith\nand Hialeah as additional authority for application of the\ncompelling governmental interest and least restrictive\nmeans tests to the CZO, not unlike those urged under\nRLUIPA.\n  Appellants first argue that the CZO lacks facial neutrality\nbecause, like the law at issue in Hialeah, the CZO “refers to\na religious practice”—use of property as a church—“without\na secular meaning discernable from the language or con-\ntext.” 508 U.S. at 530. In that case, the City of Hialeah\nreacted to the intention of practitioners of the Santería\nreligion to establish a church within city limits by passing\nordinances banning public ritual sacrifice, a distinguishing\nelement of the Santería religious tradition. The Court\nexplained that a law is not neutral if its object “is to\ninfringe upon or restrict practices because of their religious\nmotivation,” and then found that the Hialeah ordinances’\nuse of the words “sacrifice” and “ritual”, which have “strong\nreligious connotations,” was evidence of their purposeful\ntargeting of Santería practices. Appellants assert by\nanalogy that the CZO’s explicit inclusion of “church” among\nthe various land uses it regulates indicates that it discrimi-\nnates against churches on its face. Unlike the Hialeah\n\fNo. 01-4030                                                     17\n\nordinances, however, the text of the CZO includes “church”\nas just one among many and varied religious and nonreli-\ngious regulated uses.7 More importantly, nothing in the\nrecord suggests, nor do Appellants articulate in anything\nbut conclusory terms, that the object and purpose of the\nCZO are anything other than those expressly stated\ntherein. See 17 MUN. CODE CHI. § 2.\n  In addition to their facial challenge under the Free\nExercise Clause as interpreted in Hialeah, Appellants\nallege that the CZO was not neutrally applied to His Word\nduring the course of Alderman Huels’ successful efforts to\ninitiate the rezoning of 1616 West Pershing Road.8 While\nthey concede that Alderman Huels may not be held person-\nally liable for his actions based on our decision in Biblia\nAbierta, 129 F.3d at 901-02, Appellants argue that his\nactions were legislative acts which improperly targeted His\nWord. However,\n    [m]unicipal liability attaches only where the\n    decisionmaker possesses final authority to establish\n\n\n7\n   The variety of regulated uses specifically referenced in the text\nof the CZO can be gleaned from the following non-exhaustive list\nof examples: dwellings, nurseries, rectories, parish houses, golf\ncourses, libraries, convents, monasteries, schools, parks, play-\ngrounds, day care centers, hospitals, clubs, lodges, restaurants,\nwireless communications facilities, cemeteries, parking lots,\nhotels, photography studios, pet shops, fraternity houses, muse-\nums, correctional institutions, tattoo parlors, pawn shops, taverns,\nkiddie parks, inter-track wagering facilities, earth station\nantennas, frozen food lockers, live bait stores, banks, barbershops,\nand paint pellet arenas.\n8\n  In a single sentence, Appellants also allege due process and\nequal protection violations as a result of the rezoning of 1616 West\nPershing Road. Though it is difficult even to evaluate claims\noffered in terms as conclusory as these, we find them meritless for\nthe same reasons that we are unmoved by Appellants’ Free\nExercise claims.\n\f18                                               No. 01-4030\n\n     municipal policy with respect to the action ordered. The\n     fact that a particular official—even a policymaking\n     official—has discretion in the exercise of particular\n     functions does not, without more, give rise to municipal\n     liability based on an exercise of that discretion.\nPembaur v. Cincinnati, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111615\"><a href=\"/opinion/111615/pembaur-v-cincinnati/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 481-82 (1986). Here,\nthe possibility that Alderman Huels’ motives for wanting to\nhave the property rezoned were illicit in no way demon-\nstrates that the City Council and the Mayor, who have final\nauthority under state law to enact city ordinances, see 65\nI.L.C.S. §§ 5/1-2-1(2), endorsed any such motives. Absent\nsome evidence that the policy-making body, in this case the\nCity Council, approved both the rezoning and the illicit\nmotivation therefor—and Appellants offer none—Chicago\ncannot be held liable for Alderman Huels’ actions. See, e.g.,\nCity of St. Louis v. Prapotnik, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112017\"><a href=\"/opinion/112017/st-louis-v-praprotnik/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 128-30 (1988)\n(plurality opinion); id. at 140-42 (Brennan, J., concurring in\nthe judgment).\n  Appellants also contend that the CZO is not generally\napplicable, in that the Special Use, Map Amendment, and\nPlanned Development processes create discretionary,\nindividualized exemptions to the CZO which are then\nimpermissibly withheld from churches. As support for this\nproposition, they cite the Supreme Court’s pronouncement\nthat “[i]n circumstances in which individualized exemptions\nfrom a general requirement are available, the government\n‘may not refuse to extend that system to cases of “religious\nhardship” without compelling reason.’ ” Hialeah, 508 U.S. at\n537 (quoting Smith, 494 U.S. at 844 (citation omitted)).\nEven assuming, arguendo, that the burdens incidental to\nchurches seeking Special Use, Map Amendment, or Planned\nDevelopment approval amount to “religious hardship”\nwithin the meaning of the Court’s decision in Hialeah,\nAppellants appear to confuse exemption from a particular\nzoning provision (in the form of Special Use, Map Amend-\nment, or Planned Development approval) with exemption\n\fNo. 01-4030                                               19\n\nfrom the procedural system by which such approval may be\nsought. Under the CZO, these alternate avenues of zoning\napproval are not merely available to any would-be appli-\ncant, as Hialeah requires. They are mandatory. In short, no\nperson, nor any nonconforming land use, is exempt from the\nprocedural system in place for Special Use, Map Amend-\nment, or Planned Development approval specifically, or the\nCZO generally. Furthermore, the experiences of plaintiff\nchurches Christ Center and Christian Bible, each of which\nwas initially denied—and subsequently granted—Special\nUse approval, demonstrates that Chicago has extended\nSpecial Use exemptions to churches. It is clear to this Court\nthat it is neither the policy nor the practice of Chicago to\nrefuse to extend to churches its system of individualized\nexemptions and, thus, that the CZO is a generally applica-\nble system of land-use regulation.\n  In Smith, the Supreme Court noted that, in cases impli-\ncating the Free Exercise Clause in conjunction with other\nconstitutional protections, such as freedom of speech and\nfreedom of association, the First Amendment may subject\nthe application to religiously motivated action of a neutral,\ngenerally applicable law to a heightened level of scrutiny.\nSmith, 494 U.S. at 881-82. Seizing upon this principle,\nAppellants maintain that their Free Exercise claim involves\nhybrid rights of free exercise, freedom of speech, freedom of\nassembly, and equal protection, such that Chicago must\njustify the CZO’s incidental burdens on church location with\na compelling state interest. Based on the analyses of\nAppellants’ speech, assembly, and equal protection claims\nthat follow, however, we find them individually lacking the\nmerit necessary to withstand summary judgment. We agree\nwith the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that “a\nplaintiff does not allege a hybrid rights claim entitled to\nstrict scrutiny analysis merely by combining a free exercise\nclaim with an utterly meritless claim of the violation of\nanother alleged fundamental right.” Miller v.

Appellants have\nidentified no constitutionally protected interest upon which\nthe CZO infringes, as they must in order to establish a\nhybrid rights claim requiring heightened scrutiny.\n  Of Appellants’ remaining constitutional claims, the first\nalleges that the CZO violates Appellants’ First Amendment\nrights to freedom of speech and freedom of assembly\nbecause the CZO is neither (i) content neutral nor (ii)\nnarrowly tailored to serve a legitimate governmental\nobjective and (iii) does not leave open ample channels of\nalternative communication. See Ward v. Rock Against\nRacism, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112315\"><a href=\"/opinion/112315/ward-v-rock-against-racism/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">781</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 782 (1989) (articulating these three\ncriteria for valid time, place, and manner restrictions on\nspeech and assembly). Appellants state in conclusory terms\nthat the CZO discriminates against religious uses, is\n“irrational and arbitrary,” restricts churches to R zones, and\nis not narrowly tailored. They also state that the CZO’s\nrequirement that churches occupying more than two acres\nobtain Planned Development approval creates a practical\nban on large churches. As discussed previously, the CZO is\nneutral and generally applicable and places churches on a\nfooting equal with, if not superior to, that of nonreligious\nassembly uses. Similarly, to the extent that the CZO\nincidentally regulates speech or assembly within churches,\nsuch regulation is motivated not by any disagreement that\nChicago might have with the message conveyed by church\nspeech or assembly, but rather by such legitimate, practical\nconsiderations as the promotion of harmonious and efficient\nland use. In this respect it is content neutral. In order to\nsatisfy the requirement that it is narrowly tailored, “a\nregulation need not be the least restrictive or least intrusive\nmeans.” Ward, 491 U.S. at 798. It need only further “a\nsubstantial government interest that would be achieved less\neffectively absent the regulation.” Id. at 799. There is no\n\fNo. 01-4030                                                21\n\nquestion that Chicago—like any population center—has a\nsubstantial interest in regulating the use of its land and\nthat the CZO promotes that interest. We are also unper-\nsuaded by Appellants’ implicit suggestion that the restric-\ntion of church use as of right to R zones leaves churches\nwith insufficient channels of communication. Not only may\nchurches freely disseminate religious speech in a majority\nof Chicago land zoned for development, but they may also\ndisseminate—and, in the cases of plaintiffs Christ Center\nand Christian Bible, have in fact disseminated—religious\nspeech in B and various C districts with Special Use\napproval. Similarly, the Planned Development approval\nprocess provides larger churches with ample opportunity to\nlocate within Chicago in a manner consistent with the\nCZO’s legitimate, stated purposes. For these reasons,\nAppellants’ First Amendment freedom of speech and\nfreedom of assembly claims are without merit.\n  Appellants further argue that the CZO violates the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment—which\nprovides that no state shall “deny to any person within its\njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws”—by treating\nchurches in a manner less favorable than that of nonreli-\ngious assembly uses. It is the well established law of this\nCircuit that, “[a]bsent a fundamental right or a suspect\nclass, to demonstrate a viable equal protection claim in the\nland use context, a plaintiff must demonstrate governmen-\ntal action wholly impossible to relate to legitimate govern-\nmental objectives.” Forseth v.

As a preliminary matter, we are quick to reiterate\nour earlier determination that any burdens on religious\nexercise imposed by the CZO are both incidental and\ninsubstantial. Furthermore, this court has held that the\nfundamental rights theory of heightened equal protection\nscrutiny applies only to laws that effect “grave interference\nwith important religious tenets or . . . affirmatively compel\n[congregants] to perform acts undeniably at odds with\nfundamental tenets of their religious beliefs.” Griffin High\nSchool v.

Whatever the obstacles that the CZO\nmight present to a church’s ability to locate on a specific\nplot of Chicago land, they in no way regulate the right, let\nalone interfere with the ability, of an individual to adhere\nto the central tenets of his religious beliefs. As the district\ncourt adroitly noted, the CZO’s limitations on church\nlocation are “not the regulation of belief, any more than\nregulating the location of the Chicago Tribune building is\nthe regulation of the newspaper’s [F]irst [A]mendment-\nprotected product.” Civil Liberties for Urban Believers, 157\nF.Supp.2d at 908.\n  Viewed through the lens of the Cleburne and Forseth\nrational basis analyses, Chicago’s system of land-use\nregulation satisfies the requirements of the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause. In general, a zoning ordinance imposing\n“restrictions in respect of the use and occupation of private\nlands in urban communities” such as the “segregation of\nresidential, business, and industrial buildings” satisfies the\nrational basis test as “a valid exercise of authority.” Village\nof Euclid v.

Here, Chicago permits churches to locate in\nR districts as of right, while requiring Special Use approval\nin B and most C districts, not only to promote the general\npublic welfare and to protect the character, stability, order,\nand efficient development of Chicago’s varied areas, but\n\fNo. 01-4030                                                 23\n\nalso to prevent overcrowding, to limit street congestion, and\nto conserve the taxable value of city land. 17 MUN. CODE\nCHI. § 2. Moreover, the CZO makes available avenues by\nwhich exceptions for nonconforming uses may be sought\n(and has made such exceptions in the cases of two plaintiff\nchurches who applied for Special Use approval). Though the\nend result of this zoning scheme may be to afford churches\nbetter opportunities for location in R districts than B, C, or\nM districts, under the amended CZO churches still fare\nbetter than many other nonreligious assembly uses that are\ntreated equally in B, C, and M districts but excluded from\nR districts. To the extent that the CZO treats churches any\ndifferently from nonreligious assembly uses, it does not\ndisfavor churches. More importantly, any such difference is\nrationally related to Chicago’s legitimate interest in\nregulating land use within its city limits. The CZO thus\ncomplies with the requirements of the Equal Protection\nClause.\n  Finally, Appellants challenge the district court’s analysis\nof their Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process\nclaim.9 Specifically, Appellants suggest that the district\ncourt’s characterization of their claim against the Special\nUse approval procedures as one involving property rights,\nrather than any particular use or fundamental activity, is\nat odds with an earlier district court finding that Appel-\nlants’ due process claim “asserted a fundamental liberty\ninterest in their free exercise of religion, freedom of speech,\nand freedom of assembly.” See Civil Liberties for Urban\nBelievers v. Chicago, No. 94 C 6151 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 28, 1997)\n(memorandum opinion and order denying Chicago’s motion\nto dismiss multiple claims). Appellants disregard the fact\nthat this language comes from an order denying Chicago’s\n\n\n9\n  “No State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or\nproperty, without due process of law. . . .” U.S. CONST. amend.\nXIV, § 1.\n\f24                                                  No. 01-4030\n\nmotion to dismiss Appellants’ due process claims pursuant\nto Rule 12(b)(6) of the FRCP. At the summary judgment\nstage, the district court’s finding that a claim is properly\nstated for Rule 12(b)(6) purposes has no effect on its\ndetermination of the merits of that claim. Viewing the facts\nin a light most favorable to Appellants, the district court\nproperly determined that, because Appellants challenged\nthe alleged vagueness of the zoning procedures and stan-\ndards in a manner that any property owner might so do\nirrespective of a particular property use or fundamental\nliberty, the claim focused on property rights rather than\nAppellants’ right to worship. The district court then relied\nupon River Park v. City of Highland Park, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"669122\"><a href=\"/opinion/669122/river-park-inc-and-country-club-estates-ltd-v-city-of-highland-park/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">164</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th\nCir. 1994), to determine that any facial due process attack\non the CZO must be made in state court. As we stated in\nthat case, in which a plaintiff corporation alleged that\nHighland Park’s politically motivated refusal to act on its\nzoning application bankrupted the corporation and deprived\nit of procedural due process,\n     Federal courts are not boards of zoning appeals [and]\n     the procedures “due” in zoning cases are minimal.\n     Cities may elect to make zoning decisions through the\n     political process. . . . Highland Park made a political\n     decision in a political fashion, employing procedural\n     maneuvers that prevented the question from reaching\n     the floor for a vote. . . . [Plaintiff] may not have received\n     the process Illinois directs its municipalities to provide,\n     but the Constitution does not require state and local\n     governments to adhere to their procedural promises.\n     Failure to implement state law violates that state law,\n     not the Constitution; the remedy lies in state court.\nRiver Park, 23 F.3d at 165-67 (citations omitted). Here, too,\nthe CZO and its special approval procedures provide\nAppellants with all the legislative process that is due.\nMoreover, as the district court noted, the CZO expressly\nprovides for the review of zoning decisions by the Illinois\n\fNo. 01-4030                                                 25\n\nCircuit Courts. See 17 MUN. CODE CHI. § 11.3-4; 65 I.L.C.S.\n§ 5/11-13; 735 I.L.C.S. 5/3-104. As such, Appellants cannot\nprevail on their due process claim.\n\n\n                      CONCLUSION\n  Drawing all factual inferences in Appellants’ favor, we\nnonetheless conclude that their statutory and constitutional\nclaims challenging the Chicago Zoning Ordinance are\nwithout merit. We therefore AFFIRM the district court’s\norder granting the City of Chicago’s motion for summary\njudgment.\n\n\n\n\n  POSNER, Circuit Judge, dissenting. This is a difficult\ncase, but I have come to the conclusion that the restrictions\nthat Chicago’s zoning ordinance places on churches (a term\nthat I use broadly to include any religion’s place of worship)\nviolate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. I do not address the other grounds on which\nthe plaintiffs attack the restrictions. The discussion of those\ngrounds occupies most of the majority opinion, which\ndevotes little space to what seems to me to be the strongest\nground of the appeal.\n  The ordinance creates three zones so far as relates to the\nequal protection issue. (I am using the term “zones” func-\ntionally rather than to designate categories in the zoning\nordinance, which, as is apparent from the majority opinion,\nis extremely complicated.) The first “zone” is residential.\nChurches can locate there without having to obtain a\npermit from the zoning board, as can a number of other\nnonresidential entities, such as clubs, restaurants, schools,\n\f26                                               No. 01-4030\n\nlibraries, and drugstores, though restaurants and drug-\nstores only in high-rise apartment buildings. Other nonresi-\ndential land uses in the residential zone, however, either\nrequire a permit or are banned outright. The second zone,\nwhich I shall call “commercial,” is for business and other\ncommercial uses, including not only office buildings and\nretail stores but also wholesale outlets, warehouses, and\nlight manufacturing, but excluding certain transportation\nfacilities and heavy manufacturing. In the commercial zone,\nchurches require a permit. Last is a zone reserved for\ntransportation facilities and heavy manufacturing, which\nI shall call the “manufacturing” zone.

City of Hastings, supra, recognize, though the reason is\ndifferent. The mentally retarded are victims of irrational\n\fNo. 01-4030                                                29\n\nfears and cruel scorn; they are shunned. Religious people\nare not shunned, but religion arouses strong emotions,\nsectarian rivalry is intense and often bitter, and the mixing\nof religion and government is explosive. When government\nsingles out churches for special regulation, as it does in the\nChicago ordinance, the risk of discrimination, not against\nreligion as such—Chicago is not dominated by atheists—but\nagainst particular sects, is great enough to require more\ncareful judicial scrutiny than in the ordinary equal protec-\ntion challenge to zoning.\n  Chicago’s ordinance discriminates in favor of well-\nestablished sects. Not only did they acquire the land on\nwhich their churches are built in residential areas when\nsuch land was relatively cheap and abundant, and there-\nfore affordable by noncommercial entities, such as\nchurches (and there are of course some wealthy churches);\nin addition, because nonconforming uses are grandfathered,\nthe churches that have managed to get permission to\nbuild over the years in nonresidential zones are untouch-\nable. But what of new, small, or impecunious churches,\nsuch as the 40 to 50 obscure sects, one of which has only\n15 members, that compose the principal plaintiff, Civil\nLiberties for Urban Believers? And obscure they are. It\nis telling that of the six other named plaintiffs—Christ\nCenter (150 members), Christian Covenant Outreach\nChurch (ministering to teenagers and former gang mem-\nbers), His Word Ministries to All Nations, Christian Bible\nCenter (35 members), Church on the “Way” Praise Center,\nand Monte de Sino Church, only one (Christian Bible\nCenter) is on the city’s list of area churches. See\nhttp://www.thecityofchicago.org/church/.\n  As David Hume would have predicted, the greater vitality\nof American religion than of religion in countries in which\nthere is an established church or churches owes much to\nour unwillingness to allow government to favor particular\nsects. Laurence R. Iannaccone, Roger Finke & Rodney\n\f30                                               No. 01-4030\n\nStark, “Deregulating Religion: The Economics of Church\nand State,” 35 Econ. Inquiry 350 (1997); Iannaccone, “The\nConsequences of Religious Market Regulation: Adam\nSmith and the Economics of Religion,” 3 Rationality &\nSoc’y 156 (1991). By impairing religious competition, such\nfavoritism turns many people—those not comfortable\nwith the creed or clergy or congregants of the favored\nchurch—off religion.\n  Religious competition presupposes free entry into the\nreligious “marketplace.” A new church is unlikely, however,\nto have the resources necessary for building its place of\nworship in a residential area other than a slum, especially\nas the Chicago ordinance requires that the church provide\nparking, which will mean that unless its building is tiny it\nwill have to acquire more than one city lot. A church that\nwants to build in the commercial zone, where land is\ncheaper, must obtain a special permit; and if it wants to\nbuild in the manufacturing zone, it is out of luck unless it\ncan procure an amendment to the zoning ordinance. At\nissue in Congregation Kol Ami v. Abington Township was a\nzoning ordinance that excluded churches from residential\nareas; this is some evidence that the City is wrong to\nsuppose that it is any longer the case that churches fit\nbetter into residential than nonresidential areas. The\nphenomenon of the “storefront church”—an apt description\nof the churches in this case—reflects both the inability of a\nnew, small church to afford to build in a residential area\nand the fact that a new church needs to advertise its\npresence, which it can do at little cost just by being located\nin a commercial area, where there are more passersby than\nin a residential area.\n       Small storefront or house churches can be found in\n     many places in the city. A recent article by George\n     Gallup reports that 40% of all American adults meet in\n     small religious groups. Not surprisingly, a large num-\n     ber of these groups are in fact storefront or house\n\fNo. 01-4030                                                31\n\n    churches which revolve around Bible study, prayer, and\n    Sunday school.\n      This is not happening in just a Christian context.\n    Within the New Age movement, Muslim, Hindu, and\n    even Jewish traditions, small groups are gathering in\n    storefront meeting houses. These storefront worship\n    spaces will continue to grow for many reasons, but the\n    one that will affect them even more than group dynam-\n    ics is city planning. As tighter zoning laws are pass[ed]\n    in Boston and real estate prices continue to sky-rocket,\n    the only place for churches to turn to are existing\n    commercial spaces.\nRobert L. Lewis, Jr., “Ministry Research Project: Storefront\nChurches of Boston; A Photographic Study of Selected\nStorefront and Home Churches in the City of Boston,”\nhttp://www.bu.edu/ccrd/research/completed/storefront. html.\nThe article is about Boston but the analysis in it is equal-\nly applicable to Chicago.\n  Granted, Chicago’s prohibition against locating a church\nin the commercial zone is not absolute. A permit can be\nsought. But obtaining one is costly for a marginal enter-\nprise; the zoning board enjoys broad discretion in deciding\nwhether to grant or deny a permit; and a public hearing is\nrequired at which opposition to the church’s application for\na permit is predictable because churches do not enhance\ncommercial activity (see Lucinda Harper, “Storefront\nChurches: The Neighbors Upscale Stores Don’t Love,” Wall\nSt. J., Mar. 15, 2000, at B1)—this is one of the reasons the\nCity offers in defense of the ordinance. It is a bad reason,\nbut it is the kind of reason likely to impress the zoning\nauthorities.\n  It is a bad reason because while it is true that a church is\nless likely to enhance a commercial area than a\nBloomingdale’s or a Four Seasons is, there are very few\nblocks in Chicago that are purely commercial. A combina-\ntion of grandfathering, the grant of special permits, and\n\f32                                              No. 01-4030\n\nchanges in zoning law has produced a crazy quilt of\nland uses. On Michigan Avenue near our courthouse—\nan area zoned commercial as I have been using the\nterm—retail stores, restaurants, hotels, colleges, office\nbuildings, and clubs jostle cheek by jowl. If one of the\nclubs or colleges were replaced by a church, the commer-\ncial life of Michigan Avenue would not be affected, although\nthe “tone” of the avenue might be lowered by a store-\nfront church. (As a matter of fact, there is a church on\nMichigan Avenue—the Fourth Presbyterian Church. See\nhttp://www.fourthchurch.org/.) For remember those “nega-\ntive attitudes” of which the Court spoke in Cleburne? Not\nonly are mainline churches apt to be hostile to upstarts\nsuch as the members of Civil Liberties for Urban Believers,\nand particularly to storefront churches, but even people who\nare not caught up in sectarian rivalries might consider the\npresence of a church rather a downer in a “fast” district,\nsuch as Old Town. Indeed, a permit for one of CLUB’s\nmembers was denied because it was thought that the\npresence of a church would impede the transformation of\nthe area into a “nightclub district.”\n  The City’s brief offers the further, but absurdly paternal-\nistic, argument that it is bad for the churches themselves to\nbe located in commercial or industrial areas, because of\nnoise and commotion. Obviously that is a judgment for the\nchurch to make rather than government, by trading off the\ncost to the church of noisy and profane surroundings\nagainst the benefits in lower costs of land acquisition and\nproximity to sinners, including prostitutes, drug addicts,\nand gang members, whose souls are particularly in need of\nsaving. At oral argument the City’s lawyer pressed another\npoint, that the mysterious exclusion of churches from the\nmanufacturing zone is justified by the fact that if they\nclustered there they might try to expel the factories by\nbringing a nuisance suit. Because Illinois rejects the\ndoctrine of “coming to the nuisance,” City of Pana v. Central\nWashed Coal Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">992</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 998 (Ill. 1913); Oehler v.\n\fNo. 01-4030                                                 33\n\nLevy, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">271</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 273-74 (Ill. 1908); see also Wheat v.\nFreeman Coal Mining Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2024024\"><a href=\"/opinion/2024024/wheat-v-freeman-coal-mining-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">290</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 294 (Ill. App.\n1974), it is not a defense to a nuisance suit that the nui-\nsance was there before the plaintiff. The lawyer’s vision of\nchurches concentrating in the manufacturing zone and then\nbringing a nuisance suit to transform it into—what, a\nreligious zone?—is fanciful. But even if it were realistic, the\nCity, which is a part of Illinois state government from the\nstandpoint of the application of the equal protection clause,\ncannot defend discrimination by arguing that it is coerced\nby state law. Otherwise a state could pass a law requiring\nthe police to beat anyone they arrested, and police sued for\nviolating the Fourth Amendment for using excessive force\nin effecting seizures of the person would have a defense,\nwhich no one believes. The state can untie the City’s hands\nby authorizing a “coming to the nuisance” defense, either\ngenerally or just for the benefit of manufacturers whose\nfactories are in cities. Anyway a nuisance suit would not\nsucceed unless the plaintiff could show a net increase in\nland values from abating the nuisance; and if so this would\nimply that the City was better off for the suit.\n  The City’s final argument is that the zoning ordinance\nrepresents a “global bargain” whereby churches get pre-\nferred treatment in the residential zone and secular uses\nget preferred treatment in the commercial zone. If one\nassumes, as I would, that the exclusion of commercial uses\nfrom the residential zone is rational (deny that, and one\ncondemns virtually all zoning as irrational), the exclusion\nof churches from the commercial zone would be rational if\ntheir presence would crowd out commercial users. But that\nis an absurd suggestion. A slightly more realistic worry\nwould be that if churches are allowed to bid for land zoned\ncommercial, the price of such land will rise, to the detri-\nment of commercial users of it, because the amount of land\nis fixed and the demand would have increased. But the\naggregate demand of churches for land zoned commercial is\n\f34                                               No. 01-4030\n\ntoo slight in relation to the amount of that land for allowing\nthem to bid on it to affect the price noticeably.\n   Thus far I have been discussing the ordinance as it was\namended in 2000 in virtual acknowledgment that its\npredecessor was in violation of the Constitution. For the\npredecessor ordinance allowed fraternal lodges and other\nclubs, community centers, and other meeting places to\nlocate in the commercial zone without obtaining a permit.\n(The amendment eliminated this privilege, though colleges,\nunion lodges, libraries, and funeral homes, along with the\nconventional business and commercial establishments,\nretain it.) The only difference between them and churches\nis that they are secular. There is no difference so far as the\nuse of land is concerned. The “global bargain” defense is\nparticularly questionable as applied to the old ordinance. A\nchurch is no more or less suitable for the residential zone\nthan a fraternal lodge and a fraternal lodge no more or less\nsuitable for the commercial zone than a church. The old\nordinance discriminated arbitrarily in favor of churches in\nthe residential zone and against them in the commercial\nzone, thus distorting religious competition in favor of\nexisting and against new churches. The new ordinance\nretains one completely unreasonable distinction, that\nbetween union lodges and churches, putting one in mind of\nthe Spanish Civil War, a struggle between syndicalism and\nclericalism. The distinction between churches on the one\nhand and libraries and colleges on the other hand, another\ndistinction retained by the amended ordinance, is only a\nlittle more rational.\n   The plaintiffs filed their suit almost a decade ago, before\nthe ordinance was amended. The amendment did not moot\ntheir challenge to the old ordinance because they seek\ndamages for the delay they encountered in obtaining\npermission to build in desirable locations. If as I contend\nthe requirement of a permit was unconstitutional because\nit discriminated in favor of fraternal lodges, then the delay\n\fNo. 01-4030                                               35\n\nthe plaintiffs encountered in finding suitable quarters was\nthe consequence of a constitutional violation and the\nplaintiffs are entitled to damages. As an example of the\nrunarounds that the plaintiffs experienced in obtaining a\nspecial permit in the commercial zone, consider the hegira\nof the Christian Bible Church. From small beginnings (like\nChristianity itself), meeting in a private home, the congre-\ngation in 1988 began meeting in a funeral parlor, hardly an\nauspicious site. In 1990 it found a suitable building in the\ncommercial zone, but did not apply for a permit after being\ntold that the alderman for the ward in which the building\nwas located would not allow a church at that location. The\nfollowing year Christian Bible bought a building in another\npart of the commercial zone, applied for a permit, and was\nturned down. After trying without success to sell the\nbuilding, the church renovated it, and while the building\nwas closed for renovations the congregation met in rented\nquarters or private homes. The renovations completed,\nChristian Bible applied for and this time received a permit\nto use the building as its church. By now it was 1993; it had\ntaken three years to find suitable space. As Christian Bible\nhas only 35 members, the burden that the ordinance\nimposed on it was formidable.\n  Chicago’s zoning ordinance imposes the same severe\nburden on new churches that the ordinance invalidated in\nthe Cleburne case imposed on homes for the mentally\nretarded, and with no greater justification. In doing so it\ndenied the plaintiffs the equal protection of the laws.\n\nA true Copy:\n      Teste:\n                        ________________________________\n                        Clerk of the United States Court of\n                           Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\n                   USCA-02-C-0072—8-20-03\n\f</pre>",
