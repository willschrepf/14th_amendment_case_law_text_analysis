INTRODUCTION\n\nC.H. Robinson Company (\"CHR\") appeals from the district\ncourt's order of November 7, 1997, denying its motion to\nexclude certain suppliers of perishable agricultural\ncommodities (\"produce\") from the universe of unpaid\nsuppliers entitled to recover benefits under the statutory\ntrust created by the Perishable Agricultural Commodities\nAct, 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c). CHR intervened in this action filed\nby Idahoan Fresh (\"Idahoan\") against Advantage Produce,\nInc. (\"Advantage\") to enforce the trust and challenged\nIdahoan's proposed schedule of qualified claimants under\nthe trust.\n\nThe district court had jurisdiction pursuant to 7 U.S.C.\nS 499e(c)(5). We have jurisdiction over the district court's\ninterlocutory order denying the exclusion of Idahoan and\nAlsum Produce, Inc. (\"Alsum\") as qualified beneficiaries\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. S 1292(b) as the district court\ncertified the order of November 7, 1997, for immediate\n\n                                  2\n\fappeal and we granted CHR's Petition for Permission to\nAppeal.\n\nII. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\nA. Statutory and Regulatory Framework of Perishabl e\nAgricultural Commodities Act of 1930\n\nWe begin with a brief overview of the Perishable\nAgricultural Commodities Act (\"PACA\"). In 1930, Congress\nenacted PACA to promote fair trading practices in the\nproduce industry. See 7 U.S.C. S 499a et seq.; Consumers\nProduce Co. v. Volante Wholesale Produce, Inc., 16 F.3d\n1374, 1377 (3d Cir. 1993). In particular, Congress intended\nPACA to protect small farmers and growers who were\nvulnerable to the practices of financially irresponsible\nbuyers.1 See Hull Co. v. Hauser's Foods, Inc., 924 F.2d 777,\n780 (8th Cir. 1991). Under PACA, it is unlawful for buyers\nof produce, inter alia, to fail to make prompt payment for a\nshipment of produce. See 7 U.S.C. S 499b(4). A buyer's\nfailure to tender prompt payment triggers civil liability and\nthe possible revocation of the buyer's PACA license required\nby 7 U.S.C. S 499c. See 7 U.S.C. SS 499e(a), 449h(a).\nPrompt payment is defined by regulations which apply\nunless the parties agree otherwise in writing prior to the\ntransaction. See 7 C.F.R. S 46.2(aa).\n\nIn 1984, Congress amended PACA to protect further\ncertain unpaid suppliers2 of produce by including a\nstatutory trust provision which provides an additional\nremedy for sellers against a buyer failing to make prompt\npayment. See P.L. 98-273; H.R. Rep. No. 98-543, at 2\n(1983), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 405, 406. Prior to\nthis amendment, unpaid produce suppliers were unsecured\ncreditors vulnerable to the buyers' practice of granting\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. The statute and regulations speak in terms of \"commission merchant,\ndealer and broker.\" See 7 U.S.C. S 499a et seq. For ease of reference, we\nrefer to these participants as \"buyers.\"\n\n2. The statute and regulations use the terms \"supplier, seller, or agent.\"\nThis opinion refers to the these participants interchangeably as suppliers\nor sellers.\n\n                               3\n\fother creditors a security interest in their inventory and\naccounts receivable. See Tom Lange Co. v. Lombardo Fruit\n& Produce Co. (In re Lombardo Fruit & Produce Co.), 12 F.3d\n806, 808-09 (8th Cir. 1994) (citing H.R. Rep. No. 98-543, at\n3 (1983), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 405, 407). Under\nthe 1984 provision, a buyer's produce, products derived\nfrom that produce, and the proceeds gained therefrom are\nheld in a non-segregated, floating trust for the benefit of\nunpaid suppliers who have met the applicable statutory\nrequirements. See 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c); 7 C.F.R. S 46.46(b).\nThus, the provision gives certain unpaid sellers of produce\nan interest in the PACA trust assets superior to that of a\nperfected, secured creditor. See Consumers Produce, 16\nF.3d at 1379. In a 1995 amendment to PACA, which we\ndiscuss below, Congress made procedural changes in the\ntrust fund provisions. See P.L. 104-48,S 6, 7 U.S.C.\nS 499e(c)(4).\n\nTo enforce its rights under the statutory trust, a qualified\nbeneficiary may file a claim in the district court\nimmediately upon the buyer's failure to tender prompt\npayment. See 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(5). A qualified unpaid seller\nremains entitled to benefits until paid in full. See 7 C.F.R.\nS 46.46(c)(1). A seller eligible for the statutory trust benefits\nmust preserve its rights by satisfying a notice requirement\nby either sending notice to the buyer within 30 days of a\npayment default or, as provided in the 1995 amendment to\nPACA, including a statutory statement referencing the trust\non its invoices. See 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(3), (4); 7 C.F.R.\nS 46.46(c), (f). While a seller may agree in writing to a\npayment period other than that defined in the regulations\nas prompt, an unpaid seller loses its right to participate in\nthe trust if it agrees in writing to extend the payment period\nbeyond 30 days. See 7 C.F.R. S 46.46(e)(2). The issue\npresented by this appeal is whether a seller also forfeits its\nright to participate in the PACA trust if it fails to reduce to\nwriting an agreement to extend the payment term.\n\nB. Current Dispute\n\nOver a period of several months, Advantage purchased\nproduce from Idahoan, CHR, Alsum, O.P. Murphy & Sons\n(\"Murphy\"), and Powerhouse Produce, L.L.C.\n\n                               4\n\f(\"Powerhouse\"). The details of these transactions are not in\ndispute.3\n\nIn a series of transactions from August 7, 1996, through\nDecember 28, 1996, Idahoan sold a total of $116,684.26\nworth of produce on credit to Advantage. See app. 9.4 All of\nIdahoan's invoices to Advantage contain the language\nrequired under 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(4), the 1995 PACA\namendment, to notify the buyer that the seller intends to\npreserve its trust claim against the buyer. Idahoan and\nAdvantage did not enter into a written agreement extending\nthe payment term which, in this case, in the absence of a\nwritten agreement altering the term, is ten days. See 7\nC.F.R. S 46.2(aa)(5). However, William Carson, president of\nAdvantage, alleges that they had an oral agreement\nextending the payment term to 20 days. Additionally, 28 of\nthe 30 outstanding invoices issued by Idahoan to\nAdvantage stated \"PAYMENT TERMS: Net 20 days.\" The\nremaining two invoices contain no payment term.\n\nAlsum sold, on credit, a total of $10,708.00 worth of\nproduce to Advantage in two transactions on October 9 and\n24, 1996. Alsum and Advantage did not enter into a written\nagreement extending the payment term. As with Idahoan,\nCarson claims that Alsum and Advantage had an oral\nagreement to extend the term, though in Alsum's case the\nextended term was 15 rather than 20 days.\nNotwithstanding the oral agreement, both of Alsum's\nunpaid invoices state \"PAYMENT TERMS: NET 10.\" Both\ninvoices also contain the statutory language as provided in\nthe 1995 PACA amendment notifying Advantage that Alsum\nintended to preserve its PACA trust claim.\n\nCHR sold $36,004.80 worth of produce to Advantage\npursuant to their written agreement to extend the payment\nterm to 30 days. CHR's invoices for these sales included a\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. Because there seems to be no dispute that Murphy and Powerhouse\nare qualified PACA trust beneficiaries, we need not be concerned with\nthe details of their transactions with Advantage. Our discussion of the\nfacts therefore is limited to Advantage's transactions with Alsum,\nIdahoan, and CHR.\n\n4. Citations to the appendix refer to the tab number because the pages\nof the Appendix are not numbered continuously.\n\n                               5\n\fpayment term of 30 days as well as the statutory language\nrequired to preserve its interest in the PACA trust. See app.\n5.\n\nAdvantage failed to pay Idahoan, Alsum, and CHR the\namounts due on these outstanding invoices. On February\n10, 1997, Idahoan filed a complaint against Advantage and\nits officers, William Carson and William Carson III, for\ndamages and injunctive relief alleging violations of PACA\nbased upon Advantage's failure to pay its invoices and\nbreach of the statutory trust. The district court issued a\ntemporary restraining order on February 11, 1997,\nenjoining the defendants from further dissipating the\nconstructive trust imposed by 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c). On\nFebruary 20, 1997, Idahoan and Advantage filed a\nStipulated Order for Preliminary Injunction which stated a\nprocedure for identifying all of Advantage's qualified and\nunpaid PACA trust creditors.\n\nCHR intervened as a party plaintiff in the action on May\n27, 1997. See app. 5. On June 2, 1997, Idahoan and\nAdvantage filed a Joint Status Report and Motion for an\nOrder for the Distribution of PACA Trust Proceeds (\"Joint\nMotion\") identifying the following universe of qualified PACA\ntrust creditors:\n\n       Idahoan                 $ 116,684.26\n       CHR                        36,004.80\n       Murphy                      4,300.00\n       Alsum                      10,708.00\n       Powerhouse                  4,868.00\n                               ____________\n                               $ 172,565.06\n\nApp. 6.\n\nAlthough CHR was a party to the action at the time\nAdvantage and Idahoan filed the Joint Motion, they did not\nconsult CHR or invite CHR to join in the Joint Motion. On\nJune 5, 1997, CHR filed an objection to the Joint Motion\nand served discovery requests upon Advantage seeking\ndocuments which established the alleged qualified status of\nthe creditors set forth in the Joint Motion. See app. 7. CHR\nthen filed a Motion to Exclude Alsum and Idahoan from the\nuniverse of qualified PACA trust creditors on the grounds\n\n                                6\n\fthat they failed to comply with the statute and regulations.\nIn particular, CHR argued that Idahoan and Alsum orally\nagreed to extend the payment term beyond the ten-day\nperiod established in the regulations, and they were,\ntherefore, not qualified PACA trust creditors because the\nagreements were not reduced to writing prior to the\ntransaction. See app. 9.\n\nAt the time of briefing on this appeal, the total amount of\navailable PACA trust funds was approximately $45,000.00.\nSee Br. for Appellant at 5. If Idahoan and Alsum are\nexcluded from the universe of qualified trust beneficiaries,\nthe total qualified and unpaid trust claims would be\n$45,172.80. Thus, their exclusion would result in payment\nvirtually in full, rather than a small pro-rata portion, to the\nqualified PACA trust creditors, CHR, Powerhouse, and\nMurphy.\n\nOn November 7, 1997, the district court issued an order\ndenying CHR's Motion to Exclude Idahoan and Alsum citing\n\"the reasons stated of record at the argument of the\nmotion.\" App. 12. Following argument on CHR's motion to\nexclude, the district court stated that an oral agreement to\nextend a payment term is totally ineffective and, provided\nthat the supplier complies with the notice provisions of the\nstatute, it is a qualified PACA trust beneficiary. See Br. for\nAppellee, Attach. at 11-12.5 Thereafter, CHR filed a motion\nfor reconsideration or, in the alternative, certification\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. S 1292(b). On December 1, 1997, the\ndistrict court certified the November 7, 1997 order, for\nimmediate appeal, the controlling question of law being\nwhether Idahoan and Alsum \"perfected their trust claims\nunder PACA.\" On February 19, 1998, we granted CHR's\nPetition for Permission to Appeal. See app. 1, 14.\n\nIII. DISCUSSION\n\nCHR contends that the district court erred in finding that\nIdahoan and Alsum were qualified to receive statutory\nbenefits under PACA. According to CHR, the plain\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. A partial transcript of the argument is included as an Attachment to\nthe Brief for the Appellee, Idahoan.\n\n                               7\n\flanguage, legislative history, and purposes of the statute\nand regulations lead to the conclusion that a seller forfeits\nits right to PACA trust benefits if it orally agrees to extend\nthe payment term beyond that established in the\nregulations as prompt, in this case, ten days.\n\nThere is no dispute that Idahoan and Alsum did not\nreduce to writing their agreements to extend the payment\nperiod in their transactions with Advantage. There is also\nno dispute that Idahoan's and Alsum's invoices properly\nnotified Advantage of their intent to preserve their right to\nstatutory benefits under 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(4). Thus, as we\nhave indicated, this appeal raises the following issue\nregarding the proper interpretation of PACA: whether an\nagreement to extend the payment term beyond the time\ndefined by the regulations as prompt must be in writing in\norder for the seller to qualify for the benefits of the PACA\ntrust. Because this appeal concerns solely the legal issue of\nthe proper interpretation of statutes and regulations, we\nexercise de novo review over the district court's order. See\nShell Oil Co. v. Babbit, 125 F.3d 172, 175 (3d Cir. 1997).\n\nWe initially point out that certain general precepts guide\nus on this appeal. The role of the courts in interpreting a\nstatute is to give effect to Congress's intent. See Negonsott\nv. Samuels, 507 U.S. 99, 104, 113 S.Ct. 1119, 1122-23\n(1993). Because it is presumed that Congress expresses its\nintent through the ordinary meaning of its language, every\nexercise of statutory interpretation begins with plain\nlanguage of the statute itself. See Santa Fe Med. Servs., Inc.\nv. Segal (In re Segal), 57 F.3d 342, 345 (3d Cir. 1995)\n(citing Mansell v. Mansell, 490 U.S. 581, 588, 109 S.Ct.\n2023, 2028 (1989)); United States v. Pelullo, 14 F.3d 881,\n903 (3d Cir. 1994). Where the statutory language is plain\nand unambiguous, further inquiry is not required, except in\nthe extraordinary case where a literal reading of the\nlanguage produces an absurd result. See In re Segal, 57\nF.3d at 346. Moreover, a court may depart from the plain\nlanguage of a statute only by an extraordinary showing of\na contrary congressional intent in the legislative history.\nSee Garcia v. United States, 469 U.S. 70, 75, 105 S.Ct. 479,\n482 (1984).\n\n                               8\n\fIn interpreting a statute, courts should endeavor to give\nmeaning to every word which Congress used and therefore\nshould avoid an interpretation which renders an element of\nthe language superfluous. See United States v. State of\nAlaska, ___ U.S. ___, 117 S.Ct. 1888, 1918 (1997); United\nFood & Commercial Workers Union Local 751 v. Brown\nGroup, Inc., 517 U.S. 544, 550, 116 S.Ct. 1529, 1533\n(1996) (reading which gives effect to all of a statute's\nprovisions prevails over one which disregards a provision as\nlegislative oversight); First Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. FDIC, 79 F.3d\n362, 367 (3d Cir. 1996); Insurance Co. of N. Am. v. Cohn (In\nre Cohn), 54 F.3d 1108, 1115 (3d Cir. 1995). This basic\ntenet of statutory construction applies equally to the\ninterpretation of regulations. See Silverman v. Eastich\nMultiple Investor Fund, LP, 51 F.3d 28, 31 (3d Cir. 1995)\n(dealing with canon that court should construe statutory\nlanguage so that all provisions are given effect); LaVallee\nNorthside Civic Ass'n v. Virgin Islands Coastal Zone\nManagement Comm'n, 866 F.2d 616, 623 (3d Cir. 1989)\n(regulation which conflicts with statute under which it was\npromulgated is ineffective, but court should endeavor to\nreconcile the two). Thus, the preferred construction of a\nstatute and its regulations is the one that gives meaning to\nall provisions. See United States v. Higgins, 128 F.3d 138,\n142 (3d Cir. 1997).\n\nIn addition to following these general canons of statutory\nconstruction, we are mindful that PACA, which was enacted\nto protect unpaid suppliers of produce and alleviate the\nburden of nonpayment on commerce, see 7 U.S.C.\nS 499e(c)(1); H.R. Rep. No. 98-543, at 3-4 (1983), reprinted\nin 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 407, is remedial legislation which\na court should construe broadly to effectuate its purpose.\nSee Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U.S. 332, 336, 88 S.Ct. 548,\n553 (1967); RNS Servs., Inc. v. Secretary of Labor, Mine\nSafety & Health Admin., 115 F.3d 182, 186-87 (3d Cir.\n1997); see also Hull, 924 F.2d at 782; Exportal LTDA. v.\nUnited States, 902 F.2d 45, 46 (D.C. Cir. 1990); Harry Klein\nProduce Corp. v. United States Dep't of Agric., 831 F.2d 403,\n405 (2d Cir. 1987).\n\nWith these principles in mind, we begin our analysis with\nthe statutory and regulatory language. The statute and\n\n                               9\n\fregulations refer, in numerous instances, to the\nrequirement that an agreement to extend the prompt\npayment period be in writing. This appeal requires us to\ndetermine whether that requirement relates only to the\nenforceability of such an agreement or is a precondition to\na seller's qualification for trust benefits. We turn first to the\nsection of the statutory trust provision which refers to the\nwriting requirement.\n\nThe statutory trust provision provides that the produce,\nproducts derived from that produce, and any proceeds\ngained therefrom are held in trust by the buyer for the\nbenefit of unpaid sellers until such sellers are paid in full.\nSee 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(2). Two subsections condition this\nprovision by requiring an unpaid seller to preserve its rights\nto the trust benefits by notifying the buyer of its intent to\ndo so, 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(3), which we discussfirst, and 7\nU.S.C. S 499(c)(4), which we discuss below. In the context of\nestablishing this notice requirement, the statute refers to\nthe mandate that an agreement must be in writing. In\nparticular, the statute provides that\n\n       (3) The unpaid supplier . . . shall lose the benefits of\n       such trust unless such person has given written notice\n       of intent to preserve the benefits of the trust to the\n       [buyer] within thirty calendar days (i) after the\n       expiration of the time prescribed by which payment\n       must be made, as set forth in regulations issued by the\n       Secretary; [or] (ii) after expiration of such other time by\n       which payment must be made, as the parties have\n       expressly agreed to in writing before entering into the\n       transaction . . . . When the parties expressly agree to\n       a payment time period different from that established\n       by the Secretary, a copy of any such agreement shall\n       be filed in the records of each party to the transaction\n       and the terms of payment shall be disclosed on\n       invoices, accountings, and other documents relating to\n       the transaction.\n\n7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(3).6\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. Section 499e(c)(3) also provides that proper notice may be given within\n30 days after the seller receives notice that the payment instrument\npresented by the buyer had been dishonored. See 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(3).\nThe facts of the transactions in this case do not implicate this portion\nof\nthe statute.\n\n                               10\n\fAccording to CHR, the plain language of section\n499e(c)(3), in particular Congress's use of the term\"shall,\"\nunambiguously requires that an agreement to extend the\npayment term be in writing in order for the seller to\npreserve its PACA trust benefits. This reading overstates\nwhat the subsection requires. The statute provides that an\nunpaid seller \"shall lose the benefits of such trust unless\nsuch person has given written notice of intent to preserve the\nbenefits of such trust.\" 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(3) (emphasis\nadded). The remainder of that sentence establishes the time\nperiod in which such notice must be given. In the context\nof defining timely notification, the statute then provides\nthat agreements to extend payment terms must be in\nwriting and that parties shall maintain a copy of such an\nagreement and disclose the terms of the agreement on\ninvoices and other documents relating to the transaction.\nSee 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(3); see also 7 C.F.R. S 46.2(aa)(11).\n\nThus, Congress, using the verb \"shall,\" unambiguously\nintended that a seller timely notify the buyer of its intent to\npreserve its rights to PACA trust benefits. The plain and\nunambiguous language of the section does not provide,\nhowever, that a written agreement is a precondition of\nbeing entitled to the statutory trust benefits. Rather, the\nrequirement is relevant to assessing when prompt payment\nis due and therefore when notice is timely.\n\nThe plain language of the regulations supports this\nreading of the statute. The regulations first mention the\nwriting requirement in the context of defining prompt\npayment. As noted above, the regulations establish times\nfor prompt payment for various scenarios. See 7 C.F.R.\nS 46.2(aa)(1) - (10); 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(3). In this case, the\nregulations provide that, unless agreed otherwise in writing,\nprompt payment is defined as payment within ten days of\nthe buyer's acceptance of the produce. See 7 C.F.R.\nS 46.2(aa)(5). The regulations also provide that\n\n       [p]arties who elect to use different times of payment\n       than those set forth [herein] must reduce their\n       agreement to writing before entering into the\n       transaction and maintain a copy of the agreement for\n       their records. If they have so agreed, then payment\n       within the agreed upon time shall constitute `full\n\n                               11\n\f       payment promptly': Provided, That the party claiming\n       the existence of such an agreement for time of payment\n       shall have the burden of proving it.\n\n7 C.F.R. S 46.2(aa)(11). This section unambiguously\nrequires that an agreement to extend a payment term must\nbe in writing prior to the transaction.\n\nThe regulations concerning the statutory trust also refer\nto the writing requirement. In particular, the regulation\nprovides that\n\n       [w]hen a seller, supplier or agent who has met the\n       eligibility requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of\n       this section, transfers ownership, possession, or\n       control of goods to a commission merchant, dealer, or\n       broker, it automatically becomes eligible to participate\n       in the trust. Participants who preserve their rights to\n       benefits in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section\n       remain beneficiaries until they are paid in full.\n\n7 C.F.R. S 46.46(c)(1). Subsection (f) requires that the seller\nproperly notify the buyer of its intent to preserve its PACA\ntrust benefits. See 7 C.F.R. S 46.46(f).7 The \"eligibility\"\nrequirements of paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) provide the\nfollowing:\n\n       (e) Prompt payment and eligibility for trust benefits.\n\n       (1) The times for prompt accounting and prompt\n       payment are set out in S 46.2(z) and (aa). Parties who\n       elect to use different times for payment must reduce\n       their agreement to writing before entering into the\n       transaction and maintain a copy of their agreement for\n       their records, and the times of payment must be\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. This regulation refers to the writing requirement in the same context,\nand virtually to the same extent, as 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(3). In particular,\nthe regulation provides that a seller's notice of an intent to preserve\nthe\nright to PACA trust benefits is timely if given 30 days \"[a]fter\nexpiration\nof such other time by which payment must be made as the parties have\nexpressly agreed to in writing before entering into the transaction, but\nnot longer than [30 days].\" 7 C.F.R. S 46.46(f)(2)(ii). We therefore\nconclude that this section's reference to the writing requirement has the\nsame effect as that of 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(3) discussed above.\n\n                               12\n\f       disclosed on invoices, accountings, and other\n       documents relating to the transaction.\n\n       (2) The maximum time for payment for a shipment to\n       which a seller, supplier, or agent can agree and still\n       qualify for coverage under the trust is 30 days after\n       receipt and acceptance of the commodities as defined\n       in S 46.2(dd) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section.\n\n7 C.F.R. S 46.46(e). As in the statute, section (e)(1) of this\nregulation discusses the writing requirement in the context\nof defining prompt payment for a given transaction. Section\n(e)(2) explicitly provides that a seller is disqualified from\nreceiving trust benefits if it agrees to extend the payment\nterm longer than 30 days from the buyer's acceptance of\nthe produce. The existence of such an explicit\ndisqualification supports our view that the writing\nrequirement is not a prerequisite to eligibility to participate\nin the PACA trust.\n\nUnder CHR's view, these regulations establish eligibility\nrequirements separate from the notice requirement to\npreserve eligibility. CHR argues that the eligibility\nrequirements for sellers who agree to payment terms\nbeyond ten days are that such an agreement be reduced to\nwriting, those terms be included on all invoices regarding\nthe transaction, and that eligibility is lost if the parties\nagree to a payment term over 30 days. CHR asserts that\nthese prerequisites do not apply where there is not an\nagreement to extend a payment term. The plain language\ndoes not support this interpretation.\n\nThe plain language of the statute and regulations\nrequires that an agreement establishing a \"prompt\npayment\" period other than that established in the\nregulations must be in writing. The plain language also\nprovides that an unpaid seller loses its right to PACA trust\nbenefits if (1) it does not timely notify the buyer of its intent\nto preserve that right or (2) it agrees to a payment period\nbeyond 30 days. Because we liberally interpret PACA to\nfurther its remedial purposes of reducing the burden on\ncommerce and protecting unpaid sellers, we find that the\nwriting requirement relates to the enforceability of an\nagreement to extend a payment term, but does not\ndisqualify an unpaid seller from receiving trust benefits.\n\n                               13\n\fIdahoan and Alsum satisfied the notice requirement by\nincluding the requisite language on the face of their\ninvoices to Advantage, see 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(4), and neither\nparty agreed to a payment period over 30 days.8 Their\nfailure to reduce their oral agreements with respect to the\npayment term to writing does not disqualify them, and they\ntherefore are entitled to share in a pro-rata distribution of\nthe statutory trust res until they receive payment in full.\n\nIn so holding, we join the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Eighth Circuit, the only other court of appeals of\nwhich we are aware which has addressed the precise issue\npresented by this appeal, in concluding that a supplier's\nfailure to reduce to writing an agreement to extend the\npayment term does not disqualify that supplier as a PACA\ntrust beneficiary. See Hull, 924 F.2d 777. In Hull, two\nunpaid wholesale distributors of produce, Hull & J.J.\nDistributing, instituted suit against a defunct retail grocery\nstore, Hauser's, to enforce their PACA trust rights. See id.\nat 778. Some of the retail store's assets were seized by one\nof the store's secured creditors, Gateway, who held\nperfected security interests in all of the store's assets and\ninventory. See id. at 778.\n\nIt was undisputed that Hull and J.J. Distributing\nsupplied Hauser's with produce over several years and that\nduring that time the two suppliers orally agreed to a\npayment period of 45 days and 30 days after delivery,\nrespectively. See id. Hull's invoices to Hauser indicated this\nas the payment period, while J.J. Distributing's invoices did\nnot indicate any payment term. See id.\n\nThe district court held that Hull and J.J. Distributing\nwere entitled to trust benefits for their unpaid invoices\nnotwithstanding the fact that they had not reduced their\npayment term extensions to writing. See id. at 779. Finding\nthat the two suppliers had given Hauser's sufficient\nnotification of their intent to preserve their PACA trust\nrights, the district court held that while the plain language\nof the statute makes oral agreements extending the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. We are not reaching the issue of what would happen if the oral\nextension provided for a payment period in excess of 30 days because\nthat situation is not before us in this case. See 7 C.F.R. S 46.46(e)(2).\n\n                               14\n\fpayment term unenforceable, it only disqualifies a supplier\nfrom trust benefits where the supplier enters into a written\nagreement to extend the payment term beyond 30 days. See\nid.\n\nThe court of appeals affirmed the district court,finding\nthat \"oral agreements have no effect on produce sellers'\ntrust protection.\" Id. at 781. According to the court, a buyer\nwho orally agrees to an extension of the payment term\nbeyond ten days makes an arrangement to violate PACA's\nprompt payment provision. See id. at 782. The court found\nthat\n\n       it would be incongruous to disregard oral agreements\n       for purposes of enforcing PACA but recognize them for\n       the purpose of voiding the sellers' protection under the\n       trust. Thus, notwithstanding the oral agreements, both\n       sellers retained the right to demand payment within\n       ten days and seek trust protection under PACA.\n\nId. at 782.9 In concluding its discussion of this issue, the\n\n(Text continued on page 17)\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. We note that the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit has suggested\na conflicting result in two subsequent decisions. See Tom Lange Co. v.\nLombardo Fruit & Produce Co. (In re Lombardo Fruit & Produce Co.), 12\nF.3d 806, 809 (8th Cir. 1993) (hereinafter In re Lombardo II); Goldman\nFruit & Produce Co. v. Lombardo Fruit & Produce Co. (In re Lombardo\nFruit & Produce Co.), 12 F.3d 110 (8th Cir. 1993) (hereinafter In re\nLombardo I). These two cases concern disputes between two different\nproduce suppliers and a single buyer. In both instances, the court held\nthat the unpaid seller was not entitled to PACA trust benefits. See 12\nF.3d at 809; 12 F.3d at 113.\n\nIn In re Lombardo I, although letters and the invoices indicated an\nextended payment period, there was no written agreement which\ncomplied with all respects of PACA and its regulations. See 12 F.3d at\n113. There was also evidence of an oral agreement to extend the\npayment term. In the absence of a valid written agreement under PACA\nto extend the payment term, the court first stated that it could not\nmeasure the timeliness of notice based upon the extended payment\nterm. See id. Then the court rejected the supplier's argument that its\nnotice to the buyer was within 30 days of the expiration of the payment\nperiod established in the regulations. The court held that\n\n       [t]he evidence in the record clearly demonstrates that the parties\n       had an agreement to extend the payment terms beyond the ten days\n\f15\n\f       in the regulations. Though this agreement is insufficient to\npreserve\n       Goldman's trust protection, it is a valid contract between the\n       parties. A predicate to the trust protection is the requirement\nthat\n       payment is delinquent; having agreed to extend the payment period\n       beyond ten days, it would be incongruous to permit Goldman to now\n       claim that no agreement existed and that payment was therefore\n       due within ten days.\n\nId. at 113 (citation omitted).\n\nIn making this statement, the In re Lombardo I court cited the opinion\nin Bowlin & Son, Inc. v. San Joaquin Food Serv., Inc. (In re San Joaquin\nFood Serv., Inc.), 958 F.2d 938, 941 n.2 (9th Cir. 1992). Our reading of\nIn re San Joaquin suggests that the In re Lombardo I court may have\ncited it for a proposition In re San Joaquin did not state. Furthermore,\nIn re Lombardo I did not question Hull. In the circumstances, to the\nextent, if any, that the language in In re Lombardo I conflicts with Hull,\nwe find it unpersuasive.\n\nIn In re Lombardo II, the supplier and the buyer entered into a written\nagreement prior to the transaction to extend the payment term to 30\ndays. See 12 F.3d at 809. This agreement complied with PACA and its\nregulations in all respects. See id. Thereafter, the parties modified the\nagreement in writing in such a manner that no longer complied with\nPACA. See id. Although the court does not explain this subsequent\nwritten agreement or explicitly state in what manner it no longer\ncomplied with PACA, the opinion suggests that the agreement extended\nthe payment term beyond 30 days, for which PACA explicitly disqualifies\na seller as a trust beneficiary. The court found that, at that time, \"an\nagreement complying with PACA no longer existed. There being no\nwritten agreement complying with PACA, Lange is prohibited from\nclaiming PACA's trust protection.\" Id. at 807 (footnote omitted). The\ncourt\nfurther stated that\n\n        PACA imposes a trust upon the funds held by delinquent\n        purchasers if a written agreement required payment within thirty\n        days of delivery. Thus, at the time trust protection is claimed,\nthere\n        must exist a valid written agreement complying with PACA's terms.\n\nId. at 809-10.\n\nThis language could be read to imply that without a written agreement\nto extend the payment term, the seller is not entitled to trust benefits.\nAlthough we believe that such a result would be incorrect in light of the\nexplicit holding to the contrary in Hull, we note the potential conflict\nas\n\f16\n\fcourt also noted that a liberal construction of the statute is\nappropriate because it is remedial legislation. See id. at 782.10\n\nCHR argues that Hull is not applicable to this case\nbecause it was decided prior to Congress's 1995\namendment to the PACA statutory trust which, it argues,\nchanged the statutory landscape. In 1995, Congress added\nsection 499e(c)(4) which provides, as an alternative to the\npost-delinquency methods outlined in subsection 3, an\ninvoicing method of notifying the buyer of a seller's intent\nto preserve its right to trust benefits. See 7 U.S.C.\nS 499e(c)(4). According to CHR, because there was no\ninvoice-notification method under PACA at the time the\ncourt decided Hull, the payment terms were crucial to\ndetermining the timeliness of the notice. CHR asserts that\nthe rationale of Hull is inapplicable to this case where the\ntimeliness of the notice is irrelevant because the sellers\ncomplied with the invoice-notification provision. In essence,\nCHR asserts that our interpretation renders the writing\nrequirement meaningless in cases such as this where the\nsupplier invokes invoice notification.\n\nThe purpose of the 1995 amendment was to remove the\nexpense to the United States Department of Agriculture in\nadministering the trust provisions. See H.R. Rep. No. 104-\n207, at 9 (1995), reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 453, 456.\nUnder the 1995 amendment, a seller may satisfy the notice\nrequirement by including on its regular invoicing\ndocuments a statutory statement indicating the intent to\npreserve its trust rights. See id. An invoice which serves as\nnotice to preserve a seller's trust rights also must include\n\"[t]he terms of the payment if they differ from prompt\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nwe are unsure of the court's intentions. Of course, the court may have\nmeant nothing more than that the trust protection was lost because the\npayment period was extended in writing beyond 30 days contrary to 7\nC.F.R. S 46.46(e)(2). If so, In re Lombardo II is not inconsistent with\nHull\nwhich involved an oral extension by one seller to 45 days.\n\n10. We recognize that one of the suppliers in Hull agreed to a payment\nperiod of 45 days. As we have indicated, we are not reaching the issue\nof what would happen if the oral extension provided for a period in\nexcess of 30 days. See n.8, supra. The Hull court did not distinguish\nbetween a 30-day and 45-day period.\n\n                               17\n\fpayment set out in section 46.2(z) and (aa) of this part, and\nthe parties have expressly agreed to such terms in writing\nbefore the affected transactions occur.\" 7 C.F.R.\nS 46.46(f)(3)(ii). The writing requirement therefore is not\nrendered superfluous under our interpretation of the\nstatute where the seller invokes the invoice-notification\nprovision. Rather, a written agreement to extend the\npayment period gives rise to the obligation to include the\npayment term on the invoice which serves as notice of the\nseller's intent to preserve it PACA rights.\n\nDistrict courts in other circuits have followed, either\nimplicitly or explicitly, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth\nCircuit's approach in Hull. See A & J Produce Corp. v. CIT\nGroup/Factoring, Inc., 829 F. Supp. 651, 655 (S.D.N.Y.\n1993) (holding that only a written agreement to extend a\npayment term beyond 30 days forfeits the seller's rights, so\nthat in the absence of a written agreement otherwise, a\nseller is entitled to enforce its right to full payment against\nthe buyer within ten days of delivery of the produce);\nContinental Fruit Co. v. Thomas J. Gatziolis & Co., 774 F.\nSupp. 449, 452 (N.D. Ill. 1991) (holding that evidence of a\ncourse of dealing between the parties accepting payment\nbeyond 30 days does not forfeit an unpaid seller's right to\nstatutory benefits); C.H. Robinson Co. v. B.H. Produce Co.,\n723 F. Supp. 785, 797 (N.D. Ga. 1989), aff'd sub nom.,\nC.H. Robinson Co. v. Trust Co. Bank, N.A., 952 F.2d 1311\n(11th Cir. 1992) (discussing the lack of a written agreement\nto extend the payment period only in reference to the\ntimeliness of the notice). In each of these cases, there was\nno evidence of a prior written agreement to extend the\npayment term, yet the courts held that the unpaid sellers\nwere entitled to PACA trust benefits if they notified the\nbuyers within 40 days after the delivery of the produce,\nwhich is 30 days after the expiration of the ten-day prompt\npayment period established by the regulations.\n\nIn addition, at least one court has described the PACA\nwriting requirement for agreements to extend payment\nterms as being in the nature of a statute of frauds. See\nDebruyn Produce Co. v. Richmond Produce Co. (In re\nRichmond Produce Co.), 112 B.R. 364, 374 (Bankr. N.D.\nCal. 1990). In In re Richmond, the court was faced with the\n\n                               18\n\fissue of whether certain notices were timely to preserve the\nsellers' rights to statutory trust benefits. Finding that\ncertain letters satisfied the writing requirement and\ntherefore validly extended the payment term, the court\nfound that the notices sent were timely because they were\nsent within 30 days of the expiration of the extended\npayment period. In so holding, the court commented that\n\n       the purpose of the writing requirement is to preclude\n       uncertainties as to the applicable payment terms and\n       the resulting deadline for filing a PACA notice. Thus,\n       the provision at issue is in the nature of a statute of\n       frauds and serves the same purpose. This conclusion is\n       supported by the statutory requirement that both\n       parties maintain a copy of the agreement in their\n       records and that the terms of the payment be disclosed\n       on `invoices. . . .'\n\nId. at 374 (citation omitted). Thus, the court viewed the\nwriting requirement as relevant to assessing when prompt\npayment is due and not as a precondition to preserving\nstatutory trust benefits.\n\nCHR urges this court to join those courts which have\nrequired strict compliance with the preconditions of the\nstatutory trust.11 See, e.g., Bowlin & Son, Inc. v. San\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11. Most of the case law considering whether strict or substantial\ncompliance is necessary addresses the notice requirement. There is\nauthority in support of both positions. Compare Anic, Inc. v. Chipwich,\nInc. (In re Chipwich, Inc.), 165 B.R. 135, 136 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1994)\n(requirements of notice to preserve trust must be complied with strictly\nsuch that wrong name on notice renders it ineffective); Blair Merriam\nFresh Fruit & Produce Co. v. Clark (In re D.K.M.B., Inc.), 95 B.R. 774,\n779\n(Bankr. D. Colo. 1989) (requiring strict compliance with content of\nnotice); In re Marvin Properties, Inc., 854 F.2d 1183, 1186 (9th Cir.\n1988)\n(requiring notice to be given by seller itself andfinding that the buyer's\nactual knowledge of the seller's intent was insufficient to preserve its\nstatutory PACA trust benefits) with In re Richmond Produce Co., 112 B.R.\n364 (Bankr. N.D. Cal. 1990) (holding that substantial compliance with\nnotice requirement is sufficient to preserve right to trust benefits such\nthat early notification or notice lacking certain information is\neffective);\nDubin v. Carlton Fruit Co. (In re Carlton Fruit Co.), 84 B.R. 810 (Bankr.\nM.D. Fla. 1988) (requiring substantial compliance with requirements for\n\n                               19\n\fJoaquin Food Serv., Inc. (In re San Joaquin Food Serv., Inc.),\n958 F.2d 938, 940 (9th Cir. 1992) (requiring strict\ncompliance with the clear mandate of Congress to include\nthe payment term on an invoice); In re John DeFrancesco &\nSons, Inc., 114 B.R. 335, 336 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1990)\n(requiring strict compliance with the preconditions of\nparticipation in trust benefits). But, this case presents the\nissue of whether the writing requirement is a precondition\nto qualification as a PACA trust beneficiary. Only if we\nanswered that question positively would we be required to\nreach the issue of whether strict or substantial compliance\nwith that requirement was necessary to preserve properly\nan unpaid seller's right to receive benefits. Having found\nthat it is not and is rather only relevant to determining\nwhat constitutes prompt payment in a given transaction,\nwe need not decide today whether strict compliance with\nthe requirements of PACA trust eligibility is required.\n\nNonetheless, we recognize that these cases support the\ninterpretation urged by CHR. Although the Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit has not addressed explicitly the\nprecise issue presented by this appeal, its ruling on a\nsimilar issue suggests a conclusion other than the one we\nreach today. In In re San Joaquin the court held that a\nproduce supplier was not entitled to PACA trust benefits\nwhere the invoices it issued to the buyer did not contain\nthe payment term agreed upon by the two parties in writing\nprior to the transaction. See 958 F.2d 938.\n\nIn In re San Joaquin, there was no dispute that the\nsupplier gave the buyer timely notice of its intent to\npreserve its interest in the trust or that the agreement to\nextend the payment term was in writing. See id. at 939-40.\nThus, the sole issue presented was whether the supplier's\nfailure to include the payment term on the invoice forfeited\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nnotice such that failure to include date of transaction, contract terms\nand amount due did not render notice ineffective to preserve benefits of\nthe statutory trust); In re W.L. Bradley Co., 75 B.R. 505, 511 (Bankr.\nE.D. Pa. 1987) (holding that premature filing of notice under section\n499e(c)(3) was effective). Because there is no dispute that Alsum and\nIdahoan complied with the invoice-notice provision, we need not address\nthis issue today.\n\n                                20\n\fits rights to the PACA trust. As discussed above, 7 U.S.C.\nS 499e(c)(3) requires that \"[w]hen the parties expressly agree\nto a payment time period different from that established by\nthe Secretary, a copy of any such agreement shall befiled\nin the record of each party to the transaction and the terms\nof payment shall be disclosed on invoices, accountings, and\nother documents relating to the transaction.\" (emphasis\nadded). The In re San Joaquin court found that the\nprovision relating to the disclosure of the payment terms on\ninvoices was a requirement to preserve a supplier's trust\nrights. See id. at 940. The court found that because this\nwas a clear mandate of Congress as expressed in\nunambiguous statutory terms, sellers must comply strictly\nwith it to receive trust benefits. See id.\n\nIt is possible that the Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit also would hold that the requirement of a written\nagreement to extend the payment term beyond the period\nprescribed in the regulations is a prerequisite to preserving\na supplier's rights to PACA trust benefits. After all, that\nrequirement is in the same clause in 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(3)\nas the requirement that extended payment terms be\nindicated on invoices.\n\nIn re John DeFrancesco & Sons, Inc., 114 B.R. 335, also\nis inconsistent with the interpretation of PACA that we have\nadopted. The court held that\n\n       in order to preserve its PACA trust benefits under the\n       statute, [the seller] must prove that it strictly complied\n       with all the necessary statutory requirements. By not\n       offering evidence of an agreement in writing before the\n       transaction was entered into, [the seller] fails to meet\n       its burden of proof that it strictly complied with the\n       statute.\n\n114 B.R. at 338 (citing In re Lombardo, 106 B.R. 593\n(Bankr. E.D. Mo. 1989)). Thus, the court implicitly held\nthat the writing requirement is a precondition to eligibility\nas a trust beneficiary with which sellers must comply\nstrictly.\n\nAs discussed above, under our reading of the statute and\nthe regulations, the plain language does not support the\nresult reached by these cases. Guided as we must by the\n\n                               21\n\fplain language, we therefore find them unpersuasive.\nMoreover, a departure from the plain meaning of PACA is\nnot warranted because we find no extraordinary showing of\ncongressional intent otherwise in the legislative history. On\nthe contrary, the legislative history supports our reading of\nPACA and its regulations. Like the statute and the\nregulations, the legislative history explicitly refers to two\nrequirements for an unpaid supplier to qualify for trust\nbenefits: (1) that the seller notify the buyer of its intention\nto preserve its rights and (2) that an agreement to extend\nthe payment period not be beyond a reasonable time. See,\ne.g., H.R. Rep. No. 98-543, at 4 (1983), reprinted in 1984\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 407-08 (\"[T]he unpaid seller must accept\nthe burden to preserve the trust by notifying both the\nSecretary and the commission merchant, dealer or broker\nwithin 30 days after expiration of the prompt payment date\nor date on which a payment instrument has been\ndishonored, or the trust benefits will be lost.\"); id. at 7,\nreprinted in 1984 U.S.C.A.A.N. at 410 (\"[T]he committee\ndoes not intend the trust to apply to any credit transaction\nthat extends beyond a reasonable period. . . . [T]he\nsecretary is required to establish, through rulemaking, the\ntime by which, the parties to a transaction must agree\npayment on a transaction must be made, to qualify it for\ncoverage under the trust. An agreement for payment after\nsuch time will not be eligible to receive the benefits of the\ntrust.\"); 49 Fed. Reg. 45735, 45739 (1984) (\"The legislation\nis clear that an absolute precondition to pursuing trust\nassets held by a defaulting buyer or receiver is thefiling of\na written notice by the seller, supplier or agent after a\nfailure to pay within the prescribed periods has elapsed.\").\n\nFinally, we reject CHR's argument that requiring strict\ncompliance with the writing requirement, such that a seller\nloses it right to statutory benefits if an agreement to extend\nthe payment term is not reduced to writing, furthers the\npurposes of the statutory scheme. According to CHR,\ninterpreting the writing requirement as a precondition to\nreceiving trust benefits furthers the purposes of PACA by\nconstruing the trust to protect only those sellers who\nconduct their business in such a manner that complies\nwith PACA and encourages prompt payment. Thus, CHR\nurges that \"permitting sellers to orally extend payment\n\n                               22\n\fterms without adverse effect on trust eligibility would result\nin, and in fact already resulted in, practices by sellers\nwhich are in direct contravention of the PACA and its\npurpose.\" Br. at 23.\n\nPACA makes a buyer's failure to tender prompt payment\na violation, but it does not make a seller's failure to\ndemand prompt payment a violation. After all, PACA does\nnot preclude a seller from agreeing in writing to a payment\nterm beyond 30 days, but only disqualifies such a seller\nfrom participating in the trust.12 See 7 C.F.R. SS 46.2\n(aa)(11), 46.46(e)(2).\n\nWe recognize that, in instances such as the one\npresented here, our interpretation places those sellers who\nreduce to writing agreements to extend payment terms in\nno better position than those who do not. Nevertheless,\nbecause Congress established the PACA trust to protect\nunpaid sellers against buyers' failure to make prompt\npayment and their subordination of the sellers' claim to\nsecured creditors, we believe that our interpretation\nfurthers the statutory purpose. The primary purpose of the\nstatute was to protect unpaid sellers vis-a-vis secured\ncreditors, not to prefer certain unpaid sellers over others.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the district\ncourt's order denying CHR's motion to exclude Idahoan and\nAlsum from the universe of those qualified to receive trust\nbenefits in this case.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12. In urging this court not to follow Hull, CHR argues that the court\nfailed to sanction sellers who do not conduct their business in accord\nwith PACA's prompt payment requirements. In particular, CHR\nchallenges the Hull court's conclusion that a buyer who orally agrees to\nextend a payment term thereby makes an arrangement to violate PACA\nwithout the corresponding recognition that the seller necessarily makes\nthe same arrangement. According to CHR, the sanction for sellers who\nmake an arrangement to violate PACA by orally agreeing to an extended\npayment term is the forfeit of its trust benefits. We reject this argument\nfor the reasons discussed above.\n\n                               23\n\fA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               24\n\f",

INTRODUCTION\n\nC.H. Robinson Company (\"CHR\") appeals from the district\ncourt's order of November 7, 1997, denying its motion to\nexclude certain suppliers of perishable agricultural\ncommodities (\"produce\") from the universe of unpaid\nsuppliers entitled to recover benefits under the statutory\ntrust created by the Perishable Agricultural Commodities\nAct, 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c). CHR intervened in this action filed\nby Idahoan Fresh (\"Idahoan\") against Advantage Produce,\nInc. (\"Advantage\") to enforce the trust and challenged\nIdahoan's proposed schedule of qualified claimants under\nthe trust.\n\nThe district court had jurisdiction pursuant to 7 U.S.C.\nS 499e(c)(5). We have jurisdiction over the district court's\ninterlocutory order denying the exclusion of Idahoan and\nAlsum Produce, Inc. (\"Alsum\") as qualified beneficiaries\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. S 1292(b) as the district court\ncertified the order of November 7, 1997, for immediate\n\n                                  2\n\fappeal and we granted CHR's Petition for Permission to\nAppeal.\n\nII. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\nA. Statutory and Regulatory Framework of Perishabl e\nAgricultural Commodities Act of 1930\n\nWe begin with a brief overview of the Perishable\nAgricultural Commodities Act (\"PACA\"). In 1930, Congress\nenacted PACA to promote fair trading practices in the\nproduce industry. See 7 U.S.C. S 499a et seq.; Consumers\nProduce Co. v. Volante Wholesale Produce, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1374</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1377 (3d Cir. 1993). In particular, Congress intended\nPACA to protect small farmers and growers who were\nvulnerable to the practices of financially irresponsible\nbuyers.1 See Hull Co. v. Hauser's Foods, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555120\"><a href=\"/opinion/555120/hull-company-and-j-j-distributing-co-v-hausers-foods-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">777</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n780 (8th Cir. 1991). Under PACA, it is unlawful for buyers\nof produce, inter alia, to fail to make prompt payment for a\nshipment of produce. See 7 U.S.C. S 499b(4). A buyer's\nfailure to tender prompt payment triggers civil liability and\nthe possible revocation of the buyer's PACA license required\nby 7 U.S.C. S 499c. See 7 U.S.C. SS 499e(a), 449h(a).\nPrompt payment is defined by regulations which apply\nunless the parties agree otherwise in writing prior to the\ntransaction. See 7 C.F.R. S 46.2(aa).\n\nIn 1984, Congress amended PACA to protect further\ncertain unpaid suppliers2 of produce by including a\nstatutory trust provision which provides an additional\nremedy for sellers against a buyer failing to make prompt\npayment. See P.L. 98-273; H.R. Rep. No. 98-543, at 2\n(1983), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 405, 406. Prior to\nthis amendment, unpaid produce suppliers were unsecured\ncreditors vulnerable to the buyers' practice of granting\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. The statute and regulations speak in terms of \"commission merchant,\ndealer and broker.\" See 7 U.S.C. S 499a et seq. For ease of reference, we\nrefer to these participants as \"buyers.\"\n\n2. The statute and regulations use the terms \"supplier, seller, or agent.\"\nThis opinion refers to the these participants interchangeably as suppliers\nor sellers.\n\n                               3\n\fother creditors a security interest in their inventory and\naccounts receivable. See Tom Lange Co. v. Lombardo Fruit\n& Produce Co. (In re Lombardo Fruit & Produce Co.), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"659377\"><a href=\"/opinion/659377/in-re-lombardo-fruit-and-produce-company-debtor-tom-lange-company-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">806</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 808-09 (8th Cir. 1994) (citing H.R. Rep. No. 98-543, at\n3 (1983), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 405, 407). Under\nthe 1984 provision, a buyer's produce, products derived\nfrom that produce, and the proceeds gained therefrom are\nheld in a non-segregated, floating trust for the benefit of\nunpaid suppliers who have met the applicable statutory\nrequirements. See 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c); 7 C.F.R. S 46.46(b).\nThus, the provision gives certain unpaid sellers of produce\nan interest in the PACA trust assets superior to that of a\nperfected, secured creditor. See Consumers Produce, 16\nF.3d at 1379. In a 1995 amendment to PACA, which we\ndiscuss below, Congress made procedural changes in the\ntrust fund provisions. See P.L. 104-48,S 6, 7 U.S.C.\nS 499e(c)(4).\n\nTo enforce its rights under the statutory trust, a qualified\nbeneficiary may file a claim in the district court\nimmediately upon the buyer's failure to tender prompt\npayment. See 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(5). A qualified unpaid seller\nremains entitled to benefits until paid in full. See 7 C.F.R.\nS 46.46(c)(1). A seller eligible for the statutory trust benefits\nmust preserve its rights by satisfying a notice requirement\nby either sending notice to the buyer within 30 days of a\npayment default or, as provided in the 1995 amendment to\nPACA, including a statutory statement referencing the trust\non its invoices. See 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(3), (4); 7 C.F.R.\nS 46.46(c), (f). While a seller may agree in writing to a\npayment period other than that defined in the regulations\nas prompt, an unpaid seller loses its right to participate in\nthe trust if it agrees in writing to extend the payment period\nbeyond 30 days. See 7 C.F.R. S 46.46(e)(2). The issue\npresented by this appeal is whether a seller also forfeits its\nright to participate in the PACA trust if it fails to reduce to\nwriting an agreement to extend the payment term.\n\nB. Current Dispute\n\nOver a period of several months, Advantage purchased\nproduce from Idahoan, CHR, Alsum, O.P. Murphy & Sons\n(\"Murphy\"), and Powerhouse Produce, L.L.C.\n\n                               4\n\f(\"Powerhouse\"). The details of these transactions are not in\ndispute.3\n\nIn a series of transactions from August 7, 1996, through\nDecember 28, 1996, Idahoan sold a total of $116,684.26\nworth of produce on credit to Advantage. See app. 9.4 All of\nIdahoan's invoices to Advantage contain the language\nrequired under 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(4), the 1995 PACA\namendment, to notify the buyer that the seller intends to\npreserve its trust claim against the buyer. Idahoan and\nAdvantage did not enter into a written agreement extending\nthe payment term which, in this case, in the absence of a\nwritten agreement altering the term, is ten days. See 7\nC.F.R. S 46.2(aa)(5). However, William Carson, president of\nAdvantage, alleges that they had an oral agreement\nextending the payment term to 20 days. Additionally, 28 of\nthe 30 outstanding invoices issued by Idahoan to\nAdvantage stated \"PAYMENT TERMS: Net 20 days.\" The\nremaining two invoices contain no payment term.\n\nAlsum sold, on credit, a total of $10,708.00 worth of\nproduce to Advantage in two transactions on October 9 and\n24, 1996. Alsum and Advantage did not enter into a written\nagreement extending the payment term. As with Idahoan,\nCarson claims that Alsum and Advantage had an oral\nagreement to extend the term, though in Alsum's case the\nextended term was 15 rather than 20 days.\nNotwithstanding the oral agreement, both of Alsum's\nunpaid invoices state \"PAYMENT TERMS: NET 10.\" Both\ninvoices also contain the statutory language as provided in\nthe 1995 PACA amendment notifying Advantage that Alsum\nintended to preserve its PACA trust claim.\n\nCHR sold $36,004.80 worth of produce to Advantage\npursuant to their written agreement to extend the payment\nterm to 30 days. CHR's invoices for these sales included a\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. Because there seems to be no dispute that Murphy and Powerhouse\nare qualified PACA trust beneficiaries, we need not be concerned with\nthe details of their transactions with Advantage. Our discussion of the\nfacts therefore is limited to Advantage's transactions with Alsum,\nIdahoan, and CHR.\n\n4. Citations to the appendix refer to the tab number because the pages\nof the Appendix are not numbered continuously.\n\n                               5\n\fpayment term of 30 days as well as the statutory language\nrequired to preserve its interest in the PACA trust. See app.\n5.\n\nAdvantage failed to pay Idahoan, Alsum, and CHR the\namounts due on these outstanding invoices. On February\n10, 1997, Idahoan filed a complaint against Advantage and\nits officers, William Carson and William Carson III, for\ndamages and injunctive relief alleging violations of PACA\nbased upon Advantage's failure to pay its invoices and\nbreach of the statutory trust. The district court issued a\ntemporary restraining order on February 11, 1997,\nenjoining the defendants from further dissipating the\nconstructive trust imposed by 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c). On\nFebruary 20, 1997, Idahoan and Advantage filed a\nStipulated Order for Preliminary Injunction which stated a\nprocedure for identifying all of Advantage's qualified and\nunpaid PACA trust creditors.\n\nCHR intervened as a party plaintiff in the action on May\n27, 1997. See app. 5. On June 2, 1997, Idahoan and\nAdvantage filed a Joint Status Report and Motion for an\nOrder for the Distribution of PACA Trust Proceeds (\"Joint\nMotion\") identifying the following universe of qualified PACA\ntrust creditors:\n\n       Idahoan                 $ 116,684.26\n       CHR                        36,004.80\n       Murphy                      4,300.00\n       Alsum                      10,708.00\n       Powerhouse                  4,868.00\n                               ____________\n                               $ 172,565.06\n\nApp. 6.\n\nAlthough CHR was a party to the action at the time\nAdvantage and Idahoan filed the Joint Motion, they did not\nconsult CHR or invite CHR to join in the Joint Motion. On\nJune 5, 1997, CHR filed an objection to the Joint Motion\nand served discovery requests upon Advantage seeking\ndocuments which established the alleged qualified status of\nthe creditors set forth in the Joint Motion. See app. 7. CHR\nthen filed a Motion to Exclude Alsum and Idahoan from the\nuniverse of qualified PACA trust creditors on the grounds\n\n                                6\n\fthat they failed to comply with the statute and regulations.\nIn particular, CHR argued that Idahoan and Alsum orally\nagreed to extend the payment term beyond the ten-day\nperiod established in the regulations, and they were,\ntherefore, not qualified PACA trust creditors because the\nagreements were not reduced to writing prior to the\ntransaction. See app. 9.\n\nAt the time of briefing on this appeal, the total amount of\navailable PACA trust funds was approximately $45,000.00.\nSee Br. for Appellant at 5. If Idahoan and Alsum are\nexcluded from the universe of qualified trust beneficiaries,\nthe total qualified and unpaid trust claims would be\n$45,172.80. Thus, their exclusion would result in payment\nvirtually in full, rather than a small pro-rata portion, to the\nqualified PACA trust creditors, CHR, Powerhouse, and\nMurphy.\n\nOn November 7, 1997, the district court issued an order\ndenying CHR's Motion to Exclude Idahoan and Alsum citing\n\"the reasons stated of record at the argument of the\nmotion.\" App. 12. Following argument on CHR's motion to\nexclude, the district court stated that an oral agreement to\nextend a payment term is totally ineffective and, provided\nthat the supplier complies with the notice provisions of the\nstatute, it is a qualified PACA trust beneficiary. See Br. for\nAppellee, Attach. at 11-12.5 Thereafter, CHR filed a motion\nfor reconsideration or, in the alternative, certification\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. S 1292(b). On December 1, 1997, the\ndistrict court certified the November 7, 1997 order, for\nimmediate appeal, the controlling question of law being\nwhether Idahoan and Alsum \"perfected their trust claims\nunder PACA.\" On February 19, 1998, we granted CHR's\nPetition for Permission to Appeal. See app. 1, 14.\n\nIII. DISCUSSION\n\nCHR contends that the district court erred in finding that\nIdahoan and Alsum were qualified to receive statutory\nbenefits under PACA. According to CHR, the plain\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. A partial transcript of the argument is included as an Attachment to\nthe Brief for the Appellee, Idahoan.\n\n                               7\n\flanguage, legislative history, and purposes of the statute\nand regulations lead to the conclusion that a seller forfeits\nits right to PACA trust benefits if it orally agrees to extend\nthe payment term beyond that established in the\nregulations as prompt, in this case, ten days.\n\nThere is no dispute that Idahoan and Alsum did not\nreduce to writing their agreements to extend the payment\nperiod in their transactions with Advantage. There is also\nno dispute that Idahoan's and Alsum's invoices properly\nnotified Advantage of their intent to preserve their right to\nstatutory benefits under 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(4). Thus, as we\nhave indicated, this appeal raises the following issue\nregarding the proper interpretation of PACA: whether an\nagreement to extend the payment term beyond the time\ndefined by the regulations as prompt must be in writing in\norder for the seller to qualify for the benefits of the PACA\ntrust. Because this appeal concerns solely the legal issue of\nthe proper interpretation of statutes and regulations, we\nexercise de novo review over the district court's order. See\nShell Oil Co. v. Babbit, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746437\"><a href=\"/opinion/746437/shell-oil-company-v-bruce-babbitt-the-united-states-department-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 175 (3d Cir. 1997).\n\nWe initially point out that certain general precepts guide\nus on this appeal.

The statute and\n\n                               9\n\fregulations refer, in numerous instances, to the\nrequirement that an agreement to extend the prompt\npayment period be in writing. This appeal requires us to\ndetermine whether that requirement relates only to the\nenforceability of such an agreement or is a precondition to\na seller's qualification for trust benefits. We turn first to the\nsection of the statutory trust provision which refers to the\nwriting requirement.\n\nThe statutory trust provision provides that the produce,\nproducts derived from that produce, and any proceeds\ngained therefrom are held in trust by the buyer for the\nbenefit of unpaid sellers until such sellers are paid in full.\nSee 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(2). Two subsections condition this\nprovision by requiring an unpaid seller to preserve its rights\nto the trust benefits by notifying the buyer of its intent to\ndo so, 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(3), which we discussfirst, and 7\nU.S.C. S 499(c)(4), which we discuss below. In the context of\nestablishing this notice requirement, the statute refers to\nthe mandate that an agreement must be in writing. In\nparticular, the statute provides that\n\n       (3) The unpaid supplier . . . shall lose the benefits of\n       such trust unless such person has given written notice\n       of intent to preserve the benefits of the trust to the\n       [buyer] within thirty calendar days (i) after the\n       expiration of the time prescribed by which payment\n       must be made, as set forth in regulations issued by the\n       Secretary; [or] (ii) after expiration of such other time by\n       which payment must be made, as the parties have\n       expressly agreed to in writing before entering into the\n       transaction . . . . When the parties expressly agree to\n       a payment time period different from that established\n       by the Secretary, a copy of any such agreement shall\n       be filed in the records of each party to the transaction\n       and the terms of payment shall be disclosed on\n       invoices, accountings, and other documents relating to\n       the transaction.\n\n7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(3).6\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. Section 499e(c)(3) also provides that proper notice may be given within\n30 days after the seller receives notice that the payment instrument\npresented by the buyer had been dishonored. See 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(3).\nThe facts of the transactions in this case do not implicate this portion\nof\nthe statute.\n\n                               10\n\fAccording to CHR, the plain language of section\n499e(c)(3), in particular Congress's use of the term\"shall,\"\nunambiguously requires that an agreement to extend the\npayment term be in writing in order for the seller to\npreserve its PACA trust benefits. This reading overstates\nwhat the subsection requires. The statute provides that an\nunpaid seller \"shall lose the benefits of such trust unless\nsuch person has given written notice of intent to preserve the\nbenefits of such trust.\" 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(3) (emphasis\nadded). The remainder of that sentence establishes the time\nperiod in which such notice must be given. In the context\nof defining timely notification, the statute then provides\nthat agreements to extend payment terms must be in\nwriting and that parties shall maintain a copy of such an\nagreement and disclose the terms of the agreement on\ninvoices and other documents relating to the transaction.\nSee 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(3); see also 7 C.F.R. S 46.2(aa)(11).\n\nThus, Congress, using the verb \"shall,\" unambiguously\nintended that a seller timely notify the buyer of its intent to\npreserve its rights to PACA trust benefits. The plain and\nunambiguous language of the section does not provide,\nhowever, that a written agreement is a precondition of\nbeing entitled to the statutory trust benefits. Rather, the\nrequirement is relevant to assessing when prompt payment\nis due and therefore when notice is timely.\n\nThe plain language of the regulations supports this\nreading of the statute. The regulations first mention the\nwriting requirement in the context of defining prompt\npayment. As noted above, the regulations establish times\nfor prompt payment for various scenarios. See 7 C.F.R.\nS 46.2(aa)(1) - (10); 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(3). In this case, the\nregulations provide that, unless agreed otherwise in writing,\nprompt payment is defined as payment within ten days of\nthe buyer's acceptance of the produce. See 7 C.F.R.\nS 46.2(aa)(5). The regulations also provide that\n\n       [p]arties who elect to use different times of payment\n       than those set forth [herein] must reduce their\n       agreement to writing before entering into the\n       transaction and maintain a copy of the agreement for\n       their records. If they have so agreed, then payment\n       within the agreed upon time shall constitute `full\n\n                               11\n\f       payment promptly': Provided, That the party claiming\n       the existence of such an agreement for time of payment\n       shall have the burden of proving it.\n\n7 C.F.R. S 46.2(aa)(11). This section unambiguously\nrequires that an agreement to extend a payment term must\nbe in writing prior to the transaction.\n\nThe regulations concerning the statutory trust also refer\nto the writing requirement. In particular, the regulation\nprovides that\n\n       [w]hen a seller, supplier or agent who has met the\n       eligibility requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of\n       this section, transfers ownership, possession, or\n       control of goods to a commission merchant, dealer, or\n       broker, it automatically becomes eligible to participate\n       in the trust. Participants who preserve their rights to\n       benefits in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section\n       remain beneficiaries until they are paid in full.\n\n7 C.F.R. S 46.46(c)(1). Subsection (f) requires that the seller\nproperly notify the buyer of its intent to preserve its PACA\ntrust benefits. See 7 C.F.R. S 46.46(f).7 The \"eligibility\"\nrequirements of paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) provide the\nfollowing:\n\n       (e) Prompt payment and eligibility for trust benefits.\n\n       (1) The times for prompt accounting and prompt\n       payment are set out in S 46.2(z) and (aa). Parties who\n       elect to use different times for payment must reduce\n       their agreement to writing before entering into the\n       transaction and maintain a copy of their agreement for\n       their records, and the times of payment must be\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. This regulation refers to the writing requirement in the same context,\nand virtually to the same extent, as 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(3). In particular,\nthe regulation provides that a seller's notice of an intent to preserve\nthe\nright to PACA trust benefits is timely if given 30 days \"[a]fter\nexpiration\nof such other time by which payment must be made as the parties have\nexpressly agreed to in writing before entering into the transaction, but\nnot longer than [30 days].\" 7 C.F.R. S 46.46(f)(2)(ii). We therefore\nconclude that this section's reference to the writing requirement has the\nsame effect as that of 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(3) discussed above.\n\n                               12\n\f       disclosed on invoices, accountings, and other\n       documents relating to the transaction.\n\n       (2) The maximum time for payment for a shipment to\n       which a seller, supplier, or agent can agree and still\n       qualify for coverage under the trust is 30 days after\n       receipt and acceptance of the commodities as defined\n       in S 46.2(dd) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section.\n\n7 C.F.R. S 46.46(e). As in the statute, section (e)(1) of this\nregulation discusses the writing requirement in the context\nof defining prompt payment for a given transaction. Section\n(e)(2) explicitly provides that a seller is disqualified from\nreceiving trust benefits if it agrees to extend the payment\nterm longer than 30 days from the buyer's acceptance of\nthe produce. The existence of such an explicit\ndisqualification supports our view that the writing\nrequirement is not a prerequisite to eligibility to participate\nin the PACA trust.\n\nUnder CHR's view, these regulations establish eligibility\nrequirements separate from the notice requirement to\npreserve eligibility. CHR argues that the eligibility\nrequirements for sellers who agree to payment terms\nbeyond ten days are that such an agreement be reduced to\nwriting, those terms be included on all invoices regarding\nthe transaction, and that eligibility is lost if the parties\nagree to a payment term over 30 days. CHR asserts that\nthese prerequisites do not apply where there is not an\nagreement to extend a payment term. The plain language\ndoes not support this interpretation.\n\nThe plain language of the statute and regulations\nrequires that an agreement establishing a \"prompt\npayment\" period other than that established in the\nregulations must be in writing. The plain language also\nprovides that an unpaid seller loses its right to PACA trust\nbenefits if (1) it does not timely notify the buyer of its intent\nto preserve that right or (2) it agrees to a payment period\nbeyond 30 days. Because we liberally interpret PACA to\nfurther its remedial purposes of reducing the burden on\ncommerce and protecting unpaid sellers, we find that the\nwriting requirement relates to the enforceability of an\nagreement to extend a payment term, but does not\ndisqualify an unpaid seller from receiving trust benefits.\n\n                               13\n\fIdahoan and Alsum satisfied the notice requirement by\nincluding the requisite language on the face of their\ninvoices to Advantage, see 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(4), and neither\nparty agreed to a payment period over 30 days.8 Their\nfailure to reduce their oral agreements with respect to the\npayment term to writing does not disqualify them, and they\ntherefore are entitled to share in a pro-rata distribution of\nthe statutory trust res until they receive payment in full.\n\nIn so holding, we join the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Eighth Circuit, the only other court of appeals of\nwhich we are aware which has addressed the precise issue\npresented by this appeal, in concluding that a supplier's\nfailure to reduce to writing an agreement to extend the\npayment term does not disqualify that supplier as a PACA\ntrust beneficiary. See Hull, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555120\"><a href=\"/opinion/555120/hull-company-and-j-j-distributing-co-v-hausers-foods-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">777</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. In Hull, two\nunpaid wholesale distributors of produce, Hull & J.J.\nDistributing, instituted suit against a defunct retail grocery\nstore, Hauser's, to enforce their PACA trust rights. See id.\nat 778. Some of the retail store's assets were seized by one\nof the store's secured creditors, Gateway, who held\nperfected security interests in all of the store's assets and\ninventory. See id. at 778.\n\nIt was undisputed that Hull and J.J. Distributing\nsupplied Hauser's with produce over several years and that\nduring that time the two suppliers orally agreed to a\npayment period of 45 days and 30 days after delivery,\nrespectively. See id. Hull's invoices to Hauser indicated this\nas the payment period, while J.J. Distributing's invoices did\nnot indicate any payment term. See id.\n\nThe district court held that Hull and J.J. Distributing\nwere entitled to trust benefits for their unpaid invoices\nnotwithstanding the fact that they had not reduced their\npayment term extensions to writing. See id. at 779. Finding\nthat the two suppliers had given Hauser's sufficient\nnotification of their intent to preserve their PACA trust\nrights, the district court held that while the plain language\nof the statute makes oral agreements extending the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. We are not reaching the issue of what would happen if the oral\nextension provided for a payment period in excess of 30 days because\nthat situation is not before us in this case. See 7 C.F.R. S 46.46(e)(2).\n\n                               14\n\fpayment term unenforceable, it only disqualifies a supplier\nfrom trust benefits where the supplier enters into a written\nagreement to extend the payment term beyond 30 days. See\nid.\n\nThe court of appeals affirmed the district court,finding\nthat \"oral agreements have no effect on produce sellers'\ntrust protection.\" Id. at 781. According to the court, a buyer\nwho orally agrees to an extension of the payment term\nbeyond ten days makes an arrangement to violate PACA's\nprompt payment provision. See id. at 782. The court found\nthat\n\n       it would be incongruous to disregard oral agreements\n       for purposes of enforcing PACA but recognize them for\n       the purpose of voiding the sellers' protection under the\n       trust. Thus, notwithstanding the oral agreements, both\n       sellers retained the right to demand payment within\n       ten days and seek trust protection under PACA.\n\nId. at 782.9 In concluding its discussion of this issue, the\n\n(Text continued on page 17)\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9.

These two cases concern disputes between two different\nproduce suppliers and a single buyer. In both instances, the court held\nthat the unpaid seller was not entitled to PACA trust benefits. See 12\nF.3d at 809; 12 F.3d at 113.\n\nIn In re Lombardo I, although letters and the invoices indicated an\nextended payment period, there was no written agreement which\ncomplied with all respects of PACA and its regulations. See 12 F.3d at\n113. There was also evidence of an oral agreement to extend the\npayment term. In the absence of a valid written agreement under PACA\nto extend the payment term, the court first stated that it could not\nmeasure the timeliness of notice based upon the extended payment\nterm. See id. Then the court rejected the supplier's argument that its\nnotice to the buyer was within 30 days of the expiration of the payment\nperiod established in the regulations. The court held that\n\n       [t]he evidence in the record clearly demonstrates that the parties\n       had an agreement to extend the payment terms beyond the ten days\n\f15\n\f       in the regulations. Though this agreement is insufficient to\npreserve\n       Goldman's trust protection, it is a valid contract between the\n       parties. A predicate to the trust protection is the requirement\nthat\n       payment is delinquent; having agreed to extend the payment period\n       beyond ten days, it would be incongruous to permit Goldman to now\n       claim that no agreement existed and that payment was therefore\n       due within ten days.\n\nId. at 113 (citation omitted).\n\nIn making this statement, the In re Lombardo I court cited the opinion\nin Bowlin & Son, Inc. v. San Joaquin Food Serv., Inc. (In re San Joaquin\nFood Serv., Inc.), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579269\"><a href=\"/opinion/579269/in-re-san-joaquin-food-service-inc-debtor-bowlin-son-inc-v-san/\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">938</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 941 n.2 (9th Cir. 1992). Our reading of\nIn re San Joaquin suggests that the In re Lombardo I court may have\ncited it for a proposition In re San Joaquin did not state. Furthermore,\nIn re Lombardo I did not question Hull. In the circumstances, to the\nextent, if any, that the language in In re Lombardo I conflicts with Hull,\nwe find it unpersuasive.\n\nIn In re Lombardo II, the supplier and the buyer entered into a written\nagreement prior to the transaction to extend the payment term to 30\ndays. See 12 F.3d at 809. This agreement complied with PACA and its\nregulations in all respects. See id. Thereafter, the parties modified the\nagreement in writing in such a manner that no longer complied with\nPACA. See id. Although the court does not explain this subsequent\nwritten agreement or explicitly state in what manner it no longer\ncomplied with PACA, the opinion suggests that the agreement extended\nthe payment term beyond 30 days, for which PACA explicitly disqualifies\na seller as a trust beneficiary. The court found that, at that time, \"an\nagreement complying with PACA no longer existed. There being no\nwritten agreement complying with PACA, Lange is prohibited from\nclaiming PACA's trust protection.\" Id. at 807 (footnote omitted). The\ncourt\nfurther stated that\n\n        PACA imposes a trust upon the funds held by delinquent\n        purchasers if a written agreement required payment within thirty\n        days of delivery. Thus, at the time trust protection is claimed,\nthere\n        must exist a valid written agreement complying with PACA's terms.\n\nId. at 809-10.\n\nThis language could be read to imply that without a written agreement\nto extend the payment term, the seller is not entitled to trust benefits.\nAlthough we believe that such a result would be incorrect in light of the\nexplicit holding to the contrary in Hull, we note the potential conflict\nas\n\f16\n\fcourt also noted that a liberal construction of the statute is\nappropriate because it is remedial legislation. See id. at 782.10\n\nCHR argues that Hull is not applicable to this case\nbecause it was decided prior to Congress's 1995\namendment to the PACA statutory trust which, it argues,\nchanged the statutory landscape. In 1995, Congress added\nsection 499e(c)(4) which provides, as an alternative to the\npost-delinquency methods outlined in subsection 3, an\ninvoicing method of notifying the buyer of a seller's intent\nto preserve its right to trust benefits. See 7 U.S.C.\nS 499e(c)(4). According to CHR, because there was no\ninvoice-notification method under PACA at the time the\ncourt decided Hull, the payment terms were crucial to\ndetermining the timeliness of the notice. CHR asserts that\nthe rationale of Hull is inapplicable to this case where the\ntimeliness of the notice is irrelevant because the sellers\ncomplied with the invoice-notification provision. In essence,\nCHR asserts that our interpretation renders the writing\nrequirement meaningless in cases such as this where the\nsupplier invokes invoice notification.\n\nThe purpose of the 1995 amendment was to remove the\nexpense to the United States Department of Agriculture in\nadministering the trust provisions. See H.R. Rep. No. 104-\n207, at 9 (1995), reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 453, 456.\nUnder the 1995 amendment, a seller may satisfy the notice\nrequirement by including on its regular invoicing\ndocuments a statutory statement indicating the intent to\npreserve its trust rights. See id. An invoice which serves as\nnotice to preserve a seller's trust rights also must include\n\"[t]he terms of the payment if they differ from prompt\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nwe are unsure of the court's intentions. Of course, the court may have\nmeant nothing more than that the trust protection was lost because the\npayment period was extended in writing beyond 30 days contrary to 7\nC.F.R. S 46.46(e)(2). If so, In re Lombardo II is not inconsistent with\nHull\nwhich involved an oral extension by one seller to 45 days.\n\n10. We recognize that one of the suppliers in Hull agreed to a payment\nperiod of 45 days. As we have indicated, we are not reaching the issue\nof what would happen if the oral extension provided for a period in\nexcess of 30 days. See n.8, supra. The Hull court did not distinguish\nbetween a 30-day and 45-day period.\n\n                               17\n\fpayment set out in section 46.2(z) and (aa) of this part, and\nthe parties have expressly agreed to such terms in writing\nbefore the affected transactions occur.\" 7 C.F.R.\nS 46.46(f)(3)(ii). The writing requirement therefore is not\nrendered superfluous under our interpretation of the\nstatute where the seller invokes the invoice-notification\nprovision. Rather, a written agreement to extend the\npayment period gives rise to the obligation to include the\npayment term on the invoice which serves as notice of the\nseller's intent to preserve it PACA rights.\n\nDistrict courts in other circuits have followed, either\nimplicitly or explicitly, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth\nCircuit's approach in Hull.

In each of these cases, there was\nno evidence of a prior written agreement to extend the\npayment term, yet the courts held that the unpaid sellers\nwere entitled to PACA trust benefits if they notified the\nbuyers within 40 days after the delivery of the produce,\nwhich is 30 days after the expiration of the ten-day prompt\npayment period established by the regulations.\n\nIn addition, at least one court has described the PACA\nwriting requirement for agreements to extend payment\nterms as being in the nature of a statute of frauds. See\nDebruyn Produce Co. v. Richmond Produce Co. (In re\nRichmond Produce Co.), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1941603\"><a href=\"/opinion/1941603/in-re-richmond-produce-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 374 (Bankr. N.D.\nCal. 1990). In In re Richmond, the court was faced with the\n\n                               18\n\fissue of whether certain notices were timely to preserve the\nsellers' rights to statutory trust benefits. Finding that\ncertain letters satisfied the writing requirement and\ntherefore validly extended the payment term, the court\nfound that the notices sent were timely because they were\nsent within 30 days of the expiration of the extended\npayment period. In so holding, the court commented that\n\n       the purpose of the writing requirement is to preclude\n       uncertainties as to the applicable payment terms and\n       the resulting deadline for filing a PACA notice. Thus,\n       the provision at issue is in the nature of a statute of\n       frauds and serves the same purpose. This conclusion is\n       supported by the statutory requirement that both\n       parties maintain a copy of the agreement in their\n       records and that the terms of the payment be disclosed\n       on `invoices. . . .'\n\nId. at 374 (citation omitted). Thus, the court viewed the\nwriting requirement as relevant to assessing when prompt\npayment is due and not as a precondition to preserving\nstatutory trust benefits.\n\nCHR urges this court to join those courts which have\nrequired strict compliance with the preconditions of the\nstatutory trust.11 See, e.g., Bowlin & Son, Inc. v. San\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11. Most of the case law considering whether strict or substantial\ncompliance is necessary addresses the notice requirement.

But, this case presents the\nissue of whether the writing requirement is a precondition\nto qualification as a PACA trust beneficiary. Only if we\nanswered that question positively would we be required to\nreach the issue of whether strict or substantial compliance\nwith that requirement was necessary to preserve properly\nan unpaid seller's right to receive benefits. Having found\nthat it is not and is rather only relevant to determining\nwhat constitutes prompt payment in a given transaction,\nwe need not decide today whether strict compliance with\nthe requirements of PACA trust eligibility is required.\n\nNonetheless, we recognize that these cases support the\ninterpretation urged by CHR. Although the Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit has not addressed explicitly the\nprecise issue presented by this appeal, its ruling on a\nsimilar issue suggests a conclusion other than the one we\nreach today. In In re San Joaquin the court held that a\nproduce supplier was not entitled to PACA trust benefits\nwhere the invoices it issued to the buyer did not contain\nthe payment term agreed upon by the two parties in writing\nprior to the transaction. See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579269\"><a href=\"/opinion/579269/in-re-san-joaquin-food-service-inc-debtor-bowlin-son-inc-v-san/\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">938</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\nIn In re San Joaquin, there was no dispute that the\nsupplier gave the buyer timely notice of its intent to\npreserve its interest in the trust or that the agreement to\nextend the payment term was in writing.

Because there is no dispute that Alsum and\nIdahoan complied with the invoice-notice provision, we need not address\nthis issue today.\n\n                                20\n\fits rights to the PACA trust. As discussed above, 7 U.S.C.\nS 499e(c)(3) requires that \"[w]hen the parties expressly agree\nto a payment time period different from that established by\nthe Secretary, a copy of any such agreement shall befiled\nin the record of each party to the transaction and the terms\nof payment shall be disclosed on invoices, accountings, and\nother documents relating to the transaction.\" (emphasis\nadded). The In re San Joaquin court found that the\nprovision relating to the disclosure of the payment terms on\ninvoices was a requirement to preserve a supplier's trust\nrights. See id. at 940. The court found that because this\nwas a clear mandate of Congress as expressed in\nunambiguous statutory terms, sellers must comply strictly\nwith it to receive trust benefits. See id.\n\nIt is possible that the Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit also would hold that the requirement of a written\nagreement to extend the payment term beyond the period\nprescribed in the regulations is a prerequisite to preserving\na supplier's rights to PACA trust benefits. After all, that\nrequirement is in the same clause in 7 U.S.C. S 499e(c)(3)\nas the requirement that extended payment terms be\nindicated on invoices.\n\nIn re John DeFrancesco & Sons, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1535794\"><a href=\"/opinion/1535794/in-re-john-defrancesco-sons-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, also\nis inconsistent with the interpretation of PACA that we have\nadopted. The court held that\n\n       in order to preserve its PACA trust benefits under the\n       statute, [the seller] must prove that it strictly complied\n       with all the necessary statutory requirements. By not\n       offering evidence of an agreement in writing before the\n       transaction was entered into, [the seller] fails to meet\n       its burden of proof that it strictly complied with the\n       statute.\n\n114 B.R. at 338 (citing In re Lombardo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1919406\"><a href=\"/opinion/1919406/in-re-lombardo-fruit-produce/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Bankr. E.D. Mo. 1989)). Thus, the court implicitly held\nthat the writing requirement is a precondition to eligibility\nas a trust beneficiary with which sellers must comply\nstrictly.\n\nAs discussed above, under our reading of the statute and\nthe regulations, the plain language does not support the\nresult reached by these cases. Guided as we must by the\n\n                               21\n\fplain language, we therefore find them unpersuasive.\nMoreover, a departure from the plain meaning of PACA is\nnot warranted because we find no extraordinary showing of\ncongressional intent otherwise in the legislative history. On\nthe contrary, the legislative history supports our reading of\nPACA and its regulations. Like the statute and the\nregulations, the legislative history explicitly refers to two\nrequirements for an unpaid supplier to qualify for trust\nbenefits: (1) that the seller notify the buyer of its intention\nto preserve its rights and (2) that an agreement to extend\nthe payment period not be beyond a reasonable time. See,\ne.g., H.R. Rep. No. 98-543, at 4 (1983), reprinted in 1984\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 407-08 (\"[T]he unpaid seller must accept\nthe burden to preserve the trust by notifying both the\nSecretary and the commission merchant, dealer or broker\nwithin 30 days after expiration of the prompt payment date\nor date on which a payment instrument has been\ndishonored, or the trust benefits will be lost.\"); id. at 7,\nreprinted in 1984 U.S.C.A.A.N. at 410 (\"[T]he committee\ndoes not intend the trust to apply to any credit transaction\nthat extends beyond a reasonable period. . . . [T]he\nsecretary is required to establish, through rulemaking, the\ntime by which, the parties to a transaction must agree\npayment on a transaction must be made, to qualify it for\ncoverage under the trust. An agreement for payment after\nsuch time will not be eligible to receive the benefits of the\ntrust.\"); 49 Fed. Reg. 45735, 45739 (1984) (\"The legislation\nis clear that an absolute precondition to pursuing trust\nassets held by a defaulting buyer or receiver is thefiling of\na written notice by the seller, supplier or agent after a\nfailure to pay within the prescribed periods has elapsed.\").\n\nFinally, we reject CHR's argument that requiring strict\ncompliance with the writing requirement, such that a seller\nloses it right to statutory benefits if an agreement to extend\nthe payment term is not reduced to writing, furthers the\npurposes of the statutory scheme. According to CHR,\ninterpreting the writing requirement as a precondition to\nreceiving trust benefits furthers the purposes of PACA by\nconstruing the trust to protect only those sellers who\nconduct their business in such a manner that complies\nwith PACA and encourages prompt payment. Thus, CHR\nurges that \"permitting sellers to orally extend payment\n\n                               22\n\fterms without adverse effect on trust eligibility would result\nin, and in fact already resulted in, practices by sellers\nwhich are in direct contravention of the PACA and its\npurpose.\" Br. at 23.\n\nPACA makes a buyer's failure to tender prompt payment\na violation, but it does not make a seller's failure to\ndemand prompt payment a violation. After all, PACA does\nnot preclude a seller from agreeing in writing to a payment\nterm beyond 30 days, but only disqualifies such a seller\nfrom participating in the trust.12 See 7 C.F.R. SS 46.2\n(aa)(11), 46.46(e)(2).\n\nWe recognize that, in instances such as the one\npresented here, our interpretation places those sellers who\nreduce to writing agreements to extend payment terms in\nno better position than those who do not. Nevertheless,\nbecause Congress established the PACA trust to protect\nunpaid sellers against buyers' failure to make prompt\npayment and their subordination of the sellers' claim to\nsecured creditors, we believe that our interpretation\nfurthers the statutory purpose. The primary purpose of the\nstatute was to protect unpaid sellers vis-a-vis secured\ncreditors, not to prefer certain unpaid sellers over others.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the district\ncourt's order denying CHR's motion to exclude Idahoan and\nAlsum from the universe of those qualified to receive trust\nbenefits in this case.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12. In urging this court not to follow Hull, CHR argues that the court\nfailed to sanction sellers who do not conduct their business in accord\nwith PACA's prompt payment requirements. In particular, CHR\nchallenges the Hull court's conclusion that a buyer who orally agrees to\nextend a payment term thereby makes an arrangement to violate PACA\nwithout the corresponding recognition that the seller necessarily makes\nthe same arrangement. According to CHR, the sanction for sellers who\nmake an arrangement to violate PACA by orally agreeing to an extended\npayment term is the forfeit of its trust benefits. We reject this argument\nfor the reasons discussed above.\n\n                               23\n\fA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               24\n\f</pre>",
