The\nconvening authority approved the sentence as adjudged and credited appellant with\nsixty-three days of confinement.\n\n      This case is before us pursuant to Article 66, UCMJ. Appellant raises three\nassignments of error and one supplemental assignment of error. We granted\nappellant’s request for oral argument on two of his assignments of error and heard\nargument on 20 October 2015. 3 As appellant’s first assignment of error merits\ndiscussion and relief, his remaining assignments of error are rendered moot.\n\n                                  BACKGROUND\n\n       Appellant was stationed at Fort Irwin, California. On several occasions\nbetween November 2012 and April 2013, appellant followed minor girls walking on\npost in his car, and then approached them and talked to them. In November 2012,\nappellant drove up to ACA, a fourteen-year-old girl walking along the road, rolled\ndown his window, and asked her for her phone number. After ACA said, “no” and\ntried to walk away, appellant parked and asked her to join him. When she did, they\nspoke and ACA told him she was fourteen. Appellant subsequently took her cell\nphone, entered his phone number in it, and called himself so he would have her\nphone number. The next day, appellant sent ACA a text asking if she wanted to have\nsex with him. 4\n\n\n1\n  The provision reads, “[e]very person who annoys or molests any child under 18\nyears of age shall be punished by a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars\n($5,000), by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or by both the\nfine and imprisonment.”\n2\n  After appellant pleaded not guilty to one specification of wrongfully annoying and\nmolesting a minor in violation of Cal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1) assimilated under\nArticle 134, UCMJ, and to one specification of stalking in violation of Article 120a,\nUCMJ, the military judge dismissed these two specifications in accordance with the\nterms of the pretrial agreement.\n3\n We note with appreciation the high level of oral and written advocacy on behalf of\nboth parties in this case.\n4\n This text message, which constituted a lewd act upon a child, was the basis for the\nSpecification of Charge III.\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\fRODRIGUEZ — ARMY 20130577\n\n       On the morning of 21 February 2013, appellant approached two other girls,\nEMM and KMT—who were thirteen years and fourteen years old, respectively—in\nhis car as they were walking to the Fort Irwin Middle School. He rolled down his\ncar window, said, “hey,” and told them, “you look good today.” The girls then tried\nto ignore appellant and continued to walk to school. At that point, appellant circled\naround the block so he could continue following them in his car. 5\n\n       On the morning of 22 February 2013, appellant was in his car and saw EMM\nas she was walking to the home of KMT before school. He waved to EMM a couple\nof times. When she raised her phone to take a picture of his license plate, he\nreversed his car so she could not see or take a picture of his license plate. Appellant\nthen stopped his car and EMM walked away. 6\n\n       On the same day, 22 February 2013, appellant was in his car and saw a twelve\nyear old girl, ANC, on the way to Fort Irwin Middle School. He pulled up to her and\nasked her, “has anyone ever told you, you look gorgeous?” 7\n\n        Just over a week later, on 1 March 2013, one of the teachers at Fort Irwin\nMiddle School was told by two students that they had seen appellant driving nearby.\nThe teacher then got in her car and followed appellant until he pulled over. After a\nbrief conversation in which appellant asked the teacher if she knew him, appellant\ndrove off. Five days later, on 6 March 2013, appellant’s company commander\nordered him to stay away from all schools, playgrounds, youth centers, and day care\nfacilities on Fort Irwin and to have no verbal or physical contact with any minor\nfemales other than his stepdaughter.\n\n        Despite that “no contact” order, on 13 April 2013, appellant approached two\ngirls, a twelve year old, TSH, and a thirteen year old, MGV, walking back to one of\nthe girls’ homes from the on-post commissary. Appellant drove up to them and\nasked them for their phone numbers. They declined and then ran away from\n\n\n5\n This conduct, which constituted wrongfully annoying and molesting the girls in\nviolation of Cal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1), was the basis for Specifications 2 and 3\nof Charge I.\n6\n This conduct, which constituted wrongfully annoying and molesting the girl in\nviolation of Cal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1), was the basis for Specification 4 of\nCharge I.\n7\n This conduct, which constituted wrongfully annoying and molesting the girl in\nviolation of Cal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1), was the basis for Specification 5 of\nCharge I.\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\fRODRIGUEZ — ARMY 20130577\n\nappellant’s car. Shortly thereafter, the girls saw appellant drive through the\nneighborhood. TSH tried to see if she could get appellant’s license plate number but\ndid not succeed because, once appellant saw her running after his car, he accelerated\nand left the area. 8\n\n      At trial, the military judge advised appellant that the offense described in Cal.\nPenal Code § 647.6(a)(1), the basis of Specifications 2-7 of Charge I,\n\n             is not preempted by Article 120a, stalking, in that it [the\n             California statute] prohibits conduct less severe than that\n             required by the stalking article, which contemplates a fear\n             of death or bodily harm. California Criminal Jury\n             Instructions 1122 [the jury instructions applicable to the\n             California statute] describes annoying or molesting a child\n             as requiring that, first, you engaged in conduct directed at\n             a child; second, a normal person, without hesitation,\n             would have been disturbed, irritated, offended or injured\n             by your conduct; third, your conduct was motivated by an\n             unnatural and abnormal sexual interest in the child; and\n             fourth, that the child was under the age of 18 years at the\n             time of your conduct.\n\n             It is not necessary that the child actually be irritated or\n             disturbed. It’s also not necessary that the child actually\n             be touched. It is not a defense that the child may have\n             consented to the act.\n\n      In pleading guilty to Specifications 2-7 of Charge I, appellant admitted the\nelements of Cal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1) accurately described his actions. He also\nadmitted that the offenses occurred at Fort Irwin, California, a place under exclusive\nor concurrent federal jurisdiction, that Cal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1) was properly\nassimilated into federal law by 18 U.S.C. § 13, and finally that, under the\ncircumstances, his conduct was both to the prejudice of good order and discipline in\nthe armed forces and of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.\n\n\n\n\n8\n  This conduct, which constituted wrongfully annoying and molesting the girls in\nviolation of Cal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1) also constituted failure to obey the lawful\norder of appellant’s company commander to have no verbal or physical contact with\nminor females and was simultaneously the basis for Specifications 6 and 7 of Charge\nI and the Specification of Charge IV.\n                                           4\n\fRODRIGUEZ — ARMY 20130577\n\n                              LAW AND ANALYSIS\n\n      In his first assignment of error, appellant argues that “the Government was\npreempted from charging the assimilated Article 134 offense in . . . [this] case\nbecause . . . Congress intended to limit prosecution for conduct of this nature in a\ncomplete way to Article 120b.” Appellant asks us to dismiss Specifications 2-7 of\nCharge I and order a sentence rehearing. We agree with appellant that\nSpecifications 2-7 of Charge I are preempted by Article 120b, UCMJ, and therefore\nmust be set aside. However, we find a sentence rehearing unnecessary.\n\n       The President has limited the application of Article 134, UCMJ, by the\ndoctrine of preemption, set forth below:\n\n             The preemption doctrine prohibits application of Article\n             134 to conduct covered by Articles 80 through 132. For\n             example, larceny is covered in Article 121, and if an\n             element of that offense is lacking—for example, intent—\n             there can be no larceny or larceny-type offense, either\n             under Article 121 or, because of preemption, under Article\n             134. Article 134 cannot be used to create a new kind of\n             larceny offense, one without the required intent, where\n             Congress has already set the minimum requirements for\n             such an offense in Article 121.\n\nManual for Courts-Martial, United States (2012 ed.) [hereinafter MCM, 2012), pt.\nIV, ¶ 60.c.(5)(a). The United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces has also\nrequired that, in order for preemption to apply, not only must an offense charged\nunder Article 134 lack an element of an enumerated offense, “it must be shown that\nCongress intended the other punitive article to cover a class of offenses in a\ncomplete way.” United States v. Anderson, 68 M.J. 378, 387 (C.A.A.F. 2010)\n(quoting United States v. Kick, 7 M.J. 82, 85 (C.M.A. 1979)). In Anderson, our\nsuperior court further explained, “[t]hus, we have required Congress to indicate\nthrough direct legislative language or express legislative history that particular\nactions or facts are limited to the express language of an enumerated article, and\nmay not be charged under Article 134, UCMJ.” Id. (citations omitted).\n\n       The Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals recently considered whether\npreemption applied to bar Article 134 offenses alleging violations of a state law\nprohibiting using a computer to entice a minor to engage in sexual contact and\ngiving a minor a sexually oriented image. United States v. Long, 2014 CCA LEXIS\n386 (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 2 July 2014) (unpub.). In Long, a divided panel found that\nthese offenses were preempted by Article 120b(c), finding first that the only\ndifference between the state law and Article 120b(c) was that the state law covered\nchildren under 18 years of age while Article 120b(c) covered children under 16, and\n\n                                          5\n\fRODRIGUEZ — ARMY 20130577\n\nsecond that Congress intended to cover these types of offenses in a complete way.\nId. at *8-13. 9\n\n       Here, appellant argues that Cal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1) is a sexually based\ncrime, given its requirement that a defendant’s conduct be motivated by a sexual\ninterest in a child. Given the breadth of Article 120b, appellant argues that we\nshould follow Long and find that the violation of California law is preempted.\n\n      In response, and in seeking to distinguish Long, the government argues that:\n\n             In this case, the element, wrongfully annoy or molest is\n             different from a lewd act. Appellant’s actions are\n             something not contemplated within Article 120b because it\n             is addressing conduct that, while not amounting to\n             indecent, is harassing and targeting children.\n\n       Upon reviewing the elements of an offense under Cal. Penal Code §\n647.6(a)(1) and the elements of an offense under Article 120b(c), UCMJ, we find\nthat the former are subsumed into the latter. We thus find the preemption doctrine\napplies because the conduct covered by the state law is also covered by Article\n120b(c).\n\n      Specifically, the elements of a violation of Cal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1) are:\n\n             1. The defendant engaged in conduct directed at a child;\n\n             2. A normal person, without hesitation, would have been\n             disturbed, irritated, offended, or injured by the\n             defendant’s conduct;\n\n             3. The defendant’s conduct was motivated by an unnatural\n             or abnormal sexual interest in the child; [and]\n\n             4. The child was under the age of 18 years at the time of\n             the conduct.\n\nJudicial Council of California Criminal Jury Instructions (2015 ed.) No. 1122. As\nthis offense was charged under all three clauses of Article 134, the government was\nalso required to establish that appellant’s conduct was prejudicial to good order and\n\n\n9\n  The federal Assimilative Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. § 13, also contains language\nreferencing the concept of preemption in that the statute only applies in those\ninstances of misconduct not otherwise “punishable by any enactment of Congress,”\nto include the UCMJ.\n                                          6\n\fRODRIGUEZ — ARMY 20130577\n\ndiscipline or was service discrediting. We decline to find that the terminal element\nprecludes application of the preemption doctrine. See Long, 2014 CCA LEXIS 386,\nat *9-11.\n\n      The elements of a violation of Article 120b(c), Sexual Abuse of a Child, are:\n\n             1. That the accused engaged in a lewd act; and\n\n             2. That the act was committed upon a child who has not\n             attained the age of 16 years.\n\nMCM, 2012, pt. IV, ¶ 45b(c); see also Note at IV-72. A “lewd act” for purposes of\nArticle 120b(c), UCMJ, is defined, in relevant part, as:\n\n             intentionally communicating indecent language to a child\n             by any means . . . with an intent to . . . arouse or gratify\n             the sexual desire of any person; or\n\n             any indecent conduct, intentionally done with or in the\n             presence of a child . . . that amounts to a form of\n             immorality relating to sexual impurity which is grossly\n             vulgar, obscene, and repugnant to common propriety, and\n             tends to excite sexual desire or deprave morals with\n             respect to sexual relations.\n\nMCM, 2012, pt. IV, ¶ 45b(h)(5)(C) and (D).\n\n       There are only two differences between the elements of the state law offense\nand Article 120b(c). The first is that the state law protects children under 18, while\nArticle 120b(c) protects children under 16. The second is that the state law prohibits\nconduct “motivated by an unnatural or abnormal sexual interest in the child” that\n“without hesitation, would have . . . disturbed, irritated, offended, or injured” a\nnormal person, while Article 120b(c) prohibits indecent language or conduct as\ndefined above.\n\n       With respect to the first difference, “[t]he Government cannot use Article 134,\nUCMJ, to enlarge the age range of an enumerated offense.” Long, 2014 CCA LEXIS\n386, at *9 (citing Williams v. United States, 327 U.S. 711 (1946)). That said, as the\nchildren victimized in this case were all under the age of 16, this facial difference is\nnot significant for purposes of our “as-applied” analysis.\n\n       With respect to the second difference, a review of California case law\nindicates that the prohibition of Cal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1) is sufficiently broad\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\fRODRIGUEZ — ARMY 20130577\n\nas to include indecent language or conduct. Thus, the state law prohibits the very\nsame conduct that is also prohibited by Article 120b(c).\n\n      In People v. Carskaddon, the California Supreme Court interpreted the\npredecessor to Cal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1) and stated:\n\n             Ordinarily, the annoyance or molestation which is\n             forbidden is not concerned with the state of mind of the\n             child but it is the objectionable acts of defendant which\n             constitute the offense, and if his conduct is so lewd or\n             obscene that the normal person would unhesitatingly be\n             irritated by it, such conduct would annoy or molest within\n             the purview of the statute.\n\n49 Cal. 2d 423, 426 (1957) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We\nrecognize that in People v. Thompson, the California Court of Appeal rejected the\ndefendant’s argument that in order to violate the predecessor of Cal. Penal Code §\n647.6(a)(1), a defendant must have committed a lewd or obscene act. 206 Cal. App.\n3d 459, 465-66 (Cal. App. 1988). In its holding, however, the Thompson court\nindicated that the Carskaddon court’s discussion of “lewd or obscene” included not\njust the defendant’s specific act, but the motivation for that act as well:\n\n             the [Carskaddon] court’s reference to a lewd or obscene\n             act which would unhesitatingly irritate the normal person\n             was a reference to the entire crime prohibited by the\n             section: the forbidden “conduct” of the perpetrator. This\n             would include both the act of annoying or molesting under\n             the objective test, and the requisite mental state. We\n             doubt the court intended to separate the two elements\n             when it made its general statement about the section.\n\nId. at 465 (emphasis in original). Thompson stands for the proposition that a\nviolation of Cal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1) may involve an act that, viewed without\nregard to its motivation, is not lewd or obscene. Thompson does not, however, stand\nfor the proposition that a defendant’s conduct, considering both his acts and the\nmotivation for those acts, need not be lewd or obscene to violate the statute. Indeed,\nthe California Supreme Court subsequently characterized the Thompson court’s\nholding as follows, indicating that lewdness is still part of the equation: “[t]he . . .\n[Thompson] court concluded that, although the conduct was not particularly lewd,\nthe ‘behavior would place a normal person in a state of being unhesitatingly\nirritated, if not also fearful,’ thereby satisfying the conduct element of [the\n\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\fRODRIGUEZ — ARMY 20130577\n\npredecessor of § 647.6(a)(1)]. People v. Lopez, 19 Cal. 4th 282, 292 (1998)\n(emphasis added) (internal citation omitted). 10\n\n       The California Supreme Court also made clear in Carskaddon that the\nCalifornia statute prohibits sexual misconduct with children, holding that “[t]he\nprimary purpose of the [] statute is the protection of children from interference by\nsexual offenders, and the apprehension, segregation, and punishment of the latter.”\nCarskaddon, 49 Cal. 2d at 425 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). In\nPeople v. Shaw, the California Court of Appeal reiterated the statute’s purpose,\nstating that “it is the sexual interest in the child that is the focus of the statute’s\nintent” and that “the primary purpose of the statute is to protect children from\ninterference by sexual offenders.” 177 Cal. App. 4th 92, 103 (Cal. App. 2009)\n(citing In re Gladys R., 1 Cal. 3d 855, 867-68 (1970)).\n\n        Our review of the California cases leads us to conclude that Cal. Penal Code §\n647.6(a)(1) is a statute aimed at sexual misconduct with children, and that it covers\nconduct that, when specific acts are considered in light of the motivation for those\nacts, is “indecent” as defined for purposes of Article 120b(c), UCMJ. Moreover,\ngovernment appellate counsel’s characterization of appellant’s conduct as a violation\nof the state law in support of its position that Long is distinguishable and that\nappellant’s conduct did “not amount[] to indecent,” in our view, tends to support a\nconclusion that the state law covers indecent conduct:\n\n             Appellant is preying on children with his vehicle,\n             following them around and asking them questions in order\n             to probe their sexual interest. It’s his actions, not just the\n             words he is communicating, that make his conduct\n             different from Long. Not only is he expressing a sexual\n             interest in them with his words, but he is following or\n             lingering in the area, proving further evidence of his\n             abnormal interest in the children.\n\n\n\n10\n   In Lopez, the court found that a violation of Cal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1) was not\na lesser-included offense of the California offense of committing a lewd act on a\nchild because the lewd act offense requires touching, while Cal. Penal Code §\n647.6(a)(1) does not require a touching but requires the irritating conduct and the\nsexual motivation described above. Lopez, 19 Cal. 4th at 288-94. In Lopez, the\ncourt cited to Carskaddon; while the Lopez court did not cite Carskaddon for the\nproposition that lewd or obscene conduct would annoy or molest a child under the\nstatute, the Lopez court did not disapprove Carskaddon’s language. Lopez, 19 Cal.\n4th at 290.\n\n\n\n                                            9\n\fRODRIGUEZ — ARMY 20130577\n\nBrief on Behalf of Appellee, at 14 (emphasis added). Indeed, a grown man asking\nmiddle school girls for their phone number and telling them they are pretty “in order\nto probe their sexual interest” and thus “expressing a sexual interest in them with his\nwords” could constitute communicating indecent language to a child, and a grown\nman’s following middle school girls around in his car to approach them to ask such\nquestions could constitute indecent conduct. 11\n\n       In short, this case is closely analogous to the well-known example the Manual\nfor Courts-Martial uses to explain the preemption doctrine. MCM, 2012, pt. IV, ¶\n60.c.(5)(a). In this example, a “larceny-type offense” (lacking the element of intent)\nwould be preempted by Article 121, UCMJ. Here, Article 120b is a broad crime\nprohibiting sexual misconduct with children, as explained below, and Article\n120b(c), Sexual Abuse of a Child, specifically defines a crime prohibiting, among\nother things, indecent conduct with and communicating indecent language to a child.\nIn our view, Cal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1)’s requirement that a defendant’s conduct\nbe motivated by a sexual interest in a child is sufficient to make it an offense of the\nsame type as that proscribed by Article 120b generally – a crime prohibiting sexual\nmisconduct with children. Moreover, we believe that Cal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1)\nprohibits conduct that, considering both a defendant’s actions and his motivation for\nthose actions, is lewd or obscene. We thus conclude that the California statute is an\noffense of the same type as that proscribed by Article 120b(c) specifically – a crime\nprohibiting indecent conduct and language upon a child. Accordingly, we find that\nCal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1) prohibits conduct that is also prohibited by an\nenumerated article of the UCMJ. The first prong of the preemption doctrine is\ntherefore met.\n\n        Having made that determination, we now turn to whether “Congress intended\n. . . [Article 120b(c)] to cover a class of offenses in a complete way.” The history of\nthe various UCMJ articles prohibiting indecent acts or communications involving\nchild victims, and the legislative history concerning the 2007 and 2012 amendments\nto the UCMJ, indicate that in enacting Article 120b, Congress intended to cover\nsexual misconduct with children in a complete way, including covering all indecency\ncrimes involving child victims in a complete way under Article 120b(c).\n\n       Before the 2007 amendments to Article 120, UCMJ, indecency crimes against\nchildren were prohibited by the Article 134 offense entitled, Indecent Acts or\nLiberties with a Child. The elements of this offense when no physical contact\noccurred were:\n\n\n11\n  As this case was a guilty plea, there is an insufficient record on which to\ndetermine whether appellant’s communications and conduct that constituted the\nbasis of Specifications 2-7 of Charge I were, in fact, indecent communications and\nindecent conduct. We need not, however, make a finding on this issue in order to\nresolve this assignment of error.\n                                          10\n\fRODRIGUEZ — ARMY 20130577\n\n\n             (a) That the accused committed a certain act;\n\n             (b) That the act amounted to the taking of indecent\n             liberties with a certain person;\n\n             (c) That the accused committed the act in the presence of\n             this person;\n\n             (d) That this person was under 16 years of age and not the\n             spouse of the accused;\n\n             (e) That the accused committed the act with the intent to\n             arouse, appeal to, or gratify the lust, passions, or sexual\n             desires of the accused, the victim, or both; and\n\n             (f) That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the\n             accused was to the prejudice of good order and discipline\n             in the armed forces or was of a nature to bring discredit\n             upon the armed forces.\n\nMCM, 2005, pt. IV, ¶ 87.b.(2). In relevant part, the then-applicable definition of\n“indecent liberties” included, “the liberties must be taken in the physical presence of\nthe child, but physical contact is not required. . . . An indecent liberty may consist\nof communication of indecent language as long as the communication is made in the\nphysical presence of the child.” MCM, 2005, pt. IV, ¶ 87.c.(2). Two definitions of\n“indecent” applied; although phrased differently, both definitions stated the term\nmeant immoral, offensive to propriety, corrupting to morals, and tending to incite\nlust. Compare MCM, 2005, pt. IV, ¶ 89.c and ¶ 90.c.\n\n      In 2007, Congress enacted a version of Article 120, including Article 120(j),\nIndecent Liberties with a Child. This offense had the following elements:\n\n             (a) That the accused committed a certain act or\n             communication;\n\n             (b) That the act or communication was indecent;\n\n             (c) That the accused committed the act or communication\n             in the physical presence of a certain child;\n\n             (d) That the child was under 16 years of age; and\n\n             (e) That the accused committed the act or communication\n\n                                          11\n\fRODRIGUEZ — ARMY 20130577\n\n            with the intent to:\n\n                   (i) arouse, appeal to, or gratify the sexual\n                   desires of any person; or\n\n                   (ii) abuse, humiliate, or degrade any person.\n\nMCM, 2008, pt. IV, ¶ 45.b.(10). The Analysis of Punitive Articles found in the 2008\nManual for Courts-Martial explained “[t]his new Article 120 consolidates several\nsexual misconduct offenses” and included in the list of offenses “replaced by this\nnew paragraph 45 [i.e., the 2007 version of Article 120]” the previous Article 134\noffense of Indecent Acts or Liberties with a Child. MCM, 2008, App. 23, Analysis\nof Punitive Articles, A23-15.\n\n      Under the 2007 version of Article 120, UCMJ, the following definitions\napplied:\n\n            (11) Indecent liberty. The term “indecent liberty” means\n            indecent conduct, but physical contact is not required. It\n            includes one who with the requisite intent exposes one’s\n            genitalia, anus, buttocks, or female areola or nipple to a\n            child. An indecent liberty may consist of communication\n            of indecent language as long as the communication is\n            made in the physical presence of the child. If words\n            designed to excite sexual desire are spoken to a child, or a\n            child is exposed to or involved in sexual conduct, it is an\n            indecent liberty; the child’s consent is not relevant.\n\n            (12) Indecent conduct. The term “indecent conduct” means\n            that form of immorality relating to sexual impurity that is\n            grossly vulgar, obscene, and repugnant to common\n            propriety, and tends to excite sexual desire or deprave\n            morals with respect to sexual relations. Indecent conduct\n            includes observing, or making a videotape, photograph,\n            motion picture, print, negative, slide, or other\n            mechanically, electronically, or chemically reproduced\n            visual material, without another person’s consent, and\n            contrary to that other person’s reasonable expectation of\n            privacy, of—\n\n                    (A) that other person’s genitalia, anus, or buttocks,\n            or (if that other person is female) that person’s areola or\n            nipple; or\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\fRODRIGUEZ — ARMY 20130577\n\n                    (B) that other person while that other person is\n             engaged in a sexual act, sodomy (under section 925\n             (article 125) of this chapter), or sexual contact.\n\nMCM, 2008, pt. IV. ¶ 45.a.(t)(11), (12); see also MCM, 2012, App. 28, Punitive\nArticles Applicable To Sexual Offenses Committed During the Period 1 October\n2007 Through 27 June 2012, A28-4.\n\n       In 2012, Congress enacted Article 120b of the UCMJ. This article\n“criminalizes sexual offenses against children under the age of 16 which were\npreviously contained in the 2007 version of Article 120.” MCM, 2012, App. 23,\nAnalysis of Punitive Articles, A23-16. The President further explained that in\nArticle 120b, “[t]he definitions of prohibited sexual acts, sexual contact, and lewd\nacts have been broadened to cover all sexual offenses against children currently\ncovered under the 2007 version of Article 120(g), Article 120(i), and Article 120(j).”\nId. Moreover, the analysis explained that Article 120b(c) specifically covers all\nindecency crimes against children:\n\n             The new “Sexual Abuse of a Child” offense under Article\n             120b.(c), which proscribes committing a “lewd act” upon a\n             child, was intended to consolidate the 2007 version of\n             Article 120(f), Article 120(g), Article 120(i), and Article\n             120(j), by expanding the definition of “lewd act” to\n             include any sexual contact with a child, indecent exposure\n             to a child, communicating indecent language to a child,\n             and committing indecent conduct with or in the presence\n             of a child. Exposure, communication, and indecent\n             conduct now include offenses committed via any\n             communication technology to encompass offenses\n             committed via the internet (such as exposing oneself to a\n             child by using a webcam), cell phones, and other modern\n             forms of communication. This change expands the pre-\n             2012 definition of “indecent liberty” which proscribed\n             conduct only if committed in the physical presence of a\n             child.\n\nId.\n\n       We conclude after reviewing this history that Congress intended Article\n120b(c) to cover all indecency crimes involving child victims. In short, the 2007\nversion of Article 120 was intended to cover all offenses prohibited under the old\nArticle 134 offense of Indecent Acts or Liberties with a Child, and when Article\n120b was enacted in 2012, it in turn was intended to cover all offenses prohibited\nunder the 2007 version of Article 120(j). Moreover, after reviewing this history we\n\n                                          13\n\fRODRIGUEZ — ARMY 20130577\n\nagree with our sister court in Long “that Congress intended for Article 120b, UCMJ,\nto be a comprehensive statute to address sexual misconduct with children.” Long,\n2014 CCA LEXIS 386, at *13. 12 As Cal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1) is a statute\nprohibiting sexual misconduct with children as explained above, the second prong of\nthe preemption doctrine is met. In other words, there was no “gap” in federal\ncriminal law which necessitated “filling” by resorting to state law.\n\n      Having found that both prongs of the preemption doctrine are met with respect\nto Specifications 2-7 of Charge I, we will set aside those specifications and that\ncharge. Our resolution of the preemption issue renders appellant’s other\nassignments of error moot. 13\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n \n       The findings of guilty of Specifications 2-7 of Charge I and Charge I are set\naside. The remaining findings of guilty are AFFIRMED.\n\n       In addition to asking that we dismiss Specifications 2-7 of Charge I, appellant\nasks that we order a sentence rehearing. We decline to do so. Instead, we reassess\nappellant’s sentence.\n\n        In United States v. Sales, 22 M.J. 305 (C.M.A. 1986), our superior court set\nforth the standard for sentence reassessment: “if the [service] court can determine to\nits satisfaction that, absent any error, the sentence adjudged would have been of at\nleast a certain severity, then a sentence of that severity or less will be free of the\nprejudicial effects of error . . . .” Id. at 308. After conducting a thorough analysis\non the basis of the entire record and in accordance with the principles articulated in\nSales and United States v. Winckelmann, 73 M.J. 11, 15-16 (C.A.A.F. 2013), we are\nconfident in our ability to reassess appellant’s sentence without the need for a\nrehearing.\n\n      In evaluating the Winckelmann factors, we find there is no dramatic change in\nthe penalty landscape or significant decrease in sentencing exposure because\nappellant’s maximum sentence is now reduced from 21.5 years to 15.5 years of\nconfinement as a result of our setting aside the six specifications of Charge I, each\n\n\n12\n  In reaching this conclusion, we are mindful that Congress left sodomy against a\nchild outside of Article 120b. See Article 125, UCMJ. That Congress left this type\nof sexual crime against a child outside of Article 120b does not compel a conclusion\nthat Congress did not intend Article 120b to be an otherwise comprehensive statute\naddressing sexual misconduct against children.\n13\n Specifically, we need not determine whether the Article 120a offense of stalking\nmay also have preempted a state stalking statute.\n                                          14\n\fRODRIGUEZ — ARMY 20130577\n\nof which carried a maximum of one year of confinement. Appellant’s adjudged and\napproved sentence of two years of confinement was still well below the newly\napplicable maximum punishment. Also, appellant remains convicted of the most\negregious offense he was charged with—Article 120b, UCMJ, Sexual Abuse of a\nChild (the Specification of Charge III). Moreover, appellant’s underlying\nmisconduct (asking TSH and MGV for their telephone numbers) that served as the\nbasis for Specifications 6 and 7 of Charge I would have remained admissible—and\nnecessary—in order for the government to prove appellant violated the no-contact\norder issued by his company commander (the Specification of Charge IV). Finally,\nwe review the records of a substantial number of courts-martial involving sexual\nmisconduct and we have extensive experience with the level of sentences imposed\nfor such offenses under various circumstances.\n\n       After our review of the record, and accounting for setting aside Specifications\n2-7 of Charge I and Charge I, we are confident that the military judge would have\nadjudged a sentence no less severe than reduction to the grade of E-1, twenty\nmonths’ confinement, and a bad-conduct discharge. We are also confident that the\nconvening authority would have approved that sentence. We also conclude, pursuant\nto Article 66, UCMJ, that such a sentence is appropriate for the remaining findings\nof guilty.\n\n       After considering the entire record, we AFFIRM only so much of the sentence\nas provides for a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for twenty months, and\nreduction to the grade of E-1. All rights, privileges, and property, of which\nappellant has been deprived by virtue of that portion of the findings and sentence set\naside by this decision are ordered restored.

The\nconvening authority approved the sentence as adjudged and credited appellant with\nsixty-three days of confinement.\n\n      This case is before us pursuant to Article 66, UCMJ. Appellant raises three\nassignments of error and one supplemental assignment of error. We granted\nappellant’s request for oral argument on two of his assignments of error and heard\nargument on 20 October 2015. 3 As appellant’s first assignment of error merits\ndiscussion and relief, his remaining assignments of error are rendered moot.\n\n                                  BACKGROUND\n\n       Appellant was stationed at Fort Irwin, California. On several occasions\nbetween November 2012 and April 2013, appellant followed minor girls walking on\npost in his car, and then approached them and talked to them. In November 2012,\nappellant drove up to ACA, a fourteen-year-old girl walking along the road, rolled\ndown his window, and asked her for her phone number. After ACA said, “no” and\ntried to walk away, appellant parked and asked her to join him. When she did, they\nspoke and ACA told him she was fourteen. Appellant subsequently took her cell\nphone, entered his phone number in it, and called himself so he would have her\nphone number. The next day, appellant sent ACA a text asking if she wanted to have\nsex with him. 4\n\n\n1\n  The provision reads, “[e]very person who annoys or molests any child under 18\nyears of age shall be punished by a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars\n($5,000), by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or by both the\nfine and imprisonment.”\n2\n  After appellant pleaded not guilty to one specification of wrongfully annoying and\nmolesting a minor in violation of Cal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1) assimilated under\nArticle 134, UCMJ, and to one specification of stalking in violation of Article 120a,\nUCMJ, the military judge dismissed these two specifications in accordance with the\nterms of the pretrial agreement.\n3\n We note with appreciation the high level of oral and written advocacy on behalf of\nboth parties in this case.\n4\n This text message, which constituted a lewd act upon a child, was the basis for the\nSpecification of Charge III.\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\fRODRIGUEZ — ARMY 20130577\n\n       On the morning of 21 February 2013, appellant approached two other girls,\nEMM and KMT—who were thirteen years and fourteen years old, respectively—in\nhis car as they were walking to the Fort Irwin Middle School. He rolled down his\ncar window, said, “hey,” and told them, “you look good today.” The girls then tried\nto ignore appellant and continued to walk to school. At that point, appellant circled\naround the block so he could continue following them in his car. 5\n\n       On the morning of 22 February 2013, appellant was in his car and saw EMM\nas she was walking to the home of KMT before school. He waved to EMM a couple\nof times. When she raised her phone to take a picture of his license plate, he\nreversed his car so she could not see or take a picture of his license plate. Appellant\nthen stopped his car and EMM walked away. 6\n\n       On the same day, 22 February 2013, appellant was in his car and saw a twelve\nyear old girl, ANC, on the way to Fort Irwin Middle School. He pulled up to her and\nasked her, “has anyone ever told you, you look gorgeous?” 7\n\n        Just over a week later, on 1 March 2013, one of the teachers at Fort Irwin\nMiddle School was told by two students that they had seen appellant driving nearby.\nThe teacher then got in her car and followed appellant until he pulled over. After a\nbrief conversation in which appellant asked the teacher if she knew him, appellant\ndrove off. Five days later, on 6 March 2013, appellant’s company commander\nordered him to stay away from all schools, playgrounds, youth centers, and day care\nfacilities on Fort Irwin and to have no verbal or physical contact with any minor\nfemales other than his stepdaughter.\n\n        Despite that “no contact” order, on 13 April 2013, appellant approached two\ngirls, a twelve year old, TSH, and a thirteen year old, MGV, walking back to one of\nthe girls’ homes from the on-post commissary. Appellant drove up to them and\nasked them for their phone numbers. They declined and then ran away from\n\n\n5\n This conduct, which constituted wrongfully annoying and molesting the girls in\nviolation of Cal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1), was the basis for Specifications 2 and 3\nof Charge I.\n6\n This conduct, which constituted wrongfully annoying and molesting the girl in\nviolation of Cal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1), was the basis for Specification 4 of\nCharge I.\n7\n This conduct, which constituted wrongfully annoying and molesting the girl in\nviolation of Cal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1), was the basis for Specification 5 of\nCharge I.\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\fRODRIGUEZ — ARMY 20130577\n\nappellant’s car. Shortly thereafter, the girls saw appellant drive through the\nneighborhood. TSH tried to see if she could get appellant’s license plate number but\ndid not succeed because, once appellant saw her running after his car, he accelerated\nand left the area. 8\n\n      At trial, the military judge advised appellant that the offense described in Cal.\nPenal Code § 647.6(a)(1), the basis of Specifications 2-7 of Charge I,\n\n             is not preempted by Article 120a, stalking, in that it [the\n             California statute] prohibits conduct less severe than that\n             required by the stalking article, which contemplates a fear\n             of death or bodily harm. California Criminal Jury\n             Instructions 1122 [the jury instructions applicable to the\n             California statute] describes annoying or molesting a child\n             as requiring that, first, you engaged in conduct directed at\n             a child; second, a normal person, without hesitation,\n             would have been disturbed, irritated, offended or injured\n             by your conduct; third, your conduct was motivated by an\n             unnatural and abnormal sexual interest in the child; and\n             fourth, that the child was under the age of 18 years at the\n             time of your conduct.\n\n             It is not necessary that the child actually be irritated or\n             disturbed. It’s also not necessary that the child actually\n             be touched. It is not a defense that the child may have\n             consented to the act.\n\n      In pleading guilty to Specifications 2-7 of Charge I, appellant admitted the\nelements of Cal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1) accurately described his actions. He also\nadmitted that the offenses occurred at Fort Irwin, California, a place under exclusive\nor concurrent federal jurisdiction, that Cal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1) was properly\nassimilated into federal law by 18 U.S.C. § 13, and finally that, under the\ncircumstances, his conduct was both to the prejudice of good order and discipline in\nthe armed forces and of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.\n\n\n\n\n8\n  This conduct, which constituted wrongfully annoying and molesting the girls in\nviolation of Cal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1) also constituted failure to obey the lawful\norder of appellant’s company commander to have no verbal or physical contact with\nminor females and was simultaneously the basis for Specifications 6 and 7 of Charge\nI and the Specification of Charge IV.\n                                           4\n\fRODRIGUEZ — ARMY 20130577\n\n                              LAW AND ANALYSIS\n\n      In his first assignment of error, appellant argues that “the Government was\npreempted from charging the assimilated Article 134 offense in . . . [this] case\nbecause . . . Congress intended to limit prosecution for conduct of this nature in a\ncomplete way to Article 120b.” Appellant asks us to dismiss Specifications 2-7 of\nCharge I and order a sentence rehearing. We agree with appellant that\nSpecifications 2-7 of Charge I are preempted by Article 120b, UCMJ, and therefore\nmust be set aside. However, we find a sentence rehearing unnecessary.\n\n       The President has limited the application of Article 134, UCMJ, by the\ndoctrine of preemption, set forth below:\n\n             The preemption doctrine prohibits application of Article\n             134 to conduct covered by Articles 80 through 132. For\n             example, larceny is covered in Article 121, and if an\n             element of that offense is lacking—for example, intent—\n             there can be no larceny or larceny-type offense, either\n             under Article 121 or, because of preemption, under Article\n             134. Article 134 cannot be used to create a new kind of\n             larceny offense, one without the required intent, where\n             Congress has already set the minimum requirements for\n             such an offense in Article 121.\n\nManual for Courts-Martial, United States (2012 ed.) [hereinafter MCM, 2012), pt.\nIV, ¶ 60.c.(5)(a). The United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces has also\nrequired that, in order for preemption to apply, not only must an offense charged\nunder Article 134 lack an element of an enumerated offense, “it must be shown that\nCongress intended the other punitive article to cover a class of offenses in a\ncomplete way.” United States v. Anderson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 387 (C.A.A.F. 2010)\n(quoting United States v.

In Anderson, our\nsuperior court further explained, “[t]hus, we have required Congress to indicate\nthrough direct legislative language or express legislative history that particular\nactions or facts are limited to the express language of an enumerated article, and\nmay not be charged under Article 134, UCMJ.” Id. (citations omitted).\n\n       The Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals recently considered whether\npreemption applied to bar Article 134 offenses alleging violations of a state law\nprohibiting using a computer to entice a minor to engage in sexual contact and\ngiving a minor a sexually oriented image. United States v. Long, 2014 CCA LEXIS\n386 (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 2 July 2014) (unpub.). In Long, a divided panel found that\nthese offenses were preempted by Article 120b(c), finding first that the only\ndifference between the state law and Article 120b(c) was that the state law covered\nchildren under 18 years of age while Article 120b(c) covered children under 16, and\n\n                                          5\n\fRODRIGUEZ — ARMY 20130577\n\nsecond that Congress intended to cover these types of offenses in a complete way.\nId. at *8-13. 9\n\n       Here, appellant argues that Cal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1) is a sexually based\ncrime, given its requirement that a defendant’s conduct be motivated by a sexual\ninterest in a child. Given the breadth of Article 120b, appellant argues that we\nshould follow Long and find that the violation of California law is preempted.\n\n      In response, and in seeking to distinguish Long, the government argues that:\n\n             In this case, the element, wrongfully annoy or molest is\n             different from a lewd act. Appellant’s actions are\n             something not contemplated within Article 120b because it\n             is addressing conduct that, while not amounting to\n             indecent, is harassing and targeting children.\n\n       Upon reviewing the elements of an offense under Cal. Penal Code §\n647.6(a)(1) and the elements of an offense under Article 120b(c), UCMJ, we find\nthat the former are subsumed into the latter. We thus find the preemption doctrine\napplies because the conduct covered by the state law is also covered by Article\n120b(c).\n\n      Specifically, the elements of a violation of Cal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1) are:\n\n             1. The defendant engaged in conduct directed at a child;\n\n             2. A normal person, without hesitation, would have been\n             disturbed, irritated, offended, or injured by the\n             defendant’s conduct;\n\n             3. The defendant’s conduct was motivated by an unnatural\n             or abnormal sexual interest in the child; [and]\n\n             4. The child was under the age of 18 years at the time of\n             the conduct.\n\nJudicial Council of California Criminal Jury Instructions (2015 ed.) No. 1122. As\nthis offense was charged under all three clauses of Article 134, the government was\nalso required to establish that appellant’s conduct was prejudicial to good order and\n\n\n9\n  The federal Assimilative Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. § 13, also contains language\nreferencing the concept of preemption in that the statute only applies in those\ninstances of misconduct not otherwise “punishable by any enactment of Congress,”\nto include the UCMJ.\n                                          6\n\fRODRIGUEZ — ARMY 20130577\n\ndiscipline or was service discrediting. We decline to find that the terminal element\nprecludes application of the preemption doctrine. See Long, 2014 CCA LEXIS 386,\nat *9-11.\n\n      The elements of a violation of Article 120b(c), Sexual Abuse of a Child, are:\n\n             1. That the accused engaged in a lewd act; and\n\n             2. That the act was committed upon a child who has not\n             attained the age of 16 years.\n\nMCM, 2012, pt. IV, ¶ 45b(c); see also Note at IV-72. A “lewd act” for purposes of\nArticle 120b(c), UCMJ, is defined, in relevant part, as:\n\n             intentionally communicating indecent language to a child\n             by any means . . . with an intent to . . . arouse or gratify\n             the sexual desire of any person; or\n\n             any indecent conduct, intentionally done with or in the\n             presence of a child . . . that amounts to a form of\n             immorality relating to sexual impurity which is grossly\n             vulgar, obscene, and repugnant to common propriety, and\n             tends to excite sexual desire or deprave morals with\n             respect to sexual relations.\n\nMCM, 2012, pt. IV, ¶ 45b(h)(5)(C) and (D).\n\n       There are only two differences between the elements of the state law offense\nand Article 120b(c). The first is that the state law protects children under 18, while\nArticle 120b(c) protects children under 16. The second is that the state law prohibits\nconduct “motivated by an unnatural or abnormal sexual interest in the child” that\n“without hesitation, would have . . . disturbed, irritated, offended, or injured” a\nnormal person, while Article 120b(c) prohibits indecent language or conduct as\ndefined above.\n\n       With respect to the first difference, “[t]he Government cannot use Article 134,\nUCMJ, to enlarge the age range of an enumerated offense.” Long, 2014 CCA LEXIS\n386, at *9 (citing Williams v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104274\"><a href=\"/opinion/104274/williams-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">711</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1946)). That said, as the\nchildren victimized in this case were all under the age of 16, this facial difference is\nnot significant for purposes of our “as-applied” analysis.\n\n       With respect to the second difference, a review of California case law\nindicates that the prohibition of Cal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1) is sufficiently broad\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\fRODRIGUEZ — ARMY 20130577\n\nas to include indecent language or conduct. Thus, the state law prohibits the very\nsame conduct that is also prohibited by Article 120b(c).\n\n      In People v. Carskaddon, the California Supreme Court interpreted the\npredecessor to Cal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1) and stated:\n\n             Ordinarily, the annoyance or molestation which is\n             forbidden is not concerned with the state of mind of the\n             child but it is the objectionable acts of defendant which\n             constitute the offense, and if his conduct is so lewd or\n             obscene that the normal person would unhesitatingly be\n             irritated by it, such conduct would annoy or molest within\n             the purview of the statute.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1221091\"><a href=\"/opinion/1221091/people-v-carskaddon/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">423</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 426 (1957) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We\nrecognize that in People v. Thompson, the California Court of Appeal rejected the\ndefendant’s argument that in order to violate the predecessor of Cal. Penal Code §\n647.6(a)(1), a defendant must have committed a lewd or obscene act. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">206</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 459, 465-66 (Cal. App. 1988). In its holding, however, the Thompson court\nindicated that the Carskaddon court’s discussion of “lewd or obscene” included not\njust the defendant’s specific act, but the motivation for that act as well:\n\n             the [Carskaddon] court’s reference to a lewd or obscene\n             act which would unhesitatingly irritate the normal person\n             was a reference to the entire crime prohibited by the\n             section: the forbidden “conduct” of the perpetrator. This\n             would include both the act of annoying or molesting under\n             the objective test, and the requisite mental state. We\n             doubt the court intended to separate the two elements\n             when it made its general statement about the section.\n\nId. at 465 (emphasis in original). Thompson stands for the proposition that a\nviolation of Cal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1) may involve an act that, viewed without\nregard to its motivation, is not lewd or obscene. Thompson does not, however, stand\nfor the proposition that a defendant’s conduct, considering both his acts and the\nmotivation for those acts, need not be lewd or obscene to violate the statute. Indeed,\nthe California Supreme Court subsequently characterized the Thompson court’s\nholding as follows, indicating that lewdness is still part of the equation: “[t]he . . .\n[Thompson] court concluded that, although the conduct was not particularly lewd,\nthe ‘behavior would place a normal person in a state of being unhesitatingly\nirritated, if not also fearful,’ thereby satisfying the conduct element of [the\n\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\fRODRIGUEZ — ARMY 20130577\n\npredecessor of § 647.6(a)(1)]. People v.

In\nPeople v. Shaw, the California Court of Appeal reiterated the statute’s purpose,\nstating that “it is the sexual interest in the child that is the focus of the statute’s\nintent” and that “the primary purpose of the statute is to protect children from\ninterference by sexual offenders.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Penal Code §\n647.6(a)(1) is a statute aimed at sexual misconduct with children, and that it covers\nconduct that, when specific acts are considered in light of the motivation for those\nacts, is “indecent” as defined for purposes of Article 120b(c), UCMJ. Moreover,\ngovernment appellate counsel’s characterization of appellant’s conduct as a violation\nof the state law in support of its position that Long is distinguishable and that\nappellant’s conduct did “not amount[] to indecent,” in our view, tends to support a\nconclusion that the state law covers indecent conduct:\n\n             Appellant is preying on children with his vehicle,\n             following them around and asking them questions in order\n             to probe their sexual interest. It’s his actions, not just the\n             words he is communicating, that make his conduct\n             different from Long. Not only is he expressing a sexual\n             interest in them with his words, but he is following or\n             lingering in the area, proving further evidence of his\n             abnormal interest in the children.\n\n\n\n10\n   In Lopez, the court found that a violation of Cal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1) was not\na lesser-included offense of the California offense of committing a lewd act on a\nchild because the lewd act offense requires touching, while Cal. Penal Code §\n647.6(a)(1) does not require a touching but requires the irritating conduct and the\nsexual motivation described above. Lopez, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">4th</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 288-94. In Lopez, the\ncourt cited to Carskaddon; while the Lopez court did not cite Carskaddon for the\nproposition that lewd or obscene conduct would annoy or molest a child under the\nstatute, the Lopez court did not disapprove Carskaddon’s language. Lopez, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">4th</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 290.\n\n\n\n                                            9\n\fRODRIGUEZ — ARMY 20130577\n\nBrief on Behalf of Appellee, at 14 (emphasis added). Indeed, a grown man asking\nmiddle school girls for their phone number and telling them they are pretty “in order\nto probe their sexual interest” and thus “expressing a sexual interest in them with his\nwords” could constitute communicating indecent language to a child, and a grown\nman’s following middle school girls around in his car to approach them to ask such\nquestions could constitute indecent conduct. 11\n\n       In short, this case is closely analogous to the well-known example the Manual\nfor Courts-Martial uses to explain the preemption doctrine. MCM, 2012, pt. IV, ¶\n60.c.(5)(a). In this example, a “larceny-type offense” (lacking the element of intent)\nwould be preempted by Article 121, UCMJ. Here, Article 120b is a broad crime\nprohibiting sexual misconduct with children, as explained below, and Article\n120b(c), Sexual Abuse of a Child, specifically defines a crime prohibiting, among\nother things, indecent conduct with and communicating indecent language to a child.\nIn our view, Cal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1)’s requirement that a defendant’s conduct\nbe motivated by a sexual interest in a child is sufficient to make it an offense of the\nsame type as that proscribed by Article 120b generally – a crime prohibiting sexual\nmisconduct with children. Moreover, we believe that Cal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1)\nprohibits conduct that, considering both a defendant’s actions and his motivation for\nthose actions, is lewd or obscene. We thus conclude that the California statute is an\noffense of the same type as that proscribed by Article 120b(c) specifically – a crime\nprohibiting indecent conduct and language upon a child. Accordingly, we find that\nCal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1) prohibits conduct that is also prohibited by an\nenumerated article of the UCMJ. The first prong of the preemption doctrine is\ntherefore met.\n\n        Having made that determination, we now turn to whether “Congress intended\n. . . [Article 120b(c)] to cover a class of offenses in a complete way.” The history of\nthe various UCMJ articles prohibiting indecent acts or communications involving\nchild victims, and the legislative history concerning the 2007 and 2012 amendments\nto the UCMJ, indicate that in enacting Article 120b, Congress intended to cover\nsexual misconduct with children in a complete way, including covering all indecency\ncrimes involving child victims in a complete way under Article 120b(c).\n\n       Before the 2007 amendments to Article 120, UCMJ, indecency crimes against\nchildren were prohibited by the Article 134 offense entitled, Indecent Acts or\nLiberties with a Child. The elements of this offense when no physical contact\noccurred were:\n\n\n11\n  As this case was a guilty plea, there is an insufficient record on which to\ndetermine whether appellant’s communications and conduct that constituted the\nbasis of Specifications 2-7 of Charge I were, in fact, indecent communications and\nindecent conduct. We need not, however, make a finding on this issue in order to\nresolve this assignment of error.\n                                          10\n\fRODRIGUEZ — ARMY 20130577\n\n\n             (a) That the accused committed a certain act;\n\n             (b) That the act amounted to the taking of indecent\n             liberties with a certain person;\n\n             (c) That the accused committed the act in the presence of\n             this person;\n\n             (d) That this person was under 16 years of age and not the\n             spouse of the accused;\n\n             (e) That the accused committed the act with the intent to\n             arouse, appeal to, or gratify the lust, passions, or sexual\n             desires of the accused, the victim, or both; and\n\n             (f) That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the\n             accused was to the prejudice of good order and discipline\n             in the armed forces or was of a nature to bring discredit\n             upon the armed forces.\n\nMCM, 2005, pt. IV, ¶ 87.b.(2). In relevant part, the then-applicable definition of\n“indecent liberties” included, “the liberties must be taken in the physical presence of\nthe child, but physical contact is not required. . . . An indecent liberty may consist\nof communication of indecent language as long as the communication is made in the\nphysical presence of the child.” MCM, 2005, pt. IV, ¶ 87.c.(2). Two definitions of\n“indecent” applied; although phrased differently, both definitions stated the term\nmeant immoral, offensive to propriety, corrupting to morals, and tending to incite\nlust. Compare MCM, 2005, pt. IV, ¶ 89.c and ¶ 90.c.\n\n      In 2007, Congress enacted a version of Article 120, including Article 120(j),\nIndecent Liberties with a Child. This offense had the following elements:\n\n             (a) That the accused committed a certain act or\n             communication;\n\n             (b) That the act or communication was indecent;\n\n             (c) That the accused committed the act or communication\n             in the physical presence of a certain child;\n\n             (d) That the child was under 16 years of age; and\n\n             (e) That the accused committed the act or communication\n\n                                          11\n\fRODRIGUEZ — ARMY 20130577\n\n            with the intent to:\n\n                   (i) arouse, appeal to, or gratify the sexual\n                   desires of any person; or\n\n                   (ii) abuse, humiliate, or degrade any person.\n\nMCM, 2008, pt. IV, ¶ 45.b.(10). The Analysis of Punitive Articles found in the 2008\nManual for Courts-Martial explained “[t]his new Article 120 consolidates several\nsexual misconduct offenses” and included in the list of offenses “replaced by this\nnew paragraph 45 [i.e., the 2007 version of Article 120]” the previous Article 134\noffense of Indecent Acts or Liberties with a Child. MCM, 2008, App. 23, Analysis\nof Punitive Articles, A23-15.\n\n      Under the 2007 version of Article 120, UCMJ, the following definitions\napplied:\n\n            (11) Indecent liberty. The term “indecent liberty” means\n            indecent conduct, but physical contact is not required. It\n            includes one who with the requisite intent exposes one’s\n            genitalia, anus, buttocks, or female areola or nipple to a\n            child. An indecent liberty may consist of communication\n            of indecent language as long as the communication is\n            made in the physical presence of the child. If words\n            designed to excite sexual desire are spoken to a child, or a\n            child is exposed to or involved in sexual conduct, it is an\n            indecent liberty; the child’s consent is not relevant.\n\n            (12) Indecent conduct. The term “indecent conduct” means\n            that form of immorality relating to sexual impurity that is\n            grossly vulgar, obscene, and repugnant to common\n            propriety, and tends to excite sexual desire or deprave\n            morals with respect to sexual relations. Indecent conduct\n            includes observing, or making a videotape, photograph,\n            motion picture, print, negative, slide, or other\n            mechanically, electronically, or chemically reproduced\n            visual material, without another person’s consent, and\n            contrary to that other person’s reasonable expectation of\n            privacy, of—\n\n                    (A) that other person’s genitalia, anus, or buttocks,\n            or (if that other person is female) that person’s areola or\n            nipple; or\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\fRODRIGUEZ — ARMY 20130577\n\n                    (B) that other person while that other person is\n             engaged in a sexual act, sodomy (under section 925\n             (article 125) of this chapter), or sexual contact.\n\nMCM, 2008, pt. IV. ¶ 45.a.(t)(11), (12); see also MCM, 2012, App. 28, Punitive\nArticles Applicable To Sexual Offenses Committed During the Period 1 October\n2007 Through 27 June 2012, A28-4.\n\n       In 2012, Congress enacted Article 120b of the UCMJ. This article\n“criminalizes sexual offenses against children under the age of 16 which were\npreviously contained in the 2007 version of Article 120.” MCM, 2012, App. 23,\nAnalysis of Punitive Articles, A23-16. The President further explained that in\nArticle 120b, “[t]he definitions of prohibited sexual acts, sexual contact, and lewd\nacts have been broadened to cover all sexual offenses against children currently\ncovered under the 2007 version of Article 120(g), Article 120(i), and Article 120(j).”\nId. Moreover, the analysis explained that Article 120b(c) specifically covers all\nindecency crimes against children:\n\n             The new “Sexual Abuse of a Child” offense under Article\n             120b.(c), which proscribes committing a “lewd act” upon a\n             child, was intended to consolidate the 2007 version of\n             Article 120(f), Article 120(g), Article 120(i), and Article\n             120(j), by expanding the definition of “lewd act” to\n             include any sexual contact with a child, indecent exposure\n             to a child, communicating indecent language to a child,\n             and committing indecent conduct with or in the presence\n             of a child. Exposure, communication, and indecent\n             conduct now include offenses committed via any\n             communication technology to encompass offenses\n             committed via the internet (such as exposing oneself to a\n             child by using a webcam), cell phones, and other modern\n             forms of communication. This change expands the pre-\n             2012 definition of “indecent liberty” which proscribed\n             conduct only if committed in the physical presence of a\n             child.\n\nId.\n\n       We conclude after reviewing this history that Congress intended Article\n120b(c) to cover all indecency crimes involving child victims. In short, the 2007\nversion of Article 120 was intended to cover all offenses prohibited under the old\nArticle 134 offense of Indecent Acts or Liberties with a Child, and when Article\n120b was enacted in 2012, it in turn was intended to cover all offenses prohibited\nunder the 2007 version of Article 120(j). Moreover, after reviewing this history we\n\n                                          13\n\fRODRIGUEZ — ARMY 20130577\n\nagree with our sister court in Long “that Congress intended for Article 120b, UCMJ,\nto be a comprehensive statute to address sexual misconduct with children.” Long,\n2014 CCA LEXIS 386, at *13. 12 As Cal. Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1) is a statute\nprohibiting sexual misconduct with children as explained above, the second prong of\nthe preemption doctrine is met. In other words, there was no “gap” in federal\ncriminal law which necessitated “filling” by resorting to state law.\n\n      Having found that both prongs of the preemption doctrine are met with respect\nto Specifications 2-7 of Charge I, we will set aside those specifications and that\ncharge. Our resolution of the preemption issue renders appellant’s other\nassignments of error moot. 13\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n \n       The findings of guilty of Specifications 2-7 of Charge I and Charge I are set\naside. The remaining findings of guilty are AFFIRMED.\n\n       In addition to asking that we dismiss Specifications 2-7 of Charge I, appellant\nasks that we order a sentence rehearing. We decline to do so. Instead, we reassess\nappellant’s sentence.\n\n        In United States v. Sales, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (C.M.A. 1986), our superior court set\nforth the standard for sentence reassessment: “if the [service] court can determine to\nits satisfaction that, absent any error, the sentence adjudged would have been of at\nleast a certain severity, then a sentence of that severity or less will be free of the\nprejudicial effects of error . . . .” Id. at 308. After conducting a thorough analysis\non the basis of the entire record and in accordance with the principles articulated in\nSales and United States v. Winckelmann, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 15-16 (C.A.A.F. 2013), we are\nconfident in our ability to reassess appellant’s sentence without the need for a\nrehearing.\n\n      In evaluating the Winckelmann factors, we find there is no dramatic change in\nthe penalty landscape or significant decrease in sentencing exposure because\nappellant’s maximum sentence is now reduced from 21.5 years to 15.5 years of\nconfinement as a result of our setting aside the six specifications of Charge I, each\n\n\n12\n  In reaching this conclusion, we are mindful that Congress left sodomy against a\nchild outside of Article 120b. See Article 125, UCMJ. That Congress left this type\nof sexual crime against a child outside of Article 120b does not compel a conclusion\nthat Congress did not intend Article 120b to be an otherwise comprehensive statute\naddressing sexual misconduct against children.\n13\n Specifically, we need not determine whether the Article 120a offense of stalking\nmay also have preempted a state stalking statute.\n                                          14\n\fRODRIGUEZ — ARMY 20130577\n\nof which carried a maximum of one year of confinement. Appellant’s adjudged and\napproved sentence of two years of confinement was still well below the newly\napplicable maximum punishment. Also, appellant remains convicted of the most\negregious offense he was charged with—Article 120b, UCMJ, Sexual Abuse of a\nChild (the Specification of Charge III). Moreover, appellant’s underlying\nmisconduct (asking TSH and MGV for their telephone numbers) that served as the\nbasis for Specifications 6 and 7 of Charge I would have remained admissible—and\nnecessary—in order for the government to prove appellant violated the no-contact\norder issued by his company commander (the Specification of Charge IV). Finally,\nwe review the records of a substantial number of courts-martial involving sexual\nmisconduct and we have extensive experience with the level of sentences imposed\nfor such offenses under various circumstances.\n\n       After our review of the record, and accounting for setting aside Specifications\n2-7 of Charge I and Charge I, we are confident that the military judge would have\nadjudged a sentence no less severe than reduction to the grade of E-1, twenty\nmonths’ confinement, and a bad-conduct discharge. We are also confident that the\nconvening authority would have approved that sentence. We also conclude, pursuant\nto Article 66, UCMJ, that such a sentence is appropriate for the remaining findings\nof guilty.\n\n       After considering the entire record, we AFFIRM only so much of the sentence\nas provides for a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for twenty months, and\nreduction to the grade of E-1. All rights, privileges, and property, of which\nappellant has been deprived by virtue of that portion of the findings and sentence set\naside by this decision are ordered restored.
