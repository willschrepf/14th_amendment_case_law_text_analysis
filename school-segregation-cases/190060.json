Terhune, 315 F.3d\n1108, 1119 (9th Cir. 2003), which held that a failure to\nexhaust under § 1997e(a) should be raised by a defendant as\nan “unenumerated Rule 12(b) motion.” The court held that\nto the extent evidence in the record permits, the appropriate\nprocedural device for a pretrial determination of whether\nadministrative remedies have been exhausted under the\nPrison Litigation Reform Act is a motion for summary\njudgment. If summary judgment is not appropriate, the\ndistrict judge may decide disputed questions of fact in a\npreliminary proceeding.\n\n    Second, the court held that plaintiff satisfied the\nexhaustion requirement of § 1997e(a). The court determined\nthat defendants failed to prove that administrative remedies\nwere available at the jail where plaintiff was confined.\nBecause no administrative remedies were available, the court\ndetermined that plaintiff was excused from any obligation to\nexhaust under § 1997e(a).

FLETCHER, Circuit Judge:\n\n     Juan Roberto Albino brought suit against Los Angeles\nCounty Sheriff Lee Baca, several Doe defendants, and Los\nAngeles County, alleging violations of 42 U.S.C. § 1983, as\nwell as several state laws, arising out of injuries Albino\nsuffered while confined in Los Angeles County jail. Albino’s\nclaims are subject to the Prison Litigation Reform Act\n(“PLRA”), which requires that a prisoner challenging prison\nconditions exhaust available administrative remedies before\nfiling suit. 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). Defendants moved for\nsummary judgment based, inter alia, on Albino’s alleged\nfailure to exhaust. The district court granted the motion,\ndismissing Albino’s federal claims without prejudice. The\ncourt also dismissed his state claims without prejudice. See\n28 U.S.C. § 1367(c). We reverse.\n\n    First, although it may be more a matter of a change of\nnomenclature than of practical operation, we overrule Wyatt\nv. Terhune, 315 F.3d 1108, 1119 (9th Cir. 2003), in which we\nheld that a failure to exhaust under § 1997e(a) should be\nraised by a defendant as an “unenumerated Rule 12(b)\nmotion.” We conclude that a failure to exhaust is more\nappropriately handled under the framework of the existing\nrules than under an “unenumerated” (that is, non-existent)\nrule. Failure to exhaust under the PLRA is “an affirmative\ndefense the defendant must plead and prove.” Jones v. Bock,\n549 U.S. 199, 204, 216 (2007). In the rare event that a failure\nto exhaust is clear on the face of the complaint, a defendant\nmay move for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6). Otherwise,\ndefendants must produce evidence proving failure to exhaust\nin order to carry their burden. If undisputed evidence viewed\n\f                      ALBINO V. BACA                        5\n\nin the light most favorable to the prisoner shows a failure to\nexhaust, a defendant is entitled to summary judgment under\nRule 56. If material facts are disputed, summary judgment\nshould be denied, and the district judge rather than a jury\nshould determine the facts.\n\n    Second, we hold that Albino has satisfied the exhaustion\nrequirement of § 1997e(a). Defendants have failed to prove\nthat administrative remedies were available at the jail where\nAlbino was confined. Because no administrative remedies\nwere available, he is excused from any obligation to exhaust\nunder § 1997e(a). We therefore direct the district court to\ngrant summary judgment to Albino on the issue of\nexhaustion.\n\n          I. Background and Proceedings Below\n\n    Albino proceeded pro se in the district court. The\nfollowing narrative is based largely on the evidence submitted\nto the district court by both parties. It is based partly on\nallegations in Albino’s verified first amended complaint that\nare uncontradicted by evidence in the record. Except where\notherwise noted, the narrative is based on undisputed\nevidence.\n\n    Glendale Police officers arrested Albino for rape under\nCalifornia Penal Code § 261(a)(1). He was not arrested for\na sexual crime against a minor. After his arrest, Albino was\nbrought to the Los Angeles County Men’s Central Jail. He\nalleges that when he arrived at the jail on May 11, 2006,\ndeputies refused to place him in protective custody. Instead,\nthey placed him in the general population of a high-medium\nsecurity housing unit. Albino is 5 feet 3 inches tall. At the\ntime, he weighed 123 pounds.\n\f6                     ALBINO V. BACA\n\n    Albino alleges in his complaint that on June 16, 2006, an\ninmate approached him and said, “[T]he deputy said you\ncommitted sex acts with children.” A group of several\ninmates then attacked Albino, beating him unconscious,\ncutting him severely, and raping him. Albino reported the\nassault to Deputy Jaquez, who wrote up an “Incident Report”\ndated June 17. Despite the one-day disparity in dates, it is\nclear that Albino’s complaint and Deputy Jaquez’s report deal\nwith the same incident. Deputy Jaquez wrote that Albino\n“was holding a white piece of cloth over his right jaw and\nwas bleeding profusely. He also had multiple cuts and\nredness throughout his entire facial area and he complained\nof pain to his face.” Albino had “two lacerations\napproximately 6 [inches] in length across the side of his right\ncheek. . . . He also had multiple cuts and redness around his\nright eye.” The lacerations were deep cuts in the form of a\ncross. Albino also suffered broken teeth, broken ribs, a\nbroken shoulder, and damage to his hip.\n\n    Deputy Jaquez wrote in his report that Albino recounted\nto him that he had told several inmates that he was in jail for\nrape, but that it had been his partner who had raped a sixteen-\nyear-old girl. Deputy Jaquez identified Albino’s attackers,\nincluding an inmate named Rodriguez. Deputy Jaquez wrote\nthat he spoke to Rodriguez, who admitted to having been one\nof those who had beaten Albino. Deputy Jaquez wrote that\nRodriguez told him that “Albino . . . came in last night\nbragging about that he had raped a girl.”\n\n     Albino was taken to the hospital for treatment. When he\nreturned from the hospital, Albino again asked to be placed\nin protective custody. He states in a declaration, “After the\nfirst attack, I pleaded with many staff members for help but\n\f                       ALBINO V. BACA                           7\n\nthe only thing anyone told me was; it is your attorneys [sic]\njob to protect me.” Albino states in another declaration:\n\n        Of the ap[p]rox. 10 or so times plaintiff\n        begged defendant custodial deputies to be\n        placed in segregation or for the[m] to help me,\n        defendants[] responded that it was my\n        attorney’s job to protect me. As these were\n        sworn peace officers, I was of the belief that\n        I had to seek my trial attorney’s help.\n\n    Despite Albino’s pleas, deputies did not place him in\nprotective custody upon his return from the hospital. Instead,\nthey placed him in a different general-population housing\nunit. Sometime in mid-July, two inmates in the new unit\nattacked Albino, punching and kicking him “numerous\ntimes.” Albino reported this second attack to Deputy\nEspinosa. This time Albino did not identify his attackers. In\nhis “Incident Report,” Deputy Espinosa wrote, “Swelling\nunder his left eye, swelling to his left side of his forehead, and\nswelling to his right temple.” Albino was taken to the jail\nclinic rather than the hospital. He alleges in his complaint\nthat some of the wounds from the first attack had been\nopened, and that his treatment at the clinic consisted only of\npain medication.\n\n    Albino alleges in his complaint that after the second\nattack he again requested protective custody, but a deputy\ntold him it “wasn’t needed.” The deputy instead placed him\nin yet a third general-population housing unit. In September\n2006, Albino was assaulted a third time. He was taken to the\njail clinic. He alleges that he suffered “damage to old\nwounds, including plaintiff’s right eye.”\n\f8                       ALBINO V. BACA\n\n    As a result of these attacks, Albino has suffered severe\nnerve damage on the right side of his face. He has also lost\nhearing in his right ear and most of the vision in his right eye.\nHe now uses a hearing aid and a cane for the blind. He states\nin his declaration:\n\n        My trial attorney had to ask the court for 3\n        court orders to get me any medical care for\n        my injuries, and dental care. It was not until\n        I arrived at CDCR [California Department of\n        Corrections and Rehabilitation] that [I\n        received] a proper Examination, [and] the\n        doctor told me it was too late to repair the\n        nerve damage.\n\n    Albino states in a declaration filed in the district court that\nhe was given no orientation when he was brought to the jail,\nthat he never saw a manual describing complaint procedures,\nthat he never saw complaint forms or a complaint box, and\nthat when he complained and asked for help he was\nconsistently told by deputies at the jail that he should talk to\nhis attorney.\n\n    Defendants provided a declaration by Deputy Jason Ford,\nto which he attaches a copy of “Custody Division Manual\n§ 5-12/010.00 ‘Inmate Complaints.’” They also provided a\ndeclaration in which Deputy Kevin Kelley describes the\ncomplaint process in the jail, describes complaint boxes and\ntheir placement, and recounts the manner in which complaint\nforms are made available.\n\n    Defendants moved for summary judgment. They\ncontended that Albino had failed to exhaust his remedies at\nthe jail system prior to filing suit, as required by 42 U.S.C.\n\f                     ALBINO V. BACA                        9\n\n§ 1997e(a). In the alternative, they contended on the merits\nthat Albino had failed to show any constitutional violations.\nAlbino did not cross-move for summary judgment.\n\n    In his Report and Recommendation, the magistrate judge\nrecommended granting summary judgment to defendants on\nthe ground that defendants had “an accessible administrative\nprocedure for seeking redress of grievances,” and that Albino\ndid not exhaust his remedies under that procedure. The\ndistrict court accepted the recommendation of the magistrate\njudge and granted summary judgment to defendants. The\ncourt dismissed Albino’s complaint without prejudice for\nfailure to exhaust. Neither the magistrate judge nor the\ndistrict court reached the merits of Albino’s claims.\n\n    A three-judge panel of this court affirmed, treating the\ndefendants’ summary judgment motion with respect to\nexhaustion as an unenumerated Rule 12(b) motion. Albino v.\nBaca, 697 F.3d 1023, 1029–30 (9th Cir. 2012). We vacated\nthe panel decision and granted rehearing en banc. Albino v.\nBaca, 709 F.3d 994 (9th Cir. 2013). We now reverse.\n\n                  II. Standard of Review\n\n    We review de novo a district court’s grant of summary\njudgment. Whitman v. Mineta, 541 F.3d 929, 931 (9th Cir.\n2008). A grant of summary judgment is appropriate when\n“there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the\nmovant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 56(a). In our de novo review of a district court’s\nsummary judgment ruling, we view the evidence in the light\nmost favorable to the non-moving party. San Diego Police\nOfficers’ Ass’n v. San Diego City Emps.’ Ret. Sys., 568 F.3d\n725, 733 (9th Cir. 2009).\n\f10                    ALBINO V. BACA\n\n                       III. Discussion\n\n    We decide two questions. First, we hold that an\nunenumerated motion under Rule 12(b) is not the appropriate\nprocedural device for pretrial determination of whether\nadministrative remedies have been exhausted under the\nPLRA. See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). To the extent evidence in\nthe record permits, the appropriate device is a motion for\nsummary judgment under Rule 56. If summary judgment is\nnot appropriate, the district judge may decide disputed\nquestions of fact in a preliminary proceeding. Second, we\nhold that defendants are not entitled to summary judgment\nthat Albino failed to exhaust available administrative\nremedies. Further, we hold sua sponte that Albino is entitled\nto summary judgment that there were no available\nadministrative remedies at the jail within the meaning of the\nPLRA, and that he therefore satisfied § 1997e(a)’s exhaustion\nrequirement.\n\n     A. Summary Judgment or Unenumerated Rule 12(b)\n\n    In holding that the proper procedural device for\ndefendants to raise an exhaustion defense is an unenumerated\nRule 12(b) motion, the panel followed our decision in Wyatt\nv. Terhune, 315 F.3d 1108 (9th Cir. 2003). Wyatt is a PLRA\nprison-conditions case in which we held that “the failure to\nexhaust nonjudicial remedies that are not jurisdictional should\nbe treated as a matter in abatement, which is subject to an\nunenumerated Rule 12(b) motion rather than a motion for\nsummary judgment.” Id. at 1119. After we decided Wyatt,\nthe Supreme Court held in Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199\n(2007), that exhaustion under § 1997e(a) is an affirmative\ndefense that must be pled and proved by a defendant. Id. at\n216. In reaching this conclusion, the Court wrote that “courts\n\f                       ALBINO V. BACA                        11\n\nshould generally not depart from the usual practice under the\nFederal Rules on the basis of perceived policy concerns.” Id.\nat 212. “[T]he PLRA’s screening requirement does\nnot—explicitly or implicitly—justify deviating from the usual\nprocedural practice beyond the departures specified by the\nPLRA itself.” Id. at 214.\n\n    The Court in Jones cited our decision in Wyatt\napprovingly for its conclusion that PLRA exhaustion is an\naffirmative defense, but it did not comment on our use of an\nunenumerated Rule 12(b) motion for determining whether\nadministrative remedies had been exhausted. Id. at 204 n.2.\nWhile Wyatt’s use of an unenumerated Rule 12(b) motion is\nconsistent with PLRA’s purpose of limiting prisoner litigation\nby screening cases at the outset of the litigation, see id. at\n202, it is in tension with the Court’s admonition in Jones\nagainst deviating from “the usual practice under the Federal\nRules.” Id. at 212. The very phrase we used in Wyatt—“an\nunenumerated Rule 12(b) motion”—is a concession that such\na motion is not contemplated by the rules. We conclude that\nWyatt is no longer good law after Jones (if it ever was good\nlaw), and that we should treat an exhaustion defense under\nthe PLRA within the framework of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure.\n\n    In a few cases, a prisoner’s failure to exhaust may be clear\nfrom the face of the complaint. However, such cases will be\nrare because a plaintiff is not required to say anything about\nexhaustion in his complaint. As the Court wrote in Jones,\n“failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense under the PLRA,\nand . . . inmates are not required to specially plead or\ndemonstrate exhaustion in their complaints.” Id. at 216. But\nin those rare cases where a failure to exhaust is clear from the\nface of the complaint, a defendant may successfully move to\n\f12                     ALBINO V. BACA\n\ndismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. See\nid. at 215–16; Scott v. Kuhlmann, 746 F.2d 1377, 1378 (9th\nCir. 1984) (per curiam) (“[A]ffirmative defenses may not be\nraised by motion to dismiss, but this is not true when, as here,\nthe defense raises no disputed issues of fact.” (citation\nomitted)); Aquilar-Avellaveda v. Terrell, 478 F.3d 1223, 1225\n(10th Cir. 2007) (“[O]nly in rare cases will a district court be\nable to conclude from the face of the complaint that a\nprisoner has not exhausted his administrative remedies and\nthat he is without a valid excuse.”).\n\n    In a typical PLRA case, a defendant will have to present\nprobative evidence—in the words of Jones, to “plead and\nprove”—that the prisoner has failed to exhaust available\nadministrative remedies under § 1997e(a). Jones, 549 U.S.\nat 204. The procedure under which a defendant must do so is\nprovided by the Federal Rules. The general outlines of that\nprocedure, applicable to all civil cases, are well understood.\nIf the evidence permits, the defendant may move for\nsummary judgment under Rule 56. If there is a genuine\ndispute about material facts, summary judgment will not be\ngranted.\n\n    The Court in Jones cautioned that we should not alter the\nordinary procedural practices and rules in order to serve the\npolicy aims of the PLRA. Id. at 214. At the same time,\nhowever, the Court recognized that “the PLRA mandates\nearly judicial screening of prisoner complaints and requires\nprisoners to exhaust prison grievance procedures before filing\nsuit.” Id. at 202. A rule requiring exhaustion of prescribed\nadministrative remedies “serves the twin purposes of\nprotecting administrative agency authority and promoting\njudicial efficiency.” McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. 140,\n145 (1992), superseded by statute on other grounds as stated\n\f                       ALBINO V. BACA                          13\n\nin Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731, 740–41 (2001). Courts\nhave exercised substantial discretion in fashioning exhaustion\nrules, though “appropriate deference to Congress’ power to\nprescribe the basic procedural scheme . . . requires fashioning\nof exhaustion principles in a manner consistent with\ncongressional intent.” Id. at 144.\n\n    The Court recognized in Jones that the exhaustion\nquestion in PLRA cases should be decided as early as\nfeasible. We conclude, consistent with Jones as well as with\nnon-PLRA cases, that exhaustion is analogous to subject-\nmatter jurisdiction, personal jurisdiction, venue, and\nabstention, in that all these matters are typically decided at\nthe outset of the litigation. There are, of course, differences.\nFor example, a defect in subject-matter jurisdiction, unlike a\nfailure to exhaust, is a nonwaivable defect. See Detabali v.\nSt. Luke’s Hosp., 482 F.3d 1199, 1202 (9th Cir. 2007). And\nwhile personal jurisdiction and venue are waivable defects,\nthey are unlike a failure to exhaust in that they merely\nconcern a choice among courts; they do not concern a\nprerequisite to bringing suit in any court. But, broadly\nspeaking, subject-matter jurisdiction, personal jurisdiction,\nvenue, abstention, and exhaustion are all issues of “judicial\nadministration” that are appropriately decided early in the\nproceeding. See, e.g., Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding\nCorp., 303 U.S. 41, 50–51 (1938) (referring to the “long-\nsettled rule of judicial administration that no one is entitled to\njudicial relief for a supposed or threatened injury until the\nprescribed administrative remedy has been exhausted”). In\nthe words of the Seventh Circuit, these are all issues of\n“judicial traffic control.” Pavey v. Conley, 544 F.3d 739, 741\n(7th Cir. 2008).\n\f14                    ALBINO V. BACA\n\n    For the guidance of the district courts in this circuit, we\ndescribe the procedure that we believe will best achieve the\npurposes of the exhaustion doctrine in PLRA cases,\nconsistent with the Federal Rules. The procedure we describe\nis essentially that followed in PLRA cases in the Second,\nThird, Fifth and Seventh Circuits. See Messa v. Goord,\n652 F.3d 305, 308–10 (2d Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (court\ndenied defendants’ motion for summary judgment for failure\nto exhaust; court rather than jury resolved disputed questions\nof fact); Small v. Camden Cnty., 728 F.3d 265, 269–71 (3d\nCir. 2013) (same); Dillon v. Rogers, 596 F.3d 260, 270–73\n(5th Cir. 2010) (same); Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741–42 (court\nrather than jury should resolve disputed questions of fact).\nAll four of these circuits use a motion for summary judgment,\nas opposed to an unenumerated Rule 12(b) motion, to decide\nexhaustion, and all four allow resolution by the judge of\ndisputed factual issues. Now that we have joined these\ncircuits, only the Eleventh Circuit employs an unenumerated\nRule 12(b) motion to decide exhaustion of non-judicial\nremedies in PLRA cases. See Bryant v. Rich, 530 F.3d 1368,\n1374–75 (11th Cir. 2008).\n\n    Exhaustion should be decided, if feasible, before reaching\nthe merits of a prisoner’s claim. If discovery is appropriate,\nthe district court may in its discretion limit discovery to\nevidence concerning exhaustion, leaving until later—if it\nbecomes necessary—discovery directed to the merits of the\nsuit. See Pavey, 544 F.3d at 742. A summary judgment\nmotion made by either party may be, but need not be, directed\nsolely to the issue of exhaustion. If a motion for summary\njudgment is denied, disputed factual questions relevant to\nexhaustion should be decided by the judge, in the same\nmanner a judge rather than a jury decides disputed factual\nquestions relevant to jurisdiction and venue. See McNutt v.\n\f                      ALBINO V. BACA                        15\n\nGen. Motors Acceptance Corp., 298 U.S. 178, 188–90 (1936)\n(subject-matter jurisdiction); Murphy v. Schneider Nat’l, Inc.,\n362 F.3d 1133, 1139–40 (9th Cir. 2004) (venue); Lake v.\nLake, 817 F.2d 1416, 1420 (9th Cir. 1987) (personal\njurisdiction). We reiterate that, if feasible, disputed factual\nquestions relevant to exhaustion should be decided at the very\nbeginning of the litigation.\n\n    If the district judge holds that the prisoner has exhausted\navailable administrative remedies, that administrative\nremedies are not available, or that a prisoner’s failure to\nexhaust available remedies should be excused, the case may\nproceed to the merits. On appeal, we will review the judge’s\nlegal rulings on exhaustion de novo, but we will accept the\njudge’s factual findings on disputed issues of material fact\nunless they are clearly erroneous. See Akhtar v. Mesa,\n698 F.3d 1202, 1209 (9th Cir. 2012); Dillon, 596 F.3d at 273.\nWe agree with the Seventh Circuit that, if a factual finding on\na disputed question is relevant both to exhaustion and to the\nmerits, a judge’s finding made in the course of deciding\nexhaustion is not binding on a jury deciding the merits of the\nsuit. See Pavey, 544 F.3d at 742; cf. Beacon Theatres, Inc. v.\nWestover, 359 U.S. 500, 508–11 (1959).\n\n    We recognize that our use of unenumerated Rule 12(b)\nmotions to decide exhaustion questions has not been limited\nto PLRA cases. See, e.g., Payne v. Peninsula Sch. Dist.,\n653 F.3d 863, 881 (9th Cir. 2011) (en banc) (relying on Wyatt\nin describing procedures to be followed in deciding whether\nnon-judicial remedies under the Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Act had been exhausted); Inlandboatmens Union\nof the Pac. v. Dutra Grp., 279 F.3d 1075, 1078 n.2\n(exhaustion of non-judicial remedies under the Labor\nManagement Relations Act (“LMRA”)); Ritza v. Int’l\n\f16                     ALBINO V. BACA\n\nLongshoremen’s & Warehousemen’s Union, 837 F.2d 365,\n369 (9th Cir. 1988) (per curiam) (LMRA); Stauffer Chem.\nCo. v. FDA, 670 F.2d 106, 108 (9th Cir. 1982) (exhaustion of\nnon-judicial remedies with the Food and Drug\nAdministration); Studio Elec. Technicians Local 728 v. Int’l\nPhotographers of Motion Picture Indus., Local 659, 598 F.2d\n551, 552 n.2 (9th Cir. 1979) (exhaustion of non-judicial\nremedies under the LMRA). In light of the decisions of our\nsister circuits, and of our decision in this case, we believe that\nthe basic procedure outlined here—under which a party may\nmove for summary judgment on the exhaustion question,\nfollowed, if necessary, by a decision by the court on disputed\nquestions of material fact relevant to exhaustion—is\nappropriate in these other contexts as well.\n\n           B. Summary Judgment on Exhaustion\n\n    The PLRA mandates that inmates exhaust all available\nadministrative remedies before filing “any suit challenging\nprison conditions,” including, but not limited to, suits under\n§ 1983. Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 85 (2006). An\ninmate is required to exhaust only available remedies. Booth,\n532 U.S. at 736; Brown v. Valoff, 422 F.3d 926, 936–37 (9th\nCir. 2005). To be available, a remedy must be available “as\na practical matter”; it must be “capable of use; at hand.” Id.\nat 937 (quoting Brown v. Croak, 312 F.3d 109, 113 (3d Cir.\n2002)).\n\n    The Court made clear in Jones that the defendant in a\nPLRA case must plead and prove exhaustion as an\naffirmative defense. In determining the exhaustion burdens\napplicable to PLRA cases, the three-judge panel in this case\ncited the exhaustion burdens applicable to claims under the\nTorture Victim Protection Act (“TVPA”). Albino v. Baca,\n\f                      ALBINO V. BACA                       17\n\n697 F.3d 1023, 1031 (9th Cir. 2012) (citing Hilao v. Estate of\nMarcos, 103 F.3d 767, 778 n.5 (9th Cir. 1996)). We agree\nwith the three-judge panel that the burdens outlined in Hilao\nshould provide the template for the burdens here. We wrote\nin Hilao:\n\n       The legislature’s intended operation of the\n       exhaustion provision [of the TVPA] is set\n       forth with remarkable clarity in the Senate\n       Report:\n\n           ....\n\n           . . . [T]he interpretation of [the exhaustion\n           provision of the TVPA] should be\n           informed by general principles of\n           international law. The procedural practice\n           of international human rights tribunals\n           generally holds that the respondent has\n           the burden of raising the nonexhaustion of\n           remedies as an affirmative defense and\n           must show that domestic remedies exist\n           that the claimant did not use. Once the\n           defendant makes a showing of remedies\n           abroad which have not been exhausted,\n           the burden shifts to the plaintiff to rebut\n           by showing that the local remedies were\n           ineffective, unobtainable, unduly\n           prolonged, inadequate, or obviously futile.\n\n       S. Rep. No. 249 at 9–10.\n\nHilao, 103 F.3d at 778 n.5 (emphasis added).\n\f18                     ALBINO V. BACA\n\n    Transposing Hilao’s approach onto the PLRA, we hold\nthat the defendant’s burden is to prove that there was an\navailable administrative remedy, and that the prisoner did not\nexhaust that available remedy. See id. (“[T]he respondent . . .\nmust show that domestic remedies exist that the claimant did\nnot use.”). Once the defendant has carried that burden, the\nprisoner has the burden of production. That is, the burden\nshifts to the prisoner to come forward with evidence showing\nthat there is something in his particular case that made the\nexisting and generally available administrative remedies\neffectively unavailable to him. See id. (“[T]he burden shifts\nto the plaintiff to rebut by showing that the local remedies\nwere ineffective, unobtainable, unduly prolonged, inadequate,\nor obviously futile.”). However, as required by Jones, the\nultimate burden of proof remains with the defendant.\n\n    Our sister circuits generally agree with this description of\nthe respective burdens. For example, in Westefer v. Snyder,\n422 F.3d 570 (7th Cir. 2005), the Seventh Circuit wrote:\n\n        [A]s this case comes to us, we find the record\n        hopelessly unclear . . . whether any\n        administrative remedy remained open for the\n        prisoners to challenge their transfers through\n        the grievance process. . . . IDOC failed to\n        meet its burden of proving that [the prisoners]\n        failed to exhaust an available administrative\n        remedy . . . .\n\nId. at 580 (internal quotation marks omitted). In Tuckel v.\nGrover, 660 F.3d 1249 (10th Cir. 2011), the Tenth Circuit\nsimilarly put the burden on defendants to prove that the\nprisoner did not use existing and generally available\nadministrative remedies. Once that was proved, however,\n\f                      ALBINO V. BACA                        19\n\n“the onus [fell] on the plaintiff to show that [these] remedies\nwere unavailable to him as a result of intimidation by prison\nofficials.” Id. at 1254; see also Turner v. Burnside, 541 F.3d\n1077, 1082 (11th Cir. 2008); Foulk v. Charrier, 262 F.3d 687,\n697 (8th Cir. 2001).\n\n    We have considered in several PLRA cases whether an\nadministrative remedy was “available.” In Nunez v. Duncan,\n591 F.3d 1217 (9th Cir. 2010), we held that where a prison\nwarden incorrectly implied that an inmate needed access to a\nnearly unobtainable prison policy in order to bring a timely\nadministrative appeal, “the Warden’s mistake rendered\nNunez’s administrative remedies effectively unavailable.” Id.\nat 1226. In Sapp v. Kimbrell, 623 F.3d 813 (9th Cir. 2010),\nwe held that where prison officials declined to reach the\nmerits of a particular grievance “for reasons inconsistent with\nor unsupported by applicable regulations,” administrative\nremedies were “effectively unavailable.” Id. at 823–24. In\nMarella v. Terhune, 568 F.3d 1024 (9th Cir. 2009) (per\ncuriam), we reversed a district court’s dismissal of a PLRA\ncase for failure to exhaust because the inmate did not have\naccess to the necessary grievance forms within the prison’s\ntime limits for filing a grievance. Id. at 1027–28. We also\nnoted that Marella was not required to exhaust a remedy that\nhe had been reliably informed was not available to him. Id.\nat 1027.\n\n    In the case now before us, defendants conducted all the\ndiscovery that they considered necessary, including taking\nAlbino’s deposition. They then moved for summary\njudgment, even though not required to do so under our then-\ngoverning precedent, contending that Albino failed to exhaust\navailable administrative remedies. In the alternative, if\nAlbino had successfully exhausted, they contended that\n\f20                     ALBINO V. BACA\n\nAlbino’s claims failed on the merits. The magistrate judge\nrecommended, and the district court granted, summary\njudgment to the defendants on the issue of exhaustion. The\ndistrict court did not reach the merits of Albino’s claims.\n\n    We hold that the district court erred in granting summary\njudgment to defendants on the issue of exhaustion. We\nfurther hold that Albino is entitled to summary judgment on\nthat issue.\n\n    We discuss in a moment our reasons for so holding, but\nwe first address the contention of our dissenting colleagues\nthat we have improperly “ignore[d] the ‘clearly erroneous’\nstandard of review in reviewing the district court’s findings.”\nDiss. Op. at 30–31. Our dissenting colleagues misunderstand\nthe procedural posture of this case. The district court granted\nsummary judgment to the defendants. It is black-letter law\nthat in granting summary judgment a district court cannot\nresolve disputed questions of material fact; rather, that court\nmust view all of the facts in the record in the light most\nfavorable to the non-moving party and rule, as a matter of\nlaw, based on those facts. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,\nInc., 477 U.S. 242, 247–50 (1986); United States v. Diebold,\nInc., 369 U.S. 654, 655 (1962) (per curiam). On appeal, we\nreview de novo a district court’s ruling on a summary\njudgment motion. Whitman, 541 F.3d at 931. Like the\ndistrict court, we cannot resolve any disputed questions of\nmaterial fact; rather, like the district court, we must view all\nof the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving\nparty and rule, as a matter of law, based on those facts. San\nDiego Police Officers’ Ass’n, 568 F.3d at 733.\n\n    Our dissenting colleagues misread our decision in Morton\nv. Hall, 599 F.3d 942 (9th Cir. 2010). Diss. Op. at 34. The\n\f                       ALBINO V. BACA                        21\n\ndistrict court in that case conducted an evidentiary hearing on\nthe question whether Morton, a prisoner, had exhausted his\nadministrative remedies. Id. at 944. Defendants put on two\nwitnesses who testified about administrative procedures at the\nprison, and who testified that they had found no evidence that\nMorton had ever filed a grievance. Morton contended that he\nhad exhausted his administrative remedies, but he put on no\nwitnesses of his own. Id. We wrote, “The district court\nfound that Morton had failed to exhaust administrative\nremedies on his § 1983 claims . . . and dismissed those claims\nwithout prejudice.” Id. We concluded, “On this record, the\ndistrict court did not commit clear error by finding that\nMorton had failed to exhaust administrative remedies on his\n§ 1983 assault claim.” Id. at 945. Contrary to the contention\nof our dissenting colleagues, there is no indication in Morton\nthat we thought we were reviewing a summary judgment by\nthe district court on issue of exhaustion. And there is not so\nmuch as a hint in Morton that we thought we were changing\nour summary judgment procedure, such that we were required\nto review for clear error the district court’s understanding, on\nsummary judgment, of the facts viewed in the light most\nfavorable to the non-moving party.\n\n    Our dissenting colleagues contend that in this case we\nmust review for clear error the district court’s understanding\nof the facts because that court “did decide disputed factual\nissues.” Diss. Op. at 34. We disagree that we must review\nfor clear error the district court’s understanding of the facts.\nThe district court was explicit in stating that it was deciding\na motion for summary judgment. Because the district court\nwas deciding a motion for summary judgment, it could not\ndecide disputed issues of material fact; and because it could\nnot decide any disputed issue of material fact, we are not\n\f22                   ALBINO V. BACA\n\nrequired (or even allowed) to review its understanding of the\nfacts for clear error.\n\n    Defendants introduced two declarations specifically\ndirected to exhaustion. First, Deputy Ford provided a\ndeclaration to which he attached a copy of Custody Division\nManual § 5-12/010.00, titled “Inmate Complaints.” This\nportion of the Manual is four and a half pages long, single-\nspaced. It sets out in some detail the administrative\nprocedures to be followed in processing prisoner complaints.\nAmong other things, the Manual provides:\n\n       Each unit commander shall designate a\n       supervisor, at the permanent rank of sergeant\n       or above, to assume the collateral duty of\n       Inmate Complaint Coordinator. The unit\n       commander shall also ensure that each\n       housing unit within the facility has an\n       adequate supply of Inmate Complaint Forms\n       available, and that the inmates have\n       unrestricted access to the forms. All inmates\n       are permitted to report a complaint, whether\n       or not it is written on the specified form.\n       Each housing area shall have a locked\n       repository accessible to inmates, where they\n       are allowed to deposit their completed forms\n       without interference.\n\n    Second, Deputy Kelley provided a declaration in which\nhe states:\n\n          I have personal knowledge of the policies\n       and procedures in place regarding inmate\n       complaints/grievances at Men’s Central Jail as\n\f                      ALBINO V. BACA                       23\n\n       of the time of the incidents alleged in the First\n       Amended Complaint.\n\n           At Men’s Central Jail, inmates are given\n       access to Inmate Complaint Forms to fill out,\n       or they may submit a written complaint of any\n       kind, to address any number of issues,\n       including but not limited to personnel\n       conduct, medical care, classification actions\n       and conditions of confinement. The Inmate\n       Complaint Forms are available at various\n       locations within the facility, and an adequate\n       supply is maintained and available for any\n       inmate who requests them.\n\n           Inmates may place their complaints in a\n       locked complaint box, or give them directly to\n       the staff.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n    For his part, Albino provided a declaration in which he\nstates:\n\n           At no time during my stay was I\n       interviewed by jail staff, or given any type of\n       orientation. . . .\n\n           At no time during my stay at the jail did I\n       see a LASD Custody Division Manual § 5-\n       12/010.00, or if I did it was not in Spanish\n       where I could read and understand what it\n       was. I have never seen or heard of a LASD\n       Jail complaint form.\n\f24                    ALBINO V. BACA\n\n           ....\n\n          I never seen [sic] a complaint box, and no\n       one told me of such a complaint box.\n\n           . . . After the first attack, I pleaded with\n       many staff members for help but the only\n       thing anyone told me was; it is your\n       attorney[’]s job to protect me.\n\n           ....\n\n            During the 10 or so times I begged\n       officers to be placed in segregation. Not one\n       officer or staff member handed me a\n       complaint form or a rule book and told me to\n       fill out the form and they would put it in a\n       box. All any of the staff told me was my\n       public defender[’]s job to protect me. My\n       public defender also never informed me of a\n       LASD complaint form.\n\n    The Custody Division Manual, with its section dedicated\nto “Inmate Complaints,” is of little help to defendants.\nDefendants have conceded that the Manual was a personnel\nmanual that was available only to jail employees. Prisoners,\nincluding Albino, were not given access to the Manual.\nIndeed, so far as the record shows, inmates were not even told\nof the existence of the Manual.\n\n    Deputy Kelley’s declaration is hardly more helpful. He\nstates that an “adequate supply” of Inmate Complaint Forms\nis “maintained,” and that they are “available for any inmate\nwho requests them” (emphasis added). The clear implication\n\f                       ALBINO V. BACA                        25\n\nof Deputy Kelley’s statement is that the forms are available\nonly on request; that is, they are not placed where inmates\nmay see and take them on their own. Further, there is nothing\nin Deputy Kelley’s statement indicating that inmates are told\nthat a complaint must be in writing, or that a written\ncomplaint, even if not on an official form, will be considered.\nFinally, Deputy Kelley declares that inmates may place their\ncomplaints in a “locked complaint box,” but he does not\ndescribe the box or its location in the unit. Nor, indeed, does\nhe say that the box is labeled in any way to indicate its\nfunction. When pressed at oral argument, defendants’\nattorney rested on Deputy Kelley’s declaration, even though\nhe was obliged to concede that Deputy Kelley did not say\nwhere the complaint box was placed or whether there was\nanything written on the outside of the box.\n\n    Thus, so far as the record shows, there is a personnel\nmanual describing a complaint process, but the manual is not\navailable, or even known, to the prisoners. There are also\n“locked complaint boxes” located somewhere in the prison\nwhere, we may infer from Deputy Kelley’s declaration,\nprisoners have access to them. But there is nothing in the\nrecord to indicate that the boxes have anything written on\nthem to signify their purpose, or that prisoners are otherwise\nadvised of their purpose or location. Deputy Kelley states\nthat a written complaint may be “give[n] directly to staff,” but\nthere is nothing in the record to indicate that inmates are told\nthat a complaint must be in writing in order to be considered.\nFinally, we may infer from Deputy Kelley’s declaration that\ncomplaint forms are available only if a prisoner knows to\nrequest them.\n\n   Albino declares, without contradiction, the following. He\ndeclares that he was never given any orientation at the jail,\n\f26                     ALBINO V. BACA\n\nduring which he could have been informed of a complaint\nprocess. He also declares that he has never seen the jail’s\npersonnel manual, a complaint box, or a complaint form.\nFinally, he declares that he repeatedly sought, and was\ndenied, help from the prison staff. Specifically, he declares\nthat he repeatedly complained “directly to the staff” (to use\nDeputy Kelley’s words) that he needed to be placed in\nprotective custody. Staff members never told him that\ncomplaint forms were “available for any inmate who requests\nthem” (again to use Deputy Kelley’s words), and they never\nconstrued Albino’s complaints as requests for such forms.\nNor did staff members tell Albino that he could put in a\ncomplaint box, or give directly to them, a written complaint,\neven if not on an official form. Instead, staff members\nrepeatedly told Albino that he should seek relief by talking to\nhis criminal defense attorney.\n\n    As we noted above, failure to exhaust administrative\nremedies is an affirmative defense that the defendant must\nplead and prove in a PLRA case. Jones, 549 U.S. at 212.\nViewing all of the evidence in the light most favorable to\nAlbino, we conclude as a matter of law that defendants have\nfailed to carry their initial burden of proving their affirmative\ndefense that there was an available administrative remedy\nthat Albino failed to exhaust. We therefore reverse the\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment to defendants on\nthe issue of exhaustion.\n\n    Albino, acting pro se, did not make a cross-motion for\nsummary judgment. However, we conclude he would have\nsucceeded had he made such a motion. We therefore direct\nsua sponte that summary judgment be granted to Albino on\nthe issue of exhaustion.\n\f                       ALBINO V. BACA                        27\n\n    We have long recognized that, where the party moving for\nsummary judgment has had a full and fair opportunity to\nprove its case, but has not succeeded in doing so, a court may\nenter summary judgment sua sponte for the nonmoving party.\nSee, e.g., Cool Fuel, Inc. v. Connett, 685 F.2d 309, 311 (9th\nCir. 1982); see also Gospel Missions of Am. v. City of Los\nAngeles, 328 F.3d 548, 553 (9th Cir. 2003) (“Even when\nthere has been no cross-motion for summary judgment, a\ndistrict court may enter summary judgment sua sponte against\na moving party if the losing party has had a ‘full and fair\nopportunity to ventilate the issues involved in the matter.’”)\n(quoting Cool Fuel, Inc., 685 F.2d at 312). The Supreme\nCourt implicitly recognized this authority in Celotex Corp. v.\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317 (1986), noting that “district courts are\nwidely acknowledged to possess the power to enter summary\njudgments sua sponte, so long as the losing party was on\nnotice that she had to come forward with all of her evidence.”\nId. at 326. The authority to grant summary judgment sua\nsponte was made explicit in the current version of Rule 56,\neffective as of December 2010. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f).\n\n     If the record is sufficiently developed to permit the trial\ncourt to consider summary judgment, ant if the court finds\nthat when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\na moving party the movant has not shown a genuine dispute\nof fact on the issue of exhaustion, it may be appropriate for\nthe district court to grant summary judgment sua sponte for\nthe nonmovant on this issue. See 10A Charles A. Wright,\nArthur R. Miller & Mary K. Kane, Federal Practice and\nProcedure § 2720, at 351–52 (3d ed. 1998) (“[T]he practice\nof allowing summary judgment to be entered for the\nnonmoving party in the absence of a formal cross-motion is\nappropriate. It is in keeping with the objective of Rule 56 to\nexpedite the disposition of cases . . . .”). Before sua sponte\n\f28                    ALBINO V. BACA\n\nsummary judgment against a party is proper, that party “must\nbe given reasonable notice that the sufficiency of his or her\nclaim will be in issue: Reasonable notice implies adequate\ntime to develop the facts on which the litigant will depend to\noppose summary judgment.” Buckingham v. United States,\n998 F.2d 735, 742 (9th Cir. 1993) (citation and internal\nquotation marks omitted). Similarly, in Kassbaum v.\nSteppenwolf Productions, Inc., 236 F.3d 487 (9th Cir. 2000),\nwe noted that “if a court concludes that a non-moving party\nis entitled to judgment, ‘great care must be exercised to\nassure that the original movant has had an adequate\nopportunity to show that there is a genuine issue and that his\n[or her] opponent is not entitled to judgment as a matter of\nlaw.’” Id. at 494 (quoting Ramsey v. Coughlin, 94 F.3d 71, 74\n(2d Cir. 1996)). We further noted that “we should not reverse\na summary judgment and order judgment for a non-moving\nparty based on an issue that the movant had no opportunity to\ndispute in the district court.” Id. at 495.\n\n    We conclude that the concerns expressed in Buckingham\nand Kassbaum have been satisfied in a case such as this one,\nwhere, after having had a full opportunity to gather evidence,\na defendant moves for summary judgment based on a failure\nto exhaust under the PLRA. As the movants for summary\njudgment in this case, defendants were on notice of the need\nto come forward with all their evidence in support of this\nmotion, and they had every incentive to do so. Defendants\nhad ample opportunity to conduct discovery and to provide\nevidence to carry their burden of proof that administrative\nremedies were available. There is nothing in the record to\nsuggest that defendants’ discovery with respect to exhaustion\nwas curtailed in any way. Indeed, most of the relevant\nevidence was within their knowledge and control. In other\n\f                      ALBINO V. BACA                        29\n\nwords, defendants “had a full and fair opportunity to ventilate\nthe issues involved.” Cool Fuel, Inc., 685 F.2d at 312.\n\n    Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\ndefendants, defendants have failed to show a genuine dispute\nas to whether administrative remedies in the jail were\navailable. Albino was beaten several times and repeatedly\ncomplained orally to deputies in the jail, asking repeatedly to\nbe placed in protective custody. The jail had a manual\ndescribing a procedure for handling inmate complaints, but\nthis manual was for staff use only and was not made available\nto inmates. An “adequate supply” of Inmate Complaint\nForms was kept “at various locations” within the jail. But\nsuch forms had to be requested by an inmate and were never\nprovided to Albino, despite his repeated complaints. Nor was\nAlbino told that he could write a complaint on an ordinary\npiece of paper and hand it to one of the deputies. Instead,\nAlbino was told that it was his criminal defense attorney’s\njob to protect him from attacks in the jail. In these\ncircumstances, we conclude as a matter of law that defendants\nhave not carried their burden of proving that the jail provided\nan “available” administrative remedy.\n\n                         Conclusion\n\n    We reverse the district court’s grant of summary\njudgment for defendants and remand with instructions to\nenter summary judgment for Albino on the issue of\nexhaustion.\n\n   REVERSED and REMANDED.\n\f30                     ALBINO V. BACA\n\nN.R. SMITH, Circuit Judge, joined by TALLMAN and\nIKUTA, Circuit Judges, dissenting:\n\n    Albino is a sympathetic plaintiff. However, that fact\nshould not excuse Albino from his duty to exhaust available\nadministrative remedies, while other sympathetic plaintiffs\nare required to exhaust.\n\n    The Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1996 (PLRA)\nprovides that “[n]o action shall be brought with respect to\nprison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other\nFederal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or\nother correctional facility until such administrative remedies\nas are available are exhausted.” 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a).\n“Available” means “capable of use for the accomplishment of\na purpose,” and that which “is accessible or may be\nobtained.” Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731, 737 (2001)\n(quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary 150\n(1993)). Recently, the Supreme Court instructed us to adhere\nclosely to the plain language of the statute and not interpolate\nour policy concerns into the statute. Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S.\n199, 212, 216-17 (2007).\n\n    Here, the district court found administrative remedies that\nthe County of Los Angeles offered in the jail were “capable\nof use” and could be obtained. Therefore, Albino had the\nobligation to exhaust these remedies before he could bring an\naction. The majority excuses Albino from that duty and\ninstead places an affirmative duty on prison officials to\ninform inmates about the administrative remedies available.\nNothing in the plain language of the PLRA even suggests that\nprison officials have the duties that the majority places upon\nthem today. In other words, in order to afford relief to a\nsympathetic plaintiff, the majority takes extraordinary steps\n\f                      ALBINO V. BACA                        31\n\nand (1) ignores the “clearly erroneous” standard of review in\nreviewing the district court’s findings; (2) mandates the\nproduction of unprecedented evidence in order for the\ndefendants to meet their burden of proof on exhaustion;\n(3) grants summary judgment to the plaintiff sua sponte,\nwithout allowing the defendants the opportunity to produce\nthe newly mandated evidence; and (4) changes the procedure\nby which our courts determine whether a plaintiff has\nexhausted administrative remedies. Because the majority’s\ninterpretation and application of the PLRA in this case\ndeviates from the approach required by the Supreme Court\nand creates a circuit split with the Eighth and Tenth Circuits,\nI must dissent.\n\n                              I.\n\n    The majority rightly adopts the burden shifting\nframework for administrative exhaustion disputes applied in\nHilao v. Estate of Marcos, 103 F.3d 767, 778 n.5 (9th Cir.\n1996). Maj. op. at 17. When a defendant alleges a failure to\nexhaust, it “has the burden of raising the nonexhaustion of\nremedies as an affirmative defense and must show that . . .\nremedies exist that the claimant did not use.” Maj. op. at 17.\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Once a defendant shows\nthat nonexhausted remedies exist, the plaintiff must show that\nthe administrative remedies were unavailable to him. See\nHilao, 103 F.3d at 778 n.5.\n\n    Applying this burden shifting framework to all of the\nevidence presented by both parties, the magistrate judge\nfound that Baca met his burden. The court supported its\nconclusion with the following factual findings: (1) a\ngrievance procedure existed at the Jail; (2) the procedure was\naccessible to inmates; and (3) Albino failed to “avail himself\n\f32                     ALBINO V. BACA\n\nof it.” The district court adopted these findings in full. Even\nAlbino concedes that Baca met his burden, as did the\ndissenting panel member of the three-judge panel. Albino v.\nBaca, 697 F.3d 1023, 1039–40 (9th Cir. 2012) (Gilman, J.,\ndissenting) (concluding instead that Albino met his burden of\nestablishing unavailability).\n\n    A district court’s factual findings mandate our deference.\nThe majority writes, “[D]isputed factual questions relevant to\nexhaustion should be decided by the judge.” Maj. op. at 14.\n“[W]e will accept the judge’s factual findings . . . unless they\nare clearly erroneous.” Maj. op. at 15. This clear error\nstandard “does not entitle a reviewing court to reverse the\nfinding of the trier of fact simply because it is convinced that\nit would have decided the case differently. . . . Where there\nare two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder’s\nchoice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.” Anderson\nv. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573–74 (1985)\n(emphasis added); see also United States v. Hinkson,\n585 F.3d 1247, 1260 (9th Cir. 2009) (“[O]ur review of a\nfactual finding may not look to what we would have done had\nwe been in the trial court’s place in the first instance, because\nthat review would be de novo and without deference.”). The\nclear error standard of review “is significantly deferential” to\nthe district court. Lentini v. Cal. Ctr. for the Arts, Escondido,\n370 F.3d 837, 843 (9th Cir. 2004). As a result, a trial court’s\nfactual findings must be upheld when “fall[ing] within any of\nthe permissible choices the court could have made.” Hinkson,\n585 F.3d at 1261.\n\n    In declining to defer to the district court’s factual findings\nin this case, however, the majority contends that “[i]t is\nblack-letter law that in granting summary judgment a district\ncourt cannot resolve disputed questions of material fact.”\n\f                       ALBINO V. BACA                        33\n\nMaj. op. at 20. Because, in its view, the district court found\nonly undisputed facts, it owes those findings no deference.\nSee id. In so holding, it misunderstands the issue of\nexhaustion and the district court’s role as factfinder.\n\n    Even when a nonexhaustion allegation is raised in a\nsummary judgment motion, “we review the district\ncourt’s . . . factual findings for clear error.” Morton v. Hall,\n599 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir. 2010). Because the general\nsummary judgment standard is designed to determine whether\nthere “is sufficient evidence favoring the nonmoving party for\na jury to return a verdict for that party,” Anderson v. Liberty\nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249 (1986), it is inapposite in the\nexhaustion context. Instead, regardless of the form of the\nmotion, district courts have simply decided the issue, and we\nhave deferred to that finding on appeal. See, e.g., Morton,\n599 F.3d at 944–46; Wyatt v. Terhune, 315 F.3d 1108,\n1119–20 (9th Cir. 2003).\n\n    This is so whether the findings pertain to disputed or\nundisputed facts. For instance, in Morton v. Hall, the district\ncourt ruled in favor of a defendant on its motion for summary\njudgment because the defendant had “sustained its burden to\ndemonstrate the Plaintiff . . . did not exhaust his\nadministrative appeals as required.” 455 F. Supp. 2d 1066,\n1075 (C.D. Cal. 2006). The district court’s factual findings,\nupon which it based this decision, were based on evidence not\ndisputed by the plaintiff. Id. at 1075. On appeal, this court\nreviewed the district court’s factual findings and concluded\nthat it “did not commit clear error by finding that Morton had\nfailed to exhaust administrative remedies on his § 1983\nassault claim.” Morton, 599 F.3d at 945 (emphasis added).\nTherefore, the majority’s contention that the presence of\nundisputed facts in this case gives it the right to find its own\n\f34                     ALBINO V. BACA\n\nfacts or attach differing weight to evidence than did the\ndistrict court is without merit. The district court’s factual\nfindings in deciding an exhaustion issue warrant our\ndeference, whether disputed or undisputed.\n\n    Further, the trial court did decide disputed factual issues\nin this case. For example, “[t]he Court [found], based upon\nthe submissions of the parties, that the Los Angeles County\nJail had an accessible administrative procedure for seeking\nredress of grievances at the time of the incidents” despite\nAlibno’s allegations that the Jail never informed him of the\ngrievance procedure. Indeed, only “in light of the Court’s\nfinding that the jail had available administrative remedies,”\nwas it able to conclude that “summary judgment based on\nfailure to exhaust [was] warranted.” Thus, the trial court’s\nconclusion that there was no “genuine issue of material fact\nas to the existence of a grievance procedure at the jail, its\naccessibility to inmates, or Plaintiff’s failure to avail himself\nof it,” was predicated upon its own factual findings to that\neffect. Regardless of the nature of these findings, this court\nmay only overturn them if they are clearly erroneous. Morton,\n599 F.3d at 945.\n\n    The trial court’s factual findings here are supported by\nample evidence in the record. Nevertheless, the majority\nconcludes “as a matter of law” that Baca failed to satisfy his\nburden of proving “that there was an available administrative\nremedy . . . that Albino failed to exhaust.” Id. However, that\nis not what happened here. Rather, the majority\nimpermissibly seizes on facts considered and weighed by the\ndistrict court and arrives at its own conclusion. See Maj. op.\nat 20–26; Anderson, 470 U.S. at 574 (“[T]he court of appeals\nmay not reverse [the district court’s account of the evidence]\n\f                      ALBINO V. BACA                        35\n\neven though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of\nfact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.”).\n\n    The posture of the majority opinion speaks louder than\nthe one sentence purporting to decide the case as a matter of\nlaw. Indeed, the majority develops its own facts to support its\nconclusion that Baca failed to carry his burden. See Maj. op.\nat 20–26. That process is de novo review and conflicts with\nthe Supreme Court’s instruction to accord deference to lower\ncourt findings, Anderson, 470 U.S. at 573–74, and the\nmajority’s own framework, maj. op. at 15. Further, the\nmajority’s factual conclusions are wrong, as it discredits each\npiece of evidence supporting the existence of the Jail’s\ngrievance procedure independently, absent consideration of\nthe process as a whole.\n\n    First, the majority decides the Custody Division Manual\n§ 5-12/010.00 “is of little help to defendants,” because Albino\nnever saw it. Maj. op. at 24. However, Baca did not submit\nthe Custody Division Manual’s grievance procedure to prove\nAlbino was aware of the procedure. He submitted it to\ndocument the existence of the procedure, as affirmed by Jail\npersonnel. See Brown v. Valoff, 422 F.3d 926, 937 (9th Cir.\n2005). Indeed, “it is the prison’s requirements, and not the\nPLRA, that define the boundaries of proper exhaustion.”\nJones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 218 (2007). This section of the\nCustody Division Manual gives credence to the testimony\nthat the grievance procedure existed.\n\n    Next, the majority discredits the availability of the\ngrievance procedure, because Inmate Complaint Forms were\nonly “available for any inmate who requests them.” Maj. op.\nat 24 (quoting Deputy Kelley’s declaration). However, the\nmajority takes the quote out of context. Deputy Kelley’s\n\f36                     ALBINO V. BACA\n\naffirmation also states that “Inmate Complaint Forms are\navailable at various locations within the facility.” Further, the\nmajority fails to recognize that Jail procedures do not require\nthat complaints only be filed on an Inmate Complaint Form\nto be effective—a complaint will be considered so long as it\nis written.\n\n    Third, the majority takes issue with a locked complaint\nbox, decrying Baca’s failure to confirm whether “the box is\nlabeled in any way to indicate its function.” Id. at 25.\nHowever, the majority ignores the fact that a complaint does\nnot even need to be filed in a complaint box—the Jail would\nconsider written complaints handed directly to Jail personnel.\n\n    The correct inquiry would have been to determine\nwhether the district court’s factual findings were “plausible.”\nLentini, 370 F.3d at 850. The evidence strongly supports the\ndistrict court’s factual findings, namely the presence of an\n“available” administrative remedy that Albino failed to\nexhaust. Indeed, it is beyond comprehension how a procedure\nas simple as writing a few words on a piece of paper and\nhanding it to Jail personnel could somehow be “[in]capable\nof use.” Maj. op. at 16. The majority’s de novo review (in an\neffort to conclude otherwise) is inconsistent with governing\nlaw, the majority’s own framework, and conflicts even with\nAlbino’s view of the law and facts. Albino never once argued\nthat Baca failed to satisfy his burden, arguing rather that he\nhad satisfied his own burden of showing how the procedures\nwere effectively unavailable.\n\n                               II.\n\n   The majority shoulders Baca with production of evidence\nnever before required in proving failure to exhaust\n\f                      ALBINO V. BACA                        37\n\nadministrative remedies, focusing on the lack of evidence\nconfronting Albino’s testimony that the Jail never informed\nhim of administrative remedies. Maj. op. at 24 (“[I]nmates\nwere not even told of the existence of the Manual.”); id. at 25\n(“[T]here is nothing in Deputy Kelley’s statement indicating\nthat inmates are told that a complaint must be in writing.”);\nid. at 26 (“Staff members never told him that complaint forms\nwere ‘available for any inmate who requests them.’”); id. at\n29 (“Nor was Albino told that he could write a complaint on\nan ordinary piece of paper and hand it to one of the\ndeputies.”) (emphasis added in each).\n\n    Our prior prisoner exhaustion cases required jail officials\nto prove that they did not “hide the ball” from defendants.\nSee, e.g., Sapp v. Kimbrell, 623 F.3d 813, 823 (9th Cir. 2010)\n(“[I]mproper screening of an inmate’s administrative\ngrievances renders administrative remedies ‘effectively\nunavailable’ such that exhaustion is not required under the\nPLRA.”); Nunez v. Duncan, 591 F.3d 1217, 1224 (9th Cir.\n2010) (excusing inmate’s failure to exhaust, because “he took\nreasonable and appropriate steps to exhaust his . . . claim and\nwas precluded from exhausting, not through his own fault but\nby the Warden’s mistake”); Marella v. Terhune, 568 F.3d\n1024, 1027 (9th Cir. 2009) (per curiam) (excusing inmate’s\nfailure to exhaust, because he pursued some relief but was\ninformed by prison personnel that no remedies were\navailable). Today, the majority requires jail officials prove\nthat, not only did they not hinder a prisoner’s access to\nadministrative remedies, but also that they informed the\nprisoner of them. What comes in the next case to excuse a\nsympathetic plaintiff?\n\n   Albino’s counsel conceded at oral argument that Albino\nnever even asked if there were a grievance procedure.\n\f38                       ALBINO V. BACA\n\nAlthough Albino spoke with his attorney about seeking\nmedical care, the record does not show that he ever raised the\nissue of seeking protective confinement with him. His sole\ncomplaint: the Jail did not inform him of the procedure. As\nBaca’s counsel aptly noted in oral argument, this case boils\ndown to an inmate that alleges “I didn’t see” rather than “I\nlooked and couldn’t find”; that alleges “no one told me”\nrather than “I asked and wasn’t told or was told\nmisinformation.”\n\n    Indeed, neither the PLRA nor the Supreme Court has ever\nimposed such a duty on jail officials (alleging failure to\nexhaust) when the prisoner only alleged ignorance of the\nprocedures; nor have any of the federal courts of appeal.1 To\nthe contrary, the majority’s opinion creates a split with the\nEighth and Tenth Circuits, which have held that such is\nirrelevant to defendants’ burden. See Chelette v. Harris,\n229 F.3d 684, 688 (8th Cir. 2000) (“Section 1997e(a) says\nnothing about a prisoner’s subjective beliefs, logical or\notherwise, about the administrative remedies that might be\navailable to him.”); Yousef v. Reno, 254 F.3d 1214, 1221\n(10th Cir. 2001) (holding that there is “no authority for [the]\nassertion that the [prison] should have advised plaintiff of the\nneed to follow BOP administrative procedures” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)).\n\n    It is no wonder then that Baca did not consider it\nnecessary to confront Albino’s testimony about his alleged\nunawareness of administrative remedies. Instead, litigants in\nthis circuit were presumed to have knowledge of duly enacted\nlaws, regulations, and procedures. See Luna v. Holder,\n\n  1\n    Indeed the majority did not cite a single case to support this novel\nproposition. See Maj. op. at 25.\n\f                            ALBINO V. BACA                                 39\n\n659 F.3d 753, 759 (9th Cir. 2011) (presuming aliens had\nnotice of duly enacted federal regulations and guidelines\nissued thereunder). Grievance procedures in California jails\nare promulgated under the direction of state laws and\nregulations. See Cal. Penal Code § 6030(a); Cal. Code Regs.\ntit. 15, § 1073(a).2\n\n                                     III.\n\n    While our court may grant summary judgment sua sponte\nto a non-moving party, “we should not [do so] based on an\nissue that the movant had no opportunity to dispute in the\ndistrict court.” Kassbaum v Steppenwolf Prods., Inc.,\n236 F.3d 487, 495 (9th Cir. 2000) (citing Fountain v. Filson,\n336 U.S. 681, 683 (1949)). Rather, “great care must be\nexercised to assure that the original movant has had an\nadequate opportunity to show that there is a genuine issue and\nthat his [or her] opponent is not entitled to judgment as a\n\n\n   2\n     Also instructive, the Third Circuit interpreted a statutory exhaustion\nprovision similar to section 1997e(a) and declined to require a union to\ninform union members of grievance procedures in order for the procedures\nto be considered “available” under the exhaustion requirement. Donovan\nv. Local 1235, Int’l Longshoremen’s Ass’n, 715 F.2d 70, 75 (3d Cir. 1983)\n(“The Secretary argues that we can [excuse the failure to exhaust,\nbecause] the union[] fail[ed] to inform its members as to the procedural\nrequirements of its internal remedies. . . . The statute and regulations on\nwhich he relies do not support such a sweeping position. They provide\nonly that the union must make its constitution and bylaws ‘available’ to\nits members.”). See also Hedges v. United States, 404 F.3d 744, 753 (3d\nCir. 2005) (stating that the plaintiff “cites no cases for the proposition that\nthe Government [(in this case the Department of the Interior)] has an\naffirmative duty to inform litigants . . . that they have viable judicial, as\nwell as administrative remedies,” and refusing to “place such a\nresponsibility on the Government which has inquiries from millions of\nindividuals each year”).\n\f40                    ALBINO V. BACA\n\nmatter of law.” Id. at 494 (quoting Ramsey v. Coughlin,\n94 F.3d 71, 74 (2d Cir. 1996)) (alteration in original). In\nKassbaum, the court saw the issues and the law aligning in\nthe non-moving parties favor, but “in the exercise of caution,”\nit still declined to grant summary judgment sua sponte in\nfavor of the non-movant. Id. at 495. The court respected the\nright of the parties to “have notice of [its] decision and an\nopportunity to be heard.” Id.\n\n    The majority fails to exercise such caution here. Instead,\nthe majority mandates the production of evidence never\nbefore necessary for defendants to prove that a plaintiff did\nnot exhaust his administrative remedies. Then, without\nproviding prior notice to Baca or an opportunity to submit\nevidence required under its newly articulated ruling, it grants\nsua sponte summary judgment in Albino’s favor on the\npresent record. The majority’s lip service to the Kassbaum\nstandard is the antithesis of “great care.” 236 F.3d at 494.\n\n    No jail or prison in this circuit had previously been\nobliged to evidence that it had informed prisoners of\nadministrative remedies to show those remedies’ availability.\nLikewise, an inmate’s subjective intent was previously\ninapposite to the inquiry. Thus, without notice, Baca has been\nafforded no opportunity to evidence, for example, (1) that the\nJail actually informed Albino of the Jail’s grievance\nprocedure; (2) the number of inmates filing written\ncomplaints under the present system; or (3) the nature and\nlabeling of the locked complaint box. Before today, Baca had\nno reason to dispute Albino’s factual allegations to the\ncontrary, because the resolution of those allegations was not\nnecessary to resolving a motion for summary judgment for\nfailure to exhaust administrative remedies.\n\f                       ALBINO V. BACA                        41\n\n   Baca is entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard.\nKassbaum, 235 F.3d at 495. Given the new evidence which\na defendant must hereafter produce to demonstrate the\navailability of administrative remedies, granting summary\njudgment sua sponte in favor of Albino is error. See Norse,\n629 F.3d at 972.\n\n                              IV.\n\n    Finally, the majority overrules circuit precedent to\npurportedly effect a “change of nomenclature” without\nchanging the “practical operation” of court procedure dealing\nwith exhaustion issues. Maj. op. at 4. However, if the\nmajority means what it says in the opinion, it effects more\nthan a “change of nomenclature.”\n\n    Our opinion in Wyatt v. Terhune directed courts to treat\na summary judgment motion alleging failure to exhaust\nadministrative remedies “as a matter in abatement, which is\nsubject to an unenumerated Rule 12(b) motion rather than a\nmotion for summary judgment.” 315 F.3d 1108, 1119 (9th\nCir. 2003). Because exhaustion is a matter of judicial\nadministration rather than an issue regarding the merits,\ndistrict courts could “look beyond the pleadings and decide\ndisputed issues of fact.” Sapp, 623 F.3d at 821 (quoting\nWyatt, 315 F.3d at 1119–20). In doing so, the court had\n“broad discretion as to the method to be used in resolving the\nfactual dispute.” Ritza v. Int’l Longshoremen’s and\nWarehousemen’s Union, 837 F.2d 365, 369 (9th Cir. 1988)\n(per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). Then, on\nappeal, our court reviews the dismissal under Rule 12(b) de\nnovo but reviews the district court’s factual findings for clear\nerror. Id.\n\f42                      ALBINO V. BACA\n\n    Under the purported authority of Jones v. Bock, the\nmajority now pens this decision overruling Wyatt. In the\nfuture, an allegation of “failure to exhaust is more\nappropriately handled” as a motion for summary judgment.\nMaj. op. at 4. Then if a factual dispute still persists at\nsummary judgment, the motion must be denied. Id. at 14.\nThen only on the eve of trial (or later) may the district court\ndecide the issue of exhaustion. Id. at 15. “On appeal, we will\nreview the district judge’s legal rulings on exhaustion de\nnovo, but we will accept the judge’s factual findings . . .\nunless they are clearly erroneous.” Id. at 15. This decision is\nparticularly surprising for a number of reasons.\n\n    First, “[a] goal of our circuit’s decisions, including . . . en\nbanc decisions, must be to preserve the consistency of circuit\nlaw.” Miller v. Gammie, 335 F.3d 889, 900 (9th Cir. 2003).\nIn other words, while an en banc panel has the authority to\noverrule circuit precedent, id. at 899, it must have a good\nreason to do so. I question whether a “change of\nnomenclature” constitutes such good reason.\n\n    Second, the Supreme Court cited Wyatt approvingly in\nJones. 549 U.S. at 204 n.2, 212 (holding that circuit courts\ntreating exhaustion as an affirmative defense “have the better\nof the argument”). In light of this favorable citation, the\nmajority’s decision to overrule Wyatt reads too much into\nJones. Instead, it should “abide by the ‘duty of restraint, th[e]\nhumility of function as merely the translator of another’s\ncommand.’” Id. at 216 (quoting Frankfurter, Some Reflections\non the Reading of Statutes, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 527, 533–34\n(1947)) (alteration in original).\n\n   Finally, and most importantly, the Jones Court\nemphasized that “the PLRA mandates early judicial screening\n\f                       ALBINO V.

Carey, 722 F.3d 1177, 1182 (9th Cir. 2013)\n(“Congress enacted the PLRA to . . . provide for [frivolous\nprisoner lawsuits’] dismissal at an early stage.”). This “allows\nprison officials an opportunity to resolve disputes concerning\nthe exercise of their responsibilities before being haled into\ncourt.” Jones, 549 U.S. at 204. Early judicial screening also\nhelps “ensur[e] that the flood of nonmeritorious claims does\nnot submerge and effectively preclude consideration of the\nallegations with merit.” Id. at 203. However, by designating\nsummary judgment as the appropriate procedure in which to\naddress allegations of nonexhaustion, maj. op. at 15, the\nmajority’s new framework will delay resolution of exhaustion\ndisputes. In fact, the majority opinion guarantees it. Only in\n“rare” cases may exhaustion be decided on a motion to\ndismiss. Id. at 4. Then, even a decisive ruling at the summary\njudgment stage will be unlikely, because the district court\ncannot resolve factual disputes relating to exhaustion in\ndeciding the motion for summary judgment. Id. at 5, 15. Only\nafter denying summary judgment may the court then conclude\nwhether a plaintiff has exhausted administrative remedies. Id.\nat 15 Even though the majority has stipulated that exhaustion\nis not a jury issue, id. at 5, its opinion has the effect of\ncommissioning a trial (by the judge) to decide an issue that is\nwidely viewed as one of judicial traffic control. Id. at 14;\nPavey v. Conley, 544 F.3d 739, 741 (7th Cir. 2008). This new\nprocedure is utterly inconsistent with the PLRA, which\n“mandates early judicial screening of prisoner complaints.”\nJones, 549 U.S. at 202.\n\n    In summary, while the majority correctly preserves the\ndistrict court’s ability to make factual findings in determining\nan exhaustion issue and mandates our deference to the district\ncourt’s factual findings on appeal (though it refuses to do so\n\f44                    ALBINO V. BACA\n\nhere), it impermissibly alters the usual procedural practice in\nthis circuit on the basis of perceived policy concerns. See\nJones, 549 U.S. at 212. This alteration eliminates the district\ncourt’s ability to decide the exhaustion issue “at an early\nstage.” Woods, 722 F.3d at 1182. As a result, it effects much\nmore than a “change of nomenclature.” Maj. op. at 4.\n\f",

FLETCHER, Circuit Judge:\n\n     Juan Roberto Albino brought suit against Los Angeles\nCounty Sheriff Lee Baca, several Doe defendants, and Los\nAngeles County, alleging violations of 42 U.S.C. § 1983, as\nwell as several state laws, arising out of injuries Albino\nsuffered while confined in Los Angeles County jail. Albino’s\nclaims are subject to the Prison Litigation Reform Act\n(“PLRA”), which requires that a prisoner challenging prison\nconditions exhaust available administrative remedies before\nfiling suit. 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). Defendants moved for\nsummary judgment based, inter alia, on Albino’s alleged\nfailure to exhaust. The district court granted the motion,\ndismissing Albino’s federal claims without prejudice. The\ncourt also dismissed his state claims without prejudice. See\n28 U.S.C. § 1367(c). We reverse.\n\n    First, although it may be more a matter of a change of\nnomenclature than of practical operation, we overrule Wyatt\nv. Terhune, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1108</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1119 (9th Cir. 2003), in which we\nheld that a failure to exhaust under § 1997e(a) should be\nraised by a defendant as an “unenumerated Rule 12(b)\nmotion.” We conclude that a failure to exhaust is more\nappropriately handled under the framework of the existing\nrules than under an “unenumerated” (that is, non-existent)\nrule. Failure to exhaust under the PLRA is “an affirmative\ndefense the defendant must plead and prove.” Jones v. Bock,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145763\"><a href=\"/opinion/145763/jones-v-bock/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">199</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 204, 216 (2007). In the rare event that a failure\nto exhaust is clear on the face of the complaint, a defendant\nmay move for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6). Otherwise,\ndefendants must produce evidence proving failure to exhaust\nin order to carry their burden. If undisputed evidence viewed\n\f                      ALBINO V. BACA                        5\n\nin the light most favorable to the prisoner shows a failure to\nexhaust, a defendant is entitled to summary judgment under\nRule 56. If material facts are disputed, summary judgment\nshould be denied, and the district judge rather than a jury\nshould determine the facts.\n\n    Second, we hold that Albino has satisfied the exhaustion\nrequirement of § 1997e(a). Defendants have failed to prove\nthat administrative remedies were available at the jail where\nAlbino was confined. Because no administrative remedies\nwere available, he is excused from any obligation to exhaust\nunder § 1997e(a). We therefore direct the district court to\ngrant summary judgment to Albino on the issue of\nexhaustion.\n\n          I. Background and Proceedings Below\n\n    Albino proceeded pro se in the district court. The\nfollowing narrative is based largely on the evidence submitted\nto the district court by both parties. It is based partly on\nallegations in Albino’s verified first amended complaint that\nare uncontradicted by evidence in the record. Except where\notherwise noted, the narrative is based on undisputed\nevidence.\n\n    Glendale Police officers arrested Albino for rape under\nCalifornia Penal Code § 261(a)(1). He was not arrested for\na sexual crime against a minor. After his arrest, Albino was\nbrought to the Los Angeles County Men’s Central Jail. He\nalleges that when he arrived at the jail on May 11, 2006,\ndeputies refused to place him in protective custody. Instead,\nthey placed him in the general population of a high-medium\nsecurity housing unit. Albino is 5 feet 3 inches tall. At the\ntime, he weighed 123 pounds.\n\f6                     ALBINO V. BACA\n\n    Albino alleges in his complaint that on June 16, 2006, an\ninmate approached him and said, “[T]he deputy said you\ncommitted sex acts with children.” A group of several\ninmates then attacked Albino, beating him unconscious,\ncutting him severely, and raping him. Albino reported the\nassault to Deputy Jaquez, who wrote up an “Incident Report”\ndated June 17. Despite the one-day disparity in dates, it is\nclear that Albino’s complaint and Deputy Jaquez’s report deal\nwith the same incident. Deputy Jaquez wrote that Albino\n“was holding a white piece of cloth over his right jaw and\nwas bleeding profusely. He also had multiple cuts and\nredness throughout his entire facial area and he complained\nof pain to his face.” Albino had “two lacerations\napproximately 6 [inches] in length across the side of his right\ncheek. . . . He also had multiple cuts and redness around his\nright eye.” The lacerations were deep cuts in the form of a\ncross. Albino also suffered broken teeth, broken ribs, a\nbroken shoulder, and damage to his hip.\n\n    Deputy Jaquez wrote in his report that Albino recounted\nto him that he had told several inmates that he was in jail for\nrape, but that it had been his partner who had raped a sixteen-\nyear-old girl. Deputy Jaquez identified Albino’s attackers,\nincluding an inmate named Rodriguez. Deputy Jaquez wrote\nthat he spoke to Rodriguez, who admitted to having been one\nof those who had beaten Albino. Deputy Jaquez wrote that\nRodriguez told him that “Albino . . . came in last night\nbragging about that he had raped a girl.”\n\n     Albino was taken to the hospital for treatment. When he\nreturned from the hospital, Albino again asked to be placed\nin protective custody. He states in a declaration, “After the\nfirst attack, I pleaded with many staff members for help but\n\f                       ALBINO V. BACA                           7\n\nthe only thing anyone told me was; it is your attorneys [sic]\njob to protect me.” Albino states in another declaration:\n\n        Of the ap[p]rox. 10 or so times plaintiff\n        begged defendant custodial deputies to be\n        placed in segregation or for the[m] to help me,\n        defendants[] responded that it was my\n        attorney’s job to protect me. As these were\n        sworn peace officers, I was of the belief that\n        I had to seek my trial attorney’s help.\n\n    Despite Albino’s pleas, deputies did not place him in\nprotective custody upon his return from the hospital. Instead,\nthey placed him in a different general-population housing\nunit. Sometime in mid-July, two inmates in the new unit\nattacked Albino, punching and kicking him “numerous\ntimes.” Albino reported this second attack to Deputy\nEspinosa. This time Albino did not identify his attackers. In\nhis “Incident Report,” Deputy Espinosa wrote, “Swelling\nunder his left eye, swelling to his left side of his forehead, and\nswelling to his right temple.” Albino was taken to the jail\nclinic rather than the hospital. He alleges in his complaint\nthat some of the wounds from the first attack had been\nopened, and that his treatment at the clinic consisted only of\npain medication.\n\n    Albino alleges in his complaint that after the second\nattack he again requested protective custody, but a deputy\ntold him it “wasn’t needed.” The deputy instead placed him\nin yet a third general-population housing unit. In September\n2006, Albino was assaulted a third time. He was taken to the\njail clinic. He alleges that he suffered “damage to old\nwounds, including plaintiff’s right eye.”\n\f8                       ALBINO V. BACA\n\n    As a result of these attacks, Albino has suffered severe\nnerve damage on the right side of his face. He has also lost\nhearing in his right ear and most of the vision in his right eye.\nHe now uses a hearing aid and a cane for the blind. He states\nin his declaration:\n\n        My trial attorney had to ask the court for 3\n        court orders to get me any medical care for\n        my injuries, and dental care. It was not until\n        I arrived at CDCR [California Department of\n        Corrections and Rehabilitation] that [I\n        received] a proper Examination, [and] the\n        doctor told me it was too late to repair the\n        nerve damage.\n\n    Albino states in a declaration filed in the district court that\nhe was given no orientation when he was brought to the jail,\nthat he never saw a manual describing complaint procedures,\nthat he never saw complaint forms or a complaint box, and\nthat when he complained and asked for help he was\nconsistently told by deputies at the jail that he should talk to\nhis attorney.\n\n    Defendants provided a declaration by Deputy Jason Ford,\nto which he attaches a copy of “Custody Division Manual\n§ 5-12/010.00 ‘Inmate Complaints.’” They also provided a\ndeclaration in which Deputy Kevin Kelley describes the\ncomplaint process in the jail, describes complaint boxes and\ntheir placement, and recounts the manner in which complaint\nforms are made available.\n\n    Defendants moved for summary judgment. They\ncontended that Albino had failed to exhaust his remedies at\nthe jail system prior to filing suit, as required by 42 U.S.C.\n\f                     ALBINO V. BACA                        9\n\n§ 1997e(a). In the alternative, they contended on the merits\nthat Albino had failed to show any constitutional violations.\nAlbino did not cross-move for summary judgment.\n\n    In his Report and Recommendation, the magistrate judge\nrecommended granting summary judgment to defendants on\nthe ground that defendants had “an accessible administrative\nprocedure for seeking redress of grievances,” and that Albino\ndid not exhaust his remedies under that procedure. The\ndistrict court accepted the recommendation of the magistrate\njudge and granted summary judgment to defendants. The\ncourt dismissed Albino’s complaint without prejudice for\nfailure to exhaust. Neither the magistrate judge nor the\ndistrict court reached the merits of Albino’s claims.\n\n    A three-judge panel of this court affirmed, treating the\ndefendants’ summary judgment motion with respect to\nexhaustion as an unenumerated Rule 12(b) motion.

BACA\n\n                       III. Discussion\n\n    We decide two questions. First, we hold that an\nunenumerated motion under Rule 12(b) is not the appropriate\nprocedural device for pretrial determination of whether\nadministrative remedies have been exhausted under the\nPLRA. See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). To the extent evidence in\nthe record permits, the appropriate device is a motion for\nsummary judgment under Rule 56. If summary judgment is\nnot appropriate, the district judge may decide disputed\nquestions of fact in a preliminary proceeding. Second, we\nhold that defendants are not entitled to summary judgment\nthat Albino failed to exhaust available administrative\nremedies. Further, we hold sua sponte that Albino is entitled\nto summary judgment that there were no available\nadministrative remedies at the jail within the meaning of the\nPLRA, and that he therefore satisfied § 1997e(a)’s exhaustion\nrequirement.\n\n     A. Summary Judgment or Unenumerated Rule 12(b)\n\n    In holding that the proper procedural device for\ndefendants to raise an exhaustion defense is an unenumerated\nRule 12(b) motion, the panel followed our decision in Wyatt\nv. Terhune, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1108</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2003). Wyatt is a PLRA\nprison-conditions case in which we held that “the failure to\nexhaust nonjudicial remedies that are not jurisdictional should\nbe treated as a matter in abatement, which is subject to an\nunenumerated Rule 12(b) motion rather than a motion for\nsummary judgment.” Id. at 1119. After we decided Wyatt,\nthe Supreme Court held in Jones v. Bock, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145763\"><a href=\"/opinion/145763/jones-v-bock/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">199</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(2007), that exhaustion under § 1997e(a) is an affirmative\ndefense that must be pled and proved by a defendant. Id. at\n216. In reaching this conclusion, the Court wrote that “courts\n\f                       ALBINO V. BACA                        11\n\nshould generally not depart from the usual practice under the\nFederal Rules on the basis of perceived policy concerns.” Id.\nat 212. “[T]he PLRA’s screening requirement does\nnot—explicitly or implicitly—justify deviating from the usual\nprocedural practice beyond the departures specified by the\nPLRA itself.” Id. at 214.\n\n    The Court in Jones cited our decision in Wyatt\napprovingly for its conclusion that PLRA exhaustion is an\naffirmative defense, but it did not comment on our use of an\nunenumerated Rule 12(b) motion for determining whether\nadministrative remedies had been exhausted. Id. at 204 n.2.\nWhile Wyatt’s use of an unenumerated Rule 12(b) motion is\nconsistent with PLRA’s purpose of limiting prisoner litigation\nby screening cases at the outset of the litigation, see id. at\n202, it is in tension with the Court’s admonition in Jones\nagainst deviating from “the usual practice under the Federal\nRules.” Id. at 212. The very phrase we used in Wyatt—“an\nunenumerated Rule 12(b) motion”—is a concession that such\na motion is not contemplated by the rules. We conclude that\nWyatt is no longer good law after Jones (if it ever was good\nlaw), and that we should treat an exhaustion defense under\nthe PLRA within the framework of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure.\n\n    In a few cases, a prisoner’s failure to exhaust may be clear\nfrom the face of the complaint. However, such cases will be\nrare because a plaintiff is not required to say anything about\nexhaustion in his complaint. As the Court wrote in Jones,\n“failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense under the PLRA,\nand . . . inmates are not required to specially plead or\ndemonstrate exhaustion in their complaints.” Id. at 216. But\nin those rare cases where a failure to exhaust is clear from the\nface of the complaint, a defendant may successfully move to\n\f12                     ALBINO V. BACA\n\ndismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. See\nid. at 215–16; Scott v.

Jones, 549 U.S.\nat 204. The procedure under which a defendant must do so is\nprovided by the Federal Rules. The general outlines of that\nprocedure, applicable to all civil cases, are well understood.\nIf the evidence permits, the defendant may move for\nsummary judgment under Rule 56. If there is a genuine\ndispute about material facts, summary judgment will not be\ngranted.\n\n    The Court in Jones cautioned that we should not alter the\nordinary procedural practices and rules in order to serve the\npolicy aims of the PLRA. Id. at 214. At the same time,\nhowever, the Court recognized that “the PLRA mandates\nearly judicial screening of prisoner complaints and requires\nprisoners to exhaust prison grievance procedures before filing\nsuit.” Id. at 202.

Courts\nhave exercised substantial discretion in fashioning exhaustion\nrules, though “appropriate deference to Congress’ power to\nprescribe the basic procedural scheme . . . requires fashioning\nof exhaustion principles in a manner consistent with\ncongressional intent.” Id. at 144.\n\n    The Court recognized in Jones that the exhaustion\nquestion in PLRA cases should be decided as early as\nfeasible. We conclude, consistent with Jones as well as with\nnon-PLRA cases, that exhaustion is analogous to subject-\nmatter jurisdiction, personal jurisdiction, venue, and\nabstention, in that all these matters are typically decided at\nthe outset of the litigation. There are, of course, differences.\nFor example, a defect in subject-matter jurisdiction, unlike a\nfailure to exhaust, is a nonwaivable defect. See Detabali v.\nSt. Luke’s Hosp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797441\"><a href=\"/opinion/797441/lorraine-detabali-v-st-lukes-hospital-john-williams-philip-gardner/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1199</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1202 (9th Cir. 2007). And\nwhile personal jurisdiction and venue are waivable defects,\nthey are unlike a failure to exhaust in that they merely\nconcern a choice among courts; they do not concern a\nprerequisite to bringing suit in any court. But, broadly\nspeaking, subject-matter jurisdiction, personal jurisdiction,\nvenue, abstention, and exhaustion are all issues of “judicial\nadministration” that are appropriately decided early in the\nproceeding. See, e.g., Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding\nCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102952\"><a href=\"/opinion/102952/myers-v-bethlehem-shipbuilding-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 50–51 (1938) (referring to the “long-\nsettled rule of judicial administration that no one is entitled to\njudicial relief for a supposed or threatened injury until the\nprescribed administrative remedy has been exhausted”).

See Pavey, 544 F.3d at 742. A summary judgment\nmotion made by either party may be, but need not be, directed\nsolely to the issue of exhaustion. If a motion for summary\njudgment is denied, disputed factual questions relevant to\nexhaustion should be decided by the judge, in the same\nmanner a judge rather than a jury decides disputed factual\nquestions relevant to jurisdiction and venue.

In determining the exhaustion burdens\napplicable to PLRA cases, the three-judge panel in this case\ncited the exhaustion burdens applicable to claims under the\nTorture Victim Protection Act (“TVPA”). Albino v. Baca,\n\f                      ALBINO V.

We agree\nwith the three-judge panel that the burdens outlined in Hilao\nshould provide the template for the burdens here. We wrote\nin Hilao:\n\n       The legislature’s intended operation of the\n       exhaustion provision [of the TVPA] is set\n       forth with remarkable clarity in the Senate\n       Report:\n\n           ....\n\n           . . . [T]he interpretation of [the exhaustion\n           provision of the TVPA] should be\n           informed by general principles of\n           international law. The procedural practice\n           of international human rights tribunals\n           generally holds that the respondent has\n           the burden of raising the nonexhaustion of\n           remedies as an affirmative defense and\n           must show that domestic remedies exist\n           that the claimant did not use. Once the\n           defendant makes a showing of remedies\n           abroad which have not been exhausted,\n           the burden shifts to the plaintiff to rebut\n           by showing that the local remedies were\n           ineffective, unobtainable, unduly\n           prolonged, inadequate, or obviously futile.\n\n       S.

BACA\n\n    Transposing Hilao’s approach onto the PLRA, we hold\nthat the defendant’s burden is to prove that there was an\navailable administrative remedy, and that the prisoner did not\nexhaust that available remedy. See id. (“[T]he respondent . . .\nmust show that domestic remedies exist that the claimant did\nnot use.”). Once the defendant has carried that burden, the\nprisoner has the burden of production. That is, the burden\nshifts to the prisoner to come forward with evidence showing\nthat there is something in his particular case that made the\nexisting and generally available administrative remedies\neffectively unavailable to him. See id. (“[T]he burden shifts\nto the plaintiff to rebut by showing that the local remedies\nwere ineffective, unobtainable, unduly prolonged, inadequate,\nor obviously futile.”). However, as required by Jones, the\nultimate burden of proof remains with the defendant.\n\n    Our sister circuits generally agree with this description of\nthe respective burdens.

Defendants put on two\nwitnesses who testified about administrative procedures at the\nprison, and who testified that they had found no evidence that\nMorton had ever filed a grievance. Morton contended that he\nhad exhausted his administrative remedies, but he put on no\nwitnesses of his own. Id. We wrote, “The district court\nfound that Morton had failed to exhaust administrative\nremedies on his § 1983 claims . . . and dismissed those claims\nwithout prejudice.” Id. We concluded, “On this record, the\ndistrict court did not commit clear error by finding that\nMorton had failed to exhaust administrative remedies on his\n§ 1983 assault claim.” Id. at 945. Contrary to the contention\nof our dissenting colleagues, there is no indication in Morton\nthat we thought we were reviewing a summary judgment by\nthe district court on issue of exhaustion. And there is not so\nmuch as a hint in Morton that we thought we were changing\nour summary judgment procedure, such that we were required\nto review for clear error the district court’s understanding, on\nsummary judgment, of the facts viewed in the light most\nfavorable to the non-moving party.\n\n    Our dissenting colleagues contend that in this case we\nmust review for clear error the district court’s understanding\nof the facts because that court “did decide disputed factual\nissues.” Diss.

It sets out in some detail the administrative\nprocedures to be followed in processing prisoner complaints.\nAmong other things, the Manual provides:\n\n       Each unit commander shall designate a\n       supervisor, at the permanent rank of sergeant\n       or above, to assume the collateral duty of\n       Inmate Complaint Coordinator. The unit\n       commander shall also ensure that each\n       housing unit within the facility has an\n       adequate supply of Inmate Complaint Forms\n       available, and that the inmates have\n       unrestricted access to the forms. All inmates\n       are permitted to report a complaint, whether\n       or not it is written on the specified form.\n       Each housing area shall have a locked\n       repository accessible to inmates, where they\n       are allowed to deposit their completed forms\n       without interference.\n\n    Second, Deputy Kelley provided a declaration in which\nhe states:\n\n          I have personal knowledge of the policies\n       and procedures in place regarding inmate\n       complaints/grievances at Men’s Central Jail as\n\f                      ALBINO V. BACA                       23\n\n       of the time of the incidents alleged in the First\n       Amended Complaint.\n\n           At Men’s Central Jail, inmates are given\n       access to Inmate Complaint Forms to fill out,\n       or they may submit a written complaint of any\n       kind, to address any number of issues,\n       including but not limited to personnel\n       conduct, medical care, classification actions\n       and conditions of confinement. The Inmate\n       Complaint Forms are available at various\n       locations within the facility, and an adequate\n       supply is maintained and available for any\n       inmate who requests them.\n\n           Inmates may place their complaints in a\n       locked complaint box, or give them directly to\n       the staff.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n    For his part, Albino provided a declaration in which he\nstates:\n\n           At no time during my stay was I\n       interviewed by jail staff, or given any type of\n       orientation. . . .\n\n           At no time during my stay at the jail did I\n       see a LASD Custody Division Manual § 5-\n       12/010.00, or if I did it was not in Spanish\n       where I could read and understand what it\n       was. I have never seen or heard of a LASD\n       Jail complaint form.\n\f24                    ALBINO V. BACA\n\n           ....\n\n          I never seen [sic] a complaint box, and no\n       one told me of such a complaint box.\n\n           . . . After the first attack, I pleaded with\n       many staff members for help but the only\n       thing anyone told me was; it is your\n       attorney[’]s job to protect me.\n\n           ....\n\n            During the 10 or so times I begged\n       officers to be placed in segregation. Not one\n       officer or staff member handed me a\n       complaint form or a rule book and told me to\n       fill out the form and they would put it in a\n       box. All any of the staff told me was my\n       public defender[’]s job to protect me. My\n       public defender also never informed me of a\n       LASD complaint form.\n\n    The Custody Division Manual, with its section dedicated\nto “Inmate Complaints,” is of little help to defendants.\nDefendants have conceded that the Manual was a personnel\nmanual that was available only to jail employees. Prisoners,\nincluding Albino, were not given access to the Manual.\nIndeed, so far as the record shows, inmates were not even told\nof the existence of the Manual.\n\n    Deputy Kelley’s declaration is hardly more helpful. He\nstates that an “adequate supply” of Inmate Complaint Forms\nis “maintained,” and that they are “available for any inmate\nwho requests them” (emphasis added). The clear implication\n\f                       ALBINO V. BACA                        25\n\nof Deputy Kelley’s statement is that the forms are available\nonly on request; that is, they are not placed where inmates\nmay see and take them on their own. Further, there is nothing\nin Deputy Kelley’s statement indicating that inmates are told\nthat a complaint must be in writing, or that a written\ncomplaint, even if not on an official form, will be considered.\nFinally, Deputy Kelley declares that inmates may place their\ncomplaints in a “locked complaint box,” but he does not\ndescribe the box or its location in the unit. Nor, indeed, does\nhe say that the box is labeled in any way to indicate its\nfunction. When pressed at oral argument, defendants’\nattorney rested on Deputy Kelley’s declaration, even though\nhe was obliged to concede that Deputy Kelley did not say\nwhere the complaint box was placed or whether there was\nanything written on the outside of the box.\n\n    Thus, so far as the record shows, there is a personnel\nmanual describing a complaint process, but the manual is not\navailable, or even known, to the prisoners. There are also\n“locked complaint boxes” located somewhere in the prison\nwhere, we may infer from Deputy Kelley’s declaration,\nprisoners have access to them. But there is nothing in the\nrecord to indicate that the boxes have anything written on\nthem to signify their purpose, or that prisoners are otherwise\nadvised of their purpose or location. Deputy Kelley states\nthat a written complaint may be “give[n] directly to staff,” but\nthere is nothing in the record to indicate that inmates are told\nthat a complaint must be in writing in order to be considered.\nFinally, we may infer from Deputy Kelley’s declaration that\ncomplaint forms are available only if a prisoner knows to\nrequest them.\n\n   Albino declares, without contradiction, the following. He\ndeclares that he was never given any orientation at the jail,\n\f26                     ALBINO V. BACA\n\nduring which he could have been informed of a complaint\nprocess. He also declares that he has never seen the jail’s\npersonnel manual, a complaint box, or a complaint form.\nFinally, he declares that he repeatedly sought, and was\ndenied, help from the prison staff. Specifically, he declares\nthat he repeatedly complained “directly to the staff” (to use\nDeputy Kelley’s words) that he needed to be placed in\nprotective custody. Staff members never told him that\ncomplaint forms were “available for any inmate who requests\nthem” (again to use Deputy Kelley’s words), and they never\nconstrued Albino’s complaints as requests for such forms.\nNor did staff members tell Albino that he could put in a\ncomplaint box, or give directly to them, a written complaint,\neven if not on an official form. Instead, staff members\nrepeatedly told Albino that he should seek relief by talking to\nhis criminal defense attorney.\n\n    As we noted above, failure to exhaust administrative\nremedies is an affirmative defense that the defendant must\nplead and prove in a PLRA case. Jones, 549 U.S. at 212.\nViewing all of the evidence in the light most favorable to\nAlbino, we conclude as a matter of law that defendants have\nfailed to carry their initial burden of proving their affirmative\ndefense that there was an available administrative remedy\nthat Albino failed to exhaust. We therefore reverse the\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment to defendants on\nthe issue of exhaustion.\n\n    Albino, acting pro se, did not make a cross-motion for\nsummary judgment. However, we conclude he would have\nsucceeded had he made such a motion. We therefore direct\nsua sponte that summary judgment be granted to Albino on\nthe issue of exhaustion.\n\f                       ALBINO V. BACA                        27\n\n    We have long recognized that, where the party moving for\nsummary judgment has had a full and fair opportunity to\nprove its case, but has not succeeded in doing so, a court may\nenter summary judgment sua sponte for the nonmoving party.\nSee, e.g., Cool Fuel, Inc. v.

The authority to grant summary judgment sua\nsponte was made explicit in the current version of Rule 56,\neffective as of December 2010. Fed. R. Civ.

Similarly, in Kassbaum v.\nSteppenwolf Productions, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771611\"><a href=\"/opinion/771611/nicholas-kassbaum-aka-nick-st-nicholas-v-steppenwolf-productions-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">487</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2000),\nwe noted that “if a court concludes that a non-moving party\nis entitled to judgment, ‘great care must be exercised to\nassure that the original movant has had an adequate\nopportunity to show that there is a genuine issue and that his\n[or her] opponent is not entitled to judgment as a matter of\nlaw.’” Id. at 494 (quoting Ramsey v.

We further noted that “we should not reverse\na summary judgment and order judgment for a non-moving\nparty based on an issue that the movant had no opportunity to\ndispute in the district court.” Id. at 495.\n\n    We conclude that the concerns expressed in Buckingham\nand Kassbaum have been satisfied in a case such as this one,\nwhere, after having had a full opportunity to gather evidence,\na defendant moves for summary judgment based on a failure\nto exhaust under the PLRA. As the movants for summary\njudgment in this case, defendants were on notice of the need\nto come forward with all their evidence in support of this\nmotion, and they had every incentive to do so. Defendants\nhad ample opportunity to conduct discovery and to provide\nevidence to carry their burden of proof that administrative\nremedies were available. There is nothing in the record to\nsuggest that defendants’ discovery with respect to exhaustion\nwas curtailed in any way. Indeed, most of the relevant\nevidence was within their knowledge and control. In other\n\f                      ALBINO V. BACA                        29\n\nwords, defendants “had a full and fair opportunity to ventilate\nthe issues involved.” Cool Fuel, Inc., 685 F.2d at 312.\n\n    Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\ndefendants, defendants have failed to show a genuine dispute\nas to whether administrative remedies in the jail were\navailable. Albino was beaten several times and repeatedly\ncomplained orally to deputies in the jail, asking repeatedly to\nbe placed in protective custody. The jail had a manual\ndescribing a procedure for handling inmate complaints, but\nthis manual was for staff use only and was not made available\nto inmates. An “adequate supply” of Inmate Complaint\nForms was kept “at various locations” within the jail. But\nsuch forms had to be requested by an inmate and were never\nprovided to Albino, despite his repeated complaints. Nor was\nAlbino told that he could write a complaint on an ordinary\npiece of paper and hand it to one of the deputies. Instead,\nAlbino was told that it was his criminal defense attorney’s\njob to protect him from attacks in the jail. In these\ncircumstances, we conclude as a matter of law that defendants\nhave not carried their burden of proving that the jail provided\nan “available” administrative remedy.\n\n                         Conclusion\n\n    We reverse the district court’s grant of summary\njudgment for defendants and remand with instructions to\nenter summary judgment for Albino on the issue of\nexhaustion.\n\n   REVERSED and REMANDED.\n\f30                     ALBINO V. BACA\n\nN.R. SMITH, Circuit Judge, joined by TALLMAN and\nIKUTA, Circuit Judges, dissenting:\n\n    Albino is a sympathetic plaintiff. However, that fact\nshould not excuse Albino from his duty to exhaust available\nadministrative remedies, while other sympathetic plaintiffs\nare required to exhaust.\n\n    The Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1996 (PLRA)\nprovides that “[n]o action shall be brought with respect to\nprison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other\nFederal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or\nother correctional facility until such administrative remedies\nas are available are exhausted.” 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a).\n“Available” means “capable of use for the accomplishment of\na purpose,” and that which “is accessible or may be\nobtained.” Booth v. Churner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118434\"><a href=\"/opinion/118434/booth-v-churner/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 737 (2001)\n(quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary 150\n(1993)). Recently, the Supreme Court instructed us to adhere\nclosely to the plain language of the statute and not interpolate\nour policy concerns into the statute. Jones v. Bock, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145763\"><a href=\"/opinion/145763/jones-v-bock/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">199</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 212, 216-17 (2007).\n\n    Here, the district court found administrative remedies that\nthe County of Los Angeles offered in the jail were “capable\nof use” and could be obtained. Therefore, Albino had the\nobligation to exhaust these remedies before he could bring an\naction. The majority excuses Albino from that duty and\ninstead places an affirmative duty on prison officials to\ninform inmates about the administrative remedies available.\nNothing in the plain language of the PLRA even suggests that\nprison officials have the duties that the majority places upon\nthem today. In other words, in order to afford relief to a\nsympathetic plaintiff, the majority takes extraordinary steps\n\f                      ALBINO V. BACA                        31\n\nand (1) ignores the “clearly erroneous” standard of review in\nreviewing the district court’s findings; (2) mandates the\nproduction of unprecedented evidence in order for the\ndefendants to meet their burden of proof on exhaustion;\n(3) grants summary judgment to the plaintiff sua sponte,\nwithout allowing the defendants the opportunity to produce\nthe newly mandated evidence; and (4) changes the procedure\nby which our courts determine whether a plaintiff has\nexhausted administrative remedies. Because the majority’s\ninterpretation and application of the PLRA in this case\ndeviates from the approach required by the Supreme Court\nand creates a circuit split with the Eighth and Tenth Circuits,\nI must dissent.\n\n                              I.\n\n    The majority rightly adopts the burden shifting\nframework for administrative exhaustion disputes applied in\nHilao v. Estate of Marcos, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"732382\"><a href=\"/opinion/732382/45-fed-r-evid-serv-913-96-cal-daily-op-serv-9090-96-daily-journal/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">767</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 778 n.5 (9th Cir.\n1996). Maj. op. at 17. When a defendant alleges a failure to\nexhaust, it “has the burden of raising the nonexhaustion of\nremedies as an affirmative defense and must show that . . .\nremedies exist that the claimant did not use.” Maj. op. at 17.\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Once a defendant shows\nthat nonexhausted remedies exist, the plaintiff must show that\nthe administrative remedies were unavailable to him. See\nHilao, 103 F.3d at 778 n.5.\n\n    Applying this burden shifting framework to all of the\nevidence presented by both parties, the magistrate judge\nfound that Baca met his burden. The court supported its\nconclusion with the following factual findings: (1) a\ngrievance procedure existed at the Jail; (2) the procedure was\naccessible to inmates; and (3) Albino failed to “avail himself\n\f32                     ALBINO V. BACA\n\nof it.” The district court adopted these findings in full. Even\nAlbino concedes that Baca met his burden, as did the\ndissenting panel member of the three-judge panel.

Instead, regardless of the form of the\nmotion, district courts have simply decided the issue, and we\nhave deferred to that finding on appeal. See, e.g., Morton,\n599 F.3d at 944–46; Wyatt v.

For instance, in Morton v. Hall, the district\ncourt ruled in favor of a defendant on its motion for summary\njudgment because the defendant had “sustained its burden to\ndemonstrate the Plaintiff . . . did not exhaust his\nadministrative appeals as required.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2427440\"><a href=\"/opinion/2427440/morton-v-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The district court’s factual findings,\nupon which it based this decision, were based on evidence not\ndisputed by the plaintiff. Id. at 1075. On appeal, this court\nreviewed the district court’s factual findings and concluded\nthat it “did not commit clear error by finding that Morton had\nfailed to exhaust administrative remedies on his § 1983\nassault claim.” Morton, 599 F.3d at 945 (emphasis added).\nTherefore, the majority’s contention that the presence of\nundisputed facts in this case gives it the right to find its own\n\f34                     ALBINO V. BACA\n\nfacts or attach differing weight to evidence than did the\ndistrict court is without merit. The district court’s factual\nfindings in deciding an exhaustion issue warrant our\ndeference, whether disputed or undisputed.\n\n    Further, the trial court did decide disputed factual issues\nin this case. For example, “[t]he Court [found], based upon\nthe submissions of the parties, that the Los Angeles County\nJail had an accessible administrative procedure for seeking\nredress of grievances at the time of the incidents” despite\nAlibno’s allegations that the Jail never informed him of the\ngrievance procedure. Indeed, only “in light of the Court’s\nfinding that the jail had available administrative remedies,”\nwas it able to conclude that “summary judgment based on\nfailure to exhaust [was] warranted.” Thus, the trial court’s\nconclusion that there was no “genuine issue of material fact\nas to the existence of a grievance procedure at the jail, its\naccessibility to inmates, or Plaintiff’s failure to avail himself\nof it,” was predicated upon its own factual findings to that\neffect. Regardless of the nature of these findings, this court\nmay only overturn them if they are clearly erroneous. Morton,\n599 F.3d at 945.\n\n    The trial court’s factual findings here are supported by\nample evidence in the record. Nevertheless, the majority\nconcludes “as a matter of law” that Baca failed to satisfy his\nburden of proving “that there was an available administrative\nremedy . . . that Albino failed to exhaust.” Id. However, that\nis not what happened here. Rather, the majority\nimpermissibly seizes on facts considered and weighed by the\ndistrict court and arrives at its own conclusion. See Maj. op.\nat 20–26; Anderson, 470 U.S. at 574 (“[T]he court of appeals\nmay not reverse [the district court’s account of the evidence]\n\f                      ALBINO V. BACA                        35\n\neven though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of\nfact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.”).\n\n    The posture of the majority opinion speaks louder than\nthe one sentence purporting to decide the case as a matter of\nlaw. Indeed, the majority develops its own facts to support its\nconclusion that Baca failed to carry his burden. See Maj. op.\nat 20–26. That process is de novo review and conflicts with\nthe Supreme Court’s instruction to accord deference to lower\ncourt findings, Anderson, 470 U.S. at 573–74, and the\nmajority’s own framework, maj. op. at 15. Further, the\nmajority’s factual conclusions are wrong, as it discredits each\npiece of evidence supporting the existence of the Jail’s\ngrievance procedure independently, absent consideration of\nthe process as a whole.\n\n    First, the majority decides the Custody Division Manual\n§ 5-12/010.00 “is of little help to defendants,” because Albino\nnever saw it. Maj. op. at 24. However, Baca did not submit\nthe Custody Division Manual’s grievance procedure to prove\nAlbino was aware of the procedure. He submitted it to\ndocument the existence of the procedure, as affirmed by Jail\npersonnel. See Brown v. Valoff, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791854\"><a href=\"/opinion/791854/peter-brown-v-j-valoff-robert-hall-v-jw-fairman-jr-and-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">926</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 937 (9th Cir.\n2005). Indeed, “it is the prison’s requirements, and not the\nPLRA, that define the boundaries of proper exhaustion.”\nJones v.

This section of the\nCustody Division Manual gives credence to the testimony\nthat the grievance procedure existed.\n\n    Next, the majority discredits the availability of the\ngrievance procedure, because Inmate Complaint Forms were\nonly “available for any inmate who requests them.” Maj. op.\nat 24 (quoting Deputy Kelley’s declaration). However, the\nmajority takes the quote out of context. Deputy Kelley’s\n\f36                     ALBINO V. BACA\n\naffirmation also states that “Inmate Complaint Forms are\navailable at various locations within the facility.” Further, the\nmajority fails to recognize that Jail procedures do not require\nthat complaints only be filed on an Inmate Complaint Form\nto be effective—a complaint will be considered so long as it\nis written.\n\n    Third, the majority takes issue with a locked complaint\nbox, decrying Baca’s failure to confirm whether “the box is\nlabeled in any way to indicate its function.” Id. at 25.\nHowever, the majority ignores the fact that a complaint does\nnot even need to be filed in a complaint box—the Jail would\nconsider written complaints handed directly to Jail personnel.\n\n    The correct inquiry would have been to determine\nwhether the district court’s factual findings were “plausible.”\nLentini, 370 F.3d at 850. The evidence strongly supports the\ndistrict court’s factual findings, namely the presence of an\n“available” administrative remedy that Albino failed to\nexhaust. Indeed, it is beyond comprehension how a procedure\nas simple as writing a few words on a piece of paper and\nhanding it to Jail personnel could somehow be “[in]capable\nof use.” Maj. op. at 16. The majority’s de novo review (in an\neffort to conclude otherwise) is inconsistent with governing\nlaw, the majority’s own framework, and conflicts even with\nAlbino’s view of the law and facts. Albino never once argued\nthat Baca failed to satisfy his burden, arguing rather that he\nhad satisfied his own burden of showing how the procedures\nwere effectively unavailable.\n\n                               II.\n\n   The majority shoulders Baca with production of evidence\nnever before required in proving failure to exhaust\n\f                      ALBINO V. BACA                        37\n\nadministrative remedies, focusing on the lack of evidence\nconfronting Albino’s testimony that the Jail never informed\nhim of administrative remedies. Maj. op. at 24 (“[I]nmates\nwere not even told of the existence of the Manual.”); id. at 25\n(“[T]here is nothing in Deputy Kelley’s statement indicating\nthat inmates are told that a complaint must be in writing.”);\nid. at 26 (“Staff members never told him that complaint forms\nwere ‘available for any inmate who requests them.’”); id. at\n29 (“Nor was Albino told that he could write a complaint on\nan ordinary piece of paper and hand it to one of the\ndeputies.”) (emphasis added in each).\n\n    Our prior prisoner exhaustion cases required jail officials\nto prove that they did not “hide the ball” from defendants.\nSee, e.g., Sapp v.

Today, the majority requires jail officials prove\nthat, not only did they not hinder a prisoner’s access to\nadministrative remedies, but also that they informed the\nprisoner of them. What comes in the next case to excuse a\nsympathetic plaintiff?\n\n   Albino’s counsel conceded at oral argument that Albino\nnever even asked if there were a grievance procedure.\n\f38                       ALBINO V. BACA\n\nAlthough Albino spoke with his attorney about seeking\nmedical care, the record does not show that he ever raised the\nissue of seeking protective confinement with him. His sole\ncomplaint: the Jail did not inform him of the procedure. As\nBaca’s counsel aptly noted in oral argument, this case boils\ndown to an inmate that alleges “I didn’t see” rather than “I\nlooked and couldn’t find”; that alleges “no one told me”\nrather than “I asked and wasn’t told or was told\nmisinformation.”\n\n    Indeed, neither the PLRA nor the Supreme Court has ever\nimposed such a duty on jail officials (alleging failure to\nexhaust) when the prisoner only alleged ignorance of the\nprocedures; nor have any of the federal courts of appeal.1 To\nthe contrary, the majority’s opinion creates a split with the\nEighth and Tenth Circuits, which have held that such is\nirrelevant to defendants’ burden.

Instead, litigants in\nthis circuit were presumed to have knowledge of duly enacted\nlaws, regulations, and procedures. See Luna v.

In\nKassbaum, the court saw the issues and the law aligning in\nthe non-moving parties favor, but “in the exercise of caution,”\nit still declined to grant summary judgment sua sponte in\nfavor of the non-movant. Id. at 495. The court respected the\nright of the parties to “have notice of [its] decision and an\nopportunity to be heard.” Id.\n\n    The majority fails to exercise such caution here. Instead,\nthe majority mandates the production of evidence never\nbefore necessary for defendants to prove that a plaintiff did\nnot exhaust his administrative remedies. Then, without\nproviding prior notice to Baca or an opportunity to submit\nevidence required under its newly articulated ruling, it grants\nsua sponte summary judgment in Albino’s favor on the\npresent record. The majority’s lip service to the Kassbaum\nstandard is the antithesis of “great care.” 236 F.3d at 494.\n\n    No jail or prison in this circuit had previously been\nobliged to evidence that it had informed prisoners of\nadministrative remedies to show those remedies’ availability.\nLikewise, an inmate’s subjective intent was previously\ninapposite to the inquiry. Thus, without notice, Baca has been\nafforded no opportunity to evidence, for example, (1) that the\nJail actually informed Albino of the Jail’s grievance\nprocedure; (2) the number of inmates filing written\ncomplaints under the present system; or (3) the nature and\nlabeling of the locked complaint box. Before today, Baca had\nno reason to dispute Albino’s factual allegations to the\ncontrary, because the resolution of those allegations was not\nnecessary to resolving a motion for summary judgment for\nfailure to exhaust administrative remedies.\n\f                       ALBINO V. BACA                        41\n\n   Baca is entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard.\nKassbaum, 235 F.3d at 495. Given the new evidence which\na defendant must hereafter produce to demonstrate the\navailability of administrative remedies, granting summary\njudgment sua sponte in favor of Albino is error. See Norse,\n629 F.3d at 972.\n\n                              IV.\n\n    Finally, the majority overrules circuit precedent to\npurportedly effect a “change of nomenclature” without\nchanging the “practical operation” of court procedure dealing\nwith exhaustion issues. Maj. op. at 4. However, if the\nmajority means what it says in the opinion, it effects more\nthan a “change of nomenclature.”\n\n    Our opinion in Wyatt v. Terhune directed courts to treat\na summary judgment motion alleging failure to exhaust\nadministrative remedies “as a matter in abatement, which is\nsubject to an unenumerated Rule 12(b) motion rather than a\nmotion for summary judgment.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1108</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1119 (9th\nCir. 2003). Because exhaustion is a matter of judicial\nadministration rather than an issue regarding the merits,\ndistrict courts could “look beyond the pleadings and decide\ndisputed issues of fact.” Sapp, 623 F.3d at 821 (quoting\nWyatt, 315 F.3d at 1119–20). In doing so, the court had\n“broad discretion as to the method to be used in resolving the\nfactual dispute.” Ritza v.

Then, on\nappeal, our court reviews the dismissal under Rule 12(b) de\nnovo but reviews the district court’s factual findings for clear\nerror. Id.\n\f42                      ALBINO V. BACA\n\n    Under the purported authority of Jones v. Bock, the\nmajority now pens this decision overruling Wyatt. In the\nfuture, an allegation of “failure to exhaust is more\nappropriately handled” as a motion for summary judgment.\nMaj. op. at 4. Then if a factual dispute still persists at\nsummary judgment, the motion must be denied. Id. at 14.\nThen only on the eve of trial (or later) may the district court\ndecide the issue of exhaustion. Id. at 15. “On appeal, we will\nreview the district judge’s legal rulings on exhaustion de\nnovo, but we will accept the judge’s factual findings . . .\nunless they are clearly erroneous.” Id. at 15. This decision is\nparticularly surprising for a number of reasons.\n\n    First, “[a] goal of our circuit’s decisions, including . . . en\nbanc decisions, must be to preserve the consistency of circuit\nlaw.” Miller v. Gammie, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782687\"><a href=\"/opinion/782687/christine-l-miller-guardian-ad-litem-tonnie-savage-guardian-ad-litem-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">335</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">889</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 900 (9th Cir. 2003).\nIn other words, while an en banc panel has the authority to\noverrule circuit precedent, id. at 899, it must have a good\nreason to do so. I question whether a “change of\nnomenclature” constitutes such good reason.\n\n    Second, the Supreme Court cited Wyatt approvingly in\nJones. 549 U.S. at 204 n.2, 212 (holding that circuit courts\ntreating exhaustion as an affirmative defense “have the better\nof the argument”). In light of this favorable citation, the\nmajority’s decision to overrule Wyatt reads too much into\nJones. Instead, it should “abide by the ‘duty of restraint, th[e]\nhumility of function as merely the translator of another’s\ncommand.’” Id. at 216 (quoting Frankfurter, Some Reflections\non the Reading of Statutes, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 527, 533–34\n(1947)) (alteration in original).\n\n   Finally, and most importantly, the Jones Court\nemphasized that “the PLRA mandates early judicial screening\n\f                       ALBINO V. BACA                        43\n\nof prisoner complaints.” Jones, 549 U.S. at 202; accord\nWoods v. Carey, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">722</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1177</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1182 (9th Cir. 2013)\n(“Congress enacted the PLRA to . . . provide for [frivolous\nprisoner lawsuits’] dismissal at an early stage.”). This “allows\nprison officials an opportunity to resolve disputes concerning\nthe exercise of their responsibilities before being haled into\ncourt.” Jones, 549 U.S. at 204. Early judicial screening also\nhelps “ensur[e] that the flood of nonmeritorious claims does\nnot submerge and effectively preclude consideration of the\nallegations with merit.” Id. at 203. However, by designating\nsummary judgment as the appropriate procedure in which to\naddress allegations of nonexhaustion, maj. op. at 15, the\nmajority’s new framework will delay resolution of exhaustion\ndisputes. In fact, the majority opinion guarantees it. Only in\n“rare” cases may exhaustion be decided on a motion to\ndismiss. Id. at 4. Then, even a decisive ruling at the summary\njudgment stage will be unlikely, because the district court\ncannot resolve factual disputes relating to exhaustion in\ndeciding the motion for summary judgment. Id. at 5, 15. Only\nafter denying summary judgment may the court then conclude\nwhether a plaintiff has exhausted administrative remedies. Id.\nat 15 Even though the majority has stipulated that exhaustion\nis not a jury issue, id. at 5, its opinion has the effect of\ncommissioning a trial (by the judge) to decide an issue that is\nwidely viewed as one of judicial traffic control. Id. at 14;\nPavey v. Conley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1315185\"><a href=\"/opinion/1315185/pavey-v-conley/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">739</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 741 (7th Cir. 2008). This new\nprocedure is utterly inconsistent with the PLRA, which\n“mandates early judicial screening of prisoner complaints.”\nJones, 549 U.S. at 202.\n\n    In summary, while the majority correctly preserves the\ndistrict court’s ability to make factual findings in determining\nan exhaustion issue and mandates our deference to the district\ncourt’s factual findings on appeal (though it refuses to do so\n\f44                    ALBINO V. BACA\n\nhere), it impermissibly alters the usual procedural practice in\nthis circuit on the basis of perceived policy concerns. See\nJones, 549 U.S. at 212. This alteration eliminates the district\ncourt’s ability to decide the exhaustion issue “at an early\nstage.” Woods, 722 F.3d at 1182. As a result, it effects much\nmore than a “change of nomenclature.” Maj. op. at 4.\n\f</pre>",
