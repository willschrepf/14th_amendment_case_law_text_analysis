CR 413 ¶¶ 20–22.\n\nPerez seeks non-monetary relief for violation of his rights under the Texas\n\nConstitution. Id. at ¶¶ 23–25.\n\n       In June 2012, WISD filed a plea to the jurisdiction with respect to all claims\n\nother than the Texas Whistleblower Act. CR 27. The 332nd District Court of\n\nHidalgo County, Texas (the “District Court”) denied that plea to the jurisdiction in\n\nSeptember 2012. CR 110. This Court affirmed in part and reversed in part. CR\n\n207.\n\n       In October 2014, WISD filed a plea to the jurisdiction (the “Plea”) with\n\nrespect to Perez’s claims for violation of the Texas Whistleblower Act and for\n\nbreach of his reasonable expectation of contract renewal. CR 94. The 332nd\n\nDistrict Court granted the Plea on December 17, 2015. CR 409. This interlocutory\n\nappeal follows.\n\n\n\n\n                                          vii\n\f                           Statement on Oral Argument\n\n      Given the straightforward factual allegations and legal issues involved in\n\nthis case, Perez does not believe that oral argument would materially aid the Court\n\nin deciding this matter.\n\n\n\n\n                                       viii\n\f                                Issues Presented\n\n1.   Whether the trial court lacked jurisdiction over Perez’s claim for violation of\n     the Texas Whistleblower Act.\n\n2.   Whether the trial court lacked jurisdiction over Perez’s claim for breach of\n     his reasonable expectation of contract renewal.\n\n\n\n\n                                        ix\n\f                                  Legal Standards\n\n      Subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law, and a trial court’s ruling on a\n\nplea to the jurisdiction is reviewed de novo. Soliz v. Nueces County, 134 S.W.3d\n\n298, 300 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi-Edinburg 2003, pet. denied). In making that\n\ndetermination, this Court has held that:\n\n      We construe the pleadings liberally in favor of the plaintiff and look\n      to the pleaders’ intent. If the pleadings do not contain sufficient facts\n      to affirmatively demonstrate the trial court’s jurisdiction but do not\n      affirmatively demonstrate incurable defects in jurisdiction, the issue is\n      one of pleading sufficiency and the plaintiff should be afforded an\n      opportunity to amend. . . . Even a failure to allege sufficient facts to\n      demonstrate jurisdiction does not necessarily authorize immediate\n      dismissal. It is only where the court can see that, even by amendment,\n      no cause of action can be stated consistent with the facts alleged that\n      the court is without jurisdiction.\n\n      If the plea challenges the existence of jurisdictional facts, we consider\n      relevant evidence submitted by the parties when necessary to resolve\n      the jurisdictional issue raised, as the trial court is required to do so. In\n      a case in which the jurisdictional challenge implicates the merits of\n      the plaintiff’s cause of action and the plea to the jurisdiction includes\n      evidence, the trial court reviews the relevant evidence to determine if\n      a fact issue exists. If a fact question exists, then the plea cannot be\n      granted and the fact issue will be resolved by the fact finder.\n\nWeslaco Ind. Sch. Dist. v. Perez, No. 13-12-00581-CV, 2013 WL 3894951, at *1\n\n(Tex. App.—Corpus Christi-Edinburg Jul. 25, 2013) (no pet.).\n\n                                 Statement of Facts\n\n      From July 2004 through June 2010, Perez was a risk manager for WISD.\n\nCR 410 at ¶ 6. WISD had a longstanding pattern and practice of automatically\n\n\n\n                                           1\n\frenewing all of its employment contracts except in the case of cause, misconduct,\n\nor budgetary problems. CR 411 at ¶ 7. From 2005 through 2005, Perez was\n\nroutinely commended for his performance, and his performance reviews were more\n\nthan satisfactory. Id. at ¶ 8. True to its de facto policy, WISD renewed Perez’s\n\nemployment contract every year until the events giving rise to this litigation. See\n\nid. at ¶ 7. WISD even represented to Perez that it would follow that policy with\n\nhim. CR 257 at ¶ 23.\n\n      As WISD’s risk manager, Perez managed employee benefit plans, including\n\nWISD’s self-funded workers’ compensation and self-funded employee health\n\ninsurance plans. CR 410–11 at ¶ 6. In early 2009, Perez became aware of a scheme\n\nwithin WISD to siphon money from the self-funded programs into a construction\n\nfund with which to build a new press box at WISD’s football stadium. CR 411\n\nat ¶ 9. Perez understood that such misappropriation of self-funded plan amounts—\n\nespecially those which had received state and federal funds—violated state and\n\nfederal statutes and regulations. Id.\n\n      Perez did not sit idly by while the funds under his charge were illegally\n\ndrained. Perez made repeated attempts to warn WISD’s management,\n\nsuperintendent, and board members of this unlawful misappropriation. Id. In\n\nreturn, Perez was either rebuked or ignored. Id. at ¶¶ 9–11; CR 255–56 at ¶¶ 5–6.\n\n\n\n\n                                        2\n\fPerez was even told that the shortfall in the employee benefit funds were not a\n\nserious concern as they would be repaid from future bond sales. Id. at ¶ 9.\n\n      Tired of fruitlessly complaining to administrators who were either (at best)\n\nwillfully ignorant or (at worst) complicit, Perez decided to seek outside help. See\n\nCR 411–12 at ¶ 12. Perez contacted the Texas Education Agency (“TEA”) by\n\ntelephone to report WISD’s misuse of funds. CR 256 at ¶¶ 8–9. In order to\n\nsubstantiate Perez’s accusations, the TEA asked Perez to obtain documentation\n\nshowing WISD’s misappropriations. CR 411–12 at ¶ 12. To do so, Perez contacted\n\nthe WISD business office and requested certain documents showing the illicit\n\ntransfer of funds. See id. Perez believes WISD became aware of his investigation\n\nand his contact with TEA. Id.\n\n      WISD did not use Perez’s warnings and the impending TEA investigation to\n\nchange their ways. Instead, they doubled-down and decided to punish Perez for\n\nblowing the whistle. After a long string of glowing performance reviews, Perez\n\nwas rated poorly in 2010—his first review after contacting the TEA. CR 412 at ¶\n\n14. This review made numerous false accusations about Perez’s work and\n\nrecommended that Perez’s contract not be renewed. Id.; CR 389–92, 394. Despite\n\nWISD’s longstanding pattern and practice of renewing all employment contracts,\n\nPerez’s contract was not renewed in and he ceased to be a WISD employee on June\n\n21, 2010. CR 412 at ¶ 15, CR 394.\n\n\n                                         3\n\f      Perez filed an appeal of his termination on July 20, 2010. CR 297. On\n\nOctober 28, 2010, WISD set a hearing for November 1, 2010. CR 91. That original\n\nhearing date was cancelled. WISD and Perez’s counsel finally met on December 1,\n\n2010. CR 257 at ¶ 19. Although Perez and his counsel were under the impression\n\nthat this was to be a settlement discussion, WISD held an unannounced Level 1\n\ncomplaint hearing. Id. Perez filed suit against WISD on March 8, 2011. Id. at ¶ 21.\n\n      Perez was never reinstated by WISD, and the stigma of the false and\n\ndisparaging performance review/termination has left Perez unable to find work in\n\nhis chosen profession of municipal/school district risk management. Id. at ¶ 19;\n\nCR 257 at ¶ 24.\n\n                           Summary of the Argument\n\n      The District Court has jurisdiction over Perez’s Whistleblower claim. WISD\n\nviolated numerous state and federal statutes/regulations by secretly using its\n\nemployee benefit funds to pay for stadium improvements. Because the TEA is\n\ncharged with regulating and overseeing such transactions, it was an appropriate\n\nlaw enforcement authority for purposes of the Whistleblower Act. WISD learned\n\nof this whistleblowing and terminated Perez in retaliation.\n\n      The District Court likewise has jurisdiction over Perez’s breach of\n\nreasonable expectation of contract renewal. Perez had a written contract with\n\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\fWISD which included an implied expectation of renewal. The mere existence of an\n\nimplied term in a written contract did not deprive the District Court of jurisdiction.\n\n                                      Argument\n\n      WISD challenged the District Court’s jurisdiction over Perez’s claims for\n\nviolation of the Texas Whistleblower Act and breach of the reasonable expectation\n\nof renewal. Perez will show the Court that the District Court has jurisdiction over\n\nhis claims and erred by granting WISD’s Plea.\n\nI.    The District Court has jurisdiction over Perez’s whistleblower claim.\n\n      A.     Perez alleged sufficient facts to establish the District Court’s\n             jurisdiction.\n\n      The Texas Whistleblower Act waives sovereign immunity with respect to\n\n“[a] public employee who alleges a violation” of Chapter 554 of the Texas\n\nGovernment Code. Tex. Gov. Code § 554.0035. The Texas Supreme Court has\n\ninterpreted this literally: “there are but two jurisdictional requirements under\n\nsection 544.0035. For the government’s immunity to be waived, the plaintiff must\n\n(1) be a public employee and (2) allege a violation of [Chapter 554].” State v.\n\nLueck, 290 S.W.3d 876, 881 (Tex. 2009) (emphasis removed).\n\n      In the context of a plea to the jurisdiction, a court may consider the “merits”\n\nof a plaintiff’s claim only to the extent “necessary to resolve whether a plaintiff has\n\nalleged a violation under the [Whistleblower] Act.” Id. at 881. This “does not mean\n\nthat [a plaintiff] must prove [its] claim in order to satisfy the jurisdictional hurdle.”\n\n\n                                           5\n\fId. at 884. The statute only requires an “alleg[ation]” of the necessary elements,\n\nand the Texas Supreme Court “ha[s] urged that the burden of proof with respect to\n\nthese jurisdictional facts does not involve a significant inquiry into the substance of\n\nthe claims.” Id.\n\n       Perez’s live pleading (the “Petition”) alleges both of the jurisdictional\n\nprerequisites for waiver immunity under the Texas Whistleblower Act.1 See CR\n\n410–415.\n\n              1.      Perez alleged that he was a public employee.\n\n       The first jurisdictional element is that the plaintiff was a public employee at\n\nthe time of the unlawful retaliation. See Lueck, 290 S.W.3d at 881. Perez’s Petition\n\nalleges that he “was employed as the Risk Manager of WISD from July 2004\n\nthrough June 2010.” CR 410 at ¶ 6. WISD has not challenged that this element has\n\nbeen adequately pled.\n\n              2.      Perez alleged that WISD violated the Texas Whistleblower\n                      Act.\n\n       The second element for waiver of immunity requires Perez to plead that\n\nWISD violated Chapter 554 of the Texas Government Code. Lueck, 290 S.W.3d at\n\n881. The Whistleblower Act provides Perez with the following protection:\n\n\n\n1\n  Alternatively, the Petition does not allege any facts demonstrating that Perez cannot meet the\nelements of the Texas Whistleblower Act, so repleading would be the proper remedy instead of\noutright dismissal. See Weslaco Ind. Sch. Dist, 2013 WL 3894951, at *1.\n\n\n                                               6\n\f      A state or local governmental entity may not suspend or terminate the\n      employment of, or take other adverse personnel action against, a\n      public employee who in good faith reports a violation of law by the\n      employing governmental entity or another public employee to an\n      appropriate law enforcement authority.\n\nTex. Gov. Code § 554.002(a). Perez has alleged precisely this.\n\n      Perez’s theory of the case is simple: WISD misappropriated funds in\n\nviolation of state and federal law. Perez blew the whistle internally, and WISD\n\nignored him. Perez blew the whistle to the TEA, and WISD gave him a false\n\nperformance review and fired him. See generally CR 410–15. No more is required\n\nto establish jurisdiction over a whistleblower claim.\n\n      B.     WISD’s challenges to Perez’s pleadings are based on mistaken\n             interpretations of fact and law.\n\n      WISD’s Plea challenged Perez’s whistleblower allegation in five respects:\n\n(1) the timing of the whistleblowing versus the adverse employment\n\naction, (2) WISD’s violation of law, (3) whether the TEA is an appropriate law\n\nenforcement body, (4) exhaustion of administrative remedies, and (5) the statute of\n\nlimitations. As demonstrated below, these arguments do not defeat the District\n\nCourt’s jurisdiction.\n\n             1.     Perez blew the whistle to the TEA prior to his performance\n                    review and subsequent termination.\n\n      WISD complains that he notified the TEA about WISD’s misappropriation\n\nof funds after his performance review and termination. CR 118–120. But Perez’s\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\fPetition and affidavit show that he initially blew the whistle to TEA prior to his\n\nperformance review. CR 256 at ¶¶ 8–9, 411–12 at ¶¶ 12–14.\n\n             2.    Perez blew the whistle on illegal activity.\n\n      WISD next complains that, in his deposition, non-attorney Perez could not\n\ncite an exact statutory provision violated by WISD. CR 120–123. Under Texas\n\nlaw, however, a whistleblower is not required to “identify a specific law when\n\nmaking a report . . . .” Llanes v. Corpus Christi Ind. Sch. Dist., 64 S.W.3d 638, 642\n\n(Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2001, pet. denied). Similarly, the whistleblower is not\n\nrequired to “prove that a violation of law actually occurred.” Id. “In other words,\n\nwhen an employee believes and reports in good faith that a violation has occurred,\n\nbut is wrong about the legal effect of the facts, he is nevertheless protected by the\n\nwhistleblower statute.” Tex. Dept. of Criminal Justice v. McElyea, 239 S.W.3d\n\n842, 850 (Tex. App.—Austin 2007, pet. denied).\n\n      Perez’s response to WISD’s Plea pointed-out several statutes and regulations\n\nwhich were violated by WISD. See CR 239 at ¶ 46. For example, title 34, section\n\n80.43 of the Code of Federal Regulations punishes persons who “materially fail[]\n\nto comply with the terms of an award[ed]” federal grant. 34 C.F.R. § 80.43(a).\n\nPerez has alleged that WISD misused funds which came, in part, from federal\n\ngrants and that such use was not in compliance with the terms of those grants. CR\n\n411 at ¶ 9–10.\n\n\n\n                                         8\n\f      United State Code, title 29, sections 1104 and 1106 prohibit certain\n\ntransactions by fiduciaries of various self-funded plans. See 29 U.S.C. §§ 1104(a),\n\n1106(a)–(b). Perez has alleged that WISD engaged in the sort of misallocating and\n\nself-dealing prohibited by these sections. See CR 411 at ¶¶ 9–10. WISD argues that\n\nit is not bound by these provisions. CR 419. Perez respectfully submits that such an\n\nargument on the merits should be brought through a motion for summary judgment\n\nand not in a plea to the jurisdiction.\n\n      Section 540.072 of the Texas Labor Code allows a political subdivision to\n\nset-aside funds for workers’ compensation benefits “in a separate account . . .”\n\nTex. Lab. Code 504.072(b). Funds so set aside must be “sufficient to pay all costs”\n\nassociated with the workers’ compensation coverage and are subject to special\n\nsegregation, accounting, and disclosure rules. Tex. Lab. Code § 504.072. Perez has\n\nalleged that WISD violated this statute by secretly raiding the workers’\n\ncompensation fund and leaving a shortfall. Perez is not alone in his belief that\n\nWISD violated this statute. After an investigation, the TEA’s auditor found that\n\n“the transfer of monies from the workers’ compensation fund to the construction\n\nfund was not allowable under Section 504.072 of the Texas Labor Code.” CR 398.\n\nAs stated by the TEA, section 504.072 “provides a list of allowable disbursement\n\nand the use of appropriations for construction purposes is not included in the list.”\n\nId.\n\n\n                                         9\n\f       Section 41.105 of the Texas Education Code sets forth a variety of\n\n“authorized expenditures” of “public school funds.” Tex. Educ. Code § 41.105(a).\n\nAlthough the statute authorizes many types of expenditures of school funds, it does\n\nnot appear to authorize (1) the use of funds “designated for a specific purpose” to\n\nbe used for improving athletic facilities or (2) the use of bond proceeds to repay\n\nsecret debits from employee benefits funds. See Tex. Educ. Code § 41.105(c).\n\nPerez has alleged that WISD violated this statute by using and intending use funds\n\nin unauthorized manners.\n\n       Finally, section 61.1018 of the Texas Administrative Code allows the TEA\n\nto “distribute staff salary allotment funds” to school districts participating in the\n\nTeacher Retirement System—such as WISD—“for the purpose of making\n\npayments of health care supplementation” to certain full-time employees.2 Tex.\n\nAdmin. Code § 61.1018(a), (b)(1)(A). Perez’s Petition shows that WISD violated\n\nthis regulation by using health care funds for other purposes. CR 411 at ¶¶ 9–10.\n\n       Perez has shown that he blew the whistle on unlawful conduct.\n\n              3.     Perez had a good-faith belief that the TEA was an\n                     appropriate law enforcement authority.\n\n       To take refuge under the Texas Whistleblower Act, the plaintiff must report\n\nthe unlawful actions to “an appropriate law enforcement authority . . . that the\n\n2\n This violation was not alleged in Perez’s response to WISD’s Plea. It is, however, an example\nof the sort of violation which could be alleged if Perez is required to replead.\n\n\n                                             10\n\femployee in good faith believes is authorized to: (1) regulate under or enforce the\n\nlaw alleged to be violated in the report; or (2) investigate or prosecute a violation\n\nof criminal law.” Tex. Gov. Code § 554.002(b). The Texas Supreme Court has\n\nclarified that a body will “constitute an appropriate law-enforcement authority\n\nunder the Whistleblower Act” if it has the “authority” to “investigate . . . violations\n\nof the law against third parties” or has “authority to promulgate regulations\n\ngoverning the conduct of such third parties.” Univ. of Houston v. Barth, 403\n\nS.W.3d 851, 857 (Tex. 2013).\n\n      An employee’s “good faith belie[f]” must satisfy objective and subjective\n\nstandards:\n\n      (1)    the employee believed the governmental entity was authorized\n             to (a) regulate under or enforce the law alleged to be violated in\n             the report, or (b) investigate or prosecute a violation of criminal\n             law; and\n      (2)    the employee’s belief was reasonable in light of the employee’s\n             training and experience.\nUniv. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. at Dallas v. Genilello, 398 S.W.3d 680, 683 (Tex.\n\n2013). The whistleblower’s “belief can only satisfy the good-faith requirement if a\n\nreasonably prudent employee in similar circumstances would have thought so.” Id.\n\n      Perez has averred that he contacted the TEA for several subjective reasons.\n\nFirst, an attorney at the United States Attorney General’s office suggested it to\n\nhim. CR 256 at ¶ 7. This made sense to Perez because, “based on [his] education\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\fand experience, [Perez] believed that the TEA was the appropriate entity to [which\n\nhe] should make [his] report of the violation of law.” Id. at ¶ 10. Perez further\n\nbelieved that the TEA would hold authority over WISD because, at “[a]ll times\n\nduring [his] employment, WISD held the TEA out as the appropriate regulatory\n\nenforcement agency related to the laws governing the school district.” Id. at ¶ 11.\n\nFor purposes of a plea to the jurisdiction, this is sufficient proof of subjective\n\nbelief.\n\n          Perez’s belief that the TEA was an appropriate body to regulate a school\n\ndistrict’s financial improprieties was objectively reasonable. As stated above, a\n\nbody is an appropriate law enforcement authority if it has the power to, inter alia,\n\ninvestigate third parties or promulgate rules governing third parties. Univ. of\n\nHouston, 403 S.W.3d at 857. The TEA does both.\n\n          The TEA is statutorily empowered to “review school district budgets, audit\n\nreports, and other fiscal reports . . . .” Tex. Educ. Code § 7.021(b)(13). In so doing,\n\nthe TEA is allowed to “determine whether all legal requirements have been met”\n\nwith respect to those budgets/reports. Tex. Educ. Code § 44.010. In fact, the TEA\n\nasserted the authority to “regulate under or enforce the law alleged to be violated”\n\nwhen it (1) audited WISD’s illicit transfer of the funds and (2) required WISD to\n\nsubmit a corrective action plan within ten business days. CR 396.\n\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\f      The TEA likewise has significant rulemaking authority concerning WISD’s\n\nmisconduct. The TEA is statutorily authorized to promulgate the format of school\n\ndistricts’ budgets and financial reports. Tex. Educ. Code § 44.009(a). Moreover,\n\nthe TEA has promulgated rules governing, inter alia, (1) use healthcare funds, (2)\n\npayments for facilities, and (3) spending of other allotted high school funds. Tex.\n\nAdmin. Code §§ 61.1032, 61.1093, 61.1018.\n\n      In light of these investigatory and rulemaking functions, a reasonably\n\nprudent WISD employee would believe that TEA had the power to promulgate and\n\nenforce statutes and regulations concerning a school district’s misuse of employee\n\nbenefit funds.\n\n             4.     Perez was not required to exhaust his administrative\n                    remedies.\n\n      WISD further complains that Perez “fail[e]d to exhaust his administrative\n\nremedies as required by the Texas Whistleblower Act.” CR 127. This too is\n\nincorrect.\n\n      The Texas Whistleblower Act requires a complaining employee to “initiate\n\naction under the grievance or appeal procedures” of his employer.3 Tex. Gov. Code\n\n§ 554.006(a). The employee is not, however, required to exhaust those remedies.\n\nCanutillo Ind. Sch. Dist. v. Farran, 409 S.W.3d 653, 657 (Tex. 2013) (“To be sure,\n\n3\n  For the reasons discussed in infra § I.B.5., even this limited requirement is likely not\njurisdictional.\n\n\n                                           13\n\fthe Whistleblower Act has its own statutory remedies and procedures that do not\n\nrequire exhaustion . . . .”).\n\n       Perez satisfied the Whistleblower Act by initiating the grievance procedure\n\nwithin thirty days of his termination from WISD. CR 257 at ¶¶ 16, 18. His alleged\n\nsubsequent failure to exhaust his administrative remedies is not relevant to his\n\nwhistleblower claim.\n\n              5.     Perez initiated his Whistleblower claim in a timely manner.\n\n       The Texas Whistleblower Act identifies specific deadlines by which claims\n\nmust be filed. These are not, however, jurisdictional. As plainly stated by the\n\nLegislature and the Supreme Court, sovereign immunity is waived—and a trial\n\ncourt will have jurisdiction—if “a public employee . . . alleges a violation” of the\n\nWhistleblower Act. Tex. Gov. Code § 554.0035. See also Lueck, 290 S.W.3d at\n\n881 (“[T]here are but two jurisdictional requirements under section 544.0035. For\n\nthe government’s immunity to be waived, the plaintiff must (1) be a public\n\nemployee and (2) allege a violation of [Chapter 554].”).\n\n       As such, failure to comply with the dates and deadlines—called a “limitation\n\nperiod” by the statute—“gives rise to the affirmative defense of limitations, but it\n\nis not grounds for a plea to the jurisdiction.” Tex. Dept. of Mental Health & Mental\n\nRetardation v. Olofsson, 59 S.W.3d 831, 832–33 (Tex. App.—Austin 2001, pet.\n\n\n\n\n                                        14\n\fdismissed). Simply put, “limitations is not a jurisdictional issue” and should not be\n\ndecided in a plea to the jurisdiction. Id.\n\nII.   The District Court has jurisdiction over Perez’s breach of reasonable\n      expectation of renewal claim.\n\n      Perez’s claim for breach of his reasonable expectation of renewal is brought\n\nin two forms: (1) as a breach of an implied term of his contract with WISD and\n\n(2) as a breach of Perez’s due process/due course of law rights. WISD did not\n\nchallenge the District Court’s jurisdiction to hear the latter.\n\n      WISD has a longstanding historical practice of renewing the contracts of its\n\nnon-Chapter 21 employees barring good cause or misconduct by that employee.\n\nCR 257 at ¶ 22. Moreover, Perez’s own course of dealings with WISD reinforced\n\nthis practice of expected renewals of annual employment contracts. Id. at ¶ 23\n\n(“WISD always represented to me that it would following this policy with me.\n\nWISD followed this policy until I disclosed its misconduct.”). This pattern of\n\nperformance and representations that renewal should be expected added an implied\n\nright to reasonable expect renewal to Defendant’s written employment contracts.\n\n      The Legislature has waived sovereign immunity for breach of written\n\ncontracts. See Tex. Loc. Gov. Code § 271.152. The existence of a written contract\n\nis merely a jurisdictional prerequisite to the types of contracts the Court can\n\nconstrue and enforce; it is not a substantive limit on how the Court can construe or\n\nenforce a contract. See Clear Lake City Water Auth. v. MCR Corp., No. 01-08-\n\n                                             15\n\f00955-CV, 2010 WL 1053057, at *9 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] Mar. 11,\n\n2010, pet. denied) (“The existence of any implied term within the agreement has\n\nno bearing on whether the agreement constitutes a written contract.”) The waiver\n\nof immunity applies “to any claims for breach of a contract falling within the terms\n\nof the statute. Once the trial court determines whether the contract falls within the\n\nprovisions of Section 271.152, it need not parse further the pleadings or the\n\ncontract to determine whether the legislature has waived immunity for breach of\n\ncontract claims.” City of Mesquite v. PKG Contracting, Inc., 263 S.W.3d 444, 447\n\n(Tex. App.—Dallas 2008, pet. denied).\n\n      Perez alleges that WISD breached an implied term of a written contract. As\n\nsuch, this claim falls within Section 271.152’s waiver of immunity.\n\n                                     Conclusion\n\n      WISD attempted to misappropriate its employee benefits funds and blame\n\nthe shortfall on the only man who tried to stop them. WISD’s vindictive review\n\nand termination of Perez violated the Texas Whistleblower Act and denied him his\n\nreasonable expectation of renewal. Perez prays that the Court reverse the District\n\nCourt and grant Perez all other relief to which he is entitled.\n\n\n\n\n                                          16\n\f     Respectfully submitted,\n\n     Hawash Meade Gaston\n     Neese & Cicack LLP\n\n     /s/ Samuel B.

Perez was employed as the Risk Manager of WJSD from July 2004 through June\n\n2010. A part of his responsibility in that position was to manage certain employee benefit plans,\n\n\n\n\n                                              A-2\n                                                                                                    410\n\f                                                                                 Electronically Filed\n                                                                                 10/30120141:42:16 PM\n                                                                                 Hidalgo County District Clerks\n                                                                                 Reviewed By: Miriam Castillo\n\n\nincluding specifically, the district's workers' compensation self-funded program and the se lf\n\nfunded employees' health insurance program.\n\n        7.     WISD has a longstanding practice of renewing all contracts of its employees,\n\nabsent cause, misconduct, or budgetary constraints. WISD continued this practice with Perez.\n\n        8.     From 2005 through 2009, Perez's work was commended by the district and his\n\nperfonnance reviews were more than satisfactory\n\n        9.     In early, 2009, Perez became aware that WISD wanted to and did unlawfully\n\nremove funds from those self-funded programs for the specific pu'rpose of beginning\n\nconslnlction of a new \"Press Box\" at the district football stadium. When Perez informed Mr.\n\nAmold Canche, the CFO of WISD, that the withdrawal and use of such funds violated state\n\ninsurance law and the covenants of the district's insurance policies (not to mention the misuse of\n\nfederal funds contributed), he was rebuked. Perez made several attempts to meet with Rivera\n\nregarding this issue, but was denied access to Rivera. Additionally, he was told that use of the\n\nfunds was inconsequential as they wou ld be repaid the following year upon passing of a bond\n\nelection.\n\n        10.    Perez also reported to his supervisor that the withdrawal of fu nds from the\n\nworker's compensation fund to re-fund the health insurance fillld was an improper use of both\n\nstate and federal funds . Again he was rebuked by Rivera with the same admonition.\n\n        11.   Perez continued to present these claims to his supervisor, as well as, other\n\nadministrators and members of the Board of Trustees for WISD.\n\n        12.   Perez further notified the Texas Education Agency (\"TEA\") by telephone\n\nconcerning WISD's misconduct. Pcrez was instructed to obtain documentation to support his\n\n\n\n\n                                                2\n                                            A-3\n                                                                                               411\n\f                                                                                  Electronically Filed\n                                                                                  10/30120141:42:16 PM\n                                                                                  Hidalgo County District Clerks\n                                                                                  Reviewed By: Miriam Castillo\n\n\nallegations. As such, Perez contacted WISD's business office and requested documents to show\n\nthe misconduct to the TEA. Upon information and belief, WISD was aware of this contact.\n\n        13.    Perez believed, based on his education and experience, that the TEA was the\n\nappropriate entity to whom he should make his report ofWISD's misconduct.\n\n        14.    Instead of correcting their improper and unlawful activity; in his 2010 review,\n\nWISD and Rivera repol1ed that up Perez did not work well witb others and had an improper\n\nattitude. This perfornlanee review contained numerous misrepresentations, including attempts to\n\nblame Perez for the misallocated funds.\n\n       15.     Perez's contract was not renewed upon its expiration in June 2010.\n\n       16.     Perez filed a fonnal complaint with the TEA concerning WISD's misconduct in\n\nJune 20 I O. This formal complaint was a follow-up to his previous telephonic report.\n\n       17.     WrSD's non-renewal of Perez was the culmination of a pattern of unlawful\n\nactivity designed to punish Perez and hide the unlawful conduct of WISD and its board\n\nmembers/employees.\n\n       18.     Perez filed a timely appeal of his non-renewal and commenced the grievance\n\nprocess. WISD ignored these procedures and renlsed to grant Perez a hearing. Due to the delay\n\nby WISD, Perez terminated the grievance process and filed this lawsuit.\n\n       19.     Perez's tennination has stigmatized Perez in the industry as a bad risk manager\n\nwho loses mOlley. This bas deprived him of his freedom to secure employment in his chosen\n\nfield of municipaVschool district risk management.\n\n\n\n\n                                                3\n                                             A-4\n                                                                                                 412\n\f                                                                                            Electronically Filed\n                                                                                            10/30f20141:42:16 PM\n                                                                                            Hidalgo County District Clerks\n                                                                                            Reviewed By: Miriam Castillo\n\n\n                                            CAUSES OF ACTION\n\nI.      Breach of ContI'act\n\n        20.       Due to both WISD's longstanding pattcm of renewals and WISD own\n\nrelationship with and represcntations to Perez, Perez's written employment contract included an\n\nimplied right of expectation of renewal.\n\n        2 1.      WlSD breached this implied tenn by refusing to renew Perez's contract despite\n\nthe lack of any cause or misconduct by Perez.\n\nII.     Texas Whistleblowel' Act\n\n        22.       Perez was tenl1inated in retaliation for his reporting of WISD's misconduct to\n\nTEA, a body Perez reasonably believed to be an enforcement body with respect to this matter.\n\nUI.     Constitutional Rights\n\n        23.       Perez was punished for his exercise of speech rights protected by the Texas\n\nConstitution. I\n\n        24.       Perez was denied his property interest in a reasonable expectation of renewal\n\nwithout due process, due course, or equal protection of law under the Texas Constitution.\n\n        25.       Perez was denied his liberty interest in serving as a risk manager for another\n\nschooVgovenul1cntal body without due process, duc course, or equal protection of law under the\n\nTexas Constitution.\n\n                                                 DAMAGES\n\n        26.

I am over the age of eighteen (18) ycms, have never been\n      cOllvicted of 11 felony or a crime of moral tmpitudc, and lUll competent to make this\n      affidavit. I have personal knowledge of the facts contained herein, and the fhets are tmc\n      and corrcct.\n\n   2. T have worked for over 30 years in insurance and risk management for private companies,\n      state bureaucracies, and Weslaco Independent School District (\"WIS))\").\n\n   3. In August of 2004, I began employment with WISD. ] worked as risk manager for\n      Weslaco for six yeMrs. Dming my first five years of employment, ] consistently received\n      positive evaluations and was nevel' reprimanded by my superiors,\n\n   4, Tn fall of2009, ] attended a WISD board mceting and learned that WISD received eel1uin\n      state and federal funds thai wcre to he utilized for WTSD's self-funded employee's hcnlth\n      insurunce and workers' compensation insurance I'CSCI'VC, Instead, these funds were lIsed to   ,,\n      finance construction of an expansion of tile WlSD football sladhlln.                          I,\n                                                                                                    ,1\n   5, Upon discovering this infonmltioJl, I alerted my immedintc supervisors, Andres Sallehez\n      and Arnold Cunche, I told them that] believed the transfer of the cncumbered funds was\n      illegal. They told me Ihnt at the time that it was not a concern.\n\n\n\n\n                                            A-8\n\f                                                                      (\n\n\n\n\n6. I became concerned that nothing was being done regard ing the illega l transfer of funds . I\n   made several attempts to contact WISD's superintendent, Richard Rivera, but Rivera\n   refused to meet with me. When 1 fi nally was nble to voice my concerns to Rivera, Rivero\n   expressed his disapproval mul criticized my concern as being m isguided.\n\n7.    In early 20 10, r contacted my cousi n Nancy I-Iucrl'cra, an attol'llcy with the U.S. Attorney\n     General Offi ce, to ask for her advice on the situation. My cOllsin recommended that I\n     contact the Texas Edllcation Agency (\"TEA\") to report the illegal activity.\n\ng. Shortly After, I contacted TEA over the phone in effort to make a report of the illega l\n   activ ity. I informed a representative of TEA that WISD un lawfully removed funds from\n   self-funded programs fo r the purpose of begi nning constl'llctioll of a new 'press box' at\n   the District's footba ll stad ium; that the District withdrew funds from the worker's\n   compensation fund to refu nd the health insurance fund; and that I had prev iously reported\n   this to my supervisors. The representative of T.EA informed me that he would need to\n   obtain physical evidence in order for TEA to initiate 0 formol invesl'igation.\n\n9. Tdo not recall the exact date that J contacted TEA, but I do know that it was before I\n   received my negative performance eval uation and was notified that WISD wus not\n                                                                                                        i\n     renewi ng my cont ract.                                                                            l\n                                                                                                        II\n10. Based on my education and expel'ience, r believed that the TEA wus the appropriate\n    cntity to whom 1 should make my report of the vio lation of law. I a lso fo llowed the\n    recommendation of my cOl1sin who was all emp loyee of the U.S. Attorney General\n    Office.\n\nII . A ll times during my employment, WrSD held the TEA out as the appropriate regu latory\n     enforcement agency related to laws governing the school district\n\n12. Thereafter, r contacted the District's business department in efTort La obtain physical\n    evidence to substantiate his claim. 1 requested and received documentation that 1 believe\n                                                                                                        I,\n    showed that the fimds were bcing used in an unlawful mannel'.                                       ,\n                                                                                                        l\n13. On Pebl1lary 5, 2010, I was ca lled in fbI' n meeting w ith Dr. A lej andl'O, the District's        I\n    Deputy Superintcndent. At the meeting, J received a negative performance evaluation and\n                                                                                                        !\n                                                                                                        !\n    was in rormed thal the D istrict was not going to renew my contract fo r the next year.\n\n\n\n                                              2\n                                                                                                        I\n                                            A-9                                                   256\n\f 14. 1 wns shocked by the evaluation because I had rcccived positive reviews for my entirc\n     employment with WISD. I did not suspect Ihnt I was being retal iated against for my\n     reports to lhe TEA until after 1 consulted with my attorney.\n\n 15. At no time was I l'ccommcnded fol' tC!1nination by WISD, nor was noy action takcn to\n    initiate a termination ormy employment.\n\n16. I continued working through the term of my em ployment cont ract which expired by its\n    own terlll on June 2 1, 2010.\n\n17. On June 17,20 10, I scot a Icttcr to the TEA explaining the mi snppropriation of funds by\n    the District to fo llow up on his prior report in cady 20 1O.\n\n18. On July 20, 2010, Perez initiated his adm inistrativc complaint by sUbmitting    II   Level\n    Employee Complaint Form.\n\n19. On Dccembcr 1,20 10, my lawyer and WISD's counsel attcnded a meeting togcther. I\n    was undcr the imprcssion that the meeting was to be a sett lement discussion, but WISD\n    appat'cntly believed it was go ing to be a Level I Complaint hearing. , did not attend this\n    hearing.\n\n20. On Det:ember 15,20 10, WISD sent my lawyer notice that my Level I Grievance was\n    denied und thnt 1 had ten days to fi le an appcal.\n\n2\\. On March 8, 20 11 , r fi led th is lawsuit seeking damages fo r wrongful termination ami\n    retaliation by WISD against me.\n\n22 .

These transfers may be a violatIon 01 Secllon\n               §11 04(8) and §1106{a) altha Employee Retlroment Income Security Act (see\n               Appendix A and 8).\n\nFinding        The dlstricl's use of surplus funds Irom.the health Insurance lund and workers'\n               camp fund for construction purposes may be unallowable.\n\nInvestlgatlve Through Interviews with district personnel, auditors discovered thaI the district's\nSurnmary      sel!·fundad health Insurance program Is fundGd by a combination of premiums\n              paid by the distnct for employees that choose lis base Insurance ptan as wall as\n              premiums paid by amployees for upgraded plans lor themSelves and their\n              dependents. The workers' compensation Insurance program is funded by the\n              district and Is based on a percentage of each employee's salnry.\n\n              A review of board minutes provided by the district disclosed thai on May 18, 2009,\n              the board of trustees approved a transfer of $1 million from the health insurance\n              fund !o tha worksrs' camp fUnd and a subsequent transfer of $2 million from tho\n              workers' comp fund to the construcllon fund (see Exhibit A. page 12). Board\n              mInutes frorn a meetlng held on AugUSll0, 2009, afso shOw thatlhe funding for\n              the cons\\ruollon of n new press box would be partially funded with workers' comp\n              fund reserves, not the health Insurance fund (see Exhibit B). However, the\n              auditors' review of the district's Lone Star Investment Pool statements revealed               ,\n              thai the dIstrict did not make the firs\\lransler from the health Insurance fund to the\n              workers' camp fund. Jnstcad, $1 million was transferred Irom oach fUnd directly to\n              the construcUon lund on May 29, 2009.

The transfer from the heallh\n              Insurance lund to Ihe constructlcn lund In May 2009 was Intended to wrepay\" that\n              loan. However, the dis\\flct has nol provided the auditors with evidence thai money\n              was Iransferred between the funds In 2006, nor thai such a \"loan\" was approved\n              by the board.\n\n              Subsequent to the auditors' on·site vlsll, the distr!ct staled that the transfer 01\n              monies from the workers' comp fund to the construction fund was allowable under\n              SecUon 504.072 of the Texas Labor Code (see: Appendix C). Although this statute\n              provides a list of disbursements I'l'1al are allowable. it Is silent on the use 01\n              appropriations for construcUon purposes.\n\n              Further, because the district did not provide evidence that a loan existed between\n              the health Insurance fund and the workers' camp fund, It appears Ihatthe district\n              used money contributed by emptoyees to fW'Id the construction 01 the new\n              stadium press box. This may constitute a broach of fiduciary duty by the district.\n\nAnalysis of   After a review 01 documentallon received from the district. auditors concluded that\nResponse      Ihe transfer of lOonies from the workers' compensation fund to tho construction\n              lund was not allowable undQr Secllon 504.072 of the Toxas Labor Code. This\n              statute provides a list of allowable disbursements and the use of appropriations\n              for construction purposes Is nollncluded In the list.

Therefore, the auditors' pOSition related to the Iransler of monies from\n              the worker's compensallon lund to the construction fund remains unchanged.\n\n\nUnallowable uses 01 the Instructional Faclilties Allotment\n\nConcern       The district used leftover monies from ilS Insttuctlonal Facilities AliotmGnt (lFA)\n              funds lor purposes other than instructional facilities.

Id. at ¶¶ 23–25.\n\n       In June 2012, WISD filed a plea to the jurisdiction with respect to all claims\n\nother than the Texas Whistleblower Act. CR 27. The 332nd District Court of\n\nHidalgo County, Texas (the “District Court”) denied that plea to the jurisdiction in\n\nSeptember 2012. CR 110. This Court affirmed in part and reversed in part. CR\n\n207.\n\n       In October 2014, WISD filed a plea to the jurisdiction (the “Plea”) with\n\nrespect to Perez’s claims for violation of the Texas Whistleblower Act and for\n\nbreach of his reasonable expectation of contract renewal. CR 94. The 332nd\n\nDistrict Court granted the Plea on December 17, 2015. CR 409.

Soliz v. Nueces County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1405145\"><a href=\"/opinion/1405145/soliz-v-nueces-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 300 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi-Edinburg 2003, pet. denied). In making that\n\ndetermination, this Court has held that:\n\n      We construe the pleadings liberally in favor of the plaintiff and look\n      to the pleaders’ intent. If the pleadings do not contain sufficient facts\n      to affirmatively demonstrate the trial court’s jurisdiction but do not\n      affirmatively demonstrate incurable defects in jurisdiction, the issue is\n      one of pleading sufficiency and the plaintiff should be afforded an\n      opportunity to amend. . . . Even a failure to allege sufficient facts to\n      demonstrate jurisdiction does not necessarily authorize immediate\n      dismissal. It is only where the court can see that, even by amendment,\n      no cause of action can be stated consistent with the facts alleged that\n      the court is without jurisdiction.\n\n      If the plea challenges the existence of jurisdictional facts, we consider\n      relevant evidence submitted by the parties when necessary to resolve\n      the jurisdictional issue raised, as the trial court is required to do so. In\n      a case in which the jurisdictional challenge implicates the merits of\n      the plaintiff’s cause of action and the plea to the jurisdiction includes\n      evidence, the trial court reviews the relevant evidence to determine if\n      a fact issue exists. If a fact question exists, then the plea cannot be\n      granted and the fact issue will be resolved by the fact finder.\n\nWeslaco Ind. Sch. Dist. v.

App.—Corpus Christi-Edinburg Jul. 25, 2013) (no pet.).\n\n                                 Statement of Facts\n\n      From July 2004 through June 2010, Perez was a risk manager for WISD.\n\nCR 410 at ¶ 6. WISD had a longstanding pattern and practice of automatically\n\n\n\n                                           1\n\frenewing all of its employment contracts except in the case of cause, misconduct,\n\nor budgetary problems. CR 411 at ¶ 7. From 2005 through 2005, Perez was\n\nroutinely commended for his performance, and his performance reviews were more\n\nthan satisfactory. Id. at ¶ 8. True to its de facto policy, WISD renewed Perez’s\n\nemployment contract every year until the events giving rise to this litigation. See\n\nid. at ¶ 7. WISD even represented to Perez that it would follow that policy with\n\nhim. CR 257 at ¶ 23.\n\n      As WISD’s risk manager, Perez managed employee benefit plans, including\n\nWISD’s self-funded workers’ compensation and self-funded employee health\n\ninsurance plans. CR 410–11 at ¶ 6. In early 2009, Perez became aware of a scheme\n\nwithin WISD to siphon money from the self-funded programs into a construction\n\nfund with which to build a new press box at WISD’s football stadium. CR 411\n\nat ¶ 9. Perez understood that such misappropriation of self-funded plan amounts—\n\nespecially those which had received state and federal funds—violated state and\n\nfederal statutes and regulations. Id.\n\n      Perez did not sit idly by while the funds under his charge were illegally\n\ndrained. Perez made repeated attempts to warn WISD’s management,\n\nsuperintendent, and board members of this unlawful misappropriation. Id. In\n\nreturn, Perez was either rebuked or ignored. Id. at ¶¶ 9–11; CR 255–56 at ¶¶ 5–6.\n\n\n\n\n                                        2\n\fPerez was even told that the shortfall in the employee benefit funds were not a\n\nserious concern as they would be repaid from future bond sales. Id. at ¶ 9.\n\n      Tired of fruitlessly complaining to administrators who were either (at best)\n\nwillfully ignorant or (at worst) complicit, Perez decided to seek outside help. See\n\nCR 411–12 at ¶ 12. Perez contacted the Texas Education Agency (“TEA”) by\n\ntelephone to report WISD’s misuse of funds. CR 256 at ¶¶ 8–9. In order to\n\nsubstantiate Perez’s accusations, the TEA asked Perez to obtain documentation\n\nshowing WISD’s misappropriations. CR 411–12 at ¶ 12. To do so, Perez contacted\n\nthe WISD business office and requested certain documents showing the illicit\n\ntransfer of funds. See id. Perez believes WISD became aware of his investigation\n\nand his contact with TEA. Id.\n\n      WISD did not use Perez’s warnings and the impending TEA investigation to\n\nchange their ways. Instead, they doubled-down and decided to punish Perez for\n\nblowing the whistle. After a long string of glowing performance reviews, Perez\n\nwas rated poorly in 2010—his first review after contacting the TEA. CR 412 at ¶\n\n14. This review made numerous false accusations about Perez’s work and\n\nrecommended that Perez’s contract not be renewed. Id.; CR 389–92, 394. Despite\n\nWISD’s longstanding pattern and practice of renewing all employment contracts,\n\nPerez’s contract was not renewed in and he ceased to be a WISD employee on June\n\n21, 2010. CR 412 at ¶ 15, CR 394.\n\n\n                                         3\n\f      Perez filed an appeal of his termination on July 20, 2010. CR 297. On\n\nOctober 28, 2010, WISD set a hearing for November 1, 2010. CR 91. That original\n\nhearing date was cancelled. WISD and Perez’s counsel finally met on December 1,\n\n2010. CR 257 at ¶ 19. Although Perez and his counsel were under the impression\n\nthat this was to be a settlement discussion, WISD held an unannounced Level 1\n\ncomplaint hearing. Id. Perez filed suit against WISD on March 8, 2011. Id. at ¶ 21.\n\n      Perez was never reinstated by WISD, and the stigma of the false and\n\ndisparaging performance review/termination has left Perez unable to find work in\n\nhis chosen profession of municipal/school district risk management. Id. at ¶ 19;\n\nCR 257 at ¶ 24.\n\n                           Summary of the Argument\n\n      The District Court has jurisdiction over Perez’s Whistleblower claim. WISD\n\nviolated numerous state and federal statutes/regulations by secretly using its\n\nemployee benefit funds to pay for stadium improvements. Because the TEA is\n\ncharged with regulating and overseeing such transactions, it was an appropriate\n\nlaw enforcement authority for purposes of the Whistleblower Act. WISD learned\n\nof this whistleblowing and terminated Perez in retaliation.\n\n      The District Court likewise has jurisdiction over Perez’s breach of\n\nreasonable expectation of contract renewal. Perez had a written contract with\n\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\fWISD which included an implied expectation of renewal. The mere existence of an\n\nimplied term in a written contract did not deprive the District Court of jurisdiction.\n\n                                      Argument\n\n      WISD challenged the District Court’s jurisdiction over Perez’s claims for\n\nviolation of the Texas Whistleblower Act and breach of the reasonable expectation\n\nof renewal. Perez will show the Court that the District Court has jurisdiction over\n\nhis claims and erred by granting WISD’s Plea.\n\nI.    The District Court has jurisdiction over Perez’s whistleblower claim.\n\n      A.     Perez alleged sufficient facts to establish the District Court’s\n             jurisdiction.\n\n      The Texas Whistleblower Act waives sovereign immunity with respect to\n\n“[a] public employee who alleges a violation” of Chapter 554 of the Texas\n\nGovernment Code. Tex. Gov. Code § 554.0035. The Texas Supreme Court has\n\ninterpreted this literally: “there are but two jurisdictional requirements under\n\nsection 544.0035. For the government’s immunity to be waived, the plaintiff must\n\n(1) be a public employee and (2) allege a violation of [Chapter 554].” State v.\n\nLueck, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895134\"><a href=\"/opinion/895134/state-v-lueck/\"><span class=\"volume\">290</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 881 (Tex. 2009) (emphasis removed).\n\n      In the context of a plea to the jurisdiction, a court may consider the “merits”\n\nof a plaintiff’s claim only to the extent “necessary to resolve whether a plaintiff has\n\nalleged a violation under the [Whistleblower] Act.” Id. at 881. This “does not mean\n\nthat [a plaintiff] must prove [its] claim in order to satisfy the jurisdictional hurdle.”\n\n\n                                           5\n\fId. at 884. The statute only requires an “alleg[ation]” of the necessary elements,\n\nand the Texas Supreme Court “ha[s] urged that the burden of proof with respect to\n\nthese jurisdictional facts does not involve a significant inquiry into the substance of\n\nthe claims.” Id.\n\n       Perez’s live pleading (the “Petition”) alleges both of the jurisdictional\n\nprerequisites for waiver immunity under the Texas Whistleblower Act.1 See CR\n\n410–415.\n\n              1.      Perez alleged that he was a public employee.\n\n       The first jurisdictional element is that the plaintiff was a public employee at\n\nthe time of the unlawful retaliation. See Lueck, 290 S.W.3d at 881. Perez’s Petition\n\nalleges that he “was employed as the Risk Manager of WISD from July 2004\n\nthrough June 2010.” CR 410 at ¶ 6. WISD has not challenged that this element has\n\nbeen adequately pled.\n\n              2.      Perez alleged that WISD violated the Texas Whistleblower\n                      Act.\n\n       The second element for waiver of immunity requires Perez to plead that\n\nWISD violated Chapter 554 of the Texas Government Code. Lueck, 290 S.W.3d at\n\n881. The Whistleblower Act provides Perez with the following protection:\n\n\n\n1\n  Alternatively, the Petition does not allege any facts demonstrating that Perez cannot meet the\nelements of the Texas Whistleblower Act, so repleading would be the proper remedy instead of\noutright dismissal.

Gov. Code § 554.002(a). Perez has alleged precisely this.\n\n      Perez’s theory of the case is simple: WISD misappropriated funds in\n\nviolation of state and federal law. Perez blew the whistle internally, and WISD\n\nignored him. Perez blew the whistle to the TEA, and WISD gave him a false\n\nperformance review and fired him. See generally CR 410–15. No more is required\n\nto establish jurisdiction over a whistleblower claim.\n\n      B.     WISD’s challenges to Perez’s pleadings are based on mistaken\n             interpretations of fact and law.\n\n      WISD’s Plea challenged Perez’s whistleblower allegation in five respects:\n\n(1) the timing of the whistleblowing versus the adverse employment\n\naction, (2) WISD’s violation of law, (3) whether the TEA is an appropriate law\n\nenforcement body, (4) exhaustion of administrative remedies, and (5) the statute of\n\nlimitations. As demonstrated below, these arguments do not defeat the District\n\nCourt’s jurisdiction.\n\n             1.     Perez blew the whistle to the TEA prior to his performance\n                    review and subsequent termination.\n\n      WISD complains that he notified the TEA about WISD’s misappropriation\n\nof funds after his performance review and termination. CR 118–120. But Perez’s\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\fPetition and affidavit show that he initially blew the whistle to TEA prior to his\n\nperformance review. CR 256 at ¶¶ 8–9, 411–12 at ¶¶ 12–14.\n\n             2.    Perez blew the whistle on illegal activity.\n\n      WISD next complains that, in his deposition, non-attorney Perez could not\n\ncite an exact statutory provision violated by WISD. CR 120–123. Under Texas\n\nlaw, however, a whistleblower is not required to “identify a specific law when\n\nmaking a report . . . .” Llanes v. Corpus Christi Ind. Sch.

Similarly, the whistleblower is not\n\nrequired to “prove that a violation of law actually occurred.” Id. “In other words,\n\nwhen an employee believes and reports in good faith that a violation has occurred,\n\nbut is wrong about the legal effect of the facts, he is nevertheless protected by the\n\nwhistleblower statute.” Tex.

App.—Austin 2007, pet. denied).\n\n      Perez’s response to WISD’s Plea pointed-out several statutes and regulations\n\nwhich were violated by WISD. See CR 239 at ¶ 46. For example, title 34, section\n\n80.43 of the Code of Federal Regulations punishes persons who “materially fail[]\n\nto comply with the terms of an award[ed]” federal grant. 34 C.F.R. § 80.43(a).\n\nPerez has alleged that WISD misused funds which came, in part, from federal\n\ngrants and that such use was not in compliance with the terms of those grants. CR\n\n411 at ¶ 9–10.\n\n\n\n                                         8\n\f      United State Code, title 29, sections 1104 and 1106 prohibit certain\n\ntransactions by fiduciaries of various self-funded plans. See 29 U.S.C. §§ 1104(a),\n\n1106(a)–(b). Perez has alleged that WISD engaged in the sort of misallocating and\n\nself-dealing prohibited by these sections. See CR 411 at ¶¶ 9–10. WISD argues that\n\nit is not bound by these provisions. CR 419. Perez respectfully submits that such an\n\nargument on the merits should be brought through a motion for summary judgment\n\nand not in a plea to the jurisdiction.\n\n      Section 540.072 of the Texas Labor Code allows a political subdivision to\n\nset-aside funds for workers’ compensation benefits “in a separate account . . .”\n\nTex. Lab. Code 504.072(b). Funds so set aside must be “sufficient to pay all costs”\n\nassociated with the workers’ compensation coverage and are subject to special\n\nsegregation, accounting, and disclosure rules. Tex. Lab. Code § 504.072. Perez has\n\nalleged that WISD violated this statute by secretly raiding the workers’\n\ncompensation fund and leaving a shortfall. Perez is not alone in his belief that\n\nWISD violated this statute. After an investigation, the TEA’s auditor found that\n\n“the transfer of monies from the workers’ compensation fund to the construction\n\nfund was not allowable under Section 504.072 of the Texas Labor Code.” CR 398.\n\nAs stated by the TEA, section 504.072 “provides a list of allowable disbursement\n\nand the use of appropriations for construction purposes is not included in the list.”\n\nId.\n\n\n                                         9\n\f       Section 41.105 of the Texas Education Code sets forth a variety of\n\n“authorized expenditures” of “public school funds.” Tex. Educ. Code § 41.105(a).\n\nAlthough the statute authorizes many types of expenditures of school funds, it does\n\nnot appear to authorize (1) the use of funds “designated for a specific purpose” to\n\nbe used for improving athletic facilities or (2) the use of bond proceeds to repay\n\nsecret debits from employee benefits funds. See Tex. Educ. Code § 41.105(c).\n\nPerez has alleged that WISD violated this statute by using and intending use funds\n\nin unauthorized manners.\n\n       Finally, section 61.1018 of the Texas Administrative Code allows the TEA\n\nto “distribute staff salary allotment funds” to school districts participating in the\n\nTeacher Retirement System—such as WISD—“for the purpose of making\n\npayments of health care supplementation” to certain full-time employees.2 Tex.\n\nAdmin. Code § 61.1018(a), (b)(1)(A). Perez’s Petition shows that WISD violated\n\nthis regulation by using health care funds for other purposes. CR 411 at ¶¶ 9–10.\n\n       Perez has shown that he blew the whistle on unlawful conduct.\n\n              3.     Perez had a good-faith belief that the TEA was an\n                     appropriate law enforcement authority.\n\n       To take refuge under the Texas Whistleblower Act, the plaintiff must report\n\nthe unlawful actions to “an appropriate law enforcement authority . . . that the\n\n2\n This violation was not alleged in Perez’s response to WISD’s Plea. It is, however, an example\nof the sort of violation which could be alleged if Perez is required to replead.\n\n\n                                             10\n\femployee in good faith believes is authorized to: (1) regulate under or enforce the\n\nlaw alleged to be violated in the report; or (2) investigate or prosecute a violation\n\nof criminal law.” Tex. Gov. Code § 554.002(b). The Texas Supreme Court has\n\nclarified that a body will “constitute an appropriate law-enforcement authority\n\nunder the Whistleblower Act” if it has the “authority” to “investigate . . . violations\n\nof the law against third parties” or has “authority to promulgate regulations\n\ngoverning the conduct of such third parties.” Univ. of Houston v.

The whistleblower’s “belief can only satisfy the good-faith requirement if a\n\nreasonably prudent employee in similar circumstances would have thought so.” Id.\n\n      Perez has averred that he contacted the TEA for several subjective reasons.\n\nFirst, an attorney at the United States Attorney General’s office suggested it to\n\nhim. CR 256 at ¶ 7. This made sense to Perez because, “based on [his] education\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\fand experience, [Perez] believed that the TEA was the appropriate entity to [which\n\nhe] should make [his] report of the violation of law.” Id. at ¶ 10. Perez further\n\nbelieved that the TEA would hold authority over WISD because, at “[a]ll times\n\nduring [his] employment, WISD held the TEA out as the appropriate regulatory\n\nenforcement agency related to the laws governing the school district.” Id. at ¶ 11.\n\nFor purposes of a plea to the jurisdiction, this is sufficient proof of subjective\n\nbelief.\n\n          Perez’s belief that the TEA was an appropriate body to regulate a school\n\ndistrict’s financial improprieties was objectively reasonable. As stated above, a\n\nbody is an appropriate law enforcement authority if it has the power to, inter alia,\n\ninvestigate third parties or promulgate rules governing third parties. Univ. of\n\nHouston, 403 S.W.3d at 857. The TEA does both.\n\n          The TEA is statutorily empowered to “review school district budgets, audit\n\nreports, and other fiscal reports . . . .” Tex. Educ. Code § 7.021(b)(13). In so doing,\n\nthe TEA is allowed to “determine whether all legal requirements have been met”\n\nwith respect to those budgets/reports. Tex. Educ. Code § 44.010. In fact, the TEA\n\nasserted the authority to “regulate under or enforce the law alleged to be violated”\n\nwhen it (1) audited WISD’s illicit transfer of the funds and (2) required WISD to\n\nsubmit a corrective action plan within ten business days. CR 396.\n\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\f      The TEA likewise has significant rulemaking authority concerning WISD’s\n\nmisconduct. The TEA is statutorily authorized to promulgate the format of school\n\ndistricts’ budgets and financial reports. Tex. Educ. Code § 44.009(a). Moreover,\n\nthe TEA has promulgated rules governing, inter alia, (1) use healthcare funds, (2)\n\npayments for facilities, and (3) spending of other allotted high school funds. Tex.\n\nAdmin. Code §§ 61.1032, 61.1093, 61.1018.\n\n      In light of these investigatory and rulemaking functions, a reasonably\n\nprudent WISD employee would believe that TEA had the power to promulgate and\n\nenforce statutes and regulations concerning a school district’s misuse of employee\n\nbenefit funds.\n\n             4.     Perez was not required to exhaust his administrative\n                    remedies.\n\n      WISD further complains that Perez “fail[e]d to exhaust his administrative\n\nremedies as required by the Texas Whistleblower Act.” CR 127. This too is\n\nincorrect.\n\n      The Texas Whistleblower Act requires a complaining employee to “initiate\n\naction under the grievance or appeal procedures” of his employer.3 Tex. Gov. Code\n\n§ 554.006(a). The employee is not, however, required to exhaust those remedies.\n\nCanutillo Ind. Sch. Dist. v.

CR 257 at ¶¶ 16, 18. His alleged\n\nsubsequent failure to exhaust his administrative remedies is not relevant to his\n\nwhistleblower claim.\n\n              5.     Perez initiated his Whistleblower claim in a timely manner.\n\n       The Texas Whistleblower Act identifies specific deadlines by which claims\n\nmust be filed. These are not, however, jurisdictional. As plainly stated by the\n\nLegislature and the Supreme Court, sovereign immunity is waived—and a trial\n\ncourt will have jurisdiction—if “a public employee . . . alleges a violation” of the\n\nWhistleblower Act. Tex. Gov. Code § 554.0035. See also Lueck, 290 S.W.3d at\n\n881 (“[T]here are but two jurisdictional requirements under section 544.0035. For\n\nthe government’s immunity to be waived, the plaintiff must (1) be a public\n\nemployee and (2) allege a violation of [Chapter 554].”).\n\n       As such, failure to comply with the dates and deadlines—called a “limitation\n\nperiod” by the statute—“gives rise to the affirmative defense of limitations, but it\n\nis not grounds for a plea to the jurisdiction.” Tex.

The District Court has jurisdiction over Perez’s breach of reasonable\n      expectation of renewal claim.\n\n      Perez’s claim for breach of his reasonable expectation of renewal is brought\n\nin two forms: (1) as a breach of an implied term of his contract with WISD and\n\n(2) as a breach of Perez’s due process/due course of law rights. WISD did not\n\nchallenge the District Court’s jurisdiction to hear the latter.\n\n      WISD has a longstanding historical practice of renewing the contracts of its\n\nnon-Chapter 21 employees barring good cause or misconduct by that employee.\n\nCR 257 at ¶ 22. Moreover, Perez’s own course of dealings with WISD reinforced\n\nthis practice of expected renewals of annual employment contracts. Id. at ¶ 23\n\n(“WISD always represented to me that it would following this policy with me.\n\nWISD followed this policy until I disclosed its misconduct.”). This pattern of\n\nperformance and representations that renewal should be expected added an implied\n\nright to reasonable expect renewal to Defendant’s written employment contracts.\n\n      The Legislature has waived sovereign immunity for breach of written\n\ncontracts. See Tex. Loc. Gov. Code § 271.152. The existence of a written contract\n\nis merely a jurisdictional prerequisite to the types of contracts the Court can\n\nconstrue and enforce; it is not a substantive limit on how the Court can construe or\n\nenforce a contract.

WISD’s vindictive review\n\nand termination of Perez violated the Texas Whistleblower Act and denied him his\n\nreasonable expectation of renewal.

Perez was employed as the Risk Manager of WJSD from July 2004 through June\n\n2010. A part of his responsibility in that position was to manage certain employee benefit plans,\n\n\n\n\n                                              A-2\n                                                                                                    410\n\f                                                                                 Electronically Filed\n                                                                                 10/30120141:42:16 PM\n                                                                                 Hidalgo County District Clerks\n                                                                                 Reviewed By: Miriam Castillo\n\n\nincluding specifically, the district's workers' compensation self-funded program and the se lf\n\nfunded employees' health insurance program.\n\n        7.     WISD has a longstanding practice of renewing all contracts of its employees,\n\nabsent cause, misconduct, or budgetary constraints. WISD continued this practice with Perez.\n\n        8.     From 2005 through 2009, Perez's work was commended by the district and his\n\nperfonnance reviews were more than satisfactory\n\n        9.     In early, 2009, Perez became aware that WISD wanted to and did unlawfully\n\nremove funds from those self-funded programs for the specific pu'rpose of beginning\n\nconslnlction of a new \"Press Box\" at the district football stadium. When Perez informed Mr.\n\nAmold Canche, the CFO of WISD, that the withdrawal and use of such funds violated state\n\ninsurance law and the covenants of the district's insurance policies (not to mention the misuse of\n\nfederal funds contributed), he was rebuked. Perez made several attempts to meet with Rivera\n\nregarding this issue, but was denied access to Rivera. Additionally, he was told that use of the\n\nfunds was inconsequential as they wou ld be repaid the following year upon passing of a bond\n\nelection.\n\n        10.    Perez also reported to his supervisor that the withdrawal of fu nds from the\n\nworker's compensation fund to re-fund the health insurance fillld was an improper use of both\n\nstate and federal funds . Again he was rebuked by Rivera with the same admonition.\n\n        11.   Perez continued to present these claims to his supervisor, as well as, other\n\nadministrators and members of the Board of Trustees for WISD.\n\n        12.   Perez further notified the Texas Education Agency (\"TEA\") by telephone\n\nconcerning WISD's misconduct. Pcrez was instructed to obtain documentation to support his\n\n\n\n\n                                                2\n                                            A-3\n                                                                                               411\n\f                                                                                  Electronically Filed\n                                                                                  10/30120141:42:16 PM\n                                                                                  Hidalgo County District Clerks\n                                                                                  Reviewed By: Miriam Castillo\n\n\nallegations. As such, Perez contacted WISD's business office and requested documents to show\n\nthe misconduct to the TEA. Upon information and belief, WISD was aware of this contact.\n\n        13.    Perez believed, based on his education and experience, that the TEA was the\n\nappropriate entity to whom he should make his report ofWISD's misconduct.\n\n        14.    Instead of correcting their improper and unlawful activity; in his 2010 review,\n\nWISD and Rivera repol1ed that up Perez did not work well witb others and had an improper\n\nattitude. This perfornlanee review contained numerous misrepresentations, including attempts to\n\nblame Perez for the misallocated funds.\n\n       15.     Perez's contract was not renewed upon its expiration in June 2010.\n\n       16.     Perez filed a fonnal complaint with the TEA concerning WISD's misconduct in\n\nJune 20 I O. This formal complaint was a follow-up to his previous telephonic report.\n\n       17.     WrSD's non-renewal of Perez was the culmination of a pattern of unlawful\n\nactivity designed to punish Perez and hide the unlawful conduct of WISD and its board\n\nmembers/employees.\n\n       18.     Perez filed a timely appeal of his non-renewal and commenced the grievance\n\nprocess. WISD ignored these procedures and renlsed to grant Perez a hearing. Due to the delay\n\nby WISD, Perez terminated the grievance process and filed this lawsuit.\n\n       19.     Perez's tennination has stigmatized Perez in the industry as a bad risk manager\n\nwho loses mOlley. This bas deprived him of his freedom to secure employment in his chosen\n\nfield of municipaVschool district risk management.\n\n\n\n\n                                                3\n                                             A-4\n                                                                                                 412\n\f                                                                                            Electronically Filed\n                                                                                            10/30f20141:42:16 PM\n                                                                                            Hidalgo County District Clerks\n                                                                                            Reviewed By: Miriam Castillo\n\n\n                                            CAUSES OF ACTION\n\nI.      Breach of ContI'act\n\n        20.       Due to both WISD's longstanding pattcm of renewals and WISD own\n\nrelationship with and represcntations to Perez, Perez's written employment contract included an\n\nimplied right of expectation of renewal.\n\n        2 1.      WlSD breached this implied tenn by refusing to renew Perez's contract despite\n\nthe lack of any cause or misconduct by Perez.\n\nII.     Texas Whistleblowel' Act\n\n        22.       Perez was tenl1inated in retaliation for his reporting of WISD's misconduct to\n\nTEA, a body Perez reasonably believed to be an enforcement body with respect to this matter.\n\nUI.     Constitutional Rights\n\n        23.       Perez was punished for his exercise of speech rights protected by the Texas\n\nConstitution. I\n\n        24.       Perez was denied his property interest in a reasonable expectation of renewal\n\nwithout due process, due course, or equal protection of law under the Texas Constitution.\n\n        25.

I am over the age of eighteen (18) ycms, have never been\n      cOllvicted of 11 felony or a crime of moral tmpitudc, and lUll competent to make this\n      affidavit. I have personal knowledge of the facts contained herein, and the fhets are tmc\n      and corrcct.\n\n   2. T have worked for over 30 years in insurance and risk management for private companies,\n      state bureaucracies, and Weslaco Independent School District (\"WIS))\").\n\n   3. In August of 2004, I began employment with WISD. ] worked as risk manager for\n      Weslaco for six yeMrs. Dming my first five years of employment, ] consistently received\n      positive evaluations and was nevel' reprimanded by my superiors,\n\n   4, Tn fall of2009, ] attended a WISD board mceting and learned that WISD received eel1uin\n      state and federal funds thai wcre to he utilized for WTSD's self-funded employee's hcnlth\n      insurunce and workers' compensation insurance I'CSCI'VC, Instead, these funds were lIsed to   ,,\n      finance construction of an expansion of tile WlSD football sladhlln.                          I,\n                                                                                                    ,1\n   5, Upon discovering this infonmltioJl, I alerted my immedintc supervisors, Andres Sallehez\n      and Arnold Cunche, I told them that] believed the transfer of the cncumbered funds was\n      illegal. They told me Ihnt at the time that it was not a concern.\n\n\n\n\n                                            A-8\n\f                                                                      (\n\n\n\n\n6. I became concerned that nothing was being done regard ing the illega l transfer of funds . I\n   made several attempts to contact WISD's superintendent, Richard Rivera, but Rivera\n   refused to meet with me. When 1 fi nally was nble to voice my concerns to Rivera, Rivero\n   expressed his disapproval mul criticized my concern as being m isguided.\n\n7.    In early 20 10, r contacted my cousi n Nancy I-Iucrl'cra, an attol'llcy with the U.S. Attorney\n     General Offi ce, to ask for her advice on the situation. My cOllsin recommended that I\n     contact the Texas Edllcation Agency (\"TEA\") to report the illegal activity.\n\ng. Shortly After, I contacted TEA over the phone in effort to make a report of the illega l\n   activ ity. I informed a representative of TEA that WISD un lawfully removed funds from\n   self-funded programs fo r the purpose of begi nning constl'llctioll of a new 'press box' at\n   the District's footba ll stad ium; that the District withdrew funds from the worker's\n   compensation fund to refu nd the health insurance fund; and that I had prev iously reported\n   this to my supervisors. The representative of T.EA informed me that he would need to\n   obtain physical evidence in order for TEA to initiate 0 formol invesl'igation.\n\n9. Tdo not recall the exact date that J contacted TEA, but I do know that it was before I\n   received my negative performance eval uation and was notified that WISD wus not\n                                                                                                        i\n     renewi ng my cont ract.                                                                            l\n                                                                                                        II\n10. Based on my education and expel'ience, r believed that the TEA wus the appropriate\n    cntity to whom 1 should make my report of the vio lation of law. I a lso fo llowed the\n    recommendation of my cOl1sin who was all emp loyee of the U.S. Attorney General\n    Office.\n\nII . A ll times during my employment, WrSD held the TEA out as the appropriate regu latory\n     enforcement agency related to laws governing the school district\n\n12. Thereafter, r contacted the District's business department in efTort La obtain physical\n    evidence to substantiate his claim. 1 requested and received documentation that 1 believe\n                                                                                                        I,\n    showed that the fimds were bcing used in an unlawful mannel'.                                       ,\n                                                                                                        l\n13. On Pebl1lary 5, 2010, I was ca lled in fbI' n meeting w ith Dr. A lej andl'O, the District's        I\n    Deputy Superintcndent. At the meeting, J received a negative performance evaluation and\n                                                                                                        !\n                                                                                                        !\n    was in rormed thal the D istrict was not going to renew my contract fo r the next year.\n\n\n\n                                              2\n                                                                                                        I\n                                            A-9                                                   256\n\f 14. 1 wns shocked by the evaluation because I had rcccived positive reviews for my entirc\n     employment with WISD. I did not suspect Ihnt I was being retal iated against for my\n     reports to lhe TEA until after 1 consulted with my attorney.\n\n 15. At no time was I l'ccommcnded fol' tC!1nination by WISD, nor was noy action takcn to\n    initiate a termination ormy employment.\n\n16. I continued working through the term of my em ployment cont ract which expired by its\n    own terlll on June 2 1, 2010.\n\n17. On June 17,20 10, I scot a Icttcr to the TEA explaining the mi snppropriation of funds by\n    the District to fo llow up on his prior report in cady 20 1O.\n\n18. On July 20, 2010, Perez initiated his adm inistrativc complaint by sUbmitting    II   Level\n    Employee Complaint Form.\n\n19. On Dccembcr 1,20 10, my lawyer and WISD's counsel attcnded a meeting togcther. I\n    was undcr the imprcssion that the meeting was to be a sett lement discussion, but WISD\n    appat'cntly believed it was go ing to be a Level I Complaint hearing. , did not attend this\n    hearing.\n\n20. On Det:ember 15,20 10, WISD sent my lawyer notice that my Level I Grievance was\n    denied und thnt 1 had ten days to fi le an appcal.\n\n2\\. On March 8, 20 11 , r fi led th is lawsuit seeking damages fo r wrongful termination ami\n    retaliation by WISD against me.\n\n22 .

These transfers may be a violatIon 01 Secllon\n               §11 04(8) and §1106{a) altha Employee Retlroment Income Security Act (see\n               Appendix A and 8).\n\nFinding        The dlstricl's use of surplus funds Irom.the health Insurance lund and workers'\n               camp fund for construction purposes may be unallowable.\n\nInvestlgatlve Through Interviews with district personnel, auditors discovered thaI the district's\nSurnmary      sel!·fundad health Insurance program Is fundGd by a combination of premiums\n              paid by the distnct for employees that choose lis base Insurance ptan as wall as\n              premiums paid by amployees for upgraded plans lor themSelves and their\n              dependents. The workers' compensation Insurance program is funded by the\n              district and Is based on a percentage of each employee's salnry.\n\n              A review of board minutes provided by the district disclosed thai on May 18, 2009,\n              the board of trustees approved a transfer of $1 million from the health insurance\n              fund !o tha worksrs' camp fUnd and a subsequent transfer of $2 million from tho\n              workers' comp fund to the construcllon fund (see Exhibit A. page 12). Board\n              mInutes frorn a meetlng held on AugUSll0, 2009, afso shOw thatlhe funding for\n              the cons\\ruollon of n new press box would be partially funded with workers' comp\n              fund reserves, not the health Insurance fund (see Exhibit B). However, the\n              auditors' review of the district's Lone Star Investment Pool statements revealed               ,\n              thai the dIstrict did not make the firs\\lransler from the health Insurance fund to the\n              workers' camp fund. Jnstcad, $1 million was transferred Irom oach fUnd directly to\n              the construcUon lund on May 29, 2009.

The transfer from the heallh\n              Insurance lund to Ihe constructlcn lund In May 2009 was Intended to wrepay\" that\n              loan. However, the dis\\flct has nol provided the auditors with evidence thai money\n              was Iransferred between the funds In 2006, nor thai such a \"loan\" was approved\n              by the board.\n\n              Subsequent to the auditors' on·site vlsll, the distr!ct staled that the transfer 01\n              monies from the workers' comp fund to the construction fund was allowable under\n              SecUon 504.072 of the Texas Labor Code (see: Appendix C). Although this statute\n              provides a list of disbursements I'l'1al are allowable. it Is silent on the use 01\n              appropriations for construcUon purposes.\n\n              Further, because the district did not provide evidence that a loan existed between\n              the health Insurance fund and the workers' camp fund, It appears Ihatthe district\n              used money contributed by emptoyees to fW'Id the construction 01 the new\n              stadium press box. This may constitute a broach of fiduciary duty by the district.\n\nAnalysis of   After a review 01 documentallon received from the district. auditors concluded that\nResponse      Ihe transfer of lOonies from the workers' compensation fund to tho construction\n              lund was not allowable undQr Secllon 504.072 of the Toxas Labor Code. This\n              statute provides a list of allowable disbursements and the use of appropriations\n              for construction purposes Is nollncluded In the list.

Therefore, the auditors' pOSition related to the Iransler of monies from\n              the worker's compensallon lund to the construction fund remains unchanged.\n\n\nUnallowable uses 01 the Instructional Faclilties Allotment\n\nConcern       The district used leftover monies from ilS Insttuctlonal Facilities AliotmGnt (lFA)\n              funds lor purposes other than instructional facilities.
