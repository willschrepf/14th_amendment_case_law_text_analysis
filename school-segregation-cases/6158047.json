Upon retirement, the executive became entitled to receive benefits from the\nplan, which will be paid from an annuity over the course of his and his wife’s lives.\nThe city of Cleveland sought to tax the present value of those future payments at\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nthe time of the retirement. A Cleveland ordinance, however, exempts “pensions”\nfrom the city income tax. Because we conclude that the SERP constitutes a\npension, we hold that the city income tax does not apply.\n       {¶ 2} In the proceeding below, the Board of Tax Appeals (“BTA”) reached\nthe same conclusion that we do today. Thus, we affirm the BTA’s decision.\n                               I. BACKGROUND\n       {¶ 3} William E. MacDonald III retired from National City Corporation in\n2006, after having worked there for 38 years. As one of the bank’s top executives,\nMacDonald was entitled to participate in National City’s SERP.\n       {¶ 4} Common in the corporate world, a SERP is used to supplement the\nbenefits received by executives under traditional plans, such as qualified defined-\nbenefit or defined-contribution (401(k)) plans. For federal-tax purposes, a SERP is\nconsidered   a   “nonqualified    deferred-compensation      plan.”     26    U.S.C.\n3121(v)(2)(C). The payments are “nonqualified” in the sense that the plan is not\nentitled to receive the favorable tax treatment accorded to qualified plans under the\nInternal Revenue Code.\n       {¶ 5} Because payments from “qualified” plans are limited by federal tax\nlaw, the SERP provides additional benefits in order that covered executives may\nreceive a targeted percentage of their pay upon retirement. A SERP is sometimes\nreferred to as a “top-hat plan” because it is typically limited to a small number of\nhighly compensated employees.\n       {¶ 6} Although considered to be a “nonqualified deferred-compensation”\nplan under federal tax law, MacDonald’s SERP did not involve any deferral of\ncurrent wages owed or the set-aside of any amounts in a segregated account by the\nemployer. Rather, the SERP was an unfunded promise to pay—in other words, a\ngeneral, unsecured obligation on the part of the employer.\n       {¶ 7} MacDonald’s SERP was designed to allow him to receive\napproximately 60 percent of the compensation he had received in his top-earning\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\f                                January Term, 2017\n\n\n\n\nyears, after taking into account Social Security and other retirement benefits. Under\nthe terms of his SERP, MacDonald and his wife, Susan W. MacDonald, began\nreceiving payments in 2007 from a joint-survivorship annuity.\n       {¶ 8} MacDonald was required to pay federal Medicare tax on the present\nvalue of the annuity payments for the 2006 tax year. The present value was\ncalculated to be $9,107,013.16 and was reported in box 5 of MacDonald’s W-2\nform. MacDonald was not required to pay federal income tax on the SERP in 2006;\ninstead, federal income tax will be imposed on payments as they are made over the\nMacDonalds’ retirement years.\n       {¶ 9} National City did not withhold and remit city income tax on the SERP.\nUltimately, the city assessed $182,140.26 in taxes on the SERP, which represented\nthe application of the city’s 2 percent tax on the present value of the annuity\npayments, which had been reported in box 5. The MacDonalds protested the\nassessment, asserting that the SERP was not subject to city tax.\n       {¶ 10} In September 2008, the city’s tax administrator issued an\nadministrative ruling rejecting the MacDonalds’ assertion and upholding the\nassessment. The MacDonalds appealed to the Cleveland Income Tax Board of\nReview (“review board”), which also upheld the assessment. The MacDonalds then\nappealed to the BTA.       The BTA looked to Cleveland Codified Ordinances\n191.0901(d), which excludes pensions from the city income tax. Reasoning that\nthe SERP fell within the “commonly accepted definition of pension,” the BTA\nfound that the SERP was not subject to the tax and reversed the review board’s\ndecision. The review board and Cleveland’s tax administrator, Nassim M. Lynch,\nhave appealed to this court. Lynch, through the Central Collection Agency,\nadministers the income-tax laws of the city. For convenience, we will refer to\nappellants collectively as “Cleveland” or “the city.”\n       {¶ 11} The proceeding below was actually the second time the BTA had\nconsidered the taxability of the MacDonalds’ SERP. The city of Shaker Heights\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nhad also sought to impose its income tax on the SERP. The BTA determined that\nthe SERP was not taxable under the Shaker Heights code, and the Tenth District\nCourt of Appeals affirmed that decision. See MacDonald v. Shaker Hts. Income\nTax Bd. of Rev., 10th Dist. Franklin No. 13AP-71, 2014-Ohio-708. We accepted a\ndiscretionary appeal from the court of appeals’ decision as to the scope of the\nBTA’s review but declined jurisdiction over the substantive issue of the taxability\nof the SERP. MacDonald v. Shaker Hts. Income Tax Bd. of Rev., 144 Ohio St.3d\n105, 2015-Ohio-3290, 41 N.E.3d 376, ¶ 4. In this appeal, we squarely confront the\ntaxability of the SERP under the ordinances and regulations of the city of\nCleveland.\n                                  II. ANALYSIS\n       {¶ 12} We review the decision of the BTA to determine whether it is\nreasonable and lawful. R.C. 5717.04. In doing so, we review de novo the BTA’s\nconstruction of Cleveland’s ordinances and regulations. See Gesler v. Worthington\nIncome Tax Bd. of Appeals, 138 Ohio St.3d 76, 2013-Ohio-4986, 3 N.E.3d 1177,\n¶ 10. We find nothing unreasonable or unlawful about the BTA’s decision.\n                           A. The SERP Is a Pension\n       {¶ 13} The MacDonalds’ argument for affirmance is straightforward. They\nrely upon Cleveland Codified Ordinances 191.0901(d)’s exclusion of pension\nbenefits:\n\n\n               The tax provided for in this chapter shall not be levied on the\n       following: * * * [p]roceeds of insurance paid by reason of the death\n       of the insured; pensions, disability benefits, annuities, or gratuities\n       not in the nature of compensation for services rendered from\n       whatever source derived.\n\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f                                January Term, 2017\n\n\n\n\n(Emphasis added.) We will call this provision the “pension exclusion.”           The\nMacDonalds maintain that the SERP is a pension and that therefore it is excluded\nfrom taxable income.\n       {¶ 14} Cleveland counters that the pension exclusion does not apply to the\nSERP for four reasons: (1) the SERP is compensation for services rendered, (2) the\nSERP does not qualify as a pension under the tax administrator’s Rules and\nRegulations, (3) the SERP is taxable as a nonqualified deferred-compensation plan\nunder Cleveland ordinances, and (4) the SERP is taxable as a matter of state law.\n       {¶ 15} We address each of the city’s arguments in turn.\n           1. Cleveland’s compensation-for-services-rendered argument\n       {¶ 16} We start our analysis with the pension exclusion. Cleveland’s\nincome-tax ordinances unambiguously exclude “pensions” from the city income\ntax. Black’s Law Dictionary provides the following definition of “pension”: “[a]\nfixed sum paid regularly to a person (or to the person’s beneficiaries), esp. by an\nemployer as a retirement benefit.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1315 (10th Ed.2014).\nWebster’s Third New International Dictionary includes the following definition: “a\nfixed sum paid regularly to a person * * *: one paid under given conditions to a\nperson following his retirement from service (as due to age or disability) or to the\nsurviving dependents of a person entitled to such a pension.” Webster’s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 1671 (2002). Under either definition, the SERP plainly is\na pension. It is a sum of money regularly paid to the MacDonalds as a retirement\nbenefit. An ordinary speaker of the English language would have little difficulty\nin concluding that what the MacDonalds received from National City was a\npension.\n       {¶ 17} Such an understanding of the term is reinforced when the pension\nexclusion is read as a whole. The language of the ordinance has broad reach,\nevincing an intent to reach a multitude of retirement, death, and disability payments.\nThe exclusion is phrased to encompass all those amounts that are themselves “not\n\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nin the nature of compensation for services rendered” but instead substitute for such\ncompensation upon death, disability, or retirement. Cleveland Codified Ordinances\n191.0901(d).\n       {¶ 18} Cleveland characterizes the SERP as compensation for services\nrendered and thus suggests that the exclusion does not apply. What Cleveland\napparently means is that because MacDonald received the SERP by virtue of his\nhaving been employed by National City, the SERP retirement benefit is “in the\nnature of compensation for services rendered.” But this argument stretches the\nmeaning of the phrase much too far. Virtually any pension—including a traditional\nqualified defined-benefit plan, which Cleveland admittedly does not tax—comes\nabout as a result of someone having performed services for an employer. Plainly,\nif the pension exclusion is to have any application at all, the phrase “in the nature\nof compensation for services rendered” must have a more limited scope than\nCleveland would give it.\n       {¶ 19} By its terms, the purpose of McDonald’s SERP was to “provide for\nthe payment of certain pension, disability, and survivor benefits in addition to\nbenefits which may be payable under other plans of the Corporation.” Thus, under\nthe plain language of the pension exclusion in the Cleveland income-tax ordinance,\nthe SERP is exempt from taxation.\n                   2. Cleveland’s regulation-based argument\n       {¶ 20} Cleveland argues that the definition of “pension” is limited by the\ntax administrator’s Rules and Regulations in effect in 2006:\n\n\n               2:30 Pensions means distributions from retirement plans as\n       reported on Federal Form 1099R, or its equivalent or successor\n       form, in the year paid, and which are designed to provide primarily\n       for the retirement income of employees. Pension distributions are\n       not taxable; contributions to pension plans, retirement plans,\n\n\n\n\n                                         6\n\f                               January Term, 2017\n\n\n\n\n       deferred compensation plans, as well as any other type of deferred\n       compensation arrangement or income deferral arrangement or plan,\n       are taxable in the year the income is earned and deferred.\n               ***\n               6:03 Insurance and Annuity Proceeds, Certain Employee\n       Benefits and Gifts.\n               (A) The following additional items are specifically\n       exempted from the tax imposed by this ordinance:\n               ***\n               2. Distributions from pension plans reported to the payee on\n       Federal Form 1099-R or substantive equivalent.\n               ***\n               (B)   The following items are not exempt from the tax\n       imposed by the ordinance (this is not an exhaustive list):\n               ***\n               2. Deferred compensation of any kind, whether deferred\n       under a retirement plan or under any other type of compensation\n       arrangement or contract, including any qualified or nonqualified\n       deferrals made by an employer or the employee or both.\n\n\nAs a nonqualified deferred-compensation plan, the SERP was not reported on Form\n1099-R. Internal Revenue Service, Instructions for Forms 1099-R and 5498,\nhttps://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1099r.pdf (accessed Aug. 23, 2017).          Thus,\nCleveland argues, it does not qualify as a pension.\n       {¶ 21} The problem with Cleveland’s argument is that it requires that we\nhold that the tax administrator had the power to adopt rules that supersede an\nordinance passed by city council.        Under Cleveland Codified Ordinances\n191.2303(a), the tax administrator may (with the approval of the review board)\n\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nadopt and enforce “rules and regulations relating to any matter or thing pertaining\nto the collection of taxes and the administration and enforcement of the provisions\nof this chapter, including provisions for the re-examination and correction of\nreturns.” This section, however, does not provide the administrator with the power\nto change the terms of ordinances. The limiting definition of “pension” adopted by\nthe tax administrator goes beyond the “collection of taxes” and the “administration\nand enforcement” of Cleveland Codified Ordinances Chapter 191 and works a\nsubstantive change regarding what is taxable.\n       {¶ 22} At oral argument, Cleveland’s counsel asserted that the Rules and\nRegulations had been first promulgated by the tax administrator and then adopted\nand incorporated into the city ordinance. It is true that in 2004—with the applicable\nregulations already in place—city council amended its ordinance, adding a\nreference to the Rules and Regulations in the definition of “taxable income”:\n“ ‘Taxable income’ means all qualifying wages, net profits and all other income\nfrom whatever source derived set forth in Section 191.0501, and the Rules and\nRegulations as taxable.” (Emphasis added.)         Cleveland Codified Ordinances\n191.0318. But as counsel conceded, city council did not vote to ratify the specific\nRules and Regulations promulgated by the tax administrator. And we are not\nconvinced that mere reference to the Rules and Regulations is sufficient to allow\nthe tax administrator to make taxable what an ordinance specifically says is not\ntaxable.\n       {¶ 23} We were confronted with a somewhat similar situation in Nestle\nR&D Ctr., Inc. v. Levin, 122 Ohio St.3d 22, 2009-Ohio-1929, 907 N.E.2d 714.\nThere, an administrative rule authorized the director of the Department of\nDevelopment to “adopt rules necessary to implement” a tax credit for the creation\nof new jobs. The issue before us concerned the proper reading of a statute, R.C.\n5733.12(B), which provided the limitation period for filing for a tax refund for\ncreating new jobs.     We held that while the statutory authorization for rule\n\n\n\n\n                                         8\n\f                               January Term, 2017\n\n\n\n\npromulgation “surely confers authority on the Department of Development to\nestablish reasonable deadlines for submitting documentation, we do not read that\nprovision as authorizing the Director of Development to provide the definitive\nconstruction of R.C. 5733.12(B).” Id. at ¶ 40. Similarly, we do not read either\nCleveland Codified Ordinances 191.2303 or 191.0318 as authorizing the tax\nadministrator to make a definitive determination as to what is taxable.\n       {¶ 24} A rulemaker possesses only the authority granted it by a legislative\nbody; an administrative rule that conflicts with a municipal ordinance is invalid.\nSee Hoover Universal, Inc. v. Limbach, 61 Ohio St.3d 563, 569, 575 N.E.2d 811\n(1991); Athens Home Tel. Co. v. Peck, 158 Ohio St. 557, 562, 110 N.E.2d 571\n(1953). In United States v. Calamaro, 354 U.S. 351, 358-359, 77 S.Ct. 1138, 1\nL.Ed.2d 1394 (1957), the court declined to defer to a treasury-department\nregulation in construing who was covered by a tax imposed by the Internal Revenue\nCode. The regulation, which expanded the universe of who was covered by the tax,\nwas “no more than an attempted addition to the statute of something which [was]\nnot there.” Id. at 359. The same goes here: the Rules and Regulations attempt to\nexpand the tax by adding to the ordinance “something which is not there”—in this\ncase, a requirement that only those pensions reported on federal Form 1099-R are\nsubject to the exclusion.\n       {¶ 25} Contrary to the city’s claim, our decision in Hillenmeyer v.\nCleveland Bd. of Rev., 144 Ohio St.3d 165, 2015-Ohio-1623, 41 N.E.3d 1164, does\nnot compel a different result. In that case, we held that the tax administrator’s\nrulemaking authority extended to spelling out a formula for applying the city’s\nincome tax to nonresidents who performed a portion of their work in the city. Id.\nat ¶ 20. But in Hillenmeyer, the ordinance was silent about the manner in which\ntaxes should be levied against nonresidents. Here, in contrast, the ordinance\nspecifically provides that anything that is a pension is beyond the scope of the\n\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nincome tax. The tax administrator’s rulemaking authority does not allow him to\ndictate otherwise.\n                     3. Cleveland’s ordinance-based argument\n       {¶ 26} Cleveland’s further attempt to avoid the pension exclusion rests on\nthe definition of “qualifying wages” in Cleveland’s Codified Ordinances. For tax\nyear 2006, Cleveland imposed taxes on “all qualifying wages, earned and/or\nreceived * * * by nonresidents of the City for work done or services performed or\nrendered within the City or attributable to the City.”            Cleveland Codified\nOrdinances 191.0501(b)(1). The ordinance defined “qualifying wages” to include\n“compensation attributable to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan or\nprogram as defined in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.”\nCleveland Codified Ordinances 191.031501. The SERP is a nonqualified deferred-\ncompensation plan for purposes of 26 U.S.C. 3121(v)(2)(C). Thus, Cleveland\nargues, the ordinance makes the present value of the SERP immediately taxable.\n       {¶ 27} The two Cleveland income-tax ordinances are at odds. One—\nCleveland Codified Ordinances 191.031501—would seem to make the SERP\ntaxable because it falls within the definition of “qualifying wages.” The other\nordinance—Cleveland Codified Ordinances 191.0901(d) (the pension exclusion)—\nsays that the SERP is not taxable. In reconciling this conflict, we turn to the familiar\nrule of statutory construction that when there is a conflict between a general\nprovision and a more specific provision in a statute, the specific provision controls.\nScalia & Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 183 (2012). See\nR.C. 1.51. The canon rests on the rationale that “ ‘[t]he particular provision is\nestablished upon a nearer and more exact view of the subject than the general, of\nwhich it may be regarded as a correction.’ ” Scalia & Garner, Reading Law at 183,\nquoting Jeremy Bentham, A Complete Code of Laws, in 3 The Works of Jeremy\nBentham 210 (John Bowring Ed.1843). Here, the more general definition of\n\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\f                               January Term, 2017\n\n\n\n\n“qualifying wages” is limited by the specific provision, which excludes pensions\nfrom the broad definition.\n       {¶ 28} Adoption of Cleveland’s interpretation of the ordinances would have\nthe effect of making the pension exclusion largely, if not completely, superfluous.\nQuite simply, the definition of “qualifying wages” in the ordinance refers to the\ndefinition of “wages” in 26 U.S.C. 3121 that is used for the so-called payroll or\nFICA taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare benefits. That definition\nbroadly includes “all remuneration for employment” for purposes of the FICA tax\nbase, subject to the exclusion of items prescribed in 26 U.S.C. 3121(a)(1) through\n(a)(23). These exclusions include the benefits a retiree receives from a qualified\npension plan, 26 U.SC. 3121(a)(5)(A), as well as an employer’s payments made\n“on account of sickness or accident disability,” 26 U.S.C. 3121(a)(4). These same\nbenefits are excluded by the pension exclusion. If, as Cleveland argues, 26 U.S.C.\n3121’s definition of “wages” is fully controlling, there would be no need for the\nseparate pension exclusion.\n       {¶ 29} The city counters that the BTA’s decision finding the SERP\nnontaxable “renders meaningless” the income-tax-ordinance provisions levying the\ncity tax on nonqualified deferred compensation.          See Cleveland Codified\nOrdinances 191.0501(b)(1) and 191.031501. But this is not the case. In fact, the\nrecord shows that National City offered its executives the opportunity to defer a\nportion of their wages or bonuses to be paid later, and this deferred compensation\nwould be “nonqualified deferred compensation” subject to the city’s taxation. Such\na deferred amount would be included as “qualifying wages” because it is\n“compensation attributable to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan or\nprogram” under Cleveland Codified Ordinances 191.031501. And because it is\nclearly not a pension, it would not be excluded under Cleveland Codified Ordinance\n191.0901(d). Thus, the deferred amount would be taxable.\n\n\n\n\n                                        11\n\f                                SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n        {¶ 30} We conclude that the definition of “qualifying wages” in Cleveland\nCodified Ordinances 191.031501 does not override the exclusion of the SERP from\nthe city income tax as a pension in Cleveland Codified Ordinances 191.0901(d).\n                         4. Cleveland’s state-law argument\n        {¶ 31} Cleveland also argues that because the city had elected to tax on a\nqualifying-wages basis under former R.C. Chapter 718, it was required by state law\nto impose its income tax on the SERP. Under former R.C. Chapter 718, “qualifying\nwages” were defined as those wages included in 26 U.S.C. 3121(a), subject to\ncertain adjustments. See former R.C. 718.03(A), Am.Sub.H.B. No. 95, 150 Ohio\nLaws, Part I, 396, 638.1 The chapter excluded from “qualifying wages”\n\n\n        any amount attributable to a nonqualified deferred compensation\n        plan or program described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal\n        Revenue Code if the compensation is included in wages and has, by\n        resolution or ordinance, been exempted from taxation by the\n        municipal corporation.\n\n\nFormer R.C. 718.03(A)(2)(c), 150 Ohio Laws, Part I, at 639.\n        {¶ 32} As Cleveland reads the statute, because the city taxes on a\nqualifying-wages basis, it is required to tax “amount[s] attributable to a\nnonqualified deferred compensation plan” unless it specifically excludes those\namounts by ordinance. But the city has excluded these amounts by ordinance—the\npension exclusion exempts the SERP at issue from taxation. Further, even if the\npension exclusion somehow did not satisfy the requirement of the state statute, our\ndecision in Gesler, 138 Ohio St.3d 76, 2013-Ohio-4986, 3 N.E.3d 1177, would\nprevent the imposition of the tax. There, we held that although the General\n\n1\n R.C. Chapter 718 was comprehensively rewritten in 2014. 2014 Sub.H.B. No. 5 (effective Mar.\n23, 2015). We rely on the version of the law that was in force in 2006.\n\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\f                                January Term, 2017\n\n\n\n\nAssembly can restrict a city’s power to tax, it “cannot command [a city] to impose\na tax [on specific income] when [the city] has chosen not to tax that income.” Id.\nat 21-22.\n               B. Cleveland’s Additional Arguments Lack Merit\n       {¶ 33} Cleveland raises a number of other arguments that we can dispose of\nquickly. It challenges certain procedural aspects of the BTA proceeding, arguing\ngenerally that the BTA failed to afford appropriate deference to the decision of the\nreview board. But in MacDonald v. Shaker Hts. Income Tax Bd. of Rev., 144 Ohio\nSt.3d 105, 2015-Ohio-3290, 41 N.E.3d 376, we specifically held that the BTA has\nauthority to review municipal-tax-board decisions de novo as to both facts and law.\nId. at ¶ 23. We also conclude that the BTA did not abuse its discretion in allowing\nPatricia Emond to testify regarding background information about the SERP or in\nconsidering the testimony she gave in the Shaker Heights case. See Orange City\nSchool Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, 74 Ohio St.3d 415, 416-\n417, 659 N.E.2d 1223 (1996). Further, we are not persuaded that the BTA restricted\nCleveland’s home-rule authority under Ohio Constitution, Article XVIII, Section\n3, when it applied Cleveland’s ordinances to determine whether the SERP was a\npension. In short, we find no error in the review undertaken by the BTA here.\n       {¶ 34} Finally, Cleveland contends that the MacDonalds are estopped from\ncontesting the tax assessment because in 1997 their counsel in this case signed a\nsettlement letter on behalf of National City and other corporate clients that allegedly\nacknowledges that a SERP like the one at issue here is subject to city taxation.\nThere is some dispute as to what type of retirement benefits that agreement covered;\nbut regardless, the MacDonalds cannot be estopped by an agreement to which they\nwere not a party.\n                                III. CONCLUSION\n       {¶ 35} For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the BTA correctly\nreversed the review board’s decision.\n\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n                                                            Decision affirmed.\n       O’CONNOR, C.J., and O’DONNELL, KENNEDY, FRENCH, O’NEILL, and\nFISCHER, JJ., concur.\n                               _________________\n       Baker & Hostetler, L.L.P., Christopher J.

Upon retirement, the executive became entitled to receive benefits from the\nplan, which will be paid from an annuity over the course of his and his wife’s lives.\nThe city of Cleveland sought to tax the present value of those future payments at\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nthe time of the retirement. A Cleveland ordinance, however, exempts “pensions”\nfrom the city income tax. Because we conclude that the SERP constitutes a\npension, we hold that the city income tax does not apply.\n       {¶ 2} In the proceeding below, the Board of Tax Appeals (“BTA”) reached\nthe same conclusion that we do today. Thus, we affirm the BTA’s decision.\n                               I. BACKGROUND\n       {¶ 3} William E. MacDonald III retired from National City Corporation in\n2006, after having worked there for 38 years. As one of the bank’s top executives,\nMacDonald was entitled to participate in National City’s SERP.\n       {¶ 4} Common in the corporate world, a SERP is used to supplement the\nbenefits received by executives under traditional plans, such as qualified defined-\nbenefit or defined-contribution (401(k)) plans. For federal-tax purposes, a SERP is\nconsidered   a   “nonqualified    deferred-compensation      plan.”     26    U.S.C.\n3121(v)(2)(C). The payments are “nonqualified” in the sense that the plan is not\nentitled to receive the favorable tax treatment accorded to qualified plans under the\nInternal Revenue Code.\n       {¶ 5} Because payments from “qualified” plans are limited by federal tax\nlaw, the SERP provides additional benefits in order that covered executives may\nreceive a targeted percentage of their pay upon retirement. A SERP is sometimes\nreferred to as a “top-hat plan” because it is typically limited to a small number of\nhighly compensated employees.\n       {¶ 6} Although considered to be a “nonqualified deferred-compensation”\nplan under federal tax law, MacDonald’s SERP did not involve any deferral of\ncurrent wages owed or the set-aside of any amounts in a segregated account by the\nemployer. Rather, the SERP was an unfunded promise to pay—in other words, a\ngeneral, unsecured obligation on the part of the employer.\n       {¶ 7} MacDonald’s SERP was designed to allow him to receive\napproximately 60 percent of the compensation he had received in his top-earning\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\f                                January Term, 2017\n\n\n\n\nyears, after taking into account Social Security and other retirement benefits. Under\nthe terms of his SERP, MacDonald and his wife, Susan W. MacDonald, began\nreceiving payments in 2007 from a joint-survivorship annuity.\n       {¶ 8} MacDonald was required to pay federal Medicare tax on the present\nvalue of the annuity payments for the 2006 tax year. The present value was\ncalculated to be $9,107,013.16 and was reported in box 5 of MacDonald’s W-2\nform. MacDonald was not required to pay federal income tax on the SERP in 2006;\ninstead, federal income tax will be imposed on payments as they are made over the\nMacDonalds’ retirement years.\n       {¶ 9} National City did not withhold and remit city income tax on the SERP.\nUltimately, the city assessed $182,140.26 in taxes on the SERP, which represented\nthe application of the city’s 2 percent tax on the present value of the annuity\npayments, which had been reported in box 5. The MacDonalds protested the\nassessment, asserting that the SERP was not subject to city tax.\n       {¶ 10} In September 2008, the city’s tax administrator issued an\nadministrative ruling rejecting the MacDonalds’ assertion and upholding the\nassessment. The MacDonalds appealed to the Cleveland Income Tax Board of\nReview (“review board”), which also upheld the assessment. The MacDonalds then\nappealed to the BTA.       The BTA looked to Cleveland Codified Ordinances\n191.0901(d), which excludes pensions from the city income tax. Reasoning that\nthe SERP fell within the “commonly accepted definition of pension,” the BTA\nfound that the SERP was not subject to the tax and reversed the review board’s\ndecision. The review board and Cleveland’s tax administrator, Nassim M. Lynch,\nhave appealed to this court. Lynch, through the Central Collection Agency,\nadministers the income-tax laws of the city. For convenience, we will refer to\nappellants collectively as “Cleveland” or “the city.”\n       {¶ 11} The proceeding below was actually the second time the BTA had\nconsidered the taxability of the MacDonalds’ SERP. The city of Shaker Heights\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nhad also sought to impose its income tax on the SERP. The BTA determined that\nthe SERP was not taxable under the Shaker Heights code, and the Tenth District\nCourt of Appeals affirmed that decision. See MacDonald v. Shaker Hts. Income\nTax Bd. of Rev., 10th Dist. Franklin No. 13AP-71, 2014-Ohio-708. We accepted a\ndiscretionary appeal from the court of appeals’ decision as to the scope of the\nBTA’s review but declined jurisdiction over the substantive issue of the taxability\nof the SERP. MacDonald v. Shaker Hts. Income Tax Bd. of Rev., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">105</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2015-Ohio-3290, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">376</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 4. In this appeal, we squarely confront the\ntaxability of the SERP under the ordinances and regulations of the city of\nCleveland.\n                                  II. ANALYSIS\n       {¶ 12} We review the decision of the BTA to determine whether it is\nreasonable and lawful. R.C. 5717.04. In doing so, we review de novo the BTA’s\nconstruction of Cleveland’s ordinances and regulations. See Gesler v. Worthington\nIncome Tax Bd. of Appeals, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2013-Ohio-4986, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1177</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n¶ 10. We find nothing unreasonable or unlawful about the BTA’s decision.\n                           A. The SERP Is a Pension\n       {¶ 13} The MacDonalds’ argument for affirmance is straightforward. They\nrely upon Cleveland Codified Ordinances 191.0901(d)’s exclusion of pension\nbenefits:\n\n\n               The tax provided for in this chapter shall not be levied on the\n       following: * * * [p]roceeds of insurance paid by reason of the death\n       of the insured; pensions, disability benefits, annuities, or gratuities\n       not in the nature of compensation for services rendered from\n       whatever source derived.\n\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f                                January Term, 2017\n\n\n\n\n(Emphasis added.) We will call this provision the “pension exclusion.”           The\nMacDonalds maintain that the SERP is a pension and that therefore it is excluded\nfrom taxable income.\n       {¶ 14} Cleveland counters that the pension exclusion does not apply to the\nSERP for four reasons: (1) the SERP is compensation for services rendered, (2) the\nSERP does not qualify as a pension under the tax administrator’s Rules and\nRegulations, (3) the SERP is taxable as a nonqualified deferred-compensation plan\nunder Cleveland ordinances, and (4) the SERP is taxable as a matter of state law.\n       {¶ 15} We address each of the city’s arguments in turn.\n           1. Cleveland’s compensation-for-services-rendered argument\n       {¶ 16} We start our analysis with the pension exclusion. Cleveland’s\nincome-tax ordinances unambiguously exclude “pensions” from the city income\ntax. Black’s Law Dictionary provides the following definition of “pension”: “[a]\nfixed sum paid regularly to a person (or to the person’s beneficiaries), esp. by an\nemployer as a retirement benefit.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1315 (10th Ed.2014).\nWebster’s Third New International Dictionary includes the following definition: “a\nfixed sum paid regularly to a person * * *: one paid under given conditions to a\nperson following his retirement from service (as due to age or disability) or to the\nsurviving dependents of a person entitled to such a pension.” Webster’s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 1671 (2002). Under either definition, the SERP plainly is\na pension. It is a sum of money regularly paid to the MacDonalds as a retirement\nbenefit. An ordinary speaker of the English language would have little difficulty\nin concluding that what the MacDonalds received from National City was a\npension.\n       {¶ 17} Such an understanding of the term is reinforced when the pension\nexclusion is read as a whole. The language of the ordinance has broad reach,\nevincing an intent to reach a multitude of retirement, death, and disability payments.\nThe exclusion is phrased to encompass all those amounts that are themselves “not\n\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nin the nature of compensation for services rendered” but instead substitute for such\ncompensation upon death, disability, or retirement. Cleveland Codified Ordinances\n191.0901(d).\n       {¶ 18} Cleveland characterizes the SERP as compensation for services\nrendered and thus suggests that the exclusion does not apply. What Cleveland\napparently means is that because MacDonald received the SERP by virtue of his\nhaving been employed by National City, the SERP retirement benefit is “in the\nnature of compensation for services rendered.” But this argument stretches the\nmeaning of the phrase much too far. Virtually any pension—including a traditional\nqualified defined-benefit plan, which Cleveland admittedly does not tax—comes\nabout as a result of someone having performed services for an employer. Plainly,\nif the pension exclusion is to have any application at all, the phrase “in the nature\nof compensation for services rendered” must have a more limited scope than\nCleveland would give it.\n       {¶ 19} By its terms, the purpose of McDonald’s SERP was to “provide for\nthe payment of certain pension, disability, and survivor benefits in addition to\nbenefits which may be payable under other plans of the Corporation.” Thus, under\nthe plain language of the pension exclusion in the Cleveland income-tax ordinance,\nthe SERP is exempt from taxation.\n                   2. Cleveland’s regulation-based argument\n       {¶ 20} Cleveland argues that the definition of “pension” is limited by the\ntax administrator’s Rules and Regulations in effect in 2006:\n\n\n               2:30 Pensions means distributions from retirement plans as\n       reported on Federal Form 1099R, or its equivalent or successor\n       form, in the year paid, and which are designed to provide primarily\n       for the retirement income of employees. Pension distributions are\n       not taxable; contributions to pension plans, retirement plans,\n\n\n\n\n                                         6\n\f                               January Term, 2017\n\n\n\n\n       deferred compensation plans, as well as any other type of deferred\n       compensation arrangement or income deferral arrangement or plan,\n       are taxable in the year the income is earned and deferred.\n               ***\n               6:03 Insurance and Annuity Proceeds, Certain Employee\n       Benefits and Gifts.\n               (A) The following additional items are specifically\n       exempted from the tax imposed by this ordinance:\n               ***\n               2. Distributions from pension plans reported to the payee on\n       Federal Form 1099-R or substantive equivalent.\n               ***\n               (B)   The following items are not exempt from the tax\n       imposed by the ordinance (this is not an exhaustive list):\n               ***\n               2. Deferred compensation of any kind, whether deferred\n       under a retirement plan or under any other type of compensation\n       arrangement or contract, including any qualified or nonqualified\n       deferrals made by an employer or the employee or both.\n\n\nAs a nonqualified deferred-compensation plan, the SERP was not reported on Form\n1099-R. Internal Revenue Service, Instructions for Forms 1099-R and 5498,\nhttps://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1099r.pdf (accessed Aug. 23, 2017).          Thus,\nCleveland argues, it does not qualify as a pension.\n       {¶ 21} The problem with Cleveland’s argument is that it requires that we\nhold that the tax administrator had the power to adopt rules that supersede an\nordinance passed by city council.        Under Cleveland Codified Ordinances\n191.2303(a), the tax administrator may (with the approval of the review board)\n\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nadopt and enforce “rules and regulations relating to any matter or thing pertaining\nto the collection of taxes and the administration and enforcement of the provisions\nof this chapter, including provisions for the re-examination and correction of\nreturns.” This section, however, does not provide the administrator with the power\nto change the terms of ordinances. The limiting definition of “pension” adopted by\nthe tax administrator goes beyond the “collection of taxes” and the “administration\nand enforcement” of Cleveland Codified Ordinances Chapter 191 and works a\nsubstantive change regarding what is taxable.\n       {¶ 22} At oral argument, Cleveland’s counsel asserted that the Rules and\nRegulations had been first promulgated by the tax administrator and then adopted\nand incorporated into the city ordinance. It is true that in 2004—with the applicable\nregulations already in place—city council amended its ordinance, adding a\nreference to the Rules and Regulations in the definition of “taxable income”:\n“ ‘Taxable income’ means all qualifying wages, net profits and all other income\nfrom whatever source derived set forth in Section 191.0501, and the Rules and\nRegulations as taxable.” (Emphasis added.)         Cleveland Codified Ordinances\n191.0318. But as counsel conceded, city council did not vote to ratify the specific\nRules and Regulations promulgated by the tax administrator. And we are not\nconvinced that mere reference to the Rules and Regulations is sufficient to allow\nthe tax administrator to make taxable what an ordinance specifically says is not\ntaxable.\n       {¶ 23} We were confronted with a somewhat similar situation in Nestle\nR&D Ctr., Inc. v. Levin, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2009-Ohio-1929, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">714</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\nThere, an administrative rule authorized the director of the Department of\nDevelopment to “adopt rules necessary to implement” a tax credit for the creation\nof new jobs.

Similarly, we do not read either\nCleveland Codified Ordinances 191.2303 or 191.0318 as authorizing the tax\nadministrator to make a definitive determination as to what is taxable.\n       {¶ 24} A rulemaker possesses only the authority granted it by a legislative\nbody; an administrative rule that conflicts with a municipal ordinance is invalid.\nSee Hoover Universal, Inc. v.

The regulation, which expanded the universe of who was covered by the tax,\nwas “no more than an attempted addition to the statute of something which [was]\nnot there.” Id. at 359. The same goes here: the Rules and Regulations attempt to\nexpand the tax by adding to the ordinance “something which is not there”—in this\ncase, a requirement that only those pensions reported on federal Form 1099-R are\nsubject to the exclusion.\n       {¶ 25} Contrary to the city’s claim, our decision in Hillenmeyer v.\nCleveland Bd. of Rev., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2015-Ohio-1623, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1164</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, does\nnot compel a different result. In that case, we held that the tax administrator’s\nrulemaking authority extended to spelling out a formula for applying the city’s\nincome tax to nonresidents who performed a portion of their work in the city. Id.\nat ¶ 20. But in Hillenmeyer, the ordinance was silent about the manner in which\ntaxes should be levied against nonresidents. Here, in contrast, the ordinance\nspecifically provides that anything that is a pension is beyond the scope of the\n\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nincome tax. The tax administrator’s rulemaking authority does not allow him to\ndictate otherwise.\n                     3. Cleveland’s ordinance-based argument\n       {¶ 26} Cleveland’s further attempt to avoid the pension exclusion rests on\nthe definition of “qualifying wages” in Cleveland’s Codified Ordinances. For tax\nyear 2006, Cleveland imposed taxes on “all qualifying wages, earned and/or\nreceived * * * by nonresidents of the City for work done or services performed or\nrendered within the City or attributable to the City.”            Cleveland Codified\nOrdinances 191.0501(b)(1). The ordinance defined “qualifying wages” to include\n“compensation attributable to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan or\nprogram as defined in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.”\nCleveland Codified Ordinances 191.031501. The SERP is a nonqualified deferred-\ncompensation plan for purposes of 26 U.S.C. 3121(v)(2)(C). Thus, Cleveland\nargues, the ordinance makes the present value of the SERP immediately taxable.\n       {¶ 27} The two Cleveland income-tax ordinances are at odds. One—\nCleveland Codified Ordinances 191.031501—would seem to make the SERP\ntaxable because it falls within the definition of “qualifying wages.” The other\nordinance—Cleveland Codified Ordinances 191.0901(d) (the pension exclusion)—\nsays that the SERP is not taxable. In reconciling this conflict, we turn to the familiar\nrule of statutory construction that when there is a conflict between a general\nprovision and a more specific provision in a statute, the specific provision controls.\nScalia & Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 183 (2012). See\nR.C. 1.51. The canon rests on the rationale that “ ‘[t]he particular provision is\nestablished upon a nearer and more exact view of the subject than the general, of\nwhich it may be regarded as a correction.’ ” Scalia & Garner, Reading Law at 183,\nquoting Jeremy Bentham, A Complete Code of Laws, in 3 The Works of Jeremy\nBentham 210 (John Bowring Ed.1843). Here, the more general definition of\n\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\f                               January Term, 2017\n\n\n\n\n“qualifying wages” is limited by the specific provision, which excludes pensions\nfrom the broad definition.\n       {¶ 28} Adoption of Cleveland’s interpretation of the ordinances would have\nthe effect of making the pension exclusion largely, if not completely, superfluous.\nQuite simply, the definition of “qualifying wages” in the ordinance refers to the\ndefinition of “wages” in 26 U.S.C. 3121 that is used for the so-called payroll or\nFICA taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare benefits. That definition\nbroadly includes “all remuneration for employment” for purposes of the FICA tax\nbase, subject to the exclusion of items prescribed in 26 U.S.C. 3121(a)(1) through\n(a)(23). These exclusions include the benefits a retiree receives from a qualified\npension plan, 26 U.SC. 3121(a)(5)(A), as well as an employer’s payments made\n“on account of sickness or accident disability,” 26 U.S.C. 3121(a)(4). These same\nbenefits are excluded by the pension exclusion. If, as Cleveland argues, 26 U.S.C.\n3121’s definition of “wages” is fully controlling, there would be no need for the\nseparate pension exclusion.\n       {¶ 29} The city counters that the BTA’s decision finding the SERP\nnontaxable “renders meaningless” the income-tax-ordinance provisions levying the\ncity tax on nonqualified deferred compensation.          See Cleveland Codified\nOrdinances 191.0501(b)(1) and 191.031501. But this is not the case. In fact, the\nrecord shows that National City offered its executives the opportunity to defer a\nportion of their wages or bonuses to be paid later, and this deferred compensation\nwould be “nonqualified deferred compensation” subject to the city’s taxation. Such\na deferred amount would be included as “qualifying wages” because it is\n“compensation attributable to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan or\nprogram” under Cleveland Codified Ordinances 191.031501. And because it is\nclearly not a pension, it would not be excluded under Cleveland Codified Ordinance\n191.0901(d). Thus, the deferred amount would be taxable.\n\n\n\n\n                                        11\n\f                                SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n        {¶ 30} We conclude that the definition of “qualifying wages” in Cleveland\nCodified Ordinances 191.031501 does not override the exclusion of the SERP from\nthe city income tax as a pension in Cleveland Codified Ordinances 191.0901(d).\n                         4. Cleveland’s state-law argument\n        {¶ 31} Cleveland also argues that because the city had elected to tax on a\nqualifying-wages basis under former R.C. Chapter 718, it was required by state law\nto impose its income tax on the SERP. Under former R.C. Chapter 718, “qualifying\nwages” were defined as those wages included in 26 U.S.C. 3121(a), subject to\ncertain adjustments. See former R.C. 718.03(A), Am.Sub.H.B. No. 95, 150 Ohio\nLaws, Part I, 396, 638.1 The chapter excluded from “qualifying wages”\n\n\n        any amount attributable to a nonqualified deferred compensation\n        plan or program described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal\n        Revenue Code if the compensation is included in wages and has, by\n        resolution or ordinance, been exempted from taxation by the\n        municipal corporation.\n\n\nFormer R.C. 718.03(A)(2)(c), 150 Ohio Laws, Part I, at 639.\n        {¶ 32} As Cleveland reads the statute, because the city taxes on a\nqualifying-wages basis, it is required to tax “amount[s] attributable to a\nnonqualified deferred compensation plan” unless it specifically excludes those\namounts by ordinance. But the city has excluded these amounts by ordinance—the\npension exclusion exempts the SERP at issue from taxation. Further, even if the\npension exclusion somehow did not satisfy the requirement of the state statute, our\ndecision in Gesler, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2013-Ohio-4986, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1177</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, would\nprevent the imposition of the tax. There, we held that although the General\n\n1\n R.C. Chapter 718 was comprehensively rewritten in 2014. 2014 Sub.H.B. No. 5 (effective Mar.\n23, 2015). We rely on the version of the law that was in force in 2006.\n\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\f                                January Term, 2017\n\n\n\n\nAssembly can restrict a city’s power to tax, it “cannot command [a city] to impose\na tax [on specific income] when [the city] has chosen not to tax that income.” Id.\nat 21-22.\n               B. Cleveland’s Additional Arguments Lack Merit\n       {¶ 33} Cleveland raises a number of other arguments that we can dispose of\nquickly. It challenges certain procedural aspects of the BTA proceeding, arguing\ngenerally that the BTA failed to afford appropriate deference to the decision of the\nreview board. But in MacDonald v. Shaker Hts. Income Tax Bd. of Rev., 144 Ohio\nSt.3d 105, 2015-Ohio-3290, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">376</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, we specifically held that the BTA has\nauthority to review municipal-tax-board decisions de novo as to both facts and law.\nId. at ¶ 23. We also conclude that the BTA did not abuse its discretion in allowing\nPatricia Emond to testify regarding background information about the SERP or in\nconsidering the testimony she gave in the Shaker Heights case. See Orange City\nSchool Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 416-\n417, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">659</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1223</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1996). Further, we are not persuaded that the BTA restricted\nCleveland’s home-rule authority under Ohio Constitution, Article XVIII, Section\n3, when it applied Cleveland’s ordinances to determine whether the SERP was a\npension. In short, we find no error in the review undertaken by the BTA here.\n       {¶ 34} Finally, Cleveland contends that the MacDonalds are estopped from\ncontesting the tax assessment because in 1997 their counsel in this case signed a\nsettlement letter on behalf of National City and other corporate clients that allegedly\nacknowledges that a SERP like the one at issue here is subject to city taxation.\nThere is some dispute as to what type of retirement benefits that agreement covered;\nbut regardless, the MacDonalds cannot be estopped by an agreement to which they\nwere not a party.\n                                III. CONCLUSION\n       {¶ 35} For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the BTA correctly\nreversed the review board’s decision.\n\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n                                                            Decision affirmed.\n       O’CONNOR, C.J., and O’DONNELL, KENNEDY, FRENCH, O’NEILL, and\nFISCHER, JJ., concur.\n                               _________________\n       Baker & Hostetler, L.L.P., Christopher J.
