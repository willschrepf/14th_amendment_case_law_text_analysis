the \r\nTexas Association of School Boards Risk Management Fund seek to have a suit \r\nagainst them transferred from Duval \r\nCounty to \r\nTravis \r\nCounty based on a contractual choice \r\nof venue provision in a risk coverage agreement that is similar to an insurance \r\ncontract. <span> </span>They assert that the \r\nagreement is a “major transaction” within the meaning of section

\r\n15.020 is inapplicable because the coverage agreement is not a “major \r\ntransaction.”<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span>[5]</span></sup></span></span></span></sup></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b>I</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The \r\nTexas Association of School Boards Risk Management Fund (the Fund) is a \r\nnonprofit, statewide administrative agency consisting of cooperating public \r\nschool districts in Texas.<span>  </span>The Fund offers self-funded liability \r\ncoverage plans to education-based political subdivisions.<span>  </span>The Texas Association of School Boards \r\n(TASB) is the Fund’s servicing contractor and provides services including the \r\ninvestigation and handling of property loss claims. </p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In \r\nOctober 2000, Benavides Independent School District (BISD) and the Fund entered \r\ninto an “<span class=\"SpellE\">Interlocal</span> Participation Agreement” under \r\nwhich the Fund agreed to provide vehicle and general liability coverage as well \r\nas coverage for certain casualty losses to property in return for an annual \r\ncontribution from BISD.<span>  </span>The term of \r\nthe agreement was for one year, automatically renewable for two successive \r\none-year terms, with the coverage and contribution amounts adjusted \r\nannually.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The \r\ncoverage was renewed for the first renewal term, and during that term, coverage \r\nfor potential losses or liabilities was in excess of $17,000,000 for an annual \r\ncontribution of $41,973.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span>[6]</span></sup></span></span></span></sup></span><span>  </span>In their briefing in this Court, the \r\nparties have segregated the annual amount paid for coverage of up to $15,309,822 \r\nfor casualty loss to buildings, personal property, and auxiliary structures \r\n<span><span>B</span></span> \r\n$33,069 <span><span>C</span></span> \r\nfrom the annual amount paid for all other coverage <span><span>C</span></span> \r\n$8,904.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This \r\nsuit arises from <span class=\"SpellE\">BISD’s</span> claim for indemnity under the \r\nparties’ agreement for water damage and other alleged physical losses to every \r\nbuilding in its school district, totaling more than $17 million.<span>  </span>TASB denied the claim, and BISD appealed \r\nto the Fund’s Board of Trustees, which affirmed the denial.<span>  </span>BISD then sued the Fund and TASB in \r\nDuval \r\nCounty, asserting claims for breach \r\nof contract, declaratory relief, deceptive trade practices, unconscionable \r\nconduct, negligence, gross negligence, and breach of an alleged duty of good \r\nfaith and fair dealing.<span>  </span>BISD \r\nsubsequently joined two other defendants, alleging negligence against <span class=\"SpellE\">Roofology</span> Consultants Corp., which provided roofing \r\nconsultation to BISD for some of the buildings at issue, and alleging <span class=\"SpellE\">tortious</span> interference and civil conspiracy against Pro-Staff \r\nAdjusting Services, which investigated <span class=\"SpellE\">BISD’s</span> claims \r\non behalf of the Fund and TASB.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The \r\nFund and TASB filed a motion to transfer venue to \r\nTravis \r\nCounty based on a venue provision in \r\nthe coverage agreement, which states “[t]his agreement shall be governed by and \r\nconstrued in accordance with the laws of the State of \r\nTexas, and venue shall lie in \r\nTravis County, Texas, unless otherwise mandated by law.”<span>  </span>The Fund and TASB contend that venue is \r\nmandatory in Travis \r\nCounty pursuant to section 15.020 of \r\nthe Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code because, they assert, the agreement \r\nwith BISD is a “major transaction.”<span>  \r\n</span>That term is defined in section 15.020: </p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><p> </p></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">“major \r\ntransaction” means a transaction evidenced by a written agreement under which a \r\nperson pays or receives, or is obligated to pay or entitled to receive, \r\nconsideration with an aggregate stated value equal to or greater than $1 million \r\n. . . [not including] a transaction entered into primarily for \r\npersonal, family, or household purposes, or to settle a personal injury or \r\nwrongful death claim, without regard to the aggregate value.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span>[7]</span></sup></span></span></span></sup></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><p> </p></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The \r\nFund and TASB contend that the aggregate stated value of the consideration for \r\nthe coverage agreement is <span class=\"SpellE\">BISD’s</span> annual contribution \r\nplus the coverage limits under the agreement, which would exceed section \r\n15.020’s $1 million threshold.<span>  \r\n</span>BISD counters that the consideration is only <span class=\"SpellE\">BISD’s</span> $33,069 annual contribution for property casualty \r\nloss coverage.<span>  </span>Alternatively, BISD \r\nasserts that (1) the choice of venue provision is unenforceable because the \r\ncoverage agreement is unconscionable,<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span>[8]</span></sup></span></span></span></sup></span> \r\n(2) its claim is for damage to real property and therefore venue in \r\nDuval \r\nCounty is mandatory under section \r\n15.011,<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span>[9]</span></sup></span></span></span></sup></span> \r\nor (3) if both sections 15.020 and 15.011 are mandatory, <span class=\"SpellE\">BISD’s</span> choice of venue must be given effect.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The \r\ntrial court denied the Fund and <span class=\"SpellE\">TASB’s</span> motion to \r\ntransfer venue without stating its reasons, and the court of appeals summarily \r\ndenied the Fund and <span class=\"SpellE\">TASB’s</span> petition for writ of \r\nmandamus.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span>[10]</span></sup></span></span></span></sup></span><span>  </span>Because our conclusion that section \r\n15.020 does not apply to the coverage agreement is <span class=\"SpellE\">dispositive</span> of the request for mandamus relief, we do not \r\nreach the other issues raised by the parties.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b>II</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If \r\na trial court erroneously denies enforcement of a mandatory venue provision, \r\nmandamus relief is available without the necessity of showing an inadequate \r\nappellate remedy.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span>[11]</span></sup></span></span></span></sup></span><span>  </span>Because trial courts have no discretion \r\nin determining the legal principles controlling their rulings or in applying the \r\nlaw to the facts, our focus in this case is whether the trial court failed to \r\ncorrectly apply section 15.020.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span>[12]</span></sup></span></span></span></sup></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Construction \r\nof section 15.020 is an issue of first impression for this Court.<span>  </span>That section provides in its \r\nentirety:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><p> </p></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>§

Association of School Boards Risk Management Fund (the Fund) is a \r\nnonprofit, statewide administrative agency consisting of cooperating public \r\nschool districts in Texas.<span>  </span>The Fund offers self-funded liability \r\ncoverage plans to education-based political subdivisions.<span>  </span>The Texas Association of School Boards \r\n(TASB) is the Fund’s servicing contractor and provides services including the \r\ninvestigation and handling of property loss claims. </p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In \r\nOctober 2000, Benavides Independent School District (BISD) and the Fund entered \r\ninto an “<span class=\"SpellE\">Interlocal</span> Participation Agreement” under \r\nwhich the Fund agreed to provide vehicle and general liability coverage as well \r\nas coverage for certain casualty losses to property in return for an annual \r\ncontribution from BISD.<span>  </span>The term of \r\nthe agreement was for one year, automatically renewable for two successive \r\none-year terms, with the coverage and contribution amounts adjusted \r\nannually.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The \r\ncoverage was renewed for the first renewal term, and during that term, coverage \r\nfor potential losses or liabilities was in excess of $17,000,000 for an annual \r\ncontribution of $41,973.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span>[6]</span></sup></span></span></span></sup></span><span>  </span>In their briefing in this Court, the \r\nparties have segregated the annual amount paid for coverage of up to $15,309,822 \r\nfor casualty loss to buildings, personal property, and auxiliary structures \r\n<span><span>B</span></span> \r\n$33,069 <span><span>C</span></span> \r\nfrom the annual amount paid for all other coverage <span><span>C</span></span> \r\n$8,904.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This \r\nsuit arises from <span class=\"SpellE\">BISD’s</span> claim for indemnity under the \r\nparties’ agreement for water damage and other alleged physical losses to every \r\nbuilding in its school district, totaling more than $17 million.<span>  </span>TASB denied the claim, and BISD appealed \r\nto the Fund’s Board of Trustees, which affirmed the denial.<span>  </span>BISD then sued the Fund and TASB in \r\nDuval \r\nCounty, asserting claims for breach \r\nof contract, declaratory relief, deceptive trade practices, unconscionable \r\nconduct, negligence, gross negligence, and breach of an alleged duty of good \r\nfaith and fair dealing.<span>  </span>BISD \r\nsubsequently joined two other defendants, alleging negligence against <span class=\"SpellE\">Roofology</span> Consultants Corp., which provided roofing \r\nconsultation to BISD for some of the buildings at issue, and alleging <span class=\"SpellE\">tortious</span> interference and civil conspiracy against Pro-Staff \r\nAdjusting Services, which investigated <span class=\"SpellE\">BISD’s</span> claims \r\non behalf of the Fund and TASB.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The \r\nFund and TASB filed a motion to transfer venue to \r\nTravis \r\nCounty based on a venue provision in \r\nthe coverage agreement, which states “[t]his agreement shall be governed by and \r\nconstrued in accordance with the laws of the State of \r\nTexas, and venue shall lie in \r\nTravis County, Texas, unless otherwise mandated by law.”<span>  </span>The Fund and TASB contend that venue is \r\nmandatory in Travis \r\nCounty pursuant to section 15.020 of \r\nthe Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code because, they assert, the agreement \r\nwith BISD is a “major transaction.”<span>  \r\n</span>That term is defined in section 15.020: </p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><p> </p></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">“major \r\ntransaction” means a transaction evidenced by a written agreement under which a \r\nperson pays or receives, or is obligated to pay or entitled to receive, \r\nconsideration with an aggregate stated value equal to or greater than $1 million \r\n. . . [not including] a transaction entered into primarily for \r\npersonal, family, or household purposes, or to settle a personal injury or \r\nwrongful death claim, without regard to the aggregate value.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span>[7]</span></sup></span></span></span></sup></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><p> </p></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The \r\nFund and TASB contend that the aggregate stated value of the consideration for \r\nthe coverage agreement is <span class=\"SpellE\">BISD’s</span> annual contribution \r\nplus the coverage limits under the agreement, which would exceed section \r\n15.020’s $1 million threshold.<span>  \r\n</span>BISD counters that the consideration is only <span class=\"SpellE\">BISD’s</span> $33,069 annual contribution for property casualty \r\nloss coverage.<span>  </span>Alternatively, BISD \r\nasserts that (1) the choice of venue provision is unenforceable because the \r\ncoverage agreement is unconscionable,<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span>[8]</span></sup></span></span></span></sup></span> \r\n(2) its claim is for damage to real property and therefore venue in \r\nDuval \r\nCounty is mandatory under section \r\n15.011,<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span>[9]</span></sup></span></span></span></sup></span> \r\nor (3) if both sections 15.020 and 15.011 are mandatory, <span class=\"SpellE\">BISD’s</span> choice of venue must be given effect.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The \r\ntrial court denied the Fund and <span class=\"SpellE\">TASB’s</span> motion to \r\ntransfer venue without stating its reasons, and the court of appeals summarily \r\ndenied the Fund and <span class=\"SpellE\">TASB’s</span> petition for writ of \r\nmandamus.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span>[10]</span></sup></span></span></span></sup></span><span>  </span>Because our conclusion that section \r\n15.020 does not apply to the coverage agreement is <span class=\"SpellE\">dispositive</span> of the request for mandamus relief, we do not \r\nreach the other issues raised by the parties.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b>II</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If \r\na trial court erroneously denies enforcement of a mandatory venue provision, \r\nmandamus relief is available without the necessity of showing an inadequate \r\nappellate remedy.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span>[11]</span></sup></span></span></span></sup></span><span>  </span>Because trial courts have no discretion \r\nin determining the legal principles controlling their rulings or in applying the \r\nlaw to the facts, our focus in this case is whether the trial court failed to \r\ncorrectly apply section 15.020.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span>[12]</span></sup></span></span></span></sup></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Construction \r\nof
