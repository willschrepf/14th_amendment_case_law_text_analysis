Ct. No. BA181702\n____________________________________)\n\n\n        A jury convicted defendant Marcus Dorwin Adams of the 1994 first degree\nmurders of Dayland Hicks, Lamar Armstrong, and Trevon Boyd (Pen. Code,\n§ 187),1 the attempted murder of Luis Hernandez (§§ 187, subd. (a), 664), and\ncarjacking. (§ 215, subd. (a).) The jury found true the allegation that defendant\ndischarged a firearm at an occupied motor vehicle causing great bodily injury and\ndeath within the meaning of section 12022, subdivision (b)(1), with respect to the\nthree murder counts. The jury also found true the alleged multiple-murder special\ncircumstance. (§ 190.2, subd. (a)(3).) With respect to the attempted murder, the\njury found true the allegation that defendant personally inflicted great bodily\ninjury upon the victim within the meaning of section 12022.7, subdivision (a).\nThe jury returned a verdict of death for the three first degree murders.\n\n\n1      All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise\nindicated.\n\n\n\n\n                                          1\n\f       The trial court denied defendant‟s motion to reduce the penalty and his\nmotion for a new penalty phase trial and sentenced defendant to death. The court\nalso imposed, but stayed, a determinate sentence of nine years in prison for\ndefendant‟s attempted murder conviction and an indeterminate term of life with\nthe possibility of parole for his conviction of carjacking. This appeal is automatic.\n(§ 1239, subd. (b).) We affirm the judgment.\n                                      I. FACTS\n\n       A. Guilt phase evidence\n       In early September 1994, defendant, a member of the Six Deuce Brim\nBloods gang, walked up to the car in which three members of the Rollin‟ 60s Crips\ngang were sitting. He shot and killed all three men at close range. Not quite a\nmonth later, defendant shot a security guard patrolling the parking lot of a credit\nunion. He fled the scene with his two companions. In a nearby neighborhood,\nthey carjacked a woman‟s car.\n       At trial, regarding the first three shootings, defendant challenged the\ncredibility of the witnesses who identified him as the shooter. Regarding the later\nincidents, defendant claimed one of his companions was the shooter and had\npulled the woman out of her car.\n\n           1. The September 7, 1994 homicides\n       On the afternoon of September 7, 1994, Lewis Dyer was standing with\nZenia Meeks, a drug addict, on Western Avenue at 47th Street in Los Angeles,\nacross the street from Ford‟s Liquor store. The area was known as a Crips gang\nneighborhood and Dyer was a member of the 46th Street Neighborhood Crips\ngang. Dyer and Meeks saw Dayland Hicks, Lamar Armstrong, and Trevon Boyd,\nmembers of the Rollin‟ 60s Crips gang, drive up in a Cadillac and park in front of\nthe liquor store. The two Crips gangs were friendly. Dyer and Meeks walked\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\fover to the Cadillac, and Dyer began to speak with Hicks. Dyer and Hicks went\ninto the liquor store. After Hicks bought a beer, they returned to the Cadillac.\nHicks got into the driver‟s seat. Boyd was sitting in the front passenger seat, and\nArmstrong was sitting in the backseat. Dyer leaned on the passenger side of the\ncar and continued to speak with the three men. According to Meeks, she stood\nnear the hood of the car, waiting for the men to finish their conversation.\n         Dyer and Meeks both noticed a young man walking toward them. Dyer\nrecognized the man as defendant, whom he knew to be a Bloods gang member\nwith the gang moniker of “Little Sonny.” Dyer and defendant knew each other\nwhen they were both held in the same California Youth Authority (CYA) juvenile\nfacility. Although defendant belonged to a Bloods gang, he was not wearing\ncolors associated with the Bloods gangs, but colors that blended into the Crips\nneighborhood. During this time in 1994 a gang war was underway between the\nBloods and the Crips. The 46th Street Neighborhood Crips gang, along with the\nRollin‟ 60s Crips gang, were enemies of the Six Deuce Brim Bloods gang —\ndefendant‟s gang. Defendant pulled out a gun and shot at Dyer. Dyer ducked,\ncrawled to the front of the car, then stood up and ran down the street while\ndefendant fired a number of shots into the Cadillac at close range. Meeks stood\nstill.\n         Hicks suffered a fatal gunshot wound to his head at the right temple area\nand a nonfatal gunshot wound to his upper right arm. The wounds were consistent\nwith Hicks having raised his arm up in a defensive position at the side of his head.\nBoyd suffered gunshot wounds to his chest, the ring finger of his left hand, and his\nright forearm. One of the bullets that entered his chest fatally damaged his liver\nand heart. Armstrong was also shot in the arm and chest. The bullet that entered\nhis chest fatally damaged his liver, heart, and left lung. When defendant finished\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\fshooting, he walked back toward an alley, got into a red four-door car, and drove\ndown 47th Street.\n       Hicks died in the Cadillac. Boyd exited the Cadillac and ran into Ford‟s\nLiquor store. Meeks followed Boyd into the store and saw that he had been shot.\nShe ran back across the street to a pay phone, dialed 911, and reported the\nshootings. Lisa Mallard, who was in the liquor store with the owner, an employee,\nand another individual, tried to calm Boyd. Mallard told him that the paramedics\nwere coming, but Boyd passed out and died. Armstrong exited the Cadillac, but\ncollapsed near the corner of 47th and Western. Armstrong and Boyd were\ntransported to area hospitals. Armstrong died at the hospital.\n       When Dyer returned to the scene, he saw Hicks‟s body still in the driver‟s\nseat, with blood everywhere. He saw the police and paramedics arrive, but he did\nnot talk to them. Dyer felt that he should not say anything because a gang member\nwould be labeled a “snitch” if he spoke to the police about a gang-related crime,\neven if the crime was committed by a rival gang against the member‟s own gang.\nDyer feared that if he told the police what he knew about the shooting, others\nwould try to harm him. He did not want to get involved. Instead, Dyer went to a\nnearby pay phone and called Hicks‟s uncle, Gregory Shoaf. He told Shoaf that\nHicks had been shot and that defendant was the shooter.\n       On the day of the homicides, police officers took Meeks to the police\nstation for an interview. Meeks did not give Dyer‟s name to the police because\nshe wanted to protect him. And although Meeks had recognized defendant as the\nshooter, she did not identify him to the police because she was frightened and did\nnot want to get involved. Instead, she told the police that she was unable to\nidentify the shooter, claiming she was high and on psychiatric medication. Police\nspoke with Meeks several times and showed her a set of photographs of possible\nsuspects. Meeks did not identify anyone because of concerns about her own and\n\n                                         4\n\fher family‟s safety. At trial, she explained that a member of her family had\nreceived a telephone call that Meeks understood as a warning to keep quiet.\n       A week after the shootings, the police contacted Dyer, but he gave them no\ninformation. He claimed that he was inside the liquor store when the shots were\nfired. The next day, after receiving information from Shoaf that Dyer was a\nwitness to the shooting, the police asked Dyer to come into the police station.\nWhen Dyer arrived, Shoaf, Shoaf‟s sister, and Boyd‟s mother were there. Dyer\nwas initially reluctant to talk to the police, but changed his mind after the family\nmembers convinced him he should tell the police what he knew about the killing\nof his friends. Dyer told the police what happened and gave a written statement.\nHe identified defendant as the shooter in a photographic lineup.\n       Defendant was taken into custody early in October 1994 and interviewed as\na suspect regarding various gang murders. Defendant told the interviewing\ndetectives that he knew about the killings on Western Avenue. He said the shooter\nput on a blue shirt to make the victims think he was a Crips gang member. He\nwalked up to their car and “dumped on them,” using a .9-millimeter handgun and\nfled in a red car. Defendant, however, denied being present, denied committing\nthe shootings, and refused to disclose the name of the perpetrator. He stated that\nthe shooter knew the Crips gang member who witnessed the shooting because they\nhad been in jail together, but defendant denied knowing the witness himself.\nDefendant told the detectives that his family fell apart after Rollin‟ 60s gang\nmembers killed his brother. He blamed the 60s for what happened to his family.\nDefendant told the detectives that he was not admitting the murders, but if he had\ndone them, the reason would be the killing of his brother.\n       Dyer was subsequently arrested on a parole violation and taken to county\njail. Defendant was in the same jail at that time. When Dyer was asked to view a\nlive lineup that included defendant, Dyer did not identify defendant as the shooter\n\n                                          5\n\fbecause he was afraid of what could happen to him in jail if he was labeled a\nsnitch. Sometime later, Dyer was brought to an office where defendant was\nwaiting. Defendant told Dyer not to say anything and showed him a copy of the\nstatement Dyer had made to police identifying defendant as the shooter.\nDefendant told Dyer that the sheriff‟s deputy who escorted him to the office was\ndefendant‟s cousin and that defendant could have Dyer moved to a safe facility as\nlong as Dyer did not identify him. Defendant told Dyer that he had given him “a\npass,” meaning he could have killed him when he shot the others but chose not to.\nDyer assured defendant that he had not picked him out of the lineup and that he\ndid not intend to “tell on [him].” At trial, Dyer testified that he had decided not to\ntestify or cooperate with the police even before this conversation. Dyer testified\nthat he was concerned that if his statement to police “[got] around the jail” he\ncould be hurt or killed. He said that he received threats before and after the lineup.\n       When a defense investigator subsequently came to interview him at the\nCYA facility where Dyer was transferred, Dyer lied and said that he had been in\nthe liquor store at the time of the shootings. He told the investigator that he did\nnot see anything and claimed the victims‟ families pressured him into making his\nstatement to the police. Meeks continued to be uncooperative with the police. In\n1995, the case against defendant was dismissed and he was released.\n       In 1998, investigators from the Santa Barbara County District Attorney‟s\nOffice contacted Dyer, who had been released from custody a couple of years\nearlier. The investigators asked about the 1994 murders. Because Dyer was\ntrying to reform his life, he decided to cooperate with them and to testify against\ndefendant. He told the investigators about being threatened and about his\njailhouse conversation with defendant. When Dyer was contacted by Los Angeles\npolice detectives and asked to attend a live lineup in 1999, Dyer identified\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fdefendant as the shooter of his three friends. Dyer also identified defendant as the\nshooter at defendant‟s preliminary hearing and again at trial.\n       Kipchoge Johnson testified at defendant‟s trial that until 2000 he belonged\nto the Van Ness Gangsters, a Brim Bloods gang that was “best friends” with\ndefendant‟s gang, the Six Deuce Brim gang. Johnson testified that he decided to\ntell the police what he knew about this shooting because he had become\n“disgusted” with the gang lifestyle and had become friends with the brother of one\nof the three victims.\n       Johnson recalled being with defendant in 1994 when defendant received an\nupsetting phone call. Defendant told Johnson that one of defendant‟s “homies”\nhad just been killed by a Crips gang member. A few days later defendant came in\nwith a newspaper article. He said, “This is what I did for the homies” and threw\nthe newspaper on the floor. Everybody ran to look at it. Johnson saw that it was\nan article about the killings of the three Rollin‟ 60s gang members. Some of the\nolder gang members who were present asked defendant what had happened.\nDefendant replied that he “ran up on them” and with five shots “domed,” meaning\nshot in the head, all three of the men who were inside a parked Cadillac. He had\nmade sure they were Crips gang members by “throwing” their neighborhood sign\nat them and having them throw the sign back to him. Johnson testified that using\nonly five shots and shooting a person in the head would garner more status for a\ngang member. He also testified that a gang member would not take credit for a\nkilling that he did not commit because if he did, he would be disciplined and\nkicked out of the neighborhood. According to Johnson, if defendant bragged\nabout killing someone, he must have done it. Johnson believed it fair to say that\ndefendant hated the Rollin‟ 60s gang.\n       A few months after the killings, Johnson met defendant on the county jail\nbus while going to court. Johnson asked defendant who had identified him as the\n\n                                         7\n\fshooter and defendant replied it was the person to whom he had given a “pass”\nand allowed to run away based on their prior custody together in CYA. Defendant\nsaid that he should have killed him too. Johnson subsequently heard defendant tell\nsome Crips gang members that he was going to “beat this,” get out of jail, and kill\nsome more of their members.\n       Christopher Fennelle was a member of the Six Deuce Brim Bloods gang\nuntil 1995. He knew defendant for a number of years as a member of the same\ngang. Fennelle testified that sometime in 1995 defendant came to Fennelle‟s\nhome because he wanted to buy a gun. As they were talking, defendant brought\nup the subject of the three Rollin‟ 60s Crips who were killed the previous year.\nDefendant told Fennelle that he had seen the Cadillac parked with three Crips\ninside and one standing outside. As defendant walked up to the car, the man by\nthe passenger door saw him and took off running. Defendant said he fired shots at\nthe fleeing man and then shot everyone in the car.\n       Special precautions were taken to protect both Johnson and Fennelle while\nthey were testifying during the trial. And they were both promised that whenever\nthey were released from prison they would be provided with witness relocation\nservices.\n       In 2001, Meeks was in a drug rehabilitation program and had become a\nChristian. She decided to cooperate with authorities regarding the 1994 shooting.\nShe subsequently identified defendant in a photo lineup as the shooter.\n\n            2. The October 3, 1994 attempted murder and carjacking\n       On October 3, 1994, Luis Hernandez was working as a security guard\npatrolling a parking lot for several Santa Monica businesses, including the\nTelephone Employees Credit Union. About 10:30 a.m., a car approached\nHernandez. There were three African-American men in the car. The front\n\n\n\n                                         8\n\fpassenger asked Hernandez if he knew the location of Santa Monica College. As\nHernandez pointed to the left, the man said, “Don‟t move,” reached into the glove\ncompartment of the car, and pulled out a handgun. Hernandez turned and ran\ntoward the entrance to the credit union. He heard several shots behind him. He\nwas hit and fell down, but got up again and continued running. He was shot again\nas he reached the credit union door and collapsed after he entered the building. He\nwas taken to the hospital where he had surgery and remained for a week. He was\nout of work for two months.\n       Jasmine Green was inside the credit union that morning, and looked up\nwhen she heard gunshots. She observed a yellow Cadillac parked outside and as\nshe watched, a man stepped from the passenger side of the car and shot at\nHernandez, the security guard. Hernandez ran past the window and into the credit\nunion, collapsing in front of her. Green then saw the shooter get back in the car\nand the car drive away. She got a good look at the shooter. She believed he used\na .9-millimeter gun, and described all three men in the car as African-American.\n       About 11:15 a.m. on the same day, Socorro Navarro drove to the Santa\nMonica home of her friend, Linda Nicastro, to give her a ride to work. Navarro\nstopped in front of her friend‟s home on Oak Street, which is about six blocks\naway from the Telephone Employees Credit Union. Navarro honked her horn and\nNicastro came out of the house. Before Nicastro could get to Navarro‟s car, a\nyellow car with two African-American men in the front seat suddenly came from\nthe opposite direction and stopped next to Navarro. The driver got out and\napproached Navarro. He produced a gun and said, “Bitch, get out of the car.”\nFrightened, Navarro complied. She walked over to Nicastro. They grabbed hands\nand walked toward the apartment building without looking back toward the car.\nNavarro heard the sound of cars speeding away. She turned and saw her car and\nthe yellow car drive away in the same direction.\n\n                                         9\n\f        Jerry Flannery lived across the street from Nicastro. Around 11:15 a.m.\nthat morning, he had just parked his car and was walking across the street when he\nheard another car approaching at a high rate of speed. He heard it slam on its\nbrakes and saw it pull up next to Navarro‟s car. He saw three people inside the\ncar. Flannery testified that the driver, an African-American male in his late 20s,\ngot out and walked up to Navarro, yelling at her to get out of her car. Flannery\nstarted toward Navarro to help her, but the man raised a gun, which Flannery\nrecognized as a .9-millimeter semiautomatic. When the man pointed it at\nFlannery, Flannery dove behind the parked cars, then crawled to the front of one\nof the cars and peeked around the corner. Flannery saw the man yank Navarro‟s\ncar door open, grab Navarro by the hair, and drag her out of the car. Flannery\nturned and went to nearby apartment buildings, knocking on three or four doors in\nan attempt to get someone to call the police. Flannery returned to the street in\ntime to see the two cars drive away. Flannery got back into his car and tried to\nfollow them in order to obtain a license plate number, but was unable to find the\ncars.\n        In 1999, Santa Monica Police Sergeant Gary Steiner was assigned to\nreinvestigate the 1994 credit union shooting and subsequent carjacking. He\ninterviewed defendant after he heard that defendant had information regarding the\ncase. Defendant told Steiner that he wanted to get his former friend Chauncey\nBowen, who was the brother of Fennelle, in trouble because Bowen had tried to\nkill defendant and defendant‟s girlfriend. Defendant described the shooting of\nHernandez at the credit union and the subsequent carjacking of Navarro, but\nclaimed that he had acted only as a lookout and that Bowen was both the shooter\nat the credit union and the man who dragged Navarro out of her car. Defendant\ntold Steiner that he later bought the gun that Bowen had used and it was that gun\nhe had with him when he was arrested back in October 1994.\n\n                                         10\n\f       Forensic examination in 1995 of the shell casings and bullet fragments\nrecovered in connection with the shooting of Hernandez determined that the shell\ncasings were fired from one gun and that the bullets were also fired from one gun.\nBut without the benefit of analyzing the gun itself, it could not be determined that\nthe casings and bullets were fired from the same gun. After defendant‟s interview\nstatements in 1999, the shell casings and bullet fragments were reanalyzed, along\nwith the gun seized when defendant was arrested in 1994. It was then determined\nthat the shell casings and bullet fragments had been fired from that gun. That gun\nwas not the weapon used in the 1994 killings of Hicks, Boyd, and Armstrong.\n       In 1999, credit union customer Green was shown a photographic lineup of\npossible suspects in the credit union shooting. She identified defendant‟s picture\nas being that of the shooter. She also identified defendant as the shooter in a\nsubsequent live lineup and later at trial.\n\n       B. Penalty phase evidence\n\n           1. Evidence submitted in aggravation under factor (b) of section 190.3\n       In the penalty phase, the prosecution presented evidence of defendant‟s\nhistory of numerous criminal activities involving the use or attempted use of force,\nviolence or threat. (§ 190.3, factor (b).)\n\n                a. Carjackings committed as a juvenile\n       The prosecution presented evidence of two carjackings committed by\ndefendant when he was 17 years old.\n       According to Alice Rox, on January 21, 1988, she parked her car on her\nway to a swap meet in Los Angeles. When she got out of her car, a male, whom\nshe later identified as defendant, pointed a gun at her and demanded the keys to\nher car. She tossed the keys to him, and defendant took her car. The car was\nrecovered a few days later.\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f       Dwain Edwards testified that on February 4, 1988, he drove his car to a gas\nstation. Edwards was about to fill his car when a male, whom Edwards later\nidentified as defendant, pointed a machine gun at him and demanded his keys.\nEdwards complied and ran approximately 50 feet away. When he turned around,\nhe saw defendant leaving in his car. Defendant was taken into custody later that\nday on the campus of a local high school, and police seized a machine gun that a\nwitness claimed to have seen defendant hide. The weapon held a 50-round clip,\nwhich contained 40 rounds when it was examined. Defendant admitted\ncommitting both the January 21 and February 4 carjackings. Edwards‟s car was\nrecovered several days later.\n\n               b. September 1994 robbery of Pacific Marine Credit Union\n       On the morning of September 27, 1994 — three weeks after the triple\nhomicide of Hicks, Boyd, and Armstrong and six days before the attempted\nmurder of Hernandez and the carjacking of Navarro — Melissa Lopez was\nworking as the head teller and assistant manager at the Pacific Marine Credit\nUnion in Oceanside. Lopez testified that at approximately 11:30 a.m., the glass\ndouble doors of the credit union flew open and three or four African-American\nmen ran inside. They were carrying semiautomatic weapons, which they pointed\nat the tellers. Two of the men hurdled the first two teller counters and ordered\neveryone to the ground. Lopez was ordered to get up when she identified herself\nas the person who was in charge of the credit union that morning. One man, later\ndetermined to be defendant, led her to the vault at gunpoint and demanded she\nopen it. Lopez fumbled with the keys. Defendant put his gun next to her temple\nand said he would shoot her if she did not hurry. After she opened the vault,\ndefendant took the currency and placed it in a bag. Lopez could hear another man\non the other side of the credit union ordering tellers to open their drawers. The\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\fmen left the credit union, and someone called 911. After the robbery, the credit\nunion manager performed an audit and determined that $161,589.23 had been\ntaken. Lopez identified defendant at trial as the man who had forced her back to\nthe vault, held a gun at her head, and took the currency.\n         Michael Loughran worked for a company whose office was inside the\ncredit union. He testified that he heard the commotion in the credit union that\nmorning. He looked around his door and saw an African-American man, whom\nLoughran identified in court as defendant, pointing a gun at him. Defendant told\nLoughran to come into the bank and lie down by the tellers. Loughran complied,\nand heard sounds from the vault area. Then defendant, holding a big bag, jumped\nover the counter and landed next to Loughran. Defendant put his knee on\nLoughran‟s chest and asked if he had any money. Loughran reached into his top\npocket, where he usually kept his cash, but pulled out his business cards by\nmistake. Defendant hit Loughran in the head with his gun and said, “Give me all\nyour money, white boy.” He pointed the gun at Loughran‟s face. Loughran\nremembered his money was in a different pocket. He handed defendant two $100\nbills. Defendant took Loughran‟s pager, stood up, and walked out of the credit\nunion. Loughran identified defendant at trial as the man who pointed the gun at\nhim and took his money and pager.\n         According to Bloods gang member Kipchoge Johnson, defendant bragged\nabout the robbery of the credit union. Johnson explained that defendant did not\nhave a job; defendant‟s job was being a gangster. Johnson said that defendant\nwould rob banks and kill people, go to prison, get out and do the same thing over\nagain.\n         Santa Monica Detective Steiner interviewed defendant in 1999. According\nto Steiner, defendant said that he and Chauncey Bowen had robbed the credit\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\funion in Oceanside in September 1994. According to defendant, they stole almost\n$200,000. Defendant described his role in the robbery to Steiner.\n       Melissa Lopez testified regarding the impact the robbery had on her life.\nAccording to Lopez, she had worked at the Pacific Marine Credit Union for three\nand a half years at the time of the robbery. She loved working there and felt she\nhad a strong future. After the robbery, she immediately started looking for a\ndifferent job. She completely changed her field of work. She required six months\nof posttraumatic stress syndrome therapy, seeing a therapist twice a week. She\nsuffered nightmares for a long time after the robbery. At the time of trial in 2003,\nshe was still frightened of doors opening quickly and of people who looked\n“suspicious.” She did not trust people and avoided public areas after dark.\nDefendant‟s face was forever ingrained in her head and she “freaked out”\nwhenever she saw someone who resembled defendant.\n\n               c. October 1995 shooting of George Minor\n       One night in October 1995 — two weeks after defendant had been released\nfrom custody — George Minor, a drug dealer and gang member, was standing in\nthe front yard of his home speaking with some neighbors. According to Minor,\ndefendant and two other African-American men approached him. One of the men\nasked for an individual named “Ray Ray.” Minor said Ray Ray was not there.\nDefendant, who was holding a gun, then moved the two other men aside and\nstepped up to Minor, saying, “You Ray Ray.” Defendant announced he was “East\nCoast,” a rival gang, and he and one of the other men began shooting at Minor.\nMinor was hit in the arm and the leg before he ran behind a car parked in the\ndriveway. Both shooters fired multiple additional shots at the car and the house.\nWhen the gunfire ceased, the men scattered.\n\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\f       Minor testified that he ran into his house, and someone called 911.\nAlthough a number of bullets went through the walls of the house, Minor‟s sisters\nand nieces who were inside were not injured. Minor was taken to the hospital,\nwhere he stayed for several weeks. At the hospital, Minor selected defendant‟s\npicture from a photographic lineup as one of the shooters. He also identified\ndefendant at trial as the man who called him Ray Ray and shot him. He had no\ndoubt about his identification.\n       Minor‟s wife, Saudia, testified that she was coming home from the store\nwhen she saw the men shooting at her husband. Defendant was one of the\nshooters. When she saw everyone scatter, she got out of the car and went into the\nhouse, where she was told Minor had been shot. Paramedics arrived and Minor\nwas taken to the hospital.\n       Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff Angel Jaimes was patrolling with his\npartner on the night of the shooting. Upon hearing approximately 10 gunshots,\nJaimes testified that he drove toward the sound of the gunfire and was flagged\ndown by a man who was standing in the middle of the street. The man said he had\nseen the shooters and that they were headed west. Jaimes allowed him to get into\nthe rear seat of the patrol car and they drove west. When they spotted a white\nCadillac with two African-American males inside, the man got excited and\npointed, saying, “That‟s him, that‟s him.” Jaimes and his partner requested\nassistance and conducted a traffic stop of the Cadillac. Defendant and another\nman exited the Cadillac. Jaimes searched the car and found two hidden handguns,\na .9-millimeter automatic and a .380-caliber automatic. Both men were taken into\ncustody. During booking, Jaimes tested defendant‟s hands for gunshot residue.\nSubsequent analysis determined that gunshot residue was present on both of his\nhands. A criminalist testified that analysis of the bullet casings and an expended\n\n\n\n                                        15\n\fbullet recovered from the scene of the shooting determined that they were fired\nfrom the two guns recovered from the Cadillac.\n       Minor testified that after he was subpoenaed as a witness regarding the\nshooting, he received a phone call telling him not to come to court. Saudia\ntestified that she received multiple strange phone calls after she was subpoenaed as\na witness. According to Saudia, the calls to her were from a woman and a man.\nOn one occasion, she was asked by the caller to attend a court hearing and lie\nabout what she saw. On another occasion, a man said he knew where Saudia‟s\ndaughter went to school and that Saudia worked at International House of\nPancakes. Saudia testified that she was frightened. Both Minor and his wife\ntestified that they believed the calls were “three-way” calls from the county jail.\nAccording to Saudia, she responded to the subpoena and went to court, but when\nshe saw defendant behind a window, she left because she was worried about her\nfamily‟s safety. At defendant‟s capital trial, however, Saudia identified defendant\nas one of the shooters.\n\n               d. August 1997 robbery of Vandenberg Federal Credit Union and\n                   killing of Christine Orciuch\n       Defendant was released on parole on July 15, 1997.\n       On the morning of August 8, 1997, Jasper Altheide was working as a teller\nat the Vandenberg Federal Credit Union in Lompoc. He testified that four men,\nincluding Chauncey Bowen and defendant, entered the credit union. Bowen\nwalked over to the counter and pretended to fill out a deposit slip or envelope.\nDefendant then ran up to the counter with a shotgun. Defendant began screaming,\n“Get the fuck down or I‟ll shoot you.” He jumped over the counter and asked for\nthe manager. When no one responded, defendant said he would shoot someone.\nAnother credit union employee, Moira Philley, testified that she told defendant\nthat the manager was in the back. Defendant told Philley to get up and kicked her\n\n\n                                         16\n\fhard in the foot. When she rose, defendant put the shotgun against her back and\nshoved her. Philley led defendant toward the back where the manager was.\nAccording to Philley, as she and defendant were walking through a doorway, two\ngunshots were fired. The gunshots came from the other side of the counter near\nthe front door and were not fired by defendant. Defendant screamed, “What the\nfuck?” Someone said, “let‟s get out of here,” and defendant and the other robbers\nleft the credit union. Philley raced to call 911 and report the robbery. An audit\nlater determined that the robbers had taken a little over $11,000 from the teller\ndrawers.\n       Octavio Gallardo was approaching the front door of the credit union while\nthe robbery was in progress. He had a broken left leg and was walking on\ncrutches. Gallardo testified that a woman, later determined to be Christine\nOrciuch, asked if he needed help and opened the door for him. After he entered, a\nman wearing a mask pointed a handgun at him and told him to get down.\nAccording to Gallardo, the man shot him in the right thigh before he could\ncomply. Gallardo fell to the ground. The woman, who was behind Gallardo,\nturned and ran out. The man with the gun yelled at her to stop and come back.\nGallardo then heard another gunshot. Orciuch was fatally shot and immediately\nfell to the sidewalk. Someone said, “Let‟s go,” and Gallardo heard the sound of\nrunning toward the parking lot. One of the robbers stopped to take a backpack\nfrom Orciuch before running away.\n       Orciuch‟s 11-year-old son, Quentin, was waiting for his mom in their car\nwhen he heard the gunshots and heard his mother scream his name. According to\nQuentin, he jumped out of the car and saw his mother lying facedown on the\nground. Three men were running from the credit union. Quentin ran to the side\ndoor of the credit union, where he banged on the door and yelled that his mother\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\fhad been shot. He was allowed inside, but was prevented from going to his\nmother‟s body.\n       Defendant‟s former fellow gang member Fennelle testified that a few\nweeks before this robbery and murder, Fennelle spoke with defendant and Bowen\nat the house of Sabrina Johnson. The two men told Fennelle that they were\nplanning an armed bank robbery. They said they needed cars, and that they would\ncollect a lot of money. They asked Fennelle if he wanted to participate. Fennelle\nrefused and tried to convince Bowen and defendant not to do it. He warned them\nthat if someone was killed in the robbery, they would be equally responsible for\nthe murder. Defendant told him that he did not care and was determined to go\nahead as planned. According to investigating officers, defendant admitted, in\ninterviews after his arrest, that he was present during the robbery.2\n       Several witnesses testified concerning the impact of the robbery and\nshooting on them and their family as follows.\n       Jasper Altheide testified that she had difficulties after the robbery because\nduring the robbery she had lain under the counter, and although she had the keys\nto the vault and could have given the robbers the money, she did not do so because\nshe was so frightened. According to Altheide, she felt very guilty about not\nallowing Orciuch‟s son to see Orciuch after Orciuch was shot and felt directly\nresponsible for her death. Every time she saw Orciuch‟s family, her heart hurt.\nAltheide had nightmares, was fearful, and no longer wanted to be around people.\n\n\n\n\n2       In his application for a new penalty phase trial, defendant acknowledged\nthat he was subsequently convicted of the Vandenberg Federal Credit Union\nrobbery and murder and had received a sentence of life without the possibility of\nparole.\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\fShe constantly worried and had difficulty working at the credit union. She had\ncounseling, and testified that “the innocence of living is gone.”\n       Moira Philley testified that the robbery and shootings at the Vandenberg\nFederal Credit Union had a tremendous effect on her life. Her marriage almost\n“fell apart from it.” She and her children were “freaked out” by it. She would not\nopen the front door and installed an alarm system. She testified that she was\nconstantly watchful, had anxiety attacks when at work, and eventually had to\nreceive trauma counseling. She had nightmares of Quentin screaming, and felt\nguilty because she survived, but Orciuch did not. She knew the Orciuch family\nand felt for them. For years, the credit union maintained a memorial near the\nflower beds where Orciuch died and Philley found it terrible to watch Orciuch‟s\nhusband light the candles every night and then blow them out every morning.\n       Octavio Gallardo testified that the shooting at the credit union caused him\nto be very fearful. For a time he was afraid to leave his apartment. He required\nmedical attention for his gunshot wound and his leg still hurt when the weather\nwas very cold.\n       Orciuch‟s husband, Chester Orciuch, testified that at the time of his wife‟s\ndeath, they had three children; a daughter age 17, a daughter age 14, and a son,\nQuentin, age 11. When he arrived at the hospital, he was taken to a room and told\nthat his wife had been fatally shot. He screamed “Oh, no” and asked for his\nfamily. He was taken to another room where his eldest daughter was trying to\ncomfort Quentin, who was asking if his mommy was okay. Chester told his\nchildren that their mother had gone to heaven. They went to the emergency room\nand said a prayer at her body. Chester was overwhelmed by her death. Christine\nhad been the caretaker of the family and home-schooled all three children.\nChester testified that he had difficulty as a single father and sometimes woke up in\n\n\n\n                                         19\n\fthe morning with dry heaves. There were also times that he woke up in the night\nscreaming. According to Chester, he lacked focus at home and at work.\n       Quentin Orciuch testified that after his mother was shot and he was allowed\ninto the credit union, he tried to page his father, but he was crying too hard. He\ntried to run outside to see his mother, but was stopped. Eventually, a fireman\ndrove him to the hospital where he waited for his father and sisters to arrive. After\nthey arrived, his father told him his mother had died. He was devastated.\nAccording to Quentin, everything was difficult after his mother‟s death. He thinks\nabout her every day and spent approximately one and one-half years in counseling\nafter her death.\n\n                   e. March 1998 attempted escape and carjacking\n       Defendant and Bowen were held in custody in the Santa Barbara County\njail after their arrest for the Vandenberg Federal Credit Union robbery. On a\nmorning in mid-March 1998, they escaped with another inmate from the jail\nexercise yard. According to witnesses, the three African-American male inmates\nwere seen walking down the hill from the jail to a parking lot, where they\nsurrounded Matilde Ulrich‟s car. One of the inmates pulled Ulrich from her car,\nwhile defendant got in on the passenger side and pushed Ulrich out. The inmates\ndrove off in Ulrich‟s car, which was spotted by a sheriff‟s deputy a short time later\nand was chased by the California Highway Patrol. A spike strip was used to stop\nthe car. Defendant, Bowen, and the third inmate were captured without further\nincident.\n\n                   f. Acts of force or violence or threats of force or violence while in\n                       custody\n       Witnesses testified concerning 12 different incidents involving defendant‟s\nuse of force or violence, or threats of force or violence during the periods of time\nthat he was held in custody as follows.\n\n\n                                             20\n\f       Defendant and Antoine Phillips were both in custody at Avenal State Prison\nin March 1994. The men were members of different Bloods gangs. Defendant\nstarted an argument with Phillips regarding the murder of one of defendant‟s\n“homegirls” by a member of Phillips‟s gang and they agreed to fight. A few\nweeks later, Phillips was lying on the grass of the prison yard when defendant\nwalked up and kicked him in the mouth. Later that evening the two men fought\nand defendant broke Phillips‟s jaw.\n       In November 1997, Sheriff‟s Deputy Brian Parker was conducting a\nsecurity check at the Santa Barbara County jail. Parker told defendant to remove\nseveral items that defendant had secured into his cell wall in violation of jail rules.\nDefendant became verbally abusive and challenged him to enter the cell and fight.\n       In November 1998, while he was in a holding cell at the Santa Maria\ncourthouse, defendant broke a plastic coat hanger that had been used for his\ncivilian clothes, took a large piece and began sharpening it to a point on the\nconcrete floor. Defendant hid the other pieces of the coat hanger in clothing in the\ncorner of the cell. Deputies entered the cell and took from defendant the\nsharpened piece of plastic, as well as the hidden pieces.\n       In September 2000, while he was being held in the Los Angeles County\njail, defendant became upset when he was told that the nurse did not have his\nmedication. Sheriff‟s Deputy Phillips directed defendant to calm down.\nDefendant challenged Phillips and two other deputies to enter his cell and fight\nhim, threatening to harm them.\n       In February 2001, defendant was housed on the disciplinary row in the Los\nAngeles County jail. Defendant handed Sheriff‟s Deputy John Hermann a note\nand told him to post it in the guard booth so that everyone could see it. Defendant\nspecifically said that he wanted Deputy Lindenmayer to see it. The note consisted\nof a cartoon drawing of stick figures, which depicted defendant announcing his\n\n                                          21\n\fgang membership, beating up Lindenmayer, and Lindenmayer lying on the ground\ndead. Both Lindenmayer and Hermann took the note as a threat to Lindenmayer.\n       In July 2001, Sheriff‟s Deputy Charles Nowotny searched defendant‟s cell\nin the Los Angeles County jail and found a handmade “club” in a manila envelope\nin defendant‟s personal property. The club consisted of a tightly rolled-up\nnewspaper with a torn white sheet wrapped around it to form a handle. This was a\ncontraband item that could be used as a weapon.\n       In September 2001, sheriff‟s deputies were escorting defendant from the\nmedical clinic to his single cell in a lockdown module of the Los Angeles County\njail. When they arrived at defendant‟s cell, defendant saw a third deputy removing\nseveral gang photographs from his cell. Defendant began cursing and refused to\nenter his cell until his photographs were returned. Eventually defendant was\nconvinced to go back inside his cell. However, while the deputies were removing\ndefendant‟s handcuffs and waist chain, defendant pulled the chain into the cell and\nbegan swinging it, hitting the door and walls. Defendant yelled that he was “going\nto tear this place apart,” and, “If I get out of here, I am going to tear you apart,\ntoo.” The deputies were able to close the gate and secure the latch so that\ndefendant could not hit them with the chain. It took approximately one hour to\ntalk defendant into handing over the chain. During this time, defendant was\ncursing and threatening people.\n       Not quite three weeks later, sheriff‟s deputies approached defendant‟s cell\nin the Los Angeles County jail to provide defendant with his dinner. When\ndefendant‟s food was passed through the food tray slot, defendant refused the food\nand threw a white watery liquid at Sheriff‟s Deputy Alejandro Martinez, saying,\n“Take that, fuckin‟ deputy.” The liquid landed on Martinez‟s face and upper\nbody. Sheriff‟s Deputy James Brown sprayed pepper spray into the cell so that the\nfood slot could be closed. As the slot was being closed, defendant threw more of\n\n                                           22\n\fthe liquid at Brown, which landed on Brown‟s face and upper body. When\nMartinez sprayed additional pepper spray into the cell, defendant loudly said,\n“You fucking bitches,” and attempted to throw more liquid at the deputies.\nMartinez testified that he did not know what the liquid was, but it might have\ncome from a milk container. Martinez explained that when an inmate throws\nsomething at an officer, it is commonly called “gassing.”\n       In February 2002, defendant complained to Sheriff‟s Deputy Martinez at\nthe Los Angeles County jail that Deputy Valente kept “fucking with [him] and\nsaid that [he was] going to get him.” Defendant gave Martinez a note that he\nwanted given to the floor supervisor. The note said, “I give you my word as a man\nthat I will slice or stab this guy the first chance I get.” Martinez understood the\nnote to refer to Valente. After giving Martinez the note, defendant said he would\n“gas” a deputy if he were given the chance.\n       In June 2002, when defendant was housed in the Los Angeles County jail‟s\n“high power” module, a jail inmate trustee, Douglas Lance, was picking up trash\nand food trays along the walkway in the cell block. As Lance picked up a trash\nbag attached to defendant‟s cell, defendant reached through the bars with his left\nhand and swiped across the right side of Lance‟s neck. Lance cried out in pain\nand called for help. As Sheriff‟s Deputy Damien Ortega responded, Ortega heard\nthe toilet flush in defendant‟s cell. Lance told Ortega that defendant had cut him.\nLance had a two-and-one-half inch laceration from under his ear to the front part\nof his neck. The laceration was about one-quarter inch deep and was bleeding\nprofusely. Lance was taken to the medical clinic, and subsequently transferred to\nan emergency room for treatment. When Ortega saw Lance two weeks later, he\nnoticed a sizeable scar on Lance‟s neck.\n       In January 2003, Sheriff‟s Deputy Mat Taylor was sitting in the control\nbooth at the Los Angeles County jail when he heard a loud thud against the\n\n                                           23\n\fconcrete wall of one of the rows of cells. Taylor looked down the row and\ninitially saw nothing. But when he heard noises sounding like an assault, Taylor\nstood up and saw defendant on top of another inmate, Richard Aguirre. Only\nAguirre was supposed to be out of his cell; defendant had escaped from his cell.\nDefendant was savagely striking Aguirre, who was curled up in a ball, and blood\nwas “flying everywhere.” When Taylor saw that each of defendant‟s blows was\ncreating an injury that produced blood, he knew that a jail-made shank was\ninvolved. Taylor and his partner went down the row to break up the fight. Taylor\npepper-sprayed defendant and Aguirre, but defendant continued to hit Aguirre. As\nadditional deputies arrived, defendant ran back to his cell.\n       Taylor did not find any weapons on Aguirre, who was covered in blood.\nHis clothing had multiple slash marks. Aguirre was taken to the medical clinic\nand then transferred to a hospital trauma center. Sometime after the incident,\ndefendant told Taylor that he wished he had “finished the job” on Aguirre and that\nhe should have done the job right the first time. Aguirre was a “validated”\nassociate of the Mexican Mafia, which is a large Hispanic prison gang.\n       In March 2003, Sheriff‟s Deputy Thomas Davis searched defendant at the\nLos Angeles County jail before he was brought to court. Inmates in defendant‟s\nmodule were segregated so that they did not come into contact with other inmates\nand Davis was looking for, among other things, any notes that could be passed to\nother inmates during their transportation to court. During his search, Davis found\na handwritten note at the bottom of a page of transcript. The note read, “Breezo is\na rat . . . . Breezo and Marlo need to die.” It was signed with defendant‟s gang\nmoniker and other gang terms. According to Lompoc Police Officer Harry Heidt,\nwho had been assigned to investigate the 1997 robbery and murder at the\nVandenberg Federal Credit Union, the transcript on which the note was written\nwas of a telephone conversation Heidt had in December 1997 with Sabrina\n\n                                         24\n\fJohnson, known as “Breezo,” regarding the conversation that had taken place at\nher apartment between defendant, Bowen, and Fennelle. (Fennelle had testified\nthat the conversation concerned defendant and Bowen‟s plan to commit an armed\nbank robbery.) Heidt understood the term “rat” to refer to an informant or\n“snitch” and believed that the writer of the note wanted to have Johnson killed.\n       Defendant‟s mail was monitored while he was in the Los Angeles County\njail. Several letters were confiscated. In those letters, defendant referenced his\nrobbery of a credit union, his cutting of a “white boy with a razor blade in the\nface” while in custody, and his serious cutting and beating of “a Mexican” in\nJanuary 2003 while in lockup.\n\n           2. Evidence submitted in aggravation under factor (c) of section 190.3\n       In September 1993, defendant was convicted of discharging a firearm with\ngross negligence. (§ 246.3.) He received a sentence of 16 months in prison.\nDefendant was paroled one year later, on September 3, 1994 — four days before\nthe murders of Hicks, Boyd, and Armstrong.\n\n           3. Aggravating evidence of victim impact\n\n               a. Dayland Hicks\n       Dayland Hicks was 22 years old when he was killed. His uncle, Gregory\nShoaf, testified that Hicks was respectful, quiet, good-natured, and “very lovable.”\nHe liked to play basketball, football, and video games. He enjoyed dancing,\nrapping, singing, and going to church. He was learning the Bible and taking “his\nlife in that direction.” Shoaf believed Hicks was on the right path, but never had\nthe chance to straighten his life out. Shoaf loved Hicks like his own son. Shoaf\nwas in shock when he received the news that Hicks had been killed. The hardest\nthing Shoaf had to do was tell Hicks‟s sister Jamise that her brother was dead.\nHicks and Jamise were very close and Jamise had no family left after Hicks‟s\n\n\n\n                                         25\n\fdeath, other than Shoaf and his family, because her mother and father had both\ndied earlier. Shoaf testified that he thought about Hicks every day and missed his\nsmile and the things they did together. Shoaf tried to look out for Hicks‟s son,\nwho was four or five months old when Hicks was shot, but he knew he would\nnever replace Hicks. Hicks‟s death also “took a toll” on his grandmother.\n       Jamise Shoaf testified that she was nine years old when her brother was\nkilled. She cried when she was told of his death and it left her with an empty\nfeeling. He was her only sibling, and it was hard to go on without him. She\ntestified that she thought about his death every day. She missed his laugh, his\nsilliness, and watching television with him.\n\n               b. Lamar Armstrong\n       Lamar Armstrong was 19 years old when he was killed. His mother, Doris\nHayes, testified that Armstrong had enjoyed playing football and baseball, running\ntrack, and cooking. He was a good son, worked part time at Home Base, a\nbuilding supply store, and was in the process of getting his GED when he was\nkilled. Doris had difficulty believing Armstrong was actually dead. She could not\nplan the funeral, and she suffered from nightmares. She testified that she missed\neverything about him. Holidays were particularly difficult. Part of her died when\nher son did and she struggled every day.\n       Dan Hayes, Armstrong‟s stepfather, testified that he raised Armstrong from\nthe time he was an infant. He described his stepson as a “good kid,” who enjoyed\nathletics and things that challenged his mind. Dan had “an empty feeling” when\ntold at the hospital that Armstrong had died. He testified that it was very difficult\nto hold his family together after Armstrong‟s death. According to Dan, his wife\nhad “problems” on the anniversary of Armstrong‟s death, on his birthday, and on\nevery holiday. He characterized it as “a nightmare.” He testified that Armstrong‟s\n\n\n\n                                           26\n\ftwo daughters cried on Father‟s Day because they did not understand why they\ncould not see their father. Dan told the jury that he thought about Armstrong\nevery day. His death affected not just the immediate family, but the extended\nfamily.\n       Milika McCoy testified that she was Armstrong‟s girlfriend and was eight\nmonths pregnant when he died. The night before, they had attended a Lamaze\nclass together. Armstrong had just been promoted in his job, was a very nice\nperson, and was excited about McCoy‟s pregnancy. McCoy collapsed when she\nwas told that Armstrong had died after being shot. After his death, she did not\nwant to wake up in the morning. Her daughter, Cherish, was born a little over a\nmonth later. At the time of trial, Cherish was eight years old. She asked about her\nfather “all the time” and had difficulty with not having a “daddy.” McCoy,\nsimilarly, had difficulty raising Cherish by herself. McCoy testified that she\nthought about Armstrong, her best friend, every time she looks at her daughter.\n\n               c. Trevon Boyd\n       Carolyn Boyd, Trevon Boyd‟s mother, testified that Trevon was 20 years\nold when he died. She described him as a beautiful and intelligent person who\nenjoyed writing music, sports, fishing, and dancing. When Carolyn learned of her\nson‟s death, she felt like a part of her was gone. She could not eat or sleep, and it\nwas difficult to make the funeral arrangements. Carolyn missed everything about\nher son. She testified that her family “will never be whole, . . . again.” Holidays\nwere difficult, and she thought about her son every day.\n       Olive Burgess testified that Trevon Boyd was her cousin. According to\nBurgess, Boyd was a “sweet kid” growing up in a rough neighborhood. He meant\neverything to her. His death made her feel numb and the family still cried at night.\nThe hardest thing for Burgess to do after Boyd‟s death was to explain it to her\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\fchildren, who were all close to him. They found it difficult to cope with his death,\nand she missed his smile and thought of him every day.\n\n           4. Mitigating evidence offered by defendant\n       The defense case in mitigation included evidence of defendant‟s family\nhistory and upbringing, as well as opinion testimony by three expert witnesses\nwho described for the jury defendant‟s learning disabilities and his psychological,\nneurological, and intellectual dysfunction. The defense also presented evidence\nthat defendant possessed a genetic condition that, when combined with childhood\nmaltreatment, has been identified as a risk factor for antisocial behavior.\n\n               a. Defendant’s upbringing and background\n       Defendant‟s mother, Pearl Thomas, testified that she had a poor\nrelationship with her own mother and ran away from home when she was 12 years\nold. She got into trouble and was sent to CYA when she was 15. She became a\nsingle mother at the age of 17 when she gave birth to defendant‟s older brother,\nwho became known as “Big Sonny.” Thomas denied drinking alcohol, but\nadmitted being a drug user, and taking barbiturates when defendant was\nconceived. Defendant‟s father was a professional boxer with whom Thomas had a\nshort relationship. Defendant‟s father was a heroin addict and was not\nsignificantly involved in defendant‟s life.\n       When defendant was a toddler, Thomas married Ronald Biggles. He was\nabusive to Thomas and often came home drunk. Biggles favored his own daughter\nover defendant and Big Sonny. He hit defendant. After Thomas left Biggles, she\nlived with James Wright, who disliked and hit defendant. Thomas testified she\nalso hit and whipped defendant because that was the way she was raised. She did\nnot know how to be a good mother.\n\n\n\n\n                                         28\n\f       Thomas supported her family with public welfare assistance and by\nstealing. She estimated that she had been arrested almost 50 times in her life and\nshe was in and out of custody during defendant‟s childhood. When Thomas was\nin prison, defendant sometimes stayed with his grandmother, Amy Parks.\nAccording to Beverly Parks, who was Parks‟s daughter-in-law and defendant‟s\naunt, Parks seemed to hate defendant and his sister Larhonda. She often drank and\nbecame “wild and . . . brutally violent.” Defendant suffered excessive beatings,\nalmost every day, when he was staying in his grandmother‟s house. Parks also\nabused the children by calling them names. One time she scared defendant and\nLarhonda by turning off the lights and following them around with a long knife.\nShe believed in voodoo and performed “curses” on people. She was described as\nbeing “evil” by both Beverly Parks and defendant‟s godmother, Linda Gavin.\nGavin testified that Parks showed her evilness to “anyone she didn‟t like” and she\nparticularly disliked defendant and his sister Larhonda. According to Gavin, Parks\nwould sometimes call on the telephone and tell her to come get “these\nmotherfuckers,” referring to defendant and his sister.\n       Defendant was an energetic and very hyperactive child. He had learning\ndisabilities and was sent to special-needs schools. Defendant was prescribed\nRitalin, but his mother took him off the medication. He was bullied and picked\non, particularly by one member of a local Crips gang. Defendant started getting\ninto trouble at an early age. But one childhood friend of defendant‟s, Reginald\nCampbell, recalled an incident in which defendant jumped into the swimming pool\nand saved him from drowning.\n       Several witnesses (Reginald Campbell, Linda Woods, a neighbor who\nwatched defendant grow up, defendant‟s half sister Ralene, and his aunt Beverly\nParks) testified about the rough neighborhood in which defendant grew up. It was\nfilled with drugs and numerous gangs, which actively recruited members through\n\n                                         29\n\fviolence, including stabbings, carjackings, and shootings. The witnesses\nexplained that to acquire protection in the neighborhood, a person had to join a\ngang. Defendant found protection by joining the Bloods gang to which his\nbrother, Big Sonny, belonged. Big Sonny was a violent person and well known in\nthe neighborhood. Defendant, however, idolized him and saw him as a father\nfigure. Defendant was devastated when Big Sonny was killed in a gang shooting,\nwhich increased his hatred for Crips gang members.\n\n               b. Expert witness testimony in mitigation\n       Dr. Nancy Cowardin, who had a doctorate in educational psychology and\nspecial education, testified as an expert witness regarding learning disabilities.\nShe assessed defendant by reviewing documents regarding his personal\nbackground, meeting with him and giving him current tests of his skills. She\nnoted that defendant started needing remedial help in the first grade or shortly\nthereafter. He attended special-needs schools in grades eight and nine. In eighth\ngrade, his individualized education program (IEP) included a dual diagnosis of\nbeing seriously emotionally disturbed and having learning disabilities with\nattention deficits. Defendant‟s IEP in ninth grade similarly assessed him as being\nseriously emotionally disturbed. According to Cowardin, defendant had a clear\nhistory of attention deficit disorder (ADD). His records from CYA indicated he\nwas very impulsive and lacked sound decisionmaking skills. Cowardin performed\na complete psychoeducational assessment of defendant and concluded his ADD\nwas still present in adulthood, but was more subdued. She found that he had an\nauditory processing problem that could account for his learning disabilities in\nreading and writing at school. As an adult, defendant had improved his reading\nand written language scores, but not his math scores. Defendant‟s IQ was exactly\naverage when verbal and nonverbal scores were combined, but he had large\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\fdeviations in some of the scores. Cowardin found that defendant had lapses in\nmature executive functions that control problem solving, decisionmaking, and\nadaptability under stress in typical adults. She concluded that defendant‟s\ndisability profile may have led to some of his self-control problems.\n       Dr. Arthur Kowell, a specialist in neurology, evaluated defendant‟s brain\nfunction. He interpreted a brain electrical activity mapping study or “BEAM” test\nconducted on defendant in August 2000. Three of the four parts of the test — the\nstandard electroencephalogram, the electroencephalogram spectral analysis, and\nan auditory “evoked potential” test — had normal results. But the visual evoked\npotential test showed some abnormal functioning of defendant‟s brain in the\nvertex, the right parietal region, and the right frontal region. The vertex deals with\nmotor behavior and initiation of activity. The right parietal region deals with\nsensory functions and the right frontal lobe deals with impulse control and\nexecutive functions. An abnormality in this last area might indicate the individual\nhas a short temper or possibly a form of ADD. Kowell testified that the test was\nnonspecific as to the time of onset and the causation for any abnormality shown\nand that the test was not predictive of behavior. But Kowell concluded the test\nshowed evidence of brain dysfunction.\n       Dr. Kowell reviewed defendant‟s medical records, which included two\npositron emission tomography (PET) scans and a magnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI) scan of defendant‟s brain. The results of a 1998 PET scan showed\nabnormalities, while the results of a followup MRI and a second PET scan in 2000\nwere normal. Kowell did not consider the latter tests to be inconsistent with his\nresults. He testified that a neuropsychological workup done by Dr. Kyle Boone in\n2002, which he reviewed, showed abnormalities consistent with Kowell‟s testing.\nKowell noted Boone‟s opinion that defendant‟s decisionmaking skills were\ncomparable to those of someone with mental retardation or borderline intelligence,\n\n                                         31\n\fdespite defendant‟s otherwise normal intelligence. Kowell stated that, according\nto Boone, defendant may lack the essential brain equipment to exert reasoned\ncontrol over his behavior. Kowell also reviewed defendant‟s academic records,\nmental health records, and court records. He considered the historical evidence\nfrom defendant‟s records to be consistent with his finding of abnormal brain\nfunction in defendant.\n          Dr. Carl Osborn, a forensic psychologist, testified that scientific studies had\nshown that childhood abuse and neglect, i.e., maltreatment, alters the brain\nchemistry and functioning in ways that can produce aggressive behavior and that\nthese changes will persist into adulthood. According to Osborn, it had recently\nbeen shown that there is a powerful association with severe antisocial behavior\nlater in life when childhood maltreatment combines with the presence of an\ninherited type of gene, the 3-repeat allele MAOA gene. Genetic testing of\ndefendant showed that he had inherited the 3-repeat allele MAOA gene and, in\nOsborn‟s opinion, defendant had been severely maltreated as a child. Osborne\ntestified that the 3 repeat allele MAOA gene is not a genetic defect, but is a risk\nfactor.\n\n                                     II. DISCUSSION\n\n          A. Guilt Phase Issues\n\n              1. Background regarding “witness intimidation” comments by the\n                  prosecutor, evidence, and related jury instruction\n          Dyer and Meeks were eyewitnesses to defendant‟s shooting of Hicks,\nArmstrong, and Boyd. But neither Dyer nor Meeks immediately identified\ndefendant to the police as the shooter. Both refused to cooperate with law\nenforcement at various points in time and told investigators that they could not\nidentify the shooter. In his guilt phase opening statement, the prosecutor\nacknowledged that the case had taken a long time to come to trial, but told the jury\n\n\n                                            32\n\fthat the explanation would lie in the evidence of “threats,” “fear,” and\n“intimidation” of the witnesses, which would explain their reluctance to come\nforward and speak with police. The prosecutor referred to there being in the case a\n“theme” of such threats, intimidation, and fear.\n       The prosecutor elaborated that Dyer was himself a gang member, that he\ninitially did not want to get involved, and that he came forward and identified\ndefendant as the shooter only at the urging of the victims‟ family members. The\nprosecutor explained that when Dyer was subsequently asked to identify defendant\nat a lineup, Dyer was being held in custody with defendant and knew that it was\nvery dangerous to testify against another inmate. The prosecutor said that Dyer\nwas frightened and then intimidated when he encountered defendant and was told\nby him that defendant had a relative who was a deputy sheriff. According to the\nprosecutor, Dyer did not identify defendant in the 1995 lineup and later told lies to\nthe defense investigator because of his fear. The prosecutor told the jury that\nyears later, when the investigation was reopened, Dyer “felt bad‟ about not\nidentifying defendant in 1995 because “the victims were friends of his.” Dyer\nrevealed to prosecution investigators that he had been threatened and that the\nthreats and intimidation he felt were the reasons for his earlier refusal to identify\ndefendant.\n       Continuing his opening statement, the prosecutor told the jury that Meeks\nwas very afraid back in 1994 and 1995, consuming a lot of drugs, and hence\nreluctant to talk to the police. She did not want to get involved, and did not want\nto get Dyer involved. But, the prosecutor explained, Meeks also had a change of\nheart. She had been sent to prison on a drug charge and while she was in prison,\nshe turned her life “completely around.” According to the prosecutor, Meeks\nexplained to investigating detectives that she felt she had “to do the right thing”\nand that she knew who the shooter was because he had been just a few feet away\n\n                                          33\n\ffrom her. She told investigators that in the past she had been afraid to identify\ndefendant for several reasons. The prosecutor explained those reasons as follows:\n“[Meeks‟s] family had been threatened back in 1994 and 1995. They had found\nout — someone had found out her address of her cousin and where her cousin\nlived and they received phone calls, and it was made quite clear to her that she\n[should] not say anything when she went to court. And she kept that promise until\nshe went to prison, got off drugs and got back straightening her life up, and now\nshe has indicated the identification of the defendant.”\n       The prosecutor further told the jury that “this concept of fear and\nretaliation” would also come up with respect to other witnesses. He proceeded to\nvery briefly describe the anticipated testimony of Johnson and Fennelle. The\nprosecutor then warned the jurors that they might see witnesses who might not\nwant to testify and who were very afraid to testify, but suggested it was “in the\nnature of these types of cases.”\n\n           2. Defendant’s claims\n       Defendant complains on appeal that the prosecutor, by these comments,\n“poisoned” the jury against a fair assessment of his defense that these witnesses\nwere not credible. He contends that the prosecutor impermissibly vouched for\nDyer and Meeks when he described their change of heart. And, he argues, the\nprosecutor‟s accusations, express and implied, that defendant was involved in this\ncampaign of intimidation were prejudicial because they were never substantiated.\nEmbedded in his claims regarding the prosecutor‟s opening statement are\ncontentions regarding the admissibility of the witness intimidation evidence, the\ntrial court‟s related consciousness of guilt instruction, and the prosecution‟s\nclosing argument. By his failure to object and raise the claims he now asserts,\n\n\n\n\n                                          34\n\fdefendant forfeited his contentions on appeal. As we explain, they are meritless in\nany event.\n       Most of defendant‟s claims assert prosecutorial misconduct. The principles\nof law applicable to a defendant‟s claims of prosecutorial misconduct are well\nsettled. “ „ “A prosecutor‟s conduct violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the\nfederal Constitution when it infects the trial with such unfairness as to make the\nconviction a denial of due process. Conduct by a prosecutor that does not render a\ncriminal trial fundamentally unfair is prosecutorial misconduct under state law\nonly if it involves the use of deceptive or reprehensible methods to attempt to\npersuade either the trial court or the jury.” [Citation.] When a claim of\nmisconduct is based on the prosecutor‟s comments before the jury, as all of\ndefendant‟s claims are, “ „the question is whether there is a reasonable likelihood\nthat the jury construed or applied any of the complained-of remarks in an\nobjectionable fashion.‟ ” [Citation.] To preserve a claim of prosecutorial\nmisconduct for appeal, a defendant must make a timely and specific objection and\nask the trial court to admonish the jury to disregard the improper argument.\n[Citation.]‟ [Citation.] A failure to timely object and request an admonition will\nbe excused if doing either would have been futile, or if an admonition would not\nhave cured the harm.” (People v. Linton (2013) 56 Cal.4th 1146, 1205.)\n       As the Attorney General notes, defendant never objected at trial to any of\nthe prosecutor‟s comments that he now asserts are prejudicial. Nothing suggests\nan objection would have been futile or an admonition inadequate to cure any harm.\nThus, his claim of misconduct during the opening statement is forfeited. (People\nv. Tully (2012) 54 Cal.4th 952, 1011.)\n       Moreover, the comments were not improper. “The function of an opening\nstatement is not only to inform the jury of the expected evidence, but also to\nprepare the jurors to follow the evidence and more readily discern its materiality,\n\n                                         35\n\fforce, and meaning.” (People v. Dennis (1998) 17 Cal.4th 468, 518.) Here, the\nprosecutor‟s statements sought to prepare the jurors for the anticipated testimony\nof Dyer, Meeks, Johnson, and Fennelle and to offer in advance a possible\nexplanation for their long delay in cooperating with law enforcement, their\ninconsistent statements to investigators, and any current reluctance to testify.\n       We do not agree with defendant‟s claim that the prosecutor failed to state\nthe facts correctly or that his comments were unsubstantiated by the evidence\nadmitted at trial. Dyer testified that he failed to immediately identify defendant as\nthe shooter because Dyer was himself a gang member and a gang member would\nbe labeled a “snitch” if he spoke to the police about a gang-related crime, even if\nthe crime was committed by a rival gang against the member‟s own gang. Dyer\ntestified that he was afraid to talk to the police about the shooting, and did not\nwant to get involved, because people — inferentially other gang members —\nwould try to hurt him. Defendant concedes that this testimony was admissible.\n       Dyer testified that he changed his mind about keeping silent after several\nfamily members of Hicks and Boyd convinced him to tell the police what he knew\nabout the killing of his friends. He identified defendant as the shooter in a\nphotographic lineup at that time. But he was subsequently taken into custody and\nheld in the same facility as defendant. Dyer testified that because he was afraid of\nwhat could happen to him in jail if he was labeled a snitch, he did not identify\ndefendant when he was asked to view a live lineup. He testified that he was later\ntaken by a sheriff‟s deputy, whom defendant identified as his cousin, to an office\nwhere defendant was waiting. Defendant had a copy of Dyer‟s earlier interview\nstatement to police identifying defendant as the shooter, which defendant showed\nto Dyer. According to Dyer, defendant told him not to say anything and offered to\narrange for Dyer to be transferred to a safe facility as long as Dyer did not identify\ndefendant as the shooter. Dyer told defendant he had not identified him in the live\n\n                                          36\n\flineup and assured defendant he did not intend to “tell on [him].” Dyer testified\nthat he was concerned that if his interview statement “[got] around the jail” he\ncould be hurt or killed and he knew he could not cooperate with the prosecution\nonce he was incarcerated. According to Dyer, he received threats both before and\nafter the lineup. During the time he remained in custody, including the time he\nspent at a CYA facility, Dyer continued to deny knowledge of the shooting.\n       Defendant did not object to the admission of Dyer‟s testimony, which in\nany event was properly admitted at trial. “As we have recognized, „[e]vidence that\na witness is afraid to testify or fears retaliation for testifying is relevant to the\ncredibility of that witness and is therefore admissible. [Citations.] An explanation\nof the basis for the witness‟s fear is likewise relevant to [his] credibility and is\nwell within the discretion of the trial court. [Citations.]‟ ” (People v. Mendoza\n(2011) 52 Cal.4th 1056, 1084.) Dyer‟s testimony substantiated the prosecutor‟s\nopening comments.\n       Defendant claims, however, that the prosecutor‟s comments were\ninaccurate and prejudicial because Dyer never testified that he was intimidated by\ndefendant before he failed to identify defendant in the live lineup, and in\ndefendant‟s view, any fear Dyer felt was not due to defendant‟s action or any\naction authorized by him. It was unnecessary, however, for Dyer‟s fear to be\ndirectly linked to defendant in order for it to be admitted for purposes of assisting\nthe jury in determining his credibility. (People v. Williams (2013) 58 Cal.4th 197,\n270; People v. Mendoza, supra, 52 Cal.4th at p. 1087.) We find People v. Hannon\n(1977) 19 Cal.3d 588 and People v. Weiss (1958) 50 Cal.2d 535, on which\ndefendant relies, to be distinguishable on this ground. (People v. Abel (2012) 53\nCal.4th 891, 924-925.)\n       Furthermore, although it appears that Dyer‟s fear was partially due to the\ngeneral risk of gang retaliation and retribution from other inmates if he cooperated\n\n                                            37\n\fwith law enforcement and identified defendant as the shooter, Dyer also testified\nthat he was intimidated and frightened by defendant directly. Specifically, Dyer\ntestified that he was brought by a sheriff‟s deputy, whom defendant identified as\nhis cousin, to an office in the jail to meet with defendant. Dyer testified that\ndefendant had in his possession and showed Dyer a copy of Dyer‟s previous\ninterview statement to police. Defendant then offered to arrange a transfer for\nDyer to a safe facility if Dyer continued to keep silent about what he witnessed.\nImplied in this encounter was a threat by defendant to publicize Dyer‟s police\ninterview statement to the inmate population, thereby labeling him as a snitch, if\nDyer did not maintain his silence. Defendant‟s actions and comments also\nemphasized to Dyer the risk of any return to cooperation with law enforcement\nand intimated that he (defendant) had power over Dyer‟s movements, housing and\nsafety while Dyer was in custody. Contrary to defendant‟s claim, the jury could\ndetermine from Dyer‟s testimony that defendant successfully intimidated and\nfrightened Dyer. Defendant‟s direct involvement in persuading Dyer of the risk of\nbeing a witness distinguishes the circumstances of this case from Dudley v.\nDuckworth (7th Cir. 1988) 854 F.2d 967, on which defendant relies because\nDudley involved third party threats unconnected to the defendant. (See People v.\nWilliams (1997) 16 Cal.4th 153, 212.) In anticipation of Dyer‟s admissible\ntestimony, the prosecutor‟s opening statement did not improperly connect\ndefendant to Dyer‟s fear.\n       In a related claim, defendant complains of the prosecutor‟s closing\nargument referencing defendant‟s threats and intimidation of Dyer in jail and\nDyer‟s fear of retaliation while he was being held in custody. His failure to object\nforfeited his claim, which is also meritless. Because the evidence was properly\nadmitted, the prosecutor‟s closing argument constituted fair comment on the\n\n\n\n                                          38\n\fevidence and fell within the permissible bounds of argument. (People v. Williams\n(2013) 56 Cal.4th 630, 674.)\n       We likewise reject defendant‟s further related contention that his right to\ndue process was violated when the trial court instructed the jury with the\nconsciousness of guilt instruction, CALJIC No. 2.06. The testimony of Dyer\nregarding his meeting with defendant in jail supported the use of CALJIC\nNo. 2.06, which informed the jury that if it found defendant attempted to suppress\nevidence against himself, “such as by the intimidation of a witness,” it could\nconsider that as a circumstance tending to show consciousness of guilt.\n       We also find no impropriety in the prosecutor‟s opening comments\nregarding Meeks. Defendant did not object to the evidence that Meeks was afraid\nto cooperate with police because of her concern for her own and her family‟s\nsafety. Like the testimony of Dyer, her testimony was admissible in any event\nbecause it was relevant to her credibility. Again, contrary to defendant‟s\nargument, it was unnecessary for the prosecution to establish that defendant was\nconnected to the phone call to Meeks‟s family warning Meeks to keep silent in\norder for Meeks‟s testimony concerning the phone call to be admissible. (People\nv. Williams, supra, 58 Cal.4th at p. 270; People v. Mendoza, supra, 52 Cal.4th at\np. 1087.) Because the prosecutor could in good faith anticipate the admission of\nsupporting testimony, the prosecutor was entitled to comment in his opening\nstatement on Meeks‟s fear of retaliation.\n       We reject defendant‟s additional claim that the prosecutor impermissibly\nvouched for the credibility of Dyer and Meeks in his opening statement by\nasserting that they “had” changed their lives, instead of stating that they “claimed”\nto have changed their lives. The prosecutor‟s comments appropriately anticipated\nthe testimony of Dyer and Meeks and there is no reasonable likelihood that the\njury would have understood the comments as vouching for these witnesses‟\n\n                                         39\n\fcredibility based on the prosecutor‟s personal belief. (People v. Martinez (2010)\n47 Cal.4th 911, 958 [a prosecutor “may not vouch for the credibility of a witness\nbased on personal belief or by referring to evidence outside the record”].)\n       In another challenge to the prosecution‟s use of evidence of witness\nintimidation and fear of retaliation, defendant contends that the trial court erred in\nadmitting evidence that special precautions had been taken to protect witnesses\nJohnson and Fennell during and after defendant‟s trial because there was no\nevidence defendant was threatening or intimidating them. Defendant failed,\nhowever, to object on this ground, which would properly have been overruled in\nany case. Johnson and Fennelle, both former gang members who were\nincarcerated at the time of trial, agreed to testify against defendant, their former\nfriend and fellow gang member. Their willingness to do so despite a legitimate\nbasis for concern about their safety enhanced their credibility. (People v. Green\n(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 20; see People v. Verdugo (2010) 50 Cal.4th 263, 285.)\nAgain, there was no need for evidence directly linking defendant to the\nprosecution‟s concern for their safety in order to establish admissibility. (People\nv. Williams, supra, 58 Cal.4th at p. 270; People v. Mendoza, supra, 52 Cal.4th at\np. 1087.)\n       Defendant has failed to show any error in the prosecution‟s introduction of\nand comment on evidence of witness intimidation and fear of retaliation. Nor was\nthere any instructional error related to such evidence.\n\n       B. Penalty Phase Issues\n\n            1. Admission of victim impact testimony relating to aggravating\n                evidence of uncharged crimes\n       Over defense objection, a number of the victims of the uncharged robberies\ncommitted by defendant and his companions were allowed to testify regarding the\nimpact of those crimes on their lives. Melissa Lopez testified to the traumatic\n\n\n                                          40\n\feffect on her of the robbery of the Pacific Marine Credit Union. Jasper Altheide\nand Moira Philley, two of the tellers at the Vandenberg Federal Credit Union,\ntestified to the continuing negative impacts on their lives, not only from the\nrobbery but also from witnessing the killing of Christine Orciuch. In addition to\nthe robbery victims, Orciuch‟s son Quentin testified to the painful effects on him\ncaused by his mother‟s sudden death at the credit union. Orciuch‟s husband\nChester likewise testified about the suffering he and his family experienced as a\nresult of his wife‟s death. He described the difficulties he faced as a single parent\nand the residual emotional effect on him of her death.\n       Defendant recognizes that we have held that victim impact evidence related\nto a defendant‟s uncharged crimes is admissible under section 190.3, factor (b).\n(People v. Brady (2010) 50 Cal.4th 547, 581-582; People v. Bramit (2009) 46\nCal.4th 1221, 1241; People v. Demetrulias (2006) 39 Cal.4th 1, 39.) He asks us,\nhowever, to revisit the issue in light of Payne v. Tennessee (1991) 501 U.S. 808.\nDefendant fails to persuade us that there is reason to do so. “Under Payne, victim\nimpact testimony is unconstitutional when it is „so unduly prejudicial that it\nrenders the trial fundamentally unfair . . . .‟ ” (People v. Montes (2014) 58 Cal.4th\n809, 884.) The circumstances of defendant‟s uncharged violent criminal conduct,\nincluding its direct impact on the victims of that conduct, was relevant to the\njury‟s penalty determination and its admission did not render defendant‟s trial\nconstitutionally unfair.\n\n           2. Alleged prosecutorial misconduct in penalty phase closing\n               arguments\n       Defendant contends the prosecutor committed prejudicial misconduct\nduring his closing argument in the penalty phase by (1) suggesting that the\ntestimony of Beverly Parks regarding the childhood abuse of defendant by his\ngrandmother was unreliable because defendant‟s sisters did not testify and confirm\n\n\n                                         41\n\fsuch abuse, and (2) arguing that a verdict of life without the possibility of parole\nwould reward defendant with a “freebie” for Orciuch‟s death and the other\naggravating crimes. We reject defendant‟s claims.\n       We earlier set forth the applicable standard of review for claims of\nprosecutorial misconduct at the guilt phase. (See ante, pt. II.A.2.) The same\nstandard applies to asserted misconduct at the penalty phase. (People v. Lopez\n(2013) 56 Cal.4th 1028, 1075.)\n\n               a. Prosecutor’s argument regarding defendant’s mitigating\n                   evidence of childhood abuse by his grandmother\n       Defendant presented evidence in mitigation that when he stayed as a child\nwith his maternal grandmother, Amy Parks, he was verbally and physically abused\nby her. During closing argument, the prosecutor told the jury that he found it\ninteresting that defendant‟s aunt, Beverly Parks, was the only person in the\nhousehold who came into court to testify that the grandmother beat defendant.\nThe prosecutor argued that Beverly Parks was a woman “who [did not] like the\ngrandmother to begin with” and that she was, therefore, “somewhat of a suspect\nwitness.” The prosecutor asked the jury to consider her demeanor during her\ntestimony and asserted that “[s]he testified to a few things that she didn‟t even\nobserve, that she had heard, but you saw her answers, so you have to weigh how\nmuch that evidence really means and you also have to consider the fact that no one\nelse from that household — her daughters, Mrs. Parks‟s daughters didn‟t testify\nand they were there. Jimmy Parks, her husband, didn‟t testify, and he could have\ntestified that the grandmother beat on defendant, nor did any of the defendant‟s\nsisters testify that the grandmother mistreated the defendant.” Acknowledging\nthat it was up to the jury to evaluate the testimony, the prosecutor explained he\nwas pointing this out “because I think there is a certain suspicion you should have\n\n\n\n\n                                          42\n\fregarding that testimony, especially in light of all the other witnesses that could\nhave testified.” Defendant did not object to any of these comments.\n       After the jury reached a verdict of death, defendant filed a motion for a new\npenalty phase trial. He contended, in part, that he was entitled to a new trial\nbecause the prosecutor argued that defendant‟s sisters failed to corroborate the\ntestimony of Beverly Parks when in fact the prosecutor was in possession of\nreports of interviews that defendant‟s sisters gave to defense investigators, which\nverified the abuse of defendant by their grandmother. Copies of the reports were\nattached to the motion and at the hearing on the motion, the prosecutor stipulated\nthat the reports were received by his office as part of discovery. The trial court\ndenied the new trial motion, concluding that any error that may have occurred in\nthe prosecutor‟s argument would not have affected the outcome of the case in light\nof the circumstances of the crimes and the additional evidence in aggravation.\n       Defendant now reasserts his contention that the prosecutor committed\nprejudicial misconduct by knowingly arguing a false inference that defendant‟s\nsisters would not have confirmed their grandmother‟s abuse of defendant had they\ntestified. He relies on, among other cases, Berger v. United States (1935) 295 U.S.\n78, 88, People v. Hill (1998) 17 Cal.4th 800, 829, and United States v. Blueford\n(9th Cir. 2002) 312 F.3d 962. Defendant claims that the prosecutor‟s comments\npurported to tell the jury why these sisters were not called as witnesses by the\ndefense and what their testimony would have been, thereby depriving defendant of\nhis Sixth Amendment right to confront and cross-examine witnesses. (People v.\nGaines (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 821, 825.)\n       Defendant failed to object and request an admonition regarding these\ncomments at trial. Nothing in the record suggests that an objection would have\nbeen futile or that an admonition would have failed to cure any harm. We\nconclude, therefore, that defendant forfeited his challenges to these comments.\n\n                                          43\n\f(People v. Linton, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 1205; People v. D’Arcy (2010) 48\nCal.4th 257, 289-290 [the failure to object on the basis of the 6th Amend. forfeits\nthe constitutional objection].)\n       Moreover, we agree with the trial court that it is not necessary to determine\nwhether the prosecutor‟s comments were improper because even assuming, solely\nfor purposes of argument, that they were, defendant was not prejudiced thereby.\nFirst, there was other evidence that tended to bolster Beverly Parks‟s credibility,\ndiminishing the likelihood that the jury would discount her testimony on the\ngrounds suggested by the prosecutor. Specifically, defendant‟s godmother\ntestified about the grandmother‟s “evilness” and corroborated Beverly Parks‟s\ndescription of the grandmother‟s verbal abuse of defendant and his sister\nLarhonda. Second, defendant submitted evidence of other serious physical\nmistreatment that he received during childhood at the hands of his mother, his\nmother‟s husband and his mother‟s boyfriend. And finally, the circumstances of\nthe triple murder were egregious and the additional evidence in aggravation was\nextensive. In light of the totality of the evidence before the jury, we agree with the\ntrial court that there was no reasonable possibility the jury would have reached a\nmore favorable verdict in the absence of this argument. (People v. Gonzales\n(2011) 51 Cal.4th 894, 953 [the reasonable possibility standard of prejudice\napplies to the evaluation of the effect of improper argument at the penalty phase].)\n\n                b. Prosecutor’s argument that murder of Orciuch would be a\n                    “freebie” if the jury did not return a verdict of death\n       Defendant contends that the prosecutor committed prejudicial misconduct\nin the penalty phase by arguing that a death verdict was required in order to punish\ndefendant for the murder of Christine Orciuch during the Vandenberg Federal\nCredit Union robbery, and that a verdict of life without the possibility of parole\nwould reward defendant with a “freebie” for Orciuch‟s death and the other\n\n\n                                         44\n\faggravating crimes. Defendant asserts that aggravating evidence of a defendant‟s\nother violent conduct is admitted under section 190.3, factor (b), not to punish the\ndefendant for the factor (b) conduct, but to help the jury determine the appropriate\npenalty for the special circumstance murder. Moreover, he alleges, the prosecutor\nknew it was false to imply defendant would escape punishment for the murder of\nOrciuch because the prosecutor was aware that defendant had been convicted of\nthat crime and received a sentence of life without the possibility of parole. Some\nadditional background is necessary to properly consider defendant‟s contentions.\n       The prosecutor started his closing remarks with an overview of the penalty\nissue before the jury. The prosecutor then discussed his view of the statutory\nmitigating factors, which he contended were either inapplicable or lacked\npersuasive support. Moving on to the aggravating factors, the prosecutor started\nwith section 190.3, factor (a), emphasizing how horrible were the execution-style\nmurders committed by defendant. He noted that once defendant murdered Hicks\nand Boyd, the penalty that defendant faced was either life in prison without the\npossibility of parole or the death penalty. The prosecutor characterized a sentence\nof life without the possibility of parole as the minimum sentence and urged the\njury to reach a death verdict, contending that the circumstances of the killing of\nHicks and Boyd were in themselves “substantial enough to outweigh the\nmitigating factors.” The prosecutor argued that if, however, the jury determined\nthat the circumstances of the two murders were not enough to warrant a death\nsentence, there was the third murder to consider. The prosecutor contended that\ndefendant deserved additional punishment for Armstrong‟s murder and asked the\njury not to treat Armstrong‟s murder as “a freebie.”\n       The prosecutor then turned to discuss defendant‟s attempted murder of\nHernandez and carjacking of Gonzalez, arguing that if the jury was not convinced\n\n\n\n                                         45\n\fdefendant deserved the death penalty for the three earlier murders, these additional\ncrimes justified a death verdict.\n       The prosecutor next reviewed the evidence of defendant‟s felony conviction\nand his other violent crimes, including the two credit union robberies, emphasizing\nthat defendant repeatedly engaged in criminal conduct when he was incarcerated\nand soon after each time he was released. In the course of summarizing the\nevidence of the Vandenberg Federal Credit Union robbery and discussing\ndefendant‟s responsibility for the crimes directly committed by his companions,\nthe prosecutor stated the following: “I will stop at this point again and say the\nsame thing I said earlier. If all the previous aggravating evidence doesn‟t\noutweigh the mitigating evidence, another robbery and another murder certainly\ndo. And if you choose the other direction, then you are basically saying this is a\nfreebie, we are not going to impose any additional punishment on this defendant\nfor the murder of Christine Orciuch. We are still going to give him life in prison\nwithout the possibility of parole. This is a freebie.” The prosecutor then resumed\nreview of defendant‟s other violent criminal conduct, focusing on his conduct\nwhile he was held in custody. Going back to “the same theme” he mentioned\nbefore, the prosecutor argued in summary that “all these other additional crimes,\nthe additional crimes that — of the robberies, the carjackings, the other bank\nrobberies, all of these are just additional, . . . additional, additional and additional\ncrimes. And if you are to decide that life without the possibility of parole is the\ncorrect verdict, you are basically going to say, as I mentioned before, this is a\nfreebie, the defendant gets this free. The murder of Christine Orciuch, we are just\ngoing to ignore that.” The prosecutor emphasized that the aggravating evidence\nreflected “a collage of an extremely violent history, violence and greed” and\nargued that defendant did not deserve the jury‟s sympathy or mercy. Throughout\n\n\n\n                                           46\n\fhis argument, the prosecutor continued to use the language of comparison and\nweight of the circumstances in urging that a death verdict was justified. (§ 190.3.)\n       In his final argument, the prosecutor again addressed the mitigating\nevidence presented by defendant and urged the jury to conclude that it did not\nestablish that defendant deserved sympathy. He repeated that defendant was\neligible for the death penalty because he had committed two murders and claimed\nthat the defense wanted the jury to ignore all the other aggravating evidence. The\nprosecutor asserted that the defense “wants to say, no, just give him the minimum,\njust give him a freebie, give him a freebie on the third murder, on the attempted\nmurders, on the robberies, on all of the other crimes of violence, we are not going\nto punish you anymore. We will just stop at the two murders.” The prosecutor\nconcluded by urging the jury to impose the death penalty as the “fair” and “just”\npenalty that defendant deserved.\n       Defendant did not object to the prosecutor‟s arguments, including any of\nthe “freebie” comments. Defendant raised this claim of prosecutorial misconduct\nonly in his postverdict application for a new trial, which, as mentioned earlier, the\ntrial court denied. Once again, defendant has forfeited the claim on appeal by\nfailing to timely object and request an admonition from the trial court. (People v.\nLinton, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 1205.) Moreover, we are not persuaded that the\nprosecutor committed misconduct in his argument, or that, if any misconduct\noccurred, it was prejudicial.\n       “ „To prevail on a claim of prosecutorial misconduct based on remarks to\nthe jury, the defendant must show a reasonable likelihood the jury understood or\napplied the complained-of comments in an improper or erroneous manner.\n[Citations.] In conducting this inquiry, we “do not lightly infer” that the jury drew\nthe most damaging rather than the least damaging meaning from the prosecutor‟s\nstatements.‟ ” (People v. Dykes (2009) 46 Cal.4th 731, 771-772.) Here, the\n\n                                         47\n\fprosecutor‟s lengthy argument, viewed as a whole, built on defendant‟s eligibility\nfor a death sentence after his commission of the murders of Hicks and Boyd. It\nessentially contended that defendant deserved the death penalty for the charged\ntriple murders because of the totality of the circumstances of the killing of Hicks,\nBoyd, and Armstrong when considered in light of all the aggravating evidence of\ndefendant‟s violent conduct before and after those three murders. (People v.\nStanley (1995) 10 Cal.4th 764, 822.)\n       We have recognized as appropriate a similar prosecutorial argument urging\nthat three murders warranted a death verdict to avoid a “freebie” for the third\nmurder. (People v. Rogers (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1136, 1174 & fn. 23.) Defendant\ncontends, however, that “[w]hile it may be appropriate to make such a freebie\nargument with regard to a third murder directly committed by a defendant . . . , it\nis improper to make this „freebie‟ argument with regard to factor (b) crimes, as the\nprosecutor did here.” Although it is possible a prosecutor‟s use of the term\n“freebie” in connection with section 190.3, factor (b), evidence might in a\nparticular case mislead a jury regarding its proper focus under section 190.3 in\nreaching a penalty verdict, and a prosecutor should be particularly careful in this\nregard, we are not convinced the prosecutor‟s argument in this case crossed the\nline into misconduct. In the context of the entirety of the prosecutor‟s argument,\nthe jury would likely have understood him to be contending that when defendant‟s\ninvolvement in the Vandenberg Federal Credit Union robbery and murder of\nOrciuch and the other factor (b) evidence was added to the jury‟s consideration of\nthe appropriate penalty for the three murder convictions, a death verdict was all\nthe more warranted — not that it was the jury‟s responsibility to impose separate\npunishment on defendant for Orciuch‟s murder.\n       Furthermore, here the jury was instructed about how to properly evaluate\nthe evidence submitted in aggravation and mitigation. (CALJIC Nos. 8.85, 8.87,\n\n                                         48\n\f8.88.) The jury also was instructed that in the penalty phase of trial it could be\ninfluenced by pity or sympathy for defendant, allowing the jury to view\ndefendant‟s mitigating evidence as compassionately as it wished. The jury was\nspecifically told that statements made by the attorneys during the trial do not\nconstitute evidence, and that it must accept and follow the law as stated by the trial\ncourt. (CALJIC Nos. 1.02, 8.84.1.) We presume the jury followed the trial\ncourt‟s instructions. (People v. Harris (2013) 57 Cal.4th 804, 852.) And we\nconclude that in light of the totality of the evidence presented at the penalty phase,\nthere is no reasonable possibility that the jury would have returned a different\npenalty verdict absent the prosecutor‟s “freebie” argument concerning Orciuch‟s\nmurder. (People v. Gonzales, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 953.)\n\n           3. Alleged penalty phase instructional errors\n\n                a. Instructing the jury with CALJIC No. 8.85\n       CALJIC No. 8.85 instructs the jury regarding the aggravating and\nmitigating factors listed in section 190.3, factors (a) through (k), which, if\nrelevant, the jury must consider in deciding the penalty to be imposed on a capital\ndefendant. Defendant asserts the instruction is constitutionally flawed because (1)\nit fails to instruct the jury as to which of the listed sentencing factors may be\nconsidered aggravating and which may be considered mitigating and (2) it uses the\nrestrictive modifiers “extreme” and “substantial” in describing the sentencing\nfactor of defendant‟s mental or emotional disturbance. As defendant recognizes,\nwe have repeatedly rejected these contentions. (See e.g., People v. Lindberg\n(2008) 45 Cal.4th 1, 50-51; People v. Farnam (2002) 28 Cal.4th 107, 191-192.)\nDefendant fails to persuade that reconsideration is necessary on the ground that\nour previous cases have failed to adequately address his arguments. (See, e.g.,\nPeople v. Rodriguez (2014) 58 Cal.4th 587, 649 [“[T]he catchall instruction\n\n\n\n                                          49\n\fpermits the jury to consider any evidence the defendant offers in mitigation,\nincluding any lesser mental or emotional disturbance”]; People v. Dickey (2005)\n35 Cal.4th 884, 928 [“[T]he aggravating or mitigating nature of the factors is self-\nevident within the context of each case”].)\n\n                b. Instructing the jury with CALJIC No. 8.88\n       The jury was given CALJIC No. 8.88 concerning how to consider and\nweigh the mitigating and aggravating evidence. Defendant claims the instruction\nviolated his rights under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to\nthe federal Constitution. As defendant concedes, we have previously considered\nand rejected these arguments. We do so again because defendant fails to persuade\nus that our prior decisions were erroneous.\n       Thus, we repeat that CALJIC No. 8.88 is not “ „unconstitutional for failing\nto require the jury to return a verdict of life should it determine the mitigating\ncircumstances outweigh the aggravating ones.‟ ” (People v. Suff (2014) 58 Cal.4th\n1013, 1078; accord, People v. Hovarter (2008) 44 Cal.4th 983, 1028.) The\ninstruction “is not constitutionally defective for failing to inform the jury that it\nhas the discretion to impose a sentence of life without the possibility of parole\neven in the absence of mitigating circumstances.” (People v. Linton, supra, 56\nCal.4th at p. 1211.) CALJIC No. 8.88 “is not overly vague for using the words „so\nsubstantial‟ as a modifying phrase.” (People v. Hovarter, supra, at p. 1028.) The\ninstruction “is not flawed for providing that the jury should choose the penalty that\nis „warranted‟ rather than „appropriate.‟ ” (Ibid.)\n       CALJIC No. 8.88 is not flawed for failing to assign to the People the\nburden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of an aggravating\nfactor or that the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors. (People v.\nManibusan (2013) 58 Cal.4th 40, 100.) The high court‟s decisions in Jones v.\n\n\n\n                                           50\n\fUnited States (1999) 526 U.S. 227, Apprendi v. New Jersey (2000) 530 U.S. 466,\nand Ring v. Arizona (2002) 536 U.S. 584, do not change this conclusion. (People\nv. DeHoyos (2013) 57 Cal.4th 79, 149-150; People v. Salcido (2008) 44 Cal.4th\n93, 167.) The instruction is not unconstitutional for failing to require juror\nunanimity on aggravating factors. (People v. Moon (2005) 37 Cal.4th 1, 43.) The\nUnited States Supreme Court‟s Apprendi line of decisions does not compel a\ndifferent result. (People v. Blair (2005) 36 Cal.4th 686, 753.) The instruction is\nnot unconstitutional for failing to inform the jury that the prosecution bears some\nburden of persuasion at the penalty phase. (People v. Manibusan, supra, at\np. 100.) “[I]t is settled that „the trial court need not and should not instruct the jury\nas to any burden of proof or persuasion at the penalty phase.‟ ” (People v. Butler\n(2009) 46 Cal.4th 847, 874.) The trial court was not required to instruct the jury\nthat the defendant bears no burden to prove mitigating factors or that it need not be\nunanimous in finding the existence of any mitigating factor. (People v. Riggs\n(2008) 44 Cal.4th 248, 328.) “[T]he jury need not be told that there is no burden\nof proof at the penalty phase” (People v. Contreras (2013) 58 Cal.4th 123, 172)\nand the lack of such an instruction is not structural error. (People v. Moon, supra,\nat p. 44.)\n       Defendant‟s assertion that CALJIC No. 8.88 improperly reduced the\nprosecution‟s burden of proof below that required by section 190.3 does not raise a\nclaim distinct from those we reject above. (People v. Suff, supra, 58 Cal.4th at\np. 1078; People v. Moon, supra, 37 Cal.4th at p. 43.)\n       “The absence of written or other specific findings by the jury regarding\naggravating factors did not deprive defendant of his federal due process and\nEighth Amendment rights to meaningful appellate review, violate equal protection\nof the laws or violate defendant‟s Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury.”\n(People v. DeHoyos, supra, 57 Cal.4th at p. 150.)\n\n                                           51\n\f       “The trial court‟s failure to inform the jury that there is a presumption of\nlife does not violate a defendant‟s constitutional rights to due process, to be free\nfrom cruel and unusual punishment, to a reliable determination of his sentence,\nand to equal protection of the law under the Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the federal Constitution.” (People v. McKinnon (2011) 52 Cal.4th\n610, 698.)\n\n                 c. Failing to instruct the jury about the meaning of life without the\n                     possibility of parole\n       Defendant argues that neither CALJIC No. 8.88 nor any other instruction\ninformed the jury that a sentence of life without the possibility of parole meant\ndefendant would never be considered for parole. He maintains that the trial court\nhad a duty to instruct on its own motion concerning “the true meaning of this\nsentence.” “We repeatedly have held, however, that trial courts are not required\n— either upon request, or on the court‟s own motion — to instruct that a sentence\nof life without possibility of parole will inexorably be carried out, because such an\ninstruction would be an incorrect statement of the law. [Citations.] We likewise\nhave rejected the suggestion that Simmons v. South Carolina (1994) 512 U.S. 154,\nand its progeny mandate such an instruction. [Citations.]” (People v. Whalen\n(2013) 56 Cal.4th 1, 88.) We have held that CALJIC No. 8.84, which was given\nin this case, adequately informs the jury that a defendant sentenced to life without\nthe possibility of parole is ineligible for parole. (People v. Duenas (2012) 55\nCal.4th 1, 28.) We are not persuaded to revisit these prior holdings.\n\n             4. Cumulative effect of guilt and penalty phase errors\n       Defendant contends that the cumulative effect of the guilt and penalty phase\nerrors requires reversal of the judgment. We have concluded that defendant\nforfeited many of his claims of error. In any event, we have either rejected the\nmerits of defendant‟s claims or found that any error, assumed solely for purposes\n\n\n                                          52\n\fof argument, was harmless. We now conclude there is no cumulative effect of\nerror requiring reversal of the judgment. (People v. Panah (2005) 35 Cal.4th 395,\n479-480.)\n\n            5. Constitutionality of California’s capital sentencing statutes\n       Contrary to the claim of defendant, “ „California does not employ the death\npenalty as a “ „regular punishment for substantial numbers of crimes‟ ” [citation],\nand its imposition does not violate international norms of decency or the Eighth\nAmendment‟s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.‟ ” (People v.\nDeHoyos, supra, 57 Cal.4th at p. 151.) And “ „[r]eview for intercase\nproportionality‟ is not required by the federal Constitution.” (Ibid.)\n\n            6. International Law\n       Defendant contends imposition of the death penalty violates international\nlaw and asks us to reconsider our previous rejection of this claim. We decline to\ndo so and repeat that “California‟s death penalty law does not violate international\nlaw. We reach this conclusion taking into consideration defendant‟s assertions\nthat the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights binds state courts and\nthat international legal norms are among the evolving standards of decency used to\ndefine the scope of the Eighth Amendment to the federal Constitution. [Citation.]”\n(People v. Duenas, supra, 55 Cal.4th at p. 28.)\n\n\n\n\n                                         53\n\f                                 III.

No. BA181702\n____________________________________)\n\n\n        A jury convicted defendant Marcus Dorwin Adams of the 1994 first degree\nmurders of Dayland Hicks, Lamar Armstrong, and Trevon Boyd (Pen. Code,\n§ 187),1 the attempted murder of Luis Hernandez (§§ 187, subd. (a), 664), and\ncarjacking. (§ 215, subd. (a).) The jury found true the allegation that defendant\ndischarged a firearm at an occupied motor vehicle causing great bodily injury and\ndeath within the meaning of section 12022, subdivision (b)(1), with respect to the\nthree murder counts. The jury also found true the alleged multiple-murder special\ncircumstance. (§ 190.2, subd. (a)(3).) With respect to the attempted murder, the\njury found true the allegation that defendant personally inflicted great bodily\ninjury upon the victim within the meaning of section 12022.7, subdivision (a).\nThe jury returned a verdict of death for the three first degree murders.\n\n\n1      All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise\nindicated.\n\n\n\n\n                                          1\n\f       The trial court denied defendant‟s motion to reduce the penalty and his\nmotion for a new penalty phase trial and sentenced defendant to death. The court\nalso imposed, but stayed, a determinate sentence of nine years in prison for\ndefendant‟s attempted murder conviction and an indeterminate term of life with\nthe possibility of parole for his conviction of carjacking. This appeal is automatic.\n(§ 1239, subd. (b).) We affirm the judgment.\n                                      I. FACTS\n\n       A. Guilt phase evidence\n       In early September 1994, defendant, a member of the Six Deuce Brim\nBloods gang, walked up to the car in which three members of the Rollin‟ 60s Crips\ngang were sitting. He shot and killed all three men at close range. Not quite a\nmonth later, defendant shot a security guard patrolling the parking lot of a credit\nunion. He fled the scene with his two companions. In a nearby neighborhood,\nthey carjacked a woman‟s car.\n       At trial, regarding the first three shootings, defendant challenged the\ncredibility of the witnesses who identified him as the shooter. Regarding the later\nincidents, defendant claimed one of his companions was the shooter and had\npulled the woman out of her car.\n\n           1. The September 7, 1994 homicides\n       On the afternoon of September 7, 1994, Lewis Dyer was standing with\nZenia Meeks, a drug addict, on Western Avenue at 47th Street in Los Angeles,\nacross the street from Ford‟s Liquor store. The area was known as a Crips gang\nneighborhood and Dyer was a member of the 46th Street Neighborhood Crips\ngang. Dyer and Meeks saw Dayland Hicks, Lamar Armstrong, and Trevon Boyd,\nmembers of the Rollin‟ 60s Crips gang, drive up in a Cadillac and park in front of\nthe liquor store. The two Crips gangs were friendly. Dyer and Meeks walked\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\fover to the Cadillac, and Dyer began to speak with Hicks. Dyer and Hicks went\ninto the liquor store. After Hicks bought a beer, they returned to the Cadillac.\nHicks got into the driver‟s seat. Boyd was sitting in the front passenger seat, and\nArmstrong was sitting in the backseat. Dyer leaned on the passenger side of the\ncar and continued to speak with the three men. According to Meeks, she stood\nnear the hood of the car, waiting for the men to finish their conversation.\n         Dyer and Meeks both noticed a young man walking toward them. Dyer\nrecognized the man as defendant, whom he knew to be a Bloods gang member\nwith the gang moniker of “Little Sonny.” Dyer and defendant knew each other\nwhen they were both held in the same California Youth Authority (CYA) juvenile\nfacility. Although defendant belonged to a Bloods gang, he was not wearing\ncolors associated with the Bloods gangs, but colors that blended into the Crips\nneighborhood. During this time in 1994 a gang war was underway between the\nBloods and the Crips. The 46th Street Neighborhood Crips gang, along with the\nRollin‟ 60s Crips gang, were enemies of the Six Deuce Brim Bloods gang —\ndefendant‟s gang. Defendant pulled out a gun and shot at Dyer. Dyer ducked,\ncrawled to the front of the car, then stood up and ran down the street while\ndefendant fired a number of shots into the Cadillac at close range. Meeks stood\nstill.\n         Hicks suffered a fatal gunshot wound to his head at the right temple area\nand a nonfatal gunshot wound to his upper right arm. The wounds were consistent\nwith Hicks having raised his arm up in a defensive position at the side of his head.\nBoyd suffered gunshot wounds to his chest, the ring finger of his left hand, and his\nright forearm. One of the bullets that entered his chest fatally damaged his liver\nand heart. Armstrong was also shot in the arm and chest. The bullet that entered\nhis chest fatally damaged his liver, heart, and left lung. When defendant finished\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\fshooting, he walked back toward an alley, got into a red four-door car, and drove\ndown 47th Street.\n       Hicks died in the Cadillac. Boyd exited the Cadillac and ran into Ford‟s\nLiquor store. Meeks followed Boyd into the store and saw that he had been shot.\nShe ran back across the street to a pay phone, dialed 911, and reported the\nshootings. Lisa Mallard, who was in the liquor store with the owner, an employee,\nand another individual, tried to calm Boyd. Mallard told him that the paramedics\nwere coming, but Boyd passed out and died. Armstrong exited the Cadillac, but\ncollapsed near the corner of 47th and Western. Armstrong and Boyd were\ntransported to area hospitals. Armstrong died at the hospital.\n       When Dyer returned to the scene, he saw Hicks‟s body still in the driver‟s\nseat, with blood everywhere. He saw the police and paramedics arrive, but he did\nnot talk to them. Dyer felt that he should not say anything because a gang member\nwould be labeled a “snitch” if he spoke to the police about a gang-related crime,\neven if the crime was committed by a rival gang against the member‟s own gang.\nDyer feared that if he told the police what he knew about the shooting, others\nwould try to harm him. He did not want to get involved. Instead, Dyer went to a\nnearby pay phone and called Hicks‟s uncle, Gregory Shoaf. He told Shoaf that\nHicks had been shot and that defendant was the shooter.\n       On the day of the homicides, police officers took Meeks to the police\nstation for an interview. Meeks did not give Dyer‟s name to the police because\nshe wanted to protect him. And although Meeks had recognized defendant as the\nshooter, she did not identify him to the police because she was frightened and did\nnot want to get involved. Instead, she told the police that she was unable to\nidentify the shooter, claiming she was high and on psychiatric medication. Police\nspoke with Meeks several times and showed her a set of photographs of possible\nsuspects. Meeks did not identify anyone because of concerns about her own and\n\n                                         4\n\fher family‟s safety. At trial, she explained that a member of her family had\nreceived a telephone call that Meeks understood as a warning to keep quiet.\n       A week after the shootings, the police contacted Dyer, but he gave them no\ninformation. He claimed that he was inside the liquor store when the shots were\nfired. The next day, after receiving information from Shoaf that Dyer was a\nwitness to the shooting, the police asked Dyer to come into the police station.\nWhen Dyer arrived, Shoaf, Shoaf‟s sister, and Boyd‟s mother were there. Dyer\nwas initially reluctant to talk to the police, but changed his mind after the family\nmembers convinced him he should tell the police what he knew about the killing\nof his friends. Dyer told the police what happened and gave a written statement.\nHe identified defendant as the shooter in a photographic lineup.\n       Defendant was taken into custody early in October 1994 and interviewed as\na suspect regarding various gang murders. Defendant told the interviewing\ndetectives that he knew about the killings on Western Avenue. He said the shooter\nput on a blue shirt to make the victims think he was a Crips gang member. He\nwalked up to their car and “dumped on them,” using a .9-millimeter handgun and\nfled in a red car. Defendant, however, denied being present, denied committing\nthe shootings, and refused to disclose the name of the perpetrator. He stated that\nthe shooter knew the Crips gang member who witnessed the shooting because they\nhad been in jail together, but defendant denied knowing the witness himself.\nDefendant told the detectives that his family fell apart after Rollin‟ 60s gang\nmembers killed his brother. He blamed the 60s for what happened to his family.\nDefendant told the detectives that he was not admitting the murders, but if he had\ndone them, the reason would be the killing of his brother.\n       Dyer was subsequently arrested on a parole violation and taken to county\njail. Defendant was in the same jail at that time. When Dyer was asked to view a\nlive lineup that included defendant, Dyer did not identify defendant as the shooter\n\n                                          5\n\fbecause he was afraid of what could happen to him in jail if he was labeled a\nsnitch. Sometime later, Dyer was brought to an office where defendant was\nwaiting. Defendant told Dyer not to say anything and showed him a copy of the\nstatement Dyer had made to police identifying defendant as the shooter.\nDefendant told Dyer that the sheriff‟s deputy who escorted him to the office was\ndefendant‟s cousin and that defendant could have Dyer moved to a safe facility as\nlong as Dyer did not identify him. Defendant told Dyer that he had given him “a\npass,” meaning he could have killed him when he shot the others but chose not to.\nDyer assured defendant that he had not picked him out of the lineup and that he\ndid not intend to “tell on [him].” At trial, Dyer testified that he had decided not to\ntestify or cooperate with the police even before this conversation. Dyer testified\nthat he was concerned that if his statement to police “[got] around the jail” he\ncould be hurt or killed. He said that he received threats before and after the lineup.\n       When a defense investigator subsequently came to interview him at the\nCYA facility where Dyer was transferred, Dyer lied and said that he had been in\nthe liquor store at the time of the shootings. He told the investigator that he did\nnot see anything and claimed the victims‟ families pressured him into making his\nstatement to the police. Meeks continued to be uncooperative with the police. In\n1995, the case against defendant was dismissed and he was released.\n       In 1998, investigators from the Santa Barbara County District Attorney‟s\nOffice contacted Dyer, who had been released from custody a couple of years\nearlier. The investigators asked about the 1994 murders. Because Dyer was\ntrying to reform his life, he decided to cooperate with them and to testify against\ndefendant. He told the investigators about being threatened and about his\njailhouse conversation with defendant. When Dyer was contacted by Los Angeles\npolice detectives and asked to attend a live lineup in 1999, Dyer identified\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fdefendant as the shooter of his three friends. Dyer also identified defendant as the\nshooter at defendant‟s preliminary hearing and again at trial.\n       Kipchoge Johnson testified at defendant‟s trial that until 2000 he belonged\nto the Van Ness Gangsters, a Brim Bloods gang that was “best friends” with\ndefendant‟s gang, the Six Deuce Brim gang. Johnson testified that he decided to\ntell the police what he knew about this shooting because he had become\n“disgusted” with the gang lifestyle and had become friends with the brother of one\nof the three victims.\n       Johnson recalled being with defendant in 1994 when defendant received an\nupsetting phone call. Defendant told Johnson that one of defendant‟s “homies”\nhad just been killed by a Crips gang member. A few days later defendant came in\nwith a newspaper article. He said, “This is what I did for the homies” and threw\nthe newspaper on the floor. Everybody ran to look at it. Johnson saw that it was\nan article about the killings of the three Rollin‟ 60s gang members. Some of the\nolder gang members who were present asked defendant what had happened.\nDefendant replied that he “ran up on them” and with five shots “domed,” meaning\nshot in the head, all three of the men who were inside a parked Cadillac. He had\nmade sure they were Crips gang members by “throwing” their neighborhood sign\nat them and having them throw the sign back to him. Johnson testified that using\nonly five shots and shooting a person in the head would garner more status for a\ngang member. He also testified that a gang member would not take credit for a\nkilling that he did not commit because if he did, he would be disciplined and\nkicked out of the neighborhood. According to Johnson, if defendant bragged\nabout killing someone, he must have done it. Johnson believed it fair to say that\ndefendant hated the Rollin‟ 60s gang.\n       A few months after the killings, Johnson met defendant on the county jail\nbus while going to court. Johnson asked defendant who had identified him as the\n\n                                         7\n\fshooter and defendant replied it was the person to whom he had given a “pass”\nand allowed to run away based on their prior custody together in CYA. Defendant\nsaid that he should have killed him too. Johnson subsequently heard defendant tell\nsome Crips gang members that he was going to “beat this,” get out of jail, and kill\nsome more of their members.\n       Christopher Fennelle was a member of the Six Deuce Brim Bloods gang\nuntil 1995. He knew defendant for a number of years as a member of the same\ngang. Fennelle testified that sometime in 1995 defendant came to Fennelle‟s\nhome because he wanted to buy a gun. As they were talking, defendant brought\nup the subject of the three Rollin‟ 60s Crips who were killed the previous year.\nDefendant told Fennelle that he had seen the Cadillac parked with three Crips\ninside and one standing outside. As defendant walked up to the car, the man by\nthe passenger door saw him and took off running. Defendant said he fired shots at\nthe fleeing man and then shot everyone in the car.\n       Special precautions were taken to protect both Johnson and Fennelle while\nthey were testifying during the trial. And they were both promised that whenever\nthey were released from prison they would be provided with witness relocation\nservices.\n       In 2001, Meeks was in a drug rehabilitation program and had become a\nChristian. She decided to cooperate with authorities regarding the 1994 shooting.\nShe subsequently identified defendant in a photo lineup as the shooter.\n\n            2. The October 3, 1994 attempted murder and carjacking\n       On October 3, 1994, Luis Hernandez was working as a security guard\npatrolling a parking lot for several Santa Monica businesses, including the\nTelephone Employees Credit Union. About 10:30 a.m., a car approached\nHernandez. There were three African-American men in the car. The front\n\n\n\n                                         8\n\fpassenger asked Hernandez if he knew the location of Santa Monica College. As\nHernandez pointed to the left, the man said, “Don‟t move,” reached into the glove\ncompartment of the car, and pulled out a handgun. Hernandez turned and ran\ntoward the entrance to the credit union. He heard several shots behind him. He\nwas hit and fell down, but got up again and continued running. He was shot again\nas he reached the credit union door and collapsed after he entered the building. He\nwas taken to the hospital where he had surgery and remained for a week. He was\nout of work for two months.\n       Jasmine Green was inside the credit union that morning, and looked up\nwhen she heard gunshots. She observed a yellow Cadillac parked outside and as\nshe watched, a man stepped from the passenger side of the car and shot at\nHernandez, the security guard. Hernandez ran past the window and into the credit\nunion, collapsing in front of her. Green then saw the shooter get back in the car\nand the car drive away. She got a good look at the shooter. She believed he used\na .9-millimeter gun, and described all three men in the car as African-American.\n       About 11:15 a.m. on the same day, Socorro Navarro drove to the Santa\nMonica home of her friend, Linda Nicastro, to give her a ride to work. Navarro\nstopped in front of her friend‟s home on Oak Street, which is about six blocks\naway from the Telephone Employees Credit Union. Navarro honked her horn and\nNicastro came out of the house. Before Nicastro could get to Navarro‟s car, a\nyellow car with two African-American men in the front seat suddenly came from\nthe opposite direction and stopped next to Navarro. The driver got out and\napproached Navarro. He produced a gun and said, “Bitch, get out of the car.”\nFrightened, Navarro complied. She walked over to Nicastro. They grabbed hands\nand walked toward the apartment building without looking back toward the car.\nNavarro heard the sound of cars speeding away. She turned and saw her car and\nthe yellow car drive away in the same direction.\n\n                                         9\n\f        Jerry Flannery lived across the street from Nicastro. Around 11:15 a.m.\nthat morning, he had just parked his car and was walking across the street when he\nheard another car approaching at a high rate of speed. He heard it slam on its\nbrakes and saw it pull up next to Navarro‟s car. He saw three people inside the\ncar. Flannery testified that the driver, an African-American male in his late 20s,\ngot out and walked up to Navarro, yelling at her to get out of her car. Flannery\nstarted toward Navarro to help her, but the man raised a gun, which Flannery\nrecognized as a .9-millimeter semiautomatic. When the man pointed it at\nFlannery, Flannery dove behind the parked cars, then crawled to the front of one\nof the cars and peeked around the corner. Flannery saw the man yank Navarro‟s\ncar door open, grab Navarro by the hair, and drag her out of the car. Flannery\nturned and went to nearby apartment buildings, knocking on three or four doors in\nan attempt to get someone to call the police. Flannery returned to the street in\ntime to see the two cars drive away. Flannery got back into his car and tried to\nfollow them in order to obtain a license plate number, but was unable to find the\ncars.\n        In 1999, Santa Monica Police Sergeant Gary Steiner was assigned to\nreinvestigate the 1994 credit union shooting and subsequent carjacking. He\ninterviewed defendant after he heard that defendant had information regarding the\ncase. Defendant told Steiner that he wanted to get his former friend Chauncey\nBowen, who was the brother of Fennelle, in trouble because Bowen had tried to\nkill defendant and defendant‟s girlfriend. Defendant described the shooting of\nHernandez at the credit union and the subsequent carjacking of Navarro, but\nclaimed that he had acted only as a lookout and that Bowen was both the shooter\nat the credit union and the man who dragged Navarro out of her car. Defendant\ntold Steiner that he later bought the gun that Bowen had used and it was that gun\nhe had with him when he was arrested back in October 1994.\n\n                                         10\n\f       Forensic examination in 1995 of the shell casings and bullet fragments\nrecovered in connection with the shooting of Hernandez determined that the shell\ncasings were fired from one gun and that the bullets were also fired from one gun.\nBut without the benefit of analyzing the gun itself, it could not be determined that\nthe casings and bullets were fired from the same gun. After defendant‟s interview\nstatements in 1999, the shell casings and bullet fragments were reanalyzed, along\nwith the gun seized when defendant was arrested in 1994. It was then determined\nthat the shell casings and bullet fragments had been fired from that gun. That gun\nwas not the weapon used in the 1994 killings of Hicks, Boyd, and Armstrong.\n       In 1999, credit union customer Green was shown a photographic lineup of\npossible suspects in the credit union shooting. She identified defendant‟s picture\nas being that of the shooter. She also identified defendant as the shooter in a\nsubsequent live lineup and later at trial.\n\n       B. Penalty phase evidence\n\n           1. Evidence submitted in aggravation under factor (b) of section 190.3\n       In the penalty phase, the prosecution presented evidence of defendant‟s\nhistory of numerous criminal activities involving the use or attempted use of force,\nviolence or threat. (§ 190.3, factor (b).)\n\n                a. Carjackings committed as a juvenile\n       The prosecution presented evidence of two carjackings committed by\ndefendant when he was 17 years old.\n       According to Alice Rox, on January 21, 1988, she parked her car on her\nway to a swap meet in Los Angeles. When she got out of her car, a male, whom\nshe later identified as defendant, pointed a gun at her and demanded the keys to\nher car. She tossed the keys to him, and defendant took her car. The car was\nrecovered a few days later.\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f       Dwain Edwards testified that on February 4, 1988, he drove his car to a gas\nstation. Edwards was about to fill his car when a male, whom Edwards later\nidentified as defendant, pointed a machine gun at him and demanded his keys.\nEdwards complied and ran approximately 50 feet away. When he turned around,\nhe saw defendant leaving in his car. Defendant was taken into custody later that\nday on the campus of a local high school, and police seized a machine gun that a\nwitness claimed to have seen defendant hide. The weapon held a 50-round clip,\nwhich contained 40 rounds when it was examined. Defendant admitted\ncommitting both the January 21 and February 4 carjackings. Edwards‟s car was\nrecovered several days later.\n\n               b. September 1994 robbery of Pacific Marine Credit Union\n       On the morning of September 27, 1994 — three weeks after the triple\nhomicide of Hicks, Boyd, and Armstrong and six days before the attempted\nmurder of Hernandez and the carjacking of Navarro — Melissa Lopez was\nworking as the head teller and assistant manager at the Pacific Marine Credit\nUnion in Oceanside. Lopez testified that at approximately 11:30 a.m., the glass\ndouble doors of the credit union flew open and three or four African-American\nmen ran inside. They were carrying semiautomatic weapons, which they pointed\nat the tellers. Two of the men hurdled the first two teller counters and ordered\neveryone to the ground. Lopez was ordered to get up when she identified herself\nas the person who was in charge of the credit union that morning. One man, later\ndetermined to be defendant, led her to the vault at gunpoint and demanded she\nopen it. Lopez fumbled with the keys. Defendant put his gun next to her temple\nand said he would shoot her if she did not hurry. After she opened the vault,\ndefendant took the currency and placed it in a bag. Lopez could hear another man\non the other side of the credit union ordering tellers to open their drawers. The\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\fmen left the credit union, and someone called 911. After the robbery, the credit\nunion manager performed an audit and determined that $161,589.23 had been\ntaken. Lopez identified defendant at trial as the man who had forced her back to\nthe vault, held a gun at her head, and took the currency.\n         Michael Loughran worked for a company whose office was inside the\ncredit union. He testified that he heard the commotion in the credit union that\nmorning. He looked around his door and saw an African-American man, whom\nLoughran identified in court as defendant, pointing a gun at him. Defendant told\nLoughran to come into the bank and lie down by the tellers. Loughran complied,\nand heard sounds from the vault area. Then defendant, holding a big bag, jumped\nover the counter and landed next to Loughran. Defendant put his knee on\nLoughran‟s chest and asked if he had any money. Loughran reached into his top\npocket, where he usually kept his cash, but pulled out his business cards by\nmistake. Defendant hit Loughran in the head with his gun and said, “Give me all\nyour money, white boy.” He pointed the gun at Loughran‟s face. Loughran\nremembered his money was in a different pocket. He handed defendant two $100\nbills. Defendant took Loughran‟s pager, stood up, and walked out of the credit\nunion. Loughran identified defendant at trial as the man who pointed the gun at\nhim and took his money and pager.\n         According to Bloods gang member Kipchoge Johnson, defendant bragged\nabout the robbery of the credit union. Johnson explained that defendant did not\nhave a job; defendant‟s job was being a gangster. Johnson said that defendant\nwould rob banks and kill people, go to prison, get out and do the same thing over\nagain.\n         Santa Monica Detective Steiner interviewed defendant in 1999. According\nto Steiner, defendant said that he and Chauncey Bowen had robbed the credit\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\funion in Oceanside in September 1994. According to defendant, they stole almost\n$200,000. Defendant described his role in the robbery to Steiner.\n       Melissa Lopez testified regarding the impact the robbery had on her life.\nAccording to Lopez, she had worked at the Pacific Marine Credit Union for three\nand a half years at the time of the robbery. She loved working there and felt she\nhad a strong future. After the robbery, she immediately started looking for a\ndifferent job. She completely changed her field of work. She required six months\nof posttraumatic stress syndrome therapy, seeing a therapist twice a week. She\nsuffered nightmares for a long time after the robbery. At the time of trial in 2003,\nshe was still frightened of doors opening quickly and of people who looked\n“suspicious.” She did not trust people and avoided public areas after dark.\nDefendant‟s face was forever ingrained in her head and she “freaked out”\nwhenever she saw someone who resembled defendant.\n\n               c. October 1995 shooting of George Minor\n       One night in October 1995 — two weeks after defendant had been released\nfrom custody — George Minor, a drug dealer and gang member, was standing in\nthe front yard of his home speaking with some neighbors. According to Minor,\ndefendant and two other African-American men approached him. One of the men\nasked for an individual named “Ray Ray.” Minor said Ray Ray was not there.\nDefendant, who was holding a gun, then moved the two other men aside and\nstepped up to Minor, saying, “You Ray Ray.” Defendant announced he was “East\nCoast,” a rival gang, and he and one of the other men began shooting at Minor.\nMinor was hit in the arm and the leg before he ran behind a car parked in the\ndriveway. Both shooters fired multiple additional shots at the car and the house.\nWhen the gunfire ceased, the men scattered.\n\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\f       Minor testified that he ran into his house, and someone called 911.\nAlthough a number of bullets went through the walls of the house, Minor‟s sisters\nand nieces who were inside were not injured. Minor was taken to the hospital,\nwhere he stayed for several weeks. At the hospital, Minor selected defendant‟s\npicture from a photographic lineup as one of the shooters. He also identified\ndefendant at trial as the man who called him Ray Ray and shot him. He had no\ndoubt about his identification.\n       Minor‟s wife, Saudia, testified that she was coming home from the store\nwhen she saw the men shooting at her husband. Defendant was one of the\nshooters. When she saw everyone scatter, she got out of the car and went into the\nhouse, where she was told Minor had been shot. Paramedics arrived and Minor\nwas taken to the hospital.\n       Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff Angel Jaimes was patrolling with his\npartner on the night of the shooting. Upon hearing approximately 10 gunshots,\nJaimes testified that he drove toward the sound of the gunfire and was flagged\ndown by a man who was standing in the middle of the street. The man said he had\nseen the shooters and that they were headed west. Jaimes allowed him to get into\nthe rear seat of the patrol car and they drove west. When they spotted a white\nCadillac with two African-American males inside, the man got excited and\npointed, saying, “That‟s him, that‟s him.” Jaimes and his partner requested\nassistance and conducted a traffic stop of the Cadillac. Defendant and another\nman exited the Cadillac. Jaimes searched the car and found two hidden handguns,\na .9-millimeter automatic and a .380-caliber automatic. Both men were taken into\ncustody. During booking, Jaimes tested defendant‟s hands for gunshot residue.\nSubsequent analysis determined that gunshot residue was present on both of his\nhands. A criminalist testified that analysis of the bullet casings and an expended\n\n\n\n                                        15\n\fbullet recovered from the scene of the shooting determined that they were fired\nfrom the two guns recovered from the Cadillac.\n       Minor testified that after he was subpoenaed as a witness regarding the\nshooting, he received a phone call telling him not to come to court. Saudia\ntestified that she received multiple strange phone calls after she was subpoenaed as\na witness. According to Saudia, the calls to her were from a woman and a man.\nOn one occasion, she was asked by the caller to attend a court hearing and lie\nabout what she saw. On another occasion, a man said he knew where Saudia‟s\ndaughter went to school and that Saudia worked at International House of\nPancakes. Saudia testified that she was frightened. Both Minor and his wife\ntestified that they believed the calls were “three-way” calls from the county jail.\nAccording to Saudia, she responded to the subpoena and went to court, but when\nshe saw defendant behind a window, she left because she was worried about her\nfamily‟s safety. At defendant‟s capital trial, however, Saudia identified defendant\nas one of the shooters.\n\n               d. August 1997 robbery of Vandenberg Federal Credit Union and\n                   killing of Christine Orciuch\n       Defendant was released on parole on July 15, 1997.\n       On the morning of August 8, 1997, Jasper Altheide was working as a teller\nat the Vandenberg Federal Credit Union in Lompoc. He testified that four men,\nincluding Chauncey Bowen and defendant, entered the credit union. Bowen\nwalked over to the counter and pretended to fill out a deposit slip or envelope.\nDefendant then ran up to the counter with a shotgun. Defendant began screaming,\n“Get the fuck down or I‟ll shoot you.” He jumped over the counter and asked for\nthe manager. When no one responded, defendant said he would shoot someone.\nAnother credit union employee, Moira Philley, testified that she told defendant\nthat the manager was in the back. Defendant told Philley to get up and kicked her\n\n\n                                         16\n\fhard in the foot. When she rose, defendant put the shotgun against her back and\nshoved her. Philley led defendant toward the back where the manager was.\nAccording to Philley, as she and defendant were walking through a doorway, two\ngunshots were fired. The gunshots came from the other side of the counter near\nthe front door and were not fired by defendant. Defendant screamed, “What the\nfuck?” Someone said, “let‟s get out of here,” and defendant and the other robbers\nleft the credit union. Philley raced to call 911 and report the robbery. An audit\nlater determined that the robbers had taken a little over $11,000 from the teller\ndrawers.\n       Octavio Gallardo was approaching the front door of the credit union while\nthe robbery was in progress. He had a broken left leg and was walking on\ncrutches. Gallardo testified that a woman, later determined to be Christine\nOrciuch, asked if he needed help and opened the door for him. After he entered, a\nman wearing a mask pointed a handgun at him and told him to get down.\nAccording to Gallardo, the man shot him in the right thigh before he could\ncomply. Gallardo fell to the ground. The woman, who was behind Gallardo,\nturned and ran out. The man with the gun yelled at her to stop and come back.\nGallardo then heard another gunshot. Orciuch was fatally shot and immediately\nfell to the sidewalk. Someone said, “Let‟s go,” and Gallardo heard the sound of\nrunning toward the parking lot. One of the robbers stopped to take a backpack\nfrom Orciuch before running away.\n       Orciuch‟s 11-year-old son, Quentin, was waiting for his mom in their car\nwhen he heard the gunshots and heard his mother scream his name. According to\nQuentin, he jumped out of the car and saw his mother lying facedown on the\nground. Three men were running from the credit union. Quentin ran to the side\ndoor of the credit union, where he banged on the door and yelled that his mother\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\fhad been shot. He was allowed inside, but was prevented from going to his\nmother‟s body.\n       Defendant‟s former fellow gang member Fennelle testified that a few\nweeks before this robbery and murder, Fennelle spoke with defendant and Bowen\nat the house of Sabrina Johnson. The two men told Fennelle that they were\nplanning an armed bank robbery. They said they needed cars, and that they would\ncollect a lot of money. They asked Fennelle if he wanted to participate. Fennelle\nrefused and tried to convince Bowen and defendant not to do it. He warned them\nthat if someone was killed in the robbery, they would be equally responsible for\nthe murder. Defendant told him that he did not care and was determined to go\nahead as planned. According to investigating officers, defendant admitted, in\ninterviews after his arrest, that he was present during the robbery.2\n       Several witnesses testified concerning the impact of the robbery and\nshooting on them and their family as follows.\n       Jasper Altheide testified that she had difficulties after the robbery because\nduring the robbery she had lain under the counter, and although she had the keys\nto the vault and could have given the robbers the money, she did not do so because\nshe was so frightened. According to Altheide, she felt very guilty about not\nallowing Orciuch‟s son to see Orciuch after Orciuch was shot and felt directly\nresponsible for her death. Every time she saw Orciuch‟s family, her heart hurt.\nAltheide had nightmares, was fearful, and no longer wanted to be around people.\n\n\n\n\n2       In his application for a new penalty phase trial, defendant acknowledged\nthat he was subsequently convicted of the Vandenberg Federal Credit Union\nrobbery and murder and had received a sentence of life without the possibility of\nparole.\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\fShe constantly worried and had difficulty working at the credit union. She had\ncounseling, and testified that “the innocence of living is gone.”\n       Moira Philley testified that the robbery and shootings at the Vandenberg\nFederal Credit Union had a tremendous effect on her life. Her marriage almost\n“fell apart from it.” She and her children were “freaked out” by it. She would not\nopen the front door and installed an alarm system. She testified that she was\nconstantly watchful, had anxiety attacks when at work, and eventually had to\nreceive trauma counseling. She had nightmares of Quentin screaming, and felt\nguilty because she survived, but Orciuch did not. She knew the Orciuch family\nand felt for them. For years, the credit union maintained a memorial near the\nflower beds where Orciuch died and Philley found it terrible to watch Orciuch‟s\nhusband light the candles every night and then blow them out every morning.\n       Octavio Gallardo testified that the shooting at the credit union caused him\nto be very fearful. For a time he was afraid to leave his apartment. He required\nmedical attention for his gunshot wound and his leg still hurt when the weather\nwas very cold.\n       Orciuch‟s husband, Chester Orciuch, testified that at the time of his wife‟s\ndeath, they had three children; a daughter age 17, a daughter age 14, and a son,\nQuentin, age 11. When he arrived at the hospital, he was taken to a room and told\nthat his wife had been fatally shot. He screamed “Oh, no” and asked for his\nfamily. He was taken to another room where his eldest daughter was trying to\ncomfort Quentin, who was asking if his mommy was okay. Chester told his\nchildren that their mother had gone to heaven. They went to the emergency room\nand said a prayer at her body. Chester was overwhelmed by her death. Christine\nhad been the caretaker of the family and home-schooled all three children.\nChester testified that he had difficulty as a single father and sometimes woke up in\n\n\n\n                                         19\n\fthe morning with dry heaves. There were also times that he woke up in the night\nscreaming. According to Chester, he lacked focus at home and at work.\n       Quentin Orciuch testified that after his mother was shot and he was allowed\ninto the credit union, he tried to page his father, but he was crying too hard. He\ntried to run outside to see his mother, but was stopped. Eventually, a fireman\ndrove him to the hospital where he waited for his father and sisters to arrive. After\nthey arrived, his father told him his mother had died. He was devastated.\nAccording to Quentin, everything was difficult after his mother‟s death. He thinks\nabout her every day and spent approximately one and one-half years in counseling\nafter her death.\n\n                   e. March 1998 attempted escape and carjacking\n       Defendant and Bowen were held in custody in the Santa Barbara County\njail after their arrest for the Vandenberg Federal Credit Union robbery. On a\nmorning in mid-March 1998, they escaped with another inmate from the jail\nexercise yard. According to witnesses, the three African-American male inmates\nwere seen walking down the hill from the jail to a parking lot, where they\nsurrounded Matilde Ulrich‟s car. One of the inmates pulled Ulrich from her car,\nwhile defendant got in on the passenger side and pushed Ulrich out. The inmates\ndrove off in Ulrich‟s car, which was spotted by a sheriff‟s deputy a short time later\nand was chased by the California Highway Patrol. A spike strip was used to stop\nthe car. Defendant, Bowen, and the third inmate were captured without further\nincident.\n\n                   f. Acts of force or violence or threats of force or violence while in\n                       custody\n       Witnesses testified concerning 12 different incidents involving defendant‟s\nuse of force or violence, or threats of force or violence during the periods of time\nthat he was held in custody as follows.\n\n\n                                             20\n\f       Defendant and Antoine Phillips were both in custody at Avenal State Prison\nin March 1994. The men were members of different Bloods gangs. Defendant\nstarted an argument with Phillips regarding the murder of one of defendant‟s\n“homegirls” by a member of Phillips‟s gang and they agreed to fight. A few\nweeks later, Phillips was lying on the grass of the prison yard when defendant\nwalked up and kicked him in the mouth. Later that evening the two men fought\nand defendant broke Phillips‟s jaw.\n       In November 1997, Sheriff‟s Deputy Brian Parker was conducting a\nsecurity check at the Santa Barbara County jail. Parker told defendant to remove\nseveral items that defendant had secured into his cell wall in violation of jail rules.\nDefendant became verbally abusive and challenged him to enter the cell and fight.\n       In November 1998, while he was in a holding cell at the Santa Maria\ncourthouse, defendant broke a plastic coat hanger that had been used for his\ncivilian clothes, took a large piece and began sharpening it to a point on the\nconcrete floor. Defendant hid the other pieces of the coat hanger in clothing in the\ncorner of the cell. Deputies entered the cell and took from defendant the\nsharpened piece of plastic, as well as the hidden pieces.\n       In September 2000, while he was being held in the Los Angeles County\njail, defendant became upset when he was told that the nurse did not have his\nmedication. Sheriff‟s Deputy Phillips directed defendant to calm down.\nDefendant challenged Phillips and two other deputies to enter his cell and fight\nhim, threatening to harm them.\n       In February 2001, defendant was housed on the disciplinary row in the Los\nAngeles County jail. Defendant handed Sheriff‟s Deputy John Hermann a note\nand told him to post it in the guard booth so that everyone could see it. Defendant\nspecifically said that he wanted Deputy Lindenmayer to see it. The note consisted\nof a cartoon drawing of stick figures, which depicted defendant announcing his\n\n                                          21\n\fgang membership, beating up Lindenmayer, and Lindenmayer lying on the ground\ndead. Both Lindenmayer and Hermann took the note as a threat to Lindenmayer.\n       In July 2001, Sheriff‟s Deputy Charles Nowotny searched defendant‟s cell\nin the Los Angeles County jail and found a handmade “club” in a manila envelope\nin defendant‟s personal property. The club consisted of a tightly rolled-up\nnewspaper with a torn white sheet wrapped around it to form a handle. This was a\ncontraband item that could be used as a weapon.\n       In September 2001, sheriff‟s deputies were escorting defendant from the\nmedical clinic to his single cell in a lockdown module of the Los Angeles County\njail. When they arrived at defendant‟s cell, defendant saw a third deputy removing\nseveral gang photographs from his cell. Defendant began cursing and refused to\nenter his cell until his photographs were returned. Eventually defendant was\nconvinced to go back inside his cell. However, while the deputies were removing\ndefendant‟s handcuffs and waist chain, defendant pulled the chain into the cell and\nbegan swinging it, hitting the door and walls. Defendant yelled that he was “going\nto tear this place apart,” and, “If I get out of here, I am going to tear you apart,\ntoo.” The deputies were able to close the gate and secure the latch so that\ndefendant could not hit them with the chain. It took approximately one hour to\ntalk defendant into handing over the chain. During this time, defendant was\ncursing and threatening people.\n       Not quite three weeks later, sheriff‟s deputies approached defendant‟s cell\nin the Los Angeles County jail to provide defendant with his dinner. When\ndefendant‟s food was passed through the food tray slot, defendant refused the food\nand threw a white watery liquid at Sheriff‟s Deputy Alejandro Martinez, saying,\n“Take that, fuckin‟ deputy.” The liquid landed on Martinez‟s face and upper\nbody. Sheriff‟s Deputy James Brown sprayed pepper spray into the cell so that the\nfood slot could be closed. As the slot was being closed, defendant threw more of\n\n                                           22\n\fthe liquid at Brown, which landed on Brown‟s face and upper body. When\nMartinez sprayed additional pepper spray into the cell, defendant loudly said,\n“You fucking bitches,” and attempted to throw more liquid at the deputies.\nMartinez testified that he did not know what the liquid was, but it might have\ncome from a milk container. Martinez explained that when an inmate throws\nsomething at an officer, it is commonly called “gassing.”\n       In February 2002, defendant complained to Sheriff‟s Deputy Martinez at\nthe Los Angeles County jail that Deputy Valente kept “fucking with [him] and\nsaid that [he was] going to get him.” Defendant gave Martinez a note that he\nwanted given to the floor supervisor. The note said, “I give you my word as a man\nthat I will slice or stab this guy the first chance I get.” Martinez understood the\nnote to refer to Valente. After giving Martinez the note, defendant said he would\n“gas” a deputy if he were given the chance.\n       In June 2002, when defendant was housed in the Los Angeles County jail‟s\n“high power” module, a jail inmate trustee, Douglas Lance, was picking up trash\nand food trays along the walkway in the cell block. As Lance picked up a trash\nbag attached to defendant‟s cell, defendant reached through the bars with his left\nhand and swiped across the right side of Lance‟s neck. Lance cried out in pain\nand called for help. As Sheriff‟s Deputy Damien Ortega responded, Ortega heard\nthe toilet flush in defendant‟s cell. Lance told Ortega that defendant had cut him.\nLance had a two-and-one-half inch laceration from under his ear to the front part\nof his neck. The laceration was about one-quarter inch deep and was bleeding\nprofusely. Lance was taken to the medical clinic, and subsequently transferred to\nan emergency room for treatment. When Ortega saw Lance two weeks later, he\nnoticed a sizeable scar on Lance‟s neck.\n       In January 2003, Sheriff‟s Deputy Mat Taylor was sitting in the control\nbooth at the Los Angeles County jail when he heard a loud thud against the\n\n                                           23\n\fconcrete wall of one of the rows of cells. Taylor looked down the row and\ninitially saw nothing. But when he heard noises sounding like an assault, Taylor\nstood up and saw defendant on top of another inmate, Richard Aguirre. Only\nAguirre was supposed to be out of his cell; defendant had escaped from his cell.\nDefendant was savagely striking Aguirre, who was curled up in a ball, and blood\nwas “flying everywhere.” When Taylor saw that each of defendant‟s blows was\ncreating an injury that produced blood, he knew that a jail-made shank was\ninvolved. Taylor and his partner went down the row to break up the fight. Taylor\npepper-sprayed defendant and Aguirre, but defendant continued to hit Aguirre. As\nadditional deputies arrived, defendant ran back to his cell.\n       Taylor did not find any weapons on Aguirre, who was covered in blood.\nHis clothing had multiple slash marks. Aguirre was taken to the medical clinic\nand then transferred to a hospital trauma center. Sometime after the incident,\ndefendant told Taylor that he wished he had “finished the job” on Aguirre and that\nhe should have done the job right the first time. Aguirre was a “validated”\nassociate of the Mexican Mafia, which is a large Hispanic prison gang.\n       In March 2003, Sheriff‟s Deputy Thomas Davis searched defendant at the\nLos Angeles County jail before he was brought to court. Inmates in defendant‟s\nmodule were segregated so that they did not come into contact with other inmates\nand Davis was looking for, among other things, any notes that could be passed to\nother inmates during their transportation to court. During his search, Davis found\na handwritten note at the bottom of a page of transcript. The note read, “Breezo is\na rat . . . . Breezo and Marlo need to die.” It was signed with defendant‟s gang\nmoniker and other gang terms. According to Lompoc Police Officer Harry Heidt,\nwho had been assigned to investigate the 1997 robbery and murder at the\nVandenberg Federal Credit Union, the transcript on which the note was written\nwas of a telephone conversation Heidt had in December 1997 with Sabrina\n\n                                         24\n\fJohnson, known as “Breezo,” regarding the conversation that had taken place at\nher apartment between defendant, Bowen, and Fennelle. (Fennelle had testified\nthat the conversation concerned defendant and Bowen‟s plan to commit an armed\nbank robbery.) Heidt understood the term “rat” to refer to an informant or\n“snitch” and believed that the writer of the note wanted to have Johnson killed.\n       Defendant‟s mail was monitored while he was in the Los Angeles County\njail. Several letters were confiscated. In those letters, defendant referenced his\nrobbery of a credit union, his cutting of a “white boy with a razor blade in the\nface” while in custody, and his serious cutting and beating of “a Mexican” in\nJanuary 2003 while in lockup.\n\n           2. Evidence submitted in aggravation under factor (c) of section 190.3\n       In September 1993, defendant was convicted of discharging a firearm with\ngross negligence. (§ 246.3.) He received a sentence of 16 months in prison.\nDefendant was paroled one year later, on September 3, 1994 — four days before\nthe murders of Hicks, Boyd, and Armstrong.\n\n           3. Aggravating evidence of victim impact\n\n               a. Dayland Hicks\n       Dayland Hicks was 22 years old when he was killed. His uncle, Gregory\nShoaf, testified that Hicks was respectful, quiet, good-natured, and “very lovable.”\nHe liked to play basketball, football, and video games. He enjoyed dancing,\nrapping, singing, and going to church. He was learning the Bible and taking “his\nlife in that direction.” Shoaf believed Hicks was on the right path, but never had\nthe chance to straighten his life out. Shoaf loved Hicks like his own son. Shoaf\nwas in shock when he received the news that Hicks had been killed. The hardest\nthing Shoaf had to do was tell Hicks‟s sister Jamise that her brother was dead.\nHicks and Jamise were very close and Jamise had no family left after Hicks‟s\n\n\n\n                                         25\n\fdeath, other than Shoaf and his family, because her mother and father had both\ndied earlier. Shoaf testified that he thought about Hicks every day and missed his\nsmile and the things they did together. Shoaf tried to look out for Hicks‟s son,\nwho was four or five months old when Hicks was shot, but he knew he would\nnever replace Hicks. Hicks‟s death also “took a toll” on his grandmother.\n       Jamise Shoaf testified that she was nine years old when her brother was\nkilled. She cried when she was told of his death and it left her with an empty\nfeeling. He was her only sibling, and it was hard to go on without him. She\ntestified that she thought about his death every day. She missed his laugh, his\nsilliness, and watching television with him.\n\n               b. Lamar Armstrong\n       Lamar Armstrong was 19 years old when he was killed. His mother, Doris\nHayes, testified that Armstrong had enjoyed playing football and baseball, running\ntrack, and cooking. He was a good son, worked part time at Home Base, a\nbuilding supply store, and was in the process of getting his GED when he was\nkilled. Doris had difficulty believing Armstrong was actually dead. She could not\nplan the funeral, and she suffered from nightmares. She testified that she missed\neverything about him. Holidays were particularly difficult. Part of her died when\nher son did and she struggled every day.\n       Dan Hayes, Armstrong‟s stepfather, testified that he raised Armstrong from\nthe time he was an infant. He described his stepson as a “good kid,” who enjoyed\nathletics and things that challenged his mind. Dan had “an empty feeling” when\ntold at the hospital that Armstrong had died. He testified that it was very difficult\nto hold his family together after Armstrong‟s death. According to Dan, his wife\nhad “problems” on the anniversary of Armstrong‟s death, on his birthday, and on\nevery holiday. He characterized it as “a nightmare.” He testified that Armstrong‟s\n\n\n\n                                           26\n\ftwo daughters cried on Father‟s Day because they did not understand why they\ncould not see their father. Dan told the jury that he thought about Armstrong\nevery day. His death affected not just the immediate family, but the extended\nfamily.\n       Milika McCoy testified that she was Armstrong‟s girlfriend and was eight\nmonths pregnant when he died. The night before, they had attended a Lamaze\nclass together. Armstrong had just been promoted in his job, was a very nice\nperson, and was excited about McCoy‟s pregnancy. McCoy collapsed when she\nwas told that Armstrong had died after being shot. After his death, she did not\nwant to wake up in the morning. Her daughter, Cherish, was born a little over a\nmonth later. At the time of trial, Cherish was eight years old. She asked about her\nfather “all the time” and had difficulty with not having a “daddy.” McCoy,\nsimilarly, had difficulty raising Cherish by herself. McCoy testified that she\nthought about Armstrong, her best friend, every time she looks at her daughter.\n\n               c. Trevon Boyd\n       Carolyn Boyd, Trevon Boyd‟s mother, testified that Trevon was 20 years\nold when he died. She described him as a beautiful and intelligent person who\nenjoyed writing music, sports, fishing, and dancing. When Carolyn learned of her\nson‟s death, she felt like a part of her was gone. She could not eat or sleep, and it\nwas difficult to make the funeral arrangements. Carolyn missed everything about\nher son. She testified that her family “will never be whole, . . . again.” Holidays\nwere difficult, and she thought about her son every day.\n       Olive Burgess testified that Trevon Boyd was her cousin. According to\nBurgess, Boyd was a “sweet kid” growing up in a rough neighborhood. He meant\neverything to her. His death made her feel numb and the family still cried at night.\nThe hardest thing for Burgess to do after Boyd‟s death was to explain it to her\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\fchildren, who were all close to him. They found it difficult to cope with his death,\nand she missed his smile and thought of him every day.\n\n           4. Mitigating evidence offered by defendant\n       The defense case in mitigation included evidence of defendant‟s family\nhistory and upbringing, as well as opinion testimony by three expert witnesses\nwho described for the jury defendant‟s learning disabilities and his psychological,\nneurological, and intellectual dysfunction. The defense also presented evidence\nthat defendant possessed a genetic condition that, when combined with childhood\nmaltreatment, has been identified as a risk factor for antisocial behavior.\n\n               a. Defendant’s upbringing and background\n       Defendant‟s mother, Pearl Thomas, testified that she had a poor\nrelationship with her own mother and ran away from home when she was 12 years\nold. She got into trouble and was sent to CYA when she was 15. She became a\nsingle mother at the age of 17 when she gave birth to defendant‟s older brother,\nwho became known as “Big Sonny.” Thomas denied drinking alcohol, but\nadmitted being a drug user, and taking barbiturates when defendant was\nconceived. Defendant‟s father was a professional boxer with whom Thomas had a\nshort relationship. Defendant‟s father was a heroin addict and was not\nsignificantly involved in defendant‟s life.\n       When defendant was a toddler, Thomas married Ronald Biggles. He was\nabusive to Thomas and often came home drunk. Biggles favored his own daughter\nover defendant and Big Sonny. He hit defendant. After Thomas left Biggles, she\nlived with James Wright, who disliked and hit defendant. Thomas testified she\nalso hit and whipped defendant because that was the way she was raised. She did\nnot know how to be a good mother.\n\n\n\n\n                                         28\n\f       Thomas supported her family with public welfare assistance and by\nstealing. She estimated that she had been arrested almost 50 times in her life and\nshe was in and out of custody during defendant‟s childhood. When Thomas was\nin prison, defendant sometimes stayed with his grandmother, Amy Parks.\nAccording to Beverly Parks, who was Parks‟s daughter-in-law and defendant‟s\naunt, Parks seemed to hate defendant and his sister Larhonda. She often drank and\nbecame “wild and . . . brutally violent.” Defendant suffered excessive beatings,\nalmost every day, when he was staying in his grandmother‟s house. Parks also\nabused the children by calling them names. One time she scared defendant and\nLarhonda by turning off the lights and following them around with a long knife.\nShe believed in voodoo and performed “curses” on people. She was described as\nbeing “evil” by both Beverly Parks and defendant‟s godmother, Linda Gavin.\nGavin testified that Parks showed her evilness to “anyone she didn‟t like” and she\nparticularly disliked defendant and his sister Larhonda. According to Gavin, Parks\nwould sometimes call on the telephone and tell her to come get “these\nmotherfuckers,” referring to defendant and his sister.\n       Defendant was an energetic and very hyperactive child. He had learning\ndisabilities and was sent to special-needs schools. Defendant was prescribed\nRitalin, but his mother took him off the medication. He was bullied and picked\non, particularly by one member of a local Crips gang. Defendant started getting\ninto trouble at an early age. But one childhood friend of defendant‟s, Reginald\nCampbell, recalled an incident in which defendant jumped into the swimming pool\nand saved him from drowning.\n       Several witnesses (Reginald Campbell, Linda Woods, a neighbor who\nwatched defendant grow up, defendant‟s half sister Ralene, and his aunt Beverly\nParks) testified about the rough neighborhood in which defendant grew up. It was\nfilled with drugs and numerous gangs, which actively recruited members through\n\n                                         29\n\fviolence, including stabbings, carjackings, and shootings. The witnesses\nexplained that to acquire protection in the neighborhood, a person had to join a\ngang. Defendant found protection by joining the Bloods gang to which his\nbrother, Big Sonny, belonged. Big Sonny was a violent person and well known in\nthe neighborhood. Defendant, however, idolized him and saw him as a father\nfigure. Defendant was devastated when Big Sonny was killed in a gang shooting,\nwhich increased his hatred for Crips gang members.\n\n               b. Expert witness testimony in mitigation\n       Dr. Nancy Cowardin, who had a doctorate in educational psychology and\nspecial education, testified as an expert witness regarding learning disabilities.\nShe assessed defendant by reviewing documents regarding his personal\nbackground, meeting with him and giving him current tests of his skills. She\nnoted that defendant started needing remedial help in the first grade or shortly\nthereafter. He attended special-needs schools in grades eight and nine. In eighth\ngrade, his individualized education program (IEP) included a dual diagnosis of\nbeing seriously emotionally disturbed and having learning disabilities with\nattention deficits. Defendant‟s IEP in ninth grade similarly assessed him as being\nseriously emotionally disturbed. According to Cowardin, defendant had a clear\nhistory of attention deficit disorder (ADD). His records from CYA indicated he\nwas very impulsive and lacked sound decisionmaking skills. Cowardin performed\na complete psychoeducational assessment of defendant and concluded his ADD\nwas still present in adulthood, but was more subdued. She found that he had an\nauditory processing problem that could account for his learning disabilities in\nreading and writing at school. As an adult, defendant had improved his reading\nand written language scores, but not his math scores. Defendant‟s IQ was exactly\naverage when verbal and nonverbal scores were combined, but he had large\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\fdeviations in some of the scores. Cowardin found that defendant had lapses in\nmature executive functions that control problem solving, decisionmaking, and\nadaptability under stress in typical adults. She concluded that defendant‟s\ndisability profile may have led to some of his self-control problems.\n       Dr. Arthur Kowell, a specialist in neurology, evaluated defendant‟s brain\nfunction. He interpreted a brain electrical activity mapping study or “BEAM” test\nconducted on defendant in August 2000. Three of the four parts of the test — the\nstandard electroencephalogram, the electroencephalogram spectral analysis, and\nan auditory “evoked potential” test — had normal results. But the visual evoked\npotential test showed some abnormal functioning of defendant‟s brain in the\nvertex, the right parietal region, and the right frontal region. The vertex deals with\nmotor behavior and initiation of activity. The right parietal region deals with\nsensory functions and the right frontal lobe deals with impulse control and\nexecutive functions. An abnormality in this last area might indicate the individual\nhas a short temper or possibly a form of ADD. Kowell testified that the test was\nnonspecific as to the time of onset and the causation for any abnormality shown\nand that the test was not predictive of behavior. But Kowell concluded the test\nshowed evidence of brain dysfunction.\n       Dr. Kowell reviewed defendant‟s medical records, which included two\npositron emission tomography (PET) scans and a magnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI) scan of defendant‟s brain. The results of a 1998 PET scan showed\nabnormalities, while the results of a followup MRI and a second PET scan in 2000\nwere normal. Kowell did not consider the latter tests to be inconsistent with his\nresults. He testified that a neuropsychological workup done by Dr. Kyle Boone in\n2002, which he reviewed, showed abnormalities consistent with Kowell‟s testing.\nKowell noted Boone‟s opinion that defendant‟s decisionmaking skills were\ncomparable to those of someone with mental retardation or borderline intelligence,\n\n                                         31\n\fdespite defendant‟s otherwise normal intelligence. Kowell stated that, according\nto Boone, defendant may lack the essential brain equipment to exert reasoned\ncontrol over his behavior. Kowell also reviewed defendant‟s academic records,\nmental health records, and court records. He considered the historical evidence\nfrom defendant‟s records to be consistent with his finding of abnormal brain\nfunction in defendant.\n          Dr. Carl Osborn, a forensic psychologist, testified that scientific studies had\nshown that childhood abuse and neglect, i.e., maltreatment, alters the brain\nchemistry and functioning in ways that can produce aggressive behavior and that\nthese changes will persist into adulthood. According to Osborn, it had recently\nbeen shown that there is a powerful association with severe antisocial behavior\nlater in life when childhood maltreatment combines with the presence of an\ninherited type of gene, the 3-repeat allele MAOA gene. Genetic testing of\ndefendant showed that he had inherited the 3-repeat allele MAOA gene and, in\nOsborn‟s opinion, defendant had been severely maltreated as a child. Osborne\ntestified that the 3 repeat allele MAOA gene is not a genetic defect, but is a risk\nfactor.\n\n                                     II. DISCUSSION\n\n          A. Guilt Phase Issues\n\n              1. Background regarding “witness intimidation” comments by the\n                  prosecutor, evidence, and related jury instruction\n          Dyer and Meeks were eyewitnesses to defendant‟s shooting of Hicks,\nArmstrong, and Boyd. But neither Dyer nor Meeks immediately identified\ndefendant to the police as the shooter. Both refused to cooperate with law\nenforcement at various points in time and told investigators that they could not\nidentify the shooter. In his guilt phase opening statement, the prosecutor\nacknowledged that the case had taken a long time to come to trial, but told the jury\n\n\n                                            32\n\fthat the explanation would lie in the evidence of “threats,” “fear,” and\n“intimidation” of the witnesses, which would explain their reluctance to come\nforward and speak with police. The prosecutor referred to there being in the case a\n“theme” of such threats, intimidation, and fear.\n       The prosecutor elaborated that Dyer was himself a gang member, that he\ninitially did not want to get involved, and that he came forward and identified\ndefendant as the shooter only at the urging of the victims‟ family members. The\nprosecutor explained that when Dyer was subsequently asked to identify defendant\nat a lineup, Dyer was being held in custody with defendant and knew that it was\nvery dangerous to testify against another inmate. The prosecutor said that Dyer\nwas frightened and then intimidated when he encountered defendant and was told\nby him that defendant had a relative who was a deputy sheriff. According to the\nprosecutor, Dyer did not identify defendant in the 1995 lineup and later told lies to\nthe defense investigator because of his fear. The prosecutor told the jury that\nyears later, when the investigation was reopened, Dyer “felt bad‟ about not\nidentifying defendant in 1995 because “the victims were friends of his.” Dyer\nrevealed to prosecution investigators that he had been threatened and that the\nthreats and intimidation he felt were the reasons for his earlier refusal to identify\ndefendant.\n       Continuing his opening statement, the prosecutor told the jury that Meeks\nwas very afraid back in 1994 and 1995, consuming a lot of drugs, and hence\nreluctant to talk to the police. She did not want to get involved, and did not want\nto get Dyer involved. But, the prosecutor explained, Meeks also had a change of\nheart. She had been sent to prison on a drug charge and while she was in prison,\nshe turned her life “completely around.” According to the prosecutor, Meeks\nexplained to investigating detectives that she felt she had “to do the right thing”\nand that she knew who the shooter was because he had been just a few feet away\n\n                                          33\n\ffrom her. She told investigators that in the past she had been afraid to identify\ndefendant for several reasons. The prosecutor explained those reasons as follows:\n“[Meeks‟s] family had been threatened back in 1994 and 1995. They had found\nout — someone had found out her address of her cousin and where her cousin\nlived and they received phone calls, and it was made quite clear to her that she\n[should] not say anything when she went to court. And she kept that promise until\nshe went to prison, got off drugs and got back straightening her life up, and now\nshe has indicated the identification of the defendant.”\n       The prosecutor further told the jury that “this concept of fear and\nretaliation” would also come up with respect to other witnesses. He proceeded to\nvery briefly describe the anticipated testimony of Johnson and Fennelle. The\nprosecutor then warned the jurors that they might see witnesses who might not\nwant to testify and who were very afraid to testify, but suggested it was “in the\nnature of these types of cases.”\n\n           2. Defendant’s claims\n       Defendant complains on appeal that the prosecutor, by these comments,\n“poisoned” the jury against a fair assessment of his defense that these witnesses\nwere not credible. He contends that the prosecutor impermissibly vouched for\nDyer and Meeks when he described their change of heart. And, he argues, the\nprosecutor‟s accusations, express and implied, that defendant was involved in this\ncampaign of intimidation were prejudicial because they were never substantiated.\nEmbedded in his claims regarding the prosecutor‟s opening statement are\ncontentions regarding the admissibility of the witness intimidation evidence, the\ntrial court‟s related consciousness of guilt instruction, and the prosecution‟s\nclosing argument. By his failure to object and raise the claims he now asserts,\n\n\n\n\n                                          34\n\fdefendant forfeited his contentions on appeal. As we explain, they are meritless in\nany event.\n       Most of defendant‟s claims assert prosecutorial misconduct. The principles\nof law applicable to a defendant‟s claims of prosecutorial misconduct are well\nsettled. “ „ “A prosecutor‟s conduct violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the\nfederal Constitution when it infects the trial with such unfairness as to make the\nconviction a denial of due process. Conduct by a prosecutor that does not render a\ncriminal trial fundamentally unfair is prosecutorial misconduct under state law\nonly if it involves the use of deceptive or reprehensible methods to attempt to\npersuade either the trial court or the jury.” [Citation.] When a claim of\nmisconduct is based on the prosecutor‟s comments before the jury, as all of\ndefendant‟s claims are, “ „the question is whether there is a reasonable likelihood\nthat the jury construed or applied any of the complained-of remarks in an\nobjectionable fashion.‟ ” [Citation.] To preserve a claim of prosecutorial\nmisconduct for appeal, a defendant must make a timely and specific objection and\nask the trial court to admonish the jury to disregard the improper argument.\n[Citation.]‟ [Citation.] A failure to timely object and request an admonition will\nbe excused if doing either would have been futile, or if an admonition would not\nhave cured the harm.” (People v. Linton (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1146</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1205.)\n       As the Attorney General notes, defendant never objected at trial to any of\nthe prosecutor‟s comments that he now asserts are prejudicial. Nothing suggests\nan objection would have been futile or an admonition inadequate to cure any harm.\nThus, his claim of misconduct during the opening statement is forfeited. (People\nv. Tully (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">952</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1011.)\n       Moreover, the comments were not improper. “The function of an opening\nstatement is not only to inform the jury of the expected evidence, but also to\nprepare the jurors to follow the evidence and more readily discern its materiality,\n\n                                         35\n\fforce, and meaning.” (People v. Dennis (1998) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1111213\"><a href=\"/opinion/1111213/people-v-dennis/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">468</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 518.) Here, the\nprosecutor‟s statements sought to prepare the jurors for the anticipated testimony\nof Dyer, Meeks, Johnson, and Fennelle and to offer in advance a possible\nexplanation for their long delay in cooperating with law enforcement, their\ninconsistent statements to investigators, and any current reluctance to testify.\n       We do not agree with defendant‟s claim that the prosecutor failed to state\nthe facts correctly or that his comments were unsubstantiated by the evidence\nadmitted at trial. Dyer testified that he failed to immediately identify defendant as\nthe shooter because Dyer was himself a gang member and a gang member would\nbe labeled a “snitch” if he spoke to the police about a gang-related crime, even if\nthe crime was committed by a rival gang against the member‟s own gang. Dyer\ntestified that he was afraid to talk to the police about the shooting, and did not\nwant to get involved, because people — inferentially other gang members —\nwould try to hurt him. Defendant concedes that this testimony was admissible.\n       Dyer testified that he changed his mind about keeping silent after several\nfamily members of Hicks and Boyd convinced him to tell the police what he knew\nabout the killing of his friends. He identified defendant as the shooter in a\nphotographic lineup at that time. But he was subsequently taken into custody and\nheld in the same facility as defendant. Dyer testified that because he was afraid of\nwhat could happen to him in jail if he was labeled a snitch, he did not identify\ndefendant when he was asked to view a live lineup. He testified that he was later\ntaken by a sheriff‟s deputy, whom defendant identified as his cousin, to an office\nwhere defendant was waiting. Defendant had a copy of Dyer‟s earlier interview\nstatement to police identifying defendant as the shooter, which defendant showed\nto Dyer. According to Dyer, defendant told him not to say anything and offered to\narrange for Dyer to be transferred to a safe facility as long as Dyer did not identify\ndefendant as the shooter. Dyer told defendant he had not identified him in the live\n\n                                          36\n\flineup and assured defendant he did not intend to “tell on [him].” Dyer testified\nthat he was concerned that if his interview statement “[got] around the jail” he\ncould be hurt or killed and he knew he could not cooperate with the prosecution\nonce he was incarcerated. According to Dyer, he received threats both before and\nafter the lineup. During the time he remained in custody, including the time he\nspent at a CYA facility, Dyer continued to deny knowledge of the shooting.\n       Defendant did not object to the admission of Dyer‟s testimony, which in\nany event was properly admitted at trial. “As we have recognized, „[e]vidence that\na witness is afraid to testify or fears retaliation for testifying is relevant to the\ncredibility of that witness and is therefore admissible. [Citations.] An explanation\nof the basis for the witness‟s fear is likewise relevant to [his] credibility and is\nwell within the discretion of the trial court. [Citations.]‟ ” (People v. Mendoza\n(2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1056</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1084.) Dyer‟s testimony substantiated the prosecutor‟s\nopening comments.\n       Defendant claims, however, that the prosecutor‟s comments were\ninaccurate and prejudicial because Dyer never testified that he was intimidated by\ndefendant before he failed to identify defendant in the live lineup, and in\ndefendant‟s view, any fear Dyer felt was not due to defendant‟s action or any\naction authorized by him. It was unnecessary, however, for Dyer‟s fear to be\ndirectly linked to defendant in order for it to be admitted for purposes of assisting\nthe jury in determining his credibility. (People v. Williams (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n270; People v.

(People v. Abel (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"844212\"><a href=\"/opinion/844212/people-v-abel/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">891</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 924-925.)\n       Furthermore, although it appears that Dyer‟s fear was partially due to the\ngeneral risk of gang retaliation and retribution from other inmates if he cooperated\n\n                                            37\n\fwith law enforcement and identified defendant as the shooter, Dyer also testified\nthat he was intimidated and frightened by defendant directly. Specifically, Dyer\ntestified that he was brought by a sheriff‟s deputy, whom defendant identified as\nhis cousin, to an office in the jail to meet with defendant. Dyer testified that\ndefendant had in his possession and showed Dyer a copy of Dyer‟s previous\ninterview statement to police. Defendant then offered to arrange a transfer for\nDyer to a safe facility if Dyer continued to keep silent about what he witnessed.\nImplied in this encounter was a threat by defendant to publicize Dyer‟s police\ninterview statement to the inmate population, thereby labeling him as a snitch, if\nDyer did not maintain his silence. Defendant‟s actions and comments also\nemphasized to Dyer the risk of any return to cooperation with law enforcement\nand intimated that he (defendant) had power over Dyer‟s movements, housing and\nsafety while Dyer was in custody. Contrary to defendant‟s claim, the jury could\ndetermine from Dyer‟s testimony that defendant successfully intimidated and\nfrightened Dyer. Defendant‟s direct involvement in persuading Dyer of the risk of\nbeing a witness distinguishes the circumstances of this case from Dudley v.\nDuckworth (7th Cir. 1988) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">854</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, on which defendant relies because\nDudley involved third party threats unconnected to the defendant. (See People v.\nWilliams (1997) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1172635\"><a href=\"/opinion/1172635/people-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 212.) In anticipation of Dyer‟s admissible\ntestimony, the prosecutor‟s opening statement did not improperly connect\ndefendant to Dyer‟s fear.\n       In a related claim, defendant complains of the prosecutor‟s closing\nargument referencing defendant‟s threats and intimidation of Dyer in jail and\nDyer‟s fear of retaliation while he was being held in custody. His failure to object\nforfeited his claim, which is also meritless. Because the evidence was properly\nadmitted, the prosecutor‟s closing argument constituted fair comment on the\n\n\n\n                                          38\n\fevidence and fell within the permissible bounds of argument. (People v. Williams\n(2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">630</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 674.)\n       We likewise reject defendant‟s further related contention that his right to\ndue process was violated when the trial court instructed the jury with the\nconsciousness of guilt instruction, CALJIC No. 2.06. The testimony of Dyer\nregarding his meeting with defendant in jail supported the use of CALJIC\nNo. 2.06, which informed the jury that if it found defendant attempted to suppress\nevidence against himself, “such as by the intimidation of a witness,” it could\nconsider that as a circumstance tending to show consciousness of guilt.\n       We also find no impropriety in the prosecutor‟s opening comments\nregarding Meeks. Defendant did not object to the evidence that Meeks was afraid\nto cooperate with police because of her concern for her own and her family‟s\nsafety. Like the testimony of Dyer, her testimony was admissible in any event\nbecause it was relevant to her credibility. Again, contrary to defendant‟s\nargument, it was unnecessary for the prosecution to establish that defendant was\nconnected to the phone call to Meeks‟s family warning Meeks to keep silent in\norder for Meeks‟s testimony concerning the phone call to be admissible. (People\nv. Williams, supra, 58 Cal.4th at p. 270; People v. Mendoza, supra, 52 Cal.4th at\np. 1087.) Because the prosecutor could in good faith anticipate the admission of\nsupporting testimony, the prosecutor was entitled to comment in his opening\nstatement on Meeks‟s fear of retaliation.\n       We reject defendant‟s additional claim that the prosecutor impermissibly\nvouched for the credibility of Dyer and Meeks in his opening statement by\nasserting that they “had” changed their lives, instead of stating that they “claimed”\nto have changed their lives. The prosecutor‟s comments appropriately anticipated\nthe testimony of Dyer and Meeks and there is no reasonable likelihood that the\njury would have understood the comments as vouching for these witnesses‟\n\n                                         39\n\fcredibility based on the prosecutor‟s personal belief.

Defendant failed,\nhowever, to object on this ground, which would properly have been overruled in\nany case. Johnson and Fennelle, both former gang members who were\nincarcerated at the time of trial, agreed to testify against defendant, their former\nfriend and fellow gang member. Their willingness to do so despite a legitimate\nbasis for concern about their safety enhanced their credibility. (People v.

(People\nv. Williams, supra, 58 Cal.4th at p. 270; People v. Mendoza, supra, 52 Cal.4th at\np. 1087.)\n       Defendant has failed to show any error in the prosecution‟s introduction of\nand comment on evidence of witness intimidation and fear of retaliation. Nor was\nthere any instructional error related to such evidence.\n\n       B. Penalty Phase Issues\n\n            1. Admission of victim impact testimony relating to aggravating\n                evidence of uncharged crimes\n       Over defense objection, a number of the victims of the uncharged robberies\ncommitted by defendant and his companions were allowed to testify regarding the\nimpact of those crimes on their lives. Melissa Lopez testified to the traumatic\n\n\n                                          40\n\feffect on her of the robbery of the Pacific Marine Credit Union. Jasper Altheide\nand Moira Philley, two of the tellers at the Vandenberg Federal Credit Union,\ntestified to the continuing negative impacts on their lives, not only from the\nrobbery but also from witnessing the killing of Christine Orciuch. In addition to\nthe robbery victims, Orciuch‟s son Quentin testified to the painful effects on him\ncaused by his mother‟s sudden death at the credit union. Orciuch‟s husband\nChester likewise testified about the suffering he and his family experienced as a\nresult of his wife‟s death. He described the difficulties he faced as a single parent\nand the residual emotional effect on him of her death.\n       Defendant recognizes that we have held that victim impact evidence related\nto a defendant‟s uncharged crimes is admissible under section 190.3, factor (b).\n(People v.

The circumstances of defendant‟s uncharged violent criminal conduct,\nincluding its direct impact on the victims of that conduct, was relevant to the\njury‟s penalty determination and its admission did not render defendant‟s trial\nconstitutionally unfair.\n\n           2. Alleged prosecutorial misconduct in penalty phase closing\n               arguments\n       Defendant contends the prosecutor committed prejudicial misconduct\nduring his closing argument in the penalty phase by (1) suggesting that the\ntestimony of Beverly Parks regarding the childhood abuse of defendant by his\ngrandmother was unreliable because defendant‟s sisters did not testify and confirm\n\n\n                                         41\n\fsuch abuse, and (2) arguing that a verdict of life without the possibility of parole\nwould reward defendant with a “freebie” for Orciuch‟s death and the other\naggravating crimes. We reject defendant‟s claims.\n       We earlier set forth the applicable standard of review for claims of\nprosecutorial misconduct at the guilt phase. (See ante, pt. II.A.2.) The same\nstandard applies to asserted misconduct at the penalty phase. (People v.

Prosecutor’s argument regarding defendant’s mitigating\n                   evidence of childhood abuse by his grandmother\n       Defendant presented evidence in mitigation that when he stayed as a child\nwith his maternal grandmother, Amy Parks, he was verbally and physically abused\nby her. During closing argument, the prosecutor told the jury that he found it\ninteresting that defendant‟s aunt, Beverly Parks, was the only person in the\nhousehold who came into court to testify that the grandmother beat defendant.\nThe prosecutor argued that Beverly Parks was a woman “who [did not] like the\ngrandmother to begin with” and that she was, therefore, “somewhat of a suspect\nwitness.” The prosecutor asked the jury to consider her demeanor during her\ntestimony and asserted that “[s]he testified to a few things that she didn‟t even\nobserve, that she had heard, but you saw her answers, so you have to weigh how\nmuch that evidence really means and you also have to consider the fact that no one\nelse from that household — her daughters, Mrs. Parks‟s daughters didn‟t testify\nand they were there. Jimmy Parks, her husband, didn‟t testify, and he could have\ntestified that the grandmother beat on defendant, nor did any of the defendant‟s\nsisters testify that the grandmother mistreated the defendant.” Acknowledging\nthat it was up to the jury to evaluate the testimony, the prosecutor explained he\nwas pointing this out “because I think there is a certain suspicion you should have\n\n\n\n\n                                          42\n\fregarding that testimony, especially in light of all the other witnesses that could\nhave testified.” Defendant did not object to any of these comments.\n       After the jury reached a verdict of death, defendant filed a motion for a new\npenalty phase trial. He contended, in part, that he was entitled to a new trial\nbecause the prosecutor argued that defendant‟s sisters failed to corroborate the\ntestimony of Beverly Parks when in fact the prosecutor was in possession of\nreports of interviews that defendant‟s sisters gave to defense investigators, which\nverified the abuse of defendant by their grandmother. Copies of the reports were\nattached to the motion and at the hearing on the motion, the prosecutor stipulated\nthat the reports were received by his office as part of discovery. The trial court\ndenied the new trial motion, concluding that any error that may have occurred in\nthe prosecutor‟s argument would not have affected the outcome of the case in light\nof the circumstances of the crimes and the additional evidence in aggravation.\n       Defendant now reasserts his contention that the prosecutor committed\nprejudicial misconduct by knowingly arguing a false inference that defendant‟s\nsisters would not have confirmed their grandmother‟s abuse of defendant had they\ntestified. He relies on, among other cases, Berger v. United States (1935) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">78</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 88, People v.

Defendant claims that the prosecutor‟s comments\npurported to tell the jury why these sisters were not called as witnesses by the\ndefense and what their testimony would have been, thereby depriving defendant of\nhis Sixth Amendment right to confront and cross-examine witnesses.

Nothing in the record suggests that an objection would have\nbeen futile or that an admonition would have failed to cure any harm.

Specifically, defendant‟s godmother\ntestified about the grandmother‟s “evilness” and corroborated Beverly Parks‟s\ndescription of the grandmother‟s verbal abuse of defendant and his sister\nLarhonda. Second, defendant submitted evidence of other serious physical\nmistreatment that he received during childhood at the hands of his mother, his\nmother‟s husband and his mother‟s boyfriend. And finally, the circumstances of\nthe triple murder were egregious and the additional evidence in aggravation was\nextensive. In light of the totality of the evidence before the jury, we agree with the\ntrial court that there was no reasonable possibility the jury would have reached a\nmore favorable verdict in the absence of this argument. (People v. Gonzales\n(2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">894</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 953 [the reasonable possibility standard of prejudice\napplies to the evaluation of the effect of improper argument at the penalty phase].)\n\n                b. Prosecutor’s argument that murder of Orciuch would be a\n                    “freebie” if the jury did not return a verdict of death\n       Defendant contends that the prosecutor committed prejudicial misconduct\nin the penalty phase by arguing that a death verdict was required in order to punish\ndefendant for the murder of Christine Orciuch during the Vandenberg Federal\nCredit Union robbery, and that a verdict of life without the possibility of parole\nwould reward defendant with a “freebie” for Orciuch‟s death and the other\n\n\n                                         44\n\faggravating crimes. Defendant asserts that aggravating evidence of a defendant‟s\nother violent conduct is admitted under section 190.3, factor (b), not to punish the\ndefendant for the factor (b) conduct, but to help the jury determine the appropriate\npenalty for the special circumstance murder. Moreover, he alleges, the prosecutor\nknew it was false to imply defendant would escape punishment for the murder of\nOrciuch because the prosecutor was aware that defendant had been convicted of\nthat crime and received a sentence of life without the possibility of parole. Some\nadditional background is necessary to properly consider defendant‟s contentions.\n       The prosecutor started his closing remarks with an overview of the penalty\nissue before the jury. The prosecutor then discussed his view of the statutory\nmitigating factors, which he contended were either inapplicable or lacked\npersuasive support. Moving on to the aggravating factors, the prosecutor started\nwith section 190.3, factor (a), emphasizing how horrible were the execution-style\nmurders committed by defendant. He noted that once defendant murdered Hicks\nand Boyd, the penalty that defendant faced was either life in prison without the\npossibility of parole or the death penalty. The prosecutor characterized a sentence\nof life without the possibility of parole as the minimum sentence and urged the\njury to reach a death verdict, contending that the circumstances of the killing of\nHicks and Boyd were in themselves “substantial enough to outweigh the\nmitigating factors.” The prosecutor argued that if, however, the jury determined\nthat the circumstances of the two murders were not enough to warrant a death\nsentence, there was the third murder to consider. The prosecutor contended that\ndefendant deserved additional punishment for Armstrong‟s murder and asked the\njury not to treat Armstrong‟s murder as “a freebie.”\n       The prosecutor then turned to discuss defendant‟s attempted murder of\nHernandez and carjacking of Gonzalez, arguing that if the jury was not convinced\n\n\n\n                                         45\n\fdefendant deserved the death penalty for the three earlier murders, these additional\ncrimes justified a death verdict.\n       The prosecutor next reviewed the evidence of defendant‟s felony conviction\nand his other violent crimes, including the two credit union robberies, emphasizing\nthat defendant repeatedly engaged in criminal conduct when he was incarcerated\nand soon after each time he was released. In the course of summarizing the\nevidence of the Vandenberg Federal Credit Union robbery and discussing\ndefendant‟s responsibility for the crimes directly committed by his companions,\nthe prosecutor stated the following: “I will stop at this point again and say the\nsame thing I said earlier. If all the previous aggravating evidence doesn‟t\noutweigh the mitigating evidence, another robbery and another murder certainly\ndo. And if you choose the other direction, then you are basically saying this is a\nfreebie, we are not going to impose any additional punishment on this defendant\nfor the murder of Christine Orciuch. We are still going to give him life in prison\nwithout the possibility of parole. This is a freebie.” The prosecutor then resumed\nreview of defendant‟s other violent criminal conduct, focusing on his conduct\nwhile he was held in custody. Going back to “the same theme” he mentioned\nbefore, the prosecutor argued in summary that “all these other additional crimes,\nthe additional crimes that — of the robberies, the carjackings, the other bank\nrobberies, all of these are just additional, . . . additional, additional and additional\ncrimes. And if you are to decide that life without the possibility of parole is the\ncorrect verdict, you are basically going to say, as I mentioned before, this is a\nfreebie, the defendant gets this free. The murder of Christine Orciuch, we are just\ngoing to ignore that.” The prosecutor emphasized that the aggravating evidence\nreflected “a collage of an extremely violent history, violence and greed” and\nargued that defendant did not deserve the jury‟s sympathy or mercy. Throughout\n\n\n\n                                           46\n\fhis argument, the prosecutor continued to use the language of comparison and\nweight of the circumstances in urging that a death verdict was justified. (§ 190.3.)\n       In his final argument, the prosecutor again addressed the mitigating\nevidence presented by defendant and urged the jury to conclude that it did not\nestablish that defendant deserved sympathy. He repeated that defendant was\neligible for the death penalty because he had committed two murders and claimed\nthat the defense wanted the jury to ignore all the other aggravating evidence. The\nprosecutor asserted that the defense “wants to say, no, just give him the minimum,\njust give him a freebie, give him a freebie on the third murder, on the attempted\nmurders, on the robberies, on all of the other crimes of violence, we are not going\nto punish you anymore. We will just stop at the two murders.” The prosecutor\nconcluded by urging the jury to impose the death penalty as the “fair” and “just”\npenalty that defendant deserved.\n       Defendant did not object to the prosecutor‟s arguments, including any of\nthe “freebie” comments. Defendant raised this claim of prosecutorial misconduct\nonly in his postverdict application for a new trial, which, as mentioned earlier, the\ntrial court denied. Once again, defendant has forfeited the claim on appeal by\nfailing to timely object and request an admonition from the trial court. (People v.\nLinton, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 1205.) Moreover, we are not persuaded that the\nprosecutor committed misconduct in his argument, or that, if any misconduct\noccurred, it was prejudicial.\n       “ „To prevail on a claim of prosecutorial misconduct based on remarks to\nthe jury, the defendant must show a reasonable likelihood the jury understood or\napplied the complained-of comments in an improper or erroneous manner.\n[Citations.] In conducting this inquiry, we “do not lightly infer” that the jury drew\nthe most damaging rather than the least damaging meaning from the prosecutor‟s\nstatements.‟ ” (People v. Dykes (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2625630\"><a href=\"/opinion/2625630/people-v-dykes/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 771-772.) Here, the\n\n                                         47\n\fprosecutor‟s lengthy argument, viewed as a whole, built on defendant‟s eligibility\nfor a death sentence after his commission of the murders of Hicks and Boyd. It\nessentially contended that defendant deserved the death penalty for the charged\ntriple murders because of the totality of the circumstances of the killing of Hicks,\nBoyd, and Armstrong when considered in light of all the aggravating evidence of\ndefendant‟s violent conduct before and after those three murders. (People v.\nStanley (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1213708\"><a href=\"/opinion/1213708/people-v-stanley/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">764</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 822.)\n       We have recognized as appropriate a similar prosecutorial argument urging\nthat three murders warranted a death verdict to avoid a “freebie” for the third\nmurder. (People v. Rogers (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1801741\"><a href=\"/opinion/1801741/people-v-rogers/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1136</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1174 & fn. 23.) Defendant\ncontends, however, that “[w]hile it may be appropriate to make such a freebie\nargument with regard to a third murder directly committed by a defendant . . . , it\nis improper to make this „freebie‟ argument with regard to factor (b) crimes, as the\nprosecutor did here.” Although it is possible a prosecutor‟s use of the term\n“freebie” in connection with section 190.3, factor (b), evidence might in a\nparticular case mislead a jury regarding its proper focus under section 190.3 in\nreaching a penalty verdict, and a prosecutor should be particularly careful in this\nregard, we are not convinced the prosecutor‟s argument in this case crossed the\nline into misconduct. In the context of the entirety of the prosecutor‟s argument,\nthe jury would likely have understood him to be contending that when defendant‟s\ninvolvement in the Vandenberg Federal Credit Union robbery and murder of\nOrciuch and the other factor (b) evidence was added to the jury‟s consideration of\nthe appropriate penalty for the three murder convictions, a death verdict was all\nthe more warranted — not that it was the jury‟s responsibility to impose separate\npunishment on defendant for Orciuch‟s murder.\n       Furthermore, here the jury was instructed about how to properly evaluate\nthe evidence submitted in aggravation and mitigation. (CALJIC Nos. 8.85, 8.87,\n\n                                         48\n\f8.88.) The jury also was instructed that in the penalty phase of trial it could be\ninfluenced by pity or sympathy for defendant, allowing the jury to view\ndefendant‟s mitigating evidence as compassionately as it wished. The jury was\nspecifically told that statements made by the attorneys during the trial do not\nconstitute evidence, and that it must accept and follow the law as stated by the trial\ncourt. (CALJIC Nos. 1.02, 8.84.1.) We presume the jury followed the trial\ncourt‟s instructions. (People v. Harris (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">804</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 852.) And we\nconclude that in light of the totality of the evidence presented at the penalty phase,\nthere is no reasonable possibility that the jury would have returned a different\npenalty verdict absent the prosecutor‟s “freebie” argument concerning Orciuch‟s\nmurder. (People v. Gonzales, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 953.)\n\n           3. Alleged penalty phase instructional errors\n\n                a. Instructing the jury with CALJIC No. 8.85\n       CALJIC No. 8.85 instructs the jury regarding the aggravating and\nmitigating factors listed in section 190.3, factors (a) through (k), which, if\nrelevant, the jury must consider in deciding the penalty to be imposed on a capital\ndefendant. Defendant asserts the instruction is constitutionally flawed because (1)\nit fails to instruct the jury as to which of the listed sentencing factors may be\nconsidered aggravating and which may be considered mitigating and (2) it uses the\nrestrictive modifiers “extreme” and “substantial” in describing the sentencing\nfactor of defendant‟s mental or emotional disturbance. As defendant recognizes,\nwe have repeatedly rejected these contentions. (See e.g., People v. Lindberg\n(2008) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 50-51; People v.

(See, e.g.,\nPeople v.

Instructing the jury with CALJIC No. 8.88\n       The jury was given CALJIC No. 8.88 concerning how to consider and\nweigh the mitigating and aggravating evidence. Defendant claims the instruction\nviolated his rights under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to\nthe federal Constitution. As defendant concedes, we have previously considered\nand rejected these arguments. We do so again because defendant fails to persuade\nus that our prior decisions were erroneous.\n       Thus, we repeat that CALJIC No. 8.88 is not “ „unconstitutional for failing\nto require the jury to return a verdict of life should it determine the mitigating\ncircumstances outweigh the aggravating ones.‟ ” (People v. Suff (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1013</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1078; accord, People v.

The\ninstruction “is not constitutionally defective for failing to inform the jury that it\nhas the discretion to impose a sentence of life without the possibility of parole\neven in the absence of mitigating circumstances.” (People v. Linton, supra, 56\nCal.4th at p. 1211.) CALJIC No. 8.88 “is not overly vague for using the words „so\nsubstantial‟ as a modifying phrase.” (People v. Hovarter, supra, at p. 1028.) The\ninstruction “is not flawed for providing that the jury should choose the penalty that\nis „warranted‟ rather than „appropriate.‟ ” (Ibid.)\n       CALJIC No. 8.88 is not flawed for failing to assign to the People the\nburden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of an aggravating\nfactor or that the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors.

The instruction is\nnot unconstitutional for failing to inform the jury that the prosecution bears some\nburden of persuasion at the penalty phase. (People v.

DeHoyos, supra, 57 Cal.4th at p. 150.)\n\n                                           51\n\f       “The trial court‟s failure to inform the jury that there is a presumption of\nlife does not violate a defendant‟s constitutional rights to due process, to be free\nfrom cruel and unusual punishment, to a reliable determination of his sentence,\nand to equal protection of the law under the Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the federal Constitution.” (People v. McKinnon (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"844251\"><a href=\"/opinion/844251/people-v-mckinnon/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">610</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 698.)\n\n                 c. Failing to instruct the jury about the meaning of life without the\n                     possibility of parole\n       Defendant argues that neither CALJIC No. 8.88 nor any other instruction\ninformed the jury that a sentence of life without the possibility of parole meant\ndefendant would never be considered for parole. He maintains that the trial court\nhad a duty to instruct on its own motion concerning “the true meaning of this\nsentence.” “We repeatedly have held, however, that trial courts are not required\n— either upon request, or on the court‟s own motion — to instruct that a sentence\nof life without possibility of parole will inexorably be carried out, because such an\ninstruction would be an incorrect statement of the law. [Citations.] We likewise\nhave rejected the suggestion that Simmons v. South Carolina (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\nand its progeny mandate such an instruction.

We have held that CALJIC No. 8.84, which was given\nin this case, adequately informs the jury that a defendant sentenced to life without\nthe possibility of parole is ineligible for parole. (People v. Duenas (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 28.) We are not persuaded to revisit these prior holdings.\n\n             4. Cumulative effect of guilt and penalty phase errors\n       Defendant contends that the cumulative effect of the guilt and penalty phase\nerrors requires reversal of the judgment. We have concluded that defendant\nforfeited many of his claims of error. In any event, we have either rejected the\nmerits of defendant‟s claims or found that any error, assumed solely for purposes\n\n\n                                          52\n\fof argument, was harmless.

Constitutionality of California’s capital sentencing statutes\n       Contrary to the claim of defendant, “ „California does not employ the death\npenalty as a “ „regular punishment for substantial numbers of crimes‟ ” [citation],\nand its imposition does not violate international norms of decency or the Eighth\nAmendment‟s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.‟ ” (People v.\nDeHoyos, supra, 57 Cal.4th at p. 151.) And “ „[r]eview for intercase\nproportionality‟ is not required by the federal Constitution.” (Ibid.)\n\n            6. International Law\n       Defendant contends imposition of the death penalty violates international\nlaw and asks us to reconsider our previous rejection of this claim. We decline to\ndo so and repeat that “California‟s death penalty law does not violate international\nlaw. We reach this conclusion taking into consideration defendant‟s assertions\nthat the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights binds state courts and\nthat international legal norms are among the evolving standards of decency used to\ndefine the scope of the Eighth Amendment to the federal Constitution.
