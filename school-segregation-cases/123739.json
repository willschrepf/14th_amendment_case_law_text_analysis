Based on this\n\nalleged violation, the plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages, as well as an\n\ninjunction requiring the District of Columbia to re-establish emergency shelter housing in\n\n\n\n       1\n                The papers reviewed in connection with this matter include the following:\nthe defendant’s motion to dismiss, or, in the alternative, for summary judgment (“MSJ”)\n[Dkt.

In an earlier\n\ndecision denying the District’s motion to dismiss this claim, the Court concluded that the\n\nplaintiffs had plausibly stated a prima facie claim for disparate impact based on race\n\nunder the FHA. See Boykin v. Gray, 895 F. Supp. 2d 199, 211-14 (D.D.C. 2012).\n\nHaving already analyzed the plaintiffs’ claim under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of\n\nCivil Procedure, and no new arguments having been proffered supporting dismissal, the\n\nCourt will address only the defendant’s arguments for summary judgment.\n\n\n                                  I. LEGAL STANDARD\n\n               A motion for summary judgment must be granted if “the pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the\n\naffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the\n\nmovant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477\n\nU.S. 242, 248 (1986); see FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a), (c). A disputed fact is “material” if it\n\n“might affect the outcome of a suit under governing law.” Holcomb v. Powell, 433 F.3d\n\n889, 895 (D.C. Cir. 2006). A dispute over a material fact is “genuine” if it could lead a\n\nreasonable jury to return a verdict in favor of the nonmoving party. See Scott v. Harris,\n\n550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007); Holcomb v. Powell, 433 F.3d at 895. A court making this\n\ndetermination must avoid making any credibility evaluations of its own and must weigh\n\nthe evidence presented by each party in the light most favorable to the opposing party.\n\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. at 255; Czekalski v. Peters, 475 F.3d 360, 363\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2007).\n\n               An opposition to a motion for summary judgment must point to genuine\n\nissues of material fact supported by competent evidence beyond mere supposition.\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fMatsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986); see Smith\n\nv. Janey, 664 F. Supp. 2d 1, 7 (D.D.C. 2009) (“The non-moving party’s opposition . . .\n\nmust consist of more than mere unsupported allegations or denials and must be supported\n\nby affidavits, declarations or other competent evidence setting forth specific facts\n\nshowing there is a genuine issue for trial.”). If the non-movant’s evidence is “merely\n\ncolorable” or “not significantly probative,” summary judgment may be granted.\n\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. at 249-50; see Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. at 380\n\n(“Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the\n\nnonmoving party, there is ‘no genuine issue for trial.’”) (quoting Matsushita Elec. Indus.\n\nCo. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. at 587). “[S]ummary judgment is required ‘against a\n\nparty who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element\n\nessential to that party’s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at\n\ntrial.’” Paige v. DEA, 665 F.3d 1355, 1358 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (quoting Celotex Corp. v.\n\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986)).\n\n\n                                      II. DISCUSSION\n\n                    A. Disparate Impact Under the Fair Housing Act\n\n               In its earlier decision analyzing the plaintiffs’ race-based disparate impact\n\nclaim under a Rule 12(b)(6) standard, the Court articulated the basic governing legal\n\nframework. There, the Court noted that the D.C. Circuit is the only court of appeals that\n\nhas not yet decided on the availability of disparate impact claims under the FHA. Boykin\n\nv. Gray, 895 F. Supp. 2d at 211. Each of the other eleven circuits has held that the statute\n\naffords plaintiffs the ability to prove FHA violations on the theory of disparate impact.\n\n2922 Sherman Ave. Tenants’ Ass’n v. Dist. of Columbia, 444 F.3d 673, 679 (D.C. Cir.\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f2006). On two occasions, our circuit has analyzed such claims under the assumption that\n\nthey are cognizable, without deciding the question. See Greater New Orleans Fair\n\nHousing Action Ctr. v. U.S. Dept. of Housing & Urban Dev., 639 F.3d 1078, 1085-88\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2011); 2922 Sherman Ave. Tenants’ Ass’n v. Dist. of Columbia, 444 F.3d at\n\n678-82. 2\n\n               Other circuits have established a considerable body of case law analyzing\n\ndisparate impact claims based on race under the FHA. These cases have developed two\n\nvariants of disparate impact theory: “disproportionate effect” and “segregative effect.”\n\nBoykin v. Gray, 895 F. Supp. 2d at 211-14. Under the first, “to prove a disparate impact\n\nclaim . . . a plaintiff must first demonstrate that the challenged policy or practice has a\n\ndisproportionate effect on a protected class.” Id. at 211 (quoting 2922 Sherman Ave.\n\nTenants’ Ass’n v. Dist. of Columbia, 444 F.3d at 679). Under the second, “if [a decision]\n\nperpetuates segregation and thereby prevents interracial association it will be considered\n\ninvidious under the Fair Housing Act independently of the extent to which it produces a\n\ndisparate effect on different racial groups.” Id. at 213 (quoting Graoch Assocs. # 33, L.P.\n\nv. Louisville/Jefferson Cnty. Metro Human Relations Comm’n, 508 F.3d 366, 378 (6th\n\nCir. 2007)).\n\n               Demonstrating disparate impact under either framework, however, does\n\nnot lead immediately to a defendant’s liability under the FHA. Rather, after a plaintiff\n\n       2\n                On February 15, 2013, the United States Department of Housing and\nUrban Development issued a final rule establishing that disparate impact claims are\ncognizable under the FHA. 78 Fed. Reg. 11460 (Feb. 15, 2013) (codified at 24 C.F.R.\n§ 100.500 (2013)). On June 17, 2013, the Supreme Court granted certiorari on this same\nquestion. Petition for Writ of Certiorari, Township of Mt. Holly, N.J. v. Mt. Holly\nGarden Citizens in Action, Inc., (No. 11-1507), granted in part by 133 S. Ct. 2824 (2013)\n(granting certiorari on Question 1: “Are disparate impact claims cognizable under the\nFair Housing Act?”).\n\n\n                                              4\n\fhas successfully proved a prima facie case, a court will then examine the defendant’s\n\nconduct to determine whether there is sufficient justification for the disparate impact\n\ncaused. There are “two leading tests” for this second step of the disparate impact inquiry\n\nunder the FHA. See Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Ctr. v. U.S. Dept. of\n\nHousing & Urban Dev., 639 F.3d at 1085. The Second Circuit has adopted a “burden-\n\nshifting framework: once the plaintiff demonstrates that the challenged practice has a\n\ndisproportionate impact, the burden shifts to the defendant to ‘prove that its actions\n\nfurthered, in theory and in practice, a legitimate, bona fide governmental interest and that\n\nno alternative would serve that interest with less discriminatory effect.’” 2922 Sherman\n\nAve. Tenants’ Ass’n v. Dist. of Columbia, 444 F.3d at 680 (quoting Huntington Branch,\n\nNAACP v. Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d 926, 935-36 (2d Cir.), aff’d on other grounds,\n\n488 U.S. 15 (1988)). Under the Seventh Circuit’s approach, the court engages in a “four-\n\nfactor balancing test” in which it considers “(1) the strength of the plaintiff’s showing of\n\ndiscriminatory effect; (2) whether any evidence indicates discriminatory intent; (3) the\n\ndefendant’s interest in taking the challenged action; and (4) whether the plaintiff seeks to\n\ncompel the defendant to affirmatively provide housing to a protected class or merely to\n\nrestrain the defendant from interfering with individual property owners who wish to\n\nprovide such housing.” Id. (citing Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp. v. Village of\n\nArlington Heights, 558 F.2d 1283, 1290 (7th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1025\n\n(1978)). “Our circuit has noted, however, that in some cases ‘the success of plaintiffs’\n\nclaim doesn’t turn on the details of the legal test’ because ‘either approach requires proof\n\nof disproportionate impact, measured in some plausible way.’” Boykin v. Gray, 895 F.\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\fSupp. 2d at 211 (quoting Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Ctr. v. U.S. Dept. of\n\nHousing & Urban Dev., 639 F.3d at 1085).\n\n               At the motion to dismiss stage, the Court concluded that the plaintiffs had\n\npresented factual allegations that fell within the contours of a cognizable prima facie\n\nclaim under both variants of disparate impact theory. Boykin v. Gray, 895 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n211-14. The District of Columbia now argues that the plaintiffs have not offered\n\nevidence sufficient to support a reasonable jury’s finding that the closure of La Casa\n\nShelter caused a significant disparate impact — either disproportionate or segregative —\n\non African Americans and Hispanics. See MSJ at 13-18. In addition, the District argues\n\nthat even if the plaintiffs were able to make out a prima facie case, the District’s decision\n\nto close La Casa does not violate the FHA under the tests of either the Second or the\n\nSeventh Circuits. Id. at 18-23.\n\n\n                                  B. Disproportionate Effect\n\n               Our court of appeals has emphasized that success on a disparate impact\n\nclaim “requires proof of disproportionate impact, measured in some plausible way.”\n\nGreater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Ctr. v. U.S. Dept. of Housing & Urban Dev.,\n\n639 F.3d at 1085. With that said, “no single test controls in measuring disparate impact.”\n\nLanglois v. Abington Housing Authority, 207 F.3d 43, 50 (1st Cir. 2000) (citing Watson\n\nv. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U.S. 977, 995-96 n.3 (1988)); see also Hallmark\n\nDevelopers, Inc. v. Fulton Cnty., Ga., 466 F.3d 1276, 1286 (11th Cir. 2006). The Court\n\nhas previously noted that, in this case, a seemingly applicable framework for analyzing\n\nthe plaintiffs’ claim derives from decisions that “have held that where the population\n\nrelying on or in need of housing assistance is disproportionately composed of racial\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\fminorities, a decision adversely affecting the availability of that assistance has a\n\ndisproportionate impact on a protected class.” See Boykin v. Gray, 895 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n211-12 (citing cases from several courts of appeals); see also Gallagher v. Magner, 619\n\nF.3d 823, 833 (8th Cir. 2010) (establishing a prima facie case “requires showing ‘that the\n\nobjected-to action[s] result[ed] in . . . a disparate impact upon protected classes compared\n\nto a relevant population’”) (quoting Darst-Webbe Tenant Ass’n Bd. v. St. Louis Housing\n\nAuth., 417 F.3d 898, 902 (8th Cir. 2005)) (alterations in original). In the specific context\n\nof this case, then, the test becomes, “[i]f a disproportionately high percentage of the\n\nhomeless population in Washington, D.C., is minority, then action by the District\n\nadversely affecting that population could [make out a prima facie] claim for disparate\n\nimpact.” Id. at 212.\n\n                Accordingly, the plaintiffs focus the Court’s attention on the fact that\n\nAfrican Americans and Hispanics are overrepresented in the District’s homeless\n\npopulation, compared to these groups’ collective representation in the general population\n\nof Washington, D.C. See Opp. at 5, 13. Although the plaintiffs fail to cite to portions of\n\nthe record on which this assertion is based, there is indeed evidence in the record to\n\nsupport it. The defendant, in its statement of material facts as to which it asserts there are\n\nno genuine issues, provides a relevant statistic, noting that “87.2% of the men served in\n\nshelters within the District of Columbia from May through October 2010 were African\n\nAmerican or Hispanic.” Def.’s Stmt. of Material Facts ¶ 3. 3 This percentage is to be\n\n\n\n        3\n                 The District correctly points out, Reply at 3, that the plaintiffs have failed\nto comply with Local Civil Rule 7(h), which requires that oppositions to motions for\nsummary judgment “be accompanied by a separate concise statement of genuine issues\nsetting forth all material facts as to which it is contended there exists a genuine issue\nnecessary to be litigated, which shall include references to the parts of the record relied\n\n\n                                               7\n\fcompared to data from the 2010 U.S. Census showing that 61.3% of the District’s general\n\npopulation self-identifies as either African American or Hispanic. Id. ¶ 5. Based on this\n\ncomparison, the plaintiffs argue that the closure of La Casa exerted a disproportionate\n\nadverse impact on African Americans and Hispanics.\n\n               At first glance, the plaintiffs’ argument may bear similarity to the types of\n\ndisparities that have led to findings of disproportionate effect in some other cases. But\n\nupon closer scrutiny, it becomes evident that their simple comparison — unaccompanied\n\nby any further statistical evidence or analysis — does not provide the basis for such a\n\nfinding in this case. Cf. Gallagher v. Magner, 619 F.3d at 837 (“Statistics to prove\n\ndiscrimination ‘come in infinite variety and . . . their usefulness depends on all of the\n\nsurrounding facts and circumstances.’”) (quoting Int’l Brotherhood of Teamsters v.\n\nUnited States, 431 U.S. 324, 340 (1977)) (alteration in original). The fundamental defect\n\nin the plaintiffs’ argument is that the adverse impact of which they complain was suffered\n\nnot by the entire homeless population in the District of Columbia, nor even by a\n\nsignificant portion of its more than 6,000 members. See Def.’s Stmt. of Material Facts\n\n¶ 4 (stating results of annual Point in Time count for 2010). Rather, the loss of La Casa\n\nShelter — which had just ninety beds — was felt by a much smaller subset of that\n\npopulation. This sort of “analytical cherry picking” pushes the disparate impact doctrine\n\ntoward a level of granularity at which it loses its meaning. See Greater New Orleans Fair\n\nHousing Action Ctr. v. U.S. Dept. of Housing & Urban Dev., 639 F.3d at 1087. As the\n\nD.C. Circuit has explained in an analogous context:\n\n\n\non to support the statement.” LOC. CIV. R. 7(h). Accordingly, the Court may treat factual\nassertions contained in the defendant’s statement as conceded. See McGaughey v. Dist.\nof Columbia, 740 F. Supp. 2d 23, 30 (D.D.C. 2010).\n\n\n                                              8\n\f       If the economic profiles of racial groups differ from parish to parish in the\n       parts of Louisiana affected by hurricanes Katrina and Rita, then a grant\n       formula that has non-disparate racial effects for Louisiana as a whole can\n       easily have a disparate impact on African-American residents in at least\n       some individual parishes (not to mention smaller geographic units). To\n       allow plaintiffs to pick a special subset of the affected localities to test for\n       disparate impact would, just like allowing them to single out [] the effects\n       of a single formula element, expose almost any grant formula to litigation.\n       Although plaintiffs focus much of their case on Orleans Parish, we must\n       consider the impact on Louisiana as a whole.\n\nId. at 1086.\n\n               Similarly here, the shuttering of La Casa Shelter cannot be considered in\n\nisolation from its circumstances. To do so ignores a crucial characteristic of the law of\n\ndisparate impact, which is its focus on facially neutral policies that systematically exert\n\ndiscriminatory effects within the population to which they apply. See, e.g., Gallagher v.\n\nMagner, 619 F.3d at 834 (“The first component of [plaintiffs’] prima facie case is an\n\nidentifiable, facially-neutral policy or practice.”); Tsombanidis v. West Haven Fire Dept.,\n\n352 F.3d 565, 574 (2d Cir. 2003) (“Disparate impact analysis focuses on facially neutral\n\npolicies or practices that may have a discriminatory effect.”); Oti Kaga, Inc. v. S.D.\n\nHousing Dev. Auth., 342 F.3d 871, 883 (8th Cir. 2003) (a plaintiff “must show a facially\n\nneutral policy has a significant adverse impact on members of a protected minority\n\ngroup”).\n\n               The D.C. Circuit has usefully explained the distinction between discrete\n\nacts that affect individuals or small groups, and policies that are generally applicable and\n\nthus the more appropriate object of disparate impact analysis. In 2922 Sherman Ave.\n\nTenants’ Ass’n v. Dist. of Columbia, 444 F.3d at 676-78, several tenants’ groups alleged\n\nthat the District, in executing a policy to aggressively enforce the city’s housing code —\n\ndubbed the Hot Properties Initiative — subjected Hispanic residents to both disparate\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\ftreatment and disparate impact in violation of the FHA. At trial, the tenants of one\n\nbuilding, located at 1512 Park Road, prevailed on their disparate impact claim. The court\n\nof appeals, in articulating the plaintiffs’ theory of the case, clarified that “the policy the\n\ntenants’ disparate impact claim challenges is not the closing of 1512 Park Road — hardly\n\na policy, in any event — but the Hot Properties Initiative, specifically the use of the Hot\n\nProperties List to determine which buildings to close. Under the tenants’ theory of the\n\ncase, the closing of 1512 Park Road is significant because it constitutes the injury they\n\nsuffered as a result of the Hot Properties Initiative.” Id. at 680 (citation omitted).\n\n                The court analogized to the paradigm example of disparate impact in the\n\nemployment context, where an employer “refus[es] to hire a single individual based on\n\nthe results of an allegedly discriminatory test.” 2922 Sherman Ave. Tenants’ Ass’n v.\n\nDist. of Columbia, 444 F.3d at 680; see also id. at 679 (discussing Griggs v. Duke Power\n\nCo., 401 U.S. 424 (1976), the “seminal case” on disparate impact). Such a plaintiff\n\nwould not be required to show that the employer’s refusal to hire her “disproportionately\n\naffected her protected class,” as “such an inquiry would make little sense where the\n\nemployer’s action affected only one person.” Id. Rather, the plaintiff would have to\n\ndemonstrate that the policy that led to her individual injury — that is, the administration\n\nof the test — caused a disparate impact on the protected class. Id.; cf. Huntington\n\nBranch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d at 934 (“There is always some\n\ndiscrete event . . . which touches off litigation challenging a neutral rule or policy.”).\n\n                Here, the plaintiffs have failed to offer evidence that proves the existence\n\nof any more general policy or practice that has adversely affected the District’s homeless\n\npopulation, of which the closure of La Casa was a constituent part. They have failed to\n\n\n\n\n                                               10\n\fshow, for example, that this event was representative of a general decrease in the\n\navailability of shelter for homeless residents of the city; they have simply pointed to the\n\nloss of ninety beds of shelter housing in one location, where they had been accustomed to\n\nstaying. In addition, many of the plaintiffs, in declarations submitted in support of their\n\nclaim, have acknowledged their having found lodging in other shelters in the city after La\n\nCasa was shut down. See Pls.’ Exhs. 1-2 [Dkt. Nos. 74-1, 74-2].\n\n               The District, for its part, has argued that the closure of La Casa Shelter did\n\noccur as part of a broader shift in the District’s policy toward its homeless citizens — but\n\nthat the effects of this policy for the disproportionately minority homeless population\n\nhave been, on the whole, positive rather than adverse. Specifically, it asserts that it has\n\nbeen pursuing a transition toward placing Permanent Supportive Housing (“PSH”) —\n\nrather than emergency shelters — at the center of its approach to serving homeless\n\nresidents. To support this assertion, it offers declarations from the District’s top official\n\nin charge of homeless shelters, as well as an excerpt from the District’s budget\n\njustification to the federal government for fiscal year 2011. See Swan Declaration No. 1;\n\nSwan Declaration No. 2; Budget Justification. The defendant has also offered evidence\n\nthat between 2008 and 2010, the number of beds available to homeless persons in the\n\nDistrict actually increased, due to its placement of over 600 men into Permanent\n\nSupportive Housing, balanced against its closure of two shelters, Franklin School and La\n\nCasa, which removed 390 beds from the District’s shelter system. See Swan Dec. No. 1\n\n¶ 7. Finally, the District describes its plans for future expansion of the PSH program,\n\nwhich includes constructing 45 PSH apartments adjacent to the former location of La\n\nCasa. Swan Dec. No. 2 ¶ 4.\n\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\f               Although the plaintiffs have criticized the District’s implementation of the\n\nPSH program on various grounds, they have not rebutted this evidence with evidence of\n\ntheir own. In their Second Amended Complaint, for example, the plaintiffs state that the\n\nPSH program has been operated without transparency, and that former residents of La\n\nCasa have been placed in housing that is distant from necessary social services. 2d Am.\n\nCompl. ¶¶ 69-71. In their opposition to the District’s motion for summary judgment,\n\nhowever, they do not point to or proffer any evidence that counters the District’s\n\nassertion, supported by a declaration from the responsible official, that the PSH program\n\nhas yielded a net increase in the availability of housing for the homeless population.\n\nInstead, the plaintiffs repeatedly emphasize their disagreement with the analytical\n\napproach offered by the defendant, and assert that they will be able to prove\n\ndisproportionate effect at some future time, perhaps with the aid of an expert. See Opp.\n\nat 5, 9-14. But the standard for summary judgment requires the plaintiffs to put forth\n\ncompetent evidence now, see Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475\n\nU.S. at 586, to make “a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element\n\nessential” to the proof of their case. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. at 322; see FED.\n\nR. CIV. P. 56(c). As the Court has explained, the plaintiffs point to no evidence currently\n\nin the record — other than the disproportionate representation of minorities in the\n\nDistrict’s homeless population — to demonstrate their ability to make such a showing.\n\nRather, they have shown only that a very small subset of the homeless population was\n\ndeprived of housing in one location.\n\n               As this Court noted in its earlier decision, the most relevant cases from the\n\ncourts of appeals “involve government action affecting all persons within a community\n\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fwho need low-income housing, and . . . these cases do not necessarily apply with equal\n\nforce to government action that affects a much smaller portion of the community.”\n\nBoykin v. Gray, 895 F. Supp. 2d at 212 n.11. 4 The seminal Village of Arlington Heights\n\ncase, for example, involved a challenge to the defendant village’s refusal to rezone\n\nproperty on which the plaintiffs intended to build low-income housing. Metropolitan\n\nHousing Dev. Corp. v. Village of Arlington Heights, 558 F.2d at 1285-86. Although the\n\nparticular housing development at issue involved just 190 townhouse units, the village’s\n\nzoning decision would violate the FHA, the court held, if it “effectively foreclose[d] the\n\nconstruction of any low-cost housing within its corporate boundaries.” Id. at 1285-86.\n\nThe court’s decision was also based in part on the fact that the proposed development\n\n“would create a substantial number of federally subsidized low-cost housing units” in a\n\nvillage that “remain[ed] almost totally white in a metropolitan area with a significant\n\npercentage of black people.” Id. at 1288. Similarly, in Keith v. Volpe, 858 F.2d 467 (9th\n\nCir. 1988), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 813 (1989), the district court had found that the\n\ndefendant city’s failure to construct two housing developments “seriously jeopardize[d]\n\nthe ability of a large number of minority residents to continue residing in [the City of\n\nHawthorne].” Id. at 483.\n\n               In Huntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d at 928,\n\nthe plaintiffs challenged the defendant town’s refusal to permit the construction of\n\nsubsidized housing outside of an “urban renewal area.” The particular controversy\n\ninvolved just one proposed subsidized apartment complex, but the lawsuit implicated the\n\n       4\n                The Court added that, “[t]he smaller the affected population . . . the less\nreadily it can be said that a racially disproportionate effect within that population affects\nhousing options for the racial group as a whole.” Boykin v. Gray, 895 F. Supp. 2d at\n212-13 n.11.\n\n\n                                              13\n\fvalidity of the restrictive zoning ordinance generally. See id. at 928-29, 937-38.\n\nAccordingly, to determine disproportionate effect, the court considered town-wide\n\nstatistics showing that African Americans were much more likely to depend on affordable\n\nrental housing. Id. at 929. A significant compounding factor in the court’s reasoning\n\ninvolved the segregative effect of restricting low-income housing construction to an area\n\nwith a high concentration of minority residents, particularly given that the town of\n\n200,000 people was 95% white. See id.\n\n                Although the precise number of affected individuals relevant to the inquiry\n\nin this case is a matter of dispute between the parties, it is clear that the plaintiffs cannot\n\nseriously contend that the closure of La Casa exerted an adverse impact on the full\n\nhomeless population of the city, let alone that it has significantly restricted housing\n\noptions for people of color more generally. 5 Indeed, as the District has argued, while the\n\nplaintiffs and their fellow regulars at La Casa were adversely affected by the loss of this\n\nparticular shelter, other homeless residents of Washington, D.C. — also\n\ndisproportionately African American and Hispanic — had been afforded increased access\n\nto housing due to the District’s policies. See Swan Dec. No. 1 ¶ 7 (describing net\n\nincrease in availability of housing for homeless persons between 2008 and 2010, despite\n\nclosure of La Casa in October 2010).\n\n\n\n\n        5\n                The District identifies 114 individuals for this part of the analysis, which\nis the number of men who stayed at La Casa during the month preceding its closure. MSJ\nat 14 (citing Swan Declaration No. 2 ¶ 2). The plaintiffs do not dispute the accuracy of\nthis measure, but they disagree with its materiality, arguing that the appropriate statistical\nanalysis would include the “hundreds if not thousands of minority . . . men” who were\nserved by La Casa during its existence, as well as an indeterminate amount of people who\nmight be affected currently and in the future by its loss. Opp. at 7-8.\n\n\n\n                                               14\n\f               To summarize, although the plaintiffs’ claim seems to fall within the broad\n\noutlines of disproportionate effect doctrine, given the disproportionately minority\n\nhomeless population in the District of Columbia at large and in its shelters, the plaintiffs\n\nhave not provided statistical information — or any evidence, for that matter — beyond\n\nthat which was available at the motion to dismiss stage. In particular, they have not\n\nprovided statistical argument or evidence to counter the District’s evidence;\n\nconsequently, there is nothing on which a reasonable jury could base a finding that the\n\nclosure of La Casa Shelter constituted or was representative of a broader adverse impact\n\nsuffered by the homeless population of Washington, D.C. See Frito-Lay, Inc. v.\n\nWilloughby, 863 F.2d 1029, 1033 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (“[T]he Supreme Court has\n\nunambiguously declared that the nonmoving party must ‘go beyond the pleadings and by\n\n[its] own affidavits, or by the depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on\n\nfile designate specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.’”) (quoting\n\nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. at 324) (alteration in original) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). The Court does not doubt that for the men who considered La Casa to be\n\ntheir home, its removal was painful and disruptive to their lives; but this fact does not\n\nconstitute evidence that a protected class of persons has been disproportionately affected\n\nin a manner cognizable under the FHA.\n\n\n                                    C. Segregative Effect\n\n               The plaintiffs have also stated a claim under an alternative method of\n\nproving disparate impact, which requires demonstrating that a defendant’s action\n\n“perpetuates segregation and thereby prevents interracial association.” Boykin v. Gray,\n\n895 F. Supp. 2d at 213 (quoting Graoch Assocs. # 33, L.P. v. Louisville/Jefferson Cnty.\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\fMetro Human Relations Comm’n, 508 F.3d at 378). As this Court has previously\n\nexplained, the plaintiffs’ basic argument is that the closure of La Casa fits into a pattern\n\nof the District’s pushing homeless persons from the northwest quadrant of Washington —\n\nwhich holds its highest concentration of white residents — into the northeast and\n\nsoutheast quadrants of the city, which have predominantly African American populations.\n\nId. at 213. At the motion to dismiss stage, the plaintiffs made this claim without much\n\nevidentiary support, apart from demographic information about the racial composition of\n\nthe District’s various neighborhoods, alongside assertions — supported by declarations\n\n— that some former La Casa residents had been displaced to shelters located in areas\n\nwith high concentrations of minority residents. See id. at 213-14. Although these factual\n\nallegations were sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,\n\nthe Court warned the plaintiffs that “[w]ith respect to any segregative effect theory,\n\nproving the displacement of homeless persons will not suffice; rather, the plaintiffs will\n\nneed to demonstrate that the closure of La Casa had a measurable impact on the racial\n\ncomposition of the city’s wards or neighborhoods.” Id. at 214.\n\n               As the District points out in its motion for summary judgment, however,\n\nthe plaintiffs have failed to produce evidence on which a reasonable jury could make\n\nsuch a finding of measurable impact. MSJ at 15. The plaintiffs continue to rely primarily\n\non the bare fact that La Casa was closed, and that the remaining low-barrier shelters for\n\nhomeless men are located in predominantly minority areas. See Opp. at 5-9; Pls. Exh. 5\n\n[Dkt. No. 84-1]. Although the Court considered this scenario sufficient to state a\n\nplausible claim for segregative effect under a motion to dismiss standard, summary\n\njudgment should be granted if the plaintiffs’ evidence is “merely colorable” or “not\n\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\fsignificantly probative,” as is the case here. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477\n\nU.S. at 249-50.\n\n               To be sure, the plaintiffs argue that La Casa’s closure took place within a\n\nbroader context of “displacement across the city,” Opp. at 7, which includes the District’s\n\nclosure of the Franklin School Shelter in 2008, the District’s placement of homeless\n\npersons in Permanent Supportive Housing apartments located in predominantly minority\n\nareas, as well as the shifting demographics of the city. See id. at 5-11; Pls.’ Exh. 5 [Dkt.\n\nNo. 42-2]. But the plaintiffs have failed to put forth the kind of supporting material that\n\nwould demonstrate an ability to prove that La Casa’s closure caused “a measurable\n\nimpact on the racial composition of the city’s wards or neighborhoods,” Boykin v. Gray,\n\n895 F. Supp. 2d at 214, such as by, for example, “showing that the numbers of homeless\n\nindividuals in Wards 1 and 2 have significantly decreased, with a commensurate increase\n\nin the number of homeless residents of Ward 8,” or “track[ing] . . . the dispersal of the\n\nindividuals who used to populate La Casa.” Opinion, Boykin v. Fenty, Civil Action No.\n\n10-1790 (Dec. 17, 2010), at 9 (denying the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary\n\ninjunction). In addition, the District claims, with some evidentiary support, that it is\n\nestablishing PSH apartments in more integrated areas, including on a portion of the site\n\nwhere La Casa used to stand. See Swan Declaration No. 2 ¶ 4.\n\n               In short, the plaintiffs have not supplemented the record with any\n\nadditional probative evidence since surviving the District’s motion to dismiss. Although\n\nthey continue to describe a scenario in which the District’s actions could plausibly\n\nperpetuate segregation, they have failed to produce any evidence on the basis of which a\n\nreasonable jury could find that such segregation has actually resulted from the closure of\n\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\fLa Casa, even considered in concert with the closure of the Franklin shelter and the\n\nimplementation of the PSH program. This failure means that their claim cannot\n\nwithstand a motion for summary judgment, given that “a disparate impact claim . . .\n\nrequire[s] plaintiffs to establish that the challenged policy actually had a disparate\n\nimpact.” 2922 Sherman Ave. Tenants’ Ass’n v. Dist. of Columbia, 444 F.3d at 684; see\n\nalso Pfaff v. U.S. Dept. of Housing & Urban Dev., 88 F.3d 739, 746 (9th Cir. 1996) (“To\n\nestablish a prima facie case of discrimination without intent, the charging party must\n\n‘prove the discriminatory impact at issue; raising an inference of discriminatory impact is\n\ninsufficient.’”) (quoting Palmer v. United States, 794 F.2d 534, 538-39 (9th Cir. 1986)).\n\n\n         D. The Seventh and Second Circuits’ Tests for Liability Under the FHA\n\n               Although the Court concludes that the plaintiffs have failed to provide\n\nsufficient evidence on which a reasonable jury could find that they have proved their\n\nprima facie case, the Court also determines that, even if they had done so, the District\n\nwould be entitled to judgment as a matter of law. “[T]he establishment of a prima facie\n\ncase, by itself, is not enough to establish liability under the FHA.” Mt. Holly Garden\n\nCitizens in Action, Inc. v. Township of Mt. Holly, 658 F.3d 375, 385 (3d Cir. 2011), cert.\n\ngranted,133 S. Ct. 2824 (2013); see also Langlois v. Abington Housing Auth., 207 F.3d\n\nat 50; Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp. v. Village of Arlington Heights, 558 F.2d at\n\n1290 (“[W]e refuse to conclude that every action which produces discriminatory effects\n\nis illegal. Such a per se rule would go beyond the intent of Congress and would lead\n\ncourts into untenable results in specific cases.”). Accordingly, the courts of appeals have\n\ndeveloped analytical frameworks for examining practices that produce disparate effects,\n\nto determine whether a defendant’s causing such an effect warrants liability under the\n\n\n\n                                             18\n\fFHA. As our own circuit has noted, there are “two leading tests,” emanating from the\n\nSecond and Seventh Circuits. See Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Ctr. v. U.S.\n\nDept. of Housing & Urban Dev., 639 F.3d at 1085. The District of Columbia, in its\n\nmotion for summary judgment, argues that it prevails under either approach. See MSJ at\n\n18-23. The Court agrees.\n\n\n                       1. The Second Circuit’s Burden-Shifting Test\n\n               In Huntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d at\n\n935-39, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit drew from\n\nemployment discrimination jurisprudence, as well as from an earlier Third Circuit case\n\nunder the FHA, to establish a burden-shifting approach for determining ultimate liability\n\nunder the statute. The court held that, “once the plaintiff demonstrates that the\n\nchallenged practice has a disproportionate impact, the burden shifts to the defendant to\n\n‘prove that its actions furthered, in theory and in practice, a legitimate, bona fide\n\ngovernmental interest and that no alternative would serve that interest with less\n\ndiscriminatory effect.’” 2922 Sherman Ave. Tenants’ Ass’n v. Dist. of Columbia, 444\n\nF.3d at 680 (quoting Huntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d at\n\n935-36).\n\n               Here, the District of Columbia advances two justifications for its\n\nchallenged conduct. First, the District claims that it had no choice other than to close La\n\nCasa and vacate the premises, because the underlying land was owned by a private entity,\n\nDonatelli Development. MSJ at 19-21. Second, it argues that closing La Casa was done\n\npursuant to the District’s implementation of its Strategic Action Plan to End\n\nHomelessness, which, according to the defendant, represents the considered policy\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\fjudgment of the District’s government as to how it can best serve its homeless\n\npopulation. Id. at 21-22. The plaintiffs respond that “PSH programs were never intended\n\nto be mutually exclusive with the existence of low barrier shelters,” and argue further that\n\nthe arrangement of PSH placements for some homeless persons does not mitigate the\n\nneed for low-barrier shelters to exist within the city. Opp. at 14-16. In addition, the\n\nplaintiffs assert that the existence of “any less discriminatory alternatives the District may\n\nhave had remains a jury question.” Id. at 14.\n\n                The District’s first argument is not supported by the evidence in the\n\nrecord. Although it is true that, at the time of La Casa’s closure in 2010, the land on\n\nwhich the shelter stood was owned by Donatelli Development, the plaintiffs note —\n\ncorrectly, it seems — that this situation stems from the District’s own sale of the land to\n\nDonatelli in 2008. See 2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 46-47; Special Warranty Deed (conveying\n\nproperty to Donatelli for consideration of $10.00). Thus, viewing the evidence in the\n\nlight most favorable to the plaintiffs, a reasonable jury could find that the District’s first\n\njustification fails as a “bona fide governmental interest,” as the District apparently chose\n\nto sell the property with the knowledge that Donatelli intended to develop the land, which\n\nwould, of course, necessitate La Casa’s removal.\n\n                The District’s second justification — that it closed the shelter pursuant to\n\nits broader policy on homelessness — has more merit. When a disparate impact claim\n\nunder the Fair Housing Act implicates government policy, the question is whether the\n\nchallenged action furthers a legitimate, bona fide governmental interest or policy and that\n\nno alternative would further that interest or policy with less discriminatory effect. See\n\n2922 Sherman Ave. Tenants’ Ass’n v. Dist. of Columbia, 444 F.3d at 680 (citing\n\n\n\n\n                                              20\n\fHuntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d at 935-36); Langlois v.\n\nAbington Housing Authority, 207 F.3d at 51 (applying a variant of the Second Circuit’s\n\nburden-shifting test, which requires a showing “that a demonstrated disparate impact in\n\nhousing be justified by a legitimate and substantial goal of the measure in question”).\n\n               The present case exemplifies the difficulties inherent in such an inquiry.\n\nThe District of Columbia has argued that it is pursuing a long-term shift in its strategy for\n\naddressing homelessness, and, specifically, that the core element of this movement is to\n\ntransition homeless persons away from reliance on emergency shelters and into\n\nPermanent Supportive Housing placements. MSJ at 22; Swan Declaration No. 1 ¶¶ 5-8;\n\nBudget Justification at 33-39 (describing “the District’s goal of ending homelessness, by\n\nshifting from providing emergency services, in trailers, to the construction of homes\n\nintegrated with services to meet the needs of the resident population”). In addition, the\n\nDistrict has asserted that, given “limited fiscal resources for the homeless services\n\nprogram,” any funds directed toward re-opening emergency shelter housing would\n\nnecessarily draw money away from “other critically needed homeless services programs\n\nincluding the [PSH program].” Swan Declaration No. 1 ¶ 12. In sum, the District argues\n\nthat its elected officials and administrative agencies “are best positioned to make policy\n\njudgments and to allocate resources to determine how best to meet the needs of their\n\nconstituents.” MSJ at 21.\n\n               The plaintiffs present a compelling point in response: placing some\n\nhomeless residents into Permanent Supportive Housing does not preclude the\n\nmaintenance of an adequate level of emergency shelter availability. Opp. at 14-16.\n\nAssuming that any reduction in shelter space exerts a disparate impact on minorities, it\n\n\n\n\n                                             21\n\ffollows that this adverse effect can be lessened by simply keeping all of the District’s\n\nshelters open, while simultaneously expanding the PSH program. See id. At the very\n\nleast, the plaintiffs argue, whether a less discriminatory alternative exists is a factual\n\nquestion, appropriate for resolution by a jury. Id. at 14. But the plaintiffs’ argument\n\ndirectly implicates two main elements of the District’s homelessness policy: the shift\n\nfrom emergency shelters to Permanent Supportive Housing, and the necessity of making\n\ntradeoffs between various types of services for homeless citizens, given limited\n\nresources. The District has submitted a declaration from Fred Swan, the official\n\nresponsible for overseeing the city’s shelter program, in which he asserts that low-barrier\n\nshelters such as La Casa can perpetuate chronic homelessness, whereas by moving people\n\ninto Permanent Supportive Housing, the District can further its goal of helping them\n\nescape homelessness and achieve self-sufficiency. Swan Declaration No. 1 ¶¶ 5-8. He\n\nalso states that budget concerns dictate tradeoffs between different services for the\n\nhomeless. Id. ¶ 12. The plaintiffs offer no evidence in response to Mr. Swan’s\n\ndeclaration.\n\n                In cases where courts — applying the Second Circuit’s balancing test or\n\nvariants thereof — have found there to be genuine issues of material fact as to the\n\nexistence of a less discriminatory alternative, the plaintiffs have offered evidence to\n\nsupport the existence of such alternatives. For example, in Mt. Holly Garden Citizens in\n\nAction, Inc. v. Township of Mt. Holly, 658 F.3d at 377-81, a challenge was brought\n\nagainst the defendant township’s execution of a redevelopment plan for a neighborhood\n\nthat, according to the township, had become blighted. Residents opposed the harsh\n\nmanner of the redevelopment plan, which involved the demolition of a large number of\n\n\n\n\n                                              22\n\fhomes, and argued that they were effectively being pushed out of their own\n\nneighborhood. See id. The township justified its actions as necessary to alleviating\n\nblight; the plaintiffs then produced evidence, in the form of a report from a planning\n\nexpert, “which stated that the ‘blighted and unsafe’ conditions could be remedied in a far\n\nless heavy-handed manner that would not entail the wholesale destruction and rebuilding\n\nof the neighborhood.” Id. at 386. Although the defendant countered with statements\n\nfrom the township manager, the court of appeals held that “[t]hese contrasting statements,\n\nas well as the parties’ continued arguments on appeal as to the cost and feasibility of an\n\nalternative relying on rehabilitation, create genuine issues of material fact that require\n\nfurther investigation.” Id. at 387.\n\n               Similarly, in Gallagher v. Magner, 619 F.3d at 828-30, the plaintiffs were\n\nowners and former owners of rental properties, who alleged that the City of St. Paul’s\n\naggressive enforcement of its housing code led to increased costs for property owners,\n\nwhich contributed to a shortage of affordable housing. The city argued that its\n\nenforcement activities were justified by the goals of “providing minimum property\n\nmaintenance standards, keeping the City clean and housing habitable, and making the\n\nCity’s neighborhoods safe and livable.” Id. at 837. The court concluded that the city’s\n\nconduct was “manifest[ly] relat[ed]” to these “legitimate, non-discriminatory objectives.”\n\nSee id. But at the third step of the analysis, the plaintiffs provided evidence of the\n\nexistence of a less discriminatory alternative by pointing to a progress report from the\n\ncity’s previous program to enforce the housing code, which, according to the plaintiffs,\n\n“embodied a flexible and cooperative approach to code enforcement, which achieved the\n\ngoals of code enforcement while maintaining a consistent supply of affordable housing.”\n\n\n\n\n                                             23\n\fId. at 837-38. The court of appeals concluded that, by providing evidence of the\n\npossibility of a less discriminatory alternative, the plaintiffs had demonstrated the\n\nexistence of “a genuine dispute of fact regarding whether [the former program] was a\n\nviable alternative to the City’s aggressive Housing Code enforcement practices.” Id. at\n\n838.\n\n               As already noted, with respect to the existence of less discriminatory\n\nalternatives, the defendant bears the burden of showing their unavailability. See Mt.\n\nHolly Garden Citizens in Action, Inc. v. Township of Mt. Holly, 658 F.3d at 387. The\n\nDistrict of Columbia has put forth several persuasive arguments as to the necessity of\n\nclosing some emergency shelters as part of its transitioning policy on homelessness.\n\nUnlike the plaintiffs in Mt. Holly and Gallagher, however, the plaintiffs here have not\n\nproduced any sort of substantive analysis or evidentiary material to counter the\n\ndefendant’s justifications. They have done no more than to assert their view that the\n\nDistrict could have kept La Casa Shelter open, while also expanding the availability of\n\nPermanent Supportive Housing. Without more, the Court cannot conclude that a\n\nreasonable jury would have anything on which to base such a finding. See Matsushita\n\nElec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. at 586 (a party opposing summary\n\njudgment must raise genuine issues of material fact supported by competent evidence\n\nbeyond mere supposition).\n\n               Finally, the particular facts of this case place difficult policy judgments\n\ndirectly in issue, and implicate decisions about how the District government allocates\n\nbenefits and burdens through its homelessness policy. As this Court stated in its Opinion\n\ndenying the plaintiffs’ original motion for a preliminary injunction, “the Court has no\n\n\n\n\n                                             24\n\fmeans of arriving at an answer” to the question of “[w]hat type of system best provides\n\n‘meaningful services and shelter’” to the homeless citizens of Washington, D.C.\n\nOpinion, Boykin v. Fenty, Civil Action No. 10-1790 (Dec. 17, 2010), at 12-13 (quoting\n\nthe plaintiffs’ motion). Although it is undoubtedly true that the District government is\n\nbound to uphold the Fair Housing Act in all its activities, including as it pertains to\n\nhomelessness policy, the Court concludes that in this case, given the particular decision at\n\nissue and the District’s asserted justification for taking it — and, most importantly, the\n\nplaintiffs’ failure to offer evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact as to the\n\nexistence of viable alternatives to the closure of La Casa — the District is entitled to\n\nsummary judgment.\n\n\n                   2. The Seventh Circuit’s Four-Factor Balancing Test\n\n                In an early disparate impact case under the FHA, the United States Court\n\nof Appeals for the Seventh Circuit set forth its own four-factor test for determining\n\nliability under the FHA, given a plaintiff’s success in proving its prima facie case. This\n\ntest balances: “(1) the strength of the plaintiff’s showing of discriminatory effect; (2)\n\nwhether any evidence indicates discriminatory intent; (3) the defendant’s interest in\n\ntaking the challenged action; and (4) whether the plaintiff seeks to compel the defendant\n\nto affirmatively provide housing to a protected class or merely to restrain the defendant\n\nfrom interfering with individual property owners who wish to provide such housing.”\n\n2922 Sherman Ave. Tenants’ Ass’n v. Dist. of Columbia, 444 F.3d at 680 (citing\n\nMetropolitan Housing Dev. Corp. v. Village of Arlington Heights, 558 F.2d at 1290).\n\n                Here, with respect to the first factor, the District of Columbia argues that\n\ngiven the small number of people affected by the closure of La Casa, any disparate\n\n\n\n                                               25\n\fadverse impact would be negligible. MSJ at 20. With respect to the second factor, the\n\nDistrict asserts that there is no evidence of discriminatory intent. Addressing the fourth\n\nfactor, it admits to a lack of clarity in its understanding of the plaintiffs’ desired remedy.\n\nId. The central focus of the District’s argument is placed on the third factor — its interest\n\nin taking the action at issue. Unsurprisingly, it offers two justifications for its conduct:\n\nfirst, that it was obligated to vacate the property on which La Casa stood, which was\n\nprivately owned; and second, that closing La Casa was in keeping with the District’s\n\ntransition toward a PSH-focused homelessness policy. The plaintiffs’ basic response\n\nremains that the closure of La Casa was not necessary to the implementation of the\n\nDistrict’s new homelessness plan, and that the need for emergency shelter is still acute.\n\n                 The Court has already explained why the plaintiffs’ prima facie case must\n\nfail under either a disproportionate effect or segregative effect theory. For much the\n\nsame reasons, the Court concludes that even if the plaintiffs have made some showing of\n\ndisparate impact, it is exceedingly weak. With respect to the second factor, this Court has\n\npreviously determined that the plaintiffs’ evidence could not justify an inference of\n\ndiscriminatory intent, and therefore dismissed their claim for disparate treatment based on\n\nrace. Boykin v. Gray, 895 F. Supp. 2d at 207-09. Since that dismissal, the plaintiffs have\n\nnot supplemented the record with any new evidence that would change this\n\ndetermination.\n\n                 The third factor in the analysis requires the Court to evaluate the quality\n\nand strength of the District’s interest in closing La Casa. As already noted, supra at 20,\n\nthe District’s contention that it had no choice but to close La Casa is undermined by\n\nevidence showing that the District itself sold the underlying land to Donatelli\n\n\n\n\n                                              26\n\fDevelopment in 2008. But as also discussed, the District has described its conduct as a\n\nnecessary element of its broader policy on homelessness. It has argued that the decision\n\nto close La Casa was part of an ongoing transition away from emergency shelters and\n\ntoward Permanent Supportive Housing. Weighing the District’s interest in taking the\n\nparticular action at issue here would require the Court to pass judgment on this policy and\n\nthe allocation of costs and benefits it entails. Moreover, as explained supra at 24, the\n\nplaintiffs have not offered any evidentiary support for their argument that La Casa’s\n\nclosure was not necessary to the District’s implementation of its plan. In sum, the\n\nDistrict has offered persuasive support for the proposition that its interest in moving\n\nresources from emergency shelters to Permanent Supportive Housing is strong, that\n\ndecreasing people’s dependence on emergency shelter housing is a part of that effort, and\n\nthat the specific decision to close La Casa occurred as an element of this broader\n\ngovernmental policy. The Court concludes, on the basis of the record before it, that the\n\nDistrict’s interest in closing La Casa, viewed in the context of its decision to make a shift\n\nin its approach to homelessness, outweighs any disparate impact the closure might have\n\ncaused.\n\n               Finally, although the defendant expresses confusion as to what remedy the\n\nplaintiffs seek, it is clear that, beyond compensatory and punitive damages, the plaintiffs\n\nrequest an injunction requiring the re-establishment of low-barrier shelter housing in the\n\nneighborhood where La Casa was located. 2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 80-81, 94-99. Thus, they\n\nseek “to compel the defendant to affirmatively provide housing,” rather than merely to\n\nprevent the defendant from impeding the private development of such housing. See 2922\n\nSherman Ave. Tenants’ Ass’n v. Dist. of Columbia, 444 F.3d at 680. This factor, of\n\n\n\n\n                                             27\n\fcourse, is also embedded in the preceding point about policy choices and the necessity of\n\nmaking difficult tradeoffs in allocating resources to the District’s homelessness program.\n\nIt weighs in favor of the defendant, and, ultimately, strengthens the Court’s conclusion\n\nthat the District is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n\n\n                                    III. CONCLUSION\n\n               For the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant the defendant’s motion to\n\ndismiss, or, in the alternative, for summary judgment.\n\n               An Order consistent with this Opinion will issue this same day.\n\n               SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n                                                       /s/___________________________\n                                                       PAUL L.

The Second Circuit has adopted a “burden-\n\nshifting framework: once the plaintiff demonstrates that the challenged practice has a\n\ndisproportionate impact, the burden shifts to the defendant to ‘prove that its actions\n\nfurthered, in theory and in practice, a legitimate, bona fide governmental interest and that\n\nno alternative would serve that interest with less discriminatory effect.’” 2922 Sherman\n\nAve. Tenants’ Ass’n v.

In the specific context\n\nof this case, then, the test becomes, “[i]f a disproportionately high percentage of the\n\nhomeless population in Washington, D.C., is minority, then action by the District\n\nadversely affecting that population could [make out a prima facie] claim for disparate\n\nimpact.” Id. at 212.\n\n                Accordingly, the plaintiffs focus the Court’s attention on the fact that\n\nAfrican Americans and Hispanics are overrepresented in the District’s homeless\n\npopulation, compared to these groups’ collective representation in the general population\n\nof Washington, D.C. See Opp. at 5, 13. Although the plaintiffs fail to cite to portions of\n\nthe record on which this assertion is based, there is indeed evidence in the record to\n\nsupport it. The defendant, in its statement of material facts as to which it asserts there are\n\nno genuine issues, provides a relevant statistic, noting that “87.2% of the men served in\n\nshelters within the District of Columbia from May through October 2010 were African\n\nAmerican or Hispanic.” Def.’s Stmt. of Material Facts ¶ 3. 3 This percentage is to be\n\n\n\n        3\n                 The District correctly points out, Reply at 3, that the plaintiffs have failed\nto comply with Local Civil Rule 7(h), which requires that oppositions to motions for\nsummary judgment “be accompanied by a separate concise statement of genuine issues\nsetting forth all material facts as to which it is contended there exists a genuine issue\nnecessary to be litigated, which shall include references to the parts of the record relied\n\n\n                                               7\n\fcompared to data from the 2010 U.S. Census showing that 61.3% of the District’s general\n\npopulation self-identifies as either African American or Hispanic. Id. ¶ 5. Based on this\n\ncomparison, the plaintiffs argue that the closure of La Casa exerted a disproportionate\n\nadverse impact on African Americans and Hispanics.\n\n               At first glance, the plaintiffs’ argument may bear similarity to the types of\n\ndisparities that have led to findings of disproportionate effect in some other cases. But\n\nupon closer scrutiny, it becomes evident that their simple comparison — unaccompanied\n\nby any further statistical evidence or analysis — does not provide the basis for such a\n\nfinding in this case. Cf. Gallagher v. Magner, 619 F.3d at 837 (“Statistics to prove\n\ndiscrimination ‘come in infinite variety and . . . their usefulness depends on all of the\n\nsurrounding facts and circumstances.’”) (quoting Int’l Brotherhood of Teamsters v.\n\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109665\"><a href=\"/opinion/109665/teamsters-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 340 (1977)) (alteration in original). The fundamental defect\n\nin the plaintiffs’ argument is that the adverse impact of which they complain was suffered\n\nnot by the entire homeless population in the District of Columbia, nor even by a\n\nsignificant portion of its more than 6,000 members. See Def.’s Stmt. of Material Facts\n\n¶ 4 (stating results of annual Point in Time count for 2010). Rather, the loss of La Casa\n\nShelter — which had just ninety beds — was felt by a much smaller subset of that\n\npopulation. This sort of “analytical cherry picking” pushes the disparate impact doctrine\n\ntoward a level of granularity at which it loses its meaning. See Greater New Orleans Fair\n\nHousing Action Ctr. v. U.S. Dept. of Housing & Urban Dev., 639 F.3d at 1087. As the\n\nD.C. Circuit has explained in an analogous context:\n\n\n\non to support the statement.” LOC. CIV. R. 7(h).

To\n       allow plaintiffs to pick a special subset of the affected localities to test for\n       disparate impact would, just like allowing them to single out [] the effects\n       of a single formula element, expose almost any grant formula to litigation.\n       Although plaintiffs focus much of their case on Orleans Parish, we must\n       consider the impact on Louisiana as a whole.\n\nId. at 1086.\n\n               Similarly here, the shuttering of La Casa Shelter cannot be considered in\n\nisolation from its circumstances. To do so ignores a crucial characteristic of the law of\n\ndisparate impact, which is its focus on facially neutral policies that systematically exert\n\ndiscriminatory effects within the population to which they apply. See, e.g., Gallagher v.\n\nMagner, 619 F.3d at 834 (“The first component of [plaintiffs’] prima facie case is an\n\nidentifiable, facially-neutral policy or practice.”); Tsombanidis v.

Circuit has usefully explained the distinction between discrete\n\nacts that affect individuals or small groups, and policies that are generally applicable and\n\nthus the more appropriate object of disparate impact analysis. In 2922 Sherman Ave.\n\nTenants’ Ass’n v. Dist. of Columbia, 444 F.3d at 676-78, several tenants’ groups alleged\n\nthat the District, in executing a policy to aggressively enforce the city’s housing code —\n\ndubbed the Hot Properties Initiative — subjected Hispanic residents to both disparate\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\ftreatment and disparate impact in violation of the FHA. At trial, the tenants of one\n\nbuilding, located at 1512 Park Road, prevailed on their disparate impact claim. The court\n\nof appeals, in articulating the plaintiffs’ theory of the case, clarified that “the policy the\n\ntenants’ disparate impact claim challenges is not the closing of 1512 Park Road — hardly\n\na policy, in any event — but the Hot Properties Initiative, specifically the use of the Hot\n\nProperties List to determine which buildings to close. Under the tenants’ theory of the\n\ncase, the closing of 1512 Park Road is significant because it constitutes the injury they\n\nsuffered as a result of the Hot Properties Initiative.” Id. at 680 (citation omitted).\n\n                The court analogized to the paradigm example of disparate impact in the\n\nemployment context, where an employer “refus[es] to hire a single individual based on\n\nthe results of an allegedly discriminatory test.” 2922 Sherman Ave. Tenants’ Ass’n v.\n\nDist. of Columbia, 444 F.3d at 680; see also id. at 679 (discussing Griggs v.

Such a plaintiff\n\nwould not be required to show that the employer’s refusal to hire her “disproportionately\n\naffected her protected class,” as “such an inquiry would make little sense where the\n\nemployer’s action affected only one person.” Id. Rather, the plaintiff would have to\n\ndemonstrate that the policy that led to her individual injury — that is, the administration\n\nof the test — caused a disparate impact on the protected class. Id.; cf. Huntington\n\nBranch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d at 934 (“There is always some\n\ndiscrete event . . . which touches off litigation challenging a neutral rule or policy.”).\n\n                Here, the plaintiffs have failed to offer evidence that proves the existence\n\nof any more general policy or practice that has adversely affected the District’s homeless\n\npopulation, of which the closure of La Casa was a constituent part. They have failed to\n\n\n\n\n                                               10\n\fshow, for example, that this event was representative of a general decrease in the\n\navailability of shelter for homeless residents of the city; they have simply pointed to the\n\nloss of ninety beds of shelter housing in one location, where they had been accustomed to\n\nstaying. In addition, many of the plaintiffs, in declarations submitted in support of their\n\nclaim, have acknowledged their having found lodging in other shelters in the city after La\n\nCasa was shut down. See Pls.’ Exhs. 1-2 [Dkt. Nos. 74-1, 74-2].\n\n               The District, for its part, has argued that the closure of La Casa Shelter did\n\noccur as part of a broader shift in the District’s policy toward its homeless citizens — but\n\nthat the effects of this policy for the disproportionately minority homeless population\n\nhave been, on the whole, positive rather than adverse. Specifically, it asserts that it has\n\nbeen pursuing a transition toward placing Permanent Supportive Housing (“PSH”) —\n\nrather than emergency shelters — at the center of its approach to serving homeless\n\nresidents. To support this assertion, it offers declarations from the District’s top official\n\nin charge of homeless shelters, as well as an excerpt from the District’s budget\n\njustification to the federal government for fiscal year 2011. See Swan Declaration No. 1;\n\nSwan Declaration No. 2; Budget Justification. The defendant has also offered evidence\n\nthat between 2008 and 2010, the number of beds available to homeless persons in the\n\nDistrict actually increased, due to its placement of over 600 men into Permanent\n\nSupportive Housing, balanced against its closure of two shelters, Franklin School and La\n\nCasa, which removed 390 beds from the District’s shelter system. See Swan Dec. No. 1\n\n¶ 7. Finally, the District describes its plans for future expansion of the PSH program,\n\nwhich includes constructing 45 PSH apartments adjacent to the former location of La\n\nCasa. Swan Dec. No. 2 ¶ 4.\n\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\f               Although the plaintiffs have criticized the District’s implementation of the\n\nPSH program on various grounds, they have not rebutted this evidence with evidence of\n\ntheir own. In their Second Amended Complaint, for example, the plaintiffs state that the\n\nPSH program has been operated without transparency, and that former residents of La\n\nCasa have been placed in housing that is distant from necessary social services. 2d Am.\n\nCompl. ¶¶ 69-71. In their opposition to the District’s motion for summary judgment,\n\nhowever, they do not point to or proffer any evidence that counters the District’s\n\nassertion, supported by a declaration from the responsible official, that the PSH program\n\nhas yielded a net increase in the availability of housing for the homeless population.\n\nInstead, the plaintiffs repeatedly emphasize their disagreement with the analytical\n\napproach offered by the defendant, and assert that they will be able to prove\n\ndisproportionate effect at some future time, perhaps with the aid of an expert. See Opp.\n\nat 5, 9-14. But the standard for summary judgment requires the plaintiffs to put forth\n\ncompetent evidence now, see Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475\n\nU.S. at 586, to make “a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element\n\nessential” to the proof of their case. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. at 322; see FED.\n\nR. CIV. P. 56(c). As the Court has explained, the plaintiffs point to no evidence currently\n\nin the record — other than the disproportionate representation of minorities in the\n\nDistrict’s homeless population — to demonstrate their ability to make such a showing.\n\nRather, they have shown only that a very small subset of the homeless population was\n\ndeprived of housing in one location.\n\n               As this Court noted in its earlier decision, the most relevant cases from the\n\ncourts of appeals “involve government action affecting all persons within a community\n\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fwho need low-income housing, and . . . these cases do not necessarily apply with equal\n\nforce to government action that affects a much smaller portion of the community.”\n\nBoykin v. Gray, 895 F. Supp. 2d at 212 n.11. 4 The seminal Village of Arlington Heights\n\ncase, for example, involved a challenge to the defendant village’s refusal to rezone\n\nproperty on which the plaintiffs intended to build low-income housing. Metropolitan\n\nHousing Dev. Corp. v. Village of Arlington Heights, 558 F.2d at 1285-86. Although the\n\nparticular housing development at issue involved just 190 townhouse units, the village’s\n\nzoning decision would violate the FHA, the court held, if it “effectively foreclose[d] the\n\nconstruction of any low-cost housing within its corporate boundaries.” Id. at 1285-86.\n\nThe court’s decision was also based in part on the fact that the proposed development\n\n“would create a substantial number of federally subsidized low-cost housing units” in a\n\nvillage that “remain[ed] almost totally white in a metropolitan area with a significant\n\npercentage of black people.” Id. at 1288.

Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d at 928,\n\nthe plaintiffs challenged the defendant town’s refusal to permit the construction of\n\nsubsidized housing outside of an “urban renewal area.” The particular controversy\n\ninvolved just one proposed subsidized apartment complex, but the lawsuit implicated the\n\n       4\n                The Court added that, “[t]he smaller the affected population . . . the less\nreadily it can be said that a racially disproportionate effect within that population affects\nhousing options for the racial group as a whole.” Boykin v. Gray, 895 F. Supp. 2d at\n212-13 n.11.\n\n\n                                              13\n\fvalidity of the restrictive zoning ordinance generally. See id. at 928-29, 937-38.\n\nAccordingly, to determine disproportionate effect, the court considered town-wide\n\nstatistics showing that African Americans were much more likely to depend on affordable\n\nrental housing. Id. at 929. A significant compounding factor in the court’s reasoning\n\ninvolved the segregative effect of restricting low-income housing construction to an area\n\nwith a high concentration of minority residents, particularly given that the town of\n\n200,000 people was 95% white. See id.\n\n                Although the precise number of affected individuals relevant to the inquiry\n\nin this case is a matter of dispute between the parties, it is clear that the plaintiffs cannot\n\nseriously contend that the closure of La Casa exerted an adverse impact on the full\n\nhomeless population of the city, let alone that it has significantly restricted housing\n\noptions for people of color more generally. 5 Indeed, as the District has argued, while the\n\nplaintiffs and their fellow regulars at La Casa were adversely affected by the loss of this\n\nparticular shelter, other homeless residents of Washington, D.C. — also\n\ndisproportionately African American and Hispanic — had been afforded increased access\n\nto housing due to the District’s policies. See Swan Dec. No. 1 ¶ 7 (describing net\n\nincrease in availability of housing for homeless persons between 2008 and 2010, despite\n\nclosure of La Casa in October 2010).\n\n\n\n\n        5\n                The District identifies 114 individuals for this part of the analysis, which\nis the number of men who stayed at La Casa during the month preceding its closure. MSJ\nat 14 (citing Swan Declaration No. 2 ¶ 2). The plaintiffs do not dispute the accuracy of\nthis measure, but they disagree with its materiality, arguing that the appropriate statistical\nanalysis would include the “hundreds if not thousands of minority . . . men” who were\nserved by La Casa during its existence, as well as an indeterminate amount of people who\nmight be affected currently and in the future by its loss.

In particular, they have not\n\nprovided statistical argument or evidence to counter the District’s evidence;\n\nconsequently, there is nothing on which a reasonable jury could base a finding that the\n\nclosure of La Casa Shelter constituted or was representative of a broader adverse impact\n\nsuffered by the homeless population of Washington, D.C.

At the motion to dismiss stage, the plaintiffs made this claim without much\n\nevidentiary support, apart from demographic information about the racial composition of\n\nthe District’s various neighborhoods, alongside assertions — supported by declarations\n\n— that some former La Casa residents had been displaced to shelters located in areas\n\nwith high concentrations of minority residents. See id. at 213-14. Although these factual\n\nallegations were sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,\n\nthe Court warned the plaintiffs that “[w]ith respect to any segregative effect theory,\n\nproving the displacement of homeless persons will not suffice; rather, the plaintiffs will\n\nneed to demonstrate that the closure of La Casa had a measurable impact on the racial\n\ncomposition of the city’s wards or neighborhoods.” Id. at 214.\n\n               As the District points out in its motion for summary judgment, however,\n\nthe plaintiffs have failed to produce evidence on which a reasonable jury could make\n\nsuch a finding of measurable impact. MSJ at 15. The plaintiffs continue to rely primarily\n\non the bare fact that La Casa was closed, and that the remaining low-barrier shelters for\n\nhomeless men are located in predominantly minority areas. See Opp. at 5-9; Pls. Exh. 5\n\n[Dkt. No. 84-1]. Although the Court considered this scenario sufficient to state a\n\nplausible claim for segregative effect under a motion to dismiss standard, summary\n\njudgment should be granted if the plaintiffs’ evidence is “merely colorable” or “not\n\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\fsignificantly probative,” as is the case here. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477\n\nU.S. at 249-50.\n\n               To be sure, the plaintiffs argue that La Casa’s closure took place within a\n\nbroader context of “displacement across the city,” Opp. at 7, which includes the District’s\n\nclosure of the Franklin School Shelter in 2008, the District’s placement of homeless\n\npersons in Permanent Supportive Housing apartments located in predominantly minority\n\nareas, as well as the shifting demographics of the city. See id. at 5-11; Pls.’ Exh. 5 [Dkt.\n\nNo. 42-2]. But the plaintiffs have failed to put forth the kind of supporting material that\n\nwould demonstrate an ability to prove that La Casa’s closure caused “a measurable\n\nimpact on the racial composition of the city’s wards or neighborhoods,” Boykin v. Gray,\n\n895 F. Supp. 2d at 214, such as by, for example, “showing that the numbers of homeless\n\nindividuals in Wards 1 and 2 have significantly decreased, with a commensurate increase\n\nin the number of homeless residents of Ward 8,” or “track[ing] . . . the dispersal of the\n\nindividuals who used to populate La Casa.” Opinion, Boykin v. Fenty, Civil Action No.\n\n10-1790 (Dec. 17, 2010), at 9 (denying the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary\n\ninjunction). In addition, the District claims, with some evidentiary support, that it is\n\nestablishing PSH apartments in more integrated areas, including on a portion of the site\n\nwhere La Casa used to stand. See Swan Declaration No. 2 ¶ 4.\n\n               In short, the plaintiffs have not supplemented the record with any\n\nadditional probative evidence since surviving the District’s motion to dismiss. Although\n\nthey continue to describe a scenario in which the District’s actions could plausibly\n\nperpetuate segregation, they have failed to produce any evidence on the basis of which a\n\nreasonable jury could find that such segregation has actually resulted from the closure of\n\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\fLa Casa, even considered in concert with the closure of the Franklin shelter and the\n\nimplementation of the PSH program. This failure means that their claim cannot\n\nwithstand a motion for summary judgment, given that “a disparate impact claim . . .\n\nrequire[s] plaintiffs to establish that the challenged policy actually had a disparate\n\nimpact.” 2922 Sherman Ave. Tenants’ Ass’n v.

Such a per se rule would go beyond the intent of Congress and would lead\n\ncourts into untenable results in specific cases.”). Accordingly, the courts of appeals have\n\ndeveloped analytical frameworks for examining practices that produce disparate effects,\n\nto determine whether a defendant’s causing such an effect warrants liability under the\n\n\n\n                                             18\n\fFHA. As our own circuit has noted, there are “two leading tests,” emanating from the\n\nSecond and Seventh Circuits. See Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Ctr. v. U.S.\n\nDept. of Housing & Urban Dev., 639 F.3d at 1085. The District of Columbia, in its\n\nmotion for summary judgment, argues that it prevails under either approach. See MSJ at\n\n18-23. The Court agrees.\n\n\n                       1. The Second Circuit’s Burden-Shifting Test\n\n               In Huntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d at\n\n935-39, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit drew from\n\nemployment discrimination jurisprudence, as well as from an earlier Third Circuit case\n\nunder the FHA, to establish a burden-shifting approach for determining ultimate liability\n\nunder the statute. The court held that, “once the plaintiff demonstrates that the\n\nchallenged practice has a disproportionate impact, the burden shifts to the defendant to\n\n‘prove that its actions furthered, in theory and in practice, a legitimate, bona fide\n\ngovernmental interest and that no alternative would serve that interest with less\n\ndiscriminatory effect.’” 2922 Sherman Ave. Tenants’ Ass’n v. Dist. of Columbia, 444\n\nF.3d at 680 (quoting Huntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d at\n\n935-36).\n\n               Here, the District of Columbia advances two justifications for its\n\nchallenged conduct. First, the District claims that it had no choice other than to close La\n\nCasa and vacate the premises, because the underlying land was owned by a private entity,\n\nDonatelli Development. MSJ at 19-21. Second, it argues that closing La Casa was done\n\npursuant to the District’s implementation of its Strategic Action Plan to End\n\nHomelessness, which, according to the defendant, represents the considered policy\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\fjudgment of the District’s government as to how it can best serve its homeless\n\npopulation. Id. at 21-22. The plaintiffs respond that “PSH programs were never intended\n\nto be mutually exclusive with the existence of low barrier shelters,” and argue further that\n\nthe arrangement of PSH placements for some homeless persons does not mitigate the\n\nneed for low-barrier shelters to exist within the city. Opp. at 14-16. In addition, the\n\nplaintiffs assert that the existence of “any less discriminatory alternatives the District may\n\nhave had remains a jury question.” Id. at 14.\n\n                The District’s first argument is not supported by the evidence in the\n\nrecord. Although it is true that, at the time of La Casa’s closure in 2010, the land on\n\nwhich the shelter stood was owned by Donatelli Development, the plaintiffs note —\n\ncorrectly, it seems — that this situation stems from the District’s own sale of the land to\n\nDonatelli in 2008. See 2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 46-47; Special Warranty Deed (conveying\n\nproperty to Donatelli for consideration of $10.00). Thus, viewing the evidence in the\n\nlight most favorable to the plaintiffs, a reasonable jury could find that the District’s first\n\njustification fails as a “bona fide governmental interest,” as the District apparently chose\n\nto sell the property with the knowledge that Donatelli intended to develop the land, which\n\nwould, of course, necessitate La Casa’s removal.\n\n                The District’s second justification — that it closed the shelter pursuant to\n\nits broader policy on homelessness — has more merit. When a disparate impact claim\n\nunder the Fair Housing Act implicates government policy, the question is whether the\n\nchallenged action furthers a legitimate, bona fide governmental interest or policy and that\n\nno alternative would further that interest or policy with less discriminatory effect. See\n\n2922 Sherman Ave. Tenants’ Ass’n v. Dist. of Columbia, 444 F.3d at 680 (citing\n\n\n\n\n                                              20\n\fHuntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d at 935-36); Langlois v.\n\nAbington Housing Authority, 207 F.3d at 51 (applying a variant of the Second Circuit’s\n\nburden-shifting test, which requires a showing “that a demonstrated disparate impact in\n\nhousing be justified by a legitimate and substantial goal of the measure in question”).\n\n               The present case exemplifies the difficulties inherent in such an inquiry.\n\nThe District of Columbia has argued that it is pursuing a long-term shift in its strategy for\n\naddressing homelessness, and, specifically, that the core element of this movement is to\n\ntransition homeless persons away from reliance on emergency shelters and into\n\nPermanent Supportive Housing placements. MSJ at 22; Swan Declaration No. 1 ¶¶ 5-8;\n\nBudget Justification at 33-39 (describing “the District’s goal of ending homelessness, by\n\nshifting from providing emergency services, in trailers, to the construction of homes\n\nintegrated with services to meet the needs of the resident population”). In addition, the\n\nDistrict has asserted that, given “limited fiscal resources for the homeless services\n\nprogram,” any funds directed toward re-opening emergency shelter housing would\n\nnecessarily draw money away from “other critically needed homeless services programs\n\nincluding the [PSH program].” Swan Declaration No. 1 ¶ 12. In sum, the District argues\n\nthat its elected officials and administrative agencies “are best positioned to make policy\n\njudgments and to allocate resources to determine how best to meet the needs of their\n\nconstituents.” MSJ at 21.\n\n               The plaintiffs present a compelling point in response: placing some\n\nhomeless residents into Permanent Supportive Housing does not preclude the\n\nmaintenance of an adequate level of emergency shelter availability. Opp. at 14-16.\n\nAssuming that any reduction in shelter space exerts a disparate impact on minorities, it\n\n\n\n\n                                             21\n\ffollows that this adverse effect can be lessened by simply keeping all of the District’s\n\nshelters open, while simultaneously expanding the PSH program. See id. At the very\n\nleast, the plaintiffs argue, whether a less discriminatory alternative exists is a factual\n\nquestion, appropriate for resolution by a jury. Id. at 14. But the plaintiffs’ argument\n\ndirectly implicates two main elements of the District’s homelessness policy: the shift\n\nfrom emergency shelters to Permanent Supportive Housing, and the necessity of making\n\ntradeoffs between various types of services for homeless citizens, given limited\n\nresources. The District has submitted a declaration from Fred Swan, the official\n\nresponsible for overseeing the city’s shelter program, in which he asserts that low-barrier\n\nshelters such as La Casa can perpetuate chronic homelessness, whereas by moving people\n\ninto Permanent Supportive Housing, the District can further its goal of helping them\n\nescape homelessness and achieve self-sufficiency. Swan Declaration No. 1 ¶¶ 5-8. He\n\nalso states that budget concerns dictate tradeoffs between different services for the\n\nhomeless. Id. ¶ 12. The plaintiffs offer no evidence in response to Mr. Swan’s\n\ndeclaration.\n\n                In cases where courts — applying the Second Circuit’s balancing test or\n\nvariants thereof — have found there to be genuine issues of material fact as to the\n\nexistence of a less discriminatory alternative, the plaintiffs have offered evidence to\n\nsupport the existence of such alternatives. For example, in Mt. Holly Garden Citizens in\n\nAction, Inc. v. Township of Mt. Holly, 658 F.3d at 377-81, a challenge was brought\n\nagainst the defendant township’s execution of a redevelopment plan for a neighborhood\n\nthat, according to the township, had become blighted. Residents opposed the harsh\n\nmanner of the redevelopment plan, which involved the demolition of a large number of\n\n\n\n\n                                              22\n\fhomes, and argued that they were effectively being pushed out of their own\n\nneighborhood. See id. The township justified its actions as necessary to alleviating\n\nblight; the plaintiffs then produced evidence, in the form of a report from a planning\n\nexpert, “which stated that the ‘blighted and unsafe’ conditions could be remedied in a far\n\nless heavy-handed manner that would not entail the wholesale destruction and rebuilding\n\nof the neighborhood.” Id. at 386. Although the defendant countered with statements\n\nfrom the township manager, the court of appeals held that “[t]hese contrasting statements,\n\nas well as the parties’ continued arguments on appeal as to the cost and feasibility of an\n\nalternative relying on rehabilitation, create genuine issues of material fact that require\n\nfurther investigation.” Id. at 387.\n\n               Similarly, in Gallagher v. Magner, 619 F.3d at 828-30, the plaintiffs were\n\nowners and former owners of rental properties, who alleged that the City of St. Paul’s\n\naggressive enforcement of its housing code led to increased costs for property owners,\n\nwhich contributed to a shortage of affordable housing. The city argued that its\n\nenforcement activities were justified by the goals of “providing minimum property\n\nmaintenance standards, keeping the City clean and housing habitable, and making the\n\nCity’s neighborhoods safe and livable.” Id. at 837. The court concluded that the city’s\n\nconduct was “manifest[ly] relat[ed]” to these “legitimate, non-discriminatory objectives.”\n\nSee id. But at the third step of the analysis, the plaintiffs provided evidence of the\n\nexistence of a less discriminatory alternative by pointing to a progress report from the\n\ncity’s previous program to enforce the housing code, which, according to the plaintiffs,\n\n“embodied a flexible and cooperative approach to code enforcement, which achieved the\n\ngoals of code enforcement while maintaining a consistent supply of affordable housing.”\n\n\n\n\n                                             23\n\fId. at 837-38. The court of appeals concluded that, by providing evidence of the\n\npossibility of a less discriminatory alternative, the plaintiffs had demonstrated the\n\nexistence of “a genuine dispute of fact regarding whether [the former program] was a\n\nviable alternative to the City’s aggressive Housing Code enforcement practices.” Id. at\n\n838.\n\n               As already noted, with respect to the existence of less discriminatory\n\nalternatives, the defendant bears the burden of showing their unavailability. See Mt.\n\nHolly Garden Citizens in Action, Inc. v. Township of Mt. Holly, 658 F.3d at 387. The\n\nDistrict of Columbia has put forth several persuasive arguments as to the necessity of\n\nclosing some emergency shelters as part of its transitioning policy on homelessness.\n\nUnlike the plaintiffs in Mt. Holly and Gallagher, however, the plaintiffs here have not\n\nproduced any sort of substantive analysis or evidentiary material to counter the\n\ndefendant’s justifications. They have done no more than to assert their view that the\n\nDistrict could have kept La Casa Shelter open, while also expanding the availability of\n\nPermanent Supportive Housing. Without more, the Court cannot conclude that a\n\nreasonable jury would have anything on which to base such a finding. See Matsushita\n\nElec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. at 586 (a party opposing summary\n\njudgment must raise genuine issues of material fact supported by competent evidence\n\nbeyond mere supposition).\n\n               Finally, the particular facts of this case place difficult policy judgments\n\ndirectly in issue, and implicate decisions about how the District government allocates\n\nbenefits and burdens through its homelessness policy. As this Court stated in its Opinion\n\ndenying the plaintiffs’ original motion for a preliminary injunction, “the Court has no\n\n\n\n\n                                             24\n\fmeans of arriving at an answer” to the question of “[w]hat type of system best provides\n\n‘meaningful services and shelter’” to the homeless citizens of Washington, D.C.\n\nOpinion, Boykin v. Fenty, Civil Action No. 10-1790 (Dec. 17, 2010), at 12-13 (quoting\n\nthe plaintiffs’ motion). Although it is undoubtedly true that the District government is\n\nbound to uphold the Fair Housing Act in all its activities, including as it pertains to\n\nhomelessness policy, the Court concludes that in this case, given the particular decision at\n\nissue and the District’s asserted justification for taking it — and, most importantly, the\n\nplaintiffs’ failure to offer evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact as to the\n\nexistence of viable alternatives to the closure of La Casa — the District is entitled to\n\nsummary judgment.\n\n\n                   2. The Seventh Circuit’s Four-Factor Balancing Test\n\n                In an early disparate impact case under the FHA, the United States Court\n\nof Appeals for the Seventh Circuit set forth its own four-factor test for determining\n\nliability under the FHA, given a plaintiff’s success in proving its prima facie case. This\n\ntest balances: “(1) the strength of the plaintiff’s showing of discriminatory effect; (2)\n\nwhether any evidence indicates discriminatory intent; (3) the defendant’s interest in\n\ntaking the challenged action; and (4) whether the plaintiff seeks to compel the defendant\n\nto affirmatively provide housing to a protected class or merely to restrain the defendant\n\nfrom interfering with individual property owners who wish to provide such housing.”\n\n2922 Sherman Ave. Tenants’ Ass’n v. Dist. of Columbia, 444 F.3d at 680 (citing\n\nMetropolitan Housing Dev. Corp. v. Village of Arlington Heights, 558 F.2d at 1290).\n\n                Here, with respect to the first factor, the District of Columbia argues that\n\ngiven the small number of people affected by the closure of La Casa, any disparate\n\n\n\n                                               25\n\fadverse impact would be negligible. MSJ at 20. With respect to the second factor, the\n\nDistrict asserts that there is no evidence of discriminatory intent. Addressing the fourth\n\nfactor, it admits to a lack of clarity in its understanding of the plaintiffs’ desired remedy.\n\nId. The central focus of the District’s argument is placed on the third factor — its interest\n\nin taking the action at issue. Unsurprisingly, it offers two justifications for its conduct:\n\nfirst, that it was obligated to vacate the property on which La Casa stood, which was\n\nprivately owned; and second, that closing La Casa was in keeping with the District’s\n\ntransition toward a PSH-focused homelessness policy. The plaintiffs’ basic response\n\nremains that the closure of La Casa was not necessary to the implementation of the\n\nDistrict’s new homelessness plan, and that the need for emergency shelter is still acute.\n\n                 The Court has already explained why the plaintiffs’ prima facie case must\n\nfail under either a disproportionate effect or segregative effect theory. For much the\n\nsame reasons, the Court concludes that even if the plaintiffs have made some showing of\n\ndisparate impact, it is exceedingly weak. With respect to the second factor, this Court has\n\npreviously determined that the plaintiffs’ evidence could not justify an inference of\n\ndiscriminatory intent, and therefore dismissed their claim for disparate treatment based on\n\nrace. Boykin v. Gray, 895 F. Supp. 2d at 207-09. Since that dismissal, the plaintiffs have\n\nnot supplemented the record with any new evidence that would change this\n\ndetermination.\n\n                 The third factor in the analysis requires the Court to evaluate the quality\n\nand strength of the District’s interest in closing La Casa. As already noted, supra at 20,\n\nthe District’s contention that it had no choice but to close La Casa is undermined by\n\nevidence showing that the District itself sold the underlying land to Donatelli\n\n\n\n\n                                              26\n\fDevelopment in 2008. But as also discussed, the District has described its conduct as a\n\nnecessary element of its broader policy on homelessness. It has argued that the decision\n\nto close La Casa was part of an ongoing transition away from emergency shelters and\n\ntoward Permanent Supportive Housing. Weighing the District’s interest in taking the\n\nparticular action at issue here would require the Court to pass judgment on this policy and\n\nthe allocation of costs and benefits it entails. Moreover, as explained supra at 24, the\n\nplaintiffs have not offered any evidentiary support for their argument that La Casa’s\n\nclosure was not necessary to the District’s implementation of its plan. In sum, the\n\nDistrict has offered persuasive support for the proposition that its interest in moving\n\nresources from emergency shelters to Permanent Supportive Housing is strong, that\n\ndecreasing people’s dependence on emergency shelter housing is a part of that effort, and\n\nthat the specific decision to close La Casa occurred as an element of this broader\n\ngovernmental policy. The Court concludes, on the basis of the record before it, that the\n\nDistrict’s interest in closing La Casa, viewed in the context of its decision to make a shift\n\nin its approach to homelessness, outweighs any disparate impact the closure might have\n\ncaused.\n\n               Finally, although the defendant expresses confusion as to what remedy the\n\nplaintiffs seek, it is clear that, beyond compensatory and punitive damages, the plaintiffs\n\nrequest an injunction requiring the re-establishment of low-barrier shelter housing in the\n\nneighborhood where La Casa was located. 2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 80-81, 94-99. Thus, they\n\nseek “to compel the defendant to affirmatively provide housing,” rather than merely to\n\nprevent the defendant from impeding the private development of such housing. See 2922\n\nSherman Ave. Tenants’ Ass’n v. Dist. of Columbia, 444 F.3d at 680. This factor, of\n\n\n\n\n                                             27\n\fcourse, is also embedded in the preceding point about policy choices and the necessity of\n\nmaking difficult tradeoffs in allocating resources to the District’s homelessness program.\n\nIt weighs in favor of the defendant, and, ultimately, strengthens the Court’s conclusion\n\nthat the District is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n\n\n                                    III. CONCLUSION\n\n               For the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant the defendant’s motion to\n\ndismiss, or, in the alternative, for summary judgment.\n\n               An Order consistent with this Opinion will issue this same day.\n\n               SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n                                                       /s/___________________________\n                                                       PAUL L.
