Civil Action No. 04-cv-00370\n                       (Honorable Thomas I.

For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.\n\n                                              I\n\n       In 2004 Alexander filed a § 1983 complaint against Jim Forr, the former grievance\n\ncoordinator at SCI-Frackville, alleging that Forr had filed false misconduct charges in\n\nretaliation against Alexander for filing grievances.1 Alexander later amended his\n\ncomplaint to add retaliation claims against 35 other officials and employees of prisons in\n\nwhich he has been housed, including six John Doe correction officers. He claims that in\n\naddition to filing false misconduct charges the defendants have, inter alia, confiscated his\n\nmail, transferred him to an inferior prison, placed him in administrative segregation, and\n\ndenied his grievances.\n\n       The defendants eventually moved for summary judgment. The Magistrate Judge\n\nrecommended dismissing the complaint against three of the defendants based on\n\nAlexander’s failure to exhaust one of his claims; dismissing the complaint as to six named\n\ndefendants and all unnamed defendants based on their lack of personal involvement;\n\ngranting the motion or dismissing the action with regard to Alexander’s retaliation claims\n\nbased on his failure to show causation; granting the motion with regard to Alexander’s\n\n\n\n   1\n     Because the relevant facts of this case are set forth in the Magistrate Judge’s detailed\nReport and Recommendation, we provide only a brief statement of the procedural and\nfactual background.\n\n                                              2\n\fdue process claim pursuant to Sandin v. Connor, 515 U.S. 472 (1995); and dismissing the\n\naction against those defendants whom Alexander failed to serve. The District Court\n\noverruled Alexander’s objections and rejected all of his claims on the merits (it thus had\n\nno need to address exhaustion and service of process). The court adopted the Report and\n\nRecommendation, granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment, and dismissed\n\nthe action with regard to the John Doe defendants. This appeal followed.\n\n                                               II\n\n       We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We exercise plenary\n\nreview of a District Court’s order granting summary judgment. See S&H Hardware &\n\nSupply Co. v. Yellow Transp. Inc., 432 F.3d 550, 554 (3d Cir. 2005). Summary\n\njudgment is appropriate when the record shows that there is no need of a trial because\n\n“there is no genuine issue of material fact and []the moving party is entitled to judgment\n\nas a matter of law.” FED. R. CIV. P. 56(c). As the Supreme Court has explained, “the\n\nplain language of Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate\n\ntime for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing\n\nsufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case, and on\n\nwhich that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S.\n\n317, 322 (1986). “[A]n adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials\n\nof his pleading, but his response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must\n\nset forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If he does not so\n\nrespond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against him.” Rule 56(e).\n\n                                               3\n\f                                             III\n\n       To state a claim under § 1983, Alexander must show that the defendants, acting\n\nunder color of state law, deprived him of a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the\n\nUnited States. Moreover, “[a] defendant in a civil rights action must have personal\n\ninvolvement in the alleged wrongs; liability cannot be predicated solely on the operation\n\nof respondeat superior.” Rode v. Dellarciprete, 845 F.2d 1195, 1207 (3d Cir. 1988). As\n\nthe Magistrate Judge explained, Alexander has provided no basis for concluding that\n\ndefendants Beard, James, Burks, Kyler, Bitner, Henry or the unidentified defendants were\n\npersonally involved in the alleged incidents. For example, the only support Alexander\n\nprovides for his retaliation claim against defendant Henry is an affidavit from\n\nAlexander’s brother, William Hossbach, who states that he used to send hockey cards to\n\nAlexander. Prior to October, 2002, the letters containing the cards were sometimes\n\nconfiscated, but Alexander would receive the cards if he made a written request to Henry.\n\nAfter October 2002 the letters were returned to Hossbach undelivered. However, nothing\n\nin the affidavit supports the conclusion that Henry was personally involved in the\n\nconfiscation or return of the letters. Alexander admits as much in his objections, where\n\nhe states that “[t]he causal link between Henry and the acts sworn to in the affidavit is\n\nthat he was the mailroom supervisor and was responsible for the acts.” Objections at 4.\n\nBut this is simply an assertion of respondeat superior and, thus, insufficient. Rode, supra.\n\n                                             IV\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f       Henry’s example also demonstrates another dispositive flaw with Alexander’s\n\ncase: even if he had shown personal involvement on the part of all defendants, as the\n\nDistrict Court properly concluded he has not met all the elements required for a\n\nsuccessful retaliation claim. As we have explained, “government actions, which standing\n\nalone do not violate the Constitution, may nonetheless be constitutional torts if motivated\n\nin substantial part by a desire to punish an individual for the exercise of a constitutional\n\nright.” Allah v. Seiverling, 229 F.3d 220, 224-25 (3d Cir. 2000). To prevail on a\n\nretaliation claim a prisoner must show all of the following: (1) that his conduct against\n\nwhich the defendants allegedly retaliated was constitutionally protected; (2) that he\n\nsuffered some “adverse action” which would be sufficient to deter a person of ordinary\n\nfirmness from exercising his constitutional rights; and (3) that his exercise of a\n\nconstitutional right caused the defendants to take the adverse action against him. Rauser\n\nv. Horn, 241 F.3d 330, 333 (3d Cir. 2001). The third step involves a shifting burden of\n\nproof: if the prisoner shows that his protected conduct was a substantial or motivating\n\nfactor in the retaliation, the defendants can avoid liability by showing by a preponderance\n\nof the evidence that they would have taken the same action even without the protected\n\nactivity for reasons reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest. Id. at 333-334.\n\n       We will assume arguendo that Alexander satisfies the first two prongs of the\n\nanalysis. As the District Court explained, however, Alexander’s allegations of causation\n\ntypically amount to no more than unsupported assertions; indeed, he often appears to rely\n\non his unwarranted belief that causation is self-evident, at least where the defendants have\n\n                                              5\n\facknowledged that their actions had adverse consequences for him.2 At any rate,\n\nAlexander has provided no evidence that the defendants denied his grievances or appeals\n\nin retaliation rather than because they believed that the grievances had no merit.\n\nMoreover, not only has Alexander failed to support his assertion that his transfer to S.C.I.\n\nFrackville was retaliatory, but the defendants have provided plausible and independent\n\nreasons for transferring him: it is undisputed that Alexander had requested a transfer from\n\nhis former prison and that S.C.I. Frackville is over 200 miles closer to his home. Much\n\nthe same analysis applies to his placement in administrative segregation: Alexander\n\nreported that he had been threatened by another inmate and he was returned to general\n\npopulation when the threat ended.\n\n\n\n\n   2\n     Alexander’s reliance on documentary support is typically of no avail. For example,\nto support his allegations that defendant Pogirski retaliated by improperly withholding\nmail, denying an outside purchase request, and diverting or destroying his grievances,\nAlexander cites merely his own prison grievances containing the same allegations. (See\nDeclaration in Opposition to Summary Judgment at ¶ 7.) It goes without saying that\nprison grievances are not evidence of the allegations they contain.\n\n                                             6\n\f                                             V\n\n       Finally, to the extent that Alexander’s claim against defendant Kane amounts to a\n\ndue process claim as well as a retaliation claim, it is barred by Sandin, supra, because\n\nAlexander has not shown that the discipline involved imposed an “atypical and significant\n\nhardship.” See Sandin, supra; Griffin v. Vaughan, 112 F.3d 703, 706 (3d Cir. 1997).\n\n       We have considered Alexander’s remaining arguments and conclude that they are\n\nmeritless. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.3\n\n\n\n\n   3\n    Alexander has filed a motion for sanctions against the Appellees in this Court\narguing that many of them perjured themselves in their affidavits in support of summary\njudgment. We deny the motion.\n\n                                             7\n\f",

If he does not so\n\nrespond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against him.” Rule 56(e).\n\n                                               3\n\f                                             III\n\n       To state a claim under § 1983, Alexander must show that the defendants, acting\n\nunder color of state law, deprived him of a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the\n\nUnited States. Moreover, “[a] defendant in a civil rights action must have personal\n\ninvolvement in the alleged wrongs; liability cannot be predicated solely on the operation\n\nof respondeat superior.” Rode v. Dellarciprete, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"505504\"><a href=\"/opinion/505504/vivian-m-rode-and-jay-c-hileman-v-nicholas-g-dellarciprete-john/\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1195</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1207 (3d Cir. 1988). As\n\nthe Magistrate Judge explained, Alexander has provided no basis for concluding that\n\ndefendants Beard, James, Burks, Kyler, Bitner, Henry or the unidentified defendants were\n\npersonally involved in the alleged incidents. For example, the only support Alexander\n\nprovides for his retaliation claim against defendant Henry is an affidavit from\n\nAlexander’s brother, William Hossbach, who states that he used to send hockey cards to\n\nAlexander. Prior to October, 2002, the letters containing the cards were sometimes\n\nconfiscated, but Alexander would receive the cards if he made a written request to Henry.\n\nAfter October 2002 the letters were returned to Hossbach undelivered. However, nothing\n\nin the affidavit supports the conclusion that Henry was personally involved in the\n\nconfiscation or return of the letters. Alexander admits as much in his objections, where\n\nhe states that “[t]he causal link between Henry and the acts sworn to in the affidavit is\n\nthat he was the mailroom supervisor and was responsible for the acts.” Objections at 4.\n\nBut this is simply an assertion of respondeat superior and, thus, insufficient. Rode, supra.\n\n                                             IV\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f       Henry’s example also demonstrates another dispositive flaw with Alexander’s\n\ncase: even if he had shown personal involvement on the part of all defendants, as the\n\nDistrict Court properly concluded he has not met all the elements required for a\n\nsuccessful retaliation claim. As we have explained, “government actions, which standing\n\nalone do not violate the Constitution, may nonetheless be constitutional torts if motivated\n\nin substantial part by a desire to punish an individual for the exercise of a constitutional\n\nright.” Allah v. Seiverling, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770720\"><a href=\"/opinion/770720/michael-malik-allah-v-thomas-seiverling-robert-sparbanie-john-deletto-ben/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 224-25 (3d Cir. 2000). To prevail on a\n\nretaliation claim a prisoner must show all of the following: (1) that his conduct against\n\nwhich the defendants allegedly retaliated was constitutionally protected; (2) that he\n\nsuffered some “adverse action” which would be sufficient to deter a person of ordinary\n\nfirmness from exercising his constitutional rights; and (3) that his exercise of a\n\nconstitutional right caused the defendants to take the adverse action against him. Rauser\n\nv. Horn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772202\"><a href=\"/opinion/772202/henry-rauser-v-martin-horn-in-his-official-capacity-as-commissioner-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 333 (3d Cir. 2001). The third step involves a shifting burden of\n\nproof: if the prisoner shows that his protected conduct was a substantial or motivating\n\nfactor in the retaliation, the defendants can avoid liability by showing by a preponderance\n\nof the evidence that they would have taken the same action even without the protected\n\nactivity for reasons reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest. Id. at 333-334.\n\n       We will assume arguendo that Alexander satisfies the first two prongs of the\n\nanalysis. As the District Court explained, however, Alexander’s allegations of causation\n\ntypically amount to no more than unsupported assertions; indeed, he often appears to rely\n\non his unwarranted belief that causation is self-evident, at least where the defendants have\n\n                                              5\n\facknowledged that their actions had adverse consequences for him.2 At any rate,\n\nAlexander has provided no evidence that the defendants denied his grievances or appeals\n\nin retaliation rather than because they believed that the grievances had no merit.\n\nMoreover, not only has Alexander failed to support his assertion that his transfer to S.C.I.\n\nFrackville was retaliatory, but the defendants have provided plausible and independent\n\nreasons for transferring him: it is undisputed that Alexander had requested a transfer from\n\nhis former prison and that S.C.I. Frackville is over 200 miles closer to his home. Much\n\nthe same analysis applies to his placement in administrative segregation: Alexander\n\nreported that he had been threatened by another inmate and he was returned to general\n\npopulation when the threat ended.\n\n\n\n\n   2\n     Alexander’s reliance on documentary support is typically of no avail. For example,\nto support his allegations that defendant Pogirski retaliated by improperly withholding\nmail, denying an outside purchase request, and diverting or destroying his grievances,\nAlexander cites merely his own prison grievances containing the same allegations. (See\nDeclaration in Opposition to Summary Judgment at ¶ 7.) It goes without saying that\nprison grievances are not evidence of the allegations they contain.\n\n                                             6\n\f                                             V\n\n       Finally, to the extent that Alexander’s claim against defendant Kane amounts to a\n\ndue process claim as well as a retaliation claim, it is barred by Sandin, supra, because\n\nAlexander has not shown that the discipline involved imposed an “atypical and significant\n\nhardship.” See Sandin, supra; Griffin v. Vaughan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"740238\"><a href=\"/opinion/740238/jerome-griffin-v-don-vaughn-hugh-owens-bk-smith-r-johnson-joseph/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 706 (3d Cir. 1997).\n\n       We have considered Alexander’s remaining arguments and conclude that they are\n\nmeritless. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.3\n\n\n\n\n   3\n    Alexander has filed a motion for sanctions against the Appellees in this Court\narguing that many of them perjured themselves in their affidavits in support of summary\njudgment. We deny the motion.\n\n                                             7\n\f</pre>",
