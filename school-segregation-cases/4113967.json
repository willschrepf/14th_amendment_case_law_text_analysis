State-created       public\n\ncorporations serve a range of special purposes.                Sometimes states\n\nstructure these entities to be so closely tied to the state\n\ngovernment -- in terms, among other things, of how they are funded\n\nand how they are supervised -- that they are properly understood\n\nto be \"arms\" of the state itself.          As a result, such entities may\n\nclaim the very same sovereign immunity from suit that the state\n\nenjoys   under    the   Eleventh    Amendment       of   the    United   States\n\nConstitution.     Sometimes, however, states structure these entities\n\nto operate at such a remove from the state government that they\n\nare not properly understood to be arms of the state.               When states\n\nset up such entities in that way, they are not entitled to share\n\nin the state's immunity.\n\n            What is true of states is also true of the Commonwealth\n\nof Puerto Rico.     It, too, we have held, is entitled to assert the\n\nsovereign immunity that states enjoy.               It, too, has created a\n\nnumber of special-purpose public corporations.             And, it, too, has\n\nstructured some of them to be very closely tied to the Commonwealth\n\ngovernment and some to operate separate and apart from it.\n\n            Unfortunately, it is not always easy to tell whether a\n\nsovereign   has    structured     one    of   its   special-purpose      public\n\ncorporations to be an \"arm.\"            Disputes over classification thus\n\nfrequently arise, such as this one, in which we must decide whether\n\none of the Commonwealth's special-purpose public corporations, the\n\n\n                                    - 2 -\n\fPuerto   Rico    Ports   Authority       (\"PRPA\"),    is     an   arm   of    the\n\nCommonwealth.\n\n           We have twice before -- albeit decades ago -- addressed\n\nPRPA's status.      In each case, we reached a different conclusion\n\nbased on the distinct nature of the particular function that PRPA\n\nwas performing that gave rise to the underlying suit.                   After we\n\ndecided those cases, however, we refined our arm-of-the-state\n\nanalysis in response to intervening Supreme Court precedent.                  In\n\nthis case, based on that refined analysis and the arguments that\n\nPRPA makes to us, we conclude that PRPA is not entitled to assert\n\nthe   Commonwealth's     immunity   as    an    arm   of    the   Commonwealth.\n\nAccordingly, we reverse the District Court's order of dismissal\n\nand remand for further proceedings.\n\n                                     I.\n\n           Puerto      Rico   law    established           the    Puerto     Rico\n\nTransportation Authority as a public corporation in 1942.                    P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. tit. 23 § 331.      In 1955, Puerto Rico renamed the entity\n\nthe Puerto Rico Ports Authority.               Id. § 332(a).       The special\n\npurposes that PRPA is charged with performing are \"to develop and\n\nimprove, own, operate, and manage any and all types of air and\n\nmarine transportation facilities and services, as well as to\n\nestablish and manage mass marine transportation systems in, to and\n\nfrom the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico on its own, or in coordination\n\n\n\n\n                                    - 3 -\n\fwith       other     government,         corporate       or     municipal         entities.\"\n\nId. § 336.\n\n               The plaintiffs are Daniel Grajales and his family. Their\n\nsuit       arises    from     events     that    allegedly         occurred      after    PRPA\n\ntransferred         Grajales,      who     had    served      as    PRPA's       Interagency\n\nCoordinator          for    Emergency      Management,         to     the     position      of\n\nSupervisor of Security at the Aguadilla Airport in Aguadilla,\n\nPuerto Rico.\n\n               The    plaintiffs       allege     that     from     2009    to    2011,    the\n\ndefendants -- which include not only PRPA, but also various PRPA\n\nofficials who are not parties to this appeal -- subjected Grajales\n\nto     \"persecution,          prosecution,          harassment,        unfair        working\n\nconditions and a hostile working environment\" due to his political\n\naffiliation.1          The     plaintiffs        also    allege      that    Grajales      was\n\nunlawfully terminated from his employment with PRPA on May 20,\n\n2011,       for     reasons      related    to    political         discrimination        and\n\nretaliation.           As   to    retaliation,       the      plaintiffs      allege      that\n\nGrajales was terminated on account of his perceived involvement in\n\nthe filing of a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health\n\n\n\n\n       1\n       Grajales is a member of the Popular Democratic Party and\nthe individual defendants are allegedly members of the New\nProgressive Party. The PDP lost the general election in November\n2008 and the NPP assumed office thereafter. See Grajales v. P.R.\nPorts Auth., 682 F.3d 40, 43 (1st Cir. 2012).\n\n\n                                            - 4 -\n\fAdministration about the procedures used by airport personnel to\n\nfix lights at the airport.\n\n            This   case   has   a   lengthy   and   complicated   procedural\n\nhistory, with many twists and turns. These include the plaintiffs'\n\nfiling of four complaints, each of which raised a variety of\n\nfederal and Puerto Rico law claims; the reversal by this Court of\n\nthe District Court's grant of the defendants' motion for judgment\n\non the pleadings, see Grajales v. P.R. Ports Auth., 682 F.3d 40,\n\n50 (1st Cir. 2012); the District Court's subsequent denial of the\n\ndefendants' motion for summary judgment; a trial that resulted in\n\njury deadlock as to the retaliation claim; the entry of default\n\nagainst PRPA; and the transfer of the case from one judge to\n\nanother.\n\n            Notably, PRPA did not assert Eleventh Amendment immunity\n\nuntil March 27, 2014, after default was entered against PRPA but\n\nbefore the entry of default judgment.          PRPA asserted its immunity\n\nin a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' then remaining claims\n\nagainst PRPA.      The District Court granted that motion on January\n\n12, 2015.   See Grajales v. P.R. Ports Auth. (\"Grajales II\"), 81 F.\n\nSupp. 3d 158, 166 (D.P.R. 2015).2\n\n\n\n     2 The District Court concluded that the plaintiffs' only\nremaining claims were a federal political discrimination claim\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and a Puerto Rico law retaliation claim.\nSee Grajales II, 81 F. Supp. 3d at 166 n.7. The parties do not\nchallenge this characterization of the remaining claims.\n\n\n                                     - 5 -\n\f             The District Court relied primarily on Puerto Rico Ports\n\nAuthority v. Federal Maritime Commission (\"FMC\"), 531 F.3d 868\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 1170 (2009).              Grajales\n\nII, 81 F. Supp. 3d at 163-65.        In FMC, the D.C. Circuit concluded\n\nthat PRPA was an arm of the Commonwealth and was thus immune from\n\nsuit under Eleventh Amendment immunity principles.            FMC, 531 F.3d\n\nat 880.   The District Court agreed, Grajales II, 81 F. Supp. 3d at\n\n162-65, and also concluded that PRPA did not, through its course\n\nof conduct in litigation, waive its right to claim immunity, id.\n\nat 165-66.\n\n             This appeal followed.      The plaintiffs do not challenge\n\nthe District Court's conclusion that PRPA did not waive its right\n\nto assert immunity.        The plaintiffs do challenge the District\n\nCourt's conclusion that PRPA is an arm of the Commonwealth entitled\n\nto assert the Commonwealth's immunity from suit.\n\n                                      II.\n\n             The Eleventh Amendment provides that \"[t]he Judicial\n\npower of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any\n\nsuit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the\n\nUnited States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or\n\nSubjects of any Foreign State.\"              U.S. Const. amend. XI.       The\n\nSupreme Court has explained that \"[a]lthough the text of the\n\nAmendment would appear to restrict only the Article III diversity\n\njurisdiction    of   the   federal   courts,    'we   have   understood   the\n\n\n                                     - 6 -\n\fEleventh Amendment to stand not so much for what it says, but for\n\nthe presupposition . . . which it confirms.'\"    Seminole Tribe of\n\nFla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 54 (1996) (omission in original)\n\n(quoting Blatchford v. Native Vill. of Noatak, 501 U.S. 775, 779\n\n(1991)).\n\n           This \"presupposition . . . has two parts: first, that\n\neach State is a sovereign entity in our federal system; and second,\n\nthat '[i]t is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be\n\namenable to the suit of an individual without its consent.'\"   Id.\n\n(second alteration in original) (quoting Hans v. Louisiana, 134\n\nU.S. 1, 13 (1890)).   As a result, states are shielded from suit in\n\nfederal court even when sued by their own citizens.    See Edelman\n\nv. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 662-63 (1974).\n\n           The parties agree that, because the Commonwealth enjoys\n\nthis immunity,3 the only question that we must decide is whether\n\n\n\n     3 See Jusino Mercado v. Com. of P.R., 214 F.3d 34, 39 (1st\nCir. 2000) (detailing Puerto Rico's autonomous history and stating\nthat \"we consistently have held that Puerto Rico's sovereign\nimmunity in federal courts parallels the states' Eleventh\nAmendment immunity\"); cf. Porto Rico v. Rosaly y Castillo, 227\nU.S. 270, 274 (1913) (concluding that the Puerto Rican government's\n\"immunity from suit without it[s] consent is necessarily inferable\nfrom a mere consideration of the nature of the P[ue]rto Rican\ngovernment\" and explaining that the purpose of the Foraker Act in\nregard to Puerto Rico was to \"'confer[] an autonomy similar to\nthat of the states'\" (quoting Gromer v. Standard Dredging Co., 224\nU.S. 362, 370 (1912))).      We note that the Supreme Court has\nexpressly reserved on the question whether Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity principles apply to Puerto Rico.      See P.R. Aqueduct &\nSewer Auth. v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S. 139, 141 n.1 (1993).\n\n\n                               - 7 -\n\fPRPA may claim it. The parties further agree that the answer turns\n\non whether PRPA's relationship to the Commonwealth is such that\n\nPRPA is an \"arm of the Commonwealth.\"              See Pastrana-Torres v.\n\nCorporación de P.R. para la Difusión PÚBLICA, 460 F.3d 124, 125\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).       Our review is de novo.           Id.     PRPA bears the\n\nburden of proving that it is an \"arm.\"              Wojcik v. Mass. State\n\nLottery Comm'n, 300 F.3d 92, 99 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                                     III.\n\n             Before turning to an examination of PRPA's status, we\n\nneed to review the substantial precedent that potentially bears on\n\nhow we should conduct our analysis.            We thus start with our two\n\nprior decisions that directly addressed whether PRPA is an arm of\n\nthe   Commonwealth     but    that    reached     opposite,      case-specific\n\noutcomes.     We then describe how, in light of subsequent Supreme\n\nCourt decisions, our arm-of-the-state precedent has developed in\n\nthe years since we decided those cases.           Finally, we describe both\n\nthe   D.C.   Circuit   case   that   the     District   Court    relied   on   in\n\nconcluding that PRPA is an arm of the Commonwealth and the District\n\nCourt decision itself.        Both the D.C. Circuit and the District\n\nCourt concluded that our prior precedents examining PRPA's status\n\ndeployed an analysis that no longer is applicable.\n\n                                      A.\n\n             We first addressed whether PRPA qualifies as an arm of\n\nthe Commonwealth in Puerto Rico Ports Authority v. M/V Manhattan\n\n\n                                     - 8 -\n\fPrince (\"Prince\"), 897 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1990).           We did so in\n\nconnection with a suit that sought to hold PRPA vicariously liable\n\nfor the negligence of a certain type of ship pilot who had been\n\ninvolved in a ship's collision into a dock.       Id. at 2-3.4\n\n              To determine PRPA's status, we relied on a multi-factor\n\nframework drawn from our decision in Ainsworth Aristocrat Int'l\n\nParty Ltd. v. Tourism Co. of P.R. (\"Ainsworth\"), 818 F.2d 1034,\n\n1037 (1st Cir. 1987).      See Prince, 897 F.2d at 9.   Accordingly, we\n\ndescribed how Puerto Rico law characterized PRPA's status, listed\n\nthe various powers and functions of PRPA, and provided a brief\n\naccount of PRPA's fiscal relationship to the Commonwealth.       Id. at\n\n9-10.       After reviewing those aspects of PRPA, we concluded that\n\n\"whether the PRPA is entitled to eleventh amendment protection\n\ndepends upon the type of activity it engages in and the nature of\n\nthe claim asserted against it.\"      Id. at 10.\n\n              Turning to those features of the case, we explained that\n\nthe pilot in question was not acting as an agent of PRPA and that\n\nPRPA's relationship to the pilot was like that of a regulator.\n\nId. at 12.      We then held that, in light of the governmental nature\n\nof the function for which the suit was seeking to hold PRPA liable,\n\nPRPA was acting as an arm of the Commonwealth and thus that PRPA\n\n\n        4\n       The pilot in question was a so-called \"compulsory pilot.\"\nPrince, 897 F.2d at 3.     Compulsory pilots are responsible for\ncoordinating the safe passage of ships into and out of Puerto Rico\nharbors. See id. at 10; P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23 §§ 2404, 2412.\n\n\n                                  - 9 -\n\fwas entitled to assert the Commonwealth's immunity from that suit.\n\nId.\n\n             Two years later, in Royal Caribbean Corp. v. Puerto Rico\n\nPorts Authority, 973 F.2d 8 (1st Cir. 1992), we considered PRPA's\n\nclaim   that    it    was    entitled    to    immunity,    as    an   arm   of   the\n\nCommonwealth, from a suit that alleged that PRPA had negligently\n\nmaintained a dock.          Id. at 9.   We again relied on the multi-factor\n\nframework set forth in Ainsworth.              Id. (citing Ainsworth, 818 F.2d\n\nat 1037).\n\n             We found that PRPA acted as a proprietor rather than as\n\na   regulator    in    maintaining       the     docks;    that   PRPA    generally\n\n\"operate[d] with a considerable degree of autonomy,\" id. at 11,\n\nconsistent with its denomination as a \"public corporation\" with a\n\n\"legal existence and personality separate and apart from those of\n\nthe Government,\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23 § 333(b); that PRPA (and\n\nnot the Commonwealth) would likely pay any adverse judgment in the\n\nevent that PRPA were not immune; and that PRPA enjoyed a great\n\ndeal    of   fiscal    independence       from    the     Commonwealth.       Royal\n\nCaribbean, 973 F.2d at 10-12.                 We concluded that these facts\n\nweighed against deeming PRPA to be an arm of the Commonwealth.\n\nId.     In particular, we concluded that PRPA's general fiscal\n\nindependence from the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth's lack of\n\npotential liability in the suit at hand weighed \"heavily\" against\n\ndeeming PRPA to be an arm of the Commonwealth.                    Id. at 11.      We\n\n\n                                        - 10 -\n\ffurther concluded that these facts outweighed the facts that\n\nfavored PRPA's claim to arm-of-the-Commonwealth status -- namely,\n\nthe fact that the Commonwealth exercised a meaningful amount of\n\ncontrol and supervision over PRPA and the fact that PRPA was\n\ngenerally    charged   with     advancing   the   interests   of   the\n\nCommonwealth.   Id. at 11-12.\n\n            We thus held in Royal Caribbean that, notwithstanding\n\nour holding in Prince, PRPA was not entitled to assert immunity,\n\nas an arm of the Commonwealth, from the suit then before us.       We\n\nattributed the difference between that holding and the one in\n\nPrince to the fact that the \"relevant 'type of activity'\" PRPA was\n\nperforming was \"fundamentally different\" in the two cases.     Id. at\n\n12 (quoting Prince, 897 F.2d at 10).          As we put it, \"[t]he\n\ndifference between the primarily 'governmental function' at issue\n\nin [Prince], and the basically 'proprietary function' . . . at\n\nissue [in Royal Caribbean] explains the difference in result.\"\n\nId.\n\n            A year later, in Metcalf & Eddy, Inc. v. Puerto Rico\n\nAqueduct & Sewer Authority, 991 F.2d 935 (1st Cir. 1993), on remand\n\nfrom 506 U.S. 139 (1993), we elaborated on the framework laid out\n\nin Ainsworth by setting forth a non-exhaustive list of seven\n\nfactors that could be \"mined\" for determining whether an entity is\n\nan arm of the state.    Metcalf & Eddy, 991 F.2d at 939-40 (citing\n\nAinsworth, 818 F.2d at 1037).     In doing so, we noted the distinct\n\n\n                                 - 11 -\n\foutcomes that we had reached in Prince and Royal Caribbean -- each\n\ndecided under the Ainsworth framework -- and \"the seeming anomaly\n\nin a single agency being held to possess Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity for some functions but not for others.\"       Id. at 941 n.6.\n\nWe explained that the different outcomes \"turned on the nature of\n\nthe function involved in each instance, presumably because, in\n\nlight of [PRPA]'s portfolio of diverse operations, the question of\n\naccess to the Commonwealth's treasury was fuliginous.\"       Id.\n\n                                  B.\n\n          For a number of years following our decisions in Prince\n\nand Royal Caribbean, the multi-factored framework that we had set\n\nforth in Metcalf & Eddy -- a framework that accommodated our\n\ndivergent (and case-specific, function-based) rulings concerning\n\nPRPA's status -- defined our approach.        But, in Fresenius Medical\n\nCare Cardiovascular Resources, Inc. v. Puerto Rico & Caribbean\n\nCardiovascular Center Corp. (\"Fresenius\"), 322 F.3d 56 (1st Cir.\n\n2003), we \"refined\" that approach.     Id. at 68.    We did so in light\n\nof the Supreme Court's intervening arm-of-the-state decision in\n\nHess v. Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corp., 513 U.S. 30 (1994),\n\nwhich   concerned   whether   the      Port    Authority   Trans-Hudson\n\nCorporation was an arm of the states that established it (New York\n\nand New Jersey), id. at 32, 35.\n\n          Fresenius explained that, although the framework for\n\ndetermining arm-of-the-state status set forth in Metcalf & Eddy\n\n\n                              - 12 -\n\fwas \"consistent with Hess,\" 322 F.3d at 68, we were obliged going\n\nforward to follow the \"two-step analysis\" that we determined Hess\n\nhad established, id. at 65.        We then proceeded to describe the two\n\nsteps.\n\n             The first step, Fresenius explained, \"pays deference to\n\nthe   state's      dignitary   interest    in    extending     or    withholding\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity from an entity\" by examining \"how the\n\nstate has structured the entity.\"          Id.       This examination requires\n\nconsideration of the broad range of structural indicators that\n\nHess and Metcalf & Eddy identified as relevant.                   See id. at 62\n\nn.6, 65 n.7, 68.5         These structural indicators include how state\n\nlaw characterizes the entity, the nature of the functions performed\n\nby the entity, the entity's overall fiscal relationship to the\n\nCommonwealth (as opposed to whether the Commonwealth is liable for\n\nany judgment in the particular case at hand), and how much control\n\nthe state exercises over the operations of the entity.                   Id.\n\n             Fresenius     explained    that    if    the   analysis     of    these\n\nstructural indicators reveals that \"the state clearly structured\n\nthe entity to share its sovereignty,\" then the entity is an arm of\n\nthe state and the analysis is at an end. Id. at 68. But, Fresenius\n\nexplained,    if    the    structural   indicators       \"point     in   different\n\n\n      5Fresenius also mentioned the factors described in Lake\nCountry Estates, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 440 U.S.\n391, 401-02 (1979), as relevant to the arm-of-the-state analysis.\nFresenius, 322 F.3d at 62 n.5, 68.\n\n\n                                    - 13 -\n\fdirections,\" id., or, as Fresenius elsewhere put it, \"when there\n\nis an ambiguity about the direction in which the structural\n\nanalysis points,\" id. at 66, the structural indicators alone cannot\n\nestablish   that   the      entity    at     issue   is     an    arm    of    the   state\n\ngovernment, see id. at 66, 68.             In that event, Fresenius holds, we\n\nmust proceed to the second step of the analysis.                               Any other\n\napproach, we explained, would give insufficient respect to the\n\ndignity   interest     of    the     sovereign       that    created          the    public\n\ncorporation and that may choose not to have that public corporation\n\nshare in the sovereign's immunity.              Id. at 65, 68.\n\n            At   the   second        step,    according          to     Fresenius,     the\n\n\"dispositive question concerns the risk that the damages will be\n\npaid from the public treasury\" and \"[t]his analysis focuses on\n\nwhether the state has legally or practically obligated itself to\n\npay the entity's indebtedness\" in the pending action.                         Id. at 68,\n\n72.   If the state is so obligated, then the entity may claim the\n\nstate's immunity, even though the structural indicators do not\n\nthemselves provide a sufficient indication that the entity is an\n\narm of the state.      Id. at 65, 68.6\n\n\n      6Fresenius also noted that in Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452\n(1997), a post-Hess Supreme Court decision involving the arm-of-\nthe-state doctrine, the Court concluded that the entity at\nissue -- a board of police commissioners -- \"was not an arm of the\nstate because the state was not responsible for the Board's\nfinancial liabilities and the only form of state control was the\ngovernor's power to appoint four of five board members.\"\nFresenius, 322 F.3d at 67 (citing Auer, 519 U.S. at 456 n.1).\n\n\n                                       - 14 -\n\f            Fresenius did reference Royal Caribbean, 322 F.3d at 69,\n\njust as Hess had done, Hess, 513 U.S. at 50.         But Fresenius, like\n\nHess, did not address Royal Caribbean's emphasis on the proprietary\n\nnature of the function that PRPA was performing in the case at\n\nhand.   See generally Hess, 513 U.S. 30; Fresenius, 322 F.3d 56.\n\nAnd Fresenius, like Hess, also did not mention our Eleventh\n\nAmendment analysis in Prince or the divergence in outcome between\n\nRoyal Caribbean and Prince.          See generally Hess, 513 U.S. 30;\n\nFresenius, 322 F.3d 56.\n\n            Moreover, Fresenius did not directly address whether an\n\nentity's case-specific function is of any relevance to the analysis\n\nof the structural indicators at the first step.               See generally\n\nFresenius, 322 F.3d 56.            Nor did Fresenius directly address\n\nwhether, under its framework, it might be possible for an entity\n\nthat, like PRPA, performs some governmental functions and some\n\nproprietary functions, see Metcalf & Eddy, 991 F.2d at 941 n.6, to\n\nbe an arm of the state for purposes of suits that target the\n\nentity's performance of the former functions but not the latter\n\nones.   See generally Fresenius, 322 F.3d 56.        We also have had no\n\noccasion to address that issue in subsequent cases.\n\n                                      C.\n\n            The question of PRPA's status first arose post-Fresenius\n\noutside of our Circuit.       In FMC, 531 F.3d 868, the D.C. Circuit\n\naddressed    PRPA's   claim   to    immunity   --   as   an    arm   of   the\n\n\n                                    - 15 -\n\fCommonwealth -- in an administrative proceeding before the Federal\n\nMaritime Commission.   Id. at 871.    The D.C. Circuit concluded, on\n\nthe basis of Fresenius, that our holdings in Prince and Royal\n\nCaribbean should be accorded little weight.         The D.C. Circuit\n\nexplained that, in Fresenius, \"the First Circuit . . . expressly\n\ndeparted from that narrow focus on governmental-versus-proprietary\n\nfunctions as the test for assessing the sovereign immunity of a\n\nspecial-purpose corporation.\"     Id. at 874 n.3.\n\n          In line with the first step of the Fresenius analysis,\n\nFMC assessed the structural indicators of PRPA's status as a whole.\n\nSee id. at 874-80.     The D.C. Circuit identified the relevant\n\nstructural indicators as: \"state intent, including the entity's\n\nfunctions; state control; and the entity's overall effects on the\n\nstate treasury.\"   Id. at 873.   The D.C. Circuit concluded that all\n\nthree of these structural indicators -- including the functions\n\nthat PRPA had been assigned to perform, when considered as a\n\nwhole -- pointed toward the conclusion that PRPA is an arm of the\n\nCommonwealth.   See id. at 874-80.   On that basis, the D.C. Circuit\n\nheld that PRPA was entitled to assert the Commonwealth's immunity.\n\nId. at 881.\n\n          Consistent with its observation that \"once an entity is\n\ndetermined to be an arm of the State under the three-factor test,\n\nthat conclusion applies unless and until there are relevant changes\n\nin the state law governing that entity,\" the D.C. Circuit did not\n\n\n                                 - 16 -\n\fundertake any further analysis.    Id. at 873.    As a result, the\n\nD.C. Circuit did not address the proper approach to follow in the\n\nevent that the structural indicators do not send a sufficiently\n\nclear signal as to an entity's status.   Nor, in consequence of its\n\nruling, did the D.C. Circuit engage in the second step of the\n\nFresenius analysis, at which the question whether the pending\n\naction places the Commonwealth's fisc at risk is dispositive.7\n\n          And that brings us, finally, to this case, in which\n\nPRPA's status is once again in dispute.     The District Court, in\n\naddressing whether PRPA is an arm, concluded that FMC was right to\n\ngive little weight to our prior holdings about PRPA's status\n\nbecause they focused too narrowly on the particular function that\n\nPRPA was performing in the case at hand.   Grajales II, 81 F. Supp.\n\n3d at 162-63.   The District Court thus followed FMC in concluding\n\n\n\n     7 The D.C. Circuit did state that an entity that does not\notherwise qualify as an arm of the state may nevertheless be immune\n\"in a particular case if the entity was acting as an agent of the\nState or if the State would be obligated to pay a judgment against\nan entity in that case.\" FMC, 531 F.3d at 878-89 (citing Pennhurst\nState Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 101 n.11 (1984)\n(invoking principles of the real-party-in-interest doctrine), and\nShands Teaching Hosp. & Clinics, Inc. v. Beech St. Corp., 208 F.3d\n1308, 1311 (11th Cir. 2000) (citing principles of agency law));\nsee also City of Oakland ex rel Bd. of Port Comm'rs v. Fed. Mar.\nComm'n, 724 F.3d 224, 227 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (\"[W]hen the state is\nnot named as a defendant, sovereign immunity attaches only to\nentities that are functionally equivalent to states (often called\n'arms of the state') or when, despite procedural technicalities,\nthe suit effectively operates against the state as the real party\nin interest.\"). This inquiry thus may mirror the second step of\nthe Fresenius analysis.\n\n\n                              - 17 -\n\fthat, under Fresenius, the proper focus was on the structural\n\nindicators of PRPA's status, broadly considered. Id. The District\n\nCourt also followed FMC in concluding that PRPA was an arm of the\n\nCommonwealth in consequence of the evidence of the Commonwealth's\n\nintent, including PRPA's functions; the Commonwealth's control\n\nover PRPA; and the nature of the fiscal relationship between PRPA\n\nand the Commonwealth government.       See id. at 162-65.   In addition,\n\nthe District Court agreed with the D.C. Circuit's conclusion that\n\nan entity determined to be an arm of the Commonwealth on the basis\n\nof the structural indicators could not lose that status in a\n\nparticular case.     Id. at 162-63.8\n\n                                   IV.\n\n              With that background in place, we are now in a position\n\nto review PRPA's status.         In doing so, we do not treat as\n\ndispositive -- as Prince and Royal Caribbean appear to suggest\n\nthat we should -- the nature of the particular function that PRPA\n\nwas performing that gave rise to the plaintiffs' claims in this\n\nsuit.       In fact, neither party asks us to adopt such a limited\n\nfocus.      Nor does either party even attempt to classify the not-\n\n\n\n\n        8\n       Two other district courts have held, on the basis of FMC,\nthat PRPA is an arm of the Commonwealth. See Del Valle Grp. v.\nP.R. Ports Auth., 756 F. Supp. 2d 169, 174-75 (D.P.R. 2010) (citing\nFMC, 531 F.3d at 874-80); Orocovis Petroleum Corp. v. P.R. Ports\nAuth., Civil No. 08–2359, 2010 WL 3981665, at *2 (D.P.R. Oct. 5,\n2010) (citing FMC, 531 F.3d at 874-81).\n\n\n                                 - 18 -\n\fobviously-classifiable function that PRPA performed here, which\n\nconcerns PRPA's employment of an airport security supervisor.\n\n               Rather than assert that this function is governmental,\n\nas   in     Prince,   897   F.2d   at   12,   or   proprietary,   as   in   Royal\n\nCaribbean, 973 F.2d at 10, the parties ask us only to determine\n\nPRPA's status with reference to Fresenius's two-step analysis and\n\nwithout regard to the particular function that PRPA was performing\n\nhere.       We proceed accordingly.9\n\n\n        9\n       With respect to our two prior precedents assessing PRPA's\nstatus, PRPA argues only that the structural indicators that\nFresenius requires us to consider reveal PRPA to be an arm of the\nCommonwealth; that Royal Caribbean does not permit us to reach a\ndifferent conclusion; and that Prince accords with the conclusion\nthat PRPA is an arm (though PRPA does not argue that Prince\ncontrols the outcome here). The plaintiffs, by contrast, make no\nreference to Prince and instead argue only that, under the\nframework that Fresenius establishes, PRPA was not structured to\nbe an arm of the Commonwealth and that this conclusion accords\nwith our decision in Royal Caribbean. Thus, the parties do not\nask us to decide whether it is possible -- as our pre-Fresenius\nprecedents contemplate -- that PRPA could be immune in the\nperformance of functions such as those identified in Prince but\nnot in the performance of functions such as those identified in\nRoyal Caribbean. Nor does either party contend that the outcome\nhere depends on our deciding whether a sovereign may structure an\nentity to be an arm only when performing certain functions and not\nwhen performing others or whether, instead, a sovereign must be\ndeemed to have structured an entity to be an arm in all cases so\nlong as it structures the entity to be an arm in one case. Given\nthe importance of that more general question, and the absence of\nbriefing on it, we decline to resolve it here. We do note, though,\nthat to the extent that dicta in the District Court's\ndecision -- or in FMC -- could be read to suggest that a sovereign\nmay not structure an entity to be a hybrid, see Grajales II, 81 F.\nSupp. 3d at 162-63; FMC, 531 F.3d at 873, we question why that\nwould be the case, given basic federalism principles and that a\nsovereign may waive its Eleventh Amendment immunity if it wishes.\nSee Coll. Sav. Bank v. Fla. Prepaid Postsecondary Educ. Expense\n\n\n                                        - 19 -\n\f           Just as Fresenius instructs, we first consider the full\n\nrange of \"structural indicators\" of PRPA's status, 322 F.3d at 65,\n\nto see whether they demonstrate that the Commonwealth \"inten[ded]\"\n\nfor PRPA to be its arm.    See Redondo Constr. Corp. v. P.R. Highway\n\n& Transp. Auth., 357 F.3d 124, 126 (1st Cir. 2004).     We then turn\n\nto the second step of the analysis, as we conclude that the\n\nstructural indicators do not show that the Commonwealth \"clearly\n\nstructured [PRPA] to share its sovereignty.\"    Fresenius, 322 F.3d\n\nat 68.     Finally, at this second step, we conclude that the\n\nCommonwealth did not \"legally or practically obligate[] itself to\n\npay [PRPA's] indebtedness\" in the pending action.     Id. at 68, 72.\n\nWe thus conclude that PRPA may not assert the Commonwealth's\n\nimmunity from this suit.\n\n                                  A.\n\n           The first structural indicator is Puerto Rico law's\n\ncharacterization of PRPA.     We focus on PRPA's enabling act (the\n\n\"Act\").   P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23 § 331, et seq.10   Like the enabling\n\n\nBd., 527 U.S. 666, 675 (1999) (\"We have long recognized that a\nState's sovereign immunity is 'a personal privilege which it may\nwaive at pleasure.'\" (quoting Clark v. Barnard, 108 U.S. 436, 447\n(1883))); see also Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Doe, 519 U.S.\n425, 427 n.2 (1997) (expressly reserving on the question \"whether\nthere may be some state instrumentalities that qualify as 'arms of\nthe State' for some purposes but not others\").\n     10The parties point to no decisions of the Puerto Rico Supreme\nCourt that purport to characterize PRPA's status, and we are not\naware of any. We are aware that, in 2007, the Commonwealth of\nPuerto Rico filed an amicus brief in the FMC litigation in which\nit stated that it \"specifically agree[d]\" with PRPA that PRPA was\n\n\n                                - 20 -\n\fact in Fresenius, this one \"does not by its terms structure [PRPA]\n\nto be an arm of the [Commonwealth].\"   Fresenius, 322 F.3d at 68.\n\nWe thus need to determine what signals the Act nevertheless sends.\n\n          In Fresenius, we concluded that, far from indicating\n\nthat the public corporation at issue was structured to be an \"arm,\"\n\nthe relevant Puerto Rico enabling act characterized the entity in\n\nterms that \"suggest[ed] exactly the opposite.\"    Id.   There, the\n\nact referred to the entity as one \"independent and separate from\n\nany other agency or instrumentality of the Government of the\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico.\"     P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 24 § 343a\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n          Following Fresenius, we addressed another Puerto Rico\n\nenabling act that, like the one in Fresenius, did not expressly\n\ncharacterize the public corporation at issue as an arm of the\n\nCommonwealth.   See Pastrana-Torres, 460 F.3d at 126-27 & n.2.\n\nRather, the relevant Puerto Rico enabling act referred to the\n\nentity as a \"public corporation\" and \"an instrumentality of the\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico . . . with a juridical personality\n\nthat is independent and separate from any other entity, agency,\n\n\nan arm of the Commonwealth \"for purposes of the claims raised\nagainst it\" in the FMC suit. See Amicus Br. of Com. of P.R. at 3,\nFMC, 531 F.3d 868, 2007 WL 2344794; see also Lake Country Estates,\nInc., 440 U.S. at 401. But the Commonwealth has not expressed a\nview as to PRPA's status in this suit, and neither party contends\nthat we should interpret the Commonwealth's amicus brief in FMC as\nan indication that the Commonwealth presently views PRPA to be an\narm for purposes of this suit.\n\n\n                              - 21 -\n\fdepartment or instrumentality of the Government of Puerto Rico.\"\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 27 § 501.         Relying on Fresenius, we concluded\n\nthat this language also suggested that the public corporation at\n\nissue was not an arm.       Pastrana-Torres, 460 F.3d at 126-27 & n.2.\n\n            The language of PRPA's enabling act differs in some ways\n\nfrom the language in the enabling acts in Fresenius and Pastrana-\n\nTorres.     The Act describes PRPA as \"a government instrumentality\n\nand public corporation with a legal existence and personality\n\nseparate and apart from those of the Government and any officials\n\nthereof.\"    P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23 § 333(b) (emphasis added).                 But\n\nby   describing     the   entity    not    only    as   an   instrumentality    of\n\ngovernment but also as one that exists \"separate and apart\" from\n\nthe \"Government,\" the Act sends at least as strong a signal that\n\nPRPA is not an arm as the enabling acts in Fresenius and Pastrana-\n\nTorres sent about the status of the public corporations in those\n\ncases.\n\n            Moreover, in Royal Caribbean, we indicated that the\n\ndescription    of   PRPA   as   a   \"public       corporation\"    with   a   legal\n\nexistence \"separate and apart\" from the \"Government\" was not,\n\napparently,    an   insignificant         one   for   purposes   of   determining\n\nPRPA's status.       Rather, we explained that this description fit\n\nwith the fact that the Act empowered PRPA to \"operate[] with a\n\nconsiderable degree of autonomy\" relative to other Commonwealth-\n\ncreated entities and thus accorded with the conclusion that the\n\n\n                                     - 22 -\n\fCommonwealth did not consider PRPA to be an arm.                    Royal Caribbean,\n\n973 F.2d at 11.11\n\n             In further support of that conclusion, Royal Caribbean\n\npointed     to   the    Act's   express   statement          that    the   debts   and\n\nobligations of PRPA \"shall be deemed to be those of said government\n\ncontrolled corporation, and not those of the Commonwealth of Puerto\n\nRico.\"      Id. (quoting P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23 § 333(b)).                         And\n\nFresenius,       in    considering     this     first   structural         indicator,\n\nemphasized that the omission of such language in the enabling act\n\nin that case made it a \"closer\" one than Royal Caribbean.                          See\n\nFresenius, 322 F.3d at 69 (citing Royal Caribbean, 973 F.2d at\n\n11).\n\n             Nevertheless,       FMC    read        PRPA's     enabling      act    to\n\ncharacterize PRPA in terms that sent a different signal.                     FMC, 531\n\nF.3d at 875.          In so concluding, FMC did not mention the Act's\n\n\"separate and apart\" language.                Id.

The D.C. Circuit concluded that\n\nthose references made clear that PRPA had not been established \"as\n\na local or non-governmental entity\" and \"plainly demonstrate[]\n\nPuerto Rico's intent to create a governmental instrumentality of\n\nthe Commonwealth.\"     Id.   The D.C. Circuit then concluded that, in\n\nconsequence of those two references, the Act \"strongly suggests\n\nthat PRPA is an arm of the Commonwealth entitled to sovereign\n\nimmunity.\"    Id.\n\n             But, in keeping with our admonition that we not treat\n\nlanguage like \"government instrumentality\" as \"dispositive on arm-\n\nof-the-state questions,\" see Pastrana-Torres, 460 F.3d at 126 n.2,\n\nwe must read these references in the context of the Act's full\n\ncharacterization of PRPA.        See Fresenius, 322 F.3d at 68-69; Royal\n\nCaribbean, 973 F.2d at 11-12; Metcalf & Eddy, 991 F.2d at 941-42.\n\nAfter all, not all non-local, governmental entities are \"arms\" of\n\nthe sovereign.      See Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Doe, 519 U.S.\n\n425, 429 (1997) (\"When deciding whether a state instrumentality\n\nmay invoke the State's immunity, our cases have inquired into the\n\nrelationship    between    the   State    and   the   entity   in   question.\"\n\n(emphases added)).        In fact, not even all state-created public\n\ncorporations that the state's governor controls qualify for that\n\nstatus.      See Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452, 456 n.1 (1997)\n\n\n                                   - 24 -\n\f(concluding that the entity at issue was not an arm of the state\n\nnotwithstanding that four out of five of the entity's board members\n\nwere appointed by the state's governor).\n\n           When we consider the descriptions of PRPA to which FMC\n\nrefers in their full context, they do confirm that PRPA is what it\n\nplainly   is:   a   government-created   entity   that   is   subject    to\n\ngubernatorial control, exercises some governmental functions, and\n\nis charged with serving the Commonwealth's general welfare.             See\n\nRoyal Caribbean, 973 F.2d at 11-12.         But, on their own, these\n\ndescriptions do no more than that.       In fact, Fresenius noted that\n\n\"when Puerto Rico has chosen to make an entity an arm of the\n\n[Commonwealth],\" it has used language that is very different from\n\nthe language that we have here, such as language that refers to\n\nthe entity not only as one that is an \"instrumentality of the\n\nGovernment\" but also as one that is \"attached\" to a component part\n\nof the Commonwealth \"Government\" that directly supervises it.           See\n\nFresenius, 322 F.3d at 69-70 (pointing to the description of the\n\nPuerto Rico Medical Services Administration as an \"instrumentality\n\nof the Government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, attached to\n\nthe Commonwealth Department of Health . . . under the direction\n\nand supervision of the Secretary of Health.\" (emphases added)\n\n(quoting P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 24 § 342b)).\n\n           In light of the Act's description of PRPA as an entity\n\nthat exists \"separate and apart\" from the \"Government,\" and given\n\n\n                                - 25 -\n\fhow this description matches up with the considerable \"autonomy\"\n\nthat the Act gives PRPA relative to other Commonwealth-created\n\nentities, id. at 11, we conclude that the Act's references to PRPA\n\non which FMC relied are not strong indicators that PRPA is an arm.\n\nRather, we conclude that, in accord with our decisions in Royal\n\nCaribbean, Fresenius, and Pastrana-Torres, the Act is best read to\n\ncharacterize PRPA in terms that point away from it being an arm of\n\nthe   Commonwealth.         This    first      structural    indicator    therefore\n\nweighs     against   finding       PRPA   to    share   in   the   Commonwealth's\n\nimmunity.\n\n                                          B.\n\n             Turning   to    the    next    structural       indicator,    we    must\n\nconsider the nature of the functions that PRPA carries out.                     Here,\n\ntoo, we find no indication that Puerto Rico intended PRPA to be an\n\narm -- or, at least, no clear one.\n\n             PRPA is charged with promoting \"the general welfare\" and\n\n\"increas[ing] commerce and prosperity . . . for the benefit of the\n\npeople of Puerto Rico.\"            P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23 § 348(a).             That\n\ndescription of PRPA's function does suggest that PRPA is an arm.\n\nSee Royal Caribbean, 973 F.2d at 12 (noting that this aspect of\n\nPRPA's role points in favor of finding PRPA to be an arm of the\n\nCommonwealth); see also FMC, 531 F.3d at 875-76.12                 But PRPA also\n\n\n      12\n       PRPA points out in this regard that PRPA is immune from\ntaxes. See Royal Caribbean, 973 F.2d at 12 (identifying immunity\n\n\n                                      - 26 -\n\fhas a \"portfolio of diverse operations,\" Metcalf & Eddy, 991 F.2d\n\nat   941    n.6,    that,   as   we    have    previously    noted,      range   from\n\ngovernmental to proprietary.                 Compare Prince, 897 F.2d at 12\n\n(describing the regulation of a certain class of ship pilots as\n\none of PRPA's governmental functions), with Royal Caribbean, 973\n\nF.2d at 10 (describing \"dock-operating activities\" as one of PRPA's\n\nproprietary        functions).        And,    we   have   held,   the   proprietary\n\nfunctions are not those one expects an arm to perform.                    See id.\n\n              Thus, PRPA, like the port authority at issue in Hess,\n\nperforms a mix of functions of which some are characteristic of\n\narms and others are not.         See Hess, 513 U.S. at 45 & n.17 (noting\n\nthat    the   port     authority      performed      functions    that    could     be\n\nclassified as state, municipal, and proprietary, even though the\n\nentity was broadly set up to achieve \"a better co-ordination of\n\nthe . . . facilities of commerce in, about and through the port of\n\nNew York\" (quoting N.J. Stat. Ann. § 32:1–1 (West 1990))).                       As a\n\nresult, we conclude that, as in Hess, this structural indicator\n\ndoes not advance the inquiry into PRPA's status.                  See id. at 45.13\n\n\n\n\nfrom taxes as a fact weighing in favor of immunity); see also\nFresenius, 322 F.3d at 69 n.14 (noting that the entity at issue\nwas immune from taxes and identifying that fact as one that weighs\nin favor of immunity).\n       13\n       As noted above, neither party has attempted to characterize\nthe function that PRPA was performing in this case, and so we do\nnot consider it. See supra note 8.\n\n\n                                        - 27 -\n\f                                   C.\n\n            That brings us to the third structural indicator -- the\n\nCommonwealth's fiscal relationship to PRPA.         See Fresenius, 322\n\nF.3d at 65.   Fresenius instructs us to look at the overall fiscal\n\nrelationship and not narrowly at whether the Commonwealth would be\n\nliable for damages in this action.        See id. at 62 nn.5-6, 65 n.7,\n\n68; see also FMC, 531 F.3d at 878.        In doing so, we must consider\n\n\"whether the agency has the funding power to enable it to satisfy\n\njudgments   without   direct   state    participation   or   guarantees,\"\n\nMetcalf & Eddy, 991 F.2d at 939; whether and to what extent the\n\nentity receives state funding and support (i.e., the \"relative\n\nsize\" of the Commonwealth's contribution to PRPA's budget, see\n\nFresenius, 322 F.3d at 62 n.5), see Lake Country Estates, Inc. v.\n\nTahoe Reg'l Planning Agency, 440 U.S. 391, 401-02 (1979); \"whether\n\nthe state has immunized itself from responsibility for the agency's\n\nacts or omissions,\" Metcalf & Eddy, 991 F.2d at 940; and whether\n\nthe Commonwealth bears legal liability for the entity's debts, see\n\nHess, 513 U.S. at 45-46.\n\n                                   1.\n\n            Starting at the top of this list, PRPA has \"the funding\n\npower to enable it to satisfy judgments without direct state\n\nparticipation or guarantees.\"      Metcalf & Eddy, 991 F.2d at 939.\n\nThe Commonwealth gave PRPA the capacity to raise its own revenue\n\nthrough the issuance of bonds and fees.        See P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\n\n\n                                 - 28 -\n\f23 § 336(l)(1).   The Act also requires PRPA to issue fees that\n\n\"shall be sufficient, at least to . . . cover the expenses incurred\n\nby [PRPA],\" which presumably include PRPA's litigation expenses;14\n\nto \"pay principal and interests [sic] on any of [PRPA's] bonds;\"\n\nand to \"encourage the use of [PRPA's] facilities and services in\n\nthe most ample and varied manner that is financially feasible.\"\n\nId.15\n\n\n\n        14\n        We note that the 2013 and 2014 financial statements for\nPRPA indicate that PRPA had reserved approximately $21.5 million\nand $22.9 million, respectively, to cover anticipated litigation\ncosts.

P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23 § 354. This provision governs the\nuse of PRPA's profits or surplus, and the Supreme Court has made\nclear that for arm-of-the-state purposes \"[t]he proper focus is\nnot on the use of profits or surplus, but rather is on losses and\ndebts.\"    Hess, 513 U.S. at 51.      Moreover, PRPA generally is\nentitled to retain any profits or surplus it generates. In that\nsense, PRPA is not like the port authority found to be an arm of\nthe state in Ristow v. South Carolina Ports Authority, 58 F.3d\n1051, 1054 (4th Cir. 1995) (citing S.C. Code Ann. § 54-3-1020,\nwhich provides that \"[a]ny and all net revenues or earnings not\nnecessary or desirable for operation of [the South Carolina Ports\n\n\n                              - 29 -\n\f            In addition, as we concluded in Royal Caribbean, PRPA\n\n\"normally   .    .   .   has    not   received    substantial     Commonwealth\n\nfinancing.\"     Royal Caribbean, 973 F.2d at 10.         And we have no basis\n\nfor concluding otherwise here, given that PRPA has provided us\n\nwith no indication that this statement no longer holds true.                 On\n\nthis record, then, this case is not one in which the entity\n\nreceives \"virtually all the funds needed for [its] operation\" from\n\nthe Commonwealth.        Fresenius, 322 F.3d at 72; see also Pastrana-\n\nTorres, 460 F.3d at 128 (\"[The entity seeking immunity] has offered\n\nno   materials   substantiating       its   assertion    [that    the   entity's\n\nentire budget comes from a Commonwealth fund] and . . . it has the\n\nburden of proof.\").       Nor is it one in which the public corporation\n\ngets a majority of its funding from the Commonwealth.               See, e.g.,\n\nIn re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., 888 F.2d 940, 943-\n\n44 (1st Cir. 1989) (noting that, according to the record, \"roughly\n\n70-75 percent of the funds available to the [entity at issue] are\n\nprovided by taxpayers of the Commonwealth\").\n\n            Finally,     PRPA   generally      \"has   immunized   itself    from\n\nresponsibility for the agency's acts or omissions,\" Metcalf & Eddy,\n\n991 F.2d at 940, and the Commonwealth generally bears no legal\n\nliability for the entity's debts, see Hess, 513 U.S. at 46.                 See\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23 § 333(b); id. § 2303(b).             Thus, these last\n\n\nAuthority's] business shall be held subject to the further action\nof the General Assembly\").\n\n\n                                      - 30 -\n\ftwo features of the fiscal relationship that we must consider also\n\nstrongly suggest that this relationship is marked by a high degree\n\nof separation.\n\n                                          2.\n\n             PRPA   does   not    dispute      these     aspects   of   its   fiscal\n\nrelationship to the Commonwealth.              PRPA nevertheless contends that\n\nPRPA's fiscal connection to the Commonwealth is of a kind that\n\nindicates that PRPA was structured to be an arm.                        We are not\n\npersuaded.\n\n             First,    PRPA    notes      that    it     has    received   special,\n\ndiscretionary appropriations from the Commonwealth.                  See P.R. Laws\n\nAnn. tit. 23 § 6861.           But the fact that PRPA receives one-off,\n\ndiscretionary appropriations from the Commonwealth from time to\n\ntime does not demonstrate fiscal entwinement or dependence.                     See\n\nMetcalf & Eddy, 991 F.2d at 940-41 & n.5.\n\n             Second,    PRPA     points    out    that    the    Commonwealth    has\n\nprovided a mechanism by which it may \"act as a source of financing\n\nfor PRPA's acquisition of property\" and may transfer property to\n\nPRPA \"under the terms and conditions . . . fixed by the Governor\n\nof Puerto Rico.\"       P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23 §§ 339-339a.              But, again,\n\nthe Commonwealth's willingness to provide PRPA discrete amounts of\n\nfiscal support, at its discretion, does not itself suffice to\n\nindicate that the fiscal relationship between the Commonwealth and\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 31 -\n\fPRPA is one that reveals PRPA to be an arm.   See Metcalf & Eddy,\n\n991 F.2d at 940-41 & n.5.\n\n           Finally, PRPA relies on the same fact on which the D.C.\n\nCircuit and the District Court relied: under the Dock and Harbor\n\nAct of 1968 (the \"Dock and Harbor Act\"), P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23\n\n§ 2101, et seq., the Commonwealth is exclusively liable for paying\n\ndamages for judgments that are imposed by the Commonwealth's own\n\ncourts for certain actions that are taken by agents of PRPA while\n\nin the exercise of certain PRPA functions.    See id. § 2303(b).16\n\nThe Commonwealth's responsibility to pay for such damages under\n\n§ 2303(b) is not discretionary.   Nor is it discrete in a one-off\n\nsense.    Rather, § 2303(b) imposes a mandatory, continuous, and\n\nopen-ended obligation (albeit one that appears to be capped in any\n\nparticular suit).17\n\n\n\n\n     16 In the FMC litigation, the Commonwealth represented\nthat § 2303(b) \"waives [the Commonwealth's] sovereign immunity in\nits own courts with respect to tort claims [arising under the\nprovisions of the Dock and Harbor Act] based on the actions of\nPorts Authority employees who were acting as agents of the\nCommonwealth.\" Amicus Br. of Com. of P.R. at 10, FMC, 531 F.3d\n868, 2007 WL 2344794.\n     17 In the FMC litigation, the Commonwealth represented that\nthe government's exposure to judgments under § 2303(b) would be\nlimited by a general damages cap of $75,000. See Amicus Br. of\nCom. of P.R. at 10-11, FMC, 531 F.3d 868, 2007 WL 2344794\n(indicating that § 2303(b) operates within the sovereign immunity\nframework established by P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32 § 3077(c), which\ngenerally caps the Commonwealth's liability in authorized suits\nbrought against the Commonwealth in Commonwealth courts).\n\n\n                              - 32 -\n\f           We are not aware of a case that presents a fact pattern\n\ninvolving a fiscal tie of this kind.        Nonetheless, we believe that\n\nthis obligation is best understood to be simply a limited exception\n\nto the general fiscal independence that PRPA enjoys.               In this\n\nrespect, the specific assistance that the Commonwealth must give\n\nto PRPA under § 2303(b) is best analogized to the significant but\n\nstill limited fiscal support that sovereigns sometimes provide\n\npublic corporations without thereby indicating an intent to make\n\nthem into arms.    Cf. Metcalf & Eddy, 991 F.2d at 940 & n.5 (finding\n\nthe entity at issue not to be an arm of the Commonwealth, where\n\nthe   entity's    enabling   act    insulated   the    Commonwealth   from\n\nresponsibility for the entity's debts and where the Commonwealth\n\nmerely \"demonstrated that, when it wishes to do so, it knows\n\nexactly how to pledge the Commonwealth's resources in security for\n\n[the entity's] debts,\" citing discrete examples contained in P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. tit. 22 § 168 involving pledges in the amount of $33.7\n\nmillion and $14.7 million).\n\n           The limitations built into § 2303(b) of the Dock and\n\nHarbor Act supports this understanding.             By its terms, the act\n\ndoes not establish a mechanism for providing funds to satisfy\n\nPRPA's   judgments   without   regard   to    the    particular   types   of\n\njudgments of the entity or without regard to the particular aspects\n\nof the entity's operations that result in such judgments.          Rather,\n\nthe act generally preserves the \"wall\" between PRPA's liabilities\n\n\n                                   - 33 -\n\fand the Commonwealth's fisc, see Metcalf & Eddy, 991 F.2d at 940,\n\nby making the Commonwealth liable for damages incurred by PRPA\n\nonly for a specially delineated subset of PRPA's operations.   See\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23 § 2303(b).18\n\n          Thus, although we have held that a sovereign's general\n\npledge to backstop the entity's debts or liabilities may properly\n\ngive rise to the inference that the sovereign intends for the\n\nentity to share in its immunity,19     such an inference is not\n\nsimilarly warranted here.   Indeed, the Act expressly gives PRPA\n\nthe means to pay for judgments not implicating § 2303(b) and\n\n\n     18 See also Transcaribbean Mar. Corp. v. Commonwealth, 2002\nP.R.

See P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. tit. 23 §§ 333(b), 336(l)(1).\n\n                PRPA also has given us no reason to conclude that the\n\nlimited direct liability of the Commonwealth under § 2303(b)\n\nrepresents -- in practical terms -- the kind of substantial fiscal\n\ncommitment that indicates that PRPA was structured to be an arm.\n\nSee Irizarry-Mora v. Univ. of P.R., 647 F.3d 9, 16 (1st Cir. 2011)\n\n(finding entity at issue to be an arm of the Commonwealth where\n\n\"more than sixty percent of [the entity's] funding c[ame] from the\n\ngovernment\" and where the general mission of the entity was such\n\nthat the Commonwealth would do what was necessary to \"ensure the\n\n[entity's] financial viability\"); Pastrana-Torres, 460 F.3d at\n\n128.     In fact, PRPA has not even given us any insight into the\n\nsize of the Commonwealth's obligations under § 2303(b) as compared\n\nto the size of PRPA's own obligations to pay judgments against it.\n\n            Finally, we question the notion that, by virtue of making\n\nthe Commonwealth liable for certain of PRPA's actions, § 2303(b)\n\nnecessarily says something about the Commonwealth's intent with\n\nregard     to     whether   PRPA   shares   its   sovereign   immunity.\n\nSection 2303(b) merely represents the Commonwealth's waiver of its\n\nsovereign immunity in its own courts for the damages that the\n\nCommonwealth is required to pay in a limited set of suits under\n\nthe Dock and Harbor Act.      Cf. Great N. Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322\n\n\n                                   - 35 -\n\fU.S. 47, 54 (1944) (emphasizing that courts should not read into\n\na state's waiver of the sovereign immunity it possesses in state\n\ncourt an intent to waive Eleventh Amendment immunity in federal\n\ncourt,    as    that   \"is   not   consonant   with   our   dual   system\"   of\n\ngovernment).       And it appears that the Commonwealth itself -- and\n\nnot PRPA -- would be the proper defendant in any actions in which\n\n§ 2303(b) could make the Commonwealth liable for damages in its\n\nown courts, thus apparently making an inquiry into PRPA's status\n\nas an arm of the Commonwealth an unnecessary one were it to arise\n\nin any such cases.20\n\n                                       3.\n\n               For these reasons, we conclude that the nature of the\n\nfiscal relationship between the Commonwealth and PRPA is, overall,\n\nmarked by a high degree of separation.                The fiscal indicator\n\ntherefore points against the conclusion that PRPA is an arm of the\n\nCommonwealth.\n\n\n\n\n     20 See FMC, 531 F.3d at 880 (\"By law, the Commonwealth is\nsubstituted for PRPA [in such actions].\"); Getty Ref. & Mktg.

Unlike\n\nthe other indicators that we have considered, this one does weigh\n\nrather strongly in favor of concluding that PRPA is an arm of the\n\nCommonwealth.\n\n           As we concluded in Royal Caribbean, and as the D.C.\n\nCircuit   correctly   concluded   in     FMC,   the   Commonwealth   --   and\n\nparticularly the governor of Puerto Rico -- exercises a meaningful\n\ndegree of control and supervision over PRPA.          See Royal Caribbean,\n\n973 F.2d at 11-12; FMC, 531 F.3d at 877-78.           The governor retains\n\nformal control over PRPA through his power to appoint and remove\n\na majority of PRPA's board members.         See FMC, 531 F.3d at 877.21\n\n\n     21Four out of five of the members of PRPA's board of directors\nare heads of Commonwealth agencies. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23 § 334.\nThese ex officio members are the Secretary of Transportation, the\nSecretary of Commerce, the Executive Director of the Puerto Rico\nIndustrial Development Company (\"PRIDCO\"), and the Executive\nDirector of the Tourism Company. Id.; id. § 272 (indicating that\nthe Economic Development Administration was merged into PRIDCO).\nThe governor appoints the Secretary of Transportation, the\nSecretary of Commerce, and the Executive Director of PRIDCO with\nthe advice and consent of the Puerto Rico Senate and can remove\nthese officers at will. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3 § 6 (providing that\nthe governor \"shall have the power to remove any officer whom he\nmay appoint,\" save for an exception not applicable here); P.R.\nConst. art.

Laws Ann. tit. 23 § 280 (providing that the\ngovernor appoints the Executive Director of PRIDCO). The Executive\nDirector of the Tourism Company, by contrast, is neither appointed\nby nor subject to removal by the governor. Instead, the seven-\nmember board of the Tourism Company -- six of whom are private\n\n\n                                  - 37 -\n\fThe Commonwealth also appears to exert a great deal of control\n\nover PRPA in practice.   See id. at 878.   Finally, notwithstanding\n\nthe \"considerable degree of autonomy\" afforded to PRPA relative to\n\nother Commonwealth-created entities, Royal Caribbean, 973 F.2d at\n\n11, PRPA is subject to a variety of other means of control that\n\npoint toward an entity being deemed an arm of the Commonwealth.22\n\n\n\n\ncitizens appointed by the governor to four-year terms -- appoints\nthe Executive Director and that board has the power to remove him.\nSee P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23 §§ 671b-c. The remaining PRPA board\nmember is a private citizen whom the governor appoints with the\nadvice and consent of the Puerto Rico Senate and who is removable\nonly \"for negligence in the performance of his/her duties,\nconviction of a felony or a misdemeanor that implies moral\nturpitude, repeated and unjustified absences from Board meetings,\nconflicts of interest or total and permanent disability to perform\nthe functions of the office.\" Id. § 334. PRPA's chief executive\ndirector is appointed by and holds office at the will of PRPA's\nboard. Id. § 335.\n     22 PRPA is bound by Puerto Rico's Uniform Administrative\nProcedures Act (\"APA\"), P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23 § 336(l)(3); must\nsubmit various reports to the governor of Puerto Rico and the\nlegislature, id. § 345; Pastrana-Torres, 460 F.3d at 127 (noting\nthat mandatory compliance with the APA and mandatory submission of\nreports to the Puerto Rico governor and legislature indicate\nCommonwealth control); must maintain its funds in Commonwealth-\napproved depositories, P.R.

Laws Ann. tit. 23 § 350. Moreover, PRPA\ncontends that the fact that the Commonwealth \"has chosen to share\nits eminent [] domain authority with the PRPA, in a scheme that\ndirectly involves the Governor and other members of the Executive\nBranch,\" is also suggestive of Commonwealth control. P.R. Laws\nAnn. tit. 23 §§ 339-339a.\n\n\n                              - 38 -\n\f                                        E.\n\n           Summing up, the control indicator favors finding PRPA to\n\nbe an arm of the Commonwealth while the other structural indicators\n\nof    PRPA's   status   either     point     affirmatively     against    that\n\nconclusion (in the case of how Puerto Rico law characterizes PRPA\n\nand in the case of the fiscal relationship between PRPA and the\n\nCommonwealth) or are neutral (in the case of an overall assessment\n\nof PRPA's functions).       Because the structural indicators of PRPA's\n\nstatus do not show that the Commonwealth \"clearly structured [PRPA]\n\nto share its sovereignty,\" Fresenius, 322 F.3d at 68, we must\n\nproceed to the second step of the analysis that Fresenius requires\n\nus to undertake, id. at 68, 72.\n\n           Here, the picture is quite clear.            PRPA has failed to\n\nshow that this action poses any risk to the Commonwealth's fisc.\n\nPRPA does not contend, and we see no basis for concluding, that\n\nthe Commonwealth would, as a legal matter, be liable for a judgment\n\nagainst PRPA in this case.         See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23 § 333(b).\n\nIn addition, the Commonwealth did not structure PRPA so that the\n\nCommonwealth would be liable, as a practical matter, for any such\n\nadverse judgment.\n\n           In this regard, we note that the Commonwealth designed\n\nPRPA to raise enough revenue to shoulder its own costs, including\n\nits   litigation   costs,    and   to    bear   its   own   debts,   including\n\n\n\n\n                                    - 39 -\n\f(generally) any judgments against it.23              Moreover, PRPA has done\n\nnothing to meet its burden to show that the Commonwealth's limited\n\nexposure in other courts under the Dock and Harbor Act renders any\n\njudgment in this action one that, in practical effect, likely would\n\nbe paid out of the Commonwealth's fisc.               Compare Fresenius, 322\n\nF.3d at 72-75 (finding insufficient case-specific risk to the\n\npublic        fisc   even     though    the     Commonwealth       had   provided\n\napproximately 26% of the entity's revenue in recent years), with\n\nIrizarry-Mora, 647 F.3d at 16-17 (finding sufficient case-specific\n\nrisk     to    the   public   fisc     in   part   because   the    Commonwealth\n\ncontributed at least 60% of the entity's funding).\n\n               Thus, the second step of the Fresenius analysis does not\n\nshow PRPA to be entitled to claim the Commonwealth's immunity.\n\nAnd so, given the mixed signals sent by the structural indicators\n\nof PRPA's status at the first step of the Fresenius analysis, we\n\nconclude that PRPA has not met its burden to show that it is an\n\narm of the Commonwealth entitled to immunity from this suit.                 See\n\nFresenius, 322 F.3d at 68 (\"[W]here the evidence is that the state\n\ndid not structure the entity to put the state treasury at risk of\n\n\n\n       23\n        PRPA does not contend -- by virtue of P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\n23 § 2303(b) or otherwise -- that PRPA was \"so structured that, as\na practical matter, the [Commonwealth] anticipated budget\nshortfalls that would render [PRPA] constantly dependent on [the\nCommonwealth],\" such that that the Commonwealth would be forced to\nrefill PRPA's coffers in the event of any adverse judgment here.\nFresenius, 322 F.3d at 65 n.8.\n\n\n                                       - 40 -\n\fpaying the judgment, then the fact that the state appoints the\n\nmajority of the governing board of the agency does not itself lead\n\nto the conclusion that the entity is an arm of the state.\").\n\n                                V.\n\n          We close by addressing PRPA's final argument.         PRPA\n\nrelies on language in the Supreme Court's decision in Federal\n\nMaritime Commission v. South Carolina Ports Authority (\"SCPA\"),\n\n535 U.S. 743 (2002).\n\n          That case did not involve a dispute over whether the\n\nport authority there at issue was an arm of the state.   That case\n\ninvolved a dispute over whether the sovereign immunity that the\n\nEleventh Amendment presupposes protects sovereigns from appearing\n\nin federal administrative proceedings.\n\n          PRPA relies on the following statement that the Court\n\nmade in resolving that distinct question:\n\n     While state sovereign immunity serves the important\n     function of shielding state treasuries and thus\n     preserving the States' ability to govern in accordance\n     with the will of their citizens, the doctrine's central\n     purpose is to accord the States the respect owed them as\n     joint sovereigns.\n\nId. at 765 (quotation marks and citations omitted).   PRPA contends\n\nthat this same logic supports its position here.   PRPA argues that\n\njust as a sovereign may assert immunity from federal administrative\n\nproceedings even though those proceedings pose no obvious threat\n\nto the sovereign's fisc, PRPA should not be barred from asserting\n\n\n\n                              - 41 -\n\fthe Commonwealth's immunity in this case simply because this suit\n\nposes no risk to the Commonwealth's fisc.                       But PRPA appears to\n\nmisapprehend         the   reason      that    it   may   not      claim    arm-of-the-\n\nCommonwealth status.\n\n              The fact that this suit poses no fiscal risk to the\n\nCommonwealth dooms PRPA's claim to immunity only because -- as our\n\nanalysis of the structural indicators reveals -- the Commonwealth\n\nhas sent mixed signals about PRPA's status.                   By declining to read\n\nthose mixed signals to express the Commonwealth's intent to make\n\nPRPA an \"arm,\" we do not give short shrift to the Commonwealth's\n\ndignity.      Rather, in exercising such caution, see Fresenius, 322\n\nF.3d    at   63   (\"[W]here       an     entity     claims    to    share    a   state's\n\nsovereignty and the state has not clearly demarcated the entity as\n\nsharing its sovereignty, there is great reason for caution.\"), we\n\nsimply      ensure    that   we     do   not    wrongly      confer    immunity     that\n\nultimately belongs to the Commonwealth on an entity that the\n\nCommonwealth did not intend to benefit in that way, see id. (\"It\n\nwould be every bit as much an affront to the state's dignity and\n\nfiscal interests were a federal court to find erroneously that an\n\nentity was an arm of the state [as it would be were a federal court\n\nto find erroneously that an entity was not], when the state did\n\nnot structure the entity to share its sovereignty.\").24\n\n\n       24\n       To the extent that PRPA means to argue that we must make\nthe control indicator dispositive in order to honor the spirit of\n\n\n                                          - 42 -\n\f                                 VI.\n\n          For the reasons given, the judgment of the District Court\n\nis reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\nSCPA, we disagree. The Supreme Court considered and rejected that\napproach in Hess, see 513 U.S. at 48; see also Auer, 519 U.S. at\n456 n.1, and because SCPA did not concern a dispute about which\nentities qualify as arms of the state, it cannot possibly be read\nto have overruled Hess in this regard. See Medeiros v. Vincent,\n431 F.3d 25, 36 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"In the event [the Supreme Court\ndecision at issue] is no longer good law, it should be for the\nSupreme Court explicitly to overrule it.\"); Woods v.

State-created       public\n\ncorporations serve a range of special purposes.                Sometimes states\n\nstructure these entities to be so closely tied to the state\n\ngovernment -- in terms, among other things, of how they are funded\n\nand how they are supervised -- that they are properly understood\n\nto be \"arms\" of the state itself.          As a result, such entities may\n\nclaim the very same sovereign immunity from suit that the state\n\nenjoys   under    the   Eleventh    Amendment       of   the    United   States\n\nConstitution.     Sometimes, however, states structure these entities\n\nto operate at such a remove from the state government that they\n\nare not properly understood to be arms of the state.               When states\n\nset up such entities in that way, they are not entitled to share\n\nin the state's immunity.\n\n            What is true of states is also true of the Commonwealth\n\nof Puerto Rico.     It, too, we have held, is entitled to assert the\n\nsovereign immunity that states enjoy.               It, too, has created a\n\nnumber of special-purpose public corporations.             And, it, too, has\n\nstructured some of them to be very closely tied to the Commonwealth\n\ngovernment and some to operate separate and apart from it.\n\n            Unfortunately, it is not always easy to tell whether a\n\nsovereign   has    structured     one    of   its   special-purpose      public\n\ncorporations to be an \"arm.\"            Disputes over classification thus\n\nfrequently arise, such as this one, in which we must decide whether\n\none of the Commonwealth's special-purpose public corporations, the\n\n\n                                    - 2 -\n\fPuerto   Rico    Ports   Authority       (\"PRPA\"),    is     an   arm   of    the\n\nCommonwealth.\n\n           We have twice before -- albeit decades ago -- addressed\n\nPRPA's status.      In each case, we reached a different conclusion\n\nbased on the distinct nature of the particular function that PRPA\n\nwas performing that gave rise to the underlying suit.                   After we\n\ndecided those cases, however, we refined our arm-of-the-state\n\nanalysis in response to intervening Supreme Court precedent.                  In\n\nthis case, based on that refined analysis and the arguments that\n\nPRPA makes to us, we conclude that PRPA is not entitled to assert\n\nthe   Commonwealth's     immunity   as    an    arm   of    the   Commonwealth.\n\nAccordingly, we reverse the District Court's order of dismissal\n\nand remand for further proceedings.\n\n                                     I.\n\n           Puerto      Rico   law    established           the    Puerto     Rico\n\nTransportation Authority as a public corporation in 1942.

We thus start with our two\n\nprior decisions that directly addressed whether PRPA is an arm of\n\nthe   Commonwealth     but    that    reached     opposite,      case-specific\n\noutcomes.

Finally, we describe both\n\nthe   D.C.

Id. at 2-3.4\n\n              To determine PRPA's status, we relied on a multi-factor\n\nframework drawn from our decision in Ainsworth Aristocrat Int'l\n\nParty Ltd. v. Tourism Co. of P.R. (\"Ainsworth\"), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488522\"><a href=\"/opinion/488522/ainsworth-aristocrat-international-pty-limited-v-tourism-company-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1034</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1037 (1st Cir. 1987).      See Prince, 897 F.2d at 9.   Accordingly, we\n\ndescribed how Puerto Rico law characterized PRPA's status, listed\n\nthe various powers and functions of PRPA, and provided a brief\n\naccount of PRPA's fiscal relationship to the Commonwealth.       Id. at\n\n9-10.       After reviewing those aspects of PRPA, we concluded that\n\n\"whether the PRPA is entitled to eleventh amendment protection\n\ndepends upon the type of activity it engages in and the nature of\n\nthe claim asserted against it.\"      Id. at 10.\n\n              Turning to those features of the case, we explained that\n\nthe pilot in question was not acting as an agent of PRPA and that\n\nPRPA's relationship to the pilot was like that of a regulator.\n\nId. at 12.      We then held that, in light of the governmental nature\n\nof the function for which the suit was seeking to hold PRPA liable,\n\nPRPA was acting as an arm of the Commonwealth and thus that PRPA\n\n\n        4\n       The pilot in question was a so-called \"compulsory pilot.\"\nPrince, 897 F.2d at 3.

Id. at 9.   We again relied on the multi-factor\n\nframework set forth in Ainsworth.              Id. (citing Ainsworth, 818 F.2d\n\nat 1037).\n\n             We found that PRPA acted as a proprietor rather than as\n\na   regulator    in    maintaining       the     docks;    that   PRPA    generally\n\n\"operate[d] with a considerable degree of autonomy,\" id. at 11,\n\nconsistent with its denomination as a \"public corporation\" with a\n\n\"legal existence and personality separate and apart from those of\n\nthe Government,\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23 § 333(b); that PRPA (and\n\nnot the Commonwealth) would likely pay any adverse judgment in the\n\nevent that PRPA were not immune; and that PRPA enjoyed a great\n\ndeal    of   fiscal    independence       from    the     Commonwealth.       Royal\n\nCaribbean, 973 F.2d at 10-12.                 We concluded that these facts\n\nweighed against deeming PRPA to be an arm of the Commonwealth.\n\nId.     In particular, we concluded that PRPA's general fiscal\n\nindependence from the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth's lack of\n\npotential liability in the suit at hand weighed \"heavily\" against\n\ndeeming PRPA to be an arm of the Commonwealth.                    Id. at 11.      We\n\n\n                                        - 10 -\n\ffurther concluded that these facts outweighed the facts that\n\nfavored PRPA's claim to arm-of-the-Commonwealth status -- namely,\n\nthe fact that the Commonwealth exercised a meaningful amount of\n\ncontrol and supervision over PRPA and the fact that PRPA was\n\ngenerally    charged   with     advancing   the   interests   of   the\n\nCommonwealth.   Id. at 11-12.\n\n            We thus held in Royal Caribbean that, notwithstanding\n\nour holding in Prince, PRPA was not entitled to assert immunity,\n\nas an arm of the Commonwealth, from the suit then before us.       We\n\nattributed the difference between that holding and the one in\n\nPrince to the fact that the \"relevant 'type of activity'\" PRPA was\n\nperforming was \"fundamentally different\" in the two cases.     Id. at\n\n12 (quoting Prince, 897 F.2d at 10).          As we put it, \"[t]he\n\ndifference between the primarily 'governmental function' at issue\n\nin [Prince], and the basically 'proprietary function' . . . at\n\nissue [in Royal Caribbean] explains the difference in result.\"\n\nId.\n\n            A year later, in Metcalf & Eddy, Inc. v.

This examination requires\n\nconsideration of the broad range of structural indicators that\n\nHess and Metcalf & Eddy identified as relevant.                   See id. at 62\n\nn.6, 65 n.7, 68.5         These structural indicators include how state\n\nlaw characterizes the entity, the nature of the functions performed\n\nby the entity, the entity's overall fiscal relationship to the\n\nCommonwealth (as opposed to whether the Commonwealth is liable for\n\nany judgment in the particular case at hand), and how much control\n\nthe state exercises over the operations of the entity.                   Id.\n\n             Fresenius     explained    that    if    the   analysis     of    these\n\nstructural indicators reveals that \"the state clearly structured\n\nthe entity to share its sovereignty,\" then the entity is an arm of\n\nthe state and the analysis is at an end.

In that event, Fresenius holds, we\n\nmust proceed to the second step of the analysis.                               Any other\n\napproach, we explained, would give insufficient respect to the\n\ndignity   interest     of    the     sovereign       that    created          the    public\n\ncorporation and that may choose not to have that public corporation\n\nshare in the sovereign's immunity.              Id. at 65, 68.\n\n            At   the   second        step,    according          to     Fresenius,     the\n\n\"dispositive question concerns the risk that the damages will be\n\npaid from the public treasury\" and \"[t]his analysis focuses on\n\nwhether the state has legally or practically obligated itself to\n\npay the entity's indebtedness\" in the pending action.                         Id. at 68,\n\n72.   If the state is so obligated, then the entity may claim the\n\nstate's immunity, even though the structural indicators do not\n\nthemselves provide a sufficient indication that the entity is an\n\narm of the state.

In FMC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187220\"><a href=\"/opinion/187220/puerto-rico-ports-v-federal-maritime/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">868</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the D.C. Circuit\n\naddressed    PRPA's   claim   to    immunity   --   as   an    arm   of   the\n\n\n                                    - 15 -\n\fCommonwealth -- in an administrative proceeding before the Federal\n\nMaritime Commission.   Id. at 871.    The D.C. Circuit concluded, on\n\nthe basis of Fresenius, that our holdings in Prince and Royal\n\nCaribbean should be accorded little weight.         The D.C. Circuit\n\nexplained that, in Fresenius, \"the First Circuit . . . expressly\n\ndeparted from that narrow focus on governmental-versus-proprietary\n\nfunctions as the test for assessing the sovereign immunity of a\n\nspecial-purpose corporation.\"     Id. at 874 n.3.\n\n          In line with the first step of the Fresenius analysis,\n\nFMC assessed the structural indicators of PRPA's status as a whole.\n\nSee id. at 874-80.     The D.C. Circuit identified the relevant\n\nstructural indicators as: \"state intent, including the entity's\n\nfunctions; state control; and the entity's overall effects on the\n\nstate treasury.\"   Id. at 873.   The D.C. Circuit concluded that all\n\nthree of these structural indicators -- including the functions\n\nthat PRPA had been assigned to perform, when considered as a\n\nwhole -- pointed toward the conclusion that PRPA is an arm of the\n\nCommonwealth.   See id. at 874-80.   On that basis, the D.C. Circuit\n\nheld that PRPA was entitled to assert the Commonwealth's immunity.\n\nId. at 881.\n\n          Consistent with its observation that \"once an entity is\n\ndetermined to be an arm of the State under the three-factor test,\n\nthat conclusion applies unless and until there are relevant changes\n\nin the state law governing that entity,\" the D.C. Circuit did not\n\n\n                                 - 16 -\n\fundertake any further analysis.    Id. at 873.    As a result, the\n\nD.C. Circuit did not address the proper approach to follow in the\n\nevent that the structural indicators do not send a sufficiently\n\nclear signal as to an entity's status.   Nor, in consequence of its\n\nruling, did the D.C. Circuit engage in the second step of the\n\nFresenius analysis, at which the question whether the pending\n\naction places the Commonwealth's fisc at risk is dispositive.7\n\n          And that brings us, finally, to this case, in which\n\nPRPA's status is once again in dispute.     The District Court, in\n\naddressing whether PRPA is an arm, concluded that FMC was right to\n\ngive little weight to our prior holdings about PRPA's status\n\nbecause they focused too narrowly on the particular function that\n\nPRPA was performing in the case at hand.

We proceed accordingly.9\n\n\n        9\n       With respect to our two prior precedents assessing PRPA's\nstatus, PRPA argues only that the structural indicators that\nFresenius requires us to consider reveal PRPA to be an arm of the\nCommonwealth; that Royal Caribbean does not permit us to reach a\ndifferent conclusion; and that Prince accords with the conclusion\nthat PRPA is an arm (though PRPA does not argue that Prince\ncontrols the outcome here). The plaintiffs, by contrast, make no\nreference to Prince and instead argue only that, under the\nframework that Fresenius establishes, PRPA was not structured to\nbe an arm of the Commonwealth and that this conclusion accords\nwith our decision in Royal Caribbean. Thus, the parties do not\nask us to decide whether it is possible -- as our pre-Fresenius\nprecedents contemplate -- that PRPA could be immune in the\nperformance of functions such as those identified in Prince but\nnot in the performance of functions such as those identified in\nRoyal Caribbean. Nor does either party contend that the outcome\nhere depends on our deciding whether a sovereign may structure an\nentity to be an arm only when performing certain functions and not\nwhen performing others or whether, instead, a sovereign must be\ndeemed to have structured an entity to be an arm in all cases so\nlong as it structures the entity to be an arm in one case. Given\nthe importance of that more general question, and the absence of\nbriefing on it, we decline to resolve it here. We do note, though,\nthat to the extent that dicta in the District Court's\ndecision -- or in FMC -- could be read to suggest that a sovereign\nmay not structure an entity to be a hybrid, see Grajales II, 81 F.\nSupp. 3d at 162-63; FMC, 531 F.3d at 873, we question why that\nwould be the case, given basic federalism principles and that a\nsovereign may waive its Eleventh Amendment immunity if it wishes.\nSee Coll.

But\n\nby   describing     the   entity    not    only    as   an   instrumentality    of\n\ngovernment but also as one that exists \"separate and apart\" from\n\nthe \"Government,\" the Act sends at least as strong a signal that\n\nPRPA is not an arm as the enabling acts in Fresenius and Pastrana-\n\nTorres sent about the status of the public corporations in those\n\ncases.\n\n            Moreover, in Royal Caribbean, we indicated that the\n\ndescription    of   PRPA   as   a   \"public       corporation\"    with   a   legal\n\nexistence \"separate and apart\" from the \"Government\" was not,\n\napparently,    an   insignificant         one   for   purposes   of   determining\n\nPRPA's status.       Rather, we explained that this description fit\n\nwith the fact that the Act empowered PRPA to \"operate[] with a\n\nconsiderable degree of autonomy\" relative to other Commonwealth-\n\ncreated entities and thus accorded with the conclusion that the\n\n\n                                     - 22 -\n\fCommonwealth did not consider PRPA to be an arm.                    Royal Caribbean,\n\n973 F.2d at 11.11\n\n             In further support of that conclusion, Royal Caribbean\n\npointed     to   the    Act's   express   statement          that    the   debts   and\n\nobligations of PRPA \"shall be deemed to be those of said government\n\ncontrolled corporation, and not those of the Commonwealth of Puerto\n\nRico.\"      Id. (quoting P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23 § 333(b)).                         And\n\nFresenius,       in    considering     this     first   structural         indicator,\n\nemphasized that the omission of such language in the enabling act\n\nin that case made it a \"closer\" one than Royal Caribbean.                          See\n\nFresenius, 322 F.3d at 69 (citing Royal Caribbean, 973 F.2d at\n\n11).\n\n             Nevertheless,       FMC    read        PRPA's     enabling      act    to\n\ncharacterize PRPA in terms that sent a different signal.                     FMC, 531\n\nF.3d at 875.          In so concluding, FMC did not mention the Act's\n\n\"separate and apart\" language.                Id.

See\n\nRoyal Caribbean, 973 F.2d at 11-12.         But, on their own, these\n\ndescriptions do no more than that.       In fact, Fresenius noted that\n\n\"when Puerto Rico has chosen to make an entity an arm of the\n\n[Commonwealth],\" it has used language that is very different from\n\nthe language that we have here, such as language that refers to\n\nthe entity not only as one that is an \"instrumentality of the\n\nGovernment\" but also as one that is \"attached\" to a component part\n\nof the Commonwealth \"Government\" that directly supervises it.           See\n\nFresenius, 322 F.3d at 69-70 (pointing to the description of the\n\nPuerto Rico Medical Services Administration as an \"instrumentality\n\nof the Government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, attached to\n\nthe Commonwealth Department of Health . . . under the direction\n\nand supervision of the Secretary of Health.\" (emphases added)\n\n(quoting P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 24 § 342b)).\n\n           In light of the Act's description of PRPA as an entity\n\nthat exists \"separate and apart\" from the \"Government,\" and given\n\n\n                                - 25 -\n\fhow this description matches up with the considerable \"autonomy\"\n\nthat the Act gives PRPA relative to other Commonwealth-created\n\nentities, id. at 11, we conclude that the Act's references to PRPA\n\non which FMC relied are not strong indicators that PRPA is an arm.\n\nRather, we conclude that, in accord with our decisions in Royal\n\nCaribbean, Fresenius, and Pastrana-Torres, the Act is best read to\n\ncharacterize PRPA in terms that point away from it being an arm of\n\nthe   Commonwealth.         This    first      structural    indicator    therefore\n\nweighs     against   finding       PRPA   to    share   in   the   Commonwealth's\n\nimmunity.\n\n                                          B.\n\n             Turning   to    the    next    structural       indicator,    we    must\n\nconsider the nature of the functions that PRPA carries out.                     Here,\n\ntoo, we find no indication that Puerto Rico intended PRPA to be an\n\narm -- or, at least, no clear one.\n\n             PRPA is charged with promoting \"the general welfare\" and\n\n\"increas[ing] commerce and prosperity . . . for the benefit of the\n\npeople of Puerto Rico.\"            P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23 § 348(a).             That\n\ndescription of PRPA's function does suggest that PRPA is an arm.\n\nSee Royal Caribbean, 973 F.2d at 12 (noting that this aspect of\n\nPRPA's role points in favor of finding PRPA to be an arm of the\n\nCommonwealth); see also FMC, 531 F.3d at 875-76.12                 But PRPA also\n\n\n      12\n       PRPA points out in this regard that PRPA is immune from\ntaxes. See Royal Caribbean, 973 F.2d at 12 (identifying immunity\n\n\n                                      - 26 -\n\fhas a \"portfolio of diverse operations,\" Metcalf & Eddy, 991 F.2d\n\nat   941    n.6,    that,   as   we    have    previously    noted,      range   from\n\ngovernmental to proprietary.                 Compare Prince, 897 F.2d at 12\n\n(describing the regulation of a certain class of ship pilots as\n\none of PRPA's governmental functions), with Royal Caribbean, 973\n\nF.2d at 10 (describing \"dock-operating activities\" as one of PRPA's\n\nproprietary        functions).        And,    we   have   held,   the   proprietary\n\nfunctions are not those one expects an arm to perform.                    See id.\n\n              Thus, PRPA, like the port authority at issue in Hess,\n\nperforms a mix of functions of which some are characteristic of\n\narms and others are not.         See Hess, 513 U.S. at 45 & n.17 (noting\n\nthat    the   port     authority      performed      functions    that    could     be\n\nclassified as state, municipal, and proprietary, even though the\n\nentity was broadly set up to achieve \"a better co-ordination of\n\nthe . . . facilities of commerce in, about and through the port of\n\nNew York\" (quoting N.J. Stat. Ann. § 32:1–1 (West 1990))).                       As a\n\nresult, we conclude that, as in Hess, this structural indicator\n\ndoes not advance the inquiry into PRPA's status.                  See id. at 45.13\n\n\n\n\nfrom taxes as a fact weighing in favor of immunity); see also\nFresenius, 322 F.3d at 69 n.14 (noting that the entity at issue\nwas immune from taxes and identifying that fact as one that weighs\nin favor of immunity).\n       13\n       As noted above, neither party has attempted to characterize\nthe function that PRPA was performing in this case, and so we do\nnot consider it. See supra note 8.\n\n\n                                        - 27 -\n\f                                   C.\n\n            That brings us to the third structural indicator -- the\n\nCommonwealth's fiscal relationship to PRPA.         See Fresenius, 322\n\nF.3d at 65.   Fresenius instructs us to look at the overall fiscal\n\nrelationship and not narrowly at whether the Commonwealth would be\n\nliable for damages in this action.        See id. at 62 nn.5-6, 65 n.7,\n\n68; see also FMC, 531 F.3d at 878.        In doing so, we must consider\n\n\"whether the agency has the funding power to enable it to satisfy\n\njudgments   without   direct   state    participation   or   guarantees,\"\n\nMetcalf & Eddy, 991 F.2d at 939; whether and to what extent the\n\nentity receives state funding and support (i.e., the \"relative\n\nsize\" of the Commonwealth's contribution to PRPA's budget, see\n\nFresenius, 322 F.3d at 62 n.5), see Lake Country Estates, Inc. v.\n\nTahoe Reg'l Planning Agency, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110033\"><a href=\"/opinion/110033/lake-country-estates-inc-v-tahoe-regional-planning-agency/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 401-02 (1979); \"whether\n\nthe state has immunized itself from responsibility for the agency's\n\nacts or omissions,\" Metcalf & Eddy, 991 F.2d at 940; and whether\n\nthe Commonwealth bears legal liability for the entity's debts, see\n\nHess, 513 U.S. at 45-46.\n\n                                   1.\n\n            Starting at the top of this list, PRPA has \"the funding\n\npower to enable it to satisfy judgments without direct state\n\nparticipation or guarantees.\"      Metcalf & Eddy, 991 F.2d at 939.\n\nThe Commonwealth gave PRPA the capacity to raise its own revenue\n\nthrough the issuance of bonds and fees.

The Act also requires PRPA to issue fees that\n\n\"shall be sufficient, at least to . . . cover the expenses incurred\n\nby [PRPA],\" which presumably include PRPA's litigation expenses;14\n\nto \"pay principal and interests [sic] on any of [PRPA's] bonds;\"\n\nand to \"encourage the use of [PRPA's] facilities and services in\n\nthe most ample and varied manner that is financially feasible.\"\n\nId.15\n\n\n\n        14\n        We note that the 2013 and 2014 financial statements for\nPRPA indicate that PRPA had reserved approximately $21.5 million\nand $22.9 million, respectively, to cover anticipated litigation\ncosts.

This provision governs the\nuse of PRPA's profits or surplus, and the Supreme Court has made\nclear that for arm-of-the-state purposes \"[t]he proper focus is\nnot on the use of profits or surplus, but rather is on losses and\ndebts.\"    Hess, 513 U.S. at 51.

PRPA nevertheless contends that\n\nPRPA's fiscal connection to the Commonwealth is of a kind that\n\nindicates that PRPA was structured to be an arm.                        We are not\n\npersuaded.\n\n             First,    PRPA    notes      that    it     has    received   special,\n\ndiscretionary appropriations from the Commonwealth.                  See P.R. Laws\n\nAnn. tit. 23 § 6861.           But the fact that PRPA receives one-off,\n\ndiscretionary appropriations from the Commonwealth from time to\n\ntime does not demonstrate fiscal entwinement or dependence.                     See\n\nMetcalf & Eddy, 991 F.2d at 940-41 & n.5.\n\n             Second,    PRPA     points    out    that    the    Commonwealth    has\n\nprovided a mechanism by which it may \"act as a source of financing\n\nfor PRPA's acquisition of property\" and may transfer property to\n\nPRPA \"under the terms and conditions . . . fixed by the Governor\n\nof Puerto Rico.\"       P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23 §§ 339-339a.              But, again,\n\nthe Commonwealth's willingness to provide PRPA discrete amounts of\n\nfiscal support, at its discretion, does not itself suffice to\n\nindicate that the fiscal relationship between the Commonwealth and\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 31 -\n\fPRPA is one that reveals PRPA to be an arm.   See Metcalf & Eddy,\n\n991 F.2d at 940-41 & n.5.\n\n           Finally, PRPA relies on the same fact on which the D.C.\n\nCircuit and the District Court relied: under the Dock and Harbor\n\nAct of 1968 (the \"Dock and Harbor Act\"), P.R.

Nonetheless, we believe that\n\nthis obligation is best understood to be simply a limited exception\n\nto the general fiscal independence that PRPA enjoys.               In this\n\nrespect, the specific assistance that the Commonwealth must give\n\nto PRPA under § 2303(b) is best analogized to the significant but\n\nstill limited fiscal support that sovereigns sometimes provide\n\npublic corporations without thereby indicating an intent to make\n\nthem into arms.    Cf. Metcalf & Eddy, 991 F.2d at 940 & n.5 (finding\n\nthe entity at issue not to be an arm of the Commonwealth, where\n\nthe   entity's    enabling   act    insulated   the    Commonwealth   from\n\nresponsibility for the entity's debts and where the Commonwealth\n\nmerely \"demonstrated that, when it wishes to do so, it knows\n\nexactly how to pledge the Commonwealth's resources in security for\n\n[the entity's] debts,\" citing discrete examples contained in P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. tit. 22 § 168 involving pledges in the amount of $33.7\n\nmillion and $14.7 million).\n\n           The limitations built into § 2303(b) of the Dock and\n\nHarbor Act supports this understanding.             By its terms, the act\n\ndoes not establish a mechanism for providing funds to satisfy\n\nPRPA's   judgments   without   regard   to    the    particular   types   of\n\njudgments of the entity or without regard to the particular aspects\n\nof the entity's operations that result in such judgments.

In fact, PRPA has not even given us any insight into the\n\nsize of the Commonwealth's obligations under § 2303(b) as compared\n\nto the size of PRPA's own obligations to pay judgments against it.\n\n            Finally, we question the notion that, by virtue of making\n\nthe Commonwealth liable for certain of PRPA's actions, § 2303(b)\n\nnecessarily says something about the Commonwealth's intent with\n\nregard     to     whether   PRPA   shares   its   sovereign   immunity.\n\nSection 2303(b) merely represents the Commonwealth's waiver of its\n\nsovereign immunity in its own courts for the damages that the\n\nCommonwealth is required to pay in a limited set of suits under\n\nthe Dock and Harbor Act.

And it appears that the Commonwealth itself -- and\n\nnot PRPA -- would be the proper defendant in any actions in which\n\n§ 2303(b) could make the Commonwealth liable for damages in its\n\nown courts, thus apparently making an inquiry into PRPA's status\n\nas an arm of the Commonwealth an unnecessary one were it to arise\n\nin any such cases.20\n\n                                       3.\n\n               For these reasons, we conclude that the nature of the\n\nfiscal relationship between the Commonwealth and PRPA is, overall,\n\nmarked by a high degree of separation.

See Royal Caribbean,\n\n973 F.2d at 11-12; FMC, 531 F.3d at 877-78.           The governor retains\n\nformal control over PRPA through his power to appoint and remove\n\na majority of PRPA's board members.         See FMC, 531 F.3d at 877.21\n\n\n     21Four out of five of the members of PRPA's board of directors\nare heads of Commonwealth agencies. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23 § 334.\nThese ex officio members are the Secretary of Transportation, the\nSecretary of Commerce, the Executive Director of the Puerto Rico\nIndustrial Development Company (\"PRIDCO\"), and the Executive\nDirector of the Tourism Company. Id.; id. § 272 (indicating that\nthe Economic Development Administration was merged into PRIDCO).\nThe governor appoints the Secretary of Transportation, the\nSecretary of Commerce, and the Executive Director of PRIDCO with\nthe advice and consent of the Puerto Rico Senate and can remove\nthese officers at will.

Laws Ann. tit. 23 § 280 (providing that the\ngovernor appoints the Executive Director of PRIDCO). The Executive\nDirector of the Tourism Company, by contrast, is neither appointed\nby nor subject to removal by the governor. Instead, the seven-\nmember board of the Tourism Company -- six of whom are private\n\n\n                                  - 37 -\n\fThe Commonwealth also appears to exert a great deal of control\n\nover PRPA in practice.   See id. at 878.   Finally, notwithstanding\n\nthe \"considerable degree of autonomy\" afforded to PRPA relative to\n\nother Commonwealth-created entities, Royal Caribbean, 973 F.2d at\n\n11, PRPA is subject to a variety of other means of control that\n\npoint toward an entity being deemed an arm of the Commonwealth.22\n\n\n\n\ncitizens appointed by the governor to four-year terms -- appoints\nthe Executive Director and that board has the power to remove him.\nSee P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23 §§ 671b-c. The remaining PRPA board\nmember is a private citizen whom the governor appoints with the\nadvice and consent of the Puerto Rico Senate and who is removable\nonly \"for negligence in the performance of his/her duties,\nconviction of a felony or a misdemeanor that implies moral\nturpitude, repeated and unjustified absences from Board meetings,\nconflicts of interest or total and permanent disability to perform\nthe functions of the office.\" Id. § 334. PRPA's chief executive\ndirector is appointed by and holds office at the will of PRPA's\nboard. Id. § 335.\n     22 PRPA is bound by Puerto Rico's Uniform Administrative\nProcedures Act (\"APA\"), P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23 § 336(l)(3); must\nsubmit various reports to the governor of Puerto Rico and the\nlegislature, id. § 345; Pastrana-Torres, 460 F.3d at 127 (noting\nthat mandatory compliance with the APA and mandatory submission of\nreports to the Puerto Rico governor and legislature indicate\nCommonwealth control); must maintain its funds in Commonwealth-\napproved depositories, P.R.

Laws Ann. tit. 23 § 350. Moreover, PRPA\ncontends that the fact that the Commonwealth \"has chosen to share\nits eminent [] domain authority with the PRPA, in a scheme that\ndirectly involves the Governor and other members of the Executive\nBranch,\" is also suggestive of Commonwealth control. P.R. Laws\nAnn. tit. 23 §§ 339-339a.\n\n\n                              - 38 -\n\f                                        E.\n\n           Summing up, the control indicator favors finding PRPA to\n\nbe an arm of the Commonwealth while the other structural indicators\n\nof    PRPA's   status   either     point     affirmatively     against    that\n\nconclusion (in the case of how Puerto Rico law characterizes PRPA\n\nand in the case of the fiscal relationship between PRPA and the\n\nCommonwealth) or are neutral (in the case of an overall assessment\n\nof PRPA's functions).       Because the structural indicators of PRPA's\n\nstatus do not show that the Commonwealth \"clearly structured [PRPA]\n\nto share its sovereignty,\" Fresenius, 322 F.3d at 68, we must\n\nproceed to the second step of the analysis that Fresenius requires\n\nus to undertake, id. at 68, 72.\n\n           Here, the picture is quite clear.            PRPA has failed to\n\nshow that this action poses any risk to the Commonwealth's fisc.\n\nPRPA does not contend, and we see no basis for concluding, that\n\nthe Commonwealth would, as a legal matter, be liable for a judgment\n\nagainst PRPA in this case.         See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23 § 333(b).\n\nIn addition, the Commonwealth did not structure PRPA so that the\n\nCommonwealth would be liable, as a practical matter, for any such\n\nadverse judgment.\n\n           In this regard, we note that the Commonwealth designed\n\nPRPA to raise enough revenue to shoulder its own costs, including\n\nits   litigation   costs,    and   to    bear   its   own   debts,   including\n\n\n\n\n                                    - 39 -\n\f(generally) any judgments against it.23              Moreover, PRPA has done\n\nnothing to meet its burden to show that the Commonwealth's limited\n\nexposure in other courts under the Dock and Harbor Act renders any\n\njudgment in this action one that, in practical effect, likely would\n\nbe paid out of the Commonwealth's fisc.               Compare Fresenius, 322\n\nF.3d at 72-75 (finding insufficient case-specific risk to the\n\npublic        fisc   even     though    the     Commonwealth       had   provided\n\napproximately 26% of the entity's revenue in recent years), with\n\nIrizarry-Mora, 647 F.3d at 16-17 (finding sufficient case-specific\n\nrisk     to    the   public   fisc     in   part   because   the    Commonwealth\n\ncontributed at least 60% of the entity's funding).\n\n               Thus, the second step of the Fresenius analysis does not\n\nshow PRPA to be entitled to claim the Commonwealth's immunity.\n\nAnd so, given the mixed signals sent by the structural indicators\n\nof PRPA's status at the first step of the Fresenius analysis, we\n\nconclude that PRPA has not met its burden to show that it is an\n\narm of the Commonwealth entitled to immunity from this suit.                 See\n\nFresenius, 322 F.3d at 68 (\"[W]here the evidence is that the state\n\ndid not structure the entity to put the state treasury at risk of\n\n\n\n       23\n        PRPA does not contend -- by virtue of P.R.

PRPA\n\nrelies on language in the Supreme Court's decision in Federal\n\nMaritime Commission v. South Carolina Ports Authority (\"SCPA\"),\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118511\"><a href=\"/opinion/118511/federal-maritime-commn-v-south-carolina-ports-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">743</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002).\n\n          That case did not involve a dispute over whether the\n\nport authority there at issue was an arm of the state.   That case\n\ninvolved a dispute over whether the sovereign immunity that the\n\nEleventh Amendment presupposes protects sovereigns from appearing\n\nin federal administrative proceedings.\n\n          PRPA relies on the following statement that the Court\n\nmade in resolving that distinct question:\n\n     While state sovereign immunity serves the important\n     function of shielding state treasuries and thus\n     preserving the States' ability to govern in accordance\n     with the will of their citizens, the doctrine's central\n     purpose is to accord the States the respect owed them as\n     joint sovereigns.\n\nId. at 765 (quotation marks and citations omitted).   PRPA contends\n\nthat this same logic supports its position here.   PRPA argues that\n\njust as a sovereign may assert immunity from federal administrative\n\nproceedings even though those proceedings pose no obvious threat\n\nto the sovereign's fisc, PRPA should not be barred from asserting\n\n\n\n                              - 41 -\n\fthe Commonwealth's immunity in this case simply because this suit\n\nposes no risk to the Commonwealth's fisc.                       But PRPA appears to\n\nmisapprehend         the   reason      that    it   may   not      claim    arm-of-the-\n\nCommonwealth status.\n\n              The fact that this suit poses no fiscal risk to the\n\nCommonwealth dooms PRPA's claim to immunity only because -- as our\n\nanalysis of the structural indicators reveals -- the Commonwealth\n\nhas sent mixed signals about PRPA's status.                   By declining to read\n\nthose mixed signals to express the Commonwealth's intent to make\n\nPRPA an \"arm,\" we do not give short shrift to the Commonwealth's\n\ndignity.      Rather, in exercising such caution, see Fresenius, 322\n\nF.3d    at   63   (\"[W]here       an     entity     claims    to    share    a   state's\n\nsovereignty and the state has not clearly demarcated the entity as\n\nsharing its sovereignty, there is great reason for caution.\"), we\n\nsimply      ensure    that   we     do   not    wrongly      confer    immunity     that\n\nultimately belongs to the Commonwealth on an entity that the\n\nCommonwealth did not intend to benefit in that way, see id.
