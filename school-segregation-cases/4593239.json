Box 12788. Capitol System                      Grants\nAustin, Texas 78711\n\nDear Mr.   Fowler:\n\n       On behalf of the Coordinating Board, you have asked our opinion\nas to the constitutionality of Tuition Equalization Grants (Article 2654h,\nVernon’s Texas Civil Statutes) in light of the decisions on June 25. 1973.\nby the United States Supreme Court-of the cases of Committee for.Public\nEducation and Religious Liberty v. Nyquist (hereafter referred to merely\nas Nyquist); Sloan v. Lemon (hereafter Sloan); Levitt v. Committee for\nPublic Education & Religious Liberty (hxter         Levitt); and Hunt v.McNair\n(hereafter Hunt).\n\n       On May 24, 1973, at the request of the Senates Committee on Finance,\nwe issued our Letter Advisory No. 47 with reference to then proposed\nappropriations for the Tuition Equalization Grants.     In that letter we noted\nthe three tests applied by the United States Supreme Court in judging the\nconstitutionality of programs designed to aid private education: (1) Does\nthe legislation have a “secular legislative purpose;” (2) Does its primary\neffect ,either advance or inhibit religion; and (3) Does it foster an excessive\ngovernmental entanglement with religion.\n\n       We expressed the opinion in that letter advisory that Article @54h,\nV. T. C. S., was not “on its face” unconstitutional under the Constitution\nof the United States or of Texas, the latter being the more stringent of the\ntW0.   Our letter concluded:\n\n                  “We are of the opinion that Article 265411, and\n            the appropriation of funds for that program, reflect\n\n\n\n\n                                  p. ,282\n\fHonorable Ray A. Fowler,    page 2 (H-66)\n\n\n\n\n            a proper secular legislative purpose and are\n            constitutional, so long as the Coordinating, Board\n            under its regulations , administers. the program\n            so as to avoid the advancement or inhibition of\n            religion and so as to avoid the use of public funds\n            or property for the benefit of sects, religious\n            eocieties, or theorlogical or religious seminaries,\n            in turn avoiding ‘excessive entanglements. ’ ‘I\n\nWe urged caution because of the cases before the U. S. Supreme Court\nwhich were later decided on June 25, 1973. A review of them follows.\n\n       Nyquist involved three programs adopted in New York to aid private\neducation. One provided direct grants to non-public schools for the main-\nt&ance of school facilities “to ensure thehealth, welfare and safety of en-\nrolled pupils. I1 The sewnd provided for tuition reimbursement to parents\nof children attending nonpublic schools, although there was no limitation\non the use of the funds. The third program provided tax relief to those who\nfailed to qualify for tuition reimbursement.\n\n      The trial court in Nyquist had relied on statistics from the Levitt\ncase which showed that qualifying institutions under all three segments    of\nthe New York plan “could be” ones which imposed religious restrictions on\nadmission, required attendance at religioue services,     required obedience\nto the doctrines and dogmas of a particular faith, required students to attend\ninstruction in the theology or doctrine of a particular faith, were an integral\npart of the religious iniesion of the church sponsoring it, had as a purpose\nthe inculcation of religious values, imposed religious restrictions of faculty\nappointments, and imposed religious restrictions on what or how the faculty\nmay teach.\n\n        Eighty-five per cent of the qualify%ng schools were church affiliated.\nThe majority opinion of the Supreme Court by Mr. Justice Powell applied\n&e same three-part test to which we referred in our Letter Advisory No.\n47. As to all three segments of the program it found a proper secular\npurpose.    But, when it applied the “effects” test, the program failed. With\nreference to the “maintenance and repair funds, ‘I interestingly, the opinion\nstates:\n\n\n\n\n                                 p. 283\n\fHonorable Ray A. Fowler,    page 3 (H-66)\n\n                   “No attempt is made to restrict payments to\n            those expenditures related to the upkeep of facilities\n            used exclusively for secular purposes, nor do we\n            think it possible within the context of these religion-\n            oriented institutions to impose such restrictions.   . . .\n            Absent appropriate restrictions on expenditures for\n            these and similar purposes, it simply cannot be denied\n            that this section has a primary effect that advances\n            religion in that it subsidizes directly the religious acti-\n            vitiee of sectarian elementary and secondary schools. ”\n\n      Diotinguishing Everson v. Board of Education, 330 U. S. 1,(1947);\nBoard of Education v. Allen, 392 U. S. 236 (1968); and Tilton v. Richard-\n=,   403 U.S. ‘672, the Court said:\n\n                   “These cases simply recognize ,that sectarian\n            schools perform secular, educative functions as well\n            as religious functions, and that some forms of aid\n            may be channelled to the secular without providing\n            direct aid to the sectarian.  But the channel is a nar-\n            row one, as the above cases illustrate. . . . [~ln\n            indirect and incidental effect beneficial to religious\n            institutions has never been thought a sufficient defect\n            to warrant the invalidation of a state law. ”\n\n      Turning to the tuition reimbursement segment of the New York law,\nthe Court held that it, dso, failed the “effect” test, even though the pay-\nments w.eie made directly to ,parente without’limit&tionas to theirs use.\n\n                    “There can be no question that these grants\n             could not, conristently with the Establishment\n             Clause, be given directly to sectarian schools,\n             since they would suffer from the same deficiency\n             that renders invalid the grants for maintenance and\n             repair. In the absence of an effective means of\n             guaranteeing that the state aid derived from public\n             funds will be used exclusively for secular, neutral,\n             and non-ideological purposes, it is clear from our\n             cases that direct aid in whatever form is’invalid\n           . . . . . ‘I (emphasis added)\n\n\n\n\n                                   p. 284\n\fHonorable Ray A. Fowier.    page 4 (H-66)\n\n\n\n\n       Finally the Court found little difference, in effect, between the\ntuition reimbursement and the tax benefit. All segments were held\nunconstitutitonal because of their effect of advancing religion.\n\n       Sloan v. Lemon inumlved reimbursement of parents for expenses\nincurred in sending their children to nonpublic schools, but without any\nlimitation on the uses to which the funds could be put~by the parents. The\nSupreme Court majority opinion by Justice Powell acknowledged the real-\nity and legitimacy of the legislative purpose, but the court could find no\nvalid basis to distinguish these grants from those held unconstitutional\nin Nyquist, and held them to be unconstitutional.\n\n       Levitt involved another New York statute providing for the reim-\nbur,sement of nonpublic schools for expenses incurred by them in admin-\nistering, grading and reporting tests required by State law. The Supreme\nCourt noted that there was no provision for an audit to determine actual\ncosts.   Nor did the Act require the return of excess funds. The Supreme\nCourt held that the statute there contained constitutional flaws like some\nwhich led to the decision in Nyquist. All three, Nyquist, ~- Sloan, and\nLevitt were decided at the “effect” level; the “entanglements” level was\nnot reached.\n\n      Hunt was the only one of the cases dealing with an institution of\nhigherxcation     and the only one upholding aid. The statute involved,\nthe South Carolina Educational Facilities Act [S. C. Code. Ann. § $ 22-41\net seq. (Cum. Supp. 1971)], established an Authority for assisting insti-\ntutions of higher education in the construction snd financing of projects\nthrough issuance of revenue bonds. Projects were to encompass buildings\nand related items but, expressly, would not be used for sectarian activi-\nties, etc. State funds were -not involved.\n\n       The Supreme Court held: A. “The purpose of the statute is mani-\nfestly a secular one. The benefits of the Act are available to all insti-\nttitions of higher education in South Carolina, whether or not having a\nreligious affiliation.”  B. ” . . . On the record in this case there is no\nbasis to conclude that the college’s operations are oriented significantly\ntowards sectarian rather than secular education. ” The “college” was\n\n\n\n\n                                 p. 285\n\fHonorable Ray A. Fowler,    page 5 (H-66)\n\n\n\n\nthe Baptist College at Charleston.   Its trustees’were elected by the South\nCarolina Baptist Convention. The Convention’s approval was required\nfor certain financial transactions, and only the Convention could amend\nits charter.   There were no religious requirements for faculty member-\nship or student admission.    About 60 per cent of its student body was\nBaptist - roughly equivalent to the percentage of Baptists in that area\nof South Carolina.\n\n       The opinion is particularly helpful in defining more explicitly the\nfederal test to be applied in determining whether a program “advances”\nreligion:\n\n                  11. . . [ T] he Court has not accepted the\n            recurrent argument that all aid is forbidden be-\n            cause aid to one aspect of an institution frees it\n            to spend its other resourcee on religious ends.\n\n                  “Aid normally may be thou@ to have a\n            primary effect of advancing religions when it\n            flows to an institution in which religion is so\n            pervasive that a substantial portion of its func-\n            tions are subsumed in the religious mission or\n            when it funds a specifically religious activity in\n            an otherwise secular setting. . . . I’\n\n      C. As to “excessive entanglement ” the opinion differentiates between\nelementary schools of “substantiated religious character” such as those in-\nvolved in the Lemon case; supra. and church-related colleges where, in\nthe words of Chief Justice Burger in Tilton. supra, “There is less likeli-\nhood. . . that religion will permeate the area of secular education. ‘I (403\nU.S. at 687).\n\n      Other language from Chief Justice Burger’s    opinion in\nc\\caful in assessing federal requirements.\n\n                   “The simplistic argument that every form of\n            financial aid to church-sponsored activity violate’s\n\n\n\n\n                                  p. 286\n\fHonorable Ray A.   Fowler,   page 6 (H-66)\n\n\n\n\n            the Religion Clauses was rejected long ago in\n            Bradfield v. Roberts, 175 U. S. 291, 44 L Ed 168,\n            20 S Ct 121 (1899).    There a federal construction\n            grant to a hospital operated by a religious order\n            was upheld.’ Here the Act is challenged on the\n            ground that its primary effect is to aid the reli-\n            giaus purposes of church-related colleges and\n            universities.    Construction grants surely aid\n            these institutions in the sense that the construc-\n            tion,of buildings will assist them to perform their\n            various functions.     Bus transportation. textbooks,\n            and tax exemptions all give aid in the sense that\n            religious bodies would otherwise have been forced\n            to find other sources from which to finance these\n            services.     Yet all of these forms of governmental\n            assistance have been upheld. . . . The crucial\n            question is not whether some benefit accrues to\n            a religious institution as a consequence of the ieg-\n            islative program, but whether its principal or pri-\n            mary effect advances religion. ‘I (403 U. S. at 679).\n\nThe legal concept expressed in our Letter Advisory of May 24 is consistent\nwith the latest opinions and no revision of it is required.    A copy of LA-47\nis attached and made a part hereof.     The opinions rendered by the Supreme\nCourt on June 25th have further illuminated the tests’tobe applied in deter-\nmining whether the federal Establishment Clause has been violated.        For\nthat reason we have quoted from them extensively.        Taking them into con-\nsideration, we reaffirm our opinion that Articlee54h       does not on its face\nviolate the Establishment Clause of the Constitution of the United States,\nor the Constitution of Texas.    It ~expresses a valid secular purpose and\ncommands the Coordinatiqg Board to promulgate regulations for its imple-\nmentation which.comport with the severe:rrlrictures of the Texas Constitution.\nWe cannot assume without evidence that the Coordinating Board has failed\nor will fnil to heed legislative commands.     We find no constitutional fault\nin the statutory concept.\n\n      Caution should be used in equating the Hunt case with the Texas Tuition\nEqualization Program because the Hunt (S0ut.h Carolina) program differed\n\n\n\n\n                                  p. 287\n\fHonorable Ray A. Fowler.    page 7 (H-66)\n\n\n\n\nsignificantly.  It was funded by revenue bond issues (not direct, recur-\nring appropiiations) and in that respect more nearly resembled the\nStudent Loan Program authorized by Article 3 § 5 50b and Sob-1 of the\nTexas Constitution and implemented by the Texas Education Code, $ 52.01,\net seq., avail,able to students attending3    accredited institution of higher\nlearning in the state, including those publicly owned and operated.     Even\nthat resemblance is very limited.\n\n       The Hunt program, moreover, like the Tilton case, concerned the\nconstruction     “neutral” buildings to be used for separated secular pur-\nposes.   Students and educational programs are not neuters.    Funds used\nby them cannot be so easily limited to secular or sectarian compartments.\nFailure to segregate them, however, will likely be fatal under the federal\n“effects” test; on the other hand, attempts to impose or regulate separa-\ntion may cause forbidden “entanglements. ‘I\n\n       Caution is advisable for another reason.   Article 1, § 7 of the Texas\nConstitution is more restrictive than the federal charter (with which Hunt\nwas concerned) and will not tolerate, in our opinion, any aid to sector\nsectarian schools.    Denominational schools are not necessarily sectarian\nin that sense, and some schools with sectarian programs may be able tq\neffectively separate their secular programs from the sectarian remain-\nder so. that the use of funds for the one does not have the effect of subsi-\ndizing or furthering the other. The dividing lines are delicate but must\nbe sharp19 drawn so that public funds~are not put to. sectarian uses.\n\n       In Church v. Bullock, 100 S. W. 1025 (Tex. Civ. App. , 1907. affirmed\n109 S. W. 115)~, the Court of Appeals approved the following statement as a\ncorrect appraisal of the constitutional provision (Article 7, $ 5) prohibiting\nthe appropriation. of money for the support of sectarian schools:\n\n                   “In vi’ew of the above decisions and consti-\n            tutional provisions, we conclude that the words\n            used. . . murt havd been intend&lby tirepwplawho\n            ratified them to provide against. the promtilgation\n            or teaching of the distinctive doctrines, creeds\n            or tenets of any particular Christian or other\n            religious sect in schools or inztitutions where\n            such instruction was to be paid for out of the pub-\n            lic fund, or aided by such funds or by public grants;\n\n\n                                   p. 288\n\fHonorable Ray A.

It is what is taught\n                 that is the determining factor. ” (emphasis added)\n\n            If and when the constitutionality of Article q654h is tested before\n     the courts, the determination of its federal validity will be based on the\n     three tests we-,have stated applied to the particular fact situation then\n     at bar, and its validity under the Texas Constitution will depend upon\n     facts showing an avoidance of aid to sects and noninterference with\n     religious rights of conscience.\n\n           Such determinations depend upon the characteristics    of those to\n     whom the grants are given, the institutions receiving them,and the uses\n     to which the funds are put by the institutions. If the Coordinating Board’s\n     regulations are not unconstitutionally permissive,   the program will, in\n     our opinion, survive.\n\n             Rules should be so framed that institutions having the character-\n      istics sttributed to the New York schools in Nyquist and in Levitt will not\n      be the beneficiary of Tuition Equalization Grants.   Individual recipients\n      should not include those, for instance, attending seminaries or divinity\n      schools, nor should tuition paid from public funds~for a student be in\n      anywise comingled with funds used to defray the cost, -expense or upkeep\n     .of sectarian programs or facilities.  Mere church sponsorship of an in-\n      stitution would not seem:b itself to be ground for disqualification, but\n      every possibility of a grant having more than an indirect or incidental\n      effect upon the advancement of religion must be eliminated.\n\n\n\n\n                                       p. 289\n\f.\n\n\n\n\n    Honorable Ray A. Fowler,    page 9 (H-66)\n\n\n\n\n           While the United States Supreme Court appears to find a distinction\n    between the usual parochial school in which religionis,    in itself, a reason\n    for being, and the usual church sponsored institution of higher education\n    in which religion plays no significant part in directing the curriculum\n    (perhaps creating a primae facia fact presumption that college programs\n    are not permeated by sectarianism),     the presumption of a distinction is a\n    rebuttable one. The.mere fact.that an institution is a college or university\n    does not call for different tests or rules.  A college having all the char-\n    acteristics of the secondary schools involved in Levitt would be subjected\n    by the U. S.

Box 12788. Capitol System                      Grants\nAustin, Texas 78711\n\nDear Mr.   Fowler:\n\n       On behalf of the Coordinating Board, you have asked our opinion\nas to the constitutionality of Tuition Equalization Grants (Article 2654h,\nVernon’s Texas Civil Statutes) in light of the decisions on June 25. 1973.\nby the United States Supreme Court-of the cases of Committee for.Public\nEducation and Religious Liberty v. Nyquist (hereafter referred to merely\nas Nyquist); Sloan v. Lemon (hereafter Sloan); Levitt v. Committee for\nPublic Education & Religious Liberty (hxter         Levitt); and Hunt v.McNair\n(hereafter Hunt).\n\n       On May 24, 1973, at the request of the Senates Committee on Finance,\nwe issued our Letter Advisory No. 47 with reference to then proposed\nappropriations for the Tuition Equalization Grants.     In that letter we noted\nthe three tests applied by the United States Supreme Court in judging the\nconstitutionality of programs designed to aid private education: (1) Does\nthe legislation have a “secular legislative purpose;” (2) Does its primary\neffect ,either advance or inhibit religion; and (3) Does it foster an excessive\ngovernmental entanglement with religion.\n\n       We expressed the opinion in that letter advisory that Article @54h,\nV. T. C. S., was not “on its face” unconstitutional under the Constitution\nof the United States or of Texas, the latter being the more stringent of the\ntW0.   Our letter concluded:\n\n                  “We are of the opinion that Article 265411, and\n            the appropriation of funds for that program, reflect\n\n\n\n\n                                  p. ,282\n\fHonorable Ray A.

S. Supreme Court\nwhich were later decided on June 25, 1973. A review of them follows.\n\n       Nyquist involved three programs adopted in New York to aid private\neducation. One provided direct grants to non-public schools for the main-\nt&ance of school facilities “to ensure thehealth, welfare and safety of en-\nrolled pupils. I1 The sewnd provided for tuition reimbursement to parents\nof children attending nonpublic schools, although there was no limitation\non the use of the funds. The third program provided tax relief to those who\nfailed to qualify for tuition reimbursement.\n\n      The trial court in Nyquist had relied on statistics from the Levitt\ncase which showed that qualifying institutions under all three segments    of\nthe New York plan “could be” ones which imposed religious restrictions on\nadmission, required attendance at religioue services,     required obedience\nto the doctrines and dogmas of a particular faith, required students to attend\ninstruction in the theology or doctrine of a particular faith, were an integral\npart of the religious iniesion of the church sponsoring it, had as a purpose\nthe inculcation of religious values, imposed religious restrictions of faculty\nappointments, and imposed religious restrictions on what or how the faculty\nmay teach.\n\n        Eighty-five per cent of the qualify%ng schools were church affiliated.\nThe majority opinion of the Supreme Court by Mr. Justice Powell applied\n&e same three-part test to which we referred in our Letter Advisory No.\n47. As to all three segments of the program it found a proper secular\npurpose.    But, when it applied the “effects” test, the program failed. With\nreference to the “maintenance and repair funds, ‘I interestingly, the opinion\nstates:\n\n\n\n\n                                 p. 283\n\fHonorable Ray A. Fowler,    page 3 (H-66)\n\n                   “No attempt is made to restrict payments to\n            those expenditures related to the upkeep of facilities\n            used exclusively for secular purposes, nor do we\n            think it possible within the context of these religion-\n            oriented institutions to impose such restrictions.   . . .\n            Absent appropriate restrictions on expenditures for\n            these and similar purposes, it simply cannot be denied\n            that this section has a primary effect that advances\n            religion in that it subsidizes directly the religious acti-\n            vitiee of sectarian elementary and secondary schools. ”\n\n      Diotinguishing Everson v.

Richard-\n=,   403 U.S. ‘672, the Court said:\n\n                   “These cases simply recognize ,that sectarian\n            schools perform secular, educative functions as well\n            as religious functions, and that some forms of aid\n            may be channelled to the secular without providing\n            direct aid to the sectarian.  But the channel is a nar-\n            row one, as the above cases illustrate. . . . [~ln\n            indirect and incidental effect beneficial to religious\n            institutions has never been thought a sufficient defect\n            to warrant the invalidation of a state law. ”\n\n      Turning to the tuition reimbursement segment of the New York law,\nthe Court held that it, dso, failed the “effect” test, even though the pay-\nments w.eie made directly to ,parente without’limit&tionas to theirs use.\n\n                    “There can be no question that these grants\n             could not, conristently with the Establishment\n             Clause, be given directly to sectarian schools,\n             since they would suffer from the same deficiency\n             that renders invalid the grants for maintenance and\n             repair. In the absence of an effective means of\n             guaranteeing that the state aid derived from public\n             funds will be used exclusively for secular, neutral,\n             and non-ideological purposes, it is clear from our\n             cases that direct aid in whatever form is’invalid\n           . . . . . ‘I (emphasis added)\n\n\n\n\n                                   p. 284\n\fHonorable Ray A. Fowier.    page 4 (H-66)\n\n\n\n\n       Finally the Court found little difference, in effect, between the\ntuition reimbursement and the tax benefit. All segments were held\nunconstitutitonal because of their effect of advancing religion.\n\n       Sloan v. Lemon inumlved reimbursement of parents for expenses\nincurred in sending their children to nonpublic schools, but without any\nlimitation on the uses to which the funds could be put~by the parents. The\nSupreme Court majority opinion by Justice Powell acknowledged the real-\nity and legitimacy of the legislative purpose, but the court could find no\nvalid basis to distinguish these grants from those held unconstitutional\nin Nyquist, and held them to be unconstitutional.\n\n       Levitt involved another New York statute providing for the reim-\nbur,sement of nonpublic schools for expenses incurred by them in admin-\nistering, grading and reporting tests required by State law. The Supreme\nCourt noted that there was no provision for an audit to determine actual\ncosts.   Nor did the Act require the return of excess funds. The Supreme\nCourt held that the statute there contained constitutional flaws like some\nwhich led to the decision in Nyquist. All three, Nyquist, ~- Sloan, and\nLevitt were decided at the “effect” level; the “entanglements” level was\nnot reached.\n\n      Hunt was the only one of the cases dealing with an institution of\nhigherxcation     and the only one upholding aid. The statute involved,\nthe South Carolina Educational Facilities Act [S. C. Code. Ann. § $ 22-41\net seq. (Cum. Supp. 1971)], established an Authority for assisting insti-\ntutions of higher education in the construction snd financing of projects\nthrough issuance of revenue bonds. Projects were to encompass buildings\nand related items but, expressly, would not be used for sectarian activi-\nties, etc. State funds were -not involved.\n\n       The Supreme Court held: A. “The purpose of the statute is mani-\nfestly a secular one. The benefits of the Act are available to all insti-\nttitions of higher education in South Carolina, whether or not having a\nreligious affiliation.”  B. ” . . . On the record in this case there is no\nbasis to conclude that the college’s operations are oriented significantly\ntowards sectarian rather than secular education. ” The “college” was\n\n\n\n\n                                 p. 285\n\fHonorable Ray A. Fowler,    page 5 (H-66)\n\n\n\n\nthe Baptist College at Charleston.   Its trustees’were elected by the South\nCarolina Baptist Convention. The Convention’s approval was required\nfor certain financial transactions, and only the Convention could amend\nits charter.   There were no religious requirements for faculty member-\nship or student admission.    About 60 per cent of its student body was\nBaptist - roughly equivalent to the percentage of Baptists in that area\nof South Carolina.\n\n       The opinion is particularly helpful in defining more explicitly the\nfederal test to be applied in determining whether a program “advances”\nreligion:\n\n                  11. . . [ T] he Court has not accepted the\n            recurrent argument that all aid is forbidden be-\n            cause aid to one aspect of an institution frees it\n            to spend its other resourcee on religious ends.\n\n                  “Aid normally may be thou@ to have a\n            primary effect of advancing religions when it\n            flows to an institution in which religion is so\n            pervasive that a substantial portion of its func-\n            tions are subsumed in the religious mission or\n            when it funds a specifically religious activity in\n            an otherwise secular setting. . . .

There a federal construction\n            grant to a hospital operated by a religious order\n            was upheld.’ Here the Act is challenged on the\n            ground that its primary effect is to aid the reli-\n            giaus purposes of church-related colleges and\n            universities.    Construction grants surely aid\n            these institutions in the sense that the construc-\n            tion,of buildings will assist them to perform their\n            various functions.     Bus transportation. textbooks,\n            and tax exemptions all give aid in the sense that\n            religious bodies would otherwise have been forced\n            to find other sources from which to finance these\n            services.     Yet all of these forms of governmental\n            assistance have been upheld. . . . The crucial\n            question is not whether some benefit accrues to\n            a religious institution as a consequence of the ieg-\n            islative program, but whether its principal or pri-\n            mary effect advances religion. ‘I (403 U. S. at 679).\n\nThe legal concept expressed in our Letter Advisory of May 24 is consistent\nwith the latest opinions and no revision of it is required.    A copy of LA-47\nis attached and made a part hereof.     The opinions rendered by the Supreme\nCourt on June 25th have further illuminated the tests’tobe applied in deter-\nmining whether the federal Establishment Clause has been violated.        For\nthat reason we have quoted from them extensively.        Taking them into con-\nsideration, we reaffirm our opinion that Articlee54h       does not on its face\nviolate the Establishment Clause of the Constitution of the United States,\nor the Constitution of Texas.    It ~expresses a valid secular purpose and\ncommands the Coordinatiqg Board to promulgate regulations for its imple-\nmentation which.comport with the severe:rrlrictures of the Texas Constitution.\nWe cannot assume without evidence that the Coordinating Board has failed\nor will fnil to heed legislative commands.     We find no constitutional fault\nin the statutory concept.\n\n      Caution should be used in equating the Hunt case with the Texas Tuition\nEqualization Program because the Hunt (S0ut.h Carolina) program differed\n\n\n\n\n                                  p. 287\n\fHonorable Ray A.

It was funded by revenue bond issues (not direct, recur-\nring appropiiations) and in that respect more nearly resembled the\nStudent Loan Program authorized by Article 3 § 5 50b and Sob-1 of the\nTexas Constitution and implemented by the Texas Education Code, $ 52.01,\net seq., avail,able to students attending3    accredited institution of higher\nlearning in the state, including those publicly owned and operated.     Even\nthat resemblance is very limited.\n\n       The Hunt program, moreover, like the Tilton case, concerned the\nconstruction     “neutral” buildings to be used for separated secular pur-\nposes.   Students and educational programs are not neuters.    Funds used\nby them cannot be so easily limited to secular or sectarian compartments.\nFailure to segregate them, however, will likely be fatal under the federal\n“effects” test; on the other hand, attempts to impose or regulate separa-\ntion may cause forbidden “entanglements. ‘I\n\n       Caution is advisable for another reason.   Article 1, § 7 of the Texas\nConstitution is more restrictive than the federal charter (with which Hunt\nwas concerned) and will not tolerate, in our opinion, any aid to sector\nsectarian schools.    Denominational schools are not necessarily sectarian\nin that sense, and some schools with sectarian programs may be able tq\neffectively separate their secular programs from the sectarian remain-\nder so. that the use of funds for the one does not have the effect of subsi-\ndizing or furthering the other.

If the Coordinating Board’s\n     regulations are not unconstitutionally permissive,   the program will, in\n     our opinion, survive.\n\n             Rules should be so framed that institutions having the character-\n      istics sttributed to the New York schools in Nyquist and in Levitt will not\n      be the beneficiary of Tuition Equalization Grants.

Mere church sponsorship of an in-\n      stitution would not seem:b itself to be ground for disqualification, but\n      every possibility of a grant having more than an indirect or incidental\n      effect upon the advancement of religion must be eliminated.\n\n\n\n\n                                       p. 289\n\f.\n\n\n\n\n    Honorable Ray A.
