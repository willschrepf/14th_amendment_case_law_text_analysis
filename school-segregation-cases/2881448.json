Civ. No. 04-cv-05474)\n                       District Judge: Honorable Joseph E. Irenas\n                            __________________________\n\n                       Submitted Under Third Circuit LAR 34.1(a)\n                                   January 6, 2006\n\n        Before: SLOVITER, SMITH AND VAN ANTWERPEN, Circuit Judges\n\n                                (Filed: January 10, 2006)\n\n\n                                         OPINION\n\n\nPER CURIAM\n\n       Appellant Jose Acosta, a federal prisoner, appeals the judgment of the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of New Jersey denying his 28 U.S.C. § 2241 petition.\n\nFor the reasons that follow, we will affirm the District Court’s judgment.\n\n       As noted by the District Court, Acosta was charged with a violation of the Bureau\n\nof Prison’s (“BOP”) disciplinary code, i.e., fighting (Code # 210), in an incident report\n\fissued on April 15, 2004. Reporting staff indicated that, based on a statement by a\n\nwitness and injuries sustained by appellant, Acosta was involved in a fight with another\n\ninmate on March 28, 2004. Acosta was given a copy of the incident report, advised of his\n\nrights and provided an opportunity to make a statement. After reviewing the incident\n\nreport, Acosta’s medical records and photographs of the participants, the investigating\n\nofficer concluded that the charge was valid and forwarded the incident report to the Unit\n\nDisciplinary Committee. A Disciplinary Hearing Officer (“DHO”) thereafter held a\n\nhearing on April 28, 2004. Acosta was again advised of his rights and offered a staff\n\nrepresentative, which he refused. Although he offered no witnesses, Acosta did make a\n\nstatement whereby he denied being involved in a fight and alleged instead that he injured\n\nhimself while working in the unit. After considering the evidence presented, the DHO\n\nfound that Acosta had engaged in fighting as charged. A report detailing the DHO’s\n\nfindings was filed, and appellant was sanctioned twenty-seven (27) days disallowance of\n\ngood conduct time, sixty (60) days forfeiture of non-vested good conduct time and thirty\n\n(30) days of disciplinary segregation.\n\n       After exhausting his administrative remedies, Acosta filed a habeas petition in the\n\nDistrict Court alleging that his constitutional right to due process had been violated\n\nbecause he was denied the opportunity to investigate, and because the DHO’s finding was\n\nnot supported by sufficient evidence. Acosta also asserted that the DHO was not\n\npermitted to sanction him with both the disallowance of good conduct time and the\n\nforfeiture of non-vested good conduct time. The District Court found that Acosta’s\n\nconstitutional rights had not been violated and entered an order denying his § 2241\n\n                                              2\n\fpetition. Acosta timely appealed.\n\n       We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We review de novo the\n\nDistrict Court’s denial of habeas corpus relief and its interpretation of the applicable\n\nstatutes. Gerbier v. Holmes, 280 F.3d 297, 302 (3d Cir. 2002). At a prison disciplinary\n\nhearing, due process requires that the inmate: (i) appear before an impartial decision-\n\nmaking body; (ii) be given at least 24 hours’ written notice of the charges; (iii) be\n\nafforded an opportunity to call witnesses and present documentary evidence; (iv) be\n\npermitted assistance from an inmate representative; and (v) receive a written decision\n\nexplaining the decision-maker’s conclusions. See Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539,\n\n563-71 (1974). The decision-maker’s conclusions must be supported by at least “some\n\nevidence.” Superintendent, Mass. Corr. Inst. v. Hill, 472 U.S. 445, 454-56 (1985). In\n\nHill, the Supreme Court explained:\n\n       Ascertaining whether this standard is satisfied does not require examination\n       of the entire record, independent assessment of the credibility of witnesses,\n       or weighing of the evidence. Instead, the relevant question is whether there\n       is any evidence in the record that could support the conclusion reached by\n       the disciplinary board.\n\nId. at 455.\n\n       We agree with the District Court, for the reasons stated in its order dismissing\n\nAcosta’s § 2241 petition, that appellant was afforded all the process he was due. We also\n\nagree with the District Court that the evidence is sufficient to support the DHO’s finding\n\nthat Acosta was guilty as charged. The evidence included the following: the report of the\n\ninvestigating officer; the medical injuries sustained by Acosta and photos taken by staff\n\ndepicting those injuries; a medical report of the inmate with whom Acosta was fighting; a\n\n                                              3\n\fmemo submitted by a second officer documenting an interview with another inmate; and\n\ninformation from a confidential informant describing the altercation. In addition, the\n\nDHO considered the incredibility of Acosta’s statement and the lack of evidence he\n\noffered, and concluded that the greater weight of the evidence supported the charge. See\n\nDistrict Court’s Memorandum Opinion at 7.1 The evidence being sufficient to support the\n\nDHO’s finding, our inquiry ends. Contrary to appellant’s contention, the court is not\n\nrequired to conduct an independent “in depth” examination of the evidence in order to\n\nensure that it would have issued the same findings if it were sitting as the trier of fact and\n\nwould have accorded each piece of evidence the same weight as that of the hearing\n\nofficer. We further reject Acosta’s argument that the evidence relied upon by the DHO\n\ncannot satisfy the “some evidence” standard simply because a fellow inmate later\n\nprovided an “exculpatory” statement which he asserts “exonerated” him.2\n\n       Acosta also argues that the DHO was only permitted to sanction him with either 60\n\ndays of forfeiture of non-vested good conduct time or 27 days of disallowance of good\n\nconduct time, and he criticizes both the District Court and appellee for failing to address\n\nthis issue with an extensive discussion. According to appellant, the DHO was using the\n\n\n\n       1\n        Title 28 C.F.R. § 541.17(f) provides that “[t]he decision of the DHO shall be\nbased on at least some facts, and if there is conflicting evidence, it must be based on the\ngreater weight of the evidence.” We need not consider whether or how this standard\nmight be different from the one required by Hill, as it is apparent that the evidence against\nAcosta was sufficient under either standard.\n       2\n        Acosta states that this “exculpatory” statement was provided by inmate Arias, an\ninmate who appellant claims was a “clear party” to the dispute, see Memorandum in\nSupport of Petition at 2, but who himself apparently denied that he (Arias) had any\ninvolvement in the fight. Id. at 3.\n\n                                              4\n\fwrong list of penalties when he imposed sanctions on Acosta. However, our independent\n\nreview of the relevant regulatory provision and applicable table indicates that it is Acosta\n\nwho is mistaken as all three of the sanctions he received are permissible for a Code 201\n\nviolation (a “High Category” offense), and Acosta offers no legal support for any other\n\nconclusion. See 28 C.F.R. § 541.13, Table 13; BOP Program Statement 5270.07.\n\n       Acosta’s final two contentions can be disposed of with very little discussion.\n\nAcosta faults the District Court for entering a final order prior to giving him an\n\nopportunity to file a traverse to appellee’s response to his § 2241 petition. Appellant’s\n\nmotion requesting an extension of time to file such a document, however, was not\n\nreceived until after the District Court entered its order dismissing the § 2241 petition, and\n\nAcosta has failed to demonstrate that the District Court committed reversible error in\n\nproceeding as it did. Finally, Acosta claims that the Clerk of this Court erred in assessing\n\na filing fee against him for the instant appeal. He requests that such fee be remitted to\n\nhim. Once again, however, it appears that Acosta is mistaken. A review of the\n\ncomputerized docketing system for both this Court and the District Court reveals that\n\nAcosta was granted in forma pauperis status by the District Court, and that such status\n\ncarried over on appeal to waive any appellate filing or docketing fees. Thus, there were\n\nno fees paid.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the order denying Acosta’s habeas\n\npetition.\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f",

According to appellant, the DHO was using the\n\n\n\n       1\n        Title 28 C.F.R. § 541.17(f) provides that “[t]he decision of the DHO shall be\nbased on at least some facts, and if there is conflicting evidence, it must be based on the\ngreater weight of the evidence.” We need not consider whether or how this standard\nmight be different from the one required by Hill, as it is apparent that the evidence against\nAcosta was sufficient under either standard.\n       2\n        Acosta states that this “exculpatory” statement was provided by inmate Arias, an\ninmate who appellant claims was a “clear party” to the dispute, see Memorandum in\nSupport of Petition at 2, but who himself apparently denied that he (Arias) had any\ninvolvement in the fight. Id. at 3.\n\n                                              4\n\fwrong list of penalties when he imposed sanctions on Acosta. However, our independent\n\nreview of the relevant regulatory provision and applicable table indicates that it is Acosta\n\nwho is mistaken as all three of the sanctions he received are permissible for a Code 201\n\nviolation (a “High Category” offense), and Acosta offers no legal support for any other\n\nconclusion. See 28 C.F.R. § 541.13, Table 13; BOP Program Statement 5270.07.\n\n       Acosta’s final two contentions can be disposed of with very little discussion.\n\nAcosta faults the District Court for entering a final order prior to giving him an\n\nopportunity to file a traverse to appellee’s response to his § 2241 petition. Appellant’s\n\nmotion requesting an extension of time to file such a document, however, was not\n\nreceived until after the District Court entered its order dismissing the § 2241 petition, and\n\nAcosta has failed to demonstrate that the District Court committed reversible error in\n\nproceeding as it did. Finally, Acosta claims that the Clerk of this Court erred in assessing\n\na filing fee against him for the instant appeal. He requests that such fee be remitted to\n\nhim. Once again, however, it appears that Acosta is mistaken. A review of the\n\ncomputerized docketing system for both this Court and the District Court reveals that\n\nAcosta was granted in forma pauperis status by the District Court, and that such status\n\ncarried over on appeal to waive any appellate filing or docketing fees. Thus, there were\n\nno fees paid.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the order denying Acosta’s habeas\n\npetition.\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f</pre>",
