The background of the underlying\ncontroversy is complex, involving the relationship of several foreign corporations and\ntheir subsidiaries, allegations of fraudulent transfers of millions of dollars, and one of the\nlargest corporate bankruptcies in Italian history. The issues in this appeal, however, are\nrelatively straightforward. Each the three defendants appeals a discovery order that\nimposed monetary sanctions in the amount of $5,460. After determining that the orders\nare appealable, we conclude the trial court acted well within its discretion in imposing\nmonetary sanctions, and affirm.\n\n\n                  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n\n       A.     The Allegations in the Complaint\n       This action is one of a series of lawsuits in the United States and Italy, all arising\nout of the collapse of the financial empire of Vittorio Cecchi Gori, an Italian businessman\nand film producer. According to the allegations in the complaint in this action, Cecchi\nGori fraudulently transferred millions of dollars from the bankruptcy estate of his limited\nliability company, Fin.Ma. Vi S.p.A (Finmavi), in an effort to put assets out of the reach\nof creditors. Cecchi Gori was the sole shareholder, president, and chairman of the board\nof directors of Finmavi. “At its peak, [Finmavi] operated more than 40 companies in the\nbusiness of film production, distribution, exhibition, television multimedia, real estate,\nand professional soccer.”\n       Nous S.r.l. (Nous) is an Italian limited liability company in the real estate business\nthat Cecchi Gori used to own. Nous is now undergoing liquidation under the jurisdiction\nof the Court of Rome, which appointed Davide Franco and Sergio Torri as co-liquidators\nof Nous to satisfy the debts of Nous’s creditors. Nous owns 100 percent of a\nLuxembourg company called Promint Holdings S.A., which in turn owns 100 percent of\n\n                                              2\n\fa Dutch company called Cecchi Gori Group Europe B.V., which in turns owns 100\npercent of the two United States companies involved in this action, Cecchi Gori Pictures\nand Cecchi Gori USA, Inc. Based on these allegations, Nous claimed that it “is the\nultimate parent” of Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA.\n       Nous alleged that for many years Cecchi Gori “systematically transferred funds\nfrom one entity to another entity within his control for his own personal benefit and to the\ndetriment of creditors. For example, Cecchi Gori authorized [Finmavi] to finance multi-\nmillion dollar loans that were both interest-free and unsecured to other entities controlled\nby Cecchi Gori, hid assets from [Finmavi] and other entities within Cecchi Gori’s control\nfor his own personal benefit at the detriment of the company’s creditors and utilized\n[Finmavi’s] funds for his own personal expenses.” Nous alleged that Cecchi Gori\ntransferred over $8.5 million to Nous, over $2 million to Cecchi Gori Pictures, and over\n$45 million to Cecchi Gori USA.\n       Nous alleged that in 2005 Finmavi filed in the Ordinary Court of Rome the Italian\nequivalent of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition, with “more than $927 million in debt.”\nNous alleged that in October 2006 the Bankruptcy Division of the Ordinary Court of\nRome rejected Cecchi Gori’s proposed reorganization plan. The Court of Rome\nsubsequently confirmed Franco and Torri as co-liquidators of Nous. According to Nous,\nNous owed Finmavi almost $9 million, and Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA\ncollectively owed Finmavi “approximately $47 million as a result of funds Cecchi Gori\ncaused [Finmavi] to transfer to [these two] entities.”\n       In 2008 Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA became involved initially as\ndefendants in a lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court filed by a former officer of\nCecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA named Gianni Nunnari, which the parties\nrefer to as the Nunnari action. Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA filed and\nultimately prevailed on a cross-complaint in the Nunnari action, and in March 2011 they\nobtained a judgment in the amount of $13,786,465. In April 2011 the Ordinary Court of\nRome, 6th Criminal Division, “issued an order granting Nous recovery of” the\n$13,786,465 judgment Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA had obtained in the\n\n                                             3\n\fNunnari action. According to Nous, the Italian court, “[i]n order to prevent Cecchi Gori\nfrom obtaining, spending or removing the money from the legitimate expectation of\ncreditors,” issued an order stating that Nous is entitled to the proceeds of the Nunnari\njudgment. Nous refers to this order as the “Italian Judgment.”\n       Thus, Nous alleged that the $13,786,465 judgment Cecchi Gori Pictures and\nCecchi Gori USA obtained in the Nunnari action “is one of the assets controlled by Nous\nthat is subject to liquidation.” Noting that Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA\nwere attempting to collect on the Nunnari judgment, Nous alleged that Cecchi Gori was\nseeking to violate Italian court orders and judgments and “to engage in continued\nbankruptcy fraud to loot the assets of [Finmavi] and other entities he controls or\ncontrolled to put them beyond the reach of creditors.”    Nous sought a declaration that it\nis the “ultimate parent company” of Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA and is\nentitled to the proceeds of the $13,786,465 judgment in the Nunnari action, recognition of\nthe Italian Judgment under the Uniform Foreign-Country Money Judgments Recognition\nAct (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1713-1724), and the appointment of a receiver for Cecchi Gori\nPictures and Cecchi Gori USA.\n\n\n       B.     The Written Discovery\n       Nous propounded sets of written discovery to all three defendants, Cecchi Gori\nPictures, Cecchi Gori USA, and Vittorio Cecchi Gori: requests for production of\ndocuments, special interrogatories, form interrogatories, and requests for admission. The\nthree defendants responded primarily with objections.\n       The discovery served by Nous fell into several general categories (four according\nto Nous in the trial court, five according to Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA on\nappeal). The discovery requests generally sought documents and information relating to\nownership and control of Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA, recognition of the\nItalian Judgment, and enforcement of the Nunnari judgment. The discovery also sought\nfinancial and other documents and information about the relationship between Vittorio\nCecchi Gori and the two entities, Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA. Nous\n\n                                             4\n\frefers to this discovery as “facts related to the Finmavi bankruptcy that led to the\nappointment of [Franco] and [Torri] as liquidators of Nous charged with taking control of\n[Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA’s] assets.” The three defendants refer to this\ndiscovery as “any and all financial information related to [Cecchi Gori Pictures and\nCecchi Gori USA] and Vittorio Cecchi Gori.”\n       The defendants asserted various and numerous objections to Nous’s written\ndiscovery, including that the discovery was not relevant or reasonably calculated to lead\nto the discovery of admissible evidence, was overbroad, burdensome and oppressive,\ncalled for production of documents and information protected by the attorney-client\nprivilege and the work product doctrine, violated Cecchi Gori’s privacy rights, sought\ndocuments that were public records, and demanded information that was not discoverable\nunder Civil Code section 3295. The defendants also asserted that they had previously\nproduced the documents that Nous was seeking in discovery.\n       Nous moved to compel further responses to its written discovery, for production of\ndocuments, and for monetary sanctions under the discovery statutes. The defendants\nopposed the motions, arguing that they had produced all documents relating to the\nownership and control of Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA, which the\ndefendants claimed were the only relevant issues in the case, and that Nous was not\nentitled in this action to take discovery on any other issues.\n\n\n       C.      The Trial Court’s Orders\n       The trial court heard Nous’s discovery motions against Vittorio Cecchi Gori on\nJune 12, 2014, Nous’s discovery motions against Cecchi Gori Pictures on June 17, 2014,\nand Nous’s discovery motions against Cecchi Gori USA on June 19, 2014. The court\nissued minute orders, of 20, 21, and 5 pages, respectively, granting the motions to compel\nalmost in their entirety and imposing monetary sanctions against the responding party and\nhis or its attorneys.\n       In its June 12, 2014 order the court noted that Cecchi Gori’s “opposition fails to\naddress the motions regarding the [requests for production of documents], form\n\n                                              5\n\finterrogatories, and special interrogatories,” and “offers no specific arguments regarding\nwhy he should not be compelled to provide further responses to these requests.” The\ncourt also noted that Cecchi Gori “essentially failed to produce any responsive documents\nwhatsoever. While he indicated that he would produce all non-privileged documents\nwith regards to certain requests, he has not done so.” The court overruled Cecchi Gori’s\nobjections based on relevancy (because relevancy is not the standard for discovery),\nprivacy (finding, after “a careful balancing,” that Nous’s right to a fair trial outweighed\nCecchi Gori’s privacy interests), foreign prosecution (concluding the Fifth Amendment\ndid not apply to “potential foreign prosecution”), and other objections, and ordered\nCecchi Gori to provide a log of any privileged documents. On the issue of monetary\nsanctions, the trial court believed Cecchi Gori’s discovery responses were “totally\ninadequate and shocking” and that it was “a clear-cut issue.” The court stated: “The\ncourt finds that sanctions are appropriate under [Code of Civil Procedure sections]\n2030.300[, subdivision] (d), 2031.310[, subdivision] (h), and 2033.290[, subdivision] (d).\nThe imposition of sanctions would not be unjust given the refusal to produce documents\nor to supplement the responses to the form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and the\nrequests for admission. Defendant [Vittorio Cecchi] Gori and his counsel are ordered to\npay sanctions of $5,460 to Plaintiffs within 20 days.” Cecchi Gori filed a notice of\nappeal on June 16, 2014.\n       The court made similar rulings in its June 17, 2014 and June 19, 2014 orders with\nrespect to Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA. After explaining in detail the\ninadequacies of the responses to Form Interrogatory No. 17.1 with respect to Nous’s\nrequests for admission, the court overruled objections similar to those asserted by Cecchi\nGori. On the issue of monetary sanctions, the court found: “Sanctions are required\nagainst a party who unsuccessfully opposes a motion to compel further responses to\ninterrogatories, [requests for production of documents], and [requests for admissions],\nunless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial\njustification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.\n[Code Civ. Proc.,] §§ 2030.300, 2031.310, 2033.290. [¶] [Counsel for Nous] states that\n\n                                              6\n\fNous incurred $5,460 on these four motion[s] for 7 hours at $405 ($2,835) plus one hour\nat $605 ($605) on the motion, another 2 hours at $405 ($810) on reply, and another 2\nhours at $605 for the hearing ($1,210). . . . The court finds the sanctions request\nappropriate under the circumstances as a total for these four motions.” The court ordered\nCecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA each “to pay sanctions of $5,460 to plaintiffs’\ncounsel in 20 days.” Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA filed notices of appeal\non July 7, 2014.\n\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n\n       A.     The Orders Are Appealable\n       “The existence of an appealable judgment is a jurisdictional prerequisite to an\nappeal.” (Jennings v. Marralle (1994) 8 Cal.4th 121, 126; accord, Harrington-Wisely v.\nState (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 1488, 1494.) “‘Generally, no order or judgment in a civil\naction is appealable unless it is embraced within the list of appealable orders provided by\nstatute.’ [Citation.] With certain exceptions . . . appealable judgments and orders are\nlisted in Code of Civil Procedure section 904.1.” (Walker v. Los Angeles County\nMetropolitan Transp. Authority (2005) 35 Cal.4th 15, 19; see Montano v. The Wet Seal\nRetail, Inc. (2015) 232 Cal.App.4th 1214, 1225 [“[a] trial court order is appealable only\nwhen made so by statute”].)\n       Code of Civil Procedure section 904.1, subdivision (a)(12), states that “an order\ndirecting payment of monetary sanctions by a party or an attorney for a party” is\nappealable “if the amount exceeds” $5,000. (See Hopkins & Carley v. Gens (2011) 200\nCal.App.4th 1401, 1409, fn. 3 [order imposing $9,000 in monetary sanctions is\nappealable]; Ellerbee v. County of Los Angeles (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 1206, 1213 [“[a]n\norder directing the payment of monetary sanctions by a party or its attorney is\nimmediately appealable if the amount of sanctions exceeds $5,000”].) This rule applies\nto discovery sanctions orders. (See Tucker v. Pacific Bell Mobile Services (2010) 186\nCal.App.4th 1548, 1559 [order imposing $7,500 in monetary sanctions for deposition\n\n                                             7\n\fmisconduct was appealable]; Rail-Transport Employees Assn. v. Union Pacific Motor\nFreight (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 469, 475 [“cases involving misuse of the discovery\nprocess which result in sanctions exceeding $5,000 are reviewable by direct appeal”].)\nOrders imposing monetary sanctions of $5,000 or less are reviewable by writ petition or\non appeal after final judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 904.1, subd. (b); see Calhoun v.\nVallejo City Unified School Dist. (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 39, 44 (Calhoun) [review of\norders imposing monetary sanctions less than the statutory minimum may “‘“be upon the\ngranting of a petition for an extraordinary writ”’”].)\n       Each of the three orders in these appeals imposes monetary sanctions in excess of\n$5,000. Therefore, they are appealable.\n       Nous acknowledges that “[t]he sum total of the sanctions imposed on four separate\nmotions was $5,460.00 per defendant.” Nous argues, however, that the orders are not\nappealable because “the monetary sanctions cover four separate motions, which in turn\naddress four separate sets of discovery, and expressly notes that the authority for the\nmonetary sanctions flows from three distinct statutory provisions dealing with requests\nfor production, requests for admission, and interrogatories.” Nous asserts that, although\nthe figure “$1,365” does not appear in any of the three orders, the trial court effectively\nsanctioned each defendant “$1,365.00 on each of the four discovery motions.” Nous\ncontends that the three defendants are “attempt[ing] to improperly aggregate the\nsanctions related to four separate motions to meet the $5,000 statutory threshold for\nappealability under [Code of Civil Procedure section] 904.1[, subdivision] (a)(12).”\n       Contrary to Nous’s assertion, the defendants are not improperly aggregating\nseparate monetary sanctions awards of less than $5,000. To the contrary, it is Nous that\nis improperly disaggregating a monetary sanctions award of greater than $5,000 into\nseparate monetary sanctions awards of less than $5,000. As Vittorio Cecchi Gori points\nout, the order “imposes a single monetary sanction against [him] in the amount of\n$5,460.00,” does not “mention the amount of ‘$1,365,’” “nor in any way indicate[s] that\nthe $5,460 sanction award was to be divided or apportioned in any manner.” As Cecchi\nGori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA argue, “[b]ecause the sanctions award was a single\n\n                                              8\n\famount, payable to a single entity, the $5,4[60] figure (as to each [entity]) cannot be\ncharacterized as an aggregated amount.”\n       Discussing the attempted aggregation of two orders imposing monetary sanctions,\neach of which was below the then-statutory limit of $750, the court in Calhoun, supra, 20\nCal.App.4th 39 held: “We conclude that because of the Legislature’s intent to reduce the\nnumber of appeals from monetary sanction orders and the confusion that would result\nfrom a rule permitting aggregation, multiple sub-$750 sanctions may not be aggregated\nunder any circumstances to meet the appealability threshold of [former] section 904.1,\nsubdivision (k). We endorse a bright line rule that a sanction order is nonappealable if it\ndoes not impose any sanction exceeding $750, and thus an order requiring payment of\nmultiple sanctions, none of which exceed[s] $750, is nonappealable even if the total\naggregated sanctions exceed $750.” (Id. at p. 45.) The court explained: “The\nLegislature intended to create a $750 ‘bright line’ threshold for appealability of monetary\nsanction orders. [Citation.] A rule permitting aggregation of ‘same conduct’ or\n‘nonseparate’ sanctions would blur that bright line. In close cases . . . the sanctioned\nparty would be unsure whether to proceed by appeal or by writ petition. The wrong\ndecision could prove to be procedurally fatal. Bright lines are often too arbitrary to be of\nmuch use in the substantive law, but they are usually quite serviceable and even preferred\nas procedural rules, which should serve as clearly marked guideposts rather than traps for\nthe unwary.” (Calhoun, supra, at p. 45.)\n       We agree with the reasoning of Calhoun. Disaggregation of an order imposing\none monetary sanction, just as aggregation of an order or orders imposing multiple\nmonetary sanctions, would violate the bright line rule the Legislature has created for\nappeals of monetary sanctions orders and would create uncertainty. (See Calhoun, supra,\n20 Cal.App.4th at p. 45.) Just as a party subject to monetary sanctions may not aggregate\norders imposing sanctions of $5,000 or less in order to meet the appellate jurisdictional\n\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\flimit, a party that has been awarded monetary sanctions in excess of $5,000 may not\nbreak down the order into component parts to defeat appellate jurisdiction.1\n      It is true, as Nous argues, that Nous filed four separate discovery motions against\neach defendant, and the court’s June 17, 2014 and June 19, 2014 orders imposing\nmonetary sanctions against Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA state that the\ncourt was awarding $5,460 in monetary sanctions “as a total for these four motions.” The\ncourt’s June 12, 2014 order imposing monetary sanctions against Vittorio Cecchi Gori\nsimilarly states that the court was awarding $5,460 in monetary sanctions “given the\nrefusal to produce documents or to supplement the responses to the form interrogatories,\nspecial interrogatories, and the requests for admission.” The court’s monetary sanctions\norders also cite separate statutes on which the sanctions were based: Code of Civil\nProcedure sections 2030.300 (for the motions to compel further responses to Nous’s form\nand special interrogatories), 2031.310 (for the motions to compel further responses to\n\n\n1\n        Calhoun criticized Champion/L.B.S. Associates Development Co. v. E-Z Serve\nPetroleum Marketing, Inc. (1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 56, where the court considered a\nhypothetical similar to the facts of this case: “[W]e recognize that there may be\nsituations where ‘aggregating’ separate sanction awards in order to reach the [then-\napplicable] $750 minimum may be appropriate. Let us assume that a defendant\nsimultaneously propounds a set of interrogatories, a set of requests for admission, and a\nrequest for production of documents to a plaintiff, and defendant believes plaintiff’s\nresponses are inadequate. Defendant files a motion (or perhaps two or three motions) to\ncompel further discovery. Plaintiff then opposes the motion (or motions), asserting the\nresponses are complete. The trial court sides with defendant and issues three separate\nsanction awards of $600 each. In such a case, it could well be that it is the same conduct\nwhich is being sanctioned three times. If so, we think ‘aggregation’ would be proper.”\n(Id. at pp. 59-60.) Calhoun explained that “the very example given in [Champion/L.B.S.]\n– multiple sanctions after opposition to a motion to compel further discovery upon three\ndiscovery requests – illustrates the difficulty involved in applying such a standard: is\nthere a single course of misconduct in opposing the motion to compel, or are there\nmultiple instances of misconduct in failing to satisfy the three discovery requests?”\n(Calhoun, 20 Cal.App.4th at p. 44.) The court in Calhoun concluded that “the standards\nfor aggregation suggested by” Champion/L.B.S. were “too vague and unwieldy to be of\npractical value.” (Id. at p. 44.) The same concerns about aggregation described by the\nCalhoun court apply to the kind of disaggregation Nous argues for here.\n\n                                            10\n\fNous’s requests for production of documents), and 2033.290 (for the motion to compel\nfurther responses to Nous’s requests for admission). But Code of Civil Procedure section\n901.4, subdivision (a)(12), authorizes appeals from orders, like the orders in this case,\nthat impose monetary sanctions in excess of $5,000. Case law may not allow a party or\nattorney subject to an order imposing monetary sanctions to aggregate separate sanctions\nawards in order to reach $5,000 (see Calhoun, 20 Cal.App.4th at pp. 43-45), but there is\nno prohibition on a trial court combining monetary sanctions on separate motions into an\naggregate amount in one order. And when a trial court does so, the resulting order is\nappealable. Therefore, the trial court’s three orders here imposing monetary sanctions\nagainst each defendant in the amount of $5,460 are appealable.\n\n\n       B.     Standard of Review\n       “We review the order imposing the sanctions for an abuse of discretion, and we\nresolve any evidentiary conflicts most favorably to the trial court’s ruling, reversing ‘only\nif the trial court’s action was “‘“arbitrary, capricious, or whimsical.”’” [Citation.]’\n[Citation.]” (Ellis v. Toshiba America Information Systems, Inc. (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th\n853, 878 (Ellis); see Vidrio v. Hernandez (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1452 [“[w]e\ngenerally review orders for monetary sanctions under the deferential abuse of discretion\nstandard”].) The party or attorney subject to the sanction “has the burden to demonstrate\nthat the trial court erred, and where the evidence is in conflict we will not disturb the trial\ncourt’s factual findings.” (Ellis, at p. 878.) The intent of the sanctioned party “is not\nrelevant to the propriety of the monetary sanctions. ‘“There is no requirement that\nmisuse of the discovery process must be willful for a monetary sanction to be imposed.”\n[Citations.]’ [Citation.] ‘“Whenever one party’s improper actions – even if not ‘willful’\n– in seeking or resisting discovery necessitate the court’s intervention in a dispute, the\nlosing party presumptively should pay a sanction to the prevailing party.”’” (Ibid.; see\nParker v. Wolters Kluwer U.S., Inc. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 285, 294 [lack of substantial\njustification “is implied in the order awarding sanctions”].) Our review is limited, and\n\n\n                                              11\n\f“issues unrelated to the propriety of the monetary sanction are not cognizable.” (Doe v.\nUnited States Swimming, Inc. (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1424, 1433.)\n\n\n       C.     The Trial Court’s Orders Imposing Monetary Sanctions Were Not an\n              Abuse of Discretion\n       The three defendants do not argue that the trial court abused its discretion in\nimposing monetary sanctions because, although the court may have properly overruled\ntheir objections and granted the motions to compel, they acted with substantial\njustification in making the objections and opposing Nous’s motion to compel. Nor do the\ndefendants argue that there are other circumstances that make the imposition of the\nsanction unjust. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (d), 2031.310, subd. (h),\n2033.290, subd. (d).) Instead, the three defendants argue that the trial court abused its\ndiscretion in imposing monetary sanctions because their objections were valid and the\ntrial court should not have granted Nous’s motions to compel (and therefore, presumably,\nthey acted with substantial justification).\n       The defendants argue first that in January 2013, eight months before Nous served\nits written discovery in September 2013, they gave Nous “and its accountants unfettered\naccess to [Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA’s] corporate records.” The trial\ncourt, however, found that Cecchi Gori had not produced all responsive documents, and\nsubstantial evidence, primarily the several declarations of counsel for Nous, supports that\nfinding.2 Indeed, the court’s ruling took into account that Cecchi Gori Pictures and\nCecchi Gori USA may have produced some of the documents Nous was asking for in\ndiscovery by ruling that, “[t]o the extent the documents have already been produced as\nrequired in conformity with [Code of Civil Procedure sections] 2031.210-2031.250, the\n\n\n2\n       Counsel for Nous stated in his declarations that at one point Cecchi Gori Pictures\nand Cecchi Gori USA produced 49 pages of documents, but they did not produce most of\nthe documents requested by Nous. Two months after Nous filed its motions to compel,\nCecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA “made a supplemental production of 166\npages of documents.”\n                                              12\n\fresponses should so state and identify which documents already produced are responsive\nto the particular demand.” More generally, the defendants’ position that they did not\nhave to respond to formal written discovery and produce documents because they had\npreviously made their books and records available was flawed. Even if a party has\nvoluntarily produced documents earlier in or before the commencement of the litigation,\nthat party must still respond to written discovery and (again) make available for\ninspection and copying documents responsive to specific requests. The trial court did not\nabuse its discretion in sanctioning the defendants for unsuccessfully opposing the\nmotions on the ground that they had previously produced documents to Nous.\n       The defendants argue next that much of the information sought and many of the\ndocuments requested by Nous were not discoverable because they were outside the issues\nframed by the complaint. Specifically, Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA argue\nthat discovery related to their ownership and control and to the Italian Judgment Nous\nseeks to domesticate was legitimate, but discovery relating to the Nunnari action and the\nfinancial relationship among the three defendants was not. As the trial court correctly\nexplained in its orders, however, the Nunnari action and its proceeds are at the “heart” of\nthis action, and Nous’s discovery requests sought information that would locate and trace\n“what happened to those funds.” Nous’s financial discovery properly sought documents\nand information that was relevant and reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of\nadmissible evidence regarding several of the main issues in the case, including the\nownership and control Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA and the whereabouts\nof the proceeds of the judgment in the Nunnari action. Indeed, financial documents and\ninformation often prove ownership and control among related business entities. (See,\ne.g., Doak v. Superior Court for Los Angeles County (1968) 257 Cal.App.2d 825, 835, fn.\n8 [“information as to the financial condition of a corporate defendant is admissible and\ndiscoverable before trial in an action involving an alter ego issue”]; Iantosca v. Benistar\nAdmin Services, Inc. (S.D. Ind. 2012) 2012 WL 392994, p. *3 [“bank records may show\nundercapitalization [and] corporate control”]; Del Campo v. American Corrective\nCounseling Services, Inc. (N.D. Cal. 2008) 2008 WL 4858502, p. *4 [granting motion to\n\n                                             13\n\fcompel production of “financial records that may show payment of non-corporate\nexpenses by a corporation, siphoning of funds from the corporation by the dominant\nstockholder, commingling of funds and other assets, failure to segregate funds of the\nseparate entities, the misuse by an individual of the assets of the corporation, the absence\nof corporate assets, and undercapitalization or the manipulation of assets and liabilities\nbetween entities so as to concentrate the assets in one and the liabilities in another”].)\n       More fundamentally, the defendants’ theory that discovery was limited to what\nthey contend Nous needed in order to prove its specific causes of action is inconsistent\nwith California law. Documents and information are discoverable if they are\nunprivileged and either relevant or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of\nadmissible evidence. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.010.) Contrary to the defendants’\nassertion, “[d]iscovery . . . is not confined to the actual issues framed by the pleadings.”\n(Anti-Defamation League of B’nai B’rith v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1072,\n1095; see State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. v. Lee (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 34, 40\n[California law “allow[s] a broad scope of discovery,” including “inquir[y] concerning\nextraneous issues”]; Puerto v. Superior Court (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1249\n[“discovery statutes are to be construed broadly in favor of disclosure, so as to uphold the\nright to discovery whenever possible”]; Mercury Interactive Corp. v. Klein (2007) 158\nCal.App.4th 60, 98 [“[a]ny doubts regarding relevance are generally resolved in favor of\nallowing the discovery,” and “[b]ecause of the breadth of the standard of discovery\nrelevance, ‘[m]uch of the information that surfaces during pretrial discovery may be\nunrelated, or only tangentially related, to the underlying cause of action’”]; Jessen v.\nHartford Casualty Ins. Co. (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 698, 711 [the scope of discovery “is\n‘broader than the issues’ and is not limited to admissible evidence”].) Indeed, “the\nDiscovery Act, by its very terms, authorizes inquiry into even irrelevant matters so long\nas their revelation may lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Dodge, Warren &\nPeters Ins. Services, Inc. v. Riley (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 1414, 1420; see Children’s\nHospital Central California v. Blue Cross of California (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1260,\n1276 [“[f]or discovery purposes, information is relevant if it might reasonably assist a\n\n                                              14\n\fparty in evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement”].) The trial\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in sanctioning the defendants for unsuccessfully\nopposing the motions on the ground that Nous’s discovery was irrelevant.\n       The defendants also argue that the discovery requests seeking communications\namong the defendants and financial information asked for information that is protected by\nCecchi Gori’s right of privacy. As the trial court recognized, however, privacy protection\nis not absolute. In Puerto v. Superior Court, supra, 158 Cal.App.4th 1242, this court\nsummarized the framework for evaluating such privacy objections. “First, a claimant\nmust possess a ‘legally protected privacy interest.’ [Citation.] Second, the claimant must\nhave a reasonable expectation of privacy under the particular circumstances, including\nthe customs, practices, and physical settings surrounding particular activities. [Citation.]\nThird, the invasion of privacy must be serious in nature, scope, and actual or potential\nimpact. . . . If there is a reasonable expectation of privacy and the invasion of privacy is\nserious, then the court must balance the privacy interest at stake against other competing\nor countervailing interests, which include the interest of the requesting party, fairness to\nthe litigants in conducting the litigation, and the consequences of granting or restricting\naccess to the information.” (Id. at pp. 1250-1251.) The trial court properly applied this\nanalysis. Citing In re Ins. Installment Fee Cases (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 1395, 1428, the\ncourt noted that “[i]n civil cases courts must ‘indulge in a careful balancing of the right of\ncivil litigants to discover relevant facts, on the one hand, with the right of [individuals] to\nmaintain reasonable privacy regarding their financial affairs, on the other.’” The court\nfound that “[t]he documents in question are highly relevant to [Nous’s] claims” and that,\nto the extent any privacy interests were implicated, they “are outweighed by [Nous’s]\nright to a fair trial.” No abuse of discretion here.\n       Finally, the defendants argue Nous’s discovery was overbroad and unduly\nburdensome. None of the defendants, however, submitted any evidence showing the\nnature and extent of the burden, as required. (See West Pico Furniture Co. v. Superior\nCourt (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 417; Mead Reinsurance Co. v. Superior Court (1986) 188\nCal.App.3d 313, 321.) And the trial court actually sustained the overbreadth objections\n\n                                              15\n\fand limited production of documents to the time period after 2001. Again, the defendants\nhave not shown an abuse of discretion.\n\n\n                                    DISPOSITION\n\n\n      The orders are affirmed.

The background of the underlying\ncontroversy is complex, involving the relationship of several foreign corporations and\ntheir subsidiaries, allegations of fraudulent transfers of millions of dollars, and one of the\nlargest corporate bankruptcies in Italian history. The issues in this appeal, however, are\nrelatively straightforward. Each the three defendants appeals a discovery order that\nimposed monetary sanctions in the amount of $5,460. After determining that the orders\nare appealable, we conclude the trial court acted well within its discretion in imposing\nmonetary sanctions, and affirm.\n\n\n                  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n\n       A.     The Allegations in the Complaint\n       This action is one of a series of lawsuits in the United States and Italy, all arising\nout of the collapse of the financial empire of Vittorio Cecchi Gori, an Italian businessman\nand film producer. According to the allegations in the complaint in this action, Cecchi\nGori fraudulently transferred millions of dollars from the bankruptcy estate of his limited\nliability company, Fin.Ma. Vi S.p.A (Finmavi), in an effort to put assets out of the reach\nof creditors. Cecchi Gori was the sole shareholder, president, and chairman of the board\nof directors of Finmavi. “At its peak, [Finmavi] operated more than 40 companies in the\nbusiness of film production, distribution, exhibition, television multimedia, real estate,\nand professional soccer.”\n       Nous S.r.l. (Nous) is an Italian limited liability company in the real estate business\nthat Cecchi Gori used to own. Nous is now undergoing liquidation under the jurisdiction\nof the Court of Rome, which appointed Davide Franco and Sergio Torri as co-liquidators\nof Nous to satisfy the debts of Nous’s creditors. Nous owns 100 percent of a\nLuxembourg company called Promint Holdings S.A., which in turn owns 100 percent of\n\n                                              2\n\fa Dutch company called Cecchi Gori Group Europe B.V., which in turns owns 100\npercent of the two United States companies involved in this action, Cecchi Gori Pictures\nand Cecchi Gori USA, Inc. Based on these allegations, Nous claimed that it “is the\nultimate parent” of Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA.\n       Nous alleged that for many years Cecchi Gori “systematically transferred funds\nfrom one entity to another entity within his control for his own personal benefit and to the\ndetriment of creditors. For example, Cecchi Gori authorized [Finmavi] to finance multi-\nmillion dollar loans that were both interest-free and unsecured to other entities controlled\nby Cecchi Gori, hid assets from [Finmavi] and other entities within Cecchi Gori’s control\nfor his own personal benefit at the detriment of the company’s creditors and utilized\n[Finmavi’s] funds for his own personal expenses.” Nous alleged that Cecchi Gori\ntransferred over $8.5 million to Nous, over $2 million to Cecchi Gori Pictures, and over\n$45 million to Cecchi Gori USA.\n       Nous alleged that in 2005 Finmavi filed in the Ordinary Court of Rome the Italian\nequivalent of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition, with “more than $927 million in debt.”\nNous alleged that in October 2006 the Bankruptcy Division of the Ordinary Court of\nRome rejected Cecchi Gori’s proposed reorganization plan. The Court of Rome\nsubsequently confirmed Franco and Torri as co-liquidators of Nous. According to Nous,\nNous owed Finmavi almost $9 million, and Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA\ncollectively owed Finmavi “approximately $47 million as a result of funds Cecchi Gori\ncaused [Finmavi] to transfer to [these two] entities.”\n       In 2008 Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA became involved initially as\ndefendants in a lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court filed by a former officer of\nCecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA named Gianni Nunnari, which the parties\nrefer to as the Nunnari action. Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA filed and\nultimately prevailed on a cross-complaint in the Nunnari action, and in March 2011 they\nobtained a judgment in the amount of $13,786,465. In April 2011 the Ordinary Court of\nRome, 6th Criminal Division, “issued an order granting Nous recovery of” the\n$13,786,465 judgment Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA had obtained in the\n\n                                             3\n\fNunnari action. According to Nous, the Italian court, “[i]n order to prevent Cecchi Gori\nfrom obtaining, spending or removing the money from the legitimate expectation of\ncreditors,” issued an order stating that Nous is entitled to the proceeds of the Nunnari\njudgment. Nous refers to this order as the “Italian Judgment.”\n       Thus, Nous alleged that the $13,786,465 judgment Cecchi Gori Pictures and\nCecchi Gori USA obtained in the Nunnari action “is one of the assets controlled by Nous\nthat is subject to liquidation.” Noting that Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA\nwere attempting to collect on the Nunnari judgment, Nous alleged that Cecchi Gori was\nseeking to violate Italian court orders and judgments and “to engage in continued\nbankruptcy fraud to loot the assets of [Finmavi] and other entities he controls or\ncontrolled to put them beyond the reach of creditors.”    Nous sought a declaration that it\nis the “ultimate parent company” of Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA and is\nentitled to the proceeds of the $13,786,465 judgment in the Nunnari action, recognition of\nthe Italian Judgment under the Uniform Foreign-Country Money Judgments Recognition\nAct (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1713-1724), and the appointment of a receiver for Cecchi Gori\nPictures and Cecchi Gori USA.\n\n\n       B.     The Written Discovery\n       Nous propounded sets of written discovery to all three defendants, Cecchi Gori\nPictures, Cecchi Gori USA, and Vittorio Cecchi Gori: requests for production of\ndocuments, special interrogatories, form interrogatories, and requests for admission. The\nthree defendants responded primarily with objections.\n       The discovery served by Nous fell into several general categories (four according\nto Nous in the trial court, five according to Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA on\nappeal). The discovery requests generally sought documents and information relating to\nownership and control of Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA, recognition of the\nItalian Judgment, and enforcement of the Nunnari judgment. The discovery also sought\nfinancial and other documents and information about the relationship between Vittorio\nCecchi Gori and the two entities, Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA. Nous\n\n                                             4\n\frefers to this discovery as “facts related to the Finmavi bankruptcy that led to the\nappointment of [Franco] and [Torri] as liquidators of Nous charged with taking control of\n[Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA’s] assets.” The three defendants refer to this\ndiscovery as “any and all financial information related to [Cecchi Gori Pictures and\nCecchi Gori USA] and Vittorio Cecchi Gori.”\n       The defendants asserted various and numerous objections to Nous’s written\ndiscovery, including that the discovery was not relevant or reasonably calculated to lead\nto the discovery of admissible evidence, was overbroad, burdensome and oppressive,\ncalled for production of documents and information protected by the attorney-client\nprivilege and the work product doctrine, violated Cecchi Gori’s privacy rights, sought\ndocuments that were public records, and demanded information that was not discoverable\nunder Civil Code section 3295. The defendants also asserted that they had previously\nproduced the documents that Nous was seeking in discovery.\n       Nous moved to compel further responses to its written discovery, for production of\ndocuments, and for monetary sanctions under the discovery statutes. The defendants\nopposed the motions, arguing that they had produced all documents relating to the\nownership and control of Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA, which the\ndefendants claimed were the only relevant issues in the case, and that Nous was not\nentitled in this action to take discovery on any other issues.\n\n\n       C.      The Trial Court’s Orders\n       The trial court heard Nous’s discovery motions against Vittorio Cecchi Gori on\nJune 12, 2014, Nous’s discovery motions against Cecchi Gori Pictures on June 17, 2014,\nand Nous’s discovery motions against Cecchi Gori USA on June 19, 2014. The court\nissued minute orders, of 20, 21, and 5 pages, respectively, granting the motions to compel\nalmost in their entirety and imposing monetary sanctions against the responding party and\nhis or its attorneys.\n       In its June 12, 2014 order the court noted that Cecchi Gori’s “opposition fails to\naddress the motions regarding the [requests for production of documents], form\n\n                                              5\n\finterrogatories, and special interrogatories,” and “offers no specific arguments regarding\nwhy he should not be compelled to provide further responses to these requests.” The\ncourt also noted that Cecchi Gori “essentially failed to produce any responsive documents\nwhatsoever. While he indicated that he would produce all non-privileged documents\nwith regards to certain requests, he has not done so.” The court overruled Cecchi Gori’s\nobjections based on relevancy (because relevancy is not the standard for discovery),\nprivacy (finding, after “a careful balancing,” that Nous’s right to a fair trial outweighed\nCecchi Gori’s privacy interests), foreign prosecution (concluding the Fifth Amendment\ndid not apply to “potential foreign prosecution”), and other objections, and ordered\nCecchi Gori to provide a log of any privileged documents. On the issue of monetary\nsanctions, the trial court believed Cecchi Gori’s discovery responses were “totally\ninadequate and shocking” and that it was “a clear-cut issue.” The court stated: “The\ncourt finds that sanctions are appropriate under [Code of Civil Procedure sections]\n2030.300[, subdivision] (d), 2031.310[, subdivision] (h), and 2033.290[, subdivision] (d).\nThe imposition of sanctions would not be unjust given the refusal to produce documents\nor to supplement the responses to the form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and the\nrequests for admission. Defendant [Vittorio Cecchi] Gori and his counsel are ordered to\npay sanctions of $5,460 to Plaintiffs within 20 days.” Cecchi Gori filed a notice of\nappeal on June 16, 2014.\n       The court made similar rulings in its June 17, 2014 and June 19, 2014 orders with\nrespect to Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA. After explaining in detail the\ninadequacies of the responses to Form Interrogatory No. 17.1 with respect to Nous’s\nrequests for admission, the court overruled objections similar to those asserted by Cecchi\nGori. On the issue of monetary sanctions, the court found: “Sanctions are required\nagainst a party who unsuccessfully opposes a motion to compel further responses to\ninterrogatories, [requests for production of documents], and [requests for admissions],\nunless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial\njustification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.\n[Code Civ. Proc.,] §§ 2030.300, 2031.310, 2033.290. [¶] [Counsel for Nous] states that\n\n                                              6\n\fNous incurred $5,460 on these four motion[s] for 7 hours at $405 ($2,835) plus one hour\nat $605 ($605) on the motion, another 2 hours at $405 ($810) on reply, and another 2\nhours at $605 for the hearing ($1,210). . . . The court finds the sanctions request\nappropriate under the circumstances as a total for these four motions.” The court ordered\nCecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA each “to pay sanctions of $5,460 to plaintiffs’\ncounsel in 20 days.” Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA filed notices of appeal\non July 7, 2014.\n\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n\n       A.     The Orders Are Appealable\n       “The existence of an appealable judgment is a jurisdictional prerequisite to an\nappeal.” (Jennings v.

Therefore, they are appealable.\n       Nous acknowledges that “[t]he sum total of the sanctions imposed on four separate\nmotions was $5,460.00 per defendant.” Nous argues, however, that the orders are not\nappealable because “the monetary sanctions cover four separate motions, which in turn\naddress four separate sets of discovery, and expressly notes that the authority for the\nmonetary sanctions flows from three distinct statutory provisions dealing with requests\nfor production, requests for admission, and interrogatories.” Nous asserts that, although\nthe figure “$1,365” does not appear in any of the three orders, the trial court effectively\nsanctioned each defendant “$1,365.00 on each of the four discovery motions.” Nous\ncontends that the three defendants are “attempt[ing] to improperly aggregate the\nsanctions related to four separate motions to meet the $5,000 statutory threshold for\nappealability under [Code of Civil Procedure section] 904.1[, subdivision] (a)(12).”\n       Contrary to Nous’s assertion, the defendants are not improperly aggregating\nseparate monetary sanctions awards of less than $5,000. To the contrary, it is Nous that\nis improperly disaggregating a monetary sanctions award of greater than $5,000 into\nseparate monetary sanctions awards of less than $5,000. As Vittorio Cecchi Gori points\nout, the order “imposes a single monetary sanction against [him] in the amount of\n$5,460.00,” does not “mention the amount of ‘$1,365,’” “nor in any way indicate[s] that\nthe $5,460 sanction award was to be divided or apportioned in any manner.” As Cecchi\nGori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA argue, “[b]ecause the sanctions award was a single\n\n                                              8\n\famount, payable to a single entity, the $5,4[60] figure (as to each [entity]) cannot be\ncharacterized as an aggregated amount.”\n       Discussing the attempted aggregation of two orders imposing monetary sanctions,\neach of which was below the then-statutory limit of $750, the court in Calhoun, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2248209\"><a href=\"/opinion/2248209/calhoun-v-vallejo-city-unified-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> held: “We conclude that because of the Legislature’s intent to reduce the\nnumber of appeals from monetary sanction orders and the confusion that would result\nfrom a rule permitting aggregation, multiple sub-$750 sanctions may not be aggregated\nunder any circumstances to meet the appealability threshold of [former] section 904.1,\nsubdivision (k). We endorse a bright line rule that a sanction order is nonappealable if it\ndoes not impose any sanction exceeding $750, and thus an order requiring payment of\nmultiple sanctions, none of which exceed[s] $750, is nonappealable even if the total\naggregated sanctions exceed $750.” (Id. at p. 45.) The court explained: “The\nLegislature intended to create a $750 ‘bright line’ threshold for appealability of monetary\nsanction orders. [Citation.] A rule permitting aggregation of ‘same conduct’ or\n‘nonseparate’ sanctions would blur that bright line. In close cases . . . the sanctioned\nparty would be unsure whether to proceed by appeal or by writ petition. The wrong\ndecision could prove to be procedurally fatal. Bright lines are often too arbitrary to be of\nmuch use in the substantive law, but they are usually quite serviceable and even preferred\nas procedural rules, which should serve as clearly marked guideposts rather than traps for\nthe unwary.” (Calhoun, supra, at p. 45.)\n       We agree with the reasoning of Calhoun. Disaggregation of an order imposing\none monetary sanction, just as aggregation of an order or orders imposing multiple\nmonetary sanctions, would violate the bright line rule the Legislature has created for\nappeals of monetary sanctions orders and would create uncertainty. (See Calhoun, supra,\n20 Cal.App.4th at p. 45.) Just as a party subject to monetary sanctions may not aggregate\norders imposing sanctions of $5,000 or less in order to meet the appellate jurisdictional\n\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\flimit, a party that has been awarded monetary sanctions in excess of $5,000 may not\nbreak down the order into component parts to defeat appellate jurisdiction.1\n      It is true, as Nous argues, that Nous filed four separate discovery motions against\neach defendant, and the court’s June 17, 2014 and June 19, 2014 orders imposing\nmonetary sanctions against Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA state that the\ncourt was awarding $5,460 in monetary sanctions “as a total for these four motions.” The\ncourt’s June 12, 2014 order imposing monetary sanctions against Vittorio Cecchi Gori\nsimilarly states that the court was awarding $5,460 in monetary sanctions “given the\nrefusal to produce documents or to supplement the responses to the form interrogatories,\nspecial interrogatories, and the requests for admission.” The court’s monetary sanctions\norders also cite separate statutes on which the sanctions were based: Code of Civil\nProcedure sections 2030.300 (for the motions to compel further responses to Nous’s form\nand special interrogatories), 2031.310 (for the motions to compel further responses to\n\n\n1\n        Calhoun criticized Champion/L.B.S.

Let us assume that a defendant\nsimultaneously propounds a set of interrogatories, a set of requests for admission, and a\nrequest for production of documents to a plaintiff, and defendant believes plaintiff’s\nresponses are inadequate. Defendant files a motion (or perhaps two or three motions) to\ncompel further discovery. Plaintiff then opposes the motion (or motions), asserting the\nresponses are complete. The trial court sides with defendant and issues three separate\nsanction awards of $600 each. In such a case, it could well be that it is the same conduct\nwhich is being sanctioned three times. If so, we think ‘aggregation’ would be proper.”\n(Id. at pp. 59-60.) Calhoun explained that “the very example given in [Champion/L.B.S.]\n– multiple sanctions after opposition to a motion to compel further discovery upon three\ndiscovery requests – illustrates the difficulty involved in applying such a standard: is\nthere a single course of misconduct in opposing the motion to compel, or are there\nmultiple instances of misconduct in failing to satisfy the three discovery requests?”\n(Calhoun, 20 Cal.App.4th at p. 44.) The court in Calhoun concluded that “the standards\nfor aggregation suggested by” Champion/L.B.S. were “too vague and unwieldy to be of\npractical value.” (Id. at p. 44.) The same concerns about aggregation described by the\nCalhoun court apply to the kind of disaggregation Nous argues for here.\n\n                                            10\n\fNous’s requests for production of documents), and 2033.290 (for the motion to compel\nfurther responses to Nous’s requests for admission). But Code of Civil Procedure section\n901.4, subdivision (a)(12), authorizes appeals from orders, like the orders in this case,\nthat impose monetary sanctions in excess of $5,000. Case law may not allow a party or\nattorney subject to an order imposing monetary sanctions to aggregate separate sanctions\nawards in order to reach $5,000 (see Calhoun, 20 Cal.App.4th at pp. 43-45), but there is\nno prohibition on a trial court combining monetary sanctions on separate motions into an\naggregate amount in one order. And when a trial court does so, the resulting order is\nappealable. Therefore, the trial court’s three orders here imposing monetary sanctions\nagainst each defendant in the amount of $5,460 are appealable.\n\n\n       B.

The Trial Court’s Orders Imposing Monetary Sanctions Were Not an\n              Abuse of Discretion\n       The three defendants do not argue that the trial court abused its discretion in\nimposing monetary sanctions because, although the court may have properly overruled\ntheir objections and granted the motions to compel, they acted with substantial\njustification in making the objections and opposing Nous’s motion to compel. Nor do the\ndefendants argue that there are other circumstances that make the imposition of the\nsanction unjust. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (d), 2031.310, subd. (h),\n2033.290, subd. (d).) Instead, the three defendants argue that the trial court abused its\ndiscretion in imposing monetary sanctions because their objections were valid and the\ntrial court should not have granted Nous’s motions to compel (and therefore, presumably,\nthey acted with substantial justification).\n       The defendants argue first that in January 2013, eight months before Nous served\nits written discovery in September 2013, they gave Nous “and its accountants unfettered\naccess to [Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA’s] corporate records.” The trial\ncourt, however, found that Cecchi Gori had not produced all responsive documents, and\nsubstantial evidence, primarily the several declarations of counsel for Nous, supports that\nfinding.2 Indeed, the court’s ruling took into account that Cecchi Gori Pictures and\nCecchi Gori USA may have produced some of the documents Nous was asking for in\ndiscovery by ruling that, “[t]o the extent the documents have already been produced as\nrequired in conformity with [Code of Civil Procedure sections] 2031.210-2031.250, the\n\n\n2\n       Counsel for Nous stated in his declarations that at one point Cecchi Gori Pictures\nand Cecchi Gori USA produced 49 pages of documents, but they did not produce most of\nthe documents requested by Nous. Two months after Nous filed its motions to compel,\nCecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA “made a supplemental production of 166\npages of documents.”\n                                              12\n\fresponses should so state and identify which documents already produced are responsive\nto the particular demand.” More generally, the defendants’ position that they did not\nhave to respond to formal written discovery and produce documents because they had\npreviously made their books and records available was flawed. Even if a party has\nvoluntarily produced documents earlier in or before the commencement of the litigation,\nthat party must still respond to written discovery and (again) make available for\ninspection and copying documents responsive to specific requests. The trial court did not\nabuse its discretion in sanctioning the defendants for unsuccessfully opposing the\nmotions on the ground that they had previously produced documents to Nous.\n       The defendants argue next that much of the information sought and many of the\ndocuments requested by Nous were not discoverable because they were outside the issues\nframed by the complaint. Specifically, Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA argue\nthat discovery related to their ownership and control and to the Italian Judgment Nous\nseeks to domesticate was legitimate, but discovery relating to the Nunnari action and the\nfinancial relationship among the three defendants was not. As the trial court correctly\nexplained in its orders, however, the Nunnari action and its proceeds are at the “heart” of\nthis action, and Nous’s discovery requests sought information that would locate and trace\n“what happened to those funds.” Nous’s financial discovery properly sought documents\nand information that was relevant and reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of\nadmissible evidence regarding several of the main issues in the case, including the\nownership and control Cecchi Gori Pictures and Cecchi Gori USA and the whereabouts\nof the proceeds of the judgment in the Nunnari action. Indeed, financial documents and\ninformation often prove ownership and control among related business entities. (See,\ne.g., Doak v.
