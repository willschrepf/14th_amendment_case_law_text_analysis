They also acknowledge the plain language of the Rule requires\n\nexclusion, but nevertheless they argue the trial court’s admission of Exhibit “A” was\n\nproper because there was good cause or because its admission did not cause unfair\n\nsurprise to Hydrogeo. Appellees’ Brief at 8-10.\n\n      Contrary to Taxing Entities’ statements to the trial court and in their Brief,\n\nExhibit “A” did not consist only of updated tax statements of previously produced\n\ndocuments. Exhibit “A” contains seven pages, two of which (p. 4 and 7) were never\n\nproduced by Taxing Entities. Significantly, those two pages were emphasized by\n\nTaxing Entities during the trial, and in Appellee’s Brief at p.15. Because at least a\n\nportion of the documents was never produced, and because Taxing Entities’\n                                         1\n\fintentional withholding of the applicable documents caused Appellants to be at a\n\ndisadvantage during trial, Taxing Entities are unable to carry their burden of proving\n\na lack of unfair surprise.\n\n      Along those same lines, Taxing Entities wholly fail to show good cause for\n\ntheir refusal to supply the documents prior to trial. In order to prevail on this\n\nexception, they must show in the record some legitimate reason explaining their\n\nfailure to comply with Rule 193.6. Since Exhibit “A” shows Appellees had these\n\ndocuments in their possession seventeen days prior to trial, but still chose not to\n\nproduce them, good cause does not exist. The improperly admitted Exhibit “A”\n\nconstitutes the only evidence offered by Taxing Entities at trial. Without it, their\n\nclaims must fail as a matter of law. The trial court’s decision to admit this document\n\nin contravention of Rule 193.6 caused it to render an improper judgment, which\n\nshould be reversed and rendered.\n\n      Regarding Issue Number 2, Appellees apparently concede they had no right\n\nto foreclose Hydrogeo’s personalty, but argue that since the Judgment forecloses on\n\nonly real property, Hydrogeo’s arguments are neither “relevant nor applicable”.\n\nBrief p. 17. Hydrogeo has shown that Taxing Entities are required to tax the\n\npersonalty and realty separately, and in this case, should have segregated the portion\n\nof the alleged tax lien which was unenforceable. Contrary to Taxing Entities’\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\frepresentations, they did tax some of Hydrogeo’s personalty, at least according to\n\ntheir own records.\n\n      Since at least a portion of the foreclosed tax lien originates from taxes on\n\nHydrogeo’s     personalty,   which     apparently    Appellees     acknowledge     was\n\nunenforceable, the trial court was required to segregate that portion of the lien from\n\nthe realty. Taxing Entities offered no evidence allowing the trial court to segregate\n\nthe lien. The trial court’s decision to render the entire lien enforceable was error.\n\n                                    ARGUMENT\n\n                                     ISSUE NO. 1\n\n      Did the trial court commit reversible error by admitting Plaintiffs’\nExhibit “A” into evidence when the document had not been timely produced\nprior to trial, and when Taxing Entities failed to show good cause for its failure\nto timely supplement discovery responses.\n\n\n      Appellees miss the point of this issue. Part of the disagreement arises from\n\nTaxing Entities’ misunderstanding of their violation of Rule 193.6. Hydrogeo’s\n\ndiscovery request was not a request for disclosure as referenced in Appellees’ Brief\n\nand as dealt with in the case relied upon by Appellees. Hydrogeo sent a request for\n\nproduction of documents specifically asking for copies of “each and every tangible\n\npiece of evidence you plan to use at the trial of this cause”. 2 R.R. p. 8, line 21 – p.\n\n9, line 1. A request for disclosure seeks information, not documents. A request for\n\nproduction seeks specific documents, in this case all documents to be used as\n\n                                           3\n\fevidence at trial. Taxing Entities’ failure to provide these documents negatively\n\nimpacted Hydrogeo’s trial preparation and presentation. As stated in Rule 193.1,\n\n“when responding to written discovery, a party must make a complete response,\n\nbased on all information reasonably available to the responding party.”\n\n       Taxing Entities, without question failed to comply with Rule 193.1 in that they\n\ndid not produce the evidence they intended to offer at trial. They admit as much in\n\ntheir Brief. Additionally, Taxing Entities failed to offer any basis for good cause\n\nexplaining why the documents in question were not produced prior to trial, instead\n\nfocusing primarily on the defense of lack of unfair surprise. As a reminder, the\n\nburden of establishing lack of unfair surprise rests with Appellees, as the party\n\noffering the discovery, and such proof must be supported by the record. Rule 193.6\n\n(b).\n\n       Taxing Entities use as their foundational defense the case of Williams vs.\n\nCounty of Dallas 194 S.W.3d 29, 33 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2006 pet den’d), a case\n\ndistinguishable on several important grounds. First, Williams dealt with a request\n\nfor disclosure which only asks for information. Our request required production of\n\nall evidence you intend to offer at trial. Hydrogeo had no way to know ahead of\n\ntime what documents Appellees planned to introduce as evidence, or whether\n\nAppellees planned to use any, all or none of the documents previously produced in\n\ndiscovery. The purpose of generating a request for production such as the one at\n\n                                          4\n\fissue here is to determine what documents will be considered by the Court and to\n\nproperly prepare responses, cross examination and rebuttal, if needed, of any\n\ndocuments presented.       By intentionally withholding the requested documents,\n\nAppellees sought, and eventually were allowed, an unfair advantage.\n\n      Also, in the Williams case, the trial court conducted an examination\n\ncomparing the information offered as evidence with the information previously\n\nproduced by the offering party. In our case, the trial court never conducted such an\n\nexamination.\n\n      By its nature, a failure to produce a document introduced at trial constitutes\n\nsome surprise.     Appellees argue that their discovery responses, which were\n\nimproperly filed with the district clerk, prevent Hydrogeo from being surprised by\n\nthe Exhibit “A” which was offered into evidence. Appellees’ Brief at 10-12. There\n\nis no evidence in the record that the trial court had access to, or consulted the district\n\nclerk’s file prior to admitting Exhibit “A”.\n\n      Moreover, at least two of the documents, pages 4 and 7 of Exhibit “A”, were\n\nnever produced in discovery or as an exhibit to pleadings. Significantly, those two\n\ndocuments constitute the foundation of Appellees’ argument on appeal, as well as\n\nduring the testimony of Carol Taylor, Wood County Tax Assessor. Appellees’ Brief\n\nat 15 and R.R. Volume 2, p. 80, line 4-11 and p.85, line 24 - P. 86, line 6. These two\n\ndocuments are significant, in that they were used by Taxing Entities to connect\n\n                                            5\n\fHydrogeo as the record owner of the specific leases in question and as the owner of\n\nspecific percentages of the interest involved for the years 2009 - 2011. Appellees’\n\nBrief at 15 and R.R. Volume 2, p. 83, line 21-p. 84, line 5. But for the trial court’s\n\nimproper decision to admit pages 4 and 7 of Exhibit “A”, Taxing Entities had no\n\ndocumentation showing Hydrogeo as the subsequent owner of specific lease I.D.\n\nnumber N366491 and I.D. number N366493. Since ownership of the lease was a\n\ncontested issue, to allow this improper evidence to be admitted led to an improper\n\njudgment.    Even if Hydrogeo’s subsequent testimony acknowledged current\n\nownership, there was no connection of Hydrogeo to the specific tax ID numbers.\n\nAppellees would not have been successful without relying on the rebuttable\n\npresumption created by the introduction of Exhibit “A”.\n\n      As stated in Lopez vs. La Madeleine of Texas, Inc., 200 S.W.3d. 854, (Tex\n\nApp. —Dallas 2006, no pet.), Rule 193.6 is mandatory and the penalty is automatic,\n\nabsent a showing of good cause and/or unfair surprise. Rule 193.6 relates to the\n\ndiscovery of evidence, not the issues. Its principle purpose is to protect a party from\n\nsurprise, whether or not such evidence relates to an issue both parties knew existed\n\nin the case. As the Court stated, “we are concerned not only with whether or not\n\n[Lopez] should have prevailed, but also the effect of opponents’ introduction of the\n\nundisclosed evidence on his preparation for trial and presentation of his case, both\n\nof which were undeniably impacted by the trial court’s decision to admit the\n\n                                          6\n\fevidence.” Id. The Lopez court further states that it is not necessary for the\n\ncomplaining party to prove that “but for” the exclusion of the evidence, a different\n\njudgment would necessarily have resulted. They are only required to show that the\n\nexclusion of evidence probably resulted in the rendition of an improper judgment.\n\nIn short, Appellees failed to show lack of unfair surprise.\n\n                       GOOD CAUSE DOES NOT EXIST\n\n      Appellees also argue there is an “implied” finding of good cause, despite the\n\nplain wording of Rule 193.6 which states that a finding of good cause must be\n\n(explicitly) supported by the record. Appellees’ Brief at 10-12. The Supreme Court\n\nin Alvarado v. Farah Mfg. Co., 830 S.W. 2d 911, 914 (Tex. 1992), states “the good\n\ncause exception permits the trial court to excuse a failure to comply with discovery\n\nin difficult or impossible circumstances” (emphasis added). The Rule as\n\ninterpreted by the Supreme Court requires Taxing Entities to offer evidence as to\n\nwhy complying with the Rule was difficult or impossible. A review of Exhibit “A”\n\nshows the documents were generated and printed on “August 22, 2014 at 11:43\n\na.m.”. Appendix A. Since the trial did not take place until September 8th, the\n\ndocuments themselves prove they existed and were in the Taxing Entities’\n\npossession seventeen days prior to trial. Therefore any attempt to show good cause\n\nrings hollow.\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f           COURT’S ERROR CAUSED IMPROPER JUDGMENT\n\n      Pursuant to Rule 44.4, Texas Rules of Appellant Procedure, no judgment may\n\nbe reversed on appeal unless the error complained of probably caused rendition of\n\nan improper judgment.       Appellee argues there was testimony to support the\n\nJudgment, even if Exhibit “A” had not been admitted. Appellees’ Brief at 15.\n\nContrary to Appellees’ argument, all of the testimony cited was simply the tax\n\nassessor reading Exhibit “A” itself verbatim. R.R. Volume 2, p. 79, line 8 – 13; p.\n\n80, line 4-11; and p. 85, line 24-p.86, line 6. Simply stated, Taxing Entities must\n\nstand or fall on the information and alleged presumption represented by the\n\ndocuments referred to as Exhibit “A”. If they were improperly admitted, their case\n\nfails due to a lack of any evidence to support the trial court’s judgment.\n\n      The test is whether the trial court acted without reference to any guiding rules\n\nor principals, or arbitrarily or unreasonably. Perry Homes v. Cull, 258 S.W. 3d 580,\n\n602 (Tex. 2008). As stated by the Supreme Court in Alvarado, Rule 193.6 is\n\nmandatory and the trial court has no discretion to admit testimony excluded by the\n\nRule without a showing of good cause. Id. Since there was no other admissible\n\nevidence offered at trial by Taxing Entities, and the Exhibit “A” described herein\n\nshould not have been admitted, and the testimony of Ms. Taylor was simply\n\nrecitation of the data referenced in Exhibit “A”, the Taxing Entities are not entitled\n\nto the legal presumption created by Section 33.47(a) Tax Code. Therefore, there is\n\n                                          8\n\fno evidence to support the trial court’s judgment in favor of the Taxing Entities. As\n\nsuch, the trial court’s judgment should be reversed and rendered.\n\n\n\n                                       ISSUE NO. 2\n\n      Did the trial court err by holding Taxing Entities’ entire alleged tax lien\nenforceable against Hydrogeo, LLC, and First Bank & Trust East Texas when\nTaxing Entities failed to segregate that portion of the lien which was\nunenforceable against Hydrogeo.\n\n\n                 TAXES WERE ASSESSED ON BOTH REAL\n                      AND PERSONAL PROPERTY\n\n\n      It should be pointed out that if this Court of Appeals upholds Appellants’\n\nposition on Issue No. 1, then this issue becomes moot because the only evidence\n\noffered by Taxing Entities attempting to prove their case comes from either the\n\nimproperly admitted Exhibit “A” or from witnesses reading information from\n\nExhibit “A”.\n\n      Appellees concede in their Brief they had no right to foreclose on Hydrogeo’s\n\npersonalty, but argue that no personalty was included in this lawsuit and foreclosure.\n\nAppellees’ Brief at 16-17. Taxing Entities misunderstand how oil and gas properties\n\nare described. A description of the leasehold estate as mentioned in Plaintiffs’\n\nSecond Amended Petition includes oil and gas in place, but also includes the\n\npersonalty necessary to produce, store and transport the oil and gas. C.R. Volume 3\n\n                                          9\n\fExhibit #1. The Black Diamond Exhibit 1 is an assignment describing the leases in\n\nquestion, and states that the lease includes “all tangible personalty, property,\n\nequipment, …” Id.\n\n      As stated in a 1997 Texas Attorney General Opinion, “irrespective of whether\n\nproduction equipment is real or personal property it must be appraised separately\n\nfrom its corresponding mineral leasehold interest. Opinion No. DM-438, May 2,\n\n1997. As the Opinion also recognizes, the classification of property as real or\n\npersonal is material to such matters as the statute of limitations because the statute\n\ntreats real and personal property differently. Texas Tax Code Annotated §33.05\n\n(Vernon 1992).\n\n      Contrary to their Brief, Taxing Entities did appraise and tax at least some of\n\nthe personal property existing on the leases made the basis of this lawsuit. According\n\nto its 2011 Tax Statement (C.R. Vol. 3, Exhibit HB-10), the I.E. Robinson Lease is\n\nappraised at $340,070. A review of C.R. Vol. 1, page 137, which is Pritchard and\n\nAbbott’s appraisal sheet for the year 2011 on the I.E. Robinson Lease, the appraised\n\nvalue for the leasehold shows a specific amount credited to “equipment value”,\n\nwhich constitutes a part of the $340,070 total appraised value. In other words, at\n\nleast a portion of the appraised value upon which the taxes were rendered on the I.E.\n\nRobinson Lease, and upon which the Taxing Entities rely for their tax lien, comes\n\nfrom the personalty.\n\n                                         10\n\f      While the actual appraised amount for the equipment is not determinative, it\n\nis evidence in the record disputing Taxing Entities’ claim that they did not tax or\n\nforeclose on Hydrogeo’s personalty. Assuming a portion of the alleged tax lien\n\nconsisted of taxes for personalty, it was incumbent on Taxing Entities to segregate\n\nthat portion of the alleged lien that was unenforceable. Since they made no attempt\n\nto distinguish between the enforceable part and the unenforceable part, the trial court\n\nhad no evidence to support a judgment allowing foreclosure of the entire tax lien.\n\n      In our case, Hydrogeo, because of the undisputed evidence offered at trial, is\n\nexempt from having any lien foreclosed on its personalty. Tex. Tax Code Ann.\n\n§32.03, (Vernon 1992). Since Hydrogeo filed a verified denial contesting ownership\n\nof the property during the applicable years in question and questioning the\n\nsufficiency of the lien on the property, both real and personal, the burden of proof to\n\nplead and prove all the elements of Taxing Entities’ claims shifted to them.\n\n      For the reasons shown in Appellants’ Brief, Taxing Entities were required to\n\nprove how much of their underlying tax lien was enforceable. Since the amount of\n\nthe debt was not proved, the underlying lien which was supported by the debt failed\n\nalso. The burden of proof belonged to Taxing Entities as plaintiffs and they failed to\n\ncarry the burden. Thus, it was error for the trial court to hold that the entire tax lien\n\nwas enforceable.\n\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\f                                 CONCLUSION\n\n      As shown herein, the one piece of evidence offered by Taxing Entities was\n\nimproperly admitted because it had not been provided to opponents prior to trial and\n\nbecause no effort was made by Taxing Entities to prove good cause allowing its\n\nadmission. By definition, as the one document proffered by Taxing Entities, the trial\n\ncourt’s error was harmful. The only document relied upon by Taxing Entities was\n\nimproperly admitted.\n\n      Even if it should have had been admitted, Exhibit “A” failed to segregate the\n\namount of taxes assessed for personalty. Segregating the portion of taxes assessed\n\nfor personalty was essential because the amount of the tax lien was unenforceable\n\nagainst a buyer in the ordinary course of business, such as Hydrogeo. The evidence\n\ncannot support Taxing Entities’ desire to foreclose on the entire claimed lien on the\n\ntwo oil and gas leases in question. The trial court’s judgment therefore should be\n\nreversed and rendered.\n\n\n                                     PRAYER\n\n      Wherefore premises considered, the Court should reverse the trial court’s\n\njudgment, and render judgment in favor of Appellants Hydrogeo, LLC and First\n\nBank and Trust East Texas and hold that the Taxing Entities take nothing against\n\nAppellants.\n\n\n                                         12\n\f                                      Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                        /s/ J.

They also acknowledge the plain language of the Rule requires\n\nexclusion, but nevertheless they argue the trial court’s admission of Exhibit “A” was\n\nproper because there was good cause or because its admission did not cause unfair\n\nsurprise to Hydrogeo. Appellees’ Brief at 8-10.\n\n      Contrary to Taxing Entities’ statements to the trial court and in their Brief,\n\nExhibit “A” did not consist only of updated tax statements of previously produced\n\ndocuments. Exhibit “A” contains seven pages, two of which (p. 4 and 7) were never\n\nproduced by Taxing Entities. Significantly, those two pages were emphasized by\n\nTaxing Entities during the trial, and in Appellee’s Brief at p.15. Because at least a\n\nportion of the documents was never produced, and because Taxing Entities’\n                                         1\n\fintentional withholding of the applicable documents caused Appellants to be at a\n\ndisadvantage during trial, Taxing Entities are unable to carry their burden of proving\n\na lack of unfair surprise.\n\n      Along those same lines, Taxing Entities wholly fail to show good cause for\n\ntheir refusal to supply the documents prior to trial. In order to prevail on this\n\nexception, they must show in the record some legitimate reason explaining their\n\nfailure to comply with Rule 193.6. Since Exhibit “A” shows Appellees had these\n\ndocuments in their possession seventeen days prior to trial, but still chose not to\n\nproduce them, good cause does not exist. The improperly admitted Exhibit “A”\n\nconstitutes the only evidence offered by Taxing Entities at trial. Without it, their\n\nclaims must fail as a matter of law. The trial court’s decision to admit this document\n\nin contravention of Rule 193.6 caused it to render an improper judgment, which\n\nshould be reversed and rendered.\n\n      Regarding Issue Number 2, Appellees apparently concede they had no right\n\nto foreclose Hydrogeo’s personalty, but argue that since the Judgment forecloses on\n\nonly real property, Hydrogeo’s arguments are neither “relevant nor applicable”.\n\nBrief p. 17. Hydrogeo has shown that Taxing Entities are required to tax the\n\npersonalty and realty separately, and in this case, should have segregated the portion\n\nof the alleged tax lien which was unenforceable. Contrary to Taxing Entities’\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\frepresentations, they did tax some of Hydrogeo’s personalty, at least according to\n\ntheir own records.\n\n      Since at least a portion of the foreclosed tax lien originates from taxes on\n\nHydrogeo’s     personalty,   which     apparently    Appellees     acknowledge     was\n\nunenforceable, the trial court was required to segregate that portion of the lien from\n\nthe realty. Taxing Entities offered no evidence allowing the trial court to segregate\n\nthe lien. The trial court’s decision to render the entire lien enforceable was error.\n\n                                    ARGUMENT\n\n                                     ISSUE NO. 1\n\n      Did the trial court commit reversible error by admitting Plaintiffs’\nExhibit “A” into evidence when the document had not been timely produced\nprior to trial, and when Taxing Entities failed to show good cause for its failure\nto timely supplement discovery responses.\n\n\n      Appellees miss the point of this issue. Part of the disagreement arises from\n\nTaxing Entities’ misunderstanding of their violation of Rule 193.6. Hydrogeo’s\n\ndiscovery request was not a request for disclosure as referenced in Appellees’ Brief\n\nand as dealt with in the case relied upon by Appellees. Hydrogeo sent a request for\n\nproduction of documents specifically asking for copies of “each and every tangible\n\npiece of evidence you plan to use at the trial of this cause”. 2 R.R. p. 8, line 21 – p.\n\n9, line 1. A request for disclosure seeks information, not documents. A request for\n\nproduction seeks specific documents, in this case all documents to be used as\n\n                                           3\n\fevidence at trial. Taxing Entities’ failure to provide these documents negatively\n\nimpacted Hydrogeo’s trial preparation and presentation. As stated in Rule 193.1,\n\n“when responding to written discovery, a party must make a complete response,\n\nbased on all information reasonably available to the responding party.”\n\n       Taxing Entities, without question failed to comply with Rule 193.1 in that they\n\ndid not produce the evidence they intended to offer at trial. They admit as much in\n\ntheir Brief. Additionally, Taxing Entities failed to offer any basis for good cause\n\nexplaining why the documents in question were not produced prior to trial, instead\n\nfocusing primarily on the defense of lack of unfair surprise. As a reminder, the\n\nburden of establishing lack of unfair surprise rests with Appellees, as the party\n\noffering the discovery, and such proof must be supported by the record. Rule 193.6\n\n(b).\n\n       Taxing Entities use as their foundational defense the case of Williams vs.\n\nCounty of Dallas </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1871004\"><a href=\"/opinion/1871004/williams-v-county-of-dallas/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 33 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2006 pet den’d), a case\n\ndistinguishable on several important grounds. First, Williams dealt with a request\n\nfor disclosure which only asks for information. Our request required production of\n\nall evidence you intend to offer at trial. Hydrogeo had no way to know ahead of\n\ntime what documents Appellees planned to introduce as evidence, or whether\n\nAppellees planned to use any, all or none of the documents previously produced in\n\ndiscovery. The purpose of generating a request for production such as the one at\n\n                                          4\n\fissue here is to determine what documents will be considered by the Court and to\n\nproperly prepare responses, cross examination and rebuttal, if needed, of any\n\ndocuments presented.       By intentionally withholding the requested documents,\n\nAppellees sought, and eventually were allowed, an unfair advantage.\n\n      Also, in the Williams case, the trial court conducted an examination\n\ncomparing the information offered as evidence with the information previously\n\nproduced by the offering party. In our case, the trial court never conducted such an\n\nexamination.\n\n      By its nature, a failure to produce a document introduced at trial constitutes\n\nsome surprise.     Appellees argue that their discovery responses, which were\n\nimproperly filed with the district clerk, prevent Hydrogeo from being surprised by\n\nthe Exhibit “A” which was offered into evidence. Appellees’ Brief at 10-12. There\n\nis no evidence in the record that the trial court had access to, or consulted the district\n\nclerk’s file prior to admitting Exhibit “A”.\n\n      Moreover, at least two of the documents, pages 4 and 7 of Exhibit “A”, were\n\nnever produced in discovery or as an exhibit to pleadings. Significantly, those two\n\ndocuments constitute the foundation of Appellees’ argument on appeal, as well as\n\nduring the testimony of Carol Taylor, Wood County Tax Assessor. Appellees’ Brief\n\nat 15 and R.R. Volume 2, p. 80, line 4-11 and p.85, line 24 - P. 86, line 6. These two\n\ndocuments are significant, in that they were used by Taxing Entities to connect\n\n                                            5\n\fHydrogeo as the record owner of the specific leases in question and as the owner of\n\nspecific percentages of the interest involved for the years 2009 - 2011. Appellees’\n\nBrief at 15 and R.R. Volume 2, p. 83, line 21-p. 84, line 5. But for the trial court’s\n\nimproper decision to admit pages 4 and 7 of Exhibit “A”, Taxing Entities had no\n\ndocumentation showing Hydrogeo as the subsequent owner of specific lease I.D.\n\nnumber N366491 and I.D. number N366493. Since ownership of the lease was a\n\ncontested issue, to allow this improper evidence to be admitted led to an improper\n\njudgment.    Even if Hydrogeo’s subsequent testimony acknowledged current\n\nownership, there was no connection of Hydrogeo to the specific tax ID numbers.\n\nAppellees would not have been successful without relying on the rebuttable\n\npresumption created by the introduction of Exhibit “A”.\n\n      As stated in Lopez vs. La Madeleine of Texas, Inc., 200 S.W.3d. 854, (Tex\n\nApp. —Dallas 2006, no pet.), Rule 193.6 is mandatory and the penalty is automatic,\n\nabsent a showing of good cause and/or unfair surprise. Rule 193.6 relates to the\n\ndiscovery of evidence, not the issues. Its principle purpose is to protect a party from\n\nsurprise, whether or not such evidence relates to an issue both parties knew existed\n\nin the case. As the Court stated, “we are concerned not only with whether or not\n\n[Lopez] should have prevailed, but also the effect of opponents’ introduction of the\n\nundisclosed evidence on his preparation for trial and presentation of his case, both\n\nof which were undeniably impacted by the trial court’s decision to admit the\n\n                                          6\n\fevidence.” Id. The Lopez court further states that it is not necessary for the\n\ncomplaining party to prove that “but for” the exclusion of the evidence, a different\n\njudgment would necessarily have resulted. They are only required to show that the\n\nexclusion of evidence probably resulted in the rendition of an improper judgment.\n\nIn short, Appellees failed to show lack of unfair surprise.\n\n                       GOOD CAUSE DOES NOT EXIST\n\n      Appellees also argue there is an “implied” finding of good cause, despite the\n\nplain wording of Rule 193.6 which states that a finding of good cause must be\n\n(explicitly) supported by the record. Appellees’ Brief at 10-12. The Supreme Court\n\nin Alvarado v. Farah Mfg. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1766885\"><a href=\"/opinion/1766885/alvarado-v-farah-mfg-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">830</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">911</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 914 (Tex. 1992), states “the good\n\ncause exception permits the trial court to excuse a failure to comply with discovery\n\nin difficult or impossible circumstances” (emphasis added). The Rule as\n\ninterpreted by the Supreme Court requires Taxing Entities to offer evidence as to\n\nwhy complying with the Rule was difficult or impossible. A review of Exhibit “A”\n\nshows the documents were generated and printed on “August 22, 2014 at 11:43\n\na.m.”. Appendix A. Since the trial did not take place until September 8th, the\n\ndocuments themselves prove they existed and were in the Taxing Entities’\n\npossession seventeen days prior to trial. Therefore any attempt to show good cause\n\nrings hollow.\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f           COURT’S ERROR CAUSED IMPROPER JUDGMENT\n\n      Pursuant to Rule 44.4, Texas Rules of Appellant Procedure, no judgment may\n\nbe reversed on appeal unless the error complained of probably caused rendition of\n\nan improper judgment.       Appellee argues there was testimony to support the\n\nJudgment, even if Exhibit “A” had not been admitted. Appellees’ Brief at 15.\n\nContrary to Appellees’ argument, all of the testimony cited was simply the tax\n\nassessor reading Exhibit “A” itself verbatim. R.R. Volume 2, p. 79, line 8 – 13; p.\n\n80, line 4-11; and p. 85, line 24-p.86, line 6. Simply stated, Taxing Entities must\n\nstand or fall on the information and alleged presumption represented by the\n\ndocuments referred to as Exhibit “A”. If they were improperly admitted, their case\n\nfails due to a lack of any evidence to support the trial court’s judgment.\n\n      The test is whether the trial court acted without reference to any guiding rules\n\nor principals, or arbitrarily or unreasonably. Perry Homes v. Cull, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894995\"><a href=\"/opinion/894995/perry-homes-v-cull/\"><span class=\"volume\">258</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n602 (Tex. 2008). As stated by the Supreme Court in Alvarado, Rule 193.6 is\n\nmandatory and the trial court has no discretion to admit testimony excluded by the\n\nRule without a showing of good cause. Id. Since there was no other admissible\n\nevidence offered at trial by Taxing Entities, and the Exhibit “A” described herein\n\nshould not have been admitted, and the testimony of Ms. Taylor was simply\n\nrecitation of the data referenced in Exhibit “A”, the Taxing Entities are not entitled\n\nto the legal presumption created by Section 33.47(a) Tax Code. Therefore, there is\n\n                                          8\n\fno evidence to support the trial court’s judgment in favor of the Taxing Entities. As\n\nsuch, the trial court’s judgment should be reversed and rendered.\n\n\n\n                                       ISSUE NO. 2\n\n      Did the trial court err by holding Taxing Entities’ entire alleged tax lien\nenforceable against Hydrogeo, LLC, and First Bank & Trust East Texas when\nTaxing Entities failed to segregate that portion of the lien which was\nunenforceable against Hydrogeo.\n\n\n                 TAXES WERE ASSESSED ON BOTH REAL\n                      AND PERSONAL PROPERTY\n\n\n      It should be pointed out that if this Court of Appeals upholds Appellants’\n\nposition on Issue No. 1, then this issue becomes moot because the only evidence\n\noffered by Taxing Entities attempting to prove their case comes from either the\n\nimproperly admitted Exhibit “A” or from witnesses reading information from\n\nExhibit “A”.\n\n      Appellees concede in their Brief they had no right to foreclose on Hydrogeo’s\n\npersonalty, but argue that no personalty was included in this lawsuit and foreclosure.\n\nAppellees’ Brief at 16-17. Taxing Entities misunderstand how oil and gas properties\n\nare described. A description of the leasehold estate as mentioned in Plaintiffs’\n\nSecond Amended Petition includes oil and gas in place, but also includes the\n\npersonalty necessary to produce, store and transport the oil and gas. C.R. Volume 3\n\n                                          9\n\fExhibit #1. The Black Diamond Exhibit 1 is an assignment describing the leases in\n\nquestion, and states that the lease includes “all tangible personalty, property,\n\nequipment, …” Id.\n\n      As stated in a 1997 Texas Attorney General Opinion, “irrespective of whether\n\nproduction equipment is real or personal property it must be appraised separately\n\nfrom its corresponding mineral leasehold interest. Opinion No. DM-438, May 2,\n\n1997. As the Opinion also recognizes, the classification of property as real or\n\npersonal is material to such matters as the statute of limitations because the statute\n\ntreats real and personal property differently. Texas Tax Code Annotated §33.05\n\n(Vernon 1992).\n\n      Contrary to their Brief, Taxing Entities did appraise and tax at least some of\n\nthe personal property existing on the leases made the basis of this lawsuit. According\n\nto its 2011 Tax Statement (C.R. Vol. 3, Exhibit HB-10), the I.E. Robinson Lease is\n\nappraised at $340,070. A review of C.R. Vol. 1, page 137, which is Pritchard and\n\nAbbott’s appraisal sheet for the year 2011 on the I.E. Robinson Lease, the appraised\n\nvalue for the leasehold shows a specific amount credited to “equipment value”,\n\nwhich constitutes a part of the $340,070 total appraised value. In other words, at\n\nleast a portion of the appraised value upon which the taxes were rendered on the I.E.\n\nRobinson Lease, and upon which the Taxing Entities rely for their tax lien, comes\n\nfrom the personalty.\n\n                                         10\n\f      While the actual appraised amount for the equipment is not determinative, it\n\nis evidence in the record disputing Taxing Entities’ claim that they did not tax or\n\nforeclose on Hydrogeo’s personalty. Assuming a portion of the alleged tax lien\n\nconsisted of taxes for personalty, it was incumbent on Taxing Entities to segregate\n\nthat portion of the alleged lien that was unenforceable. Since they made no attempt\n\nto distinguish between the enforceable part and the unenforceable part, the trial court\n\nhad no evidence to support a judgment allowing foreclosure of the entire tax lien.\n\n      In our case, Hydrogeo, because of the undisputed evidence offered at trial, is\n\nexempt from having any lien foreclosed on its personalty. Tex. Tax Code Ann.\n\n§32.03, (Vernon 1992). Since Hydrogeo filed a verified denial contesting ownership\n\nof the property during the applicable years in question and questioning the\n\nsufficiency of the lien on the property, both real and personal, the burden of proof to\n\nplead and prove all the elements of Taxing Entities’ claims shifted to them.\n\n      For the reasons shown in Appellants’ Brief, Taxing Entities were required to\n\nprove how much of their underlying tax lien was enforceable. Since the amount of\n\nthe debt was not proved, the underlying lien which was supported by the debt failed\n\nalso. The burden of proof belonged to Taxing Entities as plaintiffs and they failed to\n\ncarry the burden. Thus, it was error for the trial court to hold that the entire tax lien\n\nwas enforceable.\n\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\f                                 CONCLUSION\n\n      As shown herein, the one piece of evidence offered by Taxing Entities was\n\nimproperly admitted because it had not been provided to opponents prior to trial and\n\nbecause no effort was made by Taxing Entities to prove good cause allowing its\n\nadmission. By definition, as the one document proffered by Taxing Entities, the trial\n\ncourt’s error was harmful. The only document relied upon by Taxing Entities was\n\nimproperly admitted.\n\n      Even if it should have had been admitted, Exhibit “A” failed to segregate the\n\namount of taxes assessed for personalty. Segregating the portion of taxes assessed\n\nfor personalty was essential because the amount of the tax lien was unenforceable\n\nagainst a buyer in the ordinary course of business, such as Hydrogeo. The evidence\n\ncannot support Taxing Entities’ desire to foreclose on the entire claimed lien on the\n\ntwo oil and gas leases in question. The trial court’s judgment therefore should be\n\nreversed and rendered.\n\n\n                                     PRAYER\n\n      Wherefore premises considered, the Court should reverse the trial court’s\n\njudgment, and render judgment in favor of Appellants Hydrogeo, LLC and First\n\nBank and Trust East Texas and hold that the Taxing Entities take nothing against\n\nAppellants.\n\n\n                                         12\n\f                                      Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                        /s/ J.
