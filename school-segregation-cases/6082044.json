Hoboken claims that the Commissioner failed to\n\nconsider the charter school's alleged segregative and funding\n\nimpact on the district and improperly declined to hold a hearing,\n\nconduct interviews, or gather more facts concerning the charter\n\nschool's policies.     Because neither the methodology used by the\n\nCommissioner   nor   his   decision   were   arbitrary,   capricious,   or\n\nunreasonable, we affirm.\n\n     On October 15, 2013, HoLa submitted a charter renewal and\n\nexpansion application to the Commissioner and Hoboken. The Hoboken\n\n\n                                      2                          A-3690-14T3\n\fSuperintendent    fully    supported        Hola's   charter    renewal,       but\n\nobjected to its expansion.         On March 5, 2014, Evo Popoff, the\n\nChief Innovation Officer at the Department of Education (the\n\nDepartment), acting on the Commissioner's behalf, renewed HoLa's\n\ncharter for five years, through June 30, 2019.                    Popoff also\n\npermitted the elementary school to add a seventh-grade class for\n\nthe 2016-2017 school year and an eighth-grade class for the 2018-\n\n2019 school year.\n\n     Hoboken appealed, and after our remand to the Commissioner\n\nupon application of the Department, and after the parties submitted\n\nadditional    materials,   the    Commissioner       again     granted     HoLa's\n\nrenewal and expansion application on March 20, 2015.               We denied a\n\nstay.\n\n     The City of Hoboken has a public school system for students\n\nin grades kindergarten (K) through 12 consisting of four public\n\nschools: Brandt, Calabro, Connors and Wallace.               It also includes\n\nthree charter schools including HoLa, and four private, tuition-\n\nbased K-8 schools.\n\n     According to HoLa, the original intent of its founders was\n\nto implement a dual-language program (Spanish and English) at\n\nHoboken's    Connors   school    (the   district's    most     segregated      and\n\npoorest school), but Hoboken rejected the plan.              HoLa then applied\n\nfor and was granted a charter to operate a dual-language school\n\n\n                                        3                                A-3690-14T3\n\fbeginning in September 2010, starting with grades K-2 and expanding\n\neach year until HoLa encompassed grades K-6.           HoLa is located in\n\na low-income section of Hoboken, close to the Connors school.\n\n     Students are admitted to HoLa through a lottery with no\n\ninterviews.    No demographic data is collected until students are\n\nregistered.    In order to represent a cross section of the Hoboken\n\ncommunity, HoLa holds open houses and tours and advertises in\n\nlocal publications.      It also partners with local organizations to\n\nrecruit on-site.      Dates for the open houses, tours and events, as\n\nwell as the lottery, are posted on the school's website and are\n\nprinted on flyers \"distributed throughout the city.\"            In addition,\n\napplications    and    brochures   are   mailed   to    every    low-income\n\nhousehold each year prior to the lottery.              HoLa's parents and\n\nteachers also canvass subsidized and public housing and help\n\ncomplete applications on the spot.\n\n     Parents may enroll children in the lottery online, in person,\n\nor by a phone call to the school.        HoLa has a sibling preference,\n\nso that if a child is enrolled in HoLa, that child's younger\n\nsibling will have priority over other lottery applicants.                   On\n\nDecember 23, 2014, HoLa submitted a request to the Commissioner\n\nto include a low-income preference in its lottery.1\n\n\n\n\n1\n  This request was granted in December 2015 after the record in\nthis case closed.\n                                    4                               A-3690-14T3\n\f       Initially, in 2013, Popoff conducted \"a comprehensive review\"\n\nof   HoLa,     \"including    the   evaluation      of     the   school's      renewal\n\napplication,      annual     reports,     student        performance     on     state\n\nassessments,      site   visit     results,      public    comments,     and    other\n\ninformation.\" Popoff found that HoLa was \"providing a high-quality\n\neducation to its students.\"          In the 2012-2013 school year, 82% of\n\nHoLa's students were at least proficient in Language Arts, while\n\n91% were at least proficient in math.              By comparison, only 50% of\n\nHoboken's      traditional    public      school    students      were   at     least\n\nproficient in Language Arts and 52% were at least proficient in\n\nmath.\n\n       After the remand, the parties submitted more information,\n\nincluding census and student enrollment data.                   According to 2010\n\nU.S. Census data, Hoboken's under-seventeen population was 57%\n\nwhite, 26% Hispanic, and 16% \"other\" reflecting a significant\n\nincrease in the percentage of white children from the 2000 Census\n\ndata, which showed Hoboken's under-seventeen population as 39%\n\nwhite, 46% Hispanic, and 15% \"other.\"                   In the 2009-2010 school\n\nyear    (the    year     before    HoLa       started     operating),    Hoboken's\n\ntraditional public school student population was 22% white, 59%\n\nHispanic, 15% black, and 4% Asian.              By the 2013-2014 school year,\n\nfour years after HoLa began, Hoboken's traditional public school\n\nstudent population had increased its percentage of white students\n\n\n                                          5                                A-3690-14T3\n\ffrom 22% to 27%.\n\n       The   Commissioner       considered      the     racial   breakdown    of   the\n\nstudents in the public and charter schools for 2012-2013 and 2013-\n\n2014. Between these school years, the percentage of white students\n\nat HoLa rose from 60.6% to 63%, while Connors rose from only 3.9%\n\nwhite students to 4%.         Brandt rose from 61.5% to 72%, and Wallace\n\nrose from 32.6% to 43%.          The final public school, Calabro, dipped\n\nfrom 34.6% to 32%.         As can be seen by these statistics, minority\n\nstudents are heavily concentrated at Connors, where in both years\n\nthey made up approximately 95% of the student population.                          The\n\npercentage      of   students    receiving       free    or   reduced-price     lunch\n\ndecreased for all four Hoboken public elementary schools from\n\n2010-2011 to 2013-2014, although at Connors 88% of the students\n\nstill received a lunch subsidy in 2013-2014.\n\n       In    addition   to   considering        the   submitted    materials,      the\n\nOffice of Charter Schools conducted its own review of data focusing\n\non race and ethnicity to determine whether HoLa was having a\n\nsegregative effect on the Hoboken Public School District, stating:\n\n\"After the Department's analysis of publically available student\n\nenrollment data, census data, and documentation submitted by the\n\nparties, it has been determined that HoLa does [not] and will not\n\nhave   a     segregative     effect   on       [Hoboken].\"       The   Commissioner\n\nexplained:\n\n\n                                           6                                 A-3690-14T3\n\f          [A]lthough HoLa enrolls a higher percentage\n          of White students, and a smaller percentage\n          of Black and Hispanic students than [Hoboken],\n          the percentage of White students attending\n          [Hoboken] has actually increased since HoLa\n          opened in 2010 with the percentage of Hispanic\n          students decreasing in that same period. The\n          percentage of Black students in [Hoboken] has\n          stayed fairly constant since 2010.         The\n          increase in percentage of [Hoboken's] White\n          students since 2010, along with the decrease\n          in Hispanic students, and the lack of changes\n          to the percentage of Black students indicates\n          that HoLa's enrollment has not had a\n          segregative effect on [Hoboken]. Instead, the\n          data points towards an overall population\n          shift in the last ten years in the City of\n          Hoboken, which began before the opening of\n          HoLa Charter School.\n\n     Hoboken argues that in granting the expansion of HoLa's\n\ncharter to include seventh and eighth grades, the Commissioner:\n\n1) failed to consider HoLa's alleged racially and economically\n\nsegregative effect; 2) failed to consider the funding impact to\n\nstudents affected by poverty and special needs; and 3) failed to\n\nconduct interviews, gather facts, or hold a hearing to consider\n\nHoLa's policies and practices.\n\n     Our review of the Commissioner's decision is limited.

Englewood, supra, 164 N.J. at 329.\n\n     Hoboken complains of two problems with the data: 1) pre-K\n\ndata was improperly included in the Department's reports for 2013-\n\n2014 and 2) the Commissioner used census data inclusive of the\n\nentire Hoboken population under age seventeen instead of data for\n\nonly the school-age population.        Hoboken argues that because the\n\n2013-2014 Department's report erroneously included data for pre-K\n\nstudents in the district and HoLa did not enroll pre-K students,\n\nthe report was not an accurate reflection of Hoboken's population.\n\nThe Department data included data from the Brandt school, which\n\nserved only pre-K and K students, and which enrolled a higher\n\npercentage of white students than the other public schools (62%\n\nwhite in 2012-2013 and 72% white in 2013-2014).\n\n     It is true that HoLa did not admit pre-K students and the\n\nDepartment's   statistics   for   2013-14    included   data   for   pre-K\n\nstudents. However, the Department's 2012-2013 data did not include\n\nthe pre-K data, and those numbers were relied upon to the same\n\n\n                                  10                             A-3690-14T3\n\fextent as the 2013-2014 numbers.       Moreover, the inclusion of the\n\npre-K data did not skew the statistics; although the pre-K data\n\nincluded Brandt, a predominately white school in the district,\n\nthose same statistics also included data on Wallace and Connors,\n\nschools that were predominately minority, and which also added\n\npre-K in the 2013-2014 school year.       Thus, contrary to Hoboken's\n\nsuggestion, the inclusion of Brandt did not skew the statistics.\n\nAnd, although HoLa did not offer pre-K, \"trends in the student\n\npopulation\" are \"valid factors\" to be considered when determining\n\nwhether an action will have a segregative impact.        In re Petition\n\nfor Authorization to Conduct a Referendum on the Withdrawal of N.\n\nHaledon Sch. Dist. from the Passaic Cty. Manchester Reg'l High\n\nSch. Dist., 363 N.J. Super. 130, 142 (App. Div. 2003) (N. Haledon\n\nI), aff'd as mod., 181 N.J. 161 (2004).        The Commissioner properly\n\nconsidered the pre-K data because it provided solid evidence of\n\nthe trends in the student population.\n\n     Hoboken   also   complains   that   the    Commissioner   erred   in\n\nconsidering census information concerning all of the children\n\nunder age seventeen in Hoboken and not just those of school age.\n\nIt argues this was error because: 1) the statute requires a review\n\nof the community's \"school age\" population; 2) the under-five age\n\ngroup is overrepresented in the Hoboken population; and 3) the\n\nrelevant comparison is that of the student population in the\n\n\n                                  11                            A-3690-14T3\n\fdistrict, not the student population of Hoboken.\n\n      N.J.S.A.   18A:36A-8(e)    addresses       enrollment   preferences,\n\nstating: \"The admission policy of the charter school shall, to the\n\nmaximum extent practicable, seek the enrollment of a cross section\n\nof the community's school age population, including racial and\n\nacademic factors.\"      The racial make-up of students expected to\n\nenroll in school in the next four years is a trend that the\n\nCommissioner should consider. N. Haledon I, supra, 363 N.J. Super.\n\nat 142.\n\n      Hoboken argues that the relevant statistics were those that\n\ncompared HoLa's student population to the student population of\n\nthe traditional public school system, not to the population of\n\nthose under age seventeen.      To support its position, it cites to\n\nEnglewood, which states the Commissioner \"must consider the impact\n\nthat the movement of pupils to a charter school would have on the\n\ndistrict of residence\" and it is the Commissioner's \"obligation\n\nto oversee the promotion of racial balance in our public schools\n\nto   ensure   that   public   school    pupils    are   not   subjected   to\n\nsegregation.\"    Englewood, supra, 164 N.J. at 328 (emphasis added).\n\nHoboken also cites to N.J.A.C. 6A:11-2.2(c) that states in part\n\nthat \"the Commissioner shall assess the student composition of a\n\ncharter school and the segregative effect that the loss of the\n\nstudents may have on its district of residence.\"\n\n\n                                   12                              A-3690-14T3\n\f     N.J.S.A.   18A:36A-8(e),     however,    states   that   a     charter\n\nschool's admission policy must seek to enroll \"a cross section of\n\nthe community's school age population.\"        (Emphasis added).        This\n\nindicates that the entire community, not just the students enrolled\n\nin   the   public   schools,    must   be    considered.      Any     other\n\ninterpretation would exclude potential students who had already\n\nelected not to attend public schools, but who were part of the\n\npopulation eligible to attend the public schools.                 A simple\n\ncomparison between the charter schools and the traditional public\n\nschools is not necessarily representative of the demographics:\n\nbased on 2013-2014 data, 65% of Hoboken's school-age population\n\nwas white, but only 27% of Hoboken's students were white.               This\n\nwas largely the result of four private K-8 schools that enrolled\n\nthousands of Hoboken's students.       Consequently, the analysis is\n\ncomplicated.    It is not fair to HoLa to refuse to recognize the\n\nimpact of the private schools on overall school enrollment in\n\nHoboken, as HoLa has no control over private school enrollment.\n\nHoboken presents no data of its own to support its positions.            The\n\nCommissioner did not act arbitrarily in considering the data\n\npresented.\n\n     Assuming that the data the Commissioner relied on was correct,\n\nHoboken maintains that the Commissioner's legal interpretation of\n\nthat data was wrong in that \"the lack of a documented increase in\n\n\n                                  13                               A-3690-14T3\n\fHoLa's segregative impact on Hoboken's school-aged children does\n\nnot negate the existence of the segregative impact.\"                     We have\n\nstated:\n\n            [A] Charter School should not be faulted for\n            developing an attractive educational program.\n            Assuming the school's enrollment practices\n            remain color blind, random, and open to all\n            students in the community, the parents of age\n            eligible students will decide whether or not\n            to attempt to enroll their child in the\n            Charter School and any racial/ethnic imbalance\n            cannot be attributed solely to the school. To\n            close   this  school    would    undermine   the\n            Legislature's     policy      of      \"promoting\n            comprehensive    educational       reform\"    by\n            fostering the development of charter schools.\n\n            [In re Red Bank Charter Sch., supra, 367 N.J.\n            Super. at 478 (quoting N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-2).]\n\n     In    Red   Bank,    as    here,   a    disparity   existed    between    the\n\nenrollment of minority students in the charter school and the\n\ntraditional public schools.             Id. at 473-74.     We were concerned\n\nthat after initial enrollment, the charter school in Red Bank\n\ndecreased the percentage of minority students as the students\n\nprogressed toward graduation, with the argument being made that\n\nthe charter school frequently returned minority students with poor\n\nacademic    records      to    the   public    schools    just     in   time   for\n\nstandardized testing.          Id. at 479.    We determined that the charter\n\nschool's \"manner of operation of the school after its color-blind\n\nlottery, warrants closer scrutiny to determine whether some of the\n\nschool's practices may be worsening the existing racial/ethnic\n\n                                        14                               A-3690-14T3\n\fimbalance in the district\" and remanded to the Commissioner to\n\ndetermine \"whether remedial action is warranted.\"                              Id. at 480,\n\n482. Despite the stark disparity in Red Bank, however, we approved\n\nthe renewal and expansion of the charter school.                               Id. at 486.\n\nUnlike in Red Bank, there are no allegations that HoLa's practices\n\nafter    the     enrollment       of     students      by    an    impartial         lottery\n\nexacerbated the racial or ethnic balance.\n\n       In addition to the arguments Hoboken makes in the context of\n\nthe charter school statutory scheme, it also argues that the\n\nCommissioner      violated       his     duty   to     enforce     the       \"Thorough     and\n\nEfficient Education\" clause of the New Jersey Constitution when\n\nhe   failed    to      remedy    de    facto     segregation       caused       by    HoLa's\n\nexpansion.        In    the     \"Education      Clause\"      or    the       \"Thorough     and\n\nEfficient Provision,\" the New Jersey Constitution provides:                               \"The\n\nLegislature shall provide for the maintenance and support of a\n\nthorough and efficient system of free public schools for the\n\ninstruction of all the children in the State between the ages of\n\nfive and eighteen years.\"              N.J.

Dist.,    181    N.J.     161,    173    n.3    (2004)         (N.   Haledon     II).\n\n\"[R]acial      imbalance        resulting       from    de   facto       segregation         is\n\ninimical    to    the    constitutional          guarantee        of    a    thorough      and\n\n\n                                           15                                        A-3690-14T3\n\fefficient education.\" Id. at 177. The Commissioner must \"exercise\n\nbroadly    his    statutory    powers    when    confronting      segregation,\n\nwhatever the cause.\"     Englewood, supra, 164 N.J. at 324.             However,\n\nit is \"not really possible to establish a precise point when a\n\nthorough    and    efficient    education       is   threatened    by    racial\n\nimbalance.\"      N. Haledon II, supra, 181 N.J. at 183.\n\n     In North Haledon, the Borough of North Haledon sought a\n\nreferendum to determine whether it should be allowed to withdraw\n\nfrom the Passaic County Manchester Regional High School District.\n\nId. at 164.      Although the Board of Review granted the withdrawal,\n\nseveral interested parties objected arguing that the Board failed\n\nto assess the impact of the withdrawal on the racial makeup of the\n\nhigh school, given the white student population would decrease by\n\nnine percent, and that the percentage of minorities would continue\n\nto rise and the white population would continue to decline due to\n\npopulation trends in the sending towns.              Id. at 164, 174.         Our\n\nSupreme Court stated:\n\n           Not every action that reduces the percentage\n           of white students necessarily implicates the\n           State's policy against segregation in the\n           public schools. . . . What we do know is that\n           in   this   case,   demographic   trends   are\n           contributing to a steady decrease in the\n           number of white students attending Manchester\n           Regional, and that North Haledon's withdrawal\n           will accelerate this trend. Rather than using\n           the demographic trend as an excuse for\n           approving North Haledon's petition, the Board\n           should have considered the ameliorative effect\n\n                                    16                                  A-3690-14T3\n\f            of denying the petition on the racial balance\n            at Manchester Regional.\n\n            [Id. at 183.]\n\n     Hoboken does not, however, show that expanding HoLa will\n\nincrease racial imbalance as it did in North Haledon.               To the\n\ncontrary, the percentage of white students in Hoboken schools\n\nincreased since HoLa opened.\n\n                         II. Economic Segregation\n\n     Hoboken also claims that the Commissioner failed to consider\n\nthe economic disparity between the student populations of HoLa and\n\nthe district.      It points out that while 11% to 16% of HoLa's\n\npopulation qualified for free or reduced-price lunch, Hoboken had\n\nmuch higher levels in some schools.          N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-8 does not\n\nspecifically     address   economic    factors,    instead   requiring   the\n\nadmission policy of a charter school to \"seek the enrollment of a\n\ncross section of the community's population including racial and\n\nacademic factors.\"\n\n     The evidence showed that HoLa's policies are geared toward\n\nadmitting    a   cross     section    of   the    school-aged   population,\n\neconomically as well as racially and ethnically.             HoLa canvassed\n\nand advertised in Hoboken's subsidized housing developments.               On\n\nDecember 23, 2014, HoLa submitted a successful request to the\n\nDepartment to include a low-income preference in its lottery.\n\nHoboken fails to convince us that the facts regarding economically\n\n                                      17                           A-3690-14T3\n\fdisadvantaged students lead to a conclusion that HoLa should not\n\nbe permitted to expand.\n\n                            III. Funding Impact\n\n     Hoboken next argues that the Commissioner's decision was\n\narbitrary and capricious because he failed to consider its January\n\n30, 2015, submission to the court and Hoboken Superintendent Mark\n\nToback's December 13, 2010 letter concerning the funding impact\n\nthat charter schools had on Hoboken's budget, including the number\n\nof special needs students enrolled in HoLa versus Hoboken.\n\n     N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-12(b) provides:\n\n           The school district of residence shall pay\n           directly to the charter school for each\n           student enrolled in the charter school who\n           resides in the district an amount equal to 90%\n           of the sum of the budget year equalization aid\n           per pupil and the prebudget year general fund\n           tax levy per pupil inflated by the CPI rate\n           most recent to the calculation. In addition,\n           the school district of residence shall pay\n           directly to the charter school the security\n           categorical aid attributable to the student\n           and a percentage of the district's special\n           education categorical aid equal to the\n           percentage of the district's special education\n           students enrolled in the charter school, and,\n           if applicable, 100% of preschool education\n           aid. The district of residence shall also pay\n           directly to the charter school any federal\n           funds attributable to the student.\n\n     Toback pointed out that the allocation of funds to the charter\n\nschools located in Hoboken had \"nearly tripled in only a few short\n\nyears\"   and   that   the   pattern   was   not   sustainable   \"given   our\n\n\n                                      18                           A-3690-14T3\n\fenrollment increase at the lower grade levels coupled with a 2%\n\ntax cap.\" He claimed that \"[e]ven with tax increases, the district\n\nmust make cuts to services and programs for our students to support\n\ncharter expansion.\"    He wrote: \"We have four school district\n\nleaders in one square mile, four business administrators, four\n\nseparate payrolls, four separate boards of education and a host\n\nof required services that are duplicated.\"    However, he did not\n\nsubmit specific financial data to support those assertions.\n\n     As to students with special needs, Toback wrote:\n\n          HoLa does enroll a few special needs children,\n          and the other two charters enroll about the\n          same percentage of special needs students as\n          our district. But it must be noted that the\n          charter schools do not enroll students with\n          significant disabilities.    It is the public\n          district that enrolls the most significantly\n          disabled children and pays for private out-\n          of-district placements. This concentrates an\n          expensive undertaking in the public schools,\n          thus raising our per-pupil costs and reducing\n          per-pupil costs in charter schools.\n\nHe further noted, again without district-specific evidence, that\n\nthe existing law gave an \"incentive\" for charter schools to place\n\nspecial needs students in out-of-district placements, which put\n\nthe cost back on the district.\n\n          [I]f the local school district \"demonstrates\n          with some specificity that the constitutional\n          requirements of a thorough and efficient\n          education would be jeopardized by [the\n          district's] loss\" of the funds to be allocated\n          to a charter school, \"the Commissioner is\n          obligated to evaluate carefully the impact\n\n                                 19                        A-3690-14T3\n\f           that loss of funds would have on the ability\n           of the district of residence to deliver a\n           thorough and efficient education.\"\n\n           [In re Proposed Quest Acad., supra, 216 N.J.\n           at 377-78 (quoting Englewood, supra, 164 N.J.\n           at 334-35).]\n\n     \"[U]nsubstantiated, generalized protests\" are insufficient.\n\nEnglewood, supra, 164 N.J. at 336.           \"Renewal of a successful\n\ncharter school will be favored, 'unless reliable information is\n\nput forward to demonstrate that a constitutional violation may\n\noccur.'\"   In re Red Bank Charter Sch., supra, 367 N.J. at 482-83\n\n(quoting Englewood, supra, 164 N.J. at 336).\n\n     \"[T]he Commissioner is entitled to rely on the district of\n\nresidence to come forward with a preliminary showing that the\n\nrequirements of a thorough and efficient education cannot be met.\"\n\nEnglewood, supra, 164 N.J. at 334.       The district \"must be able to\n\nsupport its assertions\" as the Commissioner does not have \"the\n\nburden of canvassing the financial condition of the district of\n\nresidence in order to determine its ability to adjust to the per-\n\npupil   loss   upon   approval   of    the   charter   school   based   on\n\nunsubstantiated, generalized protests.\"        Id. at 336.\n\n     In In re Red Bank Charter Sch., supra, 367 N.J. Super. at\n\n482, the district claimed that the funding of a charter school\n\nwould cause the district's budget to be reduced by $720,000, and\n\nthat it would cause the elimination of four positions, resulting\n\n\n                                  20                             A-3690-14T3\n\fin bigger classes, as well as the elimination of courtesy busing\n\nand reduction of hall monitors, instructional assistants, and\n\ncafeteria monitors.      In spite of these representations, we found\n\nthe \"paucity of specificity\" in the district's claim to be \"fatal.\"\n\nId. at 483.\n\n       Here,   Hoboken   does   not   argue      that    the   financial       losses\n\nsurrounding HoLa's expansion would impede Hoboken's ability to\n\nprovide a thorough and efficient education.                       It mounts only\n\ngeneral,    non-specific   and    unconvincing          attacks   on   the    entire\n\ncharter school scheme and does not separate HoLa's impact from the\n\nimpact of the other two charter schools.\n\n                           IV. Fact-gathering\n\n       In its supplemental submission to the Commissioner after\n\nremand, Hoboken requested that the Commissioner \"conduct further\n\ninterviews, fact gathering, and perhaps hold a hearing to better\n\nassess possible interventions.\"            On appeal, Hoboken argues that\n\nthe Commissioner should have held hearings to consider the effect\n\nHoLa's policies and practices had on segregation before reaching\n\na decision as to HoLa's renewal and expansion application.\n\n       An adjudicatory hearing is not required in every contested\n\nrenewal application case.        In re Proposed Quest Acad., supra, 216\n\nN.J.   at   383.    Hoboken     raised     the   issues     of    HoLa's     sibling\n\npreference, recruiting practices, fundraising practices, opt-in\n\n\n                                      21                                     A-3690-14T3\n\fpractice,     and   request      for   a     low-income       preference      in    its\n\nsubmissions to the Commissioner.             Hoboken fails to state, however,\n\nwhat     additional   information          was   needed   in     order     for      the\n\nCommissioner to complete his review.              The decision states: \"[a]ll\n\nsubmitted materials from both parties were thoroughly reviewed.\"\n\n\"When the Commissioner is not acting in a quasi-judicial capacity,\n\nas he was not here, he need not provide the kind of formalized\n\nfindings and conclusions necessary in the traditional contested\n\ncase.\"     In re Grant of Charter Sch.

As    a    dual-language      school,      HoLa     allows\n\nstudents to become bilingual in a curriculum with a multi-cultural\n\ncontent, and thus advances public policy goals.                   Hoboken has not\n\nshown that the Commissioner's decision to allow HoLa to expand was\n\narbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable.2\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n2\n  This decision does not preclude parents who believe their child\nwas unfairly denied admission to HoLa for discriminatory reasons\nfrom registering an individual complaint pursuant to N.J.S.A.\n18A:36A-15.\n                                        22                                    A-3690-14T3\n\f",

Hoboken claims that the Commissioner failed to\n\nconsider the charter school's alleged segregative and funding\n\nimpact on the district and improperly declined to hold a hearing,\n\nconduct interviews, or gather more facts concerning the charter\n\nschool's policies.     Because neither the methodology used by the\n\nCommissioner   nor   his   decision   were   arbitrary,   capricious,   or\n\nunreasonable, we affirm.\n\n     On October 15, 2013, HoLa submitted a charter renewal and\n\nexpansion application to the Commissioner and Hoboken. The Hoboken\n\n\n                                      2                          A-3690-14T3\n\fSuperintendent    fully    supported        Hola's   charter    renewal,       but\n\nobjected to its expansion.         On March 5, 2014, Evo Popoff, the\n\nChief Innovation Officer at the Department of Education (the\n\nDepartment), acting on the Commissioner's behalf, renewed HoLa's\n\ncharter for five years, through June 30, 2019.                    Popoff also\n\npermitted the elementary school to add a seventh-grade class for\n\nthe 2016-2017 school year and an eighth-grade class for the 2018-\n\n2019 school year.\n\n     Hoboken appealed, and after our remand to the Commissioner\n\nupon application of the Department, and after the parties submitted\n\nadditional    materials,   the    Commissioner       again     granted     HoLa's\n\nrenewal and expansion application on March 20, 2015.               We denied a\n\nstay.\n\n     The City of Hoboken has a public school system for students\n\nin grades kindergarten (K) through 12 consisting of four public\n\nschools: Brandt, Calabro, Connors and Wallace.               It also includes\n\nthree charter schools including HoLa, and four private, tuition-\n\nbased K-8 schools.\n\n     According to HoLa, the original intent of its founders was\n\nto implement a dual-language program (Spanish and English) at\n\nHoboken's    Connors   school    (the   district's    most     segregated      and\n\npoorest school), but Hoboken rejected the plan.              HoLa then applied\n\nfor and was granted a charter to operate a dual-language school\n\n\n                                        3                                A-3690-14T3\n\fbeginning in September 2010, starting with grades K-2 and expanding\n\neach year until HoLa encompassed grades K-6.           HoLa is located in\n\na low-income section of Hoboken, close to the Connors school.\n\n     Students are admitted to HoLa through a lottery with no\n\ninterviews.    No demographic data is collected until students are\n\nregistered.    In order to represent a cross section of the Hoboken\n\ncommunity, HoLa holds open houses and tours and advertises in\n\nlocal publications.      It also partners with local organizations to\n\nrecruit on-site.      Dates for the open houses, tours and events, as\n\nwell as the lottery, are posted on the school's website and are\n\nprinted on flyers \"distributed throughout the city.\"            In addition,\n\napplications    and    brochures   are   mailed   to    every    low-income\n\nhousehold each year prior to the lottery.              HoLa's parents and\n\nteachers also canvass subsidized and public housing and help\n\ncomplete applications on the spot.\n\n     Parents may enroll children in the lottery online, in person,\n\nor by a phone call to the school.        HoLa has a sibling preference,\n\nso that if a child is enrolled in HoLa, that child's younger\n\nsibling will have priority over other lottery applicants.                   On\n\nDecember 23, 2014, HoLa submitted a request to the Commissioner\n\nto include a low-income preference in its lottery.1\n\n\n\n\n1\n  This request was granted in December 2015 after the record in\nthis case closed.\n                                    4                               A-3690-14T3\n\f       Initially, in 2013, Popoff conducted \"a comprehensive review\"\n\nof   HoLa,     \"including    the   evaluation      of     the   school's      renewal\n\napplication,      annual     reports,     student        performance     on     state\n\nassessments,      site   visit     results,      public    comments,     and    other\n\ninformation.\" Popoff found that HoLa was \"providing a high-quality\n\neducation to its students.\"          In the 2012-2013 school year, 82% of\n\nHoLa's students were at least proficient in Language Arts, while\n\n91% were at least proficient in math.              By comparison, only 50% of\n\nHoboken's      traditional    public      school    students      were   at     least\n\nproficient in Language Arts and 52% were at least proficient in\n\nmath.\n\n       After the remand, the parties submitted more information,\n\nincluding census and student enrollment data.                   According to 2010\n\nU.S. Census data, Hoboken's under-seventeen population was 57%\n\nwhite, 26% Hispanic, and 16% \"other\" reflecting a significant\n\nincrease in the percentage of white children from the 2000 Census\n\ndata, which showed Hoboken's under-seventeen population as 39%\n\nwhite, 46% Hispanic, and 15% \"other.\"                   In the 2009-2010 school\n\nyear    (the    year     before    HoLa       started     operating),    Hoboken's\n\ntraditional public school student population was 22% white, 59%\n\nHispanic, 15% black, and 4% Asian.              By the 2013-2014 school year,\n\nfour years after HoLa began, Hoboken's traditional public school\n\nstudent population had increased its percentage of white students\n\n\n                                          5                                A-3690-14T3\n\ffrom 22% to 27%.\n\n       The   Commissioner       considered      the     racial   breakdown    of   the\n\nstudents in the public and charter schools for 2012-2013 and 2013-\n\n2014. Between these school years, the percentage of white students\n\nat HoLa rose from 60.6% to 63%, while Connors rose from only 3.9%\n\nwhite students to 4%.         Brandt rose from 61.5% to 72%, and Wallace\n\nrose from 32.6% to 43%.          The final public school, Calabro, dipped\n\nfrom 34.6% to 32%.         As can be seen by these statistics, minority\n\nstudents are heavily concentrated at Connors, where in both years\n\nthey made up approximately 95% of the student population.                          The\n\npercentage      of   students    receiving       free    or   reduced-price     lunch\n\ndecreased for all four Hoboken public elementary schools from\n\n2010-2011 to 2013-2014, although at Connors 88% of the students\n\nstill received a lunch subsidy in 2013-2014.\n\n       In    addition   to   considering        the   submitted    materials,      the\n\nOffice of Charter Schools conducted its own review of data focusing\n\non race and ethnicity to determine whether HoLa was having a\n\nsegregative effect on the Hoboken Public School District, stating:\n\n\"After the Department's analysis of publically available student\n\nenrollment data, census data, and documentation submitted by the\n\nparties, it has been determined that HoLa does [not] and will not\n\nhave   a     segregative     effect   on       [Hoboken].\"       The   Commissioner\n\nexplained:\n\n\n                                           6                                 A-3690-14T3\n\f          [A]lthough HoLa enrolls a higher percentage\n          of White students, and a smaller percentage\n          of Black and Hispanic students than [Hoboken],\n          the percentage of White students attending\n          [Hoboken] has actually increased since HoLa\n          opened in 2010 with the percentage of Hispanic\n          students decreasing in that same period. The\n          percentage of Black students in [Hoboken] has\n          stayed fairly constant since 2010.         The\n          increase in percentage of [Hoboken's] White\n          students since 2010, along with the decrease\n          in Hispanic students, and the lack of changes\n          to the percentage of Black students indicates\n          that HoLa's enrollment has not had a\n          segregative effect on [Hoboken]. Instead, the\n          data points towards an overall population\n          shift in the last ten years in the City of\n          Hoboken, which began before the opening of\n          HoLa Charter School.\n\n     Hoboken argues that in granting the expansion of HoLa's\n\ncharter to include seventh and eighth grades, the Commissioner:\n\n1) failed to consider HoLa's alleged racially and economically\n\nsegregative effect; 2) failed to consider the funding impact to\n\nstudents affected by poverty and special needs; and 3) failed to\n\nconduct interviews, gather facts, or hold a hearing to consider\n\nHoLa's policies and practices.\n\n     Our review of the Commissioner's decision is limited.

Hoboken argues that because the\n\n2013-2014 Department's report erroneously included data for pre-K\n\nstudents in the district and HoLa did not enroll pre-K students,\n\nthe report was not an accurate reflection of Hoboken's population.\n\nThe Department data included data from the Brandt school, which\n\nserved only pre-K and K students, and which enrolled a higher\n\npercentage of white students than the other public schools (62%\n\nwhite in 2012-2013 and 72% white in 2013-2014).\n\n     It is true that HoLa did not admit pre-K students and the\n\nDepartment's   statistics   for   2013-14    included   data   for   pre-K\n\nstudents. However, the Department's 2012-2013 data did not include\n\nthe pre-K data, and those numbers were relied upon to the same\n\n\n                                  10                             A-3690-14T3\n\fextent as the 2013-2014 numbers.       Moreover, the inclusion of the\n\npre-K data did not skew the statistics; although the pre-K data\n\nincluded Brandt, a predominately white school in the district,\n\nthose same statistics also included data on Wallace and Connors,\n\nschools that were predominately minority, and which also added\n\npre-K in the 2013-2014 school year.       Thus, contrary to Hoboken's\n\nsuggestion, the inclusion of Brandt did not skew the statistics.\n\nAnd, although HoLa did not offer pre-K, \"trends in the student\n\npopulation\" are \"valid factors\" to be considered when determining\n\nwhether an action will have a segregative impact.

The Commissioner properly\n\nconsidered the pre-K data because it provided solid evidence of\n\nthe trends in the student population.\n\n     Hoboken   also   complains   that   the    Commissioner   erred   in\n\nconsidering census information concerning all of the children\n\nunder age seventeen in Hoboken and not just those of school age.\n\nIt argues this was error because: 1) the statute requires a review\n\nof the community's \"school age\" population; 2) the under-five age\n\ngroup is overrepresented in the Hoboken population; and 3) the\n\nrelevant comparison is that of the student population in the\n\n\n                                  11                            A-3690-14T3\n\fdistrict, not the student population of Hoboken.\n\n      N.J.S.A.   18A:36A-8(e)    addresses       enrollment   preferences,\n\nstating: \"The admission policy of the charter school shall, to the\n\nmaximum extent practicable, seek the enrollment of a cross section\n\nof the community's school age population, including racial and\n\nacademic factors.\"      The racial make-up of students expected to\n\nenroll in school in the next four years is a trend that the\n\nCommissioner should consider. N. Haledon I, supra, 363 N.J. Super.\n\nat 142.\n\n      Hoboken argues that the relevant statistics were those that\n\ncompared HoLa's student population to the student population of\n\nthe traditional public school system, not to the population of\n\nthose under age seventeen.      To support its position, it cites to\n\nEnglewood, which states the Commissioner \"must consider the impact\n\nthat the movement of pupils to a charter school would have on the\n\ndistrict of residence\" and it is the Commissioner's \"obligation\n\nto oversee the promotion of racial balance in our public schools\n\nto   ensure   that   public   school    pupils    are   not   subjected   to\n\nsegregation.\"    Englewood, supra, 164 N.J. at 328 (emphasis added).\n\nHoboken also cites to N.J.A.C. 6A:11-2.2(c) that states in part\n\nthat \"the Commissioner shall assess the student composition of a\n\ncharter school and the segregative effect that the loss of the\n\nstudents may have on its district of residence.\"\n\n\n                                   12                              A-3690-14T3\n\f     N.J.S.A.   18A:36A-8(e),     however,    states   that   a     charter\n\nschool's admission policy must seek to enroll \"a cross section of\n\nthe community's school age population.\"        (Emphasis added).        This\n\nindicates that the entire community, not just the students enrolled\n\nin   the   public   schools,    must   be    considered.      Any     other\n\ninterpretation would exclude potential students who had already\n\nelected not to attend public schools, but who were part of the\n\npopulation eligible to attend the public schools.                 A simple\n\ncomparison between the charter schools and the traditional public\n\nschools is not necessarily representative of the demographics:\n\nbased on 2013-2014 data, 65% of Hoboken's school-age population\n\nwas white, but only 27% of Hoboken's students were white.               This\n\nwas largely the result of four private K-8 schools that enrolled\n\nthousands of Hoboken's students.       Consequently, the analysis is\n\ncomplicated.    It is not fair to HoLa to refuse to recognize the\n\nimpact of the private schools on overall school enrollment in\n\nHoboken, as HoLa has no control over private school enrollment.\n\nHoboken presents no data of its own to support its positions.            The\n\nCommissioner did not act arbitrarily in considering the data\n\npresented.\n\n     Assuming that the data the Commissioner relied on was correct,\n\nHoboken maintains that the Commissioner's legal interpretation of\n\nthat data was wrong in that \"the lack of a documented increase in\n\n\n                                  13                               A-3690-14T3\n\fHoLa's segregative impact on Hoboken's school-aged children does\n\nnot negate the existence of the segregative impact.\"                     We have\n\nstated:\n\n            [A] Charter School should not be faulted for\n            developing an attractive educational program.\n            Assuming the school's enrollment practices\n            remain color blind, random, and open to all\n            students in the community, the parents of age\n            eligible students will decide whether or not\n            to attempt to enroll their child in the\n            Charter School and any racial/ethnic imbalance\n            cannot be attributed solely to the school. To\n            close   this  school    would    undermine   the\n            Legislature's     policy      of      \"promoting\n            comprehensive    educational       reform\"    by\n            fostering the development of charter schools.\n\n            [In re Red Bank Charter Sch., supra, 367 N.J.\n            Super. at 478 (quoting N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-2).]\n\n     In    Red   Bank,    as    here,   a    disparity   existed    between    the\n\nenrollment of minority students in the charter school and the\n\ntraditional public schools.             Id. at 473-74.     We were concerned\n\nthat after initial enrollment, the charter school in Red Bank\n\ndecreased the percentage of minority students as the students\n\nprogressed toward graduation, with the argument being made that\n\nthe charter school frequently returned minority students with poor\n\nacademic    records      to    the   public    schools    just     in   time   for\n\nstandardized testing.          Id. at 479.    We determined that the charter\n\nschool's \"manner of operation of the school after its color-blind\n\nlottery, warrants closer scrutiny to determine whether some of the\n\nschool's practices may be worsening the existing racial/ethnic\n\n                                        14                               A-3690-14T3\n\fimbalance in the district\" and remanded to the Commissioner to\n\ndetermine \"whether remedial action is warranted.\"                              Id. at 480,\n\n482. Despite the stark disparity in Red Bank, however, we approved\n\nthe renewal and expansion of the charter school.                               Id. at 486.\n\nUnlike in Red Bank, there are no allegations that HoLa's practices\n\nafter    the     enrollment       of     students      by    an    impartial         lottery\n\nexacerbated the racial or ethnic balance.\n\n       In addition to the arguments Hoboken makes in the context of\n\nthe charter school statutory scheme, it also argues that the\n\nCommissioner      violated       his     duty   to     enforce     the       \"Thorough     and\n\nEfficient Education\" clause of the New Jersey Constitution when\n\nhe   failed    to      remedy    de    facto     segregation       caused       by    HoLa's\n\nexpansion.        In    the     \"Education      Clause\"      or    the       \"Thorough     and\n\nEfficient Provision,\" the New Jersey Constitution provides:                               \"The\n\nLegislature shall provide for the maintenance and support of a\n\nthorough and efficient system of free public schools for the\n\ninstruction of all the children in the State between the ages of\n\nfive and eighteen years.\"              N.J.

However,\n\nit is \"not really possible to establish a precise point when a\n\nthorough    and    efficient    education       is   threatened    by    racial\n\nimbalance.\"      N.

Although the Board of Review granted the withdrawal,\n\nseveral interested parties objected arguing that the Board failed\n\nto assess the impact of the withdrawal on the racial makeup of the\n\nhigh school, given the white student population would decrease by\n\nnine percent, and that the percentage of minorities would continue\n\nto rise and the white population would continue to decline due to\n\npopulation trends in the sending towns.              Id. at 164, 174.         Our\n\nSupreme Court stated:\n\n           Not every action that reduces the percentage\n           of white students necessarily implicates the\n           State's policy against segregation in the\n           public schools. . . . What we do know is that\n           in   this   case,   demographic   trends   are\n           contributing to a steady decrease in the\n           number of white students attending Manchester\n           Regional, and that North Haledon's withdrawal\n           will accelerate this trend. Rather than using\n           the demographic trend as an excuse for\n           approving North Haledon's petition, the Board\n           should have considered the ameliorative effect\n\n                                    16                                  A-3690-14T3\n\f            of denying the petition on the racial balance\n            at Manchester Regional.\n\n            [Id. at 183.]\n\n     Hoboken does not, however, show that expanding HoLa will\n\nincrease racial imbalance as it did in North Haledon.               To the\n\ncontrary, the percentage of white students in Hoboken schools\n\nincreased since HoLa opened.\n\n                         II. Economic Segregation\n\n     Hoboken also claims that the Commissioner failed to consider\n\nthe economic disparity between the student populations of HoLa and\n\nthe district.      It points out that while 11% to 16% of HoLa's\n\npopulation qualified for free or reduced-price lunch, Hoboken had\n\nmuch higher levels in some schools.          N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-8 does not\n\nspecifically     address   economic    factors,    instead   requiring   the\n\nadmission policy of a charter school to \"seek the enrollment of a\n\ncross section of the community's population including racial and\n\nacademic factors.\"\n\n     The evidence showed that HoLa's policies are geared toward\n\nadmitting    a   cross     section    of   the    school-aged   population,\n\neconomically as well as racially and ethnically.             HoLa canvassed\n\nand advertised in Hoboken's subsidized housing developments.               On\n\nDecember 23, 2014, HoLa submitted a successful request to the\n\nDepartment to include a low-income preference in its lottery.\n\nHoboken fails to convince us that the facts regarding economically\n\n                                      17                           A-3690-14T3\n\fdisadvantaged students lead to a conclusion that HoLa should not\n\nbe permitted to expand.\n\n                            III. Funding Impact\n\n     Hoboken next argues that the Commissioner's decision was\n\narbitrary and capricious because he failed to consider its January\n\n30, 2015, submission to the court and Hoboken Superintendent Mark\n\nToback's December 13, 2010 letter concerning the funding impact\n\nthat charter schools had on Hoboken's budget, including the number\n\nof special needs students enrolled in HoLa versus Hoboken.\n\n     N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-12(b) provides:\n\n           The school district of residence shall pay\n           directly to the charter school for each\n           student enrolled in the charter school who\n           resides in the district an amount equal to 90%\n           of the sum of the budget year equalization aid\n           per pupil and the prebudget year general fund\n           tax levy per pupil inflated by the CPI rate\n           most recent to the calculation. In addition,\n           the school district of residence shall pay\n           directly to the charter school the security\n           categorical aid attributable to the student\n           and a percentage of the district's special\n           education categorical aid equal to the\n           percentage of the district's special education\n           students enrolled in the charter school, and,\n           if applicable, 100% of preschool education\n           aid. The district of residence shall also pay\n           directly to the charter school any federal\n           funds attributable to the student.\n\n     Toback pointed out that the allocation of funds to the charter\n\nschools located in Hoboken had \"nearly tripled in only a few short\n\nyears\"   and   that   the   pattern   was   not   sustainable   \"given   our\n\n\n                                      18                           A-3690-14T3\n\fenrollment increase at the lower grade levels coupled with a 2%\n\ntax cap.\" He claimed that \"[e]ven with tax increases, the district\n\nmust make cuts to services and programs for our students to support\n\ncharter expansion.\"    He wrote: \"We have four school district\n\nleaders in one square mile, four business administrators, four\n\nseparate payrolls, four separate boards of education and a host\n\nof required services that are duplicated.\"    However, he did not\n\nsubmit specific financial data to support those assertions.\n\n     As to students with special needs, Toback wrote:\n\n          HoLa does enroll a few special needs children,\n          and the other two charters enroll about the\n          same percentage of special needs students as\n          our district. But it must be noted that the\n          charter schools do not enroll students with\n          significant disabilities.    It is the public\n          district that enrolls the most significantly\n          disabled children and pays for private out-\n          of-district placements. This concentrates an\n          expensive undertaking in the public schools,\n          thus raising our per-pupil costs and reducing\n          per-pupil costs in charter schools.\n\nHe further noted, again without district-specific evidence, that\n\nthe existing law gave an \"incentive\" for charter schools to place\n\nspecial needs students in out-of-district placements, which put\n\nthe cost back on the district.\n\n          [I]f the local school district \"demonstrates\n          with some specificity that the constitutional\n          requirements of a thorough and efficient\n          education would be jeopardized by [the\n          district's] loss\" of the funds to be allocated\n          to a charter school, \"the Commissioner is\n          obligated to evaluate carefully the impact\n\n                                 19                        A-3690-14T3\n\f           that loss of funds would have on the ability\n           of the district of residence to deliver a\n           thorough and efficient education.\"\n\n           [In re Proposed Quest Acad., supra, 216 N.J.\n           at 377-78 (quoting Englewood, supra, 164 N.J.\n           at 334-35).]\n\n     \"[U]nsubstantiated, generalized protests\" are insufficient.\n\nEnglewood, supra, 164 N.J. at 336.           \"Renewal of a successful\n\ncharter school will be favored, 'unless reliable information is\n\nput forward to demonstrate that a constitutional violation may\n\noccur.'\"   In re Red Bank Charter Sch., supra, 367 N.J. at 482-83\n\n(quoting Englewood, supra, 164 N.J. at 336).\n\n     \"[T]he Commissioner is entitled to rely on the district of\n\nresidence to come forward with a preliminary showing that the\n\nrequirements of a thorough and efficient education cannot be met.\"\n\nEnglewood, supra, 164 N.J. at 334.       The district \"must be able to\n\nsupport its assertions\" as the Commissioner does not have \"the\n\nburden of canvassing the financial condition of the district of\n\nresidence in order to determine its ability to adjust to the per-\n\npupil   loss   upon   approval   of    the   charter   school   based   on\n\nunsubstantiated, generalized protests.\"        Id. at 336.\n\n     In In re Red Bank Charter Sch., supra, 367 N.J. Super. at\n\n482, the district claimed that the funding of a charter school\n\nwould cause the district's budget to be reduced by $720,000, and\n\nthat it would cause the elimination of four positions, resulting\n\n\n                                  20                             A-3690-14T3\n\fin bigger classes, as well as the elimination of courtesy busing\n\nand reduction of hall monitors, instructional assistants, and\n\ncafeteria monitors.      In spite of these representations, we found\n\nthe \"paucity of specificity\" in the district's claim to be \"fatal.\"\n\nId. at 483.\n\n       Here,   Hoboken   does   not   argue      that    the   financial       losses\n\nsurrounding HoLa's expansion would impede Hoboken's ability to\n\nprovide a thorough and efficient education.                       It mounts only\n\ngeneral,    non-specific   and    unconvincing          attacks   on   the    entire\n\ncharter school scheme and does not separate HoLa's impact from the\n\nimpact of the other two charter schools.\n\n                           IV. Fact-gathering\n\n       In its supplemental submission to the Commissioner after\n\nremand, Hoboken requested that the Commissioner \"conduct further\n\ninterviews, fact gathering, and perhaps hold a hearing to better\n\nassess possible interventions.\"            On appeal, Hoboken argues that\n\nthe Commissioner should have held hearings to consider the effect\n\nHoLa's policies and practices had on segregation before reaching\n\na decision as to HoLa's renewal and expansion application.\n\n       An adjudicatory hearing is not required in every contested\n\nrenewal application case.        In re Proposed Quest Acad., supra, 216\n\nN.J.   at   383.

Hoboken fails to state, however,\n\nwhat     additional   information          was   needed   in     order     for      the\n\nCommissioner to complete his review.              The decision states: \"[a]ll\n\nsubmitted materials from both parties were thoroughly reviewed.\"\n\n\"When the Commissioner is not acting in a quasi-judicial capacity,\n\nas he was not here, he need not provide the kind of formalized\n\nfindings and conclusions necessary in the traditional contested\n\ncase.\"     In re Grant of Charter Sch.

As    a    dual-language      school,      HoLa     allows\n\nstudents to become bilingual in a curriculum with a multi-cultural\n\ncontent, and thus advances public policy goals.                   Hoboken has not\n\nshown that the Commissioner's decision to allow HoLa to expand was\n\narbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable.2\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n2\n  This decision does not preclude parents who believe their child\nwas unfairly denied admission to HoLa for discriminatory reasons\nfrom registering an individual complaint pursuant to N.J.S.A.\n18A:36A-15.\n                                        22                                    A-3690-14T3\n\f</pre>",
