In the briefing currently before the Court, plaintiffs\nfocus only on their FHA claim, so this memorandum opinion similarly does not discuss this\nsecond claim.\n\fgrants as part of the Road Home Homeowner Assistance Program (“Road Home Program” or\n\n“Program”), a housing redevelopment initiative designed to help homeowners affected by\n\nHurricanes Katrina and Rita. Plaintiffs seek an injunction requiring recalculation of Program\n\nawards to homeowners in New Orleans using a formula that does not have a disparate impact on\n\nAfrican Americans.\n\n       On June 29, 2010, the Court issued an order that denied plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary\n\nrestraining order and a preliminary injunction [#50] which sought to enjoin Keegan from\n\nspending surplus funds that remain available to the Road Home Program, or seeking any\n\nadditional Program funds from HUD, while this case is pending. This opinion explains the\n\nreasoning on which that order was based.\n\n                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n       In 2005, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused catastrophic damage to New Orleans,\n\nLouisiana, and other nearby places. In response, Congress created a block grant program to assist\n\nin recovery of the region, which it funded through three appropriations statutes. See Pub. L. No.\n\n109-148, 119 Stat. 2680, 2779-81 (Dec. 30, 2005); Pub. L. No. 109-234, 120 Stat. 418, 472-73\n\n(June 15, 2006); Pub. L. No. 110-116, 121 Stat. 1295, 1343-44 (Nov. 13, 2007). Pursuant to\n\nthese statutes and HUD regulations, the State of Louisiana was to receive $13.4 billion. See 71\n\nFed. Reg. 7666, 7666 (Feb. 13, 2006) (allocating $6.2 billion from the first appropriation to\n\nLouisiana); 71 Fed. Reg. 63,337, 63,338 (Oct. 30, 2006) (allocating $4.2 billion from the second\n\nappropriation to Louisiana); 121 Stat. at 1343-44 (appropriating $3 billion for supplemental\n\ngrants to Louisiana).\n\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\f       Louisiana designated approximately $11 billion of those funds for the Road Home\n\nProgram. The LRA, in consultation with HUD, developed the Program; HUD approved it and\n\ndisburses the money Congress has appropriated for it to the LRA; and the LRA administers it.\n\nUnder a portion of the Program called Option 1, an individual whose house was damaged by the\n\nhurricanes may choose to receive a grant to repair or rebuild her home.3 Each beneficiary of an\n\nOption 1 grant receives an award in the amount of either the value of her home before the storms\n\nor the cost of repairing her home, whichever is less, but not in excess of $150,000. Since\n\nplaintiffs initiated their suit, the LRA has created Additional Compensation Grants (“ACGs”),\n\nsupplemental awards available to Option 1 beneficiaries whose incomes are at or below eighty\n\npercent of the median in their areas. Regardless of the pre-storm values of their homes, these\n\nindividuals may receive ACGs such that their total awards from the Road Home Program reach\n\nthe cost of repairs to their homes, still subject to the $150,000 cap.\n\n       Since the Road Home Program’s inception, the LRA has distributed Option 1 awards to\n\ntens of thousands of homeowners. As of the time of the briefing regarding plaintiffs’ current\n\nmotion, only 179 individuals who applied for Option 1 grants had yet to receive their awards.\n\nThe LRA has money set aside to fund grants for those individuals, to continue to distribute ACGs\n\nto eligible individuals, and for other projects within the Road Home Program. The LRA is\n\ncurrently seeking approval to use much of the Program money not yet designated to a specific use\n\nfor “Action Plan Amendment 43,” a construction lending program designed to assist Road Home\n\n\n\n\n       3\n               The Program also permits homeowners to instead opt to receive smaller grants to\nobtain housing elsewhere in Louisiana or outside the state. The design and implementation of\nthose aspects of the Program are not at issue here.\n\n                                                  3\n\fProgram beneficiaries who have not been able to complete repairs to their homes. Keegan\n\nestimates that she has $554.5 million remaining in the Program budget.\n\n       Individual plaintiffs Gloria Burns, Rhonda Dents, Almarie Ford, Daphne Jones, and\n\nEdward Randolph are African Americans who own homes in New Orleans that were severely\n\ndamaged by Hurricane Katrina, and subsequent flooding, in 2005.4 Each applied for a Road\n\nHome Program grant under Option 1, and each received an award based on the pre-storm value\n\nof her or his home rather than the cost of repairing that home.5 Since receiving their initial\n\ngrants, Burns and Jones have been deemed eligible to receive ACGs such that their total awards\n\nwill amount to $150,000.\n\n       In their complaint, plaintiffs allege that the LRA’s reliance on home values in calculating\n\nawards “has a discriminatory disparate impact on African Americans living in historically\n\nsegregated communities.” Compl. ¶ 52. Specifically, they argue that because “African American\n\nhomeowners in New Orleans are more likely than white homeowners in New Orleans to own\n\n\n\n       4\n               The other plaintiffs, Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center, a non-\nprofit organization based in Louisiana, and the National Fair Housing Alliance, a non-profit\norganization based in Washington, D.C., are advocacy groups that, inter alia, oppose housing\ndiscrimination.\n       5\n                According to the complaint, Burns received $106,500, which was $89,000 less\nthan the cost of damage to her home and $43,500 less than the maximum she could have\nreceived; Dents received $88,534, which was $58,730 less than the cost of damage to her home;\nFord received $3,468, which was $156,073 less than the cost of damage to her home and\n$146,532 less than the maximum she could have received; Jones received $61,000, which was\n$45,262 less than the cost of damage to her home; and Randolph received $16,650, which was\n$173,193 less than the cost of damage to his home and $133,350 less than the maximum he could\nhave received. Compl. ¶¶ 61-65. Some of the awards are in amounts less than the pre-storm\nvalue of the home because the LRA deducts from each grant any amount of money the\nhomeowner has received as compensation for storm damage from her insurance company or\nanother source, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\n                                                 4\n\fhomes with lower values,” African-American recipients of Road Home Program grants are more\n\nlikely than white recipients to receive only the amount of the pre-storm value of their homes and,\n\nconsequently, to have a larger gap than white recipients between the amount of the grant and the\n\ncost of rebuilding. Compl. ¶¶ 54-57. This effect, plaintiffs assert, constitutes a violation of the\n\nFair Housing Act.6 Ultimately, plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, “including but not limited to\n\nordering Defendants to cease immediately their violation of Plaintiffs’ rights, and to remedy the\n\ninvidious effects of their violations by recalculating Road Home homeowner grants in a\n\nnondiscriminatory manner.” Compl. at 17.\n\n       At this time, plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction enjoining Keegan from spending any\n\nsurplus funds—that is, Program funds not already designated for the remaining 179 Option 1\n\nawards, ACGs, or any other specific use—until the merits of their case are resolved. They make\n\nthis request because Keegan will only be able to distribute recalculated awards, should plaintiffs\n\nprevail on the merits, if sufficient Road Home Program funds remain available for that purpose.\n\n       Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction is accompanied by evidence they allege\n\nsupports their allegation that the Option 1 formula has a discriminatory effect. Specifically, they\n\npoint to statistics from the U.S. Census showing that in New Orleans, homes owned by African\n\nAmericans have lower values, on average, than homes owned by whites. Pls.’ Mot. for TRO, Ex.\n\nP. They attached to their motion a study by PolicyLink, “a national independent research\n\n\n       6\n                 Specifically, Count I of the complaint alleges that defendants have (1) “made\nunavailable or denied housing to African American homeowners because of their race in\nviolation of” section 3604(a) of the FHA; (2) “discriminated against African Americans because\nof their race in the availability of, and in the terms and conditions of, real estate-related\ntransactions in violation of” section 3605(a) of the FHA; and (3) “failed to administer housing-\nrelated programs and activities in a manner that affirmatively furthers fair housing, in violation\nof” sections 3608(d) and 3608(e)(5) of the FHA. Compl. ¶¶ 74-76.\n\n                                                  5\n\forganization,” which concludes that on average, African-American applicants to the Road Home\n\nProgram received funds in amounts further below the costs to rebuild their homes than white\n\napplicants. Id. at 11-12; id., Ex. S. They also assert that Paul Rainwater, Keegan’s predecessor\n\nat the LRA, told a subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives that home values in\n\nAfrican-American neighborhoods tend to be lower than in white neighborhoods and that he was\n\n“sure” that African-American homeowners were more likely than whites to receive awards based\n\non the value of their homes than the cost of repairs. Id. at 15-16; id., Ex. N at 23-24. Finally,\n\nthey attach to their motion the declaration of Carol Johnson, president of a Louisiana mortgage\n\ncompany, who asserts she has expertise in the mortgage industry and that she has “observed that\n\nbecause of the formula employed, Road Home Program grant calculations result in homeowners\n\nin predominantly African American areas received lower grant awards than homeowners in\n\npredominantly White areas.” Id., Ex. T ¶ 7.7\n\n                                           II. ANALYSIS\n\n       This court may issue a preliminary injunction only when the movant demonstrates: (1) “a\n\nsubstantial likelihood of success on the merits”; (2) “that it would suffer irreparable injury if the\n\ninjunction is not granted”; (3) “that an injunction would not substantially injure other interested\n\nparties”; and (4) “that the public interest would be furthered by the injunction.” Mova Pharm.\n\nCorp. v. Shalala, 140 F.3d 1060, 1066 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (quoting CityFed Fin. Corp. v. Office of\n\n\n\n       7\n               Keegan has moved to strike this declaration because Johnson is “not an expert\neconomist or statistician.” Keegan Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. for TRO (“Keegan Opp’n”) at 29 n.20.\nPlaintiffs oppose this motion, arguing that Johnson has relevant expertise regarding home values\nin New Orleans. The parties have made these arguments in less detail than is necessary for the\nCourt to rule on the motion. Furthermore, the Court’s ruling on plaintiffs’ motion does not\ndepend on whether it considers this evidence.\n\n                                                  6\n\fThrift Supervision, 58 F.3d 738, 746 (D.C. Cir. 1995)). “These factors interrelate on a sliding\n\nscale and must be balanced against each other.” Serono Labs., Inc. v. Shalala, 158 F.3d 1313,\n\n1318 (D.C. Cir. 1998). Because preliminary injunctions are “extraordinary and drastic” forms of\n\njudicial relief, district courts should not grant them “unless the movant, by a clear showing,\n\ncarries the burden of persuasion.” Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997) (quoting\n\n11A C. WRIGHT , A. MILLER, & M. KANE , FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 2948, pp.\n\n129-130 (2d ed.1995)) (emphasis in Mazurek).\n\nA.     Plaintiffs Have Not Shown a Likelihood of Success on the Merits.\n\n       1.      Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they could likely make out a prima facie\n               case of discrimination in violation of the Fair Housing Act.\n\n       For the reasons explained below, the Court concludes that it may not provide the ultimate\n\nrelief plaintiffs seek and therefore should not grant the preliminary relief they currently request.\n\nBut the Court notes first that plaintiffs’ disparate impact claim under the Fair Housing Act\n\nappears to have merit. Although full analysis of the issues raised here is unnecessary, the Court\n\nfeels compelled nevertheless to briefly explain its reasoning.\n\n       Although the D.C. Circuit did not determine in 2922 Sherman Avenue Tenants’\n\nAssociation v. District of Columbia, 444 F.3d 673 (D.C. Cir. 2006), which of two possible\n\nstandards courts in this Circuit are to apply in assessing disparate impact claims under the FHA,\n\nsee id. at 680, the Court believes that the appropriate approach is the burden-shifting framework\n\nadopted by several other Circuits. Under this framework, “once the plaintiff demonstrates that\n\nthe challenged practice has a disproportionate impact, the burden shifts to the defendant to ‘prove\n\nthat its actions furthered, in theory and in practice, a legitimate, bona fide governmental interest\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fand that no alternative would serve that interest with less discriminatory effect.’” Id. (quoting\n\nHuntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d 926, 935-36 (2d Cir. 1988)).\n\n        Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they would likely be able to make out this prima facie\n\ncase after discovery. The statistical and anecdotal evidence they submit to the Court leads to a\n\nstrong inference that, on average, African-American homeowners received awards that fell\n\nfarther short of the cost of repairing their homes than did white recipients. Keegan’s attacks on\n\nthat evidence are unpersuasive. Plaintiffs need not make a showing at this stage of the\n\nproceedings, before discovery and when briefing is necessarily rushed, sufficient to prove the\n\nmerits of their case. Keegan neither demonstrates that plaintiffs’ statistics or logic is flawed nor\n\nprovides data about the administration of the Program that would show what effect the Option 1\n\nformula has had. Cf. Berger v. Iron Workers Reinforced Rodmen Local 201, 843 F.2d 1395,\n\n1412 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (“Defendants may also attempt to undermine plaintiffs’ prima facie case\n\nby attacking the validity of plaintiffs’ statistical evidence, or by introducing statistical evidence\n\nof their own showing that the challenged practice did not have racially disproportionate results.”\n\n(citation omitted)). She has also offered no legitimate reason for taking pre-storm home values\n\ninto account in calculating Program awards. The Court does not take lightly that some African-\n\nAmerican homeowners received lower awards than they would have if their homes were in\n\npredominantly white neighborhoods. And, although the Court appreciates that all of the parties\n\nare committed to the rebuilding of a city that has suffered greatly, it is regrettable that this effort\n\nto do so appears to have proceeded in a manner that disadvantaged African-American\n\nhomeowners who wish to repair their homes.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   8\n\f        2.      Plaintiffs cannot prevail on the merits because this Court does not have the\n                authority to grant the ultimate relief they seek.\n\n        Keegan argues that regardless of the merit of plaintiffs’ discrimination claim, the Court\n\nlacks subject matter jurisdiction over this case because the Eleventh Amendment to the U.S.\n\nConstitution bars the Court from providing the relief plaintiffs seek. Her primary argument8 is\n\nbased on a legal premise the Court explained in some detail in a Clarification [#52] to an order it\n\nentered regarding a motion to dismiss Keegan filed before plaintiffs submitted their motion. For\n\nclarity, the Court again describes the legal background before addressing plaintiffs’ response.\n\n        The Eleventh Amendment bars suits against states absent the relevant state’s consent to\n\nbe sued. See Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 276 (1986).9 But in Ex parte Young, 209 U.S.\n\n123 (1908), the Supreme Court held that “[a] federal court is not barred by the Eleventh\n\nAmendment from enjoining state officers from acting unconstitutionally, either because their\n\naction is alleged to violate the Constitution directly or because it is contrary to a federal statute or\n\nregulation that is the supreme law of the land.” Vann v. Kempthorne, 534 F.3d 741, 749 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2008) (quoting CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT ET AL., FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 4232\n\n\n        8\n                Keegan also argues that Eleventh Amendment immunity bars this action because\nthe LRA, and therefore the State of Louisiana, “not Keegan, is the real party in interest in this\nsuit.” Keegan Opp’n at 13. But the Ex parte Young exception to sovereign immunity permits\nsuits against state officers by relying on “the fiction that the suit [goes] against the officer and not\nthe State,” Vann v. Kempthorne, 534 F.3d 741, 749 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (citing Pennhurst State Sch.\n& Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 114 n.25 (1984)), and the Court disagrees with Keegan’s\ncontention that this fiction does not operate here.\n        9\n                The Eleventh Amendment provides that “[t]he Judicial power of the United States\nshall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against\none of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign\nState.” U.S. CONST . amend. XI. The Supreme Court “long ago held that the Amendment bars\nsuits against a State by citizens of that same State as well.” Papasan, 478 U.S. at 276 (citing\nHans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1 (1890)).\n\n                                                   9\n\f(3d ed. 2007)). The Supreme Court has directed that “[i]n determining whether the doctrine of\n\nEx parte Young avoids an Eleventh Amendment bar to suit, a court need only conduct a\n\n‘straightforward inquiry into whether [the] complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law\n\nand seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.’” Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv.\n\nComm’n, 535 U.S. 635, 645 (2002) (quoting Idaho v. Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U.S.\n\n261, 296 (1997) (O’Connor, J., concurring)). In this context, the distinction between retroactive\n\nand prospective relief is significant because the Eleventh Amendment bars “a suit by private\n\nparties seeking to impose a liability which must be paid from public funds in the state treasury.”\n\nEdelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 663 (1974) (citations omitted); see also Verizon Md. Inc., 535\n\nU.S. at 645 (making clear that relief that “impose[s] upon the State ‘a monetary loss resulting\n\nfrom a past breach of a legal duty on the part of the defendant state officials’” is not permissible\n\n(quoting Edelman, 415 U.S. at 668) (emphasis removed)). In other words, this Court cannot\n\norder the payment of damages to correct a prior unlawful act by a state official. See Edelman,\n\n415 U.S. at 663 (holding that a federal court may not issue an order that requires a state to spend\n\nmoney that “should have been paid, but was not”).\n\n       Based on these principles of law, the Court suggested in its Clarification, and now holds,\n\nthat it may not grant plaintiffs’ request for an order mandating that LRA make payments to Road\n\nHome Program beneficiaries who have already received funds in amounts calculated using an\n\nallegedly discriminatory formula. An order requiring Keegan to correct Road Home Program\n\npayments that have already been made would not provide prospective relief; it would require\n\npayment of state funds rather than prohibit certain actions in the future. Plaintiffs do not dispute\n\nthe Court’s reliance on these fundamental principles, but they contest the Court’s understanding\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fof the facts underlying this case and, therefore, its application of those principles to the situation\n\nat hand. The Court cannot agree with their arguments.\n\n               a.      The relief plaintiffs seek would require the expenditure of state, not\n                       federal, funds.\n\n         First, plaintiffs argue that the Court may enter the injunction they seek because such an\n\norder would require the expenditure of federal funds, not state funds. To demonstrate that this\n\ndistinction is legally significant, plaintiffs rely primarily on Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651\n\n(1974), quoting the many instances in that opinion in which the Supreme Court discussed the\n\nsignificance for an Eleventh Amendment analysis of requiring the payment of “state funds,” and\n\nthey repeat language from other cases relying on Edelman for the proposition that it is\n\nimpermissible for a federal court to impose a liability to be paid from the “state treasury.” Pls.’\n\nResp. to Clarification at 8-9.10 They assert that because the LRA spends money that comes\n\ndirectly from HUD at Congress’s direction, the funds they wish the Court to order Keegan to use\n\nto correct award amounts do not belong to the state.\n\n       The Court does not find that the funds the LRA spends are federal. It simply cannot be\n\nsaid that an injunction preventing a state official from disbursing money according to a program\n\nadministered by her state agency controls only the flow of federal funds. Furthermore, a careful\n\nreading of Edelman reveals that the Supreme Court has made no distinction between money that\n\ncomes to a state account from the federal government as opposed to from some other source. In\n\n\n\n       10\n                Plaintiffs note in their reply to Keegan’s opposition to their motion that Keegan\nhas failed to address this point and argue Keegan has therefore conceded it. The parties have\neach made a multitude of arguments in addressing the various complicated issues raised in this\ncase, and neither has directly addressed each point made by the other. The Court will not assume\nthat any arguments are conceded.\n\n                                                  11\n\fEdelman, the plaintiffs had successfully demonstrated that Illinois’s administration of a welfare\n\nprogram, which was “funded by the State and the Federal Governments” and administered by\n\nstate agencies, the directors of which were the named defendants, violated certain federal\n\nregulations. Edelman, 415 U.S. at 653-56. The opinion held that the district court had properly\n\nenjoined the state officers from continuing to administer the program in a manner that violated\n\nthose regulations but had improperly ordered that individuals who received less than they were\n\nowed because of past violations be compensated. Id. at 664-65. The Supreme Court referred\n\nthroughout to state funds and the state treasury, generating the quotes to which plaintiffs have\n\npointed, but nowhere did it distinguish funds that the federal government gave to the state for the\n\nwelfare program from those the state contributed from its own resources. In other words, the\n\nopinion did not address the issue plaintiffs have raised and does not support plaintiffs’\n\narguments; the best inference to draw is that the Supreme Court considered federal money given\n\nto the state for administration of the relevant program to be state funds.11 For purposes of this\n\nanalysis, the money the LRA uses to make awards to Road Home Program beneficiaries are\n\nproperly considered state funds.\n\n\n\n\n       11\n                None of the other cases plaintiffs cite contribute to an analysis of this issue. See\nVerizon Md. Inc., 535 U.S. at 646 (distinguishing between an injunction that would require\npayment from a state treasury and one that imposed a financial liability on private parties); Quern\nv. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332, 337 (1979) (repeating language from Edelman but addressing only the\nquestion of whether ordering that a particular notice be sent to individuals who might have\nclaims against Illinois constitutes retroactive relief); Fla.

Treasure Salvors, Inc.,\n458 U.S. 670, 689-90 (1982) (reciting language from Edelman but addressing the propriety of a\nsuit against Florida based on the discovery of a sunken ship); Travelers Indem.

Bd. of\nDade County, Fla., 666 F.2d 505, 509 (11th Cir. 1982) (reciting language from Edelman but\naddressing whether the Florida board of education has Eleventh Amendment immunity under\ncertain circumstances not analogous to those here).\n\n                                                  12\n\f               b.      An injunction requiring the correction of Option 1 awards would\n                       impermissibly provide retroactive relief.\n\n       Second, plaintiffs argue that the relief they seek is prospective because the Road Home\n\nProgram is “continuing and open,” Pls.’ Resp. to Clarification at 11, and they therefore request\n\n“an end to [] present violation[s] of federal law,” id. (quoting Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265,\n\n278 (1986)) (alterations and emphasis in brief). They argue that in contrast to Edelman, in which\n\nthe defendant state officers had failed to pay benefits that correlated to discrete past time periods,\n\nthe Road Home Program “has an ever-changing current balance sheet for an incomplete\n\nprogram.” Id. Keegan asserts that correction of Road Home Program awards previously\n\ndisbursed would constitute retroactive relief.\n\n       The fundamental premise here, explained above, is not in dispute:\n\n       Relief that in essence serves to compensate a party injured in the past by an action\n       of a state official in his official capacity that was illegal under federal law is\n       barred even when the state official is the named defendant. . . . On the other hand,\n       relief that serves directly to bring an end to a present violation of federal law is\n       not barred by the Eleventh Amendment even though accompanied by a substantial\n       ancillary effect on the state treasury.\n\nPapasan, 478 U.S. at 278 (citations omitted). The Supreme Court has acknowledged that “the\n\nline between permitted and prohibited suits will often be indistinct,” id., but here, the outcome is\n\nunavoidable.\n\n       Plaintiffs’ characterization of the Road Home Program as ongoing does not persuade the\n\nCourt that an injunction requiring the recalculation of Option 1 awards would constitute\n\nprospective relief. It is true that the Road Home Program as a whole is not complete. But all but\n\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\f179 Option 1 grants have been distributed.12 It is also true that some Road Home Program\n\nrecipients have received funds in addition to their initial awards under Option 1. But those\n\nsupplemental grants were not based on any change to the formula for, nor did they constitute a\n\nrecalculation of, Option 1 awards. The allegedly discriminatory award amounts have, as to\n\nalmost all applicants, already been calculated and disbursed. Correcting them, even by entry of\n\nan injunction, would effectively constitute an award of damages. Cf. Papasan, 478 U.S. at 279\n\n(advising that “[i]n discerning on which side of the line [between prospective and retroactive\n\nrelief] a particular case falls,” a court is to “look to the substance rather than to the form of the\n\nrelief sought”). As was the case in Edelman, the program at issue here distributes discrete\n\nawards; it does not provide any ongoing service such that a “present violation” of law can be said\n\nto exist. Id. at 278; cf. Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 289 (1977) (holding that a court-\n\nordered program to remedy inequalities resulting from school segregation “fits squarely within\n\nthe prospective-compliance exception reaffirmed by Edelman” because it “enjoin[s] state\n\nofficials to conform their conduct to requirements of federal law” in the future operation of\n\nschools).\n\n        Were the Court to order, as plaintiffs request, that Keegan recalculate awards that have\n\nalready been distributed and make supplemental payments to homeowners whose awards would\n\nhave been greater had they not been based on home values, it would impermissibly be requiring\n\nthe state to disburse money that “should have been paid, but was not.” Edelman, 415 U.S. at\n\n\n\n        12\n                The Court asked plaintiffs during oral argument on this motion whether they\nwould wish to go forward with their request for a preliminary injunction if the Court were to hold\nthat the ultimate relief they seek is only available to those 179 individuals. Plaintiffs did not\nexpress a desire to limit their case to such a narrow group of Road Home Program beneficiaries.\n\n                                                  14\n\f664. It would impermissibly be doing more than “enjoining state officers from acting\n\nunconstitutionally.” Vann, 534 F.3d at 749. Although, as explained, the Court suspects that the\n\nOption 1 formula did violate the Fair Housing Act, this Court has no authority to remedy it in the\n\nway plaintiffs ask. Accordingly, the Court cannot find that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the\n\nmerits of their case.\n\n       2.      Plaintiffs have not shown that they will face irreparable injury absent the\n               entry of an injunction.\n\n       Plaintiffs argue that without an injunction, the LRA will be able to spend any or all Road\n\nHome Program funds and an insufficient amount of money would remain available to provide the\n\nultimate relief they seek. This reasoning relies on, among other assumptions, the premise that the\n\nLRA must hold approximately $516 million in order to comply with a future order from this\n\nCourt mandating the correction of the disparate impact of the Option 1 formula. Keegan\n\nresponds that the LRA has sufficient funds to comply with an order from this Court enjoining her\n\nfrom using the existing Option 1 formula in calculating the awards owed to the 179 remaining\n\nOption 1 applicants.\n\n       As explained above, the Court may not order the relief plaintiffs seek. There is no risk,\n\ntherefore, that any spending by the LRA will cause the irreparable harm plaintiffs foresee.13\n\n       3.      The injury to third parties that would result from the preliminary injunction\n               plaintiffs seek weighs strongly against granting plaintiffs’ motion.\n\n       Plaintiffs argue that other parties would not be harmed by the entry of the preliminary\n\ninjunction they seek. They note that non-class members whose Road Home Program benefits\n\n\n\n       13\n               As noted, plaintiffs’ counsel have declined to indicate that they wish to represent\nthe 179 applicants who have not yet received awards.\n\n                                                15\n\fmight be delayed by such an injunction would benefit overall if the LRA is ultimately made to\n\ncalculate future awards considering only the cost of repairs.\n\n        The Court will not find that third parties would not be harmed by the entry of an\n\ninjunction of the sort plaintiffs seek. Even though the preliminary injunction plaintiffs seek\n\nwould permit Keegan to disburse some Road Home Program funds, it would restrict her\n\nspending significantly. Each dollar the Court enjoined her from spending would be a dollar\n\nwithheld from a Louisiana resident who wants to repair or rebuild her home and who has been\n\nunable to do so in the five years since the storm damaged it. The Court notes that plaintiffs could\n\nhave initiated this case and sought preliminary relief long ago, before the Road Home Program\n\nwas almost complete and the funds almost depleted. And the Court will not ignore the fact that\n\nthe delay a preliminary injunction would cause is significant; discovery and a resolution on the\n\nmerits of this case could, and likely would, take years.\n\n        4.      The public interest in an injunction does not weigh in favor of either party.\n\n        Plaintiffs argue that it is in the public interest to remedy housing discrimination. Keegan\n\nargues that the public interest would not be served by delaying the distribution of funds under the\n\nRoad Home Program and that Louisiana citizens “continue to need and rely upon funding from\n\nthe Road Home” Program. Keegan Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. for TRO at 35.\n\n        Because both parties’ positions have merit, the Court finds that this factor does not weigh\n\nin favor of either party. Plaintiffs are correct that there is a strong public interest in preventing\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of race, and the Court takes seriously Congress’s intent to do so by\n\nenacting the Fair Housing Act. But Keegan is correct that there is a strong public interest in\n\ngoing forward with a program designed to repair a devastated area. As noted above, a\n\n\n                                                  16\n\fpreliminary injunction would cause significant delay in the distribution of Program funds to\n\npeople who have suffered long enough.\n\n       5.      Conclusion\n\n       The Court must balance these four factors against each other. Serono Labs., Inc. v.\n\nShalala, 158 F.3d 1313, 1318 (D.C. Cir. 1998). In sum, the Court has found that plaintiffs’ Fair\n\nHousing Act claim likely has merit but that plaintiffs do not have a strong likelihood of success\n\nin this action because the Court cannot grant the relief they seek. Furthermore, delaying the\n\nadministration of the Road Home Program would be harmful to Louisiana homeowners who still\n\nneed assistance. Although the Court is not unsympathetic to the ways in which the law operates\n\nin this instance to preclude the possibility of correcting what may well be a discriminatory\n\nformula, it is bound to apply the law as it stands and it must consider the effect its ruling here\n\ncould have on individuals who are not represented. For these reasons, the Court will not grant\n\nthe preliminary injunction plaintiff seek.\n\n                                        III. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, on June 29, 2010, the Court entered an order denying\n\nplaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction [#50].\n\n\n\n                                                               Henry H.

Plaintiffs seek an injunction requiring recalculation of Program\n\nawards to homeowners in New Orleans using a formula that does not have a disparate impact on\n\nAfrican Americans.\n\n       On June 29, 2010, the Court issued an order that denied plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary\n\nrestraining order and a preliminary injunction [#50] which sought to enjoin Keegan from\n\nspending surplus funds that remain available to the Road Home Program, or seeking any\n\nadditional Program funds from HUD, while this case is pending. This opinion explains the\n\nreasoning on which that order was based.\n\n                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n       In 2005, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused catastrophic damage to New Orleans,\n\nLouisiana, and other nearby places. In response, Congress created a block grant program to assist\n\nin recovery of the region, which it funded through three appropriations statutes. See Pub. L. No.\n\n109-148, 119 Stat. 2680, 2779-81 (Dec. 30, 2005); Pub. L. No. 109-234, 120 Stat. 418, 472-73\n\n(June 15, 2006); Pub. L. No. 110-116, 121 Stat. 1295, 1343-44 (Nov. 13, 2007). Pursuant to\n\nthese statutes and HUD regulations, the State of Louisiana was to receive $13.4 billion. See 71\n\nFed. Reg. 7666, 7666 (Feb. 13, 2006) (allocating $6.2 billion from the first appropriation to\n\nLouisiana); 71 Fed. Reg. 63,337, 63,338 (Oct. 30, 2006) (allocating $4.2 billion from the second\n\nappropriation to Louisiana); 121 Stat. at 1343-44 (appropriating $3 billion for supplemental\n\ngrants to Louisiana).\n\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\f       Louisiana designated approximately $11 billion of those funds for the Road Home\n\nProgram. The LRA, in consultation with HUD, developed the Program; HUD approved it and\n\ndisburses the money Congress has appropriated for it to the LRA; and the LRA administers it.\n\nUnder a portion of the Program called Option 1, an individual whose house was damaged by the\n\nhurricanes may choose to receive a grant to repair or rebuild her home.3 Each beneficiary of an\n\nOption 1 grant receives an award in the amount of either the value of her home before the storms\n\nor the cost of repairing her home, whichever is less, but not in excess of $150,000. Since\n\nplaintiffs initiated their suit, the LRA has created Additional Compensation Grants (“ACGs”),\n\nsupplemental awards available to Option 1 beneficiaries whose incomes are at or below eighty\n\npercent of the median in their areas. Regardless of the pre-storm values of their homes, these\n\nindividuals may receive ACGs such that their total awards from the Road Home Program reach\n\nthe cost of repairs to their homes, still subject to the $150,000 cap.\n\n       Since the Road Home Program’s inception, the LRA has distributed Option 1 awards to\n\ntens of thousands of homeowners. As of the time of the briefing regarding plaintiffs’ current\n\nmotion, only 179 individuals who applied for Option 1 grants had yet to receive their awards.\n\nThe LRA has money set aside to fund grants for those individuals, to continue to distribute ACGs\n\nto eligible individuals, and for other projects within the Road Home Program. The LRA is\n\ncurrently seeking approval to use much of the Program money not yet designated to a specific use\n\nfor “Action Plan Amendment 43,” a construction lending program designed to assist Road Home\n\n\n\n\n       3\n               The Program also permits homeowners to instead opt to receive smaller grants to\nobtain housing elsewhere in Louisiana or outside the state. The design and implementation of\nthose aspects of the Program are not at issue here.\n\n                                                  3\n\fProgram beneficiaries who have not been able to complete repairs to their homes. Keegan\n\nestimates that she has $554.5 million remaining in the Program budget.\n\n       Individual plaintiffs Gloria Burns, Rhonda Dents, Almarie Ford, Daphne Jones, and\n\nEdward Randolph are African Americans who own homes in New Orleans that were severely\n\ndamaged by Hurricane Katrina, and subsequent flooding, in 2005.4 Each applied for a Road\n\nHome Program grant under Option 1, and each received an award based on the pre-storm value\n\nof her or his home rather than the cost of repairing that home.5 Since receiving their initial\n\ngrants, Burns and Jones have been deemed eligible to receive ACGs such that their total awards\n\nwill amount to $150,000.\n\n       In their complaint, plaintiffs allege that the LRA’s reliance on home values in calculating\n\nawards “has a discriminatory disparate impact on African Americans living in historically\n\nsegregated communities.” Compl. ¶ 52. Specifically, they argue that because “African American\n\nhomeowners in New Orleans are more likely than white homeowners in New Orleans to own\n\n\n\n       4\n               The other plaintiffs, Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center, a non-\nprofit organization based in Louisiana, and the National Fair Housing Alliance, a non-profit\norganization based in Washington, D.C., are advocacy groups that, inter alia, oppose housing\ndiscrimination.\n       5\n                According to the complaint, Burns received $106,500, which was $89,000 less\nthan the cost of damage to her home and $43,500 less than the maximum she could have\nreceived; Dents received $88,534, which was $58,730 less than the cost of damage to her home;\nFord received $3,468, which was $156,073 less than the cost of damage to her home and\n$146,532 less than the maximum she could have received; Jones received $61,000, which was\n$45,262 less than the cost of damage to her home; and Randolph received $16,650, which was\n$173,193 less than the cost of damage to his home and $133,350 less than the maximum he could\nhave received. Compl. ¶¶ 61-65. Some of the awards are in amounts less than the pre-storm\nvalue of the home because the LRA deducts from each grant any amount of money the\nhomeowner has received as compensation for storm damage from her insurance company or\nanother source, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\n                                                 4\n\fhomes with lower values,” African-American recipients of Road Home Program grants are more\n\nlikely than white recipients to receive only the amount of the pre-storm value of their homes and,\n\nconsequently, to have a larger gap than white recipients between the amount of the grant and the\n\ncost of rebuilding. Compl. ¶¶ 54-57. This effect, plaintiffs assert, constitutes a violation of the\n\nFair Housing Act.6 Ultimately, plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, “including but not limited to\n\nordering Defendants to cease immediately their violation of Plaintiffs’ rights, and to remedy the\n\ninvidious effects of their violations by recalculating Road Home homeowner grants in a\n\nnondiscriminatory manner.” Compl. at 17.\n\n       At this time, plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction enjoining Keegan from spending any\n\nsurplus funds—that is, Program funds not already designated for the remaining 179 Option 1\n\nawards, ACGs, or any other specific use—until the merits of their case are resolved. They make\n\nthis request because Keegan will only be able to distribute recalculated awards, should plaintiffs\n\nprevail on the merits, if sufficient Road Home Program funds remain available for that purpose.\n\n       Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction is accompanied by evidence they allege\n\nsupports their allegation that the Option 1 formula has a discriminatory effect. Specifically, they\n\npoint to statistics from the U.S. Census showing that in New Orleans, homes owned by African\n\nAmericans have lower values, on average, than homes owned by whites. Pls.’ Mot. for TRO, Ex.\n\nP. They attached to their motion a study by PolicyLink, “a national independent research\n\n\n       6\n                 Specifically, Count I of the complaint alleges that defendants have (1) “made\nunavailable or denied housing to African American homeowners because of their race in\nviolation of” section 3604(a) of the FHA; (2) “discriminated against African Americans because\nof their race in the availability of, and in the terms and conditions of, real estate-related\ntransactions in violation of” section 3605(a) of the FHA; and (3) “failed to administer housing-\nrelated programs and activities in a manner that affirmatively furthers fair housing, in violation\nof” sections 3608(d) and 3608(e)(5) of the FHA.

Id. at 11-12; id., Ex. S. They also assert that Paul Rainwater, Keegan’s predecessor\n\nat the LRA, told a subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives that home values in\n\nAfrican-American neighborhoods tend to be lower than in white neighborhoods and that he was\n\n“sure” that African-American homeowners were more likely than whites to receive awards based\n\non the value of their homes than the cost of repairs. Id. at 15-16; id., Ex. N at 23-24. Finally,\n\nthey attach to their motion the declaration of Carol Johnson, president of a Louisiana mortgage\n\ncompany, who asserts she has expertise in the mortgage industry and that she has “observed that\n\nbecause of the formula employed, Road Home Program grant calculations result in homeowners\n\nin predominantly African American areas received lower grant awards than homeowners in\n\npredominantly White areas.” Id., Ex.

ANALYSIS\n\n       This court may issue a preliminary injunction only when the movant demonstrates: (1) “a\n\nsubstantial likelihood of success on the merits”; (2) “that it would suffer irreparable injury if the\n\ninjunction is not granted”; (3) “that an injunction would not substantially injure other interested\n\nparties”; and (4) “that the public interest would be furthered by the injunction.” Mova Pharm.\n\nCorp. v.

Plaintiffs Have Not Shown a Likelihood of Success on the Merits.\n\n       1.      Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they could likely make out a prima facie\n               case of discrimination in violation of the Fair Housing Act.\n\n       For the reasons explained below, the Court concludes that it may not provide the ultimate\n\nrelief plaintiffs seek and therefore should not grant the preliminary relief they currently request.\n\nBut the Court notes first that plaintiffs’ disparate impact claim under the Fair Housing Act\n\nappears to have merit. Although full analysis of the issues raised here is unnecessary, the Court\n\nfeels compelled nevertheless to briefly explain its reasoning.\n\n       Although the D.C. Circuit did not determine in 2922 Sherman Avenue Tenants’\n\nAssociation v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186654\"><a href=\"/opinion/186654/2922-sherman-ave-tnt-v-dc/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">673</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir. 2006), which of two possible\n\nstandards courts in this Circuit are to apply in assessing disparate impact claims under the FHA,\n\nsee id. at 680, the Court believes that the appropriate approach is the burden-shifting framework\n\nadopted by several other Circuits. Under this framework, “once the plaintiff demonstrates that\n\nthe challenged practice has a disproportionate impact, the burden shifts to the defendant to ‘prove\n\nthat its actions furthered, in theory and in practice, a legitimate, bona fide governmental interest\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fand that no alternative would serve that interest with less discriminatory effect.’” Id.

The statistical and anecdotal evidence they submit to the Court leads to a\n\nstrong inference that, on average, African-American homeowners received awards that fell\n\nfarther short of the cost of repairing their homes than did white recipients. Keegan’s attacks on\n\nthat evidence are unpersuasive. Plaintiffs need not make a showing at this stage of the\n\nproceedings, before discovery and when briefing is necessarily rushed, sufficient to prove the\n\nmerits of their case. Keegan neither demonstrates that plaintiffs’ statistics or logic is flawed nor\n\nprovides data about the administration of the Program that would show what effect the Option 1\n\nformula has had.

She has also offered no legitimate reason for taking pre-storm home values\n\ninto account in calculating Program awards. The Court does not take lightly that some African-\n\nAmerican homeowners received lower awards than they would have if their homes were in\n\npredominantly white neighborhoods. And, although the Court appreciates that all of the parties\n\nare committed to the rebuilding of a city that has suffered greatly, it is regrettable that this effort\n\nto do so appears to have proceeded in a manner that disadvantaged African-American\n\nhomeowners who wish to repair their homes.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   8\n\f        2.      Plaintiffs cannot prevail on the merits because this Court does not have the\n                authority to grant the ultimate relief they seek.\n\n        Keegan argues that regardless of the merit of plaintiffs’ discrimination claim, the Court\n\nlacks subject matter jurisdiction over this case because the Eleventh Amendment to the U.S.\n\nConstitution bars the Court from providing the relief plaintiffs seek. Her primary argument8 is\n\nbased on a legal premise the Court explained in some detail in a Clarification [#52] to an order it\n\nentered regarding a motion to dismiss Keegan filed before plaintiffs submitted their motion. For\n\nclarity, the Court again describes the legal background before addressing plaintiffs’ response.\n\n        The Eleventh Amendment bars suits against states absent the relevant state’s consent to\n\nbe sued.

In other words, this Court cannot\n\norder the payment of damages to correct a prior unlawful act by a state official. See Edelman,\n\n415 U.S. at 663 (holding that a federal court may not issue an order that requires a state to spend\n\nmoney that “should have been paid, but was not”).\n\n       Based on these principles of law, the Court suggested in its Clarification, and now holds,\n\nthat it may not grant plaintiffs’ request for an order mandating that LRA make payments to Road\n\nHome Program beneficiaries who have already received funds in amounts calculated using an\n\nallegedly discriminatory formula. An order requiring Keegan to correct Road Home Program\n\npayments that have already been made would not provide prospective relief; it would require\n\npayment of state funds rather than prohibit certain actions in the future.

The relief plaintiffs seek would require the expenditure of state, not\n                       federal, funds.\n\n         First, plaintiffs argue that the Court may enter the injunction they seek because such an\n\norder would require the expenditure of federal funds, not state funds. To demonstrate that this\n\ndistinction is legally significant, plaintiffs rely primarily on Edelman v. Jordan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108990\"><a href=\"/opinion/108990/edelman-v-jordan/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(1974), quoting the many instances in that opinion in which the Supreme Court discussed the\n\nsignificance for an Eleventh Amendment analysis of requiring the payment of “state funds,” and\n\nthey repeat language from other cases relying on Edelman for the proposition that it is\n\nimpermissible for a federal court to impose a liability to be paid from the “state treasury.” Pls.’\n\nResp. to Clarification at 8-9.10 They assert that because the LRA spends money that comes\n\ndirectly from HUD at Congress’s direction, the funds they wish the Court to order Keegan to use\n\nto correct award amounts do not belong to the state.\n\n       The Court does not find that the funds the LRA spends are federal. It simply cannot be\n\nsaid that an injunction preventing a state official from disbursing money according to a program\n\nadministered by her state agency controls only the flow of federal funds. Furthermore, a careful\n\nreading of Edelman reveals that the Supreme Court has made no distinction between money that\n\ncomes to a state account from the federal government as opposed to from some other source. In\n\n\n\n       10\n                Plaintiffs note in their reply to Keegan’s opposition to their motion that Keegan\nhas failed to address this point and argue Keegan has therefore conceded it. The parties have\neach made a multitude of arguments in addressing the various complicated issues raised in this\ncase, and neither has directly addressed each point made by the other. The Court will not assume\nthat any arguments are conceded.\n\n                                                  11\n\fEdelman, the plaintiffs had successfully demonstrated that Illinois’s administration of a welfare\n\nprogram, which was “funded by the State and the Federal Governments” and administered by\n\nstate agencies, the directors of which were the named defendants, violated certain federal\n\nregulations. Edelman, 415 U.S. at 653-56. The opinion held that the district court had properly\n\nenjoined the state officers from continuing to administer the program in a manner that violated\n\nthose regulations but had improperly ordered that individuals who received less than they were\n\nowed because of past violations be compensated. Id. at 664-65. The Supreme Court referred\n\nthroughout to state funds and the state treasury, generating the quotes to which plaintiffs have\n\npointed, but nowhere did it distinguish funds that the federal government gave to the state for the\n\nwelfare program from those the state contributed from its own resources. In other words, the\n\nopinion did not address the issue plaintiffs have raised and does not support plaintiffs’\n\narguments; the best inference to draw is that the Supreme Court considered federal money given\n\nto the state for administration of the relevant program to be state funds.11 For purposes of this\n\nanalysis, the money the LRA uses to make awards to Road Home Program beneficiaries are\n\nproperly considered state funds.\n\n\n\n\n       11\n                None of the other cases plaintiffs cite contribute to an analysis of this issue.

They argue that in contrast to Edelman, in which\n\nthe defendant state officers had failed to pay benefits that correlated to discrete past time periods,\n\nthe Road Home Program “has an ever-changing current balance sheet for an incomplete\n\nprogram.” Id. Keegan asserts that correction of Road Home Program awards previously\n\ndisbursed would constitute retroactive relief.\n\n       The fundamental premise here, explained above, is not in dispute:\n\n       Relief that in essence serves to compensate a party injured in the past by an action\n       of a state official in his official capacity that was illegal under federal law is\n       barred even when the state official is the named defendant. . . . On the other hand,\n       relief that serves directly to bring an end to a present violation of federal law is\n       not barred by the Eleventh Amendment even though accompanied by a substantial\n       ancillary effect on the state treasury.\n\nPapasan, 478 U.S. at 278 (citations omitted). The Supreme Court has acknowledged that “the\n\nline between permitted and prohibited suits will often be indistinct,” id., but here, the outcome is\n\nunavoidable.\n\n       Plaintiffs’ characterization of the Road Home Program as ongoing does not persuade the\n\nCourt that an injunction requiring the recalculation of Option 1 awards would constitute\n\nprospective relief. It is true that the Road Home Program as a whole is not complete. But all but\n\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\f179 Option 1 grants have been distributed.12 It is also true that some Road Home Program\n\nrecipients have received funds in addition to their initial awards under Option 1. But those\n\nsupplemental grants were not based on any change to the formula for, nor did they constitute a\n\nrecalculation of, Option 1 awards. The allegedly discriminatory award amounts have, as to\n\nalmost all applicants, already been calculated and disbursed. Correcting them, even by entry of\n\nan injunction, would effectively constitute an award of damages. Cf. Papasan, 478 U.S. at 279\n\n(advising that “[i]n discerning on which side of the line [between prospective and retroactive\n\nrelief] a particular case falls,” a court is to “look to the substance rather than to the form of the\n\nrelief sought”). As was the case in Edelman, the program at issue here distributes discrete\n\nawards; it does not provide any ongoing service such that a “present violation” of law can be said\n\nto exist. Id. at 278; cf. Milliken v. Bradley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109723\"><a href=\"/opinion/109723/milliken-v-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 289 (1977) (holding that a court-\n\nordered program to remedy inequalities resulting from school segregation “fits squarely within\n\nthe prospective-compliance exception reaffirmed by Edelman” because it “enjoin[s] state\n\nofficials to conform their conduct to requirements of federal law” in the future operation of\n\nschools).\n\n        Were the Court to order, as plaintiffs request, that Keegan recalculate awards that have\n\nalready been distributed and make supplemental payments to homeowners whose awards would\n\nhave been greater had they not been based on home values, it would impermissibly be requiring\n\nthe state to disburse money that “should have been paid, but was not.” Edelman, 415 U.S. at\n\n\n\n        12\n                The Court asked plaintiffs during oral argument on this motion whether they\nwould wish to go forward with their request for a preliminary injunction if the Court were to hold\nthat the ultimate relief they seek is only available to those 179 individuals. Plaintiffs did not\nexpress a desire to limit their case to such a narrow group of Road Home Program beneficiaries.\n\n                                                  14\n\f664. It would impermissibly be doing more than “enjoining state officers from acting\n\nunconstitutionally.” Vann, 534 F.3d at 749. Although, as explained, the Court suspects that the\n\nOption 1 formula did violate the Fair Housing Act, this Court has no authority to remedy it in the\n\nway plaintiffs ask. Accordingly, the Court cannot find that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the\n\nmerits of their case.\n\n       2.      Plaintiffs have not shown that they will face irreparable injury absent the\n               entry of an injunction.\n\n       Plaintiffs argue that without an injunction, the LRA will be able to spend any or all Road\n\nHome Program funds and an insufficient amount of money would remain available to provide the\n\nultimate relief they seek. This reasoning relies on, among other assumptions, the premise that the\n\nLRA must hold approximately $516 million in order to comply with a future order from this\n\nCourt mandating the correction of the disparate impact of the Option 1 formula. Keegan\n\nresponds that the LRA has sufficient funds to comply with an order from this Court enjoining her\n\nfrom using the existing Option 1 formula in calculating the awards owed to the 179 remaining\n\nOption 1 applicants.\n\n       As explained above, the Court may not order the relief plaintiffs seek. There is no risk,\n\ntherefore, that any spending by the LRA will cause the irreparable harm plaintiffs foresee.13\n\n       3.      The injury to third parties that would result from the preliminary injunction\n               plaintiffs seek weighs strongly against granting plaintiffs’ motion.\n\n       Plaintiffs argue that other parties would not be harmed by the entry of the preliminary\n\ninjunction they seek. They note that non-class members whose Road Home Program benefits\n\n\n\n       13\n               As noted, plaintiffs’ counsel have declined to indicate that they wish to represent\nthe 179 applicants who have not yet received awards.\n\n                                                15\n\fmight be delayed by such an injunction would benefit overall if the LRA is ultimately made to\n\ncalculate future awards considering only the cost of repairs.\n\n        The Court will not find that third parties would not be harmed by the entry of an\n\ninjunction of the sort plaintiffs seek. Even though the preliminary injunction plaintiffs seek\n\nwould permit Keegan to disburse some Road Home Program funds, it would restrict her\n\nspending significantly. Each dollar the Court enjoined her from spending would be a dollar\n\nwithheld from a Louisiana resident who wants to repair or rebuild her home and who has been\n\nunable to do so in the five years since the storm damaged it. The Court notes that plaintiffs could\n\nhave initiated this case and sought preliminary relief long ago, before the Road Home Program\n\nwas almost complete and the funds almost depleted. And the Court will not ignore the fact that\n\nthe delay a preliminary injunction would cause is significant; discovery and a resolution on the\n\nmerits of this case could, and likely would, take years.\n\n        4.      The public interest in an injunction does not weigh in favor of either party.\n\n        Plaintiffs argue that it is in the public interest to remedy housing discrimination. Keegan\n\nargues that the public interest would not be served by delaying the distribution of funds under the\n\nRoad Home Program and that Louisiana citizens “continue to need and rely upon funding from\n\nthe Road Home” Program. Keegan Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. for TRO at 35.\n\n        Because both parties’ positions have merit, the Court finds that this factor does not weigh\n\nin favor of either party. Plaintiffs are correct that there is a strong public interest in preventing\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of race, and the Court takes seriously Congress’s intent to do so by\n\nenacting the Fair Housing Act. But Keegan is correct that there is a strong public interest in\n\ngoing forward with a program designed to repair a devastated area. As noted above, a\n\n\n                                                  16\n\fpreliminary injunction would cause significant delay in the distribution of Program funds to\n\npeople who have suffered long enough.\n\n       5.      Conclusion\n\n       The Court must balance these four factors against each other. Serono Labs., Inc. v.\n\nShalala, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184662\"><a href=\"/opinion/184662/serono-labs-inc-v-ferring-pharm-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1313</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1318 (D.C. Cir. 1998). In sum, the Court has found that plaintiffs’ Fair\n\nHousing Act claim likely has merit but that plaintiffs do not have a strong likelihood of success\n\nin this action because the Court cannot grant the relief they seek. Furthermore, delaying the\n\nadministration of the Road Home Program would be harmful to Louisiana homeowners who still\n\nneed assistance. Although the Court is not unsympathetic to the ways in which the law operates\n\nin this instance to preclude the possibility of correcting what may well be a discriminatory\n\nformula, it is bound to apply the law as it stands and it must consider the effect its ruling here\n\ncould have on individuals who are not represented. For these reasons, the Court will not grant\n\nthe preliminary injunction plaintiff seek.\n\n                                        III. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, on June 29, 2010, the Court entered an order denying\n\nplaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction [#50].\n\n\n\n                                                               Henry H. Kennedy, Jr.\n                                                               United States District Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                                 17\n\f</pre>",
