Separate removal proceedings commenced\nin October 2003 and were later consolidated. Petitioners conceded removability and\napplied for asylum and withholding of removal, claiming each would be persecuted\non account of their Romani (gypsy) ethnicity if returned to Hungary. After a hearing,\nthe Immigration Judge (“IJ”) denied the asylum applications as untimely, denied\nwithholding of removal on the merits, and ordered Petitioners removed to Hungary.\n\fThe Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) affirmed in separate, brief opinions.\nPetitioners seek judicial review of their final orders of removal. See 8 U.S.C. §\n1252(b). We consolidated and now deny the petitions for review.\n\n       Asylum. The BIA held that Petitioners are ineligible for asylum because they\ndid not apply within one year of entering the United States and failed to show\nextraordinary circumstances excusing this failure. See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2).\nPetitioners urge us to review these rulings but acknowledge our prior decisions\nholding that we lack jurisdiction to do so. See, e.g., Miah v. Mukasey, 519 F.3d 784,\n787 (2008). As a panel, we are bound by those decisions.\n\n       Withholding of Removal. The Attorney General may not remove Petitioners\nto Hungary if he decides “that [their] life or freedom would be threatened in that\ncountry because of [their] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\ngroup, or political opinion.” 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A). If Petitioners prove that they\nsuffered past persecution in Hungary on account of a protected ground such as race,\nthey are entitled to a rebuttable presumption of future persecution. See 8 C.F.R.\n§ 1208.16(b)(1). Absent a showing of past persecution, they must show a clear\nprobability of future persecution on account of a protected ground if they are removed\nto Hungary. See INS v. Stevic, 467 U.S. 407, 424-28 & n.19 (1984). This requires\nproof they will “more likely than not” suffer such persecution, which is a more\ndemanding standard than that for asylum. Compare 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(2), with\n8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(2)(B); see Alemu v. Gonzales, 403 F.3d 572, 576 (8th Cir.\n2005). Petitioners challenge the BIA’s adverse findings on these issues. We review\nthe agency’s fact finding under the deferential substantial evidence standard. Miah,\n519 F.3d at 787. In these cases, the findings of no past persecution are dispositive.\n\n      At the evidentiary hearing, Beck testified that, when he was growing up in the\n1970s and 1980s, he and other Roma students had to sit in the back of classrooms,\nwhere the teachers ignored them. Roma students were not allowed to join student\n\n                                          -2-\n\factivities or use playgrounds and were harassed by other students. As a teenager,\nBeck enrolled in trade school to become an electrician, where he received less\nattention from the teachers. Once, when Beck told a teacher that his roommates had\nspread feces in his living space and told him this was the proper habitat for Roma, the\nteacher laughed and ordered him to clean up the mess. After graduation, Beck applied\nfor numerous electrician positions but was rejected. He returned to his home town and\nworked at an agricultural cooperative.\n\n       Aranyi, too, suffered discrimination in school. She was forced to sit in the back\nof classrooms, was ignored and even beaten by teachers, and her classmates threw\nbooks at her, saying Roma did not need books. Aranyi entered nursing school, where\nshe was forced to sit in the back of classrooms and was barred from student activities.\nAfter graduation, her only job offer was to give enemas at a hospital. She was fired\nfrom that job when another employee lost a necklace, and the staff blamed Aranyi.\nLacking other job options, she moved back to her home town to work as a fruit and\nvegetable picker.\n\n      In 1994, after several years working in agriculture, Beck and Aranyi, now\nmarried, moved to Budapest. Beck unsuccessfully sought work as an electrician. He\nworked as a dishwasher and then did manual work in an agricultural neighborhood\noutside the city. Aranyi was told by many employers they did not hire Roma. She\nwas eventually hired by a sporting goods store but left or was terminated after the\nmanager demeaned and threatened her when she complained of sexual harassment by\na supervisor. She found another job but was accused of stealing money and fired.\n\n       Both Petitioners testified to being physically assaulted by “skinheads” because\nthey are Roma. In 1995, Aranyi was attacked by two skinheads while waiting at a bus\nstop. They called her a “dirty whore” and pushed her to the ground, causing a minor\nhead injury. She filed a police report, but the investigation was closed when the police\ncould not find the suspects. In 1998, Beck was waiting at a bus stop when two\n\n                                          -3-\n\fskinheads attacked him with a baseball bat, declaring that Romani people should\nreturn to India, their ancestral home. He suffered broken ribs and skin lesions and\nneeded knee surgery. Witnesses mocked him and fled the scene. Beck filed a police\nreport, but the police eventually notified him that they were discontinuing the\ninvestigation because they could not find the culprits. In 2000, Beck and Aranyi were\nin a line for food when Beck was pushed and kicked and told to go to a pigsty, where\ngypsies belong. When Beck refused to leave the line, he was hit in the forehead,\nrequiring first aid. He reported the incident to a policeman, who “was very\nsympathetic and put a band aid over my injury.” Beck filed a police report, but again\nthe suspects were never found.\n\n       Based on Petitioners’ credible testimony and Department of State country\nreports, the IJ found “pervasive countrywide discrimination against Roma or gypsies”\nresulting in Petitioners being “relegated to lower societal and economic\nopportunities.” However, the IJ denied them withholding of removal to Hungary\nbecause Petitioners failed to prove past persecution or a clear probability of future\npersecution. The IJ found that the harassment and discrimination Petitioners suffered\nat school and at work did not rise to the level of persecution, the physical assaults by\nskinheads were criminal acts by persons not connected to the government, and the\npolice made significant efforts to investigate those crimes. The BIA affirmed the\ndenial of withholding of removal for the reasons stated by the IJ. Because the BIA\nadopted the IJ’s reasoning, we review both decisions as the final agency action. See\nFalaja v. Gonzales, 418 F.3d 889, 894 (8th Cir. 2005).\n\n       Petitioners argue that the skinhead physical assaults established past\npersecution. However, Petitioners could not identify their attackers to the police and\nsubmitted no evidence that the government directed or condoned the assaults, or that\nthe police failed to act on their reports of these crimes. Rather, the police accepted\nPetitioners’ reports, investigated the incidents, and notified Petitioners that the\nsuspects could not be found. In these circumstances, substantial evidence supports the\n\n                                          -4-\n\fBIA’s finding that Petitioners failed to prove that the assaults were either condoned\nby the government or were committed by private actors “that the government was\nunwilling or unable to control.” Menjivar v. Gonzales, 416 F.3d 918, 921 (8th Cir.\n2005) (quotation omitted).\n\n        Petitioners further argue that the workplace discrimination they suffered on\naccount of their Romani ethnicity was the kind of “severe economic deprivation” that\nrises to the level of non-physical persecution. Petitioners rely primarily on In re T-Z-,\n24 I & N Dec. 163, 170-75 (BIA 2007), a decision issued some months after the BIA’s\nrulings in these cases that clarified the agency’s standard for evaluating claims of\neconomic persecution. In their Notice of Appeal to the BIA, however, Petitioners\ninstead argued that their testimony described economic persecution that met the\npersecution standard of the Sixth Circuit in Ouda v. INS, 324 F.3d 445, 454 (6th Cir.\n2003), where the court held that “[p]ersecution can include threats to life and\neconomic restrictions so severe that they constitute a real threat to life or freedom”\n(quotation omitted). That standard was consistent with many prior decisions of this\ncourt. See Makatengkeng v. Gonzales, 495 F.3d 876, 882-84 (8th Cir. 2007); Ahmed\nv. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d 1011, 1014 (8th Cir. 2005); Fisher v. INS, 291 F.3d 491, 497\n(8th Cir. 2002). Petitioners have failed to persuade us that the BIA’s subsequent\ndecision in T-Z- reflected a change in the agency’s governing standard that requires\na remand. See Makatengkeng, 495 F.3d at 883.\n\n       Substantial evidence supports the BIA’s finding that Petitioners failed to meet\nthis rigorous standard. Being relegated to low-level jobs despite their advanced\nschooling reflected unfair prejudice and discrimination, but private employment was\navailable, so the economic discrimination was not “sufficiently harsh to constitute a\nthreat to life or freedom.” Ahmed, 396 F.3d at 1014. As the Seventh Circuit stated\nin rejecting a Bulgarian Roma’s claim of persecution in Mitreva v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d\n761, 764 (7th Cir. 2005), “An individual who earns a degree and finds work has no\nclaim of economic persecution.”\n\n                                          -5-\n\f       For these reasons, each Petitioner has failed to prove past physical or economic\npersecution. For the same reasons, substantial evidence supports the BIA’s findings\nthat they failed to show a clear probability of future persecution if they are removed\nto Hungary. Moreover, the State Department has reported that the Hungarian\ngovernment actively examines allegations of discrimination against the Romani\ncommunity, fines institutions that segregate or ban Roma, and is considering an\naffirmative action law. In this governmental environment, the likelihood of future\neconomic persecution is reduced.\n\n      We deny the petitions for review.\n                     ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f",

In their Notice of Appeal to the BIA, however, Petitioners\ninstead argued that their testimony described economic persecution that met the\npersecution standard of the Sixth Circuit in Ouda v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781412\"><a href=\"/opinion/781412/sahar-ouda-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">324</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 454 (6th Cir.\n2003), where the court held that “[p]ersecution can include threats to life and\neconomic restrictions so severe that they constitute a real threat to life or freedom”\n(quotation omitted). That standard was consistent with many prior decisions of this\ncourt. See Makatengkeng v.

Petitioners have failed to persuade us that the BIA’s subsequent\ndecision in T-Z- reflected a change in the agency’s governing standard that requires\na remand. See Makatengkeng, 495 F.3d at 883.\n\n       Substantial evidence supports the BIA’s finding that Petitioners failed to meet\nthis rigorous standard. Being relegated to low-level jobs despite their advanced\nschooling reflected unfair prejudice and discrimination, but private employment was\navailable, so the economic discrimination was not “sufficiently harsh to constitute a\nthreat to life or freedom.” Ahmed, 396 F.3d at 1014. As the Seventh Circuit stated\nin rejecting a Bulgarian Roma’s claim of persecution in Mitreva v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791293\"><a href=\"/opinion/791293/valentina-mitreva-v-alberto-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">761</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 764 (7th Cir. 2005), “An individual who earns a degree and finds work has no\nclaim of economic persecution.”\n\n                                          -5-\n\f       For these reasons, each Petitioner has failed to prove past physical or economic\npersecution. For the same reasons, substantial evidence supports the BIA’s findings\nthat they failed to show a clear probability of future persecution if they are removed\nto Hungary. Moreover, the State Department has reported that the Hungarian\ngovernment actively examines allegations of discrimination against the Romani\ncommunity, fines institutions that segregate or ban Roma, and is considering an\naffirmative action law. In this governmental environment, the likelihood of future\neconomic persecution is reduced.\n\n      We deny the petitions for review.\n                     ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f</pre>",
