Makena was approved in 2011 for use by pregnant\n\nwomen with a history of preterm birth to reduce the risk that they would experience another\n\npreterm birth. Plaintiffs have sued the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), its\n\nCommissioner Margaret A. Hamburg, the United States Department of Health & Human\n\nServices (“HHS”), and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, alleging that defendants are violating\n\nthe Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) and several provisions of the Food, Drug, and\n\nCosmetic Act (“FDCA”) by failing to take action against pharmacies that compound the drug\n\nand thereby creating a cheaper alternative for doctors to prescribe. The compounded form of the\n\ndrug is referred to as “17P” in this action.\n\n       In particular, plaintiffs challenge a March 30, 2011 press release in which FDA\n\nannounced its intention not to take enforcement action against the compounders except under\n\ncertain circumstances. They also challenge FDA’s failure to block foreign shipments of the\n\factive pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) used in 17P from entering the United States.\n\nAccording to plaintiffs, FDA’s actions have given rise to unlawful competition with Makena and\n\ncaused them irreparable economic harm.\n\n       Defendants have moved to dismiss the action under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\n\n12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). [Dkt. # 7]. They argue that plaintiffs lack standing, and that the actions\n\nthey challenge are the types of discretionary enforcement decisions that the Supreme Court\n\nfound to be unreviewable in Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821 (1985). Alternatively, they argue\n\nthat the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The Court concludes\n\nthat Counts I through III of the complaint challenge FDA’s discretionary enforcement activities\n\nand therefore assert unreviewable claims, and that Count IV fails to state a claim under Rule\n\n12(b)(6).\n\n\n                                        BACKGROUND\n\n       Plaintiff KV is the owner of the drug Makena, which has been approved by the FDA.\n\nCompl. ¶ 24. Plaintiff Ther-RX is a “wholly-owned subsidiary of KV [that] markets, sells, and\n\ndistributes Makena on behalf of KV.” Id. ¶ 25. On January 25, 2007, FDA designated Makena\n\nas an “orphan drug” to be used for the prevention of preterm birth in women who have a\n\nsingleton pregnancy and a history of prior preterm delivery. 1 Id. ¶¶ 50–51.\n\n       Under the Orphan Drug Act, 21 U.S.C. §§ 360aa–ee (“ODA”), an “orphan drug” is a\n\ndrug used to treat a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United\n\nStates. Compl. ¶ 36. Congress passed the ODA in 1983, as an amendment to the Federal Food,\n\n1      Although now named “Makena,” the drug was named “Gestiva” when its application was\nsubmitted to FDA for approval. Compl. ¶ 50. In addition, although now owned by KV, the drug\nwas owned by the company Adeza Biomedical at that time. Id. For the sake of convenience,\nhowever, the Court will refer to the drug as “Makena” and the owner as “KV” throughout this\nopinion.\n\n\n                                                2\n\fDrug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. § 301, et seq (“FDCA”). 2 The congressional findings reflect\n\nthat Congress sought to create incentives for the development of drugs for rare conditions. Pub.\n\nL. No. 97-414, § 1(b)(4), 96 Stat. 2049, 2049 (1983). Accordingly, when a drug receives the\n\nFDA’s orphan drug designation, section 360cc(a) of the OCA prevents the Secretary of Health\n\nfrom “approving another application under section 355 of this title . . . for such drug for [the\n\nsame] disease or condition” within seven years after the approval date of the orphan drug. 21\n\nU.S.C. § 360cc(a).\n\n       Makena, a hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection is the first drug approved by FDA to\n\nreduce the risk of preterm birth in women with a singleton pregnancy who have a history of\n\nsingleton spontaneous preterm birth. Compl. ¶ 1. Because it has been designated as an “orphan\n\ndrug,” its seven year exclusivity period began running on the day it was approved, February 3,\n\n2011. Compl. ¶ 14.\n\n       However, for a number of years before FDA approved Makena, women were treated for\n\nrisk of preterm birth with versions of hydroxyprogesterone caproate that were compounded by\n\nentities known as “compounding pharmacies” or “compounders.” Id. ¶ 9. According to the\n\ncomplaint:\n\n              Drug compounding is a process by which a pharmacist or doctor\n              combines, mixes, or alters ingredients to create a medication customized\n              to the needs of an individual patient. Compounded drugs generally are not\n              reviewed or approved by FDA. Compounded versions of 17P were not\n              and are not reviewed or approved by FDA; and, in general, their individual\n              formulations, manufacturing processes, labeling, and adverse-event and\n              treatment-failure histories were and are unknown to FDA. The facilities in\n              which the compounding occurred and continues to occur generally were\n              not and are not registered with or routinely inspected by FDA.\n\n\n\n2      Since this action was filed, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act,\nPub. L. No. 112-144, 126 Stat. 993 (2012), took effect, amending the FDCA. The provisions of\nthe FDCA at issue here were not changed by the amendments.\n                                               3\n\fCompl. ¶ 9.\n\n       When Makena was released, the media began reporting on its high list price of $1,500 per\n\ninjection, or up to $30,000 for a course of treatment. Id. ¶ 68. Plaintiffs allege that these reports\n\nwere misguided, see id. ¶¶ 69–73, but that the press accounts prompted members of Congress to\n\npressure FDA to make the 17P injection available at a lower price than the initial list price for\n\nMakena. Id. ¶ 74.\n\n       On March 30, 2011, FDA issued a statement for immediate release titled, FDA Statement\n\non     Makena. 3           FDA       Statement       (Mar.      20,     2011),      available      at\n\nwww.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm249025.htm                            (“March\n\nStatement”). The statement explained that FDA had approved Makena on February 3, 2011, and\n\nthat as a result, Makena obtained seven years of exclusivity under the Orphan Drug Act. Id. It\n\nfurther explained that for many years, a version of the active ingredient of Makena had been\n\navailable to patients whose physicians requested the drug from a pharmacist who compounded\n\nthe drug, and that FDA had generally exercised enforcement discretion with respect to those\n\ndrugs. Id. The March Statement went on:\n\n                       Because Makena is a sterile injectable, where there is a risk of\n               contamination, greater assurance of safety is provided by an approved\n               product. However, under certain conditions, a licensed pharmacist may\n               compound a drug product using ingredients that are components of FDA\n               approved drugs if the compounding is for an identified individual patient\n               based on a valid prescription for a compound product that is necessary for\n               that patient. FDA prioritizes enforcement actions related to compounded\n               drugs using a risk-based approach, giving the highest enforcement priority\n               to pharmacies that compound products that are causing harm or that\n               amount to health fraud.\n\n\n\n3      Although the complete press release is not attached to plaintiff’s complaint, it is\nincorporated by reference in paragraphs 75–94. Compl. ¶¶ 75–94; see Gustave-Schmidt v. Chao,\n226 F. Supp. 2d 191, 196 (D.D.C. 2002) (finding that a court may consider documents\nincorporated by reference in the complaint for a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6)).\n                                                 4\n\f                     FDA understands that the manufacturer of Makena, KV\n              Pharmaceuticals has sent letters to pharmacists indicating that FDA will\n              no longer exercise enforcement discretion with regard to compounded\n              versions of Makena. This is not correct.\n\n                     In order to support access to this important drug, at this time and\n              under this unique situation, FDA does not intend to take enforcement\n              action against pharmacies that compound hydroxyprogesterone caproate\n              based on a valid prescription for an individually identified patient unless\n              the compounded products are unsafe, of substandard quality, or are not\n              being compounded in accordance with appropriate standards for\n              compounding sterile products. As always, FDA may at any time revisit a\n              decision to exercise enforcement discretion.\n\nId.\n\n       In their complaint, plaintiffs do not mention the language in the press release that\n\nsuggests that the March Statement may have been prompted by their own actions. Instead, they\n\nallege that the March Statement was issued in response to public pressure about the price of\n\nMakena. Compl. ¶ 75. They further allege that some Medicaid programs have interpreted the\n\nMarch Statement as “authorizing the total displacement of Makena by compounded 17P.” Id. ¶\n\n86. 4 Plaintiffs assert that “numerous compounded versions of 17P (not customized for individual\n\npatients) have entered, re-entered, or remained on the U.S. market, some manufactured on a\n\ncommercial scale”; and that FDA is permitting unapproved 17P API to be imported into the\n\nUnited States. Id. ¶ 15. According to the complaint, many or all of the compounders of 17P use\n\nactive ingredients manufactured in China by establishments that have not been identified in an\n\napproved new drug application and are not inspected by FDA. Id. ¶ 89.\n\n\n\n\n4      The complaint also alleges that on the same day that FDA issued the March Statement,\nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), a unit of HHS, issued a coordinated\nstatement that allegedly “authorized and encouraged state Medicaid agencies to pay for\ncompounded 17P in substitution for Makena.” Compl. ¶¶ 17, 83.\n\n                                               5\n\f       Since issuing the March Statement, FDA has issued three additional press releases\n\nregarding Makena, Compl. ¶ 94, two of which are relevant to this action. 5 On June 15, 2012,\n\nFDA addressed safety concerns plaintiffs had raised about the 17P compounds, and it described\n\nthe enforcement approach it was following with respect to compounded 17P. It announced that it\n\nhad tested API from sixteen samples of 17P, and thirteen samples of compounded 17P prepared\n\nby eight different pharmacies, and that it had not identified any major safety problems. Updated\n\nFDA Statement on Compounded Versions of hydroxyprogesterone caproate (the active\n\ningredient       in       Makena)        (June        15,       2012),       available        at\n\nwww.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm308546.htm                          (“June\n\nStatement”). However, it also stated that “approved drug products, such as Makena, provide a\n\ngreater assurance of safety and effectiveness than do compounded products.” Id.\n\n       The June Statement further explained:\n\n                      The drugs that pharmacists compound (including compounded\n              hydroxyprogesterone caproate) are not FDA approved, which means they\n              do not undergo premarket review nor do they have an FDA finding of\n              safety and efficacy. Compounding large volumes of drugs that are copies\n              of FDA-approved drugs circumvents important public health\n              requirements, including the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act’s drug\n              approval provisions. Consumers and health professionals rely on the\n              Act’s evidence-based drug approval process to ensure that drugs are safe\n              and effective. For that reason, one factor that the agency considers in\n              determining whether a drug may be compounded is whether the\n              prescribing practitioner has determined that a compounded product is\n              necessary for the particular patient and would provide a significant\n              difference for the patient as compared to the FDA-approved commercially\n              available drug product.\n\n                     FDA emphasizes that it is applying its normal enforcement policies\n              for compounded drugs to compounded hydroxyprogesterone caproate.\n              The compounding of any drug, including hydroxyprogesterone caproate,\n              should not exceed the scope of traditional pharmacy compounding. As the\n\n\n5      Although these documents are not attached to the Complaint, they are incorporated into\nthe complaint by reference in paragraph 94. See Gustave-Schmidt, 226 F. Supp. 2d at 196.\n                                                 6\n\f              Agency has previously explained, FDA generally prioritizes enforcement\n              actions related to compounded drugs using a risk-based approach, giving\n              the highest enforcement priority to pharmacies that compound products\n              that are causing harm or that amount to health fraud.\n\nId.\n\n       Then, in a press release titled, Questions and Answers on Updated FDA Statement on\n\nCompounded Versions of hydroxyprogesterone caproate (the active ingredient in Makena), FDA\n\nprovided     further     clarification.            (June    29,     2012),     available    at\n\nwww.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm310215.htm (“Questions and\n\nAnswers”). It posed and answered the following questions:\n\n                     Will the agency take any enforcement action against\n              pharmacies compounding versions of hydroxyprogesterone caproate\n              products?\n\n                      The FDA may take enforcement action against compounding\n              pharmacies if warranted. The FDA makes its enforcement decisions about\n              compounded products on a case-by-case basis after considering the\n              particular facts at issue. As we explained in the June 15, 2012, statement,\n              the compounding of any drug, including hydroxyprogesterone caproate,\n              should not exceed the scope of traditional pharmacy compounding.\n\n                      Are pharmacies free to compound large volumes of\n              hydroxyprogesterone caproate as long as none of their drugs are\n              tested and found to be unsafe?\n\n                     No. The FDA does not consider compounding large volumes of\n              copies, or what are essentially copies, of any approved commercially-\n              available drug to fall within the scope of traditional pharmacy practice.\n              One factor that the agency considers in determining whether a drug may\n              be compounded is whether the prescribing practitioner has determined that\n              a compounded product is necessary for the particular patient and would\n              provide a significant difference for the patient as compared to the FDA-\n              approved commercially available drug product. . . .\n\n                     The FDA stated it is using a risk-based approach to\n              enforcement action against compounding pharmacies. The FDA also\n              stated that its investigation did not identify a major safety issue, so\n              does that mean that the FDA does not intend to take enforcement\n              action against the compounders of hydroxyprogesterone caproate?\n\n                                               7\n\f                          No. A risk-based approach to enforcement relates to how the FDA\n                   generally prioritizes its enforcement efforts. The FDA’s June 15, 2012\n                   statement should not be interpreted to mean that the FDA will take\n                   enforcement action only if the agency identifies a particular safety\n                   problem. We reiterate that the compounding of any drug, including\n                   hydroxyprogesterone caproate, should not exceed the scope of traditional\n                   pharmacy compounding.\n\nId.\n\n        Plaintiffs complain that none of these statements evince an agency plan to take\n\nenforcement action against those compounding and marketing 17P on a large scale basis as\n\nopposed to individually customizing it for patients for whom Makena is medically inappropriate.\n\nCompl. ¶ 94. They allege that notwithstanding FDA’s public statements, compounded versions\n\nof 17P are still actively being sold on the U.S. market. Id. ¶ 95. See also Plaintiffs’ Opposition\n\nto Def’s Motion to Dismiss and Reply Mem. in Support of Mot. for Temporary, Prelim., and\n\nPermanent Relief [Dkt. # 12] at 4–5 (“Pls.’ Opp.”) (“FDA has failed to date to take any action\n\nagainst the compounding of 17P. . . . In practical effect . . . FDA’s lack of enforcement against\n\nunlawful compounding of 17P has not changed; and because FDA has done nothing to change\n\nthe perception in the marketplace that it will not act against unlawful compounding of 17P, the\n\nunlawful compounding of 17P continues.”). In essence, what plaintiffs challenge is defendants’\n\nfailure to take enforcement action:\n\n                   The bottom line is that Defendants have done and, unless ordered by the\n                   Court, will do, nothing – nothing – to enforce the law against unlawful\n                   uncustomized compounding of 17P, unless and until FDA learns that\n                   patients have actually been harmed or defrauded by compounded 17P.\n\nPls.’ Opp. at 6.\n\n        Plaintiffs assert that FDA’s statements and inaction have undermined the exclusivity\n\nconferred with the orphan drug designation and devalued their substantial investment in the drug.\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fCompl. ¶¶ 95–99. The complaint alleges that KV is almost entirely reliant on the success of\n\nMakena to generate the cash it needs to finance its operations and to make obligatory debt\n\npayments, id. ¶ 95, and that the illegal production of 17P has displaced Makena in the market and\n\nsubstantially undercut plaintiffs’ sales, id. ¶ 96. Since the time the complaint was filed, plaintiffs\n\nKV and Ther-Rx have filed voluntary Chapter 11 petitions in the United States Bankruptcy Court\n\nfor the Southern District of New York. 6 See Notice of Filing for Bankruptcy Protection by K-V\n\nPharma. Co., Ther-Rx Corp. [Dkt. # 18] (Aug. 6, 2012).\n\n       Plaintiffs filed a four-count complaint in this Court on July 5, 2012, [Dkt. # 1], along with\n\na motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, [Dkt. # 2].\n\n           Count I alleges that FDA’s March Statement and the policy it sets forth violate\n           section 360cc(a) of the FDCA by effectively nullifying Makena’s statutory seven-\n           year period of market exclusivity. It further alleges that by issuing the March\n           Statement for the purpose of “support[ing] access to” HPC injection, FDA failed to\n           comply with the procedural requirements of section 360cc(a), in violation of the\n           APA, 5 U.S.C. § 558(c); section 360cc(a) of the FDCA, 21 U.S.C. § 360cc; and the\n           Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and\n           acted arbitrarily, capriciously, in an abuse of discretion, and in excess of its authority,\n           in violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)–(D). Compl. ¶¶ 103–09.\n\n           Count II alleges that the March Statement and the policy it sets forth are contrary to\n           section 353a of the FDCA and are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and\n           exceed FDA’s authority, in violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C). Compl.\n           ¶¶ 110–13.\n\n           Count III alleges that the March Statement and the policy it sets forth “approve,\n           authorize, invite, encourage, and permit the introduction, and delivery for\n           introduction, into interstate commerce of unapproved new drugs” in violation of\n           FDCA sections 355(a) and 301(d), 21 U.S.C. §§ 355(a), 331(d), and the APA, 5\n           U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C). Compl. ¶¶ 114–16.\n\n           Count IV alleges that by allowing the import of API for compounded 17P, FDA is\n           engaging in an ongoing violation of section 381(a) of the FDCA. Furthermore, the\n           March Statement “announcing implicitly that [FDA] would allow such imports” is\n\n\n6      The notice indicates plaintiffs’ view that the automatic stay provision in the Bankruptcy\nCode, 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)(1), does not stay this case. [Dkt. # 18]. The Court agrees.\n                                                  9\n\f           arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise not in accordance with\n           the law, in violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C)–(D). Compl. ¶¶ 117–25.\n\n        The complaint seeks a comprehensive regime of temporary, preliminary, and permanent\n\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief. It asks the Court to order defendants to withdraw the March\n\nand June statements in a formal announcement, and to discontinue the policy of non-enforcement\n\nthat was set forth in the March Statement. Compl. 42 ¶ 5(a). It requests that the Court order\n\ndefendants: to “take sufficient enforcement actions to stop the unlawful competition with\n\nMakena” by non-customized compounded 17P, id. ¶ 5(b); to report to the Court quarterly for one\n\nyear and semi-annually for the following two years the actions they have taken to terminate\n\nshipments of non-customized compounded 17P, id. ¶ 5(c); and to bar entry into the United\n\nStates, and release into domestic commerce, of any future shipments of foreign-manufactured\n\nAPI for use in compounding non-customized 17P except in certain specified instances. Id. ¶\n\n5(d).\n\n        After a telephone conference held on July 5, 2012, the Court consolidated the motion for\n\ntemporary restraining order and preliminary injunction with the merits and issued an accelerated\n\nbriefing schedule for a partial dispositive motion to be filed by defendants. Minute Order (July\n\n5, 2012). In accordance with that schedule, defendants filed the instant motion to dismiss under\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). In addition, this Court granted Alere\n\nWomen’s and Children’s Health, L.L.C. and several interested physicians leave to file an amicus\n\nbrief in support of defendants. [Dkt. # 11].\n\n                                   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        In evaluating a motion to dismiss under either Rule 12(b)(1) or 12(b)(6), the Court must\n\n“treat the complaint’s factual allegations as true . . . and must grant plaintiff ‘the benefit of all\n\ninferences that can be derived from the facts alleged.’” Sparrow v. United Air Lines, Inc., 216\n\n                                                 10\n\fF.3d 1111, 1113 (D.C. Cir. 2000), quoting Schuler v. United States, 617 F.2d 605, 608 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1979).    Nevertheless, the Court need not accept inferences drawn by the plaintiff if those\n\ninferences are unsupported by facts alleged in the complaint, nor must the Court accept\n\nplaintiff’s legal conclusions. Browning v. Clinton, 292 F.3d 235, 242 (D.C. Cir. 2002).\n\n    I.      Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n\n         Under Rule 12(b)(1), the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing jurisdiction by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992);\n\nShekoyan v. Sibly Int’l Corp., 217 F. Supp. 2d 59, 63 (D.D.C. 2002). Federal courts are courts of\n\nlimited jurisdiction and the law presumes that “a cause lies outside this limited jurisdiction.”\n\nKokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994); see also Gen. Motors\n\nCorp. v. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 363 F.3d 442, 448 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (“As a court of limited\n\njurisdiction, we begin, and end, with examination of our jurisdiction.”). Because “subject-matter\n\njurisdiction is an ‘Art[icle] III as well as a statutory requirement, . . . no action of the parties can\n\nconfer subject-matter jurisdiction upon a federal court.’” Akinseye v. District of Columbia, 339\n\nF.3d 970, 971 (D.C. Cir. 2003), quoting Ins. Corp. of Ireland, Ltd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de\n\nGuinee, 456 U.S. 694, 702 (1982).\n\n         When considering a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, unlike when deciding a\n\nmotion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the court “is not limited to the allegations of the\n\ncomplaint.” Hohri v. United States, 782 F.2d 227, 241 (D.C. Cir. 1986), vacated on other\n\ngrounds, 482 U.S. 64 (1987). Rather, a court “may consider such materials outside the pleadings\n\nas it deems appropriate to resolve the question whether it has jurisdiction to hear the case.”\n\nScolaro v. D.C. Bd. of Elections & Ethics, 104 F. Supp. 2d 18, 22 (D.D.C. 2000), citing Herbert\n\nv. Nat’l Acad. of Sciences, 974 F.2d 192, 197 (D.C. Cir. 1993); see also Jerome Stevens Pharms.,\n\n\n\n                                                  11\n\fInc. v. FDA, 402 F.3d 1249, 1253 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (finding that a district court can “consider\n\nmaterials outside the pleadings” to assess jurisdiction) (citations omitted).\n\n   II.      Failure to State a Claim\n\n         “To survive a [Rule 12(b)(6)] motion to dismiss a complaint must contain sufficient\n\nfactual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Ashcroft v.\n\nIqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Bell Atl. Corp. v.\n\nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). A claim is facially plausible when the pleaded factual\n\ncontent “allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the\n\nmisconduct alleged.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. “The plausibility standard is not akin to a\n\n‘probability requirement,’ but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted\n\nunlawfully.” Id. (internal citation omitted). “[W]here the well-pleaded facts do not permit the\n\ncourt to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged – but it has\n\nnot ‘show[n]’ ‘that the pleader is entitled to relief.’” Id. at 679, quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).\n\nA pleading must offer more than “labels and conclusions” or a “formulaic recitation of the\n\nelements of a cause of action,” id. at 678, quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, and “the tenet that a\n\ncourt must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal\n\nconclusions.” Id. In ruling upon a motion to dismiss, a court may ordinarily consider only “the\n\nfacts alleged in the complaint, documents attached as exhibits or incorporated by reference in the\n\ncomplaint, and matters about which the Court may take judicial notice.” Gustave-Schmidt, 226\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 196 (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  12\n\f                                            ANALYSIS\n\n   I.      Plaintiffs have standing to bring this action as their alleged injuries are\n           redressable.\n\n        A lack of standing is a defect in subject-matter jurisdiction. Haase v. Session, 835 F.2d\n\n902, 906 (D.C. Cir. 1987).       In order to establish constitutional standing, a plaintiff must\n\ndemonstrate that a case or controversy exists by showing that (1) he has suffered an “injury in\n\nfact”; (2) that the injury is “fairly traceable” to the conduct of the defendant; and (3) that it is\n\nlikely that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. George v. Napolitano, 693 F.\n\nSupp. 2d. 125, 129–30 (D.D.C. 2010), citing Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs.,\n\n528 U.S. 167, 180–81 (2000). Defendants challenge plaintiffs’ standing under the third prong:\n\nredressability.\n\n        To satisfy the redressability requirement of jurisdictional standing, a court must find that\n\nit is “likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable\n\ndecision” on the merits. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561, quoting Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rights Org.,\n\n426 U.S. 26, 38, 43 (1976) (quotation marks omitted). An injury is not redressable where the\n\n“only apparent avenue of redress for plaintiffs’ claimed injuries . . . is unavailable.” Newdow v.\n\nRoberts, 603 F.3d 1002, 1013 (D.C. Cir. 2010).\n\n        Plaintiffs’ claimed injury is the loss of their market exclusivity, and the attendant profits,\n\ndue to unlawful competition from non-customized compounded 17P. Pls.’ Opp. at 9. To remedy\n\nthis injury, plaintiffs ask the Court to order FDA to take enforcement actions against the\n\nunlawful compounders. Id. This, plaintiffs argue, would greatly diminish, or eliminate, the\n\nsupply of unlawful 17P on the market. Id. at 16. As a result, Makena sales would rise,\n\nincreasing revenue for KV and Ther-Rx. Id. Medicaid agencies, in particular, would have to\n\nchange their policies as to Makena if the supply of compounded 17P were to diminish. Id.\n\n                                                 13\n\f        Plaintiffs point to several enforcement mechanisms that FDA is authorized to, and\n\nindeed does, use against unlawful compounders, such as issuing warning letters; imposing import\n\nalerts; referring violators to the Department of Justice for a proposed civil action for seizure of\n\nthe unlawful compound, for an injunction, or for criminal prosecution. Pls.’ Opp. at 9–14.\n\nWhile nothing ensures that these enforcement actions will induce all 17P compounders to stop\n\ntheir unlawful production, the Court is satisfied that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to\n\nsupport the inference that enforcement tools at FDA’s disposal would be “likely” to at least\n\nreduce the presence of compounded 17P on the market, which would compel more health care\n\nprofessionals to use Makena, or prompt insurers that have adopted policies favoring use of\n\ncompounded 17P over Makena to ease those policies. See Compl. ¶ 19 (explaining that “some\n\nstate Medicaid agencies have adopted policies” that make it challenging for pregnant women to\n\ngain access to Makena and favoring 17P compounds); see also Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561 (“At the\n\npleading stage, general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant’s conduct may\n\nsuffice, for on a motion to dismiss we presume that general allegations embrace those specific\n\nfacts that are necessary to support the claim.”) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n       Defendants argue that plaintiffs’ injuries are not redressable because FDA’s decision\n\nwhether to take enforcement action is committed to the agency’s discretion. Defs.’ Mem. in\n\nSupport of Defs.’ Mot to Dismiss and in Opp. to Pls.’ Mot. for Injunctive Relief [Dkt. # 7] at 15\n\n(“Defs.’ Mem.”). But this argument imports the examination of the reviewability of the agency’s\n\ndecision into the redressability inquiry. For that reason, the cases defendants cite in support of\n\nthe argument are distinguishable from this case. Chaney, 470 U.S. at 821, Block v. SEC, 50 F.3d\n\n\n\n\n                                                14\n\f1078 (D.C. Cir. 1995), and Coker v. Sullivan, 902 F.2d 84 (D.C. Cir. 1990) all concern the\n\nreviewability of an agency’s enforcement decision and make no mention of redressability. 7\n\n        In the final case that plaintiffs cite, Judicial Watch, Inc. v. National Archives and\n\nRecords Administration, 845 F. Supp. 2d 288 (D.D.C. 2012), the plaintiffs asked the Court to\n\norder the National Archives and Records Administration to take custody and control of\n\naudiotapes created by former President Clinton and still in the President’s control. Id. at 289–90.\n\nThe Court found the plaintiff’s injury not redressable because the Archives had no authority or\n\nmeans to obtain the records from the President at all. Id. at 304 (“Ultimately, plaintiff conceded\n\nthat even an order deeming the materials to be Presidential records and directing the defendant to\n\nmake an effort to retrieve them would not bind the former President to produce them. . . . This is\n\nthe problem at the heart of the lawsuit that requires its dismissal.”). Here, the FDA has the\n\nmeans and the authority to bring enforcement actions that would likely decrease the incidence of\n\nunlawfully compounded 17P, so Judicial Watch is inapplicable. 8\n\n       Furthermore, plaintiffs have standing to challenge FDA’s alleged permission of the active\n\ningredient in 17P compounds to be unlawfully imported into the United States. Defendants do\n\nnot challenge FDA’s authority to reject shipments of drugs meant for import.            And since\n\nplaintiffs allege that “many (possibly, all)” compounders of 17P use active ingredient\n\nmanufactured abroad, Compl. ¶ 89, it is certainly likely that if FDA were to reject the imports of\n\nactive ingredient meant for unlawfully compounded 17P, the amount of the compound that\n\n\n7      Plaintiff also cites Norton v. S. Utah Wilderness Alliance, 542 U.S. 55, 64 (2004), but that\ncase involved the reviewability of agency inaction under the APA and did not address\nredressability.\n\n8      While it is the Department of Justice that has the ultimate authority to decide whether to\nbring enforcement proceedings in Court, see Pls.’ Opp. at 13–14, plaintiffs identify several other\nenforcement mechanisms within the FDA’s control. Id. at 9–13.\n\n\n                                                15\n\fpharmacies could create would drop, at least temporarily. This, in turn, would likely drive health\n\ncare professionals to use Makena, or at least drive insurers like Medicaid to reverse its policies\n\nregarding Makena. See Compl. ¶ 19.\n\n         Since plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to support standing, the Court proceeds to\n\ndefendants’ next argument: reviewability.\n\n   II.      The actions challenged in Counts I–III are not reviewable.\n\n         All four of plaintiffs’ claims ask the Court to review agency conduct under section 706(2)\n\nof the Administrative Procedure Act. 9 But section 701 of the APA precludes judicial review of\n\nfinal agency action, including refusals to act, when review is precluded by statute or “committed\n\nto agency discretion by law.” 21 U.S.C. § 701; see Chaney, 470 U.S. at 826.\n\n         Defendants contend that the Supreme Court’s decision in Heckler v. Chaney is\n\ncontrolling here, and that the challenged agency action is not subject to judicial review because it\n\nis committed to agency discretion. Defs.’ Mem. at 18–40, citing Chaney, 470 U.S. at 821. The\n\nCourt agrees.     In Chaney, the Supreme Court held that an agency’s decision not to take\n\nenforcement action is presumed to be immune from judicial review unless Congress has\n\nexpressed the intent to circumscribe agency enforcement discretion in the statute and provided\n\nmeaningful standards in the statute for defining the limits of that discretion. 470 U.S. at 834–35.\n\nIn this case, Congress has done neither.\n\n         In Chaney, a group of prison inmates sought to compel FDA to initiate an enforcement\n\naction with respect to the drugs used for capital punishment. Chaney, 470 U.S. at 823. Plaintiffs\n\n\n\n9        The Court notes that Count I of the complaint also alleges that FDA violated the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. However, plaintiffs\ndo not raise this claim in their motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction\nand do not defend it in opposition to plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss the action, so the Court will\ntreat it as conceded.\n                                                 16\n\finitially petitioned the agency directly, arguing that the use of those drugs violated prohibitions\n\nin the FDCA against misbranding and constituted the unapproved use of an approved drug. Id. at\n\n824. They also argued that the FDCA’s requirements for approval of “new drugs” under section\n\n355 applied, but were not being followed. Id. Accordingly, the plaintiffs asked FDA to take\n\nvarious investigatory and enforcement actions to prevent the perceived violations, such as:\n\n               [A]ffix warnings to the labels of all the drugs stating that they were\n               unapproved and unsafe for human execution, to send statements to the\n               drug manufacturers and prison administrators stating that the drugs should\n               not be so used, and to adopt procedures for seizing the drugs from state\n               prisons and to recommend the prosecution of all those in the chain of\n               distribution who knowingly distribute or purchase the drugs with intent to\n               use them for human execution.\n\nId.\n\n       The FDA Commissioner responded by letter, refusing to take the requested actions. Id.\n\nThe letter explained, in part:\n\n               Generally enforcement proceedings in this area are initiated only when\n               there is a serious danger to the public health or a blatant scheme to\n               defraud. We cannot conclude that those dangers are present under State\n               lethal injection laws, which are duly authorized statutory enactments in\n               furtherance of proper State functions . . . .\n\nId. at 824–25. The plaintiffs then challenged this response in court under the judicial review\n\nprovisions of the APA, claiming the same violations of the FDCA and asking the Court to\n\nrequire FDA to take the enforcement actions they had requested in the petition. Id. at 825.\n\n       The Supreme Court held that “an agency’s decision not to prosecute or enforce, whether\n\nthrough civil or criminal process, is a decision generally committed to an agency’s absolute\n\ndiscretion” and is therefore presumed to be unreviewable under the APA. Id. at 831. The Court\n\nexplained that the availability of judicial review is determined by the legislature in the first\n\n\n\n\n                                                17\n\finstance, and that if Congress has not provided courts with “law to apply,” agency action will be\n\nconsidered to be committed to the agency’s discretion. Id. at 834.\n\n               If [Congress] has indicated an intent to circumscribe agency enforcement\n               discretion, and has provided meaningful standards for defining the limits\n               of that discretion, there is law to apply under § 701(a)(2), and courts may\n               require that the agency follow that law; if it has not, then an agency refusal\n               to institute proceedings is a decision committed to agency discretion by\n               law within the meaning of that section.\n\nId. (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court determined that the action at issue in Chaney\n\nwas committed to the agency’s discretion because the statute was “drawn so that a court would\n\nhave no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s exercise of discretion.” Id. at\n\n830. The Court reasoned:\n\n       [A]n agency decision not to enforce often involves a complicated balancing of a\n       number of factors which are peculiarly within its expertise. Thus, the agency\n       must not only assess whether a violation has occurred, but whether agency\n       resources are best spent on this violation or another, whether the agency is likely\n       to succeed if it acts, whether the particular enforcement action requested best fits\n       the agency’s overall policies, and, indeed, whether the agency has enough\n       resources to undertake the action at all. . . . The agency is far better equipped than\n       the courts to deal with the many variables involved in the proper ordering of its\n       priorities.\n\nId. at 831–32. A plaintiff may overcome the presumption that agency enforcement decisions are\n\nunreviewable only by showing that “the substantive statute has provided guidelines for the\n\nagency to follow in exercising its enforcement powers.” Id. at 833.\n\n       Here plaintiffs’ claims in Counts I through III fall squarely within the Chaney\n\npresumption of unreviewability.     Just as in Chaney, plaintiffs allege ongoing violations of\n\nsubstantive provisions of the FDCA, and they request that the Court order FDA to take\n\ninvestigatory and enforcement action to stop them. Compl. ¶¶ 103–116; pp. 40–43. A review of\n\nthe extensive prayer for relief demonstrates that this case is fundamentally an effort to get the\n\nCourt to direct and oversee the FDA’s enforcement activities, and that it cannot do.\n\n                                                18\n\f   A. Congress did not express an intent in the FDCA to circumscribe agency enforcement\n      discretion and it did not provide any law for the court to apply.\n\n        Under Chaney, the presumption of unreviewability can be overcome only if Congress\n\n“has indicated an intent to circumscribe agency enforcement discretion, and has provided\n\nmeaningful standards for defining the limits of that discretion.” 470 U.S. at 834. And Chaney is\n\ndirectly on point here because the Supreme Court was analyzing the very statute at issue in this\n\ncase.\n\n        In Chaney, the Court examined each of the enforcement mechanisms available to FDA\n\nunder the FDCA and found that “[t]he Act’s enforcement provisions . . . commit complete\n\ndiscretion to the Secretary to decide how and when they should be exercised.” Id. at 835. That\n\nfinding continues to be controlling today. So the only remaining question is whether there is\n\nsome other provision in the FDCA that would authorize the review that plaintiffs are seeking.\n\n        The Chaney plaintiffs pointed to substantive prohibitions in the FDCA, including the\n\nrules against misbranding in section 355, but the Court flatly rejected the notion that those\n\nsections supplied the necessary law to apply, saying: “These provisions are simply irrelevant to\n\nthe agency’s discretion to refuse to initiate proceedings.” Id. at 836. The Court finds that the\n\nsubstantive provisions cited in this case are similarly irrelevant.\n\n        Count I points to 21 U.S.C. § 360cc, which is the grant of exclusivity under the Orphan\n\nDrug Act. It provides that the Secretary “may not approve another application under section 355\n\nof this title” within seven years of approving an orphan drug, and identifies some exceptions to\n\n\n\n\n                                                  19\n\fthe rule. 21 U.S.C. § 360cc(a)(2). 10 Count II is premised upon section 353a, which exempts\n\ncompounded drugs from various provisions of the FDCA (including section 355 – the\n\nprohibition against the introduction of a drug into interstate commerce without FDA approval)\n\nunder particular conditions, such as when the drug has been compounded for an individual\n\npatient based on a valid prescription. 21 U.S.C. §353a. But neither of those provisions requires\n\nFDA to proceed against unlawful compounders – they don’t say a word about it. And Count III\n\nis based in part on section 355, which was the section considered and rejected by the Court in\n\nChaney. Section 355(a) states that “no person shall introduce or deliver for introduction into\n\ninterstate commerce any new drug,” without approval by FDA. 21 U.S.C. § 355(a). It is also\n\nbased on section 331(d), which states that “the introduction or delivery for introduction into\n\ninterstate commerce of any article in violation of” various sections of the FDCA, including\n\nsection 355, is prohibited. 21 U.S.C. § 331(d). So none of the cited provisions deal with the\n\nscope of the agency’s enforcement discretion at all.\n\n       Indeed, in their papers, plaintiffs did not point to any specific language in these statutory\n\nprovisions that supposedly expressed the legislature’s desire to limit the agency’s enforcement\n\ndiscretion or that could serve as the guide for a court’s review. Moreover, when asked directly at\n\nthe motions hearing, counsel for plaintiff would not concede the point, but he repeatedly failed to\n\ndirect the Court to any statutory provision that would satisfy the Chaney test and overcome the\n\npresumption. Tr. of Motions Hearing (Aug. 7, 2012) (“Tr.”) at 31–33, 36–38, 46. Accordingly,\n\n\n10      Plaintiffs cite section 360cc for the proposition that the FDA is prohibited from\n“approving (formally or in any other way), authorizing, inviting, encouraging, or generally\npermitting the introduction into interstate commerce of any compounded version of that same\ndrug product for the same orphan indication as to which the approved drug has been designated\nas an orphan drug.” See e.g., Compl. ¶ 104. But that language does not appear anywhere in that\nsection of the statute, so the citation is somewhat disingenuous. The only express direction to\nFDA in section 360cc is that the Secretary “may not approve another application under section\n355 of this title.” 21 U.S.C. § 360cc(a)(2).\n                                                20\n\fthis Court finds that Congress did not express an intent to circumscribe FDA’s enforcement\n\ndiscretion in the FDCA. And since the FDCA does not provide any law for the Court to apply,\n\nthe Court finds that FDA’s March Statement is unreviewable. 11\n\n       Plaintiffs emphasize the prospective nature of FDA’s pronouncement and argue that since\n\nit addresses future conduct, it constitutes an “affirmative public invitation” to compound 17P that\n\nis different from a mere failure to bring an enforcement action. Pls.’ Opp. at 39; Pls.’ Mot. for\n\nTemporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction (“Pls.’ Mot. for TRO/PI”) [Dkt. # 2] at\n\n37. However, the letter that the plaintiffs challenged in Chaney contained language nearly\n\nidentical to the operative language in the March Statement. The Chaney response letter stated\n\nthat enforcement proceedings are generally initiated only when there is a serious danger to the\n\npublic health or a blatant scheme to defraud, and that FDA could not conclude that those factors\n\nwere present under State lethal injection laws. Chaney, 470 U.S. at 824–25. Similarly here, the\n\nMarch Statement relays the factors FDA considers when deciding whether to bring enforcement\n\naction, and recites its current determination that those factors do not warrant action against\n\npharmacies that compound 17P for individual patients, except under certain conditions.\n\n       Plaintiffs also contend that they fall outside Chaney because they are only requesting that\n\nthe Court require FDA to take some enforcement action, and they are not asking it to specify the\n\ntype of enforcement action. Pls.’ Opp. at 23–24.         But this distinction does not save the case.\n\nPlaintiffs’ requests that the Court order “sufficient” enforcement action to restore plaintiffs’\n\n\n11      Perhaps because the statutory support is absent, plaintiffs argue vehemently that the\nCourt should grant relief in this case because “where agency action (or inaction) has harmed\nplaintiffs, it is well within the equitable powers of a court to order the specific relief necessary to\ncure the transgressions.” Pls.’ Opp. at 26–28. However, in light of the plain language of section\n701 of the APA and the clear direction provided by Chaney, the Court declines to find that\nFDA’s announcement of an enforcement decision that is well within its discretion constitutes the\ntype of harm that warrants equitable intervention.\n\n                                                  21\n\fcompetitive advantage and that it monitor FDA’s activities by requiring regular reports\n\ndemonstrate that they are asking the Court to get right smack in the middle of agency operations.\n\nDirecting the FDA to bring a particular sort of enforcement action, and a particular quantity of\n\nthose actions, is directing it how to allocate its finite enforcement resources – a decision that is\n\n“peculiarly within the agency’s expertise and discretion.” 12 Crowley v Pena, 37 F.3d 671, 677\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1994).\n\n   B. Plaintiffs cannot avoid the impact of Chaney by characterizing the March Statement as a\n      statement of agency policy.\n\n       Plaintiffs maintain that the case survives on the grounds that it is not actually about an\n\nenforcement decision. They cite Crowley v. Pena, 37 F.3d 671 (D.C. Cir. 1994), and argue that\n\n\n\n\n12      Plaintiffs’ argument that the March Statement is reviewable because FDA considered\nprice in deciding how to exercise its enforcement discretion – a factor that FDA may not\nconsider to determine whether a compound is legal under the FDCA – is also misguided. Compl.\n¶¶ 80–81. The March Statement does not express a view that 17P compounds are legal because\nMakena is too expensive. If that were the case, the statement might constitute a reviewable\nagency policy. Rather, the statement explains why FDA does not intend to bring enforcement\nactions against certain pharmacies, even if the pharmacies are engaging in unlawful conduct. It\nis exactly that exercise of discretion that Chaney and Crowley explained is presumptively\nunreviewable.\n\n                                                22\n\fthe case falls within an exception to Chaney for challenges to statements of agency policy.13\n\nPls.’ Opp. at 36–38. In Crowley, the D.C. Circuit confirmed that enforcement decisions are\n\npresumptively unreviewable. 37 F.3d at 676–77. However, it noted in dicta that “an agency’s\n\nstatement of a general enforcement policy may be reviewable for legal sufficiency where the\n\nagency has expressed the policy as a formal regulation after the full rulemaking process . . . or\n\nhas otherwise articulated it in some form of universal policy statement.” Id. at 676. Plaintiffs\n\nargue that FDA’s statement is reviewable because it sets forth a general policy, not a decision in\n\nan individual case. Pls.’ Opp. at 36–37. But the letter challenged in Chaney also involved a\n\nbroad class of alleged law violators, so the fact that the March Statement did not involve an\n\nindividual declination is not dispositive. More important, the March Statement is neither the\n\nformal result of a rulemaking process nor a universal policy statement, so the limited\n\ncircumstances that the D.C. Circuit said may call for a different result are not present here.\n\n       In Crowley, the D.C. Circuit noted that a statement might be reviewable if it “actually\n\nlay[s] out a general policy delineating the boundary between enforcement and non-enforcement\n\n\n13       At the motion to dismiss stage, the Court takes all the factual allegations in plaintiffs’\ncomplaint as true and makes all inferences that can be alleged from those facts in plaintiffs’\nfavor. See Sparrow, 216 F.3d at 1113. However, the Court need not accept the many legal\nconclusions asserted in the complaint or any inferences unsupported by factual allegation.\nBrowning, 292 F.3d at 242. For example, the Court need not accept plaintiffs’ conclusion that\n“FDA’s [March] Statement is not the exercise of case-by-case enforcement discretion as to past\nconduct, but, rather, addresses future conduct and announces a general policy that is binding on\nFDA personnel as long as it has not been revoked, and that approves, authorizes, invites,\nencourages, and permits an unlimited and unknown number of ‘compounders’ to distribute\nnationwide during plaintiffs’ exclusivity period and for an unlimited time and thereafter non-\ncustomized 17P intended to be used for the same orphan indication for which Makena is\napproved.” Compl. ¶ 80. Whether or not the March Statement is an exercise of enforcement\ndiscretion or a policy is a legal conclusion. And plaintiffs’ characterization does not quite square\nwith the language in the statement that “FDA does not intend to take enforcement action against\npharmacies that compound hydroxyprogesterone caproate based on a valid prescription for an\nindividually identified patient unless the compounded products are unsafe, of substandard\nquality, or are not being compounded in accordance with appropriate standards for compounding\nsterile products.” (emphasis added). March Statement.\n                                                 23\n\fand purport[s] to speak to a broad class of parties.” Crowley, 37 F.3d at 677. But this is a\n\nnarrow exception to the presumption. As the Court of Appeals explained: “This will not be true\n\nin the ordinary case, however, and the more reasonable inference when faced with a context-\n\nbound non-enforcement pronouncement is that the agency has addressed the issue in\n\ncomparatively ad hoc terms inherently implicating its non-reviewable enforcement discretion.”\n\nId. As the court predicted, that is the appropriate inference to be drawn here, as there is no clear\n\ndemarcation set out in the statement at issue.\n\n       The language in the March Statement that animates the plaintiffs – that “FDA does not\n\nintend to take enforcement action against pharmacies” – does not constitute an announcement of\n\npolicy that would differentiate this case from Chaney. March Statement. In Chaney, FDA’s\n\nintention not to take enforcement action against states using the challenged drugs for lethal\n\ninjections was implicit in its denial of the plaintiffs’ petition. Chaney, 470 U.S. at 837–38.\n\nStates could have viewed it, as plaintiffs suggest here, as a “green light” to continue their\n\nallegedly illegal behavior. Yet, the Supreme Court still found the decision enunciated in the\n\nletter to be unreviewable. Id.\n\n       Moreover, here, FDA did not disavow an intention to proceed against compounding\n\npharmacies as a general matter. What it said was: “FDA does not intend to take enforcement\n\naction against pharmacies that compound . . . based on a valid prescription for an individually\n\nidentified patient unless the compounded products are unsafe . . . .” March Statement (emphasis\n\nadded). Inherent in that statement is a consideration of the individual circumstances of each\n\ncase: was there a valid prescription for an individually identified patient? So, contrary to\n\nplaintiff’s assertion, the March Statement is not a universal policy statement “setting forth FDA’s\n\ndecision not to regulate the class of noncustomized compounded products that contain 17P (or\n\n\n\n                                                 24\n\fwhat purports to be 17P) . . . .” Pls.’ Opp. at 19. Furthermore, the March Statement was simply\n\na statement of present intent and it included the caveat, “[a]s always, FDA may at any time\n\nrevisit a decision to exercise enforcement discretion.” March Statement (emphasis added). It\n\ndoes not bind FDA to any future action or inaction, and does not lay out any discrete boundary\n\nbetween enforcement and non-enforcement.         It is the sort of ad hoc, context-bound non-\n\nenforcement pronouncement that the Crowley court suggested would inherently implicate an\n\nagency’s unreviewable enforcement discretion. Crowley, 37 F.3d at 677.\n\n       This case is also distinguishable from those precedents where the courts were willing to\n\nadopt the Crowley approach. In Crowley, the Court of Appeals observed that expressions of\n\nbroad enforcement policy are more likely to be direct interpretations of the commands of the\n\nsubstantive statue rather than the sort of mingled assessments of fact, policy, and law that drive\n\nan individual enforcement decision and are peculiarly within the agency’s expertise and\n\ndiscretion.   Crowley, 37 F.3d at 677.     Thus, in the cases where courts have reviewed an\n\nenforcement policy, they have emphasized that their review was limited to the question of\n\nwhether or not the agency’s express statement of policy unlawfully construed a statute. See, e.g.,\n\nOSG Bulk Ships, Inc. v. United States, 132 F.3d 808, 812 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (considering the pure\n\nquestion of statutory interpretation of whether the agency’s interpretation of section 506 of the\n\nMerchant Marine Act of 1936 – permitting certain vessels built with federal aid for service in\n\nforeign trade to be used for domestic trade after the expiration of its economic life – as a\n\nchallenge to agency policy and not as a decision not to enforce the statute’s ban on domestic\n\ntrade by that type of vessel); Edison Electric Institute v. EPA, 996 F.2d 326, 333 (D.C. Cir. 1993)\n\n(explaining that petitioners are challenging EPA’s interpretation of the statute and its\n\nimplementing regulations, which “clearly . . . [have] to do with the substantive requirements of\n\n\n\n                                                25\n\fthe law; it is not the type of discretionary judgment concerning the allocation of enforcement\n\nresources that [Chaney] shields from judicial review”); Roane v. Holder, 607 F. Supp. 2d 216,\n\n226–27 (D.D.C. 2009) (finding that “to the extent the plaintiffs are claiming that the defendants\n\nhave made a general statement about their policy of enforcement of the CSA with respect to\n\nfederal lethal injections divorced from any fact-specific enforcement decision, the plaintiffs have\n\nstated a claim outside the scope of the [Chaney] presumption against judicial review”); Alliance\n\nfor Bio-Integrity v. Shalala, 116 F. Supp. 2d 166, 171–72 (D.D.C. 2000), (“Although the Court\n\nmay not review FDA’s policy-laden individual enforcement decisions, the Court has jurisdiction\n\nto review whether or not FDA’s Statement of Policy comports with Congressional directives.”).\n\n       In this case, FDA’s press release does not purport to interpret the commands of the\n\nsubstantive statute. To the extent that it does convey some legal principle, plaintiffs concede that\n\nFDA’s interpretation of the FDCA is in line with theirs: uncustomized compounding of 17P is\n\nunlawful. Pls.’ Mem. in Opp. to Amici Curiae Brief [Dkt. # 14] at 2. The March Statement\n\nsimply assesses the considerations that have led it to anticipate that enforcement action against\n\nparticular compounding pharmacies will not be warranted. This is the type of analysis that the\n\nCrowley court found to be peculiarly within the agency’s expertise and discretion, and therefore\n\npresumptively unreviewable.\n\n       Along the same lines, the Crowley court also explained that agency policies – as opposed\n\nto enforcement decisions – might be amenable to review because agencies generally provide\n\nstatements of reasons when they formally announce broadly applicable guidelines, while\n\nstatements justifying individual decisions to forego enforcement tend to be cursory, ad hoc, or\n\npost hoc. Crowley, 37 F.3d at 677. “These latter cases confront courts . . . with the task of\n\n\n\n\n                                                26\n\fteasing meaning out of agencies’ side comments, form letters, litigation documents, and informal\n\ncommunications.” Id.\n\n       This reasoning also suggests that the March Statement is not subject to review. It is a\n\nshort summary of FDA’s position, which appears to have been issued to quell confusion\n\ngenerated by plaintiffs’ efforts to disseminate their own characterization of that position. March\n\nStatement (“FDA understands that the manufacturer of Makena, KV Pharmaceuticals, has sent\n\nletters to pharmacists indicating that FDA will no longer exercise enforcement discretion with\n\nregard to compounded versions of Makena. This is not correct.”).\n\n       At the hearing, plaintiffs argued that the press release qualifies as a Crowley policy\n\nstatement, noting that even less formal documents have been found to be subject to review. Tr.\n\nat 38–39, citing OGS Bulk Ships, Inc., 132 F.2d at 808 (agency letters); Center for Auto Safety,\n\nInc. v. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 342 F. Supp. 2d at 1 (D.D.C. 2004)\n\n(same); Chiang v. Kempthorne, 503 F. Supp. 2d at 343 (D.D.C. 2007) (informal guidelines). But\n\neven though the documents were “informal” in the sense that they were not subject to notice and\n\ncomment rulemaking procedures, they contained the elements the Crowley court described:\n\nexpress statements of generally applicable policy and explanations for the reasons behind the\n\npolicies. OGS Bulk Ships, Inc., 132 F.3d at 811; Center for Auto Safety, 342 F. Supp. 2d at 6–8,\n\n13; Chiang, 503 F. Supp. 2d at 347, 351–52. Thus, the courts were able to determine in those\n\ncases whether the agencies’ policies were in accordance with Congressional intent, and those\n\ncases are distinguishable from the situation here.\n\n       Finally, Crowley noted that it might be necessary to recognize an exception to the\n\npresumption of non-reviewability for statements of enforcement policy because an\n\nannouncement of a broad policy against enforcement poses special risks that the agency has\n\n\n\n                                                27\n\fconsciously and expressly adopted a general policy that is “so extreme as to amount to an\n\nabdication of its statutory responsibilities.” Crowley, 37 F.3d at 677, citing Chaney, 470 U.S. at\n\n833 n.4. Plaintiffs argue that is exactly what happened in this case:\n\n               FDA has abdicated its duty under 21 U.S.C. § 360cc(a) not to subvert the\n               grant of orphan drug exclusivity that Congress intended parties in\n               plaintiffs’ position to have . . . and its duty under . . . 21 U.S.C. § 393(a) to\n               “(1) promote the public health by promptly and efficiently reviewing\n               clinical research and taking appropriate action on the marketing of\n               regulated products in a timely manner; (2) with respect to such products,\n               protect the public health by ensuring that . . . (B) human . . . drugs are safe\n               and effective . . . .”\n\nPls.’ Opp. at 22 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       But this argument has both legal and factual flaws that can be derived even from the\n\nfactual allegations in the complaint.      FDA’s March Statement does not “consciously and\n\nexpressly” indicate that it will never bring enforcement actions against unlawful compounders,\n\nor that it will never bring enforcement actions against unlawful compounders of 17P. Moreover,\n\nthe cases where courts find agency policy to be so extreme as to amount to an abdication of\n\ngovernmental responsibility have been civil rights cases.       See, e.g., Adams v. Richardson, 480\n\nF.2d 1159 (D.C. Cir. 1973); Young v. Pierce, 544 F. Supp. 1010 (E.D. Tex. 1982). And the fact\n\nthat those opinions preceded Chaney suggests that they provide little precedential value here. 14\n\n       In Adams, the D.C. Circuit held that by continuing to give federal funding to segregated\n\npublic schools, appellants – the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (“HEW”); and the\n\nDirector of HEW’s Office of Civil Rights – had abdicated their duty to enforce Title VI of the\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1964. 480 F.2d at 1161–63. At the time of the Adams decision, as still\n\n\n14      Citing Adams, Justice Rehnquist’s opinion in Chaney noted that “[w]e do not have in this\ncase . . . a situation where it could justifiably be found that the agency has ‘consciously and\nexpressly adopted a general policy’ that is so extreme as to amount to an abdication of its\nstatutory responsibilities,” but stated, “we express no opinion on whether such decisions would\nbe unreviewable under § 701(a)(2).” Chaney, 470 U.S. at 833 n.4.\n                                                  28\n\ftoday, Title VI provided that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the ground of race,\n\ncolor, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be\n\nsubjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”\n\nId. at 1161 n.1. The statute “directed” all federal agencies with the authority to provide federal\n\nfunding to effectuate that provision by either terminating or refusing to grant assistance to\n\nprograms engaging in discriminatory conduct or by any other means authorized by law. Id. at\n\n1162–63. HEW had continued to provide federal funds to schools without regard to whether\n\nthey engaged in racial segregation. Id. at 1162. The Court emphasized that HEW was not\n\nsimply neglecting certain schools while carrying out a “generally effective enforcement\n\nprogram,” but rather, that it was funding all schools as matter of general policy. Id. at 1162.\n\nThis, it found, constituted a complete abdication of its statutory duty. Id. The Supreme Court in\n\nAdams also found that the express language of Title VI not only required the agency to enforce\n\nthe Act, but also set out two alternative means of enforcement that the agency was bound to use.\n\nId. at 1162–63. By failing to adhere to one of these alternative means of enforcement, the Court\n\nfound, HEW was derelict in its duty to enforce the Act. Id.\n\n       The defendants in Adams argued that the enforcement of Title VI was committed to\n\nagency discretion, and was therefore not reviewable by the courts. Id. at 1161. But here,\n\nplaintiffs challenge only FDA’s decision with respect to compounded 17P; they do not allege\n\nthat FDA is refusing to enforce the FDCA’s compounding provisions across the board “as a\n\nmatter of general policy. Moreover, Adams did not implicate the concerns that would be raised\n\nby telling an agency how to allocate its valuable enforcement resources; the case involved the\n\ngovernment’s continuing grant of federal funds to segregated institutions. Id. at 1161–62. Most\n\nimportantly, the Court found that Title VI expressly required the agency to enforce its provisions\n\n\n\n                                               29\n\fand set forth specific enforcement procedures. Id. at 1162. This aligns with the Supreme\n\nCourt’s later decision in Chaney and is distinguishable from instant situation because those\n\nprovisions are absent from the FDCA.            Therefore, this case involving one company’s\n\ncompetitive advantage does not in any way resemble the extreme abdication of statutory\n\nresponsibility to enforce fundamental rights that the Supreme Court confronted in Adams. See\n\nalso Young, 544 F. Supp. at 1013–17 (finding, based in part on Adams, that the court could\n\nreview a class action claim that HUD had abdicated its duty under several statutes to eliminate\n\nfinancial participation by the federal government in illegal racial discrimination by refusing to\n\ndecline federal funding to local housing authorities that engage in racially discriminatory housing\n\npractices).\n\n       Accordingly, the Court finds that the March Statement is a presumptively unreviewable\n\nexercise of FDA’s enforcement discretion, and not a reviewable statement of policy.\n\n   C. Even if the March Statement constitutes a reviewable enforcement policy, it has been\n      superseded.\n\n       Even if the Court were to assume that the March Statement constitutes a universally\n\napplicable statement that FDA would, as a matter of policy, stay its hand and exercise\n\nenforcement discretion with respect to the entire class of non-customized compounded products\n\nthat contain 17P, that policy has been superseded by FDA’s June Statement, along with the\n\nQuestions and Answers document. The June Statement states: “FDA emphasizes that it is\n\napplying      its   normal   enforcement   policies   for   compounded   drugs   to   compounded\n\nhydroxyprogesterone caproate.” June Statement. It goes on to explain that compounding should\n\nnot exceed the scope of traditional pharmacy compounding and that the agency prioritizes\n\nenforcement actions using a risk-based approach. Id. And if there was any lingering confusion,\n\nthe Questions and Answers document clears it up. It answers the question, “Does that mean that\n\n                                                 30\n\fthe FDA does not intend to take enforcement action against the compounders of\n\nhydroxyprogesterone caproate?” with a definitive “no.” Questions and Answers.\n\n           Plaintiffs argue that those two documents did not alter the agency’s previously announced\n\npolicy of non-enforcement because they did not expressly commit the agency to taking\n\nenforcement action. Compl. ¶ 94. 15 To prove that point, plaintiffs point to the fact that the FDA\n\nhas not brought any enforcement actions against illegal compounders of 17P. See Pls’ Opp. at 4-\n\n6; Tr. at 44 (Attorney for plaintiffs: “But they’re not enforcing it. Words without actions don’t\n\ndo anything.”).       This argument simply serves to demonstrate the basic deficiency in the\n\ncomplaint: the fact that plaintiffs are challenging an FDA decision (or series of decisions) not to\n\ninitiate enforcement action, rather than its stated policy on whether and how the statute should be\n\nenforced. 16\n\n    III.       Plaintiffs fail to state a claim under Count IV.\n\n           Count IV of the complaint alleges that FDA is permitting the foreign-manufactured active\n\npharmaceutical ingredient for compounded 17P to be imported into the United States in violation\n\nof section 381(a) of the FDCA. Compl. ¶123.\n\n           The FDCA requires any foreign establishment that manufactures, prepares, propagates,\n\ncompounds, or processes a drug to be imported into the United States to both “immediately\n\nregister” with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, 21 U.S.C. §§ 321(d), 360(i)(1)(A),\n\n\n15     This represents something of a reversal for plaintiffs, who advanced the position in\nanother lawsuit that FDA has become increasingly more direct in its public communications\nconcerning its enforcement priorities, and that it left “no room for doubt” that it considered bulk\ncompounding to be unlawful. Compl. and Appl. for Prelim. Inj., K-V Pharma. Co. v. Cook, Case\n1:12-cv-2491, at ¶¶ 5, 47 (July 17, 2012 N.D. Ga).\n\n16     The Court notes that plaintiffs’ complaint contains no claim that FDA has failed to act in\naccordance with the “normal enforcement policies” FDA claims in its June Statement to be\napplying with regard to illegal compounders of 17P.\n\n                                                  31\n\fand provide the Secretary with a list of all its imported drugs and devices, id. §§ 360(i)(2),\n\n360(j). Under Section 381(a), the Secretary of the Treasury “shall deliver to the Secretary of\n\nHealth and Human Services, upon his request,” samples of the product being imported or offered\n\nfor import into the United States. Id. § 381(a). In addition, the Secretary of Health and Human\n\nServices “shall furnish to the Secretary of the Treasury” a list of registered foreign\n\nestablishments and “shall request that if any drugs, devices, or tobacco products manufactured,\n\nprepared, propagated, compounded, or processed in an establishment not so registered are\n\nimported or offered for import into the United States, samples of such drugs, devices, or tobacco\n\nproducts be delivered to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.” Id. 17 “If it appears from\n\nthe examination of such samples or otherwise that . . . such article is adulterated, misbranded, or\n\nin violation of section 355 of this title . . . then such article shall be refused admission,” with\n\nlimited exceptions. Id. 18\n\n       Count IV alleges that the foreign-manufactured API for compounded 17P “appears to be\n\n– and, indeed, is – an unapproved new drug and, when imported or offered for import into the\n\nUnited States, appears to be – and, indeed, is – in violation of Section 355.” Compl. ¶ 121. It\n\nasserts that FDA is in violation of section 381(a) because “[s]ince March 30, 2011 and\n\ncontinuing to the present, Defendants have been, and are, allowing the import of such API for\n\ncompounded 17P.” Id. ¶ 123.\n\n       FDA submits that an alleged failure to enforce the rules against the importation of\n\nunlawful substances is presumptively unreviewable, and plaintiffs do not contest that\n\n\n17      The complaint does not specify whether the API for 17P that FDA is allegedly permitting\nto enter into the United States is coming from registered or unregistered foreign facilities.\n\n18      If an imported article is refused admission, the Secretary of the Treasury “shall cause the\ndestruction of any such article” unless it is “exported . . . within ninety days.” 21 U.S.C. §\n381(a).\n                                                32\n\fproposition. Pls.’ Opp. at 33 n.34 (“[p]laintiffs do not dispute that . . . FDA’s decision as to a\n\nparticular article offered for import, like its decision as to enforcement against a particular\n\ncompany in a particular factual setting, is within FDA’s enforcement discretion.”). But the\n\ncomplaint does not allege the existence of a policy, and even if one concludes that section 381(a)\n\nimposes a mandatory, and not a discretionary, obligation, the complaint fails to state a claim\n\nupon which relief could be granted.\n\n   A. The complaint does not allege the existence of a reviewable policy.\n\n       At the outset, the Court notes that plaintiffs do not point to any reviewable FDA\n\nstatement of policy that explicitly or implicitly permits unlawful imports, and the complaint\n\ncontains no non-conclusory allegation that such a policy exists. To the extent plaintiffs are\n\narguing that the language in the complaint asserting that “[s]ince March 30, 2011, and continuing\n\nto the present, Defendants have been, and are, allowing the import of [the] API for compounded\n\n17P,” reasonably leads to the inference that FDA has a policy, the Court finds that this vague\n\nstatement is insufficient to support such an inference under Twombly and Iqbal. Iqbal, 556 U.S.\n\nat 678 (A pleading must offer more than “labels and conclusions” or a “formulaic recitation of\n\nthe elements of a cause of action.”), quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555; see Compl. ¶¶ 121–23.\n\nFurthermore, although the complaint asserts that the March Statement “announc[es] implicitly\n\nthat they would allow such imports,” Compl. ¶ 124, the March Statement does not even mention\n\nthe import of components of compounded 17P. The only subjects of the statement are the\n\n“pharmacies that compound” 17P. March Statement; see O’Gilvie v. Corp. for Nat’l Cmty. Serv.,\n\n\n\n\n                                               33\n\f802 F. Supp. 2d 77, 82 (D.D.C. 2011) (conclusory allegations “need not be treated as true, and . .\n\n. are insufficient to defeat [a] motion to dismiss.”). 19\n\n    B. Even if the complaint contained sufficient factual allegations to support the existence of a\n       reviewable policy, it does not allege that the policy violates section 381(a).\n\n        Moreover, even if the Court were to accept the conclusory assertions in the complaint as\n\nsupporting the existence of a reviewable policy, Count IV fails to state a claim under section\n\n381(a) because the complaint does not allege that the policy is illegal.\n\n        Plaintiffs maintain that the section 381(a) “mandates the universal exclusion of foreign\n\ndrugs that are in violation of Section 355, whether the factories that manufactured them are\n\nregistered or not,” and they cite Beaty v. FDA, -- F. Supp. 2d --, Civ. Case No. 11-289(RJL),\n\n2012 WL 1021048 (D.D.C. Mar. 27, 2012), in support of that contention. Pls.’ Opp. at 31. In\n\nBeaty, another court in this district examined the language of section 381(a) to determine\n\nwhether it satisfied the Chaney requirements. Id. at *1. In that case, a foreign wholesaler of a\n\ndrug began exporting the drug to state departments of corrections within the United States for\n\nuse in lethal injections. Id. at *2. The company had neither registered with the FDA nor listed\n\nits drug product with the FDA. Id. FDA detained one shipment of the drug on the ground that it\n\nwas misbranded, yet proceeded to release the shipment into the United States anyway. Id. It\n\n\n\n19      The Court also struggles to find any “final agency action” to review here. Only “final\nagency actions” are reviewable under the APA. See Nat’l Ass’n of Home Builders v. U.S. Army\nCorps of Eng’rs, 417 F.3d 1272, 1278 (D.C. Cir. 2005). For an action to be “final,” it must\n“mark the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process,” and “be one by which rights\nor obligations have been determined, or from which legal consequences will flow.” Bennett v.\nSpear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 (1997). In the D.C. Circuit, the second requirement is met if an\naction “imposes an obligation, denies a right or fixes some legal relationship.” Home Builders,\n417 F.3d at 1278 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Plaintiffs have not identified\nany action that imposes any obligation, denies any right, or fixes any legal relationship. They do\nnot allege that FDA engaged in some decisionmaking process which led to the decision to allow\nimports of the API for 17P. And they have not pointed to any particular shipment or shipments\nof the API that FDA permitted into the United States.\n                                                   34\n\fdetained another shipment shortly after on the basis that the drug was an “unapproved new\n\ndrug,” yet after receiving correspondence from a state department of corrections indicating that\n\nthe drug was necessary for use in lethal injections, it released the shipments into the United\n\nStates. Id. In total, FDA released seven shipments into the United States. Id. The amended\n\ncomplaint in that case alleged that FDA had acted contrary to law, in an arbitrary and capricious\n\nmanner, and in abuse of its discretion when it allowed shipments of the misbranded and\n\nunapproved new drug to be imported into the United States, and sought a permanent injunction\n\nprohibiting the FDA from releasing future shipments into interstate commerce. Id. at *3. FDA\n\nargued that the release of the drug was an act of “enforcement discretion.” Id.\n\n         In analyzing section 381(a) under the Chaney test, the court first focused on the word\n\n“shall”: “if it appears from the examination of such samples,” or otherwise, that the article is\n\nmisbranded, “then such article shall be refused admission,” id. at *1, citing 21 U.S.C. § 381(a)\n\n(emphasis added). The court found that Congress’s use of the word “shall” revealed sufficient\n\nintent to circumscribe agency enforcement discretion. Id. at *5–6. Furthermore, it found that\n\n“the statute provides the FDA with a standard to apply during its examination of the imported\n\ndrugs – specifically, to determine whether the drug ‘appears’ to be misbranded, adulterated, or\n\nunapproved.” Id. at *8.     Accordingly, the court found that “[h]aving taken the steps to detain\n\nand determine that the foreign shipments contained a misbranded and unapproved new drug, the\n\nFDA was required under the FDCA to reject the shipments in the interest of public safety.” Id.\n\nat *7.\n\n         Here, “plaintiffs are not seeking review of any particular FDA decision as to an article\n\noffered for import.” Pls.’ Opp. at 33 n.34. Indeed, they concede – apparently in direct conflict\n\nwith Beaty – that “FDA’s decision as to a particular article offered for import, like its decision as\n\n\n\n                                                 35\n\fto enforcement against a particular company in a particular factual setting is within FDA’s\n\nenforcement discretion.” Id. Rather, they argue that in accordance with Beaty, section 381(a)\n\nrequires FDA to deny admission to a drug offered for import that appears to be in violation of\n\nsection 355. See Pls.’ Mot. for TRO/PI at 35–36. And they assert that FDA has neglected that\n\nduty by failing to reject shipments of “unapproved 17P API not shown to be destined for lawful\n\nuse.” Pls.’ Opp. at 31–32.\n\n       But the problem is that the complaint simply assumes that every shipment of the\n\ningredient for 17P appears to violate section 355. Yet the complaint itself establishes that 17P\n\ncan be compounded lawfully under certain circumstances, Compl. ¶ 46, and plaintiffs concede\n\nthat the API can therefore be lawfully imported in certain circumstances, Tr. at 34:18–22\n\n(Counsel for plaintiffs: “if it appears from the description of the shipment that what it is is active\n\npharmaceutical ingredient from an unapproved source and it’s not for personal importation, then\n\nit appears to be in violation of Section 355”) (emphasis added); id. 53:6–20 (conceding that there\n\nare a group of patients using compounded 17P legally and that these 17P compounds are lawful).\n\nIn cases where the substance is being imported for lawful customized compounding, it would be\n\nexempt from section 355. Pls.’ Opp. at 32.\n\n       According to FDA, “it is usually not possible to evaluate at the border whether the\n\npharmacy that eventually receives the foreign-manufactured API will compound it [lawfully],”\n\nwhich would render the API exempt from section 355 and permissible for import. 20 Defs.’ Mem.\n\nat 28. And plaintiffs agree that API that will be used for lawful compounding is exactly the same\n\n\n20      Plaintiffs attempt to get around this ambiguity by arguing that there are methods FDA\ncould use at the border to determine whether a particular sample of API is intended for use in\nlawful or unlawful compounds. Pls.’ Opp. at 32. But this does not cure the problem that the\ncomplaint fails to sufficiently allege that any shipment of API for 17P “appeared” to violate\nsection 355 at the time of import.\n\n                                                 36\n\fsubstance as API that will be used for unlawful compounding. Pls.’ Opp. at 32. So, while the\n\ncomplaint alleges that shipments of the API for compounded 17P have entered and are\n\ncontinuing to enter the United States, and that FDA is permitting their entry, the complaint is\n\ndevoid of the factual allegations needed to support the conclusory assertion in Count IV that the\n\nshipments contain a substance that “appears” to violate section 355. Thus, it fails to state a claim\n\nthat FDA ever violated section 381(a).\n\n   C. This case is not controlled by Adams.\n\n       To the extent plaintiffs once again point the Court to the Supreme Court’s pre-Chaney\n\ndecision in Adams and argue that an agency’s dereliction of duty is reviewable, the Court finds\n\nthat Adams does not apply here.\n\n       First, as stated above, the Court finds that plaintiffs’ complaint fails to assert that FDA\n\nhas neglected any statutory duty, so Adams is inapplicable.         Moreover, as with plaintiffs’\n\nallegations in Counts I through III, the allegations in Count IV that FDA has permitted illegal\n\nsubstances to enter the country concern only a small subset of violators in the course of a\n\ngenerally effective program. Cf. Adams, 480 F.2d at 1162. The complaint does not allege that\n\nFDA has failed to enforce a particular import restriction in the FDCA altogether. It merely\n\nalleges that FDA has permitted the import of one particular unlawful compound. This does not\n\namount to the sort of abdication of a statutory duty that troubled the Supreme Court in Adams.\n\n       Accordingly, plaintiffs’ allegations under Count IV are insufficient to state a claim under\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n\n\n\n\n                                                37\n\f                                        CONCLUSION\n\n       Because the claims in Counts I through III of plaintiffs’ complaint are unreviewable and\n\nCount IV fails to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), defendants’\n\nmotion to dismiss will be granted. A separate order will issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                             AMY BERMAN JACKSON\n                                             United States District Judge\n\nDATE: September 6, 2012\n\n\n\n\n                                               38\n\f",

Makena was approved in 2011 for use by pregnant\n\nwomen with a history of preterm birth to reduce the risk that they would experience another\n\npreterm birth. Plaintiffs have sued the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), its\n\nCommissioner Margaret A. Hamburg, the United States Department of Health & Human\n\nServices (“HHS”), and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, alleging that defendants are violating\n\nthe Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) and several provisions of the Food, Drug, and\n\nCosmetic Act (“FDCA”) by failing to take action against pharmacies that compound the drug\n\nand thereby creating a cheaper alternative for doctors to prescribe. The compounded form of the\n\ndrug is referred to as “17P” in this action.\n\n       In particular, plaintiffs challenge a March 30, 2011 press release in which FDA\n\nannounced its intention not to take enforcement action against the compounders except under\n\ncertain circumstances. They also challenge FDA’s failure to block foreign shipments of the\n\factive pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) used in 17P from entering the United States.\n\nAccording to plaintiffs, FDA’s actions have given rise to unlawful competition with Makena and\n\ncaused them irreparable economic harm.\n\n       Defendants have moved to dismiss the action under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\n\n12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). [Dkt. # 7]. They argue that plaintiffs lack standing, and that the actions\n\nthey challenge are the types of discretionary enforcement decisions that the Supreme Court\n\nfound to be unreviewable in Heckler v. Chaney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111383\"><a href=\"/opinion/111383/heckler-v-chaney/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">821</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1985). Alternatively, they argue\n\nthat the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The Court concludes\n\nthat Counts I through III of the complaint challenge FDA’s discretionary enforcement activities\n\nand therefore assert unreviewable claims, and that Count IV fails to state a claim under Rule\n\n12(b)(6).\n\n\n                                        BACKGROUND\n\n       Plaintiff KV is the owner of the drug Makena, which has been approved by the FDA.\n\nCompl. ¶ 24. Plaintiff Ther-RX is a “wholly-owned subsidiary of KV [that] markets, sells, and\n\ndistributes Makena on behalf of KV.” Id. ¶ 25. On January 25, 2007, FDA designated Makena\n\nas an “orphan drug” to be used for the prevention of preterm birth in women who have a\n\nsingleton pregnancy and a history of prior preterm delivery. 1 Id. ¶¶ 50–51.\n\n       Under the Orphan Drug Act, 21 U.S.C. §§ 360aa–ee (“ODA”), an “orphan drug” is a\n\ndrug used to treat a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United\n\nStates. Compl. ¶ 36. Congress passed the ODA in 1983, as an amendment to the Federal Food,\n\n1      Although now named “Makena,” the drug was named “Gestiva” when its application was\nsubmitted to FDA for approval. Compl. ¶ 50. In addition, although now owned by KV, the drug\nwas owned by the company Adeza Biomedical at that time. Id. For the sake of convenience,\nhowever, the Court will refer to the drug as “Makena” and the owner as “KV” throughout this\nopinion.\n\n\n                                                2\n\fDrug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. § 301, et seq (“FDCA”). 2 The congressional findings reflect\n\nthat Congress sought to create incentives for the development of drugs for rare conditions. Pub.\n\nL. No. 97-414, § 1(b)(4), 96 Stat. 2049, 2049 (1983). Accordingly, when a drug receives the\n\nFDA’s orphan drug designation, section 360cc(a) of the OCA prevents the Secretary of Health\n\nfrom “approving another application under section 355 of this title . . . for such drug for [the\n\nsame] disease or condition” within seven years after the approval date of the orphan drug. 21\n\nU.S.C. § 360cc(a).\n\n       Makena, a hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection is the first drug approved by FDA to\n\nreduce the risk of preterm birth in women with a singleton pregnancy who have a history of\n\nsingleton spontaneous preterm birth. Compl. ¶ 1. Because it has been designated as an “orphan\n\ndrug,” its seven year exclusivity period began running on the day it was approved, February 3,\n\n2011. Compl. ¶ 14.\n\n       However, for a number of years before FDA approved Makena, women were treated for\n\nrisk of preterm birth with versions of hydroxyprogesterone caproate that were compounded by\n\nentities known as “compounding pharmacies” or “compounders.” Id. ¶ 9. According to the\n\ncomplaint:\n\n              Drug compounding is a process by which a pharmacist or doctor\n              combines, mixes, or alters ingredients to create a medication customized\n              to the needs of an individual patient. Compounded drugs generally are not\n              reviewed or approved by FDA. Compounded versions of 17P were not\n              and are not reviewed or approved by FDA; and, in general, their individual\n              formulations, manufacturing processes, labeling, and adverse-event and\n              treatment-failure histories were and are unknown to FDA. The facilities in\n              which the compounding occurred and continues to occur generally were\n              not and are not registered with or routinely inspected by FDA.\n\n\n\n2      Since this action was filed, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act,\nPub. L. No. 112-144, 126 Stat. 993 (2012), took effect, amending the FDCA. The provisions of\nthe FDCA at issue here were not changed by the amendments.\n                                               3\n\fCompl. ¶ 9.\n\n       When Makena was released, the media began reporting on its high list price of $1,500 per\n\ninjection, or up to $30,000 for a course of treatment. Id. ¶ 68. Plaintiffs allege that these reports\n\nwere misguided, see id. ¶¶ 69–73, but that the press accounts prompted members of Congress to\n\npressure FDA to make the 17P injection available at a lower price than the initial list price for\n\nMakena. Id. ¶ 74.\n\n       On March 30, 2011, FDA issued a statement for immediate release titled, FDA Statement\n\non     Makena. 3           FDA       Statement       (Mar.      20,     2011),      available      at\n\nwww.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm249025.htm                            (“March\n\nStatement”). The statement explained that FDA had approved Makena on February 3, 2011, and\n\nthat as a result, Makena obtained seven years of exclusivity under the Orphan Drug Act. Id. It\n\nfurther explained that for many years, a version of the active ingredient of Makena had been\n\navailable to patients whose physicians requested the drug from a pharmacist who compounded\n\nthe drug, and that FDA had generally exercised enforcement discretion with respect to those\n\ndrugs. Id. The March Statement went on:\n\n                       Because Makena is a sterile injectable, where there is a risk of\n               contamination, greater assurance of safety is provided by an approved\n               product. However, under certain conditions, a licensed pharmacist may\n               compound a drug product using ingredients that are components of FDA\n               approved drugs if the compounding is for an identified individual patient\n               based on a valid prescription for a compound product that is necessary for\n               that patient. FDA prioritizes enforcement actions related to compounded\n               drugs using a risk-based approach, giving the highest enforcement priority\n               to pharmacies that compound products that are causing harm or that\n               amount to health fraud.\n\n\n\n3      Although the complete press release is not attached to plaintiff’s complaint, it is\nincorporated by reference in paragraphs 75–94.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 196 (D.D.C. 2002) (finding that a court may consider documents\nincorporated by reference in the complaint for a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6)).\n                                                 4\n\f                     FDA understands that the manufacturer of Makena, KV\n              Pharmaceuticals has sent letters to pharmacists indicating that FDA will\n              no longer exercise enforcement discretion with regard to compounded\n              versions of Makena. This is not correct.\n\n                     In order to support access to this important drug, at this time and\n              under this unique situation, FDA does not intend to take enforcement\n              action against pharmacies that compound hydroxyprogesterone caproate\n              based on a valid prescription for an individually identified patient unless\n              the compounded products are unsafe, of substandard quality, or are not\n              being compounded in accordance with appropriate standards for\n              compounding sterile products. As always, FDA may at any time revisit a\n              decision to exercise enforcement discretion.\n\nId.\n\n       In their complaint, plaintiffs do not mention the language in the press release that\n\nsuggests that the March Statement may have been prompted by their own actions. Instead, they\n\nallege that the March Statement was issued in response to public pressure about the price of\n\nMakena. Compl. ¶ 75. They further allege that some Medicaid programs have interpreted the\n\nMarch Statement as “authorizing the total displacement of Makena by compounded 17P.” Id. ¶\n\n86. 4 Plaintiffs assert that “numerous compounded versions of 17P (not customized for individual\n\npatients) have entered, re-entered, or remained on the U.S. market, some manufactured on a\n\ncommercial scale”; and that FDA is permitting unapproved 17P API to be imported into the\n\nUnited States. Id. ¶ 15. According to the complaint, many or all of the compounders of 17P use\n\nactive ingredients manufactured in China by establishments that have not been identified in an\n\napproved new drug application and are not inspected by FDA. Id. ¶ 89.\n\n\n\n\n4      The complaint also alleges that on the same day that FDA issued the March Statement,\nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), a unit of HHS, issued a coordinated\nstatement that allegedly “authorized and encouraged state Medicaid agencies to pay for\ncompounded 17P in substitution for Makena.” Compl. ¶¶ 17, 83.\n\n                                               5\n\f       Since issuing the March Statement, FDA has issued three additional press releases\n\nregarding Makena, Compl. ¶ 94, two of which are relevant to this action. 5 On June 15, 2012,\n\nFDA addressed safety concerns plaintiffs had raised about the 17P compounds, and it described\n\nthe enforcement approach it was following with respect to compounded 17P. It announced that it\n\nhad tested API from sixteen samples of 17P, and thirteen samples of compounded 17P prepared\n\nby eight different pharmacies, and that it had not identified any major safety problems. Updated\n\nFDA Statement on Compounded Versions of hydroxyprogesterone caproate (the active\n\ningredient       in       Makena)        (June        15,       2012),       available        at\n\nwww.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm308546.htm                          (“June\n\nStatement”). However, it also stated that “approved drug products, such as Makena, provide a\n\ngreater assurance of safety and effectiveness than do compounded products.” Id.\n\n       The June Statement further explained:\n\n                      The drugs that pharmacists compound (including compounded\n              hydroxyprogesterone caproate) are not FDA approved, which means they\n              do not undergo premarket review nor do they have an FDA finding of\n              safety and efficacy. Compounding large volumes of drugs that are copies\n              of FDA-approved drugs circumvents important public health\n              requirements, including the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act’s drug\n              approval provisions. Consumers and health professionals rely on the\n              Act’s evidence-based drug approval process to ensure that drugs are safe\n              and effective. For that reason, one factor that the agency considers in\n              determining whether a drug may be compounded is whether the\n              prescribing practitioner has determined that a compounded product is\n              necessary for the particular patient and would provide a significant\n              difference for the patient as compared to the FDA-approved commercially\n              available drug product.\n\n                     FDA emphasizes that it is applying its normal enforcement policies\n              for compounded drugs to compounded hydroxyprogesterone caproate.\n              The compounding of any drug, including hydroxyprogesterone caproate,\n              should not exceed the scope of traditional pharmacy compounding. As the\n\n\n5      Although these documents are not attached to the Complaint, they are incorporated into\nthe complaint by reference in paragraph 94. See Gustave-Schmidt, 226 F. Supp. 2d at 196.\n                                                 6\n\f              Agency has previously explained, FDA generally prioritizes enforcement\n              actions related to compounded drugs using a risk-based approach, giving\n              the highest enforcement priority to pharmacies that compound products\n              that are causing harm or that amount to health fraud.\n\nId.\n\n       Then, in a press release titled, Questions and Answers on Updated FDA Statement on\n\nCompounded Versions of hydroxyprogesterone caproate (the active ingredient in Makena), FDA\n\nprovided     further     clarification.            (June    29,     2012),     available    at\n\nwww.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm310215.htm (“Questions and\n\nAnswers”). It posed and answered the following questions:\n\n                     Will the agency take any enforcement action against\n              pharmacies compounding versions of hydroxyprogesterone caproate\n              products?\n\n                      The FDA may take enforcement action against compounding\n              pharmacies if warranted. The FDA makes its enforcement decisions about\n              compounded products on a case-by-case basis after considering the\n              particular facts at issue. As we explained in the June 15, 2012, statement,\n              the compounding of any drug, including hydroxyprogesterone caproate,\n              should not exceed the scope of traditional pharmacy compounding.\n\n                      Are pharmacies free to compound large volumes of\n              hydroxyprogesterone caproate as long as none of their drugs are\n              tested and found to be unsafe?\n\n                     No. The FDA does not consider compounding large volumes of\n              copies, or what are essentially copies, of any approved commercially-\n              available drug to fall within the scope of traditional pharmacy practice.\n              One factor that the agency considers in determining whether a drug may\n              be compounded is whether the prescribing practitioner has determined that\n              a compounded product is necessary for the particular patient and would\n              provide a significant difference for the patient as compared to the FDA-\n              approved commercially available drug product. . . .\n\n                     The FDA stated it is using a risk-based approach to\n              enforcement action against compounding pharmacies. The FDA also\n              stated that its investigation did not identify a major safety issue, so\n              does that mean that the FDA does not intend to take enforcement\n              action against the compounders of hydroxyprogesterone caproate?\n\n                                               7\n\f                          No. A risk-based approach to enforcement relates to how the FDA\n                   generally prioritizes its enforcement efforts. The FDA’s June 15, 2012\n                   statement should not be interpreted to mean that the FDA will take\n                   enforcement action only if the agency identifies a particular safety\n                   problem. We reiterate that the compounding of any drug, including\n                   hydroxyprogesterone caproate, should not exceed the scope of traditional\n                   pharmacy compounding.\n\nId.\n\n        Plaintiffs complain that none of these statements evince an agency plan to take\n\nenforcement action against those compounding and marketing 17P on a large scale basis as\n\nopposed to individually customizing it for patients for whom Makena is medically inappropriate.\n\nCompl. ¶ 94. They allege that notwithstanding FDA’s public statements, compounded versions\n\nof 17P are still actively being sold on the U.S. market. Id. ¶ 95. See also Plaintiffs’ Opposition\n\nto Def’s Motion to Dismiss and Reply Mem. in Support of Mot. for Temporary, Prelim., and\n\nPermanent Relief [Dkt. # 12] at 4–5 (“Pls.’ Opp.”) (“FDA has failed to date to take any action\n\nagainst the compounding of 17P. . . . In practical effect . . . FDA’s lack of enforcement against\n\nunlawful compounding of 17P has not changed; and because FDA has done nothing to change\n\nthe perception in the marketplace that it will not act against unlawful compounding of 17P, the\n\nunlawful compounding of 17P continues.”). In essence, what plaintiffs challenge is defendants’\n\nfailure to take enforcement action:\n\n                   The bottom line is that Defendants have done and, unless ordered by the\n                   Court, will do, nothing – nothing – to enforce the law against unlawful\n                   uncustomized compounding of 17P, unless and until FDA learns that\n                   patients have actually been harmed or defrauded by compounded 17P.\n\nPls.’ Opp. at 6.\n\n        Plaintiffs assert that FDA’s statements and inaction have undermined the exclusivity\n\nconferred with the orphan drug designation and devalued their substantial investment in the drug.\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fCompl. ¶¶ 95–99. The complaint alleges that KV is almost entirely reliant on the success of\n\nMakena to generate the cash it needs to finance its operations and to make obligatory debt\n\npayments, id. ¶ 95, and that the illegal production of 17P has displaced Makena in the market and\n\nsubstantially undercut plaintiffs’ sales, id. ¶ 96. Since the time the complaint was filed, plaintiffs\n\nKV and Ther-Rx have filed voluntary Chapter 11 petitions in the United States Bankruptcy Court\n\nfor the Southern District of New York. 6 See Notice of Filing for Bankruptcy Protection by K-V\n\nPharma. Co., Ther-Rx Corp. [Dkt. # 18] (Aug. 6, 2012).\n\n       Plaintiffs filed a four-count complaint in this Court on July 5, 2012, [Dkt. # 1], along with\n\na motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, [Dkt. # 2].\n\n           Count I alleges that FDA’s March Statement and the policy it sets forth violate\n           section 360cc(a) of the FDCA by effectively nullifying Makena’s statutory seven-\n           year period of market exclusivity. It further alleges that by issuing the March\n           Statement for the purpose of “support[ing] access to” HPC injection, FDA failed to\n           comply with the procedural requirements of section 360cc(a), in violation of the\n           APA, 5 U.S.C. § 558(c); section 360cc(a) of the FDCA, 21 U.S.C. § 360cc; and the\n           Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and\n           acted arbitrarily, capriciously, in an abuse of discretion, and in excess of its authority,\n           in violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)–(D).

Compl.\n           ¶¶ 110–13.\n\n           Count III alleges that the March Statement and the policy it sets forth “approve,\n           authorize, invite, encourage, and permit the introduction, and delivery for\n           introduction, into interstate commerce of unapproved new drugs” in violation of\n           FDCA sections 355(a) and 301(d), 21 U.S.C. §§ 355(a), 331(d), and the APA, 5\n           U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C). Compl. ¶¶ 114–16.\n\n           Count IV alleges that by allowing the import of API for compounded 17P, FDA is\n           engaging in an ongoing violation of section 381(a) of the FDCA.

Compl. 42 ¶ 5(a). It requests that the Court order\n\ndefendants: to “take sufficient enforcement actions to stop the unlawful competition with\n\nMakena” by non-customized compounded 17P, id. ¶ 5(b); to report to the Court quarterly for one\n\nyear and semi-annually for the following two years the actions they have taken to terminate\n\nshipments of non-customized compounded 17P, id. ¶ 5(c); and to bar entry into the United\n\nStates, and release into domestic commerce, of any future shipments of foreign-manufactured\n\nAPI for use in compounding non-customized 17P except in certain specified instances.

Pls.’ Opp. at 9–14.\n\nWhile nothing ensures that these enforcement actions will induce all 17P compounders to stop\n\ntheir unlawful production, the Court is satisfied that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to\n\nsupport the inference that enforcement tools at FDA’s disposal would be “likely” to at least\n\nreduce the presence of compounded 17P on the market, which would compel more health care\n\nprofessionals to use Makena, or prompt insurers that have adopted policies favoring use of\n\ncompounded 17P over Makena to ease those policies.

See Compl. ¶ 19.\n\n         Since plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to support standing, the Court proceeds to\n\ndefendants’ next argument: reviewability.\n\n   II.      The actions challenged in Counts I–III are not reviewable.\n\n         All four of plaintiffs’ claims ask the Court to review agency conduct under section 706(2)\n\nof the Administrative Procedure Act. 9 But section 701 of the APA precludes judicial review of\n\nfinal agency action, including refusals to act, when review is precluded by statute or “committed\n\nto agency discretion by law.” 21 U.S.C. § 701; see Chaney, 470 U.S. at 826.\n\n         Defendants contend that the Supreme Court’s decision in Heckler v. Chaney is\n\ncontrolling here, and that the challenged agency action is not subject to judicial review because it\n\nis committed to agency discretion. Defs.’ Mem. at 18–40, citing Chaney, 470 U.S. at 821. The\n\nCourt agrees.     In Chaney, the Supreme Court held that an agency’s decision not to take\n\nenforcement action is presumed to be immune from judicial review unless Congress has\n\nexpressed the intent to circumscribe agency enforcement discretion in the statute and provided\n\nmeaningful standards in the statute for defining the limits of that discretion. 470 U.S. at 834–35.\n\nIn this case, Congress has done neither.\n\n         In Chaney, a group of prison inmates sought to compel FDA to initiate an enforcement\n\naction with respect to the drugs used for capital punishment. Chaney, 470 U.S. at 823. Plaintiffs\n\n\n\n9        The Court notes that Count I of the complaint also alleges that FDA violated the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. However, plaintiffs\ndo not raise this claim in their motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction\nand do not defend it in opposition to plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss the action, so the Court will\ntreat it as conceded.\n                                                 16\n\finitially petitioned the agency directly, arguing that the use of those drugs violated prohibitions\n\nin the FDCA against misbranding and constituted the unapproved use of an approved drug. Id. at\n\n824. They also argued that the FDCA’s requirements for approval of “new drugs” under section\n\n355 applied, but were not being followed. Id. Accordingly, the plaintiffs asked FDA to take\n\nvarious investigatory and enforcement actions to prevent the perceived violations, such as:\n\n               [A]ffix warnings to the labels of all the drugs stating that they were\n               unapproved and unsafe for human execution, to send statements to the\n               drug manufacturers and prison administrators stating that the drugs should\n               not be so used, and to adopt procedures for seizing the drugs from state\n               prisons and to recommend the prosecution of all those in the chain of\n               distribution who knowingly distribute or purchase the drugs with intent to\n               use them for human execution.\n\nId.\n\n       The FDA Commissioner responded by letter, refusing to take the requested actions. Id.\n\nThe letter explained, in part:\n\n               Generally enforcement proceedings in this area are initiated only when\n               there is a serious danger to the public health or a blatant scheme to\n               defraud. We cannot conclude that those dangers are present under State\n               lethal injection laws, which are duly authorized statutory enactments in\n               furtherance of proper State functions . . . .\n\nId. at 824–25. The plaintiffs then challenged this response in court under the judicial review\n\nprovisions of the APA, claiming the same violations of the FDCA and asking the Court to\n\nrequire FDA to take the enforcement actions they had requested in the petition. Id. at 825.\n\n       The Supreme Court held that “an agency’s decision not to prosecute or enforce, whether\n\nthrough civil or criminal process, is a decision generally committed to an agency’s absolute\n\ndiscretion” and is therefore presumed to be unreviewable under the APA. Id. at 831. The Court\n\nexplained that the availability of judicial review is determined by the legislature in the first\n\n\n\n\n                                                17\n\finstance, and that if Congress has not provided courts with “law to apply,” agency action will be\n\nconsidered to be committed to the agency’s discretion. Id. at 834.\n\n               If [Congress] has indicated an intent to circumscribe agency enforcement\n               discretion, and has provided meaningful standards for defining the limits\n               of that discretion, there is law to apply under § 701(a)(2), and courts may\n               require that the agency follow that law; if it has not, then an agency refusal\n               to institute proceedings is a decision committed to agency discretion by\n               law within the meaning of that section.\n\nId. (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court determined that the action at issue in Chaney\n\nwas committed to the agency’s discretion because the statute was “drawn so that a court would\n\nhave no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s exercise of discretion.” Id. at\n\n830. The Court reasoned:\n\n       [A]n agency decision not to enforce often involves a complicated balancing of a\n       number of factors which are peculiarly within its expertise. Thus, the agency\n       must not only assess whether a violation has occurred, but whether agency\n       resources are best spent on this violation or another, whether the agency is likely\n       to succeed if it acts, whether the particular enforcement action requested best fits\n       the agency’s overall policies, and, indeed, whether the agency has enough\n       resources to undertake the action at all. . . . The agency is far better equipped than\n       the courts to deal with the many variables involved in the proper ordering of its\n       priorities.\n\nId. at 831–32. A plaintiff may overcome the presumption that agency enforcement decisions are\n\nunreviewable only by showing that “the substantive statute has provided guidelines for the\n\nagency to follow in exercising its enforcement powers.” Id. at 833.\n\n       Here plaintiffs’ claims in Counts I through III fall squarely within the Chaney\n\npresumption of unreviewability.     Just as in Chaney, plaintiffs allege ongoing violations of\n\nsubstantive provisions of the FDCA, and they request that the Court order FDA to take\n\ninvestigatory and enforcement action to stop them. Compl. ¶¶ 103–116; pp. 40–43. A review of\n\nthe extensive prayer for relief demonstrates that this case is fundamentally an effort to get the\n\nCourt to direct and oversee the FDA’s enforcement activities, and that it cannot do.\n\n                                                18\n\f   A. Congress did not express an intent in the FDCA to circumscribe agency enforcement\n      discretion and it did not provide any law for the court to apply.\n\n        Under Chaney, the presumption of unreviewability can be overcome only if Congress\n\n“has indicated an intent to circumscribe agency enforcement discretion, and has provided\n\nmeaningful standards for defining the limits of that discretion.” 470 U.S. at 834. And Chaney is\n\ndirectly on point here because the Supreme Court was analyzing the very statute at issue in this\n\ncase.\n\n        In Chaney, the Court examined each of the enforcement mechanisms available to FDA\n\nunder the FDCA and found that “[t]he Act’s enforcement provisions . . . commit complete\n\ndiscretion to the Secretary to decide how and when they should be exercised.” Id. at 835. That\n\nfinding continues to be controlling today. So the only remaining question is whether there is\n\nsome other provision in the FDCA that would authorize the review that plaintiffs are seeking.\n\n        The Chaney plaintiffs pointed to substantive prohibitions in the FDCA, including the\n\nrules against misbranding in section 355, but the Court flatly rejected the notion that those\n\nsections supplied the necessary law to apply, saying: “These provisions are simply irrelevant to\n\nthe agency’s discretion to refuse to initiate proceedings.” Id. at 836. The Court finds that the\n\nsubstantive provisions cited in this case are similarly irrelevant.\n\n        Count I points to 21 U.S.C. § 360cc, which is the grant of exclusivity under the Orphan\n\nDrug Act. It provides that the Secretary “may not approve another application under section 355\n\nof this title” within seven years of approving an orphan drug, and identifies some exceptions to\n\n\n\n\n                                                  19\n\fthe rule. 21 U.S.C. § 360cc(a)(2). 10 Count II is premised upon section 353a, which exempts\n\ncompounded drugs from various provisions of the FDCA (including section 355 – the\n\nprohibition against the introduction of a drug into interstate commerce without FDA approval)\n\nunder particular conditions, such as when the drug has been compounded for an individual\n\npatient based on a valid prescription. 21 U.S.C. §353a. But neither of those provisions requires\n\nFDA to proceed against unlawful compounders – they don’t say a word about it. And Count III\n\nis based in part on section 355, which was the section considered and rejected by the Court in\n\nChaney. Section 355(a) states that “no person shall introduce or deliver for introduction into\n\ninterstate commerce any new drug,” without approval by FDA. 21 U.S.C. § 355(a). It is also\n\nbased on section 331(d), which states that “the introduction or delivery for introduction into\n\ninterstate commerce of any article in violation of” various sections of the FDCA, including\n\nsection 355, is prohibited. 21 U.S.C. § 331(d). So none of the cited provisions deal with the\n\nscope of the agency’s enforcement discretion at all.\n\n       Indeed, in their papers, plaintiffs did not point to any specific language in these statutory\n\nprovisions that supposedly expressed the legislature’s desire to limit the agency’s enforcement\n\ndiscretion or that could serve as the guide for a court’s review. Moreover, when asked directly at\n\nthe motions hearing, counsel for plaintiff would not concede the point, but he repeatedly failed to\n\ndirect the Court to any statutory provision that would satisfy the Chaney test and overcome the\n\npresumption. Tr. of Motions Hearing (Aug. 7, 2012) (“Tr.”) at 31–33, 36–38, 46. Accordingly,\n\n\n10      Plaintiffs cite section 360cc for the proposition that the FDA is prohibited from\n“approving (formally or in any other way), authorizing, inviting, encouraging, or generally\npermitting the introduction into interstate commerce of any compounded version of that same\ndrug product for the same orphan indication as to which the approved drug has been designated\nas an orphan drug.” See e.g., Compl. ¶ 104. But that language does not appear anywhere in that\nsection of the statute, so the citation is somewhat disingenuous. The only express direction to\nFDA in section 360cc is that the Secretary “may not approve another application under section\n355 of this title.” 21 U.S.C. § 360cc(a)(2).\n                                                20\n\fthis Court finds that Congress did not express an intent to circumscribe FDA’s enforcement\n\ndiscretion in the FDCA. And since the FDCA does not provide any law for the Court to apply,\n\nthe Court finds that FDA’s March Statement is unreviewable. 11\n\n       Plaintiffs emphasize the prospective nature of FDA’s pronouncement and argue that since\n\nit addresses future conduct, it constitutes an “affirmative public invitation” to compound 17P that\n\nis different from a mere failure to bring an enforcement action. Pls.’ Opp. at 39; Pls.’ Mot. for\n\nTemporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction (“Pls.’ Mot. for TRO/PI”) [Dkt. # 2] at\n\n37. However, the letter that the plaintiffs challenged in Chaney contained language nearly\n\nidentical to the operative language in the March Statement. The Chaney response letter stated\n\nthat enforcement proceedings are generally initiated only when there is a serious danger to the\n\npublic health or a blatant scheme to defraud, and that FDA could not conclude that those factors\n\nwere present under State lethal injection laws. Chaney, 470 U.S. at 824–25. Similarly here, the\n\nMarch Statement relays the factors FDA considers when deciding whether to bring enforcement\n\naction, and recites its current determination that those factors do not warrant action against\n\npharmacies that compound 17P for individual patients, except under certain conditions.\n\n       Plaintiffs also contend that they fall outside Chaney because they are only requesting that\n\nthe Court require FDA to take some enforcement action, and they are not asking it to specify the\n\ntype of enforcement action. Pls.’ Opp. at 23–24.         But this distinction does not save the case.\n\nPlaintiffs’ requests that the Court order “sufficient” enforcement action to restore plaintiffs’\n\n\n11      Perhaps because the statutory support is absent, plaintiffs argue vehemently that the\nCourt should grant relief in this case because “where agency action (or inaction) has harmed\nplaintiffs, it is well within the equitable powers of a court to order the specific relief necessary to\ncure the transgressions.” Pls.’ Opp. at 26–28. However, in light of the plain language of section\n701 of the APA and the clear direction provided by Chaney, the Court declines to find that\nFDA’s announcement of an enforcement decision that is well within its discretion constitutes the\ntype of harm that warrants equitable intervention.\n\n                                                  21\n\fcompetitive advantage and that it monitor FDA’s activities by requiring regular reports\n\ndemonstrate that they are asking the Court to get right smack in the middle of agency operations.\n\nDirecting the FDA to bring a particular sort of enforcement action, and a particular quantity of\n\nthose actions, is directing it how to allocate its finite enforcement resources – a decision that is\n\n“peculiarly within the agency’s expertise and discretion.” 12 Crowley v Pena, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"679951\"><a href=\"/opinion/679951/crowley-caribbean-transport-inc-crowley-maritime-corporation-v-federico/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">671</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 677\n\n(D.C.

Plaintiffs cannot avoid the impact of Chaney by characterizing the March Statement as a\n      statement of agency policy.\n\n       Plaintiffs maintain that the case survives on the grounds that it is not actually about an\n\nenforcement decision. They cite Crowley v.

Cir. 1994), and argue that\n\n\n\n\n12      Plaintiffs’ argument that the March Statement is reviewable because FDA considered\nprice in deciding how to exercise its enforcement discretion – a factor that FDA may not\nconsider to determine whether a compound is legal under the FDCA – is also misguided. Compl.\n¶¶ 80–81. The March Statement does not express a view that 17P compounds are legal because\nMakena is too expensive. If that were the case, the statement might constitute a reviewable\nagency policy. Rather, the statement explains why FDA does not intend to bring enforcement\nactions against certain pharmacies, even if the pharmacies are engaging in unlawful conduct. It\nis exactly that exercise of discretion that Chaney and Crowley explained is presumptively\nunreviewable.\n\n                                                22\n\fthe case falls within an exception to Chaney for challenges to statements of agency policy.13\n\nPls.’ Opp. at 36–38. In Crowley, the D.C. Circuit confirmed that enforcement decisions are\n\npresumptively unreviewable. 37 F.3d at 676–77. However, it noted in dicta that “an agency’s\n\nstatement of a general enforcement policy may be reviewable for legal sufficiency where the\n\nagency has expressed the policy as a formal regulation after the full rulemaking process . . . or\n\nhas otherwise articulated it in some form of universal policy statement.” Id. at 676. Plaintiffs\n\nargue that FDA’s statement is reviewable because it sets forth a general policy, not a decision in\n\nan individual case. Pls.’ Opp. at 36–37. But the letter challenged in Chaney also involved a\n\nbroad class of alleged law violators, so the fact that the March Statement did not involve an\n\nindividual declination is not dispositive. More important, the March Statement is neither the\n\nformal result of a rulemaking process nor a universal policy statement, so the limited\n\ncircumstances that the D.C. Circuit said may call for a different result are not present here.\n\n       In Crowley, the D.C. Circuit noted that a statement might be reviewable if it “actually\n\nlay[s] out a general policy delineating the boundary between enforcement and non-enforcement\n\n\n13       At the motion to dismiss stage, the Court takes all the factual allegations in plaintiffs’\ncomplaint as true and makes all inferences that can be alleged from those facts in plaintiffs’\nfavor. See Sparrow, 216 F.3d at 1113. However, the Court need not accept the many legal\nconclusions asserted in the complaint or any inferences unsupported by factual allegation.\nBrowning, 292 F.3d at 242. For example, the Court need not accept plaintiffs’ conclusion that\n“FDA’s [March] Statement is not the exercise of case-by-case enforcement discretion as to past\nconduct, but, rather, addresses future conduct and announces a general policy that is binding on\nFDA personnel as long as it has not been revoked, and that approves, authorizes, invites,\nencourages, and permits an unlimited and unknown number of ‘compounders’ to distribute\nnationwide during plaintiffs’ exclusivity period and for an unlimited time and thereafter non-\ncustomized 17P intended to be used for the same orphan indication for which Makena is\napproved.” Compl. ¶ 80. Whether or not the March Statement is an exercise of enforcement\ndiscretion or a policy is a legal conclusion. And plaintiffs’ characterization does not quite square\nwith the language in the statement that “FDA does not intend to take enforcement action against\npharmacies that compound hydroxyprogesterone caproate based on a valid prescription for an\nindividually identified patient unless the compounded products are unsafe, of substandard\nquality, or are not being compounded in accordance with appropriate standards for compounding\nsterile products.” (emphasis added). March Statement.\n                                                 23\n\fand purport[s] to speak to a broad class of parties.” Crowley, 37 F.3d at 677. But this is a\n\nnarrow exception to the presumption. As the Court of Appeals explained: “This will not be true\n\nin the ordinary case, however, and the more reasonable inference when faced with a context-\n\nbound non-enforcement pronouncement is that the agency has addressed the issue in\n\ncomparatively ad hoc terms inherently implicating its non-reviewable enforcement discretion.”\n\nId. As the court predicted, that is the appropriate inference to be drawn here, as there is no clear\n\ndemarcation set out in the statement at issue.\n\n       The language in the March Statement that animates the plaintiffs – that “FDA does not\n\nintend to take enforcement action against pharmacies” – does not constitute an announcement of\n\npolicy that would differentiate this case from Chaney. March Statement. In Chaney, FDA’s\n\nintention not to take enforcement action against states using the challenged drugs for lethal\n\ninjections was implicit in its denial of the plaintiffs’ petition. Chaney, 470 U.S. at 837–38.\n\nStates could have viewed it, as plaintiffs suggest here, as a “green light” to continue their\n\nallegedly illegal behavior. Yet, the Supreme Court still found the decision enunciated in the\n\nletter to be unreviewable. Id.\n\n       Moreover, here, FDA did not disavow an intention to proceed against compounding\n\npharmacies as a general matter. What it said was: “FDA does not intend to take enforcement\n\naction against pharmacies that compound . . . based on a valid prescription for an individually\n\nidentified patient unless the compounded products are unsafe . . . .” March Statement (emphasis\n\nadded). Inherent in that statement is a consideration of the individual circumstances of each\n\ncase: was there a valid prescription for an individually identified patient? So, contrary to\n\nplaintiff’s assertion, the March Statement is not a universal policy statement “setting forth FDA’s\n\ndecision not to regulate the class of noncustomized compounded products that contain 17P (or\n\n\n\n                                                 24\n\fwhat purports to be 17P) . . . .” Pls.’ Opp. at 19. Furthermore, the March Statement was simply\n\na statement of present intent and it included the caveat, “[a]s always, FDA may at any time\n\nrevisit a decision to exercise enforcement discretion.” March Statement (emphasis added). It\n\ndoes not bind FDA to any future action or inaction, and does not lay out any discrete boundary\n\nbetween enforcement and non-enforcement.         It is the sort of ad hoc, context-bound non-\n\nenforcement pronouncement that the Crowley court suggested would inherently implicate an\n\nagency’s unreviewable enforcement discretion. Crowley, 37 F.3d at 677.\n\n       This case is also distinguishable from those precedents where the courts were willing to\n\nadopt the Crowley approach. In Crowley, the Court of Appeals observed that expressions of\n\nbroad enforcement policy are more likely to be direct interpretations of the commands of the\n\nsubstantive statue rather than the sort of mingled assessments of fact, policy, and law that drive\n\nan individual enforcement decision and are peculiarly within the agency’s expertise and\n\ndiscretion.   Crowley, 37 F.3d at 677.     Thus, in the cases where courts have reviewed an\n\nenforcement policy, they have emphasized that their review was limited to the question of\n\nwhether or not the agency’s express statement of policy unlawfully construed a statute.

To the extent that it does convey some legal principle, plaintiffs concede that\n\nFDA’s interpretation of the FDCA is in line with theirs: uncustomized compounding of 17P is\n\nunlawful. Pls.’ Mem. in Opp. to Amici Curiae Brief [Dkt. # 14] at 2. The March Statement\n\nsimply assesses the considerations that have led it to anticipate that enforcement action against\n\nparticular compounding pharmacies will not be warranted. This is the type of analysis that the\n\nCrowley court found to be peculiarly within the agency’s expertise and discretion, and therefore\n\npresumptively unreviewable.\n\n       Along the same lines, the Crowley court also explained that agency policies – as opposed\n\nto enforcement decisions – might be amenable to review because agencies generally provide\n\nstatements of reasons when they formally announce broadly applicable guidelines, while\n\nstatements justifying individual decisions to forego enforcement tend to be cursory, ad hoc, or\n\npost hoc. Crowley, 37 F.3d at 677. “These latter cases confront courts . . . with the task of\n\n\n\n\n                                                26\n\fteasing meaning out of agencies’ side comments, form letters, litigation documents, and informal\n\ncommunications.” Id.\n\n       This reasoning also suggests that the March Statement is not subject to review. It is a\n\nshort summary of FDA’s position, which appears to have been issued to quell confusion\n\ngenerated by plaintiffs’ efforts to disseminate their own characterization of that position. March\n\nStatement (“FDA understands that the manufacturer of Makena, KV Pharmaceuticals, has sent\n\nletters to pharmacists indicating that FDA will no longer exercise enforcement discretion with\n\nregard to compounded versions of Makena. This is not correct.”).\n\n       At the hearing, plaintiffs argued that the press release qualifies as a Crowley policy\n\nstatement, noting that even less formal documents have been found to be subject to review. Tr.\n\nat 38–39, citing OGS Bulk Ships, Inc., 132 F.2d at 808 (agency letters); Center for Auto Safety,\n\nInc. v. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 342 F. Supp. 2d at 1 (D.D.C. 2004)\n\n(same); Chiang v. Kempthorne, 503 F. Supp. 2d at 343 (D.D.C. 2007) (informal guidelines). But\n\neven though the documents were “informal” in the sense that they were not subject to notice and\n\ncomment rulemaking procedures, they contained the elements the Crowley court described:\n\nexpress statements of generally applicable policy and explanations for the reasons behind the\n\npolicies. OGS Bulk Ships, Inc., 132 F.3d at 811; Center for Auto Safety, 342 F. Supp. 2d at 6–8,\n\n13; Chiang, 503 F. Supp. 2d at 347, 351–52. Thus, the courts were able to determine in those\n\ncases whether the agencies’ policies were in accordance with Congressional intent, and those\n\ncases are distinguishable from the situation here.\n\n       Finally, Crowley noted that it might be necessary to recognize an exception to the\n\npresumption of non-reviewability for statements of enforcement policy because an\n\nannouncement of a broad policy against enforcement poses special risks that the agency has\n\n\n\n                                                27\n\fconsciously and expressly adopted a general policy that is “so extreme as to amount to an\n\nabdication of its statutory responsibilities.” Crowley, 37 F.3d at 677, citing Chaney, 470 U.S. at\n\n833 n.4. Plaintiffs argue that is exactly what happened in this case:\n\n               FDA has abdicated its duty under 21 U.S.C. § 360cc(a) not to subvert the\n               grant of orphan drug exclusivity that Congress intended parties in\n               plaintiffs’ position to have . . . and its duty under . . . 21 U.S.C. § 393(a) to\n               “(1) promote the public health by promptly and efficiently reviewing\n               clinical research and taking appropriate action on the marketing of\n               regulated products in a timely manner; (2) with respect to such products,\n               protect the public health by ensuring that . . . (B) human . . . drugs are safe\n               and effective . . . .”\n\nPls.’ Opp. at 22 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       But this argument has both legal and factual flaws that can be derived even from the\n\nfactual allegations in the complaint.      FDA’s March Statement does not “consciously and\n\nexpressly” indicate that it will never bring enforcement actions against unlawful compounders,\n\nor that it will never bring enforcement actions against unlawful compounders of 17P. Moreover,\n\nthe cases where courts find agency policy to be so extreme as to amount to an abdication of\n\ngovernmental responsibility have been civil rights cases.       See, e.g., Adams v. Richardson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"312132\"><a href=\"/opinion/312132/kenneth-adams-v-elliot-l-richardson-individuallyand-as-secretary-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1159</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1010</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (E.D. Tex. 1982). And the fact\n\nthat those opinions preceded Chaney suggests that they provide little precedential value here. 14\n\n       In Adams, the D.C. Circuit held that by continuing to give federal funding to segregated\n\npublic schools, appellants – the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (“HEW”); and the\n\nDirector of HEW’s Office of Civil Rights – had abdicated their duty to enforce Title VI of the\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1964. 480 F.2d at 1161–63. At the time of the Adams decision, as still\n\n\n14      Citing Adams, Justice Rehnquist’s opinion in Chaney noted that “[w]e do not have in this\ncase . . . a situation where it could justifiably be found that the agency has ‘consciously and\nexpressly adopted a general policy’ that is so extreme as to amount to an abdication of its\nstatutory responsibilities,” but stated, “we express no opinion on whether such decisions would\nbe unreviewable under § 701(a)(2).” Chaney, 470 U.S. at 833 n.4.\n                                                  28\n\ftoday, Title VI provided that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the ground of race,\n\ncolor, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be\n\nsubjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”\n\nId. at 1161 n.1. The statute “directed” all federal agencies with the authority to provide federal\n\nfunding to effectuate that provision by either terminating or refusing to grant assistance to\n\nprograms engaging in discriminatory conduct or by any other means authorized by law. Id. at\n\n1162–63. HEW had continued to provide federal funds to schools without regard to whether\n\nthey engaged in racial segregation. Id. at 1162. The Court emphasized that HEW was not\n\nsimply neglecting certain schools while carrying out a “generally effective enforcement\n\nprogram,” but rather, that it was funding all schools as matter of general policy. Id. at 1162.\n\nThis, it found, constituted a complete abdication of its statutory duty. Id. The Supreme Court in\n\nAdams also found that the express language of Title VI not only required the agency to enforce\n\nthe Act, but also set out two alternative means of enforcement that the agency was bound to use.\n\nId. at 1162–63. By failing to adhere to one of these alternative means of enforcement, the Court\n\nfound, HEW was derelict in its duty to enforce the Act. Id.\n\n       The defendants in Adams argued that the enforcement of Title VI was committed to\n\nagency discretion, and was therefore not reviewable by the courts. Id. at 1161. But here,\n\nplaintiffs challenge only FDA’s decision with respect to compounded 17P; they do not allege\n\nthat FDA is refusing to enforce the FDCA’s compounding provisions across the board “as a\n\nmatter of general policy. Moreover, Adams did not implicate the concerns that would be raised\n\nby telling an agency how to allocate its valuable enforcement resources; the case involved the\n\ngovernment’s continuing grant of federal funds to segregated institutions. Id. at 1161–62. Most\n\nimportantly, the Court found that Title VI expressly required the agency to enforce its provisions\n\n\n\n                                               29\n\fand set forth specific enforcement procedures. Id. at 1162. This aligns with the Supreme\n\nCourt’s later decision in Chaney and is distinguishable from instant situation because those\n\nprovisions are absent from the FDCA.            Therefore, this case involving one company’s\n\ncompetitive advantage does not in any way resemble the extreme abdication of statutory\n\nresponsibility to enforce fundamental rights that the Supreme Court confronted in Adams. See\n\nalso Young, 544 F. Supp. at 1013–17 (finding, based in part on Adams, that the court could\n\nreview a class action claim that HUD had abdicated its duty under several statutes to eliminate\n\nfinancial participation by the federal government in illegal racial discrimination by refusing to\n\ndecline federal funding to local housing authorities that engage in racially discriminatory housing\n\npractices).\n\n       Accordingly, the Court finds that the March Statement is a presumptively unreviewable\n\nexercise of FDA’s enforcement discretion, and not a reviewable statement of policy.\n\n   C. Even if the March Statement constitutes a reviewable enforcement policy, it has been\n      superseded.\n\n       Even if the Court were to assume that the March Statement constitutes a universally\n\napplicable statement that FDA would, as a matter of policy, stay its hand and exercise\n\nenforcement discretion with respect to the entire class of non-customized compounded products\n\nthat contain 17P, that policy has been superseded by FDA’s June Statement, along with the\n\nQuestions and Answers document. The June Statement states: “FDA emphasizes that it is\n\napplying      its   normal   enforcement   policies   for   compounded   drugs   to   compounded\n\nhydroxyprogesterone caproate.” June Statement. It goes on to explain that compounding should\n\nnot exceed the scope of traditional pharmacy compounding and that the agency prioritizes\n\nenforcement actions using a risk-based approach. Id. And if there was any lingering confusion,\n\nthe Questions and Answers document clears it up. It answers the question, “Does that mean that\n\n                                                 30\n\fthe FDA does not intend to take enforcement action against the compounders of\n\nhydroxyprogesterone caproate?” with a definitive “no.” Questions and Answers.\n\n           Plaintiffs argue that those two documents did not alter the agency’s previously announced\n\npolicy of non-enforcement because they did not expressly commit the agency to taking\n\nenforcement action. Compl. ¶ 94. 15 To prove that point, plaintiffs point to the fact that the FDA\n\nhas not brought any enforcement actions against illegal compounders of 17P. See Pls’ Opp. at 4-\n\n6; Tr. at 44 (Attorney for plaintiffs: “But they’re not enforcing it. Words without actions don’t\n\ndo anything.”).       This argument simply serves to demonstrate the basic deficiency in the\n\ncomplaint: the fact that plaintiffs are challenging an FDA decision (or series of decisions) not to\n\ninitiate enforcement action, rather than its stated policy on whether and how the statute should be\n\nenforced. 16\n\n    III.       Plaintiffs fail to state a claim under Count IV.\n\n           Count IV of the complaint alleges that FDA is permitting the foreign-manufactured active\n\npharmaceutical ingredient for compounded 17P to be imported into the United States in violation\n\nof section 381(a) of the FDCA. Compl. ¶123.\n\n           The FDCA requires any foreign establishment that manufactures, prepares, propagates,\n\ncompounds, or processes a drug to be imported into the United States to both “immediately\n\nregister” with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, 21 U.S.C. §§ 321(d), 360(i)(1)(A),\n\n\n15     This represents something of a reversal for plaintiffs, who advanced the position in\nanother lawsuit that FDA has become increasingly more direct in its public communications\nconcerning its enforcement priorities, and that it left “no room for doubt” that it considered bulk\ncompounding to be unlawful. Compl. and Appl. for Prelim. Inj., K-V Pharma. Co. v. Cook, Case\n1:12-cv-2491, at ¶¶ 5, 47 (July 17, 2012 N.D. Ga).\n\n16     The Court notes that plaintiffs’ complaint contains no claim that FDA has failed to act in\naccordance with the “normal enforcement policies” FDA claims in its June Statement to be\napplying with regard to illegal compounders of 17P.\n\n                                                  31\n\fand provide the Secretary with a list of all its imported drugs and devices, id. §§ 360(i)(2),\n\n360(j). Under Section 381(a), the Secretary of the Treasury “shall deliver to the Secretary of\n\nHealth and Human Services, upon his request,” samples of the product being imported or offered\n\nfor import into the United States. Id. § 381(a). In addition, the Secretary of Health and Human\n\nServices “shall furnish to the Secretary of the Treasury” a list of registered foreign\n\nestablishments and “shall request that if any drugs, devices, or tobacco products manufactured,\n\nprepared, propagated, compounded, or processed in an establishment not so registered are\n\nimported or offered for import into the United States, samples of such drugs, devices, or tobacco\n\nproducts be delivered to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.” Id. 17 “If it appears from\n\nthe examination of such samples or otherwise that . . . such article is adulterated, misbranded, or\n\nin violation of section 355 of this title . . . then such article shall be refused admission,” with\n\nlimited exceptions. Id. 18\n\n       Count IV alleges that the foreign-manufactured API for compounded 17P “appears to be\n\n– and, indeed, is – an unapproved new drug and, when imported or offered for import into the\n\nUnited States, appears to be – and, indeed, is – in violation of Section 355.” Compl. ¶ 121. It\n\nasserts that FDA is in violation of section 381(a) because “[s]ince March 30, 2011 and\n\ncontinuing to the present, Defendants have been, and are, allowing the import of such API for\n\ncompounded 17P.” Id. ¶ 123.\n\n       FDA submits that an alleged failure to enforce the rules against the importation of\n\nunlawful substances is presumptively unreviewable, and plaintiffs do not contest that\n\n\n17      The complaint does not specify whether the API for 17P that FDA is allegedly permitting\nto enter into the United States is coming from registered or unregistered foreign facilities.\n\n18      If an imported article is refused admission, the Secretary of the Treasury “shall cause the\ndestruction of any such article” unless it is “exported . . . within ninety days.” 21 U.S.C. §\n381(a).\n                                                32\n\fproposition.

FDA’s decision as to a\n\nparticular article offered for import, like its decision as to enforcement against a particular\n\ncompany in a particular factual setting, is within FDA’s enforcement discretion.”). But the\n\ncomplaint does not allege the existence of a policy, and even if one concludes that section 381(a)\n\nimposes a mandatory, and not a discretionary, obligation, the complaint fails to state a claim\n\nupon which relief could be granted.\n\n   A. The complaint does not allege the existence of a reviewable policy.\n\n       At the outset, the Court notes that plaintiffs do not point to any reviewable FDA\n\nstatement of policy that explicitly or implicitly permits unlawful imports, and the complaint\n\ncontains no non-conclusory allegation that such a policy exists. To the extent plaintiffs are\n\narguing that the language in the complaint asserting that “[s]ince March 30, 2011, and continuing\n\nto the present, Defendants have been, and are, allowing the import of [the] API for compounded\n\n17P,” reasonably leads to the inference that FDA has a policy, the Court finds that this vague\n\nstatement is insufficient to support such an inference under Twombly and Iqbal. Iqbal, 556 U.S.\n\nat 678 (A pleading must offer more than “labels and conclusions” or a “formulaic recitation of\n\nthe elements of a cause of action.”), quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555; see Compl. ¶¶ 121–23.\n\nFurthermore, although the complaint asserts that the March Statement “announc[es] implicitly\n\nthat they would allow such imports,” Compl. ¶ 124, the March Statement does not even mention\n\nthe import of components of compounded 17P.

Even if the complaint contained sufficient factual allegations to support the existence of a\n       reviewable policy, it does not allege that the policy violates section 381(a).\n\n        Moreover, even if the Court were to accept the conclusory assertions in the complaint as\n\nsupporting the existence of a reviewable policy, Count IV fails to state a claim under section\n\n381(a) because the complaint does not allege that the policy is illegal.\n\n        Plaintiffs maintain that the section 381(a) “mandates the universal exclusion of foreign\n\ndrugs that are in violation of Section 355, whether the factories that manufactured them are\n\nregistered or not,” and they cite Beaty v. FDA, -- F. Supp. 2d --, Civ. Case No. 11-289(RJL),\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1021048</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.D.C. Mar. 27, 2012), in support of that contention. Pls.’ Opp. at 31. In\n\nBeaty, another court in this district examined the language of section 381(a) to determine\n\nwhether it satisfied the Chaney requirements. Id. at *1. In that case, a foreign wholesaler of a\n\ndrug began exporting the drug to state departments of corrections within the United States for\n\nuse in lethal injections. Id. at *2. The company had neither registered with the FDA nor listed\n\nits drug product with the FDA. Id. FDA detained one shipment of the drug on the ground that it\n\nwas misbranded, yet proceeded to release the shipment into the United States anyway. Id. It\n\n\n\n19      The Court also struggles to find any “final agency action” to review here. Only “final\nagency actions” are reviewable under the APA. See Nat’l Ass’n of Home Builders v. U.S. Army\nCorps of Eng’rs, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1272</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1278 (D.C. Cir. 2005). For an action to be “final,” it must\n“mark the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process,” and “be one by which rights\nor obligations have been determined, or from which legal consequences will flow.” Bennett v.\nSpear, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118096\"><a href=\"/opinion/118096/bennett-v-spear/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 177–78 (1997). In the D.C. Circuit, the second requirement is met if an\naction “imposes an obligation, denies a right or fixes some legal relationship.” Home Builders,\n417 F.3d at 1278 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Plaintiffs have not identified\nany action that imposes any obligation, denies any right, or fixes any legal relationship. They do\nnot allege that FDA engaged in some decisionmaking process which led to the decision to allow\nimports of the API for 17P. And they have not pointed to any particular shipment or shipments\nof the API that FDA permitted into the United States.\n                                                   34\n\fdetained another shipment shortly after on the basis that the drug was an “unapproved new\n\ndrug,” yet after receiving correspondence from a state department of corrections indicating that\n\nthe drug was necessary for use in lethal injections, it released the shipments into the United\n\nStates. Id. In total, FDA released seven shipments into the United States. Id. The amended\n\ncomplaint in that case alleged that FDA had acted contrary to law, in an arbitrary and capricious\n\nmanner, and in abuse of its discretion when it allowed shipments of the misbranded and\n\nunapproved new drug to be imported into the United States, and sought a permanent injunction\n\nprohibiting the FDA from releasing future shipments into interstate commerce. Id. at *3. FDA\n\nargued that the release of the drug was an act of “enforcement discretion.” Id.\n\n         In analyzing section 381(a) under the Chaney test, the court first focused on the word\n\n“shall”: “if it appears from the examination of such samples,” or otherwise, that the article is\n\nmisbranded, “then such article shall be refused admission,” id. at *1, citing 21 U.S.C. § 381(a)\n\n(emphasis added). The court found that Congress’s use of the word “shall” revealed sufficient\n\nintent to circumscribe agency enforcement discretion. Id. at *5–6. Furthermore, it found that\n\n“the statute provides the FDA with a standard to apply during its examination of the imported\n\ndrugs – specifically, to determine whether the drug ‘appears’ to be misbranded, adulterated, or\n\nunapproved.” Id. at *8.     Accordingly, the court found that “[h]aving taken the steps to detain\n\nand determine that the foreign shipments contained a misbranded and unapproved new drug, the\n\nFDA was required under the FDCA to reject the shipments in the interest of public safety.” Id.\n\nat *7.\n\n         Here, “plaintiffs are not seeking review of any particular FDA decision as to an article\n\noffered for import.” Pls.’ Opp. at 33 n.34. Indeed, they concede – apparently in direct conflict\n\nwith Beaty – that “FDA’s decision as to a particular article offered for import, like its decision as\n\n\n\n                                                 35\n\fto enforcement against a particular company in a particular factual setting is within FDA’s\n\nenforcement discretion.” Id. Rather, they argue that in accordance with Beaty, section 381(a)\n\nrequires FDA to deny admission to a drug offered for import that appears to be in violation of\n\nsection 355. See Pls.’ Mot. for TRO/PI at 35–36. And they assert that FDA has neglected that\n\nduty by failing to reject shipments of “unapproved 17P API not shown to be destined for lawful\n\nuse.” Pls.’ Opp. at 31–32.\n\n       But the problem is that the complaint simply assumes that every shipment of the\n\ningredient for 17P appears to violate section 355. Yet the complaint itself establishes that 17P\n\ncan be compounded lawfully under certain circumstances, Compl. ¶ 46, and plaintiffs concede\n\nthat the API can therefore be lawfully imported in certain circumstances, Tr. at 34:18–22\n\n(Counsel for plaintiffs: “if it appears from the description of the shipment that what it is is active\n\npharmaceutical ingredient from an unapproved source and it’s not for personal importation, then\n\nit appears to be in violation of Section 355”) (emphasis added); id. 53:6–20 (conceding that there\n\nare a group of patients using compounded 17P legally and that these 17P compounds are lawful).\n\nIn cases where the substance is being imported for lawful customized compounding, it would be\n\nexempt from section 355. Pls.’ Opp. at 32.\n\n       According to FDA, “it is usually not possible to evaluate at the border whether the\n\npharmacy that eventually receives the foreign-manufactured API will compound it [lawfully],”\n\nwhich would render the API exempt from section 355 and permissible for import. 20 Defs.’ Mem.\n\nat 28. And plaintiffs agree that API that will be used for lawful compounding is exactly the same\n\n\n20      Plaintiffs attempt to get around this ambiguity by arguing that there are methods FDA\ncould use at the border to determine whether a particular sample of API is intended for use in\nlawful or unlawful compounds. Pls.’ Opp. at 32. But this does not cure the problem that the\ncomplaint fails to sufficiently allege that any shipment of API for 17P “appeared” to violate\nsection 355 at the time of import.\n\n                                                 36\n\fsubstance as API that will be used for unlawful compounding. Pls.’ Opp. at 32. So, while the\n\ncomplaint alleges that shipments of the API for compounded 17P have entered and are\n\ncontinuing to enter the United States, and that FDA is permitting their entry, the complaint is\n\ndevoid of the factual allegations needed to support the conclusory assertion in Count IV that the\n\nshipments contain a substance that “appears” to violate section 355. Thus, it fails to state a claim\n\nthat FDA ever violated section 381(a).\n\n   C. This case is not controlled by Adams.\n\n       To the extent plaintiffs once again point the Court to the Supreme Court’s pre-Chaney\n\ndecision in Adams and argue that an agency’s dereliction of duty is reviewable, the Court finds\n\nthat Adams does not apply here.\n\n       First, as stated above, the Court finds that plaintiffs’ complaint fails to assert that FDA\n\nhas neglected any statutory duty, so Adams is inapplicable.         Moreover, as with plaintiffs’\n\nallegations in Counts I through III, the allegations in Count IV that FDA has permitted illegal\n\nsubstances to enter the country concern only a small subset of violators in the course of a\n\ngenerally effective program. Cf. Adams, 480 F.2d at 1162. The complaint does not allege that\n\nFDA has failed to enforce a particular import restriction in the FDCA altogether. It merely\n\nalleges that FDA has permitted the import of one particular unlawful compound. This does not\n\namount to the sort of abdication of a statutory duty that troubled the Supreme Court in Adams.\n\n       Accordingly, plaintiffs’ allegations under Count IV are insufficient to state a claim under\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n\n\n\n\n                                                37\n\f                                        CONCLUSION\n\n       Because the claims in Counts I through III of plaintiffs’ complaint are unreviewable and\n\nCount IV fails to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), defendants’\n\nmotion to dismiss will be granted. A separate order will issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                             AMY BERMAN JACKSON\n                                             United States District Judge\n\nDATE: September 6, 2012\n\n\n\n\n                                               38\n\f</pre>",
