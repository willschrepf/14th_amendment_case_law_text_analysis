We dismiss the appeal as moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1983, the SSD, the Board of Education of the City of St. Louis (City Board), the Caldwell and Liddell plaintiffs, and the United States entered into an agreement and subsequently submitted a special education plan to the district court to settle claims involving special education services, arising from the pending desegregation litigation. The plan provided for certain students to receive special education services, teacher transfers and exchanges, grievance procedures, and the establishment of a funding mechanism.  The plan also provided for direct city-to-county transfers of students with moderate and severe disabilities who require more than 50% of their instructional time in self-contained special education classrooms.  These students are designated as Phase II and Phase III students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1985, after a fairness hearing, the district court approved the plan to be implemented in the 1985-86 school year.  The district court noted that the SSD was not required under the plan to accept a specific number of Phase II or III direct transfer students, but provided that acceptance of students was to be decided cooperatively by the local school districts and the SSD on the basis of space availability.  An added restriction was that the assignment of transfer students could not contribute to racial segregation.  In the first two years under the plan, the SSD accepted only 3 Phase II direct transfer students out of over 400 applicants.  For the next eight years, the SSD has accepted no Phase II or III direct transfer students while over 1,100 students have applied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1995, the City Board negotiated with the SSD to accept fifteen Phase II direct transfer students for the 1995-96 school year.  The SSD, however, did not enroll any direct transfer students in that year or in the 1996-97 school year.  The City Board filed a motion to enforce the SSD's agreement to accept fifteen direct transfer students.  The SSD argued it was not contractually obligated to accept direct transfer students during the 1997-98 school year.  The SSD further argued that under the plan it was not required to accept a particular number of direct transfer students, the host district must first determine the availability of space or the appropriate special education service, and assignment could not contribute to racial segregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected the SSD's arguments and concluded that the record established that the SSD had not made a good-faith effort to comply with the plan.  The district court granted the City Board's motion, concluding that, although the 1995-96 agreement might no longer be binding on the SSD, it represented evidence of what would be a reasonable number of students for the SSD to accept in a given school year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City Board argues that because fifteen Phase II students were accepted and enrolled in the SSD for the 1997-98 school year, this appeal is moot.  We agree.  During oral argument, the SSD agreed that this appeal is moot as to the fifteen students.  Due to educational and practical considerations, the SSD indicated it would not return the fifteen students even were we to reverse the district court's order.  The order which is the subject of this appeal does not address future years.  Because there is no effective relief for us to grant, we conclude this appeal is moot.  See Beck v.
