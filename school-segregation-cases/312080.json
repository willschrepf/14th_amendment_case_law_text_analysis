Dopp and\n\nJay  A. Pritzker.   The  litigation stems  from an  oral contract\n\nbetween the two men  concerning the purchase of the  Dorado Beach\n\nHotel Corporation  (DBHC), a company that controlled a complex of\n\nhotels and golf courses situated on  1,000 beachfront acres along\n\nthe north shore of Puerto Rico.\n\n          In an earlier opinion we  upheld a jury verdict finding\n\nPritzker liable to Dopp, but vacated both the jury's damage award\n\nand  the  trial  court's  rulings in  connection  with  equitable\n\nrelief.   See Dopp  v. HTP  Corp., 947 F.2d  506 (1st  Cir. 1991)\r                                           \n\n(Dopp II).  On remand, the district court held a  second trial to\r                  \n\ndetermine Dopp's entitlement to various forms of relief.  After a\n\njury returned a series  of special findings, see Fed.  R. Civ. P.\r                                                          \n\n49(a), the district court entered a revised judgment.\n\n          Both  sides now appeal.1  Their appeals require that we\n\nexamine:   (1) whether  the district  court lawfully  denied Dopp\n\nresolution  (a form  of rescission) as  a remedy  for contractual\n\nbreach;  (2)  whether  the  jury's assessment  of  full  damages,\n\n$17,000,000,  was either  excessive, as  Pritzker claims,  or too\n                    \r                              \n\n     1The three  appeals with which  we are concerned  today were\nconsolidated for  oral argument with three  other appeals arising\nout of  the same case.   Since the latter  appeals (Nos. 93-2374,\n94-1128, and 94-1129,  respectively) involve segregable issues   \nthey  focus on  a  series of  financing  agreements entered  into\nbetween Dopp  and three financiers, Robert  Yari, Lincoln Realty,\nInc.,  and Baird  Patrick  &amp; Co.,  for  the apparent  purpose  of\nfunding Dopp's litigatory  efforts    we will address  them in  a\nseparate and subsequent opinion.\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nniggardly, as Dopp  asserts; and (3)  whether the district  court\n\nappropriately  awarded  Dopp  attorneys'  fees   and  prejudgment\n\ninterest,  based  on its  determination  that  Pritzker displayed\n\nobstinacy  in  conducting  the   litigation.    After  a  careful\n\nexamination  of the record and  the applicable law,  we affirm in\n\npart, reverse in part, and remand.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\n\n          We  divide  this  segment   of  our  opinion  into  two\n\nsubparts,  treating  the  facts  and   the  travel  of  the  case\n\nseparately.  In doing so, we write somewhat sparingly because the\n\nbackground of  the litigation  is already well-documented.   See,\r                                                                          \n\ne.g., id. at 508-09; Dopp v.  HTP Corp., 831 F. Supp. 939, 941-42\r                                                 \n\n(D.P.R. 1993) (Dopp III);  Dopp v. HTP Corp.,  755 F. Supp.  491,\r                                                      \n\n492-94 (D.P.R. 1991) (Dopp I).\r                                      \n\n                          A.  The Facts.\r                                    A.  The Facts.\r                                                 \n\n          In  May of 1984, Dopp wangled an option to acquire DBHC\n\nfor  the approximate price of $40,500,000.  He secured the option\n\nwith a $2,000,000  letter of credit supplied  with the assistance\n\nof Island Resorts,  S.A. (IRSA), a  Panamanian corporation.   The\n\noption agreement specified that the  underlying purchase-and-sale\n\ntransaction would be consummated no later than December 3, 1984.\n\n          Though playing for high stakes, Dopp had relatively few\n\nchips of  his own.   Thus, he  immediately set out  in search  of\n\nfinancial backing.  He encountered heavy seas.  With time running\n\nout,  Dopp turned  to  Pritzker.   The  parties reached  an  oral\n\nagreement on November 30, 1984.  Under its terms, Pritzker agreed\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nto  provide the funds needed  to seal the  purchase and reimburse\n\nDopp's  and IRSA's costs.  In exchange, Dopp agreed that Pritzker\n\nwould  receive an 80% equity  interest in a  holding company that\n\nwould be formed  to acquire  DBHC's stock, and,  as a  sweetener,\n\nthat  a Pritzker affiliate would be given a long-term contract to\n\nmanage the hotels coincident with the closing.\n\n          The parties  formed HTP  Corporation (HTP) to  serve as\n\nthe holding company.   Dopp controlled 20% of HTP's  stock in the\n\nfirst  instance, but ceded some shares to IRSA in accordance with\n\na prior arrangement.  In the end, Dopp retained a 12% interest in\n\nHTP.    Meanwhile,  Pritzker,  through a  nominee,  held  an  80%\n\ninterest.2\n\n          On December 3,  1984, Pritzker presented  two documents\n\nto Dopp that supposedly embodied their oral  agreement.  Pritzker\n\ninjected  into one  of these  documents   the  stock subscription\n\nagreement  (SSA)    a  clause granting  the majority  shareholder\n\n(Pritzker) an option to retire the stock held by the two minority\n\nshareholders (Dopp and IRSA) for $50,000 per share, or $1,000,000\n\nin the aggregate, at any time within 10 years.  With the purchase\n\noption due  to expire, the move put  Dopp at a huge disadvantage.\n\nHe signed the documents.\n\n          After HTP obtained a one-day extension from the seller,\n\nit  closed the underlying transaction  on December 4,  1984.  HTP\n\nbought  DBHC's stock  for  $36,846,000, net  of adjustments;  the\n                    \r                              \n\n     2For  ease in  reference,  we ignore  the  nominee, a  shell\ncorporation, and  treat  Pritzker as  if  he, himself,  were  the\nmajority shareholder.\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nseller canceled  the letter  of credit; Pritzker  reimbursed Dopp\n\nand IRSA  for expenses advanced  ($710,000); and Dopp  received a\n\nprearranged $200,000 \"consulting fee.\"\n\n                       B.  The Litigation.\r                                 B.  The Litigation.\r                                                   \n\n          In  mid-1988, Dopp  initiated a  diversity suit  in the\n\nUnited  States District  Court for  the District of  Puerto Rico,\n\nnaming  Pritzker,  HTP, and  several  others as  defendants.   He\n\nalleged,   inter  alia,  that  the  buy-out  option  in  the  SSA\r                                \n\ncontravened  the oral contract, and  that his consent  to the SSA\n\nhad been unfairly procured.  After  a 10-day trial, a jury  found\n\nin  Dopp's favor, determining that the parties had formed an oral\n\ncontract on November 30, 1984, and that, thereafter, Pritzker had\n\nemployed deceit and duress to pressure Dopp into signing the SSA,\n\nthereby   violating  the   oral   contract.     Based  on   these\n\ndeterminations,  the jury  awarded  Dopp  $2,000,000 in  damages.\n\nThereafter,  the district  court,  acting in  response to  Dopp's\n\nmotion under  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 59(e), declared  the SSA  null and\n\nvoid in  respect to Dopp's shares  in HTP, but  declined to order\n\nresolution of the oral contract.3\n\n          The  first trial  produced no  fewer than  ten appeals.\n\nAfter considering them, we upheld the liability determination but\n\nvacated  both the damage award  and the district court's remedial\n\nrulings, see  Dopp II, 947  F.2d at  520.  We  then remanded  for\r                               \n                    \r                              \n\n     3Resolution  is  a  remedy  that,  under  Puerto  Rico  law,\noperates in much the same way as rescission.  See  P.R. Laws Ann.\r                                                           \ntit. 31,   3052 (1991); see also Dopp II, 947 F.2d at 510-11.  We\r                                                  \ndiscuss the nature of the remedy at greater length in Part II(A),\ninfra.\r               \n\n                                7\r\r\n\nfurther  relief-related proceedings, indicating that, \"assuming a\n\ncompetent evidentiary  predicate, the jury may  be instructed on,\n\nand asked to  determine, variously:  (1) full damages  . . .; (2)\n\nthe amount of  accessory damages, if any, [pursuant to annulment]\n\n. . .; and (3) the amount of accessory damages, if any, [pursuant\n\nto  resolution] .  . . .\"   Id.  at 519.   We also  observed that\r                                         \n\n\"annulment and resolution are  mutually exclusive remedies,\"  and\n\nthat  \"the plaintiff may  or may not  . . .  satisfy the district\n\ncourt that he is entitled to  an order for resolution of the Oral\n\nContract.\"  Id. at 520.\r                         \n\n          On March 27, 1993,  a second jury rendered a  series of\n\nspecial findings.   The jury fixed the amount  of full damages at\n\n$17,000,000, and  the amount  of damages ancillary  to resolution\n\n(if resolution were ultimately  ordered) at either $19,621,000 or\n\n$210,071,000,  depending   on  whether  the  court   might  order\n\nresolution  in natura or in kind.  See  Dopp III, 831 F. Supp. at\r                                                          \n\n942 &amp; n.5.  The jury determined that, if  Dopp elected annulment,\n\nthere would be no accessory damages.  See id.\r                                                       \n\n          On September  9, 1993, the district  court made certain\n\nsupplementary  rulings.   Among  other things,  the court  denied\n\nPritzker's motions for judgment as a  matter of law and for a new\n\ntrial;  put a  damper on  Dopp's quest  for  resolution; rejected\n\nDopp's motion to alter  or amend the judgment; upheld  the jury's\n\nassessment of full damages; and awarded Dopp prejudgment interest\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nand attorneys' fees.4  See id. at 943-52.

RESOLUTION\n\n          In our earlier opinion, we determined that up  to three\n\nmain remedies might  be available to  Dopp, namely, annulment  of\n\nthe SSA, resolution of the oral  contract, or full damages.  Dopp\r                                                                           \n\nII, 947 F.2d at 519.   We noted that, in the event  Dopp achieved\r            \n\neither  annulment  or  resolution,  the  jury  might  also  award\n\naccessory damages.   See id.  We defined the  third remedy, \"full\r                                      \n\ndamages,\" as comprising  \"the amount of damages  which would make\n\nDopp whole in the absence of either annulment or resolution . . .\n\n.\"   Id.  Withal, we cautioned that the availability of any given\r                  \n\nremedy  depended  upon  the  existence  (or  nonexistence)  of  a\n\n\"competent evidentiary predicate.\"  Id.\r                                                 \n\n          At the second trial, Judge Pieras instructed the jurors\n\nas  to each  of  these  three  remedies  and  commanded  them  to\n\ndetermine on a contingent  basis the amount of money  damages, if\n\nany, that  each  anodyne  actually  would  entail.    The  jurors\n\ncomplied.  Following the jury's calculation of potential damages,\n\nthe judge asked  Dopp to elect a remedy.   Dopp chose resolution.\n\nMuch  to his  dismay, the  district court  ruled that,  given the\n\nevidence, resolution was unobtainable.   Under protest, Dopp then\n\nelected an alternate remedy:  full damages.   He now beseeches us\n\n                    \r                              \n\n     4The  district court also made a number of rulings in regard\nto third parties  who claimed an interest in the  proceeds of the\nlitigation through prior arrangements  with Dopp.  See  Dopp III,\r                                                                          \n831 F.

See supra note 1.\r                            \n\n                                9\r\r\n\nto reverse the district court's denial of resolution.\n\n          In  order to  respond to  Dopp's importunings,  we must\n\ndetermine the nature of resolution under Puerto Rico  law, settle\n\nupon the proper  standard of review,  consider whether the  court\n\nbelow  paid sufficient  homage to  the lessons  of Dopp  II, and,\r                                                                     \n\nfinally, evaluate the sturdiness of the district court's ruling.\n\n                      A.

He\n          may  also demand  the rescission,  even after\n          having requested its fulfillment,  should the\n          latter appear impossible. . . .\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,   3052 (1991).\n\n          It  is  noteworthy  that   \"[n]ot  every  breach  of  a\n\ncontractual  obligation gives  rise to  a resultory  action under\n\narticle 1077.\"  Dopp II, 947 F.2d at 510-11.  To pave the way for\r                                 \n\nthe  remedy, the  unfulfilled  obligation must  be reciprocal  in\n\nnature.   See id. at  511.   Reciprocity inheres when  \"there are\r                           \n\nobligations and correlative obligations so interdependent between\n\nthemselves  that one  is the  consequence of  the other,  and the\n\nperformance of said obligation by a contracting party constitutes\n\nthe motive of the contract for the other party, and  vice versa.\"\n\nPonce v. Vidal,  65 P.R.R. 346, 351 (1945).  That is, reciprocity\r                        \n\n                                10\r\r\n\nis  basically  a  way  of  saying  that  a  particular obligation\n\nexhibits both  mutuality and essentiality    what one  might term\r                                      \n\n\"mutual essentiality.\"  This concept embodies the notion that, in\n\nthe absence of a particular mutual obligation, the contract would\n\nnever have come into being, and, thus, should cease to exist.\n\n          The Supreme  Court of Puerto Rico  recently fleshed out\n\nthis idea, observing that\n\n          not  every failure  to comply  with a  mutual\n          obligation   will   have   the    effect   of\n          terminating the contract.  For this to be the\n          case,   the  unmet  obligation   must  be  an\n          essential  obligation  or fulfillment  of the\n          obligation  must  constitute the  motive that\n          induced the  other  party to  enter into  the\n          contract.\n\nRamirez v.  Club Cala  de Palmas,      D.P.R.    ,  89 J.T.S.  22\r                                          \n\n(1989)  (revised  official  translation).     Put  bluntly,  \"the\n\nunfulfilled obligation must be the principal one.\"  Id.\r                                                                 \n\n          The  Ramirez court likewise  emphasized the overarching\r                                \n\nconcern of article 1077:   that contracts, if and  when possible,\n\nbe preserved  and ultimately  fulfilled.  See  id.   This is  the\r                                                            \n\n\"higher interest\" served by a narrow construction  of the element\n\nof reciprocity.  Id.  From all that we can discern, then, Article\r                              \n\n1077 is a remedy of last resort, reserved for situations in which\n\na party's breach dissipates the very essence of a contract.\n\n                     B.  Standard of Review.\r                               B.  Standard of Review.\r                                                     \n\n          We think it follows from this characterization that the\n\napplicability  of article 1077 in  a given case  presents a mixed\n\nquestion  of law  and fact.   The Puerto  Rico Supreme  Court has\n\nidentified reciprocity as the key principle on which article 1077\n\n                                11\r\r\n\nrests.   See Vidal,  65 P.R.R. at  351.   And though  reciprocity\r                            \n\nitself  is  wholly  a  legal  construct,  its  existence  in  any\n\nparticular contractual setting  is almost entirely contingent  on\n\nthe determination  of a series of  essentially factual questions,\n\ne.g., the subject matter of the contract, the context in which it\r              \n\narose, the  parties' intentions, their course of conduct, and the\n\nlike.    See id.  (describing reciprocity  as  a function  of the\r                          \n\n\"character\" of a particular obligation).\n\n          Indeed, to the extent that reciprocity actually resides\n\nat   the   intersection  of   mutuality  and   essentiality,  its\n\ncharacterization  as a  mixed question  of law  and fact  becomes\n\nvirtually unavoidable.  Essentiality is closely akin to, if not a\n\nspecies of,  materiality, and  courts and commentators  have long\n\nrecognized that materiality is primarily a question  of fact, the\n\nresolution of  which is  necessarily a  function  of context  and\n\ncircumstances.  See, e.g.,  Gibson v. City of Cranston,      F.3d\r                                                                \n\n   ,     (1st Cir. 1994) (No. 94-1375, slip op. at 8-9); see also\r                                                                           \n\n3A Arthur L.

Given  this  express\n\ndisclaimer, it is fanciful for Dopp to suggest  that we bound the\n\nlower court to an award of resolution the second time around.\n\n                          D.

Rather, the  unfulfilled\n\nobligation  must  be \"essential\"  to  the  contract, or,  phrased\n\nanother way, the contemplated  fulfillment of the obligation must\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nhave constituted the contract's raison d'etre.  The Ramirez court\r                                                                     \n\nput  the  point succinctly,  stating  that  resolution cannot  be\n\ngrounded in the nonfulfillment of  \"accessory\" or \"complementary\"\n\nobligations   obligations that the court described as those which\n\n\"do  not  constitute  the  real  consideration  for  executing  a\n\ncontract  and which are incorporated into the same to complete or\n\nclarify  the contracting  parties' stipulations.\"    Ramirez,    \r                                                                      \n\nD.P.R.   ,  89 J.T.S. 22 (citing  Del Toro v.

While  the  breach  of  such  an  accessory  or\n\ncomplementary obligation  \"may trigger  an action for  damages or\n\nany other  action that the  circumstances of each  case warrant,\"\n\nsuch a breach may \"never\" give rise to a rescissory  action.

This  is so,  the court  said, because\n\n\"[t]he  requirement  that  the   unfulfilled  obligation  be  the\n\nprincipal one  serves a higher interest  . . . that  promotes the\n\nfulfillment of  contracts, and  that prevents that,  by a  lesser\n\nbreach of contract, one  of the parties may release  himself from\n\nthe obligation,  either because  he  is no  longer interested  or\n\nbecause the  contract does not suit him  anymore.\"  Id.

This very\n\nuncertainty is,  in itself,  a good  indicator that  the district\n\ncourt's answer, whether affirmative or negative, is not likely to\n\nbe clearly erroneous.\n\n          In  any event, we discern  no clear error  here.  Judge\n\nPieras,  quoting  Dopp's own  testimony,  determined among  other\n\nthings that \"[p]roviding Dopp  with an unencumbered . .  . equity\r                                                             \n\ninterest  in HTP  is  not a  reciprocal  obligation of  the  Oral\n\nAgreement assumed by the defendant.   Indeed the plaintiff `fully\n\nexpected  that  there  would   be  some  reasonable  option'  and\n\ntherefore did not  rely on  the absence  of an  option clause  to\n\nenter into  the Oral Agreement.\"   Dopp III, 831 F.  Supp. at 950\r                                                     \n\n(emphasis  in  original).   We  believe that  this  assessment of\n\nDopp's  actual expectation is  supportable, and that  it alone is\n\nsufficient  to ground  a principled  conclusion that  the parties\n\nregarded the element of  non-encumbrance as an incidental, rather\n\nthan  an essential, obligation of their  contract.  If it is true\n\nthat  Dopp, prior  and  pursuant to  the  formation of  the  oral\n\ncontract,  \"fully expected  that there  would be  some reasonable\n\noption\"   as  he, himself, testified    and yet proceeded  to the\n\nwritten contract phase without settling this matter precisely, it\n\nseems eminently reasonable  for a factfinder to conclude that the\n\nelement of non-encumbrance could not have been  the raison d'etre\r                                                                           \n\nof the oral contract.\n\n          What is more, the plausibility of this conclusion rests\n\nnot  only on  Dopp's  own words,  but  also on  other  witnesses'\n\n                                18\r\r\n\ntestimony  to the  effect that, when  ownership is  closely held,\n\nbuy-out  options  are  a  regular  attribute  of  intra-corporate\n\narrangements.   For our  part, we regard  this truth  to be self-\n\nevident; indeed, it is difficult to imagine an 80% shareholder of\n\na close  corporation owning  extremely valuable assets  who would\n\nnot  routinely demand  such protection.   Pritzker may  have been\n\nmany things,  but, as Dopp well  knew, he was  neither a neophyte\n\nnor  an altruist.  Hence, Dopp could not reasonably have expected\n\nthat Pritzker  would forgo so  elementary a precaution  and leave\n\nthe minority stock unfettered.\n\n          The  interest in preservation  and ultimate fulfillment\n\nof contracts that drives article 1077, see Ramirez,     P.R. Dec.\r                                                            \n\n  , 89  J.T.S. 22,  does not  suggest a  contrary result.   Here,\n\nPritzker's breach did not  render the contract inherently infirm.\n\nTo  be sure, the breach harmed Dopp, but his insistent focus upon\n\nthe harm begs the real question.  The critical determinant of the\n\navailability  of a resultory remedy  is neither the  fact nor the\n\nmagnitude  of  the inflicted  injury,  but,  rather, whether  the\n\ndefaulting  party's breach irretrievably undermined the contract.\n\nIn  this instance,  the district  court thought  not; and  we can\n\nscarcely  conclude, based  on  the evidence  presented, that  its\n\ndecision was clearly erroneous.\n\n          In a last-ditch effort to  turn the tide, Dopp  insists\n\nthat the  unreasonableness of the particular  buy-out clause that\n\nPritzker   inserted  into  the   SSA  somehow  transmogrifies  an\n\naccessory obligation  into an  essential obligation.   We do  not\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nagree.    If  the  obligation  to  produce  an  unencumbered  12%\n\nownership  interest was not essential  before and at  the time of\n\nthe oral  contract    and,  as  we  have pointed  out,  there  is\n\nadequate evidence to support  a conclusion to that effect    then\n\nit does not matter  that the obligation took on  added importance\n\nas time went by and circumstances changed.\n\n           Dopp's other  arguments on  this issue do  not require\n\ncomment.    For  the reasons  set  forth  herein,  we uphold  the\n\ndistrict court's finding that  the obligation shirked by Pritzker\n\nlacked mutual essentiality.  Accordingly, we affirm the denial of\n\nresolution.\n\nIII.  FULL DAMAGES\r          III.  FULL DAMAGES\n\n          Because  Dopp was  not legally entitled  to resolution,\n\nhis contingent election of an alternative remedy   full damages  \n\nis both valid  and binding.   Withal, both  parties question  the\n\namount of  the damage award.   To  answer these queries,  we must\n\nexamine whether the district  court correctly instructed the jury\n\nas  to the  relevant measure of  damages and, if  so, whether the\n\njury's resultant rendition of full damages passes muster.\n\n               A.  The Trial Court's Instructions.\r                         A.  The Trial Court's Instructions.\r                                                           \n\n          Under  Dopp's rather  imaginative theory  of  the case,\n\nfull damages, properly computed,  total $60,581,000.  He contends\n\nthat  the verdict on full damages undershot this target because a\n\npinchpenny trial  court charged  the jury  in  too restrictive  a\n\nmanner.   Branding  those  instructions as  contradictory to  the\n\nteachings  of Dopp II and characterizing them as \"poorly thought-\r                               \n\n                                20\r\r\n\nout and convoluted,\" Dopp  asks us to  set aside the verdict  and\n\nmandate further  proceedings.6   We conclude  that the  court did\n\nnot commit reversible error in framing its jury instructions.\n\n          Our analysis begins, as  it must, with the text  of the\n\ndistrict  court's charge.  In  relevant part, the  judge told the\n\njury:\n\n          First  you must  render a  verdict as  to the\n          amount of  the full damages to  which Dopp is\n          entitled  based on  Pritzker's breach  of the\n          oral contract.  . .  .  Full  damages reflect\n          the  amount, if  any,  that  is necessary  to\n          compensate Dopp in the event that he does not\n          elect  to have  the Court  enter an  order of\n          annulment.  They reflect the amount necessary\n          to put Dopp in as good a position as he would\n          have been if the oral contract had been fully\n          performed so  that his shares  were not being\n          encumbered by the SSA's  buy-out clause.  The\n          amount  of full  damages are  [sic] therefore\n          the difference between  the value of what  he\n          was promised  under  November 30,  1984  oral\n          contract  and the value  of what  he actually\n          received from Pritzker  under the December 3,\n          1984 stock subscription agreement.\n\nAs we read these  words, we believe that the court  indicated, in\n\nessence,  that full  damages consisted  of the  monetary  cost of\n\nencumbrance, that is,  the value  of what Dopp  had a  legitimate\n\nright  to expect (a  12% interest in  HTP, not  encumbered in any\n\nunorthodox  way) less the value  of what he  actually received (a\n\n                    \r                              \n\n     6Dopp  also  insists  that   in  addition  to  taking  other\ncorrective action, we should annul the SSA.  He is barking up the\nwrong tree.   If Dopp  desired annulment, he  could have  elected\nthat remedy below.  See Dopp II, 947 F.2d at 519.  He did  not do\r                                         \nso.  See Dopp III, 831 F. Supp. at 942.  Absent such an election,\r                           \nDopp  cannot pursue  annulment on  appeal.   Nor is  this outcome\nunconscionable; as  a general legal principle,  \"[p]arties cannot\nhave their cake and eat  it, too.\"  United States v.  Weston, 960\r                                                                      \nF.2d 212, 215 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n                                21\r\r\n\n12%  interest   in  HTP,   subject  to  a   particularly  onerous\n\nencumbrance), measured  at the  time of  the breach  (December 3,\n\n1984).\n\n          Dopp  disagrees.   He  posits  on  appeal,  as  he  did\n\nbelow,7 that  the true measure  of full  damages is the  value of\n\nthe purchase  agreement plus a disgorgement  premium referable to\n\nPritzker's wrongful possession.  In support of this theorem, Dopp\n\ndirects our attention  to certain language contained in  Dopp II,\r                                                                          \n\nto article 1255 of the Civil Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,   3154\n\n(1991),  and  to  \"[a]n  intuitive  sense  that  an  injustice is\n\ninherent in the District's Court's formulation .  . . .\"  Because\n\nthese exhortations boil down  to a claim that the  district court\n\nmisapprehended the substantive  law on damages,  appellate review\n\nis plenary.   See Losacco v. F.D. Rich Constr. Co., 992 F.2d 382,\r                                                            \n\n384 (1st  Cir.), cert. denied,  114 S. Ct.  324 (1993); see  also\r                                                                           \n\nMcCarthy, 22 F.3d at 354.\r                  \n\n          Despite the freedom inherent  in plenary review and the\n\ngenerosity  of our efforts, we are unable to discern a cognizable\n\nlegal  basis  on which  Dopp's remedial  theory  might rest.   In\n\nparticular,  we find  baffling Dopp's  invocation of  our earlier\n\nopinion.   Nothing contained therein suggests,  by any stretch of\n\nthe  most elastic imagination, that  full damages for purposes of\n\nthis  case  could  constitute  anything  more  than the  cost  of\n\n                    \r                              \n\n     7Dopp properly  preserved  his rights  anent the  challenged\ninstructions, making  a timely objection  as required by  Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 51.  He also moved to alter or amend the judgment on this\nground, in pursuance of Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).\n\n                                22\r\r\n\nencumbrance.   Indeed,  we specifically  defined full  damages as\n\n\"the amount of damages which would make Dopp whole in the absence\n\nof either annulment or resolution,\" Dopp II, 947 F.2d at 519, and\r                                                     \n\nthe   district  court's  formulation   fits  neatly  within  this\n\nintegument.  Moreover, it is virtually a hornbook restatement and\n\napplication of the concept of contractual wholeness.  See John D.\r                                                                   \n\nCalamari &amp; Joseph M.

This so-called source   article 1255\n\nof the Civil Code   is  simply not supportive of Dopp's position.\n\nAs  its text makes clear,  article 1255 is  relevant only \"[w]hen\n\nthe nullity of  an obligation has been declared.\"  P.R.

That is not the situation here.\n\n          Dopp's  hole   card     his  stated   reliance  on  his\n\n\"intuitive  sense\" of \"injustice\"    does not shore  up his hand.\n\nThe  plea that  it embodies  lies beyond  the cognizance  of this\n\ncourt,  which necessarily deals in the concreteness of fact, law,\n\n                                23\r\r\n\nand logic, not the  fluidity of pathos  and intuition.

The Amount of Damages.\r                                                       \n\n          Using   the  formula   given   in  the   trial  court's\n\ninstructions,  the  jury calculated  Dopp's  full  damages to  be\n\n$17,000,000.    Pritzker, for  his  part, is  satisfied  with the\n\ncourt's  instructions but  not with  the amount  of damages.   He\n\nargues that the verdict  is not rationally based on  the evidence\n\npresented and,  hence, that the district court  erred in refusing\n\nto  grant his motion  for a new  trial.  In  stark contrast, Dopp\n\ncontends that the amount  is far too  scant, and that even  \"[i]f\n\nthe  jury did  exactly that  which the  district court  stated it\n\ncould  reasonably  do,\"  its  verdict  should  have been  in  the\n\nvicinity of $39,400,000.\n\n          Dopp's  contention  appears  to   be  no  more  than  a\n\nrecasting  of his  complaints about  the  charge, see  supra Part\r                                                                      \n\nIII(A),  and, at this point, the caterwauling may be rejected out\n\nof  hand.     Pritzker's  contention,   however,  raises  serious\n\nconcerns.\n                    \r                              \n\n     8This ruling reflects not only Dopp's inability to discredit\nthe instructions themselves, but also his failure to substantiate\nhis  own, alternative theory of damages.   At best, it seems that\nhis  theory, which proposes  that full damages  should include at\nleast the value of the  purchase agreement (fixed by the  jury in\nits  special findings  at $40,000,000),  might be viable  if Dopp\nproved  that  he  had the  capacity  to  close  the deal  without\nPritzker's assistance.  But the record  wholly fails to establish\nthat  fact.    Indeed,  Dopp  offered  no  such  proof,  and  all\nindications are that he  lacked the wherewithal to go  forward if\nPritzker withheld his financial backing.\n\n                                24\r\r\n\n          Because  jurors exercise  great  leeway  in  evaluating\n\nclaims and assessing  damages, appeals based on  verdict size are\n\nseldom successful.  When a disgruntled defendant complains that a\n\njury award is overgenerous, the verdict ordinarily stands \"unless\n\nit is  grossly excessive, inordinate, shocking  to the conscience\n\nof the court, or so high that it would be a  denial of justice to\n\npermit it to stand.\"  Segal v. Gilbert Color Sys., Inc., 746 F.2d\r                                                                 \n\n78, 80-81 (1st Cir. 1984) (citations and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).  Even in cases involving purely economic losses (which,\n\nby and large, are  more easily quantifiable in dollars  and cents\n\nthan, say,  damages for emotional distress),  appellate review is\n\nextremely  deferential, evincing  a  frank recognition  that \"the\n\njury is  free to  select the  highest figure  for which there  is\n\nadequate evidentiary support.\"  Kolb v.

Consequently, \"such a verdict will be\n\nreduced  or set aside only if it  is shown to exceed any rational\n\nappraisal or estimate of the damages that could be based upon the\n\nevidence before the jury.\"   Segal, 746 F.2d at 81  (citation and\r                                            \n\ninternal quotation marks omitted).\n\n          The rule that  emerges is that, within  wide limits, an\n\nappellate court  must accept a jury's  seeming extravagance, even\n\nif the court,  left to  its own  devices, would  have returned  a\n\nsubstantially  smaller  verdict.

And, moreover, the weight of the\n\nburden grows heavier when,  as now, the trial judge  has reviewed\n\nthe jury's handiwork and has ratified  its judgment.  See Ruiz v.\r                                                                        \n\nGonzalez Caraballo, 929 F.2d 31, 34 (1st Cir. 1991).\r                            \n\n          In  this  case,  the  upper  edge  of  the  universe of\n\nsustainable awards is defined by the value  of the asset owned by\n\nDopp  (the option to  acquire DBHC) as  of December 3,  1984 (the\n\ndate  of  Pritzker's breach).9    Based on  the  highest credible\n\nvaluations  contained   in  the   record,  and  recognizing   the\n\npossibility of  nonduplicative aggregation, we conclude  that the\n\njurors could have found DBHC's properties  to be worth as much as\n\n$119,055,000  in late  1984.    This  figure  is  based  upon  an\n\nappraisal of the hotel empire conducted by the Merrill Lynch Real\n\nEstate  Advisory &amp;  Appraisal  Group (Merrill  Lynch),10 read  in\n                    \r                              \n\n     9On that  date, Dopp owned  an option to  acquire DBHC.   In\nentering the  oral contract, however,  Dopp in  effect agreed  to\ntrade  that  asset for  a 20%  interest  in DBHC's  properties (a\nportion of which he would then cede to IRSA).  Thus, DBHC becomes\nthe proper barometer for measuring value.\n\n     10While Merrill Lynch issued its appraisal approximately one\nyear after the transaction closed, the district court admitted it\ninto evidence, and we think the jury could reasonably have relied\non it.  See, e.g., Federal Sav.  &amp; Loan Ins. Corp. v. Texas  Real\r                                                                           \nEstate Counselors,  Inc.,  955  F.2d  261, 268  (5th  Cir.  1992)\r                                  \n(upholding  factfinder's  reliance  on  later  appraisal  despite\nevidence of changed market conditions).\n\n                                26\r\r\n\nlight  of  testimony by  a  different  expert witness  evaluating\n\ncertain excess land not included  in the Merrill Lynch appraisal.\n\nAccording  to   this  evidence,  the   empire  had  a   value  of\n\n$110,000,000,  and the  excess land  had a  value  of $9,055,000.\n\nHence, the jury lawfully could have valued  DBHC's properties, as\n\na whole,  at $119,055,000.  In  turn, this value is  the value of\n\nthe  asset   the purchase option    for the acquisition was to be\n\nstructured in  such a  way as  to cost  Dopp nothing  (apart from\n\ncession of an  80% interest  in the acquired  properties).11   On\n\nthis  basis,  then, a  rational  jury,  apportioning the  overall\n\nvalue, could have concluded  that Dopp's anticipated 12% interest\n\nin HTP was worth $14,286,600 on the date of the breach.\n\n          Once the  jurors determined  an asset value,  they next\n\nwould have needed to determine what portion or percentage of that\n\nvalue constituted the cost  of encumbrance.  Taking the  evidence\n\nand  arguments advanced at trial most favorably to Dopp, we think\n\nthat the  jury lawfully  could have determined  that the  buy-out\n\noption eliminated virtually all the  value of Dopp's 12% interest\n\nin  HTP, save  only  for  the  meagre  price  that  Pritzker  was\n                    \r                              \n\n     11Pritzker   argues   that  the   purchase   price  (roughly\n$40,500,000) must be deducted  from the value of DBHC  before the\nvalue of Dopp's pro rata interest is assayed because the purchase\r                                  \nprice constituted an acquisition cost.  We can discern no logical\nbasis for such  a deduction.  The  payment represented Pritzker's\r                                                                           \nacquisition cost   not  Dopp's.  Dopp  did not contribute to  it;\ninstead, he  ceded 80% of the  equity in the  acquiring entity to\nPritzker.   That was Dopp's \"acquisition cost\"    and it is fully\naccounted  for by limiting his  recovery to 12%  of DBHC's actual\nvalue    a  value that  did  not somehow  shrink because  HTP  or\nPritzker tendered the purchase price.  Put another way, the value\nof DBHC remained more  or less the same regardless  of the amount\nexpended for its acquisition.\n\n                                27\r\r\n\nobligated to pay to redeem Dopp's shares.  We conclude that  this\n\namount  should be the face value of  the buy-out option:  $50,000\n\nper share, or in the case  of Dopp's shares, $600,000.  Under the\n\nSSA,  Pritzker could have exercised the buy-out option as late as\n\n10  years after the  formation of  the contract  (withholding any\n\npayment until then).  There is evidence in the record, through an\n\nexpert witness presented  by Pritzker,  that the  prospect of  so\n\nlong a delay would justify a somewhat lower figure, reflective of\n\na  time-related  discount.     The  expert  testified  that  this\n\nreduction to  present value could have brought  the present value\n\nof  the  redemption price  as  of  December 3,  1984,  as  low as\n\n$114,638.\n\n    Thus, the jury could have found that, because of the wrongful\n\nencumbrance, Dopp lost an asset  worth $14,286,600, and, in  lieu\n\nthereof, was left with an asset  worth no more than $114,638.  On\n\nthese  assumptions, a  verdict  for compensatory  damages in  the\n\namount of $14,171,962 is adequately supported by the evidence.\n\n          Beyond  this amount, the  jury's award  is problematic.\n\nWe  are unable  either  to explain  the excess  or  to locate  an\n\nevidentiary  hook on  which it might  be hung.   The  court below\n\ntried justifying the added damages in the following manner:\n\n          In calculating the loss  suffered by Dopp . .\n          .,  the  jury  need  not  have  limited   its\n          consideration  to the actual  value of Dopp's\n          unencumbered shares in HTP  as of the date of\n          the breach  of the  Oral Contract.   The jury\n          was required to determine  Dopp's loss as  of\r                                                          \n          the date  of  the breach;  however,  at  that\n          moment  Dopp's  loss included  the likelihood\n          that   he   would   be   deprived    of   any\n          participation in the future profits generated\n\n                                28\r\r\n\n          by the properties.  The jury could have taken\n          into  account that  a corporation  which owns\n          world-class    resort     properties    could\n          potentially  generate considerable  profits  \n          profits which would be denied to Dopp . . . .\n          Like  any investment,  Dopp's shares  had the\n          potential to  make  money or  to lose  money.\n          And they had this  potential ad infinitum . .\r                                                             \n          . .\n\nDopp III,  831 F.  Supp. at  945.  In  other words,  the district\r                  \n\ncourt visualized the  premium added by  the jury as  representing\n\ncompensation for Dopp's  share of the venture's profits  from the\n\ndate of  the verdict \"back to  December 3, 1984, the  date of the\n\nbreach.\"  Id.\r                       \n\n          In our view, the  district court's reasoning is flawed.\n\nWhile past profit potential may very well have been ascertainable\n\nand quantifiable, there is  no indication in the record  that the\n\njury had before it  specific evidence that would have  allowed it\n\nto engage in this kind of  calculation.  Thus, the inclusion of a\n\npro  rata  share of  past  profits  as  part  of the  verdict  is\r                   \n\nforbidden.   Although  juries generally  enjoy broad  latitude in\n\ndetermining damages,  their authority is not  without all limits.\n\nIn  the case of economic damages, in particular, the jury's award\n\nmust  be rooted in an adequate evidentiary predicate.  See Segal,\r                                                                          \n\n746  F.2d  at 81;  Kolb,  694  F.2d at  872.    Since a  thorough\r                                 \n\ncanvassing of the trial record fails to unearth any such support,\n\nwe  are constrained  to conclude  that the  jury, in  exceeding a\n\n$14,171,962 figure,  could not  have done  so on  the basis of  a\n\nwrongful diversion  of profits except by  an impermissible resort\n\nto speculation and surmise.\n\n                                29\r\r\n\n          This  conclusion is  staunchly reinforced  by the  fact\n\nthat  the  judge's charge  made  no  mention of  Dopp's  putative\n\nparticipation in  past  profits.    To the  contrary,  the  judge\n\ncautioned the  jurors that  even though  \"[y]ou have listened  to\n\nconsiderable evidence  . . . which  bears on the finances  of the\n\nDorado  Beach  Hotel  Corporation  during  the  period  following\n\nPritzker's breach of the oral contract on December 3, 1984  . . .\n\n[f]or  the  purposes  of   assessing  Dopp's  damages,  you  must\n\ndisregard this evidence.\"  It is a bedrock rule that  juries must\n\nact within the parameters of the court's instructions.  See Sparf\r                                                                           \n\n&amp; Hansen v. United States, 156 U.S. 51, 67 (1895).  This rule has\r                                   \n\nparticular pertinence where, as here, the instructions are crisp,\n\nclear, and  cogent.   Thus, the  district court's charge  totally\n\nundermines its later attempt to salvage the verdict.12\n\n          Dopp also  tries to justify  the excess portion  of the\n\nverdict on other grounds.   His most forceful suggestion  is that\n\nthe jury,  in determining full damages,  appropriately could have\n\nconsidered  the value of the management contract for the hotels  \n\nan  asset  worth,  to  Dopp's  way  of  thinking,  an  additional\n\n$35,200,000.    He  argues  that, because  Pritzker  carved  this\n\n                    \r                              \n\n     12There is perhaps another reason for rejecting the district\ncourt's explanation:  the necessity to safeguard against the risk\nof  duplicative recovery.   After all,  the expert  valuations of\nDBHC,  such  as the  Merrill  Lynch  appraisal, already  included\r                                                                           \nfuture  profit  projections.     While  we  understand  that  the\nprojected   profits   included   in  those   valuations   may  be\nqualitatively  distinguishable from the  venture profits of which\nthe  district  court  wrote,  we  also  appreciate  that  a  jury\noverwhelmed  by datum  upon datum  of economic  estimations could\nquite easily have conflated the two species of gains.\n\n                                30\r\r\n\ncontract out of  the deal despite  the fact that  it was part  of\n\nDBHC's inherent value, there is \"ample evidence\" to conclude that\n\n\"the $17 million jury's  valuation of Dopp's full damages  is, if\n\nanything,  too  low by  any  standard.\"    On  close  inspection,\n\nhowever,  Dopp's \"ample  evidence\"  proves no  sturdier than  the\n\nproverbial house of cards.13\n\n          In our  estimation, the  management contract is  wholly\n\nirrelevant  to the  issue  of  full  damages.    As  the  parties\n\nthemselves expressly agreed in  the oral contract, the management\n\ncontract was to be awarded to a Pritzker affiliate, not to either\n\nDopp  or  DBHC.     Hence,  the  management   contract  bears  no\n\nrelationship  whatever to Dopp's damages or to the value of DBHC,\n\nregardless of  whether  it  may have  constituted,  as  Dopp  now\n\nalleges,  \"a  value  inherent   to  [sic]  Dopp's   purchase-sale\n\ncontract.\"  \n\n          We need go no further on the issue of full damages.  We\n\nhold  that the jury's verdict is  untenable to the extent that it\n\nexceeds   $14,171,962.    Accordingly,   we  have  no  principled\n\nalternative  but  to  direct  the  district  court  to  order   a\n\nconditional new trial for the  sole purpose of redetermining full\n\ndamages,  the  condition  being  that  if  Dopp  agrees to  remit\n\n$3,313,400 from the award,  or, put another way, if he  agrees to\n\naccept  a reduction of  the \"full damages\"  award to $14,171,962,\n                    \r                              \n\n     13Dopp also  attempts to justify  the jury verdict  based on\n\"expectations  of profit sharing  and capital appreciation [that]\nwere destroyed  by Pritzker's imposition of  the buy-out clause.\"\nThis  argument  parallels  the  district  court's  rationale, and\nfounders for the reasons previously discussed.\n\n                                31\r\r\n\nthen  the verdict, as  reduced, may stand.   Should Dopp  fail to\n\nconsent to such a remittitur, then the district court shall order\n\na  new trial limited  to the issue  of full  damages.14  Although\n\nthis remittitur  is  not  insubstantial, we  regard  it  as  both\n\nnecessary and appropriate under the circumstances.

The  two rules  operate\r                     \n\ndifferently, however,  in at  least one  salient respect:   while\n\nRule 44.3(b)  provides for determining the  amount of prejudgment\n\ninterest in a mechanical fashion, specifying the period for which\n\ninterest is  to be imposed and the interest rate to be used, Rule\n\n44.1(d)   vests  the   court  with  considerable   discretion  in\n\ndetermining the amount of attorneys' fees to be bestowed.\n\n          A threshold finding of obstinacy brings both rules into\n\nplay.   To be sure,  the rules themselves  use slightly disparate\n\nterminology in describing  the prerequisites to their  operation.\n\nRule  44.1(d)  speaks  of  parties  who  act  \"obstinately\";  the\n\nofficial translation  of Rule 44.3(b)  speaks of parties  who act\n\n\"rashly\";  and the official Spanish  version of Rule 44.3(b) uses\n\nthe  word  \"temeridad\"     a  term  that \"is  more  appropriately\n\ntranslated as `temerity,'\" Dopp III, 831 F.

We\r                                             \n\nregard these  linguistic differences as inconsequential,  for the\n\ncase law makes it transpicuously clear that the legally operative\n\nconduct  under both  rules is  that of  obstinacy.   See  De Leon\r                                                                           \n\nLopez,  931  F.2d  at  126-27  (citing  other  cases);  see  also\r                                                                           \n\nFernandez, 118  D.P.R. 713  (noting that interest  and attorneys'\r                   \n\nfees  will both  be  assessed \"when  the  losing party  has  been\n\nobstinate\").

See  Dopp III,  831 F. Supp.  at 951.   We think it  is\r                                 \n\nevident from this account  that the district court lost  its way.\n\nIn the pages that follow, we set forth our rationale.\n\n          Perhaps most important, there is no sign that the court\n\nfactored into the decisional  calculus the overall nature  of the\n\nlitigation,  or  that it  placed  Pritzker's  conduct within  the\n\n                                37\r\r\n\ncontext of the case  as a whole.  Prosopopoeially  speaking, each\n\ncase, like each individual, has  a personality distinct from that\n\nof all others.   A case's personality is important  in evaluating\n\nclaims  of obstinacy because, just  as obstinacy may  be found to\n\ncharacterize  a party's conduct at one stage of a particular case\n\nbut not  necessarily at another, see Carrillo v. Sameit Westbulk,\r                                                                          \n\n514  F.2d  1214, 1220  (1st Cir.),  cert.  denied, 423  U.S. 1014\r                                                           \n\n(1975),  so may obstinacy  be found to  characterize a particular\n\nform of  conduct in  one case but  not in another.   In  making a\n\ndetermination of obstinacy under P.R.R. Civ. P. 44, therefore, it\n\nis  wise  for  the   trier  to  take  into  account   the  case's\n\npersonality.16   This  course becomes  imperative when  the court\n\nis  confronted  with   a  case  that  has  a  highly  distinctive\n\npersonality.\n\n          This is such a  case.  The district court  described it\n\nas involving \"difficult and protracted legal battles.\"  Dopp III,\r                                                                          \n\n831  F. Supp. at  940.  This  understates the matter.   Here, the\n\nstakes are high, the  issues tangled, the law tenebrous,  and the\n\nlitigants relentless.   The nature of the  performance sought and\n\nthe  multiplicity  of parties  and  interests  contribute to  the\n                    \r                              \n\n     16Our own precedents afford a testament to the importance of\ncorrectly  characterizing the  nature of  the litigation  for the\npurpose of discerning  obstinacy.   In La Playa  Santa Marina,  a\r                                                                       \ndealer  sued  a  manufacturer.    Following  a bench  trial,  the\ndistrict  court found  the manufacturer  liable for  damages, 597\nF.2d at 3-4, and, in addition, awarded attorneys' fees due to the\nmanufacturer's \"obvious  temerity in  the defense of  this suit.\"\nId.  at  7.    We reversed  the  fee  award,  observing  that the\r             \nunderlying dispute was one  characterized by \"close questions and\nsharp conflicts in  the evidence on both liability  and damages.\"\nId.\r             \n\n                                38\r\r\n\ncase's  uniqueness.  In  view of these  realities, we are  of the\n\nopinion that  the trial  court had  an inescapable  obligation to\n\ngauge  the culpability  of  Pritzker's conduct  accordingly.   In\n\nfailing  to  undertake such  an  evaluation,  the district  court\n\nabused its discretion.\n\n          We  believe that  the  court compounded  this error  of\n\nomission by slipping into  various errors of commission.   In the\n\nfirst  place,  the  court  used  too  wide  a  temporal  horizon.\n\nObstinacy  depends  on  a  party's   conduct  in  the  course  of\r                                                                           \n\nlitigation.     See,  e.g.,  De  Leon  Lopez,  931  F.2d  at  126\r                                                      \n\n(indicating that the rules  prohibit obstinacy \"during the course\n\nof  a lawsuit\").  Thus,  the fact that  Pritzker practiced deceit\n\nand  duress during the events  antecedent to the litigation could\n\nnot trigger Rule 44.\n\n          In the second  place, we  do not believe  that, in  the\n\ncircumstances  of this  case,  Pritzker's appeal  from the  first\n\njury's verdict constituted  sanctionable conduct.   The  district\n\ncourt  thought that it was proper to penalize Pritzker for taking\n\nthe appeal  because he \"thereby  caus[ed] significant  additional\n\nexpenditures by the  plaintiff, only  to have the  amount of  the\n\nverdict  against him increased by the second verdict.\"  Dopp III,\r                                                                          \n\n831  F. Supp. at 951.  We  find such a conclusion indefensible in\n\nlight  of the appeals  simultaneously taken  by Dopp  and several\n\nother  parties  from  the  first  jury  verdict;  the  fact  that\n\nPritzker's appeal succeeded  at least  in part,  prompting us  to\n\nerase the original  remedial scheme  and to order  a partial  new\n\n                                39\r\r\n\ntrial;  and,   finally,  the  uncertainty  and   complexity  that\n\nsurrounded the issue of Dopp's entitlement vel non to resolution.\r                                                            \n\n          This last point is especially significant because, as a\n\ngeneral  rule, litigation of a  novel but colorable claim cannot,\n\nby itself, provide  the basis  for a finding  of obstinacy  under\n\nP.R.R.

Though  we  readily\n\nacknowledge  that  Pritzker's  stated  valuation  verges  on  the\n\nludicrous,  there is nothing  to show  that Dopp    who  even now\n\nchallenges a $17,000,000  verdict as too  paltry, see supra  Part\r                                                                     \n\nIII   ever placed a  more reasonable value on the case, or that a\n\nrealistic settlement offer by  Pritzker would have satisfied Dopp\n\nand shortened the proceedings.18\n\n          To  sum up, this case in its present posture epitomizes\n\nthe  potential risk  of  overapplication  associated with  Puerto\n\nRico's  obstinacy  rules.

CONCLUSION\r          V.  CONCLUSION\n\n          This case has taken on a life of its own.   Perhaps its\n\nduration is  directly proportional  to the  imputed value  of the\n\nassets at stake,  but, whether or not  esurience is the  cause of\n\nthe  prolongation, old age inevitably  overtakes cases as well as\n                    \r                              \n\n     18Although  Dopp's apparent  intractability does not  in any\nway justify  Pritzker's seeming intransigence   two wrongs do not\nmake a right    an obstinacy determination  must necessarily take\nthe  whole picture  into account.

He secured the option\n\nwith a $2,000,000  letter of credit supplied  with the assistance\n\nof Island Resorts,  S.A. (IRSA), a  Panamanian corporation.   The\n\noption agreement specified that the  underlying purchase-and-sale\n\ntransaction would be consummated no later than December 3, 1984.\n\n          Though playing for high stakes, Dopp had relatively few\n\nchips of  his own.   Thus, he  immediately set out  in search  of\n\nfinancial backing.  He encountered heavy seas.  With time running\n\nout,  Dopp turned  to  Pritzker.   The  parties reached  an  oral\n\nagreement on November 30, 1984.  Under its terms, Pritzker agreed\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nto  provide the funds needed  to seal the  purchase and reimburse\n\nDopp's  and IRSA's costs.  In exchange, Dopp agreed that Pritzker\n\nwould  receive an 80% equity  interest in a  holding company that\n\nwould be formed  to acquire  DBHC's stock, and,  as a  sweetener,\n\nthat  a Pritzker affiliate would be given a long-term contract to\n\nmanage the hotels coincident with the closing.\n\n          The parties  formed HTP  Corporation (HTP) to  serve as\n\nthe holding company.   Dopp controlled 20% of HTP's  stock in the\n\nfirst  instance, but ceded some shares to IRSA in accordance with\n\na prior arrangement.  In the end, Dopp retained a 12% interest in\n\nHTP.    Meanwhile,  Pritzker,  through a  nominee,  held  an  80%\n\ninterest.2\n\n          On December 3,  1984, Pritzker presented  two documents\n\nto Dopp that supposedly embodied their oral  agreement.  Pritzker\n\ninjected  into one  of these  documents   the  stock subscription\n\nagreement  (SSA)    a  clause granting  the majority  shareholder\n\n(Pritzker) an option to retire the stock held by the two minority\n\nshareholders (Dopp and IRSA) for $50,000 per share, or $1,000,000\n\nin the aggregate, at any time within 10 years.  With the purchase\n\noption due  to expire, the move put  Dopp at a huge disadvantage.\n\nHe signed the documents.\n\n          After HTP obtained a one-day extension from the seller,\n\nit  closed the underlying transaction  on December 4,  1984.  HTP\n\nbought  DBHC's stock  for  $36,846,000, net  of adjustments;  the\n                    \r                              \n\n     2For  ease in  reference,  we ignore  the  nominee, a  shell\ncorporation, and  treat  Pritzker as  if  he, himself,  were  the\nmajority shareholder.\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nseller canceled  the letter  of credit; Pritzker  reimbursed Dopp\n\nand IRSA  for expenses advanced  ($710,000); and Dopp  received a\n\nprearranged $200,000 \"consulting fee.\"\n\n                       B.

The Litigation.\r                                                   \n\n          In  mid-1988, Dopp  initiated a  diversity suit  in the\n\nUnited  States District  Court for  the District of  Puerto Rico,\n\nnaming  Pritzker,  HTP, and  several  others as  defendants.   He\n\nalleged,   inter  alia,  that  the  buy-out  option  in  the  SSA\r                                \n\ncontravened  the oral contract, and  that his consent  to the SSA\n\nhad been unfairly procured.  After  a 10-day trial, a jury  found\n\nin  Dopp's favor, determining that the parties had formed an oral\n\ncontract on November 30, 1984, and that, thereafter, Pritzker had\n\nemployed deceit and duress to pressure Dopp into signing the SSA,\n\nthereby   violating  the   oral   contract.     Based  on   these\n\ndeterminations,  the jury  awarded  Dopp  $2,000,000 in  damages.\n\nThereafter,  the district  court,  acting in  response to  Dopp's\n\nmotion under  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 59(e), declared  the SSA  null and\n\nvoid in  respect to Dopp's shares  in HTP, but  declined to order\n\nresolution of the oral contract.3\n\n          The  first trial  produced no  fewer than  ten appeals.\n\nAfter considering them, we upheld the liability determination but\n\nvacated  both the damage award  and the district court's remedial\n\nrulings, see  Dopp II, 947  F.2d at  520.  We  then remanded  for\r                               \n                    \r                              \n\n     3Resolution  is  a  remedy  that,  under  Puerto  Rico  law,\noperates in much the same way as rescission.

See  Dopp III, 831 F. Supp. at\r                                                          \n\n942 &amp; n.5.  The jury determined that, if  Dopp elected annulment,\n\nthere would be no accessory damages.  See id.\r                                                       \n\n          On September  9, 1993, the district  court made certain\n\nsupplementary  rulings.   Among  other things,  the court  denied\n\nPritzker's motions for judgment as a  matter of law and for a new\n\ntrial;  put a  damper on  Dopp's quest  for  resolution; rejected\n\nDopp's motion to alter  or amend the judgment; upheld  the jury's\n\nassessment of full damages; and awarded Dopp prejudgment interest\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nand attorneys' fees.4  See id. at 943-52.  These appeals ensued.\r                                        \n\nII.  RESOLUTION\r          II.  RESOLUTION\n\n          In our earlier opinion, we determined that up  to three\n\nmain remedies might  be available to  Dopp, namely, annulment  of\n\nthe SSA, resolution of the oral  contract, or full damages.  Dopp\r                                                                           \n\nII, 947 F.2d at 519.   We noted that, in the event  Dopp achieved\r            \n\neither  annulment  or  resolution,  the  jury  might  also  award\n\naccessory damages.   See id.  We defined the  third remedy, \"full\r                                      \n\ndamages,\" as comprising  \"the amount of damages  which would make\n\nDopp whole in the absence of either annulment or resolution . . .\n\n.\"   Id.  Withal, we cautioned that the availability of any given\r                  \n\nremedy  depended  upon  the  existence  (or  nonexistence)  of  a\n\n\"competent evidentiary predicate.\"  Id.\r                                                 \n\n          At the second trial, Judge Pieras instructed the jurors\n\nas  to each  of  these  three  remedies  and  commanded  them  to\n\ndetermine on a contingent  basis the amount of money  damages, if\n\nany, that  each  anodyne  actually  would  entail.    The  jurors\n\ncomplied.  Following the jury's calculation of potential damages,\n\nthe judge asked  Dopp to elect a remedy.   Dopp chose resolution.\n\nMuch  to his  dismay, the  district court  ruled that,  given the\n\nevidence, resolution was unobtainable.   Under protest, Dopp then\n\nelected an alternate remedy:  full damages.   He now beseeches us\n\n                    \r                              \n\n     4The  district court also made a number of rulings in regard\nto third parties  who claimed an interest in the  proceeds of the\nlitigation through prior arrangements  with Dopp.  See  Dopp III,\r                                                                          \n831 F.

He\n          may  also demand  the rescission,  even after\n          having requested its fulfillment,  should the\n          latter appear impossible. . . .\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,   3052 (1991).\n\n          It  is  noteworthy  that   \"[n]ot  every  breach  of  a\n\ncontractual  obligation gives  rise to  a resultory  action under\n\narticle 1077.\"  Dopp II, 947 F.2d at 510-11.  To pave the way for\r                                 \n\nthe  remedy, the  unfulfilled  obligation must  be reciprocal  in\n\nnature.   See id. at  511.   Reciprocity inheres when  \"there are\r                           \n\nobligations and correlative obligations so interdependent between\n\nthemselves  that one  is the  consequence of  the other,  and the\n\nperformance of said obligation by a contracting party constitutes\n\nthe motive of the contract for the other party, and  vice versa.\"\n\nPonce v.

That is, reciprocity\r                        \n\n                                10\r\r\n\nis  basically  a  way  of  saying  that  a  particular obligation\n\nexhibits both  mutuality and essentiality    what one  might term\r                                      \n\n\"mutual essentiality.\"  This concept embodies the notion that, in\n\nthe absence of a particular mutual obligation, the contract would\n\nnever have come into being, and, thus, should cease to exist.\n\n          The Supreme  Court of Puerto Rico  recently fleshed out\n\nthis idea, observing that\n\n          not  every failure  to comply  with a  mutual\n          obligation   will   have   the    effect   of\n          terminating the contract.  For this to be the\n          case,   the  unmet  obligation   must  be  an\n          essential  obligation  or fulfillment  of the\n          obligation  must  constitute the  motive that\n          induced the  other  party to  enter into  the\n          contract.\n\nRamirez v.  Club Cala  de Palmas,      D.P.R.    ,  89 J.T.S.  22\r                                          \n\n(1989)  (revised  official  translation).     Put  bluntly,  \"the\n\nunfulfilled obligation must be the principal one.\"  Id.\r                                                                 \n\n          The  Ramirez court likewise  emphasized the overarching\r                                \n\nconcern of article 1077:   that contracts, if and  when possible,\n\nbe preserved  and ultimately  fulfilled.  See  id.   This is  the\r                                                            \n\n\"higher interest\" served by a narrow construction  of the element\n\nof reciprocity.  Id.  From all that we can discern, then, Article\r                              \n\n1077 is a remedy of last resort, reserved for situations in which\n\na party's breach dissipates the very essence of a contract.\n\n                     B.  Standard of Review.\r                               B.

The Puerto  Rico Supreme  Court has\n\nidentified reciprocity as the key principle on which article 1077\n\n                                11\r\r\n\nrests.   See Vidal,  65 P.R.R. at  351.   And though  reciprocity\r                            \n\nitself  is  wholly  a  legal  construct,  its  existence  in  any\n\nparticular contractual setting  is almost entirely contingent  on\n\nthe determination  of a series of  essentially factual questions,\n\ne.g., the subject matter of the contract, the context in which it\r              \n\narose, the  parties' intentions, their course of conduct, and the\n\nlike.    See id.  (describing reciprocity  as  a function  of the\r                          \n\n\"character\" of a particular obligation).\n\n          Indeed, to the extent that reciprocity actually resides\n\nat   the   intersection  of   mutuality  and   essentiality,  its\n\ncharacterization  as a  mixed question  of law  and fact  becomes\n\nvirtually unavoidable.  Essentiality is closely akin to, if not a\n\nspecies of,  materiality, and  courts and commentators  have long\n\nrecognized that materiality is primarily a question  of fact, the\n\nresolution of  which is  necessarily a  function  of context  and\n\ncircumstances.

Rather, the  unfulfilled\n\nobligation  must  be \"essential\"  to  the  contract, or,  phrased\n\nanother way, the contemplated  fulfillment of the obligation must\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nhave constituted the contract's raison d'etre.

This very\n\nuncertainty is,  in itself,  a good  indicator that  the district\n\ncourt's answer, whether affirmative or negative, is not likely to\n\nbe clearly erroneous.\n\n          In  any event, we discern  no clear error  here.  Judge\n\nPieras,  quoting  Dopp's own  testimony,  determined among  other\n\nthings that \"[p]roviding Dopp  with an unencumbered . .  . equity\r                                                             \n\ninterest  in HTP  is  not a  reciprocal  obligation of  the  Oral\n\nAgreement assumed by the defendant.   Indeed the plaintiff `fully\n\nexpected  that  there  would   be  some  reasonable  option'  and\n\ntherefore did not  rely on  the absence  of an  option clause  to\n\nenter into  the Oral Agreement.\"   Dopp III, 831 F.  Supp. at 950\r                                                     \n\n(emphasis  in  original).   We  believe that  this  assessment of\n\nDopp's  actual expectation is  supportable, and that  it alone is\n\nsufficient  to ground  a principled  conclusion that  the parties\n\nregarded the element of  non-encumbrance as an incidental, rather\n\nthan  an essential, obligation of their  contract.  If it is true\n\nthat  Dopp, prior  and  pursuant to  the  formation of  the  oral\n\ncontract,  \"fully expected  that there  would be  some reasonable\n\noption\"   as  he, himself, testified    and yet proceeded  to the\n\nwritten contract phase without settling this matter precisely, it\n\nseems eminently reasonable  for a factfinder to conclude that the\n\nelement of non-encumbrance could not have been  the raison d'etre\r                                                                           \n\nof the oral contract.\n\n          What is more, the plausibility of this conclusion rests\n\nnot  only on  Dopp's  own words,  but  also on  other  witnesses'\n\n                                18\r\r\n\ntestimony  to the  effect that, when  ownership is  closely held,\n\nbuy-out  options  are  a  regular  attribute  of  intra-corporate\n\narrangements.   For our  part, we regard  this truth  to be self-\n\nevident; indeed, it is difficult to imagine an 80% shareholder of\n\na close  corporation owning  extremely valuable assets  who would\n\nnot  routinely demand  such protection.   Pritzker may  have been\n\nmany things,  but, as Dopp well  knew, he was  neither a neophyte\n\nnor  an altruist.  Hence, Dopp could not reasonably have expected\n\nthat Pritzker  would forgo so  elementary a precaution  and leave\n\nthe minority stock unfettered.\n\n          The  interest in preservation  and ultimate fulfillment\n\nof contracts that drives article 1077, see Ramirez,     P.R. Dec.\r                                                            \n\n  , 89  J.T.S. 22,  does not  suggest a  contrary result.   Here,\n\nPritzker's breach did not  render the contract inherently infirm.\n\nTo  be sure, the breach harmed Dopp, but his insistent focus upon\n\nthe harm begs the real question.  The critical determinant of the\n\navailability  of a resultory remedy  is neither the  fact nor the\n\nmagnitude  of  the inflicted  injury,  but,  rather, whether  the\n\ndefaulting  party's breach irretrievably undermined the contract.\n\nIn  this instance,  the district  court thought  not; and  we can\n\nscarcely  conclude, based  on  the evidence  presented, that  its\n\ndecision was clearly erroneous.\n\n          In a last-ditch effort to  turn the tide, Dopp  insists\n\nthat the  unreasonableness of the particular  buy-out clause that\n\nPritzker   inserted  into  the   SSA  somehow  transmogrifies  an\n\naccessory obligation  into an  essential obligation.   We do  not\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nagree.    If  the  obligation  to  produce  an  unencumbered  12%\n\nownership  interest was not essential  before and at  the time of\n\nthe oral  contract    and,  as  we  have pointed  out,  there  is\n\nadequate evidence to support  a conclusion to that effect    then\n\nit does not matter  that the obligation took on  added importance\n\nas time went by and circumstances changed.\n\n           Dopp's other  arguments on  this issue do  not require\n\ncomment.    For  the reasons  set  forth  herein,  we uphold  the\n\ndistrict court's finding that  the obligation shirked by Pritzker\n\nlacked mutual essentiality.  Accordingly, we affirm the denial of\n\nresolution.\n\nIII.  FULL DAMAGES\r          III.  FULL DAMAGES\n\n          Because  Dopp was  not legally entitled  to resolution,\n\nhis contingent election of an alternative remedy   full damages  \n\nis both valid  and binding.   Withal, both  parties question  the\n\namount of  the damage award.   To  answer these queries,  we must\n\nexamine whether the district  court correctly instructed the jury\n\nas  to the  relevant measure of  damages and, if  so, whether the\n\njury's resultant rendition of full damages passes muster.\n\n               A.

He contends\n\nthat  the verdict on full damages undershot this target because a\n\npinchpenny trial  court charged  the jury  in  too restrictive  a\n\nmanner.   Branding  those  instructions as  contradictory to  the\n\nteachings  of Dopp II and characterizing them as \"poorly thought-\r                               \n\n                                20\r\r\n\nout and convoluted,\" Dopp  asks us to  set aside the verdict  and\n\nmandate further  proceedings.6   We conclude  that the  court did\n\nnot commit reversible error in framing its jury instructions.\n\n          Our analysis begins, as  it must, with the text  of the\n\ndistrict  court's charge.  In  relevant part, the  judge told the\n\njury:\n\n          First  you must  render a  verdict as  to the\n          amount of  the full damages to  which Dopp is\n          entitled  based on  Pritzker's breach  of the\n          oral contract.  . .  .  Full  damages reflect\n          the  amount, if  any,  that  is necessary  to\n          compensate Dopp in the event that he does not\n          elect  to have  the Court  enter an  order of\n          annulment.  They reflect the amount necessary\n          to put Dopp in as good a position as he would\n          have been if the oral contract had been fully\n          performed so  that his shares  were not being\n          encumbered by the SSA's  buy-out clause.  The\n          amount  of full  damages are  [sic] therefore\n          the difference between  the value of what  he\n          was promised  under  November 30,  1984  oral\n          contract  and the value  of what  he actually\n          received from Pritzker  under the December 3,\n          1984 stock subscription agreement.\n\nAs we read these  words, we believe that the court  indicated, in\n\nessence,  that full  damages consisted  of the  monetary  cost of\n\nencumbrance, that is,  the value  of what Dopp  had a  legitimate\n\nright  to expect (a  12% interest in  HTP, not  encumbered in any\n\nunorthodox  way) less the value  of what he  actually received (a\n\n                    \r                              \n\n     6Dopp  also  insists  that   in  addition  to  taking  other\ncorrective action, we should annul the SSA.  He is barking up the\nwrong tree.   If Dopp  desired annulment, he  could have  elected\nthat remedy below.  See Dopp II, 947 F.2d at 519.  He did  not do\r                                         \nso.  See Dopp III, 831 F. Supp. at 942.  Absent such an election,\r                           \nDopp  cannot pursue  annulment on  appeal.

In\n\nparticular,  we find  baffling Dopp's  invocation of  our earlier\n\nopinion.   Nothing contained therein suggests,  by any stretch of\n\nthe  most elastic imagination, that  full damages for purposes of\n\nthis  case  could  constitute  anything  more  than the  cost  of\n\n                    \r                              \n\n     7Dopp properly  preserved  his rights  anent the  challenged\ninstructions, making  a timely objection  as required by  Fed.

This so-called source   article 1255\n\nof the Civil Code   is  simply not supportive of Dopp's position.\n\nAs  its text makes clear,  article 1255 is  relevant only \"[w]hen\n\nthe nullity of  an obligation has been declared.\"  P.R.

That is not the situation here.\n\n          Dopp's  hole   card     his  stated   reliance  on  his\n\n\"intuitive  sense\" of \"injustice\"    does not shore  up his hand.\n\nThe  plea that  it embodies  lies beyond  the cognizance  of this\n\ncourt,  which necessarily deals in the concreteness of fact, law,\n\n                                23\r\r\n\nand logic, not the  fluidity of pathos  and intuition.

Pritzker, for  his  part, is  satisfied  with the\n\ncourt's  instructions but  not with  the amount  of damages.   He\n\nargues that the verdict  is not rationally based on  the evidence\n\npresented and,  hence, that the district court  erred in refusing\n\nto  grant his motion  for a new  trial.  In  stark contrast, Dopp\n\ncontends that the amount  is far too  scant, and that even  \"[i]f\n\nthe  jury did  exactly that  which the  district court  stated it\n\ncould  reasonably  do,\"  its  verdict  should  have been  in  the\n\nvicinity of $39,400,000.\n\n          Dopp's  contention  appears  to   be  no  more  than  a\n\nrecasting  of his  complaints about  the  charge, see  supra Part\r                                                                      \n\nIII(A),  and, at this point, the caterwauling may be rejected out\n\nof  hand.     Pritzker's  contention,   however,  raises  serious\n\nconcerns.\n                    \r                              \n\n     8This ruling reflects not only Dopp's inability to discredit\nthe instructions themselves, but also his failure to substantiate\nhis  own, alternative theory of damages.   At best, it seems that\nhis  theory, which proposes  that full damages  should include at\nleast the value of the  purchase agreement (fixed by the  jury in\nits  special findings  at $40,000,000),  might be viable  if Dopp\nproved  that  he  had the  capacity  to  close  the deal  without\nPritzker's assistance.  But the record  wholly fails to establish\nthat  fact.    Indeed,  Dopp  offered  no  such  proof,  and  all\nindications are that he  lacked the wherewithal to go  forward if\nPritzker withheld his financial backing.\n\n                                24\r\r\n\n          Because  jurors exercise  great  leeway  in  evaluating\n\nclaims and assessing  damages, appeals based on  verdict size are\n\nseldom successful.  When a disgruntled defendant complains that a\n\njury award is overgenerous, the verdict ordinarily stands \"unless\n\nit is  grossly excessive, inordinate, shocking  to the conscience\n\nof the court, or so high that it would be a  denial of justice to\n\npermit it to stand.\"  Segal v.

This  figure  is  based  upon  an\n\nappraisal of the hotel empire conducted by the Merrill Lynch Real\n\nEstate  Advisory &amp;  Appraisal  Group (Merrill  Lynch),10 read  in\n                    \r                              \n\n     9On that  date, Dopp owned  an option to  acquire DBHC.   In\nentering the  oral contract, however,  Dopp in  effect agreed  to\ntrade  that  asset for  a 20%  interest  in DBHC's  properties (a\nportion of which he would then cede to IRSA).  Thus, DBHC becomes\nthe proper barometer for measuring value.\n\n     10While Merrill Lynch issued its appraisal approximately one\nyear after the transaction closed, the district court admitted it\ninto evidence, and we think the jury could reasonably have relied\non it.

In  turn, this value is  the value of\n\nthe  asset   the purchase option    for the acquisition was to be\n\nstructured in  such a  way as  to cost  Dopp nothing  (apart from\n\ncession of an  80% interest  in the acquired  properties).11   On\n\nthis  basis,  then, a  rational  jury,  apportioning the  overall\n\nvalue, could have concluded  that Dopp's anticipated 12% interest\n\nin HTP was worth $14,286,600 on the date of the breach.\n\n          Once the  jurors determined  an asset value,  they next\n\nwould have needed to determine what portion or percentage of that\n\nvalue constituted the cost  of encumbrance.  Taking the  evidence\n\nand  arguments advanced at trial most favorably to Dopp, we think\n\nthat the  jury lawfully  could have determined  that the  buy-out\n\noption eliminated virtually all the  value of Dopp's 12% interest\n\nin  HTP, save  only  for  the  meagre  price  that  Pritzker  was\n                    \r                              \n\n     11Pritzker   argues   that  the   purchase   price  (roughly\n$40,500,000) must be deducted  from the value of DBHC  before the\nvalue of Dopp's pro rata interest is assayed because the purchase\r                                  \nprice constituted an acquisition cost.  We can discern no logical\nbasis for such  a deduction.  The  payment represented Pritzker's\r                                                                           \nacquisition cost   not  Dopp's.  Dopp  did not contribute to  it;\ninstead, he  ceded 80% of the  equity in the  acquiring entity to\nPritzker.   That was Dopp's \"acquisition cost\"    and it is fully\naccounted  for by limiting his  recovery to 12%  of DBHC's actual\nvalue    a  value that  did  not somehow  shrink because  HTP  or\nPritzker tendered the purchase price.  Put another way, the value\nof DBHC remained more  or less the same regardless  of the amount\nexpended for its acquisition.\n\n                                27\r\r\n\nobligated to pay to redeem Dopp's shares.  We conclude that  this\n\namount  should be the face value of  the buy-out option:  $50,000\n\nper share, or in the case  of Dopp's shares, $600,000.  Under the\n\nSSA,  Pritzker could have exercised the buy-out option as late as\n\n10  years after the  formation of  the contract  (withholding any\n\npayment until then).  There is evidence in the record, through an\n\nexpert witness presented  by Pritzker,  that the  prospect of  so\n\nlong a delay would justify a somewhat lower figure, reflective of\n\na  time-related  discount.     The  expert  testified  that  this\n\nreduction to  present value could have brought  the present value\n\nof  the  redemption price  as  of  December 3,  1984,  as  low as\n\n$114,638.\n\n    Thus, the jury could have found that, because of the wrongful\n\nencumbrance, Dopp lost an asset  worth $14,286,600, and, in  lieu\n\nthereof, was left with an asset  worth no more than $114,638.  On\n\nthese  assumptions, a  verdict  for compensatory  damages in  the\n\namount of $14,171,962 is adequately supported by the evidence.\n\n          Beyond  this amount, the  jury's award  is problematic.\n\nWe  are unable  either  to explain  the excess  or  to locate  an\n\nevidentiary  hook on  which it might  be hung.   The  court below\n\ntried justifying the added damages in the following manner:\n\n          In calculating the loss  suffered by Dopp . .\n          .,  the  jury  need  not  have  limited   its\n          consideration  to the actual  value of Dopp's\n          unencumbered shares in HTP  as of the date of\n          the breach  of the  Oral Contract.   The jury\n          was required to determine  Dopp's loss as  of\r                                                          \n          the date  of  the breach;  however,  at  that\n          moment  Dopp's  loss included  the likelihood\n          that   he   would   be   deprived    of   any\n          participation in the future profits generated\n\n                                28\r\r\n\n          by the properties.  The jury could have taken\n          into  account that  a corporation  which owns\n          world-class    resort     properties    could\n          potentially  generate considerable  profits  \n          profits which would be denied to Dopp . . . .\n          Like  any investment,  Dopp's shares  had the\n          potential to  make  money or  to lose  money.\n          And they had this  potential ad infinitum . .\r                                                             \n          . .\n\nDopp III,  831 F.  Supp. at  945.  In  other words,  the district\r                  \n\ncourt visualized the  premium added by  the jury as  representing\n\ncompensation for Dopp's  share of the venture's profits  from the\n\ndate of  the verdict \"back to  December 3, 1984, the  date of the\n\nbreach.\"  Id.\r                       \n\n          In our view, the  district court's reasoning is flawed.\n\nWhile past profit potential may very well have been ascertainable\n\nand quantifiable, there is  no indication in the record  that the\n\njury had before it  specific evidence that would have  allowed it\n\nto engage in this kind of  calculation.  Thus, the inclusion of a\n\npro  rata  share of  past  profits  as  part  of the  verdict  is\r                   \n\nforbidden.   Although  juries generally  enjoy broad  latitude in\n\ndetermining damages,  their authority is not  without all limits.\n\nIn  the case of economic damages, in particular, the jury's award\n\nmust  be rooted in an adequate evidentiary predicate.  See Segal,\r                                                                          \n\n746  F.2d  at 81;  Kolb,  694  F.2d at  872.    Since a  thorough\r                                 \n\ncanvassing of the trial record fails to unearth any such support,\n\nwe  are constrained  to conclude  that the  jury, in  exceeding a\n\n$14,171,962 figure,  could not  have done  so on  the basis of  a\n\nwrongful diversion  of profits except by  an impermissible resort\n\nto speculation and surmise.\n\n                                29\r\r\n\n          This  conclusion is  staunchly reinforced  by the  fact\n\nthat  the  judge's charge  made  no  mention of  Dopp's  putative\n\nparticipation in  past  profits.    To the  contrary,  the  judge\n\ncautioned the  jurors that  even though  \"[y]ou have listened  to\n\nconsiderable evidence  . . . which  bears on the finances  of the\n\nDorado  Beach  Hotel  Corporation  during  the  period  following\n\nPritzker's breach of the oral contract on December 3, 1984  . . .\n\n[f]or  the  purposes  of   assessing  Dopp's  damages,  you  must\n\ndisregard this evidence.\"  It is a bedrock rule that  juries must\n\nact within the parameters of the court's instructions.  See Sparf\r                                                                           \n\n&amp; Hansen v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94082\"><a href=\"/opinion/94082/sparf-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 67 (1895).  This rule has\r                                   \n\nparticular pertinence where, as here, the instructions are crisp,\n\nclear, and  cogent.   Thus, the  district court's charge  totally\n\nundermines its later attempt to salvage the verdict.12\n\n          Dopp also  tries to justify  the excess portion  of the\n\nverdict on other grounds.   His most forceful suggestion  is that\n\nthe jury,  in determining full damages,  appropriately could have\n\nconsidered  the value of the management contract for the hotels  \n\nan  asset  worth,  to  Dopp's  way  of  thinking,  an  additional\n\n$35,200,000.    He  argues  that, because  Pritzker  carved  this\n\n                    \r                              \n\n     12There is perhaps another reason for rejecting the district\ncourt's explanation:  the necessity to safeguard against the risk\nof  duplicative recovery.   After all,  the expert  valuations of\nDBHC,  such  as the  Merrill  Lynch  appraisal, already  included\r                                                                           \nfuture  profit  projections.     While  we  understand  that  the\nprojected   profits   included   in  those   valuations   may  be\nqualitatively  distinguishable from the  venture profits of which\nthe  district  court  wrote,  we  also  appreciate  that  a  jury\noverwhelmed  by datum  upon datum  of economic  estimations could\nquite easily have conflated the two species of gains.\n\n                                30\r\r\n\ncontract out of  the deal despite  the fact that  it was part  of\n\nDBHC's inherent value, there is \"ample evidence\" to conclude that\n\n\"the $17 million jury's  valuation of Dopp's full damages  is, if\n\nanything,  too  low by  any  standard.\"    On  close  inspection,\n\nhowever,  Dopp's \"ample  evidence\"  proves no  sturdier than  the\n\nproverbial house of cards.13\n\n          In our  estimation, the  management contract is  wholly\n\nirrelevant  to the  issue  of  full  damages.    As  the  parties\n\nthemselves expressly agreed in  the oral contract, the management\n\ncontract was to be awarded to a Pritzker affiliate, not to either\n\nDopp  or  DBHC.     Hence,  the  management   contract  bears  no\n\nrelationship  whatever to Dopp's damages or to the value of DBHC,\n\nregardless of  whether  it  may have  constituted,  as  Dopp  now\n\nalleges,  \"a  value  inherent   to  [sic]  Dopp's   purchase-sale\n\ncontract.\"  \n\n          We need go no further on the issue of full damages.  We\n\nhold  that the jury's verdict is  untenable to the extent that it\n\nexceeds   $14,171,962.    Accordingly,   we  have  no  principled\n\nalternative  but  to  direct  the  district  court  to  order   a\n\nconditional new trial for the  sole purpose of redetermining full\n\ndamages,  the  condition  being  that  if  Dopp  agrees to  remit\n\n$3,313,400 from the award,  or, put another way, if he  agrees to\n\naccept  a reduction of  the \"full damages\"  award to $14,171,962,\n                    \r                              \n\n     13Dopp also  attempts to justify  the jury verdict  based on\n\"expectations  of profit sharing  and capital appreciation [that]\nwere destroyed  by Pritzker's imposition of  the buy-out clause.\"\nThis  argument  parallels  the  district  court's  rationale, and\nfounders for the reasons previously discussed.\n\n                                31\r\r\n\nthen  the verdict, as  reduced, may stand.   Should Dopp  fail to\n\nconsent to such a remittitur, then the district court shall order\n\na  new trial limited  to the issue  of full  damages.14  Although\n\nthis remittitur  is  not  insubstantial, we  regard  it  as  both\n\nnecessary and appropriate under the circumstances.

The  two rules  operate\r                     \n\ndifferently, however,  in at  least one  salient respect:   while\n\nRule 44.3(b)  provides for determining the  amount of prejudgment\n\ninterest in a mechanical fashion, specifying the period for which\n\ninterest is  to be imposed and the interest rate to be used, Rule\n\n44.1(d)   vests  the   court  with  considerable   discretion  in\n\ndetermining the amount of attorneys' fees to be bestowed.\n\n          A threshold finding of obstinacy brings both rules into\n\nplay.   To be sure,  the rules themselves  use slightly disparate\n\nterminology in describing  the prerequisites to their  operation.\n\nRule  44.1(d)  speaks  of  parties  who  act  \"obstinately\";  the\n\nofficial translation  of Rule 44.3(b)  speaks of parties  who act\n\n\"rashly\";  and the official Spanish  version of Rule 44.3(b) uses\n\nthe  word  \"temeridad\"     a  term  that \"is  more  appropriately\n\ntranslated as `temerity,'\" Dopp III, 831 F.

See  De Leon\r                                                                           \n\nLopez,  931  F.2d  at  126-27  (citing  other  cases);  see  also\r                                                                           \n\nFernandez, 118  D.P.R. 713  (noting that interest  and attorneys'\r                   \n\nfees  will both  be  assessed \"when  the  losing party  has  been\n\nobstinate\").

This is as it must be,  especially in light\n\nof the vastly different  relationships between the district court\n\nand the events of an actual trial, on the one hand, and the court\n\nof appeals and those same events, on the other hand.  This is not\n\nto imply, however, that an  appellate tribunal may merely rubber-\n\nstamp a district  judge's discretionary  determinations.   Though\n\nabuse of discretion  is a relatively relaxed  standard of review,\n\nit  is  a standard  nonetheless, and  the  court of  appeals will\n\ninterject itself if the trial court does not meet its measure.\n\n                          C.

See  Dopp III,  831 F. Supp.  at 951.   We think it  is\r                                 \n\nevident from this account  that the district court lost  its way.\n\nIn the pages that follow, we set forth our rationale.\n\n          Perhaps most important, there is no sign that the court\n\nfactored into the decisional  calculus the overall nature  of the\n\nlitigation,  or  that it  placed  Pritzker's  conduct within  the\n\n                                37\r\r\n\ncontext of the case  as a whole.  Prosopopoeially  speaking, each\n\ncase, like each individual, has  a personality distinct from that\n\nof all others.   A case's personality is important  in evaluating\n\nclaims  of obstinacy because, just  as obstinacy may  be found to\n\ncharacterize  a party's conduct at one stage of a particular case\n\nbut not  necessarily at another, see Carrillo v. Sameit Westbulk,\r                                                                          \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"327104\"><a href=\"/opinion/327104/carmen-carrillo-vda-de-cerich-v-sameit-westbulk-and-johan-hagenes-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">1214</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1220  (1st Cir.),  cert.  denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1014</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\r                                                           \n\n(1975),  so may obstinacy  be found to  characterize a particular\n\nform of  conduct in  one case but  not in another.   In  making a\n\ndetermination of obstinacy under P.R.R. Civ. P. 44, therefore, it\n\nis  wise  for  the   trier  to  take  into  account   the  case's\n\npersonality.16   This  course becomes  imperative when  the court\n\nis  confronted  with   a  case  that  has  a  highly  distinctive\n\npersonality.\n\n          This is such a  case.  The district court  described it\n\nas involving \"difficult and protracted legal battles.\"  Dopp III,\r                                                                          \n\n831  F. Supp. at  940.  This  understates the matter.   Here, the\n\nstakes are high, the  issues tangled, the law tenebrous,  and the\n\nlitigants relentless.   The nature of the  performance sought and\n\nthe  multiplicity  of parties  and  interests  contribute to  the\n                    \r                              \n\n     16Our own precedents afford a testament to the importance of\ncorrectly  characterizing the  nature of  the litigation  for the\npurpose of discerning  obstinacy.   In La Playa  Santa Marina,  a\r                                                                       \ndealer  sued  a  manufacturer.    Following  a bench  trial,  the\ndistrict  court found  the manufacturer  liable for  damages, 597\nF.2d at 3-4, and, in addition, awarded attorneys' fees due to the\nmanufacturer's \"obvious  temerity in  the defense of  this suit.\"\nId.  at  7.    We reversed  the  fee  award,  observing  that the\r             \nunderlying dispute was one  characterized by \"close questions and\nsharp conflicts in  the evidence on both liability  and damages.\"\nId.\r             \n\n                                38\r\r\n\ncase's  uniqueness.  In  view of these  realities, we are  of the\n\nopinion that  the trial  court had  an inescapable  obligation to\n\ngauge  the culpability  of  Pritzker's conduct  accordingly.   In\n\nfailing  to  undertake such  an  evaluation,  the district  court\n\nabused its discretion.\n\n          We  believe that  the  court compounded  this error  of\n\nomission by slipping into  various errors of commission.   In the\n\nfirst  place,  the  court  used  too  wide  a  temporal  horizon.\n\nObstinacy  depends  on  a  party's   conduct  in  the  course  of\r                                                                           \n\nlitigation.     See,  e.g.,  De  Leon  Lopez,  931  F.2d  at  126\r                                                      \n\n(indicating that the rules  prohibit obstinacy \"during the course\n\nof  a lawsuit\").  Thus,  the fact that  Pritzker practiced deceit\n\nand  duress during the events  antecedent to the litigation could\n\nnot trigger Rule 44.\n\n          In the second  place, we  do not believe  that, in  the\n\ncircumstances  of this  case,  Pritzker's appeal  from the  first\n\njury's verdict constituted  sanctionable conduct.   The  district\n\ncourt  thought that it was proper to penalize Pritzker for taking\n\nthe appeal  because he \"thereby  caus[ed] significant  additional\n\nexpenditures by the  plaintiff, only  to have the  amount of  the\n\nverdict  against him increased by the second verdict.\"  Dopp III,\r                                                                          \n\n831  F. Supp. at 951.  We  find such a conclusion indefensible in\n\nlight  of the appeals  simultaneously taken  by Dopp  and several\n\nother  parties  from  the  first  jury  verdict;  the  fact  that\n\nPritzker's appeal succeeded  at least  in part,  prompting us  to\n\nerase the original  remedial scheme  and to order  a partial  new\n\n                                39\r\r\n\ntrial;  and,   finally,  the  uncertainty  and   complexity  that\n\nsurrounded the issue of Dopp's entitlement vel non to resolution.\r                                                            \n\n          This last point is especially significant because, as a\n\ngeneral  rule, litigation of a  novel but colorable claim cannot,\n\nby itself, provide  the basis  for a finding  of obstinacy  under\n\nP.R.R. Civ.  P. 44.   See, e.g., Riofrio  Anda v.
