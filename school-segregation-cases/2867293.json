Plaintiff appeals.\n\n\n\n                                       I.\n\n     The district court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n§1331.    Plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal, and we have\n\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1291.\n\n    1Plaintiff also named Attorney General Janet Reno as a\ndefendant and alleged two state law negligence claims against all\ndefendants. On appeal, he mentions the dismissal of neither the\nstate law claims nor the federal claims as to Attorney General\nReno, and hence we need not reach these issues. We note in any\nevent that (a) the district court held that tort claims against\nfederal employees may arise only under the Federal Tort Claims\nAct, 28 U.S.C. §1346; and (b) to be liable for a constitutional\nviolation a defendant must have some causal connection to the\nwrongdoing.   Mark v. Borough of Hatboro, ___ F.3d ___, 1995 WL\n138433, at *18 and n.13 (3d Cir. 1995); Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S.\n362, 377 (1976).    Plaintiff has offered no evidence that the\nAttorney General in any way caused, consented to, or tacitly\napproved the conduct of the prison officials herein.\n\f         Plaintiff   Polyns     Bieregu      is    incarcerated    at    the   federal\n\nprison in Fairton, New Jersey.                     He alleges that on numerous\n\noccasions and outside his presence, prison mailroom employees\n\nopened and read mail addressed to him from federal judges, in\n\nviolation of the Constitution, federal regulations, and internal\n\nBureau of Prisons (\"BOP\") guidelines.\n\n         The federal regulatory framework for handling prisoner mail\n\nis straightforward.           The regulations distinguish between incoming\n\n\"general mail,\" which the Warden must open and inspect and may\n\nread, and incoming \"special mail,\" which the Warden may open\n\n\"only in the presence of the inmate for inspection for physical\n\ncontraband and the qualification of any enclosures as special\n\nmail.\"      28 C.F.R. §§540.14(a), 540.18(a).2             Special mail includes\n\nincoming mail from federal and state courts.                       §540.2(c).       In\n\norder to receive the special handling, incoming special mail must\n\nbe marked \"Special Mail - Open only in the presence of the\n\ninmate\"     and    have   a    clearly       identified    sender.       §§540.2(c),\n\n540.18(a).        According to a BOP Policy Statement, however, mail\n\n\"from the chambers of a federal judge . . . should be given\n\nspecial     handling,\"        even    when    it   lacks   the    precise      marking.\n\nFederal Bureau of Prisons, Program Statement No. 5265.08 (October\n\n1,   1985),       §13(a).            For   convenience,     we    will      refer   to\n\ncorrespondence between an inmate and attorney as \"attorney mail\"\n\nand to correspondence between an inmate and a state or federal\n\n\n     2\n     Unless otherwise noted, all subsequent references to federal\nregulations are to 28 C.F.R.\n\fjudge, clerk's office, or other courthouse address as \"court\n\nmail.\"      We   use     the     phrase    \"legal     mail\"    as    a     general      term\n\nincluding both attorney and court mail.\n\n     Plaintiff       does       not   attack   the     general      BOP     scheme      for\n\nhandling mail, nor the specific authority of BOP employees to\n\nopen incoming legal mail in his presence.                        Rather, plaintiff\n\ncontends    that    in    repeatedly        opening    court     mail      outside      his\n\npresence,     the      mailroom         employees     violated       his       rights     to\n\n\"confidential and uncensored commications\" [sic] and to \"access\n\nto the court\" under the First, Fourth, Sixth, and Fourteenth\n\nAmendments.      As approved in Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of\n\nFederal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), plaintiff sues\n\ndirectly under the Constitution.\n\n     In    response      to     defendants'    motion    for     summary        judgment,\n\nplaintiff supplied evidence that five pieces of mail from federal\n\njudges were opened outside his presence within a three month\n\nperiod.     The mail concerned civil proceedings to which plaintiff\n\nwas a party.       Plaintiff alleges further that on another occasion,\n\nthe mailroom employees opened and damaged a scheduling order in a\n\ncivil forfeiture proceeding.                Bieregu claims that because the\n\norder was damaged, he failed to file a timely brief and his\n\nappeal was dismissed.\n\n     An internal review by the prison determined that on at least\n\nthree of the five alleged occasions, mailroom employees did open\n\nplaintiff's properly marked legal mail outside his presence.                             The\n\nemployees    claim       they     did    not   read    the    mail       and    submitted\n\naffidavits denying they had opened it intentionally.\n\f       The     district      court       concluded       \"we   cannot      say     that    a\n\nreasonable         trier   of     fact    would    be    compelled      to     find     that\n\ndefendants' actions were the result of mere negligence.\"                           Bieregu\n\nv. Reno, No. 94-2775, slip op. (D.N.J. Nov. 4, 1994), at 5.                                It\n\nwent    on    to    conclude      that    \"a    policy    or    practice     of    opening\n\nproperly      identified        legal    mail     outside      the   presence      of     the\n\ninmate\" is a constitutional violation.                    Id. at 9.      Nevertheless,\n\nthe court determined that because the law in this circuit is not\n\nclearly established as to whether such conduct rises to the level\n\nof a constitutional violation, the officials were entitled to\n\nqualified immunity.\n\n       Our review of a district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nis plenary.         In re City of Philadelphia Litigation, ___ F.3d ___,\n\n1995 WL 88161, *15 (3d Cir. 1995).                 We consider whether there are\n\ngenuine issues as to material facts and whether defendants are\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.                             Id.; Fed.R.Civ.P.\n\n56(c).       See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986);\n\nWisniewski v. Johns-Manville Corp., 812 F.2d 81, 83 (3d Cir.\n\n1987).       In so determining, we will resolve all reasonable doubts\n\nand draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving\n\nparty.       Meyer v. Riegel Products Corp., 720 F.2d 303, 307, n.2\n(3d Cir. 1983), cert. dismissed, 465 U.S. 1091 (1984).\n\n\n\n                                            II.\n\n       By definition a sentence of imprisonment involves a loss of\n\none's    liberty,      and   by    necessity      a     substantial     loss      of   one's\n\nprivacy.       Yet confinement does not result in the forfeiture of\n\fall constitutional rights.            Indeed, the closing of the prison\n\ngates upon an inmate is punishment enough in most instances, and\n\nany attempt to isolate inmates completely from the outside world\n\nmight not only violate their constitutional rights, but would\n\ndisserve the interests of a society hoping to release prisoners\n\nto   become    law-abiding     citizens.    Thus     the      Supreme   Court has\n\nreminded us that \"[p]rison walls do not form a barrier separating\n\nprison inmates from the protections of the Constitution.\"                  Turner\n\nv. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 84 (1987).              See also Wolff v. McDonnell,\n\n418 U.S. 539, 555-56 (1974) (\"There is no iron curtain drawn\n\nbetween the Constitution and the prisons of this country\").                     Nor\n\ndo   those    walls    \"bar   free   citizens    from    exercising     their   own\n\nconstitutional rights by reaching out to those on the 'inside.'\"\n\nThornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401, 407 (1989).\n\n      Accordingly, the Supreme Court has recognized that persons\n\nconvicted of serious crimes and confined to penal institutions\n\nretain the right to petition the government for the redress of\n\ngrievances, Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483 (1969); the right to\n\nbe free from racial segregation, Lee v. Washington, 390 U.S. 333\n\n(1968); the right to due process, Wolff, supra; the right of free\nspeech, Abbott, 490 U.S. at 410, n.9; the right of meaningful\n\naccess to the courts, Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 828 (1977);\n\nand the right to exercise substantial religious freedom, Cruz v.\n\nBeto, 405 U.S. 319 (1972); O'Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U.S.\n\n342, 348 (1987).\n\n      The Court has also recognized, however, that the rights of\n\nprisoners      \"must     be    exercised    with        due    regard    for    the\n\f'inordinately    difficult    undertaking'       that   is   modern   prison\n\nadministration.\"      Abbott, 490 U.S. at 407 (quoting Turner, 482\n\nU.S. at 85).    Prison officials must weigh the need for internal\n\norder and security against the rights of prisoners, as well as\n\nthe constitutional rights afforded \"those on the 'outside' who\n\nseek to enter that environment, in person or through the written\n\nword.\"   Abbott, 490 U.S. at 407.\n\n     Courts have been called upon to review the balance struck by\n\nprison officials between the penal institution's need to maintain\n\nsecurity within its walls and the rights of prisoners and non-\n\nprisoners.     As former Chief Judge Higginbotham has written for\n\nour court, \"'courts have learned from repeated investigation and\n\nbitter experience that judicial intervention is indispensable if\n\nconstitutional dictates--not to mention considerations of basic\n\nhumanity--are    to   be   observed   in   the   prisons.'\"    Peterkin   v.\n\nJeffes, 855 F.2d 1021, 1033 (3d Cir. 1988) (quoting Rhodes v.\n\nChapman, 452 U.S. 337, 354 (1981) (Brennan, J. concurring)).\n\n     Against this background we turn to the conduct of defendants\n\nregarding plaintiff's incoming court mail.\n\n\n\n                                  III.\n\n     The district court granted summary judgment on the grounds\n\nthat defendants enjoyed qualified immunity, but before reaching\n\nthis issue we must first determine whether plaintiff has alleged\n\na constitutional violation.      In re City of Philadelphia, ___ F.3d\nat ___, 1995 WL 88161, at *15; Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226,\n231 (1991).     This analysis involves two steps: determining (1)\n\fwhether any of plaintiff's constitutional rights are infringed by\n\nthe     conduct    alleged      herein;      and     if    so,     (2)    whether        that\n\ninfringement rises to the level of a constitutional violation,\n\ngiven    the    specialized        standard    of     review      applied       to    prison\n\nregulations and practices.\n\n      A number of courts of appeals have determined that opening\n\nproperly       marked     incoming     attorney       or    court       mail    outside     a\n\nprisoner's        presence,     or     reading      such        mail,    infringes        the\n\nConstitution.           Though finding a constitutional violation, the\n\nSeventh, Eighth, and Eleventh Circuits identified no right in\n\nparticular.        See Castillo v. Cook County Mail Room Department,\n\n990 F.2d 304, 307 (7th Cir. 1993) (per curiam) (allegation that\n\nprison    officials       opened     three    pieces       of    incoming      court     mail\n\noutside        inmate's      presence        states        \"colorable          claim\"     of\n\nconstitutional violation); Lemon v. Dugger, 931 F.2d 1465, 1468\n\n(11th     Cir.      1991)      (prison        official          violated        prisoner's\n\n\"constitutional right not to have his mail read\" where one piece\n\nof incoming attorney mail opened and read in inmate's presence);\n\nJensen    v.    Klecker,      648    F.2d    1179,     1182-83      (8th       Cir.     1981)\n\n(allegations        that      prison     officials         had      deliberately          and\n\nrepeatedly opened incoming and outgoing attorney mail outside\n\nprisoner's presence sufficient to defeat officials' motion for\n\nsummary judgment).          The Sixth and Tenth Circuits looked to the\n\nFirst Amendment.           See Lavado v. Keohane, 992 F.2d 601, 609-10\n(6th Cir. 1993) (\"opening/reading\" incoming court mail outside\n\nprisoner's presence in arbitrary or capricious fashion violates\n\nFirst Amendment); Ramos v. Lamm, 639 F.2d 559, 582 (10th Cir.\n\f1980) (opening outgoing court and attorney mail outside presence\n\nof inmate violates the First Amendment), cert. denied, 450 U.S.\n\n1041   (1981).       The   Second      Circuit   also    relied    on    the   First\n\nAmendment,    but    on    the    Petition     Clause    in    particular.      See\n\nWashington    v.     James,      782    F.2d   1134,    1139    (2d     Cir.   1986)\n\n(allegation      that   prison     officials     repeatedly     opened     outgoing\n\nattorney mail states claim for violation of rights to petition\n\nand to correspond with legal counsel).                 The Fifth Circuit relied\n\non a constitutional right of access to the courts, arising under\n\nthe Due Process Clause.            See Taylor v. Sterrett, 532 F.2d 462,\n\n475 (5th Cir. 1976) (prisoner's right of access \"requir[es] that\n\nincoming prisoner mail from courts . . . be opened only in the\n\npresence of the inmate\").          Taylor, however, may no longer be good\n\nlaw in the Fifth Circuit.              See Brewer v. Wilkinson, 3 F.3d 816,\n\n825 (5th Cir. 1993) (opening incoming attorney or court mail\n\noutside inmate's presence does not violate prisoner's rights to\n\nfree speech or court access), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 114\n\nS.Ct. 1081 (1994); Walker v. Navarro County Jail, 4 F.3d 410, 413\n\n(5th Cir. 1993).        Lastly, in the Ninth Circuit, Judge Reinhardt\n\nhas argued in dissent that the right to privacy was at stake.\n\nStevenson    v.     Koskey,      877   F.2d    1435,    1443   (9th     Cir.   1989)\n\n(Reinhardt, J., dissenting) (\"reading legal mail is a violation\n\nof the prisoner's privacy rights\").\n\n       Similarly, district courts in our circuit, like the one\n\nherein, have concluded that to read legal mail or to open it\n\noutside a prisoner's presence violates the Constitution, though\n\nthey too have not agreed as to the constitutional rights at\n\fissue.      See Jordan v. Fauver, ___ F.Supp. ___, 1995 WL 139274, at\n\n*4-5 (reading legal mail in presence of inmate violates his right\n\nto   court       access)   (D.N.J.   1995);    Proudfoot     v.    Williams,     803\n\nF.Supp. 1048, 1052 (E.D.Pa. 1992) (opening and scanning outgoing\n\nattorney and court mail in presence of prisoner violates inmate's\n\nrights      to    petition,   counsel,   and    court     access);    Thornley   v.\n\nEdwards, 671 F.Supp. 339, 342 (M.D.Pa. 1987) (opening incoming\n\ncourt mail outside presence of inmate violates his rights to\n\ncounsel and court access), mot. denied, summ. judg. granted, 1988\n\nWL 188333 (M.D.Pa. 1988); Carty v. Fenton, 440 F.Supp. 1161,\n\n1162-63      (M.D.Pa.      1977)   (opening    incoming    court     mail   outside\n\ninmate's presence violates his right to court access).\n\n       Only once have we confronted the question of whether opening\n\nand reading an inmate's legal mail violates the Constitution.\n\nSee Allen v. Aytch, 535 F.2d 817 (3d Cir. 1976).                       We did not\n\nreach the issue, however, relying instead on Justice Brandeis's\n\nconcurrence in Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 297 U.S.\n\n288 (1936) to remand for consideration of a non-constitutional\n\nargument not raised in the district court.                  Allen, 535 F.2d at\n\n823.\n       A.        Freedom of speech\n\n       As Justice Holmes recognized years ago, \"[t]he United States\n\nmay give up the Post Office when it sees fit, but while it\n\ncarries it on the use of the mails is almost as much a part of\n\nfree speech as the right to use our tongues.\"                  United States ex\nrel. Milwaukee Social Democratic Publishing Co. v. Burleson, 255\n\nU.S. 407, 437 (1921) (Holmes, J., dissenting).                 Thus the Supreme\n\fCourt    has        generally    treated      interference           with    the     mail    as\n\nimplicating the First Amendment right to free speech.                              See Bolger\n\nv. Youngs Drug Prods. Corp., 463 U.S. 60, 69 & n.18 (1983);\n\nBlount v. Rizzi, 400 U.S. 410, 416 (1971); Lamont v. Postmaster\n\nGeneral, 381 U.S. 301, 307-08 (1965).\n\n       In Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396 (1974), the Supreme\n\nCourt invalidated California prison regulations which provided\n\nfor     the    routine     censorship         of       inmates'      outgoing        personal\n\ncorrespondence, on the grounds that the regulations violated the\n\nfree speech rights of the prisoners' correspondents.                              416 U.S. at\n\n408 (\"[w]hatever the status of a prisoner's claim to uncensored\n\ncorrespondence with an outsider, it is plain that the latter's\n\ninterest       is    grounded     in   the    First      Amendment's         guarantee       of\n\nfreedom of speech\").            See also Wolff, 418 U.S. at 576-77.\n\n       In the years after Procunier and Wolff, however, the Court\n\nabandoned      the     distinction      between        the    free    speech       rights    of\n\ninmates and their correspondents on the outside.                                 Abbott, 490\n\nU.S. at 411, n.9 (\"any attempt to forge separate standards for\n\ncases implicating the [First Amendment] rights of outsiders [and\n\ninmates] is out of step with the intervening decisions\").\n\n       Clearly,        then,    prisoners         do    not    forfeit           their    First\n\nAmendment      rights     to    use    of   the    mails.         For   example,         prison\n\nofficials violate a prisoner's First Amendment rights when they\n\nrefuse to deliver incoming personal mail simply because it is\n\nwritten in a language other than English.                            Ramos, 639 F.2d at\n581.     Similarly, officials violate the First Amendment when they\n\nrefuse    to    deliver        mail    that   allegedly        could        be    emotionally\n\fdisturbing     to   an     inmate,    in    the    absence       of     a       psychiatric\n\ndetermination that the mail would indeed be upsetting.                                 Id. at\n\n581-82.\n\n        The Fifth Circuit has concluded that \"[t]he precise contours\n\nof a prisoner's right to free speech are . . . obscure,\"                              Brewer,\n\n3 F.3d at 821.       However, we need not determine the exact outer\n\nlimits of a prisoner's right to free speech, for we are satisfied\n\nthat a pattern and practice of opening properly marked incoming\n\ncourt mail outside an inmate's presence infringes communication\n\nprotected by the right to free speech.                    Such a practice chills\n\nprotected expression and may inhibit the inmate's ability to\n\nspeak,    protest,       and    complain    openly,       directly,         and       without\n\nreservation with the court.\n\n     Here,      plaintiff's       complaint       alleged        that           on    fifteen\n\noccasions defendants opened his legal mail outside his presence.\n\nIn response to this motion, he supplied evidence documenting five\n\ninstances in which his incoming court mail was opened in a three\n\nmonth    period.     Defendants       admit      that    on   three         of       the   five\n\noccasions documented by plaintiff, they did open his incoming\n\ncourt mail outside his presence.                Because we must view the facts\n\nin the light most favorable to plaintiff, the non-moving party,\n\nand draw all reasonable inferences therefrom, we conclude that\n\nthere    is   sufficient       evidence    in   the     record   for        a    reasonable\n\nperson to infer that there exists a pattern and practice of\n\nopening plaintiff's incoming court mail outside his presence.\n\n     Plaintiff also alleges that defendants censored his mail.\n\nIn the context of the First Amendment and prison mail, however,\n\fcensorship     means   altering     or     \"withhold[ing]     delivery         of    a\n\nparticular letter.\"         Procunier, 416 at 417.       See Wolff, 418 U.S.\n\nat 576 (\"freedom from censorship is not equivalent to freedom\n\nfrom inspection or perusal\").             But see Taylor, 532 F.2d at 469\n\n(opening prisoner's mail is \"indirect censorship\").                      Plaintiff\n\npoints to only one occasion in which his mail was damaged, namely\n\nwhen the briefing schedule was cut.              We decline to hold that a\n\nsingle     instance    of    damaged      mail   rises   to      the     level      of\n\nconstitutionally       impermissible       censorship,      and        hence     this\n\nallegation cannot withstand the motion for summary judgment.\n    B.      Right to meaningful court access\n\n     The     Supreme    Court     has     held   that    \"prisoners        have      a\n\nconstitutional right of access to the courts.\"                Bounds, 430 U.S.\n\nat 821.    See also Johnson, 393 at 489; Wolff, 418 U.S. at 577-80.\n\nThe Court explained that the access must be \"adequate, effective,\n\nand meaningful\" to comport with the Constitution.                      Bounds, 430\n\nU.S. at 822.      Yet, as the Fifth Circuit has observed, \"[p]erhaps\n\nbecause their textual footing in the Constitution is not clear,\n\nthese principles [of court access] suffer for lack of internal\n\ndefinition and prove far easier to state than to apply.\"                       Morrow\nv. Harwell, 768 F.2d 619, 623 (5th Cir. 1985).\n     1. Source of the right\n\n     The Bounds decision made only one reference to a particular\n\nconstitutional     source,    describing     the   prisoners'      complaint         as\n\nalleging a violation of their \"Fourteenth Amendment rights.\"                        430\n\nU.S. at 818.      Since that decision, courts have concluded that the\n\nright    arises    under    the   First    Amendment     right    to     petition,\n\fProudfoot, 803 F.Supp. at 1052; Jackson v. Procunier, 789 F.2d\n\n307, 310 (5th Cir. 1986); Nordgren v. Milliken, 762 F.2d 851, 853\n\n(10th Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1032 (1985); Milhouse v.\n\nCarlson, 652 F.2d 371, 373 (3d Cir. 1981); Washington, 782 F.2d\n\nat 1139; the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, Proudfoot, 803\n\nF.Supp. at 1052; Thornley, 671 F.Supp. at 342; Stover v. Carlson,\n\n413 F.Supp. 718, 722 (D.Conn. 1976); and the Due Process Clause.\n\nJackson, 789 F.2d at 310; Nordgren, 762 F.2d at 853.              Adding more\n\nspice to the soup, the Supreme Court has referred to the \"equal\n\nprotection guarantee of 'meaningful access.'\"                Pennsylvania v.\n\nFinley, 481 U.S. 551, 557 (1987).            There is also a theory that\n\nmeaningful court access is protected under the Privileges and\n\nImmunities Clause.      See Nordgren, 762 F.2d at 853.                We have\n\npreviously noted the various theories, without making our own\n\nselection.     See Peterkin, 855 F.2d at 1036, n.18.\n      a. Right to petition\n\n      The First Amendment's right to petition \"has a pedigree\n\nindependent of--and substantially more ancient than--the freedoms\n\nof speech and press.\"        San Filippo v. Bongiovanni, 30 F.3d 424,\n\n443 (3d Cir. 1994), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 115 S.Ct. 735\n(1995).   In colonial times, it referred primarily to the power of\n\nthe   people    to   petition   their   legislatures.            In   fact,    a\n\nsignificant    amount   of   colonial   legislation        was   initiated     by\n\ncitizen   petition.     Akhil   R.   Amar,    The   Bill    of   Rights   as   a\n\nConstitution, 100 Yale L.J. 1131, 1156 (1991).              See also Note, A\n\fShort History of the Right to Petition Government for the Redress\n\nof Grievances, 96 Yale L.J. 142 (1986).3\n\n           In the modern era, the Supreme Court has held that the\n\nPetition Clause encompasses a right of access not only to the\n\nlegislative branch, but to the courts as well.             California Motor\n\nTransport Co. v Trucking, Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 510 (1972);\n\nBill Johnson's Restaurants Inc. v. NLRB, 461 U.S. 731, 741 (1983)\n\n(\"the right of access to the courts is an aspect of the First\n\nAmendment right to petition\").           Thus in San Filippo we treated\n\nthe filing of a lawsuit as implicating the Petition Clause.               30\n\nF.3d at 440, n.18.         In its most recent examination of the clause,\n\nthe Supreme Court appeared to treat the right to petition as\n\nsubsumed within the broad First Amendment right to freedom of\n\nexpression.        McDonald v. Smith, 472 U.S. 479, 482 (1985) (right\n\nto petition is merely \"an assurance of a particular freedom of\n\nexpression\").         In    San   Filippo,   in   the   context   of   public\n\nemployment, we nevertheless distinguished between a petition and\n\nmere speech to hold that \"filing a non-sham petition is not a\n\nconstitutionally permissible ground for discharge.\"               30 F.3d at\n\n443.        We conclude that the First Amendment right to petition, as\n\n\n\n       3\n     At the founding, the Petition Clause also implied a\n\"congressional duty to respond.\" Amar, Bill of Rights, 100 Yale\nL.J. at 1156.   In the Civil War era, however, Congress enacted\nrules abolishing the duty to respond, a change later sanctioned\nby the Supreme Court.    Note, A Short History, 96 Yale L.J. at\n164; Smith v. Arkansas State Highway Employees, 441 U.S. 463, 465\n(1979) (per curiam) (constitution does not require government \"to\nlisten [or] to respond\" to citizen petition); Minnesota State Bd.\nfor Community Colleges v. Knight, 465 U.S. 271, 285 (1984).\n\fcurrently interpreted, is a birthplace for the right of court\n\naccess.\n          b. Right to counsel\n\n          The plain language of the Sixth Amendment is limited to\n\ncriminal proceedings,4 and thus, for example, the Supreme Court\n\nhas   determined        that   the    Amendment's   guarantee    of    a    right   to\n\ncounsel does not extend to habeas corpus proceedings, which are\n\ncivil.       Finley, 481 U.S. at 555.            Moreover, in Wolff, the most\n\nrecent Supreme Court examination of the status of a prisoner's\n\nlegal mail, the Court held that \"[a]s to the Sixth Amendment, its\n\nreach is only to protect the attorney-client relationship from\n\nintrusion in the criminal setting.\"                 418 U.S. at 576 (emphasis\n\nadded).       See also Taylor, 532 F.2d at 472.              Accordingly, as to\n\ncivil actions, we conclude that the Sixth Amendment is not a\n\npromising place for genealogical research on the right of court\n\naccess.\n\n          Here, plaintiff characterizes the five pieces of opened mail\n\nas regarding \"a civil rights action\" against prison officials.\n\nPl.Br. at 2.            Two of the letters were apparently related to\n\nBieregu      v.    Reno,   No.     93-4894   (D.N.J.),   a   civil    action.       In\n\naddition,         the   briefing     schedule   allegedly    opened   and    damaged\n\n\n      4\n     \"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the\nright to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the\nState and district wherein the crime shall have been committed,\nwhich district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and\nto be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be\nconfronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory\nprocess for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the\nAssistance of Counsel for his defence.\" U.S.Const., Am. VI.\n\fconcerned a civil forfeiture case.                Certainly plaintiff offered\n\nno   evidence    in    response     to    the    motion      for    summary   judgment\n\nindicating that the opened mail involved a criminal proceeding.\n\nThus    we    will    explore     plaintiff's      Sixth       Amendment      claim   no\n\nfurther.\n       c. Due process\n\n       As noted, the Bounds decision characterized the plaintiffs'\n\nallegations of a denial of court access as arising under the\n\nFourteenth Amendment.           430 U.S. at 818.            In Procunier, the Court\n\nheld that California's mail censorship regulations violated the\n\n\"constitutional guarantee of due process of law [which] has as a\n\ncorollary the requirement that prisoners be afforded access to\n\nthe courts in order to challenge unlawful convictions and to seek\n\nredress for violations of their constitutional rights.\"                       416 U.S.\n\nat   419.      See    also   Ex   parte   Hull,       312    U.S.   546,   549   (1941)\n\n(invalidating prison official's refusal to mail inmate's habeas\n\ncorpus      petition); Wolff,      418    U.S.    at    576    (referring      to   \"due\n\nprocess claim based on access to the courts\").                         Thus there is\n\nample authority to conclude that among the progeny of the Due\n\nProcess Clause is the right of court access.\n\n       We    note     that    defendants        are     federal       officials,      so\n\nplaintiff's reliance on the Fourteenth Amendment is misplaced; if\n\ngrounded in the Due Process Clause, his right of access arises\n\nunder the Fifth Amendment.          We will construe the pro se complaint\nliberally, however, Todaro v. Bowman, 872 F.2d 43, 44 n.1 (3d\n\nCir.   1989),    and    conclude     that    it   alleges       that   the    repeated\n\fopening   of   properly   marked   incoming   court    mail   outside   his\n\npresence has violated his Fifth Amendment right to court access.\n       2. Scope of the right\n\n       The Supreme Court's characterization of the right to court\n\naccess as requiring \"adequate, effective, and meaningful\" access,\n\nBounds, 430 U.S. at 822, provides only limited guidance as to the\n\nscope of the right's protection.       We have noted that \"the Court\n\ndid not define the term 'adequate' with specificity,\"              Abdul-\n\nAkbar v. Watson, 4 F.3d 195, 202 (3d Cir. 1993); unfortunately,\n\n\"[o]ur own application of Bounds has contributed only slightly to\n\na more precise standard of 'adequacy.'\"        Id.    See also Brewer, 3\n\nF.3d at 821 (\"the precise contours of a prisoner's right of\n\naccess to the courts remain somewhat obscure\").\n\n       Although our decisions have primarily concerned the adequacy\n\nand accessibility of prison law libraries and legal staff, see\n\nPeterkin, supra; Valentine v. Beyer, 850 F.2d 951 (3d Cir. 1988);\n\nAbdul-Akbar, supra, a few principles emerge.          Prison measures are\n\nto be evaluated individually and in sum.        Abdul-Akbar, 4 F.3d at\n\n203.    A court must determine whether the means of access \"give\n\nprisoners a reasonably adequate opportunity to present claimed\n\nviolations of fundamental constitutional rights to the courts.\"\n\nBounds, 430 U.S. at 825.       \"'[T]he touchstone . . . is meaningful\n\naccess to the courts.'\"        Peterkin, 855 F.2d at 1037 (quoting\n\nBounds, 430 U.S. at 823) (internal quotation omitted).\n\n       Relying principally on our decision in Hudson v. Robinson,\n\n678 F.2d 462 (3d Cir. 1982), the government contends that unless\n\na prisoner is \"actually denied\" access to the courts, his right\n\fto meaningful access has not been violated.                           Hudson, 678 F.2d at\n\n466.    See also Proudfoot, 803 F.Supp. at 1053, n.8; Walker, 4\n\nF.3d   at   413    (opening      incoming           legal      mail   outside    prisoner's\n\npresence    does    not     violate         right    to       court   access    unless    \"his\n\nposition as a litigant was prejudiced by the mail tampering\");\n\nBrewer, 3 F.3d at 825.\n\n       This analysis ignores our later decision in Peterkin.                             There\n\nwe distinguished \"ancillary\" aspects of court access, which \"may\n\naffect merely comfort or convenience without depriving a prisoner\n\nof access,\" 855 F.2d at 1041, from prison practices that are\n\n\"central, not peripheral, to the right of access to the courts.\"\n\nId.    The former require a showing of actual injury but the latter\n\ndo not.     Id. at 1041-42.\n\n       In   Peterkin      we    characterized             as    \"ancillary\"      an    action\n\nseeking     to    require      the    prison        to    supply      gratis   pads,     pens,\n\npencils, postage, and photocopying to prisoners who had funds in\n\ntheir institutional accounts sufficient to purchase the items.\n\nSee    Peterkin,     855       F.2d    at     1041-42          (discussing     Kershner       v.\n\nMuzurkiewicz, 670 F.2d 440 (3d Cir. 1982) (in banc)).                                 We also\n\ndescribed    as     ancillary         the    issue       in    Hudson   itself,       where   a\n\nprisoner sued because he was once required to wait ten days to\n\nhave a document notarized.                  Peterkin, 855 F.2d at 1039, 1041-42\n\n(discussing Hudson,            supra).         By    contrast,        the   adequacy     of    a\n\nprison law library concerned issues central to the right of court\n\naccess.     Id.\n\n       Plaintiff does allege he was injured by the damage to his\n\nbriefing schedule, but he offers no evidence to establish that\n\fthe    damage       obscured         the    dates,    nor    to    dispute       defendants'\n\ncontention that he received a separate notice from the clerk's\n\noffice pursuant to Third Circuit LAR Misc. 107.2(a), informing\n\nhim that he had fourteen days to file a brief else the appeal\n\nwould     be    dismissed.             We     conclude      that       plaintiff    has     not\n\ndemonstrated that he has suffered an actual injury regarding\n\ncourt access.\n\n       Nonetheless, and although the question is close, we conclude\n\nthat repeated violations of the confidentiality of a prisoner's\n\nincoming court mail is more central than ancillary to the right\n\nof    court     access,        and    thus     no    showing      of    actual     injury    is\n\nnecessary for plaintiff to establish that the right has been\n\ninfringed.          We are satisfied that a practice of opening court\n\nmail outside an inmate's presence implicates a core aspect of the\n\nright.     Such conduct inhibits an inmate's ability to protect his\n\nlegal rights in court and frustrates the principles of Bounds.\n\nUnlike    free      pens     or      slight    delays       in    notarizing       documents,\n\ninterference with such mail threatens the primary, often sole\n\nmeans by which a prisoner can exercise his constitutional rights.\n\nWithout    assurances          that        legal    correspondence,         including      both\n\nattorney and court mail, is confidential and secure, court access\n\ncan hardly be effective, adequate, and meaningful.\n\n       In so holding, we distinguish between a single, inadvertent\n\ninstance       of   an   inmate's          court    mail   being       opened    outside his\n\npresence,       and      a     pattern        and     practice         of   such    conduct.\n\nNotwithstanding          our    characterization           that    protection       of    court\n\nmail is central to an inmate's right of court access, and thus no\n\factual injury need be shown in the face of a pattern and practice\n\nof opening such mail outside of the inmate's presence, we do not\n\nnecessarily rule out the need to show such injury where the\n\nopening is isolated and inadvertent.                  See Castillo, 990 F.2d at\n\n306-07 (allegations that three pieces of incoming court mail were\n\nopened outside inmate's presence states colorable constitutional\n\nclaim); Washington, 782 F.2d at 1139 (distinguishing allegation\n\nthat    two   pieces     of   legal   mail     were    opened   outside      inmate's\n\npresence,      which     would      indicate     \"continuing       activity\"     and\n\ntherefore      constitutional         violation,       from     \"single      isolated\n\ninstance,\" which would not).              Cf. Morgan v. Montanye, 516 F.2d\n\n1367,    1370-72   (2d     Cir. 1975)      (single      instance   of   legal    mail\n\nopened outside presence of inmate does not violate Constitution),\n\ncert. denied, 424 U.S. 973 (1976); Boyd v. Petsock, 795 F.Supp.\n\n743 (W.D.Pa. 1992) (same).\n\n       We need not specify a minimum number of instances in which\n\nproperly      marked    legal      mail   is   opened    outside    a     prisoner's\n\npresence      sufficient      to   eliminate    the     requirement     of   showing\n\nactual injury.         Determining whether a prisoner has demonstrated a\n\ncustom or practice is a fact-bound inquiry.\n\n       Lastly, we note several distinctions that may clarify our\n\ndiscussion of the right of court access as applied to prison\n\nlegal mail.      First, reading legal mail would appear to infringe\n\nthe right of access even more than simply opening and inspecting\n\nit.     Second, as the Supreme Court noted, the only way to ensure\n\nthat mail is not read when opened, and thus to vindicate the\n\nright to access, is to require that it be done in the presence of\n\fthe inmate to whom it is addressed.                 Wolff, 418 U.S. at 576-77.\n\nThird, interference with attorney mail probably infringes the\n\nright of court access even more than interference with court\n\nmail,         whether    the    correspondence       relates       to   a    criminal\n\nconviction, a subsequent collateral proceeding, or a civil suit\n\nto   protect        an    inmate's       constitutional       rights.        Of     all\n\ncommunications, attorney mail is the most sacrosanct.                             Thus,\n\nalthough the Sixth Amendment is not recognized as the repository\n\nfor such a shield in civil matters, see Finley, supra, the right\n\nof   court       access    guarantees      the     privacy    of    attorney-client\n\ncommunications.           See John W. Palmer, Constitutional Rights of\n\nPrisoners, 4th ed., at 40 (Anderson Publishing Co. 1991) (\"A\n\nbasic corollary to the right of access to the courts is the\n\ninmate's right to communicate with an attorney concerning the\n\nvalidity of his conviction or the constitutionality of conditions\n\nwithin the detention facility\").\n\n         We    conclude    that    a     pattern    and   practice      of    opening\n\nplaintiff's        properly     marked    incoming    court    mail     outside     his\n\npresence impinges upon his constitutional rights to free speech\n\nand court access.5             This determination does not depend on the\n     5\n     We add a note about the right to privacy, because plaintiff\nrelies on the Fourteenth Amendment and the district court cited\nthe decision in which Judge Reinhardt, in dissent, stated\n\"reading legal mail is a violation of the prisoner's privacy\nrights.\"   Stevenson, 877 F.2d at 1443.    The Supreme Court has\nrecognized that the right to privacy survives incarceration.\nTurner, 482 U.S. at 95-99. See also Monmouth County Correctional\nInst. Inmates v. Lanzaro, 834 F.2d 326, 334 (3d Cir. 1987), cert.\ndenied, 486 U.S. 1006 (1988).    Although authorized by §540.18,\nroutine reading of purely personal letters from friends and\nfamily, those daily expressions of affection and love, may\nimplicate an inmate's right to privacy.       Certainly personal\n\fmere        violation   by     prison    officials        of   §540.18      and     Policy\n\nStatement          §13(a),   which      by    itself      does      not    establish    a\n\nconstitutional violation.               Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327,\n\n332-33 (1986); Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183, 193-94 (1984).\n\n\n\n                                             IV.\n\n           We turn next to the question whether a pattern and practice\n\nof     opening      plaintiff's       properly      marked     incoming     court    mail\n\noutside his presence, which infringes his rights to free speech\n\nand        court   access,     rises    to    the    level     of   a     constitutional\n\nviolation.\n\n           In several decisions the Supreme Court has struggled to\n\ndefine       the    standard    for     review      of   prison     regulations      which\n\nimpinge upon the constitutional rights of inmates.                           Though the\n\nCourt announced a fairly searching standard in Procunier,6 its\n\nlater decisions in Turner and Abbott held that as to prison mail,\n\ninformation in the hands of prison officials may result in\nridicule, harassment, and retaliation. If prisoners are stripped\nof the right to communicate privately their love, their hopes,\nand   even  their   grievances,  then   recidivism  rather   than\nrehabilitation is fostered.      Similarly, opening legal mail\noutside the presence of an inmate, giving rise to the reasonable\ninference that such mail is read, may also implicate the right to\nprivacy. We do not reach this issue, however, as plaintiff has\nnot placed it before us.\n       6\n     In Procunier, the Court held that a prisoner's mail is\nprotected \"against unjustified governmental interference.\"    416\nU.S. at 408-09.    To justify interference, the government must\nshow an \"important or substantial governmental interest unrelated\nto the suppression of expression,\" id. at 413, and that the\nsuppression was \"no greater than is necessary or essential to the\nprotection of the particular governmental interest involved.\"\nId.\n\fthe    Procunier        standard   is   \"limited     to    regulations         concerning\n\noutgoing correspondence.\"               Abbott, 490 U.S. at 413 (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n       In Turner, the Court applied a less rigorous standard for\n\nreview of incoming mail, a standard which it applied in Abbott as\n\nwell.     The Court in Turner held that \"when a prison regulation\n\nimpinges on inmates' constitutional rights, the regulation is\n\nvalid    if   it    is     reasonably    related     to    legitimate         penological\n\ninterests.\"        Turner, 482 U.S. at 89.           See also Shabazz, 482 U.S.\n\nat 349-50 (applying Turner reasonableness standard to regulations\n\nthat restrict free exercise of inmate's religion).                             The Court\n\nthen      identified         several      factors         useful       in      evaluating\n\nreasonableness.           Id. at 89-91.    See also Abbott, 490 U.S. at 414-\n\n18; Sturm v. Clark, 835 F.2d 1009, 1013-14 (3d                        Cir. 1987).     The\n\nAbbott    Court         acknowledged    that   the    Turner       standard      is   more\n\ndeferential        to    prison    officials   than       that   of    Procunier,      but\n\nembraced the new test with the caveat that \"a reasonableness\n\nstandard is not toothless.\"              Abbott, 490 U.S. at 414.               See also\n\nTurner, 482 U.S. at 97 (ban on inmate marriage not reasonably\n\nrelated to legitimate penological interests).\n\n       Though the case before us concerns an alleged pattern and\n\npractice of official conduct, rather than a prison regulation,\n\napplication of the Turner standard is appropriate.                          See Brewer, 3\n\nF.3d at 825-26 (applying Turner standard to prison practice, not\n\nregulation).            We also note that the government does not argue\n\nthat the conduct alleged by plaintiff comports with Turner.\n\f      The first Turner factor asks whether there is a rational\n\nconnection between the infringing prison practice and a valid\n\ngovernment interest.        To justify interference with prisoner mail,\n\nofficials typically invoke their interests in rehabilitation of\n\ninmates and institutional security.             See, e.g., Abbott, 490 U.S.\n\nat 415; Shabazz, 482 U.S. at 348.               First, in the absence of a\n\ndetermination by, for example, a prison psychiatrist that receipt\n\nof particular correspondence would disturb an inmate, we hesitate\n\nto conclude that the government interest in rehabilitation is\n\nserved     by   opening     incoming    court    mail   outside    an   inmate's\n\npresence.       See Ramos, 639 F.2d at 581-81.          Second, the interest\n\nin institutional security is generally linked to mail on the\n\nsupposition that correspondence may contain plans for escape or\n\nincite violence.       We recognize the validity of this substantial\n\ninterest, but to argue that it is served on the facts of this\n\ncase--to    suggest    that    repeatedly   opening     incoming    court   mail\n\noutside the presence of an inmate advances a legitimate interest\n\nin institutional security--would overreach.\n\n      In addition, we note that prison officials themselves have\n\nlong recognized that providing a confidential, reliable means for\n\nprisoners to communicate their grievances to impartial courts and\n\ngovernment officials, and to obtain a fair resolution of those\n\ngrievances, releases tension in the prisons and itself advances\n\nthe   state      interest     in   maintaining    institutional     order    and\n\nsecurity.       See generally Ira P. Robbins, The Prisoners' Mail Box\nand the Evolution of Federal Inmate Rights, 144 F.R.D. 127 (1993)\n\n(\"Prisoners' Mail Box\").           In 1929, for example, Superintendent of\n\fPrisons (and later first Director of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons)\n\nSanford Bates wrote to the warden of the federal jail at Fort\n\nLeavenworth:\n     It seems to me important that the inmates in your\n     institution should have some reasonable and dignified method\n     of making known any real or fancied grievance that they\n     might have.   An institution is a good deal like a steam\n     boiler, and needs a safety valve occasionally.\n\n\nPrisoners' Mail Box, 144 F.R.D. at 143.               An understanding of the\n\nbenefits of such a \"safety-valve\" persuaded prison officials that\n\npreserving     the   confidentiality      of   communications         with courts,\n\nagencies,     and    legislators      advanced,      rather    than    frustrated,\n\nimportant penological interests.           Id. at 148-49, 153-54.7\n\n         Consideration of the second Turner factor, the availability\n\nof   alternate      means   of    exercising   the    rights    at    issue,   also\n\nindicates that defendants' practice is not reasonably related to\n\na legitimate interest.           Although other means of expression remain\n\navailable to prisoners even when prison officials interfere with\n\ntheir general mail, Abbott, 490 U.S. at 417-18, we are not aware\n\nof means other than by way of uninhibited use of the mail for pro\n\nse prisoners to exercise their rights of court access.\n\n         Finally, the third Turner factor concerns the burdens of\n\naccommodating the exercise of prisoners' constitutional rights.\n\nTo accommodate plaintiff's rights to free speech and court access\n     7\n     Interestingly, though prison officials initially censored\ninmate correspondence to federal judges to ensure that the\ncontent was decent, respectful, and non-libelous, when federal\njudges and even the Clerk of the U.S. Supreme Court expressed a\npreference for receiving prisoner mail unopened and unexpurgated,\nthe Bureau of Prisons changed its procedures.     Prisoners' Mail\nBox, 144 F.R.D. at 155, 159-60.\n\fby opening his incoming court mail only in his presence places no\n\nburden at all on guards, prisoners, and the allocation of prison\n\nresources: it is what the regulations have required since 1985.\n\nSee 28 C.F.R. §540.18 (1994).\n\n      We hold that the pattern and practice of opening plaintiff's\n\nproperly marked incoming court mail outside his presence fails\n\nthe Turner reasonableness standard and violates the Constitution.\n\nWe acknowledge that our conclusion differs from that of the Fifth\n\nCircuit, see Brewer, 3 F.3d at 825, but note that it comports\n\nwith the results reached by the majority of courts of appeals to\n\nconsider these precise or similar issues, not to mention the\n\nresults reached by our own district courts.       See Lavado, 992 F.2d\n\nat 609-10; Castillo, 990 F.2d at 307; Lemon, 931 F.2d at 1468;\n\nWashington, 782 F.2d at 1139; Jensen, 648 F.2d at 1182-83; Ramos,\n\n639 F.2d at 582; Jordan, ___ F.Supp. at ___, 1995 WL 139274, at\n\n*4-5; Proudfoot, 803 F.Supp. at 1052; Carty, 440 F.Supp. at 1162-\n\n63.\n\n      As noted above, we are careful to distinguish between a\n\nsingle, inadvertent opening of properly marked legal mail outside\n\nan inmate's presence and a pattern or practice of such actions.\n\nThe former may not infringe a prisoner's right to free speech,\n\nnor his right to court access absent a showing of actual injury.\n\nThe   latter,   however,   both   infringes   those   rights   and   fails\n\nTurner.\n\n\n                                   V.\n\f     Even      where   a    plaintiff      can    establish          a    constitutional\n\nviolation, under the doctrine of qualified immunity government\n\nofficials will not be liable if \"their conduct does not violate\n\nclearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a\n\nreasonable person would have known.\"                   Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457\n\nU.S. 800, 818 (1982).             For a right to be clearly established,\n\n\"[t]he contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a\n\nreasonable      official    would       understand      that    what          he   is   doing\n\nviolates that right.\"            Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640\n\n(1987).       In contrast, if \"the law is not established clearly when\n\nan official acts, he is entitled to qualified immunity because he\n\n'could not reasonably be expected to anticipate subsequent legal\n\ndevelopments.'\"        In re City of Philadelphia, ___ F.3d at ___,\n\n1995 WL 88161, at * 16 (quoting Harlow, 457 U.S. at 817-19).\n\nThough    here    again    the     question      is    close,    we       conclude      that\n\ndefendants are not entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n     There can be no dispute that the contours of plaintiff's\n\nrights under §540.18 and §13(a) of the Policy Statement were\n\nsufficiently       clear    that    a    reasonable         prison       official       would\n\nunderstand      that   repeatedly       opening       plaintiff's         incoming      court\n\nmail outside his presence violates those regulations.                              Although\n\npromulgation      of   a   regulation      will       not    constitutionalize           its\n\nviolation, §540.18 and the Policy Statement surely undermine any\n\nclaim    by    defendants    that       they   were     unaware          of   their     legal\n\nobligations in handling plaintiff's mail.                    Thus the government's\n\nargument is reduced to the contention that while the illegality\n\fof their behavior was manifest, the constitutional magnitude of\n\ntheir actions was murky.\n\n      We disagree.          First, in Procunier and Wolff the Supreme\n\nCourt made clear that the treatment of a prisoner's legal mail\n\nimplicates constitutional rights to free speech and court access.\n\nThe subsequent decisions in Turner and Abbott did not question\n\nthat interference with prison mail infringed these constitutional\n\nrights;     the    latter     decisions      merely     established          that   such\n\ninfringement       was      constitutionally        permissible         if     it    was\n\nreasonably related to a legitimate penological purpose.                             Here,\n\ndefendants    do    not     even   argue    that    their   conduct      meets      this\n\nstandard.\n\n      Second,      though    numerous       other     courts     of   appeals       have\n\nconsidered conduct akin to that alleged by plaintiff, no gaping\n\ndivide has emerged in the jurisprudence such that defendants\n\ncould reasonably expect this circuit to rule other than we do.\n\nSee Lavado, 992 F.2d at 609-10; Castillo, 990 F.2d at 307; Lemon,\n\n931 F.2d at 1465; Washington, 782 F.2d at 1139; Ramos, 639 F.2d\n\nat 582; Jensen, 648 F.2d at 1182-83.                Only the Fifth Circuit has\n\nreached a contrary decision.               Brewer, 3 F.3d at 825; Walker, 4\nF.3d at 413.\n\n      The Seventh Circuit's decision in Castillo is particularly\n\ninstructive.       There, a prisoner alleged that three letters from a\n\nfederal courthouse were opened outside his presence.                            Because\n\nthree instances \"may be indicative of ongoing activity,\" 990 F.2d\n\nat   306,   the    Seventh    Circuit      determined     that    the    inmate      had\n\n\"presented a colorable claim\" of a constitutional violation and\n\freversed the district court's dismissal of the action.                            Id. at\n\n307.\n\n        The Sixth Circuit's decision in Lavado is also relevant.\n\nThere, the court denied summary judgment to defendant prison\n\nofficials on the basis of qualified immunity where one letter\n\nfrom the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit was allegedly\n\nopened outside an inmate's presence and a second letter, from a\n\nstate    law   department,       was    allegedly        opened    and    read   in     his\n\npresence.      Lavado, 992 F.2d at 609-10.                 The Sixth Circuit held\n\nthat     \"it   was      clearly       established         at   the       time    of     the\n\nopenings/reading in the instant case that prisoners' mail could\n\nnot be opened or read in [an] arbitrary or capricious fashion.\"\n\nId. at 610.\n\n       Third, the district courts in our circuit who have addressed\n\nthe issue have consistently determined that repeatedly opening a\n\nprisoner's      legal     mail        outside      his    presence       violates       the\n\nConstitution.     See Jordan, ___ F.Supp. at ___, 1995 WL 139374, at\n\n*5; Proudfoot, 803 F.Supp. at 1052; Carty, 440 F.Supp. at 1162-\n\n63.      See   also   Young      v.    Keohane,     809    F.Supp.       1185,   1197-98\n\n(M.D.Pa. 1992) (denying qualified immunity to prison officials\n\nwho allegedly intercepted mail addressed to judges and court\n\npersonnel).\n\n        Finally, the absence of a previous decision from our court\n\non     the   constitutionality          of   the    conduct       at     issue   is     not\n\ndispositive.      We have explained that the \"clearly established\"\n\nstandard \"require[s] 'some but not precise factual correspondence\n\nbetween relevant precedents and the conduct at issue.'\"                               In re\n\fCity of Philadelphia, ___ F.3d at ___, 1995 WL 88161 at *25\n\n(citation omitted).          We think the facts of Castillo, Lavado,\n\nProudfoot, and Carty enjoy a substantial \"factual correspondence\"\n\nto the circumstances here.\n\n     Thus, we conclude that though our court has not previously\n\nruled on this precise issue, the contours of defendants' legal\n\nobligations     under    the     regulations      and   Constitution      were\n\nsufficiently    clear   that     a   reasonable     prison    official    would\n\nunderstand that repeatedly opening plaintiff's properly marked\n\nincoming    court     mail     outside     his    presence     violates     the\n\nConstitution.       Accordingly, we will reverse the district court\n\norder   granting    defendants    qualified      immunity    from   plaintiff's\n\nclaims.\n\n                                     VI.\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm in part, see note\n\n1, supra, and reverse in part the order of the district court\n\ngranting summary judgment to all defendants on all claims.\n\fBieregu v. Reno, No. 94-5719\n\n\n\n\nSCIRICA, Circuit Judge, concurring.\n\n\n\n\n            I agree that Bieregu has alleged a constitutional\n\nviolation of his right to court access, and that the law was\n\nsufficiently established to preclude a finding of qualified\n\nimmunity.   But I have doubts that Bieregu's free speech rights\n\nare implicated here.\n\n            First Amendment free speech rights are implicated when\n\nprison officials censor inmates' mail.    Procunier v. Martinez,\n\n416 U.S. 396, 409 (1974), overruled on other grounds, Thornburgh\n\nv. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401 (1989).    But \"freedom from censorship is\n\nnot equivalent to freedom from inspection or perusal.\"    Wolff v.\n\nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 576 (1974).     Because it is far from\n\nclear that defendants censored Bieregu's court mail, I would base\n\nthis holding on his constitutional right to court access.\n\n                 Also, because Bieregu has not claimed his right to\n\nprivacy was infringed, it is unnecessary to address this issue.\n\f\f",

Plaintiff appeals.\n\n\n\n                                       I.\n\n     The district court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n§1331.    Plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal, and we have\n\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1291.\n\n    1Plaintiff also named Attorney General Janet Reno as a\ndefendant and alleged two state law negligence claims against all\ndefendants. On appeal, he mentions the dismissal of neither the\nstate law claims nor the federal claims as to Attorney General\nReno, and hence we need not reach these issues. We note in any\nevent that (a) the district court held that tort claims against\nfederal employees may arise only under the Federal Tort Claims\nAct, 28 U.S.C. §1346; and (b) to be liable for a constitutional\nviolation a defendant must have some causal connection to the\nwrongdoing.

Plaintiff has offered no evidence that the\nAttorney General in any way caused, consented to, or tacitly\napproved the conduct of the prison officials herein.\n\f         Plaintiff   Polyns     Bieregu      is    incarcerated    at    the   federal\n\nprison in Fairton, New Jersey.                     He alleges that on numerous\n\noccasions and outside his presence, prison mailroom employees\n\nopened and read mail addressed to him from federal judges, in\n\nviolation of the Constitution, federal regulations, and internal\n\nBureau of Prisons (\"BOP\") guidelines.\n\n         The federal regulatory framework for handling prisoner mail\n\nis straightforward.           The regulations distinguish between incoming\n\n\"general mail,\" which the Warden must open and inspect and may\n\nread, and incoming \"special mail,\" which the Warden may open\n\n\"only in the presence of the inmate for inspection for physical\n\ncontraband and the qualification of any enclosures as special\n\nmail.\"      28 C.F.R. §§540.14(a), 540.18(a).2             Special mail includes\n\nincoming mail from federal and state courts.                       §540.2(c).       In\n\norder to receive the special handling, incoming special mail must\n\nbe marked \"Special Mail - Open only in the presence of the\n\ninmate\"     and    have   a    clearly       identified    sender.       §§540.2(c),\n\n540.18(a).        According to a BOP Policy Statement, however, mail\n\n\"from the chambers of a federal judge . . . should be given\n\nspecial     handling,\"        even    when    it   lacks   the    precise      marking.\n\nFederal Bureau of Prisons, Program Statement No. 5265.08 (October\n\n1,   1985),       §13(a).            For   convenience,     we    will      refer   to\n\ncorrespondence between an inmate and attorney as \"attorney mail\"\n\nand to correspondence between an inmate and a state or federal\n\n\n     2\n     Unless otherwise noted, all subsequent references to federal\nregulations are to 28 C.F.R.\n\fjudge, clerk's office, or other courthouse address as \"court\n\nmail.\"      We   use     the     phrase    \"legal     mail\"    as    a     general      term\n\nincluding both attorney and court mail.\n\n     Plaintiff       does       not   attack   the     general      BOP     scheme      for\n\nhandling mail, nor the specific authority of BOP employees to\n\nopen incoming legal mail in his presence.                        Rather, plaintiff\n\ncontends    that    in    repeatedly        opening    court     mail      outside      his\n\npresence,     the      mailroom         employees     violated       his       rights     to\n\n\"confidential and uncensored commications\" [sic] and to \"access\n\nto the court\" under the First, Fourth, Sixth, and Fourteenth\n\nAmendments.

The mail concerned civil proceedings to which plaintiff\n\nwas a party.       Plaintiff alleges further that on another occasion,\n\nthe mailroom employees opened and damaged a scheduling order in a\n\ncivil forfeiture proceeding.                Bieregu claims that because the\n\norder was damaged, he failed to file a timely brief and his\n\nappeal was dismissed.\n\n     An internal review by the prison determined that on at least\n\nthree of the five alleged occasions, mailroom employees did open\n\nplaintiff's properly marked legal mail outside his presence.

See also Wolff, 418 U.S. at 576-77.\n\n       In the years after Procunier and Wolff, however, the Court\n\nabandoned      the     distinction      between        the    free    speech       rights    of\n\ninmates and their correspondents on the outside.                                 Abbott, 490\n\nU.S. at 411, n.9 (\"any attempt to forge separate standards for\n\ncases implicating the [First Amendment] rights of outsiders [and\n\ninmates] is out of step with the intervening decisions\").\n\n       Clearly,        then,    prisoners         do    not    forfeit           their    First\n\nAmendment      rights     to    use    of   the    mails.         For   example,         prison\n\nofficials violate a prisoner's First Amendment rights when they\n\nrefuse to deliver incoming personal mail simply because it is\n\nwritten in a language other than English.                            Ramos, 639 F.2d at\n581.     Similarly, officials violate the First Amendment when they\n\nrefuse    to    deliver        mail    that   allegedly        could        be    emotionally\n\fdisturbing     to   an     inmate,    in    the    absence       of     a       psychiatric\n\ndetermination that the mail would indeed be upsetting.                                 Id. at\n\n581-82.\n\n        The Fifth Circuit has concluded that \"[t]he precise contours\n\nof a prisoner's right to free speech are . . . obscure,\"                              Brewer,\n\n3 F.3d at 821.       However, we need not determine the exact outer\n\nlimits of a prisoner's right to free speech, for we are satisfied\n\nthat a pattern and practice of opening properly marked incoming\n\ncourt mail outside an inmate's presence infringes communication\n\nprotected by the right to free speech.                    Such a practice chills\n\nprotected expression and may inhibit the inmate's ability to\n\nspeak,    protest,       and    complain    openly,       directly,         and       without\n\nreservation with the court.\n\n     Here,      plaintiff's       complaint       alleged        that           on    fifteen\n\noccasions defendants opened his legal mail outside his presence.\n\nIn response to this motion, he supplied evidence documenting five\n\ninstances in which his incoming court mail was opened in a three\n\nmonth    period.     Defendants       admit      that    on   three         of       the   five\n\noccasions documented by plaintiff, they did open his incoming\n\ncourt mail outside his presence.                Because we must view the facts\n\nin the light most favorable to plaintiff, the non-moving party,\n\nand draw all reasonable inferences therefrom, we conclude that\n\nthere    is   sufficient       evidence    in   the     record   for        a    reasonable\n\nperson to infer that there exists a pattern and practice of\n\nopening plaintiff's incoming court mail outside his presence.\n\n     Plaintiff also alleges that defendants censored his mail.\n\nIn the context of the First Amendment and prison mail, however,\n\fcensorship     means   altering     or     \"withhold[ing]     delivery         of    a\n\nparticular letter.\"         Procunier, 416 at 417.       See Wolff, 418 U.S.\n\nat 576 (\"freedom from censorship is not equivalent to freedom\n\nfrom inspection or perusal\").             But see Taylor, 532 F.2d at 469\n\n(opening prisoner's mail is \"indirect censorship\").                      Plaintiff\n\npoints to only one occasion in which his mail was damaged, namely\n\nwhen the briefing schedule was cut.              We decline to hold that a\n\nsingle     instance    of    damaged      mail   rises   to      the     level      of\n\nconstitutionally       impermissible       censorship,      and        hence     this\n\nallegation cannot withstand the motion for summary judgment.\n    B.

Right to counsel\n\n          The plain language of the Sixth Amendment is limited to\n\ncriminal proceedings,4 and thus, for example, the Supreme Court\n\nhas   determined        that   the    Amendment's   guarantee    of    a    right   to\n\ncounsel does not extend to habeas corpus proceedings, which are\n\ncivil.       Finley, 481 U.S. at 555.            Moreover, in Wolff, the most\n\nrecent Supreme Court examination of the status of a prisoner's\n\nlegal mail, the Court held that \"[a]s to the Sixth Amendment, its\n\nreach is only to protect the attorney-client relationship from\n\nintrusion in the criminal setting.\"                 418 U.S. at 576 (emphasis\n\nadded).

Peterkin, 855 F.2d at 1039, 1041-42\n\n(discussing Hudson,            supra).         By    contrast,        the   adequacy     of    a\n\nprison law library concerned issues central to the right of court\n\naccess.     Id.\n\n       Plaintiff does allege he was injured by the damage to his\n\nbriefing schedule, but he offers no evidence to establish that\n\fthe    damage       obscured         the    dates,    nor    to    dispute       defendants'\n\ncontention that he received a separate notice from the clerk's\n\noffice pursuant to Third Circuit LAR Misc. 107.2(a), informing\n\nhim that he had fourteen days to file a brief else the appeal\n\nwould     be    dismissed.             We     conclude      that       plaintiff    has     not\n\ndemonstrated that he has suffered an actual injury regarding\n\ncourt access.\n\n       Nonetheless, and although the question is close, we conclude\n\nthat repeated violations of the confidentiality of a prisoner's\n\nincoming court mail is more central than ancillary to the right\n\nof    court     access,        and    thus     no    showing      of    actual     injury    is\n\nnecessary for plaintiff to establish that the right has been\n\ninfringed.          We are satisfied that a practice of opening court\n\nmail outside an inmate's presence implicates a core aspect of the\n\nright.     Such conduct inhibits an inmate's ability to protect his\n\nlegal rights in court and frustrates the principles of Bounds.\n\nUnlike    free      pens     or      slight    delays       in    notarizing       documents,\n\ninterference with such mail threatens the primary, often sole\n\nmeans by which a prisoner can exercise his constitutional rights.\n\nWithout    assurances          that        legal    correspondence,         including      both\n\nattorney and court mail, is confidential and secure, court access\n\ncan hardly be effective, adequate, and meaningful.\n\n       In so holding, we distinguish between a single, inadvertent\n\ninstance       of   an   inmate's          court    mail   being       opened    outside his\n\npresence,       and      a     pattern        and     practice         of   such    conduct.\n\nNotwithstanding          our    characterization           that    protection       of    court\n\nmail is central to an inmate's right of court access, and thus no\n\factual injury need be shown in the face of a pattern and practice\n\nof opening such mail outside of the inmate's presence, we do not\n\nnecessarily rule out the need to show such injury where the\n\nopening is isolated and inadvertent.                  See Castillo, 990 F.2d at\n\n306-07 (allegations that three pieces of incoming court mail were\n\nopened outside inmate's presence states colorable constitutional\n\nclaim); Washington, 782 F.2d at 1139 (distinguishing allegation\n\nthat    two   pieces     of   legal   mail     were    opened   outside      inmate's\n\npresence,      which     would      indicate     \"continuing       activity\"     and\n\ntherefore      constitutional         violation,       from     \"single      isolated\n\ninstance,\" which would not).

Determining whether a prisoner has demonstrated a\n\ncustom or practice is a fact-bound inquiry.\n\n       Lastly, we note several distinctions that may clarify our\n\ndiscussion of the right of court access as applied to prison\n\nlegal mail.      First, reading legal mail would appear to infringe\n\nthe right of access even more than simply opening and inspecting\n\nit.     Second, as the Supreme Court noted, the only way to ensure\n\nthat mail is not read when opened, and thus to vindicate the\n\nright to access, is to require that it be done in the presence of\n\fthe inmate to whom it is addressed.                 Wolff, 418 U.S. at 576-77.\n\nThird, interference with attorney mail probably infringes the\n\nright of court access even more than interference with court\n\nmail,         whether    the    correspondence       relates       to   a    criminal\n\nconviction, a subsequent collateral proceeding, or a civil suit\n\nto   protect        an    inmate's       constitutional       rights.        Of     all\n\ncommunications, attorney mail is the most sacrosanct.                             Thus,\n\nalthough the Sixth Amendment is not recognized as the repository\n\nfor such a shield in civil matters, see Finley, supra, the right\n\nof   court       access    guarantees      the     privacy    of    attorney-client\n\ncommunications.           See John W. Palmer, Constitutional Rights of\n\nPrisoners, 4th ed., at 40 (Anderson Publishing Co. 1991) (\"A\n\nbasic corollary to the right of access to the courts is the\n\ninmate's right to communicate with an attorney concerning the\n\nvalidity of his conviction or the constitutionality of conditions\n\nwithin the detention facility\").\n\n         We    conclude    that    a     pattern    and   practice      of    opening\n\nplaintiff's        properly     marked    incoming    court    mail     outside     his\n\npresence impinges upon his constitutional rights to free speech\n\nand court access.5             This determination does not depend on the\n     5\n     We add a note about the right to privacy, because plaintiff\nrelies on the Fourteenth Amendment and the district court cited\nthe decision in which Judge Reinhardt, in dissent, stated\n\"reading legal mail is a violation of the prisoner's privacy\nrights.\"   Stevenson, 877 F.2d at 1443.

Though the\n\nCourt announced a fairly searching standard in Procunier,6 its\n\nlater decisions in Turner and Abbott held that as to prison mail,\n\ninformation in the hands of prison officials may result in\nridicule, harassment, and retaliation. If prisoners are stripped\nof the right to communicate privately their love, their hopes,\nand   even  their   grievances,  then   recidivism  rather   than\nrehabilitation is fostered.      Similarly, opening legal mail\noutside the presence of an inmate, giving rise to the reasonable\ninference that such mail is read, may also implicate the right to\nprivacy. We do not reach this issue, however, as plaintiff has\nnot placed it before us.\n       6\n     In Procunier, the Court held that a prisoner's mail is\nprotected \"against unjustified governmental interference.\"    416\nU.S. at 408-09.    To justify interference, the government must\nshow an \"important or substantial governmental interest unrelated\nto the suppression of expression,\" id. at 413, and that the\nsuppression was \"no greater than is necessary or essential to the\nprotection of the particular governmental interest involved.\"\nId.\n\fthe    Procunier        standard   is   \"limited     to    regulations         concerning\n\noutgoing correspondence.\"               Abbott, 490 U.S. at 413 (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n       In Turner, the Court applied a less rigorous standard for\n\nreview of incoming mail, a standard which it applied in Abbott as\n\nwell.     The Court in Turner held that \"when a prison regulation\n\nimpinges on inmates' constitutional rights, the regulation is\n\nvalid    if   it    is     reasonably    related     to    legitimate         penological\n\ninterests.\"        Turner, 482 U.S. at 89.           See also Shabazz, 482 U.S.\n\nat 349-50 (applying Turner reasonableness standard to regulations\n\nthat restrict free exercise of inmate's religion).                             The Court\n\nthen      identified         several      factors         useful       in      evaluating\n\nreasonableness.           Id. at 89-91.    See also Abbott, 490 U.S. at 414-\n\n18; Sturm v. Clark, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"499059\"><a href=\"/opinion/499059/cheryl-j-sturm-v-clark-jj-supt-fpc-allenwood-mathis-earlando/\"><span class=\"volume\">835</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1009</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1013-14 (3d                        Cir. 1987).     The\n\nAbbott    Court         acknowledged    that   the    Turner       standard      is   more\n\ndeferential        to    prison    officials   than       that   of    Procunier,      but\n\nembraced the new test with the caveat that \"a reasonableness\n\nstandard is not toothless.\"              Abbott, 490 U.S. at 414.               See also\n\nTurner, 482 U.S. at 97 (ban on inmate marriage not reasonably\n\nrelated to legitimate penological interests).\n\n       Though the case before us concerns an alleged pattern and\n\npractice of official conduct, rather than a prison regulation,\n\napplication of the Turner standard is appropriate.                          See Brewer, 3\n\nF.3d at 825-26 (applying Turner standard to prison practice, not\n\nregulation).            We also note that the government does not argue\n\nthat the conduct alleged by plaintiff comports with Turner.\n\f      The first Turner factor asks whether there is a rational\n\nconnection between the infringing prison practice and a valid\n\ngovernment interest.        To justify interference with prisoner mail,\n\nofficials typically invoke their interests in rehabilitation of\n\ninmates and institutional security.             See, e.g., Abbott, 490 U.S.\n\nat 415; Shabazz, 482 U.S. at 348.               First, in the absence of a\n\ndetermination by, for example, a prison psychiatrist that receipt\n\nof particular correspondence would disturb an inmate, we hesitate\n\nto conclude that the government interest in rehabilitation is\n\nserved     by   opening     incoming    court    mail   outside    an   inmate's\n\npresence.       See Ramos, 639 F.2d at 581-81.          Second, the interest\n\nin institutional security is generally linked to mail on the\n\nsupposition that correspondence may contain plans for escape or\n\nincite violence.       We recognize the validity of this substantial\n\ninterest, but to argue that it is served on the facts of this\n\ncase--to    suggest    that    repeatedly   opening     incoming    court   mail\n\noutside the presence of an inmate advances a legitimate interest\n\nin institutional security--would overreach.\n\n      In addition, we note that prison officials themselves have\n\nlong recognized that providing a confidential, reliable means for\n\nprisoners to communicate their grievances to impartial courts and\n\ngovernment officials, and to obtain a fair resolution of those\n\ngrievances, releases tension in the prisons and itself advances\n\nthe   state      interest     in   maintaining    institutional     order    and\n\nsecurity.       See generally Ira P. Robbins, The Prisoners' Mail Box\nand the Evolution of Federal Inmate Rights, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">127</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993)\n\n(\"Prisoners' Mail Box\").           In 1929, for example, Superintendent of\n\fPrisons (and later first Director of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons)\n\nSanford Bates wrote to the warden of the federal jail at Fort\n\nLeavenworth:\n     It seems to me important that the inmates in your\n     institution should have some reasonable and dignified method\n     of making known any real or fancied grievance that they\n     might have.   An institution is a good deal like a steam\n     boiler, and needs a safety valve occasionally.\n\n\nPrisoners' Mail Box, 144 F.R.D. at 143.               An understanding of the\n\nbenefits of such a \"safety-valve\" persuaded prison officials that\n\npreserving     the   confidentiality      of   communications         with courts,\n\nagencies,     and    legislators      advanced,      rather    than    frustrated,\n\nimportant penological interests.           Id. at 148-49, 153-54.7\n\n         Consideration of the second Turner factor, the availability\n\nof   alternate      means   of    exercising   the    rights    at    issue,   also\n\nindicates that defendants' practice is not reasonably related to\n\na legitimate interest.           Although other means of expression remain\n\navailable to prisoners even when prison officials interfere with\n\ntheir general mail, Abbott, 490 U.S. at 417-18, we are not aware\n\nof means other than by way of uninhibited use of the mail for pro\n\nse prisoners to exercise their rights of court access.\n\n         Finally, the third Turner factor concerns the burdens of\n\naccommodating the exercise of prisoners' constitutional rights.\n\nTo accommodate plaintiff's rights to free speech and court access\n     7\n     Interestingly, though prison officials initially censored\ninmate correspondence to federal judges to ensure that the\ncontent was decent, respectful, and non-libelous, when federal\njudges and even the Clerk of the U.S. Supreme Court expressed a\npreference for receiving prisoner mail unopened and unexpurgated,\nthe Bureau of Prisons changed its procedures.     Prisoners' Mail\nBox, 144 F.R.D. at 155, 159-60.\n\fby opening his incoming court mail only in his presence places no\n\nburden at all on guards, prisoners, and the allocation of prison\n\nresources: it is what the regulations have required since 1985.\n\nSee 28 C.F.R. §540.18 (1994).\n\n      We hold that the pattern and practice of opening plaintiff's\n\nproperly marked incoming court mail outside his presence fails\n\nthe Turner reasonableness standard and violates the Constitution.\n\nWe acknowledge that our conclusion differs from that of the Fifth\n\nCircuit, see Brewer, 3 F.3d at 825, but note that it comports\n\nwith the results reached by the majority of courts of appeals to\n\nconsider these precise or similar issues, not to mention the\n\nresults reached by our own district courts.

Although\n\npromulgation      of   a   regulation      will       not    constitutionalize           its\n\nviolation, §540.18 and the Policy Statement surely undermine any\n\nclaim    by    defendants    that       they   were     unaware          of   their     legal\n\nobligations in handling plaintiff's mail.                    Thus the government's\n\nargument is reduced to the contention that while the illegality\n\fof their behavior was manifest, the constitutional magnitude of\n\ntheir actions was murky.\n\n      We disagree.          First, in Procunier and Wolff the Supreme\n\nCourt made clear that the treatment of a prisoner's legal mail\n\nimplicates constitutional rights to free speech and court access.\n\nThe subsequent decisions in Turner and Abbott did not question\n\nthat interference with prison mail infringed these constitutional\n\nrights;     the    latter     decisions      merely     established          that   such\n\ninfringement       was      constitutionally        permissible         if     it    was\n\nreasonably related to a legitimate penological purpose.                             Here,\n\ndefendants    do    not     even   argue    that    their   conduct      meets      this\n\nstandard.\n\n      Second,      though    numerous       other     courts     of   appeals       have\n\nconsidered conduct akin to that alleged by plaintiff, no gaping\n\ndivide has emerged in the jurisprudence such that defendants\n\ncould reasonably expect this circuit to rule other than we do.\n\nSee Lavado, 992 F.2d at 609-10; Castillo, 990 F.2d at 307; Lemon,\n\n931 F.2d at 1465; Washington, 782 F.2d at 1139; Ramos, 639 F.2d\n\nat 582; Jensen, 648 F.2d at 1182-83.                Only the Fifth Circuit has\n\nreached a contrary decision.               Brewer, 3 F.3d at 825; Walker, 4\nF.3d at 413.\n\n      The Seventh Circuit's decision in Castillo is particularly\n\ninstructive.       There, a prisoner alleged that three letters from a\n\nfederal courthouse were opened outside his presence.                            Because\n\nthree instances \"may be indicative of ongoing activity,\" 990 F.2d\n\nat   306,   the    Seventh    Circuit      determined     that    the    inmate      had\n\n\"presented a colorable claim\" of a constitutional violation and\n\freversed the district court's dismissal of the action.                            Id. at\n\n307.\n\n        The Sixth Circuit's decision in Lavado is also relevant.\n\nThere, the court denied summary judgment to defendant prison\n\nofficials on the basis of qualified immunity where one letter\n\nfrom the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit was allegedly\n\nopened outside an inmate's presence and a second letter, from a\n\nstate    law   department,       was    allegedly        opened    and    read   in     his\n\npresence.      Lavado, 992 F.2d at 609-10.                 The Sixth Circuit held\n\nthat     \"it   was      clearly       established         at   the       time    of     the\n\nopenings/reading in the instant case that prisoners' mail could\n\nnot be opened or read in [an] arbitrary or capricious fashion.\"\n\nId. at 610.\n\n       Third, the district courts in our circuit who have addressed\n\nthe issue have consistently determined that repeatedly opening a\n\nprisoner's      legal     mail        outside      his    presence       violates       the\n\nConstitution.

We think the facts of Castillo, Lavado,\n\nProudfoot, and Carty enjoy a substantial \"factual correspondence\"\n\nto the circumstances here.\n\n     Thus, we conclude that though our court has not previously\n\nruled on this precise issue, the contours of defendants' legal\n\nobligations     under    the     regulations      and   Constitution      were\n\nsufficiently    clear   that     a   reasonable     prison    official    would\n\nunderstand that repeatedly opening plaintiff's properly marked\n\nincoming    court     mail     outside     his    presence     violates     the\n\nConstitution.       Accordingly, we will reverse the district court\n\norder   granting    defendants    qualified      immunity    from   plaintiff's\n\nclaims.\n\n                                     VI.\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm in part, see note\n\n1, supra, and reverse in part the order of the district court\n\ngranting summary judgment to all defendants on all claims.\n\fBieregu v. Reno, No. 94-5719\n\n\n\n\nSCIRICA, Circuit Judge, concurring.\n\n\n\n\n            I agree that Bieregu has alleged a constitutional\n\nviolation of his right to court access, and that the law was\n\nsufficiently established to preclude a finding of qualified\n\nimmunity.   But I have doubts that Bieregu's free speech rights\n\nare implicated here.\n\n            First Amendment free speech rights are implicated when\n\nprison officials censor inmates' mail.

Martinez,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109016\"><a href=\"/opinion/109016/procunier-v-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">396</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 409 (1974), overruled on other grounds, Thornburgh\n\nv.

Because it is far from\n\nclear that defendants censored Bieregu's court mail, I would base\n\nthis holding on his constitutional right to court access.\n\n                 Also, because Bieregu has not claimed his right to\n\nprivacy was infringed, it is unnecessary to address this issue.\n\f\f</pre>",
