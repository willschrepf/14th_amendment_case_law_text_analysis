Thurman,page 2 (~~-761)\n\n        As you have explained in your opinion request, Article\n5143,  VernonXs Civil Statutes, enacted by the 55th Legislature\nin 1957, created the Texas Youth Council as successor to the State\nYout,hDevelopment Council and also placed under its jurisdiction\nthe Corsicana State Home, the Waco State Home, and the Texas Blind,\nDeaf and Orphan School. Article 5143d, Sections 1,4(f), 8. Sec-\ntion 8 provides:\n        \"The Texas Youth Council shall succeed to and\n    be vested with all ri.ghts,powers, duties, facilities,\n    personnel, records and appropriations, relating to\n    the care, custody, and control of children, now held\n    by (a) the State Youth Development Council, including\n    the Gatesville State School for Boys, the Gainesville\n    State School for Girls, and the Crockett State School\n    for Negro Girls; (b) the Board for Texas State Hospi-\n    tals and Spec,iaLSchools in respect to the Corsicana\n    Sta,teHome and Texas Blind, Deaf and Orphan Home; and\n    (c) the Department of Public Welfare with respect to\n    the Waco State Home.\"\n        Section 25 of Article 514311reads in part as follows:\n        \"(a) Por the parpose of,carrying out its duties,\n    the You,thCouncil is authorized to make use of law\n    enforcement, detention, supervisory, medical.,educa-\n    tional, correctional, segregative, and other facilities,\n    institutions and agencies within the state. When funds\n    are available for the purpose, the Youth Council may\n    enter into agreements with the appropriate private or\n    public'official for separate care and special treatment\n    in existing institutions of persons subject to the\n    control of the Youth Council.\"\n        We think this section is broad enough to encompass foster\nhomes, inc:LudSngchildren's boarding homes, as those terms are used\nin child welfare work.\n        The currerat<generalAppropriation Act (Chapter 23, Article.\n :, Sectlon 40, Acts o.fthe 56th Legislature, Third Called Session,\n Fjg,*at page 504) contains the following provision:\n       \"Sec. 40. Foster Home Care. Pursuant to existing\n   statutory authority, t.heCouncil may place children\n   committed to its custody in approved foster homes and\n   from the appropria'tionsmade in this Act for 'operating\n   expenses' of the respective institutions under its juris-\n   diction may reimburse such approved foster homes at a\n   reasonable rate not to exceed $1.50 per child per day;\n   prowl,ded,however, that none ofthe moneys appropriated\n   in this Act may be pald to any employee of the Texas\n\fHonorable James A. Turman, page 3 (W-761)\n\n    Youth Council for such foster home care, nor may\n    any of the moneys appropriated In this Act be ex-\n    pended to any foster home in which any employee of\n    said Youth Council has a financial interest. Any\n    children placed in foster homes shall be deemed to\n    have the same status of other children in the homes\n    or institutions under the Youth Council, and shall\n    continue to be wards and subject to the guardianship\n    of the superintendent of such respective homes or\n    institutions.\"\n        There are two requirements that are needed for the Comp-\ntroller to have authority to issue warrants. The Legislature must\nprovide general statutory authority to accomplish a certain purpose\nand it must provide funds to pay for that purpose. Section 25 of\nArticle 5143d provides the authority for the Youth Council to place\nchildren in its custody in foster homes and the above-quoted section\nin the General Appropriation Act provides the funds to accomplish\nthis purpose. Therefore, the Legislature has given the Comptroller\nthe authority to issue warrants covering the cost of foster home\ncare for children in the custody of the Council.\n        Section 25 of Article 5143d does not set a limit on the rate\nof pay for foster home care, but the Appropriation Act provides that\nthe rate shall not exceed $1.50 per child per day. An appropriation\nbill may contain provisions which detail, limit, or restrict the use\nof the funds, if the provisions are necessarily connected with and\nincidental to the appropriation and do not conflict with general\nlegislation. Att'y Gen. Op. V-1254 (1951). The provision authorizing\npayment not to exceed $1.50 per child per day clearly is a valid pro-\nvision with respect to foster care for children in all the institu-\ntions under the jurisdiction of the Council other than the Waco State\nHome. We shallconsider whether it is valid with respect to the Waco\nState Home in answering your second question, which we restate:\n\n        \"In the creation of the Texas Youth Council and\n    the delegation of the administrative responsibilities\n    thereto, was it the legislative intent that children\n    in the Waco State Home be provided less, in terms of\n    foster care provisions, than the other five institu-\n    tions under this agency?\"\n        Article 3259 of the Revised Civil Statutes, last amended in\n1941, provides in essence that children committed to the Waco State\nHome may be placed in children's boarding homes at a reasonable rate\nnot to exceed $1.00 per child per day, and also contains other con-\nditions and restrictions on placement. If this general law provision\nhas not been repealed or superseded by subsequent general legislation,\nthe appropriation rider Is invalid insofar as it attempts to raise\nthe limit to $1.50 for care In boarding homes used by the Waco State\nHome.\n\f                                                                     --   .\n\n\n\n\nHonorable James A. Turman, page 4 (W-761)\n\n        It is our opinion that Section 25 of Article 5143d has\nsuperseded Article 3259 and that the $1.00 limit Is therefore no\nlonger in effect. Consequently, the $1.50 limitation in the Appro-\npriation Act is fully applicable to the Waco State Home as well as\nto the other five institutions under the Youth Council.\n        Section 39 of Article 5143d expressly repeals conflicting\nlaws to the extent of conflict. Even without an express provision\nfor repeal, where a new statute embraces the subject of a former\none and creates a new and independent system relative to the subject\nmatter oftthe two statutes, it is construed as an implied repeal of\nthe former statute, although there is nothing in the provisions of\nthe two statutes which might not stand together if all of their terms\nwere inserted in one act.
