On July 7, 1969 a desegregation plan for the Ascension Parish School District was filed by the Office of Education of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.

As this Court said in Singleton, 'the tenor of the decision in Alexander v. Holmes County, is to shift the burden from the standpoint of time for converting to unitary school systems.  The shift is from a status of litigation to one of unitary operation pending litigation.'  The plan proposed by the Parish School Board proposed some separation of pupils by sex in the future.
