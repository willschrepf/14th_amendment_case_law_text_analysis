Rev. Stat. §§ 48-1101-48-1126; federal\ncivil rights statutes, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983; and Nebraska’s civil rights statute,\nNeb. Rev. Stat. § 20-148. Al-Zubaidy claims he was discharged and harassed based\n\fon his race, sex, religion and national origin. Al-Zubaidy also asserts he was\nsubjected to unlawful retaliation. The district court1 granted summary judgment in\nfavor of TEK and Unger. We affirm.\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n       Al-Zubaidy is a male Shiite Muslim of Iraqi descent serving a prison sentence\nfor first-degree assault, second-degree assault, and use of a weapon to commit a\nfelony. See State v. Al-Zubaidy, 641 N.W.2d 362, 367 (Neb. 2002). TEK is a private\ncorporation with a manufacturing facility in Fremont, Nebraska, and another\nmanufacturing facility located at the Penitentiary in Lincoln, Nebraska. Under an\nagreement with Cornhusker State Industries, acting under the authority of the\nNebraska State Department of Corrections, TEK offers private venture employment\nto approximately 110 inmates at the Penitentiary. TEK pays the inmates at least\nminimum wage, while inmates in other jobs receive between $1.50 and $2.25 per day.\nTEK employs managers, who are not inmates or Penitentiary employees, to supervise\nthe inmates. However, prison guards are present at all times in TEK’s workplace.\nUnger is TEK’s Production Manager at the facility located at the Penitentiary.\n\n      In February 1999, TEK hired Al-Zubaidy to work part-time in TEK’s\nPenitentiary die shop. The die shop produces, and eventually distributes, materials\nused in educational products for schools and for the arts-and-crafts industry. Al-\nZubaidy’s direct supervisor was Unger. During 1999, Al-Zubaidy had no problems\nwith how Unger treated him. In March 2000, Unger gave Al-Zubaidy “a pretty good\nevaluation,” which resulted in a forty-five cent per hour raise. Al-Zubaidy signed the\nevaluation in June 2000. Al-Zubaidy received another performance evaluation in\nMarch 2001, which resulted in another pay raise.\n\n\n\n      1\n       The Honorable Laurie Smith Camp, United States District Judge for the\nDistrict of Nebraska.\n\n                                         -2-\n\f      In March 2001, Al-Zubaidy’s relationship with Unger began to deteriorate. Al-\nZubaidy wrote TEK’s president complaining Unger did not like certain workers,\nincluding Al-Zubaidy, and Unger did not treat these workers fairly, including white\nand non-Muslim workers. On March 26, Al-Zubaidy met with Unger and another\nsupervisor to discuss Al-Zubaidy’s complaint that Unger had laughed and told\nanother employee, “I didn’t understand a single word [Al-Zubaidy] just said.” Unger\napologized to Al-Zubaidy for the incident. Al-Zubaidy admittedly does not speak\nEnglish very well, which requires people to ask that he repeat himself. In addition,\nAl-Zubaidy acknowledges TEK’s work space at the Penitentiary is loud, and\n“sometimes it’s hard to hear someone there because it’s so loud.” Al-Zubaidy did not\nmake any other complaints at this meeting.\n\n       On May 2, Al-Zubaidy filed a charge of discrimination with the Nebraska\nEqual Opportunity Commission (NEOC), alleging discrimination based on race,\ncolor, sex, religion and national origin. In this administrative charge of\ndiscrimination, Al-Zubaidy made a number of allegations: (1) in June 2000, Unger\ntold another inmate, “don’t listen to dumb ass [Al-Zubaidy], he thinks he knows\neverything”; (2) in August 2000, Unger sprinkled water on Al-Zubaidy, and said,\n“bless you my child”; (3) in November 2000, Al-Zubaidy jokingly told another\nemployee TEK was going to serve “boiled eggs” for the holiday meal, which\nprompted Unger to say, “did you hear what [Al-Zubaidy] just said? he said boiled\ndick”; (4) in January 2001, Unger told Al-Zubaidy to “go to the bathroom . . . to clean\n[his] underwear” after a near collision in the workplace; (5) in March 2001, Unger\ntold another employee she “didn’t understand a single word [Al-Zubaidy] just said”;\nand (6) Unger tried to get Al-Zubaidy discharged.\n\n      In August 2001, Unger promoted Al-Zubaidy to the skilled position of die\nmaker. Even though Al-Zubaidy failed the first test for this position, which usually\neliminates the opportunity to work as a die maker, Unger allowed Al-Zubaidy to\nretake the test, which he passed.\n\n                                         -3-\n\f      Also in August 2001, the NEOC dismissed Al-Zubaidy’s discrimination\ncharge. Noting “[t]he Nebraska Attorney General has issued opinion #99-027 that\nprison laborers are not employees under the [NFEPA],” the NEOC administratively\nclosed the case because it lacked jurisdiction over Al-Zubaidy’s charge.2 The Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Commission also dismissed Al-Zubaidy’s charge, and\nissued its Notice of Suit Rights.\n\n       After filing a Complaint and an Amended Complaint in the district court, Al-\nZubaidy filed a twenty-three page (excluding attachments) pro se Second Amended\nComplaint for Civil Rights Violations against TEK and Unger, presenting nine causes\nof action. Al-Zubaidy alleged TEK and Unger violated Title VII, the NFEPA, and\nfederal and state civil rights statutes. Al-Zubaidy claimed TEK and Unger\nintentionally discriminated against him based on his race, sex, religion and national\norigin. Al-Zubaidy’s theories of recovery included discriminatory discharge,\nunlawful harassment and retaliation. An inmate laborer filed an affidavit claiming\nUnger told him in April 2001 “to report to our Camel Jockey, he will show you how\nto ride the Camel.” Another inmate laborer filed an affidavit swearing Unger set up\nAl-Zubaidy “by making it appear as though he was responsible for missing tools[,\neven though] Unger knew that the tools belonged to someone else.” Another inmate\n\n\n      2\n       Responding to a question posed by the NEOC’s Executive Director,\nNebraska’s Attorney General asked “whether prison inmates working for a private\nventure [i.e., TEK] located at the Nebraska State Penitentiary are considered\n‘employees’ under the meaning of the [NFEPA].” Neb. Att’y Gen. Op., No. 99027,\n1999 WL 395096, at *1 (June 7, 1999). Acknowledging it was unclear how Nebraska\ncourts would respond to the question, the Attorney General turned to federal cases\ndefining the term “employee,” a Nebraska Worker’s Compensation case addressing\nthe employment status of an inmate, and Nebraska cases discussing principles\ngoverning the employment relationship. Id. at *1-5. After reviewing the principles\nenunciated in those contexts, the Attorney General concluded Nebraska courts would\ndetermine inmates are not employees under the NFEPA. Id. at *5.\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fsubmitted an affidavit stating “a homemade key was alleged to have been found” on\nOctober 23, 2001, and attributed to Al-Zubaidy. As a result of the discovery of this\ncontraband, the Penitentiary placed Al-Zubaidy in segregation, which resulted in Al-\nZubaidy’s discharge from TEK for excessive absences. Al-Zubaidy admitted he does\nnot have any evidence that Unger set him up.\n\n       Granting summary judgment to TEK and Unger on all claims, the district court\ndismissed Al-Zubaidy’s Second Amended Complaint with prejudice. First, the\ndistrict court relied on the Nebraska Attorney General’s opinion to hold Al-Zubaidy’s\n“claims pursuant to NFEPA must be dismissed because under Nebraska law, prison\nlaborers are not ‘employees’ entitled to redress under NFEPA.” Second, the district\ncourt dismissed Al-Zubaidy’s discriminatory discharge claims because “the summary\njudgment record contains no evidence on which a jury could reasonably find that [Al-\nZubaidy]’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin played any part in the decision\nto terminate [Al-Zubaidy]’s employment.” Finally, the district court dismissed Al-\nZubaidy’s hostile work environment claims, concluding (1) most of the remarks made\nagainst Al-Zubaidy “bore no relation to [his] gender, religion, race or national\norigin”; and (2) “the alleged harassment ‘was not so severe or pervasive as to alter a\nterm, condition, or privilege of [Al-Zubaidy’s] employment.’”\n\n       Al-Zubaidy appeals the district court’s grant of summary judgment to TEK and\nUnger. Al-Zubaidy contends the district court erroneously dismissed the\n(1) discriminatory discharge claims; (2) hostile work environment claims;\n(3) derivative civil rights claims; and (4) NFEPA claims. Al-Zubaidy does not appeal\nthe district court’s dismissal of Al-Zubaidy’s retaliation claims, and his attorney\nacknowledged at oral argument Al-Zubaidy has abandoned those claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fII.    DISCUSSION\n       A.    Standard of Review\n       We review de novo the district court’s grant of summary judgment to TEK and\nUnger. Mayer v. Nextel West Corp., 318 F.3d 803, 806 (8th Cir. 2003). Summary\njudgment is proper if the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Al-Zubaidy\nand giving him the benefit of all reasonable inferences, shows there are no genuine\nissues of material fact and TEK and Unger are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\nSee id.; Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). “Evidence, not contentions, avoids summary\njudgment.” Mayer, 318 F.3d at 809.\n\n      B.     Discriminatory Discharge\n      Title VII prohibits an employer from discharging an individual “because of\nsuch individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e-2(a)(1). Al-Zubaidy claims TEK did not discharge him because of his\nexcessive absences, but instead discharged him based on his race, sex, religion and\nnational origin.\n\n       Al-Zubaidy’s discriminatory discharge claims must be analyzed under the\nMcDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. Elmahdi v. Marriott Hotel Servs.,\nInc., 339 F.3d 645, 656 (8th Cir. 2003) (citing McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,\n411 U.S. 792, 802-03 (1973)). Under this framework, Al-Zubaidy must establish a\nprima facie case of discrimination by showing (1) he is a member of a protected class,\n(2) he was qualified for his position with TEK, and (3) despite being qualified, he was\ndischarged. Id. If Al-Zubaidy successfully establishes his prima facie case, a\nrebuttable presumption of discrimination arises. Id. At this point, the burden of\nproduction shifts to TEK and Unger to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory\nreason for discharging Al-Zubaidy. Id. If TEK and Unger articulate such a reason,\nthe presumption of discrimination disappears, and Al-Zubaidy must prove the\nproffered reason for the discharge was merely a pretext for intentional discrimination.\nId. Even though we use the McDonnell Douglas test as a tool to uncover intentional\n\n                                         -6-\n\fdiscrimination, Al-Zubaidy never loses the ultimate burden of proving TEK and\nUnger intentionally discriminated against him. See id.\n\n       We agree with the district court that Al-Zubaidy failed to establish a\nsubmissible claim of discriminatory discharge. We initially conclude Al-Zubaidy\nfailed to establish a prima facie case because he was not qualified for his position at\nthe time he was discharged–he was unable to work at all. Regardless of the status of\nAl-Zubaidy’s prima facie case, however, TEK and Unger contend they discharged Al-\nZubaidy for excessive absences, which constitute a legitimate, nondiscriminatory\nreason for discharge. Given this proffered reason for discharge, Al-Zubaidy bears the\nburden of showing this reason was a pretext for intentional discrimination. To this\nend, Al-Zubaidy contends Unger connived to set him up so she could discharge him\nbased on his race, sex, religion and national origin. No reasonable inference can\nestablish these claims. First, Al-Zubaidy presented no evidence, other than mere\ncontentions, that Unger set him up to discharge him. Second, the record defies these\ncontentions. Unger consistently gave Al-Zubaidy favorable evaluations, which\nresulted in two wage increases. In August 2001, when Al-Zubaidy tested for the\nposition of die maker but failed the test, Unger ignored TEK’s policy and allowed Al-\nZubaidy to retake the test. When Al-Zubaidy used Unger’s opportunity and passed\nthe test, Unger promoted Al-Zubaidy to die maker. This evidence does not allow a\nreasonable inference that Unger plotted to discharge Al-Zubaidy based on his race,\nsex, religion or national origin.\n\n      On appeal, Al-Zubaidy attempts to recast his discriminatory discharge claim\nas a failure-to-rehire claim. Al-Zubaidy did not file an administrative charge of\ndiscrimination based on TEK’s failure to rehire him, and he failed to argue this theory\nbefore the district court. A discriminatory failure-to-rehire claim is wholly distinct\nfrom a discriminatory discharge claim, and both claims must be administratively\nexhausted before a federal court has jurisdiction over the claims. Shelton v. Boeing\nCo., 399 F.3d 909, 913 (8th Cir. 2005). Furthermore, it has long been the general rule\n\n                                         -7-\n\f“that a federal appellate court does not consider an issue not passed upon below,”\nSingleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 120 (1976), and we have no interest in allowing Al-\nZubaidy to recast his cause of action on appeal to survive the district court’s\ndismissal, cf. Associated Ins. Mgmt. Corp. v. Ark. Gen. Agency, 149 F.3d 794, 798\n(8th Cir. 1998) (declining “to recast the cause of action to create diversity jurisdiction\nthat was neither pleaded nor requested in the district court”). Therefore, we decline\nAl-Zubaidy’s invitation to allow a failure-to-rehire claim to proceed.3\n\n       C.     Hostile Work Environment\n       Title VII also prohibits an employer from subjecting its employees to a hostile\nwork environment “because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national\norigin.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1); see, e.g., Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan,\n536 U.S. 101, 116 n.10 (2002) (racial harassment); Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v.\nVinson, 477 U.S. 57, 66 (1986) (sexual harassment). To establish a hostile work\nenvironment claim, Al-Zubaidy must show (1) he is a member of a protected class,\n(2) he was subjected to unwelcome harassment, (3) the harassment was based on a\nprotected characteristic under Title VII, (4) the harassment affected a term, condition\nor privilege of employment, and (5) employer liability. See generally Willis v.\nHenderson, 262 F.3d 801, 808 (8th Cir. 2001). There can be no doubt federal\n\n\n      3\n        To the extent Al-Zubaidy claims TEK’s failure to rehire him proves its\nproffered reason for discharging him (i.e., excessive absences) was pretextual, we\nreject this late argument. Nothing in the record indicates TEK would not have\ndischarged Al-Zubaidy based on excessive absences. The only evidence that could\nassist Al-Zubaidy with this new argument is an affidavit filed by an inmate who stated\nhe was rehired after the reasons for his discharge were deemed unfounded. However,\nthis bare-bones affidavit does not explain that inmate’s race, color, religion or\nnational origin such that we could determine whether he is similarly situated to Al-\nZubaidy, nor does the affidavit explain any of the circumstances surrounding the\ninmate’s discharge or rehiring. Thus, no reasonable inferences can be gleaned from\nthe inmate’s affidavit to establish TEK discharged Al-Zubaidy based on his race, sex,\nreligion or national origin.\n\n                                           -8-\n\fharassment standards are demanding. See McCurdy v. Ark. State Police, 375 F.3d\n762, 768 (8th Cir. 2004). Indeed, the Supreme Court has “made it clear that conduct\nmust be extreme to amount to a change in the terms and conditions of employment.”\nFaragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 788 (1998). The Supreme Court also\nhas made it abundantly clear that the “standards for judging hostility are sufficiently\ndemanding to ensure that Title VII does not become a ‘general civility code.’” Id.\n(citation omitted).\n\n       Title VII is violated only “[w]hen the workplace is permeated with\n‘discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult,’ that is ‘sufficiently severe or\npervasive to alter the conditions of the victim’s employment and create an abusive\nworking environment.’” Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993) (quoting\nMeritor Sav. Bank, 477 U.S. at 65, 67). We can determine “whether an environment\nis ‘hostile’ or ‘abusive’ . . . only by looking at all the circumstances[, which] may\ninclude the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is\nphysically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it\nunreasonably interferes with an employee’s work performance.” Id. at 23.\n\n       The Supreme Court has cautioned courts to be alert for workplace behavior that\ndoes not rise to the level of actionable harassment. For example, “Title VII does not\nprohibit ‘genuine but innocuous differences in the ways men and women routinely\ninteract.’” Faragher, 524 U.S. at 788 (quoting Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs.,\nInc., 523 U.S. 75, 81 (1998)). The Court often has made the point that “‘simple\nteasing,’ offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not\namount to discriminatory changes in the ‘terms and conditions of employment.’” Id.\n(quoting Oncale, 523 U.S. at 82). The Court implores lower courts to apply the\ndemanding harassment standards to “filter out complaints attacking ‘the ordinary\ntribulations of the workplace, such as the sporadic use of abusive language,\ngender-related jokes, and occasional teasing.’” Id. (citation omitted).\n\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f       We conclude the district court appropriately dismissed Al-Zubaidy’s hostile\nwork environment claims because his workplace at the Penitentiary was not\npermeated with severe or pervasive harassment sufficient to alter the terms,\nconditions or privileges of employment. Al-Zubaidy produced only a few comments\nUnger allegedly made over a ten-month period. Most of these offhand and isolated\ncomments were wholly unrelated to each other and had a tenuous connection to race,\nsex, religion or national origin. Unger’s comments were infrequent, were not severe,\nnever physically threatened Al-Zubaidy, were more akin to mere offensive utterances,\nand did not interfere with Al-Zubaidy’s work performance. Indeed, Al-Zubaidy even\nreceived pay raises and a promotion both before and after Unger made these\ncomments. Al-Zubaidy’s evidence falls far short of the Supreme Court’s demanding\nharassment standards.\n\n       D.     Civil Rights Claims\n       In a one-paragraph argument in his brief, Al-Zubaidy explicitly ties the fate of\nhis federal and state civil rights claims to his success on his Title VII claims. Because\nwe hold the district court properly dismissed Al-Zubaidy’s Title VII claims, we\nlikewise conclude Al-Zubaidy’s derivative civil rights claims lack merit.\n\n        E.    NFEPA\n        Finally, Al-Zubaidy argues the district court mistakenly relied on the Nebraska\nAttorney General’s opinion in dismissing Al-Zubaidy’s claims under the NFEPA. Al-\nZubaidy maintains the district court should not have dismissed the NFEPA claims,\nbut rather should “have certified the question [of whether TEK’s prison laborers are\nemployees under the NFEPA] to the Nebraska Supreme Court, or, at the very least,\ndismissed the claim without prejudice if it declined to exercise jurisdiction in view\nof its dismissal of the other claims.”\n\n      Similar to Title VII, the NFEPA prohibits an employer from discharging or\nharassing an individual “because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex,\n\n                                          -10-\n\fdisability, marital status, or national origin.” Neb. Rev. Stat. § 48-1104(1). Both the\nNebraska Supreme Court and our court have stated the NFEPA “is patterned after\nTitle VII,” and, therefore, “it is appropriate to consider federal court decisions\nconstruing the federal legislation” when considering questions under the NFEPA.\nCity of Fort Calhoun v. Collins, 500 N.W.2d 822, 825 (Neb. 1993); see also Orr v.\nWal-Mart Stores, Inc., 297 F.3d 720, 723 (8th Cir. 2002).\n\n      Whether inmates working for TEK at the Penitentiary are employees under the\nNFEPA is a vital policy issue for the State of Nebraska. Its importance is\nunderscored by the NEOC’s written request to the Nebraska Attorney General asking\nfor an answer to this consequential question. However, the posture of this case\ndissuades us from offering what would amount to a gratuitous analysis of whether the\nAttorney General rightly decided whether an inmate working for TEK at the\nPenitentiary is an employee under the NFEPA. Al-Zubaidy’s state claims under the\nNFEPA mirrored his federal claims under Title VII, and his discrimination and\nharassment claims under Title VII failed. Therefore, Al-Zubaidy would enjoy no\ngreater success with those same claims under the NFEPA.\n\n       Similarly, Al-Zubaidy’s retaliation claim under Title VII was dismissed, and\nAl-Zubaidy failed to appeal that dismissal or even discuss the retaliation claim in\neither his initial brief or in his reply brief. At oral argument, Al-Zubaidy\nacknowledged he has abandoned his Title VII retaliation claim. Therefore, we deem\nAl-Zubaidy’s failure to raise the retaliation claim amounts to an abandonment of that\nclaim. Jasperson v. Purolator Courier Corp., 765 F.2d 736, 740 (8th Cir. 1985). The\nfailure of Al-Zubaidy’s Title VII retaliation claim likewise dooms his retaliation\nclaim under the NFEPA.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fIII.

BACKGROUND\n       Al-Zubaidy is a male Shiite Muslim of Iraqi descent serving a prison sentence\nfor first-degree assault, second-degree assault, and use of a weapon to commit a\nfelony. See State v. Al-Zubaidy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1803860\"><a href=\"/opinion/1803860/state-v-al-zubaidy/\"><span class=\"volume\">641</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 367 (Neb. 2002). TEK is a private\ncorporation with a manufacturing facility in Fremont, Nebraska, and another\nmanufacturing facility located at the Penitentiary in Lincoln, Nebraska. Under an\nagreement with Cornhusker State Industries, acting under the authority of the\nNebraska State Department of Corrections, TEK offers private venture employment\nto approximately 110 inmates at the Penitentiary. TEK pays the inmates at least\nminimum wage, while inmates in other jobs receive between $1.50 and $2.25 per day.\nTEK employs managers, who are not inmates or Penitentiary employees, to supervise\nthe inmates. However, prison guards are present at all times in TEK’s workplace.\nUnger is TEK’s Production Manager at the facility located at the Penitentiary.\n\n      In February 1999, TEK hired Al-Zubaidy to work part-time in TEK’s\nPenitentiary die shop. The die shop produces, and eventually distributes, materials\nused in educational products for schools and for the arts-and-crafts industry. Al-\nZubaidy’s direct supervisor was Unger. During 1999, Al-Zubaidy had no problems\nwith how Unger treated him. In March 2000, Unger gave Al-Zubaidy “a pretty good\nevaluation,” which resulted in a forty-five cent per hour raise. Al-Zubaidy signed the\nevaluation in June 2000. Al-Zubaidy received another performance evaluation in\nMarch 2001, which resulted in another pay raise.\n\n\n\n      1\n       The Honorable Laurie Smith Camp, United States District Judge for the\nDistrict of Nebraska.\n\n                                         -2-\n\f      In March 2001, Al-Zubaidy’s relationship with Unger began to deteriorate. Al-\nZubaidy wrote TEK’s president complaining Unger did not like certain workers,\nincluding Al-Zubaidy, and Unger did not treat these workers fairly, including white\nand non-Muslim workers. On March 26, Al-Zubaidy met with Unger and another\nsupervisor to discuss Al-Zubaidy’s complaint that Unger had laughed and told\nanother employee, “I didn’t understand a single word [Al-Zubaidy] just said.” Unger\napologized to Al-Zubaidy for the incident. Al-Zubaidy admittedly does not speak\nEnglish very well, which requires people to ask that he repeat himself. In addition,\nAl-Zubaidy acknowledges TEK’s work space at the Penitentiary is loud, and\n“sometimes it’s hard to hear someone there because it’s so loud.” Al-Zubaidy did not\nmake any other complaints at this meeting.\n\n       On May 2, Al-Zubaidy filed a charge of discrimination with the Nebraska\nEqual Opportunity Commission (NEOC), alleging discrimination based on race,\ncolor, sex, religion and national origin. In this administrative charge of\ndiscrimination, Al-Zubaidy made a number of allegations: (1) in June 2000, Unger\ntold another inmate, “don’t listen to dumb ass [Al-Zubaidy], he thinks he knows\neverything”; (2) in August 2000, Unger sprinkled water on Al-Zubaidy, and said,\n“bless you my child”; (3) in November 2000, Al-Zubaidy jokingly told another\nemployee TEK was going to serve “boiled eggs” for the holiday meal, which\nprompted Unger to say, “did you hear what [Al-Zubaidy] just said? he said boiled\ndick”; (4) in January 2001, Unger told Al-Zubaidy to “go to the bathroom . . . to clean\n[his] underwear” after a near collision in the workplace; (5) in March 2001, Unger\ntold another employee she “didn’t understand a single word [Al-Zubaidy] just said”;\nand (6) Unger tried to get Al-Zubaidy discharged.\n\n      In August 2001, Unger promoted Al-Zubaidy to the skilled position of die\nmaker. Even though Al-Zubaidy failed the first test for this position, which usually\neliminates the opportunity to work as a die maker, Unger allowed Al-Zubaidy to\nretake the test, which he passed.\n\n                                         -3-\n\f      Also in August 2001, the NEOC dismissed Al-Zubaidy’s discrimination\ncharge. Noting “[t]he Nebraska Attorney General has issued opinion #99-027 that\nprison laborers are not employees under the [NFEPA],” the NEOC administratively\nclosed the case because it lacked jurisdiction over Al-Zubaidy’s charge.2 The Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Commission also dismissed Al-Zubaidy’s charge, and\nissued its Notice of Suit Rights.\n\n       After filing a Complaint and an Amended Complaint in the district court, Al-\nZubaidy filed a twenty-three page (excluding attachments) pro se Second Amended\nComplaint for Civil Rights Violations against TEK and Unger, presenting nine causes\nof action. Al-Zubaidy alleged TEK and Unger violated Title VII, the NFEPA, and\nfederal and state civil rights statutes. Al-Zubaidy claimed TEK and Unger\nintentionally discriminated against him based on his race, sex, religion and national\norigin. Al-Zubaidy’s theories of recovery included discriminatory discharge,\nunlawful harassment and retaliation. An inmate laborer filed an affidavit claiming\nUnger told him in April 2001 “to report to our Camel Jockey, he will show you how\nto ride the Camel.” Another inmate laborer filed an affidavit swearing Unger set up\nAl-Zubaidy “by making it appear as though he was responsible for missing tools[,\neven though] Unger knew that the tools belonged to someone else.” Another inmate\n\n\n      2\n       Responding to a question posed by the NEOC’s Executive Director,\nNebraska’s Attorney General asked “whether prison inmates working for a private\nventure [i.e., TEK] located at the Nebraska State Penitentiary are considered\n‘employees’ under the meaning of the [NFEPA].” Neb. Att’y Gen. Op., No. 99027,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">395096</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1 (June 7, 1999). Acknowledging it was unclear how Nebraska\ncourts would respond to the question, the Attorney General turned to federal cases\ndefining the term “employee,” a Nebraska Worker’s Compensation case addressing\nthe employment status of an inmate, and Nebraska cases discussing principles\ngoverning the employment relationship. Id. at *1-5. After reviewing the principles\nenunciated in those contexts, the Attorney General concluded Nebraska courts would\ndetermine inmates are not employees under the NFEPA. Id. at *5.\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fsubmitted an affidavit stating “a homemade key was alleged to have been found” on\nOctober 23, 2001, and attributed to Al-Zubaidy. As a result of the discovery of this\ncontraband, the Penitentiary placed Al-Zubaidy in segregation, which resulted in Al-\nZubaidy’s discharge from TEK for excessive absences. Al-Zubaidy admitted he does\nnot have any evidence that Unger set him up.\n\n       Granting summary judgment to TEK and Unger on all claims, the district court\ndismissed Al-Zubaidy’s Second Amended Complaint with prejudice. First, the\ndistrict court relied on the Nebraska Attorney General’s opinion to hold Al-Zubaidy’s\n“claims pursuant to NFEPA must be dismissed because under Nebraska law, prison\nlaborers are not ‘employees’ entitled to redress under NFEPA.” Second, the district\ncourt dismissed Al-Zubaidy’s discriminatory discharge claims because “the summary\njudgment record contains no evidence on which a jury could reasonably find that [Al-\nZubaidy]’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin played any part in the decision\nto terminate [Al-Zubaidy]’s employment.” Finally, the district court dismissed Al-\nZubaidy’s hostile work environment claims, concluding (1) most of the remarks made\nagainst Al-Zubaidy “bore no relation to [his] gender, religion, race or national\norigin”; and (2) “the alleged harassment ‘was not so severe or pervasive as to alter a\nterm, condition, or privilege of [Al-Zubaidy’s] employment.’”\n\n       Al-Zubaidy appeals the district court’s grant of summary judgment to TEK and\nUnger. Al-Zubaidy contends the district court erroneously dismissed the\n(1) discriminatory discharge claims; (2) hostile work environment claims;\n(3) derivative civil rights claims; and (4) NFEPA claims. Al-Zubaidy does not appeal\nthe district court’s dismissal of Al-Zubaidy’s retaliation claims, and his attorney\nacknowledged at oral argument Al-Zubaidy has abandoned those claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fII.    DISCUSSION\n       A.    Standard of Review\n       We review de novo the district court’s grant of summary judgment to TEK and\nUnger. Mayer v. Nextel West Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780760\"><a href=\"/opinion/780760/gary-mayer-v-nextel-west-corporation-a-delaware-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">803</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 806 (8th Cir. 2003). Summary\njudgment is proper if the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Al-Zubaidy\nand giving him the benefit of all reasonable inferences, shows there are no genuine\nissues of material fact and TEK and Unger are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\nSee id.; Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). “Evidence, not contentions, avoids summary\njudgment.” Mayer, 318 F.3d at 809.\n\n      B.     Discriminatory Discharge\n      Title VII prohibits an employer from discharging an individual “because of\nsuch individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e-2(a)(1). Al-Zubaidy claims TEK did not discharge him because of his\nexcessive absences, but instead discharged him based on his race, sex, religion and\nnational origin.\n\n       Al-Zubaidy’s discriminatory discharge claims must be analyzed under the\nMcDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. Elmahdi v. Marriott Hotel Servs.,\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783088\"><a href=\"/opinion/783088/shareif-elmahdi-v-marriott-hotel-services-inc-a-delaware-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">645</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 656 (8th Cir. 2003) (citing McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 802-03 (1973)). Under this framework, Al-Zubaidy must establish a\nprima facie case of discrimination by showing (1) he is a member of a protected class,\n(2) he was qualified for his position with TEK, and (3) despite being qualified, he was\ndischarged. Id. If Al-Zubaidy successfully establishes his prima facie case, a\nrebuttable presumption of discrimination arises. Id. At this point, the burden of\nproduction shifts to TEK and Unger to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory\nreason for discharging Al-Zubaidy. Id. If TEK and Unger articulate such a reason,\nthe presumption of discrimination disappears, and Al-Zubaidy must prove the\nproffered reason for the discharge was merely a pretext for intentional discrimination.\nId. Even though we use the McDonnell Douglas test as a tool to uncover intentional\n\n                                         -6-\n\fdiscrimination, Al-Zubaidy never loses the ultimate burden of proving TEK and\nUnger intentionally discriminated against him. See id.\n\n       We agree with the district court that Al-Zubaidy failed to establish a\nsubmissible claim of discriminatory discharge. We initially conclude Al-Zubaidy\nfailed to establish a prima facie case because he was not qualified for his position at\nthe time he was discharged–he was unable to work at all. Regardless of the status of\nAl-Zubaidy’s prima facie case, however, TEK and Unger contend they discharged Al-\nZubaidy for excessive absences, which constitute a legitimate, nondiscriminatory\nreason for discharge. Given this proffered reason for discharge, Al-Zubaidy bears the\nburden of showing this reason was a pretext for intentional discrimination. To this\nend, Al-Zubaidy contends Unger connived to set him up so she could discharge him\nbased on his race, sex, religion and national origin. No reasonable inference can\nestablish these claims. First, Al-Zubaidy presented no evidence, other than mere\ncontentions, that Unger set him up to discharge him. Second, the record defies these\ncontentions. Unger consistently gave Al-Zubaidy favorable evaluations, which\nresulted in two wage increases. In August 2001, when Al-Zubaidy tested for the\nposition of die maker but failed the test, Unger ignored TEK’s policy and allowed Al-\nZubaidy to retake the test. When Al-Zubaidy used Unger’s opportunity and passed\nthe test, Unger promoted Al-Zubaidy to die maker. This evidence does not allow a\nreasonable inference that Unger plotted to discharge Al-Zubaidy based on his race,\nsex, religion or national origin.\n\n      On appeal, Al-Zubaidy attempts to recast his discriminatory discharge claim\nas a failure-to-rehire claim. Al-Zubaidy did not file an administrative charge of\ndiscrimination based on TEK’s failure to rehire him, and he failed to argue this theory\nbefore the district court. A discriminatory failure-to-rehire claim is wholly distinct\nfrom a discriminatory discharge claim, and both claims must be administratively\nexhausted before a federal court has jurisdiction over the claims.

Boeing\nCo., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789417\"><a href=\"/opinion/789417/peter-j-shelton-v-the-boeing-company-gkn-aerospace-north-america-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">909</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 913 (8th Cir. 2005). Furthermore, it has long been the general rule\n\n                                         -7-\n\f“that a federal appellate court does not consider an issue not passed upon below,”\nSingleton v.

Therefore, we decline\nAl-Zubaidy’s invitation to allow a failure-to-rehire claim to proceed.3\n\n       C.     Hostile Work Environment\n       Title VII also prohibits an employer from subjecting its employees to a hostile\nwork environment “because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national\norigin.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1); see, e.g., Nat’l R.R.

To establish a hostile work\nenvironment claim, Al-Zubaidy must show (1) he is a member of a protected class,\n(2) he was subjected to unwelcome harassment, (3) the harassment was based on a\nprotected characteristic under Title VII, (4) the harassment affected a term, condition\nor privilege of employment, and (5) employer liability. See generally Willis v.\nHenderson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774637\"><a href=\"/opinion/774637/oliver-c-willis-v-william-j-henderson-postmaster-general-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">801</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 808 (8th Cir. 2001). There can be no doubt federal\n\n\n      3\n        To the extent Al-Zubaidy claims TEK’s failure to rehire him proves its\nproffered reason for discharging him (i.e., excessive absences) was pretextual, we\nreject this late argument. Nothing in the record indicates TEK would not have\ndischarged Al-Zubaidy based on excessive absences. The only evidence that could\nassist Al-Zubaidy with this new argument is an affidavit filed by an inmate who stated\nhe was rehired after the reasons for his discharge were deemed unfounded. However,\nthis bare-bones affidavit does not explain that inmate’s race, color, religion or\nnational origin such that we could determine whether he is similarly situated to Al-\nZubaidy, nor does the affidavit explain any of the circumstances surrounding the\ninmate’s discharge or rehiring. Thus, no reasonable inferences can be gleaned from\nthe inmate’s affidavit to establish TEK discharged Al-Zubaidy based on his race, sex,\nreligion or national origin.\n\n                                           -8-\n\fharassment standards are demanding.

The Supreme Court also\nhas made it abundantly clear that the “standards for judging hostility are sufficiently\ndemanding to ensure that Title VII does not become a ‘general civility code.’” Id.\n(citation omitted).\n\n       Title VII is violated only “[w]hen the workplace is permeated with\n‘discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult,’ that is ‘sufficiently severe or\npervasive to alter the conditions of the victim’s employment and create an abusive\nworking environment.’” Harris v.

Bank, 477 U.S. at 65, 67). We can determine “whether an environment\nis ‘hostile’ or ‘abusive’ . . . only by looking at all the circumstances[, which] may\ninclude the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is\nphysically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it\nunreasonably interferes with an employee’s work performance.” Id. at 23.\n\n       The Supreme Court has cautioned courts to be alert for workplace behavior that\ndoes not rise to the level of actionable harassment. For example, “Title VII does not\nprohibit ‘genuine but innocuous differences in the ways men and women routinely\ninteract.’” Faragher, 524 U.S. at 788 (quoting Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs.,\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118181\"><a href=\"/opinion/118181/oncale-v-sundowner-offshore-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 81 (1998)). The Court often has made the point that “‘simple\nteasing,’ offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not\namount to discriminatory changes in the ‘terms and conditions of employment.’” Id.\n(quoting Oncale, 523 U.S. at 82). The Court implores lower courts to apply the\ndemanding harassment standards to “filter out complaints attacking ‘the ordinary\ntribulations of the workplace, such as the sporadic use of abusive language,\ngender-related jokes, and occasional teasing.’” Id. (citation omitted).\n\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f       We conclude the district court appropriately dismissed Al-Zubaidy’s hostile\nwork environment claims because his workplace at the Penitentiary was not\npermeated with severe or pervasive harassment sufficient to alter the terms,\nconditions or privileges of employment. Al-Zubaidy produced only a few comments\nUnger allegedly made over a ten-month period. Most of these offhand and isolated\ncomments were wholly unrelated to each other and had a tenuous connection to race,\nsex, religion or national origin. Unger’s comments were infrequent, were not severe,\nnever physically threatened Al-Zubaidy, were more akin to mere offensive utterances,\nand did not interfere with Al-Zubaidy’s work performance. Indeed, Al-Zubaidy even\nreceived pay raises and a promotion both before and after Unger made these\ncomments. Al-Zubaidy’s evidence falls far short of the Supreme Court’s demanding\nharassment standards.\n\n       D.     Civil Rights Claims\n       In a one-paragraph argument in his brief, Al-Zubaidy explicitly ties the fate of\nhis federal and state civil rights claims to his success on his Title VII claims. Because\nwe hold the district court properly dismissed Al-Zubaidy’s Title VII claims, we\nlikewise conclude Al-Zubaidy’s derivative civil rights claims lack merit.\n\n        E.    NFEPA\n        Finally, Al-Zubaidy argues the district court mistakenly relied on the Nebraska\nAttorney General’s opinion in dismissing Al-Zubaidy’s claims under the NFEPA. Al-\nZubaidy maintains the district court should not have dismissed the NFEPA claims,\nbut rather should “have certified the question [of whether TEK’s prison laborers are\nemployees under the NFEPA] to the Nebraska Supreme Court, or, at the very least,\ndismissed the claim without prejudice if it declined to exercise jurisdiction in view\nof its dismissal of the other claims.”\n\n      Similar to Title VII, the NFEPA prohibits an employer from discharging or\nharassing an individual “because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex,\n\n                                          -10-\n\fdisability, marital status, or national origin.” Neb. Rev. Stat. § 48-1104(1). Both the\nNebraska Supreme Court and our court have stated the NFEPA “is patterned after\nTitle VII,” and, therefore, “it is appropriate to consider federal court decisions\nconstruing the federal legislation” when considering questions under the NFEPA.\nCity of Fort Calhoun v.

Its importance is\nunderscored by the NEOC’s written request to the Nebraska Attorney General asking\nfor an answer to this consequential question. However, the posture of this case\ndissuades us from offering what would amount to a gratuitous analysis of whether the\nAttorney General rightly decided whether an inmate working for TEK at the\nPenitentiary is an employee under the NFEPA. Al-Zubaidy’s state claims under the\nNFEPA mirrored his federal claims under Title VII, and his discrimination and\nharassment claims under Title VII failed. Therefore, Al-Zubaidy would enjoy no\ngreater success with those same claims under the NFEPA.\n\n       Similarly, Al-Zubaidy’s retaliation claim under Title VII was dismissed, and\nAl-Zubaidy failed to appeal that dismissal or even discuss the retaliation claim in\neither his initial brief or in his reply brief. At oral argument, Al-Zubaidy\nacknowledged he has abandoned his Title VII retaliation claim. Therefore, we deem\nAl-Zubaidy’s failure to raise the retaliation claim amounts to an abandonment of that\nclaim. Jasperson v. Purolator Courier Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"454336\"><a href=\"/opinion/454336/linda-jasperson-appellantcross-appellee-v-purolator-courier-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">765</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">736</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 740 (8th Cir. 1985). The\nfailure of Al-Zubaidy’s Title VII retaliation claim likewise dooms his retaliation\nclaim under the NFEPA.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fIII. CONCLUSION\n     For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court’s grant of summary\njudgment in favor of TEK and Unger.\n                      ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f</pre>",
