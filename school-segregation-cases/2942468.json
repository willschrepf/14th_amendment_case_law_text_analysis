By seven issues, which we re-organize as five, Border\n\fStates Electric Supply argues that the trial court erred:    (1) in rendering a take-nothing\n\njudgment against it because the evidence at trial established that appellees, Enriquez\n\nEnterprises, Inc. and Gilbert Enriquez, were liable under the Texas Construction Trust\n\nFund Act or an implied contract theory of recovery; (2) in issuing factual findings which\n\nwere against the overwhelming weight and preponderance of the evidence; (3) in failing\n\nto admit certain business records; (4) in failing to award attorney’s fees; and (5) in failing\n\nto grant a motion for continuance.\n\n       By one cross-issue, cross-appellant/appellee Coast to Coast Electric, LLC asserts\n\nthat the trial court erred because appellant’s claims were barred by principles of\n\npreclusion.\n\n       We affirm, in part, and reverse and remand, in part.\n\n                                      I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Border States Electric Supply (“Border States”) is a supplier of electrical equipment\n\nfor construction projects.     Coast to Coast Electric, LLC (“Coast”) is an electrical\n\ncontractor owned by Carlos Mendiola, Gilbert Enriquez, and Jaime Enriquez.          Enriquez\n\nEnterprises, Inc. (“EEI”) is a general contractor owned by Guadalupe Enriquez, Gilbert\n\nand Jaime Enriquez’s father. EEI’s chief financial officer is Gilbert Enriquez.\n\n       In February 2007, Coast opened a credit account with Border States to obtain\n\nelectrical equipment for several construction jobs:      (1) a Donna Independent School\n\nDistrict project; (2) the Edinburg Consolidated Independent School District Ebony project;\n\n(3) a Hidalgo Independent School District project; (4) a Sharyland Independent School\n\nDistrict project; and (5) the Bob Gastell warehouse project. Although Coast only had\n\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fone line of credit with Border States, it assigned different account numbers to each project\n\nto ensure that funds were not commingled. Mendiola signed as a personal guarantor for\n\nCoast’s line of credit.\n\n        The evidence shows that Coast paid for most of the equipment purchased from\n\nBorder States.      Border States claims, however, that several “over the counter”\n\npurchases were not paid.      These “over the counter” purchases were picked up and\n\nsigned for by persons allegedly working for Coast.        On April 23, 2008, Border States\n\nsued Coast for the items allegedly not paid for in the Donna ISD project (the “First Suit”).\n\nLater, on June 19, 2008, Border States filed a second lawsuit against Coast for the items\n\nnot paid for in the remaining projects (the “Second Suit”).    The parties settled the First\n\nSuit. The First Suit’s settlement agreement provided that:\n\n        This release specifically does not release any claims that [Border States]\n        has in Cause No. CL-08, 136-D, styled Border States Electric Supply of\n        Texas, Inc. v. Coast to Coast, LLC and Carlos Mendiola . . . and does not\n        preclude the Court in said suit from sustaining any legally sufficient claims\n        of [Border States] or legally sufficient defenses asserted by Coast whether\n        substantive or procedural.\n\n        After the First Suit settled, the parties subsequently went to trial on the Second\n\nSuit.   After a bench trial in the Second Suit, the trial court ordered that Coast and\n\nMendiola, jointly and severally, owed Border States $30,228.94 at the rate of 5% per\n\nannum until paid. The trial court ordered, however, that Border States could take nothing\n\nagainst EEI, Gilbert Enriquez, or Jaime Enriquez.      Finally, the trial court ordered that\n\neach party was responsible for its own attorney’s fees.    Border States requested that the\n\ntrial court issue findings of fact and conclusions of law, and the trial court did so. This\n\nappeal then ensued.\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f                                II. PRINCIPLES OF PRECLUSION\n\n        We will first address cross-appellant/appellee Coast’s cross-issue because it could\n\nbe dispositive of this entire appeal.     See TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1.    Coast contends that\n\nBorder States’s unpaid invoices on the Edinburg, Hidalgo, and Sharyland school projects,\n\nas well as the Gastell warehouse project, should have been raised in the First Suit\n\nbecause they were all due and payable on April 23, 2008, the day the First Suit was filed.\n\nAccordingly, Coast argues that the underlying lawsuit that is the basis for this appeal is\n\nbarred by the principles of preclusion, or res judicata.\n\n        “Claims preclusion prevents the relitigation of a claim or cause of action that has\n\nbeen finally adjudicated, as well as related matters that, with the use of diligence, should\n\nhave been litigated in the prior suit.”   Barr v. Resolution Trust Corp. ex rel. Sunbelt Fed.\n\nSav., 837 S.W.2d 627, 628 (Tex. 1992) (citing Gracia v. RC Cola-7-Up Bottling Co., 667\n\nS.W.2d 517, 519 (Tex. 1984)).       “Claim preclusion prevents splitting a cause of action.”\n\nId.   “The policies behind the doctrine reflect the need to bring all litigation to an end,\n\nprevent vexatious litigation, maintain stability of court decisions, promote judicial\n\neconomy, and prevent double recovery.”        Id.   The Texas Supreme Court has adopted\n\na “transactional approach” to claims preclusion and has outlined three factors to\n\ndetermine whether claims arise from the same transaction:         (1) if the claims relate in\n\ntime, space, origin, or motivation; (2) whether they form a convenient trial unit; and (3)\n\nwhether their treatment as a trial unit conforms to the parties’ expectations or business\n\npractices.   Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f       We recognize that Coast only applied for one line of credit with Border States and\n\nthat Coast, on its own, assigned individual numbers to each job location for the sake of\n\nrecordkeeping.    The fact that these debts arise from one line of credit supports the first\n\n“transactional approach” factor that these claims were related in origin and motivation.\n\nSee id. We also acknowledge that resolution of these claims in one lawsuit would form\n\na convenient trial unit, as posited by the second “transactional approach” factor.   See id.\n\n       However, there is evidence that weighs against a finding that these claims were\n\npart of one “transaction.” For example, Coast’s numerous unpaid-for “over the counter”\n\npurchases involved different types of electrical equipment for different construction\n\nprojects throughout South Texas at different times.        See id.   This evidence weighs\n\nagainst a finding of the first “transactional approach” factor that the purchases were\n\nsimilar in time or space.   Most persuasive, however, is the fact that there is no evidence\n\nof the third “transactional approach” factor:   the parties did not expect these claims to be\n\nlitigated as a single trial unit. The First Suit’s settlement agreement provided that the\n\nrelease “specifically [did] not release any claims that [Border States] [had] in Cause No.\n\nCL-08, 136-D.” Coast openly and voluntarily signed a settlement agreement in the First\n\nSuit whereby it recognized that Border States’s outstanding claims in the Second Suit\n\nwere preserved in a different cause number, as well as their own legal defenses.\n\n       After considering the evidence, we disagree with Coast that Border States’s claims\n\nfor the Edinburg, Hidalgo, and Sharyland schools and the Gastell warehouse project were\n\npart of the same “transaction” as the Donna ISD claims and therefore precluded by the\n\nFirst Suit. We overrule Coast’s cross-issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\f                                 III. RECOVERY OF DAMAGES\n\n       We now turn to Border States’s first issue. Border States contends the trial court\n\nerred in not finding EEI and Gilbert Enriquez liable to Border States under the Texas\n\nConstruction Trust Fund Act or an implied contract theory of recovery. We construe this\n\nissue as a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict.\n\nA.     Applicable Law\n\n       When a party attacks the legal sufficiency of an adverse finding on an issue on\n\nwhich it has the burden of proof, it must demonstrate on appeal that the evidence\n\nestablishes, as a matter of law, all vital facts in support of the issue.   Dow Chemical Co.\n\nv. Francis, 46 S.W.3d 237, 241 (Tex. 2001); see Sterner v. Marathon Oil Co., 767 S.W.2d\n\n686, 690 (Tex. 1989); W. Wendell Hall, Standards of Review in Texas, 29 ST. MARY'S L.J.\n\n351, 481–82 (1998). In reviewing a “matter of law” challenge, the reviewing court must\n\nfirst examine the record for evidence that supports the finding, while ignoring all evidence\n\nto the contrary.   Dow Chemical, 46 S.W.3d at 241; Sterner, 767 S.W.2d at 690.        If there\n\nis no evidence to support the finding, the reviewing court will then examine the entire\n\nrecord to determine if the contrary proposition is established as a matter of law.      Dow\n\nChemical, 46 S.W.3d at 241; Sterner, 767 S.W.2d at 690; Hall, supra, at 482. The point\n\nof error should be sustained only if the contrary proposition is conclusively established.\n\nDow Chemical, 46 S.W.3d at 241 (citing Croucher v. Croucher, 660 S.W.2d 55, 58 (Tex.\n\n1983)).\n\n       When a party attacks the factual sufficiency of an adverse finding on an issue on\n\nwhich it has the burden of proof, it must demonstrate on appeal that the adverse finding\n\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\fis against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence.           Dow Chemical, 46\n\nS.W.3d at 242; Croucher, 660 S.W.2d at 58.         The appellate court must consider and\n\nweigh all of the evidence, and can set aside a verdict only if the evidence is so weak or if\n\nthe finding is so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence that it is\n\nclearly wrong and unjust.   See Pool v. Ford Motor Co., 715 S.W.2d 629, 635 (Tex. 1986).\n\nIn doing so, the court of appeals must “detail the evidence relevant to the issue” and “state\n\nin what regard the contrary evidence greatly outweighs the evidence in support of the\n\nverdict.” Pool, 715 S.W.2d at 635.\n\n        The fact finder is the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight\n\nto give their testimony. City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 819 (Tex. 2005).       The\n\nfact finder may choose to believe one witness and disbelieve another.          Id.   Reviewing\n\ncourts cannot impose their own opinions to the contrary.      Id.   “Courts reviewing all the\n\nevidence in a light favorable to the verdict thus assume that jurors credited testimony\n\nfavorable to the verdict and disbelieved testimony contrary to it.”      Id.    “For example,\n\nviewing the evidence in the light favorable to the verdict means that if . . . the parties to\n\nan oral contract testify to conflicting terms, a reviewing court must presume the terms\n\nwere those asserted by the winner.”     Id.\n\nB.      The Texas Construction Fund Act\n\n        The Texas Construction Fund Act is found in chapter 162 of the Texas Property\n\nCode.    See TEX. PROP. CODE ANN. §§ 162.001–.033 (West, Westlaw through 2013 3d\n\nC.S.). This act “imposes fiduciary responsibilities on contractors to ensure that Texas\n\nsubcontractors, mechanics, and materialmen are paid for work completed.”                 In re\n\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fWaterpoint Int'l LLC, 330 F.3d 339, 345 (5th Cir. 2003).          This statute provides that\n\nconstruction payments are trust funds if the payments are made to a contractor or to an\n\nofficer of the contractor for the improvement of specific real property.    Id. § 162.001(a);\n\nsee also Kelly v. Gen’l Interior Const. Inc., 262 S.W.3d 79, 85 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th\n\nDist.]), overruled on other grounds, 301 S.W.3d 653 (Tex. 2010).           The contractor or\n\nofficer who receives the trust funds is considered a trustee of the funds.          TEX. PROP.\n\nCODE ANN. § 162.002. The artisan, laborer, mechanic, contractor, subcontractor, or\n\nmaterialman who furnished labor or material for the construction or repair on the real\n\nproperty is considered the beneficiary of any trust funds.    Id. § 162.003. A trustee who\n\nintentionally, knowingly, or with the intent to defraud, directly or indirectly retains, uses,\n\ndisburses, or otherwise diverts the funds without first fully paying current or past due\n\nobligations has misapplied the trust funds.       See id. § 162.031(a). “Thus, a party who\n\nmisapplies these trust funds is subject to civil liability if (1) the party breaches the duty\n\nimposed by chapter 162, (2) with the requisite scienter, and (3) the claimants are within\n\nthe class of people chapter 162 was designed to protect and have asserted the type of\n\ninjury chapter 162 was intended to prohibit.”     C & G, Inc. v. Jones, 165 S.W.3d 450, 453\n\n(Tex. App.—Dallas 2005, pet. denied).         Any officer or director who has control or\n\ndirection over the funds is also a trustee of the funds and is personally liable.   Id. at 453–\n\n54.\n\n       Border States argues that EEI was a “contractor” and Gilbert Enriquez was an\n\n“officer” under chapter 162 and that they as “trustees” intentionally defrauded Border\n\nStates as a beneficiary of its rightful trust funds when they failed to fully pay it for\n\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\fequipment.     At trial, Gilbert Enriquez, Chief Financial Officer of EEI and a one-third\n\nowner of Coast, testified that Coast had a post office box where all of its bills were\n\nreceived.    He stated that only Mendiola had a key to this post office box.     He explained\n\nthat Mendiola “gathered all the invoices together,” had a secretary put them into a binder\n\nfor reviewing purposes, and then both men would decide which bills to pay on behalf of\n\nCoast.     In other words, Gilbert only saw the invoices that were provided to him by\n\nMendiola.\n\n         Gilbert performed the same bill-paying functions for EEI.      He agreed that in one\n\npart of his week he paid the bills for EEI, the general contractor on these projects, and\n\nthen later in the week, he helped Mendiola decide which bills to pay for Coast, the\n\nsubcontractor.     Despite the fact that Gilbert worked for both the contractor and\n\nsubcontractor on these projects, there is no specific evidence in the record about the\n\ncompensation EEI received for any of the four projects at issue.        See TEX. PROP. CODE\n\nANN. § 162.001(a) (discussing that construction payments are “trust funds” if the\n\npayments are made to a contractor). The only invoices in evidence were invoices from\n\nBorder States to Coast.     In other words, there was no evidence about the amount of\n\nmoney the school districts or Bob Gastell owed or paid directly to EEI.         Further, there\n\nwas no evidence that either EEI or Gilbert Enriquez acted knowingly or intentionally to\n\ndefraud Border States out of payment, especially given the fact that Gilbert said he could\n\nonly pay the bills Mendiola provided to him.       Id. § 162.031(a) (setting forth the mens rea\n\nrequirement for this statute to apply).\n\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\f      Border States urges us to follow Choy v. Graziano Roofing of Texas to find both\n\nEEI and Gilbert Enriquez liable under the Texas Construction Fund Act. 322 S.W.3d\n\n276 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2009, no pet.). In Choy, the trial court found Andrew\n\nChoy, the president of Windwater Homes, L.L.C., a home construction company,\n\npersonally liable for failing to pay a roofing company, Graziano Roofing of Texas, for\n\nroofing materials and labor on thirty-nine residential properties.        Id. at 280.   The\n\nevidence established that Windwater obtained construction loans from Citibank of Texas\n\nand Frost National Bank to finance the construction of these properties.        Id. At trial,\n\nChoy testified that he was President of Windwater, he signed all final checks for the\n\ncompany, and “knew that Graziano and other contractors did not get paid for work they\n\nhad completed.”    Id. at 281.   Choy testified that it was “possible” that some of the\n\nconstruction loan proceeds meant for Graziano Roofing were diverted overseas to\n\nWindwater’s owner.    Id.   The trial court concluded that Choy was a “trustee” under the\n\nAct who misapplied Windwater Homes’s “trust funds” from a construction loan and\n\nentered a final judgment against him personally for $131,796.09.    Id.\n\n      The Choy case is easily distinguished from the underlying case in one key way:\n\nChoy had documents in evidence that showed the amount of funds the banks released\n\nto Windwater for roofing supplies.   Id. at 280.   The record showed that when Citibank,\n\nfor example, received a request, a Citibank inspector would visit the property at issue and\n\ndocument “that whatever item was being billed at that time was complete.”      Id.   No such\n\nevidence existed here. The only business records that were in evidence were invoices\n\nfrom Border States to Coast; there was no evidence regarding the amount of funds the\n\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\fschool districts or Bob Gastell paid to EEI for electrical equipment.   See TEX. PROP. CODE\n\nANN. § 162.001(a).       Furthermore, there was no evidence that Gilbert Enriquez\n\nintentionally, knowingly, or with the intent to defraud, kept funds from Border States,\n\nwhereas Choy testified that it was “possible” that some of the construction loan proceeds\n\nmeant for Graziano Roofing were diverted overseas.         See Choy, 322 S.W.3d at 281.\n\n       In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the evidence supports the trial court’s\n\nholding that there was no violation of the Texas Construction Trust Act.          See Dow\n\nChemical, 46 S.W.3d at 241.      Border States did not meet its burden in establishing that\n\neither EEI or Gilbert Enriquez had “trust funds” or that the requisite scienter existed to\n\nmeet the elements of this claim.    See TEX. PROP. CODE ANN. §§ 162.001(a), 162.031(a).\n\nFurther, we hold that this finding is not so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the\n\nevidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust. Pool, 715 S.W.2d at 635.\n\nC.     Implied Contract Theory of Recovery\n\n       Border States also contends that the trial court should have found that EEI and\n\nGilbert Enriquez were liable under an implied contract theory of recovery.    “It is said that\n\nthe distinction between an express contract and one implied in fact is that the former\n\narises when the contractual terms are stated by the parties; and that the latter arises from\n\nthe acts and conduct of the parties, it being implied from the facts and circumstances that\n\nthere was a mutual intention to contract.”        Haws & Garrett Gen. Contractors, Inc. v.\n\nGorbett Bros. Welding Co., 480 S.W.2d 607, 609 (Tex. 1972).\n\n       While the evidence is clear that a contractual relationship existed between Border\n\nStates and Coast, it is not as clear that a contract existed between Border States and\n\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\fEEI, and less so between Border States and Gilbert Enriquez individually.     Border States\n\npoints to no evidence, and we find none, demonstrating “facts or circumstances that\n\ndemonstrate a mutual intention to contract” with either EEI or Gilbert Enriquez.     See id.\n\nBorder States’s line of credit and dealings were primarily with Coast and Mendiola, and\n\nBorder States ultimately received a judgment against these two defendants.\n\n       The evidence supports the trial court’s finding that Border States did not have an\n\nimplied contract with either EEI or with Gilbert Enriquez.   See Dow Chemical, 46 S.W.3d\n\nat 241.   Further, we hold that this conclusion is not so contrary to the overwhelming\n\nweight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust.     Pool, 715 S.W.2d at 635.\n\n       We overrule Border States’s first issue.\n\n                    IV.     FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\n       By its second issue, Border States argues that the trial court’s factual findings were\n\nagainst the overwhelming weight and preponderance of the evidence.\n\nA.     Applicable Law\n\n       “A trial court's findings of fact are reviewed for factual sufficiency of the evidence\n\nunder the same legal standards as applied to review jury verdicts for factual sufficiency\n\nof the evidence.”    Ortiz v. Jones, 917 S.W.2d 770, 772 (Tex. 1996) (citing Anderson v.\n\nCity of Seven Points, 806 S.W.2d 791, 794 (Tex. 1991)).            “In reviewing a factual\n\nsufficiency point, the court of appeals must weigh all of the evidence in the record.” Id.;\n\nsee Burnett v. Motyka, 610 S.W.2d 735, 736 (Tex. 1980).        Findings may be overturned\n\nonly if they are so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to be\n\nclearly wrong and unjust.   Cain v. Bain, 709 S.W.2d 175, 176 (Tex. 1986). In reviewing\n\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fthe record and evidence, the appellate court must “clearly state why the jury's finding is\n\nfactually insufficient or is so against the great weight and preponderance as to be\n\nmanifestly unjust.”      Ortiz, 917 S.W.2d at 772.\n\nB.     The Texas Construction Fund Act\n\n       The trial court made the following findings of fact regarding Border States’s\n\nassertion that EEI and Gilbert Enriquez violated the Texas Construction Fund Act:\n\n       4.        Plaintiff proved that materials in the amount of $30,228.94 were\n                 delivered to representatives of Coast by Border.\n\n       5.        Plaintiff failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the\n                 materials sold by Border and delivered to Coast, were ever received\n                 by Enriquez Defendants[ 1 ] or were incorporated into Enriquez\n                 Defendants[’] projects.\n\n       6.        Plaintiff failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the\n                 materials Border sued on were delivered to Enriquez Defendants.\n\n       7.        Plaintiff failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that,\n                 assuming the existence of trust funds, any defendant misapplied\n                 trust funds.\n\n       8.        Plaintiff failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that any\n                 defendant acted “intentionally or knowingly, or with intent to defraud.”\n\n       9.        Plaintiff failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that,\n                 assuming the existence of trust funds, any defendant directly or\n                 indirectly retained, used, disbursed, or otherwise diverted trust funds.\n\n       Weighing all of the evidence in the record (as detailed earlier in section III.B of this\n\nopinion), we cannot say that the trial court’s findings of fact regarding EEI and Gilbert\n\n\n\n\n       1   The trial court defined the “Enriquez Defendants” as EEI, Jaime Enriquez, and Gilbert Enriquez.\n\n\n\n                                                    13\n\fEnriquez’s liability “are so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence\n\nas to be clearly wrong and unjust.”   Cain, 709 S.W.2d at 176.\n\nB.    The Implied Contract Theory\n\n      Border States also challenged the trial court’s findings of fact regarding Border\n\nStates’s contract claims.   The relevant findings of fact follow:\n\n      1. Plaintiff proved by a preponderance of the evidence that a written\n         contract was executed between Border and Coast.\n\n      2. Plaintiff proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Mendiola\n         executed the contract between Border and Coast on behalf of Coast and\n         as a personal guarantor.\n\n      3. Plaintiff failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a\n         contract, in any form, existed between Border and any of the Enriquez\n         Defendants.\n\n      4. Plaintiff failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Border\n         expected payment from Enriquez Defendants.\n\n      5. Plaintiff failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that an\n         “offer” was made by Border to any of the Enrique Defendants.\n\n      6. Plaintiff failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that there\n         was an “acceptance” of any offer by the Enriquez Defendants.\n\n      7. Plaintiff failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that there\n         was a “meeting of the minds” between Border and any of the Enriquez\n         Defendants.\n\n      8. Plaintiff failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the\n         Enriquez Defendants consented to the terms of any agreement with\n         Border.\n\n      9. Plaintiff failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that there\n         was an “execution and delivery of any contract between Border and any\n         of the Enriquez Defendants with the intent that it be mutual and binding.”\n\n      10. Plaintiff proved that materials in the amount of $30,228.94 were\n          delivered by Border to Coast, for which payment was not made.\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\f       Again, considering all of the evidence in the record (as detailed earlier in section\n\nIII.C of this opinion), we cannot say that the trial court’s findings of fact regarding EEI and\n\nGilbert Enriquez’s liability in an implied contract theory of recovery “are so against the\n\ngreat weight and preponderance of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust.”\n\nCain, 709 S.W.2d at 176. We overrule Border States’s second issue.\n\n                              V. THE EXCLUSION OF EVIDENCE\n\n       By its third issue, Border States argues that the trial court abused its discretion\n\nwhen it failed to admit certain business records.     Specifically, Border States complains\n\nthat the trial court erred when it failed to admit the invoices “because these documents\n\nwere adequately proven through the uncontested testimony of [Border States’s]\n\ncustodians of the business records who provided uncontradicted testimony regarding the\n\ntrustworthiness of said invoices and statements pursuant to Texas Rule of Evidence\n\n803(6).”\n\n       The admission of evidence is a matter within the trial court’s discretion.         See\n\nInterstate Northborough P’ship v. State, 66 S.W.3d 213, 220 (Tex. 2005); City of\n\nBrownsville v. Alvarado, 897 S.W.2d 750, 753 (Tex. 1995).           “To reverse a judgment\n\nbased on a claimed error in admitting or excluding evidence, a party must show that the\n\nerror probably resulted in an improper judgment.”        See Interstate Northborough, 897\n\nS.W.2d at 220 (quoting TEX. R. APP. P. 61.1); see also TEX. R. APP. P. 44.1(a). We\n\nreview the entire record to determine whether the excluded evidence led to an improper\n\njudgment.    Id.   Reversible error usually does not occur unless the appellant can\n\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\fdemonstrate that the judgment turns on the particular evidence excluded or admitted.\n\nId. (citing Tex. Dep’t of Transp. v. Able, 35 S.W.3d 608, 617 (Tex. 2000)).\n\n       At trial, the trial court heard inconsistent evidence regarding the excluded business\n\ninvoices.   Most of these invoices had the signature of Coast employee Joe Garcia, and\n\nGarcia gave conflicting testimony regarding these records.     First, Garcia testified that the\n\nsignatures on some of the invoices were not his. Later, when Garcia learned that the\n\nsignatures were written on an electronic signature pad, he stated that “there was a high\n\nprobability” that some of the signatures could be his. There were also a few invoices\n\nthat indicated that merchandise was “picked up by Joe Garcia” but then had the signature\n\nof other Coast employees.\n\n       The court, as the finder of fact, determined the credibility of the witnesses and the\n\nweight to be given their testimony.   See City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 820.     It was within\n\nthe province of the finder of fact to resolve conflicts in the evidence, id., and here, with\n\nGarcia’s wavering testimony and invoices showing conflicting information, the trial court\n\ndeemed the invoices untrustworthy.     In light of the foregoing, we cannot say that the trial\n\ncourt abused its discretion in excluding these invoices.   See Interstate Northborough, 66\n\nS.W.3d at 220.     Further, because Border States has not shown that the exclusion of\n\nthese invoices led to an improper judgment, we overrule this issue.      See TEX. R. APP. P.\n\n44.1(a); Interstate Northborough, 897 S.W.2d at 220.\n\n                     VI.    THE FAILURE TO AWARD ATTORNEY’S FEES\n\n       In its final judgment, the court ordered that “each party shall be responsible for its\n\nown attorney’s fees.” By its fourth issue, Border States complains that the trial court\n\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\fshould have awarded it attorney’s fees.    “In Texas, attorney’s fees may not be recovered\n\nfrom an opposing party unless such recovery is provided for by statute or by contract\n\nbetween the parties.”    Travelers Indem. Co. of Conn. v. Mayfield, 923 S.W.2d 590, 593\n\n(Tex. 1996). Here, Border States alleges that its attorney’s fees are recoverable under\n\nTexas Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 38.001, which sets forth that reasonable\n\nattorney’s fees may be awarded if the claim is for an oral or written contract.     See TEX.\n\nCIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 38.001(8) (West, Westlaw through 2013 3d C.S.).\n\n       Border States filed several causes of action against Coast and Mendiola, including\n\n(1) conversion, (2) quasi-contract, (3) unjust enrichment, (4) quantum meruit, (5) collateral\n\nestoppel, (6) violations of the Texas Construction Fund Act, (7) alter ego, and (8) breach\n\nof contract claims. Of these, Border States could only recover attorney’s fees from its\n\ncontract action, because its other claims were unsuccessful. At trial, Border States’s\n\nattorney William Kimball testified that he had practiced law in Texas for twenty-eight\n\nyears, specifically in complex commercial litigation cases; that his hourly rate was $225\n\nper hour; and that this fee was a reasonable and customary fee for attorneys with his\n\nexperience practicing law in south Texas.     A copy of his billing statements for this case\n\nwas entered into evidence. The billing statement revealed that Kimball billed $28,060.37\n\nin fees representing Border States in the underlying case.\n\n       In its findings of fact and conclusions of law, the trial court pointed out that Border\n\nStates failed to segregate its attorney’s fees for each of the claims asserted.      It noted\n\nthat “Plaintiff’s evidence of attorney’s fees included attorney’s fees incurred for the entire\n\ncase” and that “Plaintiff failed to provide any evidence of the amount of fees incurred on\n\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\fonly the contract claim against Coast.”       It held that a “trial court may refuse to award\n\nattorney’s fees in the absence of segregation.”\n\n          In Stewart Title Guaranty Company v. Sterling, the Texas Supreme Court held that\n\n“a plaintiff is required to show that attorney’s fees were incurred while suing the defendant\n\nsought to be charged with the fees on a claim which allows recovery of such fees.”          822\n\nS.W.2d 10, 11 (Tex. 1991) (emphasis added). However, the high court then recognized\n\nthe following exception:\n\n          A recognized exception to this duty to segregate arises when the attorney’s\n          fees rendered are in connection with claims arising out of the same\n          transaction and are so interrelated that their prosecution or defense entails\n          proof or denial of essentially the same facts.\n\nId. at 11. Border States, in its briefing, argues that this exception is applicable to its\n\ncase.     It contended that its attorney’s fees were generated in connection “with claims\n\narising out of the same transactions” and were so interrelated that their prosecution\n\nentailed proof of essentially the same facts.           However, although claims may be\n\n“dependent upon the same set of facts or circumstances . . . that does not mean they all\n\nrequired the same research, discovery, proof, or legal expertise.”        Tony Gullo Motors I,\n\nL.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 313 (Tex. 2007).\n\n          As previously set forth, we review findings of fact by weighing all of the evidence\n\nin the record.     Ortiz, 917 S.W.2d at 772.     We may only overturn a finding if it is so\n\nagainst the great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and\n\nunjust.     Cain, 709 S.W.2d at 176. In reviewing the record and evidence, the appellate\n\ncourt must clearly state why the factfinder’s “finding is factually insufficient or is so against\n\nthe great weight and preponderance as to be manifestly unjust.”           Ortiz, 917 S.W.2d at\n\n\n\n                                               18\n\f772.   Here, we acknowledge that the trial court found that Border States was successful\n\nin its breach of contract claim against Coast and Mendiola.        In light of this finding, and\n\nguided by the Tony Gullo Motors case, we conclude that Border States’s “failure to\n\nsegregate [its] attorney’s fees does not mean [it] cannot recover any.            Unsegregated\n\nattorney’s fees for the entire case are some evidence of what the segregated amount\n\nshould be.”   Tony Gullo Motors, Inc., 212 S.W.3d at 314. Accordingly, we sustain this\n\nissue and remand it back to the trial court. Under Tony Gullo Motors, it is not necessary\n\nfor Border States to create separate time records for the breach of contract claim.          Id.\n\nBorder States must, however, provide evidence testifying what percentage of time was\n\ndedicated solely to the successful breach of contract claim against Coast and Mendiola\n\nto be able to recoup these fees.     Id.\n\n                          VII.   THE MOTION FOR CONTINUANCE\n\n       In its fifth and final issue, with three sub-issues, Border States also argues that the\n\ntrial court erred in failing to grant a motion for continuance.     First, it contends the trial\n\ncourt did not give it the proper 45-day trial notice as required by Texas Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 245.     See TEX. R. CIV. P. 245. Second, Border States asserts that the trial\n\ncourt erred in failing to enter a level 3 scheduling order.   See id. R. 190.4.   Third, Border\n\nStates avers that the trial court’s failure to grant a continuance violated its due process\n\nrights. We address each sub-issue in turn.\n\nA.     Proper Notice\n\n       Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 245 provides that a court “may set contested\n\ncases . . . on the court’s own motion, with reasonable notice of not less than forty-five\n\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\fdays to the parties of a first setting for trial, or by agreement of the parties.”   TEX. R. CIV.\n\nP. 245.    At a pre-trial hearing on August 27, 2012, the trial court noted that this was a\n\n2008 case and suggested setting the case for trial on September 17, 2012. When the\n\ntrial court announced this, counsel for Border States replied, “Judge, all I need is just a\n\nlittle additional time just to get witness subpoenas out.” Later that day, Border States\n\nsubmitted a proposed order to the trial court setting trial for September 17, 2012.\n\nHowever, Coast filed an objection to the trial setting, asking for forty-five days’ notice as\n\nrequired by Rule 245.        Border States responded and “reluctantly agree[d] that a\n\ncontinuance [was] needed.”\n\n       The case was then re-set to October 1, 2012 in a telephonic hearing with all parties\n\npresent.   Border States filed a subsequent motion for continuance on September 25,\n\n2012 requesting a December 2012 trial date. In its motion, Border States insisted that it\n\nneeded to take four more depositions—of defendants Gilbert Enriquez, Jaime Enriquez,\n\nEEI, and fact witness Bob Gastell—and wanted to conduct more written discovery.             This\n\nmotion presented a different characterization of Border States’s trial readiness, as only a\n\nmonth earlier it stated it only needed to issue witness subpoenas. It cited Rule 245 as\n\nthe basis of its motion.    It also stated that the failure of the court to order a Level 3\n\ndiscovery plan denied it “full and fair discovery” and violated its due process rights.\n\n       At a hearing on its motion on October 1, 2012, when the trial court requested that\n\nthe parties be ready for trial the following Wednesday, Border States replied “Okay” and,\n\nlater, “Your honor, any time the Court is ready, we’re ready to go.” The trial court denied\n\n\n\n\n                                               20\n\fBorder States’s motion for continuance after this representation, and the trial began that\n\nday, October 1.\n\n       We review the grant or denial of a motion for continuance on an abuse of discretion\n\nstandard.    Villegas v. Carter, 711 S.W.2d 624, 626 (Tex. 1986). We will not overrule\n\nthe trial court’s decision unless the trial court acted unreasonably or arbitrarily “without\n\nreference to any guiding rules and principles.”          Id.   (quoting Downer v. Aquamarine\n\nOperators, Inc., 701 S.W.2d 238, 241–42 (Tex. 1985)).              “A motion for continuance\n\nseeking time for additional discovery must be supported by an affidavit that describes the\n\nevidence sought, explains its materiality, and shows that the party requesting the\n\ncontinuance has used due diligence to timely obtain the evidence.”            Landers v. State\n\nFarm Lloyds, 257 S.W.3d 740, 747 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2008, no pet.) (citing\n\nTEX. R. CIV. P. 251, 252).\n\n       In light of the record, we cannot say the trial court abused its discretion in denying\n\nBorder States’s motion for continuance. As the trial court correctly pointed out, this case\n\nwas pending on the trial court’s docket for nearly four years, and the parties had adequate\n\ntime to conduct discovery.       Further, the record shows that Border States essentially\n\nwithdrew its motion for continuance when it told the court “any time the Court is ready,\n\nwe’re ready to go” before the trial court ruled on its motion.      “Error resulting from a trial\n\ncourt’s failure to provide parties proper notice under Rule 245 is waived if a party proceeds\n\nto trial and fails to object to the lack of notice.”   Custom-Crete, Inc. v. K-Bar Servs. Inc.,\n\n82 S.W.3d 655, 658 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2002, no pet.).               “A party may waive a\n\ncomplaint by failing to take action when the party receives some, but less than forty-five\n\n\n\n\n                                                21\n\fdays’, notice.”   Id. at 659; see also Balogh v. Ramos, 978 S.W.2d 696, 699 (Tex. App.—\n\nCorpus Christi 1998, pet. denied).\n\n       We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to grant Border\n\nStates’s motion for continuance.      Border States waived its objection when it represented\n\nthat it was ready to proceed with trial before the trial court ruled on its motion.\n\nB.     Level 3 Scheduling Order\n\n       Border States also complains that the trial court failed to issue a Level 3 scheduling\n\norder. Rule 190.4 provides that the court must, on a party’s motion, order that discovery\n\nbe conducted in accordance with a discovery control plan tailored to the circumstances\n\nof the specific suit.   TEX. R. CIV. P. 190.4. “While the rule states that the court ‘must’\n\nenter a level 3 scheduling order on a party's motion, it does not require that the order\n\nprovide deadlines different from those under a level 2 case; even under a level 3\n\nscheduling order, the level 2 deadlines continue to apply ‘unless specifically changed in\n\nthe discovery control plan ordered by the court.’” Allen v. United of Omaha Life Ins. Co.,\n\n236 S.W.3d 315, 327 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2007, no pet.) (quoting TEX. R. CIV. P.\n\n190.4(b)). The trial court ultimately has discretion in these matters; as the rule provides,\n\n“the discovery control plan ordered by the court . . . may change any limitation on the time\n\nfor. . . discovery set forth in these rules.”   TEX. R. CIV. P. 190.4(b).\n\n       This case was pending for four years.          In that time, Border States had ample\n\nopportunity to conduct discovery.       Reviewing the record, we cannot say that the trial\n\ncourt abused its discretion in failing to issue a Level 3 scheduling order.\n\nC.     Violation of Due Process Rights\n\n\n\n\n                                                22\n\f       Finally, we disagree with Border States that it was denied its due process rights\n\nbecause the trial court failed to grant a motion for continuance.    “A trial court’s failure to\n\ncomply with Rule 245 in a contested case deprives a party of its constitutional right to be\n\npresent at the hearing, voice its objections in an appropriate manner, and results in\n\nviolation of fundamental due process.”        Custom-Crete, Inc., 82 S.W.3d at 659 (citing\n\nBlanco v. Bolanos, 20 S.W.3d 809, 811 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2000, no pet.). “Failure to\n\ngive the required notice constitutes lack of due process and is grounds for reversal.”         Id.\n\n       Here, however, Border States had ample opportunity to conduct discovery.            It also\n\nwaived its objections when it represented to the court that it was “ready to go” to trial\n\nbefore the trial court ruled on its motion for continuance.    In light of the record, and the\n\nstandard of review that compels us to defer to the trial court’s decisions absent\n\nunreasonable or arbitrary actions, we overrule Border States’s fifth issue.\n\n                                      VIII.    CONCLUSION\n\n       We reverse the trial court’s judgment with regard to Border States’s claim for\n\nattorney’s fees on the breach of contract claim against Coast and Mendiola and remand\n\nto the trial court to give Border States the opportunity to segregate its fees properly.     The\n\nremainder of the judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                                          __________________________\n                                                          GINA M.

By seven issues, which we re-organize as five, Border\n\fStates Electric Supply argues that the trial court erred:    (1) in rendering a take-nothing\n\njudgment against it because the evidence at trial established that appellees, Enriquez\n\nEnterprises, Inc. and Gilbert Enriquez, were liable under the Texas Construction Trust\n\nFund Act or an implied contract theory of recovery; (2) in issuing factual findings which\n\nwere against the overwhelming weight and preponderance of the evidence; (3) in failing\n\nto admit certain business records; (4) in failing to award attorney’s fees; and (5) in failing\n\nto grant a motion for continuance.\n\n       By one cross-issue, cross-appellant/appellee Coast to Coast Electric, LLC asserts\n\nthat the trial court erred because appellant’s claims were barred by principles of\n\npreclusion.\n\n       We affirm, in part, and reverse and remand, in part.\n\n                                      I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Border States Electric Supply (“Border States”) is a supplier of electrical equipment\n\nfor construction projects.     Coast to Coast Electric, LLC (“Coast”) is an electrical\n\ncontractor owned by Carlos Mendiola, Gilbert Enriquez, and Jaime Enriquez.          Enriquez\n\nEnterprises, Inc. (“EEI”) is a general contractor owned by Guadalupe Enriquez, Gilbert\n\nand Jaime Enriquez’s father. EEI’s chief financial officer is Gilbert Enriquez.\n\n       In February 2007, Coast opened a credit account with Border States to obtain\n\nelectrical equipment for several construction jobs:      (1) a Donna Independent School\n\nDistrict project; (2) the Edinburg Consolidated Independent School District Ebony project;\n\n(3) a Hidalgo Independent School District project; (4) a Sharyland Independent School\n\nDistrict project; and (5) the Bob Gastell warehouse project. Although Coast only had\n\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fone line of credit with Border States, it assigned different account numbers to each project\n\nto ensure that funds were not commingled. Mendiola signed as a personal guarantor for\n\nCoast’s line of credit.\n\n        The evidence shows that Coast paid for most of the equipment purchased from\n\nBorder States.      Border States claims, however, that several “over the counter”\n\npurchases were not paid.      These “over the counter” purchases were picked up and\n\nsigned for by persons allegedly working for Coast.        On April 23, 2008, Border States\n\nsued Coast for the items allegedly not paid for in the Donna ISD project (the “First Suit”).\n\nLater, on June 19, 2008, Border States filed a second lawsuit against Coast for the items\n\nnot paid for in the remaining projects (the “Second Suit”).    The parties settled the First\n\nSuit. The First Suit’s settlement agreement provided that:\n\n        This release specifically does not release any claims that [Border States]\n        has in Cause No. CL-08, 136-D, styled Border States Electric Supply of\n        Texas, Inc. v. Coast to Coast, LLC and Carlos Mendiola . . . and does not\n        preclude the Court in said suit from sustaining any legally sufficient claims\n        of [Border States] or legally sufficient defenses asserted by Coast whether\n        substantive or procedural.\n\n        After the First Suit settled, the parties subsequently went to trial on the Second\n\nSuit.   After a bench trial in the Second Suit, the trial court ordered that Coast and\n\nMendiola, jointly and severally, owed Border States $30,228.94 at the rate of 5% per\n\nannum until paid. The trial court ordered, however, that Border States could take nothing\n\nagainst EEI, Gilbert Enriquez, or Jaime Enriquez.      Finally, the trial court ordered that\n\neach party was responsible for its own attorney’s fees.    Border States requested that the\n\ntrial court issue findings of fact and conclusions of law, and the trial court did so. This\n\nappeal then ensued.\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f                                II. PRINCIPLES OF PRECLUSION\n\n        We will first address cross-appellant/appellee Coast’s cross-issue because it could\n\nbe dispositive of this entire appeal.     See TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1.    Coast contends that\n\nBorder States’s unpaid invoices on the Edinburg, Hidalgo, and Sharyland school projects,\n\nas well as the Gastell warehouse project, should have been raised in the First Suit\n\nbecause they were all due and payable on April 23, 2008, the day the First Suit was filed.\n\nAccordingly, Coast argues that the underlying lawsuit that is the basis for this appeal is\n\nbarred by the principles of preclusion, or res judicata.\n\n        “Claims preclusion prevents the relitigation of a claim or cause of action that has\n\nbeen finally adjudicated, as well as related matters that, with the use of diligence, should\n\nhave been litigated in the prior suit.”   Barr v.

The Texas Supreme Court has adopted\n\na “transactional approach” to claims preclusion and has outlined three factors to\n\ndetermine whether claims arise from the same transaction:         (1) if the claims relate in\n\ntime, space, origin, or motivation; (2) whether they form a convenient trial unit; and (3)\n\nwhether their treatment as a trial unit conforms to the parties’ expectations or business\n\npractices.   Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f       We recognize that Coast only applied for one line of credit with Border States and\n\nthat Coast, on its own, assigned individual numbers to each job location for the sake of\n\nrecordkeeping.    The fact that these debts arise from one line of credit supports the first\n\n“transactional approach” factor that these claims were related in origin and motivation.\n\nSee id. We also acknowledge that resolution of these claims in one lawsuit would form\n\na convenient trial unit, as posited by the second “transactional approach” factor.   See id.\n\n       However, there is evidence that weighs against a finding that these claims were\n\npart of one “transaction.” For example, Coast’s numerous unpaid-for “over the counter”\n\npurchases involved different types of electrical equipment for different construction\n\nprojects throughout South Texas at different times.        See id.   This evidence weighs\n\nagainst a finding of the first “transactional approach” factor that the purchases were\n\nsimilar in time or space.   Most persuasive, however, is the fact that there is no evidence\n\nof the third “transactional approach” factor:   the parties did not expect these claims to be\n\nlitigated as a single trial unit. The First Suit’s settlement agreement provided that the\n\nrelease “specifically [did] not release any claims that [Border States] [had] in Cause No.\n\nCL-08, 136-D.” Coast openly and voluntarily signed a settlement agreement in the First\n\nSuit whereby it recognized that Border States’s outstanding claims in the Second Suit\n\nwere preserved in a different cause number, as well as their own legal defenses.\n\n       After considering the evidence, we disagree with Coast that Border States’s claims\n\nfor the Edinburg, Hidalgo, and Sharyland schools and the Gastell warehouse project were\n\npart of the same “transaction” as the Donna ISD claims and therefore precluded by the\n\nFirst Suit. We overrule Coast’s cross-issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\f                                 III. RECOVERY OF DAMAGES\n\n       We now turn to Border States’s first issue. Border States contends the trial court\n\nerred in not finding EEI and Gilbert Enriquez liable to Border States under the Texas\n\nConstruction Trust Fund Act or an implied contract theory of recovery. We construe this\n\nissue as a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict.\n\nA.     Applicable Law\n\n       When a party attacks the legal sufficiency of an adverse finding on an issue on\n\nwhich it has the burden of proof, it must demonstrate on appeal that the evidence\n\nestablishes, as a matter of law, all vital facts in support of the issue.

App.—Dallas 2005, pet. denied).         Any officer or director who has control or\n\ndirection over the funds is also a trustee of the funds and is personally liable.   Id. at 453–\n\n54.\n\n       Border States argues that EEI was a “contractor” and Gilbert Enriquez was an\n\n“officer” under chapter 162 and that they as “trustees” intentionally defrauded Border\n\nStates as a beneficiary of its rightful trust funds when they failed to fully pay it for\n\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\fequipment.     At trial, Gilbert Enriquez, Chief Financial Officer of EEI and a one-third\n\nowner of Coast, testified that Coast had a post office box where all of its bills were\n\nreceived.    He stated that only Mendiola had a key to this post office box.     He explained\n\nthat Mendiola “gathered all the invoices together,” had a secretary put them into a binder\n\nfor reviewing purposes, and then both men would decide which bills to pay on behalf of\n\nCoast.     In other words, Gilbert only saw the invoices that were provided to him by\n\nMendiola.\n\n         Gilbert performed the same bill-paying functions for EEI.      He agreed that in one\n\npart of his week he paid the bills for EEI, the general contractor on these projects, and\n\nthen later in the week, he helped Mendiola decide which bills to pay for Coast, the\n\nsubcontractor.     Despite the fact that Gilbert worked for both the contractor and\n\nsubcontractor on these projects, there is no specific evidence in the record about the\n\ncompensation EEI received for any of the four projects at issue.        See TEX. PROP. CODE\n\nANN. § 162.001(a) (discussing that construction payments are “trust funds” if the\n\npayments are made to a contractor). The only invoices in evidence were invoices from\n\nBorder States to Coast.     In other words, there was no evidence about the amount of\n\nmoney the school districts or Bob Gastell owed or paid directly to EEI.         Further, there\n\nwas no evidence that either EEI or Gilbert Enriquez acted knowingly or intentionally to\n\ndefraud Border States out of payment, especially given the fact that Gilbert said he could\n\nonly pay the bills Mendiola provided to him.       Id. § 162.031(a) (setting forth the mens rea\n\nrequirement for this statute to apply).\n\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\f      Border States urges us to follow Choy v. Graziano Roofing of Texas to find both\n\nEEI and Gilbert Enriquez liable under the Texas Construction Fund Act. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2280692\"><a href=\"/opinion/2280692/choy-v-graziano-roofing-of-texas-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">322</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">276</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2009, no pet.). In Choy, the trial court found Andrew\n\nChoy, the president of Windwater Homes, L.L.C., a home construction company,\n\npersonally liable for failing to pay a roofing company, Graziano Roofing of Texas, for\n\nroofing materials and labor on thirty-nine residential properties.        Id. at 280.   The\n\nevidence established that Windwater obtained construction loans from Citibank of Texas\n\nand Frost National Bank to finance the construction of these properties.        Id. At trial,\n\nChoy testified that he was President of Windwater, he signed all final checks for the\n\ncompany, and “knew that Graziano and other contractors did not get paid for work they\n\nhad completed.”    Id. at 281.   Choy testified that it was “possible” that some of the\n\nconstruction loan proceeds meant for Graziano Roofing were diverted overseas to\n\nWindwater’s owner.    Id.   The trial court concluded that Choy was a “trustee” under the\n\nAct who misapplied Windwater Homes’s “trust funds” from a construction loan and\n\nentered a final judgment against him personally for $131,796.09.    Id.\n\n      The Choy case is easily distinguished from the underlying case in one key way:\n\nChoy had documents in evidence that showed the amount of funds the banks released\n\nto Windwater for roofing supplies.   Id. at 280.   The record showed that when Citibank,\n\nfor example, received a request, a Citibank inspector would visit the property at issue and\n\ndocument “that whatever item was being billed at that time was complete.”      Id.   No such\n\nevidence existed here. The only business records that were in evidence were invoices\n\nfrom Border States to Coast; there was no evidence regarding the amount of funds the\n\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\fschool districts or Bob Gastell paid to EEI for electrical equipment.   See TEX. PROP. CODE\n\nANN. § 162.001(a).       Furthermore, there was no evidence that Gilbert Enriquez\n\nintentionally, knowingly, or with the intent to defraud, kept funds from Border States,\n\nwhereas Choy testified that it was “possible” that some of the construction loan proceeds\n\nmeant for Graziano Roofing were diverted overseas.         See Choy, 322 S.W.3d at 281.\n\n       In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the evidence supports the trial court’s\n\nholding that there was no violation of the Texas Construction Trust Act.          See Dow\n\nChemical, 46 S.W.3d at 241.      Border States did not meet its burden in establishing that\n\neither EEI or Gilbert Enriquez had “trust funds” or that the requisite scienter existed to\n\nmeet the elements of this claim.    See TEX. PROP. CODE ANN. §§ 162.001(a), 162.031(a).\n\nFurther, we hold that this finding is not so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the\n\nevidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust. Pool, 715 S.W.2d at 635.\n\nC.     Implied Contract Theory of Recovery\n\n       Border States also contends that the trial court should have found that EEI and\n\nGilbert Enriquez were liable under an implied contract theory of recovery.    “It is said that\n\nthe distinction between an express contract and one implied in fact is that the former\n\narises when the contractual terms are stated by the parties; and that the latter arises from\n\nthe acts and conduct of the parties, it being implied from the facts and circumstances that\n\nthere was a mutual intention to contract.”        Haws & Garrett Gen.

Plaintiff proved that materials in the amount of $30,228.94 were\n                 delivered to representatives of Coast by Border.\n\n       5.

Plaintiff failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that,\n                 assuming the existence of trust funds, any defendant directly or\n                 indirectly retained, used, disbursed, or otherwise diverted trust funds.\n\n       Weighing all of the evidence in the record (as detailed earlier in section III.B of this\n\nopinion), we cannot say that the trial court’s findings of fact regarding EEI and Gilbert\n\n\n\n\n       1   The trial court defined the “Enriquez Defendants” as EEI, Jaime Enriquez, and Gilbert Enriquez.\n\n\n\n                                                    13\n\fEnriquez’s liability “are so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence\n\nas to be clearly wrong and unjust.”   Cain, 709 S.W.2d at 176.\n\nB.    The Implied Contract Theory\n\n      Border States also challenged the trial court’s findings of fact regarding Border\n\nStates’s contract claims.   The relevant findings of fact follow:\n\n      1. Plaintiff proved by a preponderance of the evidence that a written\n         contract was executed between Border and Coast.\n\n      2. Plaintiff proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Mendiola\n         executed the contract between Border and Coast on behalf of Coast and\n         as a personal guarantor.\n\n      3. Plaintiff failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a\n         contract, in any form, existed between Border and any of the Enriquez\n         Defendants.\n\n      4. Plaintiff failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Border\n         expected payment from Enriquez Defendants.\n\n      5. Plaintiff failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that an\n         “offer” was made by Border to any of the Enrique Defendants.\n\n      6. Plaintiff failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that there\n         was an “acceptance” of any offer by the Enriquez Defendants.\n\n      7. Plaintiff failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that there\n         was a “meeting of the minds” between Border and any of the Enriquez\n         Defendants.\n\n      8. Plaintiff failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the\n         Enriquez Defendants consented to the terms of any agreement with\n         Border.\n\n      9.

We overrule Border States’s second issue.\n\n                              V. THE EXCLUSION OF EVIDENCE\n\n       By its third issue, Border States argues that the trial court abused its discretion\n\nwhen it failed to admit certain business records.     Specifically, Border States complains\n\nthat the trial court erred when it failed to admit the invoices “because these documents\n\nwere adequately proven through the uncontested testimony of [Border States’s]\n\ncustodians of the business records who provided uncontradicted testimony regarding the\n\ntrustworthiness of said invoices and statements pursuant to Texas Rule of Evidence\n\n803(6).”\n\n       The admission of evidence is a matter within the trial court’s discretion.

Most of these invoices had the signature of Coast employee Joe Garcia, and\n\nGarcia gave conflicting testimony regarding these records.     First, Garcia testified that the\n\nsignatures on some of the invoices were not his. Later, when Garcia learned that the\n\nsignatures were written on an electronic signature pad, he stated that “there was a high\n\nprobability” that some of the signatures could be his. There were also a few invoices\n\nthat indicated that merchandise was “picked up by Joe Garcia” but then had the signature\n\nof other Coast employees.\n\n       The court, as the finder of fact, determined the credibility of the witnesses and the\n\nweight to be given their testimony.   See City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 820.     It was within\n\nthe province of the finder of fact to resolve conflicts in the evidence, id., and here, with\n\nGarcia’s wavering testimony and invoices showing conflicting information, the trial court\n\ndeemed the invoices untrustworthy.     In light of the foregoing, we cannot say that the trial\n\ncourt abused its discretion in excluding these invoices.   See Interstate Northborough, 66\n\nS.W.3d at 220.     Further, because Border States has not shown that the exclusion of\n\nthese invoices led to an improper judgment, we overrule this issue.      See TEX. R. APP. P.\n\n44.1(a); Interstate Northborough, 897 S.W.2d at 220.\n\n                     VI.    THE FAILURE TO AWARD ATTORNEY’S FEES\n\n       In its final judgment, the court ordered that “each party shall be responsible for its\n\nown attorney’s fees.” By its fourth issue, Border States complains that the trial court\n\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\fshould have awarded it attorney’s fees.    “In Texas, attorney’s fees may not be recovered\n\nfrom an opposing party unless such recovery is provided for by statute or by contract\n\nbetween the parties.”    Travelers Indem.

Mayfield, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1639926\"><a href=\"/opinion/1639926/travelers-indem-co-of-conn-v-mayfield/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">590</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 593\n\n(Tex. 1996). Here, Border States alleges that its attorney’s fees are recoverable under\n\nTexas Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 38.001, which sets forth that reasonable\n\nattorney’s fees may be awarded if the claim is for an oral or written contract.     See TEX.\n\nCIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 38.001(8) (West, Westlaw through 2013 3d C.S.).\n\n       Border States filed several causes of action against Coast and Mendiola, including\n\n(1) conversion, (2) quasi-contract, (3) unjust enrichment, (4) quantum meruit, (5) collateral\n\nestoppel, (6) violations of the Texas Construction Fund Act, (7) alter ego, and (8) breach\n\nof contract claims. Of these, Border States could only recover attorney’s fees from its\n\ncontract action, because its other claims were unsuccessful. At trial, Border States’s\n\nattorney William Kimball testified that he had practiced law in Texas for twenty-eight\n\nyears, specifically in complex commercial litigation cases; that his hourly rate was $225\n\nper hour; and that this fee was a reasonable and customary fee for attorneys with his\n\nexperience practicing law in south Texas.     A copy of his billing statements for this case\n\nwas entered into evidence. The billing statement revealed that Kimball billed $28,060.37\n\nin fees representing Border States in the underlying case.\n\n       In its findings of fact and conclusions of law, the trial court pointed out that Border\n\nStates failed to segregate its attorney’s fees for each of the claims asserted.      It noted\n\nthat “Plaintiff’s evidence of attorney’s fees included attorney’s fees incurred for the entire\n\ncase” and that “Plaintiff failed to provide any evidence of the amount of fees incurred on\n\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\fonly the contract claim against Coast.”       It held that a “trial court may refuse to award\n\nattorney’s fees in the absence of segregation.”\n\n          In Stewart Title Guaranty Company v. Sterling, the Texas Supreme Court held that\n\n“a plaintiff is required to show that attorney’s fees were incurred while suing the defendant\n\nsought to be charged with the fees on a claim which allows recovery of such fees.”          </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">822</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 11 (Tex. 1991) (emphasis added). However, the high court then recognized\n\nthe following exception:\n\n          A recognized exception to this duty to segregate arises when the attorney’s\n          fees rendered are in connection with claims arising out of the same\n          transaction and are so interrelated that their prosecution or defense entails\n          proof or denial of essentially the same facts.\n\nId. at 11. Border States, in its briefing, argues that this exception is applicable to its\n\ncase.     It contended that its attorney’s fees were generated in connection “with claims\n\narising out of the same transactions” and were so interrelated that their prosecution\n\nentailed proof of essentially the same facts.           However, although claims may be\n\n“dependent upon the same set of facts or circumstances . . . that does not mean they all\n\nrequired the same research, discovery, proof, or legal expertise.”        Tony Gullo Motors I,\n\nL.P. v.

Ortiz, 917 S.W.2d at 772.     We may only overturn a finding if it is so\n\nagainst the great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and\n\nunjust.     Cain, 709 S.W.2d at 176. In reviewing the record and evidence, the appellate\n\ncourt must clearly state why the factfinder’s “finding is factually insufficient or is so against\n\nthe great weight and preponderance as to be manifestly unjust.”           Ortiz, 917 S.W.2d at\n\n\n\n                                               18\n\f772.   Here, we acknowledge that the trial court found that Border States was successful\n\nin its breach of contract claim against Coast and Mendiola.        In light of this finding, and\n\nguided by the Tony Gullo Motors case, we conclude that Border States’s “failure to\n\nsegregate [its] attorney’s fees does not mean [it] cannot recover any.            Unsegregated\n\nattorney’s fees for the entire case are some evidence of what the segregated amount\n\nshould be.”   Tony Gullo Motors, Inc., 212 S.W.3d at 314. Accordingly, we sustain this\n\nissue and remand it back to the trial court. Under Tony Gullo Motors, it is not necessary\n\nfor Border States to create separate time records for the breach of contract claim.          Id.\n\nBorder States must, however, provide evidence testifying what percentage of time was\n\ndedicated solely to the successful breach of contract claim against Coast and Mendiola\n\nto be able to recoup these fees.     Id.\n\n                          VII.   THE MOTION FOR CONTINUANCE\n\n       In its fifth and final issue, with three sub-issues, Border States also argues that the\n\ntrial court erred in failing to grant a motion for continuance.     First, it contends the trial\n\ncourt did not give it the proper 45-day trial notice as required by Texas Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 245.     See TEX. R. CIV. P. 245. Second, Border States asserts that the trial\n\ncourt erred in failing to enter a level 3 scheduling order.   See id. R. 190.4.   Third, Border\n\nStates avers that the trial court’s failure to grant a continuance violated its due process\n\nrights. We address each sub-issue in turn.\n\nA.     Proper Notice\n\n       Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 245 provides that a court “may set contested\n\ncases . . . on the court’s own motion, with reasonable notice of not less than forty-five\n\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\fdays to the parties of a first setting for trial, or by agreement of the parties.”   TEX. R. CIV.\n\nP. 245.    At a pre-trial hearing on August 27, 2012, the trial court noted that this was a\n\n2008 case and suggested setting the case for trial on September 17, 2012. When the\n\ntrial court announced this, counsel for Border States replied, “Judge, all I need is just a\n\nlittle additional time just to get witness subpoenas out.” Later that day, Border States\n\nsubmitted a proposed order to the trial court setting trial for September 17, 2012.\n\nHowever, Coast filed an objection to the trial setting, asking for forty-five days’ notice as\n\nrequired by Rule 245.        Border States responded and “reluctantly agree[d] that a\n\ncontinuance [was] needed.”\n\n       The case was then re-set to October 1, 2012 in a telephonic hearing with all parties\n\npresent.   Border States filed a subsequent motion for continuance on September 25,\n\n2012 requesting a December 2012 trial date. In its motion, Border States insisted that it\n\nneeded to take four more depositions—of defendants Gilbert Enriquez, Jaime Enriquez,\n\nEEI, and fact witness Bob Gastell—and wanted to conduct more written discovery.             This\n\nmotion presented a different characterization of Border States’s trial readiness, as only a\n\nmonth earlier it stated it only needed to issue witness subpoenas. It cited Rule 245 as\n\nthe basis of its motion.    It also stated that the failure of the court to order a Level 3\n\ndiscovery plan denied it “full and fair discovery” and violated its due process rights.\n\n       At a hearing on its motion on October 1, 2012, when the trial court requested that\n\nthe parties be ready for trial the following Wednesday, Border States replied “Okay” and,\n\nlater, “Your honor, any time the Court is ready, we’re ready to go.” The trial court denied\n\n\n\n\n                                               20\n\fBorder States’s motion for continuance after this representation, and the trial began that\n\nday, October 1.\n\n       We review the grant or denial of a motion for continuance on an abuse of discretion\n\nstandard.

App.—\n\nCorpus Christi 1998, pet. denied).\n\n       We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to grant Border\n\nStates’s motion for continuance.      Border States waived its objection when it represented\n\nthat it was ready to proceed with trial before the trial court ruled on its motion.\n\nB.     Level 3 Scheduling Order\n\n       Border States also complains that the trial court failed to issue a Level 3 scheduling\n\norder. Rule 190.4 provides that the court must, on a party’s motion, order that discovery\n\nbe conducted in accordance with a discovery control plan tailored to the circumstances\n\nof the specific suit.   TEX. R. CIV. P. 190.4. “While the rule states that the court ‘must’\n\nenter a level 3 scheduling order on a party's motion, it does not require that the order\n\nprovide deadlines different from those under a level 2 case; even under a level 3\n\nscheduling order, the level 2 deadlines continue to apply ‘unless specifically changed in\n\nthe discovery control plan ordered by the court.’” Allen v.

App.—Fort Worth 2007, no pet.) (quoting TEX. R. CIV. P.\n\n190.4(b)). The trial court ultimately has discretion in these matters; as the rule provides,\n\n“the discovery control plan ordered by the court . . . may change any limitation on the time\n\nfor. . . discovery set forth in these rules.”   TEX. R. CIV. P. 190.4(b).\n\n       This case was pending for four years.          In that time, Border States had ample\n\nopportunity to conduct discovery.       Reviewing the record, we cannot say that the trial\n\ncourt abused its discretion in failing to issue a Level 3 scheduling order.\n\nC.     Violation of Due Process Rights\n\n\n\n\n                                                22\n\f       Finally, we disagree with Border States that it was denied its due process rights\n\nbecause the trial court failed to grant a motion for continuance.    “A trial court’s failure to\n\ncomply with Rule 245 in a contested case deprives a party of its constitutional right to be\n\npresent at the hearing, voice its objections in an appropriate manner, and results in\n\nviolation of fundamental due process.”        Custom-Crete, Inc., 82 S.W.3d at 659 (citing\n\nBlanco v. Bolanos, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1383226\"><a href=\"/opinion/1383226/blanco-v-bolanos/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">809</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 811 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2000, no pet.). “Failure to\n\ngive the required notice constitutes lack of due process and is grounds for reversal.”         Id.\n\n       Here, however, Border States had ample opportunity to conduct discovery.            It also\n\nwaived its objections when it represented to the court that it was “ready to go” to trial\n\nbefore the trial court ruled on its motion for continuance.    In light of the record, and the\n\nstandard of review that compels us to defer to the trial court’s decisions absent\n\nunreasonable or arbitrary actions, we overrule Border States’s fifth issue.\n\n                                      VIII.    CONCLUSION\n\n       We reverse the trial court’s judgment with regard to Border States’s claim for\n\nattorney’s fees on the breach of contract claim against Coast and Mendiola and remand\n\nto the trial court to give Border States the opportunity to segregate its fees properly.     The\n\nremainder of the judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                                          __________________________\n                                                          GINA M.
