Jones named as\n\ndefendants six employees of the New Jersey Department of\n\nCorrections.    The gravamen of Jones's claim is that his right to\n\ndue process was denied in connection with a prison disciplinary\n\ncharge for which he was originally adjudged guilty and served\n\ntime in detention before it was reversed.\n\n                                   I.\n\n                    Facts and Procedural History\n\n           The disciplinary charge was based on the following\n\nfacts:    On August 20, 1991, Senior Corrections Officer Marren of\n\nthe New Jersey State Prison in Trenton found a letter that stated\n\nthat \"Twin, Malik and myself is [sic] waiting on those things\n\n(fiber Joints (shank) . . .\"    App. at 40.     Prison officials\n\ndetermined that \"Twin\" referred to appellant Jones.       Based on\n\nthis letter, Jones was charged with attempting to possess a\n\nweapon.   On August 21, 1991, Jones was removed from the\n\nmainstream prison population and placed in what the district\n\ncourt referred to as the \"hole\" pending a hearing.\n\n            On August 28, 1991, defendant Gary Sheppard, a hearing\n\nofficer, conducted an administrative hearing in which this letter\n\nand a confidential report constituted the evidence against Jones,\n\n                                  2\n\fand at which Jones was found guilty of attempting to possess\n\nweapons.    As a result of the administrative ruling, Jones was\n\nplaced in detention for fifteen days, and it was recommended that\n\nhe lose 180 days commutation credits and that he be subjected to\n\n180 days of administrative segregation.    Jones appealed this\n\ndecision through administrative channels.    On September 9, 1991,\n\ndefendant Vernon Johnson, the Assistant Superintendent, upheld\n\nthe decision of Hearing Officer Sheppard.    Jones sought\n\nreconsideration of this decision, which was denied by\n\nSuperintendent Howard Beyer on September 16, 1991.\n\n            Jones then appealed to the Superior Court of New\n\nJersey, Appellate Division.    In an opinion dated July 14, 1993,\n\nthat court reversed the decision of the prison officials and\n\nvacated the sanctions imposed on Jones, finding that the decision\n\nwas not based on substantial evidence.    The Appellate Division\n\ncourt found the confidential report to lack probative value and\n\ncharacterized the evidence against Jones \"as superficial at\n\nbest.\"     Jones v. Department of Corrections, No. A-3121-91T5 (N.J.\n\nSuper. Ct. App. Div. July 14, 1993) (per curiam) at 2, reprinted\nin App. at 41.\n\n            Jones then filed this action in federal court.\n\nDefendants moved for summary judgment on two grounds.       First they\n\nargued that Jones's complaint was barred by the statute of\n\nlimitations, using as the filing date the official filing which\n\nfollowed the court's evaluation of Jones's in forma pauperis\n\napplication, rather than the date on which the complaint was\n\n\n\n                                  3\n\freceived.   Second, the defendants interposed a res judicata\n\ndefense.\n\n            The district court rejected defendants' argument that\n\nthe suit was time barred, finding that the relevant date for\n\nstatute of limitations purposes was the date of receipt of\n\nJones's complaint.    However, the district court granted\n\ndefendants' motion for summary judgment, agreeing that Jones's\n\naction was barred by application of the doctrine of res judicata\n\nand New Jersey's entire controversy doctrine.    The court reasoned\n\nthat the judgment in the New Jersey state case was final, had\n\nbeen adjudicated on the merits, and involved the same parties and\n\nthe same occurrence or transaction.    As a result, Jones was\n\nbarred from raising any claims which he could have raised in the\n\nfirst action.    The court determined that Jones could have raised\n\nthe section 1983 claim asserted here in the New Jersey state\n\ncourt proceeding, and thus found this action to be barred.\n\n            Jones filed a timely pro se appeal to this court.\n\n                                II.\n\n                             Discussion1\n\n            Federal courts must apply the doctrine of res judicata\n\nto civil actions brought under section 1983 and in this context\n\n\"must give to a state-court judgment the same preclusive effect\n\nas would be given that judgment under the law of the State in\n\nwhich the judgment was rendered.\"     Migra v. Warren City School\n\n\n  1\n   Defendants do not raise the statute of limitations issue on\nappeal, and thus we confine ourselves to the res judicata/entire\n                       controversy issue.\n\n\n                                 4\n\fDist. Bd. of Ed., 465 U.S. 75, 81 (1984).   The principles of res\n\njudicata are reinforced in New Jersey by the entire controversy\n\ndoctrine which \"requires that all issues of a single dispute\n\nbetween the parties must be completely determined in one action.\"\n\nCulver v. Insurance Co. of N. Am., 559 A.2d 400, 406 (N.J. 1989).\n\n          Under New Jersey law, res judicata or claim preclusion\n\napplies when (1) the judgment in the first action is valid, final\n\nand on the merits; (2) there is identity of the parties, or the\n\nparties in the second action are in privity with those in the\n\nfirst action; and (3) the claim in the later action grows out of\n\nthe same transaction or occurrence as the claim in the first\n\naction.   See Watkins v. Resorts Int'l Hotel & Casino, Inc., 591\n\nA.2d 592, 599 (N.J. 1991); Culver, 559 A.2d at 405-06.\n\n          It is evident that the first condition for application\n\nof res judicata has been met in that the Appellate Division\n\ndecision was final, valid and on the merits.     In addition, it\n\nappears that the employees of the Department of Corrections, who\n\nare the defendants in this action, may be considered to be the\n\nsame or in privity with the Department of Corrections, which was\n\nthe defendant in the first action, and may claim the benefit of\n\nres judicata if it would apply to the Department itself.     See\nRodziewicz v. Beyer, 809 F. Supp. 1164, 1167 (D.N.J. 1992)\n\n(employees of Department of Corrections held to be in identity\n\nwith the Department for claim preclusion under New Jersey law).\n\nMoreover, the entire controversy doctrine is applicable not only\n\nto related claims but also to related parties.     See Cogdell v.\nHospital Ctr. at Orange, 560 A.2d 1169, 1178 (N.J. 1989).\n\n\n                                5\n\fNonetheless, we do not decide whether the second prong of res\n\njudicata has been met in this case, nor do we decide whether the\n\nthird prong, which requires that the claim in the second action\n\ngrow out of the same transaction or occurrence as the claim in\n\nthe state court action, applies here.   The New Jersey Supreme\n\nCourt has directed courts to consider:\n          (1) whether the acts complained of and the demand for\n          relief are the same (that is, whether the wrong for\n          which redress is sought is the same in both actions);\n          (2) whether the theory of recovery is the same; (3)\n          whether the witnesses and documents necessary at trial\n          are the same (that is, whether the same evidence\n          necessary to maintain the second action would support\n          the first); and (4) whether the material facts alleged\n          are the same.\n\nCulver, 559 A.2d at 406 (citations omitted) (quoting United\n\nStates v. Athlone Indus., 746 F.2d 977, 984 (3d Cir. 1984)).     The\n\ndistrict court applied the criteria set forth in Culver and\n\nconcluded that Jones's federal action involved the same\n\ntransaction or occurrence as at issue in the earlier New Jersey\n\nSuperior Court action.\n\n           We believe that a persuasive argument can be made that\nneither the acts complained of nor the demand for relief in the\n\ntwo actions are the same.   In the first action, Jones challenged\n\nthe administrative determination of his guilt on the attempted\n\npossession of weapons charge; thus the acts at issue in that case\n\nwere those of Jones.   By contrast, in the federal action, Jones\n\nchallenges the conduct of the Department of Corrections'\n\nofficials in proceeding with the disciplinary hearing and\n\nsanctions \"knowing they had no just cause.\"   App. at 7.    Although\n\nthe district court was correct that whether plaintiff's right to\n\n\n                                6\n\fdue process was violated will be implicated in both cases, there\n\nare differences, albeit subtle, between the two actions.     Because\n\nwe believe another issue is dispositive, for our purposes we will\n\nassume that the district court did not err in finding the\n\nsimilarity requisite for application of res judicata.\n\n          Instead, we part with the district court in its\n\ndetermination that the New Jersey Superior Court Appellate\n\nDivision would have heard Jones's section 1983 claim as part of\n\nits review over the prison disciplinary action, had Jones\n\npresented it at that time.\n\n          It is unquestioned that state courts have concurrent\n\njurisdiction with federal courts to hear section 1983 claims. See\n\nMaine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 3 n.1 (1980).   However, under the\n\nentire controversy doctrine, a party will not be barred from\n\nraising claims that he could not have brought in the initial\n\naction.   As the New Jersey Supreme Court has stated, if\n           the court in the first action would clearly not have\n           had jurisdiction to entertain the omitted theory or\n           ground (or, having jurisdiction, would clearly have\n           declined to exercise it as a matter of discretion),\n           then a second action in a competent court presenting\n           the omitted theory or ground should not be held\n           precluded.\n\n\nWatkins, 591 A.2d at 599 (quoting Restatement (Second) of\nJudgments § 25 cmt. e (1982)); see also Culver, 559 A.2d at 406.\n\nThus, to invoke the principles of res judicata, the first court\n\nmust not only have had jurisdiction to hear the claim now sought\n\nto be precluded, but there must also be some likelihood that it\n\nwould have exercised that jurisdiction to hear that claim.\n\n\n\n                                7\n\f          Under New Jersey Rules of Appellate Practice 2:2-3(2),\n\nthe Appellate Division of the Superior Court has jurisdiction\n\nover appeals from administrative agencies.   New Jersey Rule of\n\nAppellate Practice 2:10-5 provides that \"[t]he appellate court\n\nmay exercise such original jurisdiction as is necessary to the\n\ncomplete determination of any matter on review.\"   This Rule was\n\nrelied upon by the district court in its decision that New Jersey\n\nlaw would not have barred Jones from raising his section 1983\n\nclaim at the time he appealed the administrative action to the\n\nAppellate Division.\n\n          The New Jersey courts have suggested that under this\n\nRule the appellate courts have jurisdiction to make factual\n\nfindings that ordinarily would be remanded to the trial courts\n\nwhen this is necessary to the complete determination of disputes\n\nbefore them.   See, e.g., State v. Jarbath, 555 A.2d 559, 567\n\n(N.J. 1989) (\"[W]hen an appellate court finds a clear abuse of\n\ndiscretion, it has the power to make new fact-findings.    The\n\npower to review evidence and reach independent determinations of\n\nthe facts encompasses the power to call for additional evidence\n\nto supplement the record\") (citations omitted)); State v.\nRodriguez, 357 A.2d 59 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1976) (per\n\ncuriam) (Appellate Division exercised original jurisdiction to\n\ndetermine whether there had been manifest denial of justice under\n\nthe law, an issue not decided by the Superior Court, but\n\nnecessary to completely determine the matter); State v. Odom, 273\n\nA.2d 379 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1971) (per curiam) (Appellate\n\nDivision could make findings of fact justifying denial of post-\n\n                                8\n\fconviction relief where trial court had failed to do so rather\n\nthan remand).\n\n          The leading case applying this Rule in the context of\n\nan appeal of an administrative decision is Pascucci v. Vagott,\n\n362 A.2d 566 (N.J. 1976), where the Supreme Court of New Jersey\n\nconstrued Rules of Appellate Practice 2:2-3(2) and 2:10-5\n\ntogether as permitting appellate courts in actions arising under\n\nadministrative review to exercise original jurisdiction as to\n\nrelated matters necessary to the complete resolution of a matter\n\nproperly before an appellate court.   In that case, the Court\n\ndetermined that the Appellate Division, in reviewing a challenge\n\nto a regulation of the Department of Public Welfare which varied\n\nthe amount of public assistance paid to employable versus\n\nunemployable persons, could exercise original jurisdiction to\n\ncompletely resolve the questions raised and decide the claim of\n\none of the appellants who had argued that the local welfare\n\ndirector's discretionary authority exceeded that provided by\n\nstatute, a claim that ordinarily would be brought in Juvenile and\n\nDomestic Relations Court.   See id. at 572-73.   The Pascucci court\n\ndetermined that because the Appellate Division had jurisdiction\n\nover the administrative proceedings, and because under Rule 2:10-\n\n5 it could \"exercise such original jurisdiction as is necessary\n\nto the complete determination of any matter on review,\" the\n\nAppellate Division could also hear the challenge that would\n\notherwise be heard in Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court.    See\nid.\n\n\n\n                                9\n\f          It does not follow from Pascucci that a New Jersey\n\nappellate court would exercise its power of original\n\njurisdiction--ordinarily reserved for situations in which\n\njudicial efficiency dictates that the appellate court not remand\n\na case--to resolve claims best heard by a trial court.   The\n\nmajority of New Jersey cases applying Rule 2:10-5 represent\n\ninstances in which appellate courts, despite the absence of trial\n\ncourt findings, had an adequate factual basis in the record to\n\nresolve questions that were essential to the determination of the\n\nissues before them.   See, e.g., In re S.H., 293 A.2d 181, 185\n\n(N.J. 1972) (Supreme Court reviewed undisputed evidence of record\n\nonly, finding that it established that juvenile had committed the\n\nact with which he was charged beyond a reasonable doubt); Bruder\n\nv. Teachers' Pension & Annuity Fund, 142 A.2d 225, 229 (N.J.\n\n1958) (where dispute involved exclusively legal questions\n\nappellate court would invoke power of original jurisdiction based\n\non undisputed evidence presented to judge who incorrectly\n\ndismissed case for lack of jurisdiction); African Council v.\n\nHadge, 604 A.2d 604, 609 (N.J. Super Ct. App. Div. 1992) (\"Given\n\n. . . the completeness of the record, the interest of justice\n\ndictates that we exercise original jurisdiction pursuant to R.\n2:10-5 in fixing a counsel fee allowance.\"); Marion v. Manasquan,\n\n555 A.2d 699, 704 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1989) (\"Although\n\nthis specific question was not presented to the trial judge, we\n\nraise it now sua sponte since its resolution is necessary for a\n\ncomplete determination of the matter under review and the facts\nto resolve it are present in the record.\" (emphasis added));\n\n\n                                10\n\fYoung v. Savinon, 492 A.2d 385 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1985)\n\n(based on factual testimony and expert opinion presented at\n\ntrial, Appellate Division found it unreasonable to enforce a\n\nparticular provision in tenants' lease); Ferrari v. Melleby, 342\n\nA.2d 537, 540 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1975) (\"We have\n\ncarefully reviewed the record and are satisfied that appellant's\n\ncharges are essentially true as outlined previously, and that in\n\nsubstance they are not denied by respondents.\"); but cf. State v.\n\nJarbath, 555 A.2d 559, 568 (N.J. 1989) (affirming appellate\n\ncourt's decision to call for additional documentary evidence,\n\nincluding autopsy report, to supplement the record in limited\n\ncontext of criminal sentencing).\n\n          Although an appellate court reviewing administrative\n\ndecisions may invoke Rule 2:10-5, the scope of appellate review\n\nof agency decisions is generally narrow.   See, e.g., T.R. v. New\n\nJersey Div. of Developmental Disabilities, 592 A.2d 13, 16 (N.J.\n\nSuper. Ct. App. Div. 1991) (appellate court must not substitute\n\nown judgment for that of agency).\n\n          Based on our review of New Jersey cases, we predict\n\nthat a New Jersey appellate court faced with Jones's section 1983\n\nclaim at the time that it was evaluating his appeal of the\n\nadministrative sanctions imposed on him would not exercise\n\noriginal jurisdiction under Rule 2:10-5.\n\n           Our prediction that the New Jersey Appellate Division\n\ncourt would not have exercised jurisdiction over Jones's section\n\n1983 claim is based in part on the sparsity of his complaint.     He\n\nstates only that the named defendants denied him due process\n\n                               11\n\frights by instigating administrative proceedings against him\n\nknowing that they lacked the requisite just cause.   Analysis of\n\nthis claim would have required evidence not of record at the time\n\nof the appeal of the administrative ruling.   Because res judicata\n\ndoes not apply where a court \"having jurisdiction, would clearly\n\nhave declined to exercise it as a matter of discretion,\" Watkins,\n\n591 A.2d at 599 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 25\n\ncmt. e), and we conclude this is such a case, we cannot sustain\n\nthe district court's dismissal of Jones's complaint on that\n\nground.   Of course, we intimate no view as to whether there is\n\nany other facial defect in the pleading, as that issue was not\n\nconsidered by the district court.\n\n                               III.\n\n                            Conclusion\n          For the foregoing reasons, we will reverse the judgment\ndismissing Jones's complaint and remand for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion. Each party to bear its own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                12\n\f",

Jones named as\n\ndefendants six employees of the New Jersey Department of\n\nCorrections.    The gravamen of Jones's claim is that his right to\n\ndue process was denied in connection with a prison disciplinary\n\ncharge for which he was originally adjudged guilty and served\n\ntime in detention before it was reversed.\n\n                                   I.\n\n                    Facts and Procedural History\n\n           The disciplinary charge was based on the following\n\nfacts:    On August 20, 1991, Senior Corrections Officer Marren of\n\nthe New Jersey State Prison in Trenton found a letter that stated\n\nthat \"Twin, Malik and myself is [sic] waiting on those things\n\n(fiber Joints (shank) . . .\"    App. at 40.     Prison officials\n\ndetermined that \"Twin\" referred to appellant Jones.       Based on\n\nthis letter, Jones was charged with attempting to possess a\n\nweapon.   On August 21, 1991, Jones was removed from the\n\nmainstream prison population and placed in what the district\n\ncourt referred to as the \"hole\" pending a hearing.\n\n            On August 28, 1991, defendant Gary Sheppard, a hearing\n\nofficer, conducted an administrative hearing in which this letter\n\nand a confidential report constituted the evidence against Jones,\n\n                                  2\n\fand at which Jones was found guilty of attempting to possess\n\nweapons.    As a result of the administrative ruling, Jones was\n\nplaced in detention for fifteen days, and it was recommended that\n\nhe lose 180 days commutation credits and that he be subjected to\n\n180 days of administrative segregation.    Jones appealed this\n\ndecision through administrative channels.    On September 9, 1991,\n\ndefendant Vernon Johnson, the Assistant Superintendent, upheld\n\nthe decision of Hearing Officer Sheppard.    Jones sought\n\nreconsideration of this decision, which was denied by\n\nSuperintendent Howard Beyer on September 16, 1991.\n\n            Jones then appealed to the Superior Court of New\n\nJersey, Appellate Division.    In an opinion dated July 14, 1993,\n\nthat court reversed the decision of the prison officials and\n\nvacated the sanctions imposed on Jones, finding that the decision\n\nwas not based on substantial evidence.    The Appellate Division\n\ncourt found the confidential report to lack probative value and\n\ncharacterized the evidence against Jones \"as superficial at\n\nbest.\"     Jones v. Department of Corrections, No. A-3121-91T5 (N.J.\n\nSuper. Ct. App. Div. July 14, 1993) (per curiam) at 2, reprinted\nin App. at 41.\n\n            Jones then filed this action in federal court.\n\nDefendants moved for summary judgment on two grounds.       First they\n\nargued that Jones's complaint was barred by the statute of\n\nlimitations, using as the filing date the official filing which\n\nfollowed the court's evaluation of Jones's in forma pauperis\n\napplication, rather than the date on which the complaint was\n\n\n\n                                  3\n\freceived.   Second, the defendants interposed a res judicata\n\ndefense.\n\n            The district court rejected defendants' argument that\n\nthe suit was time barred, finding that the relevant date for\n\nstatute of limitations purposes was the date of receipt of\n\nJones's complaint.    However, the district court granted\n\ndefendants' motion for summary judgment, agreeing that Jones's\n\naction was barred by application of the doctrine of res judicata\n\nand New Jersey's entire controversy doctrine.    The court reasoned\n\nthat the judgment in the New Jersey state case was final, had\n\nbeen adjudicated on the merits, and involved the same parties and\n\nthe same occurrence or transaction.    As a result, Jones was\n\nbarred from raising any claims which he could have raised in the\n\nfirst action.    The court determined that Jones could have raised\n\nthe section 1983 claim asserted here in the New Jersey state\n\ncourt proceeding, and thus found this action to be barred.\n\n            Jones filed a timely pro se appeal to this court.\n\n                                II.\n\n                             Discussion1\n\n            Federal courts must apply the doctrine of res judicata\n\nto civil actions brought under section 1983 and in this context\n\n\"must give to a state-court judgment the same preclusive effect\n\nas would be given that judgment under the law of the State in\n\nwhich the judgment was rendered.\"     Migra v.

The principles of res\n\njudicata are reinforced in New Jersey by the entire controversy\n\ndoctrine which \"requires that all issues of a single dispute\n\nbetween the parties must be completely determined in one action.\"\n\nCulver v.

In addition, it\n\nappears that the employees of the Department of Corrections, who\n\nare the defendants in this action, may be considered to be the\n\nsame or in privity with the Department of Corrections, which was\n\nthe defendant in the first action, and may claim the benefit of\n\nres judicata if it would apply to the Department itself.     See\nRodziewicz v. Beyer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1455987\"><a href=\"/opinion/1455987/rodziewicz-v-beyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

See Cogdell v.\nHospital Ctr. at Orange, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1936628\"><a href=\"/opinion/1936628/cogdell-v-hospital-center-at-orange/\"><span class=\"volume\">560</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1169</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1178 (N.J. 1989).\n\n\n                                5\n\fNonetheless, we do not decide whether the second prong of res\n\njudicata has been met in this case, nor do we decide whether the\n\nthird prong, which requires that the claim in the second action\n\ngrow out of the same transaction or occurrence as the claim in\n\nthe state court action, applies here.   The New Jersey Supreme\n\nCourt has directed courts to consider:\n          (1) whether the acts complained of and the demand for\n          relief are the same (that is, whether the wrong for\n          which redress is sought is the same in both actions);\n          (2) whether the theory of recovery is the same; (3)\n          whether the witnesses and documents necessary at trial\n          are the same (that is, whether the same evidence\n          necessary to maintain the second action would support\n          the first); and (4) whether the material facts alleged\n          are the same.\n\nCulver, 559 A.2d at 406 (citations omitted) (quoting United\n\nStates v. Athlone Indus., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"443222\"><a href=\"/opinion/443222/united-states-v-athlone-industries-inc-also-doing-business-as-dudley/\"><span class=\"volume\">746</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">977</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 984 (3d Cir. 1984)).     The\n\ndistrict court applied the criteria set forth in Culver and\n\nconcluded that Jones's federal action involved the same\n\ntransaction or occurrence as at issue in the earlier New Jersey\n\nSuperior Court action.\n\n           We believe that a persuasive argument can be made that\nneither the acts complained of nor the demand for relief in the\n\ntwo actions are the same.   In the first action, Jones challenged\n\nthe administrative determination of his guilt on the attempted\n\npossession of weapons charge; thus the acts at issue in that case\n\nwere those of Jones.   By contrast, in the federal action, Jones\n\nchallenges the conduct of the Department of Corrections'\n\nofficials in proceeding with the disciplinary hearing and\n\nsanctions \"knowing they had no just cause.\"   App. at 7.    Although\n\nthe district court was correct that whether plaintiff's right to\n\n\n                                6\n\fdue process was violated will be implicated in both cases, there\n\nare differences, albeit subtle, between the two actions.     Because\n\nwe believe another issue is dispositive, for our purposes we will\n\nassume that the district court did not err in finding the\n\nsimilarity requisite for application of res judicata.\n\n          Instead, we part with the district court in its\n\ndetermination that the New Jersey Superior Court Appellate\n\nDivision would have heard Jones's section 1983 claim as part of\n\nits review over the prison disciplinary action, had Jones\n\npresented it at that time.\n\n          It is unquestioned that state courts have concurrent\n\njurisdiction with federal courts to hear section 1983 claims. See\n\nMaine v. Thiboutot, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110322\"><a href=\"/opinion/110322/maine-v-thiboutot/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3 n.1 (1980).   However, under the\n\nentire controversy doctrine, a party will not be barred from\n\nraising claims that he could not have brought in the initial\n\naction.   As the New Jersey Supreme Court has stated, if\n           the court in the first action would clearly not have\n           had jurisdiction to entertain the omitted theory or\n           ground (or, having jurisdiction, would clearly have\n           declined to exercise it as a matter of discretion),\n           then a second action in a competent court presenting\n           the omitted theory or ground should not be held\n           precluded.\n\n\nWatkins, 591 A.2d at 599 (quoting Restatement (Second) of\nJudgments § 25 cmt. e (1982)); see also Culver, 559 A.2d at 406.\n\nThus, to invoke the principles of res judicata, the first court\n\nmust not only have had jurisdiction to hear the claim now sought\n\nto be precluded, but there must also be some likelihood that it\n\nwould have exercised that jurisdiction to hear that claim.\n\n\n\n                                7\n\f          Under New Jersey Rules of Appellate Practice 2:2-3(2),\n\nthe Appellate Division of the Superior Court has jurisdiction\n\nover appeals from administrative agencies.   New Jersey Rule of\n\nAppellate Practice 2:10-5 provides that \"[t]he appellate court\n\nmay exercise such original jurisdiction as is necessary to the\n\ncomplete determination of any matter on review.\"   This Rule was\n\nrelied upon by the district court in its decision that New Jersey\n\nlaw would not have barred Jones from raising his section 1983\n\nclaim at the time he appealed the administrative action to the\n\nAppellate Division.\n\n          The New Jersey courts have suggested that under this\n\nRule the appellate courts have jurisdiction to make factual\n\nfindings that ordinarily would be remanded to the trial courts\n\nwhen this is necessary to the complete determination of disputes\n\nbefore them.

In that case, the Court\n\ndetermined that the Appellate Division, in reviewing a challenge\n\nto a regulation of the Department of Public Welfare which varied\n\nthe amount of public assistance paid to employable versus\n\nunemployable persons, could exercise original jurisdiction to\n\ncompletely resolve the questions raised and decide the claim of\n\none of the appellants who had argued that the local welfare\n\ndirector's discretionary authority exceeded that provided by\n\nstatute, a claim that ordinarily would be brought in Juvenile and\n\nDomestic Relations Court.   See id. at 572-73.   The Pascucci court\n\ndetermined that because the Appellate Division had jurisdiction\n\nover the administrative proceedings, and because under Rule 2:10-\n\n5 it could \"exercise such original jurisdiction as is necessary\n\nto the complete determination of any matter on review,\" the\n\nAppellate Division could also hear the challenge that would\n\notherwise be heard in Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court.

The\n\nmajority of New Jersey cases applying Rule 2:10-5 represent\n\ninstances in which appellate courts, despite the absence of trial\n\ncourt findings, had an adequate factual basis in the record to\n\nresolve questions that were essential to the determination of the\n\nissues before them.

Ct. App. Div. 1991) (appellate court must not substitute\n\nown judgment for that of agency).\n\n          Based on our review of New Jersey cases, we predict\n\nthat a New Jersey appellate court faced with Jones's section 1983\n\nclaim at the time that it was evaluating his appeal of the\n\nadministrative sanctions imposed on him would not exercise\n\noriginal jurisdiction under Rule 2:10-5.\n\n           Our prediction that the New Jersey Appellate Division\n\ncourt would not have exercised jurisdiction over Jones's section\n\n1983 claim is based in part on the sparsity of his complaint.     He\n\nstates only that the named defendants denied him due process\n\n                               11\n\frights by instigating administrative proceedings against him\n\nknowing that they lacked the requisite just cause.   Analysis of\n\nthis claim would have required evidence not of record at the time\n\nof the appeal of the administrative ruling.   Because res judicata\n\ndoes not apply where a court \"having jurisdiction, would clearly\n\nhave declined to exercise it as a matter of discretion,\" Watkins,\n\n591 A.2d at 599 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 25\n\ncmt. e), and we conclude this is such a case, we cannot sustain\n\nthe district court's dismissal of Jones's complaint on that\n\nground.   Of course, we intimate no view as to whether there is\n\nany other facial defect in the pleading, as that issue was not\n\nconsidered by the district court.\n\n                               III.\n\n                            Conclusion\n          For the foregoing reasons, we will reverse the judgment\ndismissing Jones's complaint and remand for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion. Each party to bear its own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                12\n\f</pre>",
