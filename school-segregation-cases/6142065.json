Resilient as the city is, it swiftly began to\nrebuild.      That effort presented attractive opportunities for investors and\ndevelopers looking to turn a profit. This case involves one such opportunity\nthat went sour.\n        This lawsuit that followed resulted in a bench trial.                        One of the\ndefendants appeared at trial to fight the allegations; the other did not and\n                                                     2\n\f    Case: 16-30339      Document: 00514126837    Page: 3   Date Filed: 08/22/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 16-30339\n                   Cons w/ Nos. 16-30942, 16-31068, 16-31069\n\nwhether he was properly served is an issue on appeal. The district court found\nthat both defendants breached their agreement with plaintiffs to purchase,\nrenovate, and sell Katrina-damaged properties. It held Karry Causey, the\ndefendant who put up a defense, liable for $16,780. It found the defaulting\ndefendant, Garry Causey, further liable for breach of fiduciary duty and\nresponsible for $94,000. After that judgment issued, Garry finally appeared\nand sought to vacate the award alleging improper service. Both defendants\nsought to vacate the judgment on the additional ground that they believe the\nplaintiffs failed to adequately disclose the claim during their bankruptcy. The\ndistrict court denied those postjudgment motions and also awarded attorneys’\nfees and costs against the Causeys.\n        All these rulings are challenged as both sides appeal. Plaintiffs contend\nthe district court should have required both defendants to pay the full $94,000\nin damages. Defendants argue that the jurisdictional defects warrant vacating\nthe judgment, that in any event Karry did not breach the contract, and that\nthe fee award is excessive. We affirm the judgment in all respects as to Karry,\nbut remand for additional factfinding about the attempts to serve Garry.\n                                        I.\n        Joshua Norris, a plumber from Michigan, traveled to New Orleans in\nearly 2007 in search of work. There he met twin brothers Karry and Garry\nCausey. The Causeys proposed to Joshua and his wife, Jill, the following\ninvestment opportunity: the Norrises would supply funds to purchase\nhurricane-damaged properties and the Causeys would renovate those\nproperties and sell them at a profit. That profit would be evenly divided among\nthem.\n        Garry reduced this plan to writing. He and the Norrises signed the joint\nventure agreement. Karry did not.\n                                        3\n\f    Case: 16-30339     Document: 00514126837     Page: 4   Date Filed: 08/22/2017\n\n\n\n                                No. 16-30339\n                  Cons w/ Nos. 16-30942, 16-31068, 16-31069\n\n      The agreement divides responsibilities among the parties along the lines\nof the original understanding. The Norrises are to finance the project. Garry\nis responsible for, among other things, maintaining accounting records,\nidentifying and facilitating the purchase of properties, and negotiating with\ncontractors to obtain the best possible prices. Karry is the project manager.\n      To fulfill their end of the bargain, the Norrises obtained a home equity\nloan. From those funds, they wrote Garry one check for $48,000 and another\nfor $45,000. This money was supposed to be used for construction on two\nseparate properties. Garry wired Karry $15,780 of those funds. The Norrises\ngave Karry an additional $1,000 for architectural plans he said were needed.\n      Despite receiving these funds, the Causeys failed to move forward with\nthe renovations. They instead spent the money on personal items. After a few\nmonths, they also stopped paying the Norrises the interest accumulating on\ntheir home equity loan.\n      Inability to repay that loan led the Norrises to file for Chapter 7\nbankruptcy in 2009. The Norrises did not list their potential claim against the\nCauseys in their bankruptcy schedules. Before the issuance of the trustee’s\nfinal report, however, the claim began to appear in interim reports by the\ntrustee as “a potential lawsuit regarding LA property” with an estimated value\nof $1,000. The bankruptcy trustee’s final report expressly abandons this claim\nto the Norrises. See 11 U.S.C. § 554(c). That abandonment became final in\n2012 when the bankruptcy court approved the final report and closed the case.\n      The Norrises subsequently filed this lawsuit against the Causeys. Garry\nfailed to appear despite various efforts, described in more detail below, to serve\nhim. The district court thus found Garry in default. Karry, on the other hand,\nappeared and actively defended against the Norrises allegations in a one-day\nbench trial.\n                                        4\n\f     Case: 16-30339       Document: 00514126837         Page: 5    Date Filed: 08/22/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 16-30339\n                    Cons w/ Nos. 16-30942, 16-31068, 16-31069\n\n       That trial resulted in the district court’s entering default judgment\nagainst Garry on breach of contract and fiduciary duty claims and ordering\nhim to pay $94,000 in damages. The district court also found Karry tacitly\naccepted the contract and likewise breached. But it held him liable for only\n$15,780—the amount Garry wired him that Karry used for his own benefit.\n       The Norrises subsequently filed a motion for attorneys’ fees and a motion\nto amend the final judgment. The district court awarded $58,736 in attorneys’\nfees and costs, holding Garry and Karry solidarily liable for the full amount.\nAnd despite disagreeing with the Norrises’ arguments for holding Karry\nsolidarily liable for the full damages award, it added $1,000 in damages to\naccount for the check Karry received for architectural plans. Karry filed a\nnotice of appeal. The Norrises filed a cross appeal.\n       Following the commencement of these appeals, the bankruptcy court in\nthe Eastern District of Michigan reopened the Norrises’ case, stating “it\nappear[s] that Debtors may have intentionally [misled] the Court as to their\nassets and said asset appears to be an asset of the Debtor's Estate.” 1\n       After that bankruptcy court activity, and approximately four months\nafter the New Orleans district court issued its final judgment, the Causeys\nfiled separate motions under Rule 60(b)(4) seeking to set aside the judgment\nas void. This was the first time Garry appeared in the case.\n       Both Causeys argued that the Norrises did not have standing as failure\nto disclose the claim in bankruptcy meant abandonment of the claim was\n\n\n\n\n       1 The parties report no further action in the bankruptcy court. The docket sheet shows\nthe trustee has since filed one interim report, one semiannual report, and one annual report.\nIn re Norris, 2:09-bk-68137 (Bankr. E.D. Mich.). All list this lawsuit as an asset. Id. The\nlast report estimates the lawsuit’s value at $170,000. Id.\n                                             5\n\f     Case: 16-30339      Document: 00514126837        Page: 6    Date Filed: 08/22/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 16-30339\n                   Cons w/ Nos. 16-30942, 16-31068, 16-31069\n\nimproper and the trustee should be considered the real party in interest.\nGarry separately argued that he was not properly served.\n      The district court agreed with the Causeys that the Norrises were not\nthe proper plaintiffs. But because real-party-in-interest is not a jurisdictional\nrequirement, it denied relief, ordering instead that the trustee could substitute\nas the plaintiff. The district court further found that Garry was properly\nserved.\n                                           II.\n      We start our review at the end of the district court litigation, with the\ndenial of the Rule 60(b)(4) motions. We do so because if those motions should\nhave been granted, then the judgment would be void and there would be no\nneed to review the merits.\n      We first consider the Rule 60(b) ground that would vacate the judgment\nas to both defendants: the argument that the Norrises lack standing because\nthey did not disclose this claim during their bankruptcy. The district court’s\nruling on this issue is subject to cross appeals. This is because, although the\ndistrict court did not void the judgment, it held that the Norrises are not the\nreal parties in interest and the bankruptcy trustee could substitute in. The\nCauseys argue that the district court did not go far enough; it recognized the\nreal-party-in-interest problem but did not see that through to voiding the\njudgment. The Norrises contend the district court went too far; whether they\nor the trustee was the proper party is not a question the court should consider\nat all in a motion for postjudgment relief. They also argue that the Rule 60\nmotions were untimely. 2\n\n\n      2 The Norrises similarly argue the appeals were untimely. But that is not so. Though\nthe timelines are somewhat convoluted given the multiple posttrial motions, the Causeys\ncomplied with the deadlines. FED. R. CIV. P. 59(b) (28 days after entry of judgment); Id.\n                                            6\n\f     Case: 16-30339       Document: 00514126837          Page: 7     Date Filed: 08/22/2017\n\n\n\n                                   No. 16-30339\n                     Cons w/ Nos. 16-30942, 16-31068, 16-31069\n\n                                              A.\n       For starters, there is no timeliness problem with the motions seeking\nrelief from the judgment. Because a “void judgment cannot acquire validity”\nthrough the passage of time, Rule 60(b)(4) motions have no time limit. 11\nCharles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, & Mary Kay Kane, FEDERAL PRACTICE\n& PROCEDURE, § 2862 (3d ed.); Jackson v. FIE Corp., 302 F.3d 515, 523 (5th\nCir. 2002).\n       Nor is it a problem that Karry’s motion was brought after his having\nappealed the final judgment. A party may seek Rule 60(b) relief after filing a\nnotice of appeal. Lopez Dominguez v. Gulf Coast Marine & Assoc., Inc., 607\nF.3d 1066, 1073–74 (5th Cir. 2010). The complication is that a district court\nmay not grant the motion and vacate the judgment while an appeal is pending.\nId. If the district court is inclined to do so, it may notify the litigant who can\nthen ask the court of appeals for a remand. In contrast, the pendency of an\nappeal does not deprive the district court of the authority it exercised here to\ndeny a Rule 60 motion. Id. (citing Winchester v. U.S. Attorney for Southern\nDist. of Texas, 68 F.3d 947, 949 (5th Cir. 1995)).\n                                              B.\n       As the Rule 60(b)(4) motions were timely, we consider whether they\nestablished one of the rare defects that renders a judgment void. United\nStudent Aid Funds, Inc. v. Espinosa, 559 U.S. 260, 270 (2010).                            The\n“exceedingly short” list of such “infirmities” includes only subject matter\n\n\n60(c)(1) (within a reasonable time after the entry of judgment); FED. R. APP. P. 4(a)(1)(A) (30\ndays after entry of the judgment). Karry timely filed his appeal of the judgment and both\nCauseys timely appealed the denials of their Rule 60(b) motions. Those separate appeals are\nconsolidated. We do not understand the Norrises’ complaint that the appeals of the Rule\n60(b) denials somehow improperly extended Karry’s appeal of the underlying judgment. The\nseparate appeals focus on distinct issues: (1) Karry’s appeal on his liability and (2) the Rule\n60(b) appeals on “standing” and personal jurisdiction.\n                                              7\n\f    Case: 16-30339     Document: 00514126837       Page: 8   Date Filed: 08/22/2017\n\n\n\n                                No. 16-30339\n                  Cons w/ Nos. 16-30942, 16-31068, 16-31069\n\njurisdiction, personal jurisdiction, “or [ ] a violation of due process that deprives\na party of notice or the opportunity to be heard.” Id. The Causeys try to fit\ntheir alleged error into the jurisdictional bucket, characterizing the question\nwhether the Norrises or bankruptcy estate possess the claims against them as\none of “standing.”\n      Standing    of   the   constitutional   variety—the     well-known     injury,\ncausation, and redressability trifecta—is a question of subject matter\njurisdiction. Sprint Commc’ns. Co. v. APCC Servs. Inc., 554 U.S. 269, 273\n(2008) (“Th[e] case-or-controversy requirement is satisfied only where a\nplaintiff has standing.”). But a lack of Article III standing is neither the\nchallenge the Causeys bring nor one they would prevail on. The Norrises’\ninjury is clear: they lost thousands of dollars.       They argue that Causeys’\ndiversion of funds caused that injury. And this litigation can redress the loss\nthrough damages, as the judgment demonstrates.\n      The “standing” label is also sometimes placed on the real-party-in-\ninterest challenge the Causeys do assert. See Wieburg v. GTE Southwest Inc.,\n272 F.3d 302, 306 (5th Cir. 2001) (“Because the claims are property of the\nbankruptcy estate, the Trustee is the real party in interest with exclusive\nstanding to assert them.”); Rideau v. Keller Indep. Sch. Dist., 819 F.3d 155, 163\nn.7 (5th Cir. 2016) (noting that “the intermingling of standing and capacity\nissues is not uncommon”) (citing William V. Dorsaneo III, The Enigma of\nStanding Doctrine in Texas Courts, 28 REV. LITIG. 35, 65 (2008)); In re Unger\n& Assocs. Inc., 292 B.R. 545, 550 (Bankr. E.D. Tex. 2003) (“Frequently,\nattorneys and courts confuse the concepts of standing with that of capacity to\nsue and with the real party in interest principle.”). Despite this cross labeling,\nthere is a key jurisdictional distinction between a challenge that a plaintiff\nlacks Article III standing and one that she is not the real party in interest. The\n                                         8\n\f    Case: 16-30339     Document: 00514126837      Page: 9   Date Filed: 08/22/2017\n\n\n\n                                No. 16-30339\n                  Cons w/ Nos. 16-30942, 16-31068, 16-31069\n\nlatter presents a merits question: “who, according to the governing substantive\nlaw, is entitled to enforce the right?” 6A Wright & Miller, supra, § 1543. It is\nthus like contractual or statutory standing and does not go to a court’s subject\nmatter jurisdiction.     See id. § 1542 (stating that real-party-in-interest\n“typically is deemed a prudential, rather than a constitutional [issue]”); Dunn\nv. Advanced Med. Specialties, Inc., 556 F. App’x 785, 789–90 (11th Cir. 2014)\n(noting that “the principle of real party in interest . . . does not impact the\ncourt’s subject matter jurisdiction”).\n      The nonjurisdictional nature of real-party-in-interest challenges is\nevident from the procedure for raising such an objection. An argument that\nthe plaintiff is not the real party in interest is an affirmative defense that must\nbe asserted with reasonable promptness. In re Signal Int’l, LLC, 579 F.3d 478,\n487–88 (5th Cir. 2009). This typically requires that it be raised ahead of trial.\n6A Wright & Miller, supra, § 1554. In contrast, a problem with subject matter\njurisdiction cannot be waived—that is why it can serve as a ground to void a\njudgment via Rule 60(b)(4) long after the case ends. In another feature not\ntypical of defects in subject matter jurisdiction, Rule 17(a)(3) states that a case\nmay not be dismissed for a “failure to prosecute in the name of the real party\ninterest until, after an objection, a reasonable time has been allowed” for the\nproper party to “substitute[ ] into the action.” FED. R. CIV. P. 17(a)(3).\n      Courts have recognized this distinction between Article III standing and\nreal-party-in-interest/capacity issues in holding that an assignment does not\nerase constitutional injury, see Cranpark Inc. v. Rogers Group Inc., 821 F.3d\n723, 730 (6th Cir. 2016) (concluding that “one who sells his interest in a cause\nof action is not deprived of Article III standing” but “is susceptible to a real-\nparty-in-interest challenge”), and that parents can suffer a financial injury\nfrom their child’s hardship even when they are not the proper party to sue in\n                                         9\n\f    Case: 16-30339       Document: 00514126837         Page: 10     Date Filed: 08/22/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 16-30339\n                    Cons w/ Nos. 16-30942, 16-31068, 16-31069\n\nhis name, see Rideau, 819 F.3d at 163 (recognizing that parents who had\nArticle III standing to sue nonetheless lacked capacity to sue on their child’s\nbehalf because a different guardian had been appointed). More generally, that\nthe Norrises may not ultimately be entitled to the damages awarded does not\nchange that the relief sought redresses an injury they suffered. See Sprint,\n554 U.S. at 287 (holding that it is irrelevant that the plaintiff would give all\nwinnings to another party because the sole question is “whether the injury that\na plaintiff alleges is likely to be redressed through the litigation”). This means\nthat even if the Causeys are correct that the trustee should have brought this\nsuit, 3 that would not entitle them relief under Rule 60(b)(4). See Dunn, 556 F.\nApp’x at 789–90 (rejecting a Rule 60(b)(4) motion challenging real-party-in-\ninterest status for the same reason).\n       The district court recognized as much in holding that this argument did\nnot raise the jurisdictional defects that support vacating a judgment. Yet it\nalso ruled that the trustee could replace the Norrises as plaintiffs at this late\njuncture. But the inapplicability of Rule 60(b)(4) means the Causeys have\ninvoked no postjudgment vehicle that allows replacing the Norrises with the\ntrustee.    And as we have already explained, challenges to real-party-in-\ninterest status can be forfeited even when raised prior to entry of judgment,\nsuch as when a defendant waits to raise the issue until the eve of trial. See In\nre Signal, 579 F.3d at 487–88; see also 6A Wright & Miller, supra, § 1554. So\n\n\n\n       3  Because of the improper procedural posture in which this real-party-in-interest\nquestion was raised, we have no occasion to address whether the Norrises’ bankruptcy court\ndisclosure was sufficient or, if it was not, whether the bankruptcy court’s abandonment can\nbe undone in this separate litigation. Judicial estoppel is also sometimes argued when a\nparty pursues a claim that it did not disclose in bankruptcy, see, e.g., Love v. Tyson Foods,\nInc., 677 F.3d 258, 261–62 (5th Cir. 2012), but that equitable doctrine does not raise a\njurisdictional question. So the Causeys failure to timely raise estoppel again means we\ncannot address it.\n                                             10\n\f    Case: 16-30339      Document: 00514126837        Page: 11     Date Filed: 08/22/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 16-30339\n                   Cons w/ Nos. 16-30942, 16-31068, 16-31069\n\nthe Causeys’ raising this challenge only after the court entered judgment was\ntoo late. 4 The district court should have stopped with its correct observation\nthat an alleged real-party-in-interest problem is not a jurisdictional defect that\ncan overcome the strong interest in finality of judgments. If the rest of this\nopinion affirms the judgment, then it remains with the Norrises who acquired\nthis action through the bankruptcy court’s express abandonment of it to them.\n                                           C.\n      In contrast, Garry does raise an issue that goes to the power of the\ndistrict court to enter a judgment against him: whether he was properly served.\nThompson v. Deutsche Bank Nat’l Trust Co., 775 F.3d 298, 306 (5th Cir. 2014).\nThe Norrises contend this argument also falls outside Rule 60(b)(4) because\ntechnically deficient service may not rise to the level of a due process violation.\nBut this argument need not fit in Rule 60(b)(4)’s “due process” category.\nDeficient service means a court lacked personal jurisdiction over a defendant,\nand lack of personal jurisdiction is an independent basis for voiding a\njudgment. Harper Macleod Solicitors v. Keaty & Keaty, 260 F.3d 389, 393 (5th\nCir. 2001) (“[A] district court must set aside a default judgment as void if it\ndetermines that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant because of\ndefective service of process.”).\n      We thus must decide whether Garry was served in accordance with\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 4. Rule 4 allows serving an individual by\nfollowing either: (1) the law of the state where the suit is brought (Louisiana);\n(2) the law of the state where service is made (New Mexico); or (3) the methods\nlisted in Rule 4 itself. FED. R. CIV. P. 4(e)(1). All three allow substituted\n\n\n\n      4 Karry suggested a real-party-in-interest problem ahead of trial but decided not to\npursue it then.\n                                           11\n\f    Case: 16-30339    Document: 00514126837      Page: 12   Date Filed: 08/22/2017\n\n\n\n                                No. 16-30339\n                  Cons w/ Nos. 16-30942, 16-31068, 16-31069\n\nservice. Such service entails leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at\nthe individual’s usual place of abode with someone of suitable age and\ndiscretion. Id.; LA. CODE CIV. PROC. ANN. art. 1234; NMRA, Rule 1-004(F)(2).\n                                        1.\n      Garry first contends that service was improper because the address in\nNew Mexico where the Norrises tried to serve him was not his place of abode\nat the time. The district court’s factual finding to the contrary is reviewed for\nclear error. Goetz v. Synthesys Tech., Inc., 415 F.3d 481, 483 n.3 (5th Cir. 2005).\n      There is ample support for the district court’s determination. The New\nMexico address appears as Garry’s residence in litigation documents, pay\nstubs, property tax forms, and affidavits. On top of all this, Karry testified\nthat the New Mexico home is where Garry’s wife lives, where Garry raised his\nkids, and Garry’s address as far as he knows.\n      Garry responds by pointing to his and his wife’s affidavits saying he has\nbeen living in Denver since 2010—five years prior to service being first\nattempted in New Mexico. He notes that a sign outside the home said Garry’s\nmail should be forwarded. And he offers three bills from 2016 listing a Denver\naddress.\n      But this effort fails for two reasons. First, the standard of review means\nthat even if Garry has shown that the location of his place of abode was\ndebatable, we defer to the district court’s conclusion. Anderson v. City of\nBessemer City, N.C., 470 U.S. 564, 573 (1985). Garry’s argument also assumes\nhe can only have one usual place of abode. But a person can have two or more\nsuch places, provided each contains sufficient indicia of permanence. Nat’l\nDev. Co. v. Triad Holding Corp., 930 F.2d 253, 257 (2d Cir. 1991); see also\nWright & Miller, supra, § 1096. This is true of the New Mexico residence. See\nPeriodical Publishers' Serv. Bureau, Inc. v. Keys, 1992 WL 298003, at *7 (E.D.\n                                        12\n\f    Case: 16-30339         Document: 00514126837           Page: 13      Date Filed: 08/22/2017\n\n\n\n                                    No. 16-30339\n                      Cons w/ Nos. 16-30942, 16-31068, 16-31069\n\nLa. Oct. 7, 1992) (concluding a second residence had sufficient indicia of\npermanence as defendant’s “wife resides there, he does not state that he is\nlegally separated or divorced from her, [and] he did actually reside there within\nthree days of service”). The district court did not err in finding that the New\nMexico home was a place where Garry could be served. 5\n                                                2.\n       Even if the New Mexico residence is Garry’s usual place of abode,\nanother question remains: Was posting the complaint and summons on the\ndoor of that residence proper service under Rule 4? The district court held that\nit was. As support, it cited Vann Tool Co. v. Grace, 566 P.2d 93 (N.M. 1977).\nVan Tool says that posting a summons and complaint on a defendant’s door is\nproper if no person is found willing to accept service.                      Id. at 94.      That\nobservation, however, relies on an outdated version of the New Mexico rules\nthat allowed service in that manner. Id. That rule was revised in 2004 to\neliminate “post and mail” service in favor of service at the place of\nemployment. 6 See UMG Recordings, Inc. v. Montoya, 2009 WL 1300361, at *2\nn.1 (D.N.M. Jan. 30, 2009) (noting the change to Rule 1-004(F)).\n\n\n       5   Garry also argues that the district court erroneously relied on the “outward\nappearances” doctrine in finding he could be served at the Albuquerque address. See NLRB\nv. Clark, 468 F.2d 459, 464 (5th Cir. 1972) (holding that when a defendant “has in fact\nchanged his residence but to all appearances is still occupying a former dwelling, substituted\nservice at the former dwelling is proper”) (emphasis added). But this misconstrues the\ndistrict court’s reliance on Clark. The district court cites it for the proposition that a plaintiff\nmay rely on a defendant’s outward representations in concluding a residence is his usual\nplace of abode. Consideration of such representations is not improper. Indeed, we have said\nthat “no hard and fast rule can be fashioned to determine what is or is not a party’s ‘dwelling\nhouse or usual place of abode’ within the rule’s meaning; rather the practicalities of the\nparticular fact situation determine whether service meets the requirements of [Rule 4].”\nNowell v. Nowell, 384 F.2d 951, 953 (5th Cir. 1967). The district court’s reliance on Garry’s\noutward representations regarding the New Mexico residence was just that: assessing the\npracticalities of the particular fact situation to determine whether service was proper.\n        6 “Rule 1-004(F)(1) formerly provided that if no qualified person was at the usual place\n\nof abode to accept service of process, service could be made by posting process at the abode\n                                                13\n\f    Case: 16-30339        Document: 00514126837          Page: 14     Date Filed: 08/22/2017\n\n\n\n                                   No. 16-30339\n                     Cons w/ Nos. 16-30942, 16-31068, 16-31069\n\n         The Norrises’ failure to comply with New Mexico’s requirements for\nservice does not end our inquiry. Given the multiples sources that Rule 4\nconsiders in determining if service is proper, we look to whether federal or\nLouisiana law allows service by posting on the door. The answer turns on what\nhappened the day the complaint was posted on the New Mexico house.\n         The process server’s affidavit says she attempted to serve Garry at his\nNew Mexico residence numerous times. But, she says, neither Garry nor his\nwife voluntarily opened the door to accept service at any point. She then notes\nthat “[o]n another occasion, Garry Causey’s wife yelled through the door that\nshe would not accept service . . . .” The affidavit then says that “[s]ervice was\nsubsequently made on February 2, 2015 by posting the [documents] to the front\ndoor.”\n         The district court’s reliance on New Mexico’s since-repealed service\nrule—the one allowing posting and mailing even without anyone being present\nor avoiding service—meant it did not believe it mattered whether Garry’s wife\nyelling through the door and the posting of the documents happened on the\nsame day. So the district court did not make a clear finding as to this timing\nquestion. The district court says, for example, that the “process server left a\ncopy of the summons and complaint outside the Albuquerque residence after\nGarry Causey’s wife refused to accept service” without detailing how soon\nafter. It likewise later says that “Garry Causey’s wife refused service, so the\nprocess server posted the summons and complaint on the front door”—again\nwithout clearly stating whether both events took place the same day.\n\n\nand then mailing a copy of the process to the last known mailing address. This alternative\nmethod of service has been omitted in the 2004 amendment.” NMRA, Rule 1-004(F)\n(committee commentary). The 2004 Amendment further establishes a “hierarchy of methods\nof service” which did not before exist, id., meaning that previously a plaintiff did not have to\nmake prior attempts at service before resorting to the “post and mail” method.\n                                              14\n\f   Case: 16-30339     Document: 00514126837     Page: 15   Date Filed: 08/22/2017\n\n\n\n                               No. 16-30339\n                 Cons w/ Nos. 16-30942, 16-31068, 16-31069\n\n      It turns out that whether the yelling and posting happened the same day\nmatters a great deal. Leaving a summons and complaint at a residence door,\nunaccompanied by a refusal to accept service, is not effective service under\nRule 4. See German Am. Fin. Advisors & Trust Co. v. Rigsby, 623 F. App’x 806,\n808 (7th Cir. 2015) (“[L]eaving the papers on the defendant’s door is not enough\nto constitute valid service . . . .”); Coffin v. Ingersoll, 1993 WL 208806, at *2\n(E.D. Pa. June 11, 1993) (same). Louisiana law likewise does not allow service\nin that manner. LA. CODE CIV. PROC. ANN. art. 1231. This means that if\nGarry’s wife was not present, let alone refusing service, on the day the process\nserver posted the documents on the door, Garry’s service was likely defective.\n      On the other hand, a defendant’s refusal to accept service is not rewarded\nwhen the process server announces the nature of the documents and leaves\nthem in close proximity to the defiant defendant. 4A Wright & Miller, supra,\n§ 1095 (citing Rule 4(e)(2)(A) and collecting cases). And, contrary to Garry’s\ncontention, that doctrine has been extended to cases involving substituted\nservice on a family member. See Fed. Fin. Co. v. Longiotti, 164 F.R.D. 419,\n421–22 (E.D.N.C. 1996) (concluding service was proper when server left legal\ndocuments at doorstep after defendant’s wife refused to accept them);\nPeriodical Publishers’ Service Bureau, 1992 WL 298003, at *6–7 (same);\nConwill v. Greenberg Traurig, LLP, 2010 WL 2773239, *5 (E.D. La. Jul. 13,\n2010) (same). So if Garry’s wife was present and refusing service the day of\nthe posting, leaving the summons on the door may have qualified as the\npermissible “substituted service” of leaving the documents with someone of\nsuitable age and discretion.\n      Garry urges us to find that his wife’s avoidance of service and the posting\nof the documents on the door were two separate incidents, rule service was\nimproper, and void the judgment. His view of the timing may be the most\n                                       15\n\f    Case: 16-30339       Document: 00514126837          Page: 16     Date Filed: 08/22/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 16-30339\n                    Cons w/ Nos. 16-30942, 16-31068, 16-31069\n\nnatural reading of the process server’s affidavit. But because both the affidavit\nand the district court’s findings are susceptible to different interpretations and\nmore evidence may be warranted on this question, the wiser route is to remand\nto allow the district court to make this finding in the first instance.\n       If the district court concludes the documents were not posted on the door\nthe same day Garry’s wife was home and refused service, it may also engage\nin additional factfinding about its alternative ruling that service was proper\nunder a “good faith” theory.          We cannot review that holding now for two\nreasons. For one thing, the finding that the plaintiffs engaged in good faith\nefforts to serve Garry may be influenced by the clarification we seek on remand\nabout the extent of the process server’s efforts. For another, the district court\nseemed to believe a finding of good faith does not require actual notice. It said\nonly that “the record reveals that Garry likely had actual notice of the lawsuit.”\nWe have never considered the “good faith” rule that some district courts have\nadopted and do not do so here given the need for a remand on factual issues.\nSee, e.g., Conwill, 2010 WL 2773239, *3–5 (“Where the defendant receives\nactual notice and the plaintiff makes a good faith effort to serve the defendant\npursuant to the federal rule, service of process has been effective.”). But at a\nminimum the cases adopting that theory seem to permit it only when a\ndefendant had actual notice of the suit. 7              See, e.g., Ali v. Mid-Atlantic\nSettlement Servs., Inc., 233 F.R.D. 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2006) (prefacing the rule as\nwith when “[a] defendant receives actual notice”).\n       We therefore remand the service issue for additional factfinding.\n\n\n\n\n       7  Although the court did not make a finding that Garry had actual notice, there is\nevidence to that effect. Most notably, Garry’s brother and business partner (Karry) said there\nis “[n]o question [Garry] is aware of [this lawsuit]”.\n                                             16\n\f    Case: 16-30339      Document: 00514126837         Page: 17    Date Filed: 08/22/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 16-30339\n                    Cons w/ Nos. 16-30942, 16-31068, 16-31069\n\n                                           III.\n       Because we do not find any Rule 60(b) basis to void the judgment entered\nagainst Karry, we consider the merits of the district court’s rulings as to him.\nKarry asserts he could not have breached the joint venture agreement because\nhe never accepted it. 8 The Norrises contend they should have received more\ndamages: lost profits as well as Karry being held liable for the full amount of\ntheir funds that were not invested or returned.\n                                            A.\n       The district court found that Karry tacitly accepted the joint venture\nagreement. Karry fails to show this finding is clearly erroneous. The trial\ntestimony reveals Karry approached the Norrises about a possible joint\nventure; had discussions with them about the venture before the agreement\nwas written; agreed to act as the project manager and share in any profits;\nknew Garry sent the written agreement to the Norrises to sign; and accepted\nand spent money given to him by Garry that he knew came from the Norrises.\nThis is more than enough to support a conclusion that Karry tacitly consented.\nLA. CIV. CODE ANN. art. 1843 (“Tacit ratification results when a person, with\nknowledge of an obligation incurred on his behalf by another, accepts the\nbenefit of that obligation.”); see also Zeller v. Webre, 17 So. 3d 55, 58 (La. App.\n5 Cir. 2009).\n                                            B.\n      Although it held that Karry was liable for breaching the joint venture\nagreement, the district court declined to award lost profits as damages for that\nbreach. Lost profits must be proved with reasonable certainty, meaning they\n\n\n\n      8  Karry also alleges the bankruptcy court’s discharge of the Norrises extinguished\ntheir cause of action under the agreement. His failure to raise this issue below waives it.\n                                            17\n\f   Case: 16-30339      Document: 00514126837     Page: 18    Date Filed: 08/22/2017\n\n\n\n                                No. 16-30339\n                  Cons w/ Nos. 16-30942, 16-31068, 16-31069\n\nmay not rest on speculation. Al Smith's Plumbing & Heating Serv., Inc. v.\nRiver Crest, Inc., 365 So. 2d 1122, 1126 (La. App. 4 Cir. 1978). The district\ncourt is given considerable discretion in assessing the amount, if any, of\nuncertain lost profits. LA. CIV. CODE ANN. art. 1999.\n       Although the Norrises hoped the joint venture would result in profits,\nthey did not adequately quantify those losses at trial. White Haute, LLC v.\nMayo, 38 So. 3d 944, 953 (La. App. 5 Cir. 2010) (noting that an expectation that\na venture would be profitable alone does not suffice to warrant a lost profits\naward). As the joint venture was a new enterprise, the Norrises point to\nKarry’s testimony showing he earned profits from redeveloping other\nproperties, and the later redevelopment of one of the properties that is the\nsubject of this litigation. But that evidence, without more, fails to bridge the\ngap.   That is because profiting from a redevelopment depends on many\ncontingencies such as costs, timely construction, and market conditions. See\nAl Smith’s, 365 So. 2d at 1125–26 (vacating an award of lost profits because\nthe amount of losses attributable to a plumbing company that delayed a project\nwere indeterminable given that other contingencies may have added to the\ndelay). And the Norrises did not detail the similarity of those undertakings to\nthe one envisaged by the joint venture agreement, let alone the finances of\nthese purportedly comparable projects. As such, the district court did not\nabuse its discretion in refusing to award lost profits.\n                                        C.\n       The last of the contested breach of contract rulings is the district court’s\ndetermination that Karry is liable for only $16,780 of the $94,000 it awarded\nin damages to the Norrises.\n       The Norrises cite two reasons Karry should be liable for the full damages\naward: (1) although Karry’s and Garry’s obligations under the agreement are\n                                        18\n\f   Case: 16-30339     Document: 00514126837     Page: 19   Date Filed: 08/22/2017\n\n\n\n                               No. 16-30339\n                 Cons w/ Nos. 16-30942, 16-31068, 16-31069\n\nseparate, their respective breaches combined to cause the same loss: the failure\nof the joint venture; and (2) Karry conspired with Garry to breach the contract\nand conspirators are liable for all injuries resulting from the conspiracy.\nNeither argument supports reversal.\n      The Norrises correctly recite the Louisiana rule holding several obligors\nsolidarily liable—meaning each is responsible for the entire loss—when their\nbreaches combine to cause an item of damages for which each obligor would be\nentirely liable if she had acted alone. Stonecipher v. Mitchell, 655 So. 2d 1381,\n1386 (La. App. 2 Cir. 1995). This rule is driven not by the source of the\nobligations or the nature of the ensuing harm but by the coextensiveness of\nliability—that is, it applies when each obligor would be independently liable\nfor the entirety of the damages. See id. at 1386 (“It is the coextensiveness of\nthe obligations for the same debt, and not the source of liability, which\ndetermines the solidarity of the obligation.”) (internal citations omitted);\nRivnor Properties v. Herbert O'Donnell, Inc., 633 So. 2d 735, 748 (La. App. 5\nCir. 1994) (same).   The quintessential case involves subcontractors whose\nindividual shortcomings lead to an entire project being scrapped. An example\nis two roofers who caused separate defects—one a leaky roof; the other a\nwrinkly roof—each of which on its own would have required a new roof.\nStandard Roofing Co. of New Orleans v. Elliot Constr. Co., 535 So. 2d 870, 882\n(La. App. 1 Cir. 1988).\n      This is not true of the liability here. Karry’s misconduct—using the\n$15,780 and $1,000 checks for his own benefit—did not cause all the funds to\nbe misappropriated. Stonecipher, 655 So. 2d at 1386 (explaining that the focal\npoint of the solidary liability inquiry is whether the parties’ conduct “combined\nand contributed to cause the same item of damages”); see also Rivnor, 633 So.\n2d at 748 (same); Sanders v. Zeagler, 670 So. 2d 748, 760 (La.

Put another way, if Garry had\nfollowed through on his obligations under the contract, the Norrises’ only loss\nwould have been the funds Karry used for personal expenses. In contrast, had\nlost profits been proved, the entirety of those damages may have been\nattributable solely to Karry’s misconduct as diverting even a portion of the\nfunds may have prevented a successful renovation. But the district court did\nnot award lost profits. So it did not err in holding Karry solidarily liable only\nfor the portion of the damages attributable to his wrongdoing.\n      The Norrises are also right that Louisiana makes one “who conspires\nwith another to commit an intentional or willful act [ ] answerable, in solido,\nwith that person, for the damages caused by such act.” LA. CIV. CODE ANN. art.\n2324(A). The problem for the Norrises is that they did not ask the trial court\nto make a finding of conspiracy. We do not make that type of determination in\nthe first instance, especially one that turns on intent for which credibility plays\na big role. Homoki v. Conversion Servs, Inc., 717 F.3d 388 (5th Cir. 2013), does\nnot say otherwise. It notes that a failure to obtain a jury finding on damages\ncaused by a conspiracy, which the jury found existed, does not bar imposing\nsolidary liability on the conspirators if the evidence conclusively establishes\nthe damages are the same for the conspiracy and the underlying offense. Id.\nat 405. That is quite different than making a conspiracy finding in the first\ninstance on appeal. Karry thus cannot be held solidarily liable for the $94,000\non account of his purportedly conspiring with his brother.\n                                       IV.\n      We lastly address the challenge to the award of attorneys’ fees and costs.\nWe review such an award for abuse of discretion, evaluating underlying legal\ndeterminations de novo and factual determinations for clear error.

Id. at 539.\n       The joint venture agreement provides that “the prevailing party” in any\naction arising out of the agreement “shall be awarded . . . costs . . . [and]\nreasonable attorneys’ fees.” See Cajun Concrete Servs, Inc. v. J. Caldarera &\nCo., 759 So. 2d 237, 240 (La. App. 5 Cir. 2000) (allowing recovery of attorneys’\nfees when they are authorized by contract). As the parties who obtained\naffirmative relief—at least as to Karry whose liability we have affirmed 9—the\nNorrises are the prevailing party. Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 111–12\n(1992).\n       Karry argues that even if this is the case, the district court erred in\nmaking him liable for the full amount of fees and costs incurred.                          His\narguments on this point are largely conclusory and difficult to decipher. He\nessentially contends the award is either excessive or unreasonable as to him. 10\n       Karry says that holding him liable for the full $58,736.53 in attorneys’\nfees and costs is excessive because that amount is three-and-a-half times the\namount of damages he was ordered to pay. But Louisiana courts frequently\n\n\n       9  Garry’s only claim to attorneys’ fees and costs depends on him winning his Rule 60(b)\nmotion on remand. In the event that happens, the court can at that time consider his\nentitlement to fees. And Karry’s request for fees was contingent on him prevailing on his\narguments we have already rejected.\n        10 Karry styles the header in his brief challenging the attorneys’ fees award as, “The\n\ndistrict court erred by ruling that [he] is solidarily liable for all of the Norrises’ costs and\nattorney fees.” But the arguments he advances and the cases he cites all speak to the award\nbeing either excessive or unreasonable. Because he neither advances an argument\nchallenging the district court’s imposition of solidary liability on fees nor offers case law in\nsupport of it, we hold that he forfetied any such claim. Weaver v. Puckett, 896 F.2d 126, 128\n(5th Cir. 1990) (noting that a failure to adequately brief an issue constitutes abandonment);\nFED. R. APP.

These awards\nare upheld when the “amount of time and effort to collect the amount due from\ndefendant warranted the [awards].” Perrier, 66 So. 3d at 1149. That is also\nthe case here. The overall amount, well below $100,000, is not on its face\nexcessive for a federal lawsuit that results in a trial (albeit a brief bench trial)\nand involves some of the challenging legal questions with which this opinion\ngrapples. And the result obtained is only one of ten factors Louisiana courts\nconsider in assessing the reasonableness of a fee award. State, Dept. of Transp.\nand Dev. v. Williamson, 597 So. 2d 439, 442 (1992). Other factors include the\namount of money at stake (much more than the amount Karry was ordered to\npay given the colorable arguments for lost profits and holding Karry\nresponsible for the full amount misappropriated), the extent and character of\nthe work done, and the number of appearances. Id. Just about all of the work\nthe Norrises’ attorneys undertook was devoted to the case against Karry as\nGarry did not appear to defend at trial. 11        All things considered, the district\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in awarding the fees and costs.\n\n\n\n\n       11 The posttrial work responding to Garry’s Rule 60(b) motion was not included in the\nfee award. As for the amounts spent attempting to serve Garry ahead of trial, Karry’s appeal\ndoes not challenge any failure to segregate fees. Rather, it focuses on the fee amount being\ndisproportionate to the damages recovered. That implicates only the question whether the\ndistrict court abused its discretion in concluding the amount was reasonable. HDRE Bus.\nPartners Ltd. Group, LLC v. RARE Hosp.

Resilient as the city is, it swiftly began to\nrebuild.      That effort presented attractive opportunities for investors and\ndevelopers looking to turn a profit. This case involves one such opportunity\nthat went sour.\n        This lawsuit that followed resulted in a bench trial.                        One of the\ndefendants appeared at trial to fight the allegations; the other did not and\n                                                     2\n\f    Case: 16-30339      Document: 00514126837    Page: 3   Date Filed: 08/22/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 16-30339\n                   Cons w/ Nos. 16-30942, 16-31068, 16-31069\n\nwhether he was properly served is an issue on appeal. The district court found\nthat both defendants breached their agreement with plaintiffs to purchase,\nrenovate, and sell Katrina-damaged properties. It held Karry Causey, the\ndefendant who put up a defense, liable for $16,780. It found the defaulting\ndefendant, Garry Causey, further liable for breach of fiduciary duty and\nresponsible for $94,000. After that judgment issued, Garry finally appeared\nand sought to vacate the award alleging improper service. Both defendants\nsought to vacate the judgment on the additional ground that they believe the\nplaintiffs failed to adequately disclose the claim during their bankruptcy. The\ndistrict court denied those postjudgment motions and also awarded attorneys’\nfees and costs against the Causeys.\n        All these rulings are challenged as both sides appeal. Plaintiffs contend\nthe district court should have required both defendants to pay the full $94,000\nin damages. Defendants argue that the jurisdictional defects warrant vacating\nthe judgment, that in any event Karry did not breach the contract, and that\nthe fee award is excessive. We affirm the judgment in all respects as to Karry,\nbut remand for additional factfinding about the attempts to serve Garry.\n                                        I.\n        Joshua Norris, a plumber from Michigan, traveled to New Orleans in\nearly 2007 in search of work. There he met twin brothers Karry and Garry\nCausey. The Causeys proposed to Joshua and his wife, Jill, the following\ninvestment opportunity: the Norrises would supply funds to purchase\nhurricane-damaged properties and the Causeys would renovate those\nproperties and sell them at a profit. That profit would be evenly divided among\nthem.\n        Garry reduced this plan to writing. He and the Norrises signed the joint\nventure agreement. Karry did not.\n                                        3\n\f    Case: 16-30339     Document: 00514126837     Page: 4   Date Filed: 08/22/2017\n\n\n\n                                No. 16-30339\n                  Cons w/ Nos. 16-30942, 16-31068, 16-31069\n\n      The agreement divides responsibilities among the parties along the lines\nof the original understanding. The Norrises are to finance the project. Garry\nis responsible for, among other things, maintaining accounting records,\nidentifying and facilitating the purchase of properties, and negotiating with\ncontractors to obtain the best possible prices. Karry is the project manager.\n      To fulfill their end of the bargain, the Norrises obtained a home equity\nloan. From those funds, they wrote Garry one check for $48,000 and another\nfor $45,000. This money was supposed to be used for construction on two\nseparate properties. Garry wired Karry $15,780 of those funds. The Norrises\ngave Karry an additional $1,000 for architectural plans he said were needed.\n      Despite receiving these funds, the Causeys failed to move forward with\nthe renovations. They instead spent the money on personal items. After a few\nmonths, they also stopped paying the Norrises the interest accumulating on\ntheir home equity loan.\n      Inability to repay that loan led the Norrises to file for Chapter 7\nbankruptcy in 2009. The Norrises did not list their potential claim against the\nCauseys in their bankruptcy schedules. Before the issuance of the trustee’s\nfinal report, however, the claim began to appear in interim reports by the\ntrustee as “a potential lawsuit regarding LA property” with an estimated value\nof $1,000. The bankruptcy trustee’s final report expressly abandons this claim\nto the Norrises. See 11 U.S.C. § 554(c). That abandonment became final in\n2012 when the bankruptcy court approved the final report and closed the case.\n      The Norrises subsequently filed this lawsuit against the Causeys. Garry\nfailed to appear despite various efforts, described in more detail below, to serve\nhim. The district court thus found Garry in default. Karry, on the other hand,\nappeared and actively defended against the Norrises allegations in a one-day\nbench trial.\n                                        4\n\f     Case: 16-30339       Document: 00514126837         Page: 5    Date Filed: 08/22/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 16-30339\n                    Cons w/ Nos. 16-30942, 16-31068, 16-31069\n\n       That trial resulted in the district court’s entering default judgment\nagainst Garry on breach of contract and fiduciary duty claims and ordering\nhim to pay $94,000 in damages. The district court also found Karry tacitly\naccepted the contract and likewise breached. But it held him liable for only\n$15,780—the amount Garry wired him that Karry used for his own benefit.\n       The Norrises subsequently filed a motion for attorneys’ fees and a motion\nto amend the final judgment. The district court awarded $58,736 in attorneys’\nfees and costs, holding Garry and Karry solidarily liable for the full amount.\nAnd despite disagreeing with the Norrises’ arguments for holding Karry\nsolidarily liable for the full damages award, it added $1,000 in damages to\naccount for the check Karry received for architectural plans. Karry filed a\nnotice of appeal. The Norrises filed a cross appeal.\n       Following the commencement of these appeals, the bankruptcy court in\nthe Eastern District of Michigan reopened the Norrises’ case, stating “it\nappear[s] that Debtors may have intentionally [misled] the Court as to their\nassets and said asset appears to be an asset of the Debtor's Estate.” 1\n       After that bankruptcy court activity, and approximately four months\nafter the New Orleans district court issued its final judgment, the Causeys\nfiled separate motions under Rule 60(b)(4) seeking to set aside the judgment\nas void. This was the first time Garry appeared in the case.\n       Both Causeys argued that the Norrises did not have standing as failure\nto disclose the claim in bankruptcy meant abandonment of the claim was\n\n\n\n\n       1 The parties report no further action in the bankruptcy court. The docket sheet shows\nthe trustee has since filed one interim report, one semiannual report, and one annual report.\nIn re Norris, 2:09-bk-68137 (Bankr. E.D. Mich.). All list this lawsuit as an asset. Id. The\nlast report estimates the lawsuit’s value at $170,000.

But because real-party-in-interest is not a jurisdictional\nrequirement, it denied relief, ordering instead that the trustee could substitute\nas the plaintiff. The district court further found that Garry was properly\nserved.\n                                           II.\n      We start our review at the end of the district court litigation, with the\ndenial of the Rule 60(b)(4) motions. We do so because if those motions should\nhave been granted, then the judgment would be void and there would be no\nneed to review the merits.\n      We first consider the Rule 60(b) ground that would vacate the judgment\nas to both defendants: the argument that the Norrises lack standing because\nthey did not disclose this claim during their bankruptcy. The district court’s\nruling on this issue is subject to cross appeals. This is because, although the\ndistrict court did not void the judgment, it held that the Norrises are not the\nreal parties in interest and the bankruptcy trustee could substitute in. The\nCauseys argue that the district court did not go far enough; it recognized the\nreal-party-in-interest problem but did not see that through to voiding the\njudgment. The Norrises contend the district court went too far; whether they\nor the trustee was the proper party is not a question the court should consider\nat all in a motion for postjudgment relief.

Those separate appeals are\nconsolidated. We do not understand the Norrises’ complaint that the appeals of the Rule\n60(b) denials somehow improperly extended Karry’s appeal of the underlying judgment.

It is\nthus like contractual or statutory standing and does not go to a court’s subject\nmatter jurisdiction.

In contrast, a problem with subject matter\njurisdiction cannot be waived—that is why it can serve as a ground to void a\njudgment via Rule 60(b)(4) long after the case ends. In another feature not\ntypical of defects in subject matter jurisdiction, Rule 17(a)(3) states that a case\nmay not be dismissed for a “failure to prosecute in the name of the real party\ninterest until, after an objection, a reasonable time has been allowed” for the\nproper party to “substitute[ ] into the action.” FED. R. CIV. P. 17(a)(3).\n      Courts have recognized this distinction between Article III standing and\nreal-party-in-interest/capacity issues in holding that an assignment does not\nerase constitutional injury, see Cranpark Inc. v. Rogers Group Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">821</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">723</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 730 (6th Cir. 2016) (concluding that “one who sells his interest in a cause\nof action is not deprived of Article III standing” but “is susceptible to a real-\nparty-in-interest challenge”), and that parents can suffer a financial injury\nfrom their child’s hardship even when they are not the proper party to sue in\n                                         9\n\f    Case: 16-30339       Document: 00514126837         Page: 10     Date Filed: 08/22/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 16-30339\n                    Cons w/ Nos. 16-30942, 16-31068, 16-31069\n\nhis name, see Rideau, 819 F.3d at 163 (recognizing that parents who had\nArticle III standing to sue nonetheless lacked capacity to sue on their child’s\nbehalf because a different guardian had been appointed). More generally, that\nthe Norrises may not ultimately be entitled to the damages awarded does not\nchange that the relief sought redresses an injury they suffered. See Sprint,\n554 U.S. at 287 (holding that it is irrelevant that the plaintiff would give all\nwinnings to another party because the sole question is “whether the injury that\na plaintiff alleges is likely to be redressed through the litigation”). This means\nthat even if the Causeys are correct that the trustee should have brought this\nsuit, 3 that would not entitle them relief under Rule 60(b)(4). See Dunn, 556 F.\nApp’x at 789–90 (rejecting a Rule 60(b)(4) motion challenging real-party-in-\ninterest status for the same reason).\n       The district court recognized as much in holding that this argument did\nnot raise the jurisdictional defects that support vacating a judgment. Yet it\nalso ruled that the trustee could replace the Norrises as plaintiffs at this late\njuncture. But the inapplicability of Rule 60(b)(4) means the Causeys have\ninvoked no postjudgment vehicle that allows replacing the Norrises with the\ntrustee.    And as we have already explained, challenges to real-party-in-\ninterest status can be forfeited even when raised prior to entry of judgment,\nsuch as when a defendant waits to raise the issue until the eve of trial. See In\nre Signal, 579 F.3d at 487–88; see also 6A Wright & Miller, supra, § 1554. So\n\n\n\n       3  Because of the improper procedural posture in which this real-party-in-interest\nquestion was raised, we have no occasion to address whether the Norrises’ bankruptcy court\ndisclosure was sufficient or, if it was not, whether the bankruptcy court’s abandonment can\nbe undone in this separate litigation. Judicial estoppel is also sometimes argued when a\nparty pursues a claim that it did not disclose in bankruptcy, see, e.g., Love v. Tyson Foods,\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">677</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 261–62 (5th Cir. 2012), but that equitable doctrine does not raise a\njurisdictional question. So the Causeys failure to timely raise estoppel again means we\ncannot address it.\n                                             10\n\f    Case: 16-30339      Document: 00514126837        Page: 11     Date Filed: 08/22/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 16-30339\n                   Cons w/ Nos. 16-30942, 16-31068, 16-31069\n\nthe Causeys’ raising this challenge only after the court entered judgment was\ntoo late. 4 The district court should have stopped with its correct observation\nthat an alleged real-party-in-interest problem is not a jurisdictional defect that\ncan overcome the strong interest in finality of judgments. If the rest of this\nopinion affirms the judgment, then it remains with the Norrises who acquired\nthis action through the bankruptcy court’s express abandonment of it to them.\n                                           C.\n      In contrast, Garry does raise an issue that goes to the power of the\ndistrict court to enter a judgment against him: whether he was properly served.\nThompson v.

Rule 4 allows serving an individual by\nfollowing either: (1) the law of the state where the suit is brought (Louisiana);\n(2) the law of the state where service is made (New Mexico); or (3) the methods\nlisted in Rule 4 itself.

The district court’s factual finding to the contrary is reviewed for\nclear error. Goetz v.

The New\nMexico address appears as Garry’s residence in litigation documents, pay\nstubs, property tax forms, and affidavits. On top of all this, Karry testified\nthat the New Mexico home is where Garry’s wife lives, where Garry raised his\nkids, and Garry’s address as far as he knows.\n      Garry responds by pointing to his and his wife’s affidavits saying he has\nbeen living in Denver since 2010—five years prior to service being first\nattempted in New Mexico. He notes that a sign outside the home said Garry’s\nmail should be forwarded. And he offers three bills from 2016 listing a Denver\naddress.\n      But this effort fails for two reasons. First, the standard of review means\nthat even if Garry has shown that the location of his place of abode was\ndebatable, we defer to the district court’s conclusion. Anderson v.

Id. at 94.      That\nobservation, however, relies on an outdated version of the New Mexico rules\nthat allowed service in that manner. Id. That rule was revised in 2004 to\neliminate “post and mail” service in favor of service at the place of\nemployment. 6 See UMG Recordings, Inc. v.

But this misconstrues the\ndistrict court’s reliance on Clark. The district court cites it for the proposition that a plaintiff\nmay rely on a defendant’s outward representations in concluding a residence is his usual\nplace of abode. Consideration of such representations is not improper. Indeed, we have said\nthat “no hard and fast rule can be fashioned to determine what is or is not a party’s ‘dwelling\nhouse or usual place of abode’ within the rule’s meaning; rather the practicalities of the\nparticular fact situation determine whether service meets the requirements of [Rule 4].”\nNowell v.

The district court’s reliance on Garry’s\noutward representations regarding the New Mexico residence was just that: assessing the\npracticalities of the particular fact situation to determine whether service was proper.\n        6 “Rule 1-004(F)(1) formerly provided that if no qualified person was at the usual place\n\nof abode to accept service of process, service could be made by posting process at the abode\n                                                13\n\f    Case: 16-30339        Document: 00514126837          Page: 14     Date Filed: 08/22/2017\n\n\n\n                                   No. 16-30339\n                     Cons w/ Nos. 16-30942, 16-31068, 16-31069\n\n         The Norrises’ failure to comply with New Mexico’s requirements for\nservice does not end our inquiry. Given the multiples sources that Rule 4\nconsiders in determining if service is proper, we look to whether federal or\nLouisiana law allows service by posting on the door. The answer turns on what\nhappened the day the complaint was posted on the New Mexico house.\n         The process server’s affidavit says she attempted to serve Garry at his\nNew Mexico residence numerous times. But, she says, neither Garry nor his\nwife voluntarily opened the door to accept service at any point. She then notes\nthat “[o]n another occasion, Garry Causey’s wife yelled through the door that\nshe would not accept service . . . .” The affidavit then says that “[s]ervice was\nsubsequently made on February 2, 2015 by posting the [documents] to the front\ndoor.”\n         The district court’s reliance on New Mexico’s since-repealed service\nrule—the one allowing posting and mailing even without anyone being present\nor avoiding service—meant it did not believe it mattered whether Garry’s wife\nyelling through the door and the posting of the documents happened on the\nsame day. So the district court did not make a clear finding as to this timing\nquestion. The district court says, for example, that the “process server left a\ncopy of the summons and complaint outside the Albuquerque residence after\nGarry Causey’s wife refused to accept service” without detailing how soon\nafter. It likewise later says that “Garry Causey’s wife refused service, so the\nprocess server posted the summons and complaint on the front door”—again\nwithout clearly stating whether both events took place the same day.\n\n\nand then mailing a copy of the process to the last known mailing address. This alternative\nmethod of service has been omitted in the 2004 amendment.” NMRA, Rule 1-004(F)\n(committee commentary). The 2004 Amendment further establishes a “hierarchy of methods\nof service” which did not before exist, id., meaning that previously a plaintiff did not have to\nmake prior attempts at service before resorting to the “post and mail” method.\n                                              14\n\f   Case: 16-30339     Document: 00514126837     Page: 15   Date Filed: 08/22/2017\n\n\n\n                               No. 16-30339\n                 Cons w/ Nos. 16-30942, 16-31068, 16-31069\n\n      It turns out that whether the yelling and posting happened the same day\nmatters a great deal. Leaving a summons and complaint at a residence door,\nunaccompanied by a refusal to accept service, is not effective service under\nRule 4. See German Am. Fin. Advisors & Trust Co. v. Rigsby, 623 F.

This means that if\nGarry’s wife was not present, let alone refusing service, on the day the process\nserver posted the documents on the door, Garry’s service was likely defective.\n      On the other hand, a defendant’s refusal to accept service is not rewarded\nwhen the process server announces the nature of the documents and leaves\nthem in close proximity to the defiant defendant. 4A Wright & Miller, supra,\n§ 1095 (citing Rule 4(e)(2)(A) and collecting cases).

So if Garry’s wife was present and refusing service the day of\nthe posting, leaving the summons on the door may have qualified as the\npermissible “substituted service” of leaving the documents with someone of\nsuitable age and discretion.\n      Garry urges us to find that his wife’s avoidance of service and the posting\nof the documents on the door were two separate incidents, rule service was\nimproper, and void the judgment. His view of the timing may be the most\n                                       15\n\f    Case: 16-30339       Document: 00514126837          Page: 16     Date Filed: 08/22/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 16-30339\n                    Cons w/ Nos. 16-30942, 16-31068, 16-31069\n\nnatural reading of the process server’s affidavit. But because both the affidavit\nand the district court’s findings are susceptible to different interpretations and\nmore evidence may be warranted on this question, the wiser route is to remand\nto allow the district court to make this finding in the first instance.\n       If the district court concludes the documents were not posted on the door\nthe same day Garry’s wife was home and refused service, it may also engage\nin additional factfinding about its alternative ruling that service was proper\nunder a “good faith” theory.          We cannot review that holding now for two\nreasons. For one thing, the finding that the plaintiffs engaged in good faith\nefforts to serve Garry may be influenced by the clarification we seek on remand\nabout the extent of the process server’s efforts. For another, the district court\nseemed to believe a finding of good faith does not require actual notice. It said\nonly that “the record reveals that Garry likely had actual notice of the lawsuit.”\nWe have never considered the “good faith” rule that some district courts have\nadopted and do not do so here given the need for a remand on factual issues.\nSee, e.g., Conwill, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2773239</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *3–5 (“Where the defendant receives\nactual notice and the plaintiff makes a good faith effort to serve the defendant\npursuant to the federal rule, service of process has been effective.”). But at a\nminimum the cases adopting that theory seem to permit it only when a\ndefendant had actual notice of the suit. 7              See, e.g., Ali v.

Most notably, Garry’s brother and business partner (Karry) said there\nis “[n]o question [Garry] is aware of [this lawsuit]”.\n                                             16\n\f    Case: 16-30339      Document: 00514126837         Page: 17    Date Filed: 08/22/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 16-30339\n                    Cons w/ Nos. 16-30942, 16-31068, 16-31069\n\n                                           III.\n       Because we do not find any Rule 60(b) basis to void the judgment entered\nagainst Karry, we consider the merits of the district court’s rulings as to him.\nKarry asserts he could not have breached the joint venture agreement because\nhe never accepted it. 8 The Norrises contend they should have received more\ndamages: lost profits as well as Karry being held liable for the full amount of\ntheir funds that were not invested or returned.\n                                            A.\n       The district court found that Karry tacitly accepted the joint venture\nagreement. Karry fails to show this finding is clearly erroneous.

App. 3 Cir. 2011). These awards\nare upheld when the “amount of time and effort to collect the amount due from\ndefendant warranted the [awards].” Perrier, 66 So. 3d at 1149. That is also\nthe case here. The overall amount, well below $100,000, is not on its face\nexcessive for a federal lawsuit that results in a trial (albeit a brief bench trial)\nand involves some of the challenging legal questions with which this opinion\ngrapples. And the result obtained is only one of ten factors Louisiana courts\nconsider in assessing the reasonableness of a fee award. State, Dept. of Transp.\nand Dev. v. Williamson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1756474\"><a href=\"/opinion/1756474/state-dotd-v-williamson/\"><span class=\"volume\">597</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 442 (1992). Other factors include the\namount of money at stake (much more than the amount Karry was ordered to\npay given the colorable arguments for lost profits and holding Karry\nresponsible for the full amount misappropriated), the extent and character of\nthe work done, and the number of appearances. Id. Just about all of the work\nthe Norrises’ attorneys undertook was devoted to the case against Karry as\nGarry did not appear to defend at trial. 11        All things considered, the district\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in awarding the fees and costs.\n\n\n\n\n       11 The posttrial work responding to Garry’s Rule 60(b) motion was not included in the\nfee award. As for the amounts spent attempting to serve Garry ahead of trial, Karry’s appeal\ndoes not challenge any failure to segregate fees. Rather, it focuses on the fee amount being\ndisproportionate to the damages recovered. That implicates only the question whether the\ndistrict court abused its discretion in concluding the amount was reasonable. HDRE Bus.\nPartners Ltd. Group, LLC v. RARE Hosp.
