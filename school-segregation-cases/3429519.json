An amended information was filed charging in substance that the defendant, on or about January ____, 1922, being then and there a person over the age of seventeen years, made an assault upon one Ella Fay Elrod, being then and there an unmarried female of previously chaste character and between the ages of fifteen and eighteen years of age, to-wit, of the age of sixteen years, and her the said Ella Fay Elrod, he the said Randel Walker did then and there unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of and abuse, etc. On a trial the jury returned the following verdict: \"We the jury find the defendant guilty as charged in the information.\"</p>\n<p>Section 3248, Revised Statutes 1919, as amended, Laws 1921, p. 284a, reads:</p>\n<p>\"If any person over the age of <em>sixteen</em> years shall have carnal knowledge of any unmarried female, of previously chaste character, between the age of sixteen and eighteen years of age, he shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and upon conviction shall be punished by imprisonment in the penitentiary for a term of two years, or by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than five hundred dollars, or by imprisonment in the county jail not less than one month or more than six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court.\"</p>\n<p>I. The purpose of amending Section 3248, Revised Statutes 1919, by reducing the age of the male from seventeen years to sixteen years is not indicated in the title as required by Section 34 of Article IV of our Constitution.

The information must charge every condition required by statute. It must allege (a) that the defendant is over seventeen years; (b) the carnal knowledge of Ella Fay Elrod; (c) that she was an unmarried female; (d) that she was of previously chaste character; (e) that she was between the ages of sixteen and eighteen years of age; (f) that the assault was feloniously done. The information charges the prosecutrix was between the ages of fifteen years and eighteen years of age. When the statute itself individuates the elements of the crime, the offense must be charged in the language of the statute. State v. Hall,  164 Mo. 530 ; State v. Gilmore,  110 Mo. 1 ; State v. McDonald,  85 Mo. 539 ; State v. Griffin,  98 Mo. 672 ; State v. Barnes,  281 Mo. 514 ; State v. Houx, 109 Mo. 659 . This amended information was not drawn under the Act of 1921, but under Sec. 3248, R.S. 1919, and this section was repealed before the information was drawn. Therefore it does not use the words of the statute of any offense known to the law. The information will have to be determined under Sec. 3248, R.S. 1919, as amended by Laws 1921, p. 284a. State v. Barnes, 281 Mo. 541 ; State v. Austin,  113 Mo. 542 . In all indictments or informations for felonies, nothing can be left to intendment\nor implication. State v. James,  232 Mo. 177 ; State v. Keating, 202 Mo. 271 ; State v. Meysenburg,  171 Mo. 1 ; State v. Thierauf, 167 Mo. 429 ; State v. Hagan,  164 Mo. 654 . (2) The punishment was assessed by the court at two years in the Reform School at Boonville. The defendant objects to this form of punishment, since it does not comply with the punishment as fixed by the Amended Laws of 1921, at page 284a. That portion of the statute which prescribes that the court shall fix the penalty does not mean that the court can fix a penalty that is not strictly in compliance with the law. \"And upon conviction shall be punished by imprisonment in the penitentiary for a term of two years.\" The court erred in its fixing the punishment at two years in the Reform School, which punishment is not mentioned by this section of the law.\n\n Robert W. Otto,  Attorney-General, and  Harry L. Thomas, \nSpecial Assistant Attorney-General, for respondent.\n\n(1) The information is sufficient. It correctly states the minimum age of the person accused. The word \"sixteen\" in line two of Section 3248, as amended by Act of 1921, Laws 1921, page 284a, is evidently a misprint, the amending clause referring to the word \"fifteen\" in line three and not to the word \"seventeen\" in line one of said section. The words \"and between the ages of fifteen and eighteen years\" in the information are surplusage, the exact age of the female being stated and such age being within the age limit of the statute as amended. The information fully informs of the offense charged. State v. McNabb, 267 S.W. 606; State v. Perrigin,  258 Mo. 233 ; State v. Hilton, 248 Mo. 522 , (2) The record proper shows that the motion for a new trial was not filed until after judgment and sentence. There is, therefore, nothing for review except the record. R.S. 1919, sec. 4079; State v. Huffman, 267 S.W. 838; State v. Whalen, 297 Mo. 241 ; State v. Deck,\n262 S.W. 712; State v. McSame, 267 S.W. 880. No objection was made to the action of the court in entering judgment and passing sentence. State v. Kile,  231 Mo. 59 ; State v. Brisco, 237 Mo. 154 . The verdict and the judgment and sentence appear in separate entries, allocution is shown and there appears to have been no objection on the part of the appellant. He would appear to be the party at fault, he being given opportunity on allocution, to file his motion or interpose objection. State v. Guerringer, 265 Mo. 408 ; State v. Taylor,  256 S.W. 1059 ; State v. Deck, 262 S.W. 712; State v. Keller, 263 S.W. 172. Where a defendant is asked if he has any legal cause to show why judgment should not be pronounced, his failure to file a motion or ask leave to do so is held to be waiver. State v. Taylor,  256 S.W. 1059 ; State v. Pritchett,  219 Mo. 696 . (3) No exception appears in the record to the action of the court in assessing the punishment of the appellant at confinement in the Missouri State Reformatory. The point is first raised on appeal in the appellant's brief. While the record to be completed might show a sentence to imprisonment in the Missouri State penitentiary and a subsequent commutation to confinement in the Missouri Reformatory, the omission of these entries could not be prejudicial to the appellant, nor in view of the fact that the court assessed the punishment, material. Nothing appearing to the contrary, the presumption is for regularity. R.S. 1919, sec. 12426. The appellant does not come under the provisions of the statute with reference to the juvenile division of the circuit court, having been found by the jury to be over the age of seventeen years. However, the judgment and sentence, if erroneous as to the place of confinement may be corrected by this court. R.S. 1919, sec. 4111.",
