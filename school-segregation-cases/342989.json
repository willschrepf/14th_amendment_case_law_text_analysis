It continues but the\n\ndemands have changed.      Relatively clear lines of legality and\n\nmorality have become more difficult to locate as demands for\n\noutcomes have followed the cutting away of obstacles to full\n\nparticipation.     With our diverse ethnic makeup, this demand for\n\nresults in voting has surfaced profound questions of a democratic\n\npolitical order such as the limits on rearranging state structures\n\nto alter election outcomes, and majority rule at the ballot box and\n\neven in legislative halls, questions Congress has provoked but not\n\nanswered.     All this can make a simple voting rights case seem\n\ndifficult, certainly so with state judges elected on a partisan\n\nballot.     Today our difficulties of fitting the Act to the unique\n\nfeatures of the state judiciary and sorting out racial and partisan\n\nvoting are large but the merits of the claims are easily grasped.\n\nAs we will explain, there is a background to the debate on the\n\nlarge issues that must not be obscured.       The evidence of any\n\ndilution of minority voting power is marginal at best.   We are not\n\npersuaded that a violation of the Voting Rights Act has been proved\n\nand we reverse.\n\n                              I.   Facts\n\n     On July 11, 1988, ten individual voters and the League of\n\nUnited Latin American Citizens sued in federal district court\n\nalleging that Texas' system of electing state trial judges violated\n\n§ 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the Fourteenth and Fifteenth\n\n\n                                   2\n\fAmendments in several Texas counties.1   They sued the Governor of\n\nTexas,2 the Attorney General, the Secretary of State, and the Chief\n\nJustice of the Supreme Court as chair of the Judicial Districts\n\nBoard.    Because this board is responsible for reapportioning the\n\njudicial districts, the suit also named each of its members as\n\ndefendants.    On March 12, 1989, the district court granted the\n\nmotions to intervene of the Houston Lawyers' Association, the\n\nLegislative Black Caucus, and two Texas district court judges, in\n\ntheir individual capacities--Sharolyn Wood, 127th District Court in\n\nHarris County, and Harold Entz, 194th District Court in Dallas\n\nCounty.\n\n     As they have throughout Texas history, Texas voters elect\n\ntheir trial judges in county-wide elections.   A voter may vote for\n\nall of the trial courts of general jurisdiction in her county.   At\n\nthe same time, each trial court is a distinct court, such as the\n\n134th judicial district court of Dallas County, with county-wide\n\njurisdiction and its own history of incumbents.   A candidate runs\n\nfor a particular court.    Plaintiffs contend that electing trial\n\njudges county-wide violates § 2 of the Voting Rights Act by\n\nimpermissibly diluting the voting power of Hispanics and blacks.\n\nPlaintiffs proceed on behalf of language and ethnic minorities in\n\ndifferent combinations in different counties.     Depending on the\n\n     1\n      Plaintiffs originally challenged the election of district\njudges in 44 counties, but by trial, winnowed their targets to\nthe following nine urban counties: Harris County, Dallas County,\nTravis County, Tarrant County, Jefferson County, Ector County,\nBexar County, Midland County, and Lubbock County.\n     2\n      Plaintiffs early in the case dismissed the Governor.\n\n                                 3\n\fcounty--more specifically, the numbers--they argue that Hispanic\n\nvoters, black voters, or the combination of both Hispanic and black\n\nvoters \"have less opportunity than other members of the electorate\n\nto participate in the political process and elect representatives\n\nof their choice.\"      Plaintiffs aimed their constitutional challenge\n\nat Article 5, § 7a(i) of the Texas Constitution, which precludes\n\nthe creation of judicial districts smaller than a county absent\n\napproval by a majority of the voters in that county.         They argued\n\nthat this limitation on the power to redistrict of the Judicial\n\nDistricts Board, chaired by defendant Chief Justice Phillips, was\n\nenacted with discriminatory intent.\n\n      On November 8, 1989, the district court found county-wide\n\nelections violated § 2 in all nine counties, enjoined future\n\nelections, divided the nine counties into electoral subdistricts,\n\nand ordered a nonpartisan election for May 5, 1990, with any runoff\n\nto   be   held    on   June   2.   The   district   court   rejected   the\n\nconstitutional arguments, finding that plaintiffs had failed to\n\nprove that Texas instituted or maintained the electoral system with\n\ndiscriminatory intent.3         Intervenors Judge Wood and Judge Entz\n\nappealed.        Unhappy with nonpartisan elections ordered by the\n\ndistrict court, the Texas Attorney General first moved the court to\n\nalter its interim plan.        After the court denied the motion, the\n\n\n\n\n      3\n       This ruling was not appealed.\n\n                                     4\n\fAttorney General filed a notice of appeal.4       We stayed the district\n\ncourt's order pending appeal.\n\n      In our first effort in this case, a panel held that the Act\n\ncovers judicial elections but concluded that electing district\n\njudges in county-wide elections in Texas did not violate § 2.\n\nLeague of United Latin American Citizens v. Clements, 902 F.2d 293\n\n(5th Cir. 1990) (\"LULAC I\"). We considered the history of judicial\n\nelections in Texas and the office of district judge--the court of\n\ngeneral jurisdiction. We held that Texas had a special interest in\n\nlinking the jurisdictional and electoral bases of the trial courts,\n\nan   interest   accented    by   unwavering   support   throughout   Texas\n\nhistory.   Finding no truly informing analogues for resolving such\n\nan attack on at-large voting supported by a state interest unique\n\nto this judicial office, we looked to the weighing constructs\n\nfamiliar to the Act.       We concluded that, as a matter of law, the\n\nstate interest linking jurisdiction and electoral base outweighed\n\nits potentially dilutive effect.         LULAC I, 902 F.2d at 308.\n\n      A majority of this court sua sponte ordered reconsideration of\n\nthe panel decision en banc.          League of United Latin American\n\nCitizens v. Clements, 914 F.2d 620 (5th Cir. 1990) (\"LULAC II\").\n\nThe en banc court held by a 7-6 vote that § 2 of the Act did not\n\n\n\n      4\n      Former Secretary of State George S. Bayoud, Jr., a named\nparty defendant, objected to the Attorney General's decision not\nto appeal immediately. Bayoud took the position that as chief\nelections officer of the State of Texas, he was the Attorney\nGeneral's client and the Attorney General must represent his\ninterests. Bayoud obtained independent counsel and filed a\nnotice of appeal himself.\n\n                                     5\n\fapply to judicial elections, rejecting the contrary view of the\n\npanel.\n\n     Houston    Lawyers'    Association,          as    intervenor,       and    LULAC\n\npetitioned    for    certiorari.        The    Supreme        Court   granted    both\n\npetitions, consolidated them, and reversed, holding that the Voting\n\nRights Act applies to state judicial elections.                  Houston Lawyers'\n\nAss'n v. Attorney General,              U.S.           , 111 S.Ct. 2376 (1991).\n\nThe Supreme Court also held that Texas has a special interest in\n\nlinking the electoral and jurisdictional bases of district judges.\n\nId. at       , 111 S.Ct. at 2381.        The Court did not agree, however,\n\nthat this state interest outweighed its dilutive effect in all\n\ncases, as a matter of law.         Rather, the Court held that balancing\n\nis a case-specific enterprise, struck by inquiry into the totality\n\nof the circumstances.       Justice Stevens explained that the state\n\ninterest in linkage was to be weighed in deciding \"whether a § 2\n\nviolation    occurred.\"      Id.        Justice    Stevens       made    plain   that\n\nassessing the linkage interest is part of the determination of\n\nliability and not remedy alone.              The Court effectively came down\n\nbetween the \"goes only to remedy\" view of the Department of Justice\n\nand the \"matter of law\" view of the concurring opinion in LULAC II.\n\n     On remand, the en banc court in turn remanded to the panel.\n\nOn January 27, 1993, a majority of the panel affirmed the district\n\ncourt's   findings    in   eight   of    the    nine     counties.        The    panel\n\nconcluded    that    plaintiffs     failed      only     in    Travis     County,   a\n\nDemocratic stronghold. League of United Latin American Citizens v.\n\nClements, 986 F.2d 728 (5th Cir. 1993) (LULAC III).                     For a second\n\n\n                                         6\n\ftime, this court decided, on its own motion, to hear the case en\n\nbanc.\n\n     Although the panel opinion had been vacated, General Morales\n\nurged a legislative solution to reforming judicial elections.    He\n\nsubmitted a plan to the legislature calling for the election of\n\njudges from single-member districts in all Texas counties with\n\npopulations over 100,000.    Recognizing that the Texas Constitution\n\nmandates the current system of electing trial judges, see Tex.\n\nConst. Art. 5, §§ 7, 7a(i), Morales asked the legislature to submit\n\na constitutional amendment to the voters to implement his plan and\n\nurged them to do so in time to moot the LULAC lawsuit.     Doubting\n\nthe necessary legislative support for an amendment, the Governor,\n\nthe Lieutenant Governor, and minority lawmakers urged Morales to\n\nachieve the same result through settlement.      Morales drafted an\n\nagreement providing for the election of the vast majority of judges\n\nin the nine urban counties by subdistricts.    Democratic officials\n\nwho were parties to the suit quickly agreed.   But Morales could not\n\nobtain the agreement of Chief Justice Phillips, nor the district\n\njudges, Judge Wood and Judge Entz.\n\n     When a proposed resolution approving the \"agreement\" reached\n\nthe floor of the Senate there was no quorum because all but two of\n\nthe thirteen Republican senators walked out.       The Senate later\n\nreconvened as a Committee of the Whole, not in formal session, and\n\nvoting along party lines, adopted a resolution expressing its\n\n\"sentiment\" in support of a federal decree.     Voting in the House\n\nalso followed party lines.    Nothing with the force of law could be\n\n\n                                  7\n\fobtained from the legislature.    When the dust settled, the only\n\nlegislative action was this expression of sentiment in support of\n\na federal decree, and that from a Senate convened in a Committee of\n\nthe Whole.    Failing to obtain any positive enactment from the\n\nlegislature, Morales requested that we remand to the district court\n\nfor a hearing and entry of his proposed \"consent\" decree.\n\n     By the decree, 152 judges would run in districts smaller than\n\na county, while 22 would continue to be elected at-large.   District\n\nboundaries would mirror state representative districts in Dallas,\n\nHarris, Bexar, and Jefferson counties.       Justice of the peace\n\ndistricts would be used in Tarrant County.   In Lubbock, Ector, and\n\nMidland counties, judges would run from the existing commissioners\n\ncourt districts.   Anticipating the question of how the case can be\n\nsettled without the agreement of the district court judges, the\n\nplan allows Judges Wood and Entz to be elected in a county-wide\n\nelection.    The stated purpose was to deny the defendant district\n\njudges standing to object.\n\n     Chief Justice Phillips, Judge Wood, and Judge Entz object to\n\nthe proposed decree and oppose the motion to remand.   In addition,\n\nthree former Chief Justices of Texas, Joe R. Greenhill, Robert W.\n\nCalvert, and John L. Hill, are before us as amici objecting to\n\nremand--and denying the authority of the Attorney General to bind\n\nthe State.    Judges Wood and Entz have moved to realign General\n\nMorales with the plaintiffs, and allow their assumption of the\n\n\n\n\n                                 8\n\fdefense of the current system.5         Judge Wood has also moved to\n\ndisqualify the Texas Attorney General as counsel for the State.\n\nWhen settlement negotiations began, Chief Justice Phillips obtained\n\nindependent counsel.6      General Morales responded by moving to\n\ndisqualify Phillips' counsel.       Finally, immediately after oral\n\nargument, plaintiffs filed a notice of nonsuit of Chief Justice\n\nPhillips and the Texas Judicial Districts Board.\n\n                        II.    Motion to Remand\n\n     We are asked to remand to the district court for entry of a\n\nconsent decree, although some of the parties wish to proceed with\n\nthe appeal.   The Attorney General argues that these non-consenting\n\nparties are no obstacle.      Chief Justice Phillips, General Morales\n\nargues, was sued in his official capacity as chair of the Judicial\n\nDistricts Board and the Attorney General is the exclusive lawyer\n\nfor the State of Texas.       On its face, this is not a remarkable\n\ncontention.   However, General Morales also maintains that in his\n\nrole as lawyer for the State, he need not represent the State's\n\npolicymakers; he can ignore them and impose his own views.    That is\n\nremarkable.   The force of this contention is that the Attorney\n\nGeneral is the sole arbiter of State policy when the State's\n\ninterest is in litigation.      This argument is put forward despite\n\nthe fact that it leaves his scrambling for legislative support\n\n\n     5\n      Judge Wood also filed a motion to strike the Attorney\nGeneral's Notice of Action Toward Settlement, which we denied\nbefore oral argument.\n     6\n      We granted Chief Justice Phillips' motion requesting that\nhe be allocated time at oral argument.\n\n                                    9\n\fwholly   inexplicable;    under   his    presently   claimed    power,   the\n\nAttorney General did not need to have the \"settlement\" adopted by\n\nstatute.   In any event, Texas law does not sanction his actions.\n\nNor are we persuaded that Defendant-Intervenors, Judges Entz and\n\nWood, lack standing to object to a proposed consent decree that\n\nwill allow them to run county-wide.        We deny the motion to remand.\n\n           A. The Authority of the Texas Attorney General\n\n     General Morales is not the first Texas Attorney General to\n\nhave staked such a claim of authority.            We rejected a similar\n\neffort in Baker v. Wade, 769 F.2d 289 (5th Cir. 1985) (en banc).\n\nBaker challenged Texas' anti-sodomy statute, suing Holt, the Dallas\n\nCity Attorney, and Wade, the Dallas County District Attorney.            The\n\ndistrict court certified a defendant class of officials responsible\n\nfor enforcing the statute, with Holt and Wade as representatives,\n\nand the Attorney General of Texas intervened on behalf of the\n\nState.      After   the    district      court    declared     the   statute\n\nunconstitutional, Danny E. Hill, Potter County's district attorney,\n\nfiled a notice of appeal, concerned that the Attorney General might\n\ndecide not to appeal.     Hill was a member of the class, but was not\n\na named defendant and had not sought to intervene.           Hill's concern\n\nwas realized when the Attorney General appealed but then withdrew\n\nthe notice.   After failing to persuade the Texas Supreme Court to\n\norder the Attorney General to pursue the appeal and unable to\n\nobtain leave to intervene from the district court, Hill asked this\n\ncourt for leave to intervene on appeal.          We granted this request,\n\nexplaining:\n\n\n                                    10\n\f     [Hill] would be seriously prejudiced were he not allowed\n     to intervene, whereas allowing the appeal to proceed\n     would prejudice no one. As a state official empowered by\n     Texas law to enforce criminal laws, his interest and its\n     impairment by the district court's judgment cannot be\n     questioned. . . .\n     In this case where the district court has rejected\n     binding Supreme Court authority, the circuit court is\n     entitled to conclude as a matter of law that those\n     interests were inadequately represented by those who\n     failed to pursue the appeal and that the state officer\n     seeking to intervene was a proper party to do so.\n\nId. at 292.\n\n     Attorney General Mattox made a considered decision to accept\n\nthe district court's declaration of unconstitutionality.          That was\n\na basic policy choice.       Baker's relevant instruction lies in the\n\nfact that Attorney General Mattox's decision did not control.\n\nBaker rejected the very power claimed by this Attorney General.\n\nThe power he would exercise cannot be squared with Baker.\n\n     That Attorney General Mattox decided to accept the ruling of\n\nthe district court and Morales reaches for a similar result by a\n\n\"settlement\" fails to distinguish our holding in Baker.           It does\n\nnot respond to our holding that the Attorney General cannot bind\n\nstate officials, his clients, to his own policy preferences. It is\n\nasserted that Hill as a district attorney, one of hundreds in\n\nTexas, was charged with the duty of enforcing the statute held\n\nunconstitutional. The law enforcement responsibility of a district\n\nattorney   and   that   of   the   Chief   Justice   as   chair   of   the\n\nredistricting board, however, do not differ in relevant ways.\n\nIndeed, that the Chief Justice may defend the suit is an a fortiori\n\ncase under Baker.   After all, his judicial duties aside, the Chief\n\nJustice's enforcement responsibilities under the redistricting\n\n                                    11\n\fprovisions of state law are statewide.                     A district attorney's\n\nduties, however, run only to the county line.                   See Crane v. Texas,\n\n766 F.2d 193 (5th Cir. 1985).\n\n      The Texas Constitution requires the Chief Justice to supervise\n\nthe state district courts.               Article 5, § 7a established the\n\nJudicial Districts Board and made the Chief Justice its chair.\n\nTex. Const. Art. 5, § 7a(a) and (b).               The constitution charges the\n\nBoard with the duty of reapportioning the judicial districts as the\n\nneed arises.     Id. § 7a(f).           Among other things, the Board is\n\nrequired to consider a district's case load and population in its\n\nreapportionment decisions.            Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 24.945 (Vernon\n\n1988).    Of special importance to this case, the Board may not\n\ncreate districts smaller than a county without a general election.\n\nTex. Const. Art. 5, § 7a(i); Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 24.945(e)\n\n(Vernon 1988). A redistricting plan may not be proposed or adopted\n\neven in anticipation of such an election.                 Id.   Indeed the district\n\ncourt denied leave to intervene in this suit to Midland County\n\nconcluding it was not a real party in interest.                    A panel of this\n\ncourt agreed, observing that, unlike the Judicial Districts Board,\n\nthe county lacked \"the power to re-shape judicial districts.\"\n\nLULAC v. Clements, 884 F.2d 185, 187 (5th Cir. 1989).                     Given the\n\nChief    Justice's   role   as    chair       of    the    Board    and   his    state\n\nconstitutional duties to manage state judicial districts and the\n\nefficiency of the courts, his contention that he has the authority\n\nto   defend   this   lawsuit     if    the    Attorney      General   will      not   is\n\ncompelling.    If a district attorney has a sufficient interest in\n\n\n                                         12\n\fprotecting the laws he is duty-bound to enforce, we are persuaded\n\nthat the Chief Justice as chairman of the Judicial Districts Board\n\nhas a sufficient interest in protecting the current district court\n\nsystem.7\n\n     The concerns raised by the Baker dissent are not present here.\n\nThe dissent was troubled by the fact that Hill was neither a named\n\ndefendant nor a class representative, had never sought to intervene\n\nin the district court, and was not a named party when he filed his\n\nappeal.    769 F.2d at 294-95 (Rubin, J., dissenting).   Here, Chief\n\nJustice Phillips has been a named defendant from the outset.\n\n     The state courts have had little occasion to face such a bold\n\nclaim of authority.    The few Texas cases that have grappled with\n\nthe Attorney General's authority offer him little comfort. Morales\n\npoints to Terrazas v. Ramirez, 829 S.W.2d 712 (Tex. 1991), but in\n\nTerrazas, General Morales also failed in an effort to \"settle\" a\n\nlegislative reapportionment case.      Following the 1990 census,\n\nplaintiffs sued various state and county officials to prevent the\n\nuse of the new census in reapportioning the legislature, because it\n\nallegedly undercounted minorities.    The legislature proceeded with\n\nreapportionment and plaintiffs also challenged the resulting plans.\n\nGeneral Morales defended the legislature's plans, lost at trial,\n\nand appealed directly to the Texas Supreme Court.     Then, Morales\n\n     7\n      The dissent argues that Chief Justice Phillips was joined\nsolely as a jurisdictional party for Eleventh Amendment purposes.\nEven if that were true, and it is not, see supra page 4, it would\nnot answer the real question: if the State of Texas is the real\nparty in interest, does the Attorney General possess exclusive\nauthority to choose whether the State's interests will be\nasserted on appeal? In Baker, we answered in the negative.\n\n                                 13\n\fagreed with the plaintiffs to settle the senate reapportionment\n\nchallenge.    The agreement included a redistricting plan that was\n\nsubmitted    to   the   trial    court     and    promptly      accepted     by   it.\n\nThereafter, five individuals, not parties to the suit, requested\n\nthe Supreme Court of Texas to direct the trial court to vacate its\n\njudgments    reconfiguring       the    senatorial      districts,     order      the\n\nAttorney General to rescind the agreement, and direct the Secretary\n\nof State to withdraw submission of the plan for preclearance.\n\n     A plurality directed the trial court to vacate its judgments,\n\nbut refused relief against the Attorney General.                   Four justices\n\nheld that the trial court erred by failing to weigh all affected\n\ninterests before entering the proposed decree.               In Justice Hecht's\n\nwords, \"a district court cannot order a reapportionment plan for\n\nthe State based on nothing more than an agreement of the Governor,\n\nthe Attorney General, and a few citizens.\"              Id. at 714.8       Indeed a\n\nmajority believed the Attorney General's \"discretion includes the\n\nauthority to propose a settlement agreement in an action attacking\n\nthe constitutionality of a reapportionment statute.\"                   Id. at 722\n\n(Hecht, J.) (emphasis supplied).\n\n     In approving of the Attorney General's conduct, however, the\n\nplurality    noted      that    he     acted     \"on   behalf     of   the     state\n\ndefendants[,]\" giving him the authority \"for his clients and even\n\non his own, to suggest possible remedies . . . [and] to negotiate\n\na settlement.\"    Id. (Hecht, J.) (emphasis added).              \"To hold that he\n\n\n     8\n      Justice Gonzalez joined section II.A. of the plurality\nopinion regarding the entry of redistricting relief.\n\n                                         14\n\fdid not would be to give him less authority than any party or any\n\nother attorney participating in the case.\"       Id. (emphasis added).\n\nThe Attorney General acts as counsel for state officials who are\n\nhis clients.\n\n     Terrazas   recognizes   that   the   Attorney   General   represents\n\nofficials.     It does not follow that by doing so, the Attorney\n\nGeneral steps into their shoes and assumes the policymaking roles\n\nof those officials, against whom specific relief is sought.           We\n\nneed not and do not decide the authority of the Attorney General\n\nwhen an official is named in his official capacity only to join the\n\nState.    Plaintiff sought specific relief against the Judicial\n\nDistricts Board chaired by defendant Chief Justice Phillips.         The\n\npetitioners who objected to the settlement in Terrazas were not\n\neven parties to the suit.    The Attorney General's power to settle\n\nfor his clients is certainly no less than that of other lawyers,\n\nbut Terrazas does not say that it is any greater.         No lawyer may\n\nforge a settlement agreement over the express objection of his\n\nclient.   Here, to the extent that Morales represents the Chief\n\nJustice in the Justice's defense of his constitutionally assigned\n\ntask, he may not ignore him.        As Justice Wallace put it for the\n\nTexas Supreme Court in Public Utility Commission of Texas v. Cofer,\n\n754 S.W.2d 121, 125 (Tex. 1988):\n\n     We emphasize that when a statute confers a right upon the\n     attorney general to represent an agency, it imposes a\n     corollary duty, and the agency has every right to expect\n     the same diligent and faithful representation as any\n     other \"client.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                    15\n\fSee also Hill v. Lower Colo. River Auth., 568 S.W.2d 473, 478 (Tex.\n\nCiv. App.--Austin 1978, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (rejecting an attempt by\n\nthe attorney general to sue the Texas Water Rights Commission \"in\n\nan   effort   to   substitute   his    views   for   that   of   a   lawfully\n\nconstituted State administrative agency\"); Charles Scribner's Sons\n\nv. Marrs, 262 S.W. 722, 729 (Tex. 1924) (although attorney general\n\nhad authority to represent the State Superintendent of Education,\n\nhe did not have authority \"to elect for the state to accept or\n\nreject a contract for text-books that is voidable,\" a decision for\n\nthe Board of Education).\n\n      The Texas legislature has also recognized that the Attorney\n\nGeneral represents the State but does not make its policies.             \"An\n\nadmission, agreement, or waiver made by the attorney general in an\n\naction or suit to which the state is a party does not prejudice the\n\nrights of the state.\"      Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 402.004 (Vernon\n\n1988); see also State v. Reagan County Purchasing Co., 186 S.W.2d\n\n128, 135 (Tex. Civ. App.--El Paso 1944, writ ref'd w.o.m.) (\"acts\n\nbeyond the scope of [Attorney General's] delegated power are not\n\nbinding on the State\").     If the Texas Attorney General could make\n\npolicy for the State, this provision would be superfluous, for he\n\ncould never violate it.     He would in effect be the State.            When\n\nfaced with this statute before, we appropriately noted that \"Texas\n\nhas been at particular pains to attempt to circumscribe the power\n\n\n\n\n                                      16\n\fof the attorney general to make admissions on its behalf.\"   United\n\nStates v. Texas, 680 F.2d 356, 368 n.17 (5th Cir. 1982).9\n\n     9\n      Because the office of Attorney General is rooted in the\ncommon law, many states, including Texas, refer to their Attorney\nGeneral's common law powers. E.g. Martinez v. State, 753 S.W.2d\n165, 179 (Tex. App.--Beaumont 1988, writ ref'd). Thus, there is\nsome value to looking at how other states have dealt with the\nissue we face today. In Tice v. Department of Transportation,\n312 S.E.2d 241, 246 (N.C. Ct. App. 1984), the North Carolina\ncourt held \"that the Attorney General . . . is bound by the\ntraditional rule governing the attorney-client relationship, and\ncannot enter a consent judgment without the consent of the entity\nrepresented.\" In Georgia, the Attorney General may not \"bind his\nclient by settlement for less than the full sum claimed, unless\nexpress authority be given by the client.\" State v. Southwestern\nR.R., 66 Ga. 403, 407 (1881). The North Dakota Attorney\nGeneral's power to represent state departments and officers\n\n     does not mean that the attorney general, standing in the\n     position of an attorney to a client, who happens to be an\n     officer of the government, steps into the shoes of such\n     client in wholly directing the defense and the legal steps\n     to be taken in opposition or contrary to the wishes and\n     demands of his client or the officer or department\n     concerned.\n\nState ex rel. Amerland v. Hagan, 175 N.W. 372, 374 (N.D. 1919),\noverruled on other grounds, Benson v. North Dakota Workmen's\nCompensation Bureau, 283 N.W.2d 96 (N.D. 1979). According to the\nMississippi Supreme Court,\n\n          The unique position of the Attorney General requires\n     that when his views differ from or he finds himself at odds\n     with an agency, then he must allow the assigned counsel or a\n     specially appointed counsel to represent the agency\n     unfettered and uninfluenced by the Attorney General's\n     personal opinion.\n\nState ex rel. Allain v. Mississippi Public Serv. Comm'n, 418 So.\n2d 779, 784 (Miss. 1982); see also Frazier v. State by and\nthrough Pittman, 504 So. 2d 675, 691 (Miss. 1987) (where attorney\ngeneral refuses to represent state agency, agency is entitled to\nits own lawyer and court may retain jurisdiction and entertain\nthe suit). Arizona does not permit its Attorney General to\nappeal a decision against the wishes of the state agency he\nrepresents. Santa Rita Mining Co. v. Department of Property\nValuation, 530 P.2d 360 (Ariz. 1975). Finally, the authority of\nthe Attorney General of Illinois does not permit him to waive the\nrights of his client. Cook County v. Patka, 405 N.E.2d 1376,\n\n                               17\n\f       Stated another way, the Attorney General's right to represent\n\nstate officials or state agencies cannot be gainsaid, see Hill v.\n\nTexas Water Quality Bd., 568 S.W.2d 738, 741 (Tex. Civ. App.--\n\nAustin 1978, writ ref'd n.r.e.); Morris v. Smiley, 378 S.W.2d 149,\n\n152 (Tex. Civ. App.--Austin 1964, writ ref'd n.r.e.), but he must\n\nin fact represent them.       He cannot ignore his clients and bind the\n\nState against their wishes.10         This is not to say that the Chief\n\nJustice is the sole arbiter.         Both he and the Attorney General are\n\nnamed parties to this suit, and each has the right to be heard in\n\nthis case.      The Attorney General's authority does not allow him to\n\n\"close either the mouth of [Phillips] or the ears of the courts,\n\nwhen    there    are   complaints   that    the   Attorney   General     or   his\n\nassistants are not in fact fulfilling their duty.\"                  Cofer, 754\n\nS.W.2d at 125.\n\n                              B. Other Motions\n\n       We deny the Attorney General's motion to disqualify Phillips'\n\ncounsel.     We also deny plaintiffs' attempt to nonsuit the Texas\n\nJudicial    Districts     Board,    including     its   chair,   Chief   Justice\n\nPhillips.       The motion was filed immediately after oral arguments\n\nbefore the en banc court on May 24, 1993.                 Rule 41(a) governs\n\n\n\n1380 (Ill. App. 1980).\n       10\n      Professor Fiss has recognized the problem raised by\nAttorney General Morales' actions in this case. \"We are left to\nwonder, for example, whether the attorney general should be able\nto bind all state officials, some of whom are elected and thus\nhave an independent mandate from the people, or even whether the\nincumbent attorney general should be able to bind his\nsuccessors.\" Owen M. Fiss, Against Settlement, 93 Yale L.J.\n1073, 1079 (1984).\n\n                                       18\n\fvoluntary dismissals and provides that a plaintiff may dismiss an\n\naction without order of the court in two circumstances.                         The\n\nplaintiff must either file the notice of dismissal before the\n\nadverse   party   serves   its   answer     or     summary     judgment   motion,\n\nwhichever occurs first, or file a stipulation of dismissal signed\n\nby all parties who have appeared in the case.                         Fed.R.Civ.P.\n\n41(a)(1).   The notice of nonsuit comes almost five years after the\n\ndefendants have answered, and none of the defendant-aligned parties\n\nhas signed the motion.       Plaintiffs have no unilateral right to\n\ndismiss the Chief Justice and Judicial Districts Board.                   We will\n\nnot permit plaintiffs to seek injunctive relief against the office\n\nheld by Chief Justice Phillips for almost five years and then\n\ndismiss him when he declines to settle.              See Davis v. Huskipower\n\nOutdoor   Equipment   Corp.,     936   F.2d       193,   199   (5th    Cir.   1991)\n\n(affirming refusal to dismiss defendant more than a year after the\n\ncase was removed to federal court); Radiant Technology Corp. v.\n\nElectrovert USA Corp., 122 F.R.D. 201 (N.D. Tex. 1988) (motion to\n\nvoluntarily dismiss under Rule 41 should be denied when plaintiff\n\nseeks to circumvent an expected adverse result).\n\n     We deny the motion of the district judges as Defendant-\n\nIntervenors to realign General Morales with plaintiffs.                   Morales'\n\nefforts to settle the case do not require this measure.                       He is\n\nentitled to take a position in settlement negotiations that is\n\ndifferent from his trial posture. However, if the Attorney General\n\nchanges his views on the merits of the case, realigning him with\n\nthe plaintiffs may be appropriate.          Cf.    Delchamps, Inc. v. Alabama\n\n\n                                       19\n\fState Milk Control Bd., 324 F. Supp. 117, 118 (M.D. Ala. 1971)\n\n(allowing Alabama Attorney General, who like the Texas Attorney\n\nGeneral took an oath to defend both state and federal law, to\n\nrealign      himself   with    plaintiffs   to   challenge   the   federal\n\nconstitutionality of a state law).           We also deny Judge Wood's\n\nmotion to disqualify General Morales as counsel for the State.\n\nWhile we have rejected his claimed power to bind against their will\n\nstate officials he is charged to represent, he is nonetheless their\n\ncounsel.\n\n                              C. The Intervenors\n\n     The Attorney General may represent state officials in their\n\nofficial capacities, but there is no contention that General\n\nMorales represents Judges Wood and Entz.11         They have intervened in\n\ntheir personal capacities and have elected to obtain their own\n\ncounsel.12     As we earlier observed, the proposed consent decree\n\n     11\n      After trial, certain Bexar County district judges also\nsought to intervene as defendants, and we have before us an\nappeal from the denial of their motion. A motion to intervene\nunder Rule 24 must be timely. Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a), (b); Jones v.\nCaddo Parish School Bd., 735 F.2d 923, 926 (5th Cir. 1984) (en\nbanc). Although the district court did not expressly state that\ntheir motion was untimely, it was well within the district\ncourt's discretion to deny the motion on this ground.\n     12\n      Because we find that the judges' standing in their\nindividual capacities survives the settlement agreement, we are\nnot required to address the ability of Texas district court\njudges to represent themselves in their official capacities. It\nappears, however, that Texas law permits them to do so. Tex.\nGov't Code § 74.141, titled Defense of Judges provides:\n\n     The attorney general shall defend a state district judge, a\n     presiding judge of an administrative region, or an active,\n     retired, or former judge assigned under this chapter in any\n     action or suit in any court in which the judge is a\n     defendant because of his office as judge if the judge\n\n                                      20\n\fwould allow Judge Wood and Judge Entz to continue to run county-\n\nwide.     General Morales urges that they therefore lack standing to\n\neither prosecute the suit or object to the proposed decree.\n\n     To this point, the standing of the intervening parties has not\n\nbeen questioned.        To the contrary, the intervenors played an\n\nimportant role at trial and have since taken the lead.           After the\n\nfederal district judge's ruling in favor of plaintiffs, the notice\n\nof appeal was first filed by Judges Wood and Entz, not by the\n\nAttorney     General.     Only    the    district   judge's   adherence   to\n\nnonpartisan elections prodded the Attorney General to appeal.             The\n\nHouston Lawyers' Association intervened by the same order as the\n\nintervening judges and carried the appeal from our first en banc\n\ndecision to the United States Supreme Court.13           Even now, no one\n\nquestions the earlier uncontested standing of the intervenors; nor\n\ncould they.     Wood and Entz intervened in part to protect their\n\ntenure as elected judges.        The district court found that they were\n\nillegally elected.\n\n     Of course, these intervenors must satisfy Article III to\n\nappeal on their own.      Diamond v. Charles, 476 U.S. 54, 68 (1986);\n\nDidrickson v. United States Department of the Interior, 982 F.2d\n\n\n     requests the attorney general's assistance in the defense of\n     the suit.\n\n(emphasis added).\n     13\n      \"Since an intervenor is bound by future orders, it may\nappeal from an appealable order unless the intervention has been\nspecifically limited to forbid it.\" Matter of First Colonial\nCorp., 544 F.2d 1291, 1298 (5th Cir. 1977). There is obviously\nno such limitation on the intervenors' right to appeal in this\ncase.\n\n                                        21\n\f1332, 1337-39 (9th Cir. 1992); United States v. Western Elec. Co.,\n\n900 F.2d 283 (D.C. Cir. 1990).       A case or controversy between the\n\nState and plaintiffs remains.          The parties have a right to a\n\ndetermination of that appeal, unless they consent to a remand. See\n\nWheeler v. American Home Products Corp., 582 F.2d 891, 896 (5th\n\nCir. 1977) (\"once intervention has been allowed, the original\n\nparties may not stipulate away the rights of the intervenor\"); see\n\nalso Sheffield v. Itawamba County Bd. of Supervisors, 439 F.2d 35,\n\n36 (5th Cir. 1971) (\"having instituted a public lawsuit to secure\n\nrectification   for    a   constitutional    wrong   of   wide   dimension,\n\n[plaintiffs] cannot privately determine its destiny\"). Put another\n\nway, the proposed settlement does not deprive this court of its\n\njurisdiction to hear the appeal independently perfected by Judges\n\nWood and Entz, an appeal from a decision that declared their\n\nelections illegal.\n\n     Even   assuming       the   proposed   settlement    foreclosed    the\n\nintervening judges' standing to protect their tenure, Wood and Entz\n\nwould still have a sufficient stake in the litigation to satisfy\n\nthe Constitution.     In an earlier opinion in this case we said\n\n     [a]sserting interests both as a Texas voter and as a\n     sitting Texas district judge, Judge Sharolyn Wood moved\n     to intervene on the side of the defendant--the state.\n     The court allowed her to intervene in her personal\n     capacity, permitting Dallas County District Judge Harold\n     Entz to do so as well.\n\nLeague of United Latin American Citizens v. Clements, 923 F.2d 365,\n\n367 (5th Cir. 1991)(emphasis added).        In the district court, Judge\n\nEntz moved to intervene as a defendant to defend on his interests\n\nas a judge, a lawyer, and a registered voter in and citizen of\n\n                                     22\n\fDallas County.      The court's order granting intervention in his\n\nindividual capacity encompasses all of these interests.\n\n     Thus, the proponents of remand view the judges' intervention\n\ntoo narrowly, for Wood and Entz also have standing as voters.           The\n\nsettlement agreement would deprive voters of the right to vote for\n\nall judges with general jurisdiction over their county.                 The\n\nEleventh Circuit recently confronted a similar situation.            Meek v.\n\nMetropolitan Dade County, 985 F.2d 1471 (11th Cir. 1993), was a\n\nvoting   rights    challenge   to   the   at-large   election   of   county\n\ncommissioners in Dade County, Florida.        As here, individual voters\n\nchallenged a liability finding that elected officials would not\n\ncontest on appeal.      Swann and Sampson were Dade County residents\n\nand voters.       The district court denied them leave to intervene\n\nbefore trial.      In a second request for leave to intervene, Swann\n\nand Sampson sought to preserve their right to appeal in the event\n\nof an adverse judgment and a decision by defendants not to appeal.\n\nThe court found the at-large system illegal and, as feared, the\n\nCounty Commission decided not to appeal.        When the district court\n\ndenied their third motion to intervene, Swann and Sampson appealed.\n\n     Our sister court held that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying the intervention and affirmed the district\n\ncourt on the merits.     The court held that the voters had standing,\n\na sufficient interest both to intervene and carry the appeal when\n\nthe state agency declined to do so.       In its view, if the court were\n\nto deny standing to these voters, it \"would be forced to conclude\n\nthat most of the plaintiffs also lack standing, a conclusion\n\n\n                                     23\n\fforeclosed by the many cases in which individual voters have been\n\npermitted to challenge election practices.\"       Id. at 1480 (citing\n\nWhitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124 (1971); Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S.\n\n186 (1962)).    We agree that the standing of voters in a voting\n\nrights case cannot be gainsaid.   See also O'Hair v. White, 675 F.2d\n\n680, 688-90 (5th Cir. 1982) (en banc); Henderson v. Fort Worth\n\nIndependent School Dist., 526 F.2d 286, 288-90 (5th Cir. 1976).14\n\n                        D. Consent Decrees\n\n     Even if all of the litigants were in accord, it does not\n\nfollow that the federal court must do their bidding.     The proposal\n\nis not to dismiss the lawsuit, but to employ the injunctive power\n\nof the federal court to achieve a result that the Attorney General\n\nand plaintiffs were not able to achieve through the political\n\nprocess.   The entry of a consent decree is more than a matter of\n\nagreement among litigants.   It is a \"judicial act.\"    United States\n\nv. Swift & Co., 286 U.S. 106, 115 (1932).      \"[W]hen [the court] has\n\nrendered a consent judgment it has made an adjudication.\"      Kaspar\n\nWire Works, Inc. v. Leco Eng'g & Machine, Inc., 575 F.2d 530, 538-\n\n39 (5th Cir. 1978) (quoting 1B James W. Moore et al., Moore's\n\nFederal Practice ¶ 0.409[5]).          Courts must exercise equitable\n\ndiscretion before accepting litigants' invitation to perform the\n\njudicial act.\n\n\n\n     14\n      Our conclusion that Defendant-Intervenors continue to have\nstanding in their individual capacities to defend the current\nmethod of electing trial judges makes it unnecessary for us to\nconsider their motion to modify their intervention to enable them\nto do so.\n\n                                  24\n\f     A consent decree must arise from the pleaded case and further\n\nthe objectives of the law upon which the complaint is based.     See\n\nLocal No. 93, Int'l Ass'n of Firefighters v. City of Cleveland, 478\n\nU.S. 501, 525, 106 S. Ct. 3063, 3077 (1986).    When presented with\n\na proposed judgment, the court \"must not merely sign on the line\n\nprovided by the parties.\"   United States v. City of Miami, 664 F.2d\n\n435, 440 (5th Cir. 1981) (en banc) (Rubin, J.).\n\n     Because the consent decree does not merely validate a\n     compromise but, by virtue of its injunctive provisions,\n     reaches into the future and has continuing effect, its\n     terms require more careful scrutiny.       Even when it\n     affects only the parties, the court should, therefore,\n     examine it carefully to ascertain not only that it is a\n     fair settlement but also that it does not put the court's\n     sanction on and power behind a decree that violates\n     Constitution, statute, or jurisprudence. . . . If the\n     decree also affects third parties, the court must be\n     satisfied that the effect on them is neither unreasonable\n     nor proscribed.\n\nId. at 441 (Rubin, J.) (emphasis added); see also Overton v. City\n\nof Austin, 748 F.2d 941, 952-53 (5th Cir. 1984); Williams v. City\n\nof New Orleans, 729 F.2d 1554, 1559 (5th Cir. 1984) (en banc)\n\n(Williams, J.).\n\n     The emphasized passage makes a critical point.      A proposed\n\nconsent decree is generally--as here--a request for the court to\n\nexercise its equitable powers.    It involves the court's sanction\n\nand power and is not a tool bending without question to the\n\nlitigants' will.   As Justice Harlan wrote, \"parties cannot, by\n\ngiving each other consideration, purchase from a court of equity a\n\n\n\n\n                                 25\n\fcontinuing injunction.\"      System Federation No. 91, Ry. Employees'\n\nDep't, AFL-CIO v. Wright, 364 U.S. 642, 651 (1961).15\n\n     We have recognized that when fewer than all litigants forge a\n\nconsent   decree,   issues   affecting   other   parties   remain    to   be\n\nadjudicated.    City of Miami, 664 F.2d at 440 (Rubin, J.).               As\n\neleven judges recognized in the same case, our preferences for\n\nsettlement and accord are insufficient to justify the imposition of\n\na decree that infringes upon the rights of third parties.           See id.\n\nat 451 (Gee, J., concurring and dissenting).          A consent decree\n\n\"cannot dispose of the valid claims of nonconsenting intervenors;\n\nif properly raised, these claims remain and may be litigated by the\n\nintervenor.\"    Local 93, 478 U.S. at 529, 106 S. Ct. at 3079.\n\n     Courts must be especially cautious when parties seek to\n\nachieve by consent decree what they cannot achieve by their own\n\nauthority.     Consent is not enough when litigants seek to grant\n\nthemselves powers they do not hold outside of court.          People Who\n\nCare v. Rockford Bd. of Educ., 961 F.2d 1335, 1337 (7th Cir. 1992).\n\nFor example, a local government may not use a consent decree to\n\navoid a state law requiring a referendum before the issuance of\n\nconstruction bonds.     Dunn v. Carey, 808 F.2d 555, 560 (7th Cir.\n\n1986).\n\n     We expressed our concern regarding the risks attending consent\n\ndecrees in Overton v. City of Austin, 748 F.2d 941 (5th Cir. 1984).\n\nIn that case, plaintiffs and the city attorney, acting for the city\n\n     15\n      In the same passage, Wright reminds us that \"authority to\nadopt a consent decree comes only from the statute which the\ndecree is intended to enforce.\" 364 U.S. at 651.\n\n                                   26\n\fcouncil, proposed        a   decree    substituting      single-member     council\n\ndistricts for the at-large council established by the city charter.\n\nA dissenting council member maintained that the council lacked the\n\nauthority    to    change    the    existing   scheme     without    a   city-wide\n\nreferendum.       Id. at 947 n.5.     In the district court, several black\n\nvoters sought       to   intervene     as   defendants    on   the   ground   that\n\nsubdistricting would curtail their voting power.               Id. at 944.    The\n\nplaintiffs petitioned for a writ of mandamus to compel the district\n\ncourt   to    implement       the     proposed    decree       without     further\n\nconsideration.      We refused to issue the writ.          In doing so, Overton\n\nrecognized the danger of manipulation faced by federal courts.                 We\n\nmay be asked to effectuate substantive results that government\n\nofficials are not empowered to bring about themselves. Id. at 956.\n\nThe risk can be realized in many ways, but is palpable where\n\nsharply divided state officials would draw the federal courts into\n\na partisan political battle.\n\n     Our job is to decide a case or controversy.                     The parties'\n\nhigh-strung rhetoric does not fully obscure the reality that a live\n\ncontroversy yet exists.            By declining to remand this case, we do\n\nnot slow one whit any march for change in Texas.                     Its elected\n\nleaders are always free to pursue whatever scheme they think best,\n\nthrough the normal political process. Texas links the jurisdiction\n\nand electoral bases of its district judges and the still-contested\n\nquestion for this court is its legality.\n\n     The procedural posture of this case when the request to remand\n\nto the district court was heard is important.               The issues in this\n\n\n                                         27\n\fcase were well known to the entire court.    The case had been fully\n\ntried and its appeal had twice been before a panel of this court\n\nand was before the en banc court a second time.      The issues had\n\nbeen fully aired in the panel majority and dissenting opinion when\n\nthis court vacated the panel opinion.       In sum, we are asked to\n\nremand to the district court to consider entry of a \"consent\"\n\ndecree and to decide whether it would \"put the court's sanction on\n\nand power behind a decree that violates Constitution, statute, or\n\njurisprudence.\"   City of Miami, 664 F.2d at 441 (Rubin, J.).   More\n\nprecisely put, any federal decree must be a tailored remedial\n\nresponse to illegality.   Cf.   Shaw v. Reno, 113 S.Ct. 2816 (1993).\n\nWe are asked to remand for this determination although we are not\n\npersuaded that there is any illegality.\n\n     It is not a matter of our withholding announcement of our\n\ndecision.   We could not, in any event, remand without correcting\n\nthe district court's misapprehensions of law, found even by our\n\ndissenting colleagues. Significant legal errors infected the trial\n\ncourt's earlier judgment, including its refusal to consider the\n\neffect of partisan voting, its finding of liability in Travis\n\nCounty now undefended, its selective aggregation of language and\n\nethnic minorities, its refusal to accord weight to the State's\n\nlinkage interest in the totality of the circumstances, and finally,\n\nits heavy reliance upon historical societal discrimination without\n\nbringing this history home to this case.      We cannot escape this\n\nerror-correcting task--and when it is done, there is no case.   The\n\namicus United States agrees with our conclusion that, once the\n\n\n                                  28\n\fproper legal standards are determined, the record presents no\n\nfactual issue that needs revisiting.           It follows that the proposed\n\nconsent     decree    cannot    respond     to     sufficiently   identified\n\nillegality--because the record demonstrates that there is none.\n\n                          E. Chisom v. Edwards\n\n     Finally, the parties urging remand point to Chisom v. Edwards,\n\n970 F.2d 1408 (5th Cir. 1992), where we remanded a voting rights\n\ncase for the district court to enter a consent decree.             That case\n\nchallenged    the    method    of   electing     Louisiana's   Supreme   Court\n\nJustices.    Chisom v. Roemer, 111 S. Ct. 2354, 2358 (1991).               Our\n\nremand in Chisom, however, resulted from different circumstances.\n\n     First, all parties joined the motion to remand, as we were\n\ncareful to point out in our order:\n\n     The Joint Motion to Remand to Effectuate Settlement filed\n     by all parties is hereby granted; and this case is\n     remanded to the United States District Court for the\n     Eastern District of Louisiana for the limited purpose of\n     effectuating a settlement. Jurisdiction of the appeals\n     is hereby retained. Upon notification that a consent\n     judgment has been entered by the district court, the\n     appeals will be dismissed. We express no opinion, of\n     course, on the settlement or judgment.\n\nChisom, 970 F.2d at 1409 (emphasis added). As we have discussed,\n\nthe same is not true here.16\n\n\n\n     16\n      For the same reason, Supreme Court authority does not\nrequire a remand. In Turnock v. Ragsdale, 493 U.S. 987 (1989),\nthe Court granted the parties' joint motion to defer further\nproceedings for the parties to submit a proposed consent decree\nto the district court. Unlike the case before us, the joint\nmotion in Turnock was a true joint motion; there were no\nobjections. See Ragsdale v. Turnock, 941 F.2d 501, 503 (7th Cir.\n1991) (recounting procedural history). In spite of its label,\nthe Attorney General's motion is far from being a joint motion.\n\n                                       29\n\f      Second, the parties in Chisom came to this court asking for\n\nremand carrying a duly enacted state law with them.             They did not\n\nseek to invoke the preemptive force of the federal law.            The decree\n\nin Chisom was agreed to by all parties and adopted into law by the\n\nstate legislature.        The consent decree did not set aside any state\n\nlaws--and not by accident.         It was carefully crafted to that end.\n\nIn   Louisiana,     the   legislature    can   create   more   supreme   court\n\ndistricts with a two-thirds vote from both houses.             La. Const. Art\n\n5, § 4.17      Article 5, § 3 of the Louisiana Constitution fixes the\n\nnumber of supreme court justices at seven and establishes that each\n\nshall serve a ten-year term.18        Because the state wished to create\n\nthe Orleans district without upsetting the terms of the sitting\n\njustices, Louisiana had to temporarily expand the supreme court to\n\neight members.19\n\n\n\n      17\n           Art. 5, § 4 provides:\n\n      The state shall be divided into at least six supreme court\n      districts, and at least one judge shall be elected from\n      each. The districts and the number of judges assigned to\n      each on the effective date of this constitution are\n      retained, subject to change by law enacted by two-thirds of\n      the elected members of each house of the legislature.\n      18\n           Art. 5, § 3 provides:\n\n      The supreme court shall be composed of a chief justice and\n      six associate justices, four of whom must concur to render\n      judgment. The term of a supreme court judge shall be ten\n      years.\n      19\n      Louisiana's first effort to create an eighth position, and\nthereby resolve the Chisom litigation, came in 1989 in the form\nof a proposed constitutional amendment. However, the voters\nrejected the proposal. See La. Const. Art. 5, §§ 4, 35,\nHistorical Notes.\n\n                                        30\n\f      While § 3 limits the size of the supreme court to seven\n\njustices, Art. 5, § 5(A) permits the Louisiana Supreme Court to\n\n\"assign a sitting or retired judge to any court.\"              La. Const. Art.\n\n5, § 5(A).      The legislature therefore created an additional place\n\nfor a judge on the Court of Appeal for the Fourth Circuit, who,\n\nupon election, would be assigned to the supreme court to serve, in\n\nreality, as the eighth justice.          See La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 13:312.4\n\n(West Supp. 1993).        This temporary judgeship was to expire with a\n\nvacancy on the supreme court from the first district.                The vacancy\n\nwould be filled by an election in the newly created seventh\n\ndistrict      comprised   of   Orleans    Parish.       La.   Rev.   Stat.   Ann.\n\n§ 13:101.1 (West Supp. 1993).                 Both of these provisions were\n\ncontained in Act 512 which, after receiving the required two-thirds\n\nvote in both houses of the legislature, became law on June 22,\n\n1992.   Official Journal of the Proceedings of the Senate of the\n\nState of Louisiana, 18th Reg. Sess. at 24 (June 18, 1992); Official\n\nJournal of the Proceedings of the House of the State of Louisiana,\n\n18th Reg. Sess. at 31 (June 16, 1992).               The Louisiana Legislature\n\nprovided that Act 512 would not go into effect unless the federal\n\ncourt entered a consent decree in Chisom.                 La. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\n§ 13:101.l (West Supp. 1993).\n\n      The Texas Legislature refused to take positive action, and the\n\nsettlement agreement attempts to avoid constitutional requirements.\n\nThe   Texas    Constitution    requires       that   judges   be   elected   from\n\ndistricts no smaller than a county, absent a majority vote by the\n\n\n\n\n                                         31\n\fcitizens of that county.     Tex. Const. Art. 5, §§ 7, 7a(i).20    The\n\nsettlement agreement is not contingent on approval by the voters of\n\neach county.      The legislature has not proposed a constitutional\n\namendment.     It has made no laws.\n\n                             F. Federalism\n\n     Then we have all sides claiming the high ground of federalism.\n\nSome of the assertions are creative.         The suggestion that state\n\npolitical groups, unable to muster sufficient political force to\n\nchange the system, can by \"agreement\" enlist the preemptive power\n\nof the federal court to achieve the same end stands federalism on\n\nits head.       Of course, we defer to legislative will and state\n\ndecision.     Here, the \"decision\" to which we are asked to defer is\n\na decision by a political faction that the federal court should\n\norder the state to change its system.

When the record indisputably proves that\n\npartisan affiliation, not race, best explains the divergent voting\n\npatterns   among    minority     and    white   citizens   in   the    contested\n\ncounties, defendants conclude, the district court's judgment must\n\nbe reversed.\n\n      We agree.    The scope of the Voting Rights Act is indeed quite\n\nbroad, but its rigorous protections, as the text of § 2 suggests,\n\nextend only to defeats experienced by voters \"on account of race or\n\ncolor.\"      Without an inquiry into the circumstances underlying\n\nunfavorable election returns, courts lack the tools to discern\n\nresults that are in any sense \"discriminatory,\" and any distinction\n\nbetween deprivation and mere losses at the polls becomes untenable.\n\nIn holding that the failure of minority-preferred candidates to\n\nreceive support from a majority of whites on a regular basis,\n\nwithout more, sufficed to prove legally significant racial bloc\n\nvoting, the district court loosed § 2 from its racial tether and\n\nfused illegal vote dilution and political defeat.

Nor did the\n      evidence purport to show or the court find that\n      inhabitants of the ghetto were regularly excluded from\n      the slates of both major parties, thus denying them the\n      chance of occupying legislative seats.\n\nId. at 149-50.\n\n                                        39\n\fall of the elections or even most of them, the ghetto would have no\n\njustifiable complaints about representation.\"      Id. at 152.     For\n\nthis reason, the Court concluded that the \"failure of the ghetto to\n\nhave legislative seats in proportion to its population emerges more\n\nas a function of losing elections than of built-in bias against\n\npoor Negroes.\"    Id. at 153.\n\n       The Whitcomb Court was reluctant to view the plaintiffs'\n\nclaims of vote dilution as anything more than \"a euphemism for\n\npolitical defeat at the polls,\" id., for, absent evidence of a lack\n\nof access to the political system, there was no principle by which\n\nthe Court could distinguish the \"ghetto's\" claims and those of\n\nother unsuccessful political groups:\n\n       [A]re poor Negroes of the ghetto any more under-\n       represented than poor ghetto whites who also voted\n       Democratic and lost, or any more discriminated against\n       than other interest groups or voters in Marion County\n       with allegiance to the Democratic Party, or, conversely,\n       any less represented than Republican areas or voters in\n       years of Republican defeat? We think not. The mere fact\n       that one interest group or another concerned with the\n       outcome of Marion County elections has found itself\n       outvoted and without legislative seats of its own\n       provides no basis for invoking constitutional remedies\n       where, as here, there is no indication that this segment\n       of the population is being denied access to the political\n       system.\n\nId. at 154-55.    To grant relief to black residents in this case,\n\nthe Court held, \"would make it difficult to reject claims of\n\nDemocrats, Republicans, or members of any political organization in\n\nMarion County who live in what would be safe districts in a single-\n\nmember district system but who in one year or another, or year\n\nafter year, are submerged in a multimember district vote.\"     Id. at\n\n156.\n\n                                  40\n\f      The Court's assertion that plaintiffs' racial vote dilution\n\nclaim was indistinguishable from complaints which might be brought\n\nby any unsuccessful interest group hinged on its determination that\n\n\"ghetto\" residents did not suffer from a lack of access to the\n\npolitical process.      Despite the presence of vast disparities in\n\nvirtually every significant measure of socioeconomic status, the\n\nCourt found that black voters stood on the same footing with whites\n\nin   vying   for   representation   within   Marion    County.       \"Ghetto\"\n\nresidents had in fact experienced a string of losses at the polls\n\nin recent years, but these defeats were shared equally among all\n\nmembers of the Democratic Party.\n\n      The Court confronted very different circumstances two years\n\nlater in White v. Regester, 412 U.S. 755 (1973).                    The Court\n\nconfirmed Whitcomb's rejection of the claim that \"every racial or\n\npolitical group has a constitutional right to be represented in the\n\nstate   legislature,\"    id.   at   769,   and   reiterated   the    standard\n\nestablished in its earlier decision: a minority group must prove\n\n\"that its members had less opportunity than did other residents in\n\nthe district to participate in the political processes and to elect\n\nlegislators of their choice.\"        Id. at 766 (citing Whitcomb, 403\n\nU.S. at 149-50).     Unlike the plaintiffs in Whitcomb, however, the\n\nblack residents of Dallas County and the Hispanic voters in Bexar\n\nCounty each established that they had been effectively excluded\n\nfrom the political processes leading to the nomination and election\n\nof the Texas House of Representatives.           412 U.S. at 766-70.\n\n\n\n\n                                     41\n\f       Specifically, black voters in Dallas labored under the yoke of\n\nTexas' long history of official discrimination and were subjected\n\nto   several    procedural       devices    which,   while     not    invidious    in\n\nthemselves, \"enhanced the opportunity for racial discrimination.\"\n\nId. at 766.        \"More fundamentally,\" the Court noted, the Dallas\n\nCommittee       for     Responsible        Government,    \"a     white-dominated\n\norganization that is in effective control of Democratic Party\n\ncandidate slating,\" had slated only two black candidates in its\n\nhistory, who, not coincidentally, constituted the only two blacks\n\never to have served in the Dallas County delegation to the Texas\n\nHouse since Reconstruction.            Id. at 766-67.        The DCRG failed to\n\ndisplay any \"good-faith concern for the political and other needs\n\nand aspirations of the Negro community,\" and in fact regularly\n\nrelied on racial campaign tactics to defeat candidates supported by\n\nblack residents.             Id. at 767.     Consequently, the Court had no\n\nreason to disturb the district court's conclusion \"that 'the black\n\ncommunity has been effectively excluded from participation in the\n\nDemocratic primary selection process,' and was therefore generally\n\nnot permitted to enter into the political process in a reliable and\n\nmeaningful manner.\"            Id. (quoting Graves v. Barnes, 343 F. Supp.\n\n704, 726 (W.D. Tex. 1972)).\n\n       The Court also upheld a similar finding that Mexican-Americans\n\nlikewise    had       been    \"'effectively     removed   from       the    political\n\nprocesses of Bexar [County] in violation of all the Whitcomb\n\nstandards.'\"       Id. at 769 (quoting Graves, 343 F. Supp. at 733).\n\nLike    black     residents      of   Texas,    Mexican-Americans          \"had   long\n\n\n                                           42\n\f'suffered from, and continue[d] to suffer from, the results and\n\neffects of invidious discrimination and treatment in the field of\n\neducation, employment, economics, health, politics and others.'\"\n\nId. at 768 (quoting Graves, 343 F. Supp. at 728)).                      In addition,\n\nthe    district     court     determined      that    \"cultural        and    language\n\nbarrier[s] . . . 'conjoined with the poll tax and the most\n\nrestrictive     voter   registration       procedures       in   the    nation      have\n\noperated   to      effectively    deny   Mexican-Americans         access      to    the\n\npolitical processes in Texas even longer than the Blacks were\n\nformally denied access by the white primary.'\"                          Id. (quoting\n\nGraves, 343 F. Supp. at 731).         The exclusionary effects of past and\n\npresent discrimination, the Court found, were palpably reflected in\n\nlow voting registration among Mexican-Americans, the election of\n\nonly five Bexar County Mexican-Americans to the Texas Legislature\n\nsince 1880, and the county delegation's unresponsiveness to the\n\ncommunity's interests.           Id. at 768-69.       Given that the district\n\ncourt's findings flowed from \"a blend of history and an intensely\n\nlocal appraisal\" of conditions in Bexar County, the Court was \"not\n\ninclined to overturn\" its conclusion that the multimember district\n\n\"invidiously         excluded      Mexican-Americans             from        effective\n\nparticipation in political life.\"             Id. at 769.    As we will explain,\n\nthis earlier time in Texas history and the elections at issue here\n\npresent stark contrasts. The record before us contains no evidence\n\nthat   past   or    present     discrimination       has   affected      minorities'\n\npolitical access in any way.\n\n\n\n\n                                         43\n\f     The principles announced and applied in Whitcomb and White are\n\ninstructive and, we believe, controlling.        As Justice White, the\n\nauthor of these opinions, recently indicated, the central \"theme\"\n\nof Whitcomb and White is \"that it is not mere suffering at the\n\npolls but discrimination in the polity with which the Constitution\n\nis concerned.\"    Shaw v. Reno, 113 S.Ct. 2816, 2835 (1993) (White,\n\nJ., dissenting). Beyond the bounds of this litigation, the clarity\n\nwith which the Whitcomb Court articulated the principles underlying\n\nthe \"results\" test has largely forestalled confusion or doubt, even\n\namong those whom plaintiffs might be inclined to count as allies.\n\nSee, e.g., Jones v. City of Lubbock, 727 F.2d 364, 384 (5th Cir.\n\n1984) (\"Even where an at-large system interacts with a racially or\n\nethnically   polarized   electorate   to   the   disadvantage   of   the\n\nminority, the 'result' is not necessarily a denial of political\n\naccess . . . .

Justice Marshall, for example, provided a clear\n\nexplanation of the Court's holding in his dissent in Mobile v.\n\nBolden, 446 U.S. 55 (1980):\n\n     In Whitcomb v. Chavis, we again repeated and applied the\n     Fortson [effects] standard, but determined that the Negro\n     community's lack of success at the polls was the result\n     of partisan politics, not racial vote dilution.       The\n     Court stressed that both the Democratic and Republican\n     Parties had nominated Negroes and several had been\n     elected. Negro candidates lost only when their entire\n     party slate went down to defeat. In addition, the Court\n     was impressed that there was no finding that officials\n     had been unresponsive to Negro concerns.\n\n                                 44\n\fId. at 109 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (citations omitted).\n\n     Justice Marshall's references to the \"lack of success at the\n\npolls\" as   a    \"result\"   of   \"partisan    politics,    not   racial    vote\n\ndilution,\" closely tracks the relevant language in Whitcomb, where\n\nthe Court held that the \"cancell[ing] out\" of the \"voting power of\n\nghetto residents\" was more \"a function of losing elections\" or\n\n\"political defeat\" than of \"built-in bias against poor Negroes.\"\n\n403 U.S. at 153.        Absent evidence that minorities have been\n\nexcluded from the political process, a \"lack of success at the\n\npolls\" is not sufficient to trigger judicial intervention.            Courts\n\nmust undertake the additional inquiry into the reasons for, or\n\ncauses of, these electoral losses in order to determine whether\n\nthey were the product of \"partisan politics\" or \"racial vote\n\ndilution,\" \"political defeat\" or \"built-in bias.\"           It is only upon\n\nconcluding that a minority group's failure to prevail at the polls,\n\nthat is, their failure to attract the support of white voters, was\n\nthe \"result\" or \"function\" of \"racial vote dilution\" or \"built-in\n\nbias,\" that a court may find that minority plaintiffs have suffered\n\n\"a denial or abridgement of the right . . . to vote on account of\n\nrace or color.\"    In sum, Whitcomb unmistakably prescribes the very\n\ninquiry   into   the   causes    underlying   the   lack   of    support   for\n\nminority-preferred candidates among white voters with which the\n\ndistrict court dispensed.\n\n     As Justice Marshall suggested, failures of a minority group to\n\nelect representatives of its choice that are attributable to\n\n\"partisan politics\" provide no grounds for relief. Section 2 is \"a\n\n\n                                     45\n\fbalm for racial minorities, not political ones--even though the two\n\noften coincide.\"       Baird v. Consolidated City of Indianapolis, 976\n\nF.2d 357, 361 (7th Cir. 1992) (citing Whitcomb).                     \"The Voting\n\nRights Act does not guarantee that nominees of the Democratic Party\n\nwill be elected, even if black voters are likely to favor that\n\nparty's candidates.\"          Id.   Rather, § 2 is implicated only where\n\nDemocrats lose because they are black, not where blacks lose\n\nbecause they are Democrats.           While this rule is easier stated than\n\napplied, the Whitcomb Court's application of the \"results\" test to\n\nthe   facts   before    it    provides    helpful   and    indeed    dispositive\n\nguidance.        As we explain in greater detail below, the Court's\n\ndismissal in Whitcomb of the plaintiffs' vote dilution claim as a\n\n\"mere   euphemism      for   political    defeat    at    the   polls,\"   despite\n\nevidence    of    polarized    voting,    the   lingering       effects   of   past\n\ndiscrimination,      and     little    electoral    success      among    minority\n\ncandidates, precludes finding a violation of § 2 in most, but not\n\nall, of the counties at issue.\n\n                             B. The 1982 Amendments\n\n      The Senate Report accompanying the 1982 amendments to § 2\n\nstates that Congress intended to \"codify\" the \"results test\"\n\narticulated and employed in Whitcomb and White. Congress of course\n\nretained the statutory language restricting relief under § 2 to\n\n\"denial[s] or abridgment[s] of the right . . . to vote on account\n\nof race or color.\"       This limitation was not so much the product of\n\nlegislative discretion as constitutional imperative, given that the\n\nscope of Congress' remedial power under the Civil War Amendments is\n\n\n                                         46\n\fdefined in large part by the wrongs they prohibit.             See, e.g., City\n\nof Rome v. United States, 446 U.S. 156, 206 (1980) (Rehnquist, J.,\n\ndissenting); Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112, 152 (1970) (Harlan,\n\nJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part).               Thus, the Senate\n\nReport explained that the 1982 amendments avoided constitutional\n\ndifficulty because \"the very terms and operation of [§ 2] confine\n\nits application to actual racial discrimination.\"               S.Rep. 417 at\n\n43, reprinted in 1982 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News at 221.\n\n       Congress embraced Whitcomb on terms consistent with § 2's\n\nlimitation to cases of \"actual racial discrimination.\" Noting that\n\nthe claim before the Court in Whitcomb alleged vote dilution on\n\ngrounds that \"black ghetto residents with [distinct] legislative\n\ninterests    had    been     consistently       underrepresented      in    the\n\nlegislature,\" the Senate Report recounted what it regarded as the\n\nrelevant facts of the case:\n\n       The evidence showed that the ghetto area voted\n       Democratic, that the Republicans won four of the five\n       elections from 1960 to 1968, and that in 1964, when the\n       Democrats won, ghetto area senators and representatives\n       were elected. Nine blacks had in fact been elected to\n       the legislature from the at-large districts between\n       [1960] and 1968.\n\nId. at 20-21, reprinted in 1982 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News at\n\n198.     The facts cited by the Senate mirror those previously\n\nidentified   by    Justice   Marshall    in    Bolden   and    stressed    here:\n\nPlaintiffs were unsuccessful in years in which their party suffered\n\nelectoral defeat; they were able to elect representatives of their\n\nchoice when their party prevailed.            Not surprisingly, the Senate\n\n\n\n\n                                    47\n\fadopted     Whitcomb's     central     teaching    in     presenting    what     it\n\nunderstood to be the kernel of the decision:\n\n     The failure of the ghetto to have legislative seats in\n     proportion to its population emerges more as a function\n     of losing elections than of built-in bias against poor\n     Negroes. The voting power of ghetto residents may have\n     been \"cancelled out,\" as the district court held, but\n     this seems a mere euphemism for political defeat at the\n     polls.\n\nId. at 21 (quoting Whitcomb, 403 U.S. at 153), reprinted in 1982\n\nU.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News at 198.\n\n     In keeping with Whitcomb's sharp distinction between \"built-in\n\nbias\" and \"political defeat at the polls,\" the Senate Report\n\nindicated that a proper application of the results test requires\n\ncourts    to   \"distinguish[]      between     situations      in   which   racial\n\npolitics play an excessive role in the electoral process, and\n\ncommunities in which they do not.\"             Id. at 33, reprinted in 1982\n\nU.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News at 211.              The Senate Report, again\n\nfollowing      Whitcomb,    accorded    this    inquiry    into     \"racial    bloc\n\nvoting,\" that is, whether \"'race is the predominant determinant of\n\npolitical preference,'\" dispositive significance: Absent a showing\n\nof \"racial bloc voting,\" the Senate Report asserted, \"it would be\n\nexceedingly     difficult    for   plaintiffs     to    show    that   they    were\n\neffectively excluded from fair access to the political process\n\nunder the results test.\"       Id. (quoting S.Rep. 417 at 148 (Report of\n\nthe Subcommittee on the Constitution)), reprinted in 1982 U.S. Code\n\nCong. & Admin. News at 321).             Since the results test itself,\n\ncontrary to critics' charges, \"makes no assumptions one way or the\n\nother about the role of racial political considerations in a\n\n\n                                        48\n\fparticular community,\" id. at 34, reprinted in 1982 U.S. Code Cong.\n\n& Admin. News at 212, the Senate Report emphasized that plaintiffs\n\nmust supply affirmative proof of \"racial bloc voting.\"               The \"mere\n\nexistence of underrepresentation plus a history of dual schools\"\n\nplainly does not suffice to make out a violation of § 2.               Id.\n\n       It is difficult to see how the record in this case could\n\npossibly support a finding of liability under the approach outlined\n\nin the Senate Report.            Plaintiffs have not even attempted to\n\nestablish proof of racial bloc voting by demonstrating that \"race,\"\n\nnot,    as    defendants      contend,    partisan    affiliation,    \"is     the\n\npredominant      determinant     of    political   preference.\"      They   have\n\ninstead maintained, in the very teeth of the Senate Report, that\n\nsuch a showing is unnecessary. Because the district court accepted\n\nthis argument, the test employed at trial enabled plaintiffs to\n\nprevail by proving little more than a lack of success at the polls\n\nand a history of discrimination.              While this standard finds clear\n\nsupport in Justice Brennan's plurality opinion in Thornburg v.\n\nGingles, 478 U.S. 30 (1986), it \"simply was not the approach used\n\nby   the     courts   under   the     White/Zimmer   test\"   and   codified   by\n\nCongress. S. Rep. 417 at 34, reprinted in 1982 U.S. Code Cong. &\n\nAdmin. News at 212.\n\n                           C. Thornburg v. Gingles\n\n       Justice Brennan's discussion of the first and second Gingles\n\nfactors received majority support.               Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50-51,\n\n\n\n\n                                         49\n\f56.25        With respect to the third element, however, five justices\n\nrejected Justice Brennan's proposed standard for proving racial\n\nbloc voting.         Id. at 83 (White, J., concurring); id. at 100-01\n\n(O'Connor, J., joined by Burger, C.J., Powell and Rehnquist, JJ.,\n\nconcurring).         For this reason, we believe that it is to these\n\nopinions, not Justice Brennan's, that we should look in attempting\n\nto define the contours of the inquiry into legally significant bloc\n\nvoting.\n\n        Despite the presence of express language to the contrary in\n\nthe Senate Report, see S. Rep. 417 at 33 (\"racial bloc voting\" is\n\nestablished when \"race is the predominant determinant of political\n\npreference\"), reprinted in 1982 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News at\n\n211, Justice Brennan held that racial bloc voting or \"racially\n\npolarized voting\" did not describe divergent \"voting patterns for\n\nwhich the principal cause is race.\"                Gingles, 478 U.S. at 61.\n\nInstead, he asserted that \"[i]t is the difference between the\n\nchoices made        by   blacks   and    whites--not    the   reasons   for     that\n\ndifference--that [matters].\"             Id.   A consideration of \"irrelevant\n\nvariables\"        such   as   partisan    affiliation   or    the   race   of   the\n\ncandidate, Justice Brennan urged, would \"distort[] the equation and\n\n\n\n\n        25\n      In order to make out a § 2 vote dilution claim under\nGingles, minority plaintiffs challenging an at-large system must\nprove that: (1) the group is sufficiently large and\ngeographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-\nmember district; (2) it is politically cohesive; and (3) the\nwhite majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it usually\nto defeat the minority's preferred candidate. Gingles, 478 U.S.\nat 50-51.\n\n                                          50\n\fyield[] results that are indisputably incorrect under § 2 and the\n\nSenate Report.\"     Id. at 64.\n\n     Justice      Brennan's      assertion     that   racial   political\n\nconsiderations had no role in examining racial bloc voting was\n\nsquarely rejected by five Justices in Gingles.           478 U.S. at 83\n\n(White, J., concurring); id. at 100-01 (O'Connor, J., joined by\n\nBurger, C.J., Powell and Rehnquist, JJ., concurring).            Justice\n\nWhite argued that\n\n     Justice Brennan states in Part III-C that the crucial\n     factor in identifying polarized voting is the race of the\n     voter and that the race of the candidate is irrelevant.\n     Under this test, there is polarized voting if the\n     majority of white voters vote for different candidates\n     than the majority of the blacks, regardless of the race\n     of the candidates. I do not agree. Suppose an eight-\n     member multimember district that is 60% white and 40%\n     black, the blacks being geographically located so that\n     two safe black single-member districts could be drawn.\n     Suppose further that there are six white and two black\n     Democrats running against six white and two black\n     Republicans. Under Justice Brennan's test, there would\n     be polarized voting and a likely § 2 violation if all the\n     Republicans, including the two blacks, are elected, and\n     80% of the blacks in the predominately black areas vote\n     Democratic . . . .      This is interest-group politics\n     rather than a rule hedging against racial discrimination.\n     I doubt that this is what Congress had in mind in\n     amending § 2 as it did, and it seems quite at odds with\n     the discussion in Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124, 149-\n     160 (1971).\n\nId. at 83 (White, J., concurring) (emphasis added).              Justice\n\nO'Connor joined Justice White in maintaining that evidence that\n\nwhite and minority voters generally supported different candidates\n\ndid not constitute legally significant racial bloc voting where\n\nthese patterns were attributable to partisan affiliation rather\n\nthan the race of the candidate.           She therefore rejected Justice\n\nBrennan's position that\n\n                                     51\n\f     evidence that the divergent racial voting patterns may be\n     explained in part by causes other than race, such as an\n     underlying divergence in the interests of minority and\n     white voters . . . . can never affect the overall vote\n     dilution inquiry. Evidence that a candidate preferred by\n     the minority group in a particular election was rejected\n     by white voters for reasons other than those which made\n     that candidate the preferred choice of the minority group\n     would seem clearly relevant in answering the question\n     whether bloc voting by white voters will consistently\n     defeat minority candidates. Such evidence would suggest\n     that another candidate, equally preferred by the minority\n     group, might be able to attract greater white support in\n     future elections.\n\n          I believe Congress also intended that explanations\n     of the reasons why white voters rejected minority\n     candidates would be probative of the likelihood that\n     candidates elected without decisive minority support\n     would be willing to take the minority's interests into\n     account. In a community that is polarized along racial\n     lines, racial hostility may bar these and other indirect\n     avenues of political influence to a much greater extent\n     than in a community where racial animosity is absent\n     although the interests of racial groups diverge. Indeed,\n     the Senate Report clearly stated that one factor that\n     could have probative value in § 2 cases was \"whether\n     there is a significant lack of responsiveness on the part\n     of elected officials to the particularized needs of the\n     members of the minority group.\" S. Rep., at 29. The\n     overall vote dilution inquiry neither requires nor\n     permits an arbitrary rule against consideration of all\n     evidence concerning voting preferences other than\n     statistical evidence of racial voting patterns. Such a\n     rule would give no effect whatever to the Senate Report's\n     repeated emphasis on \"intensive racial politics,\" on\n     \"racial political considerations,\" and on whether \"racial\n     politics . . . dominate the electoral process\" as one\n     aspect of the \"racial bloc voting\" that Congress deemed\n     relevant to showing a § 2 violation.      Id., at 33-34.\n     Similarly, I agree with Justice White that Justice\n     Brennan's conclusion that the race of the candidate is\n     always irrelevant in identifying racially polarized\n     voting conflicts with Whitcomb and is not necessary to\n     the disposition of this case. Ante, at 83 (concurring).\n\nId. at 100-01 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (emphasis added).\n\n     As courts and commentators alike have noted, Justice White and\n\nJustice O'Connor were united in their fidelity to Whitcomb's\n\n\n                                52\n\fdistinction between vote dilution and partisan politics and in\n\ntheir opposition to Justice Brennan's attempt to expunge this\n\nteaching from the bloc voting inquiry.               See, e.g., Baird v.\n\nConsolidated City of Indianapolis, 976 F.2d 357, 361 (7th Cir.\n\n1992) (\"Justice White . . . observ[ed] that system leading to the\n\nelection   of   black     Republicans     could   not   be    dismissed    as\n\ndiscriminatory.    To disregard the race of the victors, Justice\n\nWhite concluded, 'is interest-group politics rather than a rule\n\nhedging against racial discrimination.' Justice O'Connor agreed\")\n\n(citation omitted); Note, Voting Rights Act Section 2: Racially\n\nPolarized Voting and the Minority Community's Representative of\n\nChoice, 89 Mich. L. Rev. 1038, 1044 (1991); Note, Defining the\n\nMinority Preferred Candidate Under Section 2, 99 Yale L.J. 1651,\n\n1662-63 (1990).     The division in Gingles between the Brennan\n\nplurality and the five Justices who supported the White/O'Connor\n\napproach cuts deep, reflecting quite different visions of voting\n\nrights and their statutory treatment.         Since these five Justices\n\nexpressly rejected a test that would permit § 2 liability to attach\n\nupon a showing that white and black citizens generally gave their\n\nvotes to different candidates in favor of an inquiry into the\n\npossible   explanations    of   these    divergent   voting   patterns,    we\n\nbelieve that it is this view, not Justice Brennan's, that commands\n\nour allegiance.    The district court's failure to accord similar\n\nweight to this approach was not justified.\n\n     All members of the Court in Gingles agreed that only \"legally\n\nsignificant\" racial bloc voting is cognizable under § 2.                  They\n\n\n                                    53\n\fdisagreed   sharply,    however,   on      the   sort   of   proof   that   would\n\nimplicate this provision.      Justice Brennan held that a \"minority\n\nmust   be   able   to   demonstrate     that     the    white   majority    votes\n\nsufficiently as a bloc to enable it . . . usually to defeat the\n\nminority's preferred candidate.\" Gingles, 478 U.S. at 51. Justice\n\nO'Connor, on the other hand, argued that such a showing did not\n\nwarrant judicial intervention: \"[A] reviewing court should be\n\nrequired to find more than simply that the minority group does not\n\nusually attain an undiluted measure of electoral success.\"                  Id. at\n\n99 (O'Connor, J., concurring).        Instead, she would require a court\n\nto \"find that even substantial minority success will be highly\n\ninfrequent under the challenged plan before it may conclude, on\n\nthis basis alone, that the plan operates to 'cancel out or minimize\n\nthe voting strength of [the] racial grou[p].'\"                   Id. at 99-100\n\n(quoting White, 412 U.S. at 765) (alterations in original).\n\n       Justice O'Connor's admonition that federal courts should stay\n\ntheir hand absent proof that \"even substantial minority success\n\nwill be highly infrequent\" receives formal expression in her\n\ninsistence that the racial bloc voting inquiry must include an\n\nexamination of the causes underlying divergent voting patterns.\n\nBoth Justice Brennan and Justice O'Connor recognized that racial\n\nbloc voting is intimately related to the responsiveness of elected\n\nofficials to the interests of minorities, one of the factors\n\nconsidered as part of the \"totality of circumstances.\" As Justice\n\nBrennan indicated, \"[n]ot only does '[v]oting along racial lines'\n\ndeprive minority voters of their preferred representatives in these\n\n\n                                      54\n\fcircumstances, it also 'allows those elected to ignore [minority]\n\ninterests without fear of political consequences.'\" Id. at 48 n.14\n\n(quoting Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. 613, 623 (1982) (alterations in\n\noriginal)). The close tie between bloc voting and representatives'\n\nresponsiveness noted by the Court in Rogers and confirmed by\n\nJustice Brennan rests on common sense: Public officials need not\n\naddress concerns expressed by minorities so long as white bloc\n\nvoting ensures that they will remain minority concerns.   The Court\n\nin Rogers and Justice Brennan, however, differed sharply over the\n\nsort of polarized voting that might provide elected officials with\n\nsuch assurances and federal courts with grounds to intervene.   The\n\nCourt in Rogers held that this close identification was warranted\n\nonly where racial political considerations were present, that is,\n\nwhere white bloc voting caused \"minority candidates [to] lose\n\nelections solely because of their race.\"   Rogers, 458 U.S. at 623\n\n(emphasis added). Justice Brennan's approach, by contrast, assumes\n\nthat political leaders may safely ignore minority concerns even\n\nwhere black and white voters are separated only by differing\n\ninterests.   Put another way, Justice Brennan's bloc voting test\n\naccords governing majorities linked only by the perception of\n\ncommon interests the same permanence and thus relevance under § 2\n\nas white blocs cemented by racial prejudice.\n\n     Justice O'Connor not only rejected Justice Brennan's polarized\n\nvoting standard but was also unwilling to join in the questionable\n\nassumption that minorities are unable to influence elections and\n\nsecure the attention of public officials where these groups have\n\n\n                                55\n\fbeen    unsuccessful      in    their    efforts      to   elect    their      preferred\n\nrepresentatives.          Gingles, 478 U.S. at 100-101 (O'Connor, J.,\n\nconcurring).       Unlike Justice Brennan, she argued that \"Congress\n\nalso intended that explanations of the reasons why white voters\n\nrejected minority candidates would be probative of the likelihood\n\nthat candidates elected without decisive minority support would be\n\nwilling to take the minority's interests into account.\"                       Id. at 100\n\n(O'Connor, J., concurring).              Following Rogers, Justice O'Connor\n\nbelieved that a minority group's prospects for future electoral\n\nsuccess and the likelihood that elected officials will take account\n\nof their interests differ materially \"in a community where racial\n\nanimosity    is    absent      although    the   interests         of    racial   groups\n\ndiverge.\" Id. (O'Connor, J., concurring). A tendency among whites\n\nto cast their votes on the basis of race presents a far more\n\ndurable obstacle to the coalition-building upon which minority\n\nelectoral success depends than disagreements over ideology for, as\n\nProfessor    Ely    observes,      \"prejudice         blinds   us       to   overlapping\n\ninterests    that    in   fact    exist.\"      John    Hart    Ely,      Democracy   and\n\nDistrust 153 (1980).           Representatives who owe their office to the\n\nsupport of majorities bound by prejudice need not attend to the\n\ninterests of minorities, since the bias uniting their constituents\n\nensures that these issues will remain minority concerns. Where, on\n\nthe other hand, voting patterns correlate with partisan affiliation\n\nor     perceived    interest,      the    open     channels        of    communication\n\nfacilitate a recognition of points of common ground that might\n\notherwise go undetected.           Elected officials in these communities\n\n\n                                          56\n\fcannot ignore minority interests because this group might be part\n\nof the winning coalition that votes them out of office.        The deep\n\ndivision between Justice Brennan and Justice O'Connor on the\n\nquestion   of   racial   bloc   voting   thus   reflects   fundamentally\n\ndifferent views of political factions and our constitutional and\n\nstatutory arrangements for accommodating their simultaneous demands\n\nfor fluidity and fixity.26\n\n     26\n      The dissent contends that we have departed from\ncontrolling Supreme Court precedent in requiring plaintiffs to\nshow more than divergent voting patterns among white and minority\nvoters in order to establish legally significant bloc voting.\nThe dissent properly points out that a majority of the Court in\nGingles held that racial bloc voting rests on proof that \"the\nwhite majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it . . .\nusually to defeat the minority's preferred candidate.\" Gingles,\n478 U.S. at 51. As the Court's recent unanimous decision in\nVoinovich v. Quilter, 113 S. Ct. 1149, 1157 (1993), indicates,\nthis standard is hardly controversial. The Justices in Gingles,\nhowever, were sharply divided on the crucial, separate issue of\nthe sort of showing necessary to establish \"legally significant\"\nbloc voting--that is, the conditions that enable courts to\npredict that a majority bloc will consistently \"defeat the\nminority's preferred candidate.\" The dissent correctly concludes\nthat the approach taken by Justice White and Justice O'Connor,\nrather than that offered by Justice Brennan, should govern this\nsecond inquiry. Thus, we are in full agreement with the dissent\nthat the possible causes of polarized voting must be examined\nbecause \"they call into question the consistency with which the\nwhite bloc will oppose minority-preferred candidates.\" Dissent\nat ___.\n     As we state in the text, we regard evidence that divergent\nvoting patterns are attributable to partisan affiliation or\nperceived interests rather than race as quite probative on the\nquestion of a minority group's future success at the polls. The\ndissent, however, while apparently willing to consider other\npossible non-racial causes, asserts that partisan affiliation is\ninsignificant. We are told, in fact, that \"the Voting Rights\nAct, as interpreted in Gingles and succeeding cases, presupposes\npartisan voting.\" Dissent at ___. This refusal to distinguish\nracial politics from partisan politics strikes us as utterly\ninconsistent with the unbroken line of authority extending from\nWhitcomb and White through Justice Marshall's dissent in Bolden\nand the 1982 amendments to the controlling concurring opinions in\nGingles the dissent purports to embrace.\n\n                                   57\n\f      Given that the divergent voting patterns in this case are in\n\nmost instances attributable to partisan affiliation rather than\n\nrace, it is thus far from coincidental that the district court\n\nfound no evidence of unresponsiveness on the part of elected\n\nofficials in any of the contested counties.   The irony, of course,\n\nis that the subdistricting remedy sought by plaintiffs provides\n\nmost judges with the same opportunity to ignore minority voters'\n\ninterests without fear of political reprisal they would possess if\n\nelections were in fact dominated by racial bloc voting.\n\n                       D. Partisan Politics\n\n     We need not hold that plaintiffs must supply conclusive proof\n\nthat a minority group's failure to elect representatives of its\n\nchoice is caused by racial animus in the white electorate in order\n\nto decide that the district court's judgment must be reversed.   It\n\nis true that such a requirement could be inferred from the text of\n\n§ 2 (prohibiting \"denial[s] or abridgement[s] of the right . . . to\n\nvote on account of race or color\"); the caselaw Congress intended\n\nto codify in amending the provision, see, e.g., Whitcomb, 403 U.S.\n\nat 153 (vote dilution does not lie when losses at the polls do not\n\nreflect \"built-in bias against poor Negroes\"); the Senate Report,\n\nsee S. Rep. 417 at 33 (equating proof of racial bloc voting with\n\nevidence that \"race is the predominant determinant of political\n\npreference\"), reprinted in 1982 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News at\n\n211; the testimony of prominent supporters of the Act, see, e.g.,\n\nHearings on the Voting Rights Act Before the Subcomm. on the\n\nConstitution of the Senate Comm. of the Judiciary, 97th Cong., 2d\n\n\n                                58\n\fSess. 1367-68 (statement of Prof. Drew Days) (§ 2 implicated \"where\n\na combination of public activity and private discrimination have\n\njoined to make it virtually impossible for minorities to play a\n\nmeaningful role in the electoral process\"); and the controlling\n\nopinions of the Supreme Court.             See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 100\n\n(O'Connor,    J.,   concurring)     (distinguishing    communities   where\n\npolarized voting is attributable to \"racial hostility\" and those in\n\nwhich \"racial animosity is absent although the interests of racial\n\ngroups diverge\").      There is also a powerful argument supporting a\n\nrule that plaintiffs to establish legally significant racial bloc\n\nvoting must prove that their failure to elect representatives of\n\ntheir choice cannot be characterized as a \"mere euphemism for\n\npolitical defeat at the polls,\" Whitcomb, 403 U.S. at 153, or the\n\n\"result\" of \"partisan politics.\" Bolden, 446 U.S. at 100 (Marshall,\n\nJ., dissenting).\n\n     Describing plaintiffs' burden in terms of negating \"partisan\n\npolitics\" rather than affirmatively proving \"racial animus\"          would\n\nnot be simply a matter of nomenclature.         As Judge Wood emphasizes,\n\nthere are many other possible non-racial causes of voter behavior\n\nbeyond partisan affiliation.        A rule conditioning relief under § 2\n\nupon proof of the existence of racial animus in the electorate\n\nwould require plaintiffs to establish the absence of not only\n\npartisan     voting,   but   also    all    other   potentially   innocent\n\nexplanations for white voters' rejection of minority-preferred\n\ncandidates.    Factors that might legitimately lead white voters to\n\nwithhold support from particular minority candidates include, for\n\n\n                                     59\n\fexample, limited campaign funds, inexperience, or a reputation\n\nbesmirched by scandal.       Because these additional factors map only\n\nimperfectly     onto    partisan    affiliation,    detailed   multivariate\n\nanalysis might then be the evidence of choice.          The argument would\n\nthen be that without this additional inquiry, courts that confine\n\ntheir scrutiny to partisan voting might well find racial bloc\n\nvoting in circumstances where the losses of minority-preferred\n\ncandidates were actually attributable to causes other than race.\n\nThis result it is urged, might unfairly tip the scales in favor of\n\nliability.\n\n       This argument possesses considerable force.           Certainly, the\n\nallocation of proof in § 2 cases must reflect the central purpose\n\nof the Voting Rights Act and its intended liberality as well as the\n\npractical difficulties of proof in the real world of trial.              In\n\ncountless areas of the law weighty legal conclusions frequently\n\nrest on methodologies that would make scientists blush. The use of\n\nsuch    blunt   instruments    in    examining     complex   phenomena   and\n\ncorresponding reliance on inference owes not so much to a lack of\n\ntechnical sophistication among judges, although this is often true,\n\nbut to an awareness that greater certitude frequently may be\n\npurchased only at the expense of other values.           Here, we are told\n\nthat we cannot ignore the significant and, assertedly, unacceptable\n\nsubstantive consequences that would accompany a more nuanced bloc\n\nvoting inquiry.        Requiring plaintiffs affirmatively to establish\n\nthat white voters' rejection of minority-preferred candidates was\n\nmotivated by racial animus would make racial bloc voting both\n\n\n                                      60\n\fdifficult and, considering the additional analysis that would be\n\nneeded, expensive to establish. See, e.g., McCrary, Discriminatory\n\nIntent: The Continuing Relevance of \"Purpose\" Evidence in Vote-\n\nDilution Lawsuits, 28 How. L. J. 463, 492 (1985).              Moreover, it\n\nwould facilitate the use of thinly-veiled proxies by permitting,\n\nfor example, evidence that a minority candidate was regarded as\n\n\"unqualified\" or \"corrupt\" to defeat a claim that white voters'\n\nrefusal to support him was based on race or ethnicity.                    The\n\nargument continues that an inquiry into causation beyond partisan\n\naffiliation    seems   inconsistent   with       the   fundamental    division\n\nbetween \"partisan politics\" and \"racial vote dilution\" set out by\n\nthe Court in Whitcomb and White and confirmed by Congress.               Legal\n\nstandards     of   necessity   reflect       a     balance    of     competing\n\nconsiderations.    Finally, the argument continues that limiting the\n\nracial bloc voting inquiry to a determination whether or not\n\ndivergent voting patterns are attributable to partisan differences\n\nor an underlying divergence in interests best captures the mandate\n\nof § 2.27   Having said this, we need not resolve the debate today.\n\nWhether or not the burden of the plaintiffs to prove bloc voting\n\nincludes the burden to explain partisan influence, the result is\n\nthe same.     This is so even if the partisan voting is viewed as a\n\ndefensive parry.\n\n\n\n     27\n      The facts of this case do not require us to determine\nwhether defendants may attempt to prove that losses by minority-\npreferred candidates are attributable to non-racial causes other\nthan partisan affiliation. We express no opinion on this\nentirely separate question.\n\n                                  61\n\f      Finally, we recognize that even partisan affiliation may serve\n\nas proxy for illegitimate racial considerations.       Minority voters,\n\nat least those residing in the contested counties in this case,\n\nhave tended uniformly to support the Democratic Party. At the same\n\ntime, a majority of white voters in most counties have consistently\n\nvoted for district court candidates fielded by the Republican\n\nParty.    Noting   this   persistent,   albeit   imperfect   correlation\n\nbetween party and race, plaintiffs assert that a determination that\n\npartisan affiliation best explains voting patterns should not\n\nforeclose § 2 liability in this case because the Republican and\n\nDemocratic Parties are proxies for racial and ethnic groups in\n\nTexas.   Whitcomb's distinction between \"racial vote dilution\" and\n\n\"political defeat at the polls\" should not control, they contend,\n\nfor      \"partisan        politics\"     is       \"racial     politics.\"\n\n\n\n      We fully agree with the plaintiffs that the bloc voting\n\ninquiry, like the \"question whether the political processes are\n\n'equally open,'\" must rest \"upon a searching practical evaluation\n\nof the 'past and present reality.'\" S.Rep. 417 at 30 (quoting\n\nWhite, 412 U.S. at 769-770), reprinted in 1982 U.S. Code Cong. &\n\nAdmin. News at 208.        Indeed, the refusal of Congress and the\n\nSupreme Court to equate losses at the polls with actionable vote\n\ndilution where these unfavorable results owe more to party than\n\nrace may be traced directly to this \"functional\" view of political\n\nlife.    Plaintiffs are therefore entirely correct in maintaining\n\nthat courts should not summarily dismiss vote dilution claims in\n\n\n                                  62\n\fcases where racially divergent voting patterns correspond with\n\npartisan affiliation as \"political defeats\" not cognizable under\n\n§ 2.\n\n       We do not agree, however, that a \"functional\" and \"practical\"\n\nreview of Texas judicial elections exposes political parties as\n\nproxies for race or ethnicity.       In assessing the record before us,\n\nwe do not indulge in the hopeful yet unrealistic assumption that\n\ndecisions to support particular political parties among black and\n\nwhite voters in all cases rest on issues other than race.               We\n\ninstead focus on the same two factors cited by the Court in\n\nWhitcomb and the concurring Justices in Gingles.            First, white\n\nvoters constitute the majority of not only the Republican Party,\n\nbut also the Democratic Party, even in several of the counties in\n\nwhich the former dominates.     In Dallas County, for example, 30-40%\n\nof   white   voters   consistently   support   Democrats,   making   white\n\nDemocrats more numerous than all of the minority Democratic voters\n\ncombined.    The suggestion that Republican voters are galvanized by\n\na \"white\" or \"anti-minority\" agenda is plausible only to the extent\n\nthat the Democratic Party can be viewed as a vehicle for advancing\n\ndistinctively minority interests, which clearly is not the case.\n\nAt the same time, white Democrats have in recent years experienced\n\nthe same electoral defeats as minority voters.        If we are to hold\n\nthat these losses at the polls, without more, give rise to a racial\n\nvote dilution claim warranting special relief for minority voters,\n\na principle by which we might justify withholding similar relief\n\n\n\n\n                                     63\n\ffrom white Democrats is not readily apparent.          See Whitcomb, 403\n\nU.S. at 153.\n\n     Second,    both     political    parties,   and       especially   the\n\nRepublicans, aggressively recruited minority lawyers to run on\n\ntheir party's ticket.        Consequently, white as well as minority\n\nvoters found themselves not infrequently voting against candidates\n\nsharing their respective racial or ethnic backgrounds in favor of\n\ntheir party's nominee.        In particular, the undisputed evidence\n\ndiscloses that white voters in most counties, both Republican and\n\nDemocratic, without fail supported the minority candidates slated\n\nby their parties at levels equal to or greater than those enjoyed\n\nby white candidates, even where the minority candidate was opposed\n\nby a white candidate. In Dallas County, for example, Judge Wright,\n\na black woman, received the greatest recorded percentage of the\n\nwhite vote (77%) in her race against a white Democrat.         To conclude\n\non this record that political parties serve as proxies for race is\n\nsimply    unwarranted.    Because    the   evidence   in   most   instances\n\nunmistakably shows that divergent voting patterns among white and\n\nminority voters are best explained by partisan affiliation, we\n\nconclude that plaintiffs have failed to establish racial bloc\n\nvoting in most, but not all, of the counties.28\n\n                             E. Two Objections\n\n     The Houston Lawyers' Association and amicus the United States\n\nraise     two   particular      objections    that     merit      additional\n\n     28\n      Defendant Judge Entz has contended throughout this\nlitigation that § 2, as amended, is unconstitutional. In view of\nour construction of the statute, we need not reach this question.\n\n                                     64\n\fconsideration. These arguments closely track those made by Justice\n\nBrennan--arguments rejected by five members of the Supreme Court in\n\nGingles.    Nevertheless, the urgency with which they are pressed\n\nhere warrants a further explanation of the reasons underlying the\n\nviews expressed by Justice White and Justice O'Connor in their\n\nseparate opinions.\n\n     The Association contends that a requirement that plaintiffs\n\nprove that their failure to elect representatives of their choice\n\nis   attributable     to    white     bloc     voting     rooted    in     racial\n\nconsiderations is presumptively inconsistent with § 2's focus on\n\n\"results.\" The Association reads this test to impose on plaintiffs\n\nthe burden of affirmatively establishing that white voters are\n\nmotivated     by   racial   animus     in     selecting    candidates.        So\n\ncharacterized, the racial bloc voting standard we apply today\n\nallegedly     contravenes   the     fundamental     purpose    of    the    1982\n\namendments by reintroducing the \"intent\" test announced in Mobile\n\nv. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55 (1980).         See also Richard L. Engstrom, The\n\nReincarnation of the Intent Standard: Federal Judges and At-Large\n\nElection Cases, 28 How. L. J. 495, 498 (1985).             That is not so.\n\n     The    Association     does     not     seriously    contend    that    the\n\nlegislative history accompanying the amendments to § 2 lends direct\n\nsupport for its position.         The Senate Report quite unambiguously\n\ndeclares that Congress intended to \"make clear that plaintiffs need\n\nnot prove a discriminatory purpose in the adoption or maintenance\n\nof the challenged practice or system in order to establish a\n\nviolation.\"    S. Rep. 417 at 27 (emphasis added), reprinted in 1982\n\n\n                                      65\n\fU.S. Code Cong. & Admin News at 205.            Moreover, far from suggesting\n\nthat    the     presence    of    racial    animus    in   the    electorate      was\n\nirrelevant, supporters of the 1982 legislation maintained that the\n\namendments were necessary precisely in order to reach such \"private\n\ndiscrimination.\"          See, e.g., Hearings on the Voting Rights Act\n\nBefore the Subcomm. on the Constitution of the Senate Comm. of the\n\nJudiciary, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 1367-68 (statement of Prof. Drew\n\nDays).    The Association instead insists that a standard requiring\n\n§ 2 plaintiffs to show that their failure to elect representatives\n\nof their choice is attributable to white bloc voting rooted in\n\nracial considerations \"frustrate[s] the goals Congress sought to\n\nachieve by repudiating the intent test of [Bolden].\"                   Gingles, 478\n\nU.S. at 71 (opinion of Brennan, J.).              Given the palpable tension\n\nbetween \"the       goals    Congress   sought    to    achieve\"    and    those    it\n\nactually expressed, it is hardly surprising that the principles the\n\nAssociation purports to locate in the Senate Report bear only a\n\npassing resemblance to those offered by Congress. Compare Gingles,\n\n478 U.S. at 70-73 (opinion of Brennan, J.) with S. Rep. 417 at 36-\n\n37, reprinted in 1982 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin News at 214-15.\n\n       More importantly, the Association's contention that an inquiry\n\ninto the explanations underlying racially divergent voting patterns\n\nsomehow       conflicts    with    Congress'    abandonment       of   the   intent\n\nrequirement announced in Bolden completely ignores the fact that\n\nthe Senate Report expressly adopted the standard we employ in\n\ncodifying the \"results\" test.              Indeed, like Justice Marshall in\n\nBolden itself, see 446 U.S. at 109 (Marshall, J., dissenting), the\n\n\n                                           66\n\fSenate Report reiterated Whitcomb's holding that \"[t]he failure of\n\nthe   ghetto   to    have   legislative       seats   in    proportion   to    its\n\npopulation emerges more as a function of losing elections than of\n\nbuilt-in bias against poor Negroes\" precisely in order to show that\n\n\"intent had [not] been required to prove a violation.\"                S. Rep. 417\n\nat 21 (quoting Whitcomb, 403 U.S. at 153), reprinted in 1982 U.S.\n\nCode Cong. & Admin News at 198.              In keeping with Whitcomb, the\n\nSenate Report equated \"racial bloc voting\" with proof that \"race is\n\nthe predominant determinant of political preference.\"                 Id. at 33,\n\nreprinted in 1982 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin News at 211.                         The\n\nAssociation's       assertion   that    the    test    we   confirm    today    is\n\ninconsistent    with    \"the    goals   Congress      sought   to   achieve\"   in\n\namending § 2 becomes plausible only if Whitcomb is purged from our\n\nvoting rights jurisprudence. It is therefore not coincidental that\n\nits brief, like Justice Brennan's opinion, see Gingles, 478 U.S. at\n\n61-74, fails to include a citation, let alone a discussion, of the\n\ndecision Congress intended to codify.\n\n      The United States offers a second argument incorporating\n\nelements of Justice O'Connor's as well as Justice Brennan's opinion\n\nin Gingles.     The government agrees with Justice O'Connor that an\n\ninquiry into the causes underlying polarized voting is appropriate\n\nin certain circumstances.        It follows Justice Brennan, however, in\n\nmaintaining that evidence tending to show that divergent voting\n\npatterns are attributable to partisan affiliation or a divergence\n\nin interests rather than race is irrelevant in assessing whether\n\n\n\n\n                                        67\n\fplaintiffs have established legally significant white bloc voting.\n\nWe disagree with this argument as well.\n\n     The United States' assertion that partisan affiliation cannot\n\nserve to explain voting patterns finds no support in Justice\n\nO'Connor's opinion.         The very inquiry it seeks to exclude--whether\n\nelection returns track \"an underlying divergence in the interests\n\nof minority and white voters,\"--was the only non-racial cause\n\nexpressly    cited    in    her   opinion       as     a   possible   explanation     of\n\ndivergent voting patterns. See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 100 (O'Connor,\n\nJ., concurring).\n\n     The    United    States      argues       that    the   political     differences\n\nfrequently observed among white and minority voters are largely the\n\nproduct     of    disparities       in   socioeconomic           status,    which   are\n\nthemselves       attributable     to     the    presence      or    absence   of    past\n\ndiscrimination.        In    this    view,      a     standard     that   would   permit\n\ndivergence in interest to preclude the establishment of racial bloc\n\nvoting \"would render meaningless the Senate Report factor that\n\naddresses the impact of low socioeconomic status on a minority\n\ngroup's level of participation.\"                Gingles, 478 U.S. at 69.\n\n     This argument is not without force; it is, however, clearly\n\nforeclosed by the Senate Report.                 Congress was not unaware that\n\npolitical preference often correlates strongly with socioeconomic\n\nstatus; particularized needs clearly give rise to particularized\n\ninterests.       This observation did not, however, lead Congress to\n\nsoften the line between partisan politics and racial vote dilution\n\nestablished by the Court in Whitcomb.

The effects of past discrimination, as the text of the\n\nSenate Report indicates, pertain solely to the \"political access\"\n\nprong of a § 2 claim.        It is by considering these effects in this\n\nregard, not in the bloc voting inquiry, that courts give effect to\n\ncongressional intent.

Other Legal Errors Affecting the Vote Dilution Inquiry\n\n     Defendants cite three additional legal errors that allegedly\n\ninfect the district court's findings of illegal vote dilution in\n\neach of the counties.      Specifically, they argue that the district\n\ncourt    erred    in:    (1)   excluding   elections   pitting   Hispanic\n\ncandidates against white candidates in counties in which the\n\nevidence unmistakably showed that black and Hispanic voters were\n\ncohesive; (2) refusing to consider the paucity of minority lawyers\n\nin assessing the extent to which members of minority groups had\n\nbeen elected to the district court; and (3) finding that the\n\neffects of past discrimination hindered the ability of minority\n\ngroups to participate in the political process despite the presence\n\nof little or no evidence suggesting that their participation was in\n\nfact depressed.      We examine these issues in turn.\n\n            A. Cohesiveness of Different Minority Groups\n\n     The importance of the distinction in § 2 jurisprudence between\n\nillegal vote dilution and political defeat, between protecting\n\nracial minorities and fostering the work of political coalitions,\n\nraises the stakes for the question whether different racial or\n\nethnic minority groups, usually blacks and Hispanics, may combine\n\nto form a single minority group within the meaning of the Voting\n\nRights Act.      Judges and commentators alike have questioned whether\n\ntransitory unions rooted in political expedience may be properly\n\nequated with those whose source lies in the more enduring bonds\n\nsupplied by a shared race or ethnicity.         League of United Latin\n\nAmerican Citizens v. Midland Indep. School District, 812 F.2d 1494,\n\n\n                                    71\n\f1505-07 (5th Cir. 1987) (Higginbotham, J., dissenting); Katherine\n\nI. Butler & Richard Murray, Minority Vote Dilution Suits and the\n\nProblem of Two Minority Groups: Can a 'Rainbow Coalition' Claim the\n\nProtection of the Voting Rights Act?, 21 Pacific L.J. 619, 641-57\n\n(1990).   Nevertheless, we have treated the issue as a question of\n\nfact, allowing aggregation of different minority groups where the\n\nevidence suggests that they are politically cohesive, see, e.g.,\n\nMidland I.S.D., 812 F.2d at 1500-02, and we need not revisit this\n\nquestion here.\n\n     This issue is raised today in the context of the particular\n\nelections to which the district court looked as part of its inquiry\n\ninto racial bloc voting.    This court has consistently held that\n\nelections between white candidates are generally less probative in\n\nexamining the success of minority-preferred candidates, generally\n\non grounds that such elections do not provide minority voters with\n\nthe choice of a minority candidate.   See, e.g., Campos v. City of\n\nBaytown, 840 F.2d 1240, 1245 (5th Cir. 1988); Citizens for a Better\n\nGretna v. City of Gretna, 834 F.2d 496, 503 (5th Cir. 1987).   For\n\nthis reason, courts usually focus on those elections involving\n\nblack or Hispanic candidates in examining whether black or Hispanic\n\nvoters enjoy an equal opportunity to elect representatives of their\n\nchoice. Where blacks and Hispanics are cohesive, we have held that\n\nthe relevant elections are those including either Hispanic or black\n\ncandidates. See, e.g., Baytown, 840 F.2d at 1245.       Defendants\n\ncontend that the district court erred in refusing to consider\n\nelections pitting Hispanic and white candidates in Harris and\n\n\n                                72\n\fTarrant Counties, counties in which plaintiffs proceed on behalf of\n\nblack voters only, but where the evidence indisputably showed that\n\nblacks and Hispanics were politically cohesive.                   In light of our\n\nprecedents, we must agree.\n\n     Blacks and Hispanics have joined forces for purposes of this\n\nsuit in Midland, Lubbock, and Ector Counties.               In these counties,\n\nwhite-Hispanic      elections     are     relevant     in        proving       legally\n\nsignificant white bloc voting, for the Hispanic candidate provides\n\nthe combined Hispanic-black minority with a viable minority choice.\n\nBut plaintiffs contend that where they represent only black voters,\n\nwhite-Hispanic elections in which the Hispanic candidate received\n\nthe support of black voters are irrelevant.                      A difference in\n\nlitigation strategy cannot support this distinction.                  Cohesion is\n\na fact, not a strategic card to be played at the caprice of a\n\nplaintiff. As we stated in Campos, \"if the statistical evidence is\n\nthat Blacks and Hispanics together vote for the Black or Hispanic\n\ncandidate,   then     cohesion    is    shown.\"      Id.    at    1245     (footnote\n\nomitted).    If blacks and Hispanics vote cohesively, they are\n\nlegally a single minority group, and elections with a candidate\n\nfrom this    single    minority    group     are   elections       with    a   viable\n\nminority candidate.\n\n     Plaintiffs next argue that there is evidence in the record\n\nthat blacks and Hispanics are not politically cohesive in Harris\n\nand Tarrant Counties.      They do not tell us to which evidence they\n\nrefer, and understandably so.           The record shows that blacks and\n\nHispanics were more cohesive in Harris and Tarrant Counties than in\n\n\n                                        73\n\fMidland and Ector Counties, counties in which plaintiffs represent\n\nboth blacks and Hispanics and the district court found cohesion.\n\n     In Harris County, Taebel studied 45 elections in which he\n\ndetermined the percentage of black and Hispanic votes cast for the\n\nminority/winning candidate. In 35 elections the black and Hispanic\n\nvote percentages varied by less than 10%.         Similarly, the levels of\n\nblack and Hispanic support for the same candidate were within ten\n\npercentage points in 13 of the 17 elections studied in Tarrant\n\nCounty.    In Midland County, by contrast, the black and Hispanic\n\nvoting percentages differed by less than 10% in only 4 of the 8\n\nelections analyzed; in Ector County, this close correlation between\n\nthe preferences of Hispanic and black voters was shown in just 2 of\n\n10 elections.    Under the present law of this circuit, there is no\n\nerror in the district court's findings of cohesion in Midland,\n\nEctor,    and   Lubbock   Counties,    because     in   those   counties   a\n\nsignificant number of blacks and Hispanics usually voted for the\n\nsame candidates.    Gingles, 478 U.S. at 56.        But this standard also\n\ncompels the conclusion that there is also black-Hispanic cohesion\n\nin Harris and Tarrant Counties.            The district court thus clearly\n\nerred in ignoring elections involving Hispanic and white candidates\n\nin these counties.29\n\n     29\n      The dissent points out that defendants did not ask the\ntrial court to make a specific finding that black and Hispanic\nvoters were politically cohesive in Harris and Tarrant Counties.\nThis observation, while correct, is beside the point, for that is\nnot the claim they raise on appeal. Rather, defendants argue\nthat the district court improperly refused to consider elections\ninvolving Hispanic candidates studied by Dr. Taebel, their\nexpert. This question is most assuredly before us and, given the\noverwhelming evidence of cohesiveness among black and Hispanic\n\n                                      74\n\f           B. Relevance of Small Number of Minority Lawyers\n\n     The     absence   of    minority   office   holders   is   typically   an\n\nimportant consideration in dilution cases. In this litigation, the\n\nsmall number of minority judges in the target counties has been the\n\ncornerstone of the plaintiffs' proof.\n\n     The office of district judge has more eligibility requirements\n\nthan the age and citizenship prerequisites of many public offices.\n\nA person must be a licensed attorney in the state of Texas for four\n\nyears, and a resident of the district for two years, before\n\nbecoming eligible for the post.         The need for district judges to be\n\nexperienced lawyers is obvious.\n\n     Undisputed evidence shows that in all of the counties, the\n\npercentage of minority lawyers was much smaller than the percentage\n\nof minority voters.         In fact, minority lawyers disproportionately\n\nserve as judges, when their percentage among all eligible lawyers\n\nis considered.      It is true that we have refused \"to preclude vote\n\ndilution claims where few or no [minority] candidates have sought\n\noffices in the challenged electoral system.\" Westwego Citizens for\n\nBetter Gov't v. City of Westwego, 872 F.2d 1201, 1208 n.9 (5th Cir.\n\n1989) (Westwego I).         That holding is a far cry from the conclusion\n\nthat the number of minority candidates eligible to run has no\n\nrelevance. Section 2 and the Senate Report instruct us to consider\n\nthe number of minority candidates elected to office.             At the same\n\ntime,   we    are   instructed     to    evaluate   the    totality   of    the\n\n\n\nvoters in Harris and Tarrant Counties, is susceptible to only one\nanswer.\n\n                                        75\n\fcircumstances with a \"'functional' view of the political process.\"\n\nGingles, 478 U.S. at 45, 106 S. Ct. at 2764.                           The cold reality is\n\nthat few minority citizens can run for and be elected to judicial\n\noffice.          A    functional       analysis      of    the    electoral      system   must\n\nrecognize the impact of limited pools of eligible candidates on the\n\nnumber      of       minority       judges   that    has    resulted.           See   Southern\n\nChristian Leadership Conf. of Ala. v. Evans, 785 F. Supp. 1469,\n\n1476-77 (M.D. Ala. 1992).\n\n         The record discloses that at times during the 1980's, the\n\npercentage of minority judges in five targeted counties exceeded\n\nthe percentage of minority lawyers who were eligible to run for\n\ndistrict judge.

In Ector County, for example, one\n\nsurvey found five eligible Hispanic lawyers and only one eligible\n\nblack lawyer.           Apparently none of Lubbock County's 499 lawyers in\n\n\n\n\n                                                76\n\f1989 was a black attorney eligible for a district judgeship,\n\nalthough the State Bar reported two black lawyers in the county.\n\n       The     absence    of   eligible      candidates   goes      a   long   way    in\n\nexplaining the absence of minority judges.                      Plaintiffs cannot\n\nemphasize the scarcity of successful minority candidates to support\n\nthe inference of dilution and simultaneously urge that the number\n\nof minorities eligible to run is not relevant.                      Plaintiffs argue\n\nthat this factor may not be considered because the limited number\n\nof    minority     lawyers      was    caused     by   state    discrimination        in\n\neducation.       We are not persuaded this argument merits exclusion of\n\nthe evidence.        The Voting Rights Act responds to practices that\n\nimpact voting; it is not a panacea addressing social deficiencies.\n\nSee Presley v. Etowah County Comm'n,                   U.S.     ,       , 112 S. Ct.\n\n820, 832 (1992).\n\n                               C. Past Discrimination\n\n       The     district    court      also    found    that    Texas'    history      of\n\ndiscrimination \"touched many aspects of the lives of minorities in\n\nthe    Counties      in    question       including     their       access     to    and\n\nparticipation in the democratic system governing this State and\n\ntheir socio-economic status.\"30               The district court, however, did\n\n       30\n            Two separate Zimmer factors guided the court's inquiry:\n\n       1. the extent of any history of official discrimination\n       in the state or political subdivision that touched the\n       right of the members of the minority group to register,\n       to vote, or otherwise to participate in the democratic\n       process;\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\n       5. the extent to which members of the minority group in\n\n                                             77\n\fnot   refer   to   specific   facts     in   the   record   to   support   this\n\nconclusion.        Instead,   the    court   cited    a   1980   Civil   Rights\n\nCommission Report describing civil rights developments in Texas\n\nduring the years 1968-1978 and a 1981 district court opinion\n\ndetailing race relations between minority and white residents of\n\none of Texas' smaller cities during the 1960's and 1970's.\n\n      Texas' long history of discrimination against its black and\n\nHispanic citizens in all areas of public life is not the subject of\n\ndispute among the parties.          Nor has anyone questioned plaintiffs'\n\nassertion that disparities between white and minority residents in\n\nseveral socioeconomic categories are the tragic legacies of the\n\nState's discriminatory practices.            Defendants do argue, however,\n\nthat these factors, by themselves, are insufficient to support the\n\ndistrict court's \"finding\" that minorities do not enjoy equal\n\naccess to the political process absent some indication that these\n\neffects of past discrimination actually hamper the ability of\n\nminorities to participate.          We again agree.\n\n      It would seem tautological that a factor directing courts to\n\ndetermine whether past discrimination hinders a minority group's\n\naccess to the political process would require a showing that the\n\ngroup does not in fact participate to the same extent as other\n\n\n\n      the state or political subdivision bear the effects of\n      discrimination in such areas as education, employment\n      and health, which hinder their ability to participate\n      effectively in the political process;\n\nS.

Nevertheless, prior to the amendments to § 2, this court\n\nheld that evidence of decreased participation among minorities was\n\nunnecessary on grounds that \"[i]nequality of access is an inference\n\nwhich    flows       from   the    existence         of    economic    and   educational\n\ninequalities.\"         Kirksey v. Board of Supervisors, 554 F.2d 139, 145\n\n(5th Cir. 1977) (en banc). This standard, however, was challenged\n\nby some of our later cases, see, e.g., McIntosh Cty. NAACP v. City\n\nof Darien, 605 F.2d 753, 759 (5th Cir. 1979), and was decisively\n\nrejected by Congress in 1982.                 As the Senate Report stated:\n\n       The courts have recognized that disproportionate\n       educational, employment, income level and living\n       conditions arising from past discrimination tend to\n       depress minority political participation. Where these\n       conditions are shown, and where the level of black\n       participation in politics is depressed, plaintiffs need\n       not prove any further causal nexus between their\n       disparate socio-economic status and the depressed level\n       of political participation.\n\nS. Rep. 417 at 29 n.114 (emphasis added), reprinted in 1982 U.S.\n\nCode    Cong.    &    Admin.      News   at    207    n.114.      As    this   statement\n\ndiscloses, the Senate Report, while not insisting upon a causal\n\nnexus between socioeconomic status and depressed participation,\n\nclearly did not dispense with proof that participation in the\n\npolitical process is in fact depressed among minority citizens. In\n\napparently holding that socioeconomic disparities and a history of\n\ndiscrimination, without more, sufficed to establish these Zimmer\n\nfactors, the district court employed the wrong legal standard.\n\n       Nor do we believe that the record before us can support such\n\na finding under the proper test.                          Plaintiffs have offered no\n\nevidence of reduced levels of black voter registration, lower\n\n\n                                              79\n\fturnout among black voters, or any other factor tending to show\n\nthat past discrimination has affected their ability to participate\n\nin the political process. While there are indications that Hispanic\n\ncitizens register to vote at a lower rate than white and black\n\ncitizens, this data provides support for such a finding in only\n\nBexar and Travis Counties, where plaintiffs proceed on behalf of\n\nHispanic voters only.\n\n      Plaintiffs contend that the district court could have relied\n\non the opinion offered by Dr. Brischetto, who, during his testimony\n\nregarding Bexar County, stated:\n\n      Well, certainly having less of these socioeconomic\n      resources or characteristics to draw on, we find that\n      minority voters will participate less in the electoral\n      system.    Education is an important resource.        For\n      example, it enables people to feel like they are more a\n      part of and take part in the election system to a greater\n      extent. Lacking that they participate less. So it is\n      important, it has an effect certainly on their\n      participation when they are subordinate status in the\n      stratification system.\n\nBrischetto's statement, as its tone suggests, was not so much a\n\nfinding as a prediction or hypothesis about what one might expect\n\nto   find   among   minorities   who    still   bore   the   scars   of   past\n\ndiscrimination.     It is for this reason that he could claim that his\n\ntestimony regarding the participation of Hispanics in Bexar applied\n\nwith equal force to all of the other counties.         In fact, the nature\n\nand basis of his opinion became explicit as the testimony shifted\n\nto these other locales.     In Travis County, for example, he stated\n\nonly that \"stratification . . . may very well also be an indication\n\nof the fact that Hispanics are less likely to participate fully and\n\neffectively in the electoral system in Travis County.\" In Lubbock,\n\n                                       80\n\fBrischetto stated only that \"I think [such stratification] is an\n\nindication that minorities are less equipped with those resources\n\nthat they need to participate fully in the political system.\"\n\nFinally, he   testified    in   the    context   of   Tarrant   County   that\n\nsocioeconomic differences \"indicate[] that minorities may have a\n\ndiminished ability to participate fully in the electoral system\n\nbecause of their lower status and stratification that exists in\n\nthat community.\"\n\n     Brischetto's testimony thus provides support for the common\n\nsense proposition that depressed political participation typically\n\naccompanies poverty and a lack of education; it certainly does not\n\namount to proof that minority voters in this case failed to\n\nparticipate equally in the political processes. A district court's\n\nfindings under § 2 must rest on an \"intensely local appraisal\" of\n\nthe social and political climate of the cities and counties in\n\nwhich such suits are brought, White, 412 U.S. at 769, not the sort\n\nof generalized armchair speculation supplied by Dr. Brischetto. We\n\nneed evidence, not musings.\n\n     Plaintiffs    also   contend     that   minority   citizens'   lack   of\n\nfinancial resources makes it very difficult for minority-preferred\n\ncandidates to secure funds sufficient to run creditable county-wide\n\ncampaigns.    Here again, the inference plaintiffs ask us to draw\n\nmight well be true in most cases; regardless of its general\n\nvalidity, however, it is no substitute for proof that a minority\n\ngroup's poverty has had the predicted effect in this particular\n\ncase.   The evidence presented at trial simply does not show that\n\n\n                                      81\n\fpast discrimination has inhibited the ability of minorities to\n\nparticipate in the process.       In fact, the record discloses that\n\nminority-preferred candidates frequently raised and spent more\n\nmoney that their white opponents.\n\n     Witnesses   Coronado   and    Fitch   did    testify    that    minority\n\ncandidates generally were unable to raise the money necessary to\n\nrun county-wide. When asked about the only district court campaign\n\nin which he was personally involved, however, Coronado made no\n\nmention of money problems.        In fact, he testified that \"[Judge\n\nGallardo] ran a very good campaign.        I mean he was, he understood\n\nthe media, had people out working boxes, he had a lot of attorneys\n\nof all ethnic groups working in his campaign, a broad base campaign\n\nin the community.\" Similarly, Fitch asserted that black incumbents\n\nhad difficulty raising funds, but she attributed this difficulty to\n\n\"racial discrimination\" and black candidates' \"past record of\n\nlosing.\"\n\n     In contrast with the highly equivocal testimony of Fitch and\n\nCoronado   concerning   their   impressions      of   the   barriers   facing\n\nminority candidates, nearly all such candidates who appeared at\n\ntrial reported that they had outspent their white opponents, often\n\nby a very large amount.     In Midland County, for example, Watson\n\ntestified that she outspent her white opponent in the general\n\nelection for Justice of the Peace by a factor of six.               In Dallas\n\nCounty, Joan Winn White, Tinsley, H. Ron White, and Oliver all\n\ntestified that they had run extensive, well-financed campaigns. In\n\nparticular, Oliver stated that he spent $300,000 in a losing\n\n\n                                   82\n\feffort.     The same was true of minority-preferred candidates in\n\nHarris County.     Lee testified that she outspent her white opponent\n\nat a rate approaching twelve to one; Berry stated that the ratio in\n\nhis campaign for district court was even greater.                Finally, Leal\n\ntestified that he raised $85,000 to $90,000 to his opponent's\n\n$1,000.    A district court's findings may only rest on the evidence\n\npresented at trial. The record before us does not remotely suggest\n\nthat the visible scars of discrimination have left minority-\n\npreferred    candidates      and     their   supporters    within     minority\n\ncommunities without the funds needed to launch broad-based, county-\n\nwide campaigns.     In fact, the available evidence shows just the\n\nopposite.    For this reason, we must conclude that plaintiffs have\n\nnot established that the effects of past discrimination have\n\nhindered their ability to participate in the political process.\n\n                       V.    Texas' Linkage Interest\n\n     This case involves 172 judicial districts that coincide with\n\nnine Texas counties. Given the State of Texas' county-based system\n\nof venue, this venerable structure links the jurisdictional and\n\nelectoral bases of the district courts. In doing so, the structure\n\nadvances     the    state's        substantial    interest       in   judicial\n\neffectiveness.     Trial judges are elected by a broad range of local\n\ncitizens, rather than by a narrow constituency.              This electoral\n\nscheme balances accountability and judicial independence.\n\n     As    explained    in   detail    below,    the   state's    interest   in\n\nmaintaining the structure of this single-member judicial office\n\nmust be weighed in the totality of circumstances to determine\n\n\n                                       83\n\fwhether a § 2 violation exists.          The weight of a substantial state\n\ninterest, determined as a matter of law, is balanced against\n\nlocalized evidence of racial vote dilution. This substantial state\n\ninterest may be overcome only by evidence that sums to substantial\n\nproof of racial dilution.         Otherwise, the at-large election of\n\ndistrict court judges does not violate § 2.\n\n              A. The Structure of Texas District Courts\n\n     The district courts are the primary trial courts in Texas.\n\nDistrict judges were first elected in 1850, five years after\n\nstatehood, and every state constitution since 1861 has provided for\n\ntheir election by county residents.             All voters of the entire\n\ncounty    elect   all   the   district    judges   of   their   county.   The\n\npolitical boundaries of each county are the boundaries of the\n\njurisdiction and election base in all of the challenged counties.31\n\nMany counties in Texas have more than one district judge.            Even so,\n\ntrials are presided over by district judges acting alone. The only\n\ncollegial decision-making by district judges in counties with more\n\nthan one district judge is in the handling of some administrative\n\nmatters.    In some of the counties involved here, district courts\n\nare designated to specialize in civil, criminal, or family law\n\ncases.\n\n     The electoral bases of district judges are linked to the area\n\nover which they exercise primary jurisdiction.             This linkage has\n\nbeen in place throughout the 143 year history of judicial elections\n\n\n     31\n      One exception is the 72nd District, which encompasses both\nLubbock and Crosby Counties.\n\n                                     84\n\fin Texas.    By making coterminous the electoral and jurisdictional\n\nbases of trial courts, Texas advances the effectiveness of its\n\ncourts by balancing the virtues of accountability with the need for\n\nindependence.       The     state    attempts       to     maintain    the    fact   and\n\nappearance of judicial fairness that are central to the judicial\n\ntask, in part, by insuring that judges remain accountable to the\n\nrange of people within their jurisdiction. A broad base diminishes\n\nthe   semblance    of     bias    and    favoritism        towards     the   parochial\n\ninterests of a narrow constituency.                      Appearances are critical,\n\nbecause    \"the    very     perception        of    impropriety       and    unfairness\n\nundermines the moral authority of the courts.\"                  John L. Hill, Jr.,\n\nTaking Texas Judges Out of Politics:                       An Argument for Merit\n\nElection, 40 Baylor L. Rev. 339, 364 (1988).                    The fear of mixing\n\nward politics and state trial courts of general jurisdiction is\n\nwidely held.       It is not surprising then that states that elect\n\ntrial judges overwhelmingly share this structure and electoral\n\nscheme.      See    infra     note      30.        The    systemic    incentives      of\n\nsubdistricting are those of ward politics, and would \"diminish the\n\nappearance if not fact of its judicial independence--a core element\n\nof a judicial office.\"           LULAC II, 914 F.2d at 650 (Higginbotham,\n\nJ., concurring).\n\n                    B. The Role of Function Under § 2\n\n       In Houston Lawyers' Association v. Attorney General,                          U.S.\n\n      , 111 S.Ct. 2376 (1991), the Supreme Court agreed that the\n\ninterests behind the existing court structure must be considered.\n\n       [W]e believe that the State's interest in maintaining an\n       electoral system--in this case, Texas' interest in\n\n                                          85\n\f     maintaining the link between a district judge's\n     jurisdiction and the area of residency of his or her\n     voters--is a legitimate factor to be considered by courts\n     among the \"totality of circumstances\" in determining\n     whether a § 2 violation has occurred.          A State's\n     justification for its electoral system is a proper factor\n     for the courts to assess in a racial vote dilution\n     inquiry . . . .       Because the State's interest in\n     maintaining an at-large, district-wide electoral scheme\n     for single-member offices is merely one factor to be\n     considered in evaluating the \"totality of circumstances,\"\n     that interest does not automatically, and in every case,\n     outweigh proof of racial vote dilution.\n\nId. at     , 111 S. Ct. at 2381.\n\n     Justice   Stevens   noted   that   Texas'   interest    in    linking\n\nelectoral and jurisdictional bases is \"a legitimate factor to be\n\nconsidered by courts among the 'totality of circumstances' in\n\ndetermining whether a § 2 violation has occurred.\"      Id.       The Court\n\nwas not persuaded that this \"linkage\" interest should defeat\n\nliability \"automatically, and in every case.\"         Rather, Houston\n\nLawyers' held that the interest must be weighed against other\n\nrelevant factors to ascertain whether the interest \"outweigh[s]\n\nproof of racial vote dilution.\"     Id.   See also Nipper v. Chiles,\n\n795 F. Supp. 1525, 1548 (M.D. Fla. 1992) (holding that \"a state's\n\ninterest in maintaining an electoral system is a legitimate factor\n\nto be considered ... in the liability phase of a section two\n\ncase\").\n\n     An examination of Houston Lawyers' further illuminates why the\n\nstate interests behind an office's structure and function must be\n\nweighed.   The Court held that single-member office elections are\n\nwithin the scope of § 2.   Houston Lawyers',       U.S. at         , 111 S.\n\nCt. at 2380.    This holding reached beyond judicial elections.\n\n\n                                  86\n\f\"[T]he coverage of the Act encompasses the election of executive\n\nofficers and trial judges whose responsibilities are exercised\n\nindependently in an area coextensive with the districts from which\n\nthey are elected.\"      Id. (emphasis added).        It appears from this\n\nlanguage that an office such as mayor or sheriff is subject to § 2\n\nscrutiny, requiring an analysis of the totality of circumstances to\n\ndetermine    whether   illegal   vote    dilution   exists.    While   that\n\nanalysis is not precluded, it must take into account the state\n\ninterests that are furthered by the structure and function of such\n\nsingle-member offices.     Surely by enacting the Voting Rights Act,\n\nCongress did not contemplate that the office of mayor in a city\n\nwould have to be dismantled because its single-member office nature\n\nsubmerged minority voters in the community of voters as a whole,\n\nwithout regard for the interests in preserving that office.             Cf.\n\nButts v. City of New York, 779 F.2d 141 (2d Cir. 1985) (holding\n\nthat primary runoffs for single-member offices of mayor, city\n\ncouncil president, and city comptroller do not violate § 2).\n\n     Therefore, while the Supreme Court rejected the contention\n\nthat the linkage interest in all cases defeated liability under\n\n§ 2, the Court endorsed the position that the linkage interest is\n\nrelevant to a determination of liability.           Indeed, by noting that\n\nthe linkage interest does not \"automatically, and in every case,\n\noutweigh proof of racial vote dilution,\" the Court held that the\n\nstate interest could outweigh what would otherwise be proof of\n\nillegal dilution and thus foreclose liability.          As one commentator\n\nhas noted:\n\n\n                                    87\n\f       the Court recognized that in balancing the many factors\n       in the totality of the circumstances test, the state\n       interest in district wide judicial elections may, in some\n       cases, outweigh proof of racial voter dilution.\n\nMary T. Wickham, Note, Mapping the Morass:            Application of Section\n\n2 of the Voting Rights Act to Judicial Elections, 33 Wm. & Mary L.\n\nRev. 1251, 1285 (1992).\n\n       The issue we face is determining when the linkage interest\n\nwill outweigh other factors and defeat liability under § 2.                   In\n\nresolving this issue, we reject the polar extremes of the parties.\n\nThe State of Texas maintains that the linkage interest must defeat\n\nliability in every case, regardless of the other circumstances in\n\nthe totality.       The Supreme Court rejected this position when it\n\nheld that the linkage interest does not \"automatically, and in\n\nevery case, outweigh proof of racial vote dilution.\"                   Houston\n\nLawyers',          U.S. at      , 111 S. Ct. at 2381.\n\n       We also reject the position of plaintiffs that the linkage\n\ninterest     can    never    defeat   liability     under   the   totality    of\n\ncircumstances if \"illegal\" dilution is otherwise established.                The\n\nplaintiffs maintain that only the absence of a compelling state\n\ninterest in an electoral scheme is relevant to liability, and that\n\nsuch an absence \"is an optional factor\" that plaintiffs can use to\n\nsupport a finding of illegal dilution. They contend, however, that\n\nthe existence of a compelling interest can never defeat liability\n\nthat    is   otherwise       established    under    the    totality   of    the\n\ncircumstances.      This position is foreclosed by the Supreme Court,\n\nwhich directed that this state interest is to be weighed as part of\n\nthe totality of the circumstances.           Id.\n\n                                       88\n\f     Citing Jones v. City of Lubbock, 727 F.2d 364, 383 (5th Cir.\n\n1984), and United States v. Marengo County Comm'n, 731 F.2d 1546,\n\n1571 (11th Cir. 1984), plaintiffs urge that the Zimmer factor of a\n\nnon-tenuous state policy is among the least important of the\n\nfactors for determining dilution.          These decisions state only that\n\ndefendants cannot defeat liability by using the non-tenuous policy\n\njustification of an electoral scheme to prove that scheme \"does not\n\nhave a discriminatory intent.\"        Marengo County, 731 F.2d at 1571.\n\nSee also Terrazas v. Clements, 581 F. Supp. 1319, 1345 n.24 (N.D.\n\nTex. 1983) (three-judge panel) (\"In the case of tenuousness, the\n\nlesser weight is consistent with the change in emphasis from intent\n\nto results.      The principal probative weight of a tenuous state\n\npolicy is its propensity to show pretext.\").\n\n     The plaintiffs' argument misses the point. The State of Texas\n\nhas done more than assert that its interest in this electoral\n\nscheme     is   not   tenuous--that        is,     not   a    pretext   masking\n\ndiscriminatory intent in the adoption or maintenance of the scheme.\n\nThe interest in linking electoral to jurisdictional base takes on\n\nadditional and distinct relevance because it advances objectively\n\nsubstantive     goals.   The   inquiry      into    whether    an   interest   is\n\nsubstantial goes beyond inquiring whether the interest is non-\n\ntenuous.    A substantial state interest must be more than racially-\n\nneutral.    Thus, the linkage interest is not examined just because\n\nit proves that the state's practice is premised on a racially-\n\nneutral policy and is consistently applied.              Cf. S. Rep. 417 at 29\n\n\n\n\n                                      89\n\fn.117, reprinted in 1982 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News at 207\n\nn.117.\n\n     Proof of a merely non-tenuous state interest discounts one\n\nZimmer factor, but cannot defeat liability.              It does not follow,\n\nhowever, that proof of a substantial state interest cannot defeat\n\nliability. The totality of circumstances inquiry that occurs after\n\na showing of the Gingles prerequisites is not limited to factors\n\nlisted in     the   legislative    history    of   the   Voting   Rights   Act.\n\nGingles, 478 U.S. at 45, 106 S. Ct. at 2763; Westwego Citizens for\n\nBetter Gov't v. City of Westwego, 946 F.2d 1109, 1120 (5th Cir.\n\n1991) (Westwego III).      The weight, as well as tenuousness, of the\n\nstate's interest is a legitimate factor in analyzing the totality\n\nof circumstances.      As we have explained, the Voting Rights Act\n\nlargely codifies Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence embodied in\n\nWhite v. Regester, 412 U.S. 755, 93 S. Ct. 2332, 37 L. Ed. 2d 314\n\n(1973).   See Jones, 727 F.2d at 379-80.           The substantiality of the\n\nstate's interest has long been the centerpiece of the inquiry into\n\nthe interpretation of the Civil War Amendments and their interplay\n\nwith the civil rights statutes.\n\n     Having    rejected   the     proffered   extremes--that      the   linkage\n\ninterest either always or never defeats § 2 liability--we turn to\n\nwhen the linkage interest precludes a § 2 violation. This question\n\ndepends upon the weight of the interest.\n\n          C. Weight of State's Interest Is Matter of Law\n\n     The plaintiffs urge that the weight or substantiality of\n\nTexas' linkage interest is an issue of fact for the district court\n\n\n                                      90\n\fto decide in the first instance, reviewable only for clear error.\n\nWe disagree.       Deciding whether the adoption or maintenance of a\n\nsystem is    a     pretext   for    racial    discrimination   may   present   a\n\nquestion of fact.32 This question can turn on credibility, an issue\n\nbest determined by a fact finder.              The issue of substantiality,\n\nhowever,    is    distinct   from    the     conventional   Zimmer   factor    of\n\ntenuousness and is a legal determination.\n\n     The Supreme Court has held that the finding of dilution is a\n\nfactual matter reviewable only for clear error.             Gingles, 478 U.S.\n\nat 78, 106 S. Ct. at 2780-81.          A substantial state interest is not\n\ninherently preclusive of dilution and is not raised to disprove the\n\nexistence of dilution.         Rather, the state's interest is weighed\n\nagainst proven dilution to assess whether such dilution creates § 2\n\nliability.       Houston Lawyers',           U.S. at    , 111 S. Ct. at 2381\n\n(weighing of linkage interest on remand goes to determination of\n\nwhether interests \"outweigh proof of racial vote dilution\").\n\n     Determining the substantiality of Texas' linkage interest\n\nunder the Voting Rights Act, a statute enacted to enforce the\n\nguarantees of the Civil War Amendments, is analogous to weighing\n\nthe asserted state interest in constitutional law contexts.               With\n\nissues of substantive due process, equal protection, and the First\n\nAmendment, the weight of a state's interest has always been a legal\n\nquestion, not a factual one.           For example, in Posadas de Puerto\n\n\n     32\n      We do not decide this issue. Some appellate court\ndecisions appear to have reviewed the tenuousness of state\ninterests without deference to the underlying district court\ndeterminations. See, e.g., Zimmer, 485 F.2d at 1307.\n\n                                        91\n\fRico Ass'n v. Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico, 478 U.S. 328, 341, 106 S.\n\nCt. 2968, 2977, 92 L. Ed. 2d 266 (1986), the Court had \"no\n\ndifficulty      in   concluding     that     the   Puerto    Rico    Legislature's\n\ninterests in the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens\n\nconstitutes a 'substantial' governmental interest.\"                    In reaching\n\nthis conclusion, the Court itself determined the weight of the\n\nstate interest.        See also City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living\n\nCenter, 473 U.S. 432, 105 S. Ct. 3249 (1985) (weighing state's\n\ninterest de novo).          We hold that the substantiality of Texas'\n\ninterest under § 2 is a question of law for this court to determine\n\nde novo and not a question of fact that somehow will be described\n\non a county-by-county basis.\n\n          D. Determining the Weight of the Linkage Interest\n\n     The weight of Texas' interest is virtually assigned by a\n\nSupreme Court decision handed down on the same day as Houston\n\nLawyers'.    In Gregory v. Ashcroft,                U.S.      , 111 S. Ct. 2395,\n\n2404, 115 L. Ed. 2d 410 (1991), the Supreme Court held that the Age\n\nDiscrimination in Employment Act does not apply to judicial offices\n\nin Missouri. The plaintiffs had used ADEA to challenge a mandatory\n\nretirement age for state judges.                   The Court noted that \"the\n\nauthority    of      the   people      of    the   States    to     determine    the\n\nqualifications of their most important government officials . . .\n\nlies at the heart of representative government.\"                  Id. at        , 111\n\nS. Ct. at 2402 (internal quotation omitted).                  Gregory noted that\n\n\"the States' power to define the qualifications of their office-\n\nholders   has     force    even   as    against    the     proscriptions   of    the\n\n\n                                            92\n\fFourteenth Amendment.\"     Id. at     , 111 S. Ct. at 2405.    To protect\n\nthis power to define the judicial office, Gregory required a clear\n\nstatement from Congress for an override of qualifications imposed\n\nby the State for important state government office.

Ct.\n\nat 2407.   If that interest is compelling, the people of Texas have\n\nat least a substantial interest in defining the structure and\n\nqualifications of their judiciary. Indeed, Texas' Attorney General\n\nhas submitted to this court that linkage is a \"fundamental right\"\n\nthat \"serves [a] compelling interest\" of the State of Texas.\n\nLinking electoral and jurisdictional bases is a key component of\n\nthe effort to define the office of district judge.            That Texas'\n\ninterest in the linkage of electoral and jurisdictional bases is\n\nsubstantial cannot then be gainsaid.\n\n     Our   confidence    in   this   conclusion   is   bolstered   by   the\n\nrecognition and pursuit of the linkage interest in other states.\n\nCourts have recognized the legitimacy and substance of similar\n\nlinkage interests in Florida and Alabama.         See Nipper v. Chiles,\n\n795 F. Supp. 1525, 1548 (M.D. Fla. 1992); Southern Christian\n\nLeadership Conf. of Ala. v. Evans, 785 F. Supp. 1469, 1478 (M.D.\n\nAla. 1992).   Of the twenty-nine states that elect their principal\n\n\n                                     93\n\ftrial court judges, including Texas, Alabama, and Florida, twenty-\n\nfive        employ    district-wide       elections.33         The   overwhelming\n\npreservation of linkage in states that elect their trial court\n\njudges demonstrates that district-wide elections are integral to\n\nthe judicial office and not simply another electoral alternative.\n\n       The     decision     to    make    jurisdiction   and    electoral   bases\n\ncoterminous is more than a decision about how to elect state\n\njudges.       It is a decision of what constitutes a state court judge.\n\nSuch a decision is as much a decision about the structure of the\n\njudicial office as the office's explicit qualifications such as bar\n\nmembership       or   the   age    of    judges.   The   collective     voice   of\n\ngenerations by their unswerving adherence to the principle of\n\nlinkage through times of extraordinary growth and change speaks to\n\nus with power.        Tradition, of course, does not make right of wrong,\n\nbut we must be cautious when asked to embrace a new revelation that\n\nright has so long been wrong.              There is no evidence that linkage\n\n\n       33\n      The twenty-five are Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida,\nGeorgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana,\nNevada, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma,\nOregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington,\nWest Virginia, and Wisconsin. Among these states, some appoint a\nportion of their trial judges, while others hold retention\nelections after initial selection by contested election. See\ngenerally 28 The Council of State Governments, The Book of the\nStates 210-12 (1990) (table 4.4).\n     Mississippi and Louisiana only recently abandoned the link\nbetween jurisdiction and electoral base in order to settle\nprolonged litigation.\n     North Carolina allows every elector within a district\ncourt's jurisdiction to vote for its judge by holding statewide\nelections after district-wide primaries. See Republican Party of\nN. C. v. Martin, 980 F.2d 943, 947 (4th Cir. 1992) (holding that\nFourteenth Amendment challenge to system by Republican Party is\njusticiable).\n\n                                           94\n\fwas created and consistently maintained to stifle minority votes.\n\nTradition speaks to us about its defining role--imparting its deep\n\nrunning sense that this is what judging is about.\n\n      On the other hand, plaintiffs' interests are not well-served\n\nby destroying linkage.           The inescapable truth is that the result\n\nsought   by    plaintiffs      here    would    diminish      minority   influence.\n\nMinority voters would be marginalized, having virtually no impact\n\non most district court elections.               Given that district judges act\n\nalone in exercising their power, that use of the Voting Rights Act\n\nis perverse.      After subdistricting, a handful of judges would be\n\nelected from subdistricts with a majority of minority voters.\n\nCreating \"safe\" districts would leave all but a few subdistricts\n\nstripped of nearly all minority members.                  The great majority of\n\njudges would      be     elected   entirely      by   white    voters.      Minority\n\nlitigants would not necessarily have their cases assigned to one of\n\nthe   few     judges     elected      by   minority     voters.       Rather,      the\n\noverwhelming probability would be that the minority litigant would\n\nappear \"before a judge who has little direct political interest in\n\nbeing responsive to minority concerns.\"                LULAC II, 914 F.2d at 650\n\n(Higginbotham,         J.,     concurring).           Under    the    totality     of\n\ncircumstances, we must recognize that breaking the link between the\n\nelectoral base and the jurisdiction of this single-member office\n\nwould perversely lessen minority influence on the conduct of most\n\nlitigation.\n\n      The     distrust    of    judicial    subdistricts       does   not   rest   on\n\npaternalism.       It recognizes Texas' historic interest in having\n\n\n                                           95\n\fdistrict judges remain accountable to all voters in their district.\n\nRegardless of the race or residency of particular litigants, judges\n\nmake choices that affect all county residents.               Texas has insisted\n\nthat trial judges answer to all county voters at the ballot box.\n\nUnlike legislators or even appellate judges, who make decisions in\n\ngroups, each district judge holds a single-member office and acts\n\nalone.    When collegial bodies are involved, all citizens continue\n\nto elect at least one person involved in making a particular\n\ndecision. While subdistricting for multimember offices can enhance\n\nminority influence         because     members   from   minority     subdistricts\n\nparticipate in and influence all of the decisions of the larger\n\nbody, subdistricting for single-member district court judgeships\n\nwould leave minority voters with no electoral influence over the\n\nmajority of judges in each county.            Subdistricting would partially\n\ndisenfranchise citizens to whom all district judges in a county are\n\nnow accountable.\n\n     By   contrast,        under   the   present     regime,      minority   voters\n\nparticipate    in    all    judicial     elections    in   each    county.     This\n\nparticipation gives minority voters the opportunity to influence\n\nall elections, absent significant racial vote dilution. As Justice\n\nO'Connor noted in her concurring opinion in Gingles, voters can\n\nwield influence over elections even when those votes are cast for\n\nlosing candidates.         Gingles, 478 U.S. at 98-99, 106 S. Ct. at 2791\n\n(O'Connor, J., concurring).          Denying importance to this ability to\n\ninfluence asks that all measures of success be found in the win-\n\nloss column.        This mandates proportional representation as the\n\n\n                                         96\n\fmeasure of dilution, contrary to the explicit terms of § 2.\n\nIndisputably, subdistricting would assure the absence of minority\n\ninfluence over the judicial process.           See LULAC II, 914 F.2d at\n\n649-50    (Higginbotham,         J.,   concurring);    Southern        Christian\n\nLeadership Conf. of Ala. v. Evans, 785 F. Supp. 1469, 1478 (M.D.\n\nAla. 1992) (Hobbs, J.) (by subdistricting judicial positions,\n\n\"black voters ... will ... be sacrificing [an] extremely valuable\n\npolitical right--the right to vote for all of the judges who will\n\nbe serving as judges in the circuit wherein they live\").\n\n     Plaintiffs contend that linking jurisdictional and electoral\n\nbases does not, in fact, protect these uniquely judicial interests.\n\nAll of the plaintiffs' arguments reduce to the single contention\n\nthat Texas does not consistently apply the policy of linking\n\njurisdictional and electoral bases.\n\n     Before addressing these arguments, we note that in assessing\n\nthe relationship between the end pursued and the means employed,\n\n\"our scrutiny will not be so demanding where we deal with matters\n\nresting firmly      within   a    State's   constitutional   prerogatives.\"\n\nSugarman v. Dougall, 413 U.S. 634, 648, 93 S. Ct. 2842, 2850, 37 L.\n\nEd. 2d 853 (1973).     As both Sugarman and Gregory make clear, such\n\nmatters   include    \"the    establishment    and   operation     of    its   own\n\ngovernment, as well as the qualifications of an appropriately\n\ndesignated class of public office holders.\"           Sugarman, 413 U.S. at\n\n648, 93 S. Ct. at 2851.       Examining Texas' linking of electoral and\n\njurisdictional bases in light of these considerations, we find that\n\nit serves the substantial interests we described.\n\n\n                                       97\n\f     The   plaintiffs    contend      that    Texas   district     judges    often\n\nadjudicate controversies involving litigants who are not residents\n\nof the county.      Defendants make several responses.              First, they\n\nmaintain   that     because    a     district    judge's    area    of   primary\n\njurisdiction   is    defined    by    county-specific      venue    rules,    most\n\nresidents of a county will have their disputes adjudicated by\n\njudges they elect.      Second, the residency of particular litigants\n\nis not that important.        Regardless of the identity of litigants in\n\na case, a district judge may make decisions or grant relief that\n\nimpact primarily upon the residents of the district.\n\n     By drawing attention to venue, plaintiffs only remind us of\n\nconcerns unique to the district judge's office.                     Venue rules\n\npreserve   judicial     fairness      by     preventing    forum-shopping      and\n\ndiminishing the chances of biased adjudication.              At the same time,\n\nthe rules keep most local matters in local courts, where local\n\njuries are drawn and judges are accountable to voters for the legal\n\nand policy choices they make.34            The localized focus of district\n\ncourts is particularly evident in criminal matters, where venue is\n\nbased on events related to the offense.           Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann.\n\nch. 13 (Vernon 1977).          Domicile and hence convenience to the\n\n\n     34\n      Texas venue law, as amended in 1983, has been influenced\nby both Spanish and English principles. Besides protecting civil\ndefendants from inconvenient forums, the rules strive to ensure\nthat local matters are tried in local courts. See generally\nJoseph W. McKnight, The Spanish Influence on the Texas Law of\nCivil Procedure, 38 Texas L. Rev. 24, 36-40 (1959); Charles T.\nFrazier, Jr., Note, Venue Procedure in Texas: An Analysis of the\n1983 Amendments to the Rules of Civil Procedure Governing Venue\nPractice Under the New Venue Statute, 36 Baylor L. Rev. 241, 241-\n44 (1984).\n\n                                        98\n\fdefendant have never been a consideration.                 Since the propriety of\n\nvenue    goes    to    the     authority    of    the     court,   it   is    \"quasi-\n\njurisdictional        in     nature.\"      George    E.    Dix,    Texas     Charging\n\nInstrument Law:        The 1985 Revisions and the Continuing Need for\n\nReform, 38 Baylor L. Rev. 1, 71 (1986).                 Thus, Texas law commonly\n\nrefers to the district court's venue reach as its jurisdiction in\n\ncriminal matters.          See, e.g., Hodge v. State, 527 S.W.2d 289, 292\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1975); Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. Arts. 21.02(5),\n\n21.21(5) (Vernon 1989).\n\n     Similarly, family law matters will almost always be handled by\n\nthe local district court.          See, e.g., Tex. Fam. Code Ann. §§ 3.21,\n\n11.04 (Vernon 1986) (concerning venue in divorce and parent-child\n\nrelationship suits).          Quintessentially local matters such as suits\n\nagainst counties or disputes involving title to real property must\n\nbe tried in the district court of the same county.                  Tex. Civ. Prac.\n\n& Rem. Code §§ 15.001, 15.015 (Vernon 1986).                 Whatever the area of\n\npractice--whether civil, criminal, or family law--the conclusion\n\nreached in the concurring opinion in LULAC II remains valid.\n\n\"[T]he   state    recognized       that    elimination       of    [the]     risk   and\n\nappearance of bias was essential to the office it was creating by\n\nan elaborate set of rules controlling venue.\"                      914 F.2d at 651\n\n(Higginbotham, J., concurring).                 The argument that Texas' venue\n\nrules somehow abrogate its interest in linking jurisdiction and\n\nelectoral bases is illusory.\n\n     Plaintiffs also challenge the legitimacy of the state interest\n\nin linkage by pointing to the use of visiting judges in the\n\n\n                                           99\n\fdistrict courts.      Judges not elected by a district's residents--\n\ne.g., judges from another district or retired judges--may be\n\ntemporarily assigned to a district court, when necessary to dispose\n\nof its accumulated business, by the Chief Justice or regional\n\npresiding judge.      Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 74.052 (Vernon 1988).35\n\nA typical occasion for such assignments is when the district judge\n\nis vacationing or ill.       Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that this\n\nmeasure of expedience represents an abandonment of the interests\n\nbehind linkage.      To the contrary, insofar as linkage involves the\n\nappearance of judicial fairness and independence, visiting judges\n\nare not inconsistent with its purposes.          Because visiting judges\n\nwill not stand for reelection, they do not create the impression of\n\nbias that may accompany a judge elected from a narrow constituency.\n\n     Another challenge to the legitimacy of the linkage interest is\n\nbased upon Article 5, § 7a of the Texas Constitution.           Plaintiffs\n\nreason that Texas abandoned its linkage interest by allowing the\n\nresidents of counties to \"opt out\" of the linkage structure by\n\nselecting   judges    from   regions   smaller   than   a   county.   This\n\ncontention is without merit.       As Chief Justice Phillips explained\n\nat trial, § 7a was enacted in 1985 as part of a constitutional and\n\nstatutory scheme designed to equalize court dockets by allowing the\n\nrealignment of judicial districts.         The provision states that a\n\ndistrict smaller than a county may not be created unless approved\n\nby a majority of county voters.        Tex. Const. Art. 5, § 7a(i).    The\n\n     35\n      A visiting judge may not, however, hear a civil case over\nthe objection of a party. Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 74.053 (Vernon\nSupp. 1993).\n\n                                    100\n\fpeople    of    Texas   have   jealously    reserved     to     themselves,   as\n\nindividual voters, the power to subdivide districts that have\n\nalways been the size of a county, or larger.            Nowhere in Texas' 254\n\ncounties       have   residents   voted    to   break     the    link   between\n\njurisdiction      and   electoral   base.       If   anything,      §   7a(i)'s\n\nunemployment testifies to affirmation, not abrogation, of the\n\ninterest in linkage.\n\n     Moreover, even if one county were to subdivide, the interest\n\nin linkage would not be lost in the state as a whole.               In Mahan v.\n\nHowell, 410 U.S. 315, 93 S. Ct. 979, 35 L. Ed. 2d 320, modified 411\n\nU.S. 922, 93 S. Ct. 1475, 36 L. Ed. 2d 316 (1973), the Supreme\n\nCourt recognized that although Virginia divided one county when\n\nreapportioning its state legislature, it retained its interest in\n\npreserving boundaries of all other political subdivisions.               Id. at\n\n327, 93 S. Ct. at 986.      Texas' interest in preserving the structure\n\nof its judiciary by linking jurisdictional and electoral boundaries\n\nis greater than a state's interest in observing boundaries in\n\nlegislative reapportionment, because it serves substantive purposes\n\nother than convenience.\n\n     Finally, plaintiffs note that some rural district judges, and\n\nurban justices of the peace, are elected by a small number of\n\nvoters.    Therefore, plaintiffs contend, judges elected by narrow\n\nconstituencies are not antithetical to the state's interest in\n\njudicial independence. The structure of the justice courts have no\n\nbearing on Texas' interests in maintaining its system of district\n\ncourts.    Justices of the peace need not be lawyers, and preside\n\n\n                                     101\n\fover courts whose subject matter jurisdiction is limited to less\n\nsignificant disputes.        For instance, the justice court's criminal\n\njurisdiction is limited to finable misdemeanors.           Significantly,\n\nthe justice of the peace \"is powerless to issue injunctions.\"\n\nBowles v. Angelo, 188 S.W.2d 691, 693 (Tex. Civ. App.--Galveston\n\n1945, no writ).     The justice court is not a court of record, so\n\nwhen its rulings are appealed, the cases are tried de novo before\n\na county court judge--a judge chosen by district-wide election.\n\nIn great contrast, district courts are Texas' trial courts of\n\ngeneral jurisdiction, charged with trying felony cases and civil\n\nmatters of unlimited amounts in controversy.           As to rural Texas,\n\nlinkage    is   preserved,    while   providing   as   broad   a    range   of\n\nconstituents as the countervailing problems of courthouse proximity\n\nallow.\n\n          E. Other Means to Accommodate the Linkage Interest\n\n     Plaintiffs urge that the linkage interest can be accommodated\n\neven if the existing scheme were found to be illegal.              They offer\n\ntwo alternatives: either a complete overhaul of the existing venue\n\nscheme or the use of unconventional electoral methods that preserve\n\nat-large voting.     The plaintiffs suggest that a scheme of single-\n\nmember districts may preserve linkage, by making each district\n\njudge's area of primary jurisdiction co-extensive with the single-\n\nmember district from which the judge is elected.                   Plaintiffs\n\nprovide no evidence that such a radical reworking of the venue of\n\nTexas courts would be administratively feasible.               The district\n\ncourt likewise simply asserted that such an arrangement of venue\n\n\n                                      102\n\flimited   to   a    single-member     district     could   accommodate       Texas'\n\ninterests,     without   a   glance    at    the   feasibility     of       such   an\n\narrangement.       One look at Harris County cut into a grid of dozens\n\nof venue blocks is enough to show the bizarre nature of this\n\nproposal.\n\n     We cannot conclude that Texas' interests could be adequately\n\naccommodated by such a radical reworking of Texas' venue rules.\n\nThe proposal illustrates how different the judicial offices' at-\n\nlarge election scheme is from legislative and executive at-large\n\nelections.     Plaintiffs must propose not only changing the means by\n\nwhich Texas' district judges are selected, but also its system of\n\nvenue, perhaps of case assignment procedures, and maybe even its\n\njury selection methods.        The necessity for such proposals is a\n\npowerful testament to the reality that linkage is an essential part\n\nof the structure of the judicial office, much more than the method\n\nof electing the office holder.\n\n     The plaintiffs also contend that the linkage interest deserves\n\nlittle weight because it might be accommodated by remedies other\n\nthan subdistricting. In particular, plaintiffs point to the use of\n\nlimited voting or cumulative voting. The Supreme Court, of course,\n\n\"strongly prefer[s] single-member districts for federal court-\n\nordered reapportionment.\"       Growe v. Emison,            U.S.        ,      , 113\n\nS.Ct. 1075, 1084 (1993).       In any event, we do not agree that this\n\nargument undermines the substantiality of the state's interest.\n\n     The allegedly illegal facet of the existing electoral scheme\n\nis that it employs at-large elections.              Both plaintiffs' amended\n\n\n                                       103\n\fcomplaint   and    plaintiff-intervenors'      complaint-in-intervention\n\nassert that the existing \"at large scheme\" violates § 2, and pray\n\nfor a court order \"that district judges in the targeted counties be\n\nelected in a system which contains single member districts.\"           By\n\nemploying at-large elections, the people of Texas have linked the\n\nelectoral and jurisdictional base of the district judge.\n\n     Limited and cumulative voting are election mechanisms that\n\npreserve at-large elections. Thus, they are not \"remedies\" for the\n\nparticular structural problem that the plaintiffs have chosen to\n\nattack.   At trial, plaintiffs attempted to prove the three Gingles\n\nprerequisites.     This test establishes \"that the minority has the\n\npotential to elect a representative of its own choice in some\n\nsingle-member     district\"   and   \"that   the   challenged   districting\n\nthwarts a distinctive minority by submerging it in a larger white\n\nvoting population.\"     Growe,       U.S. at       , 113 S. Ct. at 1084.\n\nPlaintiffs then tried to supplement that evidence with proof of\n\nZimmer factors, such as past discrimination and anti-single shot\n\nvoting rules.     The question presented by this lawsuit is whether\n\nTexas' at-large election of district judges violates § 2.              To\n\nanswer that question, we must determine the weight of the state's\n\nlinkage interest.     We will not discount that interest based upon\n\npurported remedies that preserve the challenged at-large scheme.\n\nPlaintiffs cannot attack at-large voting as a violation of § 2, and\n\nthen ignore the special characteristics of the judicial office by\n\ninsisting that they will embrace a remedy that preserves that\n\n\n\n\n                                    104\n\fscheme.     To do so would completely shunt consideration of the\n\ninterest to the remedy stage, contrary to Houston Lawyers'.\n\n                  F. Balancing the State's Interest\n\n     In finding that Texas' interest is substantial, we recognize\n\nthat it will not always defeat § 2 liability.          Substantiality is\n\nnot quantifiable, and we translate its force in the practical world\n\nof trials to the burden required to overcome it.            As we see it,\n\nplaintiffs cannot overcome a substantial state interest by proving\n\ninsubstantial    dilution.      We    hold   that   proof   of   dilution,\n\nconsidering the totality of the circumstances, must be substantial\n\nin order to overcome the state's interest in linkage established\n\nhere.    As a matter of law, Texas' interest cannot be overridden by\n\nevidence that sums to a marginal case.       It will take more to create\n\na fact issue for trial.      We must examine the circumstances in each\n\ncounty accordingly.\n\n     We do not now attempt to define in detail what sort of proof\n\nof dilution would be substantial enough to override the state's\n\nlinkage interest.     We do not change the nature or usual means of\n\nproof.    The Gingles prerequisites and Zimmer factors remain.         Two\n\nfacts are especially relevant to assessing the substantiality of\n\nthe plaintiffs' proof of dilution.         One is the willingness of the\n\nracial or ethnic majority--in this case, white voters--to give\n\ntheir votes to minority candidates. The other critical fact is the\n\nability of minority voters to elect candidates of their choice even\n\nwhen opposed by most voters from the majority.          Among the Zimmer\n\nfactors, proof of racial appeals in elections, non-responsiveness\n\n\n                                     105\n\fof elected officials to minority voters, and persistent lack of\n\nelectoral success by minority candidates are most important.\n\n                 VI.   Application of Law to Each County\n\n      We now turn to the application of these principles of law in\n\neach county.     As we have explained, the district court's findings\n\nof dilution are infected by erroneous legal principles.              Findings\n\nthat rest upon erroneous views of the law must be set aside.\n\nPullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U.S. 273, 287, 102 S. Ct. 1781, 1789\n\n(1982).   Remanding for reconsideration is inappropriate where \"the\n\nrecord permits only one resolution of the factual issue.\"              Id. at\n\n292, 102 S. Ct. at 1792.       Here, under controlling law, the evidence\n\nwill not support the findings of liability. Our analysis is common\n\nto all counties but takes us along different routes in different\n\ncounties. In the six counties of Dallas, Tarrant, Travis, Midland,\n\nEctor, and Lubbock, we hold that the district court clearly erred\n\nin finding vote dilution. Even if the district court were correct,\n\nthe   evidence   would   be    outweighed    by   the   State's   substantial\n\ninterest in linkage.          Finally, partisan voting at the least so\n\nweakens the proof of dilution that it loses in the weighing of the\n\ntotality of the circumstances.              Even if we assume that some\n\ndilution may be inferred, in the three remaining counties the\n\nevidence does not outweigh the State's interest in the totality of\n\nthe circumstances.\n\n      One thread runs throughout the plaintiffs' case in all of the\n\ncounties--an insubstantiality of proof that the minority-preferred\n\ncandidate lost \"on account of race.\"          Except in Dallas County, the\n\n\n                                     106\n\fdistrict court's finding of dilution rested on three recitations:\n\n(1) the Gingles prerequisites; (2) an invocation of a general\n\nhistory of discrimination; and (3) the number of minority judges\n\nwas not proportional to the general minority population.               The size\n\nof some counties and the absence of single shot voting were seen as\n\n\"enhancing\" Zimmer factors.              The district court also found two\n\ninstances of racial appeals in Dallas County, one in a judicial\n\nrace won by the minority with white support.\n\n                                 A. Dallas County\n\n     Plaintiffs proceed on behalf of black voters in Dallas County.\n\nThe voting age population of Dallas County is 1,106,757.                Of this\n\nnumber, 180,294 (16.3%) are black.              There are thirty-six different\n\ndistrict courts in Dallas County.              Until 1987, none of the judges\n\nof these districts were black.             In 1987 and 1988, three of the\n\ndistrict judges, or 8.3% of the total, were black.                In 1989, there\n\nwere two black district judges in Dallas County, 5.5% of the total.\n\nToday, five of the thirty-seven36 district judges in Dallas (13.5%)\n\nare black. County court judges are also elected at-large in Dallas\n\nCounty; two of those judges are black. Undisputed expert testimony\n\nand surveys showed that less than 2.0% of the lawyers in Dallas\n\nCounty are both eligible to serve as district judges and black.\n\n     The     evidence      in   Dallas   County    clearly     establishes   that\n\njudicial elections are decided on the basis of partisan voting\n\npatterns.       We   are   left   with    the    inescapable    conclusion   that\n\nplaintiffs have failed to prove that minority-preferred judicial\n\n     36\n          Another district court was added by the legislature.\n\n                                         107\n\fcandidates in this county are consistently defeated by racial bloc\n\nvoting.    This is a failure to meet the threshold showing required\n\nby Gingles.\n\n     Uncontroverted evidence demonstrates that 99% of black Dallas\n\nvoters support the Democratic candidate in every judicial election.\n\nThe evidence also indicates that the majority of white voters\n\nalways voted for the Republican, and thus for candidates other than\n\nthe black-preferred Democratic candidate.               As a result of these\n\nvoting patterns, the black-preferred Democratic candidate always\n\nlost in judicial elections, regardless of the year of the election\n\nin Dallas County.          The Republican Party dominated every analyzed\n\njudicial race.         Defendants understandably contend that the defeat\n\nof black-preferred candidates is the result of party affiliation\n\nrather    than    racial    considerations.       According    to    defendants,\n\nelections are determined by straight-party voting in which voters\n\nsupport    their       party's   ticket    regardless   of   the    race   of   the\n\ncandidates.        The undisputed facts overwhelmingly support this\n\ncontention.        Plaintiffs offer the only answer they have--the\n\nevidence is not legally relevant.\n\n     Drs. Engstrom and Taebel, plaintiffs' and defendants' experts\n\nrespectively, analyzed seven district court general elections with\n\nblack candidates.          The following table summarizes the experts'\n\nanalyses, in particular the amount of support from white voters\n\nreceived by each candidate.          The first figure represents the \"non-\n\nblack vote\" as estimated by plaintiffs' expert.                    The range is\n\ndefined   by     the    homogenous   precinct    and    bi-variate    regression\n\n\n                                          108\n\fanalysis performed by Engstrom. The second figure, in parentheses,\n\nrepresents the white vote as estimated by Taebel.                      Taebel did not\n\nanalyze the 1984 Tinsley-Maloney race.\n\n                                       Table VI.A\n\nYear   Court              Candidates    Race      Party   Non-black (white) vote\n1980   191st District     Winn          B         D       38.6-39.7% (36%)\n                          Howell        W         R\n1984   Crim Dist Ct 2     Baraka        B         R       60.6-61.8% (61%)\n                          Metcalfe      W         D\n \"     Crim Dist Ct 4     Tinsley       B         D       28.7-30%\n                          Maloney       W         R\n \"     301st District     White         B         D       30.6-31.9% (31%)\n                          O'Donnell     W         R\n1986   195th District     Tinsley       B         D       36.6-37.5% (31%)\n                          Kendall       W         R\n \"     256th District     Wright        B         R       70.6-71.7% (77%)\n                          Brin          W         D\n1988   95th District      Oliver        B         D       36.9-37.9% (38%)\n                          Brown         W         R\n\n\nRoughly 61%-77% of white voters consistently supported Republicans,\n\neven when black Republicans ran against white Democrats. Virtually\n\nall black voters supported the Democratic candidate, even when the\n\nDemocratic candidate was white, running against black Republicans.\n\n       Black Republicans won in two of the seven analyzed district\n\ncourt    races.         According      to    Taebel's        study,    one    of   these\n\nRepublicans, Carolyn Wright, did better among white voters than any\n\nother Republican, white or black, winning 77% of the white vote.\n\nOther black Republicans received percentages of the white vote\n\ncomparable to those received by white Republicans.                       Judge Baraka,\n\nthe other black Republican district court candidate, took about 61%\n\nof the white vote against a white Democrat.                   County Judge Brashear,\n\nanother black Republican running at-large against a white Democrat,\n\ntook 66% of the white vote in his successful race for a county\n\ncourt judgeship.\n\n                                            109\n\f     Just as black Republicans did as well or better than white\n\nRepublicans, black Democrats also won as large a percentage of the\n\nwhite vote as white Democratic candidates.      The white vote for\n\nDemocratic candidates ranged between 23% and 39%.      According to\n\nplaintiffs' exhibits, black Democrat Oliver won about 38%--a larger\n\nthan average share of the white vote for a Democrat.   Winn, another\n\nblack Democrat, received almost four out of ten white votes.     By\n\ncomparison, white Democrat Brin received no more than 29% of the\n\nwhite vote when running against Wright, a black Republican.\n\n     Republican candidates lost the black vote and won the white\n\nvote regardless of their public positions on matters related to\n\nrace.    Judge Wright, for instance, had been a member of the Dallas\n\nChapter of the Coalition of 100 Black Women; served as a legal\n\nintern for the Lawyers' Committee on Civil Rights, a project\n\nrelated to civil rights in South Africa; and was a charter member\n\nand past vice-chair of the National Political Congress of Black\n\nWomen.    By contrast, the record is silent regarding the record of\n\nher white Democratic opponent, Brin.     Brin nevertheless won the\n\nblack vote handily in the general election.    At the same time, an\n\noverwhelming number of white voters supported Wright.\n\n     Dr. Champagne, an expert called by defendants, testified that\n\nthis voting pattern was the result of straight-ticket voting.\n\nAccording to Dr. Champagne, judicial elections are low-profile\n\nelections in which the voters know little more about the candidates\n\nthan what they read on the ballot.      The voters, therefore, will\n\nmake their choice based upon the information that the ballot\n\n\n                                 110\n\fcontains--party affiliation.          Because a majority of voters in\n\nDallas County are Republican, Republican candidates prevail in most\n\nof the judicial races.\n\n      We are unable to find the requisite presence of race in this\n\ndata.     The undisputed facts permit no conclusion but that the\n\ndefeat of black-preferred candidates was the result of the voters'\n\npartisan affiliation. The black-preferred candidate was always the\n\nDemocratic candidate, while the majority of white voters always\n\nsupported the Republican candidate. It is significant to the probe\n\nfor racial influences that 30% to 40% of the white electorate\n\nsupported Democratic candidates, although the combination of black\n\nand white Democratic votes was insufficient to carry the Democratic\n\ncandidate.      The point is that a black Democratic voter and a white\n\nDemocratic voter stand in the same position.              Both are unable to\n\nelect the Democratic judicial candidate they prefer.\n\n      We repeat.       The race of the candidate did not affect the\n\npattern. White voters' support for black Republican candidates was\n\nequal to or greater than their support for white Republicans.\n\nLikewise, black and white Democratic candidates received equal\n\npercentages of the white vote.         Given these facts, we cannot see\n\nhow   minority-preferred      judicial      candidates    were   defeated   \"on\n\naccount    of   race   or   color.\"      Rather,   the    minority-preferred\n\ncandidates were consistently defeated because they ran as members\n\nof the weaker of two partisan organizations.             We are not persuaded\n\nthat this is racial bloc voting as required by Gingles.\n\n\n\n\n                                      111\n\f     Plaintiffs contend that the Democratic Party better represents\n\nthe political views of black voters in Dallas County.                   This is\n\ndoubtlessly the view of black voters, but it is not relevant to\n\nwhether the minority-preferred candidate is defeated on account of\n\nrace.   To the extent that candidates preferred by black voters are\n\nconsistently      defeated   because    of   their   substantive      political\n\npositions, they are the casualties of interest group politics, not\n\nracial considerations.        This is not the harm against which § 2\n\nprotects.      Section 2 protects black voters against defeat on\n\naccount of race or color, not on account of political platform.\n\nSee Whitcomb, 403 U.S. at 154-55, 91 S. Ct. at 1874-75.                  We are\n\nsensitive to the reality that political positions can be proxies\n\nfor racial prejudice.        However, where white voters support black\n\ncandidates of a particular party in larger percentage than they\n\nsupport white candidates of the same party, there is no basis,\n\nwithout more, for us to conclude that the parties' political\n\npositions are proxies for racial bias.\n\n     Even assuming arguendo that plaintiffs have met the Gingles\n\nthreshold    by    showing    racial    bloc    voting,   the     totality   of\n\ncircumstances     in   the   record    cannot   support   a   §   2   violation.\n\nPlaintiff-intervenors Oliver, White, and Tinsley contend that \"race\n\nconsiderations pervade elections in Dallas County.\"               They support\n\nthis proposition with the district court's finding that there were\n\ntwo instances of overt or subtle racial appeals in Dallas County\n\nelections.   In one, judicial candidate Baraka was labeled a \"Black\n\nMuslim\" by his opponent.       In another, district attorney candidate\n\n\n                                       112\n\fVance printed his own and his opponent West's pictures in campaign\n\nliterature, thus informing the electorate that he was a white\n\ncandidate    running    against    a    black   opponent.       Nothing      in    the\n\ndistrict court's opinion indicates that these racial appeals were\n\nanything more than isolated incidents.                   In the only judicial\n\nelection affected by a racial appeal, Judge Baraka, the black\n\ncandidate,    won    both    the   Republican      primary     and   the    general\n\nelection, winning a majority of the white vote in both elections.\n\n     Oliver, Tinsley, and White also contended at trial that voting\n\npatterns in nonpartisan elections show that partisan affiliation\n\ncould not explain the defeats of black-preferred candidates.                       Dr.\n\nWeiser, a statistician with experience in voting rights litigation,\n\npresented this data.         Weiser examined seven Dallas City Council\n\nelections, a presidential primary, and referenda on public transit\n\nfunding, a police-review board, and the city council structure.\n\nThe district court made no findings about the data.                        Assuming\n\narguendo that these high-profile elections had any relevance to\n\nvoting   patterns      in   low-profile       judicial    elections,       the    data\n\npresented do not support plaintiffs' argument.                       For example,\n\nalthough    Weiser   emphasized        that   black    city   council   candidate\n\nWilliams drew 27% and 7% of the vote in the most predominantly\n\nblack and white precincts, respectively, the fact remains that his\n\nopponent Rucker won a majority of the black vote and the election.\n\nOther    black-preferred      candidates,       such     as   Strauss   in       1983,\n\nprevailed in three of the other six city council elections Weiser\n\nstudied.     In the 1984 Democratic presidential primary, Jesse\n\n\n                                        113\n\fJackson won a plurality (46%) of the Dallas vote.                Simply put,\n\nthese nonpartisan elections do not demonstrate the consistent\n\ndefeat of minority-preferred candidates.            To the contrary, the\n\nevidence shows that black-preferred candidates won a majority of\n\nthe white vote and the election in most cases.\n\n     Extending our compass to the totality of circumstances fails\n\nto bring evidence that racial politics played any role in the\n\ndefeat of black-preferred candidates.       The district court rejected\n\nthe suggestion    that   the   Republican   Party    is   a    white   slating\n\norganization.    Testimony shows that any eligible candidate could\n\nrun as a Republican, regardless of race. The plaintiff-intervenors\n\ntestified themselves that they had been heavily lobbied by the\n\nRepublican Party leadership to run on the Republican ticket.\n\nRunning as Republicans, the great likelihood is that these former\n\ndistrict judges would have been elected, as plaintiff-intervenors\n\nconceded at trial.\n\n     The plaintiffs presented general evidence of the lingering\n\neffects of past discrimination, but offered no specific evidence of\n\ndepressed levels of black political participation such as low black\n\nvoter registration or turnout.         On the contrary, the minority-\n\npreferred candidates ran professional, well-financed campaigns\n\nbacked by the Democratic Party, a party that, until the late\n\n1970's,   had   dominated   Dallas    County   judicial       races    just   as\n\ncompletely as the Republican Party now dominates those races.\n\nThese Democratic candidates lost because Dallas County shifted from\n\n\n\n\n                                     114\n\fbeing a county of predominantly Democratic straight-ticket voters\n\nto a county of mostly Republican straight-ticket voters.\n\n     Plaintiffs    made   no   factual   riposte   to   the    overwhelming\n\nevidence that election outcomes were the product of partisan\n\naffiliation.    Rather, plaintiffs' answer was the legal assertion\n\nthat the effect of partisan affiliation, virtually admitted, is not\n\nrelevant.    Plaintiffs' expert, Engstrom, conceded that there is \"a\n\nstronger association between partisan affiliation and success than\n\nthere is between the race of the candidate and success,\" while\n\nclinging to the assertion that partisan affiliation does not\n\nexplain all of the voting patterns in Dallas County.            Finally, he\n\nconceded that he had no data that black Democrats generally did\n\nworse than white Democrats.       In fact, the undisputed facts show\n\nthat, when one controls for party, black candidates did as well as,\n\nor better than, white candidates in winning the white voter and\n\nelections.     Plaintiff-intervenor      White   conceded     that    partisan\n\naffiliation determined her electoral defeat in 1984.           She admitted\n\nthat \"if I ran as a Republican . . . the likelihood is that I would\n\nwin.\"\n\n     In short, the facts demonstrate that partisan affiliation, not\n\nrace, was responsible for the defeat of the minority-preferred\n\ncandidate in Dallas County.      The district court erred in finding\n\nracial vote dilution and a violation of § 2.\n\n                           B. Harris County\n\n     Harris County elects 59 district judges at-large.               Three are\n\nblack, three are Hispanic, and the rest are Anglo.                   One black\n\n\n                                   115\n\fcounty court judge also was elected at-large.               Uncontested expert\n\ntestimony and surveys establish that black lawyers make up at most\n\n3.8% of the eligible lawyers, but comprise 5.1% of Harris County's\n\ndistrict judges.      According to plaintiffs' evidence, 1,685,024\n\npeople of voting age reside in Harris County; 305,986 (18.2%) are\n\nblack, and 222,662 (13.2%) are Hispanic.                  Plaintiffs claim to\n\nrepresent all black voters in Harris County.\n\n     The district court found a § 2 violation based on the three\n\nGingles   prerequisites,      two   primary    Zimmer     factors,    and    three\n\n\"enhancing\" Zimmer factors.          The primary Zimmer factors were (1)\n\nthe general history and lingering effects of past discrimination\n\nand (2) the small number of successful black judicial candidates.\n\nThe enhancing Zimmer factors were (1) the large size of Harris\n\nCounty; (2) the prevention of single shot voting by numbered post\n\nelection; and (3) the majority runoff requirement in primary\n\nelections.     Defendants     contend       that,   under    the    proper   legal\n\nstandards, the evidence before the district court amounts at best\n\nto a weak case of dilution that is clearly outweighed by Texas'\n\ninterest in linkage.     We agree.\n\n     Defendants argue that the district court's determination that\n\nHarris    County   district   court    elections     were    characterized      by\n\nlegally significant racial bloc voting rests on two fundamental\n\ndepartures from controlling law.            They maintain that the district\n\ncourt erred in (1) refusing to consider evidence demonstrating that\n\ndivergent    voting   patterns      among   black   and     white   voters    were\n\nattributable to partisan affiliation and (2) excluding elections in\n\n\n                                      116\n\fwhich     the    black-preferred      candidate     was      Hispanic    despite\n\noverwhelming evidence that Harris County black and Hispanic voters\n\nwere a cohesive group within the meaning of § 2. In light of our\n\nprevious discussion, these contentions plainly have merit.37\n\n     Engstrom studied only 17 district court elections involving\n\nblack     candidates.     Taebel     studied   45   Harris    County    judicial\n\nelections between 1980 and 1988 with either a black or Hispanic\n\ncandidate, including 24 district court elections, 9 county court\n\nelections,      one   court   of   appeals   election,    one   Supreme    Court\n\nelection, and ten primary elections.

The Association does not deny that black and Hispanic\nvoters uniformly supported the same candidates in virtually every\nelection analyzed, thus making them a cohesive group under our\nprecedents. Rather, it objects to our examination of these races\non the more general grounds that \"minorities protected by the\nVoting Rights Act are not interchangeable\" and that the success\nof Hispanic candidates \"does not tell us anything about the\nwillingness of white voters to support African American\ncandidates.\" These objections, of course, go directly to the\nrule permitting the aggregation of different racial and ethnic\nminorities itself rather than its application to the facts of\nthis case. We do not understand either the Association or any\nother plaintiffs to challenge the validity of this general rule.\nNevertheless, as we demonstrate below, the weight of Texas'\nlinkage interest precludes the finding of a § 2 violation even if\nthese Hispanic-white elections are excluded.\n\n                                       117\n\fminority candidates.

The black-\n\npreferred candidate in Harris County, regardless of race, was\n\nalways     the         Democratic           candidate.        For   white   voters,    party\n\naffiliation always trumped race in predicting which candidates\n\nwould be supported. The Republican candidate always won the white\n\nvote, generally taking between 55% and 65%, whether the Republican\n\ncandidate was black, Hispanic, or Anglo.                            Similarly, Democratic\n\ncandidates always took almost all black and Hispanic votes, even\n\nwhen a white Democrat ran against a black or Hispanic Republican.\n\n      Both the exhibits and expert testimony indicated that party,\n\nnot   race,      was      the     decisive          factor     in   determining    electoral\n\noutcomes. For example, when white Democrat Schuble defeated black\n\nRepublican Proctor in a 1986 district court race, Proctor won the\n\nmajority of the white vote, but lost more than 95% of the black\n\nvote to Schuble.           Likewise, when Irvin, another black Republican,\n\nran for a county court judgeship against white Democrat Duncan,\n\nIrvin won the white vote while Duncan received virtually all of the\n\nblack vote.       Kenneth Hoyt, now a United States District Judge, won\n\nthe white vote and the election in his bid for the state appellate\n\nbench against a white Democratic opponent in 1984.

Engstrom     limited     his    study    to   elections\n\ninvolving black candidates.         Since the black-preferred candidate\n\noften is not black, this precluded Engstrom from determining\n\nwhether whites in Harris County consistently voted as a bloc to\n\ndefeat       black-preferred   candidates,    as    he     admitted      at   trial.\n\nEngstrom also excluded judicial elections with Hispanic candidates\n\nand races for seats on the county court, which are also conducted\n\non a county-wide basis.\n\n       The black-preferred candidate won only two, or 11.8%, of the\n\n17 district court elections analyzed by Engstrom.                   Ten of these\n\nlosses by black Democrats, however, occurred in 1980, 1984, and\n\n1988,    when    popular   Republican    presidential       candidates        helped\n\nRepublican judicial candidates to defeat virtually all of their\n\nDemocratic opponents.          The victors included Judge Hoyt, a black\n\ncandidate running as a Republican. As Engstrom conceded, white and\n\nblack Democrats alike were \"wiped out\" during these years.\n\n       The fortunes of Harris County Democrats, and thus black\n\nvoters,      improved   considerably    in   1982    and    1986,    when     either\n\nGovernor Mark White or Senator Lloyd Bentsen headed the Democratic\n\nticket.        As in the Republican years of 1980, 1984, and 1988,\n\nsuccess at the top of the ballot carried down to judicial races\n\nmarked more by anonymity than name identity. Thus, black-preferred\n\n\n                                       120\n\fcandidates won more than a third of the indigenous judicial races\n\nin which black candidates participated--5 out of 14, or 35.7%.\n\nConsidering elections with Hispanic candidates, black-preferred\n\ncandidates won 13 out of 24 indigenous judicial elections, or\n\n52.4%.   Narrowing the focus to district court races, black voters\n\nelected the candidate of their choice 8 out of 14 times.                   In these\n\nyears, the black-preferred candidate for district judge won in\n\n57.1% of the elections studied.        Even when the results of the lean\n\nyears of 1980, 1984, and 1988 are included, we find that the black-\n\npreferred    candidate   prevailed     in   14   out   of   40     (35%)    of   all\n\nindigenous judicial elections with minority candidates. The record\n\nalso indicates that black-preferred candidates won three out of\n\nfive exogenous races for appellate and Supreme Court seats during\n\nthese years.\n\n     Plaintiffs insist, however, that partisan affiliation cannot\n\nexplain all of the results in this case, for in years not dominated\n\nby the Republican Party, black Democrats enjoyed less success than\n\nother Democrats.     In the 1982 district court contests, white and\n\nHispanic Democrats won 12 of 14 races, while black Democrats won\n\nonly one of three.       In 1986, black Democrats won two of eight\n\nindigenous judicial races; the success rate of white Democrats is\n\nnot found in the record.      Engstrom stated, without discussing the\n\nsupporting data, that between 1980 and 1988, white Democratic\n\ncandidates     enjoyed   a   better    success    rate      than    their    black\n\ncounterparts.\n\n\n\n\n                                      121\n\f     This evidence may reflect a preference among white Democrats\n\nfor white and Hispanic rather than black candidates.           Plaintiffs'\n\nassertion that race is at work, however, is contradicted by the\n\nsuccess of black candidates in the Democratic primary, where party\n\naffiliation plays no part.        An exhibit introduced by Houston\n\nLawyers' Association shows that black candidates won 9 of 16, or\n\n56.3%, of the contested primary races.       This showing detracts from\n\nthe force of plaintiffs' claim.\n\n     The proof of vote dilution is marginal. The undisputed facts\n\nshow that a majority of white voters invariably supported black\n\nRepublican candidates, suggesting that the defeat of minority-\n\npreferred   candidates   was     largely,     although   not       entirely,\n\nattributable to partisan affiliation.       Moreover, black voters were\n\nconsistently able to elect representatives of their choice, even\n\nwhen they were opposed by a majority of white voters.             The record\n\nindicates that black-preferred candidates prevailed in 14 out of 40\n\nnon-exogenous   elections   in   which      either   black   or    Hispanic\n\ncandidates participated--35% of the time.       Limiting the inquiry to\n\ndistrict court races, black-preferred candidates still won in 9 of\n\n28 races, or 32.1%.\n\n     Black voters could, therefore, repeatedly elect candidates of\n\ntheir choice, even when opposed by a majority of white voters.           Far\n\nfrom being submerged in a white majority, black voters were a\n\npotent electoral force that could form coalitions with minorities\n\nof white voters to elect their preferred candidates.         This ability\n\nto form coalitions and influence the elections of all judges in\n\n\n                                  122\n\fHarris   County     would    be    lost   in     the   system      of   single-member\n\ndistricts proposed by the plaintiffs.              Instead, black voters might\n\ncontrol the election of perhaps ten judges, abdicate any right to\n\nvote for the remaining forty-nine, and thus radically reduce the\n\nchances of having disputes affecting them decided by a judge they\n\nhad any hand in electing.          A similar observation can be made in the\n\nother    counties     but    is    strikingly      apt     in   this     large   urban\n\nenvironment.\n\n     The remaining evidence adds little to plaintiffs' claims of\n\nillegal vote dilution.            Plaintiffs offered little evidence that\n\npast discrimination and socioeconomic disparities between blacks\n\nand whites hindered the ability of black residents of Harris County\n\nto participate in the political process.                 In particular, there was\n\nno suggestion at trial of a lower-than-average voter registration\n\nor turnout rate among black citizens.                  In addition, the evidence\n\nindicated that disproportionate levels of poverty within the black\n\ncommunity had no effect on the ability of black judicial candidates\n\nto raise the funds necessary to compete on a county-wide basis.                    At\n\ntrial, Bonnie Fitch testified, without elaboration, that a few\n\nblack incumbents experienced some difficulty in obtaining financing\n\nfor their campaigns, but she attributed these problems to \"racial\n\ndiscrimination\" and the candidates' \"past record of losing.\" Even\n\nif this isolated, equivocal testimony could somehow be construed to\n\nsuggest that a lack of resources among black residents hindered\n\nblack candidates' campaigns, it was sharply contradicted by the\n\naccounts    related     by    Jackson      and    Berry,     two    black    judicial\n\n\n                                          123\n\fcandidates. They testified that they were each able to raise\n\nsufficient   funds   and    that    they       in    fact    outspent     their   white\n\nRepublican opponents by ratios exceeding ten-to-one. In light of\n\nthis evidence, the district court's finding that the effects of\n\npast discrimination hampered the black community's access to the\n\npolitical process was clearly erroneous.\n\n     Likewise, the representation of blacks on the Harris County\n\nbench cannot support an inference of racial politics. Three blacks\n\nare district     judges--5.1%       of   the        total.     By   contrast,     black\n\nattorneys make up at most only 3.8% of the eligible lawyers in\n\nHarris   County.     The     fact    that      blacks        constitute    a   smaller\n\npercentage of the district judges than of the county population is\n\ntherefore not surprising. If judges were chosen at random from the\n\npool of eligible candidates, there would be fewer black district\n\njudges on the Harris County bench.\n\n     Aside from the number of black judges and the general history\n\nof discrimination, the district court found three Zimmer enhancing\n\nfactors.   See Nevett v. Sides, 571 F.2d 209, 218 (5th Cir. 1978).\n\nSuch factors enhance the opportunity of a white majority to engage\n\nin racial politics.        They do not, however, \"meaningfully advance\n\nthe inquiry into whether race is at issue,\" Terrazas v. Clements,\n\n581 F. Supp. 1319, 1346 n.26 (N.D. Tex. 1983) (three-judge panel),\n\nand therefore do not support an inference of racial politics in\n\nHarris County.\n\n     The   circumstantial     evidence         of     a   relation   between      black\n\nvoters' electoral losses and race is, at best, tenuous, given the\n\n\n                                         124\n\fwillingness of white voters to support black Republican candidates\n\nand the consistent success enjoyed by black-preferred judicial\n\ncandidates. Even if the considerable success among black-preferred\n\nHispanic candidates is discounted, the evidence presented at trial\n\nhardly sums to the level of dilution that might outweigh Texas'\n\nsubstantial interest in linking a trial judge's jurisdiction with\n\nher electoral base.   Given the undisputed evidence that nearly all\n\nof the losses suffered by black candidates occurred in years when\n\nvirtually   the   entire   party   slate   went   down   in   defeat   and\n\nplaintiffs' negligible showing under the Zimmer factors, the claim\n\nbefore us reduces itself to a contention that Texas' 143-year-old\n\nelectoral scheme must be dismantled in Harris County because a few\n\nblack candidates--most of them recently-appointed incumbents--\n\nfailed to attract decisive support from white voters within the\n\nDemocratic Party. We express no opinion as to whether this minimal\n\nproof of dilution might establish a violation of § 2 absent the\n\nsubstantial state interest.        Even assuming that it would, we\n\nconclude as a matter of law that plaintiffs' proof at best produces\n\nonly a marginal case in Harris County, too insubstantial to survive\n\nthe weighing of the totality of the circumstances particularly so\n\nif any appreciable weight is given the linkage interest.\n\n                           C. Tarrant County\n\n     There are 23 district courts in Tarrant County.          From 1985 to\n\n1988, three of these judges (13.0%) were black.          As of 1989, two\n\ndistrict judges are black (8.7%).          The defendants' undisputed\n\nevidence indicates that only 2.4% of the eligible Tarrant County\n\n\n                                   125\n\flawyers are black.       There are 613,698 residents of voting age in\n\nTarrant   County.       Of   this    number,     63,851    (10.4%)   are   black.\n\nPlaintiffs proceed on behalf of black voters in Tarrant County.\n\n      The evidence indicates that blacks voted cohesively for the\n\nDemocratic candidate.        Dr. Brischetto, plaintiffs' expert for this\n\ncounty, analyzed four elections:               three general elections for\n\ndistrict judgeships and the 1988 Democratic presidential primary.\n\nIn all four elections, the regression estimates show that from 85%\n\nto 100% of black voters in Tarrant County supported the black-\n\npreferred, Democratic candidate. Taebel's analysis similarly shows\n\ncohesion.\n\n      Taebel    analyzed     nine    general     elections,    including    three\n\nexogenous elections, in which a black or Hispanic had participated.\n\nThese included five district court races, one county court race,\n\ntwo Supreme Court races, and a contest for Texas Attorney General.\n\nBrischetto analyzed only four elections, in which black candidates\n\nhad participated.       As in all other counties, the evidence shows\n\nconsistent black support for Democratic candidates.              The following\n\ntables summarize the analyzed races involving black or Hispanic\n\ncandidates.      For each black-preferred candidate, the estimated\n\npercentage of the white vote is listed.                   These are based upon\n\nTaebel's estimates, except those in parentheses, which reflect\n\nBrischetto's     regression    and    homogenous     precinct    analyses.     A\n\n\"check\" mark indicates a victory by the black-preferred candidate.\n\n                                    Table VI.C\nIndigenous judicial elections (Tarrant County)\n\n\n\n                                       126\n\fYear   Court                     Candidates    Race   Party White Vote\n1982   233d District             Valderas      H      D      36%               T\n                                 Hines         W      R\n \"     County Crim Ct 4          Perez         H      D      48%               T\n                                 Lynch         W      R\n1986   233d District             Weaver        W      R\n                                 Valderas      H      D      40%\n \"     Crim Dist Ct 1            Sturns        B      R\n                                 Goldsmith     W      D      43% (51-56%)\n \"     Crim Dist Ct 4            Drago         W      D      45% (54-59%)      T\n                                 Salvant       B      R\n1988   Crim Dist Ct 2            Dauphinot     W      R\n                                 Davis         B      D      40% (42-50%)\nExogenous elections (Tarrant County)\n\nYear   Court/Office              Candidates    Race   Party White Vote\n1986   Attorney General          Barrera       H      R\n                                 Mattox        W      D      39%\n \"     Supreme Court Pl 4        Bates         W      R\n                                 Gonzalez      H      D      38%\n \"     Supreme Court Pl 3        Gonzalez      H      D      46%               T\n                                 Howell        W      R\n1988   Dem Pres Primary          Jackson       B             (14-16%)\n                                 Dukakis       W\n                                 Gore          W\n                                 Gephardt      W\n                                 Hart          W\n                                 Simon         W\n\n\n       Unlike other counties, black judges occupied more than 13% of\n\nthe district judgeships in Tarrant County for four out of five\n\nyears--a     proportion     of   the   bench      that    is   greater      than   the\n\nproportion of black voters in the county's population.\n\n       The success of black-preferred candidates was also greater in\n\nTarrant County than elsewhere.                In those general elections with\nblack candidates, the black-preferred, Democratic candidate won\n\nonly one out of three general elections--33.3% of the studied\n\nraces.     However, in nine general elections with either black or\n\nHispanic candidates included in Taebel's study, the black-preferred\n\ncandidate won four out of nine, or 44.4% of the elections.                     In the\n\nsix indigenous district and county court elections studied, the\n\nblack-preferred candidate won three out of six, or 50% of the\n\n\n                                        127\n\felections.   These figures do not indicate the consistent defeat of\n\nblack-preferred candidates.\n\n     The   district   court,   by   contrast,   found   that   the   black-\n\npreferred candidate was consistently defeated in Tarrant County.\n\nThe district court reached this conclusion by ignoring elections in\n\nwhich Hispanics had participated. This rejection of white-Hispanic\n\nelections was erroneous.       The undisputed facts, as reflected by\n\nTaebel's exhibits, are that a majority of Hispanic voters always\n\nsupported the same candidate favored by black voters in every\n\ngeneral election. The district court found that Hispanic and black\n\nvoters were cohesive in Midland, Lubbock, and Ector Counties on\n\nsimilar evidence.      With virtually identical proof in Tarrant\n\nCounty, the same conclusion must follow, and we hold that it does.\n\n     Brischetto included the 1988 Democratic presidential primary\n\nin which Jesse Jackson won virtually all of the black vote in\n\nTarrant County, but only between 14% and 16% of the white vote.39\n\nDefendants exhibits include a 1986 Democratic primary for district\n\ncourt in which Ross, the black-preferred candidate, received 57% of\n\nthe black vote, but lost the white vote and thus came in third out\n\nof a field of four candidates.       Those exhibits show, however, two\n\nother Democratic primaries--ignored by Brischetto--in which black-\n\npreferred Hispanic candidates prevailed.40\n\n     39\n      We note that there were five other viable Democratic\ncandidates (Dukakis, Gore, Gephardt, Hart, and Simon) in the 1988\nprimary, so that Jackson could expect to receive only 16.7% of\nthe white vote if that vote were randomly distributed.\n     40\n      Taebel's exhibits also include a 1982 county court primary\nthat the black-preferred candidate, Hicks, seemed to win by seven\n\n                                    128\n\f     In   short,    the   evidence    shows   that    the   black-preferred\n\ncandidate won 40% of the Democratic primaries and half of the\n\nindigenous judicial elections studied, including the elections with\n\nHispanic candidates.      The record also shows that black judges have\n\nconsistently made up a greater proportion of district judges in\n\nTarrant County (13.0%) than the proportion of black voters in the\n\ncounty's population (10.4%), and far more than the proportion of\n\neligible black attorneys (2.4%).\n\n     Furthermore,     the   undisputed     evidence    shows   that   black\n\ncandidates won as great a share of white votes as white candidates,\n\nif we control for party affiliation. For instance, Sturns, a black\n\nRepublican with a long history of involvement in civil rights and\n\nblack community organizations, won 57% of the white vote to beat a\n\nwhite Democrat.      Salvant, another black Republican, also won a\n\nmajority (55%) of the white vote, although he lost his race for a\n\ndistrict judgeship to a white Democrat supported by a combination\n\nof black voters, Hispanic voters, and white Democrats.                Black\n\nRepublicans also won the same share (50%) of elections as white\n\nRepublicans among the races with black or Hispanic candidates.\n\n     Finally, blacks have not been underrepresented on the Tarrant\n\nCounty bench.   Plaintiffs' exhibit indicates that, for four out of\n\nthe five years studied, three of Tarrant County's district judges\n\nwere black; for these four years, while blacks made up only 10.4%\n\nof the county's voting age population, more than 13% of the\n\n\n\nvotes. This tabulation, however, was based upon elections\nreturns prior to a recount under which Hicks apparently lost.\n\n                                     129\n\frelevant office holders were black.            Given this persistent and\n\nsubstantial   black   presence   on    the   Tarrant    County    bench,     the\n\nconsistent    and     substantial     success     of     minority-preferred\n\ncandidates, and the absence of any evidence of racial politics in\n\nTarrant County, we conclude that, even if the plaintiffs had proven\n\nthe Gingles prerequisites, the district court clearly erred in\n\nfinding illegal vote dilution under the totality of circumstances.\n\nThis is so even if we ignore the fact that blacks and Hispanics\n\nvoted cohesively in Tarrant County and exclude the races with\n\nHispanic candidates     from   our    analysis.       Looking    at   just    the\n\ndistrict court general elections involving black candidates, the\n\nblack-preferred candidate won 33.3% of the time.           In light of the\n\nevidence just discussed, which excluding Hispanic elections does\n\nnot change, reducing the relevant success rate from 44.4% to 33.3%\n\nis insignificant in the totality of the circumstances. There is no\n\ncase as a matter of law in Tarrant County.\n\n                           D. Travis County\n\n     There are 13 district judges elected in Travis County.                  From\n\n1985 to 1988, one of them was Hispanic, or 7.7% of the total.                This\n\njudge was defeated in 1988.      Hispanic lawyers make up 2.7% of the\n\neligible lawyers in the county.            There are 312,392 voting age\n\nresidents in Travis County, which encompasses Austin, Texas.                  Of\n\nthem, 44,847 (14.4%) have Spanish surnames. Only 29,067 (9.3%) are\n\nblack.   The district court found that a \"minimally contiguous,\"\n\npredominantly-Hispanic     judicial        district    could     be   created.\n\nPlaintiffs proceed on behalf of Hispanic voters in Travis County.\n\n\n                                     130\n\f     Plaintiffs' witnesses stated that the Republican Party is\n\ninsignificant in Travis County and the proper testing ground for\n\ncandidates is the Democratic primary.      Plaintiffs analyzed three\n\nDemocratic primary elections:   one for district court and two for\n\ncounty court positions.    Defendants analyzed eleven elections:\n\nfour exogenous general elections, including one state senate, one\n\nAttorney General, and two Supreme Court races; four exogenous\n\nprimary elections, including one state senate, one Supreme Court,\n\nand two appellate court primaries; and finally the same three\n\nindigenous judicial elections studied by plaintiffs.\n\n     By Taebel's analysis, the Hispanic-preferred candidate won all\n\nfour of the exogenous general elections.    In three of the four, the\n\nHispanic-preferred candidate also won a majority of the Anglo vote.\n\nIn addition, the Hispanic-preferred candidate won two exogenous\n\nprimaries, for Supreme Court and state senate. Thus, the Hispanic-\n\npreferred candidate prevailed in two of the four (50%) exogenous\n\nprimaries and two of the seven (28.6%) primaries studied overall.\n\nAltogether, the Hispanic-preferred candidate won 54.5% of the\n\nindigenous and exogenous elections analyzed.\n\n     The district court found, however, that the three indigenous\n\nprimary elections for judicial positions were \"closer in nature to\n\nDistrict Court elections\" and sufficed to show a pattern of racial\n\nbloc voting sufficient to defeat the Hispanic-preferred candidate.\n\nThe district court therefore relied solely on the three elections\n\nanalyzed by both Taebel and Brischetto to find that the Hispanic-\n\npreferred candidate lost 100% of the time.\n\n\n                                131\n\f       In   the   one     district   court     and   two    county    court     primary\n\nelections analyzed by the parties, the Hispanic, and Hispanic-\n\npreferred, candidate was defeated by a white majority.                        In one of\n\nthese races, however, white voters gave their support to a black\n\ncandidate, and thereby defeated both the Hispanic Castro and\n\nHughes, a white candidate.            Kennedy, the black candidate, had the\n\noverwhelming support of black as well as white voters, so it is\n\ndifficult to conclude that Castro was defeated by a white bloc.\n\nCastro and Hughes were defeated by a black-white coalition.                       Thus,\n\nCastro's defeat is not evidence of the white majority's ability\n\n\"usually to defeat the minority's preferred candidate.\"                        Gingles,\n\n478 U.S. at 51, 106 S. Ct. at 2766-67.\n\n       The two remaining indigenous primary elections offer a meager\n\nbase for liability.         The plaintiffs' case reduces to three facts:\n\n(1) Hispanic-preferred candidates Gallardo and Garcia gained only\n\n33% to 37% of the Anglo vote in 1988 Democratic primaries, and\n\nfailed to win nominations for district and county court elections;\n\n(2) only one Hispanic, Gallardo, served as district judge between\n\n1985 and 1998, while no Hispanic now serves; and (3) Hispanics have\n\nsuffered from past discrimination in Travis County.                      We conclude\n\nthat the district court clearly erred to find illegal vote dilution\n\non this record.\n\n       In finding clear error, we repeat Justice Brennan's admonition\n\nthat    \"the      usual    predictability       of    the        majority's     success\n\ndistinguishes       structural       dilution    from      the    mere   loss    of   an\n\noccasional election.\"         Gingles, 478 U.S. at 51, 106 S. Ct. at 2767.\n\n\n                                         132\n\fIt defies common sense to believe that the loss of two primary\n\nraces in one year constitutes usual and predictable defeat by a\n\nwhite bloc, rather than simply \"loss of an occasional election.\"\n\nHowever, assuming arguendo that these two elections constitute\n\nsufficient proof of the third Gingles prerequisite, they are too\n\nmeager to prove dilution under the totality of circumstances, as a\n\nmatter of law.\n\n     The plaintiffs contend that Hispanics are underrepresented\n\namong district judges in Travis County.       Hispanics made up 7.7% of\n\nthose judges in four out of five recent years, while making up no\n\nmore than 2.7% of the lawyers eligible under Texas law to fill\n\nthose posts.      Given such a small pool of qualified candidates, it\n\nis not surprising that Hispanics have made up a small proportion of\n\nthe Travis County bench.     This result need not be attributed to the\n\ninteraction of racial bias with the at-large electoral scheme.           It\n\nis equally likely that the numbers reflect the limited candidate\n\npool.   Plaintiffs can point to only one district court election\n\nthat an Hispanic candidate lost--Gallardo's race in 1988.            Even if\n\nGallardo had prevailed, the percentage of Hispanic judges would not\n\nhave increased, because Gallardo was the one Hispanic sitting\n\nbefore 1988.   While we do not require that any minority candidates\n\nrun for the office in question, the court cannot ignore this\n\nreality while plaintiffs emphasize the absence of minority office\n\nholders.\n\n     Far   from    signalling   the    submergence   of   minority   voting\n\nstrength by an interaction of electoral process and bias, the\n\n\n                                      133\n\fundisputed facts indicate that Travis County's political system is\n\nopen to Hispanic and white candidates alike. Hispanics won half of\n\nthe four exogenous primary elections studied, including races for\n\nthe state    senate,   appellate     courts,    and    Supreme   Court.     The\n\nHispanic-preferred candidate also won all four of the general\n\nelections analyzed by the defendants.          The City of Austin contains\n\nmost of Travis County's population. As this court noted in Overton\n\nv. City of Austin, 871 F.2d 529, 540 (5th Cir. 1989):\n\n     Austin has repeatedly elected black and Mexican-American\n     council members during the past 17 years. . . . [T]he\n     winning minority candidates frequently received well over\n     fifty percent (50%) of the Anglo vote and were also the\n     preferred candidates of the minorities.          Minority\n     candidates have routinely been elected to other posts in\n     Austin and the surrounding Travis County.\n\nLikewise, the defendants here produced evidence that Hispanic\n\ncounty commissioners had been elected from predominantly Anglo\n\ndistricts and won Anglo districts, and that Trevino, a Hispanic\n\nAustin   city   council    member,    had   been      elected    in    city-wide\n\nelections.   Against this background, which includes the success of\n\nstate Senator Barrientos and Justice Gonzalez and other Hispanic-\n\npreferred    candidates,    plaintiffs'        minimal    case    is     plainly\n\ninsufficient to prove illegal vote dilution.             The district court\n\nclearly erred in finding otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n                                     134\n\f                                E. Bexar County\n\n      The voting age population of Bexar County is 672,220.                         Of\n\nthese, 46,767 (7.0%) are black, and 278,577 (41.4%) are Hispanic.\n\nNineteen district judges are elected from Bexar County.                      Of this\n\nnumber, five (26.3%) are Hispanic.              Undisputed evidence shows that\n\n11.4% of     the    eligible    lawyers    in       Bexar    County   are   Hispanic.\n\nPlaintiffs proceed on behalf of Hispanic voters in Bexar County.\n\n      Plaintiffs and defendants analyzed the six district court\n\ngeneral elections with Hispanic candidates between 1982 and 1988.\n\nDefendants also studied a 1980 general election with an Hispanic\n\ncandidate, as well as two appellate court and three county court\n\ngeneral elections with either Hispanic or black candidates.                       As in\n\nevery other county, Hispanics voted cohesively for the Democratic\n\ncandidate while a majority of Anglos supported the Republican\n\ncandidate.\n\n      In    the    twelve    judicial   elections          studied,   the   Hispanic-\n\npreferred     Democratic      candidate    won       four    times,    33.3%.      The\n\nRepublican candidate usually won the general election, and always\n\nwon   the   Anglo    vote,    regardless       of    the    candidate.      The   four\n\nDemocratic victories were:              (1) the 1980 appellate court race\n\nbetween Murry and Esquivel; (2) the 1980 district court race\n\nbetween Prado and Priest; (3) the 1988 district court race between\n\nBowles and Mireles; and (4) the 1988 county court race between\n\nPatterson and Canales.         Priest, an Anglo Democrat, beat Prado, an\n\nHispanic Republican, while Esquivel, Mireles, and Canales, all\n\nHispanic Democrats, defeated their Anglo Republican opponents.\n\n\n                                         135\n\f     Partisan affiliation does not explain, however, the voting\n\npatterns in Democratic primary elections.                    By defendants' own\n\nevidence of Democratic primaries in Bexar County, the Hispanic-\n\npreferred candidate lost in nine of fourteen elections, prevailing\n\nonly 35.7% of the time, when Anglo Democrats voted for the Hispanic\n\ncandidate's    Anglo   opponent.        Anglo    support      for    the    Hispanic\n\ncandidate was seldom above 30% and as low as 1%--whereas the\n\nHispanic vote for the Hispanic-preferred, and always Hispanic,\n\ncandidate   was   above    70%    for    five    of   the     nine   unsuccessful\n\ncandidates.    Plaintiffs' as well as defendants' experts agreed,\n\nhowever, that primary elections do not provide a reliable guide\n\nwhere, as here, both parties are competitive, since they involve\n\nonly a fraction of the electorate.\n\n     Partisan affiliation accounts for much of the voting patterns\n\nanalyzed by the parties.         Most Anglo voters are Republicans; most\n\nHispanic voters are Democrats.            Anglo voters gave a majority of\n\ntheir votes to Republicans, and Hispanic voters gave a majority of\n\ntheir votes to Democrats, even when Hispanic Republican candidates\n\nfaced Anglo Democratic opponents.               Prado and Barrera, Hispanic\n\nRepublicans, won 70% and 86% of the Anglo vote respectively, when\n\nrunning   against   Anglo   Democratic         opponents      who    received     the\n\noverwhelming majority of the Hispanic vote.             Any proof of dilution\n\nis meager at best and cannot overcome Texas' substantial linkage\n\ninterest as a matter of law.\n\n     Because    Hispanic    voters      make    up    more    than    41%    of   the\n\npopulation, they can elect Democratic candidate with minimal Anglo\n\n\n                                        136\n\fsupport and have done so repeatedly.                      The minority-preferred\n\ncandidate won four out of twelve elections in which an Hispanic\n\ncandidate participated--33.3% of the time--with as little as 17% of\n\nthe Anglo vote.        Hispanic voters are plainly a potent political\n\nforce that can elect candidates by forming coalitions with small\n\npercentages of Anglo voters.            If Bexar County were subdistricted,\n\nHispanic    voters     might    elect    a     few   more   of    their   preferred\n\ncandidates, but only at the expense of losing their influence over\n\nthe majority of Bexar County judges.                 The perversity of such a\n\nresult is self-evident.\n\n     Finally, the evidence that elections were affected by racial\n\npolitics preventing the formation of such coalitions is thin.                    It\n\nconsisted    solely      of    (1)   evidence        of     low   Hispanic   voter\n\nregistration; (2) the usual enhancing factors present in every\n\nTexas county--anti-single shot voting and the majority runoff\n\nrequirement; and (3) the fact that Hispanic judges occupy five of\n\nnineteen district judgeships--26.3% of the total--while Hispanics\n\nmake up 41.4% of Bexar County's voting age population.                    Again, we\n\nnote that Hispanic attorneys make up only 11.4% of the eligible\n\nbar, so that the representation of lawyers on the bench is actually\n\nhigher than would be produced by random selection from the pool of\n\neligible candidates.           This evidence, even if probative in the\n\nabstract, is as meager as the evidence in Harris County.\n\n     The evidence compels the conclusion that any dilution was\n\nmarginal and cannot as a matter of law survive the weighing of the\n\ntotality    of   the   circumstances         when    Texas'   substantial     state\n\n\n                                         137\n\finterest is added to the mix.        If Texas' linkage interest does not\n\noutweigh this evidence of dilution, the state's interest would be\n\na nullity.    We hold that plaintiffs' proof fails in Bexar County as\n\na matter of law.\n\n                           F. Jefferson County\n\n     Eight district judges are elected from Jefferson County.            The\n\nrecord shows that no black judge was elected there between 1985 and\n\n1989.41      Expert    evidence    establishes     that   fourteen   eligible\n\nattorneys in Jefferson County, 3.1% of the qualified bar, are\n\nblack.    The voting age population of Jefferson County is 179,708.\n\nOf this number, 44,283 (24.6%) are black.            Plaintiffs proceed on\n\nbehalf of black voters in Jefferson County.\n\n     Taebel testified that Jefferson County is the most Democratic\n\nof the targeted counties, with 90% of its voters participating in\n\nthe Democratic primary.           Brischetto analyzed eight primary and\n\nrunoff    elections,    including    the    1988   Democratic   presidential\n\nprimary.   Taebel analyzed six exogenous elections involving either\n\nblack or Hispanic candidates:           four primaries and two general\n\nelections.     Unlike their other studies, Brischetto and Taebel\n\nanalyzed totally different elections.\n\n     In all but one of the primary elections studied by Brischetto,\n\nthe black vote was cohesive.         In one case, the candidate with the\n\n     41\n      Since trial, district judges in Jefferson County have\nfiled an amicus brief requesting judicial notice that Davis, an\nAfrican-American, was elected to the county court in 1990. The\namicus brief also notes that black Democrat Overstreet and\nHispanic Democrat Morales won a majority of the county's votes in\ntheir respective 1990 races for Court of Criminal Appeals and\nAttorney General.\n\n                                      138\n\fgreatest black support received a high plurality (47%) of the black\n\nvote.       A majority of white voters always opposed the black-\n\npreferred candidate in the primary elections.\n\n      Whether       the    black-preferred     candidate      was   consistently\n\ndefeated by a white bloc is a close question.                 The answer varies\n\nwith the elections counted and how they are counted.                    Defendants\n\npoint to four primaries.           In two elections, black candidate Price\n\nwon the nomination for state representative.                 In two others, for\n\nSupreme     Court    and   Court    of   Criminal    Appeals,   black-preferred\n\nHispanic candidates Gonzalez and Martinez participated.                  Gonzalez\n\nwon   the    Jefferson     County    Democratic      vote;   Martinez    did   not.\n\nDefendants also rely on two exogenous general elections, for\n\nSupreme Court and Attorney General, involving Hispanic candidates\n\nGonzalez, a Democrat, and Barrera, a Republican.                In both general\n\nelections, the black-preferred candidate--Gonzalez and Mattox,\n\nBarrera's Democratic opponent--prevailed.\n\n      Plaintiffs offer five indigenous primaries, ranging back to\n\n1972, in which black candidates participated--four for justice of\n\nthe peace and one for county court.                  They also submitted the\n\nexogenous 1988 presidential primary.                Among these six races, the\n\nblack-preferred candidate prevailed only once, when Jackson won a\n\nplurality in the 1988 presidential primary.\n\n      The total of eight elections analyzed by Brischetto includes\n\nboth the initial primaries and subsequent runoffs for justice of\n\nthe peace in 1972 and 1974.              In the initial primaries, black-\n\npreferred candidate Freeman failed to win the highest plurality.\n\n\n                                         139\n\fPlaintiffs would count these results as \"defeats\" separate from\n\nFreeman's subsequent defeat in the runoffs.            Freeman won, however,\n\nthe second highest number of votes in the initial primaries and\n\nthus made those runoffs.        We do not consider Freeman's showings in\n\nthe initial primaries to be separate from the runoff elections.\n\nThus, the record reflects four justice of the peace elections, not\n\nsix.\n\n       Unlike Tarrant County, defendants' evidence does not include\n\nestimates of how Hispanic residents in Jefferson County voted.\n\nThere are no facts showing that Hispanic and black voters were\n\npolitically cohesive in Jefferson County. Anglo-Hispanic elections\n\nare entitled to less weight than white-black races in determining\n\nthe success of black-preferred candidates.\n\n       Nonetheless,       confining   our    consideration    to   the   analyzed\n\nelections in which black candidates participated, we must conclude\n\nthat the plaintiffs failed to prove a substantial case of dilution.\n\nThe plaintiffs and defendants together produced evidence of eight\n\nprimary elections in which a black who was also the black-preferred\n\ncandidate participated.         The black-preferred candidate won three\n\nprimaries out of these eight elections--a success rate of 37.5%.\n\nAll    three   of   the    black-preferred      candidates'    victories    were\n\nexogenous:     Jackson won the 1988 presidential primary, while Price\n\nwon two Democratic primaries for state representative.\n\n       As in every county but Dallas, the district court found no\n\nsign of racial appeals.          Likewise, there is no finding of non-\n\nresponsiveness on the part of elected officials to the concerns of\n\n\n                                       140\n\fblack   constituents.          Enhancing      factors     as   well      as     past\n\ndiscrimination were shown, but--as elsewhere--were not brought home\n\nto this case.     The minority-preferred candidate prevailed in every\n\ngeneral election submitted by the parties.\n\n     The plaintiffs' case was further weakened by their use of\n\ndated statistics:         three of the five indigenous elections they\n\nsubmitted were held in 1972, 1974, and 1978.            There is no evidence\n\nof a practical and searching appraisal of contemporary conditions\n\nin Jefferson County.       See Nipper v. Chiles, 795 F. Supp. 1525, 1540\n\n(M.D.   Fla.    1992)    (noting   limited    probative     force   of    \"stale\"\n\nelections).\n\n     We have here no more than marginal proof of illegal vote\n\ndilution.      The evidence is inadequate to prove that black voters\n\nwere denied an equal opportunity to participate in the political\n\nprocess.    It is too insubstantial to survive a weighing of the\n\ntotality of circumstances when the state's substantial linkage\n\ninterest is added to the mix.          As a matter of law, the state's\n\ninterest outweighs this case.\n\n                              G. Midland County\n\n     Midland County contains 82,636 voting age residents, of whom\n\n6,893 (11.9%) have Spanish surnames and 4,484 (7.8%) are black.\n\nThere are      three    district   judges    in   Midland   County;      none    are\n\nHispanic or black.       Undisputed evidence shows that seven Hispanic\n\nand three black attorneys are eligible for district judgeships.\n\nThey comprise 3.2% of the lawyers eligible to run for that office.\n\n\n\n\n                                      141\n\fPlaintiffs proceed on behalf of both Hispanic and black voters in\n\nMidland County.\n\n     Plaintiffs analyzed three general elections in Midland County.\n\nTwo of them were exogenous races for the Texas Supreme Court.              The\n\nthird was an indigenous race involving a black candidate for a\n\nJustice of   the   Peace   position    in   1986.        Defendants   likewise\n\nexamined Gonzalez's bids for the Supreme Court in 1986 and 1988, as\n\nwell as four primary elections in which either a black or Hispanic\n\ncandidate participated.       Defendants also analyzed the Mattox-\n\nBarrera race for Texas Attorney General.\n\n     Both parties' analyses show that the majority of Anglo voters\n\nalways   opposed   the   candidate    preferred     by   the   geographically\n\ncompact and cohesive combined minority population in the general\n\nelections. The minority-preferred candidate was always defeated by\n\nthis Anglo majority.\n\n     We conclude that the district court clearly erred in finding\n\ndilution. The undisputed facts indicate that partisan affiliation,\n\nnot race, caused the defeat of the minority-preferred candidate.\n\nThe majority of minority voters always cast their votes in favor of\n\nthe Democratic candidate.      The Anglo voters cast the majority of\n\ntheir votes for the Republican, regardless of the race of the\n\ncandidates. Indeed, Barrera, the Hispanic Republican candidate for\n\nAttorney General, won 76% of the Anglo vote when running against\n\nMattox, a white Democrat--the second highest vote received by any\n\nof the Republicans in the analyzed general elections.                  Because\n\nRepublican voters outnumbered Democratic voters, the minority-\n\n\n                                     142\n\fpreferred Democratic candidate consistently lost.                  The plaintiffs\n\nhave not established the third prerequisite of Gingles.\n\n     Even if plaintiffs could meet the Gingles threshold, the\n\ntotality of circumstances does not add up to dilution.                          The\n\nplaintiffs can show only a general history of discrimination and a\n\nlack of minority judges.           These facts prove little.           In Midland\n\nCounty, only one minority lawyer has run for local office (county\n\nattorney), and none has ever run for a district judgeship.                    These\n\nlow numbers reflect the minuscule number of eligible minority\n\ncandidates.     According to the evidence, only ten minority lawyers\n\nare eligible to run for the district court seat.\n\n     Because the undisputed facts show that partisan affiliation\n\nuninfected     by     racial     politics        caused   the   minority-preferred\n\ncandidates' defeat, we hold that the district court erred in\n\nfinding dilution.\n\n                                 H. Lubbock County\n\n     Lubbock        County     residents     vote     for   five   district   court\n\npositions.     None of these five judges are black or Hispanic.                The\n\nsurveys introduced by the defendants indicate that 23 Hispanic\n\nlawyers in Lubbock County are eligible to run for the district\n\ncourt.   The surveys show that no black residing in the county is\n\neligible to do so.       The total voting age population is 150,714.             Of\n\nthis number, 22,934 (15.2%) have Spanish surnames and 9,509 (6.4%)\n\nare black.     Plaintiffs proceed on behalf of the combined Hispanic\n\nand black voters in Lubbock County.\n\n\n\n\n                                           143\n\f      None of the parties analyzed indigenous elections in Lubbock\n\nCounty; no minority has ever run for a position on the district\n\ncourt.       Plaintiffs   analyzed        two   exogenous   primaries     and    two\n\nexogenous general elections, for the Supreme Court and for the\n\nCourt of Criminal Appeals. Defendants studied the same two general\n\nelections,     adding   an    exogenous     general     election    for   Attorney\n\nGeneral.\n\n      Plaintiffs' and defendants' evidence shows that blacks and\n\nHispanics tend to vote cohesively.              There is also no dispute that\n\nthe majority of Anglo voters did not support the candidate favored\n\nby the minority voters in Lubbock County in any of the elections\n\nstudied.\n\n      As in Dallas and Midland Counties, however, the undisputed\n\nfacts show that, in general elections, partisan affiliation and not\n\nracial politics caused the consistent defeat of the minority-\n\npreferred, always Democratic, candidates.               The data indicate that,\n\nin   these    counties,      over   60%    of   white   voters     supported    the\n\nRepublican candidate, while most minority voters supported the\n\nDemocratic candidate.          As a result of this voting pattern, the\n\nDemocratic and minority-preferred candidate consistently lost to a\n\nRepublican opponent, regardless of the ethnicity of the candidates.\n\n      In the 1986 and 1988 races for the Supreme Court, Hispanic\n\nDemocrat Gonzalez lost Lubbock County's vote to white Republican\n\nopponents.     However, in the contest for Attorney General, Barrera,\n\nan Hispanic Republican, defeated Mattox, a white Democrat.                      Like\n\nGonzalez's Republican opponents, Barrera took a majority of the\n\n\n                                          144\n\fAnglo votes, while his white opponent took a majority of the\n\nminority votes.       In short, as in Midland County, the evidence\n\nestablishes that voting patterns in Lubbock County were unaffected\n\nby the race of the candidates.           Rather, they resulted from party\n\nloyalty.     Therefore, plaintiffs have not met the third Gingles\n\nfactor.\n\n     The plaintiffs point to two exogenous Democratic primary\n\nelections    for    state   appellate     and    Supreme   Court    positions.42\n\nHowever, the minority-preferred candidate won a majority of the\n\nvotes cast in one of these two elections.             Although Martinez was\n\ndefeated, Gonzalez won a majority of the votes cast in the Lubbock\n\nCounty Democratic primary for the Supreme Court.                These primary\n\nraces, therefore, do not indicate that the minority-preferred\n\ncandidate was consistently defeated within the meaning of Gingles,\n\nand they cannot establish dilution.\n\n                               I. Ector County\n\n     There are four district judges in Ector County.                All of them\n\nare Anglo.     There are fewer than 200 lawyers in the county.\n\nSurveys estimate that no more than six of them are black or\n\nHispanic and eligible to become district judges.                Ector County,\n\nwhose principal city is Odessa, has 79,516 voting age residents.\n\n14,147    (17.8%)    are    Hispanic,    while    3,255    (4.1%)   are   black.\n\n\n     42\n      As we stated in the discussion of Jefferson County, supra\nPart VI.F, we hold that the runoff election subsequent to a\nprimary election is a single election for the purposes of\ncomputing the success or failure of the minority-preferred\ncandidate. The victor of the runoff election is the victor of\nthe combined primary/runoff race.\n\n                                        145\n\fPlaintiffs proceed on behalf of the combined minority population in\n\nEctor County.\n\n     The parties relied on the same exogenous races in Ector County\n\nthat they produced in Lubbock County.                The plaintiffs examined\n\nprimary   and     general    elections     for    appellate    courts    involving\n\nMartinez and Gonzalez.           The defendants added Barrera's bid for\n\nAttorney General.\n\n     The undisputed facts indicate that the minority-preferred,\n\nDemocratic      candidates      were   consistently      defeated      in   general\n\nelections    by    an   Anglo    majority       voting   for   their    Republican\n\nopponents. In the Democratic primaries, Martinez won a majority of\n\nthe vote.         The   minority-preferred       candidate     won   half   of   the\n\nDemocratic      primary     races   and    therefore     was   not    consistently\n\ndefeated in the primaries.\n\n     As in Lubbock County on virtually identical facts, we find\n\nthat the district court clearly erred in finding racial vote\n\ndilution.    The undisputed facts indicate that partisan affiliation\n\ncontrolled the outcomes of the general elections.                    As in Lubbock\n\nCounty, while Hispanic Democratic candidates lost the Anglo vote,\n\nBarrera, a Hispanic Republican, won a majority of the Anglo vote\n\nrunning against his white Democratic opponent Mattox.\n\n     While partisan affiliation would not explain polarization in\n\nthe primaries, the facts indicate that the minority-preferred\n\ncandidate was not consistently defeated by racial polarization in\n\nthe primary elections.          Rather, Martinez won one of the two races\n\n\n\n\n                                          146\n\fanalyzed. Plaintiffs have failed to meet the third prerequisite of\n\nGingles.\n\n                                VII. Conclusion\n\n      We would expect over time that the Texas judiciary would\n\nreflect the black and Hispanic population eligible to serve--if\n\njudges, for example, were drawn from a pool of all persons eligible\n\nto serve.      In truth, minority lawyers fare better than we would\n\nexpect from a random process.             We do not suggest that because they\n\nfare better than they would in a system of random selection, voting\n\nrights of blacks and Hispanics could not have been illegally\n\ndiluted.      Rather, the observation is relevant because it brings\n\nperspective to this battle by drawing borders around its asserted\n\nimplications and deflating overdrawn invocations of large wrongs of\n\nhistory, unremedied and unanswered.\n\n      There is no disparity between the number of minority judges\n\nand the number of minorities eligible to serve.                 Rather, the only\n\ndisparity     is     between   the   minority      population      and    minorities\n\neligible to serve as judges.               Much can be said about that--of\n\ndeficits in education and other social shortchangings of black and\n\nHispanic persons.         To those who push judicial entry onto this\n\nlarger field we must answer that our task is more narrowly drawn--\n\nto   decide    if    voting    rights     have   been    denied.     We    lack   the\n\nauthority, even if we had the wisdom, to do more.                         The Voting\n\nRights Act is not an unbridled license--to explore for example the\n\npersistent     low    enrollment     of    black   law   students.        One   small\n\nexample.      This year the law school at Louisiana State University\n\n\n                                          147\n\fgraduated the largest number of black students in its history.\n\nThis followed intensive recruiting efforts including the inducement\n\nof   a free   education--with     stipends.      Of   the   several   hundred\n\nstudents graduated, ten were black. This sad story can be repeated\n\nat school after school.      We are told that this is not relevant.          We\n\nthink that it is.\n\n       We decline to reach for social questions beyond the Voting\n\nRights Act by recasting its meaning and purpose.             Ultimately, we\n\ncannot escape the steely truth that we cannot arrive at sound\n\nanswers if we fail to ask the right questions.         We think that today\n\nwe have asked the correct questions and answered them as best we\n\ncan.\n\n       REVERSED\n\nJONES, Circuit Judge, with whom JOLLY, SMITH, BARKSDALE and DeMOSS,\nCircuit Judges, join in concurring in majority opinion:\n\n            Judge Higginbotham's excellent opinion resolves all but\n\none of the issues in dispute between the parties, and I am pleased\n\nto concur in it as far as it goes.         The single issue that I believe\n\nshould have been discussed is whether different racial or language\n\nminority groups may be permitted to aggregate their strength in\n\norder to pursue a Section 2 vote dilution claim.            Permitting such\n\na black/Hispanic coalition claim was vital to plaintiffs' success\n\nin three counties in this case.             The issue was preserved for\n\nappeal, albeit as an aside to the all-pervasive issues;43 it\n\n\n      43\n            Although the en banc majority opinion adopts the minority\ncoalition theory for certain aspects of its analysis, those points are not\nessential to its result and simply demonstrate that the plaintiffs' own\narguments are self-contradictory.\n\n                                     148\n\ffurnishes an alternate ground of decision in the three counties.\n\nI believe the en banc court should lay to rest the minority\n\ncoalition theory of vote dilution claims.44\n\n           Congress did not authorize the pursuit of Section 2 vote\n\ndilution claims by coalitions of distinct ethnic and language\n\nminorities.    What Congress did not legislate, this court cannot\n\nengraft onto the statute.      Except in two eccentric decisions from\n\nTexas, the coalition theory has found no factual support anywhere\n\nelse in the federal courts.       The crucial problem inherent in the\n\nminority coalition theory, articulated by Judge Higginbotham and\n\nrealized in this case, is that it transforms the Voting Rights Act\n\nfrom a statute that levels the playing field for all races to one\n\nthat forcibly     advances   contrived    interest-group    coalitions    of\n\nracial or ethnic minorities.\n\n           According to customary legal analysis, there should be no\n\nneed to discuss the minority coalition theory of vote dilution\n\nbecause the text of the Voting Rights Act does not support it.           The\n\nAct originally protected only black voters.        When it was amended in\n\n1975 to reach language minorities, the Act then identified four new\n\ncovered groups: persons of Spanish heritage; all American Indians;\n\n\"Asian Americans\" including Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Filipino\n\nAmericans; and Alaskan natives.        42 U.S.C. § 1973(b)(f)(1).       That\n\n\n      44\n            The Supreme Court has acknowledged but not addressed the minority\ncoalition theory. Growe v. Emison, ___ U.S. ___, 113 S. Ct. 1075, 1085\n(1993). Judge Higginbotham has twice advocated en banc consideration of this\nissue. See League of United Latin American Citizens v. Midland I.S.D., 812\nF.2d 1494, 1503-09 (Higginbotham, J. dissenting), aff'd in part on other\ngrounds, 829 F.2d 564 (5th Cir. 1987) (en banc); Campos v. City of Baytown,\nTexas, 849 F.2d 943 (5th Cir. 1988) (Higginbotham, J., dissenting from denial\nof rehearing en banc). In neither case, for procedural reasons, did the court\nacquiesce. I endorse Judge Higginbotham's earlier writings.\n\n                                    149\n\feach of these groups was separately identified indicates that\n\nCongress considered members of each group and the group itself to\n\npossess   homogeneous    characteristics.      By   negative   inference,\n\nCongress did not envision that each defined group might overlap\n\nwith any of the others or with blacks.      See Hunter, The 1975 Voting\n\nRights Act and Language Minorities, 25 Cath. U.L. Rev. 250, 254-57\n\n(1986); Katherine I. Butler and Richard Murray, Minority Vote\n\nDilution Suits and the Problem of Two Minority Groups: Can a\n\n\"Rainbow Coalition\" Claim the Protection of the Voting Rights Act?,\n\n21 Pac. L.J. 619, 624-25 (1990) (hereafter, \"Butler and Murray\").\n\n            The 1982 amendment to Section 2, which codified the\n\n\"results\" test, likewise offers no textual support for a minority\n\naggregation theory.     It speaks only of a \"class of citizens\" and \"a\n\nprotected class.\"       42 U.S.C. § 1973(b).        Had Congress chosen\n\nexplicitly to protect minority coalitions it could have done so by\n\ndefining the \"results\" test in terms of protected classes of\n\ncitizens.   It did not.\n\n            Two arguments have been made for extending the Voting\n\nRights Act to minority coalitions.          First, one appellate panel\n\nstated, without citation or further reasoning, that the Act does\n\nnot prohibit such claims.      Campos v. City of Baytown, Tex., 840\n\nF.2d 1240, 1244 (5th Cir.), reh'g denied, 849 F.2d 943 (5th Cir.\n\n1988), cert. denied, 492 U.S. 905, 109 S. Ct. 3213 (1989).        The Act\n\ndoes not prohibit claims by minorities from the Indian subcontinent\n\neither.   But as Judge Higginbotham pointed out, this is answering\n\nthe wrong question.       The proper question is whether Congress\n\n\n                                  150\n\fintended    to   protect   coalitions.       Campos,    849   F.2d   at   945\n\n(Higginbotham, J. dissenting from denial of reh. en banc).                \"The\n\nfact that both groups are protected does not justify the assumption\n\nthat a new group composed of both minorities is itself a protected\n\ngroup,\" Butler and Murray, supra, at 647.              Judge Higginbotham\n\nexplained the distinction:\n\n            In deciding to protect language minorities,\n            Congress recognized that language and racial\n            minorities share many disabilities.         To\n            assume, however, that a group composed of both\n            minorities is itself a protected minority is\n            an unwarranted extension of congressional\n            intent. A group tied by overlapping political\n            agendas but not tied by the same statutory\n            disability is no more than a political\n            alliance or coalition.\n\n840 F.2d at 945.\n\n            The second argument advanced by a court that permitted a\n\nminority coalition claim under Section 2 begs the question of\n\nstatutory construction altogether.           This position asserts that\n\nbecause a minority coalition may meet the three-prong Gingles test,\n\nincluding    the   criterion    of   the    minority    group's    political\n\ncohesiveness, it may gain relief from vote dilution.45                    This\n\nargument was successful in a Texas case in which, paradoxically,\n\nthe court also acknowledged that Gingles           says nothing about the\n\npossibility of granting relief to minority group coalitions.46\n\n\n\n     45\n            A general citation to Thornburg v. Gingles, the Supreme Court's\ndecision on vote dilution, is superfluous at this point in our court's\nwriting.\n     46\n            Butler and Murray, supra at 642, observe that before the Midland\ncase, blacks and Hispanics had pursued Voting Rights Act cases together, but\nthey had sought separate districts or relief for each minority.\n\n                                     151\n\fPreviously, it had rejected a plan offered by the plaintiffs that\n\ncontained a mixed black/Hispanic district, because it found the\n\ninterests of these two minorities too divergent to justify their\n\nsubmergence in one district.        Nevertheless, it predicated a new,\n\ninexplicably    opposite      finding      on   Gingles'    second   prong   and\n\ndetermined     that   the   coalition      of   blacks     and   Hispanics   was\n\npolitically cohesive.       League of United Latin American Citizens v.\n\nMidland Indep. Sch. Dist., 648 F. Supp. 596, 606 (W.D. Tex. 1986).47\n\nAgain, Judge Higginbotham noted the court's error in purporting to\n\nrely on Gingles:\n\n           [Gingles'] three-step inquiry assumes a group\n           unified by race or national origin and asks if\n           it is cohesive in its voting. If a minority\n           group lacked common race or ethnicity,\n           cohesion must rely primarily on shared values,\n           socioeconomic    factors,     and    coalition\n           formation,    making    the    group    almost\n           indistinguishable from political minorities as\n           opposed to racial minorities.\n\nMidland, 812 F.2d at 1504.        Reliance on Gingles is false because\n\nGingles does not address the meaning of or solution to vote\n\ndilution of a minority coalition.\n\n\n\n\n     47\n           The court's finding on political cohesiveness was supported only\nby this:\n           . . . Blacks and Hispanics worked together and formed\n           coalitions when their goals were compatible.\n           Additionally, the bringing of this lawsuit provides\n           evidence that blacks and Hispanics have common\n           interests that induce the formation of coalitions.\n           Id.\n            Butler and Murray term \"shocking\" the court's reliance only on the\nfacts that suit has been brought jointly and that the minority groups are\nwilling to work together to accomplish \"compatible\" goals. Butler and Murray,\nsupra at 667.\n\n\n                                     152\n\f            A   principal     reason    for    distinguishing          homogeneous,\n\nexplicitly defined minority groups from minority coalitions lies in\n\nSection 2 itself.      One may be uncertain what Congress might think\n\nabout   permitting     minority      coalitions    to    assert    vote     dilution\n\nclaims, but     Congress     clearly    walked    a     fine   line    in   amending\n\nSection 2 to codify the results test for vote dilution claims while\n\nexpressly prohibiting proportional representation for minority\n\ngroups.    The results test of vote dilution inherently recognizes\n\nthat a minority group will sometimes fail to merit a single member\n\ndistrict solely because they lack the population to \"constitute a\n\nmajority in a single member district.\"            Gingles, ___ U .S. ___, 106\n\nS.   Ct.   at   2766   and   n.17.      Permitting       Section      2   claims   by\n\nopportunistic minority coalitions, however, artificially escapes\n\nthis hurdle.     As a result, the remedy afforded to the coalition may\n\neasily cross the line from protecting minorities against racial\n\ndiscrimination to the prohibited, and possibly unconstitutional,\n\ngoal of mandating proportional representation.48\n\n            The tension in Section 2 between the results test and the\n\nprohibition      of     proportional         representation           fundamentally\n\n\n      48\n            The Midland case illustrates this point.       The district court\napproved a \"remedy\"\n            in the form of the best available single member\n            district to each of the two groups, even though\n            neither could satisfy [Gingles'] requirements of size\n            and compactness. . . . Ironically, Section 2, which\n            specifically disavows a right to proportional\n            representation, was used to provide greater than\n            proportional representation for two groups, neither of\n            whom would have qualified for a seat had proportional\n            representation actually been the law.\nButler and Murray, supra, 667-68 (emphasis added).\n\n                                       153\n\fdistinguishes this case from Chisom v. Roemer, ___ U.S. ___, 111 S.\n\nCt. 2354 (1991), in which the Supreme Court concluded that judicial\n\nelections are covered by Section 2.          Stating that certain types of\n\nelections are within Section 2 is a definitional exercise.                   In\n\nChisom, the Court held that judicial elections, having once been\n\ncovered by the Act, remained covered following the 1982 amendment\n\nto Section 2.      But it is a remedial exercise to decide whether to\n\napply the results test to a minority coalition united not by race\n\nor language but only by their desire to advance a particular\n\nagenda.    Enlarging the permissible boundaries of Section 2 relief\n\nto encompass minority coalitions thus runs headlong into the\n\nSection 2 prohibition of proportional representation, creating a\n\nconflict that the Supreme Court did not face in Chisom.\n\n               If Section 2 is held to permit relief for minority\n\ncoalitions, the complications for Voting Rights Act litigation in\n\nour increasingly multi-ethnic society will be enormous.                   Those\n\ncomplications alone imply that Congress rather than the courts\n\nshould first address any such innovation. Certain questions should\n\ngive pause even to the advocates of minority coalitions.              As Judge\n\nHigginbotham observed, the availability of a minority coalition\n\ntheory could be a defense against an attack on an at-large system.\n\nCampos    v.    City   of   Baytown,   Texas,   supra   849   F.2d   at   945-46\n\n(Higginbotham, J.).         Where the combined groups comprise more than\n\nhalf of a voting population in a plausible single-member district,\n\ntheir \"cohesion\" could be used as a device to \"pack\" the minorities\n\ntogether. Further, on what basis would a court apportion districts\n\n\n                                       154\n\fin the wake of a successful minority coalition Section 2 suit?                   If\n\neach minority is given an opportunity to prevail in a district, is\n\nthis not an admission that the coalition is ephemeral and not\n\nreally \"cohesive\" as Gingles requires? Is it possible that greater\n\nracial    animosity     will   develop     if   a   court     permits       minority\n\naggregation on too insubstantial a basis and effectively submerges\n\nmembers of one group in a district controlled by the other group?\n\nCourts should be loath to embark upon coalition redistricting with\n\nno expressed guidance from a statute that reflects the will of the\n\nAmerican people.\n\n            If,   notwithstanding        the    absence      of   Congressional\n\nauthorization,     minority     coalitions      are   permitted        to     assert\n\naggregate Section 2 vote dilution claims, relief must be predicated\n\non more evidence of the group's homogeneity than the maintenance of\n\na joint lawsuit.      See note 5, supra.        This is so for two reasons.\n\nAs noted earlier, if a fortuitous coalition of minorities can gain\n\nSection 2 relief on tenuous proof of cohesion, the courts will have\n\neffectively undone Congress's explicit disapproval of proportional\n\nrepresentation.       The less cohesive the groups truly are, the more\n\nlikely relief has been fashioned only because of the groups' joint\n\nminority status.      Second, there is risk to members of the minority\n\ngroups themselves if their electoral fates are joined even though\n\nthey do not share fundamentally similar social and political goals.\n\nTo   be   sure,   the    problem   of    determining        minority    political\n\ncohesiveness under Gingles may be difficult even when the claims of\n\n\n\n\n                                     155\n\fone minority group are at issue.49              But it should be self-evident\n\nthat the problem is compounded when different minority groups, with\n\nradically       different        cultural       and        language     backgrounds,\n\nsocioeconomic characteristics and experiences of discrimination\n\nseek Section 2 coalition status.                Forcibly merging fundamentally\n\ndifferent       groups     for   the      purpose     of    providing       \"minority\"\n\nrepresentation could be a cruel hoax upon those who are not\n\ncohesive with self-styled minority spokesmen.\n\n            The difficulty of proving vote dilution on behalf of\n\ncoalitions of minorities has been vividly realized in practice.\n\nExcept in the Midland and Campos cases, there appear to be no\n\nreported decisions in which sufficient proof of the minority\n\ncoalition theory was adduced to justify Section 2 relief.                           The\n\ntheory    has    been    litigated     all   over     the    country,   but    it   has\n\nrepeatedly      been     rejected    on   factual     grounds.

Once the courts plunge into the business\n\nof apportioning representation among racial or ethnic coalitions,\n\na host of difficult and potentially divisive social questions rear\n\ntheir heads.     A finding of political cohesiveness should require\n\nsuch coalitions to prove, at the very minimum, not only that they\n\n\n\n     50\n            The court in Nixon looked to the following factors, gleaned from\nthe definition of minority group:\n\n           (1)   Whether the members have similar socioeconomic\n           backgrounds resulting in common social disabilities\n           and exclusion;\n           (2)   whether members have similar attitudes toward\n           significant issues affecting the challenged entity;\n           (3)   whether members have consistently voted for the\n           same candidates; and\n           (4)   whether the minorities consider themselves \"one\"\n           even in situations in which they would benefit\n           independently.\nNixon at 790 F. Supp. 744.\n\n                                     157\n\fusually vote for the preferred candidates of their own ethnic group\n\nbut also for those of the coalition group -- otherwise, the groups\n\ncannot be politically cohesive.         Not only do most of the above-\n\ncited decisions case doubt on such a proposition, but considerable\n\nsociological literature also demonstrates \"social distance\" between\n\nminority groups that seems inconsistent with widespread coalition\n\nminority political cohesion.51\n\n           The second panel opinion in this Lulac case concedes that\n\n           the procedure of allowing Blacks and Hispanics\n           to proceed as a \"coalition\" minority group in\n           a Section 2 claim is fraught with risks.\n\nLulac II, 986 F.2d 785, n.43.       Ironically, while citing the Butler\n\nand Murray article to which I have referred, the panel makes no use\n\nof its cautionary data or its conclusion:\n\n                Proponents of coalition dilution suits\n           argue that minority groups are natural allies\n           because of their shared exclusion from the\n           dominant society, and their similar lower\n           socioeconomic    status,   which,    proponents\n           maintain, is a product of past discrimination.\n           Despite the simplistic logic of this position,\n           it does not comport with the reality revealed\n           by social science studies.       Those studies\n           suggest just the opposite.       The rarity of\n           documented    political    alliances    between\n           minority groups is the natural consequence of\n           differences    in    their     attitudes    and\n           perceptions. Studies indicate that minorities\n           in fact identify more closely with the\n           dominant group than with other minorities.\n           Moreover, perceptions of discrimination vary\n           widely among groups. Blacks, for example, are\n\n\n      51\n            See, e.g., Dyer, Dedlitz and Worochel, Social Distance Among\nRacial and Ethnic Groups in Texas, Some Demographic Correlates, 70 Social\nScience Quarterly 607, 613-14 (1989); Donald L. Horowitz, \"Conflict and\nAccommodation: Mexican Americans Need Cosmopolis\" in Mexican Americans in\nComparative Perspective 58, 84-92 (1985) See also Butler and Murray, supra\nn.7.\n\n                                     158\n\f          much more likely than Mexican Americans to\n          perceive   themselves   to   be  victims   of\n          discrimination. Still other studies suggest\n          that   the  underlying   causes  of   lowered\n          socioeconomic status differ among minority\n          groups. Different root causes of poverty are\n          likely to lead to different, possibly even\n          conflicting, demands on the government.\n\nButler and Murray, supra, 688-89.     Butler and Murray contend that\n\nbecause of these differences, minority coalitions \"very seldom\"\n\nought to be able to prove vote dilution under Section 2.     Butler\n\nand Murray, supra at 687.   The short answer to plaintiffs' joint\n\nSection 2 claims in Lubbock, Ector and Midland Counties is that\n\nthey did not meet their burden of proof that blacks and Hispanics\n\nare sufficiently like a single minority group to entitle the\n\ncoalition to one judicial district in each county.\n\n                            Conclusion\n\n          The Congressional compromise that resulted in the passage\n\nof Section 2 left the field of voting rights wide open to courts in\n\nmany respects. Congress did not, however, contemplate or authorize\n\nrelief for coalitions of racial and language minority groups.    For\n\nthe courts to provide such relief, in my view, judicially amends\n\nthe Act and flies in the face of the express prohibition of\n\nproportional representation in Section 2.    At the very least, only\n\nunder very convincing proof of a minority coalition's sociological\n\nsimilarities and goals as well as its political cohesion can such\n\na claim be made.   In this case, plaintiffs have not carried their\n\nburden of proof concerning Lubbock, Midland or Ector Counties. Our\n\ncourt's previous decisions in Midland and Campos must be overruled.\n\n\n\n                                159\n\fWith these additional observations, I concur in the majority\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\nPOLITZ, Chief Judge, with whom JOHNSON, KING and WIENER, Circuit\n\nJudges, join, dissenting:\n\n\n\n     I respectfully dissent.     The parties have moved for remand of\n\nthis action to the district court for consideration of a proposed\n\nsettlement.      Remarkably, the majority denies that motion despite\n\nthe fact that our jurisprudence long has favored settlement as the\n\npreferred mode of dispute resolution,52 permitting avoidance of\n\nunnecessary monetary and emotional costs and the risks attendant in\n\nall litigation.53     We have long recognized that the parties to an\n\naction \"have a right to compromise their dispute on mutually\n\nagreeable terms.\"54    There is nothing about this action against the\n\n     52\n      Williams v. First Nat'l Bank, 216 U.S. 582, 595 (1910);\nsee also, e.g., Carson v.

In its headlong\n\nrush to reach the merits, the majority suggests no persuasive, much\n\nless compelling, reason for the jettisoning of the preferred manner\n\nof dispute resolution.            I would grant the motion to remand.\n\n     Stripped to essentials, the majority asserts that Attorney\n\nGeneral Morales lacks authority to settle this matter on behalf of\n\nthe State because of the opposition by Chief Justice Phillips and\n\nJudges Entz and Wood.             I find this nothing short of incredible.\n\nThis action challenges the scheme for election of district judges\n\nin Texas.            The real party in interest herein is the State of\n\nTexas.56       As its chief legal officer, the Attorney General \"has\n\nbroad     discretionary         power    in   conducting    his   legal   duty   and\n\nresponsibility to represent the State,\"57 including authority to\n\npropose        and    execute   settlement     agreements    in   reapportionment\n\n\n     55\n      See Chisom v. Edwards, 970 F.2d 1408 (5th Cir. 1992)\n(granting joint motion to remand to effectuate settlement in\nLouisiana voting rights case).\n\n     56\n      The State is the real party in interest in an action\nagainst one of its officials in her official capacity. Will v.\nMichigan Dep't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71 (1989); Kentucky\nv. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 165-66 (1985). The plaintiffs here\nnamed as defendants the Governor of Texas, the Attorney General,\nthe Secretary of State, and the Chief Justice of the Supreme\nCourt as chair of the Judicial Districts Board, all in their\nofficial capacities. In short, the plaintiffs have sued the\nState of Texas.\n     57\n      Terrazas v. Ramirez, 829 S.W.2d 712, 721 (Tex. 1991)\n(citing Tex. Const. art. 4, § 22; Tex. Gov't Code § 402.021;\nfurther citations omitted).\n\fcases.58   That is what the Attorney General seeks to do in this\n\ncase.59 The Attorney General has the active assent of the Governor,\n\nLieutenant Governor, and a majority of both houses of the Texas\n\nLegislature.    Pray tell, what more do we need to accept the\n\nproposed settlement as being made on behalf of the State of Texas?\n\n     That Chief Justice Phillips has voiced an objection does not\n\nalter the certainty that the State of Texas, through its authorized\n\nspokesman, wishes to settle this matter.      As chairman of the\n\nJudicial Districts Board, Chief Justice Phillips has a measure of\n\nauthority over judicial apportionments. We cannot ignore, however,\n\nthat the Board's authority in this area SQ and hence that of the\n\nChief Justice SQ is entirely subject to the will of a majority of\n\n\n\n\n     58\n      Terrazas, 829 S.W.2d at 722; id. at 747 (Mauzy, J.,\ndissenting) (at least seven justices agree that \"[t]he attorney\ngeneral is constitutionally empowered to execute a settlement\nagreement in litigation challenging a legislative redistricting\nplan.\").\n     59\n      The majority also makes much of the fact that the consent\ndecree allows the State of Texas to take actions which would\notherwise be prohibited by state law. I do not think that\nconsideration of the merits of the proposed consent decree is\nappropriate at this juncture. We are a court of errors; the\ndistrict court should have an opportunity to conduct a hearing\nand determine whether to enter the consent decree before we\ndecide the merits of such action.\n     I further note that although courts generally must defer to\nstate apportionment policy in fashioning the remedy for a\nviolation of Section 2, district courts have equitable power to\ndepart from state law if necessary. See, e.g., White v. Weiser,\n412 U.S. 783, 797 (1983) (Constitution and Voting Rights Act\nlimit judicial deference to state apportionment policy). If the\ncourt ultimately concludes that there is a reasonable factual and\nlegal basis for finding such a violation, see City of Miami, 664\nF.2d at 441, the exercise of such powers by way of a consent\ndecree may be appropriate.\n\n                               162\n\fthe legislature60 which has, albeit in a nonbinding fashion, agreed\n\nto the proposed settlement.61   Further, the status of the Chief\n\nJustice in the Texas judiciary does not carry with it the authority\n\nto speak ex cathedra for the state on policy matters affecting the\n\njudiciary which are unrelated to the decisions of specific cases.62\n\n\n     60\n      See Tex. Const. art. 5, § 7a(h) (\"Any judicial\nreapportionment order adopted by the board must be approved by a\nrecord vote of the majority of the membership of both the senate\nand house of representatives before such order can become\neffective and binding.\").\n     61\n      Chief Justice Phillips's limited authority in this area\ndistinguishes the case at bar from Baker v. Wade, 769 F.2d 289\n(5th Cir. 1985) (en banc), heavily relied upon by the majority.\nUnlike the district attorney in that case, who enjoyed specific\nauthority under state law to represent the state and bring\nprosecutions under the statute there at issue, Chief Justice\nPhillips enjoys neither independent authority over judicial\napportionment nor express authority to represent the state.\n     62\n      This proposition applies equally to Judges Entz and Wood.\nFurther, because the proposed consent decree will not affect\ntheir constituencies, Judges Entz and Wood do not gain standing\nto challenge the consent decree because of their status as office\nholders. City of Cleveland, 478 U.S. at 528-29; City of Miami,\n664 F.2d at 447 (\"the parties to litigation are not to be\ndeprived of the opportunity to compose their differences by\nobjections that find no basis in prejudice to the objector\").\nFinally, the majority opines that the status of Judges Entz and\nWood as voters in Harris County somehow clothes them with\nauthority to block a settlement favored by competent state\nauthorities. While the district courts certainly should permit\ninput from such intervenors when considering entry of a consent\ndecree, to accord them what amounts to a veto, as the majority\ndoes, would effectively preclude settlement of any Section 2\nlitigation SQ an absurd and unconscionable result which I refuse\nto embrace. See City of Cleveland, 478 U.S. at 529 (\"[W]hile an\nintervenor is entitled to present evidence and have its\nobjections heard at the hearings on whether to approve a consent\ndecree, it does not have power to block the decree merely by\nwithholding its consent.\"). Extending the majority's analysis\nwould result in any voter being able to block settlement of any\nsuit against the state or one of its subdivisions. That simply\ncannot be. See Apache Bend Apts. v. United States, 987 F.2d 1174\n(5th Cir. 1993) (en banc).\n\n                                163\n\fThat the plaintiffs, probably out of an abundance of caution,\n\njoined the Chief Justice as a defendant in this action should not\n\npreclude settlement. No one may seriously suggest that this voting\n\nrights case could not have progressed to a definitive conclusion\n\nwithout the presence of the Chief Justice. The awesome decision to\n\ndeny parties an opportunity to compromise and settle their case,\n\nmuch less a case as important as that here presented, must be based\n\non a much more solid, indeed a compelling basis.\n\n     I    would   remand    this   case    to     the   district   court      for\n\nconsideration of the proposed consent decree.\n\nKING, Circuit Judge, with whom, POLITZ, Chief Judge, and JOHNSON,\n\nCircuit Judge, join, dissenting:\n\n     The majority ably accomplishes what it set out to do in this\n\ncase:    reach the merits of this appeal so that it can overhaul the\n\nVoting Rights Act.       Indeed, from its initial decision to deny the\n\nmotion to remand filed by the Plaintiffs and the State of Texas, to\n\nits decision to reverse the district court's judgment in each of\n\nthe nine target counties, the majority proceeds with a kind of\n\ndetermination not often seen in a judicial opinion.                Like Chief\n\nJudge Politz, I believe that the parties should be given the\n\nopportunity to settle this case.          I also believe that fidelity to\n\nthe Voting Rights Act requires us to affirm the district court's\n\njudgment in eight of the nine target counties.               Accordingly, I\n\nrespectfully dissent.\n\n     The majority's decision to deny the motion to remand, even\n\nstanding alone,     is    indefensible.      It    demonstrates    a   lack    of\n\n\n                                    164\n\fjudicial restraint and sets a bad precedent.                Under the majority's\n\nreasoning, states and political subdivisions embroiled in section\n\n2 lawsuits must now defend their electoral practices to the bitter\n\nend--unless those practices can be changed in accordance with state\n\nlaw and everyone who is even remotely connected with the lawsuit\n\nagrees to the proposed changes.           Because these circumstances are\n\nunlikely to occur, the majority has effectively ensured that\n\nsection 2 cases will rarely, if ever, be settled.\n\n     In light of the majority's seriously flawed decision on the\n\nmerits of this case, however, its decision to deny the motion to\n\nremand becomes even more indefensible.              In my view, the majority's\n\ndiscussion of the merits--complete with a declaration that blacks\n\nand Hispanics are just two more interest groups and a conclusion\n\nthat blacks and Hispanics are overrepresented on the Texas district\n\ncourt   bench--perhaps     provides      the   best       argument   against   its\n\ndecision to deny the parties' motion to remand this case for a\n\nsettlement    hearing.     In    fact,    it   is    only    after   reading   the\n\nmajority's decision on the merits that one can truly understand why\n\nit denied the motion to remand.          For that reason, I begin with the\n\nmerits.\n\n\n\n                                I.   THE MERITS\n\n     In reversing the district court's judgment, the majority\n\nultimately concludes that the evidence of vote dilution in this\n\ncase is \"marginal\"--too marginal to outweigh the State of Texas'\n\nsubstantial    interests   in    maintaining        the    current   system.    I\n\n\n                                      165\n\fdisagree with this conclusion on two fronts.          First, I reject the\n\nmajority's assertion that the evidence of vote dilution in this\n\ncase is weak.      Under the established analytical framework for\n\nassessing section 2 claims, the Plaintiffs' evidence of vote\n\ndilution is anything but weak; indeed, it is only by changing the\n\nrules that the majority can so characterize the evidence in this\n\ncase.     I also disagree with the majority's determination that the\n\nState of Texas' interests in maintaining its current at-large\n\nelection system are substantial.       In my view, these interests are\n\nlittle more than tenuous and therefore could not outweigh even\n\n\"marginal\" evidence of vote dilution.\n\nA.   The Plaintiffs' Evidence of Vote Dilution:              Overhauling a\n     Congressional Statute\n\n     As explained in my earlier opinion, the evidence of vote\n\ndilution in this case is substantial.         See League of United Latin\n\nAmerican Citizens, Council No. 4434 v. Clements, 986 F.2d 728, 776-\n\n803 (5th Cir. 1993) (LULAC III).63          Had this case been decided\n\nbefore today, the evidence in eight of the nine target counties\n\nwould have pointed unerringly towards a finding of vote dilution.\n\nThis evidence includes:     a geographically compact and politically\n\ncohesive    minority   group;   a   white   bloc   vote   that   is   usually\n\nsufficient to defeat the combined strength of minority and white\n\ncrossover votes; a history of official discrimination against the\n\n\n     63\n        The panel majority opinion contains a fuller discussion\nof many of the issues addressed in this dissent. I have tried to\navoid an overly long dissent in the hope that the reader will\nrefer to the earlier opinion for a more complete treatment of the\nissues.\n\n                                    166\n\fminority    group;     the    lingering       socioeconomic      effects      of\n\ndiscrimination against the minority group; structural mechanisms,\n\nincluding giant election districts, that tend to enhance the\n\ndilutive nature of at-large election schemes; and an appalling lack\n\nof minority representation on the district court bench.\n\n     After today, such evidence will be only \"weak\" evidence of\n\nvote dilution.       This is because the majority has changed the\n\nanalytical framework for analyzing vote dilution claims. Along the\n\nway, the majority has distorted Congressional intent, rejected\n\nSupreme Court precedent, and completely altered the focus of the\n\nsection 2 inquiry.     As a result of the majority's handiwork, the\n\nsection 2 inquiry is no longer a blended one which looks to the\n\n\"past and present reality\" of the local political landscape.               See\n\nS. REP. No. 417, 97th Cong., 2d Sess., at 30 (1982), reprinted in\n\n1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 177, 208 [hereinafter S. REP.].             Rather, it is\n\none that looks only at the present, although paradoxically, not at\n\nreality.\n\n     1.    Altering the Racial Bloc Voting Inquiries\n\n     The most glaring example of the majority's efforts to reshape\n\nthe section 2 inquiry is its redefinition of two closely-related\n\nterms--namely, \"legally significant white bloc voting\" under the\n\nthreshold inquiry of Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30 (1986), and\n\n\"racially polarized voting\" under the totality of circumstances\n\ninquiry.   Before today, these terms have been widely understood by\n\nlower   courts,   as   well   as   by   the   Supreme   Court,    to   have   a\n\ndescriptive meaning--a meaning that is completely in accord with\n\n\n                                    167\n\fsection 2's focus on results.        The majority, choosing to ignore\n\nthis wide consensus, acts as if it is writing on a clean slate.\n\nThat is, the majority acts as if Congress and the Supreme Court\n\nhave not spoken on these issues.      Because I refuse to put on such\n\nblinders, I cannot join the majority's decision to reformulate\n\nthese terms.\n\n            a.   The majority's version of racial bloc voting\n\n       The majority's formulation of \"legally significant white bloc\n\nvoting\" under the Gingles threshold inquiry, as well as its view of\n\nracially polarized or racial bloc voting under the totality of\n\ncircumstances    inquiry,   is   confusing--to   say   the   least.   The\n\nmajority spends some thirty pages at the front of its opinion\n\nexplaining what these two closely related terms require; yet at the\n\nend of the section entitled \"Racial Bloc Voting,\" all the reader\n\nknows is that more is required than showing (a) with regard to\n\nlegally significant white bloc voting, that minority-preferred\n\ncandidates are consistently defeated by a white majority, and (b)\n\nfor racially polarized voting, that minorities and whites vote\n\ndifferently. What more is required the majority does not expressly\n\nsay.\n\n       Make no mistake about the majority opinion in this regard:      it\n\ndoes redefine the terms of legally significant white bloc voting\n\nand racially polarized voting.        To understand exactly what the\n\nmajority \"holds\" with respect to these two terms, however, one must\n\nfirst go back to earlier opinions by Judge Higginbotham and then\n\nread the majority's county-by-county analysis in this opinion.         It\n\n\n                                   168\n\fis only then that the majority's holding becomes comprehensible.\n\nSpecifically,       the   majority     holds      that   to   establish       legally\n\nsignificant       white   bloc   voting     and   racially    polarized       voting,\n\nminority plaintiffs must, at the very least, negate partisan\n\npolitics as an explanatory factor for the consistent defeat of\n\ntheir preferred candidates.          The majority further implies--without\n\ndeciding     the    issue--that       minority      plaintiffs     may    have     to\n\naffirmatively prove racial animus in the electorate to meet their\n\nburden with respect to legally significant white bloc voting and\n\nracially polarized voting.\n\n     The starting point for understanding the majority's vague\n\napproach     to     the    racial     bloc     voting     inquiries      is     Judge\n\nHigginbotham's opinion in Jones v. City of Lubbock, 730 F.2d 233\n\n(5th Cir. 1984) (Higginbotham, J., specially concurring from denial\n\nof rehearing).       This is where he first suggested that racial bloc\n\nvoting requires a showing of racial animus in the electorate.                      He\n\nasserted:\n\n     The [racial bloc voting] inquiry is whether race or\n     ethnicity was such a determinant of voting preference in\n     the rejection of black or brown candidates by a white\n     majority that the at-large district, with its components,\n     denied minority voters effective voting opportunity.\n\nId. at 234.       Judge Higginbotham further questioned whether racial\n\nbloc voting could be demonstrated without the use of a multivariate\n\nregression    analysis,      which,    he    argued,     would   eliminate      other\n\npossible causes of voting behavior--such as campaign expenditures,\n\nparty identification, income, media use measured by cost, religion,\n\n\n\n\n                                        169\n\fname identification, or distance that a candidate lived from any\n\nparticular precinct.        See id. at 234-35.\n\n     The racial animus theme was also present, albeit to a lesser\n\nextent, in Judge Higginbotham's earlier dissenting opinion in this\n\ncase,   where    he    strongly   disagreed   with    the     panel   majority's\n\ndefinition of legally significant white bloc voting and racially\n\npolarized voting.        In particular, he stated that the \"consistent\n\ndefeat\" of minority-preferred candidates could not be \"on account\n\nof race or color,\" as required by section 2, unless it is tied to\n\n\"racial bias in the electorate.\"              LULAC III, 986 F.2d at 846\n\n(Higginbotham, J., dissenting).          This, he further stated, \"is the\n\nheart of section 2.\"        Id.; see also id. at 831 (\"[T]he extent to\n\nwhich voting patterns are attributable to causes other than race is\n\nan integral part of the inquiry into racial bloc voting . . . .\").\n\n     It was also in this dissent, however, that Judge Higginbotham\n\nfirst advocated placing on plaintiffs the burden of \"negating\n\npartisan politics\" in order to show legally significant white bloc\n\nvoting and racially polarized voting.              That is, he appeared to\n\nretreat from his earlier, more rigid position of requiring minority\n\nplaintiffs      to    affirmatively    establish     racial    animus    in   the\n\nelectorate and instead described the plaintiffs' burden as one of\n\nnegating partisan politics.           See LULAC III, 986 F.2d at 834.         At\n\nthat point, he was willing to limit the \"inquiry into racial bloc\n\nvoting to determining whether divergent voting patterns are caused\n\nby partisan differences.\"          Id.; see also id. at 845 (\"Proof of\n\nmajority voting based on party affiliation prevents the showing of\n\n\n                                       170\n\fbloc voting required by Gingles.\").            Thus, Judge Higginbotham's\n\nearlier position in this case was that, where the evidence \"shows\n\nthat divergent voting patterns among white and minority voters are\n\nbest explained by partisan affiliation, . . . plaintiffs have\n\nfailed to establish racial bloc voting.\"         Id. at 833-34.      In short,\n\nhe   would   have   required   minority    plaintiffs   to    show   that   the\n\nconsistent defeat of their preferred candidates was not \"readily\n\nattributable to partisan affiliation.\"          Id. at 834.\n\n      There are still vestiges of Judge Higginbotham's earlier\n\npositions in the majority opinion, although in the front of the\n\nopinion they are only expressed as \"powerful arguments.\"                    The\n\nmajority asserts, on the one hand, that it \"need not hold that\n\nplaintiffs must supply conclusive proof that a minority group's\n\nfailure to elect representatives of its choice is caused by racial\n\nanimus in the electorate in order to decide that the district\n\ncourt's judgment must be reversed.\" Majority Opinion at 57-58. It\n\nnotes, however, that a racial animus requirement could readily be\n\ninferred from the text and legislative history of section 2, as\n\nwell as Supreme Court precedent.       See id. at 58.      The majority also\n\nasserts that there is \"a powerful argument supporting a rule that\n\nplaintiffs[,]       to   establish   legally    significant     racial      bloc\n\nvoting[,] must prove that their failure to elect representatives of\n\ntheir choice cannot be characterized as a `mere euphemism for\n\npolitical defeat at the polls.'\"           Id. at 58-59.     In this regard,\n\nthe majority explains that \"[d]escribing plaintiffs' burden in\n\nterms of negating `partisan politics' rather than affirmatively\n\n\n                                     171\n\fproving    `racial     animus'   would     not    be   simply   a   matter   of\n\nnomenclature.\"    Id. at 59.      It notes:      \"A rule conditioning relief\n\nunder § 2 upon proof of the existence of racial animus in the\n\nelectorate would require plaintiffs to establish the absence of not\n\nonly partisan voting, but also all other potentially innocent\n\nexplanations for white voters' rejection of minority-preferred\n\ncandidates.\"     Id.\n\n     Ultimately, however, the majority purports not to resolve the\n\ndebate between Judge Higginbotham's two earlier positions. Whether\n\nthe plaintiffs' burden of proving bloc voting includes the burden\n\nof demonstrating racial animus in the electorate, or only the\n\nburden of negating partisan politics, we are told, \"the result is\n\nthe same.\"     Id. at 61.        The district court's judgment must be\n\nreversed, according to the majority, \"[b]ecause the evidence in\n\nmost instances unmistakably shows that divergent voting patterns\n\namong white and minority voters are best explained by partisan\n\naffiliation\"--thus leaving the Plaintiffs unable to \"establish\n\nracial bloc voting.\"      See id. at 64.\n\n     That the majority has reformulated the concepts of legally\n\nsignificant white bloc voting and racially polarized voting becomes\n\ncrystal clear in its application of the law to each county.                  In\n\nDallas County, for example, the majority holds that the plaintiffs\n\nhave not satisfied the third Gingles threshold requirement.                  It\n\nreasons:\n\n          The evidence in Dallas County clearly establishes\n     that judicial elections are decided on the basis of\n     partisan voting patterns.     We are left with the\n     inescapable conclusion that plaintiffs have failed to\n\n                                     172\n\f     prove that minority-preferred judicial candidates in this\n     county are consistently defeated by racial bloc voting.\n     This is a failure to meet the threshold showing required\n     by Gingles.\n\nId. at 106-07.   The majority makes similarly explicit holdings in\n\nMidland, Lubbock, and Ector counties.      See id. at 141-42 (holding\n\nthat, because partisan affiliation, not race, caused the defeat of\n\nthe minority-preferred   candidate    in   Midland   County   elections,\n\n\"[t]he plaintiffs have not established the third prerequisite of\n\nGingles.\"); id. at 144 (concluding that plaintiffs have not met the\n\nthird Gingles factor because the evidence establishes that the\n\nvoting patterns in Lubbock County resulted from party loyalty, not\n\nrace); id. 145-46 (\"Plaintiffs have failed to meet the third\n\nprerequisite of Gingles\" because the \"undisputed facts indicate\n\nthat partisan affiliation controlled the outcomes of the general\n\nelections.\"). Moreover, in Harris and Bexar counties, the majority\n\nstrongly suggests that, because election outcomes appeared to\n\nresult from partisan politics, the Plaintiffs could not establish\n\nlegally significant white bloc voting.64\n\n     64\n       In reversing the district court's findings of legally\nsignificant white bloc voting in the various counties, the\nmajority relies on trivariate regression analyses submitted by\nthe State of Texas and Judge Wood in this case--analyses which\nunquestionably demonstrated that a candidate's partisan\naffiliation was a better predictor of electoral success than a\ncandidate's race. The majority does not remand this case to the\ndistrict court for consideration of the statistics under the new\nlegal standards for racial bloc voting--as might be expected\nunder Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U.S. 273, 292 (1982) (where\ndistrict court's factual finding is based upon a misapprehension\nof law, \"a remand is the proper course unless the record permits\nonly one resolution of the factual issue\"). Rather, the majority\nconcludes that the voting statistics in this case are capable of\nonly one interpretation--an interpretation that is severely\nflawed. See infra Part I.A.1.b(ii).\n\n                                173\n\f     Thus,    although             the    majority's     \"holding\"       with    respect    to\n\nlegally significant white bloc voting and racially polarized voting\n\nis confused and elusive--a paradigm of \"fluidity and fixity,\" see\n\nMajority Opinion at 56--it is nonetheless a holding:                                  Minority\n\nplaintiffs must now establish, at a minimum, that the racially\n\ndivergent     voting         which       consistently        defeats     their       preferred\n\ncandidates is not the result of partisan politics.                          Moreover, the\n\nmajority hints that the plaintiffs' burden in this regard may even\n\nbe higher.        That is, minority plaintiffs may have to demonstrate\n\nthat racially divergent voting patterns are due to racial animus in\n\nthe electorate in order to meet their burden under the legally\n\nsignificant       white       bloc       voting    and   racially        polarized     voting\n\ninquiries.\n\n             b.     Problems with the majority's version of racial bloc\n                    voting\n\n     There are grave problems with the majority's approach(es) to\n\nlegally    significant             white    bloc    voting    and    racially        polarized\n\nvoting.       From       a     purely       legal      perspective,       the    majority's\n\nreformulation       of       the    terms    simply      cannot     be   supported.        The\n\nmajority's        approach         is     also     flawed    from    a    social      science\n\nperspective. More importantly, however, the reformulation of these\n\nterms essentially eviscerates section 2 of the Voting Rights Act--\n\nat least in the context of partisan elections.\n\n                                    (i)     Legal problems\n\n     The     majority         asserts        that      its   definitions        of     legally\n\nsignificant white bloc voting and racially polarized voting are\n\n\n\n                                                 174\n\frequired by the language and legislative history of section 2, as\n\nwell as Supreme Court precedent.   I disagree.\n\n     This being a question of statutory interpretation, I turn\n\nfirst to the language of section 2.     That section provides, in\n\npertinent part:\n\n     (a)   No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting\n           or standard, practice, or procedure shall be\n           imposed or applied by any State or political\n           subdivision in a manner which results in a denial\n           or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the\n           United States to vote on account of race or color,\n           or in contravention of the guarantees set forth in\n           section 1973b(f)(2) of this title, as provided in\n           subsection (b) of this section.\n\n     (b)   A violation of subsection (a) of this section is\n           established   if,   based   on  the   totality   of\n           circumstances, it is shown that the political\n           processes leading to nomination or election in the\n           State or political subdivision are not equally open\n           to participation by members of a class of citizens\n           protected by subsection (a) of this section in that\n           its members have less opportunity to participate in\n           the political process and to elect representatives\n           of their choice. The extent to which members of a\n           protected class have been elected to office in the\n           State or political subdivision is one circumstance\n           which may be considered: Provided, That nothing in\n           this section establishes a right to have members of\n           a protected class in numbers equal to their\n           proportion in the population.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973.\n\n     The language of this section does not, under a straightforward\n\nreading, require minority plaintiffs to \"negate partisan politics\"\n\nor demonstrate current racial animus in the electorate.   The words\n\n\"partisan politics\" appear nowhere in the language of section 2.\n\nAnd although subsection (a) does require a link--a critical link--\n\nbetween the denial or abridgment of the right to vote and \"race or\n\ncolor,\" there is no indication that Congress used the phrase \"on\n\n                                175\n\faccount of race or color\" to require proof of either the absence of\n\npartisan    politics       or    the   presence   of   racial    animus     in   the\n\nelectorate.       In fact, Congress emphasized that it used the phrase\n\n\"`on account of race or color' to mean `with respect to race or\n\ncolor,'     and   not     to    connote   any   required   purpose     of   racial\n\ndiscrimination.\"        S. REP. at 27-28 n.109, 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 205-\n\n06 n.109.\n\n      Nor   does    the    legislative      history    accompanying       the    1982\n\namendments to section 2 offer any real support for the majority's\n\nnew   definition     of    legally     significant     white    bloc   voting    and\n\nracially polarized voting.                In a bit of fancy footwork, the\n\nmajority asserts that, pursuant to the Senate Report accompanying\n\nthe amended section 2, racial bloc voting is established when \"race\n\nis the predominant determinant of political preference.\"                  Majority\n\nOpinion at 48.       The Senate Report says no such thing.              It states\n\nthat, in considering the totality of the circumstances, courts\n\nshould examine \"the extent to which voting in the elections of the\n\nstate or political subdivision is racially polarized.\"                  S. REP. at\n\n29, 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 206.              Several pages later, in a section\n\nentitled \"Responses to Questions Raised About the Results Test,\"\n\nthe Senate Report reads:\n\n           The Subcommittee Report claims that the results test\n      assumes \"that race is the predominant determinant of\n      political preference.\"    The Subcommittee Report notes\n      that in many cases racial bloc voting is not so\n      monolithic, and that minority voters do receive\n      substantial support from white voters.\n           That statement is correct, but misses the point. It\n      is true with respect to most communities, and in those\n      communities, it would be exceedingly difficult for\n      plaintiffs to show that they were effectively excluded\n\n                                          176\n\f     from fair access to the political process under the\n     results test.\n          Unfortunately, however, there still are some\n     communities in our Nation where racial politics do\n     dominate the electoral process.\n          In the context of such racial bloc voting, and other\n     factors, a particular election method can deny minority\n     voters equal opportunity to participate meaningfully in\n     elections.\n\nId. at 33, U.S.C.C.A.N. at 211.              This passage, from which the\n\nmajority lifts its definition of racial bloc voting, simply does\n\nnot define the term.       If anything, the reference to the statement\n\n\"that in many cases racial bloc voting is not so monolithic, and\n\nthat minority voters do receive substantial support from white\n\nvoters\" reinforces my view that the racial bloc voting inquiry\n\nlooks only at the extent to which minorities and whites vote\n\ndifferently.      See infra Part I.A.1.c.\n\n     Even more incredible, however, is the majority's assertion\n\nthat the Supreme Court's definition of legally significant white\n\nbloc voting, as set forth in Justice Brennan's opinion in Gingles,\n\nis still open to question.           Five Justices joined the part of\n\nJustice      Brennan's    opinion   laying     out    the   Gingles   threshold\n\nrequirements--including the requirement that minority plaintiffs\n\n\"must   be    able   to   demonstrate   that    the    white   majority   votes\n\nsufficiently as a bloc to enable it . . . usually to defeat the\n\nminority's preferred candidate.\"             478 U.S. at 51.          Moreover,\n\ncontrary to the majority's assertions otherwise, five Justices also\n\njoined in Part III.B.2. of Justice Brennan's opinion, where he\n\ndefined legally significant white bloc voting as \"a white bloc vote\n\n\n\n\n                                      177\n\fthat normally will defeat the combined strength of minority support\n\nplus white `crossover' votes.\"          Id. at 56.\n\n     Although there was some disagreement over the appropriate\n\nframework for analyzing section 2 claims at the time Gingles was\n\ndecided--specifically, from Justice O'Connor--recent Supreme Court\n\ncases   confirm   that      the   threshold    test    announced   in    Justice\n\nBrennan's    majority    opinion    still     controls.     In    Voinovich   v.\n\nQuilter, 113 S. Ct. 1149, 1157 (1993), Justice O'Connor, writing\n\nfor a unanimous Court, stated:\n\n     In Thornburg v. Gingles, supra, this Court held that\n     plaintiffs claiming vote dilution must prove three\n     threshold conditions. First, they must show that the\n     minority group is sufficiently large and geographically\n     compact to constitute a majority in a single-member\n     district.   Second, they must prove that the minority\n     group is politically cohesive.     Third, the plaintiffs\n     must establish that the white majority votes sufficiently\n     as a bloc to enable it . . . usually to defeat the\n     minority's preferred candidate.\n\n(emphasis    added)     (internal    quotations       omitted)   (ellipsis    in\n\noriginal).    The Court similarly embraced the Gingles threshold\n\ntest, as formulated by Justice Brennan, in Growe v. Emison, 113 S.\n\nCt. 1075, 1084 (1993), another unanimous opinion.\n\n     Thus,    when    the   majority    reformulates      the    third   Gingles\n\nthreshold factor and requires minority plaintiffs to negate the\n\nexistence of partisan politics (or possibly to prove racial animus\n\nin the electorate), it does so in the face of binding Supreme Court\n\nprecedent. Moreover, even assuming that Gingles did not decide the\n\nquestion of what constitutes legally significant white bloc voting\n\nand racially polarized voting, I still cannot agree with the\n\nmajority's rendition of the various opinions in the case.\n\n                                       178\n\f     The   primary    disagreement       in    Gingles   concerned Justice\n\nBrennan's statement that \"the reasons black and white voters vote\n\ndifferently have no relevance to the central section 2 inquiry.\"\n\n478 U.S. at 63 (emphasis added).          Justice O'Connor, writing for\n\nthree other Justices, disagreed.         She rejected Justice Brennan's\n\nassertion that explanations for racially divergent voting patterns\n\n\"can never affect the overall vote dilution inquiry,\" id. at 100\n\n(emphasis added), and cited two examples of how such explanations\n\nmight affect it.     First, she noted:\n\n     Evidence that a candidate preferred by the minority group\n     in a particular election was rejected by white voters for\n     reasons other than those which made that candidate the\n     preferred choice of the minority group would seem clearly\n     relevant in answering the question whether bloc voting by\n     white   voters   will   consistently    defeat   minority\n     candidates.\n\nId. (emphasis added).     She also believed that \"Congress intended\n\nthat explanations of the reasons why white voters rejected minority\n\ncandidates would be probative of the likelihood that candidates\n\nelected without minority support would be willing to take the\n\nminority interests into account.\"        Id.    Contrary to the majority's\n\nassertions, however, Justice O'Connor did not \"maintain[] that\n\nevidence   that   white   and   minority      voters   generally   supported\n\ndifferent candidates did not constitute legally significant racial\n\nbloc voting where these patterns were attributable to partisan\n\naffiliation rather than the race of the candidate.\"                Majority\n\nOpinion at 51.    On this issue, she stated:\n\n     Insofar as statistical evidence of divergent racial\n     voting patterns is admitted solely to establish that the\n     minority group is politically cohesive and to assess its\n     prospects for electoral success, I agree that defendants\n\n                                   179\n\f     cannot rebut this showing by offering evidence that\n     divergent racial voting patterns may be explained in part\n     by causes other than race.\n\nGingles, 478 U.S. at 100 (emphasis added). This statement suggests\n\nthat evidence that divergent voting patterns are explained in part\n\nby partisan affiliation will not preclude a finding of legally\n\nsignificant white bloc voting--a finding which bears directly on\n\nthe minority group's \"prospects for electoral success.\"65\n\n     The    secondary    disagreement        in   Gingles   concerned     Justice\n\nBrennan's statement that \"the race of the candidate per se is\n\nirrelevant to racial bloc voting analysis.\"                    478 U.S. at 67.\n\nJustice    White    disagreed   with   this       statement,   as   did   Justice\n\nO'Connor.     Specifically, they both argued that the race of the\n\ncandidate is relevant to the racial bloc voting inquiry.                  See id.\n\nat 83, 101.        That the race of the candidate is relevant to the\n\nracial bloc voting inquiry, however, does not translate to a\n\nrequirement that minority plaintiffs must negate partisan politics\n\n\n\n     65\n       The majority suggests that evidence that racially\ndivergent voting patterns are attributable to partisan\naffiliation or perceived interests is \"quite probative\" on the\nquestion of whether white bloc voting will consistently defeat\nminority-preferred candidates. Majority Opinion at 57 n.26. I\nstrongly disagree. If the \"perceived interests\" of minority\nvoters lead them to vote for candidates of one political party,\nwhile the interests of a majority of whites lead them to vote for\ncandidates of a different party, this would seem to strengthen,\nnot weaken, the consistency with which the two racial groups\nwould vote differently. That election results appear to be\nattributable to voting along party lines, then, does not suggest\nthat other candidates, \"equally preferred by the minority group,\nmight be able to attract greater white support in future\nelections.\" In short, it does nothing to undercut--and may even\nstrengthen--the consistency with which minority-preferred\ncandidates are defeated.\n\n                                       180\n\for prove racial animus in the electorate in order to demonstrate\n\npolarized voting.\n\n       Finally, I must say a few words about the Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124 (1971), upon which the\n\nmajority places heavy reliance.        The outcome in that case--i.e.,\n\nthe Supreme Court's reversal of the district court's vote dilution\n\nfinding--did not, in my view or in Congress' view, turn on the\n\nabsence of racial bloc voting.        Rather, as Congress indicated in\n\nthe Senate Report accompanying the 1982 amendments to section 2,\n\nthe district court's error in Whitcomb was finding vote dilution\n\n\"on the basis of proof that black ghetto residents with dist[inct]\n\nlegislative interests had been consistently underrepresented in the\n\nlegislature in comparison with their proportion of the population.\"\n\nS. REP. at 20, 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 198; see also id. at 23, 1982\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 200 (\"Whitcomb . . . recognized that, in order to\n\nprevail, plaintiffs had to prove more than that minority members\n\nhad not elected legislators in proportion to their percentage of\n\nthe population.\"). Also significant to the outcome in Whitcomb, in\n\nCongress' view, was the fact that nine blacks had won at-large\n\nelections in the time period studied in Whitcomb.        See id. at 21,\n\n1982    U.S.C.C.A.N.   at   198.66     Significantly,   Congress   never\n\n       66\n       The Department of Justice (DOJ) argues persuasively in\nits en banc brief that the real issue in Whitcomb was not whether\nblacks in Marion County generally were denied an opportunity to\nelect their chosen candidates, but whether ghetto blacks were\nbeing denied such an opportunity. DOJ points specifically to\nevidence suggesting that \"black voters in a middle-class black\narea were able to elect candidates from their area even when\nRepublicans were winning generally.\" See Whitcomb, 403 U.S. at\n133, 150 n.29 (noting that census tract 220, inhabited\n\n                                     181\n\finterpreted Whitcomb to require minority plaintiffs to prove that\n\nthe consistent defeat of their preferred candidates is not the\n\nresult of partisan politics. As explained more fully in my earlier\n\nopinion, Whitcomb stands for the proposition that where there is\n\nevidence of partisan voting or interest group politics and no\n\nevidence that      members   of   the    minority   group   have    an   unequal\n\nopportunity to participate in the political process on account of\n\nrace or color, the minority group's vote dilution claim will fail.\n\nSee LULAC III, 986 F.2d at 808-10.\n\n                     (ii)    Social science problems\n\n       Even without the legal problems inherent in the majority's\n\napproach to legally significant white bloc voting and racially\n\npolarized voting, the majority's approach is severely flawed from\n\na social science perspective.           Regardless of whether the majority\n\nrequires a multivariate regression analysis, which would seek to\n\neliminate all causes of voting behavior other than race, or only a\n\ntrivariate regression analysis, which would attempt to eliminate\n\npartisan affiliation, there is a problem with requiring this type\n\nof evidence as an integral part of the vote dilution inquiry:                 it\n\nignores the critical distinction between experimental research and\n\nnon-experimental research. Specifically, it ignores the warning of\n\nmost   respected    social   scientists,      including     the    experts   who\n\n\n\n\npredominantly by middle class blacks, elected one senator and\nfive representatives). The ghetto area had similar success.\nDuring the same time period, it elected one senator and four\nrepresentatives. Id. at 150 n.29.\n\n                                        182\n\ftestified in this case,67 that the causes of voting behavior cannot\n\nbe determined from the use of any kind of regression analysis--\n\nwhether bivariate, trivariate, or multivariate.\n\n      It is important to recognize that the kind of evidence that\n\nthe majority requires minority plaintiffs to introduce will involve\n\nno   experimental    manipulation        of    independent   variables.   The\n\nplaintiffs will not be able to manipulate the race or party\n\naffiliation of the candidate to determine which one had the greater\n\neffect on election outcomes.         Rather, the plaintiffs will have to\n\ntake existing election results and work backwards.               This kind of\n\nreal world research has been labelled \"non-experimental research\"\n\nby social scientists.       See ELAZAR J. PEDHAZUR, MULTIPLE REGRESSION    IN\n\nBEHAVIORAL RESEARCH: EXPLANATION   AND   PREDICTION 175 (2d ed. 1982).\n\n      There are two main problems with inferring causation on the\n\nbasis of regression analyses in the context of non-experimental\n\nresearch:\n\n      First, variables used in nonexperimental research may be,\n      and often are, proxies for causal variables that are not\n      included in the regression equation. . . . Needless to\n      say, manipulating a proxy variable will not bring about\n      a desired effect regardless of the magnitude of the\n      regression coefficient associated with it.      Yet, one\n      encounters frequently not only the interpretation of\n      proxies as if they were causal variables but also\n      recommendations for policy decisions on the basis of such\n      interpretations. . . .\n\n\n      67\n       The State of Texas' expert in this case conceded that his\nintent in conducting a trivariate regression analysis \"was not\nfind out the precise reasons why a candidate won or lost.\" He\nfurther stated that, if he \"had tried to get involved in campaign\nexpenditures and incumbency, ratings by the Bar Association, it\nwould be an impossible task to do.\" See LULAC III, 986 F.2d at\n805.\n\n                                         183\n\f          Second, variables in nonexperimental research tend\n     to be intercorrelated.      Since more often than not\n     researchers neither understand the causes of the\n     interrelations nor attempt to study them, implications of\n     regression coefficients for policy decisions are\n     questionable.\n\nPEDHAZUR, supra, at 224.\n\n     Requiring        minority     plaintiffs         to    come   forward         with     a\n\nmultivariate     regression        analysis      to    determine       the     causes      of\n\nracially      divergent        voting    patterns,         as   Judge        Higginbotham\n\noriginally advocated in City of Lubbock, see supra Part I.A.1.a.,\n\nwould     implicate     the     second     problem         described     above.           The\n\nindependent     variables       listed     by    Judge      Higginbotham--including\n\nincumbency, campaign expenditures, party identification, income,\n\nmedia use measured by cost, religion--\"tend to be correlated,\n\nsometimes substantially.\"           PEDHAZUR, supra, at 224.            Therefore, \"it\n\n[becomes] difficult, if not impossible, to untangle the effects of\n\neach variable.\"       Id. By inferring causation from such analysis, we\n\nwould undoubtedly         be    engaging    in    what      amounts     to    an   \"almost\n\nmindless interpretation[] of regression analysis in nonexperimental\n\nresearch.\"      Id. at 223.        In short, we would be importing \"junk\n\nscience\" into the Voting Rights Act while rejecting it in other\n\ncontexts.68\n\n     68\n       Professor Bernard Grofman, of the University of\nCalifornia at Irvine, has recently commented on the pitfalls of\ndrawing conclusions about causation from multivariate analyses of\nvoting patterns. In an article appearing in Social Science\nQuarterly, Professor Grofman laments that \"[f]undamental flaws\nexist in most multivariate approaches to bloc voting analysis\nused to date.\" Bernard Grofman, Multivariate Methods & the\nAnalysis of Racially Polarized Voting: Pitfalls in the Use of\nSocial Science by the Courts, 72 SOC. SCI. Q. 826, 828 (1991).\nProfessor Grofman specifically criticizes the methodology used by\n\n                                           184\n\f       Requiring minority plaintiffs to only come forward with a\n\ntrivariate regression analysis, as the majority seems to do in this\n\ncase, does not alleviate the social science problems; it only\n\nmultiplies them.      Not only does such a requirement ignore the fact\n\nthat   the   two    independent    variables     (i.e.,   race   and   partisan\n\naffiliation) are substantially correlated, it also runs the risk\n\nthat the two variables being studied are only proxies for causal\n\nvariables    that    are   not   included   in   the   regression      equation.\n\nIndeed, the majority's position in this case directly conflicts\n\nwith Judge Higginbotham's statement in City of Lubbock, where he\n\ncriticized a bivariate regression analysis for \"ignor[ing] the\n\nreality that race or national origin may mask a host of other\n\nexplanatory variables.\"          730 F.2d at 235.      That is, a trivariate\n\nregression analysis such as the one now effectively required by the\n\n\n\nthe defendants' expert in McCord v. City of Fort Lauderdale, 787\nF.2d 1528, vacated, 804 F.2d 611 (11th Cir. 1986). This expert\ntestified that, because the race of the candidate was not\nsignificant in explaining election outcomes beyond what could be\naccounted for by other variables (such as incumbency, campaign\nexpenditures, newspaper endorsements, voter turnout, and the sex\nof the candidate), race was not really a factor in accounting for\nvoting patterns. See 787 F.2d at 829. According to Professor\nGrofman, the expert's interpretation of the voting statistics was\n\"simply wrong,\" because, among other things, \"there are so many\nother variables collinear with race used that they almost\ncertainly will reduce [the] significance of race in a\nmultivariate regression.\" Grofman, supra, at 830. Ultimately,\nProfessor Grofman concludes:\n\n       [A]s used so far by expert witnesses for defendants in\n       voting rights cases, multivariate regression methods\n       have produced misleading results about the levels of or\n       existence of racial bloc voting patterns, and have\n       served mainly to misuse statistics and confuse courts.\n\nId. at 832.\n\n                                      185\n\fmajority ignores the reality that race or partisanship \"may mask a\n\nhost of other explanatory variables.\"\n\n       The    trivariate       regression    analyses      offered    in    this    case\n\nundoubtedly demonstrate that the party affiliation of a candidate\n\nis a better predictor of electoral success than the race of the\n\ncandidate.         Because we are dealing with non-experimental research,\n\nhowever, I cannot take the leap that the majority makes--namely,\n\nthat the party affiliation of a candidate is the best, or the\n\nsingle most powerful, explanation of electoral success.                             The\n\nevidence in this case also demonstrates that, in many of the\n\ncounties, race is substantially correlated with party affiliation,\n\nand the trivariate regression analysis offered in this case did not\n\ndetermine, and could not have determined, why people join certain\n\nparties.      In my view, then, it can no more explain why people vote\n\nthe    way     they      do    than   a     bivariate      regression       analysis.\n\nSignificantly, for purposes of the Voting Rights Act, it could not\n\nnegate \"race or color\" as an explanation for election outcomes.\n\n                          (iii)    The practical problem\n\n       The majority's approach to legally significant white bloc\n\nvoting       and     racially     polarized       voting     places        an    almost\n\ninsurmountable hurdle in front of minority groups proceeding under\n\nsection 2.         Unless minority plaintiffs can successfully establish\n\nthat   voters       in   the   controlling      political    party    are       racially\n\nmotivated--either through the use of questionable voting statistics\n\nor by calling people from that party and asking them why they voted\n\n\n\n\n                                          186\n\fthe way they did69--their claim will fail.   In fact, they will not\n\neven be able to make out a prima facie case.70\n\n     69\n       But see Kirksey v. City of Jackson, 663 F.2d 659, 662\n(5th Cir. Unit A Dec. 1981) (holding that, because of First\nAmendment concerns, voters' motivations are not subject to\nsearching scrutiny by plaintiffs in a voting rights case),\nclarified, 669 F.2d 316 (5th Cir. 1982).\n\n     70\n       In this regard, I note that the majority's position is\nmuch more strained and severe than the one taken by Chief Judge\nTjoflat of the Eleventh Circuit. In Solomon v. Liberty County,\n899 F.2d 1012 (11th Cir. 1990) (evenly-divided en banc opinion),\ncert. denied, 498 U.S. 1023 (1991), Chief Judge Tjoflat, writing\nfor four other judges, advocated a no racial bias affirmative\ndefense under section 2. He reasoned:\n\n     I submit that section 2 prohibits those voting systems\n     that have the effect of allowing a community motivated\n     by racial bias to exclude a minority group from\n     participation in the political process. Therefore, if\n     a section 2 defendant can affirmatively show, under the\n     totality of the circumstances, that the community is\n     not motivated by racial bias in its voting, a case of\n     vote dilution has not been made out.\n\nId. at 1022 (Tjoflat, C.J., joined by Fay, Edmonson, Cox, and\nHill, JJ., specially concurring). The section 2 framework, as he\nenvisions it, would work in a manner analogous to the framework\nfollowed in Title VII cases. See United States Postal Serv. Bd.\nof Governors v. Aikens, 460 U.S. 711 (1983); McDonnell Douglas\nCorp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). If minority plaintiffs\nsatisfy the Gingles threshold inquiry, a rebuttable presumption\narises that the community is motivated by racial bias. See\nSolomon, 899 F.2d at 1035. If the defendant offers nothing in\nrebuttal, the minority plaintiffs win. However,\n\n     [i]f. . . the defendant offers proof of other objective\n     factors in rebuttal, the court must be satisfied,\n     before it may rule in favor of the plaintiff[s], that,\n     under the totality of the circumstances, the minority\n     group is denied meaningful access to the political\n     process \"on account of race or color.\" If the\n     defendant can affirmatively show that the \"social and\n     historical conditions\" are such that their interaction\n     with the scheme will not result in voting\n     discrimination, the plaintiff[s] cannot prevail. Such\n     an affirmative showing can be made with evidence of\n     objective factors that, under the totality of the\n\n                               187\n\f      The typical section 2 vote dilution case--i.e., where a\n\ncertain electoral law, practice, or structure interacts with social\n\nand   historical    conditions   to    cause    an     inequality    in    the\n\nopportunities enjoyed by minority and white voters to elect their\n\npreferred   candidates--has   two     prominent   features:      One      is   a\n\npolitically cohesive minority group (e.g., blacks or Hispanics)\n\nwhose members share political interests and vote together, usually\n\nin a single political party that also includes whites.              The other\n\nis the existence of a white majority, generally in a different\n\npolitical party, whose voting strength is sufficient usually to\n\ndefeat   the   combined   strength     of   minority    votes   plus      white\n\n\"crossover\" votes.    The problem for minority voters in the typical\n\nsection 2 case is that they have been submerged in a white\n\nmajority--unable to forge a coalition with enough whites to elect\n\nrepresentatives of their choice.       Thus, the Voting Rights Act, as\n\ninterpreted in Gingles and succeeding cases, presupposes partisan\n\nvoting and asks whether politically cohesive minority voters have\n\n\n\n      circumstances, indicate that the voting community is\n      not driven by racial bias.\n\nId. (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added).\n     Even Judge Tjoflat recognizes the concept of racial bloc\nvoting does not contain any racial animus requirement. He notes:\n\n      I do not mean to imply that a defendant, by proving\n      absence of racial bias, can rebut a plaintiff's showing\n      of racial bloc voting. . . . Such evidence, however,\n      does not create an irrebuttable case of vote dilution--\n      it is irrebuttable proof of only one factor (albeit an\n      important factor) in the totality-of-the-circumstances\n      test.\n\nId. at 1035 n.12.\n\n                                     188\n\fan unequal opportunity to participate in the political process--a\n\npartisan political process--and to elect representatives of their\n\nchoice on account of race or color.\n\n     Under the majority's reasoning, this typical scenario, the\n\nscenario specifically contemplated by the Gingles framework, will\n\nnow preclude a finding of vote dilution.   As long as some whites\n\nvote with minorities in the Democratic Party, partisan affiliation\n\nwill always be a better predictor of election outcomes than race\n\n(even if a few minorities vote Republican).    Such circumstances,\n\nunder the majority's framework, will preclude a finding of vote\n\ndilution.   In short, the majority has effectively eviscerated\n\nsection 2 of the Voting Rights Act in communities where there is\n\nany measurable crossover voting by whites.71\n\n     In sum, in the context of a challenge to an at-large election\n\nscheme, there are two ways to view a politically cohesive minority\n\ngroup, which, despite the support of some whites, is consistently\n\n\n     71\n       The majority implies that interest group politics did not\nbegin in Texas until the 1980's, when the Republican Party\nemerged as a force to be reckoned with. The majority ignores\nthat, even when Texas was a one party state, there were still\ndifferent factions, or interest groups, within the Democratic\nparty. Thus, partisan or interest group politics has always been\na feature of Texas' colorful political landscape. To hold\notherwise is to ignore the past reality. As noted previously,\nthe evidence in this case reflects that, before 1980, minority-\npreferred candidates lost in Democratic primary elections,\ngenerally to white Democrats; after 1980, minority-preferred\ncandidates may make it to the general election, but only to lose\nto white Republicans. See LULAC III, 986 F.2d at 812 n.59.\n\"From the vantage point of minority voters--which is the vantage\npoint of section 2--it is difficult to see how the arrival of a\ntwo party system in Texas has altered their ability to\nparticipate in the political process and elect candidates of\ntheir choice.\" Id.\n\n                               189\n\funable to elect representatives of its choice.     I view it as one\n\nfactor suggesting vote dilution--i.e., that a minority group is\n\nsubmerged in a white majority and unable, despite the support of\n\nsome whites, to elect representatives of its choice.   The majority\n\ncalls this merely interest group politics.72   Of course, in calling\n\nthis interest group politics, the majority treats a racial or\n\nlanguage minority group as a mere \"interest group\" rather than as\n\na politically cohesive minority group striving to make its voice\n\nheard.\n\n          c.   A more reasonable approach to racial bloc voting,\n               causation, and voters' motivations\n\n     Rather than altering the section 2 framework and requiring\n\nminority plaintiffs to negate partisan politics (or perhaps to\n\nprove racial animus in the electorate) in order to make out a prima\n\nfacie case of vote dilution, I would adhere to the framework\n\nestablished by the language of section 2, as interpreted by the\n\nSupreme Court and this court.   To make out a prima facie case of\n\n     72\n       In support of its assertion that partisan politics, not\nrace, is responsible for the inability of blacks and Hispanics to\nparticipate in the political process and elect representatives of\ntheir choice, the majority notes that \"white Democrats have in\nrecent years experienced the same electoral defeats as minority\nvoters.\" Majority Opinion at 63. It then states:\n\n     If we are to hold that these losses at the polls,\n     without more, give rise to racial vote dilution\n     warranting special relief for minority voters, a\n     principle by which we might justify withholding similar\n     relief from white Democrats is not readily apparent.\n\nId. The simple answer to this concern about limiting the reach\nof section 2 is that, unlike the minorities in this case, whites\nare not politically cohesive. Thus, contrary to the majority's\nassertions, white Democrats would be no more able to obtain\nrelief under section 2 than would white Republicans.\n\n                                190\n\fvote dilution, a minority group would have to satisfy the Gingles\n\nthreshold inquiry by demonstrating:            (1) that it is sufficiently\n\nlarge and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a\n\nsingle-member district; (2) that it is politically cohesive; and\n\n(3) that the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable\n\nit--in the absence of special circumstances--usually to defeat the\n\nminority's preferred candidate.          Gingles, 478 U.S. at 48-51.    Once\n\nthe minority group satisfied the Gingles threshold inquiry, it\n\nwould have to put on evidence of the totality of the circumstances\n\nto   demonstrate:     (1)   that    it   has   an   unequal   opportunity   to\n\nparticipate in the political process and elect representatives of\n\nits choice, see 42 U.S.C. § 1973(b); and (2) that this unequal\n\nopportunity to participate and elect is tied to race or color, see\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973(a).    See also LULAC III, 986 F.2d at 754-55.\n\n      To satisfy the third Gingles threshold requirement--i.e.,\n\nlegally significant white bloc voting--I would not require minority\n\nplaintiffs to either negate partisan politics or prove racial\n\nanimus in the electorate.          Rather, as I explained in my earlier\n\nopinion, minority plaintiffs would have to demonstrate \"a white\n\nbloc vote that normally will defeat the combined strength of\n\nminority support plus white `crossover' votes.\"               LULAC III, 986\n\nF.2d at 745 (quoting Gingles, 478 U.S. at 56).                  This is not\n\nnecessarily an easy burden.          Minority plaintiffs would have to\n\ndemonstrate, with a fair degree of predictability, the white\n\nmajority's success.    See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 51.           They could not\n\n\n\n\n                                      191\n\frely on the loss of an occasional election to establish legally\n\nsignificant white bloc voting.    See id.\n\n     I would similarly look to objective factors in analyzing,\n\nunder the totality of the circumstances, \"the extent to which\n\nvoting in the elections of the state or political subdivision is\n\nracially polarized.\"    S. REP. at 29, 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 206.\n\nThat is, I reject the argument that \"racially polarized voting,\" as\n\nused in the Senate Report, means racially motivated voting or\n\nvoting caused by racial animus in the electorate.     See LULAC III,\n\n986 F.2d at 748.   For the reasons discussed above, I also reject\n\nthe majority's more strained, alternative interpretation of this\n\nrequirement--that racially polarized voting is voting not caused by\n\npartisan affiliation.    Finally, although I would hold that the\n\nelections most relevant to the racial bloc voting inquiry are those\n\nin which a minority candidate opposes a white candidate, I would\n\nnot characterize racially polarized voting as \"the tendency of\n\ncitizens to vote for candidates of their own race.\"   See id.   In my\n\nview, racially polarized voting is established when \"there is a\n\nconsistent relationship between [the] race of the voter and the way\n\nin which the voter votes, . . . or to put it differently, where\n\n[minority] voters and white voters vote differently.\" Gingles, 478\n\nU.S. at 53 n.21.\n\n     This is not to say that the causes of racially divergent\n\nvoting patterns, or voters' motivations, are irrelevant to the\n\nsection 2 inquiry.     Such causes are relevant to the white bloc\n\nvoting inquiry under the Gingles threshold test, but only to the\n\n\n                                 192\n\fextent that they call into question the consistency with which the\n\nwhite bloc will oppose minority-preferred candidates.     See LULAC\n\nIII, 986 F.2d at 745-46 n.6.73     The causes of racially divergent\n\nvoting patterns are also relevant to the totality of circumstances\n\ninquiry.    If it can be shown that white voters who consistently\n\nvote against minority-preferred candidates are motivated by racial\n\nanimus, such proof could be a signal of vote dilution.    See id. at\n\n753-54.    As Justice O'Connor explained in her Gingles concurrence,\n\nin \"a community that is polarized along racial lines, racial\n\nhostility\" may create even more of a barrier to participation in\n\nthe political process.    See 478 U.S. at 100 (emphasis added).   It\n\nmight, for example, affect the \"likelihood that candidates elected\n\nwithout decisive minority support would be willing to take the\n\nminority's interests into account.\"     Id.   For the same reasons,\n\nproof that the white voters are not motivated by racial animus\n\n     73\n       I therefore agree with Justice O'Connor's position on the\nextent to which explanations for racially divergent voting\npatterns are relevant to the white bloc voting inquiry. In\nGingles, she stated:\n\n     Evidence that a candidate preferred by the minority\n     group in a particular election was rejected by white\n     voters for reasons other than those which made that\n     candidate the preferred choice of the minority group\n     would seem clearly relevant in answering the question\n     whether bloc voting by white voters will consistently\n     defeat minority candidates. Such evidence would\n     suggest that another candidate, equally preferred by\n     the minority group, might be able to attract greater\n     white support in future elections.\n\n478 U.S. at 100 (emphasis added). As noted previously, see supra\nnote 3, I read this passage as saying that evidence of partisan\nvoting patterns that overlay racial bloc voting patterns would\nnot call into question the consistent defeat of minority-\npreferred candidates.\n\n                                 193\n\fwould also be relevant to the totality of circumstances inquiry.\n\nThe absence of proof of racial animus, however, should not weigh\n\nheavily against minority plaintiffs proceeding under section 2.\n\n\"[B]ecause overt political racism has decreased over time, racial\n\nanimus in the electorate may be difficult, if not impossible to\n\ndetect.\"       LULAC III, 986 F.2d at 754 (citing United States v.\n\nMarengo County Comm'n, 731 F.2d 1546, 1571 (11th Cir.), cert.\n\ndenied, 469 U.S. 976 (1984)).\n\n     By refusing to make racial animus in the electorate the focus\n\nof the vote dilution inquiry, I am not attempting to sever section\n\n2 from its constitutional underpinnings.             Minority plaintiffs\n\nultimately have the burden, under the totality of circumstances\n\ninquiry, to demonstrate that their inability to participate in the\n\npolitical process and elect representatives of their choice is \"on\n\naccount of race or color.\"         See LULAC III, 986 F.2d at 754-55.\n\nThis inquiry is not a narrow one that focuses on the present\n\nmotivation of voters, but a blended one that focuses on the past\n\nand present reality of the local political landscape.             See S. REP.\n\nat 30, 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 208 Minority plaintiffs can meet this\n\nburden by demonstrating some mix of factors under the totality of\n\nthe circumstances--such as the existence of racially polarized\n\nvoting,    a   history   of   official    discrimination,   the    lingering\n\nsocioeconomic effects of discrimination, racial campaign appeals,\n\nand other features of the current or past racial climate.                See\n\nLULAC III, 986 F.2d at 755.\n\n\n\n\n                                    194\n\f       Unlike the majority, then, I cannot conclude that the district\n\ncourt clearly erred in finding legally significant white bloc\n\nvoting and racially polarized voting in Texas district court\n\nelections--at least with respect to eight of the nine counties at\n\nissue in this case.        The Plaintiffs offered evidence sufficient to\n\nsupport the district court's findings that the white bloc vote in\n\nBexar, Dallas, Ector, Harris, Jefferson, Lubbock, Midland, and\n\nTarrant counties will usually defeat the minority's preferred\n\ncandidate.       The Plaintiffs also offered substantial statistical\n\nevidence of racially polarized, or racially divergent, voting\n\npatterns.     The district court's findings with respect to these\n\nspecific inquiries are plausible in light of the record viewed as\n\na whole; therefore, they are not clearly erroneous.\n\n       Nor can I join the majority's conclusion that the district\n\ncourt, by stating that the causes of racially divergent voting\n\npatterns    are    irrelevant   to     the        section   2   inquiry,   committed\n\nreversible error.         The district court was, admittedly, wrong to\n\nsuggest     that    the   causes      of     racially       polarized   voting   are\n\nirrelevant; however, the evidence offered by the State of Texas in\n\nthis case concerning the causes of racially divergent voting\n\npatterns is insufficient, in my view, to negate or undercut the\n\ndistrict court's ultimate finding, in eight of the nine counties,\n\nthat    blacks     and    Hispanics        have    an   unequal    opportunity   to\n\nparticipate in the political process and elect representatives of\n\ntheir choice \"on account of race or color.\"                     See LULAC III, 986\n\nF.2d at 803-13.      The trivariate regression analyses offered by the\n\n\n                                           195\n\fState Defendants simply do not explain why people vote the way they\n\ndo.    Even under the majority's narrow view of the section 2\n\ninquiry, they do not negate \"race or color\" as an explanation for\n\nthe inability of minorities to elect representatives of their\n\nchoice.74   Moreover, as explained in LULAC III, uninformed and\n\nstraight-ticket voting along party lines can, and in this case\n\ndoes, reinforce minority voters' unequal access to the political\n\nprocess.    Id. at 812.\n\n      2.    Other Examples of Alterations in the Section 2 Inquiry\n\n      In its efforts to overhaul section 2, the majority does not\n\nstop at reformulating the white bloc voting and racially polarized\n\nvoting inquiries. It also changes--in some instances, sua sponte--\n\nthe rules with respect to several other specific inquiries under\n\nthe totality of the circumstances. In particular, the majority (a)\n\nnow uses the lingering socioeconomic effects of discrimination as\n\na factor arguing against a finding of vote dilution, (b) declares\n\nthat the history of official discrimination against blacks and\n\nHispanics is to be entitled to little weight, (c) makes certain\n\nfactors indicative of current racial bias \"particularly\" important\n\nunder the totality of circumstances inquiry, and (d) aggregates\n\nblacks and Hispanics in two of the counties, even though no one\n\nsought to do so in the district court.     By further altering the\n\nsection 2 framework, the majority can confidently conclude that the\n\nevidence of vote dilution in this case is \"weak.\"\n\n      74\n        This evidence would also, therefore, be insufficient to\nestablish a \"no racial bias\" affirmative defense, as advocated by\nChief Judge Tjoflat of the Eleventh Circuit. See supra note 8.\n\n                                 196\n\f           a.    Lingering socioeconomic effects of discrimination:\n                 the paucity of minority lawyers\n\n     The majority concludes that the Plaintiffs' vote dilution case\n\nin each of the counties is weakened by the indisputable fact that,\n\nin all of the counties, the percentage of minority lawyers is much\n\nsmaller than the percentage of minority voters. The appalling lack\n\nof minority judges on the Texas district court bench does not point\n\ntowards vote dilution, we are told, because \"[t]he absence of\n\neligible candidates goes a long way in explaining the absence of\n\nminority judges.\"    Majority Opinion at 76.    Indeed, the majority\n\nproclaims that minorities are overrepresented on the district court\n\nbench.    It argues, on the one hand, that the Voting Rights Act is\n\n\"not an unbridled license--to explore for example the persistent\n\nlow enrollment of black law students.\"         Id. at 146.   It then\n\nsuggests, however, that blacks are somehow responsible for their\n\nown plight--i.e., for their persistent low enrollment in law\n\nschool.   See id. at 146-47.75\n\n     I cannot agree with the majority that the lack or absence of\n\nminority lawyers undercuts the Plaintiffs' vote dilution case.\n\nFirst, in assessing the extent to which minority candidates have\n\nbeen elected to public office, the appropriate comparison pool has\n\nalways been the number of minorities in the population. See 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1973(b) (\"The extent to which members of a protected class\n\n     75\n       I am referring specifically to the majority's decision to\nexplore low black enrollment at Louisiana State University Law\nSchool. This \"example\" has about as much to do with this case as\ndoes George Wallace's decision to crown a black homecoming queen\nat halftime of a football game at the University of Alabama. See\nLULAC III, 986 F.2d at 819 (Higginbotham, J., dissenting).\n\n                                 197\n\fhave been elected to office in the State or political subdivision\n\nis one circumstance which may be considered:               Provided, That\n\nnothing in this section establishes a right to have members of a\n\nprotected   class   in   numbers   equal   to   their   proportion   in   the\n\npopulation); see also LULAC III, 986 F.2d at 750-52.76          Second, in\n\nmost of the counties at issue in this case, there are numerous\n\nminority lawyers who are well-qualified for the job of Texas\n\ndistrict court judge.        According to the State of Texas' own\n\nexhibits, there are hundreds of eligible minority lawyers in Bexar\n\n(317 eligible Hispanics), Dallas (184 eligible blacks), and Harris\n\ncounties (446 eligible blacks). There are also significant numbers\n\nof minority lawyers in several of the other counties.                As the\n\ndistrict court correctly found, \"even if there is some relationship\n\nbetween the low number of minority judges and the number of\n\neligible minority lawyers, that fact does not explain why well\n\nqualified eligible minority lawyers lose judicial elections.\"\n\n\n\n\n     76\n       As the Houston Lawyers' Association noted at oral\nargument, the Voting Rights Act is not about equal employment\nopportunities; it is about the equal opportunity of voters to\nparticipate in the political process and elect representatives of\ntheir choice. In this regard, it is interesting to note that the\nmajority, in proclaiming that minorities are overrepresented on\nthe district court bench, frequently considers minority judges\nwho were not minority-preferred candidates. In Dallas County,\nfor example, the majority recites that five of the thirty-six\ndistrict judges are black. What the majority does not say is\nthat the two black judges who won partisan elections were not\neven the preferred candidates of the black community. The\nmajority also ignores the fact that, at the time of trial in\nDallas County, no black candidate with the support of the black\ncommunity had ever won a contested election for district judge.\nSee LULAC III, 986 F.2d at 785.\n\n                                    198\n\f     Even more inexcusable, however, is the majority's refusal to\n\nrecognize that the comparative lack of minority lawyers constitutes\n\nevidence of the lingering socioeconomic effects of discrimination,\n\nwhich argues in favor of a vote dilution finding.            The Senate\n\nReport accompanying the amended section 2 instructs courts to\n\nconsider \"the extent to which members of the minority group in the\n\nstate or political subdivision bear the effects of discrimination\n\nin such areas as education, employment, and health, which hinder\n\ntheir ability to participate effectively in the political process.\"\n\nS. REP. at 29, 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 206.    The majority recognizes,\n\nas it must, that no one has \"questioned [P]laintiffs' assertion\n\nthat disparities between white and minority residents in several\n\nsocioeconomic categories are the tragic legacies of the State's\n\ndiscriminatory practices.\" Majority Opinion at 77. The Plaintiffs\n\nintroduced exhibits in each of the counties showing that minorities\n\nlag unreasonably behind whites in terms of income, education, and\n\nemployment.    Along these lines, it cannot seriously be disputed\n\nthat the lack of eligible minority lawyers is in no small part the\n\nresult    of   past   racial   discrimination   in   Texas    schools--\n\ndiscrimination that remains unremedied in some cases even to this\n\nday.77\n\n     77\n        For most of its history, Texas has maintained--at all\nlevels--a racially discriminatory education system. See, e.g.,\nSweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629 (1950) (holding that the\nUniversity of Texas Law School's racially discriminatory\nadmittance policy violated the Equal Protection clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment). This system of dual schools, which were\nundoubtedly separate and unequal, began to be remedied as early\nas 1960 in the Houston public school system. See Houston Indep.\nSch. Dist. v. Ross, 282 F.2d 95 (5th Cir. 1960) (affirming\n\n                                  199\n\f    Nor   can   one   seriously     dispute   that   this     lingering\n\nsocioeconomic effect of discrimination hinders the ability of\n\nminorities to participate in the political process.         Contrary to\n\n\n\n\ndistrict court order which required desegregation of schools to\nbegin in September 1960); see also Flax v. Potts, 464 F.2d 865,\n867 (5th Cir.) (noting that Fort Worth Independent School\nDistrict had official policy of segregation until 1967), cert.\ndenied, 409 U.S. 1007 (1972). Other communities, however, began\ndismantling their dual school systems at a much later date. See\nUnited States v. CRUCIAL, 722 F.2d 1182 (1983) (affirming\ndistrict court's finding that Ector County engaged in intentional\nsegregation of black and Hispanic students, which extended into\nthe 1981-82 school year); Graves v. Barnes, 378 F. Supp. 640, 648\n(W.D. Tex. 1974) (three-judge court) (finding that twenty years\nafter the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of\nEducation, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), the Beaumont Independent School\nDistrict continued to bus black children away from their\nneighborhood schools and across town to all-black schools),\nvacated sub. nom. White v. Regester, 422 U.S. 935 (1975); id. at\n654-55 (recognizing that authorities in Lubbock County maintained\nracially and ethnically segregated schools until the 1970's). As\na result of these desegregation efforts, many of the school\ndistricts that were under court supervision for some twenty years\nfinally achieved unitary systems during the 1980's. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Texas Educ. Agency, 138 F.R.D. 503, 505 (N.D.\nTex. 1991) (noting that Lubbock Independent School District was\ndeclared to be a unitary system in May 1988), aff'd, 952 F.2d 399\n(5th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 2992 (1992); Flax v.\nPotts, 725 F. Supp. 322, 330 (N.D. Tex. 1989) (declaring Fort\nWorth Independent School District to be unitary), aff'd, 915 F.2d\n155 (5th Cir. 1990); Covington v. Beaumont Indep. Sch. Dist., 714\nF. Supp. 1402, 1404 (E.D. Tex. 1989) (noting that Beaumont\nIndependent School District was declared unitary in 1984). The\nonly notable exception in this regard is the Dallas public school\nsystem, which continues to be under court supervision. See Tasby\nv. Edwards, 807 F. Supp. 421 (N.D. Tex. 1992)\n     The point of this discussion is that many minorities\nresiding in the target counties at issue in this case--especially\nthose who are forty or older--attended segregated schools. This\nis precisely the age group from which one would expect state\ndistrict court judges to be drawn. How one can say that this\npast discrimination does not hinder the current ability of blacks\nand Hispanics to participate in the political process involving\nthe election of state district court judges escapes me.\n\n                                  200\n\fthe majority's suggestions otherwise,78 \"[t]he requirement that the\n\npolitical processes leading to nomination and election be `equally\n\nopen' to participation by the group in question extends beyond\n\nformal or official bars to registering and voting, or [even] to\n\nmaintaining a candidacy.\" Id. at 30, 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 208\n\n(emphasis added); see also Shaw v. Reno, 113 S. Ct. 2816 (1993)\n\n(noting that the success of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in\n\nreducing the spread between black and white voter registration did\n\nnot suffice to root out other racially discriminatory voting\n\npractices, such as multi-member or at-large electoral systems);\n\nReynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 555 n.29 (1964) (\"There is more to\n\nthe right to vote than the right to mark a piece of paper and drop\n\nit in a box or the right to pull a lever in a voting booth.\").\n\nThat is, the question of whether the lingering socioeconomic\n\neffects of discrimination hinder the ability of minorities to\n\nparticipate in the political process is much broader than asking\n\nwhether they register and vote at rates equal to whites.    See S.\n\nREP. at 6, 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 183 (noting that \"registration is\n\nonly the first hurdle to full effective participation in the\n\n     78\n       The majority holds that Plaintiffs can only show\ndepressed political participation by pointing to low voter\nregistration or low voter turnout rates. Based on this holding,\nit reverses as clearly erroneous the district court's finding\nthat blacks and Hispanics throughout the State of Texas continue\nto bear the effects of past discrimination, which hinder their\nability to participate in the political process. Thus, while the\nmajority uses the lack of minority lawyers against the Plaintiffs\nwith respect to the inquiry into the number of minority judges,\nit ignores the lack of minority lawyers on the question of\nwhether the lingering socioeconomic effects of discrimination\nhinder the ability of blacks and Hispanics to participate in the\npolitical process. This is absurd.\n\n                               201\n\fpolitical process\"); id. at 30 n.120, 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 208\n\nn.120 (\"[T]he conclusion . . . that in fact [minorities] ha[ve]\n\nregistered and voted without hindrance\" is not dispositive under\n\nsection 2).        One aspect of the ability to participate in the\n\npolitical process must surely include the ability to run for the\n\noffice, and as long as minorities continue to bear the effects of\n\npast discrimination in education and employment, their ability to\n\nparticipate in the Texas district court political process will be\n\nseverely hindered.         See TEX. CONST. art. V, § 7 (establishing\n\neligibility requirements for district court judges).\n\n     Thus, like the majority, I would hold that the relative lack\n\nof eligible minority candidates is relevant to the section 2\n\ninquiry.        Unlike the majority, however, this indisputable fact\n\nwould     not   argue   against   a   finding   of   dilution;    it   would   be\n\ncompelling evidence of the extent to which blacks and Hispanics\n\ncontinue to \"bear the effects of discrimination in such areas as\n\neducation [and] employment, . . . which hinder their ability to\n\nparticipate effectively in the political process.\"               S. REP. at 29,\n\n1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 206.79\n\n     79\n       There is also testimony in the record suggesting that the\nability of minorities to run in county-wide elections is hampered\nby their lack of financial resources. The majority, after\nweighing this evidence with other evidence suggesting that\nminorities were able to raise funds, finds that minorities were\nable to run well-financed campaigns. It thus concludes that the\ntestimony from several witnesses about minority candidates' lack\nof financial resources does not support the district court's\nfinding that the lingering socioeconomic effects of\ndiscrimination hinder the ability of minorities to participate\neffectively in district court elections. I disagree. In my\nview, the testimony of these witnesses, as well as Dr.\nBrischetto's expert testimony on the subject, provide further\n\n                                       202\n\f             b.     Past official discrimination\n\n      The    majority       also   suggests     that    the    long    history    of\n\ndiscrimination against blacks and Hispanics in Texas is entitled to\n\nlittle, if any, independent weight under the totality of the\n\ncircumstances.          The majority recognizes that \"Texas' long history\n\nof discrimination against its black and Hispanic citizens in all\n\nareas of public life is not the subject of dispute.\"                      Majority\n\nOpinion     at    77.     However,   in    discussing    the   totality     of    the\n\ncircumstances in its application of the law to each county, the\n\nmajority brushes over this history as if it were somehow irrelevant\n\nto the section 2 inquiry.            I cannot join this decision to amend\n\nsection 2.\n\n      The Senate Report specifically instructs courts to consider,\n\nas an independent factor under the totality of the circumstances,\n\n\"the extent of any history of official discrimination in the state\n\nor political subdivision that touched the right of the members of\n\nthe   minority      group     to   register,    to     vote,   or     otherwise    to\n\nparticipate in the political process.\"                   S. REP. at 28, 1982\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 206.         By including this factor as a signal of vote\n\ndilution, Congress made a legislative decision, which we must\n\n\n\nsupport for the district court's finding in this regard.\n     Moreover, as I noted in my earlier opinion, the issue of\nwhether blacks and Hispanics continue to suffer the effects of\ndiscrimination--effects that hinder their ability to participate\nin the political process--was not a contested issue at trial and\nhas not been pursued by the parties on appeal. See LULAC III,\n986 F.2d at 782-83 n.41. The majority's decision to pursue this\nissue and reverse the district court's finding on clearly\nerroneous grounds is, thus, a further indication of its\ninsistence on cleaning up--or cleaning out--section 2.\n\n                                          203\n\frespect, that evidence of past discrimination--even standing alone-\n\n-is a   factor   pointing   toward    vote       dilution   under   section   2.\n\nIndeed, in amending section 2 and enacting the results test,\n\nCongress intended to remedy past discrimination.                  It expressly\n\nfound   \"that    voting     practices       and     procedures      that   have\n\ndiscriminatory results perpetuate the effects of past purposeful\n\ndiscrimination.\"    Id. at 40, 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 218 (emphasis\n\nadded). The majority effectively ignores this legislative decision\n\nby requiring Plaintiffs to demonstrate that the effects of past\n\ndiscrimination   \"actually    hamper       the   ability    of   minorities   to\n\nparticipate.\"    Majority Opinion at 77.\n\n     The majority thus attempts, in the words of Charles Black,\n\nJr., to \"uncouple present from past.\"             Charles L. Black, Jr., And\n\nOur Posterity, 102 YALE L. J. 1527, 1529 (1993). As Professor Black\n\naptly observes, however,\n\n          This disconnection of present from past . . . cannot\n     be made to seem successful today, any more than in 1883.\n     American slavery lasted more than two centuries, not too\n     far from twice the time since its abolition.         Even\n     abolition was not the end. Quite soon after the Civil\n     War, the national effort to remedy the situation of the\n     newly free was as good as abandoned; in the places where\n     most of them lived they were not even so much as allowed\n     to vote in the only election that counted; per capita\n     public expenditures in public schools for their children\n     ran far below--sometimes by a factor of one to ten--\n     expenditure in white schools. The paradox of \"separate\n     but equal,\" improvised--like the white primary--with a\n     broad knowing wink, not only imprisoned black people in\n     these schools, but also cut off all black people,\n     children and grown-ups, from any kind of equal\n     participation in the common life of the community.\n\nId. at 1529-30; see also supra note 15.\n\n\n\n\n                                     204\n\f     The simple fact is that blacks and Hispanics in Texas have\n\nindisputably been the victims of official discrimination in all\n\nareas of life. The district court was warranted in taking judicial\n\nnotice of this history, and in giving it weight in deciding whether\n\nthe Plaintiffs demonstrated an inability to participate in the\n\npolitical process and elect representatives of their choice \"on\n\naccount of race or color.\"   For the majority to suggest otherwise\n\nis to \"publish a general Act of Oblivion.\"    Black, supra, at 1530.\n\nI will not join such an act.\n\n          c.   The elevation of several factors under the totality\n               of circumstances inquiry\n\n     The majority further reveals its intent to shift the focus of\n\nthe section 2 inquiry by elevating certain factors under the\n\ntotality of the circumstances.   In particular, the majority states\n\nthat, in determining the strength of a vote dilution case, courts\n\nmust consider, among other things:     the willingness of the racial\n\nor ethnic majority to give their votes to minority candidates of\n\ntheir own party; whether the minority plaintiffs have found proof\n\nof racial campaign appeals; and whether elected officials were\n\nfound to be non-responsive to the needs of minority voters.\n\n     These factors are undoubtedly relevant to the section 2\n\ninquiry, but to elevate them, as the majority does, changes the\n\nfocus of the analytical framework. All of them--the willingness of\n\nwhite voters to vote for minority candidates of their own race,80\n\n     80\n       In reversing the district court's findings of vote\ndilution, the majority places heavy emphasis on the fact that, in\nseveral of the counties, white majorities voted for Republican\nminority judicial candidates. It also creates the impression\n\n                                 205\n\fthe existence of racial campaign appeals, and the responsiveness of\n\nelected officials--are concerned primarily with current racial\n\nanimus in either the electorate, in candidates, or in elected\n\nofficials.     In my view, current racial hostility is not the\n\nultimate focus of section 2.    See supra Part I.A.1.c.\n\n       Moreover,   elevating   these   factors   ignores   Congress'\n\ninstructions in the Senate Report that \"there is no requirement\n\nthat any particular number of factors be proved, or that a majority\n\npoint one way or the other.\"    S. REP. at 29, 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at\n\n207.   In particular, it ignores the statement in the Senate Report\n\nthat \"[u]nresponsiveness is not an essential part of plaintiff's\n\ncase.\").     Id. at 29 n.116; 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 207; see also\n\n\nthat the Republican Party aggressively recruited minority\ncandidates in all of the counties at issue. Majority Opinion at\n63. This picture is not entirely accurate.\n     While there was evidence in Dallas County that two black\nRepublican district court candidates were elected with the\nsupport of the white majority, there was also expert testimony,\nbased on a telephone survey, that most voters in Dallas County\nhad absolutely no idea of the race of the candidate for whom they\nwere voting. At most, then, this evidence shows that white\nvoters in Dallas County could not have been motivated by specific\nracial animus toward candidates. But this is only because of the\nso-called anonymity factor. There was also, admittedly, evidence\nsuggesting that the Republican Party in Dallas County attempted\nto recruit minority candidates.\n     As for the other counties, however, there is little, if any\nevidence that white majorities would support Republican minority\ncandidates in district court elections. This is because, as best\nI can tell from the record: (1) in Harris County, only one black\nRepublican district court candidate won a contested district\ncourt election; (2) in Bexar County, only one Hispanic Republican\nwon a contested district court election; and (3) in Tarrant\nCounty, only one black Republican won a contested district court\nelection. This lack of Republican minority district court\ncandidates also calls into question the majority's assertion that\nthe Republican Party actively recruited minority candidates in\nother counties. There is very little evidence of any such\nrecruitment in counties other than Dallas.\n\n                                 206\n\fUnited States v. Marengo County Comm'n, 731 F.2d at 1571 (The\n\nabsence of racial campaign appeals \"should not weigh heavily\n\nagainst a plaintiff proceeding under the results test of section\n\n2.\"). Unlike the majority, then, I would not elevate these factors\n\nunder the section 2 inquiry.\n\n          d.    Forcing minority groups to proceed as a coalition\n\n     Finally, the majority demonstrates the extent to which it will\n\ngo to overhaul section 2 (and to preserve Texas' method for\n\nelecting district court judges) by holding that the district court\n\nclearly erred   in   refusing   to    give   equal   weight   to   elections\n\ninvolving whites and Hispanics in Harris and Tarrant counties.           In\n\nboth of these counties, Plaintiffs proceeded only on behalf of\n\nblack voters.   The majority, noting that political cohesion is a\n\n\"question of fact\" and not a strategic card, makes a finding of\n\nfact on appeal that blacks and Hispanics in these two counties are\n\npolitically cohesive.   It makes this fact finding even though the\n\nparties never requested the district court to do so.81\n\n     81\n       Indeed, as I noted in my earlier opinion in this case,\nwith respect to Harris County, the parties specifically argued in\nthe district court (and requested a fact finding) that \"Blacks\nand Hispanics together in Harris County do not constitute a\npolitically cohesive minority group.\" See LULAC III, 986 F.2d at\n789. And in Tarrant County, no party ever requested a fact\nfinding that blacks and Hispanics are politically cohesive. See\nid. at 799-800 n.49.\n     The majority asserts that the parties' failure to request a\nfinding on the question of whether blacks and Hispanics in Harris\nand Tarrant counties is beside the point. It argues that the\nclaim raised on appeal is that the district court improperly\nrefused to consider elections involving Hispanic candidates,\nelections studied by the State of Texas' own expert. This latter\nquestion, the majority asserts, \"is most assuredly before\" this\ncourt. I disagree.\n     The State of Texas, in a reply brief to the original panel\n\n                                     207\n\f     By making this finding, the majority shows a complete lack of\n\njudicial restraint.    Regardless of what one thinks about allowing\n\nvarious minority groups to voluntarily combine themselves for\n\nsection 2 purposes,82 it is clear that, if such coalition minority\n\ngroups are permitted, \"proof of minority political cohesion is all\n\nthe more essential.\"    Growe v. Emison, 113 S. Ct. at 1085.   In my\n\nview, it is not within the power of a federal appellate court to\n\nmake this fact finding--especially where none was requested below.\n\n\nthat heard this case in 1990, raised this issue for the first\ntime on appeal. It asserted:\n\n     If [a coalition of blacks and Hispanics] can be proved\n     by voting rights plaintiffs in order to help them meet\n     the first two Gingles preconditions, what prevents\n     voting rights defendants from proving the existence of\n     such a de facto coalition in order to shed light on\n     whether the third Gingles precondition can be met? The\n     district court denied the State Officials that\n     opportunity in the targeted counties, including Harris\n     and Tarrant Counties, by treating as irrelevant the\n     numerous races analyzed there involving Anglo judicial\n     candidates versus Hispanic judicial candidates . . . .\n\nThus, the defendants \"raised\" this issue by asking a rhetorical\nquestion in a reply brief. Even if there were nothing to prevent\nvoting rights defendants from proving the existence of a de facto\ncoalition between blacks and Hispanics in Harris and Tarrant\ncounties, the problem with the argument is that the State of\nTexas simply did not seek to prove this fact in front of the\ndistrict court and, with regard to Harris County, expressly\nrequested a fact finding to the contrary.\n     82\n       The majority curiously does not feel the need to revisit\nour decision in Campos v. City of Baytown, 840 F.2d 1240, 1244\n(5th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 492 U.S. 905 (1988)--despite the\nfact that several of my colleagues obviously disagree with the\nprinciple of allowing minorities to proceed as a coalition under\nsection 2. See Campos v. City of Baytown, 849 F.2d 943 (5th Cir.\n1988) (Higginbotham, J., joined by Gee, Garwood, Jolly, Davis,\nand Jones, JJ., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc);\nLeague of United Latin American Citizens, Council No. 4386 v.\nMidland Indep. Sch. Dist., 812 F.2d 1494, 1503 (5th Cir. 1987)\n(Higginbotham, J., dissenting).\n\n                                 208\n\f     3.     The Result of the Majority's Handiwork\n\n     In sum, I reject the majority's characterization of the\n\nevidence of vote dilution offered in this case.           It can only be\n\ncharacterized as weak by altering the section 2 inquiry, which the\n\nmajority does freely.      No longer is the inquiry a blended one,\n\nwhich looks to the past and present reality of the local political\n\nlandscape.    It is now a selective inquiry into the present.             I\n\ncannot join this restructuring of the section 2 inquiry.\n\nB.   The Weight of the State of Texas' Interest in Maintaining the\n     Current Electoral System\n\n     Nor can I join the majority in its conclusion that the State\n\nof Texas' interest in maintaining its current system--specifically,\n\nits interest in linking electoral base to \"primary jurisdiction\"--\n\nis substantial enough to outweigh the Plaintiffs' proof of vote\n\ndilution.    This interest is little more than tenuous and could not\n\noutweigh even weak evidence of vote dilution.\n\n     The majority argues that Texas links the primary jurisdiction\n\nof its district courts with their electoral base in order to\n\npreserve the values of independence and accountability.             This so-\n\ncalled linkage interest, we are told, is substantial, because it\n\nrepresents the State of Texas' decision about what constitutes a\n\nstate district judge.       According to the majority, by linking\n\ndistrict    judges'   electoral   base   with   their   area   of   primary\n\njurisdiction, the State of Texas has made a decision similar to the\n\nState of Missouri's decision in Gregory v. Ashcroft, 111 S. Ct.\n\n2395 (1991), to have age qualifications for its judges.\n\n\n\n                                   209\n\f      Assuming arguendo that we are supposed to weigh non-tenuous\n\nstate interests against proven vote dilution,83 there are several\n\nflaws in the majority's analysis of the strength of Texas' linkage\n\ninterest.       First, I remain unconvinced that Texas insists on\n\nlinking \"primary jurisdiction\" with electoral base. Also, there is\n\na   serious     question   as   to    whether      this   linking    of   primary\n\njurisdiction with electoral base actually promotes the values of\n\nindependence and accountability.           Finally, Texas' linkage interest\n\ncan be equally served by other means, means that would not dilute\n\nminority voting strength. Once these analytical flaws are exposed,\n\nit becomes clear that Texas' decision to link electoral base with\n\nprimary    jurisdiction    is   not   at     all   comparable   to   Missouri's\n\ndecision in Gregory to have age limits for its trial judges.\n\n      1.      Questioning Texas' Insistence on Linkage\n\n      The majority concludes that the State of Texas does in fact\n\nlink the primary jurisdiction of state district court judges with\n\ntheir electoral base.      In doing so, it ignores that the concept of\n\n\"primary jurisdiction\" is found nowhere in Texas law.                     It also\n\n\n\n\n      83\n        Before the Supreme Court's decision in Houston Lawyers'\nAssociation v. Attorney General of Texas, 111 S. Ct. 2376 (1991),\ncourts considered, in the liability phase of a section 2 case,\nonly whether the state's interest in the current electoral scheme\nwas tenuous. Although I have some questions as to whether the\nCourt, in Houston Lawyers' Association, meant to change the\ninquiry and require proven vote dilution to be balanced against\nnon-tenuous state interests, see LULAC III, 986 F.2d at 757-64, I\nrecognize that the Court's opinion in that case can be read to\nrequire such balancing. See also Robert B. McDuff, Judicial\nElections and the Voting Rights Act, 38 LOY. L. REV. 931, 958-60\n(1993).\n\n                                       210\n\fignores that any historical insistence on \"linkage\" has been\n\nseriously undermined in recent years--and in recent weeks.\n\n     As discussed in my earlier opinion, state district judges in\n\nTexas do not have \"primary jurisdiction\" that is co-extensive with\n\na county.       See LULAC III, 986 F.2d at 767; see also McDuff, supra\n\nnote 21, at 956-57.        They may have primary venue responsibility\n\nthat coincides with county lines, but a state district judge has\n\nstate-wide jurisdiction.        See TEX. CONST. art. V, § 8.     For example,\n\na state district judge elected only by the voters of Travis County\n\nhas the power to declare unconstitutional the entire state's method\n\nof financing public schools.            See Edgewood Indep. Sch. Dist. v.\n\nKirby,    777    S.W.2d   391   (Tex.    1989)   (affirming    trial   court's\n\ndecision).      Thus, it is misleading for the majority to insist that\n\nTexas links the \"primary jurisdiction\" of district court judges\n\nwith their electoral base.        Indeed, the very opposite is the case:\n\na Texas district judge's jurisdiction extends far beyond his or her\n\nelectoral base.       The majority is saying no more than that Texas'\n\nelectoral districts, which are no smaller than a county, usually\n\ncoincide with the venue unit under Texas law, which is also the\n\ncounty.\n\n     Moreover, Texas does not insist that its district judges be\n\nelected from an area no smaller than a county.                Since 1985, the\n\nTexas Constitution has specifically authorized the voters of a\n\ncounty to decide to elect their district judges from an area\n\nsmaller than a county.          See TEX. CONST. art. V, §§ 7, 7a.        Texas\n\nalso makes extensive use of visiting and retired judges, thus\n\n\n                                        211\n\findicating its willingness to use judges who either were not\n\nelected at all or whose electoral base is not at all linked to some\n\namorphous concept of \"primary jurisdiction.\"         See LULAC III, 986\n\nF.2d at 768.   Also relevant in this regard is the State of Texas'\n\nwillingness to settle this lawsuit, which is discussed more fully\n\nin Part II infra.    The Governor, the Attorney General, and the\n\nelected representatives    of   the   people   of   the   state   have   all\n\nexpressed approval of a settlement calling for the election of\n\ndistrict judges from areas that are smaller than a county.           These\n\nrecent events undoubtedly call into question the State of Texas'\n\ninsistence on linkage.\n\n     2.   Questioning the Value of Linkage\n\n     Even if the State of Texas did consistently link a district\n\njudge's electoral base with venue, there is a serious question as\n\nto whether such insistence on linkage would in fact advance Texas'\n\ninterests in judicial accountability and independence. The reality\n\nis that Texas's venue rules do not, and were not meant to, ensure\n\nthe accountability of judges.      Moreover, there are flaws in the\n\nassumptions underlying majority's assertion that linkage serves to\n\nadvance the independence and fairness of district judges.\n\n     I do not see, and the majority does not explain, how linking\n\nelectoral base with venue advances the State of Texas' interest in\n\njudicial accountability.   If linkage did advance such an interest,\n\none might expect the state's venue rules to reflect this purpose.\n\nAs previously noted, however,\n\n     The Texas venue rules have not been drafted to insure\n     that parties appear before judges for whom they have had\n\n                                  212\n\f       an opportunity to vote. Instead, the venue rules for\n       lawsuits involving living persons. . . \"were, in the\n       main,   manifestly    adopted   to    prevent   serious\n       inconveniences and probable injury to defendants. . . .\n       Snyder v. Pitts, 150 Tex. 407, 241 S.W.2d 136, 142\n       (1951).\n\nLULAC III, 986 F.2d at 768.             Moreover, given the unusually large\n\nsize of the election districts in several of the counties at issue\n\nin this case, it strains credibility to maintain that linkage\n\nadvances the state's interest in judicial accountability.                           As\n\nseveral of the defense witnesses at trial testified, most people\n\nhave   no    idea   of   who    they    are     voting    for   in   district   court\n\nelections.        These observations suggest that linkage in the large\n\ncounties at issue in this case, rather than advancing the value of\n\njudicial accountability, actually detracts from it.                   See also H.J.\n\nof TEX, 73d Leg., R.S. 479, 482 (1993) (Address of Chief Justice\n\nThomas R. Phillips) (arguing that retention elections should be\n\nused to enhance the accountability of judges and suggesting that,\n\nunder the current system, \"the people have no meaningful vote\").\n\n       As for the State of Texas' interest in judicial independence,\n\nlinkage advances it, if at all, only marginally.                       What ensures\n\njudicial independence are the integrity of individual judges and\n\nthe Texas Code of Judicial Conduct, which directs judges not to be\n\nswayed      \"by   partisan      interests,       public    clamor,     or   fear   of\n\ncriticism.\"       TEX. CODE    OF   JUDICIAL CONDUCT, Canon 3, pt. A(1).           The\n\nargument that linkage advances the State of Texas' interest in\n\njudicial independence is, at bottom, a smokescreen:                     It suggests\n\nthat district judges who are currently elected by white majorities,\n\noften with the substantial support of plaintiffs' lawyers, defense\n\n                                          213\n\flawyers, or some other interest group, are responsive to the needs\n\nof all voters in the county--including minority voters.                 Yet it\n\nassumes that a judge elected from a majority-minority district\n\nwould somehow be less willing to follow his or her oath or to be\n\nresponsive to the needs of all.         There is absolutely no evidence in\n\nthe record to support such an assumption.              See also McDuff, supra\n\nnote 21, at 949 (\"Of course, absolutely no reason exists to believe\n\nthat black judges elected from majority black districts or Hispanic\n\njudges elected from majority Hispanic districts will be any more\n\n`partisan advocates' than the white judges presently elected from\n\nmajority white districts.\").\n\n     3.        The Existence of Less Intrusive Means\n\n     Finally, Texas' linkage interest is weakened by the existence\n\nof less intrusive means.           I am referring specifically to the\n\npossible use of limited or cumulative voting.                   Both of these\n\nmethods of election would preserve the link, to the extent there is\n\nany, between a district judge's electoral base and his or her area\n\nof primary venue responsibility.          It would also serve, at least to\n\nthe same extent as the current method of electing judges, Texas'\n\ninterests in having accountable and independent judges.\n\n     The majority's refuses to consider cumulative and limited\n\nvoting    as    a   less   intrusive   means.     It   argues   that,   because\n\n\"[l]imited and cumulative voting are election mechanisms that\n\npreserve at-large elections,\" they \"are not `remedies' for the\n\nparticular structural problem that the plaintiffs have chosen to\n\nattack.\"       Majority Opinion at 103.         Thus, the majority decides,\n\n\n                                       214\n\f\"[w]e will not discount [the state's] interest based upon purported\n\nremedies that preserve the challenged at-large scheme.\"              Id.\n\n     The majority misses the point.         The Plaintiffs in this case\n\nallege that Texas' current method of electing district judges in\n\ncounty-wide elections dilutes their voting strength.            Contrary to\n\nthe majority's      hypertechnical    argument,   cumulative    or    limited\n\nvoting would remove the dilutive aspect of the current at-large\n\nsystem, which is what the Plaintiffs are challenging.                That it\n\nwould     also   preserve   county-wide    elections   merely    serves    to\n\ndemonstrate that it is a less intrusive means for advancing Texas'\n\nasserted interests. The majority's refusal to consider these other\n\nmeans, in determining the weight of the state's interests, is\n\nindefensible.84\n\n     4.      The Nature of Texas' Linkage Interest\n\n     Contrary to the majority's assertions, Texas' interest in\n\nlinking the electoral base of its judges with venue is not a\n\ndecision about what constitutes a state district court judge;\n\nindeed, it is nothing more than a decision about how to elect\n\ndistrict court judges.        The state's insistence on linking the\n\nelectoral base of district judges with their area of primary venue\n\n\n     84\n       Even Chief Justice Phillips has publicly recognized that\na system using limited and cumulative voting could remedy the\ndilutive aspect of Texas' current at-large election system. In\nhis recent State of the Judiciary Address, he noted that\n\"[m]inority voters could be protected by any method which permits\nvotes to be aggregated or limits each voter to fewer votes than\nthe number of positions to be filled.\" H.J. OF TEX., 73d Leg.,\nR.S. 479, 483 (1993). He further stated that, \"[w]hile little\nused in judicial elections, such procedures have long been used\nin both public and private elections around the world.\" Id.\n\n                                     215\n\fresponsibility has, in recent years and recent weeks, almost\n\nevaporated, and there are serious doubts as to whether linkage in\n\nfact    advances    the     values     of    judicial    accountability      and\n\nindependence.      Further, there are other means to preserve the so-\n\ncalled linkage interest.        Unlike the majority, then, I cannot say\n\nthat the State of Texas' interest in linkage--which is simply a\n\nshort-hand way of referring to its interest in maintaining the\n\nstatus quo--is anything like Missouri's decision in Gregory about\n\nthe qualifications of a state judge.\n\n       I would therefore hold that the state's interest in linking\n\nthe    electoral   base    of   its    judges   with    their   primary    venue\n\nresponsibility,     allegedly     to   foster   judicial    independence     and\n\naccountability, is little more than tenuous. At best, the argument\n\nis about appearances.       At worst, it exhibits an unfounded fear of\n\nhaving judges elected from majority-minority districts.                   In any\n\nevent, the majority's conclusion that this interest is substantial\n\nis not founded in the record, in Texas law, or in reality.                    It\n\ncould not outweigh the evidence of vote dilution in this case even\n\nif that evidence were only weak, which it manifestly is not.\n\n\n\n                          II.   THE MOTION TO REMAND\n\n       Given the majority's misguided and destructive efforts on the\n\nmerits of this case, one might reasonably ask why the Plaintiffs\n\nand the State of Texas, acting through its Attorney General, were\n\nnot given the opportunity to settle this dispute.                The majority\n\noffers three reasons: First, the majority suggests that the motion\n\n\n                                       216\n\fto remand should be denied because the Texas Attorney General is\n\nsomehow acting beyond the scope of his authority.      The majority\n\nalso makes a related argument that the motion must be denied\n\nbecause not all of the \"defendants\" have consented to the remand or\n\nto the proposed settlement.     Finally, the majority declines to\n\nremand for a hearing on the proposed settlement on the ground that\n\nthe settlement is inconsistent with state law.\n\n     As explained below, none of the reasons proffered by the\n\nmajority precludes a remand for purposes of conducting a settlement\n\nhearing.   That is, the majority could have easily remanded this\n\ncase, but chose not to because it wanted to reach the merits of\n\nthis case and overhaul the Voting Rights Act.      I cannot embrace\n\nsuch reasoning.\n\nA.   Does the Attorney General Have the Authority to Settle this\n     Lawsuit?\n\n     In suggesting that the Texas Attorney General is acting beyond\n\nthe scope of his authority by agreeing to the proposed settlement\n\nand requesting a remand, the majority misperceives the nature of\n\nthe Attorney General's status in this lawsuit.        That is, the\n\nmajority treats the Attorney General as just another lawyer who is\n\nrepresenting the various officials named as defendants.         The\n\nAttorney General, however, is not just another lawyer; he is also\n\na named defendant, as well as the chief legal officer for the State\n\nof Texas in this litigation.   As such, he had the power under Texas\n\nlaw to negotiate and execute the proposed settlement and to request\n\na remand of this case.\n\n\n\n                                 217\n\f     1.   The Nature of this Lawsuit\n\n     The majority correctly notes that the Plaintiffs in this case\n\nfiled suit   against   the   Attorney   General   of   Texas,   the   Texas\n\nSecretary of State, and the members of the Texas Judicial Districts\n\nBoard (including the Board's chairman, Chief Justice Phillips).\n\nThese defendants were not named in their individual capacities, but\n\nonly in their official capacities.      The Plaintiffs were apparently\n\nrequired to do this under the Supreme Court's Eleventh Amendment\n\njurisprudence--specifically, under the fiction of Ex Parte Young,\n\n209 U.S. 123 (1908), which holds that a suit for declaratory and\n\ninjunctive relief against state officers does not constitute a suit\n\nagainst the state for Eleventh Amendment immunity purposes.85\n\n     85\n       The general rule is that, for purposes of determining\nwhether a suit in federal court is barred by the Eleventh\nAmendment, an official-capacity lawsuit is a suit against the\nstate itself rather than a suit against the named official. In\nKentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 165-66 (1985), the Court\nexplained:\n\n     Personal-capacity suits seek to impose personal\n     liability upon a government official for actions he\n     takes under color of state law. See, e.g., Scheuer v.\n     Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 237-38 (1974). Official-capacity\n     suits, in contrast, \"generally represent only another\n     way of pleading an action against an entity of which an\n     officer is an agent.\" Monell v. New York City Dept. of\n     Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 690 n.55 (1978). As\n     long as the government entity receives notice and an\n     opportunity to respond, an official-capacity suit is,\n     in all respects other than name, to be treated as a\n     suit against the entity. Brandon [v. Holt, 469 U.S.\n     464, 471-72 (1985)]. It is not a suit against the\n     official personally, for the real party in interest is\n     the entity.\n\n(emphasis in original). Official-capacity lawsuits, because they\nare in essence lawsuits against the state, are generally barred\nby the Eleventh Amendment. See Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. at\n167 n.14 (\"Unless a State has waived its Eleventh Amendment\n\n                                  218\n\f     Jurisdictional fictions notwithstanding, I would hold that, at\n\nleast for purposes of determining whether this case should be\n\nremanded, this is a suit against the State of Texas itself.\n\nIndeed, in one of our previous opinions, we recognized that the\n\nPlaintiffs sued \"Texas through its officials.\"        League of United\n\nLatin American Citizens, Council No. 4434 v. Clements, 923 F.2d\n\n365, 367 (5th Cir. 1991) (Gee, J.) (en banc); see also id. (again\n\nrecognizing that the \"defendant\" in this case is \"the state\").\n\nGiven the fact that section 2 only prohibits a \"State or political\n\nsubdivision\"   from   employing    certain   voting    practices   and\n\nprocedures, see 42 U.S.C. § 1973(a), our recognition that this\n\nlawsuit was in all aspects (other than for Eleventh Amendment\n\n\n\nimmunity or Congress has overridden it, . . . a State cannot be\nsued directly in its own name regardless of the relief sought.\")\n(citing Alabama v. Pugh, 438 U.S. 781 (1978)).\n     There is an exception to this rule. Specifically, \"[i]n an\ninjunctive or declaratory action grounded on federal law, the\nState's immunity can be overcome by naming state officials as\ndefendants.\" Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. at 169 n.18. As the\nSupreme Court itself has recognized, this exception is based\npurely upon a legal fiction. See, e.g., Pennsylvania v.

See Young, 209 U.S. at 159-60. Thus,\nunder the Young fiction, \"official capacity actions for\nprospective relief are not treated as actions against the State\"\nfor purposes of the Eleventh Amendment. Kentucky v. Graham, 473\nU.S. at 167 n.14. But see also Diamond v. Charles, 476 U.S. 54,\n57 n.2 (1986) (noting, in context of suit against state officials\nfor declaratory and injunctive relief, that \"[a] suit against a\nstate officer in his official capacity is, of course, a suit\nagainst the State\").\n\n                                  219\n\fpurposes) filed against the State of Texas was entirely warranted.\n\nSee also League of United Latin American Citizens, Council No. 4434\n\nv. Clements, 884 F.2d 185, 189 (5th Cir. 1989) (\"A voting rights\n\ncase challenges the election process rather than the individuals\n\nholding offices.\") (emphasis added).\n\n     This case is not, therefore, like Public Utility Comm'n of\n\nTexas v. Cofer, 754 S.W.2d 121 (Tex. 1988), where the Attorney\n\nGeneral's clients--two state agencies which he was obligated to\n\nrepresent under separate statutes86--were on opposing sides of\n\nlitigation in state court.   Thus, it is not a case where we must be\n\nconcerned with possible conflicts of interest.      See id. at 125.\n\nRather, this is a case in which certain officials were named as\n\n\"jurisdictional parties.\"    See Bullock v. Texas Skating Ass'n, 583\n\nS.W.2d 888, 894 (Tex. Civ. App.--Austin 1979, writ ref'd n.r.e.).\n\nIn short, I think that the Attorney General's client in this case\n\nis the State of Texas--not the various officials who were joined\n\nsolely for Eleventh Amendment purposes.\n\n     2.   The Attorney General's Power to Represent the State\n\n     Once it is recognized that the State of Texas and its election\n\nprocess are the real targets of the Plaintiffs' lawsuit, the\n\nquestion then becomes:   Who is authorized to represent state and\n\n     86\n       See TEX. REV. CIV. STAT. ANN. art. 601b, § 10.11 (Vernon\nSupp. 1987) (providing that the attorney general \"shall represent\nthe [State Purchasing and General Services Commission] before the\ncourts in all appeals from rate cases in which the commission\nintervenes\"); TEX. REV. CIV STAT. ANN. art. 1446c, § 15 (Vernon\nSupp. 1987) (providing that the attorney general shall represent\nthe Public Utilities Commission \"in all matters before the state\ncourts, and in any court of the United States, and before any\nfederal public utility regulatory commission\").\n\n                                 220\n\fprotect its interests?        The answer is supplied by state law.            Cf.\n\nNew York v. Uplinger, 467 U.S. 246, 248 (1984) (\"The allocation of\n\nauthority among state officers to represent the State before this\n\nCourt is, of course, wholly a matter of state concern.).\n\n     The State of Texas, through constitutional and statutory law,\n\nhas appointed the Attorney General to represent its interests in\n\nlitigation such as this.87         The Texas Constitution specifically\n\nprovides that the Attorney General \"shall represent the State in\n\nall suits and pleas in the Supreme Court of the State in which the\n\nState     may   be   a   party.\"    TEX.      CONST.   art   IV,   §   22.    The\n\ninterpretative       commentary    to    this    provision    notes    that   the\n\n\"attorney general is the chief law officer of the state\" and has\n\nthe responsibility of \"representing the state in civil litigation.\"\n\nId., interp. commentary (emphasis added).                The Texas Government\n\nCode is similarly explicit in naming the Attorney General to speak\n\nfor the state. It provides: \"The attorney general shall prosecute\n\nand defend all actions in which the state is interested before the\n\nsupreme court and courts of appeals.\"            TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 402.021\n\n(Vernon 1990).\n\n     Contrary to the majority's assertions, the Texas Attorney\n\nGeneral is not just another lawyer.             Unlike an ordinary lawyer he\n\nis entitled and obligated by law to represent his client, the\n\n\n\n     87\n       As explained more fully below, district attorneys and\ncounty attorneys also have the authority to represent the state\nin some circumstances. See TEX. CONST. art. V, § 21; see also\nBaker v. Wade, 769 F.2d 289, 291 (5th Cir. 1985), cert. denied,\n478 U.S. 1022 (1986).\n\n                                        221\n\fstate.   The Texas Supreme Court recognized as much in Maude v.\n\nTerrell, 109 Tex. 97, 200 S.W. 375, 376 (1918), when it explained:\n\n     [T]he powers thus conferred by the Constitution upon [the\n     Attorney General and the county and district attorneys]\n     are exclusive. The Legislature cannot devolve them upon\n     others. Nor can it interfere with the right to exercise\n     them. It may provide assistance for the proper discharge\n     by these officials of their duties, but since in the\n     matter of prosecuting the pleas of the State in the\n     courts the powers reposed in them are exclusive in their\n     nature, it cannot, for the performance of that function,\n     obtrude other persons upon them and compel the acceptance\n     of their services. Wherever provision is made for the\n     services of other persons for that express purpose, it is\n     the constitutional right of the Attorney-General and the\n     county and district attorneys to decline them or not at\n     their discretion, and, if availed of, the services are to\n     be rendered in subordination to their authority.\n\n(internal citations omitted); see also Hill v. Texas Water Quality\n\nBoard, 568 S.W.2d 738, 741 (Tex. Civ. App.--Austin 1978, writ ref'd\n\nn.r.e.) (\"[E]ither the Attorney General or a county or district\n\nattorney may represent the State in a particular situation, but\n\nthese are the only choices[;] whichever official represents the\n\nState exercises exclusive authority and if services of other\n\nlawyers are     utilized   they   must    be   `in   subordination'   to   his\n\nauthority.\").     Moreover, the Texas Attorney General has broad\n\ndiscretion to control litigation strategy where he is representing\n\nthe state.    Indeed, in Charles Scribner's Sons v. Marrs, 114 Tex.\n\n11, 262 S.W. 722, 727 (1924), the Texas Supreme Court stated that,\n\n\"[e]ven in the matter of bringing suits, the Attorney General must\n\nexercise judgment and discretion, which will not be controlled by\n\nother authorities.\"    See also Bullock v. Texas Skating Ass'n, 583\n\nS.W.2d at 894.\n\n\n\n                                    222\n\f     Despite this language from the highest court in Texas, the\n\nmajority insists that the Attorney General is not the exclusive\n\nrepresentative of the State of Texas in matters of litigation. The\n\nmajority    curiously   finds   compelling   Chief   Justice   Phillips'\n\nargument that, as Chairman of the Judicial Districts Board, \"he has\n\nthe authority to defend this lawsuit if the Attorney General will\n\nnot.\"     Majority Opinion at 12.88   In support of this finding, the\n\nmajority relies heavily on our en banc decision in Baker v. Wade,\n\n769 F.2d 289 (5th Cir. 1985) (en banc), cert. denied, 478 U.S. 1022\n\n\n     88\n       I say \"curiously\" because Chief Justice Phillips has\nnever sought to represent the interests of the state in this\nappeal. At oral argument, when he was specifically asked whether\nhe was seeking to represent the state on appeal from the\nliability decision, Chief Justice Phillips said that he was not.\nThat is, he made it clear that his complaints go only to the\nspecifics of the proposed settlement--not to the idea of settling\nthis case in general. Indeed, in a speech to the Texas\nlegislature, Chief Justice Phillips conceded that, regardless of\nthe outcome in this litigation, the current system of electing\ndistrict judges is indefensible. He explained:\n\n     Let there be no mistake: the current at-large system\n     is no longer acceptable. In Dallas County, 37% of the\n     people, but less than 14% of the judges, are African-\n     American or Hispanic. In Harris County, 42% of the\n     people, but less than 9% of the judges, are from the\n     same minority populations. Candidates from these\n     racial and ethnic groups have often been defeated in\n     campaigns for benches in those counties. The federal\n     courts may ultimately hold that the evidence presented\n     in pending litigation is insufficient to demonstrate\n     that the system is illegal, but they cannot make it\n     fair or right. The status quo is unjust and\n     inequitable.\n\nH.J. OF TEX., 73d Leg., R.S. 479, 482 (1993) (Address of Chief\nJustice Thomas R. Phillips); see also id. at 481 (\"One thing can\nbe said with confidence about our current system of choosing\njudges: No one likes it.\").\n\n\n\n                                   223\n\f(1986), where we permitted a state district attorney to represent\n\nthe State of Texas' interests on appeal after the Attorney General\n\ndeclined to do so.\n\n       The majority's reliance on Baker is wholly misplaced.                   In\n\nallowing a state district attorney to intervene on appeal and\n\ndefend    the    constitutionality   of    Texas'    sodomy      statute,   Judge\n\nReavley emphasized the narrowness of the decision.                    Among other\n\nthings, he noted that, \"as of the date of the entry of the district\n\ncourt's judgment, [the state district attorney] was a member of the\n\n[defendant] class, was enjoined by that judgment, and as district\n\nattorney was a proper official under Texas law to represent the\n\nstate.\"    Id.    at 291 (emphasis added) (citing TEX. CONST. art. V, §\n\n21).     In this case, by contrast, Chief Justice Phillips is not a\n\nproper official under Texas law to represent the state.                   Indeed,\n\nthe majority has pointed to no provision of Texas law, and I can\n\nfind none, that would even arguably allow the members of the Texas\n\nJudicial Districts board to represent the interests of the state in\n\nlitigation.\n\n       Thus, our decision in Baker is consistent with Texas law,\n\nwhich provides that \"either the Attorney General or a county or\n\ndistrict    attorney    may   represent     the     State   in    a    particular\n\nsituation.\"      See Hill v. Texas Water Quality Board, 568 S.W.2d at\n\n741.     The majority opinion, on the other hand, ignores Texas law\n\nwhen it refuses to recognize that \"these are the only choices.\" Id.\n\nUnlike the majority, then, I would hold that the Attorney General\n\n\n\n\n                                     224\n\fhas the exclusive authority to represent the interests of the state\n\nin this litigation.\n\n       3.   The Attorney General's Power to Settle on Behalf of the\n            State\n\n       The majority's failure to perceive the nature of this lawsuit,\n\nas well as its failure to understand the broad and exclusive powers\n\nof the Texas Attorney General, ultimately leads it to suggest that\n\nthe Attorney General in this case has acted beyond his authority in\n\napproving the settlement and asking for a remand.           I reject this\n\nsuggestion.\n\n       In Terrazas v. Ramirez, 829 S.W.2d 712 (Tex. 1991), seven of\n\nnine   members   of   the   Texas   Supreme   Court   rejected   a   similar\n\nargument.     In particular, they rejected an argument that the\n\nAttorney General lacked the power to negotiate and execute a\n\nsettlement agreement on behalf of the state.           A plurality of the\n\ncourt, consisting of Justice Hecht, Chief Justice Phillips, and\n\nJustice Cook, reasoned as follows:\n\n       The Attorney General, as the chief legal officer of the\n       State, has broad discretionary power in conducting his\n       legal duty and responsibility to represent the State.\n       This discretion includes the authority to propose a\n       settlement agreement in an action attacking the\n       constitutionality of a reapportionment statute.       The\n       Attorney General has participated in such settlements on\n       previous occasions.     Although the Attorney General\n       appears to have acted throughout this litigation only on\n       behalf of the state defendants and not for himself, he\n       had the authority, certainly for his clients and even on\n       his own, to suggest possible remedies after the district\n       court rendered an interlocutory summary judgment holding\n       Senate Bill 31 unconstitutional. He also had the power\n       to negotiate a settlement with the plaintiffs and to\n       execute an agreement with them. To hold that he did not\n       would be to give him less authority than any party or any\n       other attorney participating in the case.\n\n\n                                     225\n\fId.   at   721-22     (internal      citations      omitted)     (emphasis   added).\n\nJustice Hightower and Justice Gammage, dissenting on other grounds,\n\nrecognized    that     the    \"Attorney        General,     in   carrying    out     his\n\nconstitutional responsibility to represent the interests of the\n\nstate, has discretionary power to settle lawsuits on behalf of the\n\nstate so long as he does not usurp the authority of a co-equal\n\ndepartment of government.\"             Id. at 753 (Hightower, J., joined by\n\nGammage, J., dissenting). In a separate dissent, Justice Mauzy and\n\nJustice     Doggett    made        similar     statements    about    the    Attorney\n\nGeneral's power to settle lawsuits.                See id. at 746-47 (Mauzy, J.,\n\njoined by     Doggett,       J.,    dissenting).       Thus,     as   Justice    Mauzy\n\ncorrectly noted, seven justices agreed that \"[t]he [A]ttorney\n\n[G]eneral is constitutionally empowered to execute a settlement\n\nagreement in litigation challenging a legislative redistricting\n\nplan.\"     Id. at 747.\n\n      Consistently with the Texas Supreme Court's disposition in\n\nTerrazas, I would hold that the Texas Attorney General acted within\n\nhis power as the chief legal officer of the state by executing the\n\nproposed settlement and, thereafter, by requesting a remand.                         This\n\nlawsuit is, for all practical purposes, a suit against the State of\n\nTexas, and the decisions by the Attorney General in this regard are\n\nquintessential decisions about how to protect the state's interests\n\nin    litigation--decisions            which,      under    Texas     law,      he    is\n\nconstitutionally empowered to make on behalf of the state.89\n\n      89\n       I recognize, of course, that the mere fact that the\nAttorney General has executed a settlement agreement on behalf of\nthe state will not support the entry of a consent decree. The\n\n                                             226\n\fB.   Who Must Consent to the Settlement?\n\n     The majority also offers a second ground for refusing to\n\nremand the case for a hearing on the proposed settlement:             that not\n\nall of the \"defendants\" have consented to the remand or to the\n\nsettlement.     In particular, the majority argues that, because the\n\ntwo intervening district judges, Judge Wood and Judge Entz, as well\n\nas Chief Justice Phillips, object to the settlement, the settlement\n\ncould   not   be   approved   and   therefore   the   case   should    not   be\n\nremanded.     Again, I disagree.    In my view, by obtaining the consent\n\nof the Texas legislature, the Texas Attorney General did as much as\n\n(or perhaps more than) he was required to do under Texas law.\n\n\n\n\ndistrict court must hold a hearing on the propriety of the\nsettlement and consider the objections of all interested parties.\nBut the Plaintiffs and the State of Texas are not asking this\ncourt to enter a decree based on the specific settlement that the\nAttorney General negotiated and approved. Rather, they are only\nrequesting a remand on the basis of the parties' expressed desire\nto settle this lawsuit.\n     I also am aware that, under Texas law, \"[a]n admission,\nagreement, or waiver made by the attorney general in an action or\nsuit to which the state is a party does not prejudice the rights\nof the state.\" TEX. GOV'T. CODE. ANN. § 402.004 (Vernon 1990).\nHowever, \"the weight of authorities interpreting section 402.004\nshows it to be a legislative limitation on the affirmative powers\nand discretion granted to the attorney general.\" Texas Dep't of\nHuman Servs. v. Green, 855 S.W.2d 136 (Tex. App.--Austin 1993,\nn.w.h.). That is, the section has not been construed to limit\nthe Attorney General's constitutional authority to propose,\nnegotiate, and execute settlement agreements on behalf of the\nState of Texas--despite arguments to the contrary. See Terrazas,\n829 S.W.2d at 728 n.5, 733 n.5 (concurring opinions of Justice\nGonzalez and Cornyn); see also Executive Condominiums, Inc. v.\nState, 764 S.W.2d 899, 902 (Corpus Christi 1989, writ denied)\n(rejecting argument that section 402.004 prevented Attorney\nGeneral from compromising and settling claims on behalf of the\nstate).\n\n                                     227\n\f     1.     Not the Intervening Judges\n\n     Judge Wood and Judge Entz's objections to the settlement do\n\nnot preclude a remand.              The Supreme Court's decision in Local\n\nNumber    93,     International      Ass'n    of     Firefighters     v.   City   of\n\nCleveland, 478 U.S. 501 (1986), could not be clearer on this point.\n\nThere, the court held that a union, who intervened as a matter of\n\nright, could not block the entry of a consent decree merely by\n\nwithholding its consent to the settlement.               The Court stated:\n\n     It has never been supposed that one party--whether an\n     original party, a party that was joined later, or an\n     intervenor--could preclude other parties from settling\n     their own disputes and thereby withdrawing from\n     litigation. Thus, while an intervenor is entitled to\n     present evidence and have its objections heard at the\n     hearing on whether to approve a consent decree, it does\n     not have power to block the decree merely by withholding\n     its consent.\n\nId. at 528-29.\n\n     Admittedly, a court may not enter a consent decree which has\n\nthe effect of disposing \"of the valid claims of nonconsenting\n\nintervenors.\"         Id. at 529.   Nor may a court \"enter a consent decree\n\nthat imposes obligations on a party that did not consent to the\n\ndecree.\"        Id.     But these concerns are not implicated by the\n\nsettlement proposed in this case.\n\n     The proposed settlement agreement in this case does not\n\ndispose of the \"valid claims\" of Judge Wood and Judge Entz.                    They\n\nare only permissive intervenors.              See New Orleans Public Serv.,\n\nInc. v. United Gas Pipe Line Co., 732 F.2d 452, 463 (5th Cir.),\n\ncert. denied, 469 U.S. 1019 (1984); see also Clements v. League of\n\nUnited    Latin       American   Citizens,     884     F.2d   at    187    (equating\n\n\n                                        228\n\fintervenor of right with \"real party in interest\").   As such, they\n\ndo not have the status of an original party.90   Moreover, as I read\n\nthe record, they were permitted to intervene only to protect their\n\ntenure as sitting elected judges.91 Thus, although I agree with the\n\n     90\n       Indeed, in the context of discussing the rights of a\npermissive intervenor, this court has stated:\n\n     [T]he [permissive] intervenor's mere presence in an\n     action does not clothe it with the status of an\n     original party. To be sure, there are some senses in\n     which an \"intervenor is treated as if he were an\n     original party and has equal standing with the original\n     parties.\" The permissive intervenor can, among other\n     things, move to dismiss the proceeding and can\n     challenge the subject matter jurisdiction of the\n     district court. But these participatory rights remain\n     subject to the intervenor's threshold dependency on the\n     original parties' claims, for it is equally well-\n     settled that \"[a]n existing suit within the court's\n     jurisdiction is a prerequisite of an intervention,\n     which is an ancillary proceeding in an already\n     instituted suit.\"\n\nHarris v. Amoco Production Co., 768 F.2d 669, 675 (5th Cir. 1985)\n(emphasis added) (internal citations omitted), cert. denied, 475\nU.S. 1011 (1986); see also Kirkland v. New York State Dep't of\nCorrectional Servs., 711 F.2d 1117, 1126 (2d Cir. 1983) (\"[T]he\nsum of rights possessed by an intervenor, even if granted\nunconditional intervention, is not necessarily equivalent to that\nof a party in a case and depends upon the nature of the\nintervenor's interest.\"), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1005 (1984).\n     91\n       The majority concludes that Judge Wood and Judge Entz\nwere also permitted to intervene in their capacity as voters of\nHarris and Dallas county. The record belies this conclusion.\n     In her motion to intervene filed in the district court,\nJudge Wood asserted:\n\n     As a state district judge, duly elected at large in\n     November, 1988, to a four-year term of office in an\n     expressly targeted county, Harris County District Judge Wood\n     has a direct and substantial interest in the outcome of this\n     suit in both her personal and her official capacity in that\n     she stands to have here election declared null and void and\n     her tenure in office drastically truncated should Plaintiffs\n     obtain the relief they seek.\n\n\n                                229\n\fmajority that the intervening judges do not, at this time, have to\n\nindependently satisfy article III standing requirements,92 their\n\n\nIn support of her motion, Judge Wood cited Williams v. State\nBoard of Elections, 696 F. Supp. 1563 (N.D. Ill. 1988), a case\ndealing specifically with whether sitting elected judges should\nbe joined as necessary parties in a section 2 case challenging\njudicial elections. At no point in her motion, or in her\nsupporting memorandum, does Judge Wood assert that she is\nentitled or should be allowed to intervene as a voter. In fact,\nshe does not allege that she is a registered voter of Harris\nCounty. Thus, unlike the majority, I cannot say that she was\npermitted to intervene as a registered voter.\n     In his motion to intervene, Judge Entz similarly focuses his\narguments on why he should be allowed to intervene as a sitting\nelected judge of Dallas County. He also alleges that he is a\nresident of Dallas County and is duly qualified and registered to\nvote in the county. He then states, that \"as such\" he has an\n\"interest in the fair administration of justice in Dallas County\nand the selection of a qualified judiciary.\" However, in his\nsupporting memorandum, he never again mentions his status as a\nvoter. Rather, like Judge Wood, he relies solely on the Williams\ncase to support his motion to intervene. Therefore, I am unable\nto conclude that he was permitted to intervene to protect his\ninterest--if, indeed, he has any such interest--in voting for all\nof the judges in Dallas County.\n     92\n       Had the Attorney General moved to dismiss the notice of\nappeal filed on behalf of the State of Texas, however, we might\nbe presented with another situation entirely. See Diamond v.\nCharles, 476 U.S. 54 (1986). The majority does not think so,\nbut, in my view, there are serious questions about whether Judge\nWood and Judge Entz, as sitting elected judges, would have\nstanding to maintain an appeal from an order which only declares\nthe current method of electing judges to be illegal. Moreover,\neven assuming that they were allowed to intervene as registered\nvoters, I have reservations about the correctness of the Eleventh\nCircuit's decision in Meek v. Metropolitan Dade County, 985 F.2d\n1471 (11th Cir. 1993), which held that voters had standing to\nintervene and independently appeal from a district court's\ndecision declaring Dade County's at-large election scheme\ninvalid. The question in such cases is not whether white voters\nsuch as Judge Wood and Judge Entz, who seek to defend the status\nquo, would have standing to file a claim under section 2, but\nwhether they would have standing to attack the order of the\ndistrict court--that is, whether they have suffered an injury in\nfact as a result of the district court's liability decision. See\nSierra Club v. Babbitt, 995 F.2d 571 (5th Cir. 1993) (\"Where\nstanding to appeal is at issue, appellants must demonstrate some\ninjury from the judgment below.\") (emphasis in original).\n\n                               230\n\fmere status in this lawsuit as permissive intervenors does not, in\n\nmy view, serve to give them \"claims\" or \"defenses\" in the sense\n\ncontemplated by Firefighters.\n\n      Nor does the proposed settlement place any \"obligations\" on\n\nJudge Wood or Judge Entz.           On the contrary, the settlement has\n\nabsolutely no effect on either the tenure of these judges or the\n\nmanner in which they will be elected in the future.                In addition,\n\nthey are not directed to do anything under the proposed settlement.\n\nCompare Chisom v. Roemer, 970 F.2d 1408 (where settlement at issue\n\nrequired the Louisiana Supreme Court to temporarily assign judge\n\nelected to newly created court of appeals position to the Supreme\n\nCourt), appeal dismissed by, 975 F.2d 1092 (5th Cir. 1992).\n\n      Unlike the majority, therefore, I do not think that the\n\nintervening judges have to power to block the motion to remand or\n\nthe entry of the proposed settlement in this case.             As permissive\n\nintervenors,    they    have   no    \"claims\"    or    \"defenses\"     that   are\n\nadjudicated by the proposed settlement. And even a cursory reading\n\nof   the   proposed    settlement    reveals    that   it   does    not   impose\n\nobligations or duties on the intervening judges.                   Thus, under\n\nFirefighters, their withholding of consent to the motion to remand\n\nis simply irrelevant.\n\n      2.    Not Chief Justice Phillips\n\n      I would also hold that Chief Justice Phillips' objections to\n\nthis particular settlement do not preclude a remand.               As explained\n\nearlier, I do not view this lawsuit as being one against the\n\nvarious named officials, but rather, as one against the State of\n\n\n                                      231\n\fTexas.   And   because   the   Attorney   General   is    the   exclusive\n\nrepresentative of the state in such matters, the consent of Chief\n\nJustice Phillips is not required.\n\n     The Austin appellate court's decision in Bullock v. Texas\n\nSkating Ass'n, which was cited with approval by the plurality\n\nopinion in Terrazas, is particularly instructive.           In this tax\n\nrefund case, the plaintiff, who had prevailed in the lower court,\n\nargued that the Attorney General's notice of appeal should be\n\ndismissed because one of the Attorney General's \"clients\"--namely,\n\nthe Comptroller--had instructed the Attorney General not to file a\n\nnotice of appeal from the adverse decision.              In denying the\n\nplaintiff's motion as meritless, the Bullock court first described\n\nthe status of the various named defendants.           It stated, \"The\n\nAttorney General is a defendant in suits of this type in the same\n\nmanner that the Comptroller and the Treasurer are jurisdictional\n\nparties, although the State of Texas is the actual party in [a]\n\nsuit to recover taxes.\"        583 S.W.2d at 894.        The court then\n\nrejected the plaintiff's argument that \"the Comptroller, in the\n\nexercise of his administrative duties, such as tax refunds, can\n\nbring litigation to a halt at any time.\"     Id.    It explained:\n\n     In this suit the Comptroller obviously exercised his\n     administrative discretion and rejected [the plaintiff's]\n     request for refund of taxes paid under protest; otherwise\n     there would have been no litigation. Thereafter, upon\n     filing of suit, the Comptroller's statutory powers ended.\n     In matters of litigation the Attorney General is the\n     officer authorized by law to protect the interests of the\n     State, and even in matters of bringing suit the Attorney\n     General must exercise judgment and discretion, which will\n     not be controlled by other authorities. It was within\n     the discretion of the Attorney General, not that of the\n     Comptroller, to decide whether to appeal a case in which\n\n                                  232\n\f     the State had experienced an adverse judgment in the\n     trial court. In such matters the Attorney General, not\n     the Comptroller of Public Accounts, is authorized to\n     perform the duties of the State's attorney. The motion\n     to dismiss the appeal is overruled.\n\nId. (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).\n\n     Like the majority, I think that the decision to settle a\n\nlawsuit is, for all practical purposes, indistinguishable from the\n\ndecision to file (or not to file) a notice of appeal.             Unlike the\n\nmajority,   however,   I   also   think   that   the   Attorney   General's\n\ndecision on these issues controls--at least when it does not\n\nconflict with the view of another appropriate representative of the\n\nstate.   See supra Part II.A.2 (discussing Baker v. Wade).           Thus, I\n\ndo not think that Chief Justice Phillips, who is at                  most a\n\n\n\n\n                                    233\n\f\"jurisdictional party,\"93 must consent to a remand before the motion\n\nto remand is granted.94\n\n     3.   Perhaps the Texas Legislature\n\n     In concluding that neither the consent of the intervening\n\njudges nor the consent of Chief Justice Phillips is required, I am\n\nnot unmindful of the potential for state law separation of powers\n\nproblems in cases like these.      See Terrazas, 829 S.W.2d at 720.\n\nNor was the Attorney General unmindful of the potential for such\n\nproblems in this case.    This is why he sought and obtained approval\n\n\n     93\n       As discussed supra Part I.A.1., Chief Justice Phillips\nwas apparently named as a Young defendant--in order to get around\nthe Eleventh Amendment bar to suits brought directly against the\nstate. To come within the rule of Young, however, the officials\nwho are named as defendants \"must have some connection with the\nenforcement\" of the state law being challenged. See Young, 209\nU.S. at 157 (emphasis added). Otherwise, the named official has\nonly been made \"a party as a representative of the state\" in an\n\"attempt[] to make the state a party.\" Id. When officials who\nare not charged with enforcing the challenged state law are\njoined as parties, therefore, the proper course is dismissal.\n     Assuming section 2 does not waive a state's Eleventh\nAmendment immunity, the Plaintiffs correctly named the Texas\nAttorney General and the Secretary of State in their official\ncapacities. After all, both are responsible for enforcing the\ncurrent method of electing district court judges. However, the\nmembers of the Texas Judicial Districts Board (including Chief\nJustice Phillips), have legislative responsibilities--\nresponsibilities that arise only if the Texas legislature fails\nto act. See TEX. CONST. art. 5 § 7a(e). They have no enforcement\nresponsibilities whatsoever. Thus, in my mind there is a\nquestion as to whether the Plaintiffs' action against the members\nof the Judicial Districts Board, including Chief Justice\nPhillips, are barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\n     94\n       I recognize, of course, that the district court would\nhave to conduct an evidentiary hearing on the proposed settlement\nand that Chief Justice Phillips' objections to the proposed\nsettlement would have to be fully aired. The point is that, at\nthis time, all the parties are seeking is a remand; they are not\nseeking this court's stamp of approval on the current proposed\nsettlement.\n\n                                  234\n\fof   the   proposed   settlement   from    both   houses   of    the   Texas\n\nlegislature.\n\n      The majority suggests that, because the Texas legislature\n\ncould not enact the proposed settlement into law, its less formal\n\napproval of the proposed settlement is meaningless.             I disagree.\n\nThe Texas Senate, acting as a Committee of the Whole (which is\n\nauthorized by Texas law), expressed its approval of the proposed\n\nsettlement in the form of a resolution.       The Texas House similarly\n\napproved the proposed settlement through a resolution.             Both of\n\nthese   resolutions    were   \"official\"    expressions    of    the   Texas\n\nlegislature's position on the question of whether this case should\n\nbe settled.\n\n      In my view, these resolutions only reinforce the conclusion\n\nthat the State of Texas has consented to a remand and to entry of\n\nthe proposed settlement.      That two intervening judges and Chief\n\nJustice Phillips, none of whom was elected to represent the state\n\nin matters of litigation, do not consent, only serves to highlight\n\nthe extent to which this lawsuit has become politicized.               Their\n\nfailure to consent does not, however, preclude a remand or the\n\nentry of a settlement agreement.\n\nC.    Can the Proposed Settlement Override State Law?\n\n      Finally, the majority declines to remand this case because the\n\nproposed settlement is inconsistent with state law--specifically,\n\nthe provision of the Texas Constitution that allows judicial\n\ndistricts to be drawn smaller than a county, but only with the\n\napproval of the voters of the county.         See TEX. CONST. art V, §\n\n\n                                   235\n\f7a(i).    The majority holds that, without a final, non-appealable\n\ndecision finding a section 2 violation, voting rights cases cannot\n\nbe settled in a way that is inconsistent with state law.       Once\n\nagain, I must disagree.\n\n     The majority argues that in Chisom v. Roemer, 970 F.2d 1408,\n\n1409 (5th Cir. 1992), where we remanded a case similar to this, we\n\nwere able to remand because the parties brought with them a duly\n\nenacted state law.   Even assuming that the settlement proposed in\n\nChisom was entirely consistent with state law--a matter upon which\n\nwe expressed no opinion95--there is a crucial distinction between\n\nthis case and Chisom:     In Chisom, the district court had found no\n\nsection 2 liability; in this case, by contrast, the district court\n\nfound that the Texas' method of electing district court judges in\n\ncounty-wide elections violated section 2 in each of the nine target\n\ncounties.\n\n     I think the district court's section 2 liability findings\n\nprovide a sufficient basis for remanding the case for a hearing on\n\nthe proposed settlement. Of course, I agree with the majority that\n\nthe district court would not be able to \"merely sign on the line\n\nprovided by the parties.\"      See United States v. City of Miami,\n\n\n     95\n       An argument can be made that the settlement proposed in\nthe Chisom case--a settlement which had the effect of temporarily\nadding an eighth seat to the Louisiana Supreme Court--offended\nthe Louisiana Constitution. See LA. CONST. art. V, § 3 (\"The\nsupreme court shall be composed of a chief justice and six\nassociate justices, four of whom must concur to render\njudgment.\"). As the majority correctly notes, Louisiana's effort\nto amend the constitution to add an extra position had failed.\nSee Majority Opinion at 30 n.19. The point is that, before\nremanding, we never considered this question in Chisom.\n\n                                  236\n\fFlorida, 664 F.2d 435 (Former 5th Cir. 1981) (en banc).        Given the\n\ndetailed section 2 findings already made by the district court,\n\nhowever,   I   do   not   think   that    the   settlement's    apparent\n\ninconsistency with state law is a reason to deny the motion to\n\nremand.\n\n     Our decision in Overton v. City of Austin, 748 F.2d 941 (5th\n\nCir. 1984), rather than arguing against a remand, suggests that a\n\nremand may be particularly appropriate in this case.           There, we\n\nrefused to mandamus a district court to enter a proposed consent\n\ndecree based on a settlement between minority plaintiffs and the\n\nCity of Austin.     We noted that, at the time the settlement was\n\npresented for approval, no evidence of vote dilution had been\n\npresented to the district court.         In holding that the district\n\ncourt did not abuse its wide discretion in refusing to enter the\n\nconsent decree, we concluded that the parties were effectively\n\ntrying to accomplish a result--namely, the amending of Austin's\n\nCity Charter--which they did not have the power to do without a\n\nvote of the people.   We stated:\n\n     Thus,   more  is   necessarily   involved  than  merely\n     ascertaining whether the parties have consented to an\n     ultimate result which is not of itself illegal,\n     unreasonable or unfair.     Absent a properly grounded\n     judicial   determination   that   the  present  charter\n     provisions are illegal, the consent of the parties\n     provides an insufficient basis on which to judicially\n     ordain a different system of council election and\n     composition.\n\n748 F.2d at 956-57 (emphasis added).96\n\n     96\n       Our discussion in Overton, happily enough, is consistent\nwith the Texas Supreme Court's decision in Terrazas. In that\ncase, a plurality of the members of the Texas Supreme Court\n\n                                   237\n\f       When the parties in this case presented their motion to\n\nremand, the case was in a very different posture than the one in\n\nOverton.     There had been lengthy trial, during which time the\n\nPlaintiffs    presented   substantial      evidence   of   vote    dilution.\n\nMoreover, the only decision which still stood was the district\n\ncourt's--i.e., the one holding that Texas' method of electing\n\ndistrict judges in at-large, county-wide elections operates in the\n\nnine target counties to dilute minority voting strength.              In my\n\nview, this decision constitutes a \"properly grounded judicial\n\ndetermination\" that the current system is illegal. It was based on\n\nthe    evidence   presented   at   trial   and   represents   a   reasonable\n\ninterpretation of that evidence. This finding should be sufficient\n\nunder Overton to allow the parties to effectuate a settlement they\n\notherwise would not have the authority to bring about under state\n\nlaw.\n\n\n\n\nrecognized that a state district court could enter a consent\ndecree, based on a settlement between the Attorney General and\nthe plaintiffs, which effectively reapportioned the state\nlegislative districts. It noted, however, that the entry of such\na consent judgment required some procedural regularity (i.e., the\nstate district judge would have to carefully consider the many\ninterests involved, give due deference to the legislature to\nrectify its own statutes, and give due regard for the effect of\nthe order on the election process). See 829 S.W.2d at 718. The\nplurality in Terrazas also suggested that court-ordered\nreapportionment based on such a settlement would be prohibited\nabsent a judicial determination that the current statute was\ninvalid. See id. at 722. Once there is a judicial determination\nthat the current statute is invalid, under the plurality opinion\nin Terrazas, a state district court would be able to enter a\nconsent decree based on a settlement agreement executed by the\nAttorney General. In short, neither Overton nor Terrazas\nrequires a final, non-appealable finding of liability before a\ncourt can override a provision of state law.\n\n                                     238\n\f       Also, because this settlement has been approved by a majority\n\nof both houses of the Texas legislature, I think that the motion to\n\nremand should be taken more seriously than the majority sees fit to\n\ndo. In confronting an analogous situation in Wise v. Lipscomb, 437\n\nU.S. 535, 548 (1978), the Supreme Court approved the decision of\n\nthe Dallas City Council to reapportion itself in response to a\n\ndistrict court finding that the then-existing at-large election\n\nsystem violated the Constitution--despite the fact that the city\n\ncouncil appeared to lack the power to do so under state law.            In a\n\nconcurring opinion, four Justices explained why a federal court was\n\nrequired to show deference to the plan:\n\n       The essential point is that the Dallas City Council\n       exercised a legislative judgment, reflecting the policy\n       choices of the elected representatives of the people,\n       rather than the remedial directive of a federal court .\n       . . . This rule of deference to local legislative\n       judgments remains in force even if . . . our examination\n       of state law suggests that the local body lacks the\n       authority to reapportion itself.\n\nId. at 548. (Powell, J., concurring, joined by Burger, C.J.,\n\nBlackmun, and Rehnquist, JJ.).      Although the resolutions passed by\n\nthe Texas legislature in this case do not have the force of law,\n\nthey    do   represent   an   official    expression     of   the   \"elected\n\nrepresentatives of the people\" of Texas on the questions of whether\n\nand how this case should be settled.\n\n       Ultimately, the majority is able to rely on the settlement's\n\napparent inconsistency with state law as a ground to deny the\n\nmotion to remand because it is convinced \"there is no [section 2]\n\ncase\" here.        Even a cursory review of the record in this case\n\ndiscounts    the    majority's   characterization   of    the   Plaintiffs'\n\n                                    239\n\fevidence of vote dilution.       See generally supra Part I.    But the\n\nmajority's    statement   does    reveal   something   about   its   real\n\nmotivation for denying the motion to remand: its unwavering desire\n\nto reach the merits of this case so that it can overhaul the Voting\n\nRights Act.\n\nD.   The Implications of the Majority's Decision to Deny the Motion\n     to Remand\n\n     In sum, the majority offers three reasons why the motion to\n\nremand filed by the State of Texas and the Plaintiffs in this case\n\nmust be denied. None is persuasive. The majority cannot seriously\n\nargue that the Attorney General has exceeded his authority or that\n\nhe has somehow failed in his duty to represent the interests of the\n\nState of Texas.    And, although the majority correctly notes that\n\nnot all of the nominal \"defendants\" have joined in the motion to\n\nremand, it offers no reason why the case cannot be remanded without\n\nthe consent of the intervening judges and Chief Justice Phillips.\n\nFinally, the majority is able to rely on the fact that the proposed\n\nsettlement is inconsistent with Texas law only by reaching the\n\nmerits of the underlying section 2 dispute--and reversing the\n\ndistrict court on clearly erroneous grounds.\n\n     The majority's rationale for denying the motion to remand will\n\ndiscourage, if not prohibit, the settling of most voting rights\n\ncases.   It will effectively require the consent of all of the\n\nvarious named officials, as well as any party who, for whatever\n\nreason, has been permitted to intervene.       And, in most cases, it\n\nwill require a final, non-appealable decision that there is a\n\nsection 2 violation.      That is, under the majority's reasoning, a\n\n                                   240\n\fstate may effectively be forced to defend an election system, even\n\nwhen its chief legal officer thinks that the system runs afoul of\n\nthe Voting Rights Act, unless there is a conclusive determination\n\nby the Supreme Court that the system does indeed violate section 2.\n\nSomehow, I do not think this is consistent with our policy of\n\nencouraging settlements in other areas of the law.\n\n     Moreover, the majority's rationale for denying the motion to\n\nremand places a premium on judicial efficiency.       The majority\n\nconcludes that, based upon the evidence the Plaintiffs' adduced at\n\ntrial, no reasonable district court could enter a consent decree\n\nthat would override provisions of Texas law.   Of course, in making\n\nthis conclusion, the majority necessarily tramples upon other\n\njudicial values that are equally, if not more, important--namely,\n\nthe values of judicial restraint and federalism.   It also turns a\n\ndeaf ear to the one voice in this lawsuit who is authorized to\n\nspeak on behalf of the State of Texas, the Attorney General, and\n\nignores the Texas legislature's official expression of its desire\n\nto see this case settled.\n\n     Instead of elevating judicial efficiency above these other\n\nvalues, I would grant the motion to remand.    In doing so, I would\n\nexpress no opinion on the proposed settlement, but would instruct\n\nthe district court that it should carefully consider the objections\n\nof the intervening judges, Chief Justice Phillips, and other\n\ninterested parties. I would also instruct the district court that,\n\nin deciding whether a settlement can override state law, it must\n\nconsider all evidence relevant to the question of whether there is\n\n\n                               241\n\fa section 2 violation, including the state's valid interests in\n\nmaintaining the current system.\n\n     Admittedly,   this      course    of   action   might    eliminate     our\n\nopportunity to address many of the new, burning questions about the\n\nframework for deciding section 2 cases.         But that is not the duty\n\nof an Article III court.      Rather, as the majority notes, \"[o]ur job\n\nis to decide a case or controversy.\"            Majority Opinion at 27.\n\nWhere the plaintiffs and the defendant in a case have expressed a\n\ndesire to settle their dispute, I think that principles of judicial\n\nrestraint require us to give them the opportunity to do so.\n\n\n\nWIENER, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n\n     I respectfully dissent.          In so doing I join the dissent of\n\nChief Judge Politz in the belief that we judge best when we judge\n\nleast,   particularly   in    controversial     matters      of   high   public\n\ninterest to the several states.         If forced to take a position on\n\nthe merits of this, the second en banc consideration of the case,\n\nI would regrettably find it impossible to concur in the reasoning\n\nof Judge Higginbotham's majority opinion or Judge Jones' concurring\n\nopinion.   For me those writings simply do not \"hang together.\"               I\n\nwould therefore reach the same conclusion as does Judge King in her\n\ndissentSQand for most if not all of the same reasons.\n\n\n\n\n                                      242\n\f",

It continues but the\n\ndemands have changed.      Relatively clear lines of legality and\n\nmorality have become more difficult to locate as demands for\n\noutcomes have followed the cutting away of obstacles to full\n\nparticipation.     With our diverse ethnic makeup, this demand for\n\nresults in voting has surfaced profound questions of a democratic\n\npolitical order such as the limits on rearranging state structures\n\nto alter election outcomes, and majority rule at the ballot box and\n\neven in legislative halls, questions Congress has provoked but not\n\nanswered.     All this can make a simple voting rights case seem\n\ndifficult, certainly so with state judges elected on a partisan\n\nballot.     Today our difficulties of fitting the Act to the unique\n\nfeatures of the state judiciary and sorting out racial and partisan\n\nvoting are large but the merits of the claims are easily grasped.\n\nAs we will explain, there is a background to the debate on the\n\nlarge issues that must not be obscured.       The evidence of any\n\ndilution of minority voting power is marginal at best.   We are not\n\npersuaded that a violation of the Voting Rights Act has been proved\n\nand we reverse.\n\n                              I.   Facts\n\n     On July 11, 1988, ten individual voters and the League of\n\nUnited Latin American Citizens sued in federal district court\n\nalleging that Texas' system of electing state trial judges violated\n\n§ 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the Fourteenth and Fifteenth\n\n\n                                   2\n\fAmendments in several Texas counties.1   They sued the Governor of\n\nTexas,2 the Attorney General, the Secretary of State, and the Chief\n\nJustice of the Supreme Court as chair of the Judicial Districts\n\nBoard.    Because this board is responsible for reapportioning the\n\njudicial districts, the suit also named each of its members as\n\ndefendants.    On March 12, 1989, the district court granted the\n\nmotions to intervene of the Houston Lawyers' Association, the\n\nLegislative Black Caucus, and two Texas district court judges, in\n\ntheir individual capacities--Sharolyn Wood, 127th District Court in\n\nHarris County, and Harold Entz, 194th District Court in Dallas\n\nCounty.\n\n     As they have throughout Texas history, Texas voters elect\n\ntheir trial judges in county-wide elections.   A voter may vote for\n\nall of the trial courts of general jurisdiction in her county.   At\n\nthe same time, each trial court is a distinct court, such as the\n\n134th judicial district court of Dallas County, with county-wide\n\njurisdiction and its own history of incumbents.   A candidate runs\n\nfor a particular court.    Plaintiffs contend that electing trial\n\njudges county-wide violates § 2 of the Voting Rights Act by\n\nimpermissibly diluting the voting power of Hispanics and blacks.\n\nPlaintiffs proceed on behalf of language and ethnic minorities in\n\ndifferent combinations in different counties.     Depending on the\n\n     1\n      Plaintiffs originally challenged the election of district\njudges in 44 counties, but by trial, winnowed their targets to\nthe following nine urban counties: Harris County, Dallas County,\nTravis County, Tarrant County, Jefferson County, Ector County,\nBexar County, Midland County, and Lubbock County.\n     2\n      Plaintiffs early in the case dismissed the Governor.\n\n                                 3\n\fcounty--more specifically, the numbers--they argue that Hispanic\n\nvoters, black voters, or the combination of both Hispanic and black\n\nvoters \"have less opportunity than other members of the electorate\n\nto participate in the political process and elect representatives\n\nof their choice.\"      Plaintiffs aimed their constitutional challenge\n\nat Article 5, § 7a(i) of the Texas Constitution, which precludes\n\nthe creation of judicial districts smaller than a county absent\n\napproval by a majority of the voters in that county.         They argued\n\nthat this limitation on the power to redistrict of the Judicial\n\nDistricts Board, chaired by defendant Chief Justice Phillips, was\n\nenacted with discriminatory intent.\n\n      On November 8, 1989, the district court found county-wide\n\nelections violated § 2 in all nine counties, enjoined future\n\nelections, divided the nine counties into electoral subdistricts,\n\nand ordered a nonpartisan election for May 5, 1990, with any runoff\n\nto   be   held    on   June   2.   The   district   court   rejected   the\n\nconstitutional arguments, finding that plaintiffs had failed to\n\nprove that Texas instituted or maintained the electoral system with\n\ndiscriminatory intent.3         Intervenors Judge Wood and Judge Entz\n\nappealed.        Unhappy with nonpartisan elections ordered by the\n\ndistrict court, the Texas Attorney General first moved the court to\n\nalter its interim plan.        After the court denied the motion, the\n\n\n\n\n      3\n       This ruling was not appealed.\n\n                                     4\n\fAttorney General filed a notice of appeal.4       We stayed the district\n\ncourt's order pending appeal.\n\n      In our first effort in this case, a panel held that the Act\n\ncovers judicial elections but concluded that electing district\n\njudges in county-wide elections in Texas did not violate § 2.\n\nLeague of United Latin American Citizens v.

The Court did not agree, however,\n\nthat this state interest outweighed its dilutive effect in all\n\ncases, as a matter of law.         Rather, the Court held that balancing\n\nis a case-specific enterprise, struck by inquiry into the totality\n\nof the circumstances.       Justice Stevens explained that the state\n\ninterest in linkage was to be weighed in deciding \"whether a § 2\n\nviolation    occurred.\"      Id.        Justice    Stevens       made    plain   that\n\nassessing the linkage interest is part of the determination of\n\nliability and not remedy alone.              The Court effectively came down\n\nbetween the \"goes only to remedy\" view of the Department of Justice\n\nand the \"matter of law\" view of the concurring opinion in LULAC II.\n\n     On remand, the en banc court in turn remanded to the panel.\n\nOn January 27, 1993, a majority of the panel affirmed the district\n\ncourt's   findings    in   eight   of    the    nine     counties.

For a second\n\n\n                                         6\n\ftime, this court decided, on its own motion, to hear the case en\n\nbanc.\n\n     Although the panel opinion had been vacated, General Morales\n\nurged a legislative solution to reforming judicial elections.    He\n\nsubmitted a plan to the legislature calling for the election of\n\njudges from single-member districts in all Texas counties with\n\npopulations over 100,000.    Recognizing that the Texas Constitution\n\nmandates the current system of electing trial judges, see Tex.\n\nConst. Art. 5, §§ 7, 7a(i), Morales asked the legislature to submit\n\na constitutional amendment to the voters to implement his plan and\n\nurged them to do so in time to moot the LULAC lawsuit.     Doubting\n\nthe necessary legislative support for an amendment, the Governor,\n\nthe Lieutenant Governor, and minority lawmakers urged Morales to\n\nachieve the same result through settlement.      Morales drafted an\n\nagreement providing for the election of the vast majority of judges\n\nin the nine urban counties by subdistricts.    Democratic officials\n\nwho were parties to the suit quickly agreed.   But Morales could not\n\nobtain the agreement of Chief Justice Phillips, nor the district\n\njudges, Judge Wood and Judge Entz.\n\n     When a proposed resolution approving the \"agreement\" reached\n\nthe floor of the Senate there was no quorum because all but two of\n\nthe thirteen Republican senators walked out.       The Senate later\n\nreconvened as a Committee of the Whole, not in formal session, and\n\nvoting along party lines, adopted a resolution expressing its\n\n\"sentiment\" in support of a federal decree.     Voting in the House\n\nalso followed party lines.    Nothing with the force of law could be\n\n\n                                  7\n\fobtained from the legislature.    When the dust settled, the only\n\nlegislative action was this expression of sentiment in support of\n\na federal decree, and that from a Senate convened in a Committee of\n\nthe Whole.    Failing to obtain any positive enactment from the\n\nlegislature, Morales requested that we remand to the district court\n\nfor a hearing and entry of his proposed \"consent\" decree.\n\n     By the decree, 152 judges would run in districts smaller than\n\na county, while 22 would continue to be elected at-large.   District\n\nboundaries would mirror state representative districts in Dallas,\n\nHarris, Bexar, and Jefferson counties.       Justice of the peace\n\ndistricts would be used in Tarrant County.   In Lubbock, Ector, and\n\nMidland counties, judges would run from the existing commissioners\n\ncourt districts.   Anticipating the question of how the case can be\n\nsettled without the agreement of the district court judges, the\n\nplan allows Judges Wood and Entz to be elected in a county-wide\n\nelection.    The stated purpose was to deny the defendant district\n\njudges standing to object.\n\n     Chief Justice Phillips, Judge Wood, and Judge Entz object to\n\nthe proposed decree and oppose the motion to remand.   In addition,\n\nthree former Chief Justices of Texas, Joe R. Greenhill, Robert W.\n\nCalvert, and John L. Hill, are before us as amici objecting to\n\nremand--and denying the authority of the Attorney General to bind\n\nthe State.    Judges Wood and Entz have moved to realign General\n\nMorales with the plaintiffs, and allow their assumption of the\n\n\n\n\n                                 8\n\fdefense of the current system.5         Judge Wood has also moved to\n\ndisqualify the Texas Attorney General as counsel for the State.\n\nWhen settlement negotiations began, Chief Justice Phillips obtained\n\nindependent counsel.6      General Morales responded by moving to\n\ndisqualify Phillips' counsel.       Finally, immediately after oral\n\nargument, plaintiffs filed a notice of nonsuit of Chief Justice\n\nPhillips and the Texas Judicial Districts Board.\n\n                        II.    Motion to Remand\n\n     We are asked to remand to the district court for entry of a\n\nconsent decree, although some of the parties wish to proceed with\n\nthe appeal.   The Attorney General argues that these non-consenting\n\nparties are no obstacle.      Chief Justice Phillips, General Morales\n\nargues, was sued in his official capacity as chair of the Judicial\n\nDistricts Board and the Attorney General is the exclusive lawyer\n\nfor the State of Texas.       On its face, this is not a remarkable\n\ncontention.   However, General Morales also maintains that in his\n\nrole as lawyer for the State, he need not represent the State's\n\npolicymakers; he can ignore them and impose his own views.    That is\n\nremarkable.   The force of this contention is that the Attorney\n\nGeneral is the sole arbiter of State policy when the State's\n\ninterest is in litigation.      This argument is put forward despite\n\nthe fact that it leaves his scrambling for legislative support\n\n\n     5\n      Judge Wood also filed a motion to strike the Attorney\nGeneral's Notice of Action Toward Settlement, which we denied\nbefore oral argument.\n     6\n      We granted Chief Justice Phillips' motion requesting that\nhe be allocated time at oral argument.\n\n                                    9\n\fwholly   inexplicable;    under   his    presently   claimed    power,   the\n\nAttorney General did not need to have the \"settlement\" adopted by\n\nstatute.   In any event, Texas law does not sanction his actions.\n\nNor are we persuaded that Defendant-Intervenors, Judges Entz and\n\nWood, lack standing to object to a proposed consent decree that\n\nwill allow them to run county-wide.        We deny the motion to remand.\n\n           A. The Authority of the Texas Attorney General\n\n     General Morales is not the first Texas Attorney General to\n\nhave staked such a claim of authority.

Wade, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"456224\"><a href=\"/opinion/456224/donald-f-baker-v-henry-wade-district-attorney-of-dallas-county-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">769</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">289</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1985) (en banc).\n\nBaker challenged Texas' anti-sodomy statute, suing Holt, the Dallas\n\nCity Attorney, and Wade, the Dallas County District Attorney.            The\n\ndistrict court certified a defendant class of officials responsible\n\nfor enforcing the statute, with Holt and Wade as representatives,\n\nand the Attorney General of Texas intervened on behalf of the\n\nState.      After   the    district      court    declared     the   statute\n\nunconstitutional, Danny E. Hill, Potter County's district attorney,\n\nfiled a notice of appeal, concerned that the Attorney General might\n\ndecide not to appeal.     Hill was a member of the class, but was not\n\na named defendant and had not sought to intervene.           Hill's concern\n\nwas realized when the Attorney General appealed but then withdrew\n\nthe notice.   After failing to persuade the Texas Supreme Court to\n\norder the Attorney General to pursue the appeal and unable to\n\nobtain leave to intervene from the district court, Hill asked this\n\ncourt for leave to intervene on appeal.          We granted this request,\n\nexplaining:\n\n\n                                    10\n\f     [Hill] would be seriously prejudiced were he not allowed\n     to intervene, whereas allowing the appeal to proceed\n     would prejudice no one. As a state official empowered by\n     Texas law to enforce criminal laws, his interest and its\n     impairment by the district court's judgment cannot be\n     questioned. . . .\n     In this case where the district court has rejected\n     binding Supreme Court authority, the circuit court is\n     entitled to conclude as a matter of law that those\n     interests were inadequately represented by those who\n     failed to pursue the appeal and that the state officer\n     seeking to intervene was a proper party to do so.\n\nId. at 292.\n\n     Attorney General Mattox made a considered decision to accept\n\nthe district court's declaration of unconstitutionality.          That was\n\na basic policy choice.       Baker's relevant instruction lies in the\n\nfact that Attorney General Mattox's decision did not control.\n\nBaker rejected the very power claimed by this Attorney General.\n\nThe power he would exercise cannot be squared with Baker.\n\n     That Attorney General Mattox decided to accept the ruling of\n\nthe district court and Morales reaches for a similar result by a\n\n\"settlement\" fails to distinguish our holding in Baker.           It does\n\nnot respond to our holding that the Attorney General cannot bind\n\nstate officials, his clients, to his own policy preferences. It is\n\nasserted that Hill as a district attorney, one of hundreds in\n\nTexas, was charged with the duty of enforcing the statute held\n\nunconstitutional. The law enforcement responsibility of a district\n\nattorney   and   that   of   the   Chief   Justice   as   chair   of   the\n\nredistricting board, however, do not differ in relevant ways.\n\nIndeed, that the Chief Justice may defend the suit is an a fortiori\n\ncase under Baker.   After all, his judicial duties aside, the Chief\n\nJustice's enforcement responsibilities under the redistricting\n\n                                    11\n\fprovisions of state law are statewide.                     A district attorney's\n\nduties, however, run only to the county line.                   See Crane v.

Following the 1990 census,\n\nplaintiffs sued various state and county officials to prevent the\n\nuse of the new census in reapportioning the legislature, because it\n\nallegedly undercounted minorities.    The legislature proceeded with\n\nreapportionment and plaintiffs also challenged the resulting plans.\n\nGeneral Morales defended the legislature's plans, lost at trial,\n\nand appealed directly to the Texas Supreme Court.     Then, Morales\n\n     7\n      The dissent argues that Chief Justice Phillips was joined\nsolely as a jurisdictional party for Eleventh Amendment purposes.\nEven if that were true, and it is not, see supra page 4, it would\nnot answer the real question: if the State of Texas is the real\nparty in interest, does the Attorney General possess exclusive\nauthority to choose whether the State's interests will be\nasserted on appeal? In Baker, we answered in the negative.\n\n                                 13\n\fagreed with the plaintiffs to settle the senate reapportionment\n\nchallenge.    The agreement included a redistricting plan that was\n\nsubmitted    to   the   trial    court     and    promptly      accepted     by   it.\n\nThereafter, five individuals, not parties to the suit, requested\n\nthe Supreme Court of Texas to direct the trial court to vacate its\n\njudgments    reconfiguring       the    senatorial      districts,     order      the\n\nAttorney General to rescind the agreement, and direct the Secretary\n\nof State to withdraw submission of the plan for preclearance.\n\n     A plurality directed the trial court to vacate its judgments,\n\nbut refused relief against the Attorney General.                   Four justices\n\nheld that the trial court erred by failing to weigh all affected\n\ninterests before entering the proposed decree.               In Justice Hecht's\n\nwords, \"a district court cannot order a reapportionment plan for\n\nthe State based on nothing more than an agreement of the Governor,\n\nthe Attorney General, and a few citizens.\"              Id. at 714.8       Indeed a\n\nmajority believed the Attorney General's \"discretion includes the\n\nauthority to propose a settlement agreement in an action attacking\n\nthe constitutionality of a reapportionment statute.\"                   Id. at 722\n\n(Hecht, J.) (emphasis supplied).\n\n     In approving of the Attorney General's conduct, however, the\n\nplurality    noted      that    he     acted     \"on   behalf     of   the     state\n\ndefendants[,]\" giving him the authority \"for his clients and even\n\non his own, to suggest possible remedies . . . [and] to negotiate\n\na settlement.\"    Id. (Hecht, J.) (emphasis added).              \"To hold that he\n\n\n     8\n      Justice Gonzalez joined section II.A. of the plurality\nopinion regarding the entry of redistricting relief.\n\n                                         14\n\fdid not would be to give him less authority than any party or any\n\nother attorney participating in the case.\"       Id. (emphasis added).\n\nThe Attorney General acts as counsel for state officials who are\n\nhis clients.\n\n     Terrazas   recognizes   that   the   Attorney   General   represents\n\nofficials.     It does not follow that by doing so, the Attorney\n\nGeneral steps into their shoes and assumes the policymaking roles\n\nof those officials, against whom specific relief is sought.           We\n\nneed not and do not decide the authority of the Attorney General\n\nwhen an official is named in his official capacity only to join the\n\nState.    Plaintiff sought specific relief against the Judicial\n\nDistricts Board chaired by defendant Chief Justice Phillips.         The\n\npetitioners who objected to the settlement in Terrazas were not\n\neven parties to the suit.    The Attorney General's power to settle\n\nfor his clients is certainly no less than that of other lawyers,\n\nbut Terrazas does not say that it is any greater.         No lawyer may\n\nforge a settlement agreement over the express objection of his\n\nclient.   Here, to the extent that Morales represents the Chief\n\nJustice in the Justice's defense of his constitutionally assigned\n\ntask, he may not ignore him.

We also deny Judge Wood's\n\nmotion to disqualify General Morales as counsel for the State.\n\nWhile we have rejected his claimed power to bind against their will\n\nstate officials he is charged to represent, he is nonetheless their\n\ncounsel.\n\n                              C. The Intervenors\n\n     The Attorney General may represent state officials in their\n\nofficial capacities, but there is no contention that General\n\nMorales represents Judges Wood and Entz.11         They have intervened in\n\ntheir personal capacities and have elected to obtain their own\n\ncounsel.12     As we earlier observed, the proposed consent decree\n\n     11\n      After trial, certain Bexar County district judges also\nsought to intervene as defendants, and we have before us an\nappeal from the denial of their motion. A motion to intervene\nunder Rule 24 must be timely. Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a), (b); Jones v.\nCaddo Parish School Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"436268\"><a href=\"/opinion/436268/beryl-n-jones-v-caddo-parish-school-board-v-june-phillips/\"><span class=\"volume\">735</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">923</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 926 (5th Cir. 1984) (en\nbanc). Although the district court did not expressly state that\ntheir motion was untimely, it was well within the district\ncourt's discretion to deny the motion on this ground.\n     12\n      Because we find that the judges' standing in their\nindividual capacities survives the settlement agreement, we are\nnot required to address the ability of Texas district court\njudges to represent themselves in their official capacities. It\nappears, however, that Texas law permits them to do so. Tex.\nGov't Code § 74.141, titled Defense of Judges provides:\n\n     The attorney general shall defend a state district judge, a\n     presiding judge of an administrative region, or an active,\n     retired, or former judge assigned under this chapter in any\n     action or suit in any court in which the judge is a\n     defendant because of his office as judge if the judge\n\n                                      20\n\fwould allow Judge Wood and Judge Entz to continue to run county-\n\nwide.     General Morales urges that they therefore lack standing to\n\neither prosecute the suit or object to the proposed decree.\n\n     To this point, the standing of the intervening parties has not\n\nbeen questioned.        To the contrary, the intervenors played an\n\nimportant role at trial and have since taken the lead.           After the\n\nfederal district judge's ruling in favor of plaintiffs, the notice\n\nof appeal was first filed by Judges Wood and Entz, not by the\n\nAttorney     General.     Only    the    district   judge's   adherence   to\n\nnonpartisan elections prodded the Attorney General to appeal.             The\n\nHouston Lawyers' Association intervened by the same order as the\n\nintervening judges and carried the appeal from our first en banc\n\ndecision to the United States Supreme Court.13           Even now, no one\n\nquestions the earlier uncontested standing of the intervenors; nor\n\ncould they.     Wood and Entz intervened in part to protect their\n\ntenure as elected judges.        The district court found that they were\n\nillegally elected.\n\n     Of course, these intervenors must satisfy Article III to\n\nappeal on their own.      Diamond v.

Put another\n\nway, the proposed settlement does not deprive this court of its\n\njurisdiction to hear the appeal independently perfected by Judges\n\nWood and Entz, an appeal from a decision that declared their\n\nelections illegal.\n\n     Even   assuming       the   proposed   settlement    foreclosed    the\n\nintervening judges' standing to protect their tenure, Wood and Entz\n\nwould still have a sufficient stake in the litigation to satisfy\n\nthe Constitution.     In an earlier opinion in this case we said\n\n     [a]sserting interests both as a Texas voter and as a\n     sitting Texas district judge, Judge Sharolyn Wood moved\n     to intervene on the side of the defendant--the state.\n     The court allowed her to intervene in her personal\n     capacity, permitting Dallas County District Judge Harold\n     Entz to do so as well.\n\nLeague of United Latin American Citizens v.

In the district court, Judge\n\nEntz moved to intervene as a defendant to defend on his interests\n\nas a judge, a lawyer, and a registered voter in and citizen of\n\n                                     22\n\fDallas County.      The court's order granting intervention in his\n\nindividual capacity encompasses all of these interests.\n\n     Thus, the proponents of remand view the judges' intervention\n\ntoo narrowly, for Wood and Entz also have standing as voters.           The\n\nsettlement agreement would deprive voters of the right to vote for\n\nall judges with general jurisdiction over their county.

As here, individual voters\n\nchallenged a liability finding that elected officials would not\n\ncontest on appeal.      Swann and Sampson were Dade County residents\n\nand voters.       The district court denied them leave to intervene\n\nbefore trial.      In a second request for leave to intervene, Swann\n\nand Sampson sought to preserve their right to appeal in the event\n\nof an adverse judgment and a decision by defendants not to appeal.\n\nThe court found the at-large system illegal and, as feared, the\n\nCounty Commission decided not to appeal.        When the district court\n\ndenied their third motion to intervene, Swann and Sampson appealed.\n\n     Our sister court held that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying the intervention and affirmed the district\n\ncourt on the merits.     The court held that the voters had standing,\n\na sufficient interest both to intervene and carry the appeal when\n\nthe state agency declined to do so.       In its view, if the court were\n\nto deny standing to these voters, it \"would be forced to conclude\n\nthat most of the plaintiffs also lack standing, a conclusion\n\n\n                                     23\n\fforeclosed by the many cases in which individual voters have been\n\npermitted to challenge election practices.\"       Id. at 1480 (citing\n\nWhitcomb v.

Significant legal errors infected the trial\n\ncourt's earlier judgment, including its refusal to consider the\n\neffect of partisan voting, its finding of liability in Travis\n\nCounty now undefended, its selective aggregation of language and\n\nethnic minorities, its refusal to accord weight to the State's\n\nlinkage interest in the totality of the circumstances, and finally,\n\nits heavy reliance upon historical societal discrimination without\n\nbringing this history home to this case.

In spite of its label,\nthe Attorney General's motion is far from being a joint motion.\n\n                                       29\n\f      Second, the parties in Chisom came to this court asking for\n\nremand carrying a duly enacted state law with them.             They did not\n\nseek to invoke the preemptive force of the federal law.            The decree\n\nin Chisom was agreed to by all parties and adopted into law by the\n\nstate legislature.        The consent decree did not set aside any state\n\nlaws--and not by accident.         It was carefully crafted to that end.\n\nIn   Louisiana,     the   legislature    can   create   more   supreme   court\n\ndistricts with a two-thirds vote from both houses.             La. Const. Art\n\n5, § 4.17      Article 5, § 3 of the Louisiana Constitution fixes the\n\nnumber of supreme court justices at seven and establishes that each\n\nshall serve a ten-year term.18        Because the state wished to create\n\nthe Orleans district without upsetting the terms of the sitting\n\njustices, Louisiana had to temporarily expand the supreme court to\n\neight members.19\n\n\n\n      17\n           Art. 5, § 4 provides:\n\n      The state shall be divided into at least six supreme court\n      districts, and at least one judge shall be elected from\n      each. The districts and the number of judges assigned to\n      each on the effective date of this constitution are\n      retained, subject to change by law enacted by two-thirds of\n      the elected members of each house of the legislature.\n      18\n           Art. 5, § 3 provides:\n\n      The supreme court shall be composed of a chief justice and\n      six associate justices, four of whom must concur to render\n      judgment. The term of a supreme court judge shall be ten\n      years.\n      19\n      Louisiana's first effort to create an eighth position, and\nthereby resolve the Chisom litigation, came in 1989 in the form\nof a proposed constitutional amendment. However, the voters\nrejected the proposal. See La. Const. Art. 5, §§ 4, 35,\nHistorical Notes.\n\n                                        30\n\f      While § 3 limits the size of the supreme court to seven\n\njustices, Art. 5, § 5(A) permits the Louisiana Supreme Court to\n\n\"assign a sitting or retired judge to any court.\"              La. Const. Art.\n\n5, § 5(A).      The legislature therefore created an additional place\n\nfor a judge on the Court of Appeal for the Fourth Circuit, who,\n\nupon election, would be assigned to the supreme court to serve, in\n\nreality, as the eighth justice.          See La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 13:312.4\n\n(West Supp. 1993).        This temporary judgeship was to expire with a\n\nvacancy on the supreme court from the first district.                The vacancy\n\nwould be filled by an election in the newly created seventh\n\ndistrict      comprised   of   Orleans    Parish.       La.   Rev.   Stat.   Ann.\n\n§ 13:101.1 (West Supp. 1993).                 Both of these provisions were\n\ncontained in Act 512 which, after receiving the required two-thirds\n\nvote in both houses of the legislature, became law on June 22,\n\n1992.   Official Journal of the Proceedings of the Senate of the\n\nState of Louisiana, 18th Reg. Sess. at 24 (June 18, 1992); Official\n\nJournal of the Proceedings of the House of the State of Louisiana,\n\n18th Reg. Sess. at 31 (June 16, 1992).               The Louisiana Legislature\n\nprovided that Act 512 would not go into effect unless the federal\n\ncourt entered a consent decree in Chisom.                 La. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\n§ 13:101.l (West Supp. 1993).\n\n      The Texas Legislature refused to take positive action, and the\n\nsettlement agreement attempts to avoid constitutional requirements.\n\nThe   Texas    Constitution    requires       that   judges   be   elected   from\n\ndistricts no smaller than a county, absent a majority vote by the\n\n\n\n\n                                         31\n\fcitizens of that county.     Tex. Const. Art. 5, §§ 7, 7a(i).20    The\n\nsettlement agreement is not contingent on approval by the voters of\n\neach county.      The legislature has not proposed a constitutional\n\namendment.     It has made no laws.\n\n                             F. Federalism\n\n     Then we have all sides claiming the high ground of federalism.\n\nSome of the assertions are creative.         The suggestion that state\n\npolitical groups, unable to muster sufficient political force to\n\nchange the system, can by \"agreement\" enlist the preemptive power\n\nof the federal court to achieve the same end stands federalism on\n\nits head.       Of course, we defer to legislative will and state\n\ndecision.     Here, the \"decision\" to which we are asked to defer is\n\na decision by a political faction that the federal court should\n\norder the state to change its system.   We do not share this curious\n\nview of federalism.\n\n     20\n          Art. 5, § 7 provides:\n\n          The state shall be divided into judicial districts,\n     with each district having one or more judges as may be\n     provided by law or by this Constitution. . . .\n\nArt. 5, § 7a(i) provides:\n\n          The legislature, the Judicial Districts Board, or the\n     Legislative Redistricting Board may not redistrict the\n     judicial districts to provide for any judicial district\n     smaller in size than an entire county except as provided by\n     this section. Judicial districts smaller in size than the\n     entire county may be created subsequent to a general\n     election where a majority of the persons voting on the\n     proposition adopt the proposition \"to allow the division of\n          County into judicial districts composed of parts of\n        County.\" No redistricting plan may be proposed or\n     adopted by the legislature, the Judicial Districts board, or\n     the Legislative Redistricting Board in anticipation of a\n     future action by the voters of any county.\n\n                                  32\n\f                        III.

Ind. 1969).\n      24\n           The Court stated:\n\n      We have discovered nothing in the record or in the\n      court's findings indicating that poor Negroes were not\n      allowed to register or vote, to choose the political\n      party they desired to support, to participate in its\n      affairs or to be equally represented on those occasions\n      when legislative candidates were chosen. Nor did the\n      evidence purport to show or the court find that\n      inhabitants of the ghetto were regularly excluded from\n      the slates of both major parties, thus denying them the\n      chance of occupying legislative seats.\n\nId. at 149-50.\n\n                                        39\n\fall of the elections or even most of them, the ghetto would have no\n\njustifiable complaints about representation.\"      Id. at 152.     For\n\nthis reason, the Court concluded that the \"failure of the ghetto to\n\nhave legislative seats in proportion to its population emerges more\n\nas a function of losing elections than of built-in bias against\n\npoor Negroes.\"    Id. at 153.\n\n       The Whitcomb Court was reluctant to view the plaintiffs'\n\nclaims of vote dilution as anything more than \"a euphemism for\n\npolitical defeat at the polls,\" id., for, absent evidence of a lack\n\nof access to the political system, there was no principle by which\n\nthe Court could distinguish the \"ghetto's\" claims and those of\n\nother unsuccessful political groups:\n\n       [A]re poor Negroes of the ghetto any more under-\n       represented than poor ghetto whites who also voted\n       Democratic and lost, or any more discriminated against\n       than other interest groups or voters in Marion County\n       with allegiance to the Democratic Party, or, conversely,\n       any less represented than Republican areas or voters in\n       years of Republican defeat? We think not. The mere fact\n       that one interest group or another concerned with the\n       outcome of Marion County elections has found itself\n       outvoted and without legislative seats of its own\n       provides no basis for invoking constitutional remedies\n       where, as here, there is no indication that this segment\n       of the population is being denied access to the political\n       system.\n\nId. at 154-55.    To grant relief to black residents in this case,\n\nthe Court held, \"would make it difficult to reject claims of\n\nDemocrats, Republicans, or members of any political organization in\n\nMarion County who live in what would be safe districts in a single-\n\nmember district system but who in one year or another, or year\n\nafter year, are submerged in a multimember district vote.\"     Id. at\n\n156.\n\n                                  40\n\f      The Court's assertion that plaintiffs' racial vote dilution\n\nclaim was indistinguishable from complaints which might be brought\n\nby any unsuccessful interest group hinged on its determination that\n\n\"ghetto\" residents did not suffer from a lack of access to the\n\npolitical process.      Despite the presence of vast disparities in\n\nvirtually every significant measure of socioeconomic status, the\n\nCourt found that black voters stood on the same footing with whites\n\nin   vying   for   representation   within   Marion    County.       \"Ghetto\"\n\nresidents had in fact experienced a string of losses at the polls\n\nin recent years, but these defeats were shared equally among all\n\nmembers of the Democratic Party.\n\n      The Court confronted very different circumstances two years\n\nlater in White v. Regester, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108826\"><a href=\"/opinion/108826/white-v-regester/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">755</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1973).                    The Court\n\nconfirmed Whitcomb's rejection of the claim that \"every racial or\n\npolitical group has a constitutional right to be represented in the\n\nstate   legislature,\"    id.   at   769,   and   reiterated   the    standard\n\nestablished in its earlier decision: a minority group must prove\n\n\"that its members had less opportunity than did other residents in\n\nthe district to participate in the political processes and to elect\n\nlegislators of their choice.\"        Id. at 766 (citing Whitcomb, 403\n\nU.S. at 149-50).     Unlike the plaintiffs in Whitcomb, however, the\n\nblack residents of Dallas County and the Hispanic voters in Bexar\n\nCounty each established that they had been effectively excluded\n\nfrom the political processes leading to the nomination and election\n\nof the Texas House of Representatives.           412 U.S. at 766-70.\n\n\n\n\n                                     41\n\f       Specifically, black voters in Dallas labored under the yoke of\n\nTexas' long history of official discrimination and were subjected\n\nto   several    procedural       devices    which,   while     not    invidious    in\n\nthemselves, \"enhanced the opportunity for racial discrimination.\"\n\nId. at 766.        \"More fundamentally,\" the Court noted, the Dallas\n\nCommittee       for     Responsible        Government,    \"a     white-dominated\n\norganization that is in effective control of Democratic Party\n\ncandidate slating,\" had slated only two black candidates in its\n\nhistory, who, not coincidentally, constituted the only two blacks\n\never to have served in the Dallas County delegation to the Texas\n\nHouse since Reconstruction.            Id. at 766-67.        The DCRG failed to\n\ndisplay any \"good-faith concern for the political and other needs\n\nand aspirations of the Negro community,\" and in fact regularly\n\nrelied on racial campaign tactics to defeat candidates supported by\n\nblack residents.             Id. at 767.     Consequently, the Court had no\n\nreason to disturb the district court's conclusion \"that 'the black\n\ncommunity has been effectively excluded from participation in the\n\nDemocratic primary selection process,' and was therefore generally\n\nnot permitted to enter into the political process in a reliable and\n\nmeaningful manner.\"            Id. (quoting Graves v. Barnes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1691616\"><a href=\"/opinion/1691616/graves-v-barnes/\"><span class=\"volume\">343</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Tex. 1972)).\n\n       The Court also upheld a similar finding that Mexican-Americans\n\nlikewise    had       been    \"'effectively     removed   from       the    political\n\nprocesses of Bexar [County] in violation of all the Whitcomb\n\nstandards.'\"       Id. at 769 (quoting Graves, 343 F. Supp. at 733).\n\nLike    black     residents      of   Texas,    Mexican-Americans          \"had   long\n\n\n                                           42\n\f'suffered from, and continue[d] to suffer from, the results and\n\neffects of invidious discrimination and treatment in the field of\n\neducation, employment, economics, health, politics and others.'\"\n\nId. at 768 (quoting Graves, 343 F. Supp. at 728)).                      In addition,\n\nthe    district     court     determined      that    \"cultural        and    language\n\nbarrier[s] . . . 'conjoined with the poll tax and the most\n\nrestrictive     voter   registration       procedures       in   the    nation      have\n\noperated   to      effectively    deny   Mexican-Americans         access      to    the\n\npolitical processes in Texas even longer than the Blacks were\n\nformally denied access by the white primary.'\"                          Id. (quoting\n\nGraves, 343 F. Supp. at 731).         The exclusionary effects of past and\n\npresent discrimination, the Court found, were palpably reflected in\n\nlow voting registration among Mexican-Americans, the election of\n\nonly five Bexar County Mexican-Americans to the Texas Legislature\n\nsince 1880, and the county delegation's unresponsiveness to the\n\ncommunity's interests.           Id. at 768-69.       Given that the district\n\ncourt's findings flowed from \"a blend of history and an intensely\n\nlocal appraisal\" of conditions in Bexar County, the Court was \"not\n\ninclined to overturn\" its conclusion that the multimember district\n\n\"invidiously         excluded      Mexican-Americans             from        effective\n\nparticipation in political life.\"             Id. at 769.    As we will explain,\n\nthis earlier time in Texas history and the elections at issue here\n\npresent stark contrasts. The record before us contains no evidence\n\nthat   past   or    present     discrimination       has   affected      minorities'\n\npolitical access in any way.\n\n\n\n\n                                         43\n\f     The principles announced and applied in Whitcomb and White are\n\ninstructive and, we believe, controlling.        As Justice White, the\n\nauthor of these opinions, recently indicated, the central \"theme\"\n\nof Whitcomb and White is \"that it is not mere suffering at the\n\npolls but discrimination in the polity with which the Constitution\n\nis concerned.\"    Shaw v.

Chavis, we again repeated and applied the\n     Fortson [effects] standard, but determined that the Negro\n     community's lack of success at the polls was the result\n     of partisan politics, not racial vote dilution.       The\n     Court stressed that both the Democratic and Republican\n     Parties had nominated Negroes and several had been\n     elected. Negro candidates lost only when their entire\n     party slate went down to defeat. In addition, the Court\n     was impressed that there was no finding that officials\n     had been unresponsive to Negro concerns.\n\n                                 44\n\fId. at 109 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (citations omitted).\n\n     Justice Marshall's references to the \"lack of success at the\n\npolls\" as   a    \"result\"   of   \"partisan    politics,    not   racial    vote\n\ndilution,\" closely tracks the relevant language in Whitcomb, where\n\nthe Court held that the \"cancell[ing] out\" of the \"voting power of\n\nghetto residents\" was more \"a function of losing elections\" or\n\n\"political defeat\" than of \"built-in bias against poor Negroes.\"\n\n403 U.S. at 153.        Absent evidence that minorities have been\n\nexcluded from the political process, a \"lack of success at the\n\npolls\" is not sufficient to trigger judicial intervention.            Courts\n\nmust undertake the additional inquiry into the reasons for, or\n\ncauses of, these electoral losses in order to determine whether\n\nthey were the product of \"partisan politics\" or \"racial vote\n\ndilution,\" \"political defeat\" or \"built-in bias.\"           It is only upon\n\nconcluding that a minority group's failure to prevail at the polls,\n\nthat is, their failure to attract the support of white voters, was\n\nthe \"result\" or \"function\" of \"racial vote dilution\" or \"built-in\n\nbias,\" that a court may find that minority plaintiffs have suffered\n\n\"a denial or abridgement of the right . . . to vote on account of\n\nrace or color.\"    In sum, Whitcomb unmistakably prescribes the very\n\ninquiry   into   the   causes    underlying   the   lack   of    support   for\n\nminority-preferred candidates among white voters with which the\n\ndistrict court dispensed.\n\n     As Justice Marshall suggested, failures of a minority group to\n\nelect representatives of its choice that are attributable to\n\n\"partisan politics\" provide no grounds for relief. Section 2 is \"a\n\n\n                                     45\n\fbalm for racial minorities, not political ones--even though the two\n\noften coincide.\"       Baird v.

Rather, § 2 is implicated only where\n\nDemocrats lose because they are black, not where blacks lose\n\nbecause they are Democrats.           While this rule is easier stated than\n\napplied, the Whitcomb Court's application of the \"results\" test to\n\nthe   facts   before    it    provides    helpful   and    indeed    dispositive\n\nguidance.        As we explain in greater detail below, the Court's\n\ndismissal in Whitcomb of the plaintiffs' vote dilution claim as a\n\n\"mere   euphemism      for   political    defeat    at    the   polls,\"   despite\n\nevidence    of    polarized    voting,    the   lingering       effects   of   past\n\ndiscrimination,      and     little    electoral    success      among    minority\n\ncandidates, precludes finding a violation of § 2 in most, but not\n\nall, of the counties at issue.\n\n                             B. The 1982 Amendments\n\n      The Senate Report accompanying the 1982 amendments to § 2\n\nstates that Congress intended to \"codify\" the \"results test\"\n\narticulated and employed in Whitcomb and White. Congress of course\n\nretained the statutory language restricting relief under § 2 to\n\n\"denial[s] or abridgment[s] of the right . . . to vote on account\n\nof race or color.\"       This limitation was not so much the product of\n\nlegislative discretion as constitutional imperative, given that the\n\nscope of Congress' remedial power under the Civil War Amendments is\n\n\n                                         46\n\fdefined in large part by the wrongs they prohibit.

Nine blacks had in fact been elected to\n       the legislature from the at-large districts between\n       [1960] and 1968.\n\nId. at 20-21, reprinted in 1982 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin.

The facts cited by the Senate mirror those previously\n\nidentified   by    Justice   Marshall    in    Bolden   and    stressed    here:\n\nPlaintiffs were unsuccessful in years in which their party suffered\n\nelectoral defeat; they were able to elect representatives of their\n\nchoice when their party prevailed.            Not surprisingly, the Senate\n\n\n\n\n                                    47\n\fadopted     Whitcomb's     central     teaching    in     presenting    what     it\n\nunderstood to be the kernel of the decision:\n\n     The failure of the ghetto to have legislative seats in\n     proportion to its population emerges more as a function\n     of losing elections than of built-in bias against poor\n     Negroes. The voting power of ghetto residents may have\n     been \"cancelled out,\" as the district court held, but\n     this seems a mere euphemism for political defeat at the\n     polls.\n\nId. at 21 (quoting Whitcomb, 403 U.S. at 153), reprinted in 1982\n\nU.S. Code Cong. & Admin.

(quoting S.Rep. 417 at 148 (Report of\n\nthe Subcommittee on the Constitution)), reprinted in 1982 U.S. Code\n\nCong. & Admin. News at 321).

Id.\n\n       It is difficult to see how the record in this case could\n\npossibly support a finding of liability under the approach outlined\n\nin the Senate Report.            Plaintiffs have not even attempted to\n\nestablish proof of racial bloc voting by demonstrating that \"race,\"\n\nnot,    as    defendants      contend,    partisan    affiliation,    \"is     the\n\npredominant      determinant     of    political   preference.\"      They   have\n\ninstead maintained, in the very teeth of the Senate Report, that\n\nsuch a showing is unnecessary. Because the district court accepted\n\nthis argument, the test employed at trial enabled plaintiffs to\n\nprevail by proving little more than a lack of success at the polls\n\nand a history of discrimination.

For this reason, we believe that it is to these\n\nopinions, not Justice Brennan's, that we should look in attempting\n\nto define the contours of the inquiry into legally significant bloc\n\nvoting.\n\n        Despite the presence of express language to the contrary in\n\nthe Senate Report, see S. Rep. 417 at 33 (\"racial bloc voting\" is\n\nestablished when \"race is the predominant determinant of political\n\npreference\"), reprinted in 1982 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News at\n\n211, Justice Brennan held that racial bloc voting or \"racially\n\npolarized voting\" did not describe divergent \"voting patterns for\n\nwhich the principal cause is race.\"                Gingles, 478 U.S. at 61.\n\nInstead, he asserted that \"[i]t is the difference between the\n\nchoices made        by   blacks   and    whites--not    the   reasons   for     that\n\ndifference--that [matters].\"             Id.   A consideration of \"irrelevant\n\nvariables\"        such   as   partisan    affiliation   or    the   race   of   the\n\ncandidate, Justice Brennan urged, would \"distort[] the equation and\n\n\n\n\n        25\n      In order to make out a § 2 vote dilution claim under\nGingles, minority plaintiffs challenging an at-large system must\nprove that: (1) the group is sufficiently large and\ngeographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-\nmember district; (2) it is politically cohesive; and (3) the\nwhite majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it usually\nto defeat the minority's preferred candidate. Gingles, 478 U.S.\nat 50-51.\n\n                                          50\n\fyield[] results that are indisputably incorrect under § 2 and the\n\nSenate Report.\"     Id. at 64.\n\n     Justice      Brennan's      assertion     that   racial   political\n\nconsiderations had no role in examining racial bloc voting was\n\nsquarely rejected by five Justices in Gingles.           478 U.S. at 83\n\n(White, J., concurring); id. at 100-01 (O'Connor, J., joined by\n\nBurger, C.J., Powell and Rehnquist, JJ., concurring).            Justice\n\nWhite argued that\n\n     Justice Brennan states in Part III-C that the crucial\n     factor in identifying polarized voting is the race of the\n     voter and that the race of the candidate is irrelevant.\n     Under this test, there is polarized voting if the\n     majority of white voters vote for different candidates\n     than the majority of the blacks, regardless of the race\n     of the candidates. I do not agree. Suppose an eight-\n     member multimember district that is 60% white and 40%\n     black, the blacks being geographically located so that\n     two safe black single-member districts could be drawn.\n     Suppose further that there are six white and two black\n     Democrats running against six white and two black\n     Republicans. Under Justice Brennan's test, there would\n     be polarized voting and a likely § 2 violation if all the\n     Republicans, including the two blacks, are elected, and\n     80% of the blacks in the predominately black areas vote\n     Democratic . . . .      This is interest-group politics\n     rather than a rule hedging against racial discrimination.\n     I doubt that this is what Congress had in mind in\n     amending § 2 as it did, and it seems quite at odds with\n     the discussion in Whitcomb v. Chavis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108364\"><a href=\"/opinion/108364/whitcomb-v-chavis/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 149-\n     160 (1971).\n\nId. at 83 (White, J., concurring) (emphasis added).              Justice\n\nO'Connor joined Justice White in maintaining that evidence that\n\nwhite and minority voters generally supported different candidates\n\ndid not constitute legally significant racial bloc voting where\n\nthese patterns were attributable to partisan affiliation rather\n\nthan the race of the candidate.           She therefore rejected Justice\n\nBrennan's position that\n\n                                     51\n\f     evidence that the divergent racial voting patterns may be\n     explained in part by causes other than race, such as an\n     underlying divergence in the interests of minority and\n     white voters . . . . can never affect the overall vote\n     dilution inquiry. Evidence that a candidate preferred by\n     the minority group in a particular election was rejected\n     by white voters for reasons other than those which made\n     that candidate the preferred choice of the minority group\n     would seem clearly relevant in answering the question\n     whether bloc voting by white voters will consistently\n     defeat minority candidates. Such evidence would suggest\n     that another candidate, equally preferred by the minority\n     group, might be able to attract greater white support in\n     future elections.\n\n          I believe Congress also intended that explanations\n     of the reasons why white voters rejected minority\n     candidates would be probative of the likelihood that\n     candidates elected without decisive minority support\n     would be willing to take the minority's interests into\n     account. In a community that is polarized along racial\n     lines, racial hostility may bar these and other indirect\n     avenues of political influence to a much greater extent\n     than in a community where racial animosity is absent\n     although the interests of racial groups diverge. Indeed,\n     the Senate Report clearly stated that one factor that\n     could have probative value in § 2 cases was \"whether\n     there is a significant lack of responsiveness on the part\n     of elected officials to the particularized needs of the\n     members of the minority group.\" S. Rep., at 29. The\n     overall vote dilution inquiry neither requires nor\n     permits an arbitrary rule against consideration of all\n     evidence concerning voting preferences other than\n     statistical evidence of racial voting patterns. Such a\n     rule would give no effect whatever to the Senate Report's\n     repeated emphasis on \"intensive racial politics,\" on\n     \"racial political considerations,\" and on whether \"racial\n     politics . . . dominate the electoral process\" as one\n     aspect of the \"racial bloc voting\" that Congress deemed\n     relevant to showing a § 2 violation.      Id., at 33-34.\n     Similarly, I agree with Justice White that Justice\n     Brennan's conclusion that the race of the candidate is\n     always irrelevant in identifying racially polarized\n     voting conflicts with Whitcomb and is not necessary to\n     the disposition of this case. Ante, at 83 (concurring).\n\nId. at 100-01 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (emphasis added).\n\n     As courts and commentators alike have noted, Justice White and\n\nJustice O'Connor were united in their fidelity to Whitcomb's\n\n\n                                52\n\fdistinction between vote dilution and partisan politics and in\n\ntheir opposition to Justice Brennan's attempt to expunge this\n\nteaching from the bloc voting inquiry.

The division in Gingles between the Brennan\n\nplurality and the five Justices who supported the White/O'Connor\n\napproach cuts deep, reflecting quite different visions of voting\n\nrights and their statutory treatment.         Since these five Justices\n\nexpressly rejected a test that would permit § 2 liability to attach\n\nupon a showing that white and black citizens generally gave their\n\nvotes to different candidates in favor of an inquiry into the\n\npossible   explanations    of   these    divergent   voting   patterns,    we\n\nbelieve that it is this view, not Justice Brennan's, that commands\n\nour allegiance.    The district court's failure to accord similar\n\nweight to this approach was not justified.\n\n     All members of the Court in Gingles agreed that only \"legally\n\nsignificant\" racial bloc voting is cognizable under § 2.                  They\n\n\n                                    53\n\fdisagreed   sharply,    however,   on      the   sort   of   proof   that   would\n\nimplicate this provision.      Justice Brennan held that a \"minority\n\nmust   be   able   to   demonstrate     that     the    white   majority    votes\n\nsufficiently as a bloc to enable it . . . usually to defeat the\n\nminority's preferred candidate.\" Gingles, 478 U.S. at 51. Justice\n\nO'Connor, on the other hand, argued that such a showing did not\n\nwarrant judicial intervention: \"[A] reviewing court should be\n\nrequired to find more than simply that the minority group does not\n\nusually attain an undiluted measure of electoral success.\"                  Id. at\n\n99 (O'Connor, J., concurring).        Instead, she would require a court\n\nto \"find that even substantial minority success will be highly\n\ninfrequent under the challenged plan before it may conclude, on\n\nthis basis alone, that the plan operates to 'cancel out or minimize\n\nthe voting strength of [the] racial grou[p].'\"                   Id. at 99-100\n\n(quoting White, 412 U.S. at 765) (alterations in original).\n\n       Justice O'Connor's admonition that federal courts should stay\n\ntheir hand absent proof that \"even substantial minority success\n\nwill be highly infrequent\" receives formal expression in her\n\ninsistence that the racial bloc voting inquiry must include an\n\nexamination of the causes underlying divergent voting patterns.\n\nBoth Justice Brennan and Justice O'Connor recognized that racial\n\nbloc voting is intimately related to the responsiveness of elected\n\nofficials to the interests of minorities, one of the factors\n\nconsidered as part of the \"totality of circumstances.\" As Justice\n\nBrennan indicated, \"[n]ot only does '[v]oting along racial lines'\n\ndeprive minority voters of their preferred representatives in these\n\n\n                                      54\n\fcircumstances, it also 'allows those elected to ignore [minority]\n\ninterests without fear of political consequences.'\" Id. at 48 n.14\n\n(quoting Rogers v. Lodge, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110790\"><a href=\"/opinion/110790/rogers-v-lodge/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">613</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 623 (1982) (alterations in\n\noriginal)). The close tie between bloc voting and representatives'\n\nresponsiveness noted by the Court in Rogers and confirmed by\n\nJustice Brennan rests on common sense: Public officials need not\n\naddress concerns expressed by minorities so long as white bloc\n\nvoting ensures that they will remain minority concerns.   The Court\n\nin Rogers and Justice Brennan, however, differed sharply over the\n\nsort of polarized voting that might provide elected officials with\n\nsuch assurances and federal courts with grounds to intervene.   The\n\nCourt in Rogers held that this close identification was warranted\n\nonly where racial political considerations were present, that is,\n\nwhere white bloc voting caused \"minority candidates [to] lose\n\nelections solely because of their race.\"   Rogers, 458 U.S. at 623\n\n(emphasis added). Justice Brennan's approach, by contrast, assumes\n\nthat political leaders may safely ignore minority concerns even\n\nwhere black and white voters are separated only by differing\n\ninterests.   Put another way, Justice Brennan's bloc voting test\n\naccords governing majorities linked only by the perception of\n\ncommon interests the same permanence and thus relevance under § 2\n\nas white blocs cemented by racial prejudice.\n\n     Justice O'Connor not only rejected Justice Brennan's polarized\n\nvoting standard but was also unwilling to join in the questionable\n\nassumption that minorities are unable to influence elections and\n\nsecure the attention of public officials where these groups have\n\n\n                                55\n\fbeen    unsuccessful      in    their    efforts      to   elect    their      preferred\n\nrepresentatives.          Gingles, 478 U.S. at 100-101 (O'Connor, J.,\n\nconcurring).       Unlike Justice Brennan, she argued that \"Congress\n\nalso intended that explanations of the reasons why white voters\n\nrejected minority candidates would be probative of the likelihood\n\nthat candidates elected without decisive minority support would be\n\nwilling to take the minority's interests into account.\"                       Id. at 100\n\n(O'Connor, J., concurring).              Following Rogers, Justice O'Connor\n\nbelieved that a minority group's prospects for future electoral\n\nsuccess and the likelihood that elected officials will take account\n\nof their interests differ materially \"in a community where racial\n\nanimosity    is    absent      although    the   interests         of    racial   groups\n\ndiverge.\" Id. (O'Connor, J., concurring). A tendency among whites\n\nto cast their votes on the basis of race presents a far more\n\ndurable obstacle to the coalition-building upon which minority\n\nelectoral success depends than disagreements over ideology for, as\n\nProfessor    Ely    observes,      \"prejudice         blinds   us       to   overlapping\n\ninterests    that    in   fact    exist.\"      John    Hart    Ely,      Democracy   and\n\nDistrust 153 (1980).           Representatives who owe their office to the\n\nsupport of majorities bound by prejudice need not attend to the\n\ninterests of minorities, since the bias uniting their constituents\n\nensures that these issues will remain minority concerns. Where, on\n\nthe other hand, voting patterns correlate with partisan affiliation\n\nor     perceived    interest,      the    open     channels        of    communication\n\nfacilitate a recognition of points of common ground that might\n\notherwise go undetected.           Elected officials in these communities\n\n\n                                          56\n\fcannot ignore minority interests because this group might be part\n\nof the winning coalition that votes them out of office.        The deep\n\ndivision between Justice Brennan and Justice O'Connor on the\n\nquestion   of   racial   bloc   voting   thus   reflects   fundamentally\n\ndifferent views of political factions and our constitutional and\n\nstatutory arrangements for accommodating their simultaneous demands\n\nfor fluidity and fixity.26\n\n     26\n      The dissent contends that we have departed from\ncontrolling Supreme Court precedent in requiring plaintiffs to\nshow more than divergent voting patterns among white and minority\nvoters in order to establish legally significant bloc voting.\nThe dissent properly points out that a majority of the Court in\nGingles held that racial bloc voting rests on proof that \"the\nwhite majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it . . .\nusually to defeat the minority's preferred candidate.\" Gingles,\n478 U.S. at 51. As the Court's recent unanimous decision in\nVoinovich v. Quilter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112824\"><a href=\"/opinion/112824/voinovich-v-quilter/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1149</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1157 (1993), indicates,\nthis standard is hardly controversial. The Justices in Gingles,\nhowever, were sharply divided on the crucial, separate issue of\nthe sort of showing necessary to establish \"legally significant\"\nbloc voting--that is, the conditions that enable courts to\npredict that a majority bloc will consistently \"defeat the\nminority's preferred candidate.\" The dissent correctly concludes\nthat the approach taken by Justice White and Justice O'Connor,\nrather than that offered by Justice Brennan, should govern this\nsecond inquiry. Thus, we are in full agreement with the dissent\nthat the possible causes of polarized voting must be examined\nbecause \"they call into question the consistency with which the\nwhite bloc will oppose minority-preferred candidates.\" Dissent\nat ___.\n     As we state in the text, we regard evidence that divergent\nvoting patterns are attributable to partisan affiliation or\nperceived interests rather than race as quite probative on the\nquestion of a minority group's future success at the polls. The\ndissent, however, while apparently willing to consider other\npossible non-racial causes, asserts that partisan affiliation is\ninsignificant. We are told, in fact, that \"the Voting Rights\nAct, as interpreted in Gingles and succeeding cases, presupposes\npartisan voting.\" Dissent at ___. This refusal to distinguish\nracial politics from partisan politics strikes us as utterly\ninconsistent with the unbroken line of authority extending from\nWhitcomb and White through Justice Marshall's dissent in Bolden\nand the 1982 amendments to the controlling concurring opinions in\nGingles the dissent purports to embrace.\n\n                                   57\n\f      Given that the divergent voting patterns in this case are in\n\nmost instances attributable to partisan affiliation rather than\n\nrace, it is thus far from coincidental that the district court\n\nfound no evidence of unresponsiveness on the part of elected\n\nofficials in any of the contested counties.   The irony, of course,\n\nis that the subdistricting remedy sought by plaintiffs provides\n\nmost judges with the same opportunity to ignore minority voters'\n\ninterests without fear of political reprisal they would possess if\n\nelections were in fact dominated by racial bloc voting.\n\n                       D. Partisan Politics\n\n     We need not hold that plaintiffs must supply conclusive proof\n\nthat a minority group's failure to elect representatives of its\n\nchoice is caused by racial animus in the white electorate in order\n\nto decide that the district court's judgment must be reversed.   It\n\nis true that such a requirement could be inferred from the text of\n\n§ 2 (prohibiting \"denial[s] or abridgement[s] of the right . . . to\n\nvote on account of race or color\"); the caselaw Congress intended\n\nto codify in amending the provision, see, e.g., Whitcomb, 403 U.S.\n\nat 153 (vote dilution does not lie when losses at the polls do not\n\nreflect \"built-in bias against poor Negroes\"); the Senate Report,\n\nsee S. Rep. 417 at 33 (equating proof of racial bloc voting with\n\nevidence that \"race is the predominant determinant of political\n\npreference\"), reprinted in 1982 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News at\n\n211; the testimony of prominent supporters of the Act, see, e.g.,\n\nHearings on the Voting Rights Act Before the Subcomm. on the\n\nConstitution of the Senate Comm. of the Judiciary, 97th Cong., 2d\n\n\n                                58\n\fSess. 1367-68 (statement of Prof. Drew Days) (§ 2 implicated \"where\n\na combination of public activity and private discrimination have\n\njoined to make it virtually impossible for minorities to play a\n\nmeaningful role in the electoral process\"); and the controlling\n\nopinions of the Supreme Court.             See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 100\n\n(O'Connor,    J.,   concurring)     (distinguishing    communities   where\n\npolarized voting is attributable to \"racial hostility\" and those in\n\nwhich \"racial animosity is absent although the interests of racial\n\ngroups diverge\").      There is also a powerful argument supporting a\n\nrule that plaintiffs to establish legally significant racial bloc\n\nvoting must prove that their failure to elect representatives of\n\ntheir choice cannot be characterized as a \"mere euphemism for\n\npolitical defeat at the polls,\" Whitcomb, 403 U.S. at 153, or the\n\n\"result\" of \"partisan politics.\" Bolden, 446 U.S. at 100 (Marshall,\n\nJ., dissenting).\n\n     Describing plaintiffs' burden in terms of negating \"partisan\n\npolitics\" rather than affirmatively proving \"racial animus\"          would\n\nnot be simply a matter of nomenclature.         As Judge Wood emphasizes,\n\nthere are many other possible non-racial causes of voter behavior\n\nbeyond partisan affiliation.        A rule conditioning relief under § 2\n\nupon proof of the existence of racial animus in the electorate\n\nwould require plaintiffs to establish the absence of not only\n\npartisan     voting,   but   also    all    other   potentially   innocent\n\nexplanations for white voters' rejection of minority-preferred\n\ncandidates.    Factors that might legitimately lead white voters to\n\nwithhold support from particular minority candidates include, for\n\n\n                                     59\n\fexample, limited campaign funds, inexperience, or a reputation\n\nbesmirched by scandal.       Because these additional factors map only\n\nimperfectly     onto    partisan    affiliation,    detailed   multivariate\n\nanalysis might then be the evidence of choice.          The argument would\n\nthen be that without this additional inquiry, courts that confine\n\ntheir scrutiny to partisan voting might well find racial bloc\n\nvoting in circumstances where the losses of minority-preferred\n\ncandidates were actually attributable to causes other than race.\n\nThis result it is urged, might unfairly tip the scales in favor of\n\nliability.\n\n       This argument possesses considerable force.           Certainly, the\n\nallocation of proof in § 2 cases must reflect the central purpose\n\nof the Voting Rights Act and its intended liberality as well as the\n\npractical difficulties of proof in the real world of trial.              In\n\ncountless areas of the law weighty legal conclusions frequently\n\nrest on methodologies that would make scientists blush. The use of\n\nsuch    blunt   instruments    in    examining     complex   phenomena   and\n\ncorresponding reliance on inference owes not so much to a lack of\n\ntechnical sophistication among judges, although this is often true,\n\nbut to an awareness that greater certitude frequently may be\n\npurchased only at the expense of other values.           Here, we are told\n\nthat we cannot ignore the significant and, assertedly, unacceptable\n\nsubstantive consequences that would accompany a more nuanced bloc\n\nvoting inquiry.        Requiring plaintiffs affirmatively to establish\n\nthat white voters' rejection of minority-preferred candidates was\n\nmotivated by racial animus would make racial bloc voting both\n\n\n                                      60\n\fdifficult and, considering the additional analysis that would be\n\nneeded, expensive to establish. See, e.g., McCrary, Discriminatory\n\nIntent: The Continuing Relevance of \"Purpose\" Evidence in Vote-\n\nDilution Lawsuits, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. J. 463, 492 (1985).              Moreover, it\n\nwould facilitate the use of thinly-veiled proxies by permitting,\n\nfor example, evidence that a minority candidate was regarded as\n\n\"unqualified\" or \"corrupt\" to defeat a claim that white voters'\n\nrefusal to support him was based on race or ethnicity.                    The\n\nargument continues that an inquiry into causation beyond partisan\n\naffiliation    seems   inconsistent   with       the   fundamental    division\n\nbetween \"partisan politics\" and \"racial vote dilution\" set out by\n\nthe Court in Whitcomb and White and confirmed by Congress.               Legal\n\nstandards     of   necessity   reflect       a     balance    of     competing\n\nconsiderations.    Finally, the argument continues that limiting the\n\nracial bloc voting inquiry to a determination whether or not\n\ndivergent voting patterns are attributable to partisan differences\n\nor an underlying divergence in interests best captures the mandate\n\nof § 2.27   Having said this, we need not resolve the debate today.\n\nWhether or not the burden of the plaintiffs to prove bloc voting\n\nincludes the burden to explain partisan influence, the result is\n\nthe same.     This is so even if the partisan voting is viewed as a\n\ndefensive parry.\n\n\n\n     27\n      The facts of this case do not require us to determine\nwhether defendants may attempt to prove that losses by minority-\npreferred candidates are attributable to non-racial causes other\nthan partisan affiliation. We express no opinion on this\nentirely separate question.\n\n                                  61\n\f      Finally, we recognize that even partisan affiliation may serve\n\nas proxy for illegitimate racial considerations.       Minority voters,\n\nat least those residing in the contested counties in this case,\n\nhave tended uniformly to support the Democratic Party. At the same\n\ntime, a majority of white voters in most counties have consistently\n\nvoted for district court candidates fielded by the Republican\n\nParty.    Noting   this   persistent,   albeit   imperfect   correlation\n\nbetween party and race, plaintiffs assert that a determination that\n\npartisan affiliation best explains voting patterns should not\n\nforeclose § 2 liability in this case because the Republican and\n\nDemocratic Parties are proxies for racial and ethnic groups in\n\nTexas.   Whitcomb's distinction between \"racial vote dilution\" and\n\n\"political defeat at the polls\" should not control, they contend,\n\nfor      \"partisan        politics\"     is       \"racial     politics.\"\n\n\n\n      We fully agree with the plaintiffs that the bloc voting\n\ninquiry, like the \"question whether the political processes are\n\n'equally open,'\" must rest \"upon a searching practical evaluation\n\nof the 'past and present reality.'\" S.Rep. 417 at 30 (quoting\n\nWhite, 412 U.S. at 769-770), reprinted in 1982 U.S. Code Cong. &\n\nAdmin. News at 208.        Indeed, the refusal of Congress and the\n\nSupreme Court to equate losses at the polls with actionable vote\n\ndilution where these unfavorable results owe more to party than\n\nrace may be traced directly to this \"functional\" view of political\n\nlife.    Plaintiffs are therefore entirely correct in maintaining\n\nthat courts should not summarily dismiss vote dilution claims in\n\n\n                                  62\n\fcases where racially divergent voting patterns correspond with\n\npartisan affiliation as \"political defeats\" not cognizable under\n\n§ 2.\n\n       We do not agree, however, that a \"functional\" and \"practical\"\n\nreview of Texas judicial elections exposes political parties as\n\nproxies for race or ethnicity.       In assessing the record before us,\n\nwe do not indulge in the hopeful yet unrealistic assumption that\n\ndecisions to support particular political parties among black and\n\nwhite voters in all cases rest on issues other than race.               We\n\ninstead focus on the same two factors cited by the Court in\n\nWhitcomb and the concurring Justices in Gingles.            First, white\n\nvoters constitute the majority of not only the Republican Party,\n\nbut also the Democratic Party, even in several of the counties in\n\nwhich the former dominates.     In Dallas County, for example, 30-40%\n\nof   white   voters   consistently   support   Democrats,   making   white\n\nDemocrats more numerous than all of the minority Democratic voters\n\ncombined.    The suggestion that Republican voters are galvanized by\n\na \"white\" or \"anti-minority\" agenda is plausible only to the extent\n\nthat the Democratic Party can be viewed as a vehicle for advancing\n\ndistinctively minority interests, which clearly is not the case.\n\nAt the same time, white Democrats have in recent years experienced\n\nthe same electoral defeats as minority voters.        If we are to hold\n\nthat these losses at the polls, without more, give rise to a racial\n\nvote dilution claim warranting special relief for minority voters,\n\na principle by which we might justify withholding similar relief\n\n\n\n\n                                     63\n\ffrom white Democrats is not readily apparent.          See Whitcomb, 403\n\nU.S. at 153.\n\n     Second,    both     political    parties,   and       especially   the\n\nRepublicans, aggressively recruited minority lawyers to run on\n\ntheir party's ticket.        Consequently, white as well as minority\n\nvoters found themselves not infrequently voting against candidates\n\nsharing their respective racial or ethnic backgrounds in favor of\n\ntheir party's nominee.        In particular, the undisputed evidence\n\ndiscloses that white voters in most counties, both Republican and\n\nDemocratic, without fail supported the minority candidates slated\n\nby their parties at levels equal to or greater than those enjoyed\n\nby white candidates, even where the minority candidate was opposed\n\nby a white candidate. In Dallas County, for example, Judge Wright,\n\na black woman, received the greatest recorded percentage of the\n\nwhite vote (77%) in her race against a white Democrat.         To conclude\n\non this record that political parties serve as proxies for race is\n\nsimply    unwarranted.    Because    the   evidence   in   most   instances\n\nunmistakably shows that divergent voting patterns among white and\n\nminority voters are best explained by partisan affiliation, we\n\nconclude that plaintiffs have failed to establish racial bloc\n\nvoting in most, but not all, of the counties.28\n\n                             E. Two Objections\n\n     The Houston Lawyers' Association and amicus the United States\n\nraise     two   particular      objections    that     merit      additional\n\n     28\n      Defendant Judge Entz has contended throughout this\nlitigation that § 2, as amended, is unconstitutional. In view of\nour construction of the statute, we need not reach this question.\n\n                                     64\n\fconsideration. These arguments closely track those made by Justice\n\nBrennan--arguments rejected by five members of the Supreme Court in\n\nGingles.    Nevertheless, the urgency with which they are pressed\n\nhere warrants a further explanation of the reasons underlying the\n\nviews expressed by Justice White and Justice O'Connor in their\n\nseparate opinions.\n\n     The Association contends that a requirement that plaintiffs\n\nprove that their failure to elect representatives of their choice\n\nis   attributable     to    white     bloc     voting     rooted    in     racial\n\nconsiderations is presumptively inconsistent with § 2's focus on\n\n\"results.\" The Association reads this test to impose on plaintiffs\n\nthe burden of affirmatively establishing that white voters are\n\nmotivated     by   racial   animus     in     selecting    candidates.        So\n\ncharacterized, the racial bloc voting standard we apply today\n\nallegedly     contravenes   the     fundamental     purpose    of    the    1982\n\namendments by reintroducing the \"intent\" test announced in Mobile\n\nv. Bolden, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110246\"><a href=\"/opinion/110246/mobile-v-bolden/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1980).

J. 495, 498 (1985).             That is not so.\n\n     The    Association     does     not     seriously    contend    that    the\n\nlegislative history accompanying the amendments to § 2 lends direct\n\nsupport for its position.         The Senate Report quite unambiguously\n\ndeclares that Congress intended to \"make clear that plaintiffs need\n\nnot prove a discriminatory purpose in the adoption or maintenance\n\nof the challenged practice or system in order to establish a\n\nviolation.\"    S. Rep. 417 at 27 (emphasis added), reprinted in 1982\n\n\n                                      65\n\fU.S. Code Cong. & Admin News at 205.            Moreover, far from suggesting\n\nthat    the     presence    of    racial    animus    in   the    electorate      was\n\nirrelevant, supporters of the 1982 legislation maintained that the\n\namendments were necessary precisely in order to reach such \"private\n\ndiscrimination.\"          See, e.g., Hearings on the Voting Rights Act\n\nBefore the Subcomm. on the Constitution of the Senate Comm. of the\n\nJudiciary, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 1367-68 (statement of Prof. Drew\n\nDays).    The Association instead insists that a standard requiring\n\n§ 2 plaintiffs to show that their failure to elect representatives\n\nof their choice is attributable to white bloc voting rooted in\n\nracial considerations \"frustrate[s] the goals Congress sought to\n\nachieve by repudiating the intent test of [Bolden].\"                   Gingles, 478\n\nU.S. at 71 (opinion of Brennan, J.).              Given the palpable tension\n\nbetween \"the       goals    Congress   sought    to    achieve\"    and    those    it\n\nactually expressed, it is hardly surprising that the principles the\n\nAssociation purports to locate in the Senate Report bear only a\n\npassing resemblance to those offered by Congress. Compare Gingles,\n\n478 U.S. at 70-73 (opinion of Brennan, J.) with S. Rep. 417 at 36-\n\n37, reprinted in 1982 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin News at 214-15.\n\n       More importantly, the Association's contention that an inquiry\n\ninto the explanations underlying racially divergent voting patterns\n\nsomehow       conflicts    with    Congress'    abandonment       of   the   intent\n\nrequirement announced in Bolden completely ignores the fact that\n\nthe Senate Report expressly adopted the standard we employ in\n\ncodifying the \"results\" test.              Indeed, like Justice Marshall in\n\nBolden itself, see 446 U.S. at 109 (Marshall, J., dissenting), the\n\n\n                                           66\n\fSenate Report reiterated Whitcomb's holding that \"[t]he failure of\n\nthe   ghetto   to    have   legislative       seats   in    proportion   to    its\n\npopulation emerges more as a function of losing elections than of\n\nbuilt-in bias against poor Negroes\" precisely in order to show that\n\n\"intent had [not] been required to prove a violation.\"                S. Rep. 417\n\nat 21 (quoting Whitcomb, 403 U.S. at 153), reprinted in 1982 U.S.\n\nCode Cong. & Admin News at 198.              In keeping with Whitcomb, the\n\nSenate Report equated \"racial bloc voting\" with proof that \"race is\n\nthe predominant determinant of political preference.\"                 Id. at 33,\n\nreprinted in 1982 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin News at 211.                         The\n\nAssociation's       assertion   that    the    test    we   confirm    today    is\n\ninconsistent    with    \"the    goals   Congress      sought   to   achieve\"   in\n\namending § 2 becomes plausible only if Whitcomb is purged from our\n\nvoting rights jurisprudence. It is therefore not coincidental that\n\nits brief, like Justice Brennan's opinion, see Gingles, 478 U.S. at\n\n61-74, fails to include a citation, let alone a discussion, of the\n\ndecision Congress intended to codify.\n\n      The United States offers a second argument incorporating\n\nelements of Justice O'Connor's as well as Justice Brennan's opinion\n\nin Gingles.     The government agrees with Justice O'Connor that an\n\ninquiry into the causes underlying polarized voting is appropriate\n\nin certain circumstances.        It follows Justice Brennan, however, in\n\nmaintaining that evidence tending to show that divergent voting\n\npatterns are attributable to partisan affiliation or a divergence\n\nin interests rather than race is irrelevant in assessing whether\n\n\n\n\n                                        67\n\fplaintiffs have established legally significant white bloc voting.\n\nWe disagree with this argument as well.\n\n     The United States' assertion that partisan affiliation cannot\n\nserve to explain voting patterns finds no support in Justice\n\nO'Connor's opinion.         The very inquiry it seeks to exclude--whether\n\nelection returns track \"an underlying divergence in the interests\n\nof minority and white voters,\"--was the only non-racial cause\n\nexpressly    cited    in    her   opinion       as     a   possible   explanation     of\n\ndivergent voting patterns. See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 100 (O'Connor,\n\nJ., concurring).\n\n     The    United    States      argues       that    the   political     differences\n\nfrequently observed among white and minority voters are largely the\n\nproduct     of    disparities       in   socioeconomic           status,    which   are\n\nthemselves       attributable     to     the    presence      or    absence   of    past\n\ndiscrimination.        In    this    view,      a     standard     that   would   permit\n\ndivergence in interest to preclude the establishment of racial bloc\n\nvoting \"would render meaningless the Senate Report factor that\n\naddresses the impact of low socioeconomic status on a minority\n\ngroup's level of participation.\"                Gingles, 478 U.S. at 69.\n\n     This argument is not without force; it is, however, clearly\n\nforeclosed by the Senate Report.                 Congress was not unaware that\n\npolitical preference often correlates strongly with socioeconomic\n\nstatus; particularized needs clearly give rise to particularized\n\ninterests.       This observation did not, however, lead Congress to\n\nsoften the line between partisan politics and racial vote dilution\n\nestablished by the Court in Whitcomb.                  To the contrary, the Senate\n\n\n                                           68\n\fReport not only adopted Whitcomb's holding without modification,\n\nbut expressly reminded its readers in so doing that the vote\n\ndilution claim dismissed by the Whitcomb Court as \"a mere euphemism\n\nfor political defeat at the polls\" had been brought by \"black\n\nghetto residents with [distinct] legislative interests.\"                   S. Rep.\n\n417 at 20, reprinted in 1982 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin News at 198.\n\nThe     argument   pressed    here   by    the     United      States    has   been\n\nacknowledged, and rejected, by Congress.\n\n      The Senate factor cited by Justice Brennan in support of his\n\nrefusal to attach relevance to a divergence of interests expressly\n\nrelates, not to whether minority groups have been able to elect\n\nrepresentatives of their choice, but to \"the extent to which\n\nmembers    of    the   minority   group    .   .    .   bear    the     effects   of\n\ndiscrimination in areas such as education, employment, and health,\n\nwhich    hinder    their   ability   to    participate      in    the    political\n\nprocess.\"       S. Rep. 417 at 29 (emphasis added), reprinted in 1982\n\nU.S. Code Cong. & Admin News at 206.               As the Court in Chisom v.\n\nRoemer confirmed, § 2 plaintiffs \"must allege an abridgement of the\n\nopportunity to participate in the political process and to elect\n\nrepresentatives of one's choice.\"          111 S.Ct. at 2365 (emphasis in\n\noriginal).      The effects of past discrimination, as the text of the\n\nSenate Report indicates, pertain solely to the \"political access\"\n\nprong of a § 2 claim.        It is by considering these effects in this\n\nregard, not in the bloc voting inquiry, that courts give effect to\n\ncongressional intent.        The United States' approach, by contrast,\n\nwould allow this single factor to assume dispositive significance\n\n\n                                      69\n\fin both of these inquiries.   In so doing, it would permit liability\n\nto attach, in direct conflict with the Senate Report, upon \"the\n\nmere existence of underrepresentation plus a history of dual\n\nschools.\"   S. Rep. 417 at 34, reprinted in 1982 U.S. Code Cong. &\n\nAdmin News at 212.     Electoral losses that are attributable to\n\npartisan politics do not implicate the protections of § 2.\n\n\n\n\n                                 70\n\f   IV.    Other Legal Errors Affecting the Vote Dilution Inquiry\n\n     Defendants cite three additional legal errors that allegedly\n\ninfect the district court's findings of illegal vote dilution in\n\neach of the counties.      Specifically, they argue that the district\n\ncourt    erred    in:    (1)   excluding   elections   pitting   Hispanic\n\ncandidates against white candidates in counties in which the\n\nevidence unmistakably showed that black and Hispanic voters were\n\ncohesive; (2) refusing to consider the paucity of minority lawyers\n\nin assessing the extent to which members of minority groups had\n\nbeen elected to the district court; and (3) finding that the\n\neffects of past discrimination hindered the ability of minority\n\ngroups to participate in the political process despite the presence\n\nof little or no evidence suggesting that their participation was in\n\nfact depressed.      We examine these issues in turn.\n\n            A. Cohesiveness of Different Minority Groups\n\n     The importance of the distinction in § 2 jurisprudence between\n\nillegal vote dilution and political defeat, between protecting\n\nracial minorities and fostering the work of political coalitions,\n\nraises the stakes for the question whether different racial or\n\nethnic minority groups, usually blacks and Hispanics, may combine\n\nto form a single minority group within the meaning of the Voting\n\nRights Act.      Judges and commentators alike have questioned whether\n\ntransitory unions rooted in political expedience may be properly\n\nequated with those whose source lies in the more enduring bonds\n\nsupplied by a shared race or ethnicity.

Nevertheless, we have treated the issue as a question of\n\nfact, allowing aggregation of different minority groups where the\n\nevidence suggests that they are politically cohesive, see, e.g.,\n\nMidland I.S.D., 812 F.2d at 1500-02, and we need not revisit this\n\nquestion here.\n\n     This issue is raised today in the context of the particular\n\nelections to which the district court looked as part of its inquiry\n\ninto racial bloc voting.    This court has consistently held that\n\nelections between white candidates are generally less probative in\n\nexamining the success of minority-preferred candidates, generally\n\non grounds that such elections do not provide minority voters with\n\nthe choice of a minority candidate.   See, e.g., Campos v. City of\n\nBaytown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502445\"><a href=\"/opinion/502445/tony-campos-cross-appellants-v-city-of-baytown-texas-cross-appellees/\"><span class=\"volume\">840</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1240</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1245 (5th Cir. 1988); Citizens for a Better\n\nGretna v.

For\n\nthis reason, courts usually focus on those elections involving\n\nblack or Hispanic candidates in examining whether black or Hispanic\n\nvoters enjoy an equal opportunity to elect representatives of their\n\nchoice. Where blacks and Hispanics are cohesive, we have held that\n\nthe relevant elections are those including either Hispanic or black\n\ncandidates. See, e.g., Baytown, 840 F.2d at 1245.       Defendants\n\ncontend that the district court erred in refusing to consider\n\nelections pitting Hispanic and white candidates in Harris and\n\n\n                                72\n\fTarrant Counties, counties in which plaintiffs proceed on behalf of\n\nblack voters only, but where the evidence indisputably showed that\n\nblacks and Hispanics were politically cohesive.                   In light of our\n\nprecedents, we must agree.\n\n     Blacks and Hispanics have joined forces for purposes of this\n\nsuit in Midland, Lubbock, and Ector Counties.               In these counties,\n\nwhite-Hispanic      elections     are     relevant     in        proving       legally\n\nsignificant white bloc voting, for the Hispanic candidate provides\n\nthe combined Hispanic-black minority with a viable minority choice.\n\nBut plaintiffs contend that where they represent only black voters,\n\nwhite-Hispanic elections in which the Hispanic candidate received\n\nthe support of black voters are irrelevant.                      A difference in\n\nlitigation strategy cannot support this distinction.                  Cohesion is\n\na fact, not a strategic card to be played at the caprice of a\n\nplaintiff. As we stated in Campos, \"if the statistical evidence is\n\nthat Blacks and Hispanics together vote for the Black or Hispanic\n\ncandidate,   then     cohesion    is    shown.\"      Id.    at    1245     (footnote\n\nomitted).    If blacks and Hispanics vote cohesively, they are\n\nlegally a single minority group, and elections with a candidate\n\nfrom this    single    minority    group     are   elections       with    a   viable\n\nminority candidate.\n\n     Plaintiffs next argue that there is evidence in the record\n\nthat blacks and Hispanics are not politically cohesive in Harris\n\nand Tarrant Counties.      They do not tell us to which evidence they\n\nrefer, and understandably so.           The record shows that blacks and\n\nHispanics were more cohesive in Harris and Tarrant Counties than in\n\n\n                                        73\n\fMidland and Ector Counties, counties in which plaintiffs represent\n\nboth blacks and Hispanics and the district court found cohesion.\n\n     In Harris County, Taebel studied 45 elections in which he\n\ndetermined the percentage of black and Hispanic votes cast for the\n\nminority/winning candidate. In 35 elections the black and Hispanic\n\nvote percentages varied by less than 10%.         Similarly, the levels of\n\nblack and Hispanic support for the same candidate were within ten\n\npercentage points in 13 of the 17 elections studied in Tarrant\n\nCounty.    In Midland County, by contrast, the black and Hispanic\n\nvoting percentages differed by less than 10% in only 4 of the 8\n\nelections analyzed; in Ector County, this close correlation between\n\nthe preferences of Hispanic and black voters was shown in just 2 of\n\n10 elections.    Under the present law of this circuit, there is no\n\nerror in the district court's findings of cohesion in Midland,\n\nEctor,    and   Lubbock   Counties,    because     in   those   counties   a\n\nsignificant number of blacks and Hispanics usually voted for the\n\nsame candidates.    Gingles, 478 U.S. at 56.        But this standard also\n\ncompels the conclusion that there is also black-Hispanic cohesion\n\nin Harris and Tarrant Counties.            The district court thus clearly\n\nerred in ignoring elections involving Hispanic and white candidates\n\nin these counties.29\n\n     29\n      The dissent points out that defendants did not ask the\ntrial court to make a specific finding that black and Hispanic\nvoters were politically cohesive in Harris and Tarrant Counties.\nThis observation, while correct, is beside the point, for that is\nnot the claim they raise on appeal. Rather, defendants argue\nthat the district court improperly refused to consider elections\ninvolving Hispanic candidates studied by Dr. Taebel, their\nexpert. This question is most assuredly before us and, given the\noverwhelming evidence of cohesiveness among black and Hispanic\n\n                                      74\n\f           B. Relevance of Small Number of Minority Lawyers\n\n     The     absence   of    minority   office   holders   is   typically   an\n\nimportant consideration in dilution cases. In this litigation, the\n\nsmall number of minority judges in the target counties has been the\n\ncornerstone of the plaintiffs' proof.\n\n     The office of district judge has more eligibility requirements\n\nthan the age and citizenship prerequisites of many public offices.\n\nA person must be a licensed attorney in the state of Texas for four\n\nyears, and a resident of the district for two years, before\n\nbecoming eligible for the post.         The need for district judges to be\n\nexperienced lawyers is obvious.\n\n     Undisputed evidence shows that in all of the counties, the\n\npercentage of minority lawyers was much smaller than the percentage\n\nof minority voters.         In fact, minority lawyers disproportionately\n\nserve as judges, when their percentage among all eligible lawyers\n\nis considered.

In Ector County, for example, one\n\nsurvey found five eligible Hispanic lawyers and only one eligible\n\nblack lawyer.

Past Discrimination\n\n       The     district    court      also    found    that    Texas'    history      of\n\ndiscrimination \"touched many aspects of the lives of minorities in\n\nthe    Counties      in    question       including     their       access     to    and\n\nparticipation in the democratic system governing this State and\n\ntheir socio-economic status.\"30               The district court, however, did\n\n       30\n            Two separate Zimmer factors guided the court's inquiry:\n\n       1. the extent of any history of official discrimination\n       in the state or political subdivision that touched the\n       right of the members of the minority group to register,\n       to vote, or otherwise to participate in the democratic\n       process;\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\n       5. the extent to which members of the minority group in\n\n                                             77\n\fnot   refer   to   specific   facts     in   the   record   to   support   this\n\nconclusion.        Instead,   the    court   cited    a   1980   Civil   Rights\n\nCommission Report describing civil rights developments in Texas\n\nduring the years 1968-1978 and a 1981 district court opinion\n\ndetailing race relations between minority and white residents of\n\none of Texas' smaller cities during the 1960's and 1970's.\n\n      Texas' long history of discrimination against its black and\n\nHispanic citizens in all areas of public life is not the subject of\n\ndispute among the parties.          Nor has anyone questioned plaintiffs'\n\nassertion that disparities between white and minority residents in\n\nseveral socioeconomic categories are the tragic legacies of the\n\nState's discriminatory practices.            Defendants do argue, however,\n\nthat these factors, by themselves, are insufficient to support the\n\ndistrict court's \"finding\" that minorities do not enjoy equal\n\naccess to the political process absent some indication that these\n\neffects of past discrimination actually hamper the ability of\n\nminorities to participate.          We again agree.\n\n      It would seem tautological that a factor directing courts to\n\ndetermine whether past discrimination hinders a minority group's\n\naccess to the political process would require a showing that the\n\ngroup does not in fact participate to the same extent as other\n\n\n\n      the state or political subdivision bear the effects of\n      discrimination in such areas as education, employment\n      and health, which hinder their ability to participate\n      effectively in the political process;\n\nS.

Where these\n       conditions are shown, and where the level of black\n       participation in politics is depressed, plaintiffs need\n       not prove any further causal nexus between their\n       disparate socio-economic status and the depressed level\n       of political participation.\n\nS. Rep. 417 at 29 n.114 (emphasis added), reprinted in 1982 U.S.\n\nCode    Cong.    &    Admin.      News   at    207    n.114.      As    this   statement\n\ndiscloses, the Senate Report, while not insisting upon a causal\n\nnexus between socioeconomic status and depressed participation,\n\nclearly did not dispense with proof that participation in the\n\npolitical process is in fact depressed among minority citizens. In\n\napparently holding that socioeconomic disparities and a history of\n\ndiscrimination, without more, sufficed to establish these Zimmer\n\nfactors, the district court employed the wrong legal standard.\n\n       Nor do we believe that the record before us can support such\n\na finding under the proper test.                          Plaintiffs have offered no\n\nevidence of reduced levels of black voter registration, lower\n\n\n                                              79\n\fturnout among black voters, or any other factor tending to show\n\nthat past discrimination has affected their ability to participate\n\nin the political process. While there are indications that Hispanic\n\ncitizens register to vote at a lower rate than white and black\n\ncitizens, this data provides support for such a finding in only\n\nBexar and Travis Counties, where plaintiffs proceed on behalf of\n\nHispanic voters only.\n\n      Plaintiffs contend that the district court could have relied\n\non the opinion offered by Dr. Brischetto, who, during his testimony\n\nregarding Bexar County, stated:\n\n      Well, certainly having less of these socioeconomic\n      resources or characteristics to draw on, we find that\n      minority voters will participate less in the electoral\n      system.    Education is an important resource.        For\n      example, it enables people to feel like they are more a\n      part of and take part in the election system to a greater\n      extent. Lacking that they participate less. So it is\n      important, it has an effect certainly on their\n      participation when they are subordinate status in the\n      stratification system.\n\nBrischetto's statement, as its tone suggests, was not so much a\n\nfinding as a prediction or hypothesis about what one might expect\n\nto   find   among   minorities   who    still   bore   the   scars   of   past\n\ndiscrimination.     It is for this reason that he could claim that his\n\ntestimony regarding the participation of Hispanics in Bexar applied\n\nwith equal force to all of the other counties.         In fact, the nature\n\nand basis of his opinion became explicit as the testimony shifted\n\nto these other locales.     In Travis County, for example, he stated\n\nonly that \"stratification . . . may very well also be an indication\n\nof the fact that Hispanics are less likely to participate fully and\n\neffectively in the electoral system in Travis County.\" In Lubbock,\n\n                                       80\n\fBrischetto stated only that \"I think [such stratification] is an\n\nindication that minorities are less equipped with those resources\n\nthat they need to participate fully in the political system.\"\n\nFinally, he   testified    in   the    context   of   Tarrant   County   that\n\nsocioeconomic differences \"indicate[] that minorities may have a\n\ndiminished ability to participate fully in the electoral system\n\nbecause of their lower status and stratification that exists in\n\nthat community.\"\n\n     Brischetto's testimony thus provides support for the common\n\nsense proposition that depressed political participation typically\n\naccompanies poverty and a lack of education; it certainly does not\n\namount to proof that minority voters in this case failed to\n\nparticipate equally in the political processes. A district court's\n\nfindings under § 2 must rest on an \"intensely local appraisal\" of\n\nthe social and political climate of the cities and counties in\n\nwhich such suits are brought, White, 412 U.S. at 769, not the sort\n\nof generalized armchair speculation supplied by Dr. Brischetto. We\n\nneed evidence, not musings.\n\n     Plaintiffs    also   contend     that   minority   citizens'   lack   of\n\nfinancial resources makes it very difficult for minority-preferred\n\ncandidates to secure funds sufficient to run creditable county-wide\n\ncampaigns.    Here again, the inference plaintiffs ask us to draw\n\nmight well be true in most cases; regardless of its general\n\nvalidity, however, it is no substitute for proof that a minority\n\ngroup's poverty has had the predicted effect in this particular\n\ncase.   The evidence presented at trial simply does not show that\n\n\n                                      81\n\fpast discrimination has inhibited the ability of minorities to\n\nparticipate in the process.       In fact, the record discloses that\n\nminority-preferred candidates frequently raised and spent more\n\nmoney that their white opponents.\n\n     Witnesses   Coronado   and    Fitch   did    testify    that    minority\n\ncandidates generally were unable to raise the money necessary to\n\nrun county-wide. When asked about the only district court campaign\n\nin which he was personally involved, however, Coronado made no\n\nmention of money problems.        In fact, he testified that \"[Judge\n\nGallardo] ran a very good campaign.        I mean he was, he understood\n\nthe media, had people out working boxes, he had a lot of attorneys\n\nof all ethnic groups working in his campaign, a broad base campaign\n\nin the community.\" Similarly, Fitch asserted that black incumbents\n\nhad difficulty raising funds, but she attributed this difficulty to\n\n\"racial discrimination\" and black candidates' \"past record of\n\nlosing.\"\n\n     In contrast with the highly equivocal testimony of Fitch and\n\nCoronado   concerning   their   impressions      of   the   barriers   facing\n\nminority candidates, nearly all such candidates who appeared at\n\ntrial reported that they had outspent their white opponents, often\n\nby a very large amount.     In Midland County, for example, Watson\n\ntestified that she outspent her white opponent in the general\n\nelection for Justice of the Peace by a factor of six.               In Dallas\n\nCounty, Joan Winn White, Tinsley, H. Ron White, and Oliver all\n\ntestified that they had run extensive, well-financed campaigns. In\n\nparticular, Oliver stated that he spent $300,000 in a losing\n\n\n                                   82\n\feffort.     The same was true of minority-preferred candidates in\n\nHarris County.     Lee testified that she outspent her white opponent\n\nat a rate approaching twelve to one; Berry stated that the ratio in\n\nhis campaign for district court was even greater.                Finally, Leal\n\ntestified that he raised $85,000 to $90,000 to his opponent's\n\n$1,000.    A district court's findings may only rest on the evidence\n\npresented at trial. The record before us does not remotely suggest\n\nthat the visible scars of discrimination have left minority-\n\npreferred    candidates      and     their   supporters    within     minority\n\ncommunities without the funds needed to launch broad-based, county-\n\nwide campaigns.     In fact, the available evidence shows just the\n\nopposite.    For this reason, we must conclude that plaintiffs have\n\nnot established that the effects of past discrimination have\n\nhindered their ability to participate in the political process.\n\n                       V.    Texas' Linkage Interest\n\n     This case involves 172 judicial districts that coincide with\n\nnine Texas counties. Given the State of Texas' county-based system\n\nof venue, this venerable structure links the jurisdictional and\n\nelectoral bases of the district courts. In doing so, the structure\n\nadvances     the    state's        substantial    interest       in   judicial\n\neffectiveness.     Trial judges are elected by a broad range of local\n\ncitizens, rather than by a narrow constituency.              This electoral\n\nscheme balances accountability and judicial independence.\n\n     As    explained    in   detail    below,    the   state's    interest   in\n\nmaintaining the structure of this single-member judicial office\n\nmust be weighed in the totality of circumstances to determine\n\n\n                                       83\n\fwhether a § 2 violation exists.          The weight of a substantial state\n\ninterest, determined as a matter of law, is balanced against\n\nlocalized evidence of racial vote dilution. This substantial state\n\ninterest may be overcome only by evidence that sums to substantial\n\nproof of racial dilution.         Otherwise, the at-large election of\n\ndistrict court judges does not violate § 2.\n\n              A. The Structure of Texas District Courts\n\n     The district courts are the primary trial courts in Texas.\n\nDistrict judges were first elected in 1850, five years after\n\nstatehood, and every state constitution since 1861 has provided for\n\ntheir election by county residents.             All voters of the entire\n\ncounty    elect   all   the   district    judges   of   their   county.   The\n\npolitical boundaries of each county are the boundaries of the\n\njurisdiction and election base in all of the challenged counties.31\n\nMany counties in Texas have more than one district judge.            Even so,\n\ntrials are presided over by district judges acting alone. The only\n\ncollegial decision-making by district judges in counties with more\n\nthan one district judge is in the handling of some administrative\n\nmatters.    In some of the counties involved here, district courts\n\nare designated to specialize in civil, criminal, or family law\n\ncases.\n\n     The electoral bases of district judges are linked to the area\n\nover which they exercise primary jurisdiction.             This linkage has\n\nbeen in place throughout the 143 year history of judicial elections\n\n\n     31\n      One exception is the 72nd District, which encompasses both\nLubbock and Crosby Counties.\n\n                                     84\n\fin Texas.    By making coterminous the electoral and jurisdictional\n\nbases of trial courts, Texas advances the effectiveness of its\n\ncourts by balancing the virtues of accountability with the need for\n\nindependence.       The     state    attempts       to     maintain    the    fact   and\n\nappearance of judicial fairness that are central to the judicial\n\ntask, in part, by insuring that judges remain accountable to the\n\nrange of people within their jurisdiction. A broad base diminishes\n\nthe   semblance    of     bias    and    favoritism        towards     the   parochial\n\ninterests of a narrow constituency.                      Appearances are critical,\n\nbecause    \"the    very     perception        of    impropriety       and    unfairness\n\nundermines the moral authority of the courts.\"                  John L.

The fear of mixing\n\nward politics and state trial courts of general jurisdiction is\n\nwidely held.       It is not surprising then that states that elect\n\ntrial judges overwhelmingly share this structure and electoral\n\nscheme.      See    infra     note      30.

The issue of substantiality,\n\nhowever,    is    distinct   from    the     conventional   Zimmer   factor    of\n\ntenuousness and is a legal determination.\n\n     The Supreme Court has held that the finding of dilution is a\n\nfactual matter reviewable only for clear error.             Gingles, 478 U.S.\n\nat 78, 106 S. Ct. at 2780-81.          A substantial state interest is not\n\ninherently preclusive of dilution and is not raised to disprove the\n\nexistence of dilution.         Rather, the state's interest is weighed\n\nagainst proven dilution to assess whether such dilution creates § 2\n\nliability.       Houston Lawyers',           U.S. at    , 111 S.

The   collective     voice   of\n\ngenerations by their unswerving adherence to the principle of\n\nlinkage through times of extraordinary growth and change speaks to\n\nus with power.        Tradition, of course, does not make right of wrong,\n\nbut we must be cautious when asked to embrace a new revelation that\n\nright has so long been wrong.              There is no evidence that linkage\n\n\n       33\n      The twenty-five are Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida,\nGeorgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana,\nNevada, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma,\nOregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington,\nWest Virginia, and Wisconsin. Among these states, some appoint a\nportion of their trial judges, while others hold retention\nelections after initial selection by contested election. See\ngenerally 28 The Council of State Governments, The Book of the\nStates 210-12 (1990) (table 4.4).\n     Mississippi and Louisiana only recently abandoned the link\nbetween jurisdiction and electoral base in order to settle\nprolonged litigation.\n     North Carolina allows every elector within a district\ncourt's jurisdiction to vote for its judge by holding statewide\nelections after district-wide primaries.

The inescapable truth is that the result\n\nsought   by    plaintiffs      here    would    diminish      minority   influence.\n\nMinority voters would be marginalized, having virtually no impact\n\non most district court elections.               Given that district judges act\n\nalone in exercising their power, that use of the Voting Rights Act\n\nis perverse.      After subdistricting, a handful of judges would be\n\nelected from subdistricts with a majority of minority voters.\n\nCreating \"safe\" districts would leave all but a few subdistricts\n\nstripped of nearly all minority members.                  The great majority of\n\njudges would      be     elected   entirely      by   white    voters.      Minority\n\nlitigants would not necessarily have their cases assigned to one of\n\nthe   few     judges     elected      by   minority     voters.       Rather,      the\n\noverwhelming probability would be that the minority litigant would\n\nappear \"before a judge who has little direct political interest in\n\nbeing responsive to minority concerns.\"                LULAC II, 914 F.2d at 650\n\n(Higginbotham,         J.,     concurring).           Under    the    totality     of\n\ncircumstances, we must recognize that breaking the link between the\n\nelectoral base and the jurisdiction of this single-member office\n\nwould perversely lessen minority influence on the conduct of most\n\nlitigation.\n\n      The     distrust    of    judicial    subdistricts       does   not   rest   on\n\npaternalism.       It recognizes Texas' historic interest in having\n\n\n                                           95\n\fdistrict judges remain accountable to all voters in their district.\n\nRegardless of the race or residency of particular litigants, judges\n\nmake choices that affect all county residents.               Texas has insisted\n\nthat trial judges answer to all county voters at the ballot box.\n\nUnlike legislators or even appellate judges, who make decisions in\n\ngroups, each district judge holds a single-member office and acts\n\nalone.    When collegial bodies are involved, all citizens continue\n\nto elect at least one person involved in making a particular\n\ndecision. While subdistricting for multimember offices can enhance\n\nminority influence         because     members   from   minority     subdistricts\n\nparticipate in and influence all of the decisions of the larger\n\nbody, subdistricting for single-member district court judgeships\n\nwould leave minority voters with no electoral influence over the\n\nmajority of judges in each county.            Subdistricting would partially\n\ndisenfranchise citizens to whom all district judges in a county are\n\nnow accountable.\n\n     By   contrast,        under   the   present     regime,      minority   voters\n\nparticipate    in    all    judicial     elections    in   each    county.     This\n\nparticipation gives minority voters the opportunity to influence\n\nall elections, absent significant racial vote dilution. As Justice\n\nO'Connor noted in her concurring opinion in Gingles, voters can\n\nwield influence over elections even when those votes are cast for\n\nlosing candidates.         Gingles, 478 U.S. at 98-99, 106 S. Ct. at 2791\n\n(O'Connor, J., concurring).          Denying importance to this ability to\n\ninfluence asks that all measures of success be found in the win-\n\nloss column.        This mandates proportional representation as the\n\n\n                                         96\n\fmeasure of dilution, contrary to the explicit terms of § 2.\n\nIndisputably, subdistricting would assure the absence of minority\n\ninfluence over the judicial process.

Examining Texas' linking of electoral and\n\njurisdictional bases in light of these considerations, we find that\n\nit serves the substantial interests we described.\n\n\n                                       97\n\f     The   plaintiffs    contend      that    Texas   district     judges    often\n\nadjudicate controversies involving litigants who are not residents\n\nof the county.      Defendants make several responses.              First, they\n\nmaintain   that     because    a     district    judge's    area    of   primary\n\njurisdiction   is    defined    by    county-specific      venue    rules,    most\n\nresidents of a county will have their disputes adjudicated by\n\njudges they elect.      Second, the residency of particular litigants\n\nis not that important.        Regardless of the identity of litigants in\n\na case, a district judge may make decisions or grant relief that\n\nimpact primarily upon the residents of the district.\n\n     By drawing attention to venue, plaintiffs only remind us of\n\nconcerns unique to the district judge's office.                     Venue rules\n\npreserve   judicial     fairness      by     preventing    forum-shopping      and\n\ndiminishing the chances of biased adjudication.              At the same time,\n\nthe rules keep most local matters in local courts, where local\n\njuries are drawn and judges are accountable to voters for the legal\n\nand policy choices they make.34            The localized focus of district\n\ncourts is particularly evident in criminal matters, where venue is\n\nbased on events related to the offense.           Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann.\n\nch. 13 (Vernon 1977).          Domicile and hence convenience to the\n\n\n     34\n      Texas venue law, as amended in 1983, has been influenced\nby both Spanish and English principles. Besides protecting civil\ndefendants from inconvenient forums, the rules strive to ensure\nthat local matters are tried in local courts. See generally\nJoseph W. McKnight, The Spanish Influence on the Texas Law of\nCivil Procedure, 38 Texas L.

Since the propriety of\n\nvenue    goes    to    the     authority    of    the     court,   it   is    \"quasi-\n\njurisdictional        in     nature.\"      George    E.

Thus, Texas law commonly\n\nrefers to the district court's venue reach as its jurisdiction in\n\ncriminal matters.          See, e.g., Hodge v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1786503\"><a href=\"/opinion/1786503/hodge-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">289</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 292\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1975); Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. Arts. 21.02(5),\n\n21.21(5) (Vernon 1989).\n\n     Similarly, family law matters will almost always be handled by\n\nthe local district court.          See, e.g., Tex. Fam. Code Ann. §§ 3.21,\n\n11.04 (Vernon 1986) (concerning venue in divorce and parent-child\n\nrelationship suits).          Quintessentially local matters such as suits\n\nagainst counties or disputes involving title to real property must\n\nbe tried in the district court of the same county.                  Tex. Civ. Prac.\n\n& Rem. Code §§ 15.001, 15.015 (Vernon 1986).                 Whatever the area of\n\npractice--whether civil, criminal, or family law--the conclusion\n\nreached in the concurring opinion in LULAC II remains valid.\n\n\"[T]he   state    recognized       that    elimination       of    [the]     risk   and\n\nappearance of bias was essential to the office it was creating by\n\nan elaborate set of rules controlling venue.\"                      914 F.2d at 651\n\n(Higginbotham, J., concurring).                 The argument that Texas' venue\n\nrules somehow abrogate its interest in linking jurisdiction and\n\nelectoral bases is illusory.\n\n     Plaintiffs also challenge the legitimacy of the state interest\n\nin linkage by pointing to the use of visiting judges in the\n\n\n                                           99\n\fdistrict courts.      Judges not elected by a district's residents--\n\ne.g., judges from another district or retired judges--may be\n\ntemporarily assigned to a district court, when necessary to dispose\n\nof its accumulated business, by the Chief Justice or regional\n\npresiding judge.      Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 74.052 (Vernon 1988).35\n\nA typical occasion for such assignments is when the district judge\n\nis vacationing or ill.       Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that this\n\nmeasure of expedience represents an abandonment of the interests\n\nbehind linkage.      To the contrary, insofar as linkage involves the\n\nappearance of judicial fairness and independence, visiting judges\n\nare not inconsistent with its purposes.          Because visiting judges\n\nwill not stand for reelection, they do not create the impression of\n\nbias that may accompany a judge elected from a narrow constituency.\n\n     Another challenge to the legitimacy of the linkage interest is\n\nbased upon Article 5, § 7a of the Texas Constitution.           Plaintiffs\n\nreason that Texas abandoned its linkage interest by allowing the\n\nresidents of counties to \"opt out\" of the linkage structure by\n\nselecting   judges    from   regions   smaller   than   a   county.   This\n\ncontention is without merit.       As Chief Justice Phillips explained\n\nat trial, § 7a was enacted in 1985 as part of a constitutional and\n\nstatutory scheme designed to equalize court dockets by allowing the\n\nrealignment of judicial districts.         The provision states that a\n\ndistrict smaller than a county may not be created unless approved\n\nby a majority of county voters.        Tex. Const. Art. 5, § 7a(i).    The\n\n     35\n      A visiting judge may not, however, hear a civil case over\nthe objection of a party. Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 74.053 (Vernon\nSupp. 1993).\n\n                                    100\n\fpeople    of    Texas   have   jealously    reserved     to     themselves,   as\n\nindividual voters, the power to subdivide districts that have\n\nalways been the size of a county, or larger.            Nowhere in Texas' 254\n\ncounties       have   residents   voted    to   break     the    link   between\n\njurisdiction      and   electoral   base.       If   anything,      §   7a(i)'s\n\nunemployment testifies to affirmation, not abrogation, of the\n\ninterest in linkage.\n\n     Moreover, even if one county were to subdivide, the interest\n\nin linkage would not be lost in the state as a whole.

Id. at\n\n327, 93 S. Ct. at 986.      Texas' interest in preserving the structure\n\nof its judiciary by linking jurisdictional and electoral boundaries\n\nis greater than a state's interest in observing boundaries in\n\nlegislative reapportionment, because it serves substantive purposes\n\nother than convenience.\n\n     Finally, plaintiffs note that some rural district judges, and\n\nurban justices of the peace, are elected by a small number of\n\nvoters.

Civ. App.--Galveston\n\n1945, no writ).     The justice court is not a court of record, so\n\nwhen its rulings are appealed, the cases are tried de novo before\n\na county court judge--a judge chosen by district-wide election.\n\nIn great contrast, district courts are Texas' trial courts of\n\ngeneral jurisdiction, charged with trying felony cases and civil\n\nmatters of unlimited amounts in controversy.           As to rural Texas,\n\nlinkage    is   preserved,    while   providing   as   broad   a    range   of\n\nconstituents as the countervailing problems of courthouse proximity\n\nallow.\n\n          E. Other Means to Accommodate the Linkage Interest\n\n     Plaintiffs urge that the linkage interest can be accommodated\n\neven if the existing scheme were found to be illegal.              They offer\n\ntwo alternatives: either a complete overhaul of the existing venue\n\nscheme or the use of unconventional electoral methods that preserve\n\nat-large voting.     The plaintiffs suggest that a scheme of single-\n\nmember districts may preserve linkage, by making each district\n\njudge's area of primary jurisdiction co-extensive with the single-\n\nmember district from which the judge is elected.                   Plaintiffs\n\nprovide no evidence that such a radical reworking of the venue of\n\nTexas courts would be administratively feasible.               The district\n\ncourt likewise simply asserted that such an arrangement of venue\n\n\n                                      102\n\flimited   to   a    single-member     district     could   accommodate       Texas'\n\ninterests,     without   a   glance    at    the   feasibility     of       such   an\n\narrangement.       One look at Harris County cut into a grid of dozens\n\nof venue blocks is enough to show the bizarre nature of this\n\nproposal.\n\n     We cannot conclude that Texas' interests could be adequately\n\naccommodated by such a radical reworking of Texas' venue rules.\n\nThe proposal illustrates how different the judicial offices' at-\n\nlarge election scheme is from legislative and executive at-large\n\nelections.     Plaintiffs must propose not only changing the means by\n\nwhich Texas' district judges are selected, but also its system of\n\nvenue, perhaps of case assignment procedures, and maybe even its\n\njury selection methods.        The necessity for such proposals is a\n\npowerful testament to the reality that linkage is an essential part\n\nof the structure of the judicial office, much more than the method\n\nof electing the office holder.\n\n     The plaintiffs also contend that the linkage interest deserves\n\nlittle weight because it might be accommodated by remedies other\n\nthan subdistricting. In particular, plaintiffs point to the use of\n\nlimited voting or cumulative voting. The Supreme Court, of course,\n\n\"strongly prefer[s] single-member districts for federal court-\n\nordered reapportionment.\"       Growe v.

In any event, we do not agree that this\n\nargument undermines the substantiality of the state's interest.\n\n     The allegedly illegal facet of the existing electoral scheme\n\nis that it employs at-large elections.              Both plaintiffs' amended\n\n\n                                       103\n\fcomplaint   and    plaintiff-intervenors'      complaint-in-intervention\n\nassert that the existing \"at large scheme\" violates § 2, and pray\n\nfor a court order \"that district judges in the targeted counties be\n\nelected in a system which contains single member districts.\"           By\n\nemploying at-large elections, the people of Texas have linked the\n\nelectoral and jurisdictional base of the district judge.\n\n     Limited and cumulative voting are election mechanisms that\n\npreserve at-large elections. Thus, they are not \"remedies\" for the\n\nparticular structural problem that the plaintiffs have chosen to\n\nattack.   At trial, plaintiffs attempted to prove the three Gingles\n\nprerequisites.     This test establishes \"that the minority has the\n\npotential to elect a representative of its own choice in some\n\nsingle-member     district\"   and   \"that   the   challenged   districting\n\nthwarts a distinctive minority by submerging it in a larger white\n\nvoting population.\"     Growe,       U.S. at       , 113 S. Ct. at 1084.\n\nPlaintiffs then tried to supplement that evidence with proof of\n\nZimmer factors, such as past discrimination and anti-single shot\n\nvoting rules.     The question presented by this lawsuit is whether\n\nTexas' at-large election of district judges violates § 2.              To\n\nanswer that question, we must determine the weight of the state's\n\nlinkage interest.     We will not discount that interest based upon\n\npurported remedies that preserve the challenged at-large scheme.\n\nPlaintiffs cannot attack at-large voting as a violation of § 2, and\n\nthen ignore the special characteristics of the judicial office by\n\ninsisting that they will embrace a remedy that preserves that\n\n\n\n\n                                    104\n\fscheme.     To do so would completely shunt consideration of the\n\ninterest to the remedy stage, contrary to Houston Lawyers'.\n\n                  F. Balancing the State's Interest\n\n     In finding that Texas' interest is substantial, we recognize\n\nthat it will not always defeat § 2 liability.          Substantiality is\n\nnot quantifiable, and we translate its force in the practical world\n\nof trials to the burden required to overcome it.            As we see it,\n\nplaintiffs cannot overcome a substantial state interest by proving\n\ninsubstantial    dilution.      We    hold   that   proof   of   dilution,\n\nconsidering the totality of the circumstances, must be substantial\n\nin order to overcome the state's interest in linkage established\n\nhere.    As a matter of law, Texas' interest cannot be overridden by\n\nevidence that sums to a marginal case.       It will take more to create\n\na fact issue for trial.      We must examine the circumstances in each\n\ncounty accordingly.\n\n     We do not now attempt to define in detail what sort of proof\n\nof dilution would be substantial enough to override the state's\n\nlinkage interest.     We do not change the nature or usual means of\n\nproof.    The Gingles prerequisites and Zimmer factors remain.         Two\n\nfacts are especially relevant to assessing the substantiality of\n\nthe plaintiffs' proof of dilution.         One is the willingness of the\n\nracial or ethnic majority--in this case, white voters--to give\n\ntheir votes to minority candidates. The other critical fact is the\n\nability of minority voters to elect candidates of their choice even\n\nwhen opposed by most voters from the majority.          Among the Zimmer\n\nfactors, proof of racial appeals in elections, non-responsiveness\n\n\n                                     105\n\fof elected officials to minority voters, and persistent lack of\n\nelectoral success by minority candidates are most important.\n\n                 VI.   Application of Law to Each County\n\n      We now turn to the application of these principles of law in\n\neach county.     As we have explained, the district court's findings\n\nof dilution are infected by erroneous legal principles.              Findings\n\nthat rest upon erroneous views of the law must be set aside.\n\nPullman-Standard v. Swint, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110698\"><a href=\"/opinion/110698/pullman-standard-v-swint/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 287, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110698\"><a href=\"/opinion/110698/pullman-standard-v-swint/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Remanding for reconsideration is inappropriate where \"the\n\nrecord permits only one resolution of the factual issue.\"              Id. at\n\n292, 102 S. Ct. at 1792.       Here, under controlling law, the evidence\n\nwill not support the findings of liability. Our analysis is common\n\nto all counties but takes us along different routes in different\n\ncounties. In the six counties of Dallas, Tarrant, Travis, Midland,\n\nEctor, and Lubbock, we hold that the district court clearly erred\n\nin finding vote dilution. Even if the district court were correct,\n\nthe   evidence   would   be    outweighed    by   the   State's   substantial\n\ninterest in linkage.          Finally, partisan voting at the least so\n\nweakens the proof of dilution that it loses in the weighing of the\n\ntotality of the circumstances.              Even if we assume that some\n\ndilution may be inferred, in the three remaining counties the\n\nevidence does not outweigh the State's interest in the totality of\n\nthe circumstances.\n\n      One thread runs throughout the plaintiffs' case in all of the\n\ncounties--an insubstantiality of proof that the minority-preferred\n\ncandidate lost \"on account of race.\"          Except in Dallas County, the\n\n\n                                     106\n\fdistrict court's finding of dilution rested on three recitations:\n\n(1) the Gingles prerequisites; (2) an invocation of a general\n\nhistory of discrimination; and (3) the number of minority judges\n\nwas not proportional to the general minority population.               The size\n\nof some counties and the absence of single shot voting were seen as\n\n\"enhancing\" Zimmer factors.              The district court also found two\n\ninstances of racial appeals in Dallas County, one in a judicial\n\nrace won by the minority with white support.\n\n                                 A. Dallas County\n\n     Plaintiffs proceed on behalf of black voters in Dallas County.\n\nThe voting age population of Dallas County is 1,106,757.                Of this\n\nnumber, 180,294 (16.3%) are black.              There are thirty-six different\n\ndistrict courts in Dallas County.              Until 1987, none of the judges\n\nof these districts were black.             In 1987 and 1988, three of the\n\ndistrict judges, or 8.3% of the total, were black.                In 1989, there\n\nwere two black district judges in Dallas County, 5.5% of the total.\n\nToday, five of the thirty-seven36 district judges in Dallas (13.5%)\n\nare black. County court judges are also elected at-large in Dallas\n\nCounty; two of those judges are black. Undisputed expert testimony\n\nand surveys showed that less than 2.0% of the lawyers in Dallas\n\nCounty are both eligible to serve as district judges and black.\n\n     The     evidence      in   Dallas   County    clearly     establishes   that\n\njudicial elections are decided on the basis of partisan voting\n\npatterns.       We   are   left   with    the    inescapable    conclusion   that\n\nplaintiffs have failed to prove that minority-preferred judicial\n\n     36\n          Another district court was added by the legislature.\n\n                                         107\n\fcandidates in this county are consistently defeated by racial bloc\n\nvoting.    This is a failure to meet the threshold showing required\n\nby Gingles.\n\n     Uncontroverted evidence demonstrates that 99% of black Dallas\n\nvoters support the Democratic candidate in every judicial election.\n\nThe evidence also indicates that the majority of white voters\n\nalways voted for the Republican, and thus for candidates other than\n\nthe black-preferred Democratic candidate.               As a result of these\n\nvoting patterns, the black-preferred Democratic candidate always\n\nlost in judicial elections, regardless of the year of the election\n\nin Dallas County.          The Republican Party dominated every analyzed\n\njudicial race.         Defendants understandably contend that the defeat\n\nof black-preferred candidates is the result of party affiliation\n\nrather    than    racial    considerations.       According    to    defendants,\n\nelections are determined by straight-party voting in which voters\n\nsupport    their       party's   ticket    regardless   of   the    race   of   the\n\ncandidates.        The undisputed facts overwhelmingly support this\n\ncontention.        Plaintiffs offer the only answer they have--the\n\nevidence is not legally relevant.\n\n     Drs. Engstrom and Taebel, plaintiffs' and defendants' experts\n\nrespectively, analyzed seven district court general elections with\n\nblack candidates.          The following table summarizes the experts'\n\nanalyses, in particular the amount of support from white voters\n\nreceived by each candidate.          The first figure represents the \"non-\n\nblack vote\" as estimated by plaintiffs' expert.                    The range is\n\ndefined   by     the    homogenous   precinct    and    bi-variate    regression\n\n\n                                          108\n\fanalysis performed by Engstrom. The second figure, in parentheses,\n\nrepresents the white vote as estimated by Taebel.                      Taebel did not\n\nanalyze the 1984 Tinsley-Maloney race.\n\n                                       Table VI.A\n\nYear   Court              Candidates    Race      Party   Non-black (white) vote\n1980   191st District     Winn          B         D       38.6-39.7% (36%)\n                          Howell        W         R\n1984   Crim Dist Ct 2     Baraka        B         R       60.6-61.8% (61%)\n                          Metcalfe      W         D\n \"     Crim Dist Ct 4     Tinsley       B         D       28.7-30%\n                          Maloney       W         R\n \"     301st District     White         B         D       30.6-31.9% (31%)\n                          O'Donnell     W         R\n1986   195th District     Tinsley       B         D       36.6-37.5% (31%)\n                          Kendall       W         R\n \"     256th District     Wright        B         R       70.6-71.7% (77%)\n                          Brin          W         D\n1988   95th District      Oliver        B         D       36.9-37.9% (38%)\n                          Brown         W         R\n\n\nRoughly 61%-77% of white voters consistently supported Republicans,\n\neven when black Republicans ran against white Democrats. Virtually\n\nall black voters supported the Democratic candidate, even when the\n\nDemocratic candidate was white, running against black Republicans.\n\n       Black Republicans won in two of the seven analyzed district\n\ncourt    races.         According      to    Taebel's        study,    one    of   these\n\nRepublicans, Carolyn Wright, did better among white voters than any\n\nother Republican, white or black, winning 77% of the white vote.\n\nOther black Republicans received percentages of the white vote\n\ncomparable to those received by white Republicans.                       Judge Baraka,\n\nthe other black Republican district court candidate, took about 61%\n\nof the white vote against a white Democrat.                   County Judge Brashear,\n\nanother black Republican running at-large against a white Democrat,\n\ntook 66% of the white vote in his successful race for a county\n\ncourt judgeship.\n\n                                            109\n\f     Just as black Republicans did as well or better than white\n\nRepublicans, black Democrats also won as large a percentage of the\n\nwhite vote as white Democratic candidates.      The white vote for\n\nDemocratic candidates ranged between 23% and 39%.      According to\n\nplaintiffs' exhibits, black Democrat Oliver won about 38%--a larger\n\nthan average share of the white vote for a Democrat.   Winn, another\n\nblack Democrat, received almost four out of ten white votes.     By\n\ncomparison, white Democrat Brin received no more than 29% of the\n\nwhite vote when running against Wright, a black Republican.\n\n     Republican candidates lost the black vote and won the white\n\nvote regardless of their public positions on matters related to\n\nrace.    Judge Wright, for instance, had been a member of the Dallas\n\nChapter of the Coalition of 100 Black Women; served as a legal\n\nintern for the Lawyers' Committee on Civil Rights, a project\n\nrelated to civil rights in South Africa; and was a charter member\n\nand past vice-chair of the National Political Congress of Black\n\nWomen.    By contrast, the record is silent regarding the record of\n\nher white Democratic opponent, Brin.     Brin nevertheless won the\n\nblack vote handily in the general election.    At the same time, an\n\noverwhelming number of white voters supported Wright.\n\n     Dr. Champagne, an expert called by defendants, testified that\n\nthis voting pattern was the result of straight-ticket voting.\n\nAccording to Dr. Champagne, judicial elections are low-profile\n\nelections in which the voters know little more about the candidates\n\nthan what they read on the ballot.      The voters, therefore, will\n\nmake their choice based upon the information that the ballot\n\n\n                                 110\n\fcontains--party affiliation.          Because a majority of voters in\n\nDallas County are Republican, Republican candidates prevail in most\n\nof the judicial races.\n\n      We are unable to find the requisite presence of race in this\n\ndata.     The undisputed facts permit no conclusion but that the\n\ndefeat of black-preferred candidates was the result of the voters'\n\npartisan affiliation. The black-preferred candidate was always the\n\nDemocratic candidate, while the majority of white voters always\n\nsupported the Republican candidate. It is significant to the probe\n\nfor racial influences that 30% to 40% of the white electorate\n\nsupported Democratic candidates, although the combination of black\n\nand white Democratic votes was insufficient to carry the Democratic\n\ncandidate.      The point is that a black Democratic voter and a white\n\nDemocratic voter stand in the same position.              Both are unable to\n\nelect the Democratic judicial candidate they prefer.\n\n      We repeat.       The race of the candidate did not affect the\n\npattern. White voters' support for black Republican candidates was\n\nequal to or greater than their support for white Republicans.\n\nLikewise, black and white Democratic candidates received equal\n\npercentages of the white vote.         Given these facts, we cannot see\n\nhow   minority-preferred      judicial      candidates    were   defeated   \"on\n\naccount    of   race   or   color.\"      Rather,   the    minority-preferred\n\ncandidates were consistently defeated because they ran as members\n\nof the weaker of two partisan organizations.             We are not persuaded\n\nthat this is racial bloc voting as required by Gingles.\n\n\n\n\n                                      111\n\f     Plaintiffs contend that the Democratic Party better represents\n\nthe political views of black voters in Dallas County.                   This is\n\ndoubtlessly the view of black voters, but it is not relevant to\n\nwhether the minority-preferred candidate is defeated on account of\n\nrace.   To the extent that candidates preferred by black voters are\n\nconsistently      defeated   because    of   their   substantive      political\n\npositions, they are the casualties of interest group politics, not\n\nracial considerations.        This is not the harm against which § 2\n\nprotects.      Section 2 protects black voters against defeat on\n\naccount of race or color, not on account of political platform.\n\nSee Whitcomb, 403 U.S. at 154-55, 91 S. Ct. at 1874-75.                  We are\n\nsensitive to the reality that political positions can be proxies\n\nfor racial prejudice.        However, where white voters support black\n\ncandidates of a particular party in larger percentage than they\n\nsupport white candidates of the same party, there is no basis,\n\nwithout more, for us to conclude that the parties' political\n\npositions are proxies for racial bias.\n\n     Even assuming arguendo that plaintiffs have met the Gingles\n\nthreshold    by    showing    racial    bloc    voting,   the     totality   of\n\ncircumstances     in   the   record    cannot   support   a   §   2   violation.\n\nPlaintiff-intervenors Oliver, White, and Tinsley contend that \"race\n\nconsiderations pervade elections in Dallas County.\"               They support\n\nthis proposition with the district court's finding that there were\n\ntwo instances of overt or subtle racial appeals in Dallas County\n\nelections.   In one, judicial candidate Baraka was labeled a \"Black\n\nMuslim\" by his opponent.       In another, district attorney candidate\n\n\n                                       112\n\fVance printed his own and his opponent West's pictures in campaign\n\nliterature, thus informing the electorate that he was a white\n\ncandidate    running    against    a    black   opponent.       Nothing      in    the\n\ndistrict court's opinion indicates that these racial appeals were\n\nanything more than isolated incidents.                   In the only judicial\n\nelection affected by a racial appeal, Judge Baraka, the black\n\ncandidate,    won    both    the   Republican      primary     and   the    general\n\nelection, winning a majority of the white vote in both elections.\n\n     Oliver, Tinsley, and White also contended at trial that voting\n\npatterns in nonpartisan elections show that partisan affiliation\n\ncould not explain the defeats of black-preferred candidates.                       Dr.\n\nWeiser, a statistician with experience in voting rights litigation,\n\npresented this data.         Weiser examined seven Dallas City Council\n\nelections, a presidential primary, and referenda on public transit\n\nfunding, a police-review board, and the city council structure.\n\nThe district court made no findings about the data.                        Assuming\n\narguendo that these high-profile elections had any relevance to\n\nvoting   patterns      in   low-profile       judicial    elections,       the    data\n\npresented do not support plaintiffs' argument.                       For example,\n\nalthough    Weiser   emphasized        that   black    city   council   candidate\n\nWilliams drew 27% and 7% of the vote in the most predominantly\n\nblack and white precincts, respectively, the fact remains that his\n\nopponent Rucker won a majority of the black vote and the election.\n\nOther    black-preferred      candidates,       such     as   Strauss   in       1983,\n\nprevailed in three of the other six city council elections Weiser\n\nstudied.     In the 1984 Democratic presidential primary, Jesse\n\n\n                                        113\n\fJackson won a plurality (46%) of the Dallas vote.                Simply put,\n\nthese nonpartisan elections do not demonstrate the consistent\n\ndefeat of minority-preferred candidates.            To the contrary, the\n\nevidence shows that black-preferred candidates won a majority of\n\nthe white vote and the election in most cases.\n\n     Extending our compass to the totality of circumstances fails\n\nto bring evidence that racial politics played any role in the\n\ndefeat of black-preferred candidates.       The district court rejected\n\nthe suggestion    that   the   Republican   Party    is   a    white   slating\n\norganization.    Testimony shows that any eligible candidate could\n\nrun as a Republican, regardless of race. The plaintiff-intervenors\n\ntestified themselves that they had been heavily lobbied by the\n\nRepublican Party leadership to run on the Republican ticket.\n\nRunning as Republicans, the great likelihood is that these former\n\ndistrict judges would have been elected, as plaintiff-intervenors\n\nconceded at trial.\n\n     The plaintiffs presented general evidence of the lingering\n\neffects of past discrimination, but offered no specific evidence of\n\ndepressed levels of black political participation such as low black\n\nvoter registration or turnout.         On the contrary, the minority-\n\npreferred candidates ran professional, well-financed campaigns\n\nbacked by the Democratic Party, a party that, until the late\n\n1970's,   had   dominated   Dallas    County   judicial       races    just   as\n\ncompletely as the Republican Party now dominates those races.\n\nThese Democratic candidates lost because Dallas County shifted from\n\n\n\n\n                                     114\n\fbeing a county of predominantly Democratic straight-ticket voters\n\nto a county of mostly Republican straight-ticket voters.\n\n     Plaintiffs    made   no   factual   riposte   to   the    overwhelming\n\nevidence that election outcomes were the product of partisan\n\naffiliation.    Rather, plaintiffs' answer was the legal assertion\n\nthat the effect of partisan affiliation, virtually admitted, is not\n\nrelevant.    Plaintiffs' expert, Engstrom, conceded that there is \"a\n\nstronger association between partisan affiliation and success than\n\nthere is between the race of the candidate and success,\" while\n\nclinging to the assertion that partisan affiliation does not\n\nexplain all of the voting patterns in Dallas County.            Finally, he\n\nconceded that he had no data that black Democrats generally did\n\nworse than white Democrats.       In fact, the undisputed facts show\n\nthat, when one controls for party, black candidates did as well as,\n\nor better than, white candidates in winning the white voter and\n\nelections.     Plaintiff-intervenor      White   conceded     that    partisan\n\naffiliation determined her electoral defeat in 1984.           She admitted\n\nthat \"if I ran as a Republican . . . the likelihood is that I would\n\nwin.\"\n\n     In short, the facts demonstrate that partisan affiliation, not\n\nrace, was responsible for the defeat of the minority-preferred\n\ncandidate in Dallas County.      The district court erred in finding\n\nracial vote dilution and a violation of § 2.\n\n                           B. Harris County\n\n     Harris County elects 59 district judges at-large.               Three are\n\nblack, three are Hispanic, and the rest are Anglo.                   One black\n\n\n                                   115\n\fcounty court judge also was elected at-large.               Uncontested expert\n\ntestimony and surveys establish that black lawyers make up at most\n\n3.8% of the eligible lawyers, but comprise 5.1% of Harris County's\n\ndistrict judges.      According to plaintiffs' evidence, 1,685,024\n\npeople of voting age reside in Harris County; 305,986 (18.2%) are\n\nblack, and 222,662 (13.2%) are Hispanic.                  Plaintiffs claim to\n\nrepresent all black voters in Harris County.\n\n     The district court found a § 2 violation based on the three\n\nGingles   prerequisites,      two   primary    Zimmer     factors,    and    three\n\n\"enhancing\" Zimmer factors.          The primary Zimmer factors were (1)\n\nthe general history and lingering effects of past discrimination\n\nand (2) the small number of successful black judicial candidates.\n\nThe enhancing Zimmer factors were (1) the large size of Harris\n\nCounty; (2) the prevention of single shot voting by numbered post\n\nelection; and (3) the majority runoff requirement in primary\n\nelections.     Defendants     contend       that,   under    the    proper   legal\n\nstandards, the evidence before the district court amounts at best\n\nto a weak case of dilution that is clearly outweighed by Texas'\n\ninterest in linkage.     We agree.\n\n     Defendants argue that the district court's determination that\n\nHarris    County   district   court    elections     were    characterized      by\n\nlegally significant racial bloc voting rests on two fundamental\n\ndepartures from controlling law.            They maintain that the district\n\ncourt erred in (1) refusing to consider evidence demonstrating that\n\ndivergent    voting   patterns      among   black   and     white   voters    were\n\nattributable to partisan affiliation and (2) excluding elections in\n\n\n                                      116\n\fwhich     the    black-preferred      candidate     was      Hispanic    despite\n\noverwhelming evidence that Harris County black and Hispanic voters\n\nwere a cohesive group within the meaning of § 2. In light of our\n\nprevious discussion, these contentions plainly have merit.37\n\n     Engstrom studied only 17 district court elections involving\n\nblack     candidates.     Taebel     studied   45   Harris    County    judicial\n\nelections between 1980 and 1988 with either a black or Hispanic\n\ncandidate, including 24 district court elections, 9 county court\n\nelections,      one   court   of   appeals   election,    one   Supreme    Court\n\nelection, and ten primary elections.           Taebel examined all but two\n\nof the elections analyzed by Engstrom.              Including the 42 races\n\nlisted in Judge Wood's exhibits, the record before the district\n\ncourt contained a total of 45 general elections that involved\n\n\n\n\n     37\n      The Houston Lawyers' Association maintains that the\ndistrict court properly refused to consider elections in which\nblack and Hispanic voters gave their united support to Hispanic\ncandidates. The Association does not deny that black and Hispanic\nvoters uniformly supported the same candidates in virtually every\nelection analyzed, thus making them a cohesive group under our\nprecedents. Rather, it objects to our examination of these races\non the more general grounds that \"minorities protected by the\nVoting Rights Act are not interchangeable\" and that the success\nof Hispanic candidates \"does not tell us anything about the\nwillingness of white voters to support African American\ncandidates.\" These objections, of course, go directly to the\nrule permitting the aggregation of different racial and ethnic\nminorities itself rather than its application to the facts of\nthis case. We do not understand either the Association or any\nother plaintiffs to challenge the validity of this general rule.\nNevertheless, as we demonstrate below, the weight of Texas'\nlinkage interest precludes the finding of a § 2 violation even if\nthese Hispanic-white elections are excluded.\n\n                                       117\n\fminority candidates.            Forty of these were indigenous district or\n\ncounty court elections.38\n\n       38\n                                    Table VI.B\n       Indigenous judicial elections (Harris County)\n       1.    candidate listed first prevailed\n       2.    bold indicates black-preferred candidate\n       3.    * indicates race Engstrom studied\n       4.

The black-\n\npreferred candidate in Harris County, regardless of race, was\n\nalways     the         Democratic           candidate.        For   white   voters,    party\n\naffiliation always trumped race in predicting which candidates\n\nwould be supported. The Republican candidate always won the white\n\nvote, generally taking between 55% and 65%, whether the Republican\n\ncandidate was black, Hispanic, or Anglo.                            Similarly, Democratic\n\ncandidates always took almost all black and Hispanic votes, even\n\nwhen a white Democrat ran against a black or Hispanic Republican.\n\n      Both the exhibits and expert testimony indicated that party,\n\nnot   race,      was      the     decisive          factor     in   determining    electoral\n\noutcomes. For example, when white Democrat Schuble defeated black\n\nRepublican Proctor in a 1986 district court race, Proctor won the\n\nmajority of the white vote, but lost more than 95% of the black\n\nvote to Schuble.           Likewise, when Irvin, another black Republican,\n\nran for a county court judgeship against white Democrat Duncan,\n\nIrvin won the white vote while Duncan received virtually all of the\n\nblack vote.       Kenneth Hoyt, now a United States District Judge, won\n\nthe white vote and the election in his bid for the state appellate\n\nbench against a white Democratic opponent in 1984.

Engstrom     limited     his    study    to   elections\n\ninvolving black candidates.         Since the black-preferred candidate\n\noften is not black, this precluded Engstrom from determining\n\nwhether whites in Harris County consistently voted as a bloc to\n\ndefeat       black-preferred   candidates,    as    he     admitted      at   trial.\n\nEngstrom also excluded judicial elections with Hispanic candidates\n\nand races for seats on the county court, which are also conducted\n\non a county-wide basis.\n\n       The black-preferred candidate won only two, or 11.8%, of the\n\n17 district court elections analyzed by Engstrom.                   Ten of these\n\nlosses by black Democrats, however, occurred in 1980, 1984, and\n\n1988,    when    popular   Republican    presidential       candidates        helped\n\nRepublican judicial candidates to defeat virtually all of their\n\nDemocratic opponents.          The victors included Judge Hoyt, a black\n\ncandidate running as a Republican. As Engstrom conceded, white and\n\nblack Democrats alike were \"wiped out\" during these years.\n\n       The fortunes of Harris County Democrats, and thus black\n\nvoters,      improved   considerably    in   1982    and    1986,    when     either\n\nGovernor Mark White or Senator Lloyd Bentsen headed the Democratic\n\nticket.        As in the Republican years of 1980, 1984, and 1988,\n\nsuccess at the top of the ballot carried down to judicial races\n\nmarked more by anonymity than name identity. Thus, black-preferred\n\n\n                                       120\n\fcandidates won more than a third of the indigenous judicial races\n\nin which black candidates participated--5 out of 14, or 35.7%.\n\nConsidering elections with Hispanic candidates, black-preferred\n\ncandidates won 13 out of 24 indigenous judicial elections, or\n\n52.4%.   Narrowing the focus to district court races, black voters\n\nelected the candidate of their choice 8 out of 14 times.                   In these\n\nyears, the black-preferred candidate for district judge won in\n\n57.1% of the elections studied.        Even when the results of the lean\n\nyears of 1980, 1984, and 1988 are included, we find that the black-\n\npreferred    candidate   prevailed     in   14   out   of   40     (35%)    of   all\n\nindigenous judicial elections with minority candidates. The record\n\nalso indicates that black-preferred candidates won three out of\n\nfive exogenous races for appellate and Supreme Court seats during\n\nthese years.\n\n     Plaintiffs insist, however, that partisan affiliation cannot\n\nexplain all of the results in this case, for in years not dominated\n\nby the Republican Party, black Democrats enjoyed less success than\n\nother Democrats.     In the 1982 district court contests, white and\n\nHispanic Democrats won 12 of 14 races, while black Democrats won\n\nonly one of three.       In 1986, black Democrats won two of eight\n\nindigenous judicial races; the success rate of white Democrats is\n\nnot found in the record.      Engstrom stated, without discussing the\n\nsupporting data, that between 1980 and 1988, white Democratic\n\ncandidates     enjoyed   a   better    success    rate      than    their    black\n\ncounterparts.\n\n\n\n\n                                      121\n\f     This evidence may reflect a preference among white Democrats\n\nfor white and Hispanic rather than black candidates.           Plaintiffs'\n\nassertion that race is at work, however, is contradicted by the\n\nsuccess of black candidates in the Democratic primary, where party\n\naffiliation plays no part.        An exhibit introduced by Houston\n\nLawyers' Association shows that black candidates won 9 of 16, or\n\n56.3%, of the contested primary races.       This showing detracts from\n\nthe force of plaintiffs' claim.\n\n     The proof of vote dilution is marginal. The undisputed facts\n\nshow that a majority of white voters invariably supported black\n\nRepublican candidates, suggesting that the defeat of minority-\n\npreferred   candidates   was     largely,     although   not       entirely,\n\nattributable to partisan affiliation.       Moreover, black voters were\n\nconsistently able to elect representatives of their choice, even\n\nwhen they were opposed by a majority of white voters.             The record\n\nindicates that black-preferred candidates prevailed in 14 out of 40\n\nnon-exogenous   elections   in   which      either   black   or    Hispanic\n\ncandidates participated--35% of the time.       Limiting the inquiry to\n\ndistrict court races, black-preferred candidates still won in 9 of\n\n28 races, or 32.1%.\n\n     Black voters could, therefore, repeatedly elect candidates of\n\ntheir choice, even when opposed by a majority of white voters.           Far\n\nfrom being submerged in a white majority, black voters were a\n\npotent electoral force that could form coalitions with minorities\n\nof white voters to elect their preferred candidates.         This ability\n\nto form coalitions and influence the elections of all judges in\n\n\n                                  122\n\fHarris   County     would    be    lost   in     the   system      of   single-member\n\ndistricts proposed by the plaintiffs.              Instead, black voters might\n\ncontrol the election of perhaps ten judges, abdicate any right to\n\nvote for the remaining forty-nine, and thus radically reduce the\n\nchances of having disputes affecting them decided by a judge they\n\nhad any hand in electing.          A similar observation can be made in the\n\nother    counties     but    is    strikingly      apt     in   this     large   urban\n\nenvironment.\n\n     The remaining evidence adds little to plaintiffs' claims of\n\nillegal vote dilution.            Plaintiffs offered little evidence that\n\npast discrimination and socioeconomic disparities between blacks\n\nand whites hindered the ability of black residents of Harris County\n\nto participate in the political process.                 In particular, there was\n\nno suggestion at trial of a lower-than-average voter registration\n\nor turnout rate among black citizens.                  In addition, the evidence\n\nindicated that disproportionate levels of poverty within the black\n\ncommunity had no effect on the ability of black judicial candidates\n\nto raise the funds necessary to compete on a county-wide basis.                    At\n\ntrial, Bonnie Fitch testified, without elaboration, that a few\n\nblack incumbents experienced some difficulty in obtaining financing\n\nfor their campaigns, but she attributed these problems to \"racial\n\ndiscrimination\" and the candidates' \"past record of losing.\" Even\n\nif this isolated, equivocal testimony could somehow be construed to\n\nsuggest that a lack of resources among black residents hindered\n\nblack candidates' campaigns, it was sharply contradicted by the\n\naccounts    related     by    Jackson      and    Berry,     two    black    judicial\n\n\n                                          123\n\fcandidates. They testified that they were each able to raise\n\nsufficient   funds   and    that    they       in    fact    outspent     their   white\n\nRepublican opponents by ratios exceeding ten-to-one. In light of\n\nthis evidence, the district court's finding that the effects of\n\npast discrimination hampered the black community's access to the\n\npolitical process was clearly erroneous.\n\n     Likewise, the representation of blacks on the Harris County\n\nbench cannot support an inference of racial politics. Three blacks\n\nare district     judges--5.1%       of   the        total.     By   contrast,     black\n\nattorneys make up at most only 3.8% of the eligible lawyers in\n\nHarris   County.     The     fact    that      blacks        constitute    a   smaller\n\npercentage of the district judges than of the county population is\n\ntherefore not surprising. If judges were chosen at random from the\n\npool of eligible candidates, there would be fewer black district\n\njudges on the Harris County bench.\n\n     Aside from the number of black judges and the general history\n\nof discrimination, the district court found three Zimmer enhancing\n\nfactors.

Tex. 1983) (three-judge panel),\n\nand therefore do not support an inference of racial politics in\n\nHarris County.\n\n     The   circumstantial     evidence         of     a   relation   between      black\n\nvoters' electoral losses and race is, at best, tenuous, given the\n\n\n                                         124\n\fwillingness of white voters to support black Republican candidates\n\nand the consistent success enjoyed by black-preferred judicial\n\ncandidates. Even if the considerable success among black-preferred\n\nHispanic candidates is discounted, the evidence presented at trial\n\nhardly sums to the level of dilution that might outweigh Texas'\n\nsubstantial interest in linking a trial judge's jurisdiction with\n\nher electoral base.   Given the undisputed evidence that nearly all\n\nof the losses suffered by black candidates occurred in years when\n\nvirtually   the   entire   party   slate   went   down   in   defeat   and\n\nplaintiffs' negligible showing under the Zimmer factors, the claim\n\nbefore us reduces itself to a contention that Texas' 143-year-old\n\nelectoral scheme must be dismantled in Harris County because a few\n\nblack candidates--most of them recently-appointed incumbents--\n\nfailed to attract decisive support from white voters within the\n\nDemocratic Party. We express no opinion as to whether this minimal\n\nproof of dilution might establish a violation of § 2 absent the\n\nsubstantial state interest.        Even assuming that it would, we\n\nconclude as a matter of law that plaintiffs' proof at best produces\n\nonly a marginal case in Harris County, too insubstantial to survive\n\nthe weighing of the totality of the circumstances particularly so\n\nif any appreciable weight is given the linkage interest.\n\n                           C. Tarrant County\n\n     There are 23 district courts in Tarrant County.          From 1985 to\n\n1988, three of these judges (13.0%) were black.          As of 1989, two\n\ndistrict judges are black (8.7%).          The defendants' undisputed\n\nevidence indicates that only 2.4% of the eligible Tarrant County\n\n\n                                   125\n\flawyers are black.       There are 613,698 residents of voting age in\n\nTarrant   County.       Of   this    number,     63,851    (10.4%)   are   black.\n\nPlaintiffs proceed on behalf of black voters in Tarrant County.\n\n      The evidence indicates that blacks voted cohesively for the\n\nDemocratic candidate.        Dr. Brischetto, plaintiffs' expert for this\n\ncounty, analyzed four elections:               three general elections for\n\ndistrict judgeships and the 1988 Democratic presidential primary.\n\nIn all four elections, the regression estimates show that from 85%\n\nto 100% of black voters in Tarrant County supported the black-\n\npreferred, Democratic candidate. Taebel's analysis similarly shows\n\ncohesion.\n\n      Taebel    analyzed     nine    general     elections,    including    three\n\nexogenous elections, in which a black or Hispanic had participated.\n\nThese included five district court races, one county court race,\n\ntwo Supreme Court races, and a contest for Texas Attorney General.\n\nBrischetto analyzed only four elections, in which black candidates\n\nhad participated.       As in all other counties, the evidence shows\n\nconsistent black support for Democratic candidates.              The following\n\ntables summarize the analyzed races involving black or Hispanic\n\ncandidates.      For each black-preferred candidate, the estimated\n\npercentage of the white vote is listed.                   These are based upon\n\nTaebel's estimates, except those in parentheses, which reflect\n\nBrischetto's     regression    and    homogenous     precinct    analyses.

In those general elections with\nblack candidates, the black-preferred, Democratic candidate won\n\nonly one out of three general elections--33.3% of the studied\n\nraces.     However, in nine general elections with either black or\n\nHispanic candidates included in Taebel's study, the black-preferred\n\ncandidate won four out of nine, or 44.4% of the elections.                     In the\n\nsix indigenous district and county court elections studied, the\n\nblack-preferred candidate won three out of six, or 50% of the\n\n\n                                        127\n\felections.   These figures do not indicate the consistent defeat of\n\nblack-preferred candidates.\n\n     The   district   court,   by   contrast,   found   that   the   black-\n\npreferred candidate was consistently defeated in Tarrant County.\n\nThe district court reached this conclusion by ignoring elections in\n\nwhich Hispanics had participated. This rejection of white-Hispanic\n\nelections was erroneous.       The undisputed facts, as reflected by\n\nTaebel's exhibits, are that a majority of Hispanic voters always\n\nsupported the same candidate favored by black voters in every\n\ngeneral election. The district court found that Hispanic and black\n\nvoters were cohesive in Midland, Lubbock, and Ector Counties on\n\nsimilar evidence.      With virtually identical proof in Tarrant\n\nCounty, the same conclusion must follow, and we hold that it does.\n\n     Brischetto included the 1988 Democratic presidential primary\n\nin which Jesse Jackson won virtually all of the black vote in\n\nTarrant County, but only between 14% and 16% of the white vote.39\n\nDefendants exhibits include a 1986 Democratic primary for district\n\ncourt in which Ross, the black-preferred candidate, received 57% of\n\nthe black vote, but lost the white vote and thus came in third out\n\nof a field of four candidates.       Those exhibits show, however, two\n\nother Democratic primaries--ignored by Brischetto--in which black-\n\npreferred Hispanic candidates prevailed.40\n\n     39\n      We note that there were five other viable Democratic\ncandidates (Dukakis, Gore, Gephardt, Hart, and Simon) in the 1988\nprimary, so that Jackson could expect to receive only 16.7% of\nthe white vote if that vote were randomly distributed.\n     40\n      Taebel's exhibits also include a 1982 county court primary\nthat the black-preferred candidate, Hicks, seemed to win by seven\n\n                                    128\n\f     In   short,    the   evidence    shows   that    the   black-preferred\n\ncandidate won 40% of the Democratic primaries and half of the\n\nindigenous judicial elections studied, including the elections with\n\nHispanic candidates.      The record also shows that black judges have\n\nconsistently made up a greater proportion of district judges in\n\nTarrant County (13.0%) than the proportion of black voters in the\n\ncounty's population (10.4%), and far more than the proportion of\n\neligible black attorneys (2.4%).\n\n     Furthermore,     the   undisputed     evidence    shows   that   black\n\ncandidates won as great a share of white votes as white candidates,\n\nif we control for party affiliation. For instance, Sturns, a black\n\nRepublican with a long history of involvement in civil rights and\n\nblack community organizations, won 57% of the white vote to beat a\n\nwhite Democrat.      Salvant, another black Republican, also won a\n\nmajority (55%) of the white vote, although he lost his race for a\n\ndistrict judgeship to a white Democrat supported by a combination\n\nof black voters, Hispanic voters, and white Democrats.                Black\n\nRepublicans also won the same share (50%) of elections as white\n\nRepublicans among the races with black or Hispanic candidates.\n\n     Finally, blacks have not been underrepresented on the Tarrant\n\nCounty bench.   Plaintiffs' exhibit indicates that, for four out of\n\nthe five years studied, three of Tarrant County's district judges\n\nwere black; for these four years, while blacks made up only 10.4%\n\nof the county's voting age population, more than 13% of the\n\n\n\nvotes. This tabulation, however, was based upon elections\nreturns prior to a recount under which Hicks apparently lost.\n\n                                     129\n\frelevant office holders were black.            Given this persistent and\n\nsubstantial   black   presence   on    the   Tarrant    County    bench,     the\n\nconsistent    and     substantial     success     of     minority-preferred\n\ncandidates, and the absence of any evidence of racial politics in\n\nTarrant County, we conclude that, even if the plaintiffs had proven\n\nthe Gingles prerequisites, the district court clearly erred in\n\nfinding illegal vote dilution under the totality of circumstances.\n\nThis is so even if we ignore the fact that blacks and Hispanics\n\nvoted cohesively in Tarrant County and exclude the races with\n\nHispanic candidates     from   our    analysis.       Looking    at   just    the\n\ndistrict court general elections involving black candidates, the\n\nblack-preferred candidate won 33.3% of the time.           In light of the\n\nevidence just discussed, which excluding Hispanic elections does\n\nnot change, reducing the relevant success rate from 44.4% to 33.3%\n\nis insignificant in the totality of the circumstances. There is no\n\ncase as a matter of law in Tarrant County.\n\n                           D. Travis County\n\n     There are 13 district judges elected in Travis County.                  From\n\n1985 to 1988, one of them was Hispanic, or 7.7% of the total.                This\n\njudge was defeated in 1988.      Hispanic lawyers make up 2.7% of the\n\neligible lawyers in the county.            There are 312,392 voting age\n\nresidents in Travis County, which encompasses Austin, Texas.                  Of\n\nthem, 44,847 (14.4%) have Spanish surnames. Only 29,067 (9.3%) are\n\nblack.   The district court found that a \"minimally contiguous,\"\n\npredominantly-Hispanic     judicial        district    could     be   created.\n\nPlaintiffs proceed on behalf of Hispanic voters in Travis County.\n\n\n                                     130\n\f     Plaintiffs' witnesses stated that the Republican Party is\n\ninsignificant in Travis County and the proper testing ground for\n\ncandidates is the Democratic primary.      Plaintiffs analyzed three\n\nDemocratic primary elections:   one for district court and two for\n\ncounty court positions.    Defendants analyzed eleven elections:\n\nfour exogenous general elections, including one state senate, one\n\nAttorney General, and two Supreme Court races; four exogenous\n\nprimary elections, including one state senate, one Supreme Court,\n\nand two appellate court primaries; and finally the same three\n\nindigenous judicial elections studied by plaintiffs.\n\n     By Taebel's analysis, the Hispanic-preferred candidate won all\n\nfour of the exogenous general elections.    In three of the four, the\n\nHispanic-preferred candidate also won a majority of the Anglo vote.\n\nIn addition, the Hispanic-preferred candidate won two exogenous\n\nprimaries, for Supreme Court and state senate. Thus, the Hispanic-\n\npreferred candidate prevailed in two of the four (50%) exogenous\n\nprimaries and two of the seven (28.6%) primaries studied overall.\n\nAltogether, the Hispanic-preferred candidate won 54.5% of the\n\nindigenous and exogenous elections analyzed.\n\n     The district court found, however, that the three indigenous\n\nprimary elections for judicial positions were \"closer in nature to\n\nDistrict Court elections\" and sufficed to show a pattern of racial\n\nbloc voting sufficient to defeat the Hispanic-preferred candidate.\n\nThe district court therefore relied solely on the three elections\n\nanalyzed by both Taebel and Brischetto to find that the Hispanic-\n\npreferred candidate lost 100% of the time.\n\n\n                                131\n\f       In   the   one     district   court     and   two    county    court     primary\n\nelections analyzed by the parties, the Hispanic, and Hispanic-\n\npreferred, candidate was defeated by a white majority.                        In one of\n\nthese races, however, white voters gave their support to a black\n\ncandidate, and thereby defeated both the Hispanic Castro and\n\nHughes, a white candidate.            Kennedy, the black candidate, had the\n\noverwhelming support of black as well as white voters, so it is\n\ndifficult to conclude that Castro was defeated by a white bloc.\n\nCastro and Hughes were defeated by a black-white coalition.                       Thus,\n\nCastro's defeat is not evidence of the white majority's ability\n\n\"usually to defeat the minority's preferred candidate.\"                        Gingles,\n\n478 U.S. at 51, 106 S. Ct. at 2766-67.\n\n       The two remaining indigenous primary elections offer a meager\n\nbase for liability.         The plaintiffs' case reduces to three facts:\n\n(1) Hispanic-preferred candidates Gallardo and Garcia gained only\n\n33% to 37% of the Anglo vote in 1988 Democratic primaries, and\n\nfailed to win nominations for district and county court elections;\n\n(2) only one Hispanic, Gallardo, served as district judge between\n\n1985 and 1998, while no Hispanic now serves; and (3) Hispanics have\n\nsuffered from past discrimination in Travis County.                      We conclude\n\nthat the district court clearly erred to find illegal vote dilution\n\non this record.\n\n       In finding clear error, we repeat Justice Brennan's admonition\n\nthat    \"the      usual    predictability       of    the        majority's     success\n\ndistinguishes       structural       dilution    from      the    mere   loss    of   an\n\noccasional election.\"         Gingles, 478 U.S. at 51, 106 S. Ct. at 2767.\n\n\n                                         132\n\fIt defies common sense to believe that the loss of two primary\n\nraces in one year constitutes usual and predictable defeat by a\n\nwhite bloc, rather than simply \"loss of an occasional election.\"\n\nHowever, assuming arguendo that these two elections constitute\n\nsufficient proof of the third Gingles prerequisite, they are too\n\nmeager to prove dilution under the totality of circumstances, as a\n\nmatter of law.\n\n     The plaintiffs contend that Hispanics are underrepresented\n\namong district judges in Travis County.       Hispanics made up 7.7% of\n\nthose judges in four out of five recent years, while making up no\n\nmore than 2.7% of the lawyers eligible under Texas law to fill\n\nthose posts.      Given such a small pool of qualified candidates, it\n\nis not surprising that Hispanics have made up a small proportion of\n\nthe Travis County bench.     This result need not be attributed to the\n\ninteraction of racial bias with the at-large electoral scheme.           It\n\nis equally likely that the numbers reflect the limited candidate\n\npool.   Plaintiffs can point to only one district court election\n\nthat an Hispanic candidate lost--Gallardo's race in 1988.            Even if\n\nGallardo had prevailed, the percentage of Hispanic judges would not\n\nhave increased, because Gallardo was the one Hispanic sitting\n\nbefore 1988.   While we do not require that any minority candidates\n\nrun for the office in question, the court cannot ignore this\n\nreality while plaintiffs emphasize the absence of minority office\n\nholders.\n\n     Far   from    signalling   the    submergence   of   minority   voting\n\nstrength by an interaction of electoral process and bias, the\n\n\n                                      133\n\fundisputed facts indicate that Travis County's political system is\n\nopen to Hispanic and white candidates alike. Hispanics won half of\n\nthe four exogenous primary elections studied, including races for\n\nthe state    senate,   appellate     courts,    and    Supreme   Court.     The\n\nHispanic-preferred candidate also won all four of the general\n\nelections analyzed by the defendants.          The City of Austin contains\n\nmost of Travis County's population.

[T]he\n     winning minority candidates frequently received well over\n     fifty percent (50%) of the Anglo vote and were also the\n     preferred candidates of the minorities.          Minority\n     candidates have routinely been elected to other posts in\n     Austin and the surrounding Travis County.\n\nLikewise, the defendants here produced evidence that Hispanic\n\ncounty commissioners had been elected from predominantly Anglo\n\ndistricts and won Anglo districts, and that Trevino, a Hispanic\n\nAustin   city   council    member,    had   been      elected    in    city-wide\n\nelections.   Against this background, which includes the success of\n\nstate Senator Barrientos and Justice Gonzalez and other Hispanic-\n\npreferred    candidates,    plaintiffs'        minimal    case    is     plainly\n\ninsufficient to prove illegal vote dilution.

Bexar County\n\n      The voting age population of Bexar County is 672,220.                         Of\n\nthese, 46,767 (7.0%) are black, and 278,577 (41.4%) are Hispanic.\n\nNineteen district judges are elected from Bexar County.                      Of this\n\nnumber, five (26.3%) are Hispanic.              Undisputed evidence shows that\n\n11.4% of     the    eligible    lawyers    in       Bexar    County   are   Hispanic.\n\nPlaintiffs proceed on behalf of Hispanic voters in Bexar County.\n\n      Plaintiffs and defendants analyzed the six district court\n\ngeneral elections with Hispanic candidates between 1982 and 1988.\n\nDefendants also studied a 1980 general election with an Hispanic\n\ncandidate, as well as two appellate court and three county court\n\ngeneral elections with either Hispanic or black candidates.                       As in\n\nevery other county, Hispanics voted cohesively for the Democratic\n\ncandidate while a majority of Anglos supported the Republican\n\ncandidate.\n\n      In    the    twelve    judicial   elections          studied,   the   Hispanic-\n\npreferred     Democratic      candidate    won       four    times,    33.3%.      The\n\nRepublican candidate usually won the general election, and always\n\nwon   the   Anglo    vote,    regardless       of    the    candidate.      The   four\n\nDemocratic victories were:              (1) the 1980 appellate court race\n\nbetween Murry and Esquivel; (2) the 1980 district court race\n\nbetween Prado and Priest; (3) the 1988 district court race between\n\nBowles and Mireles; and (4) the 1988 county court race between\n\nPatterson and Canales.         Priest, an Anglo Democrat, beat Prado, an\n\nHispanic Republican, while Esquivel, Mireles, and Canales, all\n\nHispanic Democrats, defeated their Anglo Republican opponents.\n\n\n                                         135\n\f     Partisan affiliation does not explain, however, the voting\n\npatterns in Democratic primary elections.                    By defendants' own\n\nevidence of Democratic primaries in Bexar County, the Hispanic-\n\npreferred candidate lost in nine of fourteen elections, prevailing\n\nonly 35.7% of the time, when Anglo Democrats voted for the Hispanic\n\ncandidate's    Anglo   opponent.        Anglo    support      for    the    Hispanic\n\ncandidate was seldom above 30% and as low as 1%--whereas the\n\nHispanic vote for the Hispanic-preferred, and always Hispanic,\n\ncandidate   was   above    70%    for    five    of   the     nine   unsuccessful\n\ncandidates.    Plaintiffs' as well as defendants' experts agreed,\n\nhowever, that primary elections do not provide a reliable guide\n\nwhere, as here, both parties are competitive, since they involve\n\nonly a fraction of the electorate.\n\n     Partisan affiliation accounts for much of the voting patterns\n\nanalyzed by the parties.         Most Anglo voters are Republicans; most\n\nHispanic voters are Democrats.            Anglo voters gave a majority of\n\ntheir votes to Republicans, and Hispanic voters gave a majority of\n\ntheir votes to Democrats, even when Hispanic Republican candidates\n\nfaced Anglo Democratic opponents.               Prado and Barrera, Hispanic\n\nRepublicans, won 70% and 86% of the Anglo vote respectively, when\n\nrunning   against   Anglo   Democratic         opponents      who    received     the\n\noverwhelming majority of the Hispanic vote.             Any proof of dilution\n\nis meager at best and cannot overcome Texas' substantial linkage\n\ninterest as a matter of law.\n\n     Because    Hispanic    voters      make    up    more    than    41%    of   the\n\npopulation, they can elect Democratic candidate with minimal Anglo\n\n\n                                        136\n\fsupport and have done so repeatedly.                      The minority-preferred\n\ncandidate won four out of twelve elections in which an Hispanic\n\ncandidate participated--33.3% of the time--with as little as 17% of\n\nthe Anglo vote.        Hispanic voters are plainly a potent political\n\nforce that can elect candidates by forming coalitions with small\n\npercentages of Anglo voters.            If Bexar County were subdistricted,\n\nHispanic    voters     might    elect    a     few   more   of    their   preferred\n\ncandidates, but only at the expense of losing their influence over\n\nthe majority of Bexar County judges.                 The perversity of such a\n\nresult is self-evident.\n\n     Finally, the evidence that elections were affected by racial\n\npolitics preventing the formation of such coalitions is thin.                    It\n\nconsisted    solely      of    (1)   evidence        of     low   Hispanic   voter\n\nregistration; (2) the usual enhancing factors present in every\n\nTexas county--anti-single shot voting and the majority runoff\n\nrequirement; and (3) the fact that Hispanic judges occupy five of\n\nnineteen district judgeships--26.3% of the total--while Hispanics\n\nmake up 41.4% of Bexar County's voting age population.                    Again, we\n\nnote that Hispanic attorneys make up only 11.4% of the eligible\n\nbar, so that the representation of lawyers on the bench is actually\n\nhigher than would be produced by random selection from the pool of\n\neligible candidates.           This evidence, even if probative in the\n\nabstract, is as meager as the evidence in Harris County.\n\n     The evidence compels the conclusion that any dilution was\n\nmarginal and cannot as a matter of law survive the weighing of the\n\ntotality    of   the   circumstances         when    Texas'   substantial     state\n\n\n                                         137\n\finterest is added to the mix.        If Texas' linkage interest does not\n\noutweigh this evidence of dilution, the state's interest would be\n\na nullity.    We hold that plaintiffs' proof fails in Bexar County as\n\na matter of law.\n\n                           F. Jefferson County\n\n     Eight district judges are elected from Jefferson County.            The\n\nrecord shows that no black judge was elected there between 1985 and\n\n1989.41      Expert    evidence    establishes     that   fourteen   eligible\n\nattorneys in Jefferson County, 3.1% of the qualified bar, are\n\nblack.    The voting age population of Jefferson County is 179,708.\n\nOf this number, 44,283 (24.6%) are black.            Plaintiffs proceed on\n\nbehalf of black voters in Jefferson County.\n\n     Taebel testified that Jefferson County is the most Democratic\n\nof the targeted counties, with 90% of its voters participating in\n\nthe Democratic primary.           Brischetto analyzed eight primary and\n\nrunoff    elections,    including    the    1988   Democratic   presidential\n\nprimary.   Taebel analyzed six exogenous elections involving either\n\nblack or Hispanic candidates:           four primaries and two general\n\nelections.     Unlike their other studies, Brischetto and Taebel\n\nanalyzed totally different elections.\n\n     In all but one of the primary elections studied by Brischetto,\n\nthe black vote was cohesive.         In one case, the candidate with the\n\n     41\n      Since trial, district judges in Jefferson County have\nfiled an amicus brief requesting judicial notice that Davis, an\nAfrican-American, was elected to the county court in 1990. The\namicus brief also notes that black Democrat Overstreet and\nHispanic Democrat Morales won a majority of the county's votes in\ntheir respective 1990 races for Court of Criminal Appeals and\nAttorney General.\n\n                                      138\n\fgreatest black support received a high plurality (47%) of the black\n\nvote.       A majority of white voters always opposed the black-\n\npreferred candidate in the primary elections.\n\n      Whether       the    black-preferred     candidate      was   consistently\n\ndefeated by a white bloc is a close question.                 The answer varies\n\nwith the elections counted and how they are counted.                    Defendants\n\npoint to four primaries.           In two elections, black candidate Price\n\nwon the nomination for state representative.                 In two others, for\n\nSupreme     Court    and   Court    of   Criminal    Appeals,   black-preferred\n\nHispanic candidates Gonzalez and Martinez participated.                  Gonzalez\n\nwon   the    Jefferson     County    Democratic      vote;   Martinez    did   not.\n\nDefendants also rely on two exogenous general elections, for\n\nSupreme Court and Attorney General, involving Hispanic candidates\n\nGonzalez, a Democrat, and Barrera, a Republican.                In both general\n\nelections, the black-preferred candidate--Gonzalez and Mattox,\n\nBarrera's Democratic opponent--prevailed.\n\n      Plaintiffs offer five indigenous primaries, ranging back to\n\n1972, in which black candidates participated--four for justice of\n\nthe peace and one for county court.                  They also submitted the\n\nexogenous 1988 presidential primary.                Among these six races, the\n\nblack-preferred candidate prevailed only once, when Jackson won a\n\nplurality in the 1988 presidential primary.\n\n      The total of eight elections analyzed by Brischetto includes\n\nboth the initial primaries and subsequent runoffs for justice of\n\nthe peace in 1972 and 1974.              In the initial primaries, black-\n\npreferred candidate Freeman failed to win the highest plurality.\n\n\n                                         139\n\fPlaintiffs would count these results as \"defeats\" separate from\n\nFreeman's subsequent defeat in the runoffs.            Freeman won, however,\n\nthe second highest number of votes in the initial primaries and\n\nthus made those runoffs.        We do not consider Freeman's showings in\n\nthe initial primaries to be separate from the runoff elections.\n\nThus, the record reflects four justice of the peace elections, not\n\nsix.\n\n       Unlike Tarrant County, defendants' evidence does not include\n\nestimates of how Hispanic residents in Jefferson County voted.\n\nThere are no facts showing that Hispanic and black voters were\n\npolitically cohesive in Jefferson County. Anglo-Hispanic elections\n\nare entitled to less weight than white-black races in determining\n\nthe success of black-preferred candidates.\n\n       Nonetheless,       confining   our    consideration    to   the   analyzed\n\nelections in which black candidates participated, we must conclude\n\nthat the plaintiffs failed to prove a substantial case of dilution.\n\nThe plaintiffs and defendants together produced evidence of eight\n\nprimary elections in which a black who was also the black-preferred\n\ncandidate participated.         The black-preferred candidate won three\n\nprimaries out of these eight elections--a success rate of 37.5%.\n\nAll    three   of   the    black-preferred      candidates'    victories    were\n\nexogenous:     Jackson won the 1988 presidential primary, while Price\n\nwon two Democratic primaries for state representative.\n\n       As in every county but Dallas, the district court found no\n\nsign of racial appeals.          Likewise, there is no finding of non-\n\nresponsiveness on the part of elected officials to the concerns of\n\n\n                                       140\n\fblack   constituents.          Enhancing      factors     as   well      as     past\n\ndiscrimination were shown, but--as elsewhere--were not brought home\n\nto this case.     The minority-preferred candidate prevailed in every\n\ngeneral election submitted by the parties.\n\n     The plaintiffs' case was further weakened by their use of\n\ndated statistics:         three of the five indigenous elections they\n\nsubmitted were held in 1972, 1974, and 1978.            There is no evidence\n\nof a practical and searching appraisal of contemporary conditions\n\nin Jefferson County.       See Nipper v. Chiles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2596481\"><a href=\"/opinion/2596481/nipper-v-chiles/\"><span class=\"volume\">795</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The evidence is inadequate to prove that black voters\n\nwere denied an equal opportunity to participate in the political\n\nprocess.    It is too insubstantial to survive a weighing of the\n\ntotality of circumstances when the state's substantial linkage\n\ninterest is added to the mix.          As a matter of law, the state's\n\ninterest outweighs this case.\n\n                              G. Midland County\n\n     Midland County contains 82,636 voting age residents, of whom\n\n6,893 (11.9%) have Spanish surnames and 4,484 (7.8%) are black.\n\nThere are      three    district   judges    in   Midland   County;      none    are\n\nHispanic or black.       Undisputed evidence shows that seven Hispanic\n\nand three black attorneys are eligible for district judgeships.\n\nThey comprise 3.2% of the lawyers eligible to run for that office.\n\n\n\n\n                                      141\n\fPlaintiffs proceed on behalf of both Hispanic and black voters in\n\nMidland County.\n\n     Plaintiffs analyzed three general elections in Midland County.\n\nTwo of them were exogenous races for the Texas Supreme Court.              The\n\nthird was an indigenous race involving a black candidate for a\n\nJustice of   the   Peace   position    in   1986.        Defendants   likewise\n\nexamined Gonzalez's bids for the Supreme Court in 1986 and 1988, as\n\nwell as four primary elections in which either a black or Hispanic\n\ncandidate participated.       Defendants also analyzed the Mattox-\n\nBarrera race for Texas Attorney General.\n\n     Both parties' analyses show that the majority of Anglo voters\n\nalways   opposed   the   candidate    preferred     by   the   geographically\n\ncompact and cohesive combined minority population in the general\n\nelections. The minority-preferred candidate was always defeated by\n\nthis Anglo majority.\n\n     We conclude that the district court clearly erred in finding\n\ndilution. The undisputed facts indicate that partisan affiliation,\n\nnot race, caused the defeat of the minority-preferred candidate.\n\nThe majority of minority voters always cast their votes in favor of\n\nthe Democratic candidate.      The Anglo voters cast the majority of\n\ntheir votes for the Republican, regardless of the race of the\n\ncandidates. Indeed, Barrera, the Hispanic Republican candidate for\n\nAttorney General, won 76% of the Anglo vote when running against\n\nMattox, a white Democrat--the second highest vote received by any\n\nof the Republicans in the analyzed general elections.                  Because\n\nRepublican voters outnumbered Democratic voters, the minority-\n\n\n                                     142\n\fpreferred Democratic candidate consistently lost.                  The plaintiffs\n\nhave not established the third prerequisite of Gingles.\n\n     Even if plaintiffs could meet the Gingles threshold, the\n\ntotality of circumstances does not add up to dilution.                          The\n\nplaintiffs can show only a general history of discrimination and a\n\nlack of minority judges.           These facts prove little.           In Midland\n\nCounty, only one minority lawyer has run for local office (county\n\nattorney), and none has ever run for a district judgeship.                    These\n\nlow numbers reflect the minuscule number of eligible minority\n\ncandidates.     According to the evidence, only ten minority lawyers\n\nare eligible to run for the district court seat.\n\n     Because the undisputed facts show that partisan affiliation\n\nuninfected     by     racial     politics        caused   the   minority-preferred\n\ncandidates' defeat, we hold that the district court erred in\n\nfinding dilution.\n\n                                 H. Lubbock County\n\n     Lubbock        County     residents     vote     for   five   district   court\n\npositions.     None of these five judges are black or Hispanic.                The\n\nsurveys introduced by the defendants indicate that 23 Hispanic\n\nlawyers in Lubbock County are eligible to run for the district\n\ncourt.   The surveys show that no black residing in the county is\n\neligible to do so.       The total voting age population is 150,714.             Of\n\nthis number, 22,934 (15.2%) have Spanish surnames and 9,509 (6.4%)\n\nare black.     Plaintiffs proceed on behalf of the combined Hispanic\n\nand black voters in Lubbock County.\n\n\n\n\n                                           143\n\f      None of the parties analyzed indigenous elections in Lubbock\n\nCounty; no minority has ever run for a position on the district\n\ncourt.       Plaintiffs   analyzed        two   exogenous   primaries     and    two\n\nexogenous general elections, for the Supreme Court and for the\n\nCourt of Criminal Appeals. Defendants studied the same two general\n\nelections,     adding   an    exogenous     general     election    for   Attorney\n\nGeneral.\n\n      Plaintiffs' and defendants' evidence shows that blacks and\n\nHispanics tend to vote cohesively.              There is also no dispute that\n\nthe majority of Anglo voters did not support the candidate favored\n\nby the minority voters in Lubbock County in any of the elections\n\nstudied.\n\n      As in Dallas and Midland Counties, however, the undisputed\n\nfacts show that, in general elections, partisan affiliation and not\n\nracial politics caused the consistent defeat of the minority-\n\npreferred, always Democratic, candidates.               The data indicate that,\n\nin   these    counties,      over   60%    of   white   voters     supported    the\n\nRepublican candidate, while most minority voters supported the\n\nDemocratic candidate.          As a result of this voting pattern, the\n\nDemocratic and minority-preferred candidate consistently lost to a\n\nRepublican opponent, regardless of the ethnicity of the candidates.\n\n      In the 1986 and 1988 races for the Supreme Court, Hispanic\n\nDemocrat Gonzalez lost Lubbock County's vote to white Republican\n\nopponents.     However, in the contest for Attorney General, Barrera,\n\nan Hispanic Republican, defeated Mattox, a white Democrat.                      Like\n\nGonzalez's Republican opponents, Barrera took a majority of the\n\n\n                                          144\n\fAnglo votes, while his white opponent took a majority of the\n\nminority votes.       In short, as in Midland County, the evidence\n\nestablishes that voting patterns in Lubbock County were unaffected\n\nby the race of the candidates.           Rather, they resulted from party\n\nloyalty.     Therefore, plaintiffs have not met the third Gingles\n\nfactor.\n\n     The plaintiffs point to two exogenous Democratic primary\n\nelections    for    state   appellate     and    Supreme   Court    positions.42\n\nHowever, the minority-preferred candidate won a majority of the\n\nvotes cast in one of these two elections.             Although Martinez was\n\ndefeated, Gonzalez won a majority of the votes cast in the Lubbock\n\nCounty Democratic primary for the Supreme Court.                These primary\n\nraces, therefore, do not indicate that the minority-preferred\n\ncandidate was consistently defeated within the meaning of Gingles,\n\nand they cannot establish dilution.\n\n                               I. Ector County\n\n     There are four district judges in Ector County.                All of them\n\nare Anglo.     There are fewer than 200 lawyers in the county.\n\nSurveys estimate that no more than six of them are black or\n\nHispanic and eligible to become district judges.                Ector County,\n\nwhose principal city is Odessa, has 79,516 voting age residents.\n\n14,147    (17.8%)    are    Hispanic,    while    3,255    (4.1%)   are   black.\n\n\n     42\n      As we stated in the discussion of Jefferson County, supra\nPart VI.F, we hold that the runoff election subsequent to a\nprimary election is a single election for the purposes of\ncomputing the success or failure of the minority-preferred\ncandidate. The victor of the runoff election is the victor of\nthe combined primary/runoff race.\n\n                                        145\n\fPlaintiffs proceed on behalf of the combined minority population in\n\nEctor County.\n\n     The parties relied on the same exogenous races in Ector County\n\nthat they produced in Lubbock County.                The plaintiffs examined\n\nprimary   and     general    elections     for    appellate    courts    involving\n\nMartinez and Gonzalez.           The defendants added Barrera's bid for\n\nAttorney General.\n\n     The undisputed facts indicate that the minority-preferred,\n\nDemocratic      candidates      were   consistently      defeated      in   general\n\nelections    by    an   Anglo    majority       voting   for   their    Republican\n\nopponents. In the Democratic primaries, Martinez won a majority of\n\nthe vote.         The   minority-preferred       candidate     won   half   of   the\n\nDemocratic      primary     races   and    therefore     was   not    consistently\n\ndefeated in the primaries.\n\n     As in Lubbock County on virtually identical facts, we find\n\nthat the district court clearly erred in finding racial vote\n\ndilution.    The undisputed facts indicate that partisan affiliation\n\ncontrolled the outcomes of the general elections.                    As in Lubbock\n\nCounty, while Hispanic Democratic candidates lost the Anglo vote,\n\nBarrera, a Hispanic Republican, won a majority of the Anglo vote\n\nrunning against his white Democratic opponent Mattox.\n\n     While partisan affiliation would not explain polarization in\n\nthe primaries, the facts indicate that the minority-preferred\n\ncandidate was not consistently defeated by racial polarization in\n\nthe primary elections.          Rather, Martinez won one of the two races\n\n\n\n\n                                          146\n\fanalyzed. Plaintiffs have failed to meet the third prerequisite of\n\nGingles.\n\n                                VII. Conclusion\n\n      We would expect over time that the Texas judiciary would\n\nreflect the black and Hispanic population eligible to serve--if\n\njudges, for example, were drawn from a pool of all persons eligible\n\nto serve.      In truth, minority lawyers fare better than we would\n\nexpect from a random process.             We do not suggest that because they\n\nfare better than they would in a system of random selection, voting\n\nrights of blacks and Hispanics could not have been illegally\n\ndiluted.      Rather, the observation is relevant because it brings\n\nperspective to this battle by drawing borders around its asserted\n\nimplications and deflating overdrawn invocations of large wrongs of\n\nhistory, unremedied and unanswered.\n\n      There is no disparity between the number of minority judges\n\nand the number of minorities eligible to serve.                 Rather, the only\n\ndisparity     is     between   the   minority      population      and    minorities\n\neligible to serve as judges.               Much can be said about that--of\n\ndeficits in education and other social shortchangings of black and\n\nHispanic persons.         To those who push judicial entry onto this\n\nlarger field we must answer that our task is more narrowly drawn--\n\nto   decide    if    voting    rights     have   been    denied.     We    lack   the\n\nauthority, even if we had the wisdom, to do more.                         The Voting\n\nRights Act is not an unbridled license--to explore for example the\n\npersistent     low    enrollment     of    black   law   students.        One   small\n\nexample.      This year the law school at Louisiana State University\n\n\n                                          147\n\fgraduated the largest number of black students in its history.\n\nThis followed intensive recruiting efforts including the inducement\n\nof   a free   education--with     stipends.      Of   the   several   hundred\n\nstudents graduated, ten were black. This sad story can be repeated\n\nat school after school.      We are told that this is not relevant.          We\n\nthink that it is.\n\n       We decline to reach for social questions beyond the Voting\n\nRights Act by recasting its meaning and purpose.             Ultimately, we\n\ncannot escape the steely truth that we cannot arrive at sound\n\nanswers if we fail to ask the right questions.         We think that today\n\nwe have asked the correct questions and answered them as best we\n\ncan.\n\n       REVERSED\n\nJONES, Circuit Judge, with whom JOLLY, SMITH, BARKSDALE and DeMOSS,\nCircuit Judges, join in concurring in majority opinion:\n\n            Judge Higginbotham's excellent opinion resolves all but\n\none of the issues in dispute between the parties, and I am pleased\n\nto concur in it as far as it goes.         The single issue that I believe\n\nshould have been discussed is whether different racial or language\n\nminority groups may be permitted to aggregate their strength in\n\norder to pursue a Section 2 vote dilution claim.            Permitting such\n\na black/Hispanic coalition claim was vital to plaintiffs' success\n\nin three counties in this case.             The issue was preserved for\n\nappeal, albeit as an aside to the all-pervasive issues;43 it\n\n\n      43\n            Although the en banc majority opinion adopts the minority\ncoalition theory for certain aspects of its analysis, those points are not\nessential to its result and simply demonstrate that the plaintiffs' own\narguments are self-contradictory.\n\n                                     148\n\ffurnishes an alternate ground of decision in the three counties.\n\nI believe the en banc court should lay to rest the minority\n\ncoalition theory of vote dilution claims.44\n\n           Congress did not authorize the pursuit of Section 2 vote\n\ndilution claims by coalitions of distinct ethnic and language\n\nminorities.    What Congress did not legislate, this court cannot\n\nengraft onto the statute.      Except in two eccentric decisions from\n\nTexas, the coalition theory has found no factual support anywhere\n\nelse in the federal courts.       The crucial problem inherent in the\n\nminority coalition theory, articulated by Judge Higginbotham and\n\nrealized in this case, is that it transforms the Voting Rights Act\n\nfrom a statute that levels the playing field for all races to one\n\nthat forcibly     advances   contrived    interest-group    coalitions    of\n\nracial or ethnic minorities.\n\n           According to customary legal analysis, there should be no\n\nneed to discuss the minority coalition theory of vote dilution\n\nbecause the text of the Voting Rights Act does not support it.           The\n\nAct originally protected only black voters.        When it was amended in\n\n1975 to reach language minorities, the Act then identified four new\n\ncovered groups: persons of Spanish heritage; all American Indians;\n\n\"Asian Americans\" including Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Filipino\n\nAmericans; and Alaskan natives.        42 U.S.C. § 1973(b)(f)(1).       That\n\n\n      44\n            The Supreme Court has acknowledged but not addressed the minority\ncoalition theory. Growe v.

It speaks only of a \"class of citizens\" and \"a\n\nprotected class.\"       42 U.S.C. § 1973(b).        Had Congress chosen\n\nexplicitly to protect minority coalitions it could have done so by\n\ndefining the \"results\" test in terms of protected classes of\n\ncitizens.   It did not.\n\n            Two arguments have been made for extending the Voting\n\nRights Act to minority coalitions.

But as Judge Higginbotham pointed out, this is answering\n\nthe wrong question.       The proper question is whether Congress\n\n\n                                  150\n\fintended    to   protect   coalitions.       Campos,    849   F.2d   at   945\n\n(Higginbotham, J. dissenting from denial of reh. en banc).                \"The\n\nfact that both groups are protected does not justify the assumption\n\nthat a new group composed of both minorities is itself a protected\n\ngroup,\" Butler and Murray, supra, at 647.              Judge Higginbotham\n\nexplained the distinction:\n\n            In deciding to protect language minorities,\n            Congress recognized that language and racial\n            minorities share many disabilities.         To\n            assume, however, that a group composed of both\n            minorities is itself a protected minority is\n            an unwarranted extension of congressional\n            intent. A group tied by overlapping political\n            agendas but not tied by the same statutory\n            disability is no more than a political\n            alliance or coalition.\n\n840 F.2d at 945.\n\n            The second argument advanced by a court that permitted a\n\nminority coalition claim under Section 2 begs the question of\n\nstatutory construction altogether.           This position asserts that\n\nbecause a minority coalition may meet the three-prong Gingles test,\n\nincluding    the   criterion    of   the    minority    group's    political\n\ncohesiveness, it may gain relief from vote dilution.45                    This\n\nargument was successful in a Texas case in which, paradoxically,\n\nthe court also acknowledged that Gingles           says nothing about the\n\npossibility of granting relief to minority group coalitions.46\n\n\n\n     45\n            A general citation to Thornburg v. Gingles, the Supreme Court's\ndecision on vote dilution, is superfluous at this point in our court's\nwriting.\n     46\n            Butler and Murray, supra at 642, observe that before the Midland\ncase, blacks and Hispanics had pursued Voting Rights Act cases together, but\nthey had sought separate districts or relief for each minority.\n\n                                     151\n\fPreviously, it had rejected a plan offered by the plaintiffs that\n\ncontained a mixed black/Hispanic district, because it found the\n\ninterests of these two minorities too divergent to justify their\n\nsubmergence in one district.        Nevertheless, it predicated a new,\n\ninexplicably    opposite      finding      on   Gingles'    second   prong   and\n\ndetermined     that   the   coalition      of   blacks     and   Hispanics   was\n\npolitically cohesive.

Tex. 1986).47\n\nAgain, Judge Higginbotham noted the court's error in purporting to\n\nrely on Gingles:\n\n           [Gingles'] three-step inquiry assumes a group\n           unified by race or national origin and asks if\n           it is cohesive in its voting. If a minority\n           group lacked common race or ethnicity,\n           cohesion must rely primarily on shared values,\n           socioeconomic    factors,     and    coalition\n           formation,    making    the    group    almost\n           indistinguishable from political minorities as\n           opposed to racial minorities.\n\nMidland, 812 F.2d at 1504.        Reliance on Gingles is false because\n\nGingles does not address the meaning of or solution to vote\n\ndilution of a minority coalition.\n\n\n\n\n     47\n           The court's finding on political cohesiveness was supported only\nby this:\n           . . . Blacks and Hispanics worked together and formed\n           coalitions when their goals were compatible.\n           Additionally, the bringing of this lawsuit provides\n           evidence that blacks and Hispanics have common\n           interests that induce the formation of coalitions.\n           Id.\n            Butler and Murray term \"shocking\" the court's reliance only on the\nfacts that suit has been brought jointly and that the minority groups are\nwilling to work together to accomplish \"compatible\" goals. Butler and Murray,\nsupra at 667.\n\n\n                                     152\n\f            A   principal     reason    for    distinguishing          homogeneous,\n\nexplicitly defined minority groups from minority coalitions lies in\n\nSection 2 itself.      One may be uncertain what Congress might think\n\nabout   permitting     minority      coalitions    to    assert    vote     dilution\n\nclaims, but     Congress     clearly    walked    a     fine   line    in   amending\n\nSection 2 to codify the results test for vote dilution claims while\n\nexpressly prohibiting proportional representation for minority\n\ngroups.    The results test of vote dilution inherently recognizes\n\nthat a minority group will sometimes fail to merit a single member\n\ndistrict solely because they lack the population to \"constitute a\n\nmajority in a single member district.\"            Gingles, ___ U .S. ___, 106\n\nS.   Ct.   at   2766   and   n.17.      Permitting       Section      2   claims   by\n\nopportunistic minority coalitions, however, artificially escapes\n\nthis hurdle.     As a result, the remedy afforded to the coalition may\n\neasily cross the line from protecting minorities against racial\n\ndiscrimination to the prohibited, and possibly unconstitutional,\n\ngoal of mandating proportional representation.48\n\n            The tension in Section 2 between the results test and the\n\nprohibition      of     proportional         representation           fundamentally\n\n\n      48\n            The Midland case illustrates this point.       The district court\napproved a \"remedy\"\n            in the form of the best available single member\n            district to each of the two groups, even though\n            neither could satisfy [Gingles'] requirements of size\n            and compactness. . . . Ironically, Section 2, which\n            specifically disavows a right to proportional\n            representation, was used to provide greater than\n            proportional representation for two groups, neither of\n            whom would have qualified for a seat had proportional\n            representation actually been the law.\nButler and Murray, supra, 667-68 (emphasis added).\n\n                                       153\n\fdistinguishes this case from Chisom v. Roemer, ___ U.S. ___, 111 S.\n\nCt. 2354 (1991), in which the Supreme Court concluded that judicial\n\nelections are covered by Section 2.          Stating that certain types of\n\nelections are within Section 2 is a definitional exercise.                   In\n\nChisom, the Court held that judicial elections, having once been\n\ncovered by the Act, remained covered following the 1982 amendment\n\nto Section 2.      But it is a remedial exercise to decide whether to\n\napply the results test to a minority coalition united not by race\n\nor language but only by their desire to advance a particular\n\nagenda.    Enlarging the permissible boundaries of Section 2 relief\n\nto encompass minority coalitions thus runs headlong into the\n\nSection 2 prohibition of proportional representation, creating a\n\nconflict that the Supreme Court did not face in Chisom.\n\n               If Section 2 is held to permit relief for minority\n\ncoalitions, the complications for Voting Rights Act litigation in\n\nour increasingly multi-ethnic society will be enormous.                   Those\n\ncomplications alone imply that Congress rather than the courts\n\nshould first address any such innovation. Certain questions should\n\ngive pause even to the advocates of minority coalitions.              As Judge\n\nHigginbotham observed, the availability of a minority coalition\n\ntheory could be a defense against an attack on an at-large system.\n\nCampos    v.    City   of   Baytown,   Texas,   supra   849   F.2d   at   945-46\n\n(Higginbotham, J.).         Where the combined groups comprise more than\n\nhalf of a voting population in a plausible single-member district,\n\ntheir \"cohesion\" could be used as a device to \"pack\" the minorities\n\ntogether. Further, on what basis would a court apportion districts\n\n\n                                       154\n\fin the wake of a successful minority coalition Section 2 suit?                   If\n\neach minority is given an opportunity to prevail in a district, is\n\nthis not an admission that the coalition is ephemeral and not\n\nreally \"cohesive\" as Gingles requires? Is it possible that greater\n\nracial    animosity     will   develop     if   a   court     permits       minority\n\naggregation on too insubstantial a basis and effectively submerges\n\nmembers of one group in a district controlled by the other group?\n\nCourts should be loath to embark upon coalition redistricting with\n\nno expressed guidance from a statute that reflects the will of the\n\nAmerican people.\n\n            If,   notwithstanding        the    absence      of   Congressional\n\nauthorization,     minority     coalitions      are   permitted        to     assert\n\naggregate Section 2 vote dilution claims, relief must be predicated\n\non more evidence of the group's homogeneity than the maintenance of\n\na joint lawsuit.      See note 5, supra.        This is so for two reasons.\n\nAs noted earlier, if a fortuitous coalition of minorities can gain\n\nSection 2 relief on tenuous proof of cohesion, the courts will have\n\neffectively undone Congress's explicit disapproval of proportional\n\nrepresentation.       The less cohesive the groups truly are, the more\n\nlikely relief has been fashioned only because of the groups' joint\n\nminority status.      Second, there is risk to members of the minority\n\ngroups themselves if their electoral fates are joined even though\n\nthey do not share fundamentally similar social and political goals.\n\nTo   be   sure,   the    problem   of    determining        minority    political\n\ncohesiveness under Gingles may be difficult even when the claims of\n\n\n\n\n                                     155\n\fone minority group are at issue.49              But it should be self-evident\n\nthat the problem is compounded when different minority groups, with\n\nradically       different        cultural       and        language     backgrounds,\n\nsocioeconomic characteristics and experiences of discrimination\n\nseek Section 2 coalition status.                Forcibly merging fundamentally\n\ndifferent       groups     for   the      purpose     of    providing       \"minority\"\n\nrepresentation could be a cruel hoax upon those who are not\n\ncohesive with self-styled minority spokesmen.\n\n            The difficulty of proving vote dilution on behalf of\n\ncoalitions of minorities has been vividly realized in practice.\n\nExcept in the Midland and Campos cases, there appear to be no\n\nreported decisions in which sufficient proof of the minority\n\ncoalition theory was adduced to justify Section 2 relief.                           The\n\ntheory    has    been    litigated     all   over     the    country,   but    it   has\n\nrepeatedly      been     rejected    on   factual     grounds.

Ironically, while citing the Butler\n\nand Murray article to which I have referred, the panel makes no use\n\nof its cautionary data or its conclusion:\n\n                Proponents of coalition dilution suits\n           argue that minority groups are natural allies\n           because of their shared exclusion from the\n           dominant society, and their similar lower\n           socioeconomic    status,   which,    proponents\n           maintain, is a product of past discrimination.\n           Despite the simplistic logic of this position,\n           it does not comport with the reality revealed\n           by social science studies.       Those studies\n           suggest just the opposite.       The rarity of\n           documented    political    alliances    between\n           minority groups is the natural consequence of\n           differences    in    their     attitudes    and\n           perceptions. Studies indicate that minorities\n           in fact identify more closely with the\n           dominant group than with other minorities.\n           Moreover, perceptions of discrimination vary\n           widely among groups. Blacks, for example, are\n\n\n      51\n            See, e.g., Dyer, Dedlitz and Worochel, Social Distance Among\nRacial and Ethnic Groups in Texas, Some Demographic Correlates, 70 Social\nScience Quarterly 607, 613-14 (1989); Donald L.

Still other studies suggest\n          that   the  underlying   causes  of   lowered\n          socioeconomic status differ among minority\n          groups. Different root causes of poverty are\n          likely to lead to different, possibly even\n          conflicting, demands on the government.\n\nButler and Murray, supra, 688-89.     Butler and Murray contend that\n\nbecause of these differences, minority coalitions \"very seldom\"\n\nought to be able to prove vote dilution under Section 2.     Butler\n\nand Murray, supra at 687.   The short answer to plaintiffs' joint\n\nSection 2 claims in Lubbock, Ector and Midland Counties is that\n\nthey did not meet their burden of proof that blacks and Hispanics\n\nare sufficiently like a single minority group to entitle the\n\ncoalition to one judicial district in each county.\n\n                            Conclusion\n\n          The Congressional compromise that resulted in the passage\n\nof Section 2 left the field of voting rights wide open to courts in\n\nmany respects. Congress did not, however, contemplate or authorize\n\nrelief for coalitions of racial and language minority groups.    For\n\nthe courts to provide such relief, in my view, judicially amends\n\nthe Act and flies in the face of the express prohibition of\n\nproportional representation in Section 2.    At the very least, only\n\nunder very convincing proof of a minority coalition's sociological\n\nsimilarities and goals as well as its political cohesion can such\n\na claim be made.   In this case, plaintiffs have not carried their\n\nburden of proof concerning Lubbock, Midland or Ector Counties. Our\n\ncourt's previous decisions in Midland and Campos must be overruled.\n\n\n\n                                159\n\fWith these additional observations, I concur in the majority\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\nPOLITZ, Chief Judge, with whom JOHNSON, KING and WIENER, Circuit\n\nJudges, join, dissenting:\n\n\n\n     I respectfully dissent.

Pray tell, what more do we need to accept the\n\nproposed settlement as being made on behalf of the State of Texas?\n\n     That Chief Justice Phillips has voiced an objection does not\n\nalter the certainty that the State of Texas, through its authorized\n\nspokesman, wishes to settle this matter.      As chairman of the\n\nJudicial Districts Board, Chief Justice Phillips has a measure of\n\nauthority over judicial apportionments. We cannot ignore, however,\n\nthat the Board's authority in this area SQ and hence that of the\n\nChief Justice SQ is entirely subject to the will of a majority of\n\n\n\n\n     58\n      Terrazas, 829 S.W.2d at 722; id. at 747 (Mauzy, J.,\ndissenting) (at least seven justices agree that \"[t]he attorney\ngeneral is constitutionally empowered to execute a settlement\nagreement in litigation challenging a legislative redistricting\nplan.\").\n     59\n      The majority also makes much of the fact that the consent\ndecree allows the State of Texas to take actions which would\notherwise be prohibited by state law.

We are a court of errors; the\ndistrict court should have an opportunity to conduct a hearing\nand determine whether to enter the consent decree before we\ndecide the merits of such action.\n     I further note that although courts generally must defer to\nstate apportionment policy in fashioning the remedy for a\nviolation of Section 2, district courts have equitable power to\ndepart from state law if necessary. See, e.g., White v.

City of Cleveland, 478 U.S. at 528-29; City of Miami,\n664 F.2d at 447 (\"the parties to litigation are not to be\ndeprived of the opportunity to compose their differences by\nobjections that find no basis in prejudice to the objector\").\nFinally, the majority opines that the status of Judges Entz and\nWood as voters in Harris County somehow clothes them with\nauthority to block a settlement favored by competent state\nauthorities. While the district courts certainly should permit\ninput from such intervenors when considering entry of a consent\ndecree, to accord them what amounts to a veto, as the majority\ndoes, would effectively preclude settlement of any Section 2\nlitigation SQ an absurd and unconscionable result which I refuse\nto embrace. See City of Cleveland, 478 U.S. at 529 (\"[W]hile an\nintervenor is entitled to present evidence and have its\nobjections heard at the hearings on whether to approve a consent\ndecree, it does not have power to block the decree merely by\nwithholding its consent.\"). Extending the majority's analysis\nwould result in any voter being able to block settlement of any\nsuit against the state or one of its subdivisions. That simply\ncannot be. See Apache Bend Apts. v.

No one may seriously suggest that this voting\n\nrights case could not have progressed to a definitive conclusion\n\nwithout the presence of the Chief Justice. The awesome decision to\n\ndeny parties an opportunity to compromise and settle their case,\n\nmuch less a case as important as that here presented, must be based\n\non a much more solid, indeed a compelling basis.\n\n     I    would   remand    this   case    to     the   district   court      for\n\nconsideration of the proposed consent decree.\n\nKING, Circuit Judge, with whom, POLITZ, Chief Judge, and JOHNSON,\n\nCircuit Judge, join, dissenting:\n\n     The majority ably accomplishes what it set out to do in this\n\ncase:    reach the merits of this appeal so that it can overhaul the\n\nVoting Rights Act.       Indeed, from its initial decision to deny the\n\nmotion to remand filed by the Plaintiffs and the State of Texas, to\n\nits decision to reverse the district court's judgment in each of\n\nthe nine target counties, the majority proceeds with a kind of\n\ndetermination not often seen in a judicial opinion.                Like Chief\n\nJudge Politz, I believe that the parties should be given the\n\nopportunity to settle this case.          I also believe that fidelity to\n\nthe Voting Rights Act requires us to affirm the district court's\n\njudgment in eight of the nine target counties.               Accordingly, I\n\nrespectfully dissent.\n\n     The majority's decision to deny the motion to remand, even\n\nstanding alone,     is    indefensible.      It    demonstrates    a   lack    of\n\n\n                                    164\n\fjudicial restraint and sets a bad precedent.                Under the majority's\n\nreasoning, states and political subdivisions embroiled in section\n\n2 lawsuits must now defend their electoral practices to the bitter\n\nend--unless those practices can be changed in accordance with state\n\nlaw and everyone who is even remotely connected with the lawsuit\n\nagrees to the proposed changes.           Because these circumstances are\n\nunlikely to occur, the majority has effectively ensured that\n\nsection 2 cases will rarely, if ever, be settled.\n\n     In light of the majority's seriously flawed decision on the\n\nmerits of this case, however, its decision to deny the motion to\n\nremand becomes even more indefensible.              In my view, the majority's\n\ndiscussion of the merits--complete with a declaration that blacks\n\nand Hispanics are just two more interest groups and a conclusion\n\nthat blacks and Hispanics are overrepresented on the Texas district\n\ncourt   bench--perhaps     provides      the   best       argument   against   its\n\ndecision to deny the parties' motion to remand this case for a\n\nsettlement    hearing.     In    fact,    it   is    only    after   reading   the\n\nmajority's decision on the merits that one can truly understand why\n\nit denied the motion to remand.          For that reason, I begin with the\n\nmerits.\n\n\n\n                                I.   THE MERITS\n\n     In reversing the district court's judgment, the majority\n\nultimately concludes that the evidence of vote dilution in this\n\ncase is \"marginal\"--too marginal to outweigh the State of Texas'\n\nsubstantial    interests   in    maintaining        the    current   system.    I\n\n\n                                      165\n\fdisagree with this conclusion on two fronts.          First, I reject the\n\nmajority's assertion that the evidence of vote dilution in this\n\ncase is weak.      Under the established analytical framework for\n\nassessing section 2 claims, the Plaintiffs' evidence of vote\n\ndilution is anything but weak; indeed, it is only by changing the\n\nrules that the majority can so characterize the evidence in this\n\ncase.     I also disagree with the majority's determination that the\n\nState of Texas' interests in maintaining its current at-large\n\nelection system are substantial.       In my view, these interests are\n\nlittle more than tenuous and therefore could not outweigh even\n\n\"marginal\" evidence of vote dilution.\n\nA.   The Plaintiffs' Evidence of Vote Dilution:              Overhauling a\n     Congressional Statute\n\n     As explained in my earlier opinion, the evidence of vote\n\ndilution in this case is substantial.

This is because the majority has changed the\n\nanalytical framework for analyzing vote dilution claims. Along the\n\nway, the majority has distorted Congressional intent, rejected\n\nSupreme Court precedent, and completely altered the focus of the\n\nsection 2 inquiry.     As a result of the majority's handiwork, the\n\nsection 2 inquiry is no longer a blended one which looks to the\n\n\"past and present reality\" of the local political landscape.               See\n\nS. REP. No. 417, 97th Cong., 2d Sess., at 30 (1982), reprinted in\n\n1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 177, 208 [hereinafter S. REP.].             Rather, it is\n\none that looks only at the present, although paradoxically, not at\n\nreality.\n\n     1.    Altering the Racial Bloc Voting Inquiries\n\n     The most glaring example of the majority's efforts to reshape\n\nthe section 2 inquiry is its redefinition of two closely-related\n\nterms--namely, \"legally significant white bloc voting\" under the\n\nthreshold inquiry of Thornburg v. Gingles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111736\"><a href=\"/opinion/111736/thornburg-v-gingles/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986), and\n\n\"racially polarized voting\" under the totality of circumstances\n\ninquiry.   Before today, these terms have been widely understood by\n\nlower   courts,   as   well   as   by   the   Supreme   Court,    to   have   a\n\ndescriptive meaning--a meaning that is completely in accord with\n\n\n                                    167\n\fsection 2's focus on results.        The majority, choosing to ignore\n\nthis wide consensus, acts as if it is writing on a clean slate.\n\nThat is, the majority acts as if Congress and the Supreme Court\n\nhave not spoken on these issues.      Because I refuse to put on such\n\nblinders, I cannot join the majority's decision to reformulate\n\nthese terms.\n\n            a.   The majority's version of racial bloc voting\n\n       The majority's formulation of \"legally significant white bloc\n\nvoting\" under the Gingles threshold inquiry, as well as its view of\n\nracially polarized or racial bloc voting under the totality of\n\ncircumstances    inquiry,   is   confusing--to   say   the   least.   The\n\nmajority spends some thirty pages at the front of its opinion\n\nexplaining what these two closely related terms require; yet at the\n\nend of the section entitled \"Racial Bloc Voting,\" all the reader\n\nknows is that more is required than showing (a) with regard to\n\nlegally significant white bloc voting, that minority-preferred\n\ncandidates are consistently defeated by a white majority, and (b)\n\nfor racially polarized voting, that minorities and whites vote\n\ndifferently. What more is required the majority does not expressly\n\nsay.\n\n       Make no mistake about the majority opinion in this regard:      it\n\ndoes redefine the terms of legally significant white bloc voting\n\nand racially polarized voting.        To understand exactly what the\n\nmajority \"holds\" with respect to these two terms, however, one must\n\nfirst go back to earlier opinions by Judge Higginbotham and then\n\nread the majority's county-by-county analysis in this opinion.         It\n\n\n                                   168\n\fis only then that the majority's holding becomes comprehensible.\n\nSpecifically,       the   majority     holds      that   to   establish       legally\n\nsignificant       white   bloc   voting     and   racially    polarized       voting,\n\nminority plaintiffs must, at the very least, negate partisan\n\npolitics as an explanatory factor for the consistent defeat of\n\ntheir preferred candidates.          The majority further implies--without\n\ndeciding     the    issue--that       minority      plaintiffs     may    have     to\n\naffirmatively prove racial animus in the electorate to meet their\n\nburden with respect to legally significant white bloc voting and\n\nracially polarized voting.\n\n     The starting point for understanding the majority's vague\n\napproach     to     the    racial     bloc     voting     inquiries      is     Judge\n\nHigginbotham's opinion in Jones v. City of Lubbock, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"433062\"><a href=\"/opinion/433062/rev-roy-jones-v-the-city-of-lubbock/\"><span class=\"volume\">730</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">233</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(5th Cir. 1984) (Higginbotham, J., specially concurring from denial\n\nof rehearing).       This is where he first suggested that racial bloc\n\nvoting requires a showing of racial animus in the electorate.                      He\n\nasserted:\n\n     The [racial bloc voting] inquiry is whether race or\n     ethnicity was such a determinant of voting preference in\n     the rejection of black or brown candidates by a white\n     majority that the at-large district, with its components,\n     denied minority voters effective voting opportunity.\n\nId. at 234.       Judge Higginbotham further questioned whether racial\n\nbloc voting could be demonstrated without the use of a multivariate\n\nregression    analysis,      which,    he    argued,     would   eliminate      other\n\npossible causes of voting behavior--such as campaign expenditures,\n\nparty identification, income, media use measured by cost, religion,\n\n\n\n\n                                        169\n\fname identification, or distance that a candidate lived from any\n\nparticular precinct.        See id. at 234-35.\n\n     The racial animus theme was also present, albeit to a lesser\n\nextent, in Judge Higginbotham's earlier dissenting opinion in this\n\ncase,   where    he    strongly   disagreed   with    the     panel   majority's\n\ndefinition of legally significant white bloc voting and racially\n\npolarized voting.        In particular, he stated that the \"consistent\n\ndefeat\" of minority-preferred candidates could not be \"on account\n\nof race or color,\" as required by section 2, unless it is tied to\n\n\"racial bias in the electorate.\"              LULAC III, 986 F.2d at 846\n\n(Higginbotham, J., dissenting).          This, he further stated, \"is the\n\nheart of section 2.\"        Id.; see also id. at 831 (\"[T]he extent to\n\nwhich voting patterns are attributable to causes other than race is\n\nan integral part of the inquiry into racial bloc voting . . . .\").\n\n     It was also in this dissent, however, that Judge Higginbotham\n\nfirst advocated placing on plaintiffs the burden of \"negating\n\npartisan politics\" in order to show legally significant white bloc\n\nvoting and racially polarized voting.              That is, he appeared to\n\nretreat from his earlier, more rigid position of requiring minority\n\nplaintiffs      to    affirmatively    establish     racial    animus    in   the\n\nelectorate and instead described the plaintiffs' burden as one of\n\nnegating partisan politics.           See LULAC III, 986 F.2d at 834.         At\n\nthat point, he was willing to limit the \"inquiry into racial bloc\n\nvoting to determining whether divergent voting patterns are caused\n\nby partisan differences.\"          Id.; see also id. at 845 (\"Proof of\n\nmajority voting based on party affiliation prevents the showing of\n\n\n                                       170\n\fbloc voting required by Gingles.\").            Thus, Judge Higginbotham's\n\nearlier position in this case was that, where the evidence \"shows\n\nthat divergent voting patterns among white and minority voters are\n\nbest explained by partisan affiliation, . . . plaintiffs have\n\nfailed to establish racial bloc voting.\"         Id. at 833-34.      In short,\n\nhe   would   have   required   minority    plaintiffs   to    show   that   the\n\nconsistent defeat of their preferred candidates was not \"readily\n\nattributable to partisan affiliation.\"          Id. at 834.\n\n      There are still vestiges of Judge Higginbotham's earlier\n\npositions in the majority opinion, although in the front of the\n\nopinion they are only expressed as \"powerful arguments.\"                    The\n\nmajority asserts, on the one hand, that it \"need not hold that\n\nplaintiffs must supply conclusive proof that a minority group's\n\nfailure to elect representatives of its choice is caused by racial\n\nanimus in the electorate in order to decide that the district\n\ncourt's judgment must be reversed.\" Majority Opinion at 57-58. It\n\nnotes, however, that a racial animus requirement could readily be\n\ninferred from the text and legislative history of section 2, as\n\nwell as Supreme Court precedent.       See id. at 58.      The majority also\n\nasserts that there is \"a powerful argument supporting a rule that\n\nplaintiffs[,]       to   establish   legally    significant     racial      bloc\n\nvoting[,] must prove that their failure to elect representatives of\n\ntheir choice cannot be characterized as a `mere euphemism for\n\npolitical defeat at the polls.'\"           Id. at 58-59.     In this regard,\n\nthe majority explains that \"[d]escribing plaintiffs' burden in\n\nterms of negating `partisan politics' rather than affirmatively\n\n\n                                     171\n\fproving    `racial     animus'   would     not    be   simply   a   matter   of\n\nnomenclature.\"    Id. at 59.      It notes:      \"A rule conditioning relief\n\nunder § 2 upon proof of the existence of racial animus in the\n\nelectorate would require plaintiffs to establish the absence of not\n\nonly partisan voting, but also all other potentially innocent\n\nexplanations for white voters' rejection of minority-preferred\n\ncandidates.\"     Id.\n\n     Ultimately, however, the majority purports not to resolve the\n\ndebate between Judge Higginbotham's two earlier positions. Whether\n\nthe plaintiffs' burden of proving bloc voting includes the burden\n\nof demonstrating racial animus in the electorate, or only the\n\nburden of negating partisan politics, we are told, \"the result is\n\nthe same.\"     Id. at 61.        The district court's judgment must be\n\nreversed, according to the majority, \"[b]ecause the evidence in\n\nmost instances unmistakably shows that divergent voting patterns\n\namong white and minority voters are best explained by partisan\n\naffiliation\"--thus leaving the Plaintiffs unable to \"establish\n\nracial bloc voting.\"      See id. at 64.\n\n     That the majority has reformulated the concepts of legally\n\nsignificant white bloc voting and racially polarized voting becomes\n\ncrystal clear in its application of the law to each county.                  In\n\nDallas County, for example, the majority holds that the plaintiffs\n\nhave not satisfied the third Gingles threshold requirement.                  It\n\nreasons:\n\n          The evidence in Dallas County clearly establishes\n     that judicial elections are decided on the basis of\n     partisan voting patterns.     We are left with the\n     inescapable conclusion that plaintiffs have failed to\n\n                                     172\n\f     prove that minority-preferred judicial candidates in this\n     county are consistently defeated by racial bloc voting.\n     This is a failure to meet the threshold showing required\n     by Gingles.\n\nId. at 106-07.   The majority makes similarly explicit holdings in\n\nMidland, Lubbock, and Ector counties.      See id. at 141-42 (holding\n\nthat, because partisan affiliation, not race, caused the defeat of\n\nthe minority-preferred   candidate    in   Midland   County   elections,\n\n\"[t]he plaintiffs have not established the third prerequisite of\n\nGingles.\"); id. at 144 (concluding that plaintiffs have not met the\n\nthird Gingles factor because the evidence establishes that the\n\nvoting patterns in Lubbock County resulted from party loyalty, not\n\nrace); id. 145-46 (\"Plaintiffs have failed to meet the third\n\nprerequisite of Gingles\" because the \"undisputed facts indicate\n\nthat partisan affiliation controlled the outcomes of the general\n\nelections.\"). Moreover, in Harris and Bexar counties, the majority\n\nstrongly suggests that, because election outcomes appeared to\n\nresult from partisan politics, the Plaintiffs could not establish\n\nlegally significant white bloc voting.64\n\n     64\n       In reversing the district court's findings of legally\nsignificant white bloc voting in the various counties, the\nmajority relies on trivariate regression analyses submitted by\nthe State of Texas and Judge Wood in this case--analyses which\nunquestionably demonstrated that a candidate's partisan\naffiliation was a better predictor of electoral success than a\ncandidate's race. The majority does not remand this case to the\ndistrict court for consideration of the statistics under the new\nlegal standards for racial bloc voting--as might be expected\nunder Pullman-Standard v. Swint, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110698\"><a href=\"/opinion/110698/pullman-standard-v-swint/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 292 (1982) (where\ndistrict court's factual finding is based upon a misapprehension\nof law, \"a remand is the proper course unless the record permits\nonly one resolution of the factual issue\"). Rather, the majority\nconcludes that the voting statistics in this case are capable of\nonly one interpretation--an interpretation that is severely\nflawed. See infra Part I.A.1.b(ii).\n\n                                173\n\f     Thus,    although             the    majority's     \"holding\"       with    respect    to\n\nlegally significant white bloc voting and racially polarized voting\n\nis confused and elusive--a paradigm of \"fluidity and fixity,\" see\n\nMajority Opinion at 56--it is nonetheless a holding:                                  Minority\n\nplaintiffs must now establish, at a minimum, that the racially\n\ndivergent     voting         which       consistently        defeats     their       preferred\n\ncandidates is not the result of partisan politics.                          Moreover, the\n\nmajority hints that the plaintiffs' burden in this regard may even\n\nbe higher.        That is, minority plaintiffs may have to demonstrate\n\nthat racially divergent voting patterns are due to racial animus in\n\nthe electorate in order to meet their burden under the legally\n\nsignificant       white       bloc       voting    and   racially        polarized     voting\n\ninquiries.\n\n             b.     Problems with the majority's version of racial bloc\n                    voting\n\n     There are grave problems with the majority's approach(es) to\n\nlegally    significant             white    bloc    voting    and    racially        polarized\n\nvoting.       From       a     purely       legal      perspective,       the    majority's\n\nreformulation       of       the    terms    simply      cannot     be   supported.        The\n\nmajority's        approach         is     also     flawed    from    a    social      science\n\nperspective. More importantly, however, the reformulation of these\n\nterms essentially eviscerates section 2 of the Voting Rights Act--\n\nat least in the context of partisan elections.\n\n                                    (i)     Legal problems\n\n     The     majority         asserts        that      its   definitions        of     legally\n\nsignificant white bloc voting and racially polarized voting are\n\n\n\n                                                 174\n\frequired by the language and legislative history of section 2, as\n\nwell as Supreme Court precedent.   I disagree.\n\n     This being a question of statutory interpretation, I turn\n\nfirst to the language of section 2.     That section provides, in\n\npertinent part:\n\n     (a)   No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting\n           or standard, practice, or procedure shall be\n           imposed or applied by any State or political\n           subdivision in a manner which results in a denial\n           or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the\n           United States to vote on account of race or color,\n           or in contravention of the guarantees set forth in\n           section 1973b(f)(2) of this title, as provided in\n           subsection (b) of this section.\n\n     (b)   A violation of subsection (a) of this section is\n           established   if,   based   on  the   totality   of\n           circumstances, it is shown that the political\n           processes leading to nomination or election in the\n           State or political subdivision are not equally open\n           to participation by members of a class of citizens\n           protected by subsection (a) of this section in that\n           its members have less opportunity to participate in\n           the political process and to elect representatives\n           of their choice. The extent to which members of a\n           protected class have been elected to office in the\n           State or political subdivision is one circumstance\n           which may be considered: Provided, That nothing in\n           this section establishes a right to have members of\n           a protected class in numbers equal to their\n           proportion in the population.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973.\n\n     The language of this section does not, under a straightforward\n\nreading, require minority plaintiffs to \"negate partisan politics\"\n\nor demonstrate current racial animus in the electorate.   The words\n\n\"partisan politics\" appear nowhere in the language of section 2.\n\nAnd although subsection (a) does require a link--a critical link--\n\nbetween the denial or abridgment of the right to vote and \"race or\n\ncolor,\" there is no indication that Congress used the phrase \"on\n\n                                175\n\faccount of race or color\" to require proof of either the absence of\n\npartisan    politics       or    the   presence   of   racial    animus     in   the\n\nelectorate.       In fact, Congress emphasized that it used the phrase\n\n\"`on account of race or color' to mean `with respect to race or\n\ncolor,'     and   not     to    connote   any   required   purpose     of   racial\n\ndiscrimination.\"        S. REP. at 27-28 n.109, 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 205-\n\n06 n.109.\n\n      Nor   does    the    legislative      history    accompanying       the    1982\n\namendments to section 2 offer any real support for the majority's\n\nnew   definition     of    legally     significant     white    bloc   voting    and\n\nracially polarized voting.                In a bit of fancy footwork, the\n\nmajority asserts that, pursuant to the Senate Report accompanying\n\nthe amended section 2, racial bloc voting is established when \"race\n\nis the predominant determinant of political preference.\"                  Majority\n\nOpinion at 48.       The Senate Report says no such thing.              It states\n\nthat, in considering the totality of the circumstances, courts\n\nshould examine \"the extent to which voting in the elections of the\n\nstate or political subdivision is racially polarized.\"                  S. REP. at\n\n29, 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 206.              Several pages later, in a section\n\nentitled \"Responses to Questions Raised About the Results Test,\"\n\nthe Senate Report reads:\n\n           The Subcommittee Report claims that the results test\n      assumes \"that race is the predominant determinant of\n      political preference.\"    The Subcommittee Report notes\n      that in many cases racial bloc voting is not so\n      monolithic, and that minority voters do receive\n      substantial support from white voters.\n           That statement is correct, but misses the point. It\n      is true with respect to most communities, and in those\n      communities, it would be exceedingly difficult for\n      plaintiffs to show that they were effectively excluded\n\n                                          176\n\f     from fair access to the political process under the\n     results test.\n          Unfortunately, however, there still are some\n     communities in our Nation where racial politics do\n     dominate the electoral process.\n          In the context of such racial bloc voting, and other\n     factors, a particular election method can deny minority\n     voters equal opportunity to participate meaningfully in\n     elections.\n\nId. at 33, U.S.C.C.A.N. at 211.              This passage, from which the\n\nmajority lifts its definition of racial bloc voting, simply does\n\nnot define the term.       If anything, the reference to the statement\n\n\"that in many cases racial bloc voting is not so monolithic, and\n\nthat minority voters do receive substantial support from white\n\nvoters\" reinforces my view that the racial bloc voting inquiry\n\nlooks only at the extent to which minorities and whites vote\n\ndifferently.      See infra Part I.A.1.c.\n\n     Even more incredible, however, is the majority's assertion\n\nthat the Supreme Court's definition of legally significant white\n\nbloc voting, as set forth in Justice Brennan's opinion in Gingles,\n\nis still open to question.           Five Justices joined the part of\n\nJustice      Brennan's    opinion   laying     out    the   Gingles   threshold\n\nrequirements--including the requirement that minority plaintiffs\n\n\"must   be    able   to   demonstrate   that    the    white   majority   votes\n\nsufficiently as a bloc to enable it . . . usually to defeat the\n\nminority's preferred candidate.\"             478 U.S. at 51.          Moreover,\n\ncontrary to the majority's assertions otherwise, five Justices also\n\njoined in Part III.B.2. of Justice Brennan's opinion, where he\n\ndefined legally significant white bloc voting as \"a white bloc vote\n\n\n\n\n                                      177\n\fthat normally will defeat the combined strength of minority support\n\nplus white `crossover' votes.\"          Id. at 56.\n\n     Although there was some disagreement over the appropriate\n\nframework for analyzing section 2 claims at the time Gingles was\n\ndecided--specifically, from Justice O'Connor--recent Supreme Court\n\ncases   confirm   that      the   threshold    test    announced   in    Justice\n\nBrennan's    majority    opinion    still     controls.     In    Voinovich   v.\n\nQuilter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112824\"><a href=\"/opinion/112824/voinovich-v-quilter/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1149</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1157 (1993), Justice O'Connor, writing\n\nfor a unanimous Court, stated:\n\n     In Thornburg v. Gingles, supra, this Court held that\n     plaintiffs claiming vote dilution must prove three\n     threshold conditions. First, they must show that the\n     minority group is sufficiently large and geographically\n     compact to constitute a majority in a single-member\n     district.   Second, they must prove that the minority\n     group is politically cohesive.     Third, the plaintiffs\n     must establish that the white majority votes sufficiently\n     as a bloc to enable it . . . usually to defeat the\n     minority's preferred candidate.\n\n(emphasis    added)     (internal    quotations       omitted)   (ellipsis    in\n\noriginal).    The Court similarly embraced the Gingles threshold\n\ntest, as formulated by Justice Brennan, in Growe v. Emison, 113 S.\n\nCt. 1075, 1084 (1993), another unanimous opinion.\n\n     Thus,    when    the   majority    reformulates      the    third   Gingles\n\nthreshold factor and requires minority plaintiffs to negate the\n\nexistence of partisan politics (or possibly to prove racial animus\n\nin the electorate), it does so in the face of binding Supreme Court\n\nprecedent. Moreover, even assuming that Gingles did not decide the\n\nquestion of what constitutes legally significant white bloc voting\n\nand racially polarized voting, I still cannot agree with the\n\nmajority's rendition of the various opinions in the case.\n\n                                       178\n\f     The   primary    disagreement       in    Gingles   concerned Justice\n\nBrennan's statement that \"the reasons black and white voters vote\n\ndifferently have no relevance to the central section 2 inquiry.\"\n\n478 U.S. at 63 (emphasis added).          Justice O'Connor, writing for\n\nthree other Justices, disagreed.         She rejected Justice Brennan's\n\nassertion that explanations for racially divergent voting patterns\n\n\"can never affect the overall vote dilution inquiry,\" id. at 100\n\n(emphasis added), and cited two examples of how such explanations\n\nmight affect it.     First, she noted:\n\n     Evidence that a candidate preferred by the minority group\n     in a particular election was rejected by white voters for\n     reasons other than those which made that candidate the\n     preferred choice of the minority group would seem clearly\n     relevant in answering the question whether bloc voting by\n     white   voters   will   consistently    defeat   minority\n     candidates.\n\nId. (emphasis added).     She also believed that \"Congress intended\n\nthat explanations of the reasons why white voters rejected minority\n\ncandidates would be probative of the likelihood that candidates\n\nelected without minority support would be willing to take the\n\nminority interests into account.\"        Id.    Contrary to the majority's\n\nassertions, however, Justice O'Connor did not \"maintain[] that\n\nevidence   that   white   and   minority      voters   generally   supported\n\ndifferent candidates did not constitute legally significant racial\n\nbloc voting where these patterns were attributable to partisan\n\naffiliation rather than the race of the candidate.\"                Majority\n\nOpinion at 51.    On this issue, she stated:\n\n     Insofar as statistical evidence of divergent racial\n     voting patterns is admitted solely to establish that the\n     minority group is politically cohesive and to assess its\n     prospects for electoral success, I agree that defendants\n\n                                   179\n\f     cannot rebut this showing by offering evidence that\n     divergent racial voting patterns may be explained in part\n     by causes other than race.\n\nGingles, 478 U.S. at 100 (emphasis added). This statement suggests\n\nthat evidence that divergent voting patterns are explained in part\n\nby partisan affiliation will not preclude a finding of legally\n\nsignificant white bloc voting--a finding which bears directly on\n\nthe minority group's \"prospects for electoral success.\"65\n\n     The    secondary    disagreement        in   Gingles   concerned     Justice\n\nBrennan's statement that \"the race of the candidate per se is\n\nirrelevant to racial bloc voting analysis.\"                    478 U.S. at 67.\n\nJustice    White    disagreed   with   this       statement,   as   did   Justice\n\nO'Connor.     Specifically, they both argued that the race of the\n\ncandidate is relevant to the racial bloc voting inquiry.                  See id.\n\nat 83, 101.        That the race of the candidate is relevant to the\n\nracial bloc voting inquiry, however, does not translate to a\n\nrequirement that minority plaintiffs must negate partisan politics\n\n\n\n     65\n       The majority suggests that evidence that racially\ndivergent voting patterns are attributable to partisan\naffiliation or perceived interests is \"quite probative\" on the\nquestion of whether white bloc voting will consistently defeat\nminority-preferred candidates. Majority Opinion at 57 n.26. I\nstrongly disagree. If the \"perceived interests\" of minority\nvoters lead them to vote for candidates of one political party,\nwhile the interests of a majority of whites lead them to vote for\ncandidates of a different party, this would seem to strengthen,\nnot weaken, the consistency with which the two racial groups\nwould vote differently. That election results appear to be\nattributable to voting along party lines, then, does not suggest\nthat other candidates, \"equally preferred by the minority group,\nmight be able to attract greater white support in future\nelections.\" In short, it does nothing to undercut--and may even\nstrengthen--the consistency with which minority-preferred\ncandidates are defeated.\n\n                                       180\n\for prove racial animus in the electorate in order to demonstrate\n\npolarized voting.\n\n       Finally, I must say a few words about the Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in Whitcomb v. Chavis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108364\"><a href=\"/opinion/108364/whitcomb-v-chavis/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1971), upon which the\n\nmajority places heavy reliance.        The outcome in that case--i.e.,\n\nthe Supreme Court's reversal of the district court's vote dilution\n\nfinding--did not, in my view or in Congress' view, turn on the\n\nabsence of racial bloc voting.        Rather, as Congress indicated in\n\nthe Senate Report accompanying the 1982 amendments to section 2,\n\nthe district court's error in Whitcomb was finding vote dilution\n\n\"on the basis of proof that black ghetto residents with dist[inct]\n\nlegislative interests had been consistently underrepresented in the\n\nlegislature in comparison with their proportion of the population.\"\n\nS. REP. at 20, 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 198; see also id. at 23, 1982\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 200 (\"Whitcomb . . . recognized that, in order to\n\nprevail, plaintiffs had to prove more than that minority members\n\nhad not elected legislators in proportion to their percentage of\n\nthe population.\"). Also significant to the outcome in Whitcomb, in\n\nCongress' view, was the fact that nine blacks had won at-large\n\nelections in the time period studied in Whitcomb.        See id. at 21,\n\n1982    U.S.C.C.A.N.   at   198.66     Significantly,   Congress   never\n\n       66\n       The Department of Justice (DOJ) argues persuasively in\nits en banc brief that the real issue in Whitcomb was not whether\nblacks in Marion County generally were denied an opportunity to\nelect their chosen candidates, but whether ghetto blacks were\nbeing denied such an opportunity. DOJ points specifically to\nevidence suggesting that \"black voters in a middle-class black\narea were able to elect candidates from their area even when\nRepublicans were winning generally.\" See Whitcomb, 403 U.S. at\n133, 150 n.29 (noting that census tract 220, inhabited\n\n                                     181\n\finterpreted Whitcomb to require minority plaintiffs to prove that\n\nthe consistent defeat of their preferred candidates is not the\n\nresult of partisan politics. As explained more fully in my earlier\n\nopinion, Whitcomb stands for the proposition that where there is\n\nevidence of partisan voting or interest group politics and no\n\nevidence that      members   of   the    minority   group   have    an   unequal\n\nopportunity to participate in the political process on account of\n\nrace or color, the minority group's vote dilution claim will fail.\n\nSee LULAC III, 986 F.2d at 808-10.\n\n                     (ii)    Social science problems\n\n       Even without the legal problems inherent in the majority's\n\napproach to legally significant white bloc voting and racially\n\npolarized voting, the majority's approach is severely flawed from\n\na social science perspective.           Regardless of whether the majority\n\nrequires a multivariate regression analysis, which would seek to\n\neliminate all causes of voting behavior other than race, or only a\n\ntrivariate regression analysis, which would attempt to eliminate\n\npartisan affiliation, there is a problem with requiring this type\n\nof evidence as an integral part of the vote dilution inquiry:                 it\n\nignores the critical distinction between experimental research and\n\nnon-experimental research. Specifically, it ignores the warning of\n\nmost   respected    social   scientists,      including     the    experts   who\n\n\n\n\npredominantly by middle class blacks, elected one senator and\nfive representatives). The ghetto area had similar success.\nDuring the same time period, it elected one senator and four\nrepresentatives. Id. at 150 n.29.\n\n                                        182\n\ftestified in this case,67 that the causes of voting behavior cannot\n\nbe determined from the use of any kind of regression analysis--\n\nwhether bivariate, trivariate, or multivariate.\n\n      It is important to recognize that the kind of evidence that\n\nthe majority requires minority plaintiffs to introduce will involve\n\nno   experimental    manipulation        of    independent   variables.   The\n\nplaintiffs will not be able to manipulate the race or party\n\naffiliation of the candidate to determine which one had the greater\n\neffect on election outcomes.         Rather, the plaintiffs will have to\n\ntake existing election results and work backwards.               This kind of\n\nreal world research has been labelled \"non-experimental research\"\n\nby social scientists.       See ELAZAR J. PEDHAZUR, MULTIPLE REGRESSION    IN\n\nBEHAVIORAL RESEARCH: EXPLANATION   AND   PREDICTION 175 (2d ed. 1982).\n\n      There are two main problems with inferring causation on the\n\nbasis of regression analyses in the context of non-experimental\n\nresearch:\n\n      First, variables used in nonexperimental research may be,\n      and often are, proxies for causal variables that are not\n      included in the regression equation. . . . Needless to\n      say, manipulating a proxy variable will not bring about\n      a desired effect regardless of the magnitude of the\n      regression coefficient associated with it.      Yet, one\n      encounters frequently not only the interpretation of\n      proxies as if they were causal variables but also\n      recommendations for policy decisions on the basis of such\n      interpretations. . . .\n\n\n      67\n       The State of Texas' expert in this case conceded that his\nintent in conducting a trivariate regression analysis \"was not\nfind out the precise reasons why a candidate won or lost.\" He\nfurther stated that, if he \"had tried to get involved in campaign\nexpenditures and incumbency, ratings by the Bar Association, it\nwould be an impossible task to do.\" See LULAC III, 986 F.2d at\n805.\n\n                                         183\n\f          Second, variables in nonexperimental research tend\n     to be intercorrelated.      Since more often than not\n     researchers neither understand the causes of the\n     interrelations nor attempt to study them, implications of\n     regression coefficients for policy decisions are\n     questionable.\n\nPEDHAZUR, supra, at 224.\n\n     Requiring        minority     plaintiffs         to    come   forward         with     a\n\nmultivariate     regression        analysis      to    determine       the     causes      of\n\nracially      divergent        voting    patterns,         as   Judge        Higginbotham\n\noriginally advocated in City of Lubbock, see supra Part I.A.1.a.,\n\nwould     implicate     the     second     problem         described     above.           The\n\nindependent     variables       listed     by    Judge      Higginbotham--including\n\nincumbency, campaign expenditures, party identification, income,\n\nmedia use measured by cost, religion--\"tend to be correlated,\n\nsometimes substantially.\"           PEDHAZUR, supra, at 224.            Therefore, \"it\n\n[becomes] difficult, if not impossible, to untangle the effects of\n\neach variable.\"       Id. By inferring causation from such analysis, we\n\nwould undoubtedly         be    engaging    in    what      amounts     to    an   \"almost\n\nmindless interpretation[] of regression analysis in nonexperimental\n\nresearch.\"      Id. at 223.        In short, we would be importing \"junk\n\nscience\" into the Voting Rights Act while rejecting it in other\n\ncontexts.68\n\n     68\n       Professor Bernard Grofman, of the University of\nCalifornia at Irvine, has recently commented on the pitfalls of\ndrawing conclusions about causation from multivariate analyses of\nvoting patterns. In an article appearing in Social Science\nQuarterly, Professor Grofman laments that \"[f]undamental flaws\nexist in most multivariate approaches to bloc voting analysis\nused to date.\" Bernard Grofman, Multivariate Methods & the\nAnalysis of Racially Polarized Voting: Pitfalls in the Use of\nSocial Science by the Courts, 72 SOC. SCI. Q. 826, 828 (1991).\nProfessor Grofman specifically criticizes the methodology used by\n\n                                           184\n\f       Requiring minority plaintiffs to only come forward with a\n\ntrivariate regression analysis, as the majority seems to do in this\n\ncase, does not alleviate the social science problems; it only\n\nmultiplies them.      Not only does such a requirement ignore the fact\n\nthat   the   two    independent    variables     (i.e.,   race   and   partisan\n\naffiliation) are substantially correlated, it also runs the risk\n\nthat the two variables being studied are only proxies for causal\n\nvariables    that    are   not   included   in   the   regression      equation.\n\nIndeed, the majority's position in this case directly conflicts\n\nwith Judge Higginbotham's statement in City of Lubbock, where he\n\ncriticized a bivariate regression analysis for \"ignor[ing] the\n\nreality that race or national origin may mask a host of other\n\nexplanatory variables.\"          730 F.2d at 235.      That is, a trivariate\n\nregression analysis such as the one now effectively required by the\n\n\n\nthe defendants' expert in McCord v. City of Fort Lauderdale, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"468226\"><a href=\"/opinion/468226/allie-k-mccord-v-city-of-fort-lauderdale-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">787</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1528</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, vacated, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"478827\"><a href=\"/opinion/478827/allie-k-mccord-v-city-of-fort-lauderdale-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">804</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">611</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir. 1986). This expert\ntestified that, because the race of the candidate was not\nsignificant in explaining election outcomes beyond what could be\naccounted for by other variables (such as incumbency, campaign\nexpenditures, newspaper endorsements, voter turnout, and the sex\nof the candidate), race was not really a factor in accounting for\nvoting patterns. See 787 F.2d at 829. According to Professor\nGrofman, the expert's interpretation of the voting statistics was\n\"simply wrong,\" because, among other things, \"there are so many\nother variables collinear with race used that they almost\ncertainly will reduce [the] significance of race in a\nmultivariate regression.\" Grofman, supra, at 830. Ultimately,\nProfessor Grofman concludes:\n\n       [A]s used so far by expert witnesses for defendants in\n       voting rights cases, multivariate regression methods\n       have produced misleading results about the levels of or\n       existence of racial bloc voting patterns, and have\n       served mainly to misuse statistics and confuse courts.\n\nId. at 832.\n\n                                      185\n\fmajority ignores the reality that race or partisanship \"may mask a\n\nhost of other explanatory variables.\"\n\n       The    trivariate       regression    analyses      offered    in    this    case\n\nundoubtedly demonstrate that the party affiliation of a candidate\n\nis a better predictor of electoral success than the race of the\n\ncandidate.         Because we are dealing with non-experimental research,\n\nhowever, I cannot take the leap that the majority makes--namely,\n\nthat the party affiliation of a candidate is the best, or the\n\nsingle most powerful, explanation of electoral success.                             The\n\nevidence in this case also demonstrates that, in many of the\n\ncounties, race is substantially correlated with party affiliation,\n\nand the trivariate regression analysis offered in this case did not\n\ndetermine, and could not have determined, why people join certain\n\nparties.      In my view, then, it can no more explain why people vote\n\nthe    way     they      do    than   a     bivariate      regression       analysis.\n\nSignificantly, for purposes of the Voting Rights Act, it could not\n\nnegate \"race or color\" as an explanation for election outcomes.\n\n                          (iii)    The practical problem\n\n       The majority's approach to legally significant white bloc\n\nvoting       and     racially     polarized       voting     places        an    almost\n\ninsurmountable hurdle in front of minority groups proceeding under\n\nsection 2.         Unless minority plaintiffs can successfully establish\n\nthat   voters       in   the   controlling      political    party    are       racially\n\nmotivated--either through the use of questionable voting statistics\n\nor by calling people from that party and asking them why they voted\n\n\n\n\n                                          186\n\fthe way they did69--their claim will fail.

Such\n     an affirmative showing can be made with evidence of\n     objective factors that, under the totality of the\n\n                               187\n\f      The typical section 2 vote dilution case--i.e., where a\n\ncertain electoral law, practice, or structure interacts with social\n\nand   historical    conditions   to    cause    an     inequality    in    the\n\nopportunities enjoyed by minority and white voters to elect their\n\npreferred   candidates--has   two     prominent   features:      One      is   a\n\npolitically cohesive minority group (e.g., blacks or Hispanics)\n\nwhose members share political interests and vote together, usually\n\nin a single political party that also includes whites.              The other\n\nis the existence of a white majority, generally in a different\n\npolitical party, whose voting strength is sufficient usually to\n\ndefeat   the   combined   strength     of   minority    votes   plus      white\n\n\"crossover\" votes.    The problem for minority voters in the typical\n\nsection 2 case is that they have been submerged in a white\n\nmajority--unable to forge a coalition with enough whites to elect\n\nrepresentatives of their choice.       Thus, the Voting Rights Act, as\n\ninterpreted in Gingles and succeeding cases, presupposes partisan\n\nvoting and asks whether politically cohesive minority voters have\n\n\n\n      circumstances, indicate that the voting community is\n      not driven by racial bias.\n\nId. (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added).\n     Even Judge Tjoflat recognizes the concept of racial bloc\nvoting does not contain any racial animus requirement. He notes:\n\n      I do not mean to imply that a defendant, by proving\n      absence of racial bias, can rebut a plaintiff's showing\n      of racial bloc voting. . . . Such evidence, however,\n      does not create an irrebuttable case of vote dilution--\n      it is irrebuttable proof of only one factor (albeit an\n      important factor) in the totality-of-the-circumstances\n      test.\n\nId. at 1035 n.12.\n\n                                     188\n\fan unequal opportunity to participate in the political process--a\n\npartisan political process--and to elect representatives of their\n\nchoice on account of race or color.\n\n     Under the majority's reasoning, this typical scenario, the\n\nscenario specifically contemplated by the Gingles framework, will\n\nnow preclude a finding of vote dilution.   As long as some whites\n\nvote with minorities in the Democratic Party, partisan affiliation\n\nwill always be a better predictor of election outcomes than race\n\n(even if a few minorities vote Republican).    Such circumstances,\n\nunder the majority's framework, will preclude a finding of vote\n\ndilution.   In short, the majority has effectively eviscerated\n\nsection 2 of the Voting Rights Act in communities where there is\n\nany measurable crossover voting by whites.71\n\n     In sum, in the context of a challenge to an at-large election\n\nscheme, there are two ways to view a politically cohesive minority\n\ngroup, which, despite the support of some whites, is consistently\n\n\n     71\n       The majority implies that interest group politics did not\nbegin in Texas until the 1980's, when the Republican Party\nemerged as a force to be reckoned with. The majority ignores\nthat, even when Texas was a one party state, there were still\ndifferent factions, or interest groups, within the Democratic\nparty. Thus, partisan or interest group politics has always been\na feature of Texas' colorful political landscape. To hold\notherwise is to ignore the past reality. As noted previously,\nthe evidence in this case reflects that, before 1980, minority-\npreferred candidates lost in Democratic primary elections,\ngenerally to white Democrats; after 1980, minority-preferred\ncandidates may make it to the general election, but only to lose\nto white Republicans. See LULAC III, 986 F.2d at 812 n.59.\n\"From the vantage point of minority voters--which is the vantage\npoint of section 2--it is difficult to see how the arrival of a\ntwo party system in Texas has altered their ability to\nparticipate in the political process and elect candidates of\ntheir choice.\" Id.\n\n                               189\n\funable to elect representatives of its choice.     I view it as one\n\nfactor suggesting vote dilution--i.e., that a minority group is\n\nsubmerged in a white majority and unable, despite the support of\n\nsome whites, to elect representatives of its choice.   The majority\n\ncalls this merely interest group politics.72   Of course, in calling\n\nthis interest group politics, the majority treats a racial or\n\nlanguage minority group as a mere \"interest group\" rather than as\n\na politically cohesive minority group striving to make its voice\n\nheard.\n\n          c.   A more reasonable approach to racial bloc voting,\n               causation, and voters' motivations\n\n     Rather than altering the section 2 framework and requiring\n\nminority plaintiffs to negate partisan politics (or perhaps to\n\nprove racial animus in the electorate) in order to make out a prima\n\nfacie case of vote dilution, I would adhere to the framework\n\nestablished by the language of section 2, as interpreted by the\n\nSupreme Court and this court.   To make out a prima facie case of\n\n     72\n       In support of its assertion that partisan politics, not\nrace, is responsible for the inability of blacks and Hispanics to\nparticipate in the political process and elect representatives of\ntheir choice, the majority notes that \"white Democrats have in\nrecent years experienced the same electoral defeats as minority\nvoters.\" Majority Opinion at 63. It then states:\n\n     If we are to hold that these losses at the polls,\n     without more, give rise to racial vote dilution\n     warranting special relief for minority voters, a\n     principle by which we might justify withholding similar\n     relief from white Democrats is not readily apparent.\n\nId. The simple answer to this concern about limiting the reach\nof section 2 is that, unlike the minorities in this case, whites\nare not politically cohesive. Thus, contrary to the majority's\nassertions, white Democrats would be no more able to obtain\nrelief under section 2 than would white Republicans.\n\n                                190\n\fvote dilution, a minority group would have to satisfy the Gingles\n\nthreshold inquiry by demonstrating:            (1) that it is sufficiently\n\nlarge and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a\n\nsingle-member district; (2) that it is politically cohesive; and\n\n(3) that the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable\n\nit--in the absence of special circumstances--usually to defeat the\n\nminority's preferred candidate.          Gingles, 478 U.S. at 48-51.    Once\n\nthe minority group satisfied the Gingles threshold inquiry, it\n\nwould have to put on evidence of the totality of the circumstances\n\nto   demonstrate:     (1)   that    it   has   an   unequal   opportunity   to\n\nparticipate in the political process and elect representatives of\n\nits choice, see 42 U.S.C. § 1973(b); and (2) that this unequal\n\nopportunity to participate and elect is tied to race or color, see\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973(a).    See also LULAC III, 986 F.2d at 754-55.\n\n      To satisfy the third Gingles threshold requirement--i.e.,\n\nlegally significant white bloc voting--I would not require minority\n\nplaintiffs to either negate partisan politics or prove racial\n\nanimus in the electorate.          Rather, as I explained in my earlier\n\nopinion, minority plaintiffs would have to demonstrate \"a white\n\nbloc vote that normally will defeat the combined strength of\n\nminority support plus white `crossover' votes.\"               LULAC III, 986\n\nF.2d at 745 (quoting Gingles, 478 U.S. at 56).                  This is not\n\nnecessarily an easy burden.          Minority plaintiffs would have to\n\ndemonstrate, with a fair degree of predictability, the white\n\nmajority's success.    See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 51.           They could not\n\n\n\n\n                                      191\n\frely on the loss of an occasional election to establish legally\n\nsignificant white bloc voting.    See id.\n\n     I would similarly look to objective factors in analyzing,\n\nunder the totality of the circumstances, \"the extent to which\n\nvoting in the elections of the state or political subdivision is\n\nracially polarized.\"    S. REP. at 29, 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 206.\n\nThat is, I reject the argument that \"racially polarized voting,\" as\n\nused in the Senate Report, means racially motivated voting or\n\nvoting caused by racial animus in the electorate.     See LULAC III,\n\n986 F.2d at 748.   For the reasons discussed above, I also reject\n\nthe majority's more strained, alternative interpretation of this\n\nrequirement--that racially polarized voting is voting not caused by\n\npartisan affiliation.    Finally, although I would hold that the\n\nelections most relevant to the racial bloc voting inquiry are those\n\nin which a minority candidate opposes a white candidate, I would\n\nnot characterize racially polarized voting as \"the tendency of\n\ncitizens to vote for candidates of their own race.\"   See id.   In my\n\nview, racially polarized voting is established when \"there is a\n\nconsistent relationship between [the] race of the voter and the way\n\nin which the voter votes, . . . or to put it differently, where\n\n[minority] voters and white voters vote differently.\" Gingles, 478\n\nU.S. at 53 n.21.\n\n     This is not to say that the causes of racially divergent\n\nvoting patterns, or voters' motivations, are irrelevant to the\n\nsection 2 inquiry.     Such causes are relevant to the white bloc\n\nvoting inquiry under the Gingles threshold test, but only to the\n\n\n                                 192\n\fextent that they call into question the consistency with which the\n\nwhite bloc will oppose minority-preferred candidates.     See LULAC\n\nIII, 986 F.2d at 745-46 n.6.73     The causes of racially divergent\n\nvoting patterns are also relevant to the totality of circumstances\n\ninquiry.    If it can be shown that white voters who consistently\n\nvote against minority-preferred candidates are motivated by racial\n\nanimus, such proof could be a signal of vote dilution.    See id. at\n\n753-54.    As Justice O'Connor explained in her Gingles concurrence,\n\nin \"a community that is polarized along racial lines, racial\n\nhostility\" may create even more of a barrier to participation in\n\nthe political process.    See 478 U.S. at 100 (emphasis added).   It\n\nmight, for example, affect the \"likelihood that candidates elected\n\nwithout decisive minority support would be willing to take the\n\nminority's interests into account.\"     Id.   For the same reasons,\n\nproof that the white voters are not motivated by racial animus\n\n     73\n       I therefore agree with Justice O'Connor's position on the\nextent to which explanations for racially divergent voting\npatterns are relevant to the white bloc voting inquiry. In\nGingles, she stated:\n\n     Evidence that a candidate preferred by the minority\n     group in a particular election was rejected by white\n     voters for reasons other than those which made that\n     candidate the preferred choice of the minority group\n     would seem clearly relevant in answering the question\n     whether bloc voting by white voters will consistently\n     defeat minority candidates. Such evidence would\n     suggest that another candidate, equally preferred by\n     the minority group, might be able to attract greater\n     white support in future elections.\n\n478 U.S. at 100 (emphasis added). As noted previously, see supra\nnote 3, I read this passage as saying that evidence of partisan\nvoting patterns that overlay racial bloc voting patterns would\nnot call into question the consistent defeat of minority-\npreferred candidates.\n\n                                 193\n\fwould also be relevant to the totality of circumstances inquiry.\n\nThe absence of proof of racial animus, however, should not weigh\n\nheavily against minority plaintiffs proceeding under section 2.\n\n\"[B]ecause overt political racism has decreased over time, racial\n\nanimus in the electorate may be difficult, if not impossible to\n\ndetect.\"       LULAC III, 986 F.2d at 754 (citing United States v.\n\nMarengo County Comm'n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"433870\"><a href=\"/opinion/433870/united-states-v-marengo-county-commission/\"><span class=\"volume\">731</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1546</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1571 (11th Cir.), cert.\n\ndenied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">976</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984)).\n\n     By refusing to make racial animus in the electorate the focus\n\nof the vote dilution inquiry, I am not attempting to sever section\n\n2 from its constitutional underpinnings.             Minority plaintiffs\n\nultimately have the burden, under the totality of circumstances\n\ninquiry, to demonstrate that their inability to participate in the\n\npolitical process and elect representatives of their choice is \"on\n\naccount of race or color.\"         See LULAC III, 986 F.2d at 754-55.\n\nThis inquiry is not a narrow one that focuses on the present\n\nmotivation of voters, but a blended one that focuses on the past\n\nand present reality of the local political landscape.             See S. REP.\n\nat 30, 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 208 Minority plaintiffs can meet this\n\nburden by demonstrating some mix of factors under the totality of\n\nthe circumstances--such as the existence of racially polarized\n\nvoting,    a   history   of   official    discrimination,   the    lingering\n\nsocioeconomic effects of discrimination, racial campaign appeals,\n\nand other features of the current or past racial climate.                See\n\nLULAC III, 986 F.2d at 755.\n\n\n\n\n                                    194\n\f       Unlike the majority, then, I cannot conclude that the district\n\ncourt clearly erred in finding legally significant white bloc\n\nvoting and racially polarized voting in Texas district court\n\nelections--at least with respect to eight of the nine counties at\n\nissue in this case.        The Plaintiffs offered evidence sufficient to\n\nsupport the district court's findings that the white bloc vote in\n\nBexar, Dallas, Ector, Harris, Jefferson, Lubbock, Midland, and\n\nTarrant counties will usually defeat the minority's preferred\n\ncandidate.       The Plaintiffs also offered substantial statistical\n\nevidence of racially polarized, or racially divergent, voting\n\npatterns.     The district court's findings with respect to these\n\nspecific inquiries are plausible in light of the record viewed as\n\na whole; therefore, they are not clearly erroneous.\n\n       Nor can I join the majority's conclusion that the district\n\ncourt, by stating that the causes of racially divergent voting\n\npatterns    are    irrelevant   to     the        section   2   inquiry,   committed\n\nreversible error.         The district court was, admittedly, wrong to\n\nsuggest     that    the   causes      of     racially       polarized   voting   are\n\nirrelevant; however, the evidence offered by the State of Texas in\n\nthis case concerning the causes of racially divergent voting\n\npatterns is insufficient, in my view, to negate or undercut the\n\ndistrict court's ultimate finding, in eight of the nine counties,\n\nthat    blacks     and    Hispanics        have    an   unequal    opportunity   to\n\nparticipate in the political process and elect representatives of\n\ntheir choice \"on account of race or color.\"                     See LULAC III, 986\n\nF.2d at 803-13.      The trivariate regression analyses offered by the\n\n\n                                           195\n\fState Defendants simply do not explain why people vote the way they\n\ndo.    Even under the majority's narrow view of the section 2\n\ninquiry, they do not negate \"race or color\" as an explanation for\n\nthe inability of minorities to elect representatives of their\n\nchoice.74   Moreover, as explained in LULAC III, uninformed and\n\nstraight-ticket voting along party lines can, and in this case\n\ndoes, reinforce minority voters' unequal access to the political\n\nprocess.    Id. at 812.\n\n      2.    Other Examples of Alterations in the Section 2 Inquiry\n\n      In its efforts to overhaul section 2, the majority does not\n\nstop at reformulating the white bloc voting and racially polarized\n\nvoting inquiries. It also changes--in some instances, sua sponte--\n\nthe rules with respect to several other specific inquiries under\n\nthe totality of the circumstances. In particular, the majority (a)\n\nnow uses the lingering socioeconomic effects of discrimination as\n\na factor arguing against a finding of vote dilution, (b) declares\n\nthat the history of official discrimination against blacks and\n\nHispanics is to be entitled to little weight, (c) makes certain\n\nfactors indicative of current racial bias \"particularly\" important\n\nunder the totality of circumstances inquiry, and (d) aggregates\n\nblacks and Hispanics in two of the counties, even though no one\n\nsought to do so in the district court.     By further altering the\n\nsection 2 framework, the majority can confidently conclude that the\n\nevidence of vote dilution in this case is \"weak.\"\n\n      74\n        This evidence would also, therefore, be insufficient to\nestablish a \"no racial bias\" affirmative defense, as advocated by\nChief Judge Tjoflat of the Eleventh Circuit. See supra note 8.\n\n                                 196\n\f           a.    Lingering socioeconomic effects of discrimination:\n                 the paucity of minority lawyers\n\n     The majority concludes that the Plaintiffs' vote dilution case\n\nin each of the counties is weakened by the indisputable fact that,\n\nin all of the counties, the percentage of minority lawyers is much\n\nsmaller than the percentage of minority voters. The appalling lack\n\nof minority judges on the Texas district court bench does not point\n\ntowards vote dilution, we are told, because \"[t]he absence of\n\neligible candidates goes a long way in explaining the absence of\n\nminority judges.\"    Majority Opinion at 76.    Indeed, the majority\n\nproclaims that minorities are overrepresented on the district court\n\nbench.    It argues, on the one hand, that the Voting Rights Act is\n\n\"not an unbridled license--to explore for example the persistent\n\nlow enrollment of black law students.\"         Id. at 146.   It then\n\nsuggests, however, that blacks are somehow responsible for their\n\nown plight--i.e., for their persistent low enrollment in law\n\nschool.   See id. at 146-47.75\n\n     I cannot agree with the majority that the lack or absence of\n\nminority lawyers undercuts the Plaintiffs' vote dilution case.\n\nFirst, in assessing the extent to which minority candidates have\n\nbeen elected to public office, the appropriate comparison pool has\n\nalways been the number of minorities in the population. See 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1973(b) (\"The extent to which members of a protected class\n\n     75\n       I am referring specifically to the majority's decision to\nexplore low black enrollment at Louisiana State University Law\nSchool. This \"example\" has about as much to do with this case as\ndoes George Wallace's decision to crown a black homecoming queen\nat halftime of a football game at the University of Alabama. See\nLULAC III, 986 F.2d at 819 (Higginbotham, J., dissenting).\n\n                                 197\n\fhave been elected to office in the State or political subdivision\n\nis one circumstance which may be considered:               Provided, That\n\nnothing in this section establishes a right to have members of a\n\nprotected   class   in   numbers   equal   to   their   proportion   in   the\n\npopulation); see also LULAC III, 986 F.2d at 750-52.76          Second, in\n\nmost of the counties at issue in this case, there are numerous\n\nminority lawyers who are well-qualified for the job of Texas\n\ndistrict court judge.        According to the State of Texas' own\n\nexhibits, there are hundreds of eligible minority lawyers in Bexar\n\n(317 eligible Hispanics), Dallas (184 eligible blacks), and Harris\n\ncounties (446 eligible blacks). There are also significant numbers\n\nof minority lawyers in several of the other counties.                As the\n\ndistrict court correctly found, \"even if there is some relationship\n\nbetween the low number of minority judges and the number of\n\neligible minority lawyers, that fact does not explain why well\n\nqualified eligible minority lawyers lose judicial elections.\"\n\n\n\n\n     76\n       As the Houston Lawyers' Association noted at oral\nargument, the Voting Rights Act is not about equal employment\nopportunities; it is about the equal opportunity of voters to\nparticipate in the political process and elect representatives of\ntheir choice. In this regard, it is interesting to note that the\nmajority, in proclaiming that minorities are overrepresented on\nthe district court bench, frequently considers minority judges\nwho were not minority-preferred candidates. In Dallas County,\nfor example, the majority recites that five of the thirty-six\ndistrict judges are black. What the majority does not say is\nthat the two black judges who won partisan elections were not\neven the preferred candidates of the black community. The\nmajority also ignores the fact that, at the time of trial in\nDallas County, no black candidate with the support of the black\ncommunity had ever won a contested election for district judge.\nSee LULAC III, 986 F.2d at 785.\n\n                                    198\n\f     Even more inexcusable, however, is the majority's refusal to\n\nrecognize that the comparative lack of minority lawyers constitutes\n\nevidence of the lingering socioeconomic effects of discrimination,\n\nwhich argues in favor of a vote dilution finding.            The Senate\n\nReport accompanying the amended section 2 instructs courts to\n\nconsider \"the extent to which members of the minority group in the\n\nstate or political subdivision bear the effects of discrimination\n\nin such areas as education, employment, and health, which hinder\n\ntheir ability to participate effectively in the political process.\"\n\nS. REP. at 29, 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 206.    The majority recognizes,\n\nas it must, that no one has \"questioned [P]laintiffs' assertion\n\nthat disparities between white and minority residents in several\n\nsocioeconomic categories are the tragic legacies of the State's\n\ndiscriminatory practices.\" Majority Opinion at 77. The Plaintiffs\n\nintroduced exhibits in each of the counties showing that minorities\n\nlag unreasonably behind whites in terms of income, education, and\n\nemployment.    Along these lines, it cannot seriously be disputed\n\nthat the lack of eligible minority lawyers is in no small part the\n\nresult    of   past   racial   discrimination   in   Texas    schools--\n\ndiscrimination that remains unremedied in some cases even to this\n\nday.77\n\n     77\n        For most of its history, Texas has maintained--at all\nlevels--a racially discriminatory education system.

One aspect of the ability to participate in the\n\npolitical process must surely include the ability to run for the\n\noffice, and as long as minorities continue to bear the effects of\n\npast discrimination in education and employment, their ability to\n\nparticipate in the Texas district court political process will be\n\nseverely hindered.         See TEX. CONST. art. V, § 7 (establishing\n\neligibility requirements for district court judges).\n\n     Thus, like the majority, I would hold that the relative lack\n\nof eligible minority candidates is relevant to the section 2\n\ninquiry.        Unlike the majority, however, this indisputable fact\n\nwould     not   argue   against   a   finding   of   dilution;    it   would   be\n\ncompelling evidence of the extent to which blacks and Hispanics\n\ncontinue to \"bear the effects of discrimination in such areas as\n\neducation [and] employment, . . . which hinder their ability to\n\nparticipate effectively in the political process.\"               S.

The majority, after\nweighing this evidence with other evidence suggesting that\nminorities were able to raise funds, finds that minorities were\nable to run well-financed campaigns. It thus concludes that the\ntestimony from several witnesses about minority candidates' lack\nof financial resources does not support the district court's\nfinding that the lingering socioeconomic effects of\ndiscrimination hinder the ability of minorities to participate\neffectively in district court elections. I disagree. In my\nview, the testimony of these witnesses, as well as Dr.\nBrischetto's expert testimony on the subject, provide further\n\n                                       202\n\f             b.

However,   in    discussing    the   totality     of    the\n\ncircumstances in its application of the law to each county, the\n\nmajority brushes over this history as if it were somehow irrelevant\n\nto the section 2 inquiry.            I cannot join this decision to amend\n\nsection 2.\n\n      The Senate Report specifically instructs courts to consider,\n\nas an independent factor under the totality of the circumstances,\n\n\"the extent of any history of official discrimination in the state\n\nor political subdivision that touched the right of the members of\n\nthe   minority      group     to   register,    to     vote,   or     otherwise    to\n\nparticipate in the political process.\"                   S. REP. at 28, 1982\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 206.         By including this factor as a signal of vote\n\ndilution, Congress made a legislative decision, which we must\n\n\n\nsupport for the district court's finding in this regard.\n     Moreover, as I noted in my earlier opinion, the issue of\nwhether blacks and Hispanics continue to suffer the effects of\ndiscrimination--effects that hinder their ability to participate\nin the political process--was not a contested issue at trial and\nhas not been pursued by the parties on appeal. See LULAC III,\n986 F.2d at 782-83 n.41. The majority's decision to pursue this\nissue and reverse the district court's finding on clearly\nerroneous grounds is, thus, a further indication of its\ninsistence on cleaning up--or cleaning out--section 2.\n\n                                          203\n\frespect, that evidence of past discrimination--even standing alone-\n\n-is a   factor   pointing   toward    vote       dilution   under   section   2.\n\nIndeed, in amending section 2 and enacting the results test,\n\nCongress intended to remedy past discrimination.                  It expressly\n\nfound   \"that    voting     practices       and     procedures      that   have\n\ndiscriminatory results perpetuate the effects of past purposeful\n\ndiscrimination.\"    Id. at 40, 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 218 (emphasis\n\nadded). The majority effectively ignores this legislative decision\n\nby requiring Plaintiffs to demonstrate that the effects of past\n\ndiscrimination   \"actually    hamper       the   ability    of   minorities   to\n\nparticipate.\"    Majority Opinion at 77.\n\n     The majority thus attempts, in the words of Charles Black,\n\nJr., to \"uncouple present from past.\"             Charles L. Black, Jr., And\n\nOur Posterity, 102 YALE L. J. 1527, 1529 (1993). As Professor Black\n\naptly observes, however,\n\n          This disconnection of present from past . . . cannot\n     be made to seem successful today, any more than in 1883.\n     American slavery lasted more than two centuries, not too\n     far from twice the time since its abolition.         Even\n     abolition was not the end. Quite soon after the Civil\n     War, the national effort to remedy the situation of the\n     newly free was as good as abandoned; in the places where\n     most of them lived they were not even so much as allowed\n     to vote in the only election that counted; per capita\n     public expenditures in public schools for their children\n     ran far below--sometimes by a factor of one to ten--\n     expenditure in white schools. The paradox of \"separate\n     but equal,\" improvised--like the white primary--with a\n     broad knowing wink, not only imprisoned black people in\n     these schools, but also cut off all black people,\n     children and grown-ups, from any kind of equal\n     participation in the common life of the community.\n\nId. at 1529-30; see also supra note 15.\n\n\n\n\n                                     204\n\f     The simple fact is that blacks and Hispanics in Texas have\n\nindisputably been the victims of official discrimination in all\n\nareas of life. The district court was warranted in taking judicial\n\nnotice of this history, and in giving it weight in deciding whether\n\nthe Plaintiffs demonstrated an inability to participate in the\n\npolitical process and elect representatives of their choice \"on\n\naccount of race or color.\"   For the majority to suggest otherwise\n\nis to \"publish a general Act of Oblivion.\"    Black, supra, at 1530.\n\nI will not join such an act.\n\n          c.   The elevation of several factors under the totality\n               of circumstances inquiry\n\n     The majority further reveals its intent to shift the focus of\n\nthe section 2 inquiry by elevating certain factors under the\n\ntotality of the circumstances.   In particular, the majority states\n\nthat, in determining the strength of a vote dilution case, courts\n\nmust consider, among other things:     the willingness of the racial\n\nor ethnic majority to give their votes to minority candidates of\n\ntheir own party; whether the minority plaintiffs have found proof\n\nof racial campaign appeals; and whether elected officials were\n\nfound to be non-responsive to the needs of minority voters.\n\n     These factors are undoubtedly relevant to the section 2\n\ninquiry, but to elevate them, as the majority does, changes the\n\nfocus of the analytical framework. All of them--the willingness of\n\nwhite voters to vote for minority candidates of their own race,80\n\n     80\n       In reversing the district court's findings of vote\ndilution, the majority places heavy emphasis on the fact that, in\nseveral of the counties, white majorities voted for Republican\nminority judicial candidates. It also creates the impression\n\n                                 205\n\fthe existence of racial campaign appeals, and the responsiveness of\n\nelected officials--are concerned primarily with current racial\n\nanimus in either the electorate, in candidates, or in elected\n\nofficials.     In my view, current racial hostility is not the\n\nultimate focus of section 2.    See supra Part I.A.1.c.\n\n       Moreover,   elevating   these   factors   ignores   Congress'\n\ninstructions in the Senate Report that \"there is no requirement\n\nthat any particular number of factors be proved, or that a majority\n\npoint one way or the other.\"    S. REP. at 29, 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at\n\n207.   In particular, it ignores the statement in the Senate Report\n\nthat \"[u]nresponsiveness is not an essential part of plaintiff's\n\ncase.\").     Id. at 29 n.116; 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 207; see also\n\n\nthat the Republican Party aggressively recruited minority\ncandidates in all of the counties at issue. Majority Opinion at\n63. This picture is not entirely accurate.\n     While there was evidence in Dallas County that two black\nRepublican district court candidates were elected with the\nsupport of the white majority, there was also expert testimony,\nbased on a telephone survey, that most voters in Dallas County\nhad absolutely no idea of the race of the candidate for whom they\nwere voting. At most, then, this evidence shows that white\nvoters in Dallas County could not have been motivated by specific\nracial animus toward candidates. But this is only because of the\nso-called anonymity factor. There was also, admittedly, evidence\nsuggesting that the Republican Party in Dallas County attempted\nto recruit minority candidates.\n     As for the other counties, however, there is little, if any\nevidence that white majorities would support Republican minority\ncandidates in district court elections. This is because, as best\nI can tell from the record: (1) in Harris County, only one black\nRepublican district court candidate won a contested district\ncourt election; (2) in Bexar County, only one Hispanic Republican\nwon a contested district court election; and (3) in Tarrant\nCounty, only one black Republican won a contested district court\nelection. This lack of Republican minority district court\ncandidates also calls into question the majority's assertion that\nthe Republican Party actively recruited minority candidates in\nother counties. There is very little evidence of any such\nrecruitment in counties other than Dallas.\n\n                                 206\n\fUnited States v. Marengo County Comm'n, 731 F.2d at 1571 (The\n\nabsence of racial campaign appeals \"should not weigh heavily\n\nagainst a plaintiff proceeding under the results test of section\n\n2.\"). Unlike the majority, then, I would not elevate these factors\n\nunder the section 2 inquiry.\n\n          d.    Forcing minority groups to proceed as a coalition\n\n     Finally, the majority demonstrates the extent to which it will\n\ngo to overhaul section 2 (and to preserve Texas' method for\n\nelecting district court judges) by holding that the district court\n\nclearly erred   in   refusing   to    give   equal   weight   to   elections\n\ninvolving whites and Hispanics in Harris and Tarrant counties.           In\n\nboth of these counties, Plaintiffs proceeded only on behalf of\n\nblack voters.   The majority, noting that political cohesion is a\n\n\"question of fact\" and not a strategic card, makes a finding of\n\nfact on appeal that blacks and Hispanics in these two counties are\n\npolitically cohesive.   It makes this fact finding even though the\n\nparties never requested the district court to do so.81\n\n     81\n       Indeed, as I noted in my earlier opinion in this case,\nwith respect to Harris County, the parties specifically argued in\nthe district court (and requested a fact finding) that \"Blacks\nand Hispanics together in Harris County do not constitute a\npolitically cohesive minority group.\" See LULAC III, 986 F.2d at\n789. And in Tarrant County, no party ever requested a fact\nfinding that blacks and Hispanics are politically cohesive. See\nid. at 799-800 n.49.\n     The majority asserts that the parties' failure to request a\nfinding on the question of whether blacks and Hispanics in Harris\nand Tarrant counties is beside the point. It argues that the\nclaim raised on appeal is that the district court improperly\nrefused to consider elections involving Hispanic candidates,\nelections studied by the State of Texas' own expert. This latter\nquestion, the majority asserts, \"is most assuredly before\" this\ncourt. I disagree.\n     The State of Texas, in a reply brief to the original panel\n\n                                     207\n\f     By making this finding, the majority shows a complete lack of\n\njudicial restraint.    Regardless of what one thinks about allowing\n\nvarious minority groups to voluntarily combine themselves for\n\nsection 2 purposes,82 it is clear that, if such coalition minority\n\ngroups are permitted, \"proof of minority political cohesion is all\n\nthe more essential.\"    Growe v. Emison, 113 S. Ct. at 1085.   In my\n\nview, it is not within the power of a federal appellate court to\n\nmake this fact finding--especially where none was requested below.\n\n\nthat heard this case in 1990, raised this issue for the first\ntime on appeal. It asserted:\n\n     If [a coalition of blacks and Hispanics] can be proved\n     by voting rights plaintiffs in order to help them meet\n     the first two Gingles preconditions, what prevents\n     voting rights defendants from proving the existence of\n     such a de facto coalition in order to shed light on\n     whether the third Gingles precondition can be met? The\n     district court denied the State Officials that\n     opportunity in the targeted counties, including Harris\n     and Tarrant Counties, by treating as irrelevant the\n     numerous races analyzed there involving Anglo judicial\n     candidates versus Hispanic judicial candidates . . . .\n\nThus, the defendants \"raised\" this issue by asking a rhetorical\nquestion in a reply brief. Even if there were nothing to prevent\nvoting rights defendants from proving the existence of a de facto\ncoalition between blacks and Hispanics in Harris and Tarrant\ncounties, the problem with the argument is that the State of\nTexas simply did not seek to prove this fact in front of the\ndistrict court and, with regard to Harris County, expressly\nrequested a fact finding to the contrary.\n     82\n       The majority curiously does not feel the need to revisit\nour decision in Campos v.

The Result of the Majority's Handiwork\n\n     In sum, I reject the majority's characterization of the\n\nevidence of vote dilution offered in this case.           It can only be\n\ncharacterized as weak by altering the section 2 inquiry, which the\n\nmajority does freely.      No longer is the inquiry a blended one,\n\nwhich looks to the past and present reality of the local political\n\nlandscape.    It is now a selective inquiry into the present.             I\n\ncannot join this restructuring of the section 2 inquiry.\n\nB.   The Weight of the State of Texas' Interest in Maintaining the\n     Current Electoral System\n\n     Nor can I join the majority in its conclusion that the State\n\nof Texas' interest in maintaining its current system--specifically,\n\nits interest in linking electoral base to \"primary jurisdiction\"--\n\nis substantial enough to outweigh the Plaintiffs' proof of vote\n\ndilution.    This interest is little more than tenuous and could not\n\noutweigh even weak evidence of vote dilution.\n\n     The majority argues that Texas links the primary jurisdiction\n\nof its district courts with their electoral base in order to\n\npreserve the values of independence and accountability.             This so-\n\ncalled linkage interest, we are told, is substantial, because it\n\nrepresents the State of Texas' decision about what constitutes a\n\nstate district judge.       According to the majority, by linking\n\ndistrict    judges'   electoral   base   with   their   area   of   primary\n\njurisdiction, the State of Texas has made a decision similar to the\n\nState of Missouri's decision in Gregory v.

First, I remain unconvinced that Texas insists on\n\nlinking \"primary jurisdiction\" with electoral base. Also, there is\n\na   serious     question   as   to    whether      this   linking    of   primary\n\njurisdiction with electoral base actually promotes the values of\n\nindependence and accountability.           Finally, Texas' linkage interest\n\ncan be equally served by other means, means that would not dilute\n\nminority voting strength. Once these analytical flaws are exposed,\n\nit becomes clear that Texas' decision to link electoral base with\n\nprimary    jurisdiction    is   not   at     all   comparable   to   Missouri's\n\ndecision in Gregory to have age limits for its trial judges.\n\n      1.      Questioning Texas' Insistence on Linkage\n\n      The majority concludes that the State of Texas does in fact\n\nlink the primary jurisdiction of state district court judges with\n\ntheir electoral base.      In doing so, it ignores that the concept of\n\n\"primary jurisdiction\" is found nowhere in Texas law.                     It also\n\n\n\n\n      83\n        Before the Supreme Court's decision in Houston Lawyers'\nAssociation v.

Although I have some questions as to whether the\nCourt, in Houston Lawyers' Association, meant to change the\ninquiry and require proven vote dilution to be balanced against\nnon-tenuous state interests, see LULAC III, 986 F.2d at 757-64, I\nrecognize that the Court's opinion in that case can be read to\nrequire such balancing. See also Robert B. McDuff, Judicial\nElections and the Voting Rights Act, 38 LOY. L.

See LULAC III, 986 F.2d at 767; see also McDuff, supra\n\nnote 21, at 956-57.        They may have primary venue responsibility\n\nthat coincides with county lines, but a state district judge has\n\nstate-wide jurisdiction.        See TEX. CONST. art. V, § 8.     For example,\n\na state district judge elected only by the voters of Travis County\n\nhas the power to declare unconstitutional the entire state's method\n\nof financing public schools.

Thus, it is misleading for the majority to insist that\n\nTexas links the \"primary jurisdiction\" of district court judges\n\nwith their electoral base.        Indeed, the very opposite is the case:\n\na Texas district judge's jurisdiction extends far beyond his or her\n\nelectoral base.       The majority is saying no more than that Texas'\n\nelectoral districts, which are no smaller than a county, usually\n\ncoincide with the venue unit under Texas law, which is also the\n\ncounty.\n\n     Moreover, Texas does not insist that its district judges be\n\nelected from an area no smaller than a county.                Since 1985, the\n\nTexas Constitution has specifically authorized the voters of a\n\ncounty to decide to elect their district judges from an area\n\nsmaller than a county.          See TEX. CONST. art. V, §§ 7, 7a.        Texas\n\nalso makes extensive use of visiting and retired judges, thus\n\n\n                                        211\n\findicating its willingness to use judges who either were not\n\nelected at all or whose electoral base is not at all linked to some\n\namorphous concept of \"primary jurisdiction.\"         See LULAC III, 986\n\nF.2d at 768.   Also relevant in this regard is the State of Texas'\n\nwillingness to settle this lawsuit, which is discussed more fully\n\nin Part II infra.    The Governor, the Attorney General, and the\n\nelected representatives    of   the   people   of   the   state   have   all\n\nexpressed approval of a settlement calling for the election of\n\ndistrict judges from areas that are smaller than a county.           These\n\nrecent events undoubtedly call into question the State of Texas'\n\ninsistence on linkage.\n\n     2.   Questioning the Value of Linkage\n\n     Even if the State of Texas did consistently link a district\n\njudge's electoral base with venue, there is a serious question as\n\nto whether such insistence on linkage would in fact advance Texas'\n\ninterests in judicial accountability and independence. The reality\n\nis that Texas's venue rules do not, and were not meant to, ensure\n\nthe accountability of judges.      Moreover, there are flaws in the\n\nassumptions underlying majority's assertion that linkage serves to\n\nadvance the independence and fairness of district judges.\n\n     I do not see, and the majority does not explain, how linking\n\nelectoral base with venue advances the State of Texas' interest in\n\njudicial accountability.   If linkage did advance such an interest,\n\none might expect the state's venue rules to reflect this purpose.\n\nAs previously noted, however,\n\n     The Texas venue rules have not been drafted to insure\n     that parties appear before judges for whom they have had\n\n                                  212\n\f       an opportunity to vote. Instead, the venue rules for\n       lawsuits involving living persons. . . \"were, in the\n       main,   manifestly    adopted   to    prevent   serious\n       inconveniences and probable injury to defendants. . . .\n       Snyder v.

Moreover, given the unusually large\n\nsize of the election districts in several of the counties at issue\n\nin this case, it strains credibility to maintain that linkage\n\nadvances the state's interest in judicial accountability.                           As\n\nseveral of the defense witnesses at trial testified, most people\n\nhave   no    idea   of   who    they    are     voting    for   in   district   court\n\nelections.        These observations suggest that linkage in the large\n\ncounties at issue in this case, rather than advancing the value of\n\njudicial accountability, actually detracts from it.                   See also H.J.\n\nof TEX, 73d Leg., R.S. 479, 482 (1993) (Address of Chief Justice\n\nThomas R. Phillips) (arguing that retention elections should be\n\nused to enhance the accountability of judges and suggesting that,\n\nunder the current system, \"the people have no meaningful vote\").\n\n       As for the State of Texas' interest in judicial independence,\n\nlinkage advances it, if at all, only marginally.                       What ensures\n\njudicial independence are the integrity of individual judges and\n\nthe Texas Code of Judicial Conduct, which directs judges not to be\n\nswayed      \"by   partisan      interests,       public    clamor,     or   fear   of\n\ncriticism.\"       TEX. CODE    OF   JUDICIAL CONDUCT, Canon 3, pt. A(1).           The\n\nargument that linkage advances the State of Texas' interest in\n\njudicial independence is, at bottom, a smokescreen:                     It suggests\n\nthat district judges who are currently elected by white majorities,\n\noften with the substantial support of plaintiffs' lawyers, defense\n\n                                          213\n\flawyers, or some other interest group, are responsive to the needs\n\nof all voters in the county--including minority voters.                 Yet it\n\nassumes that a judge elected from a majority-minority district\n\nwould somehow be less willing to follow his or her oath or to be\n\nresponsive to the needs of all.         There is absolutely no evidence in\n\nthe record to support such an assumption.              See also McDuff, supra\n\nnote 21, at 949 (\"Of course, absolutely no reason exists to believe\n\nthat black judges elected from majority black districts or Hispanic\n\njudges elected from majority Hispanic districts will be any more\n\n`partisan advocates' than the white judges presently elected from\n\nmajority white districts.\").\n\n     3.        The Existence of Less Intrusive Means\n\n     Finally, Texas' linkage interest is weakened by the existence\n\nof less intrusive means.           I am referring specifically to the\n\npossible use of limited or cumulative voting.                   Both of these\n\nmethods of election would preserve the link, to the extent there is\n\nany, between a district judge's electoral base and his or her area\n\nof primary venue responsibility.          It would also serve, at least to\n\nthe same extent as the current method of electing judges, Texas'\n\ninterests in having accountable and independent judges.\n\n     The majority's refuses to consider cumulative and limited\n\nvoting    as    a   less   intrusive   means.     It   argues   that,   because\n\n\"[l]imited and cumulative voting are election mechanisms that\n\npreserve at-large elections,\" they \"are not `remedies' for the\n\nparticular structural problem that the plaintiffs have chosen to\n\nattack.\"       Majority Opinion at 103.         Thus, the majority decides,\n\n\n                                       214\n\f\"[w]e will not discount [the state's] interest based upon purported\n\nremedies that preserve the challenged at-large scheme.\"              Id.\n\n     The majority misses the point.         The Plaintiffs in this case\n\nallege that Texas' current method of electing district judges in\n\ncounty-wide elections dilutes their voting strength.            Contrary to\n\nthe majority's      hypertechnical    argument,   cumulative    or    limited\n\nvoting would remove the dilutive aspect of the current at-large\n\nsystem, which is what the Plaintiffs are challenging.                That it\n\nwould     also   preserve   county-wide    elections   merely    serves    to\n\ndemonstrate that it is a less intrusive means for advancing Texas'\n\nasserted interests. The majority's refusal to consider these other\n\nmeans, in determining the weight of the state's interests, is\n\nindefensible.84\n\n     4.      The Nature of Texas' Linkage Interest\n\n     Contrary to the majority's assertions, Texas' interest in\n\nlinking the electoral base of its judges with venue is not a\n\ndecision about what constitutes a state district court judge;\n\nindeed, it is nothing more than a decision about how to elect\n\ndistrict court judges.        The state's insistence on linking the\n\nelectoral base of district judges with their area of primary venue\n\n\n     84\n       Even Chief Justice Phillips has publicly recognized that\na system using limited and cumulative voting could remedy the\ndilutive aspect of Texas' current at-large election system. In\nhis recent State of the Judiciary Address, he noted that\n\"[m]inority voters could be protected by any method which permits\nvotes to be aggregated or limits each voter to fewer votes than\nthe number of positions to be filled.\" H.J. OF TEX., 73d Leg.,\nR.S. 479, 483 (1993). He further stated that, \"[w]hile little\nused in judicial elections, such procedures have long been used\nin both public and private elections around the world.\" Id.\n\n                                     215\n\fresponsibility has, in recent years and recent weeks, almost\n\nevaporated, and there are serious doubts as to whether linkage in\n\nfact    advances    the     values     of    judicial    accountability      and\n\nindependence.      Further, there are other means to preserve the so-\n\ncalled linkage interest.        Unlike the majority, then, I cannot say\n\nthat the State of Texas' interest in linkage--which is simply a\n\nshort-hand way of referring to its interest in maintaining the\n\nstatus quo--is anything like Missouri's decision in Gregory about\n\nthe qualifications of a state judge.\n\n       I would therefore hold that the state's interest in linking\n\nthe    electoral   base    of   its    judges   with    their   primary    venue\n\nresponsibility,     allegedly     to   foster   judicial    independence     and\n\naccountability, is little more than tenuous. At best, the argument\n\nis about appearances.       At worst, it exhibits an unfounded fear of\n\nhaving judges elected from majority-minority districts.                   In any\n\nevent, the majority's conclusion that this interest is substantial\n\nis not founded in the record, in Texas law, or in reality.                    It\n\ncould not outweigh the evidence of vote dilution in this case even\n\nif that evidence were only weak, which it manifestly is not.\n\n\n\n                          II.   THE MOTION TO REMAND\n\n       Given the majority's misguided and destructive efforts on the\n\nmerits of this case, one might reasonably ask why the Plaintiffs\n\nand the State of Texas, acting through its Attorney General, were\n\nnot given the opportunity to settle this dispute.                The majority\n\noffers three reasons: First, the majority suggests that the motion\n\n\n                                       216\n\fto remand should be denied because the Texas Attorney General is\n\nsomehow acting beyond the scope of his authority.      The majority\n\nalso makes a related argument that the motion must be denied\n\nbecause not all of the \"defendants\" have consented to the remand or\n\nto the proposed settlement.     Finally, the majority declines to\n\nremand for a hearing on the proposed settlement on the ground that\n\nthe settlement is inconsistent with state law.\n\n     As explained below, none of the reasons proffered by the\n\nmajority precludes a remand for purposes of conducting a settlement\n\nhearing.   That is, the majority could have easily remanded this\n\ncase, but chose not to because it wanted to reach the merits of\n\nthis case and overhaul the Voting Rights Act.      I cannot embrace\n\nsuch reasoning.\n\nA.   Does the Attorney General Have the Authority to Settle this\n     Lawsuit?\n\n     In suggesting that the Texas Attorney General is acting beyond\n\nthe scope of his authority by agreeing to the proposed settlement\n\nand requesting a remand, the majority misperceives the nature of\n\nthe Attorney General's status in this lawsuit.        That is, the\n\nmajority treats the Attorney General as just another lawyer who is\n\nrepresenting the various officials named as defendants.         The\n\nAttorney General, however, is not just another lawyer; he is also\n\na named defendant, as well as the chief legal officer for the State\n\nof Texas in this litigation.   As such, he had the power under Texas\n\nlaw to negotiate and execute the proposed settlement and to request\n\na remand of this case.\n\n\n\n                                 217\n\f     1.   The Nature of this Lawsuit\n\n     The majority correctly notes that the Plaintiffs in this case\n\nfiled suit   against   the   Attorney   General   of   Texas,   the   Texas\n\nSecretary of State, and the members of the Texas Judicial Districts\n\nBoard (including the Board's chairman, Chief Justice Phillips).\n\nThese defendants were not named in their individual capacities, but\n\nonly in their official capacities.      The Plaintiffs were apparently\n\nrequired to do this under the Supreme Court's Eleventh Amendment\n\njurisprudence--specifically, under the fiction of Ex Parte Young,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96819\"><a href=\"/opinion/96819/ex-parte-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1908), which holds that a suit for declaratory and\n\ninjunctive relief against state officers does not constitute a suit\n\nagainst the state for Eleventh Amendment immunity purposes.85\n\n     85\n       The general rule is that, for purposes of determining\nwhether a suit in federal court is barred by the Eleventh\nAmendment, an official-capacity lawsuit is a suit against the\nstate itself rather than a suit against the named official.

At oral argument, when he was specifically asked whether\nhe was seeking to represent the state on appeal from the\nliability decision, Chief Justice Phillips said that he was not.\nThat is, he made it clear that his complaints go only to the\nspecifics of the proposed settlement--not to the idea of settling\nthis case in general. Indeed, in a speech to the Texas\nlegislature, Chief Justice Phillips conceded that, regardless of\nthe outcome in this litigation, the current system of electing\ndistrict judges is indefensible. He explained:\n\n     Let there be no mistake: the current at-large system\n     is no longer acceptable. In Dallas County, 37% of the\n     people, but less than 14% of the judges, are African-\n     American or Hispanic. In Harris County, 42% of the\n     people, but less than 9% of the judges, are from the\n     same minority populations. Candidates from these\n     racial and ethnic groups have often been defeated in\n     campaigns for benches in those counties. The federal\n     courts may ultimately hold that the evidence presented\n     in pending litigation is insufficient to demonstrate\n     that the system is illegal, but they cannot make it\n     fair or right. The status quo is unjust and\n     inequitable.\n\nH.J. OF TEX., 73d Leg., R.S. 479, 482 (1993) (Address of Chief\nJustice Thomas R. Phillips); see also id. at 481 (\"One thing can\nbe said with confidence about our current system of choosing\njudges: No one likes it.\").\n\n\n\n                                   223\n\f(1986), where we permitted a state district attorney to represent\n\nthe State of Texas' interests on appeal after the Attorney General\n\ndeclined to do so.\n\n       The majority's reliance on Baker is wholly misplaced.                   In\n\nallowing a state district attorney to intervene on appeal and\n\ndefend    the    constitutionality   of    Texas'    sodomy      statute,   Judge\n\nReavley emphasized the narrowness of the decision.                    Among other\n\nthings, he noted that, \"as of the date of the entry of the district\n\ncourt's judgment, [the state district attorney] was a member of the\n\n[defendant] class, was enjoined by that judgment, and as district\n\nattorney was a proper official under Texas law to represent the\n\nstate.\"    Id.    at 291 (emphasis added) (citing TEX. CONST. art. V, §\n\n21).     In this case, by contrast, Chief Justice Phillips is not a\n\nproper official under Texas law to represent the state.                   Indeed,\n\nthe majority has pointed to no provision of Texas law, and I can\n\nfind none, that would even arguably allow the members of the Texas\n\nJudicial Districts board to represent the interests of the state in\n\nlitigation.\n\n       Thus, our decision in Baker is consistent with Texas law,\n\nwhich provides that \"either the Attorney General or a county or\n\ndistrict    attorney    may   represent     the     State   in    a    particular\n\nsituation.\"      See Hill v. Texas Water Quality Board, 568 S.W.2d at\n\n741.     The majority opinion, on the other hand, ignores Texas law\n\nwhen it refuses to recognize that \"these are the only choices.\" Id.\n\nUnlike the majority, then, I would hold that the Attorney General\n\n\n\n\n                                     224\n\fhas the exclusive authority to represent the interests of the state\n\nin this litigation.\n\n       3.   The Attorney General's Power to Settle on Behalf of the\n            State\n\n       The majority's failure to perceive the nature of this lawsuit,\n\nas well as its failure to understand the broad and exclusive powers\n\nof the Texas Attorney General, ultimately leads it to suggest that\n\nthe Attorney General in this case has acted beyond his authority in\n\napproving the settlement and asking for a remand.           I reject this\n\nsuggestion.\n\n       In Terrazas v. Ramirez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1575957\"><a href=\"/opinion/1575957/terrazas-v-ramirez/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">712</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 1991), seven of\n\nnine   members   of   the   Texas   Supreme   Court   rejected   a   similar\n\nargument.     In particular, they rejected an argument that the\n\nAttorney General lacked the power to negotiate and execute a\n\nsettlement agreement on behalf of the state.           A plurality of the\n\ncourt, consisting of Justice Hecht, Chief Justice Phillips, and\n\nJustice Cook, reasoned as follows:\n\n       The Attorney General, as the chief legal officer of the\n       State, has broad discretionary power in conducting his\n       legal duty and responsibility to represent the State.\n       This discretion includes the authority to propose a\n       settlement agreement in an action attacking the\n       constitutionality of a reapportionment statute.       The\n       Attorney General has participated in such settlements on\n       previous occasions.     Although the Attorney General\n       appears to have acted throughout this litigation only on\n       behalf of the state defendants and not for himself, he\n       had the authority, certainly for his clients and even on\n       his own, to suggest possible remedies after the district\n       court rendered an interlocutory summary judgment holding\n       Senate Bill 31 unconstitutional. He also had the power\n       to negotiate a settlement with the plaintiffs and to\n       execute an agreement with them. To hold that he did not\n       would be to give him less authority than any party or any\n       other attorney participating in the case.\n\n\n                                     225\n\fId.   at   721-22     (internal      citations      omitted)     (emphasis   added).\n\nJustice Hightower and Justice Gammage, dissenting on other grounds,\n\nrecognized    that     the    \"Attorney        General,     in   carrying    out     his\n\nconstitutional responsibility to represent the interests of the\n\nstate, has discretionary power to settle lawsuits on behalf of the\n\nstate so long as he does not usurp the authority of a co-equal\n\ndepartment of government.\"             Id. at 753 (Hightower, J., joined by\n\nGammage, J., dissenting). In a separate dissent, Justice Mauzy and\n\nJustice     Doggett    made        similar     statements    about    the    Attorney\n\nGeneral's power to settle lawsuits.                See id. at 746-47 (Mauzy, J.,\n\njoined by     Doggett,       J.,    dissenting).       Thus,     as   Justice    Mauzy\n\ncorrectly noted, seven justices agreed that \"[t]he [A]ttorney\n\n[G]eneral is constitutionally empowered to execute a settlement\n\nagreement in litigation challenging a legislative redistricting\n\nplan.\"     Id. at 747.\n\n      Consistently with the Texas Supreme Court's disposition in\n\nTerrazas, I would hold that the Texas Attorney General acted within\n\nhis power as the chief legal officer of the state by executing the\n\nproposed settlement and, thereafter, by requesting a remand.                         This\n\nlawsuit is, for all practical purposes, a suit against the State of\n\nTexas, and the decisions by the Attorney General in this regard are\n\nquintessential decisions about how to protect the state's interests\n\nin    litigation--decisions            which,      under    Texas     law,      he    is\n\nconstitutionally empowered to make on behalf of the state.89\n\n      89\n       I recognize, of course, that the mere fact that the\nAttorney General has executed a settlement agreement on behalf of\nthe state will not support the entry of a consent decree. The\n\n                                             226\n\fB.   Who Must Consent to the Settlement?\n\n     The majority also offers a second ground for refusing to\n\nremand the case for a hearing on the proposed settlement:             that not\n\nall of the \"defendants\" have consented to the remand or to the\n\nsettlement.     In particular, the majority argues that, because the\n\ntwo intervening district judges, Judge Wood and Judge Entz, as well\n\nas Chief Justice Phillips, object to the settlement, the settlement\n\ncould   not   be   approved   and   therefore   the   case   should    not   be\n\nremanded.     Again, I disagree.    In my view, by obtaining the consent\n\nof the Texas legislature, the Texas Attorney General did as much as\n\n(or perhaps more than) he was required to do under Texas law.\n\n\n\n\ndistrict court must hold a hearing on the propriety of the\nsettlement and consider the objections of all interested parties.\nBut the Plaintiffs and the State of Texas are not asking this\ncourt to enter a decree based on the specific settlement that the\nAttorney General negotiated and approved. Rather, they are only\nrequesting a remand on the basis of the parties' expressed desire\nto settle this lawsuit.\n     I also am aware that, under Texas law, \"[a]n admission,\nagreement, or waiver made by the attorney general in an action or\nsuit to which the state is a party does not prejudice the rights\nof the state.\" TEX. GOV'T. CODE.

At no point in her motion, or in her\nsupporting memorandum, does Judge Wood assert that she is\nentitled or should be allowed to intervene as a voter. In fact,\nshe does not allege that she is a registered voter of Harris\nCounty. Thus, unlike the majority, I cannot say that she was\npermitted to intervene as a registered voter.\n     In his motion to intervene, Judge Entz similarly focuses his\narguments on why he should be allowed to intervene as a sitting\nelected judge of Dallas County. He also alleges that he is a\nresident of Dallas County and is duly qualified and registered to\nvote in the county. He then states, that \"as such\" he has an\n\"interest in the fair administration of justice in Dallas County\nand the selection of a qualified judiciary.\" However, in his\nsupporting memorandum, he never again mentions his status as a\nvoter. Rather, like Judge Wood, he relies solely on the Williams\ncase to support his motion to intervene. Therefore, I am unable\nto conclude that he was permitted to intervene to protect his\ninterest--if, indeed, he has any such interest--in voting for all\nof the judges in Dallas County.\n     92\n       Had the Attorney General moved to dismiss the notice of\nappeal filed on behalf of the State of Texas, however, we might\nbe presented with another situation entirely.

The majority does not think so,\nbut, in my view, there are serious questions about whether Judge\nWood and Judge Entz, as sitting elected judges, would have\nstanding to maintain an appeal from an order which only declares\nthe current method of electing judges to be illegal.

The question in such cases is not whether white voters\nsuch as Judge Wood and Judge Entz, who seek to defend the status\nquo, would have standing to file a claim under section 2, but\nwhether they would have standing to attack the order of the\ndistrict court--that is, whether they have suffered an injury in\nfact as a result of the district court's liability decision.

On the contrary, the settlement has\n\nabsolutely no effect on either the tenure of these judges or the\n\nmanner in which they will be elected in the future.

As permissive\n\nintervenors,    they    have   no    \"claims\"    or    \"defenses\"     that   are\n\nadjudicated by the proposed settlement. And even a cursory reading\n\nof   the   proposed    settlement    reveals    that   it   does    not   impose\n\nobligations or duties on the intervening judges.                   Thus, under\n\nFirefighters, their withholding of consent to the motion to remand\n\nis simply irrelevant.\n\n      2.    Not Chief Justice Phillips\n\n      I would also hold that Chief Justice Phillips' objections to\n\nthis particular settlement do not preclude a remand.               As explained\n\nearlier, I do not view this lawsuit as being one against the\n\nvarious named officials, but rather, as one against the State of\n\n\n                                      231\n\fTexas.   And   because   the   Attorney   General   is    the   exclusive\n\nrepresentative of the state in such matters, the consent of Chief\n\nJustice Phillips is not required.\n\n     The Austin appellate court's decision in Bullock v. Texas\n\nSkating Ass'n, which was cited with approval by the plurality\n\nopinion in Terrazas, is particularly instructive.           In this tax\n\nrefund case, the plaintiff, who had prevailed in the lower court,\n\nargued that the Attorney General's notice of appeal should be\n\ndismissed because one of the Attorney General's \"clients\"--namely,\n\nthe Comptroller--had instructed the Attorney General not to file a\n\nnotice of appeal from the adverse decision.              In denying the\n\nplaintiff's motion as meritless, the Bullock court first described\n\nthe status of the various named defendants.           It stated, \"The\n\nAttorney General is a defendant in suits of this type in the same\n\nmanner that the Comptroller and the Treasurer are jurisdictional\n\nparties, although the State of Texas is the actual party in [a]\n\nsuit to recover taxes.\"        583 S.W.2d at 894.        The court then\n\nrejected the plaintiff's argument that \"the Comptroller, in the\n\nexercise of his administrative duties, such as tax refunds, can\n\nbring litigation to a halt at any time.\"     Id.    It explained:\n\n     In this suit the Comptroller obviously exercised his\n     administrative discretion and rejected [the plaintiff's]\n     request for refund of taxes paid under protest; otherwise\n     there would have been no litigation. Thereafter, upon\n     filing of suit, the Comptroller's statutory powers ended.\n     In matters of litigation the Attorney General is the\n     officer authorized by law to protect the interests of the\n     State, and even in matters of bringing suit the Attorney\n     General must exercise judgment and discretion, which will\n     not be controlled by other authorities. It was within\n     the discretion of the Attorney General, not that of the\n     Comptroller, to decide whether to appeal a case in which\n\n                                  232\n\f     the State had experienced an adverse judgment in the\n     trial court. In such matters the Attorney General, not\n     the Comptroller of Public Accounts, is authorized to\n     perform the duties of the State's attorney. The motion\n     to dismiss the appeal is overruled.\n\nId. (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).\n\n     Like the majority, I think that the decision to settle a\n\nlawsuit is, for all practical purposes, indistinguishable from the\n\ndecision to file (or not to file) a notice of appeal.             Unlike the\n\nmajority,   however,   I   also   think   that   the   Attorney   General's\n\ndecision on these issues controls--at least when it does not\n\nconflict with the view of another appropriate representative of the\n\nstate.   See supra Part II.A.2 (discussing Baker v. Wade).           Thus, I\n\ndo not think that Chief Justice Phillips, who is at                  most a\n\n\n\n\n                                    233\n\f\"jurisdictional party,\"93 must consent to a remand before the motion\n\nto remand is granted.94\n\n     3.   Perhaps the Texas Legislature\n\n     In concluding that neither the consent of the intervening\n\njudges nor the consent of Chief Justice Phillips is required, I am\n\nnot unmindful of the potential for state law separation of powers\n\nproblems in cases like these.      See Terrazas, 829 S.W.2d at 720.\n\nNor was the Attorney General unmindful of the potential for such\n\nproblems in this case.    This is why he sought and obtained approval\n\n\n     93\n       As discussed supra Part I.A.1., Chief Justice Phillips\nwas apparently named as a Young defendant--in order to get around\nthe Eleventh Amendment bar to suits brought directly against the\nstate. To come within the rule of Young, however, the officials\nwho are named as defendants \"must have some connection with the\nenforcement\" of the state law being challenged. See Young, 209\nU.S. at 157 (emphasis added). Otherwise, the named official has\nonly been made \"a party as a representative of the state\" in an\n\"attempt[] to make the state a party.\" Id. When officials who\nare not charged with enforcing the challenged state law are\njoined as parties, therefore, the proper course is dismissal.\n     Assuming section 2 does not waive a state's Eleventh\nAmendment immunity, the Plaintiffs correctly named the Texas\nAttorney General and the Secretary of State in their official\ncapacities. After all, both are responsible for enforcing the\ncurrent method of electing district court judges. However, the\nmembers of the Texas Judicial Districts Board (including Chief\nJustice Phillips), have legislative responsibilities--\nresponsibilities that arise only if the Texas legislature fails\nto act. See TEX. CONST. art. 5 § 7a(e). They have no enforcement\nresponsibilities whatsoever. Thus, in my mind there is a\nquestion as to whether the Plaintiffs' action against the members\nof the Judicial Districts Board, including Chief Justice\nPhillips, are barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\n     94\n       I recognize, of course, that the district court would\nhave to conduct an evidentiary hearing on the proposed settlement\nand that Chief Justice Phillips' objections to the proposed\nsettlement would have to be fully aired. The point is that, at\nthis time, all the parties are seeking is a remand; they are not\nseeking this court's stamp of approval on the current proposed\nsettlement.\n\n                                  234\n\fof   the   proposed   settlement   from    both   houses   of    the   Texas\n\nlegislature.\n\n      The majority suggests that, because the Texas legislature\n\ncould not enact the proposed settlement into law, its less formal\n\napproval of the proposed settlement is meaningless.             I disagree.\n\nThe Texas Senate, acting as a Committee of the Whole (which is\n\nauthorized by Texas law), expressed its approval of the proposed\n\nsettlement in the form of a resolution.       The Texas House similarly\n\napproved the proposed settlement through a resolution.             Both of\n\nthese   resolutions    were   \"official\"    expressions    of    the   Texas\n\nlegislature's position on the question of whether this case should\n\nbe settled.\n\n      In my view, these resolutions only reinforce the conclusion\n\nthat the State of Texas has consented to a remand and to entry of\n\nthe proposed settlement.      That two intervening judges and Chief\n\nJustice Phillips, none of whom was elected to represent the state\n\nin matters of litigation, do not consent, only serves to highlight\n\nthe extent to which this lawsuit has become politicized.               Their\n\nfailure to consent does not, however, preclude a remand or the\n\nentry of a settlement agreement.\n\nC.    Can the Proposed Settlement Override State Law?\n\n      Finally, the majority declines to remand this case because the\n\nproposed settlement is inconsistent with state law--specifically,\n\nthe provision of the Texas Constitution that allows judicial\n\ndistricts to be drawn smaller than a county, but only with the\n\napproval of the voters of the county.         See TEX. CONST. art V, §\n\n\n                                   235\n\f7a(i).    The majority holds that, without a final, non-appealable\n\ndecision finding a section 2 violation, voting rights cases cannot\n\nbe settled in a way that is inconsistent with state law.       Once\n\nagain, I must disagree.\n\n     The majority argues that in Chisom v. Roemer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587631\"><a href=\"/opinion/587631/ronald-chisom-marie-bookman-walter-willard-marc-morial-henry-dillon/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1408</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1409 (5th Cir. 1992), where we remanded a case similar to this, we\n\nwere able to remand because the parties brought with them a duly\n\nenacted state law.   Even assuming that the settlement proposed in\n\nChisom was entirely consistent with state law--a matter upon which\n\nwe expressed no opinion95--there is a crucial distinction between\n\nthis case and Chisom:     In Chisom, the district court had found no\n\nsection 2 liability; in this case, by contrast, the district court\n\nfound that the Texas' method of electing district court judges in\n\ncounty-wide elections violated section 2 in each of the nine target\n\ncounties.\n\n     I think the district court's section 2 liability findings\n\nprovide a sufficient basis for remanding the case for a hearing on\n\nthe proposed settlement. Of course, I agree with the majority that\n\nthe district court would not be able to \"merely sign on the line\n\nprovided by the parties.\"      See United States v. City of Miami,\n\n\n     95\n       An argument can be made that the settlement proposed in\nthe Chisom case--a settlement which had the effect of temporarily\nadding an eighth seat to the Louisiana Supreme Court--offended\nthe Louisiana Constitution. See LA. CONST. art. V, § 3 (\"The\nsupreme court shall be composed of a chief justice and six\nassociate justices, four of whom must concur to render\njudgment.\"). As the majority correctly notes, Louisiana's effort\nto amend the constitution to add an extra position had failed.\nSee Majority Opinion at 30 n.19. The point is that, before\nremanding, we never considered this question in Chisom.\n\n                                  236\n\fFlorida, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"397090\"><a href=\"/opinion/397090/27-fair-emplpraccas-913-27-empl-prac-dec-p-32328-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">664</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Former 5th Cir. 1981) (en banc).        Given the\n\ndetailed section 2 findings already made by the district court,\n\nhowever,   I   do   not   think   that    the   settlement's    apparent\n\ninconsistency with state law is a reason to deny the motion to\n\nremand.\n\n     Our decision in Overton v. City of Austin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"444583\"><a href=\"/opinion/444583/volma-overton-v-city-of-austin-etc-appeal-of-volma-overton-volma/\"><span class=\"volume\">748</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">941</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th\n\nCir. 1984), rather than arguing against a remand, suggests that a\n\nremand may be particularly appropriate in this case.           There, we\n\nrefused to mandamus a district court to enter a proposed consent\n\ndecree based on a settlement between minority plaintiffs and the\n\nCity of Austin.     We noted that, at the time the settlement was\n\npresented for approval, no evidence of vote dilution had been\n\npresented to the district court.         In holding that the district\n\ncourt did not abuse its wide discretion in refusing to enter the\n\nconsent decree, we concluded that the parties were effectively\n\ntrying to accomplish a result--namely, the amending of Austin's\n\nCity Charter--which they did not have the power to do without a\n\nvote of the people.   We stated:\n\n     Thus,   more  is   necessarily   involved  than  merely\n     ascertaining whether the parties have consented to an\n     ultimate result which is not of itself illegal,\n     unreasonable or unfair.     Absent a properly grounded\n     judicial   determination   that   the  present  charter\n     provisions are illegal, the consent of the parties\n     provides an insufficient basis on which to judicially\n     ordain a different system of council election and\n     composition.\n\n748 F.2d at 956-57 (emphasis added).96\n\n     96\n       Our discussion in Overton, happily enough, is consistent\nwith the Texas Supreme Court's decision in Terrazas. In that\ncase, a plurality of the members of the Texas Supreme Court\n\n                                   237\n\f       When the parties in this case presented their motion to\n\nremand, the case was in a very different posture than the one in\n\nOverton.     There had been lengthy trial, during which time the\n\nPlaintiffs    presented   substantial      evidence   of   vote    dilution.\n\nMoreover, the only decision which still stood was the district\n\ncourt's--i.e., the one holding that Texas' method of electing\n\ndistrict judges in at-large, county-wide elections operates in the\n\nnine target counties to dilute minority voting strength.              In my\n\nview, this decision constitutes a \"properly grounded judicial\n\ndetermination\" that the current system is illegal. It was based on\n\nthe    evidence   presented   at   trial   and   represents   a   reasonable\n\ninterpretation of that evidence. This finding should be sufficient\n\nunder Overton to allow the parties to effectuate a settlement they\n\notherwise would not have the authority to bring about under state\n\nlaw.\n\n\n\n\nrecognized that a state district court could enter a consent\ndecree, based on a settlement between the Attorney General and\nthe plaintiffs, which effectively reapportioned the state\nlegislative districts. It noted, however, that the entry of such\na consent judgment required some procedural regularity (i.e., the\nstate district judge would have to carefully consider the many\ninterests involved, give due deference to the legislature to\nrectify its own statutes, and give due regard for the effect of\nthe order on the election process). See 829 S.W.2d at 718. The\nplurality in Terrazas also suggested that court-ordered\nreapportionment based on such a settlement would be prohibited\nabsent a judicial determination that the current statute was\ninvalid. See id. at 722. Once there is a judicial determination\nthat the current statute is invalid, under the plurality opinion\nin Terrazas, a state district court would be able to enter a\nconsent decree based on a settlement agreement executed by the\nAttorney General. In short, neither Overton nor Terrazas\nrequires a final, non-appealable finding of liability before a\ncourt can override a provision of state law.\n\n                                     238\n\f       Also, because this settlement has been approved by a majority\n\nof both houses of the Texas legislature, I think that the motion to\n\nremand should be taken more seriously than the majority sees fit to\n\ndo.

In a\n\nconcurring opinion, four Justices explained why a federal court was\n\nrequired to show deference to the plan:\n\n       The essential point is that the Dallas City Council\n       exercised a legislative judgment, reflecting the policy\n       choices of the elected representatives of the people,\n       rather than the remedial directive of a federal court .\n       . . . This rule of deference to local legislative\n       judgments remains in force even if . . . our examination\n       of state law suggests that the local body lacks the\n       authority to reapportion itself.\n\nId. at 548. (Powell, J., concurring, joined by Burger, C.J.,\n\nBlackmun, and Rehnquist, JJ.).      Although the resolutions passed by\n\nthe Texas legislature in this case do not have the force of law,\n\nthey    do   represent   an   official    expression     of   the   \"elected\n\nrepresentatives of the people\" of Texas on the questions of whether\n\nand how this case should be settled.\n\n       Ultimately, the majority is able to rely on the settlement's\n\napparent inconsistency with state law as a ground to deny the\n\nmotion to remand because it is convinced \"there is no [section 2]\n\ncase\" here.        Even a cursory review of the record in this case\n\ndiscounts    the    majority's   characterization   of    the   Plaintiffs'\n\n                                    239\n\fevidence of vote dilution.       See generally supra Part I.    But the\n\nmajority's    statement   does    reveal   something   about   its   real\n\nmotivation for denying the motion to remand: its unwavering desire\n\nto reach the merits of this case so that it can overhaul the Voting\n\nRights Act.\n\nD.   The Implications of the Majority's Decision to Deny the Motion\n     to Remand\n\n     In sum, the majority offers three reasons why the motion to\n\nremand filed by the State of Texas and the Plaintiffs in this case\n\nmust be denied. None is persuasive. The majority cannot seriously\n\nargue that the Attorney General has exceeded his authority or that\n\nhe has somehow failed in his duty to represent the interests of the\n\nState of Texas.    And, although the majority correctly notes that\n\nnot all of the nominal \"defendants\" have joined in the motion to\n\nremand, it offers no reason why the case cannot be remanded without\n\nthe consent of the intervening judges and Chief Justice Phillips.\n\nFinally, the majority is able to rely on the fact that the proposed\n\nsettlement is inconsistent with Texas law only by reaching the\n\nmerits of the underlying section 2 dispute--and reversing the\n\ndistrict court on clearly erroneous grounds.\n\n     The majority's rationale for denying the motion to remand will\n\ndiscourage, if not prohibit, the settling of most voting rights\n\ncases.   It will effectively require the consent of all of the\n\nvarious named officials, as well as any party who, for whatever\n\nreason, has been permitted to intervene.       And, in most cases, it\n\nwill require a final, non-appealable decision that there is a\n\nsection 2 violation.      That is, under the majority's reasoning, a\n\n                                   240\n\fstate may effectively be forced to defend an election system, even\n\nwhen its chief legal officer thinks that the system runs afoul of\n\nthe Voting Rights Act, unless there is a conclusive determination\n\nby the Supreme Court that the system does indeed violate section 2.\n\nSomehow, I do not think this is consistent with our policy of\n\nencouraging settlements in other areas of the law.\n\n     Moreover, the majority's rationale for denying the motion to\n\nremand places a premium on judicial efficiency.       The majority\n\nconcludes that, based upon the evidence the Plaintiffs' adduced at\n\ntrial, no reasonable district court could enter a consent decree\n\nthat would override provisions of Texas law.   Of course, in making\n\nthis conclusion, the majority necessarily tramples upon other\n\njudicial values that are equally, if not more, important--namely,\n\nthe values of judicial restraint and federalism.   It also turns a\n\ndeaf ear to the one voice in this lawsuit who is authorized to\n\nspeak on behalf of the State of Texas, the Attorney General, and\n\nignores the Texas legislature's official expression of its desire\n\nto see this case settled.\n\n     Instead of elevating judicial efficiency above these other\n\nvalues, I would grant the motion to remand.    In doing so, I would\n\nexpress no opinion on the proposed settlement, but would instruct\n\nthe district court that it should carefully consider the objections\n\nof the intervening judges, Chief Justice Phillips, and other\n\ninterested parties. I would also instruct the district court that,\n\nin deciding whether a settlement can override state law, it must\n\nconsider all evidence relevant to the question of whether there is\n\n\n                               241\n\fa section 2 violation, including the state's valid interests in\n\nmaintaining the current system.\n\n     Admittedly,   this      course    of   action   might    eliminate     our\n\nopportunity to address many of the new, burning questions about the\n\nframework for deciding section 2 cases.         But that is not the duty\n\nof an Article III court.      Rather, as the majority notes, \"[o]ur job\n\nis to decide a case or controversy.\"            Majority Opinion at 27.\n\nWhere the plaintiffs and the defendant in a case have expressed a\n\ndesire to settle their dispute, I think that principles of judicial\n\nrestraint require us to give them the opportunity to do so.\n\n\n\nWIENER, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n\n     I respectfully dissent.          In so doing I join the dissent of\n\nChief Judge Politz in the belief that we judge best when we judge\n\nleast,   particularly   in    controversial     matters      of   high   public\n\ninterest to the several states.         If forced to take a position on\n\nthe merits of this, the second en banc consideration of the case,\n\nI would regrettably find it impossible to concur in the reasoning\n\nof Judge Higginbotham's majority opinion or Judge Jones' concurring\n\nopinion.   For me those writings simply do not \"hang together.\"               I\n\nwould therefore reach the same conclusion as does Judge King in her\n\ndissentSQand for most if not all of the same reasons.\n\n\n\n\n                                      242\n\f</pre>",
