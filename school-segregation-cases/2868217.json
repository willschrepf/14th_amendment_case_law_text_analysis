Stat. Ann. tit. 43,\nSS 951-63 (1991 & Supp. 1997).1 Simpson contends that\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. In relevant part, the ADEA provides that\n\n        It shall be unlawful for an employer --\n\n        (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or\n        otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his\n        compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\n        because of such individual's age;\n\n        (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which\n        would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment\n        opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an\n        employee, because of such individual's age.\n\n29 U.S.C. S 623(a). In relevant part, the PHRA provides that\n\n        It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice . . . [f]or any\n        employer because of the . . . age . . . of any individual or\n        independent contractor, to refuse to hire or employ or contract\nwith,\n        or to bar or to discharge from employment such individual or\n        independent contractor, or to otherwise discriminate against such\n        individual or independent contractor with respect to compensation,\n        hire, tenure, terms, conditions or privileges of employment or\n        contract, if the individual or independent contractor is the best\nable\n        and most competent to perform the services required.\n\nPa. Stat. Ann. tit. 43, S 955.\n\n                                 2\n\fevidence of the more favorable treatment of one allegedly\nsimilarly situated younger employee is sufficient to permit\nthe inference that the employer's proffered reason for her\ndemotion is a pretext for discrimination. We reject this\ncontention and hold that a plaintiff does not create an issue\nof fact merely by selectively choosing a single comparator\nwho was allegedly treated more favorably, while ignoring a\nsignificant group of comparators who were treated equally\nto her.\n\nSimpson also contends that pretext can be inferred from\nalleged inconsistencies between Kay Jewelers' proffered\nreasons and its actions. We also reject this contention and,\nfollowing Ezold v. Wolf, Block, Schorr and Solis-Cohen, 983\nF.2d 509 (3d Cir. 1993) (pretext turns on the qualifications\nand criteria identified by the employer, not the categories\nthe plaintiff considers important), conclude that Simpson\nhas not presented evidence sufficient to infer that Kay\nJewelers' proffered explanations were a pretext for\ndiscrimination. We therefore affirm.\n\nI.\n\nPlaintiff, Sandra Simpson, was an employee of Kay\nJewelers in the DuBois Mall in Clearfield County,\nPennsylvania. Kay Jewelers was a chain of retail jewelry\nstores, which was purchased by Sterling, Inc. in 1990.\nSimpson was originally hired as a bookkeeper in May,\n1973, and promoted to assistant manager in 1976. She was\npromoted to store manager in 1979, a position she held\nuntil her demotion in 1994.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1994, Simpson's forte was her individual\njewelry sales. The overall store sales, however, were\nconsidered deficient. Kay Jewelers set sales quotas for each\nof its stores, taking into account such factors as economic\nconditions, mall conditions, and competition. From\nSeptember 1991 to March 1994, Simpson's store satisfied\nits monthly store sales quota eight out of thirty-one\nmonths. During the fourteen months immediately prior to\nher demotion, it met quota three times. The district\nmanager repeatedly indicated on Simpson's evaluations\nthat she needed to improve her quota performance and\n\n                               3\n\fincrease store sales.2 The 1991, 1992, and 1994\nevaluations identified increased sales as \"major\ndevelopmental needs.\" The 1993 evaluation stated that\nSimpson needed to \"work to get 6/6 [quotas]\" and \"improve\n[store sales] to min of 103% [of planned sales].\" The district\nmanager repeatedly identified increased staff training, role\nplaying, and staff motivation as necessary to improve\noverall sales. The \"action plan for development\" in each\nevaluation from 1991 through 1994 listed the need for daily\nstaff training and role playing. At least twice, the district\nmanager told Simpson she would be demoted if she did not\nmeet the store sales quotas.\n\nIn March 1993, after Simpson failed to meet sales quotas\nin any of the preceding six months, the district manager\ncreated a Get It Done list (\"GID\"), which identified problem\nareas and defined \"action plans\" to correct the problems. In\nthe GID, the district manager stated that Simpson's\nperformance in areas other than store sales were basically\nup to standard, but that sales, the most important area,\nwas lacking. The district manager concluded that \"lack of\ntraining, direction, staffing, store moral[e], and aggressive\nsales efforts\" were the \"key reason[s] for the substandard\nsales production.\" Furthermore, the district manager\nrecommended that if \"compliance is not obtain[ed] and\nresults achieved that [Kay Jewelers] should consider a\nmanagement change (demotion, not termination).\" Id.\n\nAs part of the GID, Simpson was instructed to maintain\na sixty-day log of daily training sessions to be held with\neach employee. Simpson testified at her deposition that\ndaily training was held, but not with each employee each\nday. She also testified that some, but \"not a lot\" of role\nplaying was conducted. One of Simpson's employees\ntestified that she never received training through role\nplaying. Another employee testified that role playing was\nnot conducted on a daily basis. The store met its sales\nquotas for both months during the sixty-day period.\nHowever, from the end of the GID period through March\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. Simpson had two district managers during the period in question.\nWilliam Miller was district manager through August 1991. Mark Law was\ndistrict manager from August 1991 through March 1994.\n\n                               4\n\f1994, the store sales quotas were met only once out of the\nten months. In March 1994, the district manager\nrecommended that Simpson be demoted because of her\nunacceptable store sales and continuous failure to train\nand motivate staff to meet sales quotas. The\nrecommendation was approved by two Vice Presidents, and\nSimpson was demoted to sales associate at the age of 57.\nSimpson was replaced by Becky Bush, a 42 year old\nwoman.\n\nSimpson filed a claim with the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") in May 1994, alleging\nage discrimination. The EEOC determined there was no\nreasonable cause to believe that there was unlawful\ndiscrimination. Simpson then filed suit in the district court\nfor the Western District of Pennsylvania alleging\ndiscrimination in violation of the ADEA and PHRA. After\ndiscovery, Kay Jewelers moved for summary judgment. The\nmagistrate judge concluded that Simpson had failed to\nmake out a case of pretext, and recommended that\nsummary judgment be entered for Kay Jewelers. The\ndistrict judge adopted the magistrate judge's report and\ngranted Kay Jewelers' motion for summary judgment. This\ntimely appeal followed.\n\nThe district court exercised jurisdiction pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. SS 1331, 1367. We exercise appellate jurisdiction\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. S 1291 and our review of the district\ncourt's grant of summary judgment is plenary. Ersek v.\nTownship of Springfield, 102 F.3d 79, 83 (3d Cir. 1996).3\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. In reviewing a grant of summary judgment we\n\n       (i) resolve conflicting evidence in favor of the nonmovant, (ii) do\nnot\n       engage in credibility determinations, and (iii) draw all reasonable\n       inferences in favor of the nonmovant. The movant has the burden of\n       pointing out that evidence cognizable in a motion for summary\n       judgment which the movant believes entitles it to summary\n       judgment; the nonmovant must then respond by pointing to\n       sufficient cognizable evidence to create material issues of fact\n       concerning every element as to which the nonmoving party will bear\n       the burden of proof at trial.\n\nFuentes v. Perskie, 32 F.3d 759, 762 n.1 (3d Cir. 1994).\n\n                                5\n\fII.\n\nSimpson advances a pretext claim which is perforce\nanalyzed under the three steps of the McDonnell Douglas\nline of cases, see McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411\nU.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817 (1973); Texas Dep't of Community\nAffairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089 (1981); St.\nMary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 113 S.Ct. 2742\n(1993), that we have applied to ADEA cases, see e.g.,\nSempier v. Johnson & Higgins, 45 F.3d 724, 728 (3d Cir.\n1995).4 We set forth the familiar McDonnell Douglas\nframework in the margin.5 We will not discuss steps one\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. It has also been applied to PHRA cases. See Bernard v. Bethenergy\nMines, Inc., 837 F. Supp. 714, 715 (W.D. Pa. 1993), aff'd, 31 F.3d 1170\n(3d Cir. 1994); Fairfield Township Volunteer Fire Co. v. Commonwealth,\n609 A.2d 804, 805 (Pa. 1992).\n\n5. Under the McDonnell Douglas line of cases, as applied to the ADEA\nand the analogous provision of the PHRA, there are three steps in the\nanalysis of pretext discrimination cases. See McDonnell Douglas, 411\nU.S. at 802-04, 93 S.Ct. at 1824-25. First, the plaintiff must establish a\nprima facie case of discrimination. Hicks, 509 U.S. at 506, 113 S.Ct. at\n2746-47. This is done if she shows that she (1) is a member of the\nprotected class, i.e. at least 40 years of age, 29 U.S.C. S 631(a), (2) is\nqualified for the position, (3) suffered an adverse employment decision,\nand (4) in the case of a demotion or discharge, was replaced by a\nsufficiently younger person to create an inference of age discrimination,\nChipollini v. Spencer Gifts, Inc., 814 F.2d 893, 897 (3d Cir. 1987).\nSecond, upon such a showing by the plaintiff, the burden shifts to the\nemployer to produce evidence of a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason\nfor the adverse decision. Hicks, 509 U.S. at 506-07, 113 S.Ct. at 2747.\nThird, the plaintiff must then demonstrate that the employer's\narticulated reason was not the actual reason, but rather a pretext for\ndiscrimination. Id. at 507; 113 S.Ct. at 2747.\n\nSimpson incorrectly defines the second step as shifting the burden to\nthe employer to show that its legitimate reason, alone, would have\ninduced the employment decision. Such a burden of showing that the\nsame decision would have been made absent discriminatory motives\napplies in Price Waterhouse mixed motive cases, not McDonnell Douglas\npretext cases. See Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins , 490 U.S. 228, 276, 109\nS.Ct. 1775, 1805 (1989) (O'Connor, J., concurring); Walden v. Georgia-\nPacific Corp., 126 F.3d 506, 512 (3d Cir. 1997), petition for cert. filed,\n__\nU.S.L.W. __ (U.S. Feb. 17, 1998) (No. 97-1350). See generally Mardell v.\nHarleysville Life Ins. Co., 31 F.3d 1221, 1225 n.6 (3d Cir. 1994)\n\n                               6\n\fand two of the framework because although the parties\ncontest the district court findings that Simpson established\na prima facie case of discrimination and that Kay Jewelers\nproffered a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the\ndemotion, we assume arguendo that these steps have been\nsatisfied and proceed to step three of the analysis.6\n\nTo survive summary judgment when the employer has\narticulated a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its\naction, the plaintiff must\n\n       point to some evidence, direct or circumstantial, from\n       which a factfinder could reasonably either (1) disbelieve\n       the employer's articulated legitimate reasons; or (2)\n       believe that an invidious discriminatory reason was\n       more likely than not a motivating or determinative\n       cause of the employer's action.\n\nFuentes v. Perskie, 32 F.3d 759, 764 (3d Cir. 1994). To\ndiscredit the employer's articulated reason, the plaintiff\nneed not produce evidence that necessarily leads to the\nconclusion that the employer acted for discriminatory\nreasons, Sempier, 45 F.3d at 732, nor produce additional\nevidence beyond her prima facie case, Fuentes, 32 F.3d at\n764. The plaintiff must, however, point to \"weaknesses,\nimplausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or\ncontradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n(summarizing Price Waterhouse evidentiary scheme), vacated, 514 U.S.\n1034, 115 S.Ct. 1397 (1995), and modified in part, 65 F.3d 1072 (3d Cir.\n1995). This case is clearly not a mixed motive case because Simpson has\npointed to no direct evidence that the \"decisionmakers placed substantial\nnegative reliance on [age] in reaching their decision.\" Price Waterhouse,\n490 U.S. at 277, 109 S.Ct. at 1805; Walden, 126 F.3d at 513. Rather,\nSimpson points to evidence from which she claims pretext can be\ninferred. Armbruster v. Unisys Corp., 32 F.3d 768, 783 (3d Cir. 1994).\n\n6. We note, however, that Simpson's challenge to Kay Jewelers' proffered\nreason is misplaced to the extent she claims that the explanation is\ninvalid because there was no evidence that it was the actual reason for\nher demotion. In pretext discrimination cases such as this, \"[t]he\nemployer need not prove that the tendered reason actually motivated its\nbehavior, as throughout this burden-shifting paradigm the ultimate\nburden of proving intentional discrimination always rests with the\nplaintiff.\" Fuentes, 32 F.3d at 763 (emphasis added).\n\n                               7\n\freasons [such] that a reasonable factfinder could rationally\nfind them `unworthy of credence' \" and hence infer that the\nproffered nondiscriminatory reason \"did not actually\nmotivate\" the employer's action. Id. at 764-765 (quoting\nEzold, 983 F.2d at 531).\n\nTo show that discrimination was more likely than not a\ncause for the employer's action, the plaintiff must point to\nevidence with sufficient probative force that a factfinder\ncould conclude by a preponderance of the evidence that age\nwas a motivating or determinative factor in the employment\ndecision. Keller v. Orix Credit Alliance, Inc., 130 F.3d 1101,\n1111 (3d Cir. 1997). For example, the plaintiff may show\nthat the employer has previously discriminated against her,\nthat the employer has discriminated against other persons\nwithin the plaintiff's protected class or within another\nprotected class, or that the employer has treated more\nfavorably similarly situated persons not within the\nprotected class. Fuentes, 32 F.3d at 765.\n\nKay Jewelers asserts that Simpson was demoted because\nshe repeatedly failed to attain the store sales quotas and\nfailed to adequately train and motivate her staff to meet\nquotas. Simpson does not dispute her failure to attain the\nstore sales quotas or to adequately train her staff, but does\nmake numerous arguments in an attempt to both discredit\nthese reasons and show that discrimination was more likely\nthan not the motivating cause of her demotion. Simpson\nprimarily relies on the fact that Dolly Field, a younger\nmanager, was not demoted or fired.7 Simpson argues that\nshe and Field were similarly situated because their stores\nwere the same size, they were supervised and evaluated by\nthe same district manager, and their sales quotas took into\naccount the economics of store location.8 Simpson submits\nthat her performance was superior to Field's because in\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. Dolly Field became a store manager in 1991. She was 26 years old at\nthe time Simpson was demoted.\n\n8. Kay Jewelers argues that the two stores are not comparable, pointing\nto differences in mall occupancy rates, local competition, and store\nappearance. The district court assumed the stores were comparable. We\nwill not address the issue in light of the flaws in Simpson's arguments\ndiscussed infra.\n\n                               8\n\fboth 1993 and 1994 her evaluation scores for sales were\nhigher than Field's and both she and Field received an\noverall rating of \"good\".9 Simpson then claims that despite\nbeing evaluated superior to Field, Field was retained as\nmanager, while she was demoted; Field was praised, while\nshe was criticized; and Field received a higher score in\n\"store performance areas,\" a category Simpson argues is\ndirectly related to store sales. According to Simpson, this\nevidence of Field's more favorable treatment discredits Kay\nJewelers' proffered reasons and leads to the inference that\nage discrimination was more likely than not the motivating\ncause of her demotion. Simpson's reliance on Field is\nmisplaced for the reasons that follow.\n\nIII.\n\nFirst, Simpson's reliance on Field is misplaced because\nshe cannot selectively choose a comparator. The plaintiff\nhas the burden of demonstrating that similarly situated\npersons were treated differently. Burdine, 450 U.S. at 258,\n101 S.Ct. at 1096. The employer's actions are considered in\nlight of its actions towards the allegedly more favored\ngroup, in this case younger managers. Ezold 983 F.2d at\n527; McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804; 93 S.Ct. at 1825\n(employer may take adverse action, but only if based on\ncriteria applied to members of all races). However, the mere\nfavorable treatment of one younger manager as compared\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. The evaluation forms indicate that Simpson's overall scores were 38.2\nin 1993 and 35.8 in 1994, both equivalent to a \"needs improvement\"\nrating; whereas Field's scores were 40.3 and 40.5, respectively, both\nequivalent to a \"good\" rating. However, Simpson alleges that her overall\nscores, based on the unmodified version of her 1993 evaluation and the\ncorrection of an alleged error in the 1994 evaluation, were \"40\" in both\nyears, equivalent to a \"good\" rating. The original 1993 evaluation was\nmodified when the district manager reduced by two the points given to\nSimpson in the \"charge accounts\" category. The district manager\ncontends that the change was made because he erroneously awarded\npoints for performance that was actually below the corporate standard.\nSimpson alleges that the 1994 scoring for sales production was incorrect\nbecause her 90% performance in store sales versus planned sales should\nhave warranted two points within the category and an additional 3.8\npoints overall.\n\n                               9\n\fto one older manager may not be sufficient to infer age\ndiscrimination.\n\nThis is not to say that evidence of the more favorable\ntreatment of a single member of a non-protected group is\nnever relevant, but rather that the evidence can not be\nviewed in a vacuum. See Ezold, 983 F.2d at 539 (viewing\nrecord as a whole in finding insufficient evidence that\nplaintiff was treated more severely than her male\nassociates); Waldron v. SL Indus., Inc., 56 F.3d 491, 496-97\n(3d Cir. 1995) (considering evidence that one younger\nmanager was treated more favorably despite having\ndifficulties similar to plaintiff, where additional evidence\ntended to discredit employer's proffered reason). A decision\nadversely affecting an older employee does not become a\ndiscriminatory decision merely because one younger\nemployee is treated differently. See Billet v. CIGNA Corp.,\n940 F.2d 812, 827-28 (3d Cir. 1991) (finding plaintiff's\nevidence of younger employees benefiting from company\nreorganization insufficient to withstand directed verdict for\nemployer). The ultimate inquiry is whether the decision was\nmotivated by the affected employee's age. Id. at 827.\n\nWe find instructive the Seventh Circuit's decision in Bush\nv. Commonwealth Edison Co. There, the court held that just\nas an employer cannot insulate itself from claims of racial\ndiscrimination by identifying a token black person whom it\ntreated with abnormal leniency, a black plaintiff cannot\nestablish racial discrimination by singling out one white\nperson who was treated more favorably when there were\nother white persons who were treated less favorably than\nother black persons. 990 F.2d 928, 931 (7th Cir. 1993).\n\"Such a pattern, in which blacks sometimes do better than\nwhites and sometimes do worse, being random with respect\nto race, is not evidence of racial discrimination.\" Id. We\nagree, because to hold otherwise would be to permit the\ninference of discrimination anytime a single member of a\nnon-protected group was allegedly treated more favorably\nthan one member of the protected group, regardless of how\nmany other members of the non-protected group were\ntreated equally or less favorably.\n\nSuch an inference may be acceptable at the prima facie\nstage of the analysis, see Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253, 101\n\n                               10\n\fS.Ct. at 1094 (recognizing that plaintiff's burden to\nestablish a prima facie case is not \"onerous\"), where the\ninquiry is based on a few generalized factors, Hicks 509\nU.S. at 516, 113 S.Ct. at 2752, but not necessarily at the\npretext stage where the factual inquiry into the alleged\ndiscriminatory motives of the employer has risen to a new\nlevel of specificity, see id.; Burdine, 450 U.S. at 255, 101\nS.Ct. at 1095. We recognize, as did the Seventh Circuit in\nBush, that freedom from discrimination is \"an individual\nrather than a group entitlement.\" Bush, 990 F.2d at 931;\n29 U.S.C. S 623(a)(1) (prohibiting age discrimination against\nany \"individual\"); see also Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U.S.\n440, 453-55, 102 S.Ct. 2525, 2534-35 (1982) (recognizing\nthat similar provision in Title VII protects individual\nemployee, rather than group). However, there still must be\nevidence from which to infer discrimination apart from the\nfact that some members of one group are sometimes treated\nbetter and sometimes treated worse than members of\nanother group. Bush, 990 F.2d at 931. As stated by the\ndistrict court, the plaintiff can not \"pick out one comparator\nwho was not demoted amid a sea of persons treated the\nsame as her\" to establish a jury question. Simpson v. Kay\nJewelers, No. 95-270J, mem. order at 2 (W.D. Pa. Mar. 18,\n1997) (footnote omitted).\n\nSimpson relies solely on Field as a comparator in arguing\nthat evidence of less favorable treatment gives rise to an\ninference of discrimination. She does not discuss any of the\nthirty-five other managers who, between 1992 and 1994,\nwere demoted to sales associate positions because of their\nstore sales performance.10 Of the thirty-five, all were\nyounger than Simpson and thirty-four were under the age\nof 40. Thus, even if Simpson was similarly situated to Field\nbut treated less favorably, see infra, Simpson's reliance on\na single member of the non-protected class is insufficient to\ngive rise to an inference of discrimination when Simpson\nwas treated the same as thirty-four members of the non-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10. Simpson incorrectly asserts that Kay Jewelers did not present any\nevidence as to the reason for these thirty-five demotions. An affidavit\nsubmitted by Kay Jewelers and Kay Jewelers' answers to Simpson's\ninterrogatories state that the thirty-five persons were demoted because of\nproblems with store sales. Simpson presents no evidence to the contrary.\n\n                               11\n\fprotected class. Simply stated, to show that Kay Jewelers'\nproffered reasons were pretext, Simpson can not pick and\nchoose a person she perceives is a valid comparator who\nwas allegedly treated more favorably, and completely ignore\na significant group of comparators who were treated equally\nor less favorably than she.\n\nIV.\n\nMoreover, even if Field were a proper comparator,\nSimpson's reliance on her would still be misplaced. In\ndetermining whether similarly situated nonmembers of a\nprotected class were treated more favorably than a member\nof the protected class, the focus is on the particular criteria\nor qualifications identified by the employer as the reason\nfor the adverse action. Ezold, 983 F.2d at 528. The\nemployee's positive performance in another category is not\nrelevant, id., and neither is the employee's judgment as to\nthe importance of the stated criterion, Healy v. New York\nLife Ins. Co., 860 F.2d 1209, 1216 (3d Cir. 1988).\nFurthermore, the court does not subjectively weigh factors\nit considers important. Brewer v. Quaker State Oil Refining\nCorp., 72 F.3d 326, 331 (3d Cir. 1995); see also Ezold, 983\nF.2d at 528 (rejecting district court's subjective weighing of\nplaintiff's abilities). Rather, the plaintiff must point to\nevidence from which a factfinder could reasonably infer that\nthe plaintiff satisfied the criterion identified by the employer\nor that the employer did not actually rely upon the stated\ncriterion. Fuentes, 32 F.3d at 767. Compare Brewer, 72\nF.3d at 331-32 (finding that plaintiff's receipt of\nperformance bonus raised issue of fact as to whether\nemployer's performance-based explanation for discharging\nplaintiff was pretext) with Ezold, 983 F.2d at 528-29\n(finding that plaintiff's abilities in areas other than legal\nanalysis not relevant in determining if law firm's legal\nanalysis explanation for not promoting plaintiff was\npretext).\n\nSimpson relies completely on evaluation scores in\narguing that, as compared to Field, her allegedly superior\nperformance but less favorable treatment discredits Kay\nJewelers' proffered reasons for her demotion. Kay Jewelers,\nhowever, did not represent that it relied on evaluation\n\n                               12\n\fscores. Thus, Simpson's view of her performance, as\nmeasured by evaluation scores, is not relevant. Instead,\nfocusing on the stated criterion -- sales quotas-- Field's\nperformance was superior to Simpson's, a result Simpson\ndoes not dispute. Field met or surpassed her quotas six out\nof the fourteen months preceding Simpson's demotion;\nwhereas Simpson only met her quotas three out of the\nsame fourteen months.11 Accordingly, Simpson's evaluation\nevidence does not create a genuine issue of material fact.\n\nV.\n\nA.\n\nSimpson's other arguments are also inadequate to\nsurvive summary judgment. Simpson argues that the use of\nsales quotas as the criterion is suspect. She claims that\nusing performance on sales quotas is inconsistent with\nevaluation scoring, and points to the fact that despite Field\nhaving satisfied her sales quota more often than Simpson,\nField's evaluation scores in all sales criteria were equal to\nor below Simpson's. This, according to Simpson, counsels\nthat meeting sales quotas is not determinative of the\nadequacy of a manager's performance. Implicit in this\nargument is the contention that evaluation scores are more\nindicative of performance. Whether sales quotas or\nevaluation scores are a more appropriate measure of a\nmanager's performance is not for the court (or factfinder) to\ndecide. Healy, 860 F.2d at 1216 (\"our inquiry . . . is not an\nindependent assessment of how we might evaluate[an]\nemployee\"). \"The question is not whether the employer\nmade the best, or even a sound, business decision; it is\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11. We find no significance in Kay Jewelers' use of sales data from March\n1994, the same month Simpson was demoted, in arguing that Field was\nmore qualified for the position. Simpson was demoted on or about March\n29 and the decision to demote was made approximately one week earlier.\nThus, Simpson's March performance was not likely a factor in the\ndecision. Nonetheless, if we eliminate March 1994 from the equation,\nField still performed better than Simpson: Field met her quotas five out\nof thirteen months, whereas Simpson met her quotas three out of\nthirteen months.\n\n                               13\n\fwhether the real reason is [discrimination].\" Keller, 130\nF.3d at 1109 (quoting Carson v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 82\nF.3d 157, 159 (7th Cir. 1996)) (alteration in original).\n\nIn addition, citing Bray v. Marriott Hotels, 110 F.3d 986\n(3d Cir. 1997), Simpson claims that this alleged\ninconsistency with evaluation scores raises an inference of\nimproper motives. In Bray, we found that various\ndiscrepancies in how the employer evaluated the criteria\npurportedly relied on to promote a white person over the\nblack plaintiff, was sufficient to raise questions of fact as to\nthe employer's motives. 110 F.3d at 993-97 (finding\ndiscrepancies in the timing of employee evaluations, priority\ngiven to factors in ranking candidates, and interpretation of\noccupational grade levels, all of which were identified as\nreasons for not promoting plaintiff). Bray, however, is\nclearly distinguishable. In Bray the discrepancies were in\nthe use of criteria identified as determinative by the\nemployer, see id., whereas in this case Simpson is pointing\nto discrepancies between a criterion identified by Kay\nJewelers (sales quotas) and a criterion asserted only by\nSimpson (evaluation scores). As we have said, the focus is\non the criteria identified by the employer, not the criteria\nonly the plaintiff thinks are important. Healy, 860 F.2d at\n1216.12\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12. Simpson also asserts that the use of sales quotas is suspect because\nsome of the store managers purportedly demoted for failure to meet\nquotas were actually \"proficient\" at meeting their quotas. Simpson points\nto five managers who minimally met their store sales quotas fifty percent\nof the time (ten out of twelve times, five out of seven times, four out of\nsix times, seven out of twelve times, and three out of six times).\nIdentifying five out of thirty-five persons who performed substantially\nbetter than Simpson at meeting sales quotas does not reasonably lead to\nthe inference that Kay Jewelers did not rely on sales quotas in demoting\nSimpson. The issue is \"whether discriminatory animus motivated the\nemployer, not whether the employer [was] wise, shrewd, prudent, or\ncompetent.\" Fuentes, 32 F.3d at 765. Thus, this alleged contradiction,\nwhich may raise a question as to the wiseness of demoting those five\nmanagers, does not give rise to the inference that Kay Jewelers demoted\nSimpson for something other than the asserted nondiscriminatory\nreason. To the contrary, the fact that younger managers with superior\nperformance were demoted can be viewed as evidence that age was\nirrelevant.\n\n                               14\n\fB.\n\nSimpson argues that the district manager's failure to\nassist in training, and his interference with store\noperations, gives rise to an inference that the district\nmanager was seeking to obtain a predetermined result --\nher demotion -- for discriminatory reasons. Specifically,\nSimpson claims that the district manager failed to conduct\ntwo two-day training sessions as indicated on the GID,13\nwas not helpful when present at the store and on one\noccasion verbally berated the employees such that their\nmorale was low, and failed to provide Simpson with the\ndiscount codes necessary to offer merchandise discounts\ngreater than fifteen percent.\n\nTo the extent the inference can be made that the district\nmanager's behavior impacted the store's sales, the\nevidence, without more, does not rise to such a level that a\nfactfinder could reasonably conclude by a preponderance of\nthe evidence that Kay Jewelers acted with a discriminatory\nmotive. Cf. Bonura v. Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., 795\nF.2d 276 (2d Cir. 1986) (finding sufficient evidence to\nuphold jury verdict for plaintiff allegedly discharged for\nsubstandard performance where evidence led to inference\nthat supervisor interfered with employee's efforts, as well as\nthat employee performed adequately and employer sought\nto hire younger persons).\n\nC.\n\nSimpson argues that the failure to train explanation is\ninconsistent with Kay Jewelers' actions. She asserts that if\ntraining had actually been important then the district\nmanager would have conducted the training sessions\npursuant to the GID, and the home office would have sent\na trainer to the store. Furthermore, Simpson points to the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13. It is not clear that Simpson is accurately viewing the facts. Simpson\nclaims the district manager was to conduct training sessions, however\nthe GID only indicates that the district manager was to visit the store,\nwhich may be interpreted as merely requiring the district manager to\nfollow-up on Simpson's efforts at training. Nonetheless, we resolve\nconflicting evidence in favor of Simpson.\n\n                                15\n\fabsence of any further counseling on training after her\nsuccessful completion of the GID. Viewing this evidence in\nthe light most favorable to Simpson,14 at most it leads to an\ninference that Kay Jewelers did not consider it important to\nassist Simpson in training her staff; it can not be inferred\nthat it was unimportant for Simpson to improve training on\nher own accord. The record is replete with evidence,\ncontrary to Simpson's assertion that there is no evidence,\nthat Kay Jewelers considered staff training important. From\n1991 to 1994, each of Simpson's evaluations indicated that\nshe needed to conduct more training. The GID specifically\nrequired training to be conducted on a daily basis.\nAccordingly, there is no basis from which to infer that the\nfailure to train explanation was \"unworthy of credence.\"15\nFuentes, 32 F.3d at 765. Simpson makes three additional\narguments, which we find completely without merit.16\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n14. Simpson contends she successfully completed the GID, but Kay\nJewelers argues that she did not implement all of the instructions on the\nlist.\n\n15. Simpson also claims that Kay Jewelers did not raise the failure to\ntrain explanation to the EEOC. Kay Jewelers' position statement to the\nEEOC states:\n\n       As a result of the Charging Party's declining performance level and\n       lack of responsive initiative . . . Charging Party was demoted from\n       Store Manager to full-time sales employee . . . based upon Charging\n       Party's failure to improve store sales. . . . [I]t was Charging\nParty's\n       responsibility to maintain . . . the sales of the entire store by\n       training, motivating and managing the store staff.\n\nAppendix at 731a. Even if this statement could be read as not\nspecifically indicating that Simpson's failure to train was a reason for\nher\ndemotion, it does not make Kay Jewelers' subsequent raising of the\nexplanation pretextual. \"[T]he mere fact that a defendant relies on a post\nhoc [explanation] does not in and of itself create a factual dispute about\nwhether the [explanation was] pretextual.\" Healy, 860 F.2d at 1215. The\nplaintiff must point to evidence that demonstrates there is reason to\ndisbelieve the explanation. Id. at 1215-16; see also McCoy v. WGN\nContinental Broadcasting Co., 957 F.2d 368, 374 (7th Cir. 1992)\n(declining to bind defendants to \"positions they initially assert in state\nadministrative proceedings by rendering any different position a per se\npretext\"). Simpson has not pointed to any such evidence.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n16. Simpson asserts that (1) the district manager's downward revision of\nher evaluation score reflects adversely on Kay Jewelers' veracity; (2) the\n\f16\n\fIn sum, Simpson has not provided evidence sufficient to\ndiscredit Kay Jewelers' proffered reasons or to permit the\ninference that discrimination was more likely than not a\nmotivating or determinative cause for her demotion.\nAccordingly, the district court's order granting summary\njudgment to the defendant will be affirmed.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\ndownward departure in evaluation scores between 1992 and 1993 is\nsuspicious; and (3) Kay Jewelers' claim of low store morale due to\nSimpson's alleged \"stealing\" of associates' sales is a baseless\naccusation.\nAs we discussed previously, the focus is on the\"qualification[s] the\nemployer found lacking.\" Ezold, 983 F.2d at 528. Kay Jewelers found\nthat Simpson was deficient in meeting her store sales quotas and in\ntraining her staff; Kay Jewelers did not rely on the evaluation scores or\nthe alleged stealing. Kay Jewelers indicated that store morale, in\ngeneral,\nwas one of several causes for the inadequate store sales. It was not, as\nput forth by Simpson, an alternate reason for the demotion. Thus,\nviewing these claims in the light most favorable to Simpson, the evidence\ndoes not tend to discredit Kay Jewelers' articulated reasons.\n\n                               17\n\fPOLLAK, District Judge, concurring.\n\nI join the judgment and opinion of the court.\n\nI write separately merely to call attention to a legal\nquestion unresolved in this circuit that lurks unobtrusively\nin a footnote of the court's opinion. The question is whether\nthis circuit's conventional summary of the elements of a\nprima facie ADEA case of discriminatory discharge or\ndemotion is too narrowly stated insofar as it appears to\ncontemplate that the plaintiff must establish that she has\nactually been replaced by a significantly younger person.\nBecause appellant Simpson was in fact replaced by a\nsignificantly younger person, the question is of no moment\nin the present litigation, and there is, therefore, no present\nneed for this court to resolve it. But the question is one\nthat is likely to surface in some future ADEA case. So\nflagging the question now may serve to stimulate some\nuseful thinking by those interested in this field of law.\n\nIn footnote 5 the court outlines the \"three steps in the\nanalysis of pretext discrimination cases\" which must be\npursued \"[u]nder the McDonnell Douglas line of cases, as\napplied to the ADEA and the analogous provision of the\nPHRA.\" The footnote explains that the first of the three\nsteps consists of \"establish[ing] a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination,\" which a plaintiff accomplishes\"by showing\nthat she (1) is a member of the protected class, i.e. at least\n40 years of age, 29 U.S.C. S631(a), (2) is qualified for the\nposition, (3) suffered an adverse employment decision, and\n(4) in the case of a demotion or discharge, was replaced by\na sufficiently younger person to create an inference of age\ndiscrimination.\" In support of this four-phase formulation\nof a prima facie ADEA discharge or demotion case footnote\n5 cites Chipollini v. Spencer Gifts, Inc., 814 F.2d 893, 897\n(3d Cir.), cert. dismissed, 483 U.S. 1052 (1987). The citation\nis an apposite one: in Chipollini, an ADEA discharge case,\nthis court set forth essentially the same four-phase\nformulation.\n\nChipollini, in turn, derived the four-phase formulation\nfrom Maxfield v. Sinclair Intern., 766 F.2d 788, 793 (3d Cir.\n1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1057 (1986). In Maxfield this\ncourt adapted to ADEA discharge cases the Supreme\n\n                               18\n\fCourt's four-phase formulation in McDonnell Douglas Corp.\nv. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), of a prima facie Title VII case\nof racially discriminatory refusal to hire. Under McDonnell\nDouglas the plaintiff must, as an initial matter, establish:\n\"(i) that he belongs to a racial minority; (ii) that he applied\nand was qualified for a job for which the employer was\nseeking applicants; (iii) that, despite his qualifications, he\nwas rejected; and (iv) that, after his rejection, the position\nremained open and the employer continued to seek\napplicants from persons of complainant's qualifications.\"\n411 U.S. at 802. The Maxfield discussion of the elements of\na prima facie ADEA discharge case dealt with the question\nwhether the fourth phase required a showing that the\ncomplainant had been replaced by a person younger than\nforty -- i.e., a person not within the statutorily protected\nclass. This court rejected such a construction of the ADEA:\n\"we hold that an ADEA plaintiff may establish the fourth\nelement of the McDonnell Douglas test for a prima facie case\nby showing that s/he was replaced by a person sufficiently\nyounger to permit an inference of age discrimination.\" 766\nF.2d at 793.\n\nWhat should be noted is that what this court was called\non to decide in Maxfield was whether replacement by a\nsignificantly younger person within the protected class\ncould be regarded as tending to establish a prima facie case\nof discharge contravening the ADEA, and this court's\nanswer was in the affirmative. What the Maxfield court was\nnot called on to decide -- or at least was not expressly\ncalled on to decide -- was whether replacement by someone\nsignificantly younger is an indispensable ingredient of a\nprima facie ADEA discharge case, or whether, in a\ncircumstance in which the discharged plaintiff is not\nreplaced, other evidence can support a prima facie case. In\nthis connection it may be relevant that the Supreme Court\nin McDonnell Douglas did not require, as the fourth phase\nof a prima facie race-based-refusal-to-hire case, that the\nplaintiff establish the hiring of a non-minority person to fill\nthe job for which the plaintiff was rejected; rather, the\nCourt required the more limited showing that \"the position\nremained open and the employer continued to seek\napplicants from persons of complainant's qualifications.\"\n411 U.S. at 802.\n\n                               19\n\fThe language from McDonnell Douglas which has just\nbeen quoted may signify that the Maxfield/Chipollini\nformulation has (inadvertently) been crafted in overly\nnarrow terms. But that is not an obligatory inference. Race\ndiscrimination and age discrimination are sufficiently\ndifferent phenomena so that the elements of Title VII's\nregulatory regime may not be automatically transferable in\ntheir entirety to the ADEA context. And in the ADEA\ncontext many cases seem to reflect an expectation that an\nADEA discharge or demotion plaintiff will show\nreplacement, either achieved or anticipated. As the Second\nCircuit put the matter in Haskell v. Kaman Corp., 714 F.2d\n113, 119 n.1 (2d Cir. 1984): \"Under the McDonnell Douglas\nformula as applied in ADEA cases a plaintiff may make out\na prima facie case of age discrimination by showing that he\nbelongs to the protected group (40 to 70 years of age), that\nhe was sufficiently qualified to continue holding his\nposition, that he was discharged, and that his position\nthereafter was held by someone younger than himself or\nheld open for such a person.\" On the other hand, the Fifth\nCircuit has said, in Olitsky v. Spencer Gifts, 964 F.2d 1471,\n1478 n.19 (5th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 909\n(1993): \"In McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 799,\n802. . . . the Supreme Court formulated an evidentiary\nprocedure for race discrimination cases which has been\nadapted for ADEA cases. First the plaintiff must prove a\nprima facie case of age discrimination, which consists of\nevidence that the plaintiff: (1) was discharged; (2) was\nqualified for the position; (3) was within the protected class\nat the time of discharge; (4) was replaced by someone\noutside the protected class; or (5) by someone younger; or\n(6) show otherwise that his discharge was because of age.\"\n(The Fifth Circuit's Olitsky formulation has its origins in\nElliot v. Group Medical & Surgical Service, 714 F.2d 556,\n562 (5th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1215 (1984), a\nFifth Circuit case referred to by this court in Maxfield. See\n766 F.2d at 792.).\n\nDetermining whether the Fifth Circuit is closer to the\nmark than the Second Circuit may be postponed for\nanother day, since resolution of the question one way or\nanother can have no bearing on the present appeal. As\nnoted above, Ms. Simpson was in fact replaced by a\n\n                               20\n\fsignificantly younger person, and, accordingly, she was able\nto make out a prima facie case within the letter of Maxfield\nand Chipollini. The weakness of Ms. Simpson's case came at\na later stage. As the opinion of the court makes plain, the\nmagistrate judge and the district court correctly concluded\nthat her case on the merits was too insubstantial to survive\nKay Jeweler's motion for summary judgment.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               21\n\f",

In relevant part, the ADEA provides that\n\n        It shall be unlawful for an employer --\n\n        (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or\n        otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his\n        compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\n        because of such individual's age;\n\n        (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which\n        would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment\n        opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an\n        employee, because of such individual's age.\n\n29 U.S.C. S 623(a). In relevant part, the PHRA provides that\n\n        It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice . . . [f]or any\n        employer because of the . . . age . . . of any individual or\n        independent contractor, to refuse to hire or employ or contract\nwith,\n        or to bar or to discharge from employment such individual or\n        independent contractor, or to otherwise discriminate against such\n        individual or independent contractor with respect to compensation,\n        hire, tenure, terms, conditions or privileges of employment or\n        contract, if the individual or independent contractor is the best\nable\n        and most competent to perform the services required.\n\nPa. Stat.

We reject this\ncontention and hold that a plaintiff does not create an issue\nof fact merely by selectively choosing a single comparator\nwho was allegedly treated more favorably, while ignoring a\nsignificant group of comparators who were treated equally\nto her.\n\nSimpson also contends that pretext can be inferred from\nalleged inconsistencies between Kay Jewelers' proffered\nreasons and its actions. We also reject this contention and,\nfollowing Ezold v.

We therefore affirm.\n\nI.\n\nPlaintiff, Sandra Simpson, was an employee of Kay\nJewelers in the DuBois Mall in Clearfield County,\nPennsylvania. Kay Jewelers was a chain of retail jewelry\nstores, which was purchased by Sterling, Inc. in 1990.\nSimpson was originally hired as a bookkeeper in May,\n1973, and promoted to assistant manager in 1976. She was\npromoted to store manager in 1979, a position she held\nuntil her demotion in 1994.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1994, Simpson's forte was her individual\njewelry sales. The overall store sales, however, were\nconsidered deficient. Kay Jewelers set sales quotas for each\nof its stores, taking into account such factors as economic\nconditions, mall conditions, and competition. From\nSeptember 1991 to March 1994, Simpson's store satisfied\nits monthly store sales quota eight out of thirty-one\nmonths. During the fourteen months immediately prior to\nher demotion, it met quota three times. The district\nmanager repeatedly indicated on Simpson's evaluations\nthat she needed to improve her quota performance and\n\n                               3\n\fincrease store sales.2 The 1991, 1992, and 1994\nevaluations identified increased sales as \"major\ndevelopmental needs.\" The 1993 evaluation stated that\nSimpson needed to \"work to get 6/6 [quotas]\" and \"improve\n[store sales] to min of 103% [of planned sales].\" The district\nmanager repeatedly identified increased staff training, role\nplaying, and staff motivation as necessary to improve\noverall sales. The \"action plan for development\" in each\nevaluation from 1991 through 1994 listed the need for daily\nstaff training and role playing. At least twice, the district\nmanager told Simpson she would be demoted if she did not\nmeet the store sales quotas.\n\nIn March 1993, after Simpson failed to meet sales quotas\nin any of the preceding six months, the district manager\ncreated a Get It Done list (\"GID\"), which identified problem\nareas and defined \"action plans\" to correct the problems. In\nthe GID, the district manager stated that Simpson's\nperformance in areas other than store sales were basically\nup to standard, but that sales, the most important area,\nwas lacking. The district manager concluded that \"lack of\ntraining, direction, staffing, store moral[e], and aggressive\nsales efforts\" were the \"key reason[s] for the substandard\nsales production.\" Furthermore, the district manager\nrecommended that if \"compliance is not obtain[ed] and\nresults achieved that [Kay Jewelers] should consider a\nmanagement change (demotion, not termination).\" Id.\n\nAs part of the GID, Simpson was instructed to maintain\na sixty-day log of daily training sessions to be held with\neach employee. Simpson testified at her deposition that\ndaily training was held, but not with each employee each\nday. She also testified that some, but \"not a lot\" of role\nplaying was conducted. One of Simpson's employees\ntestified that she never received training through role\nplaying. Another employee testified that role playing was\nnot conducted on a daily basis. The store met its sales\nquotas for both months during the sixty-day period.\nHowever, from the end of the GID period through March\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. Simpson had two district managers during the period in question.\nWilliam Miller was district manager through August 1991. Mark Law was\ndistrict manager from August 1991 through March 1994.\n\n                               4\n\f1994, the store sales quotas were met only once out of the\nten months. In March 1994, the district manager\nrecommended that Simpson be demoted because of her\nunacceptable store sales and continuous failure to train\nand motivate staff to meet sales quotas. The\nrecommendation was approved by two Vice Presidents, and\nSimpson was demoted to sales associate at the age of 57.\nSimpson was replaced by Becky Bush, a 42 year old\nwoman.\n\nSimpson filed a claim with the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") in May 1994, alleging\nage discrimination. The EEOC determined there was no\nreasonable cause to believe that there was unlawful\ndiscrimination. Simpson then filed suit in the district court\nfor the Western District of Pennsylvania alleging\ndiscrimination in violation of the ADEA and PHRA. After\ndiscovery, Kay Jewelers moved for summary judgment. The\nmagistrate judge concluded that Simpson had failed to\nmake out a case of pretext, and recommended that\nsummary judgment be entered for Kay Jewelers. The\ndistrict judge adopted the magistrate judge's report and\ngranted Kay Jewelers' motion for summary judgment. This\ntimely appeal followed.\n\nThe district court exercised jurisdiction pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. SS 1331, 1367. We exercise appellate jurisdiction\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. S 1291 and our review of the district\ncourt's grant of summary judgment is plenary.

Under the McDonnell Douglas line of cases, as applied to the ADEA\nand the analogous provision of the PHRA, there are three steps in the\nanalysis of pretext discrimination cases. See McDonnell Douglas, 411\nU.S. at 802-04, 93 S.Ct. at 1824-25. First, the plaintiff must establish a\nprima facie case of discrimination. Hicks, 509 U.S. at 506, 113 S.Ct. at\n2746-47. This is done if she shows that she (1) is a member of the\nprotected class, i.e. at least 40 years of age, 29 U.S.C. S 631(a), (2) is\nqualified for the position, (3) suffered an adverse employment decision,\nand (4) in the case of a demotion or discharge, was replaced by a\nsufficiently younger person to create an inference of age discrimination,\nChipollini v. Spencer Gifts, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"485254\"><a href=\"/opinion/485254/anthony-j-chipollini-v-spencer-gifts-inc-a-delaware-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">814</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">893</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 897 (3d Cir. 1987).\nSecond, upon such a showing by the plaintiff, the burden shifts to the\nemployer to produce evidence of a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason\nfor the adverse decision. Hicks, 509 U.S. at 506-07, 113 S.Ct. at 2747.\nThird, the plaintiff must then demonstrate that the employer's\narticulated reason was not the actual reason, but rather a pretext for\ndiscrimination. Id. at 507; 113 S.Ct. at 2747.\n\nSimpson incorrectly defines the second step as shifting the burden to\nthe employer to show that its legitimate reason, alone, would have\ninduced the employment decision. Such a burden of showing that the\nsame decision would have been made absent discriminatory motives\napplies in Price Waterhouse mixed motive cases, not McDonnell Douglas\npretext cases.

We note, however, that Simpson's challenge to Kay Jewelers' proffered\nreason is misplaced to the extent she claims that the explanation is\ninvalid because there was no evidence that it was the actual reason for\nher demotion. In pretext discrimination cases such as this, \"[t]he\nemployer need not prove that the tendered reason actually motivated its\nbehavior, as throughout this burden-shifting paradigm the ultimate\nburden of proving intentional discrimination always rests with the\nplaintiff.\" Fuentes, 32 F.3d at 763 (emphasis added).\n\n                               7\n\freasons [such] that a reasonable factfinder could rationally\nfind them `unworthy of credence' \" and hence infer that the\nproffered nondiscriminatory reason \"did not actually\nmotivate\" the employer's action. Id. at 764-765 (quoting\nEzold, 983 F.2d at 531).\n\nTo show that discrimination was more likely than not a\ncause for the employer's action, the plaintiff must point to\nevidence with sufficient probative force that a factfinder\ncould conclude by a preponderance of the evidence that age\nwas a motivating or determinative factor in the employment\ndecision. Keller v. Orix Credit Alliance, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1101</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1111 (3d Cir. 1997). For example, the plaintiff may show\nthat the employer has previously discriminated against her,\nthat the employer has discriminated against other persons\nwithin the plaintiff's protected class or within another\nprotected class, or that the employer has treated more\nfavorably similarly situated persons not within the\nprotected class. Fuentes, 32 F.3d at 765.\n\nKay Jewelers asserts that Simpson was demoted because\nshe repeatedly failed to attain the store sales quotas and\nfailed to adequately train and motivate her staff to meet\nquotas. Simpson does not dispute her failure to attain the\nstore sales quotas or to adequately train her staff, but does\nmake numerous arguments in an attempt to both discredit\nthese reasons and show that discrimination was more likely\nthan not the motivating cause of her demotion. Simpson\nprimarily relies on the fact that Dolly Field, a younger\nmanager, was not demoted or fired.7 Simpson argues that\nshe and Field were similarly situated because their stores\nwere the same size, they were supervised and evaluated by\nthe same district manager, and their sales quotas took into\naccount the economics of store location.8 Simpson submits\nthat her performance was superior to Field's because in\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. Dolly Field became a store manager in 1991. She was 26 years old at\nthe time Simpson was demoted.\n\n8. Kay Jewelers argues that the two stores are not comparable, pointing\nto differences in mall occupancy rates, local competition, and store\nappearance. The district court assumed the stores were comparable. We\nwill not address the issue in light of the flaws in Simpson's arguments\ndiscussed infra.\n\n                               8\n\fboth 1993 and 1994 her evaluation scores for sales were\nhigher than Field's and both she and Field received an\noverall rating of \"good\".9 Simpson then claims that despite\nbeing evaluated superior to Field, Field was retained as\nmanager, while she was demoted; Field was praised, while\nshe was criticized; and Field received a higher score in\n\"store performance areas,\" a category Simpson argues is\ndirectly related to store sales. According to Simpson, this\nevidence of Field's more favorable treatment discredits Kay\nJewelers' proffered reasons and leads to the inference that\nage discrimination was more likely than not the motivating\ncause of her demotion. Simpson's reliance on Field is\nmisplaced for the reasons that follow.\n\nIII.\n\nFirst, Simpson's reliance on Field is misplaced because\nshe cannot selectively choose a comparator. The plaintiff\nhas the burden of demonstrating that similarly situated\npersons were treated differently. Burdine, 450 U.S. at 258,\n101 S.Ct. at 1096. The employer's actions are considered in\nlight of its actions towards the allegedly more favored\ngroup, in this case younger managers. Ezold 983 F.2d at\n527; McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804; 93 S.Ct. at 1825\n(employer may take adverse action, but only if based on\ncriteria applied to members of all races). However, the mere\nfavorable treatment of one younger manager as compared\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. The evaluation forms indicate that Simpson's overall scores were 38.2\nin 1993 and 35.8 in 1994, both equivalent to a \"needs improvement\"\nrating; whereas Field's scores were 40.3 and 40.5, respectively, both\nequivalent to a \"good\" rating. However, Simpson alleges that her overall\nscores, based on the unmodified version of her 1993 evaluation and the\ncorrection of an alleged error in the 1994 evaluation, were \"40\" in both\nyears, equivalent to a \"good\" rating. The original 1993 evaluation was\nmodified when the district manager reduced by two the points given to\nSimpson in the \"charge accounts\" category. The district manager\ncontends that the change was made because he erroneously awarded\npoints for performance that was actually below the corporate standard.\nSimpson alleges that the 1994 scoring for sales production was incorrect\nbecause her 90% performance in store sales versus planned sales should\nhave warranted two points within the category and an additional 3.8\npoints overall.\n\n                               9\n\fto one older manager may not be sufficient to infer age\ndiscrimination.\n\nThis is not to say that evidence of the more favorable\ntreatment of a single member of a non-protected group is\nnever relevant, but rather that the evidence can not be\nviewed in a vacuum. See Ezold, 983 F.2d at 539 (viewing\nrecord as a whole in finding insufficient evidence that\nplaintiff was treated more severely than her male\nassociates); Waldron v.

Bush, 990 F.2d at 931. As stated by the\ndistrict court, the plaintiff can not \"pick out one comparator\nwho was not demoted amid a sea of persons treated the\nsame as her\" to establish a jury question. Simpson v. Kay\nJewelers, No. 95-270J, mem. order at 2 (W.D. Pa. Mar. 18,\n1997) (footnote omitted).\n\nSimpson relies solely on Field as a comparator in arguing\nthat evidence of less favorable treatment gives rise to an\ninference of discrimination. She does not discuss any of the\nthirty-five other managers who, between 1992 and 1994,\nwere demoted to sales associate positions because of their\nstore sales performance.10 Of the thirty-five, all were\nyounger than Simpson and thirty-four were under the age\nof 40. Thus, even if Simpson was similarly situated to Field\nbut treated less favorably, see infra, Simpson's reliance on\na single member of the non-protected class is insufficient to\ngive rise to an inference of discrimination when Simpson\nwas treated the same as thirty-four members of the non-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10. Simpson incorrectly asserts that Kay Jewelers did not present any\nevidence as to the reason for these thirty-five demotions. An affidavit\nsubmitted by Kay Jewelers and Kay Jewelers' answers to Simpson's\ninterrogatories state that the thirty-five persons were demoted because of\nproblems with store sales. Simpson presents no evidence to the contrary.\n\n                               11\n\fprotected class. Simply stated, to show that Kay Jewelers'\nproffered reasons were pretext, Simpson can not pick and\nchoose a person she perceives is a valid comparator who\nwas allegedly treated more favorably, and completely ignore\na significant group of comparators who were treated equally\nor less favorably than she.\n\nIV.\n\nMoreover, even if Field were a proper comparator,\nSimpson's reliance on her would still be misplaced. In\ndetermining whether similarly situated nonmembers of a\nprotected class were treated more favorably than a member\nof the protected class, the focus is on the particular criteria\nor qualifications identified by the employer as the reason\nfor the adverse action.

Fuentes, 32 F.3d at 767. Compare Brewer, 72\nF.3d at 331-32 (finding that plaintiff's receipt of\nperformance bonus raised issue of fact as to whether\nemployer's performance-based explanation for discharging\nplaintiff was pretext) with Ezold, 983 F.2d at 528-29\n(finding that plaintiff's abilities in areas other than legal\nanalysis not relevant in determining if law firm's legal\nanalysis explanation for not promoting plaintiff was\npretext).\n\nSimpson relies completely on evaluation scores in\narguing that, as compared to Field, her allegedly superior\nperformance but less favorable treatment discredits Kay\nJewelers' proffered reasons for her demotion. Kay Jewelers,\nhowever, did not represent that it relied on evaluation\n\n                               12\n\fscores. Thus, Simpson's view of her performance, as\nmeasured by evaluation scores, is not relevant. Instead,\nfocusing on the stated criterion -- sales quotas-- Field's\nperformance was superior to Simpson's, a result Simpson\ndoes not dispute. Field met or surpassed her quotas six out\nof the fourteen months preceding Simpson's demotion;\nwhereas Simpson only met her quotas three out of the\nsame fourteen months.11 Accordingly, Simpson's evaluation\nevidence does not create a genuine issue of material fact.\n\nV.\n\nA.\n\nSimpson's other arguments are also inadequate to\nsurvive summary judgment. Simpson argues that the use of\nsales quotas as the criterion is suspect. She claims that\nusing performance on sales quotas is inconsistent with\nevaluation scoring, and points to the fact that despite Field\nhaving satisfied her sales quota more often than Simpson,\nField's evaluation scores in all sales criteria were equal to\nor below Simpson's. This, according to Simpson, counsels\nthat meeting sales quotas is not determinative of the\nadequacy of a manager's performance. Implicit in this\nargument is the contention that evaluation scores are more\nindicative of performance. Whether sales quotas or\nevaluation scores are a more appropriate measure of a\nmanager's performance is not for the court (or factfinder) to\ndecide. Healy, 860 F.2d at 1216 (\"our inquiry . . . is not an\nindependent assessment of how we might evaluate[an]\nemployee\"). \"The question is not whether the employer\nmade the best, or even a sound, business decision; it is\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11. We find no significance in Kay Jewelers' use of sales data from March\n1994, the same month Simpson was demoted, in arguing that Field was\nmore qualified for the position. Simpson was demoted on or about March\n29 and the decision to demote was made approximately one week earlier.\nThus, Simpson's March performance was not likely a factor in the\ndecision. Nonetheless, if we eliminate March 1994 from the equation,\nField still performed better than Simpson: Field met her quotas five out\nof thirteen months, whereas Simpson met her quotas three out of\nthirteen months.\n\n                               13\n\fwhether the real reason is [discrimination].\" Keller, 130\nF.3d at 1109 (quoting Carson v.

In Bray, we found that various\ndiscrepancies in how the employer evaluated the criteria\npurportedly relied on to promote a white person over the\nblack plaintiff, was sufficient to raise questions of fact as to\nthe employer's motives. 110 F.3d at 993-97 (finding\ndiscrepancies in the timing of employee evaluations, priority\ngiven to factors in ranking candidates, and interpretation of\noccupational grade levels, all of which were identified as\nreasons for not promoting plaintiff). Bray, however, is\nclearly distinguishable. In Bray the discrepancies were in\nthe use of criteria identified as determinative by the\nemployer, see id., whereas in this case Simpson is pointing\nto discrepancies between a criterion identified by Kay\nJewelers (sales quotas) and a criterion asserted only by\nSimpson (evaluation scores). As we have said, the focus is\non the criteria identified by the employer, not the criteria\nonly the plaintiff thinks are important. Healy, 860 F.2d at\n1216.12\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12. Simpson also asserts that the use of sales quotas is suspect because\nsome of the store managers purportedly demoted for failure to meet\nquotas were actually \"proficient\" at meeting their quotas. Simpson points\nto five managers who minimally met their store sales quotas fifty percent\nof the time (ten out of twelve times, five out of seven times, four out of\nsix times, seven out of twelve times, and three out of six times).\nIdentifying five out of thirty-five persons who performed substantially\nbetter than Simpson at meeting sales quotas does not reasonably lead to\nthe inference that Kay Jewelers did not rely on sales quotas in demoting\nSimpson. The issue is \"whether discriminatory animus motivated the\nemployer, not whether the employer [was] wise, shrewd, prudent, or\ncompetent.\" Fuentes, 32 F.3d at 765. Thus, this alleged contradiction,\nwhich may raise a question as to the wiseness of demoting those five\nmanagers, does not give rise to the inference that Kay Jewelers demoted\nSimpson for something other than the asserted nondiscriminatory\nreason. To the contrary, the fact that younger managers with superior\nperformance were demoted can be viewed as evidence that age was\nirrelevant.\n\n                               14\n\fB.\n\nSimpson argues that the district manager's failure to\nassist in training, and his interference with store\noperations, gives rise to an inference that the district\nmanager was seeking to obtain a predetermined result --\nher demotion -- for discriminatory reasons. Specifically,\nSimpson claims that the district manager failed to conduct\ntwo two-day training sessions as indicated on the GID,13\nwas not helpful when present at the store and on one\noccasion verbally berated the employees such that their\nmorale was low, and failed to provide Simpson with the\ndiscount codes necessary to offer merchandise discounts\ngreater than fifteen percent.\n\nTo the extent the inference can be made that the district\nmanager's behavior impacted the store's sales, the\nevidence, without more, does not rise to such a level that a\nfactfinder could reasonably conclude by a preponderance of\nthe evidence that Kay Jewelers acted with a discriminatory\nmotive. Cf. Bonura v. Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"473004\"><a href=\"/opinion/473004/43-fair-emplpraccas-173-40-empl-prac-dec-p-36352-frank-c-bonura/\"><span class=\"volume\">795</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">276</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. 1986) (finding sufficient evidence to\nuphold jury verdict for plaintiff allegedly discharged for\nsubstandard performance where evidence led to inference\nthat supervisor interfered with employee's efforts, as well as\nthat employee performed adequately and employer sought\nto hire younger persons).\n\nC.\n\nSimpson argues that the failure to train explanation is\ninconsistent with Kay Jewelers' actions. She asserts that if\ntraining had actually been important then the district\nmanager would have conducted the training sessions\npursuant to the GID, and the home office would have sent\na trainer to the store. Furthermore, Simpson points to the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13. It is not clear that Simpson is accurately viewing the facts. Simpson\nclaims the district manager was to conduct training sessions, however\nthe GID only indicates that the district manager was to visit the store,\nwhich may be interpreted as merely requiring the district manager to\nfollow-up on Simpson's efforts at training. Nonetheless, we resolve\nconflicting evidence in favor of Simpson.\n\n                                15\n\fabsence of any further counseling on training after her\nsuccessful completion of the GID. Viewing this evidence in\nthe light most favorable to Simpson,14 at most it leads to an\ninference that Kay Jewelers did not consider it important to\nassist Simpson in training her staff; it can not be inferred\nthat it was unimportant for Simpson to improve training on\nher own accord. The record is replete with evidence,\ncontrary to Simpson's assertion that there is no evidence,\nthat Kay Jewelers considered staff training important. From\n1991 to 1994, each of Simpson's evaluations indicated that\nshe needed to conduct more training. The GID specifically\nrequired training to be conducted on a daily basis.\nAccordingly, there is no basis from which to infer that the\nfailure to train explanation was \"unworthy of credence.\"15\nFuentes, 32 F.3d at 765. Simpson makes three additional\narguments, which we find completely without merit.16\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n14. Simpson contends she successfully completed the GID, but Kay\nJewelers argues that she did not implement all of the instructions on the\nlist.\n\n15. Simpson also claims that Kay Jewelers did not raise the failure to\ntrain explanation to the EEOC. Kay Jewelers' position statement to the\nEEOC states:\n\n       As a result of the Charging Party's declining performance level and\n       lack of responsive initiative . . . Charging Party was demoted from\n       Store Manager to full-time sales employee . . . based upon Charging\n       Party's failure to improve store sales. . . . [I]t was Charging\nParty's\n       responsibility to maintain . . . the sales of the entire store by\n       training, motivating and managing the store staff.\n\nAppendix at 731a. Even if this statement could be read as not\nspecifically indicating that Simpson's failure to train was a reason for\nher\ndemotion, it does not make Kay Jewelers' subsequent raising of the\nexplanation pretextual. \"[T]he mere fact that a defendant relies on a post\nhoc [explanation] does not in and of itself create a factual dispute about\nwhether the [explanation was] pretextual.\" Healy, 860 F.2d at 1215.

Kay Jewelers found\nthat Simpson was deficient in meeting her store sales quotas and in\ntraining her staff; Kay Jewelers did not rely on the evaluation scores or\nthe alleged stealing. Kay Jewelers indicated that store morale, in\ngeneral,\nwas one of several causes for the inadequate store sales. It was not, as\nput forth by Simpson, an alternate reason for the demotion. Thus,\nviewing these claims in the light most favorable to Simpson, the evidence\ndoes not tend to discredit Kay Jewelers' articulated reasons.\n\n                               17\n\fPOLLAK, District Judge, concurring.\n\nI join the judgment and opinion of the court.\n\nI write separately merely to call attention to a legal\nquestion unresolved in this circuit that lurks unobtrusively\nin a footnote of the court's opinion. The question is whether\nthis circuit's conventional summary of the elements of a\nprima facie ADEA case of discriminatory discharge or\ndemotion is too narrowly stated insofar as it appears to\ncontemplate that the plaintiff must establish that she has\nactually been replaced by a significantly younger person.\nBecause appellant Simpson was in fact replaced by a\nsignificantly younger person, the question is of no moment\nin the present litigation, and there is, therefore, no present\nneed for this court to resolve it. But the question is one\nthat is likely to surface in some future ADEA case. So\nflagging the question now may serve to stimulate some\nuseful thinking by those interested in this field of law.\n\nIn footnote 5 the court outlines the \"three steps in the\nanalysis of pretext discrimination cases\" which must be\npursued \"[u]nder the McDonnell Douglas line of cases, as\napplied to the ADEA and the analogous provision of the\nPHRA.\" The footnote explains that the first of the three\nsteps consists of \"establish[ing] a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination,\" which a plaintiff accomplishes\"by showing\nthat she (1) is a member of the protected class, i.e. at least\n40 years of age, 29 U.S.C. S631(a), (2) is qualified for the\nposition, (3) suffered an adverse employment decision, and\n(4) in the case of a demotion or discharge, was replaced by\na sufficiently younger person to create an inference of age\ndiscrimination.\" In support of this four-phase formulation\nof a prima facie ADEA discharge or demotion case footnote\n5 cites Chipollini v.

Under McDonnell\nDouglas the plaintiff must, as an initial matter, establish:\n\"(i) that he belongs to a racial minority; (ii) that he applied\nand was qualified for a job for which the employer was\nseeking applicants; (iii) that, despite his qualifications, he\nwas rejected; and (iv) that, after his rejection, the position\nremained open and the employer continued to seek\napplicants from persons of complainant's qualifications.\"\n411 U.S. at 802. The Maxfield discussion of the elements of\na prima facie ADEA discharge case dealt with the question\nwhether the fourth phase required a showing that the\ncomplainant had been replaced by a person younger than\nforty -- i.e., a person not within the statutorily protected\nclass. This court rejected such a construction of the ADEA:\n\"we hold that an ADEA plaintiff may establish the fourth\nelement of the McDonnell Douglas test for a prima facie case\nby showing that s/he was replaced by a person sufficiently\nyounger to permit an inference of age discrimination.\" 766\nF.2d at 793.\n\nWhat should be noted is that what this court was called\non to decide in Maxfield was whether replacement by a\nsignificantly younger person within the protected class\ncould be regarded as tending to establish a prima facie case\nof discharge contravening the ADEA, and this court's\nanswer was in the affirmative. What the Maxfield court was\nnot called on to decide -- or at least was not expressly\ncalled on to decide -- was whether replacement by someone\nsignificantly younger is an indispensable ingredient of a\nprima facie ADEA discharge case, or whether, in a\ncircumstance in which the discharged plaintiff is not\nreplaced, other evidence can support a prima facie case. In\nthis connection it may be relevant that the Supreme Court\nin McDonnell Douglas did not require, as the fourth phase\nof a prima facie race-based-refusal-to-hire case, that the\nplaintiff establish the hiring of a non-minority person to fill\nthe job for which the plaintiff was rejected; rather, the\nCourt required the more limited showing that \"the position\nremained open and the employer continued to seek\napplicants from persons of complainant's qualifications.\"\n411 U.S. at 802.\n\n                               19\n\fThe language from McDonnell Douglas which has just\nbeen quoted may signify that the Maxfield/Chipollini\nformulation has (inadvertently) been crafted in overly\nnarrow terms. But that is not an obligatory inference. Race\ndiscrimination and age discrimination are sufficiently\ndifferent phenomena so that the elements of Title VII's\nregulatory regime may not be automatically transferable in\ntheir entirety to the ADEA context. And in the ADEA\ncontext many cases seem to reflect an expectation that an\nADEA discharge or demotion plaintiff will show\nreplacement, either achieved or anticipated.

As\nnoted above, Ms. Simpson was in fact replaced by a\n\n                               20\n\fsignificantly younger person, and, accordingly, she was able\nto make out a prima facie case within the letter of Maxfield\nand Chipollini. The weakness of Ms. Simpson's case came at\na later stage. As the opinion of the court makes plain, the\nmagistrate judge and the district court correctly concluded\nthat her case on the merits was too insubstantial to survive\nKay Jeweler's motion for summary judgment.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               21\n\f</pre>",
