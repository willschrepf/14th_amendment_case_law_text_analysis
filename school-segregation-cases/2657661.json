(Super. Ct. No. JCF25781)\n\nJEREMY JAMES GODWIN,\n\n         Defendant and Appellant.\n\n\n         APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of Imperial County, Christopher\n\nJ. Plourd, Judge. Affirmed as modified.\n\n         Nancy J. King, under appointment by the Court of Appeal, for Defendant and\n\nAppellant.\n\n         Kamala D. Harris, Attorney General, Gerald A. Engler, Chief Assistant Attorney\n\nGeneral, Julie L. Garland, Assistant Attorney General, Eric A. Swenson, Kristine A.\n\nGutierrez, and Lynne G. McGinnis, Deputy Attorneys General.\n\f       Jeremy Godwin appeals from a judgment convicting him of various sex offenses\n\narising from his molestation of Jane Doe.1 He argues there is insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the jury's finding that he used duress to commit the molestation, and insufficient\n\nevidence that one of the alleged counts occurred. Further, he asserts the court erred by\n\n(1) allowing admission of the details of his prior sex offense conviction; (2) denying his\n\nmistrial motion based on stricken testimony that he fit the profile of a child molester; and\n\n(3) denying his posttrial request for disclosure of juror identifying information.\n\n       As to sentencing, defendant contends (1) the court erred in considering evidence\n\nthat was excluded at trial on Miranda2 grounds; (2) a $400,000 restitution award to the\n\nvictim must be reversed due to a violation of the Apprendi3 rule and insufficiency of the\n\nevidence, and (3) the trial court should have dismissed, rather than stayed, sentences\n\nimposed under the Habitual Sex Offender statute.\n\n       We find no reversible error except for defendant's challenge to his habitual sex\n\noffender sentences. Because the trial court sentenced defendant under the One Strike sex\n\noffender scheme, we agree the habitual sex offender sentences should be dismissed. We\n\nmodify the judgment to dismiss the habitual sex offender sentences, and as so modified\n\naffirm the judgment.\n\n\n\n\n1      We refer to the victim as Jane Doe to preserve her anonymity.\n\n2      Miranda v.

New Jersey (2000) 530 U.S. 466.\n\n                                              2\n\f                  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       Doe, age 20 at the time of trial, testified about numerous acts of molestation\n\ncommitted by her father (defendant) that started when she was a small child and\n\ncontinued until she was 13 years old.\n\n       Doe recalled an incident when she was \"really small\" when she and defendant\n\nwere riding in a vehicle in the desert and defendant placed his hand between her legs and\n\nwas \"playing with [her] vagina . . . through [her] clothes.\" Consistent with this memory,\n\nDoe's mother testified that when Doe was five years old, she told her mother that\n\ndefendant had been touching her \"down there,\" pointing to her vaginal area. The matter\n\nwas investigated; defendant was arrested; and in 1998 he pled guilty to committing a\n\nlewd act against Doe.4\n\n       Because of his 1998 lewd act conviction, defendant was removed from the family\n\nhome for four years; the family received counseling; and defendant reunited with the\n\nfamily in about January 2002. Doe's mother testified she did not divorce defendant at\n\nthis time because \"[t]here was doubt,\" explaining that defendant told her he did not\n\ncommit the molestation, \"everything was just misconstrued,\" and he only pled guilty so\n\nshe could be reunited with their children.\n\n       Doe recalled another incident that occurred when she was about nine years old and\n\nher brother was about three or four years old. On this occasion, Doe and her brother were\n\n\n\n4     At the current trial, Doe did not recall the events surrounding defendant's 1998\nconviction. We set forth the facts concerning this prior conviction in more detail below\nwhen describing the prior sex offense evidence admitted at trial.\n\n                                             3\n\fnot wearing clothes, she was on top of her brother, and her father was with them in the\n\nroom. She did not remember further details, except that her brother's penis and her\n\nvagina were somehow \"involved.\"\n\n       The remaining acts of molestation described by Doe occurred at the family's home\n\non Cedar Avenue where they moved in July of 2002 when Doe was almost 10 years old,\n\nand at the family's home on Walnut Avenue where they moved in November 2003 when\n\nDoe was 11 years old.\n\n       During an incident at the Cedar residence, Doe woke up in the middle of the night\n\non the couch, and defendant was \"making out\" with her, with his tongue in her mouth and\n\nhis arms around her. The incident made her feel \"uncomfortable.\" On another occasion,\n\ndefendant performed oral sex by putting his mouth on Doe's vagina.\n\n       During an incident at the Walnut residence, Doe woke up on her parents' bed, and\n\ndefendant was on top of her with his penis in her vagina. Doe felt \"very violated and\n\nvery upset.\" On another occasion he had her sit on top of a scanner and he scanned her\n\nvagina. On several occasions he woke her up so she could watch pornography with him.\n\nShe felt \"really uncomfortable\" watching the pornographic movies, but felt \"too afraid to\n\nsay no.\"\n\n       Also, on multiple occasions at the Walnut residence defendant had Doe give him\n\n\"blow jobs\" when they were in his bathroom. He tried to ejaculate in her mouth;\n\n\"usually, it ended up in a towel or some article of clothing\"; and on one occasion he\n\nejaculated \"out on [her] chest.\" This conduct made Doe feel \"gross,\" \"very\n\nuncomfortable,\" and disgusted.\n\n\n                                             4\n\f      During another incident defendant brought a dog into his bedroom and told Doe to\n\n\"get down on all fours\" because he wanted to \"put the dog on top of [her] and put the\n\ndog[']s penis in . . . somewhere.\" Doe refused, and defendant instead got \"on all fours\"\n\nand had the dog get on top of him. Doe felt \"really grossed out.\"\n\n      Doe recalled several other incidents of sexual molestation at the Walnut residence,\n\nincluding an incident in defendant's bedroom when he put vibrators on her vagina;\n\nanother incident in the bedroom when he put his finger in her vagina; and several\n\nincidents in the bedroom and living room when he would masturbate in front of her. Doe\n\ntestified she did not know whether defendant molested her \"every week or every month\"\n\nwhile they lived at the Walnut residence, but she knew it happened \"at least a few times\n\nin one month, and few can be anywhere from two to ten times.\"\n\n      Regarding her relationship with her father, Doe testified he was the primary\n\ncaregiver for her and her brother. Her mother was frequently gone from home at work\n\nand they were not emotionally close. When Doe was small, she and defendant were\n\n\"very close,\" and she loved him and he was like a friend to her. As Doe got older, she\n\ndid not feel as close to him; she did not know how to feel about him; and she knew that\n\nwhat was occurring was not right.\n\n      Doe did not recall defendant using physical discipline with her, but she testified\n\nshe was afraid of him when she was growing up because she was not \"sure what he could\n\ndo.\" She remembered an incident in which defendant tied her and her mother to the bed\n\nin his bedroom. Her father and mother engaged in loud arguments; there was a lot of\n\nshouting, slamming of doors, and slamming of hands on tables; and defendant was\n\n\n                                            5\n\fsometimes violent. For example, on one occasion he held her mother in a headlock and\n\non another occasion threw a chair. During the headlock incident, her mother yelled that\n\nDoe should call 911 and when Doe went to get the phone, defendant threw the phone.\n\n       Doe's mother confirmed that she was often gone from home at work, including at\n\nnight, and defendant took care of the children when she was not at home. Consistent with\n\nDoe's testimony, Doe's mother testified there was always a lot of pushing, shoving,\n\nthrowing of objects, and screaming between her and defendant, and during the incident\n\nwhen she asked Doe to call 911 defendant pulled the phone out of the wall and threw it.\n\n       Doe testified she did not know what to do about the molestation because defendant\n\nwas her father and she had been taught to respect her elders; she had never gone against\n\nhim because she was afraid of him; she did not know \"how to go about confronting the\n\nissue\"; and she was afraid to say anything to other adults because they knew her father\n\nand she was afraid there would be a \"back lash\" against her. She thought if she told\n\nsomeone, her father would find out and he would get in trouble or do something to hurt\n\nher, and people would think differently of her and not believe her.\n\n       When Doe was 14 years old, she finally told her father she would no longer\n\nengage in the sexual activity. This occurred when he asked her to go with him into the\n\nbedroom, which usually meant \"something would happen\"; she did not want to go; to try\n\nto coax her into the bedroom he grabbed her cat; she asked him for her cat back and hit\n\nhim in the back; and she then told him she was not going to \"do anything anymore\" and\n\nshe was \"done with that kind of thing.\" After this, defendant stopped molesting her. Doe\n\ngrew closer to her father again and felt safer, but in the back of her mind she worried and\n\n\n                                             6\n\fwas afraid the molestation would resume. She and her father did not talk about the\n\nmolestation but \"just swept it under the rug and pretended\" it was not there.\n\n       In 2008 or 2009, when Doe was about 16 or 17 years old, her mother moved out of\n\nthe family home because her parents were getting divorced. Doe was allowed to choose\n\nwhich parent to live with, and she chose to live with defendant. Doe testified she was\n\n\"very confused\" about what she should do; she \"just wanted to survive and be safe\"; and\n\nshe elected to live with defendant because the molestation had stopped and defendant was\n\nmore financially secure than her mother.\n\n       However, there was one more incident in September 2009. While Doe and\n\ndefendant were in the car in the desert, he masturbated in front of her. Doe \"looked away\n\nand pretended [she] wasn't there and tried to just get away from it mentally.\" She felt\n\n\"upset and disgusted.\" Because of this incident and because she and her father were\n\narguing a lot about her behavior, in October 2009 she moved in with her mother.\n\n       As Doe was growing up, she told a few people about the molestation, including\n\nher cousin, her high school boyfriend, and two close friends. Doe's cousin and boyfriend\n\ntestified to confirm the disclosure. In 2010, near the time when she was graduating from\n\nhigh school, Doe made a full disclosure during a long conversation with her high school\n\nboyfriend. During this time period she refused to continue visiting with her father, and\n\nafter an emotional confrontation with her parents during a child custody exchange in a\n\nparking lot, she asked her mother to contact the authorities so she could talk to them.\n\n       Doe testified she felt relieved after finally disclosing the molestation; when she\n\ndisclosed she was not living with her father and felt safer; but she still felt vulnerable\n\n\n                                              7\n\fbecause if her father \"really wanted to do something, he would find a way.\" A child\n\nsexual assault expert testified that delayed disclosure of sexual abuse is a typical\n\ndisclosure pattern for children.\n\n       Regarding the long-term psychological impact of the molestation, Doe testified, \"I\n\nhave tried to forget a lot of the things about what has happened . . . because it makes me\n\nfeel a lot of things that I don't want to feel.\" She explained: \"[I]t [is] very hard for me to\n\nfeel kind of normal, and I feel more like there [are] some aspects of my life that aren't\n\ngoing to be normal, like my sex life with whoever I get married to is not going to be\n\nnormal and that I am always going to have little triggers that make me remember what\n\nhappened and stress me out or make me cry. I find it hard to actually speak with\n\ncounselors about this kind of thing and people in general, but more so [with] counselors\n\nand therapists. I feel like I am very much going to have a lot of emotional and maybe\n\npsychological damage for the rest of my life from all of this.\"\n\nPrior Sex Offense Evidence\n\n       In January 1998, Detective William Crisp conducted a recorded one-hour\n\ninterview with defendant regarding the molestation allegation that resulted in his 1998\n\nconviction. When Crisp asked defendant why the molestation happened, defendant\n\nresponded he had an urge and he fought it all the time; it was a shameful act and he did\n\nnot talk about it to anyone; there were times when the opportunity arose and he could not\n\nstop himself; and after a \"certain point where once you are doing it, you just want to keep\n\ndoing it.\" Defendant told Crisp that the molestation occurred during two periods of time\n\nbetween October 1996 and December 1997; it happened about eight or nine times; and it\n\n\n                                              8\n\fincluded such activities as rubbing, caressing, inserting his finger in Doe's rectum,\n\nplacing his penis between her thighs up against her vagina, and ejaculation. Detective\n\nCrisp provided additional details concerning what defendant said during the interview,\n\nincluding about the nature of his relationship with his wife, further information about\n\nwhen and how the molestation occurred and his feelings about it, and the measures he\n\ntook to hide the sexual activity.\n\nDefense\n\n       The defense presented testimony from several witnesses (including a sheriff's\n\ndeputy, a social worker, and defendant's mother, brother, and girlfriend) who had contact\n\nwith Doe during her childhood. These witnesses variously testified that Doe never\n\nmentioned, and on occasion denied, any further molestation after defendant's 1998\n\nconviction, and they did not observe anything to suggest defendant was continuing to\n\nmolest Doe. The defense also called a psychiatrist who testified that unsubstantiated\n\nreports of child sexual abuse are more likely to occur when there are child custody\n\ndisputes.\n\nJury Verdict and Sentence5\n\n       For the incident with Doe and her brother, defendant was convicted of forcible\n\nlewd act on a child under age 14 between August 2000 and August 2002 (count 6). For\n\nthe incidents at the Cedar residence, defendant was convicted of (1) aggravated sexual\n\nassault on a child under age 14 and at least 10 years younger than the defendant (forcible\n\n\n5      Defendant was tried in two trials. At his first trial, the jury acquitted him of some\ncounts and deadlocked on others. At retrial, the jury convicted him as charged.\n\n                                              9\n\foral copulation in the bedroom, count 1), and (2) forcible lewd act on a child (kissing Doe\n\non the couch, count 3) between July 2002 and November 2003. For the incidents at the\n\nWalnut residence, defendant was convicted of (1) aggravated sexual assault (forcible oral\n\ncopulation in the bathroom, count 2), (2) two counts of forcible lewd act (penile/vaginal\n\npenetration, count 4, and ejaculation on the chest, count 5), and (3) child molestation with\n\na prior conviction (incident with the dog, count 7) between November 2003 and August\n\n2006.\n\n        The aggravated sexual assault by forcible oral copulation offenses (Pen. Code,6\n\n§§ 269, subd. (a)(4), 288a, subd. (c)(2); counts 1 and 2) and the various forcible lewd act\n\noffenses (§ 288, subd. (b)(1), counts 3 through 6) were premised on the theory that\n\ndefendant committed the offenses through the use of duress.\n\n        The jury also found true that defendant was convicted of a lewd act offense in\n\n1998 for purposes of a prior sex offense conviction allegation, One Strike sex offender\n\nallegation, habitual sex offender allegation, and prior strike allegation.\n\n        The trial court sentenced defendant to a term of 300 years to life, plus a\n\ndeterminate term of 34 years. The court's sentencing order included an award of\n\n$400,000 in direct victim restitution to Doe for her noneconomic losses.\n\n\n\n\n6       Subsequent unspecified statutory references are to the Penal Code.\n\n                                              10\n\f                                       DISCUSSION\n\n                               I. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n       Challenging his convictions of aggravated sexual assault and forcible lewd act\n\n(counts 1 through 6), defendant asserts the record does not support that he used duress to\n\ncommit the molestation. He also argues there is insufficient evidence to support the\n\noccurrence of the count 1 incident (oral copulation in the Cedar Avenue bedroom).\n\n       In reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we examine the entire\n\nrecord in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether there is\n\nsubstantial evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. (People v. Nelson (2011) 51 Cal.4th 198, 210.) It is the\n\nexclusive province of the jury to determine credibility and to resolve evidentiary conflicts\n\nand inconsistencies, and we presume in support of the judgment the existence of every\n\nfact the jury could reasonably deduce from the evidence. (Ibid.; People v. Young (2005)\n\n34 Cal.4th 1149, 1181.) If the circumstances reasonably justify the jury's findings,\n\nreversal is not warranted merely because the circumstances might also be reasonably\n\nreconciled with a contrary finding. (Nelson, supra, at p. 210.)\n\n                      A. Sufficiency of the Evidence To Show Duress\n\n       For purposes of child molestation offenses, duress means the defendant's \" 'use of\n\na direct or implied threat of force, violence, danger, hardship or retribution sufficient to\n\ncause a reasonable person to do or submit to something that he or she would not\n\notherwise do or submit to.' \" (People v. Soto (2011) 51 Cal.4th 229, 246, fn. 9, italics and\n\nbrackets omitted.) To determine the existence of duress, the totality of the circumstances\n\n\n                                              11\n\fshould be considered, including the age of the victim, the defendant's relationship to the\n\nvictim, and relative size and age disparities. (People v. Veale (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 40,\n\n46-49.) \" 'The very nature of duress is psychological coercion' \" (id. at p. 48), and in the\n\ncontext of child molestation \"it is the defendant's menacing behavior that aggravates the\n\ncrime . . . .\" (People v. Soto, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 243). A child under age 14 is\n\ndeemed legally incapable of giving consent, and accordingly evidence showing the\n\ndefendant's use of duress is not obviated by the fact that the child may have appeared to\n\nconsent. (Id. at pp. 245-246 [the child's consent or lack thereof is immaterial; the focus is\n\non the conduct of the defendant].)\n\n       There is sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding of duress. The sexual\n\nabuse started when Doe was a small child and continued until she was finally able to\n\nassert herself enough to confront defendant at age 14. Doe testified she found the activity\n\n\"gross,\" \"disgust[ing],\" and \"upset[ting],\" but she was too afraid of defendant to protest\n\nthe molestation, and she worried if she told someone he might hurt her. She explained\n\nshe did not know what he was capable of doing, and she described his volatile and at\n\ntimes violent behavior, including tying her mother and her to the bed, throwing a chair,\n\nholding her mother in a headlock and pulling the phone out of the wall.\n\n       The jury was entitled to credit Doe's claims that she feared her father because of\n\nhis demonstrated potential for violence, and she did not like the sexual activity but was\n\ntoo afraid to protest it. From this evidence, the jury could reasonably deduce that\n\nalthough defendant may not have overtly forced Doe to engage in the sexual activity, he\n\npsychologically coerced her by creating an atmosphere of fear within the family so that\n\n\n                                             12\n\fshe would be intimidated, compliant, and secretive about the sexual activity. This\n\nsupports a finding that defendant used duress to molest Doe.\n\n                       B. Sufficiency of the Evidence for Count 1\n\n       Defendant argues the record does not support the jury's finding that the count 1\n\nincident—involving an allegation of oral copulation in the Cedar residence bedroom—\n\nactually occurred.\n\n       Count 1 alleged that \"on or about\" between July 1, 2002 and November 19, 2003,\n\ndefendant committed oral copulation in the bedroom at the Cedar residence. During\n\ndirect examination of Doe, the prosecutor summarized the incidents described by Doe so\n\nfar in her testimony that occurred at the Cedar residence, and when he asked if she\n\nremembered anything else, Doe responded no. After refreshing her recollection by\n\nhaving her read a portion of her transcribed testimony at another proceeding, Doe\n\ntestified there was an incident at the Cedar residence when defendant \"was giving [her]\n\noral sex,\" explaining \"[h]is mouth was on my vagina.\" When the prosecutor asked where\n\nin the Cedar house this occurred, Doe responded \"I don't remember exactly where it was\n\nin the house.\"7\n\n\n\n7      The colloquy was as follows: \"[Prosecutor:] . . . [W]e just left off with refreshing\nyour recollection regarding an incident that occurred at . . . Cedar?\" [¶] [Doe:] Yes. [¶]\n[Prosecutor:] Can you explain to us what happened? [¶] [Doe:] There was a time when\nmy dad was giving me oral sex. [¶] [Prosecutor:] Okay. And when you say giving you\noral sex what do you mean by that? [¶] [Doe:] His mouth was on my vagina. [¶]\n[Prosecutor:] And where was this at? Where was [this] at in the house on . . . Cedar?\nDo you remember? [¶] [Doe:] I don't remember exactly where it was in the house. [¶]\n[Prosecutor:] And it was in the house? [¶] [Doe:] Yes. It was in the house. [¶]\n[Prosecutor:] You don't remember what house? [¶] [Doe:] No.\" (Italics added.)\n\n                                            13\n\f       Defendant asserts the testimony for count 1 was imprecise as to date and location.\n\nHe also cites Doe's initial failure to recollect the incident and a portion of her testimony\n\nsuggesting she did not remember at which house it occurred. He contends it is\n\nimpossible to distinguish count 1 from the other counts and to calculate whether the\n\ncharge was filed within the applicable statute of limitations period.\n\n       As to the dates of occurrence, Doe testified she was 10 years old when she lived at\n\nthe Cedar residence; they lived at the Cedar residence for about one year; and they moved\n\nto the Walnut residence when she was 11 years old. Doe's mother testified the family\n\nlived at the Cedar residence from July 2002 until November 2003. Based on Doe's date\n\nof birth in August 1992, she was 10 years old between August 2002 and August 2003.\n\nThis evidence, combined with Doe's testimony that there was oral copulation at the Cedar\n\nresidence, supports the allegation that oral copulation occurred during the approximate\n\ndates of July 2002 and November 2003, when Doe was about 10 years old, and when the\n\nfamily was living at the Cedar residence. (See People v. Jones (1990) 51 Cal.3d 294, 316\n\n[testimony identifying general timeframe when molestation occurred is sufficient].)\n\n       As to the location of the incident, Doe initially indicated it occurred at the Cedar\n\nresidence. The fact that she could not recall in which room it occurred does not defeat the\n\nsupport for a finding that defendant engaged in oral copulation with Doe at the Cedar\n\nresidence. Even though the information alleged the incident occurred in the bedroom, no\n\nsuch finding was needed to support the jury's verdict. Further, there was no possibility\n\n       We note the prosecutor's last question asking if she did not remember \"what\nhouse\" appears to be a nonsequitur, since the entire line of questioning was focused on an\nincident at the Cedar house.\n\n                                             14\n\fthe jury would convict on count 1 based on events associated with another count because\n\ncount 1 was the only allegation involving oral copulation at the Cedar residence between\n\nJuly 2002 and November 2003. The other allegations involved different locations, time\n\nperiods, and/or sexual acts.\n\n       Defendant's challenges based on Doe's initial inability to recollect the incident,\n\nand his claim that she did not know at which residence the incident occurred, are likewise\n\nunavailing. On appeal, we draw all inferences in favor of the judgment and\n\ninconsistencies in the evidence are not fatal to the verdict. (See People v. Young, supra,\n\n34 Cal.4th at p. 1181.) Doe's refreshed memory of the incident is sufficient to support a\n\nfinding that it occurred. Further, although there is brief testimony suggesting Doe did not\n\nremember at which house the incident occurred (see fn. 7, ante), her affirmative\n\nacknowledgement in another portion of her testimony that it occurred at the Cedar\n\nresidence supports the verdict on count 1.\n\n                       II. Admission of Prior Sex Offense Evidence\n\n       Defendant argues the court abused its discretion and deprived him of a fair trial\n\nwhen it admitted evidence concerning the facts of his 1998 lewd act conviction. He\n\nposits that even if his prior sex offense conviction was generally relevant under Evidence\n\nCode section 1108 to prove his propensity to commit sexual offenses, the court should\n\nhave admitted only the fact of his prior conviction and should not have permitted\n\n\"wholesale admission\" of the details underlying his conviction.\n\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\f                                      A. Background\n\n       Prior to trial, defendant offered to stipulate to the existence of his 1998 sex offense\n\nconviction, but requested that the court exclude evidence of the facts underlying the\n\nconviction on the grounds that they were unduly remote, highly inflammatory, and more\n\nprejudicial than probative. The trial court rejected his request, finding the evidence was\n\nhighly relevant under Evidence Code section 1108 to show he had a propensity to molest\n\nhis daughter and it was not unduly remote or prejudicial. The court noted that admission\n\nof only the sex offense conviction could suggest defendant merely engaged in a \"one-\n\ntime touching,\" whereas defendant's statements to Detective Crisp were extremely\n\nprobative to show his propensity to molest his daughter.\n\n                                    B. Governing Law\n\n       Evidence Code section 1108 sets forth an exception to the general rule against the\n\nuse of evidence of a defendant's misconduct apart from the charged offense to show a\n\npropensity to commit crimes. (People v. Villatoro (2012) 54 Cal.4th 1152, 1159-1160.)\n\nWhen a defendant is charged with a sex offense, Evidence Code section 1108 allows\n\nadmission of evidence of other sex offenses to prove the defendant's disposition to\n\ncommit sex offenses, subject to the trial court's discretion to exclude the evidence under\n\nEvidence Code section 352. (Evid. Code, § 1108, subd. (a); People v. Lewis (2009) 46\n\nCal.4th 1255, 1286.) Evidence Code section 1108 is premised on the recognition that sex\n\noffense propensity evidence is critical in sex offense cases given the serious and secretive\n\nnature of sex crimes. (People v. Falsetta (1999) 21 Cal.4th 903, 918 (Falsetta).) When\n\napplying Evidence Code section 1108 in a particular case, a defendant's fair trial rights\n\n\n                                             16\n\fare safeguarded by requiring the trial court to engage in a careful weighing process under\n\nEvidence Code section 352 to determine whether the probative value is substantially\n\noutweighed by the danger of undue prejudice, confusion, or time consumption. (Falsetta,\n\nat pp. 916-917.)\n\n       Based on Evidence Code section 1108, the presumption is in favor of the\n\nadmissibility of other sex offense evidence; however, the evidence should not be\n\nadmitted in cases where its admission could result in a fundamentally unfair trial.\n\n(People v. Loy (2011) 52 Cal.4th 46, 62; Falsetta, supra, 21 Cal.4th at p. 917.) When\n\nevaluating the other sex offense evidence, relevant factors include \"its nature, relevance,\n\nand possible remoteness, the degree of certainty of its commission and the likelihood of\n\nconfusing, misleading, or distracting the jurors from their main inquiry, its similarity to\n\nthe charged offense, its likely prejudicial impact on the jurors, the burden on the\n\ndefendant in defending against the uncharged offense, and the availability of less\n\nprejudicial alternatives to its outright admission . . . .\" (Falsetta, at p. 917.)\n\n       The Evidence Code section 352 \" 'determination is entrusted to the sound\n\ndiscretion of the trial judge who is in the best position to evaluate the evidence.' \"\n\n(Falsetta, supra, 21 Cal.4th at pp. 917-918.) On appeal we will not disturb the trial\n\ncourt's ruling unless the court exercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious, or\n\npatently absurd manner that resulted in a miscarriage of justice. (People v. Lewis, supra,\n\n46 Cal.4th at p. 1286.)\n\n\n\n\n                                               17\n\f                                        C. Analysis\n\n       In support of his claim that the trial court should have excluded the details of his\n\n1998 sex offense conviction, defendant argues the circumstances of the prior conviction\n\novershadowed the evidence of the current charges and there was a significant danger the\n\njury would convict him based on his prior misconduct rather than on the evidence\n\nconcerning the current charges. He contends the details of his prior sex offense\n\nconviction were highly inflammatory; of stronger evidentiary weight than the evidence of\n\nthe current charges; unduly remote; and likely to cause the jury to want to punish him for\n\nthe prior offense because he was allowed to return home after his conviction.\n\n       The trial court was not required to reach these conclusions. As set forth above, at\n\ntrial Doe's mother described Doe's disclosure of the molestation giving rise to the 1998\n\nconviction, and Detective Crisp provided a detailed description of defendant's recorded\n\nstatements admitting this molestation, describing how it occurred, and explaining the\n\ndifficulty he had in controlling his sexual urges toward his daughter. The court could\n\nreasonably conclude that these details were highly relevant to show that defendant had a\n\nstrong propensity to molest his daughter, which propensity evidence is expressly\n\nadmissible under Evidence Code section 1108. As found by the trial court, if the jury\n\nwas merely told that defendant had previously been convicted of molesting Doe, without\n\nthe details concerning the extent of the molestation and defendant's overpowering\n\npedophilic feelings towards his daughter, it would have been deprived of compelling\n\nevidence that supported the prosecution's charges that the molestation resumed once\n\ndefendant returned to the family home. Neither the prosecutor nor the court is required\n\n\n                                             18\n\f\"to accept a stipulation that would deprive the state's case of its evidentiary\n\npersuasiveness or forcefulness.\" (People v. Rogers (2013) 57 Cal.4th 296, 329-330;\n\nPeople v. McCurdy (2014) 59 Cal.4th 1063, 1100.)\n\n       The fact that the propensity evidence was of significant detriment to the defense\n\ncase does not render it unduly prejudicial. Undue prejudice does not exist merely\n\nbecause highly probative evidence is damaging to the defense case, but rather arises from\n\nevidence that uniquely tends to evoke an emotional bias against the defendant or cause\n\nprejudgment of the issues based on extraneous factors. (People v. Doolin (2009) 45\n\nCal.4th 390, 438-439.) This is not a case where the prior sex offense evidence was so\n\negregious as compared to the charged sex offenses that it might have caused the jury to\n\nconvict based on the prior offenses regardless of the evidence supporting the current\n\ncharges. The prior and current molestation evidence were of a similar nature, and the\n\ncourt reasonably found no undue prejudice arising from the highly relevant prior\n\nmolestation evidence.\n\n       Also, the evidence was not unduly remote. The record shows that the prior\n\nmolestation occurred when Doe was about four and five years old; thereafter defendant\n\nwas out of the family home for about four years; and when he returned to the home he\n\nquickly resumed the behavior by molesting Doe when she was about nine years old. This\n\nshows a continuity of misconduct by defendant that obviates any claim of remoteness.\n\n       Finally, we reject defendant's contention that the trial court failed to engage in the\n\nrequired careful weighing of probative value and the potential for prejudice. The record\n\nreflects the court understood its duty and weighed the evidence under Evidence Code\n\n\n                                              19\n\fsection 352. The court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the details of defendant's\n\nprior molestation of his daughter.\n\n                       III. Denial of Mistrial Based on Stricken Testimony\n\n                         that Defendant Fit Child Molester Profile\n\n       Defendant argues the court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial after\n\nDetective Crisp twice testified that defendant fit the profile of a child molester. Although\n\nthe court struck the testimony and admonished the jury to disregard it, defendant\n\ncontends the testimony so infected the trial with unfairness that its prejudicial impact\n\ncould not be cured.\n\n       While questioning Detective Crisp, the prosecutor asked if he remembered\n\ninterviewing defendant about the 1998 molestation allegation even though it has been\n\n\"quite some time\" since this occurred. Detective Crisp answered yes, explaining that the\n\ninterview was \"disturbing\"; his training in child molestation cases included learning\n\nabout child molester profiles; and throughout all of his other interviews he had never met\n\nsomeone who \"was the profile.\" Defense counsel objected, and the court sustained the\n\nobjection, struck the last answer, and instructed the jury to disregard it.\n\n       Thereafter, at the conclusion of his questioning on direct examination, the\n\nprosecutor asked Detective Crisp if there was anything else about the interview with\n\ndefendant that he remembered. Detective Crisp responded: \"I knew from . . . the first\n\nfew minutes of the interview, that he was fighting with himself whether to be there or not,\n\nwhether to answer my questions or not. And that's why I reassured him that it was\n\nvoluntarily. I want to use the words that I used earlier that were thrown out, but he fit the\n\n\n                                              20\n\fprofile.\" Defense counsel objected and moved to strike the testimony, and the court\n\nresponded, \"Same ruling. The jurors are asked to disregard that last portion.\"\n\n       Defendant thereafter moved for a mistrial based on the jury hearing the stricken\n\ntestimony that he fit the profile of a child molester. The court denied the motion, finding\n\nthe stricken comments did not affect the fairness of the trial, and told defense counsel that\n\nupon request it would give a pinpoint instruction reminding the jurors the testimony was\n\nstricken and they should disregard it.\n\n       \" 'A mistrial should be granted if the court is apprised of prejudice that it judges\n\nincurable by admonition or instruction. . . . Whether a particular incident is incurably\n\nprejudicial is by its nature a speculative matter, and the trial court is vested with\n\nconsiderable discretion in ruling on mistrial motions. . . .' [Citation.] A motion for a\n\nmistrial should be granted when ' \" 'a [defendant's] chances of receiving a fair trial have\n\nbeen irreparably damaged.' \" ' \" (People v. Collins (2010) 49 Cal.4th 175, 198.)\n\n       The record here shows no abuse of discretion or deprivation of a fair trial based on\n\nthe trial court's denial of the mistrial motion. The jury was repeatedly told to disregard\n\nany stricken testimony, and it was given a special pinpoint instruction to remind them to\n\ndisregard Detective Crisp's stricken testimony. During the instructions at the beginning\n\nof trial, the jury was told: \"If I order testimony stricken from the record, you must\n\ndisregard it and must not consider that testimony for any purpose.\" When Detective\n\nCrisp made the two statements that defendant fit a child molester profile, the court\n\nimmediately sustained defense counsel's objections, struck the testimony, and told the\n\njury to disregard it. During the instructions just prior to deliberations, the court again told\n\n\n                                              21\n\fthe jury: \"During the trial, the attorneys may have objected to questions or moved to\n\nstrike answers given by the witnesses. . . . If I ordered testimony stricken from the\n\nrecord, you must disregard it and must not consider it for any purpose.\" Further[,] at this\n\njuncture the court gave the special pinpoint instruction stating: \"During the testimony of\n\nprosecution witness [r]etired Detective Brad Crisp, I ordered portions of the testimony\n\nstricken from the record. You must disregard those portions of testimony and must not\n\nconsider that testimony for any purpose.\" We presume the jurors followed these repeated\n\nadmonitions to disregard stricken testimony. (People v. Cox (2003) 30 Cal.4th 916, 961.)\n\n       We are not persuaded by defendant's contention that Detective Crisp's statements\n\nthat defendant fit a child molester profile were so prejudicial that the effect of the\n\ntestimony could not be cured. The trial court could reasonably assess that given the\n\nevidence properly presented to the jury, the profile statements were of minor significance.\n\nThe jury knew that defendant had admitted to molesting Doe when she was about five\n\nyears old, and heard detailed testimony to support that he resumed the molestation when\n\nDoe was about nine to 13 years old upon his return to the family home. Thus, the jury\n\nwas presented with extensive evidence showing defendant's pattern of ongoing\n\nmolestation. Further, this is not a case where the jury was exposed to a lengthy\n\ndelineation of inadmissible profile evidence. (See, e.g., People v. Robbie (2001) 92\n\nCal.App.4th 1075, 1081-1084.) Rather, Detective Crisp's references to a child molester\n\nprofile were brief and nondescriptive, and the jury was quickly admonished not to\n\nconsider them.\n\n\n\n\n                                              22\n\f       Although Detective Crisp's repeat of testimony that had been stricken is not to be\n\ncondoned, the trial court reasonably concluded that his passing references to defendant\n\nfitting a child molester profile did not undermine the fairness of defendant's trial.\n\n             IV. Posttrial Denial of Request for Juror Identifying Information\n\n       Defendant asserts the trial court erred by denying his posttrial request for\n\nidentifying information for the jurors so his counsel could investigate whether the jury\n\nwas impacted by juror misconduct.\n\n                                       A. Background\n\nQuestioning of Juror No. 4 During Jury Deliberations\n\n       After the first day of jury deliberations (a Friday) and when the jury had been\n\ndismissed for the weekend, two jurors stayed behind in court, indicating that they wanted\n\nto talk to the court. The court instructed the bailiff to tell them to put their concerns in\n\nwriting. Each juror wrote the court a note, stating that Juror No. 4 had overheard the\n\nvictim speaking to others in the hallway; Juror No. 4 was having difficulty being\n\nobjective; and although Juror No. 4 was \"trying his best to be honest [and] fair\" he was\n\nfinding it hard to \" 'unring the bell.' \"8 The court told counsel it would thank the two\n\njurors for the notes and dismiss them for the weekend, and when the proceedings\n\nresumed it would question Juror No. 4 to determine if he \"has been compromised.\"\n\n\n8      One note said: \"During deliberations Juror 4 (I believe) had overheard [Doe]\nspeaking to others in the hall during the trial. Now he is having difficulty, it seems, being\nobjective with the facts of what he heard. He is trying his best to be honest and fair but\nhas used the term 'finding it hard to unring the bell' when talking about it.\" The other\nnote said: \"One of the jurors has admitted to overhearing the victim speaking about the\ncase in the hallway. He is struggling to remain objective during deliberation.\"\n\n                                              23\n\fDefense counsel responded that he would like the court to also \"inquire whether the\n\njurors have been tainted if he made any comments other than he can't be fair.\" The court\n\nstated it was \"reluctant to get any detail, especially at this juncture.\"\n\n       When the proceedings resumed on Monday, the court told counsel it would\n\nquestion Juror No. 4, and counsel could submit any questions to the court that they\n\nwanted the court to ask. When Juror No. 4 was brought into the courtroom, the court told\n\nhim that it had received information that he may have \"overheard something by . . . [Doe]\n\nin the hallway,\" and asked if this was true. Juror No. 4 said that when he walked out of\n\nthe jury room to get some water, he heard \"one of the persons say, 'You should say this\n\nbecause he's going to say this.' \" Juror No. 4 then \"turned right back around and went\n\ninside.\" The court asked, \"So is that basically the extent of what you heard?\" and Juror\n\nNo. 4 answered yes. The court pointed out that the instructions tell the jurors to disregard\n\nanything they might hear from a party or witness other than when court is in session, and\n\nasked Juror No. 4 if he was \"having any trouble disregarding it.\" Juror No. 4 responded,\n\n\"No, not at all.\" Satisfied with this response, the court directed the jury to resume\n\ndeliberations, including Juror No. 4.\n\n       The court told counsel that in its view the inquiry was sufficient; Juror No 4 was\n\nnot troubled by what he inadvertently overheard and was following the instruction to\n\ndisregard it; the court did not believe it was \"in any . . . way affecting the jury\"; and if it\n\ndid affect the jury it would be to the prosecution's detriment by suggesting someone was\n\ntelling the complaining witness to say certain things that might not be true. When the\n\ncourt asked if there was any motion or other action it should take, both the prosecutor and\n\n\n                                               24\n\fdefense counsel responded no. Defense counsel elaborated, \"It just appears from Juror\n\nNumber 4's statement that he didn't hear the substance of what was indicated. So I agree\n\nwith the Court. I believe he can be fair.\"\n\nPosttrial Request for Juror Identifying Information\n\n       After the jury returned its guilty verdict, defense counsel filed a motion requesting\n\ndisclosure of the jurors' addresses and telephone numbers so he could interview them and\n\ndetermine if there were grounds for a new trial motion based on the juror misconduct\n\nreflected in the two notes from the jurors concerning Juror No. 4. Defense counsel stated\n\nit was never established who instructed Doe regarding what Doe should say, and he\n\nneeded to interview the jurors to ascertain \"exactly what transpired in the jury room,\"\n\nincluding information about how adamant Juror No. 4 was that he could not be fair,\n\nexactly what he told the other jurors he overheard, and how his statements impacted the\n\nability of each juror and the jury as a whole to be fair.\n\n       The court denied the motion for release of juror identifying information, finding\n\ndefendant had not made a prima facie showing of good cause for disclosure. The court\n\nstated its questioning of Juror No. 4 revealed no juror misconduct had occurred, and the\n\n\"vague non-specific suppositions\" of the other two jurors were \"effectively put to rest\" by\n\nthe court's questioning of Juror No. 4, whom the court found to be credible. Further,\n\ndefense counsel had the opportunity to submit questions to Juror No. 4, acknowledged\n\nthat Juror No. 4 had not heard any substantive information, agreed that Juror No. 4 could\n\nbe fair, and did not request further inquiry or that Juror No. 4 be removed.\n\n\n\n\n                                              25\n\f                                      B. Relevant Law\n\n       To protect a juror's right to privacy, a court is not allowed to release juror\n\nidentifying information unless specific statutory requirements have been satisfied. (See\n\nPeople v. Carrasco (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 978, 989-990.) The defendant must make a\n\nprima facie showing of good cause for disclosure, and if this requirement is met and there\n\nis no compelling reason against disclosure, the court must set the matter for a hearing\n\nwhere jurors can protest the disclosure. (Code Civ. Proc., § 237, subds. (b), (c).) To\n\nmeet the initial prima facie burden, the defendant must make a \" 'sufficient showing to\n\nsupport a reasonable belief that jury misconduct occurred, . . . and that further\n\ninvestigation is necessary to provide the court with adequate information to rule on a\n\nmotion for new trial.' \" (Carrasco, supra, at p. 990; Code Civ. Proc., § 206, subd. (g); see\n\nPeople v. Johnson (2013) 222 Cal.App.4th 486, 497.)\n\n       The right to an impartial jury requires that the jury decide the case solely on the\n\nevidence adduced at trial and that it not be influenced by any extrajudicial\n\ncommunications. (People v. Cissna (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 1105, 1115.) The existence\n\nof juror misconduct, including the inadvertent receipt of extrajudicial information, creates\n\na rebuttable presumption of prejudice; the presumption is rebutted if the record shows\n\n\" 'there is no substantial likelihood that any juror was improperly influenced to the\n\ndefendant's detriment.' \" (People v. Gamache (2010) 48 Cal.4th 347, 397-398; In re\n\nHamilton (1999) 20 Cal.4th 273, 295-296.) The likelihood of juror bias must be\n\nsubstantial; the courts do not reverse a jury verdict merely because there is some\n\n\n\n\n                                              26\n\fpossibility a juror was improperly influenced. (People v. Danks (2004) 32 Cal.4th 269,\n\n305.)\n\n        If the record shows that investigation of alleged juror misconduct would not reveal\n\nanything prejudicial, the trial court may deny the petition for disclosure of juror\n\nidentifying information. (People v. Box (2000) 23 Cal.4th 1153, 1222-1223.) On appeal,\n\nwe defer to the court's credibility resolutions and review the court's disclosure ruling\n\nunder the deferential abuse of discretion standard. (People v. Pride (1992) 3 Cal.4th 195,\n\n260; People v. Carrasco, supra, 163 Cal.App.4th at p. 991.)\n\n                                        C. Analysis\n\n        Here, two jurors told the court that Juror No. 4 heard communications with Doe in\n\nthe hallway, and although he was trying to be fair, he was struggling to be objective. The\n\ntwo reporting jurors did not indicate that Juror No. 4 had told any jurors the contents of\n\nwhat he overheard, and the two jurors made no suggestion that they, or any other jurors,\n\nhad been exposed to information that affected their impartiality. Rather, their sole\n\nconcern was with the difficulties of Juror No. 4. When the court questioned Juror No. 4,\n\nhe assured the court he had disregarded the statements he had heard, and the court\n\ncredited this assurance. When the court asked counsel if they wanted the court to do\n\nanything further, both counsel responded no, and defense counsel explicitly stated he\n\nthought Juror No. 4 could be fair.\n\n        From the information received from the two jurors who reported their concerns\n\nand the questioning of Juror No. 4, the trial court could reasonably assess that Juror No. 4\n\nwas not exposed to anything that ultimately overwhelmed his ability to be impartial. The\n\n\n                                             27\n\fcourt could deduce that the difficulties observed on Friday by the two reporting jurors\n\nwere resolved by Juror No. 4 (who was reportedly trying hard to be impartial) by the time\n\nthe court questioned him on Monday. This is supported by the fact that neither the\n\nprosecutor nor defense counsel expressed any concerns about Juror No. 4 after the court\n\nquestioned him.\n\n       As to the matter of the jury's impartiality as a whole, the court could consider that\n\nif Juror No. 4 had conveyed any information to the other jurors that might have affected\n\ntheir ability to be fair, the two reporting jurors would have apprised the court of this\n\nconcern given the diligence with which they reported their concerns about Juror No. 4.\n\nThe failure of the two reporting jurors to raise any concerns about the impartiality of the\n\njury as a whole supports that Juror No. 4's statements to the jury had no effect on anyone\n\nbut him. This conclusion is supported by the fact that although defense counsel initially\n\nrequested that the court inquire about the impact on the other jurors, he did not renew this\n\nrequest after the court questioned Juror No. 4. Although defense counsel filed a posttrial\n\nmotion seeking to further explore the matter, his failure to raise any concerns at the time\n\nJuror No. 4 was questioned suggests that Juror No. 4's demeanor and responses satisfied\n\nhim that there had been no impact on the impartiality of the jury.\n\n       Although additional questioning of Juror No. 4 and/or other jurors would have\n\nbeen helpful to create a more complete record, the court and counsel's handling of the\n\nmatter revealed sufficient information to rebut the presumption of prejudice arising from\n\nJuror No. 4's exposure to extrajudicial information. The court reasonably found that\n\ndefendant did not make a prima facie showing of prejudicial juror misconduct, and\n\n\n                                             28\n\faccordingly did not abuse its discretion in denying the request for disclosure of juror\n\nidentifying information.\n\n                                   V. Sentencing Issues\n\n            A. Sentencing Court's Consideration of Evidence Excluded at Trial\n\n                                    on Miranda Grounds\n\n        Defendant argues that when making its sentencing decisions, the court erred by\n\nconsidering his pretrial admission that he molested his daughter, which had been\n\nexcluded from the prosecution's case-in-chief on Miranda grounds.\n\n                                      1. Background\n\n        Prior to trial, defendant moved to exclude a correctional officer's testimony about\n\nan admission that defendant made when he was arrested in 2010 for the current charges\n\nand brought to jail for booking. According to the correctional officer, during a routine\n\nbooking inquiry about the reason for defendant's arrest (designed to determine whether an\n\ninmate should be segregated for safety reasons), defendant said he was arrested for\n\nmolesting his daughter. As the officer continued to inquire about what happened and\n\nwhether defendant did it, defendant told the officer that the charges were true and he\n\nprovided details until the officer became upset and told defendant not to tell him anything\n\nmore.\n\n\n\n\n                                             29\n\f       The prosecution conceded the evidence was inadmissible in the prosecution's case-\n\nin-chief because defendant had earlier invoked his Miranda right to silence and he was\n\nnot provided additional Miranda warnings when he made the admission.9\n\n       At sentencing after the jury's guilty verdict—for purposes of evaluating the\n\ncredibility of defendant's mother's claim at the sentencing hearing that defendant had\n\nnever molested Doe—the court stated it would consider the correctional officer's\n\nstatement that defendant admitted molesting Doe when he was booked for the current\n\ncharges. While addressing the court at sentencing, defendant's mother stated that when\n\ndefendant pled guilty in 1998 he \"took the fall in order to keep his family together,\"\n\nexplaining that he pled guilty so his children would be taken out of foster care and\n\nreturned to his wife, charges which had also been filed against his wife would be\n\ndismissed, and his wife (who was not a citizen) would not be deported. Defendant's\n\nmother maintained that Doe's mother was responsible for the molestation charges against\n\ndefendant, and in support raised a variety of claims concerning the bad character of Doe's\n\nmother and her influence on Doe.\n\n       After hearing the statements from defendant's mother and other individuals, the\n\ncourt said that it would consider defendant's excluded admission to the correctional\n\nofficer solely for purposes of evaluating the credibility of defendant's mother's claim that\n\ndefendant never molested Doe. The court emphasized that when evaluating the crimes of\n\n\n9     The correctional officer's testimony about defendant's non-Mirandized admissions\nwas presented during an Evidence Code section 402 hearing at defendant's first trial, at\nwhich time the court excluded the testimony. At defendant's second trial, the prosecutor\nconceded the evidence was inadmissible.\n\n                                             30\n\fwhich defendant was convicted by the jury, it would not consider the non-Mirandized\n\nadmission but would only consider the evidence presented at trial.\n\n       Thereafter, the court explained at length the reasoning underlying its sentencing\n\ndecisions. The court rejected the claim that defendant pled guilty in 1998 to protect his\n\nwife from being prosecuted. The court stated it was \"very clear\" from defendant's\n\nvarious statements (including to Detective Crisp, a mental health professional, and a\n\nprobation officer) that he committed the molestation charged in the 1998 case; during this\n\ntime period defendant explained his inability to control his urges and he requested and\n\nreceived mental health treatment; and he served about eight months in jail and was\n\neventually reunited with his family. When defendant returned to his family, he resumed\n\nthe molestation, committing it on multiple occasions; the jury convicted him of seven\n\nseparate offenses; and the offenses were \"horrific acts by somebody who was clearly and\n\nunquestionably a child molester, who could not or would not be helped . . . .\"\n\n       The court elaborated that although defendant's family members may believe he is\n\nnot a child molester, it was clear to the court that defendant \"molested his own daughter\n\nrepeatedly, that he did it over a significant period of time in different locations, that he\n\nknew what he was doing, he planned out many of them, not all of them, and he did it\n\nrepeatedly for his own sexual gratification . . . . [¶] . . . [H]e just chose not to seek help,\n\nwhich he was very well aware of, he knew where he could get it. . . . He chose instead to\n\nrevictimize [Doe] over again . . . . [¶] The nature of the molestations was horrific, and\n\nthere was even testimony of an animal involved, and it just doesn't get worse than the\n\nconduct [defendant] engaged in in this particular case. [¶] Each of the facts that were\n\n\n                                              31\n\ffound true by the jury that the Court is going to sentence on, they were all separate. . . .\n\n[¶] So the acts that the jury found true beyond a reasonable doubt were just one of many\n\nthat he engaged in for a period of many, many years. [¶] I do find that given all the\n\nevidence in the case, including the statements made by [defendant] in the 1998 case that\n\nwere admitted before the jury in this trial, as well as considering all of the evidence that\n\nwas presented during the course of the trial including the victim's testimony, that the acts\n\nwere committed. [¶] . . . The victim was very credible as far as her telling what she could\n\nabout when they occurred. [¶] She testified as to each of the actions. She had made\n\ndisclosures to people early on. And she ultimately made disclosures and reported it to\n\nlaw enforcement when she became older and was able to detail those out in more\n\nparticularities.\" (Italics added.)\n\n       The court set forth additional matters concerning the case, including a statutory\n\nrequirement that it impose consecutive sentences, and ultimately imposed a term of 300\n\nyears to life plus a 34-year determinate term.\n\n                                         2. Analysis\n\n       Assuming, without deciding, that at sentencing the court could not properly\n\nconsider defendant's non-Mirandized admission to the correctional officer, the record\n\nshows defendant's incriminating statements to the correctional officer were of minimal\n\nconsequence at the sentencing hearing; hence, any error was harmless beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt. (People v. Thomas (2011) 51 Cal.4th 449, 498 [harmless beyond a\n\n\n\n\n                                              32\n\freasonable doubt standard applies to Miranda error at penalty phase of capital case].)10\n\nThe court emphasized that it was considering the non-Mirandized admission for the\n\nnarrow purpose of evaluating the credibility of defendant's mother's belief that defendant\n\nwas innocent. When the court explained the reasoning underlying its sentencing\n\ndecisions, it focused on the evidence presented at trial and other matters properly before\n\nit. The court delineated its view of the trial evidence, found Doe to be credible, and\n\nconcluded defendant's guilt was clearly established.\n\n       We have no doubt the court's sentencing decision would have been the same even\n\nwithout consideration of defendant's admission to the correctional officer. There is no\n\nbasis for reversal of the sentence on this ground.11\n\n                   B. Challenges to $400,000 Victim Restitution Award\n\n       Section 1202.4 requires the trial court, in conjunction with sentencing, to order the\n\ndefendant to pay restitution to the victim to compensate the victim for economic loss\n\nsuffered as a result of the defendant's conduct. (§ 1202.4, subd. (f).) Further, when (as\n\nhere) a defendant is convicted of violating section 288 (lewd act on a child), the court is\n\n\n\n\n10     Although we need not decide the issue, we note there is case authority indicating a\nsentencing court in a noncapital case may in some circumstances properly consider a\ndefendant's non-Mirandized statements. (United States v. Graham-Wright (6th Cir. 2013)\n715 F.3d 598, 601-604; People v. Petersen (1972) 23 Cal.App.3d 883, 896; see generally\nWhite v. Woodall (2014) __ U.S. __ [134 S.Ct. 1697, 1703] [although privilege against\nself-incrimination applies at penalty phase, it may not apply in the same manner as at\nguilt phase].)\n\n11    Given our holding, we need not evaluate the People's contention of forfeiture\nconcerning this issue.\n\n                                             33\n\frequired to include noneconomic losses in the victim restitution award. (§ 1202.4, subd.\n\n(f)(3)(F).)12\n\n       On appeal, defendant raises an Apprendi challenge to the victim restitution award,\n\nand contends the amount of the award is unsupported by the record and excessive.\n\n                                   1. Apprendi Challenge\n\n       Defendant argues the victim restitution award to Doe for her noneconomic losses\n\nviolated his jury trial rights under Apprendi because the trial court, not the jury, made the\n\nfindings concerning the award.\n\n       Under Apprendi and its progeny, a defendant has the right to have the jury, not the\n\ntrial court, decide any facts that increase the defendant's punishment beyond the\n\nmaximum punishment that could otherwise be imposed based on the jury verdict alone.\n\n(Alleyne v. United States (2013) 133 S.Ct. 2151, 2158, 2160 (Alleyne); Southern Union\n\n\n12        Section 1202.4 states in relevant part: \"(a) . . . [¶] (3) The court, in addition to\nany other penalty provided or imposed under the law, shall order the defendant to\npay . . . the following: [¶] . . . (B) Restitution to the victim or victims, if any, in\naccordance with subdivision (f), which shall be enforceable as if the order were a civil\njudgment. . . . [¶] . . . (f) . . . in every case in which a victim has suffered economic loss\nas a result of the victim's conduct, the court shall require that the defendant make\nrestitution to the victim or victims in an amount established by court order, based on the\namount of loss claimed by the victim or victims or any other showing to the court. If the\namount of loss cannot be ascertained at the time of sentencing, the restitution order shall\ninclude a provision that the amount shall be determined at the direction of the court. . . .\n[¶] (1) The defendant has the right to a hearing before a judge to dispute the\ndetermination of the amount of restitution. . . . [¶] . . . . (3) To the extent possible, the\nrestitution order shall be prepared by the sentencing court, shall identify each victim and\neach loss to which it pertains, and shall be a dollar amount that is sufficient to fully\nreimburse the victim or victims for every determined economic loss incurred as the result\nof the defendant's criminal conduct, including, but not limited to, all of the following:\n[¶] . . . . (F) Noneconomic losses, including, but not limited to, psychological harm, for\nfelony violations of Section 288.\"\n\n                                              34\n\fCompany v. U.S. (2012) 132 S.Ct. 2344, 2350 (Southern Union); People v. Black (2007)\n\n41 Cal.4th 799, 812.) The Apprendi rule is designed to safeguard a defendant's right to\n\nhave a jury decide all the elements of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt, and it\n\nextends the jury factfinding requirement to sentencing factors that are viewed as akin to\n\nelements of the offense because they increase the punishment for the offense above what\n\nis otherwise statutorily prescribed. (Alleyne, supra, at pp. 2157-2160; see Oregon v. Ice\n\n(2009) 555 U.S. 150, 170.) Thus, when a statute requires the trial court to increase the\n\npunishment based on a finding beyond the jury's verdict, or forbids the trial court from\n\nincreasing the penalty without the particular finding, the finding is deemed to equate with\n\nan element of the offense that must be decided by the jury, not the court. (See Alleyne,\n\nsupra, at pp. 2155, 2153-2161; People v. Black, supra, at p. 812; People v. Kramis (2012)\n\n209 Cal.App.4th 346, 350-351.)\n\n       For example, in Alleyne, the court held the jury, not the trial court, had to find\n\nwhether the defendant brandished, rather than merely used, a firearm so as to increase a\n\nmandatory minimum sentence from five years for firearm use to a mandatory minimum\n\nsentence of seven years for firearm brandishing. (Alleyne, supra, 133 S.Ct. at pp. 2155-\n\n2156, 2160 [jury verdict finding firearm use did not permit increased sentence based on\n\ncourt's finding of brandishing].) Similarly, in Southern Union, the court held the jury, not\n\nthe trial court, had to make findings as to precisely how many days a defendant violated\n\nan environmental statute that prescribed a fine for each day of violation. (Southern\n\nUnion, supra, 132 S.Ct. at pp. 2349-2351 [jury verdict finding violations during two-year\n\n\n\n\n                                             35\n\fperiod, without specifying number of days violations occurred, did not permit daily fines\n\nbased on court's determination of number of days].)\n\n       However, there are a variety of circumstances in which the Apprendi jury\n\nfactfinding requirement does not apply. For example, the Apprendi rule does not apply to\n\njudicial factfinding that involves a discretionary selection of a sentence or fine within a\n\nrange prescribed by statute, rather than a mandatory augmentation of the penalty based on\n\nspecified facts. (Southern Union, supra, 132 S.Ct. at pp. 2352, fn. 5, 2353; Alleyne,\n\nsupra, 133 S.Ct. at pp. 2161, fn. 2, 2163; People v. Kramis, supra, 209 Cal.App.4th at pp.\n\n349-352; see People v. Sandoval (2007) 41 Cal.4th 825, 844, 846-847.) Also, the rule\n\ndoes not apply to a consequence imposed on the defendant that is collateral to the\n\nparticular statutorily prescribed penalty for the offense and that does not involve factual\n\ndeterminations historically reserved for jury resolution. (Oregon v. Ice, supra, 555 U.S.\n\nat pp. 163-164, 168-172 [judicial factfinding for consecutive rather than concurrent\n\nsentences outside Apprendi]; People v. Mosley (2015) 60 Cal.4th 1044, 1059-1060\n\n[judicial factfinding for discretionary sex offender residency restriction outside\n\nApprendi].) Further, Apprendi does not apply to a consequence imposed on the\n\ndefendant that the Legislature did not intend to be a penalty, and that is not so onerous or\n\nin the nature of a traditional penalty as to be deemed a penalty in effect. (Mosley, supra,\n\nat pp. 1062-1069 [discretionary sex offender residency restriction is regulatory scheme to\n\nprotect public and is not penalty for Apprendi purposes].)\n\n\n\n\n                                             36\n\f       Applying these Apprendi principles, numerous state and federal courts (including\n\nCalifornia courts) have concluded that direct victim restitution awards fall outside the\n\nparameters of the Apprendi jury factfinding requirement. (People v. Wasbotten (2014)\n\n225 Cal.App.4th 306, 308-309 [Apprendi does not apply to direct restitution award for\n\neconomic losses]; accord People v. Sweeny (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 142, 155; People v.\n\nPangan (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 574, 585-586; People v. Chappelone (2010) 183\n\nCal.App.4th 1159, 1184; People v. Millard (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 7, 35-36; United\n\nStates v. Rosbottom (5th Cir. 2014) 763 F.3d 408, 420; United States v. Green (9th Cir.\n\n2013) 722 F.3d 1146, 1148-1151; United States v. Day (4th Cir. 2012) 700 F.3d 713,\n\n732; United States v. Wolfe (7th Cir. 2012) 701 F.3d 1206, 1216-1218; People v.\n\nCommonwealth v. Denehy (Mass. 2014) 2 N.E.3d 161, 173-175; State v. Huff (Kan. App.\n\nCt. 2014) 336 P.3d 887, 901-903; see People v. Smith (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 415, 433-\n\n434 [jury trial right under California Constitution for civil cases does not apply to victim\n\nrestitution award for noneconomic losses in criminal cases].)\n\n       The victim restitution statute at issue here (§ 1202.4, subd. (f)(3)(F)) directs the\n\ncourt to compensate the victim for noneconomic losses when a defendant violates section\n\n288. Thus, the jury's section 288 guilty verdict authorizes the award, and the court\n\nmerely determines the existence and amount of the noneconomic loss. In this\n\ncircumstance, the court is not making a factual finding that mandates an increase in the\n\nparticular statutory penalty prescribed for the offense that would otherwise apply, nor is it\n\nencroaching upon an area of factfinding traditionally reserved for the jury. Rather, the\n\ncourt is exercising its discretion to assess and calculate the victim's losses so as to impose\n\n\n                                             37\n\fa consequence that is collateral to the penalty prescribed for the offense. (People v.\n\nMillard, supra, 175 Cal.App.4th at p. 36 [victim restitution \"does not constitute a\n\nsentencing choice by the trial court\" within the meaning of the Apprendi rule];\n\nCommonwealth v. Denehy, supra, 2 N.E.3d at p. 174 [\"We distinguish [victim] restitution\n\nfrom punishments such as imprisonment and criminal fines that are accompanied by\n\nstatutory prescriptions.\"].) As recognized by the United States Supreme Court in Oregon\n\nv. Ice when concluding consecutive sentences were outside Apprendi: \"Trial judges often\n\nfind facts about . . . orders of restitution. . . . Intruding Apprendi's rule into these\n\ndecisions on sentencing choices or accoutrements surely would cut the rule loose from its\n\nmoorings.\" (Oregon v. Ice, supra, 555 U.S. at pp. 171-172.)\n\n       Further, a victim restitution award is designed as a civil remedy to compensate the\n\nvictim for his or her losses, and it is not so onerous or akin to traditional punishment as to\n\nbe deemed penal in effect. (People v. Wasbotten, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 309;\n\nPeople v. Pangan, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at p. 585; People v. Millard, supra, 175\n\nCal.App.4th at pp. 35-36; see People v. Harvest (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 641, 647-650\n\n[victim restitution is not punishment for double jeopardy purposes; \"unlike a [restitution]\n\nfine, victim restitution is not expressly and statutorily defined as punishment,\" and it \"is\n\ncompensation, which does not involve an affirmative disability or restraint, and which\n\nhas not historically been regarded as punishment\"].) As our court explained in Millard,\n\nthe \"primary purpose of victim restitution hearings is to allow the People to prosecute an\n\nexpedited hearing before a trial court to provide a victim with a civil remedy\n\nfor . . . losses suffered, and not to punish the defendant for his or her crime. . . . [¶] To\n\n\n                                               38\n\fthe extent a victim restitution order has the secondary purposes of rehabilitation of a\n\ndefendant and/or deterrence of the defendant and others from committing future crimes,\n\nthose purposes do not constitute increased punishment of the defendant . . . .\" (People v.\n\nMillard, supra, 175 Cal.App.4th at pp. 35-36.)\n\n       Defendant argues that although a victim restitution award for economic damages\n\nmay be nonpunitive, a victim restitution award for noneconomic damages should be\n\ndeemed punitive for Apprendi purposes. In support, he argues the noneconomic loss\n\naward applies only to defendants convicted of violating section 288; the amount of the\n\naward turns on factors related to the circumstances of the crime such as its duration or\n\nseverity; and there is no \"built-in proportionality limitation\" since it is not based on\n\nactual, demonstrated loss. We are not persuaded. As we explained above, a victim\n\nrestitution award—whether it be for noneconomic or economic losses—involves factual\n\ndeterminations that are collateral to the particular punishment prescribed for the offense;\n\nthe award is intended to equate with civil compensation rather than a penalty; and it is not\n\nso harsh or in the nature of traditional punishment as to necessitate a penalty\n\nclassification.\n\n       The court's factual findings concerning the direct victim restitution award did not\n\ninvoke the Apprendi rule. Given our holding, we need not address the Attorney General's\n\ncontention of forfeiture.\n\n             2. Claim that Restitution Amount Is Unsupported and Excessive\n\n       Defendant argues the $400,000 restitution award for noneconomic damages must\n\nbe stricken because it is unsupported by the record and excessive. He contends there was\n\n\n                                              39\n\fno substantial evidence that Doe suffered lasting psychological harm, noting she did not\n\nappear at the sentencing or restitution hearing, she did not submit a claim, and there was\n\nevidence that she was doing well, including attending college, working, and maintaining\n\na stable relationship. He also claims the court failed to adequately explain how it\n\ncalculated the amount. Further, he asserts that contrary to the holding in People v. Smith,\n\nsupra, 198 Cal.App.4th at page 436, the amount of the noneconomic damage award\n\nshould be evaluated under an abuse of discretion standard rather than a shocking-to-the-\n\nconscience standard.\n\n       We need not evaluate the standard of review because the record supports the\n\n$400,000 award even under an abuse of discretion standard. (See People v. Giordano\n\n(2007) 42 Cal.4th 644, 665 [\"No abuse of that discretion occurs as long as the\n\ndetermination of . . . loss is reasonable, producing a nonarbitrary result.\"].) The court\n\nreasonably determined that defendant's conduct of molesting Doe during a large part of\n\nher childhood caused serious psychological harm and emotional distress to her, and hence\n\na substantial noneconomic loss award was warranted.\n\n       At trial Doe described the lack of sexual normalcy and emotional anguish that she\n\nhas experienced because of the molestation and that she will likely continue to experience\n\nfor the rest of her life. She expressed similar sentiments when interviewed by probation\n\nofficers in 2012 and 2013. When interviewed in 2012, Doe initially \"expressed courage\"\n\nand stated she was \"ready to be interviewed in order to put this incident behind her.\"\n\nHowever, when she started talking to the probation officer about the molestation, this\n\n\"caused her to completely break down and cry. She managed to keep her composure at\n\n\n                                             40\n\ftimes and would take breaks in order to catch her breath. [She] was able to carry out the\n\ninterview and wiped her tears after every statement she made. [¶] . . . [She] wanted to\n\nmake the court aware that this incident has affected her tremendously. . . . [¶] . . . [N]ow\n\n[as] an adult [she] realizes the horrible nightmare she lived with her father.\" Doe also\n\ntold the probation officer she wanted defendant to receive a life sentence, noting that the\n\ntime defendant would have served pursuant to his earlier guilty plea (later withdrawn)\n\nwould have been \"minimal compared to the time she suffered and will continue to suffer\n\nfor the remainder of her life.\" During the 2013 interview, Doe told the probation officer\n\nthat she is trying to move on with her life; she has yet to undergo counseling \"due to her\n\nmistrust of men\" and she hopes to seek counseling once she finds a suitable counselor;\n\nand she \"has been permanently impacted to the point [that] talking about it causes\n\nemotional pain to return.\"\n\n       At the restitution hearing, defense counsel objected to the court's tentative decision\n\nto award $500,000 for noneconomic losses, and requested that the court reduce the award\n\nto $250,000. The court stated it had considered Doe's trial testimony and her statements\n\nto the probation officers concerning the impact of defendant's conduct on her. Further, it\n\nhad reviewed civil jury instructions concerning the calculation of past and future\n\nemotional distress damages, including CACI No. 3905A and the life expectancy table\n\n\n\n\n                                             41\n\fincluded in the CACI instructions.13 Based on these considerations, the court concluded\n\n$400,000 was an appropriate amount for noneconomic damages.\n\n       Doe's statements at trial and to the probation officers support that she has suffered\n\nsevere emotional trauma because of the molestation, and that the effects of the trauma\n\nwill likely endure throughout her life. The court was entitled to credit these statements\n\nthat defendant's conduct had caused serious, lasting psychological distress to her.\n\nFurther, the court explained its calculation method, stating that it relied on the guidelines\n\nused to determine past and future emotional distress damages in the civil context.\n\nDefendant has not shown that the court abused its discretion or otherwise erred in\n\nawarding $400,000 for noneconomic losses.\n\nC. Habitual Sex Offender Sentences Should Be Dismissed Given Imposition of Sentence\n\n                        Under the One Strike Sex Offender Scheme\n\n       For each of counts 1 through 6, the court imposed a sentence of 25 years to life\n\nunder the One Strike sex offender statute (§ 667.61) based on defendant's commission of\n\na statutorily specified sex offense under a statutorily specified circumstance, and doubled\n\neach sentence (to 50 years to life) under the Three Strikes statute based on defendant's\n\nprior strike conviction (§ 667, subd. (e)(1)). Additionally for each of these counts, the\n\ncourt imposed another sentence of 25 years to life under the Habitual Sex Offender\n\nstatute (§ 667.71) based on defendant's prior sex offense conviction, and doubled the\n\n\n13      CACI No. 3905A states that there is no fixed standard for noneconomic damages;\nthe trier of fact must use its judgment to decide a reasonable amount based on the\nevidence and common sense; and recovery for future damages requires proof that the\nperson is reasonably certain to suffer that harm.\n\n                                             42\n\fsentence (to 50 years to life) under the Three Strikes statute. The court then stayed the\n\nhabitual sex offender sentences under section 654. Defendant argues the trial court was\n\nrequired to dismiss, rather than stay, the sentences imposed under the Habitual Sex\n\nOffender statute.\n\n       There is a split in authority among the lower appellate courts as to whether the\n\ncourt should stay or dismiss sentences when both the Habitual Sex Offender statute and\n\nthe One Strike sex offender statute apply. (Compare People v. Snow (2003) 105\n\nCal.App.4th 271, 281-283 [dismiss] and People v Johnson (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 188,\n\n207-209 [dismiss], with People v. Lopez (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 355, 360-366 [stay] and\n\nPeople v. McQueen (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 27, 34-38 [stay].)\n\n       Our court has twice concluded that when both the One Strike sex offender\n\nsentencing scheme and the alternative Habitual Sex Offender sentencing scheme apply to\n\na defendant's case, the trial court should select which sentencing scheme to apply and\n\nthen dismiss the sentences for the alternative sentencing scheme. (People v. Snow, supra,\n\n105 Cal.App.4th at p. 283 [\"Under circumstances in which the alternative sentencing\n\nschemes of section 667.61 and 667.71 apply, the sentencing court has discretion to\n\nchoose one of the sentencing schemes[,] and then must strike or dismiss, rather than stay,\n\nthe sentence under the other.\"]; People v. Johnson, supra, 96 Cal.App.4th at pp. 207-\n\n209.) In the interests of consistency within our division, we conclude this is the\n\nappropriate procedure to follow unless and until the California Supreme Court resolves\n\nthe issue otherwise. Accordingly, we shall modify the judgment to order that the habitual\n\nsex offender sentences on counts 1 through 6 be dismissed.\n\n\n                                            43\n\f                              VI. Cumulative Effect of Errors\n\n       Defendant contends the cumulative effect of errors at the guilt and sentencing\n\nphases of his trial violated his constitutional due process right to a fair trial. We have\n\ncorrected the error concerning the habitual sex offender sentences. The sole remaining\n\npossible error was the trial court's reference at sentencing to defendant's non-Mirandized\n\nadmission, which was of minor significance in light of the record as a whole.\n\nDefendant's claim based on the cumulative effect of error is unavailing.\n\n                                       DISPOSITION\n\n       The judgment is modified to dismiss the habitual sex offender sentences imposed\n\nunder section 667.71. As so modified, the judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                      HALLER, Acting P.

Further, he asserts the court erred by\n\n(1) allowing admission of the details of his prior sex offense conviction; (2) denying his\n\nmistrial motion based on stricken testimony that he fit the profile of a child molester; and\n\n(3) denying his posttrial request for disclosure of juror identifying information.\n\n       As to sentencing, defendant contends (1) the court erred in considering evidence\n\nthat was excluded at trial on Miranda2 grounds; (2) a $400,000 restitution award to the\n\nvictim must be reversed due to a violation of the Apprendi3 rule and insufficiency of the\n\nevidence, and (3) the trial court should have dismissed, rather than stayed, sentences\n\nimposed under the Habitual Sex Offender statute.\n\n       We find no reversible error except for defendant's challenge to his habitual sex\n\noffender sentences.

The matter\n\nwas investigated; defendant was arrested; and in 1998 he pled guilty to committing a\n\nlewd act against Doe.4\n\n       Because of his 1998 lewd act conviction, defendant was removed from the family\n\nhome for four years; the family received counseling; and defendant reunited with the\n\nfamily in about January 2002. Doe's mother testified she did not divorce defendant at\n\nthis time because \"[t]here was doubt,\" explaining that defendant told her he did not\n\ncommit the molestation, \"everything was just misconstrued,\" and he only pled guilty so\n\nshe could be reunited with their children.\n\n       Doe recalled another incident that occurred when she was about nine years old and\n\nher brother was about three or four years old. On this occasion, Doe and her brother were\n\n\n\n4     At the current trial, Doe did not recall the events surrounding defendant's 1998\nconviction. We set forth the facts concerning this prior conviction in more detail below\nwhen describing the prior sex offense evidence admitted at trial.\n\n                                             3\n\fnot wearing clothes, she was on top of her brother, and her father was with them in the\n\nroom. She did not remember further details, except that her brother's penis and her\n\nvagina were somehow \"involved.\"\n\n       The remaining acts of molestation described by Doe occurred at the family's home\n\non Cedar Avenue where they moved in July of 2002 when Doe was almost 10 years old,\n\nand at the family's home on Walnut Avenue where they moved in November 2003 when\n\nDoe was 11 years old.\n\n       During an incident at the Cedar residence, Doe woke up in the middle of the night\n\non the couch, and defendant was \"making out\" with her, with his tongue in her mouth and\n\nhis arms around her. The incident made her feel \"uncomfortable.\" On another occasion,\n\ndefendant performed oral sex by putting his mouth on Doe's vagina.\n\n       During an incident at the Walnut residence, Doe woke up on her parents' bed, and\n\ndefendant was on top of her with his penis in her vagina. Doe felt \"very violated and\n\nvery upset.\" On another occasion he had her sit on top of a scanner and he scanned her\n\nvagina. On several occasions he woke her up so she could watch pornography with him.\n\nShe felt \"really uncomfortable\" watching the pornographic movies, but felt \"too afraid to\n\nsay no.\"\n\n       Also, on multiple occasions at the Walnut residence defendant had Doe give him\n\n\"blow jobs\" when they were in his bathroom. He tried to ejaculate in her mouth;\n\n\"usually, it ended up in a towel or some article of clothing\"; and on one occasion he\n\nejaculated \"out on [her] chest.\" This conduct made Doe feel \"gross,\" \"very\n\nuncomfortable,\" and disgusted.\n\n\n                                             4\n\f      During another incident defendant brought a dog into his bedroom and told Doe to\n\n\"get down on all fours\" because he wanted to \"put the dog on top of [her] and put the\n\ndog[']s penis in . . . somewhere.\" Doe refused, and defendant instead got \"on all fours\"\n\nand had the dog get on top of him. Doe felt \"really grossed out.\"\n\n      Doe recalled several other incidents of sexual molestation at the Walnut residence,\n\nincluding an incident in defendant's bedroom when he put vibrators on her vagina;\n\nanother incident in the bedroom when he put his finger in her vagina; and several\n\nincidents in the bedroom and living room when he would masturbate in front of her. Doe\n\ntestified she did not know whether defendant molested her \"every week or every month\"\n\nwhile they lived at the Walnut residence, but she knew it happened \"at least a few times\n\nin one month, and few can be anywhere from two to ten times.\"\n\n      Regarding her relationship with her father, Doe testified he was the primary\n\ncaregiver for her and her brother. Her mother was frequently gone from home at work\n\nand they were not emotionally close. When Doe was small, she and defendant were\n\n\"very close,\" and she loved him and he was like a friend to her. As Doe got older, she\n\ndid not feel as close to him; she did not know how to feel about him; and she knew that\n\nwhat was occurring was not right.\n\n      Doe did not recall defendant using physical discipline with her, but she testified\n\nshe was afraid of him when she was growing up because she was not \"sure what he could\n\ndo.\" She remembered an incident in which defendant tied her and her mother to the bed\n\nin his bedroom. Her father and mother engaged in loud arguments; there was a lot of\n\nshouting, slamming of doors, and slamming of hands on tables; and defendant was\n\n\n                                            5\n\fsometimes violent. For example, on one occasion he held her mother in a headlock and\n\non another occasion threw a chair. During the headlock incident, her mother yelled that\n\nDoe should call 911 and when Doe went to get the phone, defendant threw the phone.\n\n       Doe's mother confirmed that she was often gone from home at work, including at\n\nnight, and defendant took care of the children when she was not at home. Consistent with\n\nDoe's testimony, Doe's mother testified there was always a lot of pushing, shoving,\n\nthrowing of objects, and screaming between her and defendant, and during the incident\n\nwhen she asked Doe to call 911 defendant pulled the phone out of the wall and threw it.\n\n       Doe testified she did not know what to do about the molestation because defendant\n\nwas her father and she had been taught to respect her elders; she had never gone against\n\nhim because she was afraid of him; she did not know \"how to go about confronting the\n\nissue\"; and she was afraid to say anything to other adults because they knew her father\n\nand she was afraid there would be a \"back lash\" against her. She thought if she told\n\nsomeone, her father would find out and he would get in trouble or do something to hurt\n\nher, and people would think differently of her and not believe her.\n\n       When Doe was 14 years old, she finally told her father she would no longer\n\nengage in the sexual activity. This occurred when he asked her to go with him into the\n\nbedroom, which usually meant \"something would happen\"; she did not want to go; to try\n\nto coax her into the bedroom he grabbed her cat; she asked him for her cat back and hit\n\nhim in the back; and she then told him she was not going to \"do anything anymore\" and\n\nshe was \"done with that kind of thing.\" After this, defendant stopped molesting her. Doe\n\ngrew closer to her father again and felt safer, but in the back of her mind she worried and\n\n\n                                             6\n\fwas afraid the molestation would resume. She and her father did not talk about the\n\nmolestation but \"just swept it under the rug and pretended\" it was not there.\n\n       In 2008 or 2009, when Doe was about 16 or 17 years old, her mother moved out of\n\nthe family home because her parents were getting divorced. Doe was allowed to choose\n\nwhich parent to live with, and she chose to live with defendant. Doe testified she was\n\n\"very confused\" about what she should do; she \"just wanted to survive and be safe\"; and\n\nshe elected to live with defendant because the molestation had stopped and defendant was\n\nmore financially secure than her mother.\n\n       However, there was one more incident in September 2009. While Doe and\n\ndefendant were in the car in the desert, he masturbated in front of her. Doe \"looked away\n\nand pretended [she] wasn't there and tried to just get away from it mentally.\" She felt\n\n\"upset and disgusted.\" Because of this incident and because she and her father were\n\narguing a lot about her behavior, in October 2009 she moved in with her mother.\n\n       As Doe was growing up, she told a few people about the molestation, including\n\nher cousin, her high school boyfriend, and two close friends. Doe's cousin and boyfriend\n\ntestified to confirm the disclosure. In 2010, near the time when she was graduating from\n\nhigh school, Doe made a full disclosure during a long conversation with her high school\n\nboyfriend. During this time period she refused to continue visiting with her father, and\n\nafter an emotional confrontation with her parents during a child custody exchange in a\n\nparking lot, she asked her mother to contact the authorities so she could talk to them.\n\n       Doe testified she felt relieved after finally disclosing the molestation; when she\n\ndisclosed she was not living with her father and felt safer; but she still felt vulnerable\n\n\n                                              7\n\fbecause if her father \"really wanted to do something, he would find a way.\" A child\n\nsexual assault expert testified that delayed disclosure of sexual abuse is a typical\n\ndisclosure pattern for children.\n\n       Regarding the long-term psychological impact of the molestation, Doe testified, \"I\n\nhave tried to forget a lot of the things about what has happened . . . because it makes me\n\nfeel a lot of things that I don't want to feel.\" She explained: \"[I]t [is] very hard for me to\n\nfeel kind of normal, and I feel more like there [are] some aspects of my life that aren't\n\ngoing to be normal, like my sex life with whoever I get married to is not going to be\n\nnormal and that I am always going to have little triggers that make me remember what\n\nhappened and stress me out or make me cry. I find it hard to actually speak with\n\ncounselors about this kind of thing and people in general, but more so [with] counselors\n\nand therapists. I feel like I am very much going to have a lot of emotional and maybe\n\npsychological damage for the rest of my life from all of this.\"\n\nPrior Sex Offense Evidence\n\n       In January 1998, Detective William Crisp conducted a recorded one-hour\n\ninterview with defendant regarding the molestation allegation that resulted in his 1998\n\nconviction. When Crisp asked defendant why the molestation happened, defendant\n\nresponded he had an urge and he fought it all the time; it was a shameful act and he did\n\nnot talk about it to anyone; there were times when the opportunity arose and he could not\n\nstop himself; and after a \"certain point where once you are doing it, you just want to keep\n\ndoing it.\" Defendant told Crisp that the molestation occurred during two periods of time\n\nbetween October 1996 and December 1997; it happened about eight or nine times; and it\n\n\n                                              8\n\fincluded such activities as rubbing, caressing, inserting his finger in Doe's rectum,\n\nplacing his penis between her thighs up against her vagina, and ejaculation. Detective\n\nCrisp provided additional details concerning what defendant said during the interview,\n\nincluding about the nature of his relationship with his wife, further information about\n\nwhen and how the molestation occurred and his feelings about it, and the measures he\n\ntook to hide the sexual activity.\n\nDefense\n\n       The defense presented testimony from several witnesses (including a sheriff's\n\ndeputy, a social worker, and defendant's mother, brother, and girlfriend) who had contact\n\nwith Doe during her childhood. These witnesses variously testified that Doe never\n\nmentioned, and on occasion denied, any further molestation after defendant's 1998\n\nconviction, and they did not observe anything to suggest defendant was continuing to\n\nmolest Doe. The defense also called a psychiatrist who testified that unsubstantiated\n\nreports of child sexual abuse are more likely to occur when there are child custody\n\ndisputes.\n\nJury Verdict and Sentence5\n\n       For the incident with Doe and her brother, defendant was convicted of forcible\n\nlewd act on a child under age 14 between August 2000 and August 2002 (count 6). For\n\nthe incidents at the Cedar residence, defendant was convicted of (1) aggravated sexual\n\nassault on a child under age 14 and at least 10 years younger than the defendant (forcible\n\n\n5      Defendant was tried in two trials. At his first trial, the jury acquitted him of some\ncounts and deadlocked on others. At retrial, the jury convicted him as charged.\n\n                                              9\n\foral copulation in the bedroom, count 1), and (2) forcible lewd act on a child (kissing Doe\n\non the couch, count 3) between July 2002 and November 2003. For the incidents at the\n\nWalnut residence, defendant was convicted of (1) aggravated sexual assault (forcible oral\n\ncopulation in the bathroom, count 2), (2) two counts of forcible lewd act (penile/vaginal\n\npenetration, count 4, and ejaculation on the chest, count 5), and (3) child molestation with\n\na prior conviction (incident with the dog, count 7) between November 2003 and August\n\n2006.\n\n        The aggravated sexual assault by forcible oral copulation offenses (Pen. Code,6\n\n§§ 269, subd. (a)(4), 288a, subd. (c)(2); counts 1 and 2) and the various forcible lewd act\n\noffenses (§ 288, subd. (b)(1), counts 3 through 6) were premised on the theory that\n\ndefendant committed the offenses through the use of duress.\n\n        The jury also found true that defendant was convicted of a lewd act offense in\n\n1998 for purposes of a prior sex offense conviction allegation, One Strike sex offender\n\nallegation, habitual sex offender allegation, and prior strike allegation.\n\n        The trial court sentenced defendant to a term of 300 years to life, plus a\n\ndeterminate term of 34 years. The court's sentencing order included an award of\n\n$400,000 in direct victim restitution to Doe for her noneconomic losses.\n\n\n\n\n6       Subsequent unspecified statutory references are to the Penal Code.\n\n                                              10\n\f                                       DISCUSSION\n\n                               I. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n       Challenging his convictions of aggravated sexual assault and forcible lewd act\n\n(counts 1 through 6), defendant asserts the record does not support that he used duress to\n\ncommit the molestation. He also argues there is insufficient evidence to support the\n\noccurrence of the count 1 incident (oral copulation in the Cedar Avenue bedroom).\n\n       In reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we examine the entire\n\nrecord in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether there is\n\nsubstantial evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. (People v. Nelson (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2357828\"><a href=\"/opinion/2357828/people-v-nelson/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">198</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 210.) It is the\n\nexclusive province of the jury to determine credibility and to resolve evidentiary conflicts\n\nand inconsistencies, and we presume in support of the judgment the existence of every\n\nfact the jury could reasonably deduce from the evidence.

If the circumstances reasonably justify the jury's findings,\n\nreversal is not warranted merely because the circumstances might also be reasonably\n\nreconciled with a contrary finding.

Sufficiency of the Evidence To Show Duress\n\n       For purposes of child molestation offenses, duress means the defendant's \" 'use of\n\na direct or implied threat of force, violence, danger, hardship or retribution sufficient to\n\ncause a reasonable person to do or submit to something that he or she would not\n\notherwise do or submit to.' \" (People v.

To determine the existence of duress, the totality of the circumstances\n\n\n                                              11\n\fshould be considered, including the age of the victim, the defendant's relationship to the\n\nvictim, and relative size and age disparities. (People v. Veale (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2279755\"><a href=\"/opinion/2279755/people-v-veale/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Soto, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 243). A child under age 14 is\n\ndeemed legally incapable of giving consent, and accordingly evidence showing the\n\ndefendant's use of duress is not obviated by the fact that the child may have appeared to\n\nconsent. (Id. at pp. 245-246 [the child's consent or lack thereof is immaterial; the focus is\n\non the conduct of the defendant].)\n\n       There is sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding of duress. The sexual\n\nabuse started when Doe was a small child and continued until she was finally able to\n\nassert herself enough to confront defendant at age 14. Doe testified she found the activity\n\n\"gross,\" \"disgust[ing],\" and \"upset[ting],\" but she was too afraid of defendant to protest\n\nthe molestation, and she worried if she told someone he might hurt her. She explained\n\nshe did not know what he was capable of doing, and she described his volatile and at\n\ntimes violent behavior, including tying her mother and her to the bed, throwing a chair,\n\nholding her mother in a headlock and pulling the phone out of the wall.\n\n       The jury was entitled to credit Doe's claims that she feared her father because of\n\nhis demonstrated potential for violence, and she did not like the sexual activity but was\n\ntoo afraid to protest it. From this evidence, the jury could reasonably deduce that\n\nalthough defendant may not have overtly forced Doe to engage in the sexual activity, he\n\npsychologically coerced her by creating an atmosphere of fear within the family so that\n\n\n                                             12\n\fshe would be intimidated, compliant, and secretive about the sexual activity. This\n\nsupports a finding that defendant used duress to molest Doe.\n\n                       B. Sufficiency of the Evidence for Count 1\n\n       Defendant argues the record does not support the jury's finding that the count 1\n\nincident—involving an allegation of oral copulation in the Cedar residence bedroom—\n\nactually occurred.\n\n       Count 1 alleged that \"on or about\" between July 1, 2002 and November 19, 2003,\n\ndefendant committed oral copulation in the bedroom at the Cedar residence. During\n\ndirect examination of Doe, the prosecutor summarized the incidents described by Doe so\n\nfar in her testimony that occurred at the Cedar residence, and when he asked if she\n\nremembered anything else, Doe responded no. After refreshing her recollection by\n\nhaving her read a portion of her transcribed testimony at another proceeding, Doe\n\ntestified there was an incident at the Cedar residence when defendant \"was giving [her]\n\noral sex,\" explaining \"[h]is mouth was on my vagina.\" When the prosecutor asked where\n\nin the Cedar house this occurred, Doe responded \"I don't remember exactly where it was\n\nin the house.\"7\n\n\n\n7      The colloquy was as follows: \"[Prosecutor:] . . . [W]e just left off with refreshing\nyour recollection regarding an incident that occurred at . . . Cedar?\" [¶] [Doe:] Yes. [¶]\n[Prosecutor:] Can you explain to us what happened? [¶] [Doe:] There was a time when\nmy dad was giving me oral sex. [¶] [Prosecutor:] Okay. And when you say giving you\noral sex what do you mean by that? [¶] [Doe:] His mouth was on my vagina. [¶]\n[Prosecutor:] And where was this at? Where was [this] at in the house on . . . Cedar?\nDo you remember? [¶] [Doe:] I don't remember exactly where it was in the house. [¶]\n[Prosecutor:] And it was in the house? [¶] [Doe:] Yes. It was in the house. [¶]\n[Prosecutor:] You don't remember what house? [¶] [Doe:] No.\" (Italics added.)\n\n                                            13\n\f       Defendant asserts the testimony for count 1 was imprecise as to date and location.\n\nHe also cites Doe's initial failure to recollect the incident and a portion of her testimony\n\nsuggesting she did not remember at which house it occurred. He contends it is\n\nimpossible to distinguish count 1 from the other counts and to calculate whether the\n\ncharge was filed within the applicable statute of limitations period.\n\n       As to the dates of occurrence, Doe testified she was 10 years old when she lived at\n\nthe Cedar residence; they lived at the Cedar residence for about one year; and they moved\n\nto the Walnut residence when she was 11 years old. Doe's mother testified the family\n\nlived at the Cedar residence from July 2002 until November 2003. Based on Doe's date\n\nof birth in August 1992, she was 10 years old between August 2002 and August 2003.\n\nThis evidence, combined with Doe's testimony that there was oral copulation at the Cedar\n\nresidence, supports the allegation that oral copulation occurred during the approximate\n\ndates of July 2002 and November 2003, when Doe was about 10 years old, and when the\n\nfamily was living at the Cedar residence. (See People v. Jones (1990) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1427529\"><a href=\"/opinion/1427529/people-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 316\n\n[testimony identifying general timeframe when molestation occurred is sufficient].)\n\n       As to the location of the incident, Doe initially indicated it occurred at the Cedar\n\nresidence. The fact that she could not recall in which room it occurred does not defeat the\n\nsupport for a finding that defendant engaged in oral copulation with Doe at the Cedar\n\nresidence. Even though the information alleged the incident occurred in the bedroom, no\n\nsuch finding was needed to support the jury's verdict. Further, there was no possibility\n\n       We note the prosecutor's last question asking if she did not remember \"what\nhouse\" appears to be a nonsequitur, since the entire line of questioning was focused on an\nincident at the Cedar house.\n\n                                             14\n\fthe jury would convict on count 1 based on events associated with another count because\n\ncount 1 was the only allegation involving oral copulation at the Cedar residence between\n\nJuly 2002 and November 2003. The other allegations involved different locations, time\n\nperiods, and/or sexual acts.\n\n       Defendant's challenges based on Doe's initial inability to recollect the incident,\n\nand his claim that she did not know at which residence the incident occurred, are likewise\n\nunavailing. On appeal, we draw all inferences in favor of the judgment and\n\ninconsistencies in the evidence are not fatal to the verdict. (See People v. Young, supra,\n\n34 Cal.4th at p. 1181.) Doe's refreshed memory of the incident is sufficient to support a\n\nfinding that it occurred. Further, although there is brief testimony suggesting Doe did not\n\nremember at which house the incident occurred (see fn. 7, ante), her affirmative\n\nacknowledgement in another portion of her testimony that it occurred at the Cedar\n\nresidence supports the verdict on count 1.\n\n                       II. Admission of Prior Sex Offense Evidence\n\n       Defendant argues the court abused its discretion and deprived him of a fair trial\n\nwhen it admitted evidence concerning the facts of his 1998 lewd act conviction. He\n\nposits that even if his prior sex offense conviction was generally relevant under Evidence\n\nCode section 1108 to prove his propensity to commit sexual offenses, the court should\n\nhave admitted only the fact of his prior conviction and should not have permitted\n\n\"wholesale admission\" of the details underlying his conviction.\n\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\f                                      A. Background\n\n       Prior to trial, defendant offered to stipulate to the existence of his 1998 sex offense\n\nconviction, but requested that the court exclude evidence of the facts underlying the\n\nconviction on the grounds that they were unduly remote, highly inflammatory, and more\n\nprejudicial than probative. The trial court rejected his request, finding the evidence was\n\nhighly relevant under Evidence Code section 1108 to show he had a propensity to molest\n\nhis daughter and it was not unduly remote or prejudicial. The court noted that admission\n\nof only the sex offense conviction could suggest defendant merely engaged in a \"one-\n\ntime touching,\" whereas defendant's statements to Detective Crisp were extremely\n\nprobative to show his propensity to molest his daughter.\n\n                                    B. Governing Law\n\n       Evidence Code section 1108 sets forth an exception to the general rule against the\n\nuse of evidence of a defendant's misconduct apart from the charged offense to show a\n\npropensity to commit crimes. (People v. Villatoro (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1152</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1159-1160.)\n\nWhen a defendant is charged with a sex offense, Evidence Code section 1108 allows\n\nadmission of evidence of other sex offenses to prove the defendant's disposition to\n\ncommit sex offenses, subject to the trial court's discretion to exclude the evidence under\n\nEvidence Code section 352. (Evid. Code, § 1108, subd. (a); People v. Lewis (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1801755\"><a href=\"/opinion/1801755/people-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1255</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1286.) Evidence Code section 1108 is premised on the recognition that sex\n\noffense propensity evidence is critical in sex offense cases given the serious and secretive\n\nnature of sex crimes. (People v. Falsetta (1999) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1200056\"><a href=\"/opinion/1200056/people-v-falsetta/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">903</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 918 (Falsetta).) When\n\napplying Evidence Code section 1108 in a particular case, a defendant's fair trial rights\n\n\n                                             16\n\fare safeguarded by requiring the trial court to engage in a careful weighing process under\n\nEvidence Code section 352 to determine whether the probative value is substantially\n\noutweighed by the danger of undue prejudice, confusion, or time consumption. (Falsetta,\n\nat pp. 916-917.)\n\n       Based on Evidence Code section 1108, the presumption is in favor of the\n\nadmissibility of other sex offense evidence; however, the evidence should not be\n\nadmitted in cases where its admission could result in a fundamentally unfair trial.\n\n(People v. Loy (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"844271\"><a href=\"/opinion/844271/people-v-loy/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 62; Falsetta, supra, 21 Cal.4th at p. 917.) When\n\nevaluating the other sex offense evidence, relevant factors include \"its nature, relevance,\n\nand possible remoteness, the degree of certainty of its commission and the likelihood of\n\nconfusing, misleading, or distracting the jurors from their main inquiry, its similarity to\n\nthe charged offense, its likely prejudicial impact on the jurors, the burden on the\n\ndefendant in defending against the uncharged offense, and the availability of less\n\nprejudicial alternatives to its outright admission . . . .\" (Falsetta, at p. 917.)\n\n       The Evidence Code section 352 \" 'determination is entrusted to the sound\n\ndiscretion of the trial judge who is in the best position to evaluate the evidence.' \"\n\n(Falsetta, supra, 21 Cal.4th at pp. 917-918.) On appeal we will not disturb the trial\n\ncourt's ruling unless the court exercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious, or\n\npatently absurd manner that resulted in a miscarriage of justice. (People v. Lewis, supra,\n\n46 Cal.4th at p. 1286.)\n\n\n\n\n                                               17\n\f                                        C. Analysis\n\n       In support of his claim that the trial court should have excluded the details of his\n\n1998 sex offense conviction, defendant argues the circumstances of the prior conviction\n\novershadowed the evidence of the current charges and there was a significant danger the\n\njury would convict him based on his prior misconduct rather than on the evidence\n\nconcerning the current charges. He contends the details of his prior sex offense\n\nconviction were highly inflammatory; of stronger evidentiary weight than the evidence of\n\nthe current charges; unduly remote; and likely to cause the jury to want to punish him for\n\nthe prior offense because he was allowed to return home after his conviction.\n\n       The trial court was not required to reach these conclusions. As set forth above, at\n\ntrial Doe's mother described Doe's disclosure of the molestation giving rise to the 1998\n\nconviction, and Detective Crisp provided a detailed description of defendant's recorded\n\nstatements admitting this molestation, describing how it occurred, and explaining the\n\ndifficulty he had in controlling his sexual urges toward his daughter. The court could\n\nreasonably conclude that these details were highly relevant to show that defendant had a\n\nstrong propensity to molest his daughter, which propensity evidence is expressly\n\nadmissible under Evidence Code section 1108. As found by the trial court, if the jury\n\nwas merely told that defendant had previously been convicted of molesting Doe, without\n\nthe details concerning the extent of the molestation and defendant's overpowering\n\npedophilic feelings towards his daughter, it would have been deprived of compelling\n\nevidence that supported the prosecution's charges that the molestation resumed once\n\ndefendant returned to the family home. Neither the prosecutor nor the court is required\n\n\n                                             18\n\f\"to accept a stipulation that would deprive the state's case of its evidentiary\n\npersuasiveness or forcefulness.\" (People v. Rogers (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 329-330;\n\nPeople v. McCurdy (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1063</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1100.)\n\n       The fact that the propensity evidence was of significant detriment to the defense\n\ncase does not render it unduly prejudicial. Undue prejudice does not exist merely\n\nbecause highly probative evidence is damaging to the defense case, but rather arises from\n\nevidence that uniquely tends to evoke an emotional bias against the defendant or cause\n\nprejudgment of the issues based on extraneous factors. (People v. Doolin (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 438-439.) This is not a case where the prior sex offense evidence was so\n\negregious as compared to the charged sex offenses that it might have caused the jury to\n\nconvict based on the prior offenses regardless of the evidence supporting the current\n\ncharges. The prior and current molestation evidence were of a similar nature, and the\n\ncourt reasonably found no undue prejudice arising from the highly relevant prior\n\nmolestation evidence.\n\n       Also, the evidence was not unduly remote. The record shows that the prior\n\nmolestation occurred when Doe was about four and five years old; thereafter defendant\n\nwas out of the family home for about four years; and when he returned to the home he\n\nquickly resumed the behavior by molesting Doe when she was about nine years old. This\n\nshows a continuity of misconduct by defendant that obviates any claim of remoteness.\n\n       Finally, we reject defendant's contention that the trial court failed to engage in the\n\nrequired careful weighing of probative value and the potential for prejudice. The record\n\nreflects the court understood its duty and weighed the evidence under Evidence Code\n\n\n                                              19\n\fsection 352. The court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the details of defendant's\n\nprior molestation of his daughter.\n\n                       III. Denial of Mistrial Based on Stricken Testimony\n\n                         that Defendant Fit Child Molester Profile\n\n       Defendant argues the court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial after\n\nDetective Crisp twice testified that defendant fit the profile of a child molester. Although\n\nthe court struck the testimony and admonished the jury to disregard it, defendant\n\ncontends the testimony so infected the trial with unfairness that its prejudicial impact\n\ncould not be cured.\n\n       While questioning Detective Crisp, the prosecutor asked if he remembered\n\ninterviewing defendant about the 1998 molestation allegation even though it has been\n\n\"quite some time\" since this occurred. Detective Crisp answered yes, explaining that the\n\ninterview was \"disturbing\"; his training in child molestation cases included learning\n\nabout child molester profiles; and throughout all of his other interviews he had never met\n\nsomeone who \"was the profile.\" Defense counsel objected, and the court sustained the\n\nobjection, struck the last answer, and instructed the jury to disregard it.\n\n       Thereafter, at the conclusion of his questioning on direct examination, the\n\nprosecutor asked Detective Crisp if there was anything else about the interview with\n\ndefendant that he remembered. Detective Crisp responded: \"I knew from . . . the first\n\nfew minutes of the interview, that he was fighting with himself whether to be there or not,\n\nwhether to answer my questions or not. And that's why I reassured him that it was\n\nvoluntarily. I want to use the words that I used earlier that were thrown out, but he fit the\n\n\n                                              20\n\fprofile.\" Defense counsel objected and moved to strike the testimony, and the court\n\nresponded, \"Same ruling. The jurors are asked to disregard that last portion.\"\n\n       Defendant thereafter moved for a mistrial based on the jury hearing the stricken\n\ntestimony that he fit the profile of a child molester. The court denied the motion, finding\n\nthe stricken comments did not affect the fairness of the trial, and told defense counsel that\n\nupon request it would give a pinpoint instruction reminding the jurors the testimony was\n\nstricken and they should disregard it.\n\n       \" 'A mistrial should be granted if the court is apprised of prejudice that it judges\n\nincurable by admonition or instruction. . . . Whether a particular incident is incurably\n\nprejudicial is by its nature a speculative matter, and the trial court is vested with\n\nconsiderable discretion in ruling on mistrial motions. . . .' [Citation.] A motion for a\n\nmistrial should be granted when ' \" 'a [defendant's] chances of receiving a fair trial have\n\nbeen irreparably damaged.' \" ' \" (People v.

The jury was repeatedly told to disregard\n\nany stricken testimony, and it was given a special pinpoint instruction to remind them to\n\ndisregard Detective Crisp's stricken testimony. During the instructions at the beginning\n\nof trial, the jury was told: \"If I order testimony stricken from the record, you must\n\ndisregard it and must not consider that testimony for any purpose.\" When Detective\n\nCrisp made the two statements that defendant fit a child molester profile, the court\n\nimmediately sustained defense counsel's objections, struck the testimony, and told the\n\njury to disregard it. During the instructions just prior to deliberations, the court again told\n\n\n                                              21\n\fthe jury: \"During the trial, the attorneys may have objected to questions or moved to\n\nstrike answers given by the witnesses. . . . If I ordered testimony stricken from the\n\nrecord, you must disregard it and must not consider it for any purpose.\" Further[,] at this\n\njuncture the court gave the special pinpoint instruction stating: \"During the testimony of\n\nprosecution witness [r]etired Detective Brad Crisp, I ordered portions of the testimony\n\nstricken from the record. You must disregard those portions of testimony and must not\n\nconsider that testimony for any purpose.\" We presume the jurors followed these repeated\n\nadmonitions to disregard stricken testimony. (People v. Cox (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2639471\"><a href=\"/opinion/2639471/people-v-cox/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">916</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 961.)\n\n       We are not persuaded by defendant's contention that Detective Crisp's statements\n\nthat defendant fit a child molester profile were so prejudicial that the effect of the\n\ntestimony could not be cured. The trial court could reasonably assess that given the\n\nevidence properly presented to the jury, the profile statements were of minor significance.\n\nThe jury knew that defendant had admitted to molesting Doe when she was about five\n\nyears old, and heard detailed testimony to support that he resumed the molestation when\n\nDoe was about nine to 13 years old upon his return to the family home. Thus, the jury\n\nwas presented with extensive evidence showing defendant's pattern of ongoing\n\nmolestation. Further, this is not a case where the jury was exposed to a lengthy\n\ndelineation of inadmissible profile evidence. (See, e.g., People v. Robbie (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2269722\"><a href=\"/opinion/2269722/people-v-robbie/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rather, Detective Crisp's references to a child molester\n\nprofile were brief and nondescriptive, and the jury was quickly admonished not to\n\nconsider them.\n\n\n\n\n                                              22\n\f       Although Detective Crisp's repeat of testimony that had been stricken is not to be\n\ncondoned, the trial court reasonably concluded that his passing references to defendant\n\nfitting a child molester profile did not undermine the fairness of defendant's trial.\n\n             IV. Posttrial Denial of Request for Juror Identifying Information\n\n       Defendant asserts the trial court erred by denying his posttrial request for\n\nidentifying information for the jurors so his counsel could investigate whether the jury\n\nwas impacted by juror misconduct.\n\n                                       A. Background\n\nQuestioning of Juror No. 4 During Jury Deliberations\n\n       After the first day of jury deliberations (a Friday) and when the jury had been\n\ndismissed for the weekend, two jurors stayed behind in court, indicating that they wanted\n\nto talk to the court. The court instructed the bailiff to tell them to put their concerns in\n\nwriting. Each juror wrote the court a note, stating that Juror No. 4 had overheard the\n\nvictim speaking to others in the hallway; Juror No. 4 was having difficulty being\n\nobjective; and although Juror No. 4 was \"trying his best to be honest [and] fair\" he was\n\nfinding it hard to \" 'unring the bell.' \"8 The court told counsel it would thank the two\n\njurors for the notes and dismiss them for the weekend, and when the proceedings\n\nresumed it would question Juror No. 4 to determine if he \"has been compromised.\"\n\n\n8      One note said: \"During deliberations Juror 4 (I believe) had overheard [Doe]\nspeaking to others in the hall during the trial.

He is trying his best to be honest and fair but\nhas used the term 'finding it hard to unring the bell' when talking about it.\" The other\nnote said: \"One of the jurors has admitted to overhearing the victim speaking about the\ncase in the hallway. He is struggling to remain objective during deliberation.\"\n\n                                              23\n\fDefense counsel responded that he would like the court to also \"inquire whether the\n\njurors have been tainted if he made any comments other than he can't be fair.\" The court\n\nstated it was \"reluctant to get any detail, especially at this juncture.\"\n\n       When the proceedings resumed on Monday, the court told counsel it would\n\nquestion Juror No. 4, and counsel could submit any questions to the court that they\n\nwanted the court to ask. When Juror No. 4 was brought into the courtroom, the court told\n\nhim that it had received information that he may have \"overheard something by . . . [Doe]\n\nin the hallway,\" and asked if this was true. Juror No. 4 said that when he walked out of\n\nthe jury room to get some water, he heard \"one of the persons say, 'You should say this\n\nbecause he's going to say this.' \" Juror No. 4 then \"turned right back around and went\n\ninside.\" The court asked, \"So is that basically the extent of what you heard?\" and Juror\n\nNo. 4 answered yes. The court pointed out that the instructions tell the jurors to disregard\n\nanything they might hear from a party or witness other than when court is in session, and\n\nasked Juror No. 4 if he was \"having any trouble disregarding it.\" Juror No. 4 responded,\n\n\"No, not at all.\" Satisfied with this response, the court directed the jury to resume\n\ndeliberations, including Juror No. 4.\n\n       The court told counsel that in its view the inquiry was sufficient; Juror No 4 was\n\nnot troubled by what he inadvertently overheard and was following the instruction to\n\ndisregard it; the court did not believe it was \"in any . . . way affecting the jury\"; and if it\n\ndid affect the jury it would be to the prosecution's detriment by suggesting someone was\n\ntelling the complaining witness to say certain things that might not be true. When the\n\ncourt asked if there was any motion or other action it should take, both the prosecutor and\n\n\n                                               24\n\fdefense counsel responded no. Defense counsel elaborated, \"It just appears from Juror\n\nNumber 4's statement that he didn't hear the substance of what was indicated. So I agree\n\nwith the Court. I believe he can be fair.\"\n\nPosttrial Request for Juror Identifying Information\n\n       After the jury returned its guilty verdict, defense counsel filed a motion requesting\n\ndisclosure of the jurors' addresses and telephone numbers so he could interview them and\n\ndetermine if there were grounds for a new trial motion based on the juror misconduct\n\nreflected in the two notes from the jurors concerning Juror No. 4. Defense counsel stated\n\nit was never established who instructed Doe regarding what Doe should say, and he\n\nneeded to interview the jurors to ascertain \"exactly what transpired in the jury room,\"\n\nincluding information about how adamant Juror No. 4 was that he could not be fair,\n\nexactly what he told the other jurors he overheard, and how his statements impacted the\n\nability of each juror and the jury as a whole to be fair.\n\n       The court denied the motion for release of juror identifying information, finding\n\ndefendant had not made a prima facie showing of good cause for disclosure. The court\n\nstated its questioning of Juror No. 4 revealed no juror misconduct had occurred, and the\n\n\"vague non-specific suppositions\" of the other two jurors were \"effectively put to rest\" by\n\nthe court's questioning of Juror No. 4, whom the court found to be credible. Further,\n\ndefense counsel had the opportunity to submit questions to Juror No. 4, acknowledged\n\nthat Juror No. 4 had not heard any substantive information, agreed that Juror No. 4 could\n\nbe fair, and did not request further inquiry or that Juror No. 4 be removed.\n\n\n\n\n                                              25\n\f                                      B.

Analysis\n\n        Here, two jurors told the court that Juror No. 4 heard communications with Doe in\n\nthe hallway, and although he was trying to be fair, he was struggling to be objective. The\n\ntwo reporting jurors did not indicate that Juror No. 4 had told any jurors the contents of\n\nwhat he overheard, and the two jurors made no suggestion that they, or any other jurors,\n\nhad been exposed to information that affected their impartiality. Rather, their sole\n\nconcern was with the difficulties of Juror No. 4. When the court questioned Juror No. 4,\n\nhe assured the court he had disregarded the statements he had heard, and the court\n\ncredited this assurance. When the court asked counsel if they wanted the court to do\n\nanything further, both counsel responded no, and defense counsel explicitly stated he\n\nthought Juror No. 4 could be fair.\n\n        From the information received from the two jurors who reported their concerns\n\nand the questioning of Juror No. 4, the trial court could reasonably assess that Juror No. 4\n\nwas not exposed to anything that ultimately overwhelmed his ability to be impartial. The\n\n\n                                             27\n\fcourt could deduce that the difficulties observed on Friday by the two reporting jurors\n\nwere resolved by Juror No. 4 (who was reportedly trying hard to be impartial) by the time\n\nthe court questioned him on Monday. This is supported by the fact that neither the\n\nprosecutor nor defense counsel expressed any concerns about Juror No. 4 after the court\n\nquestioned him.\n\n       As to the matter of the jury's impartiality as a whole, the court could consider that\n\nif Juror No. 4 had conveyed any information to the other jurors that might have affected\n\ntheir ability to be fair, the two reporting jurors would have apprised the court of this\n\nconcern given the diligence with which they reported their concerns about Juror No. 4.\n\nThe failure of the two reporting jurors to raise any concerns about the impartiality of the\n\njury as a whole supports that Juror No. 4's statements to the jury had no effect on anyone\n\nbut him. This conclusion is supported by the fact that although defense counsel initially\n\nrequested that the court inquire about the impact on the other jurors, he did not renew this\n\nrequest after the court questioned Juror No. 4. Although defense counsel filed a posttrial\n\nmotion seeking to further explore the matter, his failure to raise any concerns at the time\n\nJuror No. 4 was questioned suggests that Juror No. 4's demeanor and responses satisfied\n\nhim that there had been no impact on the impartiality of the jury.\n\n       Although additional questioning of Juror No. 4 and/or other jurors would have\n\nbeen helpful to create a more complete record, the court and counsel's handling of the\n\nmatter revealed sufficient information to rebut the presumption of prejudice arising from\n\nJuror No. 4's exposure to extrajudicial information. The court reasonably found that\n\ndefendant did not make a prima facie showing of prejudicial juror misconduct, and\n\n\n                                             28\n\faccordingly did not abuse its discretion in denying the request for disclosure of juror\n\nidentifying information.\n\n                                   V. Sentencing Issues\n\n            A. Sentencing Court's Consideration of Evidence Excluded at Trial\n\n                                    on Miranda Grounds\n\n        Defendant argues that when making its sentencing decisions, the court erred by\n\nconsidering his pretrial admission that he molested his daughter, which had been\n\nexcluded from the prosecution's case-in-chief on Miranda grounds.\n\n                                      1. Background\n\n        Prior to trial, defendant moved to exclude a correctional officer's testimony about\n\nan admission that defendant made when he was arrested in 2010 for the current charges\n\nand brought to jail for booking. According to the correctional officer, during a routine\n\nbooking inquiry about the reason for defendant's arrest (designed to determine whether an\n\ninmate should be segregated for safety reasons), defendant said he was arrested for\n\nmolesting his daughter. As the officer continued to inquire about what happened and\n\nwhether defendant did it, defendant told the officer that the charges were true and he\n\nprovided details until the officer became upset and told defendant not to tell him anything\n\nmore.\n\n\n\n\n                                             29\n\f       The prosecution conceded the evidence was inadmissible in the prosecution's case-\n\nin-chief because defendant had earlier invoked his Miranda right to silence and he was\n\nnot provided additional Miranda warnings when he made the admission.9\n\n       At sentencing after the jury's guilty verdict—for purposes of evaluating the\n\ncredibility of defendant's mother's claim at the sentencing hearing that defendant had\n\nnever molested Doe—the court stated it would consider the correctional officer's\n\nstatement that defendant admitted molesting Doe when he was booked for the current\n\ncharges. While addressing the court at sentencing, defendant's mother stated that when\n\ndefendant pled guilty in 1998 he \"took the fall in order to keep his family together,\"\n\nexplaining that he pled guilty so his children would be taken out of foster care and\n\nreturned to his wife, charges which had also been filed against his wife would be\n\ndismissed, and his wife (who was not a citizen) would not be deported. Defendant's\n\nmother maintained that Doe's mother was responsible for the molestation charges against\n\ndefendant, and in support raised a variety of claims concerning the bad character of Doe's\n\nmother and her influence on Doe.\n\n       After hearing the statements from defendant's mother and other individuals, the\n\ncourt said that it would consider defendant's excluded admission to the correctional\n\nofficer solely for purposes of evaluating the credibility of defendant's mother's claim that\n\ndefendant never molested Doe. The court emphasized that when evaluating the crimes of\n\n\n9     The correctional officer's testimony about defendant's non-Mirandized admissions\nwas presented during an Evidence Code section 402 hearing at defendant's first trial, at\nwhich time the court excluded the testimony. At defendant's second trial, the prosecutor\nconceded the evidence was inadmissible.\n\n                                             30\n\fwhich defendant was convicted by the jury, it would not consider the non-Mirandized\n\nadmission but would only consider the evidence presented at trial.\n\n       Thereafter, the court explained at length the reasoning underlying its sentencing\n\ndecisions. The court rejected the claim that defendant pled guilty in 1998 to protect his\n\nwife from being prosecuted. The court stated it was \"very clear\" from defendant's\n\nvarious statements (including to Detective Crisp, a mental health professional, and a\n\nprobation officer) that he committed the molestation charged in the 1998 case; during this\n\ntime period defendant explained his inability to control his urges and he requested and\n\nreceived mental health treatment; and he served about eight months in jail and was\n\neventually reunited with his family. When defendant returned to his family, he resumed\n\nthe molestation, committing it on multiple occasions; the jury convicted him of seven\n\nseparate offenses; and the offenses were \"horrific acts by somebody who was clearly and\n\nunquestionably a child molester, who could not or would not be helped . . . .\"\n\n       The court elaborated that although defendant's family members may believe he is\n\nnot a child molester, it was clear to the court that defendant \"molested his own daughter\n\nrepeatedly, that he did it over a significant period of time in different locations, that he\n\nknew what he was doing, he planned out many of them, not all of them, and he did it\n\nrepeatedly for his own sexual gratification . . . . [¶] . . . [H]e just chose not to seek help,\n\nwhich he was very well aware of, he knew where he could get it. . . . He chose instead to\n\nrevictimize [Doe] over again . . . . [¶] The nature of the molestations was horrific, and\n\nthere was even testimony of an animal involved, and it just doesn't get worse than the\n\nconduct [defendant] engaged in in this particular case. [¶] Each of the facts that were\n\n\n                                              31\n\ffound true by the jury that the Court is going to sentence on, they were all separate. . . .\n\n[¶] So the acts that the jury found true beyond a reasonable doubt were just one of many\n\nthat he engaged in for a period of many, many years. [¶] I do find that given all the\n\nevidence in the case, including the statements made by [defendant] in the 1998 case that\n\nwere admitted before the jury in this trial, as well as considering all of the evidence that\n\nwas presented during the course of the trial including the victim's testimony, that the acts\n\nwere committed. [¶] . . . The victim was very credible as far as her telling what she could\n\nabout when they occurred. [¶] She testified as to each of the actions. She had made\n\ndisclosures to people early on. And she ultimately made disclosures and reported it to\n\nlaw enforcement when she became older and was able to detail those out in more\n\nparticularities.\" (Italics added.)\n\n       The court set forth additional matters concerning the case, including a statutory\n\nrequirement that it impose consecutive sentences, and ultimately imposed a term of 300\n\nyears to life plus a 34-year determinate term.\n\n                                         2. Analysis\n\n       Assuming, without deciding, that at sentencing the court could not properly\n\nconsider defendant's non-Mirandized admission to the correctional officer, the record\n\nshows defendant's incriminating statements to the correctional officer were of minimal\n\nconsequence at the sentencing hearing; hence, any error was harmless beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.

When the court explained the reasoning underlying its sentencing\n\ndecisions, it focused on the evidence presented at trial and other matters properly before\n\nit. The court delineated its view of the trial evidence, found Doe to be credible, and\n\nconcluded defendant's guilt was clearly established.\n\n       We have no doubt the court's sentencing decision would have been the same even\n\nwithout consideration of defendant's admission to the correctional officer. There is no\n\nbasis for reversal of the sentence on this ground.11\n\n                   B. Challenges to $400,000 Victim Restitution Award\n\n       Section 1202.4 requires the trial court, in conjunction with sentencing, to order the\n\ndefendant to pay restitution to the victim to compensate the victim for economic loss\n\nsuffered as a result of the defendant's conduct.

The Apprendi rule is designed to safeguard a defendant's right to\n\nhave a jury decide all the elements of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt, and it\n\nextends the jury factfinding requirement to sentencing factors that are viewed as akin to\n\nelements of the offense because they increase the punishment for the offense above what\n\nis otherwise statutorily prescribed.

(f)(3)(F)) directs the\n\ncourt to compensate the victim for noneconomic losses when a defendant violates section\n\n288. Thus, the jury's section 288 guilty verdict authorizes the award, and the court\n\nmerely determines the existence and amount of the noneconomic loss. In this\n\ncircumstance, the court is not making a factual finding that mandates an increase in the\n\nparticular statutory penalty prescribed for the offense that would otherwise apply, nor is it\n\nencroaching upon an area of factfinding traditionally reserved for the jury. Rather, the\n\ncourt is exercising its discretion to assess and calculate the victim's losses so as to impose\n\n\n                                             37\n\fa consequence that is collateral to the penalty prescribed for the offense.

Denehy, supra, 2 N.E.3d at p. 174 [\"We distinguish [victim] restitution\n\nfrom punishments such as imprisonment and criminal fines that are accompanied by\n\nstatutory prescriptions.\"].) As recognized by the United States Supreme Court in Oregon\n\nv. Ice when concluding consecutive sentences were outside Apprendi: \"Trial judges often\n\nfind facts about . . . orders of restitution. . . . Intruding Apprendi's rule into these\n\ndecisions on sentencing choices or accoutrements surely would cut the rule loose from its\n\nmoorings.\" (Oregon v. Ice, supra, 555 U.S. at pp. 171-172.)\n\n       Further, a victim restitution award is designed as a civil remedy to compensate the\n\nvictim for his or her losses, and it is not so onerous or akin to traditional punishment as to\n\nbe deemed penal in effect. (People v. Wasbotten, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 309;\n\nPeople v. Pangan, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at p. 585; People v. Millard, supra, 175\n\nCal.App.4th at pp. 35-36; see People v.

As our court explained in Millard,\n\nthe \"primary purpose of victim restitution hearings is to allow the People to prosecute an\n\nexpedited hearing before a trial court to provide a victim with a civil remedy\n\nfor . . . losses suffered, and not to punish the defendant for his or her crime. . . .

In support, he argues the noneconomic loss\n\naward applies only to defendants convicted of violating section 288; the amount of the\n\naward turns on factors related to the circumstances of the crime such as its duration or\n\nseverity; and there is no \"built-in proportionality limitation\" since it is not based on\n\nactual, demonstrated loss. We are not persuaded. As we explained above, a victim\n\nrestitution award—whether it be for noneconomic or economic losses—involves factual\n\ndeterminations that are collateral to the particular punishment prescribed for the offense;\n\nthe award is intended to equate with civil compensation rather than a penalty; and it is not\n\nso harsh or in the nature of traditional punishment as to necessitate a penalty\n\nclassification.\n\n       The court's factual findings concerning the direct victim restitution award did not\n\ninvoke the Apprendi rule. Given our holding, we need not address the Attorney General's\n\ncontention of forfeiture.\n\n             2. Claim that Restitution Amount Is Unsupported and Excessive\n\n       Defendant argues the $400,000 restitution award for noneconomic damages must\n\nbe stricken because it is unsupported by the record and excessive. He contends there was\n\n\n                                              39\n\fno substantial evidence that Doe suffered lasting psychological harm, noting she did not\n\nappear at the sentencing or restitution hearing, she did not submit a claim, and there was\n\nevidence that she was doing well, including attending college, working, and maintaining\n\na stable relationship. He also claims the court failed to adequately explain how it\n\ncalculated the amount. Further, he asserts that contrary to the holding in People v. Smith,\n\nsupra, 198 Cal.App.4th at page 436, the amount of the noneconomic damage award\n\nshould be evaluated under an abuse of discretion standard rather than a shocking-to-the-\n\nconscience standard.\n\n       We need not evaluate the standard of review because the record supports the\n\n$400,000 award even under an abuse of discretion standard.

The court\n\nreasonably determined that defendant's conduct of molesting Doe during a large part of\n\nher childhood caused serious psychological harm and emotional distress to her, and hence\n\na substantial noneconomic loss award was warranted.\n\n       At trial Doe described the lack of sexual normalcy and emotional anguish that she\n\nhas experienced because of the molestation and that she will likely continue to experience\n\nfor the rest of her life. She expressed similar sentiments when interviewed by probation\n\nofficers in 2012 and 2013. When interviewed in 2012, Doe initially \"expressed courage\"\n\nand stated she was \"ready to be interviewed in order to put this incident behind her.\"\n\nHowever, when she started talking to the probation officer about the molestation, this\n\n\"caused her to completely break down and cry. She managed to keep her composure at\n\n\n                                             40\n\ftimes and would take breaks in order to catch her breath. [She] was able to carry out the\n\ninterview and wiped her tears after every statement she made. [¶] . . . [She] wanted to\n\nmake the court aware that this incident has affected her tremendously. . . . [¶] . . . [N]ow\n\n[as] an adult [she] realizes the horrible nightmare she lived with her father.\" Doe also\n\ntold the probation officer she wanted defendant to receive a life sentence, noting that the\n\ntime defendant would have served pursuant to his earlier guilty plea (later withdrawn)\n\nwould have been \"minimal compared to the time she suffered and will continue to suffer\n\nfor the remainder of her life.\" During the 2013 interview, Doe told the probation officer\n\nthat she is trying to move on with her life; she has yet to undergo counseling \"due to her\n\nmistrust of men\" and she hopes to seek counseling once she finds a suitable counselor;\n\nand she \"has been permanently impacted to the point [that] talking about it causes\n\nemotional pain to return.\"\n\n       At the restitution hearing, defense counsel objected to the court's tentative decision\n\nto award $500,000 for noneconomic losses, and requested that the court reduce the award\n\nto $250,000. The court stated it had considered Doe's trial testimony and her statements\n\nto the probation officers concerning the impact of defendant's conduct on her. Further, it\n\nhad reviewed civil jury instructions concerning the calculation of past and future\n\nemotional distress damages, including CACI No. 3905A and the life expectancy table\n\n\n\n\n                                             41\n\fincluded in the CACI instructions.13 Based on these considerations, the court concluded\n\n$400,000 was an appropriate amount for noneconomic damages.\n\n       Doe's statements at trial and to the probation officers support that she has suffered\n\nsevere emotional trauma because of the molestation, and that the effects of the trauma\n\nwill likely endure throughout her life. The court was entitled to credit these statements\n\nthat defendant's conduct had caused serious, lasting psychological distress to her.\n\nFurther, the court explained its calculation method, stating that it relied on the guidelines\n\nused to determine past and future emotional distress damages in the civil context.\n\nDefendant has not shown that the court abused its discretion or otherwise erred in\n\nawarding $400,000 for noneconomic losses.\n\nC. Habitual Sex Offender Sentences Should Be Dismissed Given Imposition of Sentence\n\n                        Under the One Strike Sex Offender Scheme\n\n       For each of counts 1 through 6, the court imposed a sentence of 25 years to life\n\nunder the One Strike sex offender statute (§ 667.61) based on defendant's commission of\n\na statutorily specified sex offense under a statutorily specified circumstance, and doubled\n\neach sentence (to 50 years to life) under the Three Strikes statute based on defendant's\n\nprior strike conviction (§ 667, subd. (e)(1)). Additionally for each of these counts, the\n\ncourt imposed another sentence of 25 years to life under the Habitual Sex Offender\n\nstatute (§ 667.71) based on defendant's prior sex offense conviction, and doubled the\n\n\n13      CACI No. 3905A states that there is no fixed standard for noneconomic damages;\nthe trier of fact must use its judgment to decide a reasonable amount based on the\nevidence and common sense; and recovery for future damages requires proof that the\nperson is reasonably certain to suffer that harm.\n\n                                             42\n\fsentence (to 50 years to life) under the Three Strikes statute. The court then stayed the\n\nhabitual sex offender sentences under section 654. Defendant argues the trial court was\n\nrequired to dismiss, rather than stay, the sentences imposed under the Habitual Sex\n\nOffender statute.\n\n       There is a split in authority among the lower appellate courts as to whether the\n\ncourt should stay or dismiss sentences when both the Habitual Sex Offender statute and\n\nthe One Strike sex offender statute apply.

Johnson, supra, 96 Cal.App.4th at pp. 207-\n\n209.) In the interests of consistency within our division, we conclude this is the\n\nappropriate procedure to follow unless and until the California Supreme Court resolves\n\nthe issue otherwise. Accordingly, we shall modify the judgment to order that the habitual\n\nsex offender sentences on counts 1 through 6 be dismissed.\n\n\n                                            43\n\f                              VI.
