Brunswick Corp., 207 F.3d 1039, 1063 (8th\nCir.), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 979 (2000), appellant Brunswick Corporation returned\nto the district court seeking an award of costs as the prevailing party. Brunswick\nrequested $2,041,743.68 in costs, including $619,598.031 as reimbursement for its\ncopying expenses. The district court awarded it $913,917.80 in costs, which included\n$371,858.65 for copies, but declined to impose joint and several liability. On its\nappeal, Brunswick only challenges the amount of costs awarded for photocopying and\nthe allocation of costs among the boat companies. After the initial briefing by the\nparties, we remanded to the district court for further consideration and findings.\nConcord Boat Corp. v. Brunswick Corp., 17 Fed. Appx. 491, 493–94 (8th Cir. 2001)\n(per curiam). The district court then issued a more detailed order awarding the same\n\n\n\n      1\n      The record contains more than one figure for the amount of Brunswick's\nphotocopying cost request. The district court used three different figures without\nexplanation: in its initial order on costs it stated that the amount requested was\n$619,764.43, but in its supplemental order it both stated that the request was\n$610,598.03 and elsewhere that it was $619,598.03. The latter figure is the same\namount requested in the supplemental affidavit submitted by Brunswick, and it\nappears from the record to be the amount requested. (Brunswick App. at A99\n(Supplemental Affidavit of Robert F. Finke.))\n\n                                        -2-\n\famount of copying costs and using the same percentages to apportion liability. We\nreverse.\n\n                                            I.\n\n       In its initial briefing, Brunswick argued that the district court had abused its\ndiscretion by apportioning costs among the boat companies instead of holding them\njointly and severally liable. It also attacked the use of a percentage basis for\nallocation which was derived from the damage calculations of plaintiffs' trial expert,\nwhose opinion lacked foundation. Brunswick asserted that the court had abused its\ndiscretion in not awarding its requested copying costs in contrast to the way plaintiffs'\ncost request had been handled when they were the prevailing parties. The boat\ncompanies responded to these arguments by saying that the district court had not\nabused its discretion. In light of the general rule for joint and several liability and the\nabbreviated nature of the order apportioning costs and reducing copying costs, we\nremanded for further consideration and findings by the district court.\n\n       The district court issued a supplemental order. The court stated that it would\nbe unfair to award costs on a joint and several basis because that approach would\nhave a disproportionate impact on those plaintiffs who would have recovered less\nthan others under the damage calculations of their expert, Dr. Robert Hall. It\nreasoned that apportioning costs on an individual basis would result in each plaintiff\nbeing responsible for an amount of costs corresponding to its participation in the\nantitrust action and that Dr. Hall's allocation of damages among the boat companies\nhad not been invalidated. The district court identified a number of factors it relied on\nin reducing the photocopy award: insufficient documentation, Brunswick's\ncomparatively larger copying costs and number of attorneys and paralegals, and\nBrunswick's failure to make a reduction from its charged cost and for copies related\nto unsuccessful pretrial work.\n\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\f       In its supplemental briefing, Brunswick again asserts that the district court\nabused its discretion in apportioning costs and in sharply cutting the amount of its\nphotocopy requests. Brunswick argues that the district court identified no rational,\nnonarbitrary reason to reject joint and several liability and no reason why Dr. Hall's\nopinion provides a valid basis for allocating costs. It argues that apportioning costs\namong the boat companies would make collection very difficult and possibly\nimpossible for substantial portions of the award. Brunswick also argues that no\nsound reason has been given for such a large reduction to photocopy costs,\nparticularly in light of the court's earlier treatment of plaintiffs' cost request. The boat\ncompanies respond that costs are within the discretion of the district court and that,\nfor the reasons given by the district court, it did not abuse that discretion.\n\n                                            II.\n\n                                            A.\n\n       We review the district court's decision to allocate costs on an individual basis\nfor an abuse of discretion. See In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig., 221 F.3d 449,\n468–69 (3d Cir. 2000); cf. Southern Agency Co. v. La Salle Cas. Co., 393 F.2d 907,\n915 n.7 (8th Cir. 1968) (pro rata apportionment of costs in parallel cases involving\nsame prevailing party should be reviewed for an abuse of discretion). A district court\nabuses its discretion when, among other things, it fails to consider \"a relevant factor\nthat should have been given significant weight.\" Verizon Communications, Inc. v.\nInverizon Int'l, Inc., 295 F.3d 870, 872–73 (8th Cir. 2002) (quoting Kern v. TXO\nProd. Corp., 738 F.2d 968, 970 (8th Cir. 1984)).\n\n       Joint and several liability for costs is the general rule unless equity otherwise\ndictates. In re Paoli, 221 F.3d at 469. The district court's reason for allocating costs\nindividually—that the boat companies sought varying amounts of damages—is not\na sufficient reason to depart from this rule. Since individual plaintiffs frequently do\n\n                                            -4-\n\fnot seek the same amount of damages, this approach would create an exception that\nswallows the rule. Moreover, all the plaintiffs in this case were represented by the\nsame counsel, had common theories of liability, and sought the same discovery. They\nalso all asked for the same powerful equitable relief in addition to damages—an order\ndivesting Brunswick of several of its businesses and enjoining it from employing\nparticular business practices. See Concord Boat, 207 F.3d at 1048. In these\ncircumstances, it cannot be said that any individual plaintiff generated more costs\nthan others. Cf. White v. Sundstrand Corp., 256 F.3d 580, 586 (7th Cir.), cert.\ndenied, 122 S. Ct. 666 (2001) (individual costs awards may be appropriate when\n\"different groups of plaintiffs raise distinct issues that give rise to segregable costs\nof litigation\") (emphasis added); Walker v. U.S. Dept. of Hous. & Urban Dev., 99\nF.3d 761, 773 (5th Cir. 1996) (joint and several liability for attorney fees appropriate\nwhere parties had joint legal team and shared witnesses). Indeed, there has been no\nshowing that Dr. Hall's testimony about each plaintiff's share of the total amount of\ndamages relates in any way to costs generated. Correlating costs only to the amount\nof damages a party hoped to recover is not a useful model, for there are additional\nfactors which are relevant in considering a party's role in the litigation.\n\n        Other equities also favor joint and several liability. Imposing only individual\nliability here would be inconsistent with the presumption embodied in Rule 54(d) of\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that a prevailing party is entitled to recover all\nof its costs. See Blake v. J.C. Penney Co., Inc., 894 F.2d 274, 281 (8th Cir. 1990).\nThe expense of collection and the potential insolvency of several parties make it\nlikely that Brunswick would not recover a substantial portion of its award without\njoint and several liability. In the absence of strong opposing considerations, it would\nbe inequitable to place the risk of noncollection on the prevailing party. Joint and\nseveral liability should not unfairly force any boat company to bear the costs alone,\nhowever. The companies could allocate the risk of costs among themselves, or any\nparty satisfying the judgment could seek contribution from the others. See Prestidge\nv. Prestidge, 810 F.2d 159, 162 (8th Cir. 1987) (citing Thorsen v. Poe, 184 S.W. 427,\n\n                                          -5-\n\f428 (Ark. 1916) (\"[W]here several parties are equally liable for the same debt, or\nbound to the discharge of an obligation, and one is compelled to pay or satisfy the\nwhole of it, he may have contribution against the others to obtain payment for their\nrespective shares.\")).\n\n      In these circumstances it was an abuse of discretion not to take into account all\nrelevant factors and to depart from the general rule for joint and several liability.\n\n                                            B.\n\n       Brunswick challenges the forty percent discount applied to its copying cost\nrequest. It points out that its request already included a voluntary fifteen percent\nreduction to account for convenience copies. This corresponded to the percentage\nreduction imposed by the district court in its earlier order awarding costs to the\nplaintiffs.\n\n       Expenses for photocopies \"necessarily obtained for use in the case\" are\nrecoverable by the prevailing party as costs. 28 U.S.C. § 1920 (2000). Rule 54(d)\ndirects that costs, such as necessary photocopies, \"shall be allowed as of course to the\nprevailing party unless the court otherwise directs.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d). In\ndetermining whether a photocopy expense is necessary so as to be taxable as a cost\nand whether to award that cost to the prevailing party, the district court enjoys\ndiscretion so long as it does not act arbitrarily. See In re Paoli, 221 F.3d at 458\n(award); Kropp v. Ziebarth, 601 F.2d 1348, 1358 n.27 (8th Cir. 1979) (award);\nKemart Corp. v. Printing Arts Research Labs., 232 F.2d 897, 905 (9th Cir. 1956)\n(necessity of photocopy expenses). An abuse of discretion occurs when, among other\nthings, the district court \"'consider[s] and give[s] significant weight'\" to \"'an irrelevant\nor improper factor'\" or \"'commits a clear error of judgment'\" when it exercises its\ndiscretion. Verizon, 295 F.3d at 872–73 (quoting Kern, 738 F.2d at 970).\n\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\f        After carefully reviewing the record, we conclude that several of the factors to\nwhich the district court gave significant weight in reducing the award do not support\nits decision. The court believed that Brunswick was charged a higher copy cost than\nplaintiffs and that it should therefore have voluntarily reduced the amount it\nrequested. When an expense is taxable as a cost, however, there is a strong\npresumption that a prevailing party shall recover it \"in full measure.\" In re Paoli, 221\nF.3d at 462, 468; see Zotos v. Lindbergh Sch. Dist., 121 F.3d 356, 363 (8th Cir.\n1997). The \"losing party bears the burden of making the showing that an award is\ninequitable under the circumstances.\" In re Paoli, 221 F.3d at 462–63. The court\nappeared to accord no significance to this presumption in favor of the prevailing\nparty, but instead based the reduction on an assumption about the rate Brunswick was\ncharged for copies. The burden was on the boat companies to show that Brunswick's\nrequest was inequitable, not on the prevailing party, and Brunswick had indicated its\nwillingness to provide further information. Another reason given for reducing the\ncosts request was for dismissal or abandonment of claims or damage theories before\ntrial, a reason used to discount the plaintiffs' earlier request in light of numerous\npretrial setbacks. It is not disputed, however, that none of Brunswick's counterclaims\nwas dismissed before trial and the only damage theory it abandoned was a minor\nsubpoint to the antitrust counterclaim later submitted to the jury. This basis to reduce\ncopy costs therefore lacks support in the record as applied to Brunswick. The district\ncourt also penalized Brunswick for the comparatively large size of its legal team, but\nas plaintiffs' counsel admitted at oral argument, Brunswick had more at risk in the\nlitigation. Finally, the court deemed the documentation provided by Brunswick to be\ninsufficient, but it appears to have been comparable to that supplied by the plaintiffs,\nwho were awarded eighty five percent of their adjusted request as opposed to sixty\npercent for Brunswick (adjustments reflecting the deduction for convenience copies).\n\n      Most of the district court’s reductions to Brunswick’s costs request were not\nchallenged on appeal, but we conclude that the court abused its discretion in relying\non several unsupported factors to reduce copying costs to the extent it did. Based on\n\n                                          -7-\n\four review of the record, we conclude that it supports no more than a fifteen percent\nreduction to Brunswick's request for copy costs and that Brunswick is entitled to an\naward of $526,658.33 for its photocopy costs. This amount added to the undisputed\ncosts awarded by the district court ($542,059.15) results in a total cost award of\n$1,068,717.48.\n\n                                        III.\n\n       Accordingly, we reverse, vacate the costs judgment, and remand to the district\ncourt for entry of an order awarding costs in favor of Brunswick in the amount of\n$1,068,717.48, to be assessed against plaintiffs jointly and severally.\n\n      A true copy.\n\n             Attest:\n\n                CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\f",

It\nreasoned that apportioning costs on an individual basis would result in each plaintiff\nbeing responsible for an amount of costs corresponding to its participation in the\nantitrust action and that Dr. Hall's allocation of damages among the boat companies\nhad not been invalidated. The district court identified a number of factors it relied on\nin reducing the photocopy award: insufficient documentation, Brunswick's\ncomparatively larger copying costs and number of attorneys and paralegals, and\nBrunswick's failure to make a reduction from its charged cost and for copies related\nto unsuccessful pretrial work.\n\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\f       In its supplemental briefing, Brunswick again asserts that the district court\nabused its discretion in apportioning costs and in sharply cutting the amount of its\nphotocopy requests. Brunswick argues that the district court identified no rational,\nnonarbitrary reason to reject joint and several liability and no reason why Dr. Hall's\nopinion provides a valid basis for allocating costs. It argues that apportioning costs\namong the boat companies would make collection very difficult and possibly\nimpossible for substantial portions of the award. Brunswick also argues that no\nsound reason has been given for such a large reduction to photocopy costs,\nparticularly in light of the court's earlier treatment of plaintiffs' cost request. The boat\ncompanies respond that costs are within the discretion of the district court and that,\nfor the reasons given by the district court, it did not abuse that discretion.\n\n                                            II.\n\n                                            A.\n\n       We review the district court's decision to allocate costs on an individual basis\nfor an abuse of discretion.

In re Paoli, 221 F.3d at 469. The district court's reason for allocating costs\nindividually—that the boat companies sought varying amounts of damages—is not\na sufficient reason to depart from this rule. Since individual plaintiffs frequently do\n\n                                            -4-\n\fnot seek the same amount of damages, this approach would create an exception that\nswallows the rule. Moreover, all the plaintiffs in this case were represented by the\nsame counsel, had common theories of liability, and sought the same discovery. They\nalso all asked for the same powerful equitable relief in addition to damages—an order\ndivesting Brunswick of several of its businesses and enjoining it from employing\nparticular business practices. See Concord Boat, 207 F.3d at 1048. In these\ncircumstances, it cannot be said that any individual plaintiff generated more costs\nthan others. Cf. White v. Sundstrand Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773962\"><a href=\"/opinion/773962/william-r-white-on-behalf-of-themselves-and-a-class-of-others-similarly/\"><span class=\"volume\">256</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 586 (7th Cir.), cert.\ndenied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Indeed, there has been no\nshowing that Dr. Hall's testimony about each plaintiff's share of the total amount of\ndamages relates in any way to costs generated. Correlating costs only to the amount\nof damages a party hoped to recover is not a useful model, for there are additional\nfactors which are relevant in considering a party's role in the litigation.\n\n        Other equities also favor joint and several liability. Imposing only individual\nliability here would be inconsistent with the presumption embodied in Rule 54(d) of\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that a prevailing party is entitled to recover all\nof its costs. See Blake v. J.C. Penney Co., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"535301\"><a href=\"/opinion/535301/51-fair-emplpraccas-1564-52-empl-prac-dec-p-39577-euna-fay-blake-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">894</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 281 (8th Cir. 1990).\nThe expense of collection and the potential insolvency of several parties make it\nlikely that Brunswick would not recover a substantial portion of its award without\njoint and several liability. In the absence of strong opposing considerations, it would\nbe inequitable to place the risk of noncollection on the prevailing party. Joint and\nseveral liability should not unfairly force any boat company to bear the costs alone,\nhowever. The companies could allocate the risk of costs among themselves, or any\nparty satisfying the judgment could seek contribution from the others. See Prestidge\nv.

It points out that its request already included a voluntary fifteen percent\nreduction to account for convenience copies. This corresponded to the percentage\nreduction imposed by the district court in its earlier order awarding costs to the\nplaintiffs.\n\n       Expenses for photocopies \"necessarily obtained for use in the case\" are\nrecoverable by the prevailing party as costs. 28 U.S.C. § 1920 (2000). Rule 54(d)\ndirects that costs, such as necessary photocopies, \"shall be allowed as of course to the\nprevailing party unless the court otherwise directs.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d). In\ndetermining whether a photocopy expense is necessary so as to be taxable as a cost\nand whether to award that cost to the prevailing party, the district court enjoys\ndiscretion so long as it does not act arbitrarily.

An abuse of discretion occurs when, among other\nthings, the district court \"'consider[s] and give[s] significant weight'\" to \"'an irrelevant\nor improper factor'\" or \"'commits a clear error of judgment'\" when it exercises its\ndiscretion. Verizon, 295 F.3d at 872–73 (quoting Kern, 738 F.2d at 970).\n\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\f        After carefully reviewing the record, we conclude that several of the factors to\nwhich the district court gave significant weight in reducing the award do not support\nits decision. The court believed that Brunswick was charged a higher copy cost than\nplaintiffs and that it should therefore have voluntarily reduced the amount it\nrequested. When an expense is taxable as a cost, however, there is a strong\npresumption that a prevailing party shall recover it \"in full measure.\" In re Paoli, 221\nF.3d at 462, 468; see Zotos v. Lindbergh Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744649\"><a href=\"/opinion/744649/katherine-a-zotos-v-lindbergh-school-district-o-victor-lenz-jr-joseph/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 363 (8th Cir.\n1997). The \"losing party bears the burden of making the showing that an award is\ninequitable under the circumstances.\" In re Paoli, 221 F.3d at 462–63. The court\nappeared to accord no significance to this presumption in favor of the prevailing\nparty, but instead based the reduction on an assumption about the rate Brunswick was\ncharged for copies. The burden was on the boat companies to show that Brunswick's\nrequest was inequitable, not on the prevailing party, and Brunswick had indicated its\nwillingness to provide further information. Another reason given for reducing the\ncosts request was for dismissal or abandonment of claims or damage theories before\ntrial, a reason used to discount the plaintiffs' earlier request in light of numerous\npretrial setbacks. It is not disputed, however, that none of Brunswick's counterclaims\nwas dismissed before trial and the only damage theory it abandoned was a minor\nsubpoint to the antitrust counterclaim later submitted to the jury. This basis to reduce\ncopy costs therefore lacks support in the record as applied to Brunswick. The district\ncourt also penalized Brunswick for the comparatively large size of its legal team, but\nas plaintiffs' counsel admitted at oral argument, Brunswick had more at risk in the\nlitigation. Finally, the court deemed the documentation provided by Brunswick to be\ninsufficient, but it appears to have been comparable to that supplied by the plaintiffs,\nwho were awarded eighty five percent of their adjusted request as opposed to sixty\npercent for Brunswick (adjustments reflecting the deduction for convenience copies).\n\n      Most of the district court’s reductions to Brunswick’s costs request were not\nchallenged on appeal, but we conclude that the court abused its discretion in relying\non several unsupported factors to reduce copying costs to the extent it did. Based on\n\n                                          -7-\n\four review of the record, we conclude that it supports no more than a fifteen percent\nreduction to Brunswick's request for copy costs and that Brunswick is entitled to an\naward of $526,658.33 for its photocopy costs. This amount added to the undisputed\ncosts awarded by the district court ($542,059.15) results in a total cost award of\n$1,068,717.48.\n\n                                        III.\n\n       Accordingly, we reverse, vacate the costs judgment, and remand to the district\ncourt for entry of an order awarding costs in favor of Brunswick in the amount of\n$1,068,717.48, to be assessed against plaintiffs jointly and severally.\n\n      A true copy.\n\n             Attest:\n\n                CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\f</pre>",
