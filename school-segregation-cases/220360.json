After we heard the initial appeal of this case in\n\n1990, the Supreme Court established, for the first time, the\n\nstandards for determining in the university context whether a\n\nstate has met its affirmative obligation to dismantle its prior\n\nde jure system.   We now review the district court’s ruling\n\nfollowing trial on remand to determine whether it erred in its\n\napplication of these standards.\n\n     For the reasons set forth below, we affirm in part, reverse\n\nin part, and remand the case to the district court for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n                           I. BACKGROUND\n\n     Mississippi’s system of public four-year universities was\n\nformally segregated by race from its inception in 1848 through\n\n1962, when the first black student was admitted to the University\n\nof Mississippi by order of this court.     See Meredith v. Fair, 306\n\nF.2d 374 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 371 U.S. 828 (1962).    The\n\nracial identifiability of Mississippi’s eight public universities\n\nchanged little during the decade following the landmark admission\n\nof James Meredith.   The student composition of the University of\n\nMississippi, Mississippi State University, Mississippi University\n\n                                  4\n\ffor Women, University of Southern Mississippi, and Delta State\n\nUniversity (collectively, “historically white institutions” or\n\n“HWIs”) remained almost entirely white, while that of Jackson\n\nState University, Mississippi Valley State University, and Alcorn\n\nState University (collectively, “historically black institutions”\n\nor “HBIs”) remained almost entirely black.     See United States v.\n\nFordice, 505 U.S. 717, 722 (1992).    The racial identifiability of\n\nthese institutions persists to the present.1\n\n      Private plaintiffs initiated this class action2 in 1975,\n\ncomplaining that Mississippi was maintaining a racially dual\n\nsystem of higher education in violation of the Fifth, Ninth,\n\nThirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States\n\nConstitution, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1983, and Title VI of the\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000d to 2000d-7.    The\n\nUnited States intervened as plaintiff and alleged violations of\n\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title\n\nVI.\n\n      For twelve years the parties attempted to resolve their\n\ndifferences through voluntary dismantlement of the prior\n\n      1\n        In the fall of 1993, the on-campus undergraduate\nenrollment was at least 75% white at each of the HWIs, and at\nleast 93% black at each of the HBIs.\n      2\n          The class was certified by the court as:\n\n      [a]ll black citizens residing in Mississippi, whether\n      students, former students, parents, employees, or\n      taxpayers, who have been, are, or will be discriminated\n      against on account of race in . . . the universities\n      operated by said Board of Trustees.\n\nAyers v. Allain, 674 F. Supp. 1523, 1526 (N.D. Miss. 1987).\n\n                                  5\n\fsegregated system.    Unable to achieve ultimate agreement, the\n\nparties proceeded to trial in 1987.    The district court ruled\n\nthat Mississippi had discharged its affirmative duty to dismantle\n\nthe former de jure segregated system of higher education through\n\nits adoption and implementation of good-faith, race-neutral\n\npolicies and procedures in student admissions and other areas.\n\nAyers v. Allain, 674 F. Supp. 1523, 1564 (N.D. Miss. 1987) (Ayers\n\nI).   Sitting en banc, this court affirmed.   Ayers v. Allain, 914\n\nF.2d 676 (5th Cir. 1990).    The United States Supreme Court\n\ngranted certiorari.    Ayers v. Mabus, 499 U.S. 958 (1991).\n\n      The Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded for\n\nfurther proceedings, holding that the mere adoption and\n\nimplementation of race-neutral policies was insufficient to\n\ndemonstrate complete abandonment of the racially dual system.\n\nFordice, 505 U.S. at 731, 743.    The Court stated that\n\n      even after a State dismantles its segregative\n      admissions policy, there may still be state action that\n      is traceable to the State’s prior de jure segregation\n      and that continues to foster segregation. . . . If\n      policies traceable to the de jure system are still in\n      force and have discriminatory effects, those policies\n      too must be reformed to the extent practicable and\n      consistent with sound educational practices.\n\nId. at 729.   Applying this standard, the Court identified\n\nadmissions standards, program duplication, institutional mission\n\nassignments, and continued operation of all eight public\n\nuniversities as a nonexclusive list of “constitutionally suspect”\n\nremnants of the prior de jure system, “for even though such\n\npolicies may be race neutral on their face, they substantially\n\nrestrict a person’s choice of which institution to enter, and\n\n                                  6\n\fthey contribute to the racial identifiability of the eight public\n\nuniversities.   Mississippi must justify these policies or\n\neliminate them.”   Id. at 733.   The Court directed that these and\n\n“each of the other policies now governing the State’s university\n\nsystem that have been challenged or that are challenged on\n\nremand” be examined “in light of the standard that we articulate\n\ntoday.”   Id.\n\n     On remand, the district court ordered each party to submit\n\nproposed remedies “to resolve the areas of the State’s liability\n\npursuant to the Supreme Court mandate.”   Without conceding\n\nliability, defendant Board of Trustees of State Institutions of\n\nHigher Learning (the “Board”)3 responded by presenting a detailed\n\nproposal for modification of the higher education system.     This\n\nproposal contained, among other provisions, uniform standards of\n\nadmission for all universities, as well as a plan to merge Delta\n\nState University and Mississippi Valley State University into one\n\ninstitution to serve students in the Mississippi Delta.4\n\n     The private plaintiffs and the United States (collectively,\n\n“plaintiffs”) responded by insisting that the range of\n\n\n     3\n         The Board is responsible for the management and control\nof the eight public universities at issue in this case. MISS.\nCODE ANN. § 37-101-1 (1996). Its general powers and duties\ninclude, inter alia, managing all university property, disbursing\nfunds, establishing standards for admission and graduation, and\nsupervising the functioning of each institution. See id. § 37-\n101-15.\n     4\n        The Board submitted its original proposal to the district\ncourt on October 22, 1992. The Board submitted a modified\nproposal shortly before trial. The proposed admissions standards\nand merger plan were contained in both.\n\n                                  7\n\fconstitutionally suspect policies and practices to be examined on\n\nremand had yet to be determined.5    Pursuant to a subsequent court\n\norder, plaintiffs identified the following policies and practices\n\nfor examination:   admissions standards that allegedly deny black\n\nstudents equal access to higher education and tend to channel\n\nblack students to the HBIs; the use of ACT scores as a basis for\n\nawarding undergraduate scholarships at the HWIs; maintenance of\n\ninstitutional mission assignments that largely follow historical\n\nracial designations; funding policies that disproportionately\n\nbenefit the HWIs; allocation of academic programs that is\n\nunfavorable to the HBIs; allocation of land grant programs\n\nbetween Alcorn State and Mississippi State that is unfavorable to\n\nAlcorn; duplication of the HBIs’ programs and course offerings at\n\nthe HWIs; maintenance of facilities at the HBIs that are inferior\n\nto those at the HWIs; employment practices that perpetuate the\n\nracial identifiability of the universities and compensate faculty\n\nat the HBIs at a lower rate than faculty at the HWIs; maintenance\n\nof all eight institutions; and practices that limit the\n\nparticipation of black persons in system governance.    Trial\n\ncommenced on May 9, 1994, following lengthy attempts at\n\nsettlement.\n\n     After ten weeks of testimony, the district court made\n\n     5\n        Plaintiffs have alleged that the State’s policies and\npractices violate both the Constitution and Title VI. As the\nSupreme Court noted in Fordice, the reach of Title VI extends no\nfurther than the Fourteenth Amendment. 505 U.S. at 732 n.7. We\ntherefore follow the approach of the Supreme Court and treat the\nissues in this case as they are implicated under the\nConstitution. Id.\n\n                                 8\n\fadditional findings of fact and conclusions of law.   The district\n\ncourt found vestiges of de jure segregation in the areas of\n\nundergraduate admissions, institutional mission assignments,\n\nfunding, equipment availability and library allocations, program\n\nduplication, land grant programs, and number of universities.\n\nAyers v. Fordice, 879 F. Supp. 1419, 1477 (N.D. Miss. 1995)\n\n(Ayers II).6   The district court entered a remedial decree on\n\nMarch 7, 1995.7\n\n     The remedial decree enjoins defendants from maintaining\n\nremnants of the prior system and engaging in practices impeding\n\ndesegregation.    Specific relief includes adoption of the uniform\n\nadmissions standards proposed by the Board and allocation of\n\nadditional resources to Jackson State University and Alcorn State\n\nUniversity.    The district court did not order implementation of\n\nthe Board’s proposal to consolidate Delta State University and\n\nMississippi Valley State University.   The decree establishes a\n\nMonitoring Committee to monitor implementation of the terms and\n\nobligations imposed by the decree.    The Monitoring Committee is\n\nto consist of three disinterested persons with experience in the\n\nfield of higher education, agreed upon by the parties and\n\n\n     6\n        In addition, the district court found that the practice\nof maintaining participation in racially identifiable athletic\nconferences is traceable to de jure segregation but does not have\nsegregative effects. Athletic programs are not an issue in this\nappeal.\n     7\n        The remedial decree is set forth in its entirety in the\nopinion below, Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1494-96. We limit our\ndiscussion to those aspects of the remedial decree pertinent to\nthis appeal.\n\n                                  9\n\fappointed by the court.   The Monitoring Committee is to receive\n\nand evaluate reports required of defendants and make\n\nrecommendations to the district court, which has retained\n\njurisdiction over the action.8\n\n     Plaintiffs now contend that the district court left in place\n\npractices that are traceable to the prior dual system and that\n\nhave discriminatory effects and adopted reforms proposed by the\n\nBoard without examining the soundness or practicability of\n\nalternative, less discriminatory proposals.   Issues on appeal\n\nencompass undergraduate admissions standards, scholarship\n\ncriteria, enhancement of historically black universities, system\n\ngovernance, and employment.9   No party appeals the district\n\ncourt’s rejection of the Board’s consolidation proposal.\n\n\n\n                     II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n     The standard set forth by the Supreme Court in Fordice\n\nguides our review of the district court’s judgment.    Fordice\n\nestablished that “a State does not discharge its constitutional\n\nobligations until it eradicates policies and practices traceable\n\n\n     8\n        In an order entered on March 1, 1996, the district court\nstayed appointment of the Monitoring Committee, along with any\nreports required to be made to the Monitoring Committee, pending\ncompletion of “the appellate process.” We see no reason why the\nstay contemplated by the March 1 order should continue. We\nassume that the stay will be vacated and that the Monitoring\nCommittee will be activated promptly.\n     9\n        The scope of private plaintiffs’ argument on appeal is\nbroader in some respects than that of the United States, although\nthe two positions overlap considerably. We note distinctions\nwhere relevant.\n\n                                 10\n\fto its prior de jure dual system that continue to foster\n\nsegregation.”   505 U.S. at 728.    More specifically,\n\n     [i]f the State perpetuates policies and practices\n     traceable to its prior system that continue to have\n     segregative effects -- whether by influencing student\n     enrollment decisions or by fostering segregation in\n     other facets of the university system -- and such\n     policies are without sound educational justification\n     and can be practicably eliminated, the State has not\n     satisfied its burden of proving that it has dismantled\n     its prior system.\n\nId. at 731.   We have read Fordice to require that “each suspect\n\nstate policy or practice be analyzed to determine whether it is\n\ntraceable to the prior de jure system, whether it continues to\n\nfoster segregation, whether it lacks sound educational\n\njustification, and whether its elimination is practicable.”\n\nUnited States v. Louisiana, 9 F.3d 1159, 1164 (5th Cir. 1993).\n\nThe State’s liability depends upon these factors.        Id.10\n\n     Once liability is found, the offending policies and\n\npractices “must be reformed to the extent practicable and\n\nconsistent with sound educational practices.”     Fordice, 505 U.S.\n\nat 729.   “[S]urely the State may not leave in place policies\n\nrooted in its prior officially segregated system that serve to\n\nmaintain the racial identifiability of its universities if those\n\npolicies can practicably be eliminated without eroding sound\n\n     10\n        At this stage in a desegregation case, a state’s\n“liability” consists of its obligation to remedy remnants of a\nprior de jure system for which constitutional liability has\nalready been established. In Louisiana, we used the term\n“liability” in this sense of an affirmative obligation to remedy\nvestiges of the prior system. In the interest of consistency, we\ncontinue to use “liability” in this sense here, albeit with the\nunderstanding that the liability of the State of Mississippi, as\na threshold matter, stems from its operation of a de jure system.\n\n                                   11\n\feducational policies.”     Id. at 743.   Accordingly, we have\n\ninterpreted the directives of Fordice “as recognizing the need to\n\nconsider the practicability and soundness of educational\n\npractices in determining remedies as well as in making an initial\n\ndetermination of liability.”     Louisiana, 9 F.3d at 1164.\n\n     We apply the directives of Fordice in conjunction with\n\ngeneral standards of appellate review.     This appeal challenges\n\nelements of the district court’s remedial decree and implicates\n\nseveral of its findings and conclusions.      We do not disturb the\n\ndistrict court’s findings of fact unless they are clearly\n\nerroneous, although we freely reassess its conclusions of law\n\nunder the de novo standard of review.      Ross v. Houston Indep.\n\nSch. Dist., 699 F.2d 218, 226 (5th Cir. 1983).     A third standard\n\napplies to our review of the remedial decree itself.     A\n\ndesegregation remedy is an exercise of a trial court’s equitable\n\npower and as such is reviewable, within the context of Fordice,\n\nfor abuse of discretion.     Cf. Valley v. Rapides Parish Sch. Bd.,\n\n702 F.2d 1221, 1225 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 914\n\n(1983).\n\n\n\n                            III. DISCUSSION\n\nA.   Admissions Policies and Practices\n\n     1.   Background Facts\n\n     In 1961, less than one week after James Meredith applied to\n\nthe University of Mississippi, the Board adopted a policy\n\nrequiring all applicants for undergraduate admission to any state\n\n\n                                  12\n\finstitution of higher education to take the American College Test\n\n(“ACT”).   Ayers I, 674 F. Supp. at 1530-31.    Several months\n\nlater, the Board authorized each university to set a minimum ACT\n\nscore for eligibility for admission.   Id. at 1531.     By 1963, the\n\nUniversity of Mississippi, Mississippi State University, and the\n\nUniversity of Southern Mississippi required an ACT composite\n\nscore of at least 15 for all freshmen applicants.      Id.   At the\n\ntime, the average ACT score among white students was 18, while\n\nthat for black students was 7.   Fordice, 505 U.S. at 734.\n\n     When this case was tried initially in 1987, admissions\n\nstandards for first-time freshman varied along with the\n\nhistorical racial identifiability of each institution.       Four HWIs\n\ncontinued to require a composite score of at least 15 on the ACT\n\nfor automatic admission; the other HWI, Mississippi University\n\nfor Women, required a score of 15-17 together with a high school\n\ngrade point average of at least 3.0 on a 4.0 scale, or a score of\n\nat least 18.   Ayers I, 674 F. Supp. at 1533-34.     The HBIs\n\nrequired a minimum ACT composite score of 13.      Id. at 1534.11\n\n     Based on the undisturbed factual findings of the district\n\ncourt -- and unmoved by lower court determinations that the\n\nadmissions standards derived from policies enacted in the 1970s\n\nto redress the problem of student unpreparedness -- the Supreme\n\nCourt concluded in Fordice that the policies were traceable to\n\n     11\n        The HBIs maintained more liberal exceptions policies\nthan the HWIs, although no university could enroll a student with\nan ACT score below 9. See Ayers I, 674 F. Supp. at 1533-34.\n\n                                 13\n\fthe de jure system, were originally adopted for a discriminatory\n\npurpose, and continued to have discriminatory effects.        505 U.S.\n\nat 734.   The Court found that the minimum ACT requirements\n\n“restrict[ed] the range of choices of entering students as to\n\nwhich institution they may attend in a way that perpetuate[d]\n\nsegregation.”   Id.   Those students who received ACT scores too\n\nlow to meet the admissions requirements at the HWIs were\n\nrestricted to the HBIs or community colleges if they wanted a\n\nhigher education.     Id. at 734-35.   As the Court stated,\n\n“[p]roportionately more blacks than whites face[d] this choice:\n\nIn 1985, 72 percent of Mississippi’s white high school seniors\n\nachieved an ACT composite score of 15 or better, while less than\n\n30 percent of black high school seniors earned that score.”        Id.\n\nat 735.   The Court also deemed “constitutionally problematic” the\n\nfact that the State denied automatic admission if an applicant\n\ndid not achieve the minimum ACT score specified for a particular\n\ninstitution, without also considering high school grades as an\n\nadditional factor in predicting college performance.      Id. at\n\n736.12\n\n     Plaintiffs’ challenges on remand included the use of\n\ndifferential ACT-based admissions policies at the HWIs and HBIs,\n\nas well as the use of ACT cutoff scores and alumni connection in\n\n\n     12\n        The Court found significant the fact that the disparity\nbetween black and white students’ grade averages was much\nnarrower than the gap between their average ACT scores,\nsuggesting that an admissions formula that included grades would\nincrease the number of black students eligible for automatic\nuniversity admission. Fordice, 505 U.S. at 736-37.\n\n                                  14\n\fthe award of undergraduate scholarships at the HWIs.13     The\n\ndistrict court’s ruling on each of these issues is now before us\n\non appeal.\n\n     2.    Undergraduate Admissions Standards\n\n           a.   District court ruling\n\n     The district court concluded that “[u]ndergraduate\n\nadmissions policies and practices are vestiges of de jure\n\nsegregation that continue to have segregative effects.”     Ayers\n\nII, 879 F. Supp. at 1477.   More specifically, the court found\n\nthat the admissions standards in place at the time of the 1987\n\ntrial were traceable to the prior de jure system and continued to\n\nhave segregative effects in a system where racially identifiable\n\ninstitutions offer numerous duplicative academic programs.       Id.\n\nat 1434.   The court held that defendants had a duty to eradicate\n\nuse of the ACT cutoff score “as a sole criterion for admission to\n\nthe system when the ACT is used in conjunction with differing\n\nadmissions standards between the HBIs and HWIs.”   Id.14\n\n     13\n        Plaintiffs also challenged policies and practices\npertaining to admissions exceptions. The district court’s\nfinding that no such policies or practices are traceable to the\nde jure system is not contested on appeal.\n     14\n        The court did not rule that use of an ACT cutoff is per\nse unlawful. “Rather, its particular use in any circumstance\nmust be examined to consider whether as a component of the policy\nchallenged, the same is traceable to prior de jure segregation.”\nAyers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1434.\n\n     Significantly, despite plaintiffs’ claims that the addition\nof ACT scores to high school grades as a predictor of freshman\ngrades improves the prediction only marginally, the district\ncourt concluded that the ACT was “a sound component of the\nadmissions decision for the reason that the ACT, in combination\nwith high school grades, remains a better predictor of academic\n\n                                15\n\f     Although admissions standards had been modified somewhat by\n\nthe time of the trial on remand, the district court found that\n\nthey “basically utilized a version of the 1987 standards with\n\nvarious exceptions.”   Id. at 1431.   In 1989, the ACT was replaced\n\nby the Enhanced ACT.   Id. at 1430.   Scores on the two tests are\n\nnot equivalent; the American College Testing Program accordingly\n\npublishes concordance tables that correlate scores on the old ACT\n\nand Enhanced ACT according to percentile rank.15     The\n\nintroduction of the Enhanced ACT prompted the Board to solicit\n\nrecommendations from the eight universities for revised\n\nadmissions standards based on the new test.    Each HWI recommended\n\nuse of an Enhanced ACT score of 18 for regular admission, which\n\napproximated the previous standard of an ACT score of 15.     Each\n\nHBI recommended use of an Enhanced ACT score of 15 for regular\n\nadmission, the concordant value of which was 11 on the old ACT.\n\nBecause the HBIs had previously required an ACT score of at least\n\n13 for regular admission, this recommendation represented an\n\neffective lowering of admissions standards at these\n\ninstitutions.16   Throughout the system, students not qualifying\n\n\nperformance than either criterion alone.”     Id. at 1482.   This\nconclusion is supported by the record.\n     15\n        An ACT score of 15, for instance, has a concordant value\nof 18 on the Enhanced ACT, meaning that a score of 15 on the ACT\nwould be in the same percentile ranking as a score of 18 on the\nEnhanced ACT.\n     16\n        Private plaintiffs quarrel with the district court’s\ncharacterization of the change in the admissions standard at the\nHBIs as a “lowering,” arguing that, viewed in historical context,\nthis change merely restored some of the access that had been\nforeclosed by an earlier increase in minimum ACT requirements.\n\n                                 16\n\ffor regular admission could be admitted as “high risk”\n\nexceptions.    The recommended Enhanced ACT scores for high risk\n\napplicants ranged from 14 to 17 at the HWIs, and from 12 to 14 at\n\nthe HBIs.    The Board approved all recommendations.17\n\nDifferential admissions standards thus persisted in the system\n\nthrough the 1994 trial and, as found by the district court,\n\n“resulted in the ‘channeling effect’ described in Fordice.”    Id.\n\nat 1434.    The district court’s remedial order responded to the\n\nstandards in place in 1994.18\n\n     Defendants proposed, and the district court ordered\n\nimplementation of, new admissions criteria that standardize\n\nrequirements at all eight universities beginning with\n\napplications for admission in the fall of 1996.    The new criteria\n\n\nWe review the district court’s ruling against this backdrop and\nin light of evidence concerning educational soundness.\n     17\n        The district court noted that although the lower ACT\nrequirements at the HBIs were originally proposed by the HBI\npresidents, “it is the Board’s responsibility to manage the\nhigher education system in accordance with constitutional\nprinciples.” Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1434.\n     18\n        While it found that admissions policies continued to\nhave segregative effects, the district court also found that\n“there is no per se policy or practice of minimizing the\nparticipation of African-Americans in the [higher education]\nsystem.” Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1435. The court found\ncredible evidence indicating that defendants had made substantial\nprogress toward increasing minority access to higher education.\nSee id. at 1433, 1435. In Mississippi, the ratio of the State’s\nshare of the nation’s black enrollment in public four-year\ninstitutions to its share of the nation’s black population is\nmore favorable than the national mean and that of many non de\njure states. See id. at 1435. Private plaintiffs appear to\ncontend that the district court’s finding of no current per se\npolicy of limiting access to the higher education system is\nclearly erroneous. We conclude that any such contention is\nwithout merit.\n\n                                 17\n\fgrant “regular admission”19 to applicants who have (1) a GPA of\n\nat least 3.20 in a designated core curriculum, (2) a GPA of at\n\nleast 2.50 in the core curriculum or class rank in the top 50%\n\nand an Enhanced ACT score of at least 16, or (3) a GPA of at\n\nleast 2.0 in the core curriculum and an Enhanced ACT score of at\n\nleast 18.    Id. at 1477-78.\n\n     The admissions policy ordered by the district court provides\n\nan important alternative to regular admission through a spring\n\nscreening and summer remedial program for applicants who do not\n\nmeet the requirements for regular admission.   Students\n\nparticipating in the spring screening process will take the\n\nMississippi College Placement Examination (the “accuplacer”)\n\nduring the spring of their senior year in high school.    Based\n\nupon these scores, Enhanced ACT subtest scores, and counselor\n\ninterviews, students will either be admitted for the fall\n\nsemester or invited to participate in the summer remedial\n\nprogram.20   The summer program is designed to provide ten to\n\neleven weeks of remedial instruction in reading, writing, and\n\nmathematics, taught both in traditional classroom settings and\n\n\n     19\n        “Regular admission” is the term used throughout the\ndistrict court opinion, and will be used herein, to denote\nautomatic admission based on the criteria listed in the text, as\ndistinguished from admission via the spring screening and summer\nremedial program, discussed infra. See Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at\n1477-78 & n.297.\n     20\n         It appears, based on the language of the Board’s\nproposal and testimony during trial, that some applicants who\nparticipate in spring screening may not be admitted to the summer\nremedial program and will be advised to pursue other educational\noptions.\n\n                                 18\n\fthrough computer-assisted individual components.     Id. at 1478.\n\nIn addition, the program plan incorporates cultural and\n\nrecreational activities to “climatize” students to the college\n\ncampus.    Id.21   Those students who successfully complete the\n\nsummer program, by passing at minimum the remedial English and\n\nmathematics courses, will be admitted in the fall.\n\n     The district court found that “the new admissions standards\n\nthrough their uniformity will eliminate the prior segregative\n\neffects of the previous differential admissions standards between\n\nthe HBIs and HWIs, noted by the Supreme Court in Fordice.”        Id.\n\nat 1481.    The district court found that as compared with the\n\nstandards litigated in the 1987 trial, the new standards would\n\nresult in an overall increase in the number of black students\n\neligible for regular admission to the university system.22        As\n\n     21\n        Although the district court made no specific findings in\nthis regard, the undisputed evidence indicates that the summer\nremedial program is a departure from past remedial practices\nwithin the university system. Prior to the district court’s\norder, full semester remedial courses were offered at each\nuniversity. Although students who are granted admission via the\nsummer program must participate in a year-long academic support\nprogram designed to provide individualized support for marginally\nprepared students enrolled in regular academic credit courses,\napparently many of the remedial courses previously offered during\nthe academic year are to be eliminated under the new plan. See\nPart III.B.2.c.iii infra.\n     22\n           The new standards were predicted to have the following\nimpact:\n\n     (a) the pool of black students eligible for regular\n     admission to a public HWI will increase from\n     approximately 32.4% to 52.5%; (b) the pool of black\n     students eligible for regular admission at the HBIs in\n     1995 will be increased from approximately 45.3% to\n     52.5%; (c) the pool of black students eligible for\n     admission to the system as a whole will also increase\n\n                                   19\n\fcompared with the standards in place at the time of the 1994\n\ntrial, which were less stringent than in 1987 as a result of the\n\n1989 changes in requirements at the HBIs, the new standards would\n\nresult in an overall decline in the percentage of black students\n\neligible for regular admission to the system.23    The district\n\ncourt noted, however, that the summer program offers a distinct\n\nopportunity for applicants to gain admission.     Id. at 1479.24\n\nThe court found the summer program to be “credible and\n\neducationally advanced.   In its proposed form, it is considered\n\nby its developers as an educationally sound developmental\n\nsystem.”   Id. at 1481.   The district court concluded that\n\n           [w]hile the new admissions standards may reduce\n      the number of black students eligible to be admitted to\n      the system without remedial courses required, it is not\n      evident that the new standards will actually reduce the\n      number of black students ultimately admitted to the\n      system as either regular or remediated admittees.\n\nId.\n\n      Finally, although the State’s community college system is\n\n\n\n      under the proposed 1995 standards as compared with the\n      1987 standards.\n\nAyers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1479.\n      23\n        While 68.2% of black high school graduates who took the\nACT were eligible for regular admission to some university in the\nsystem at the time of the 1994 trial, the new standards were\nprojected to reduce this figure to 52.5% or 50.7%. Ayers II, 879\nF. Supp. at 1479.\n      24\n        The district court stated this finding in terms of the\n“summer program” only. We note that, as described by the\ndistrict court and in the record, the spring screening program\ncan lead to admission for the fall semester without participation\nin the summer remedial program. See Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at\n1478.\n\n                                  20\n\fthe subject of a separate lawsuit, the district court made\n\nfindings and ordered relief in this regard because the community\n\ncollege system is relevant to the issue of access to higher\n\neducation.     The court found evidence that the community college\n\nsystem “can have an impact on the admissions policies of the\n\nuniversities and their ability to further diversify institutions\n\nof higher learning.”      Id. at 1475.   The court also found,\n\nhowever, that the community college system in Mississippi is not\n\nproviding remediation for students unprepared for four-year\n\ninstitutions “to any great degree.”       Id.    The district court\n\napparently linked this to at least two factors.         First, in\n\ncontrast to the open admissions policy that prevailed at all\n\ncommunity colleges when this case was tried in 1987, some\n\ncommunity colleges now require minimum ACT scores for admission\n\nto certain programs.      Id. at 1474-75.25     Second, the\n\n“overwhelming majority” of students who start at the community\n\ncollege level do not transfer to four-year universities.            Id. at\n\n1475.     The University of Southern Mississippi has the highest\n\nproportion of transfer students in its student body, largely\n\nattributable to its recruiting efforts and articulation\n\nagreements with several community colleges in surrounding\n\nregions.     Id.   Black students transfer at a significantly lower\n\n\n     25\n         The use of ACT cutoffs for admission to community\ncolleges is not an issue in this case, and the district court did\nnot make findings or conclusions with respect to the\nconstitutionality of this practice. Accordingly, we do not\naddress this aspect of the community college system in our\nopinion.\n\n                                   21\n\frate than whites, possibly because a high percentage of black\n\nstudents in community colleges are enrolled in two-year\n\nvocational programs.\n\n     The district court concluded that the State “is losing a\n\nvaluable resource in not coordinating the admissions requirements\n\nand remedial programs between the community colleges and the\n\nuniversities.”     Id.   The remedial decree contains a provision\n\nordering the Board “to study the feasibility of establishing\n\nsystem-wide coordination of the community colleges in the State\n\nin the areas of admissions standards and articulation\n\nprocedures,” and to report its findings to the Monitoring\n\nCommittee.     Id. at 1496.\n\n          b.      Arguments on appeal\n\n     The district court’s finding that undergraduate admissions\n\npolicies and practices are vestiges of de jure segregation that\n\ncontinue to have segregative effects is not contested on appeal.\n\nPlaintiffs do contest the remedy thereupon ordered.\n\n     Plaintiffs’ challenge to the admissions remedy has two\n\nparts.   First, plaintiffs argue that the district court’s\n\nadoption of the Board’s proposed standards was improper because\n\nthese standards will significantly reduce the number of black\n\nstudents eligible for regular admission to the university system,\n\nand thereby disproportionately burden black students with a loss\n\nof educational opportunity.     Plaintiffs assert that the district\n\ncourt was obligated by Fordice to consider the educational\n\nsoundness of alternative proposals that would have excluded fewer\n\n\n                                   22\n\fblack students, but failed to do so.\n\n     Second, plaintiffs argue that the district court’s reliance\n\non the spring screening and summer remedial program to compensate\n\nfor the projected decline in regular admission of black students\n\nwas inappropriate because the program was untested and\n\nincompletely defined at the time of trial.   Plaintiffs contend\n\nthat although the district court found the summer program to be\n\n“credible and educationally advanced,” it did not specifically\n\nfind that the program would be an effective means of identifying\n\nstudents capable of succeeding in college or that it could\n\nachieve the same results as “existing remedial programs.”26    In\n\naddition, plaintiffs argue that the summer program is not a\n\nviable option for the many black students who must work during\n\nthe summer in order to afford to go to college in the fall, and\n\nthat the community college system currently does not provide an\n\nadequate alternative.   Plaintiffs therefore argue that the Board\n\nshould be required to maintain existing remedial courses and to\n\nadopt standards that minimize any reduction in the number of\n\nblack students eligible for admission, at least during the period\n\nthat the summer program is being tested and the community college\n\n\n     26\n        We understand “existing remedial programs” to mean the\nvarious combinations of remedial, or basic skills, courses and\nother forms of educational assistance, such as tutoring and\ncounseling, that have been offered by the eight universities. In\nthis record, “remedial education” and “remediation” are to some\ndegree used interchangeably with “developmental education” and\n“developmental studies.” We use the term “remedial programs” to\nrefer to the entire range of such educational assistance, and the\nterm “remedial courses” to refer to courses that teach basic,\npre-college skills.\n\n                                23\n\fsystem undergoing change.\n\n     Although their criticisms of the new admissions standards\n\ncoincide, private plaintiffs and the United States advocate\n\ndifferent admissions policies as alternatives.   Private\n\nplaintiffs proposed below and re-urge here adoption of a tiered\n\nadmissions policy, in which admissions requirements vary along\n\nwith the mission of each university,27 with the most accessible\n\ntier having “open admissions.”   By “open admissions,” private\n\nplaintiffs mean a policy of granting admission to students with a\n\nhigh school diploma and ACT score of 10.    Id. at 1480.    Under\n\nprivate plaintiffs’ proposal, the three comprehensive\n\nuniversities would use the admissions standards proposed by the\n\nBoard, and Jackson State University would have open admissions\n\nfor eight years with the option thereafter of gradually raising\n\nadmissions standards to the level prevailing at the comprehensive\n\nuniversities.   Id.   Existing remedial programs would be\n\nstrengthened in this scheme.\n\n     The United States proposed below and re-urges here an\n\nadmissions policy, which was presented to the Board in 1992 but\n\n\n     27\n        The eight universities are grouped into three classes\naccording to their programmatic mission. University of\nMississippi, University of Southern Mississippi, and Mississippi\nState University are “comprehensive” universities, which offer\nthe greatest range and highest level of degree programs. Jackson\nState University has an “urban” mission to serve the urban\ncommunity of Jackson, Mississippi, in which it is located.\nAlcorn State University, Delta State University, Mississippi\nUniversity for Women, and Mississippi Valley State University are\n“regional” universities that focus primarily on undergraduate\neducation. In private plaintiffs’ framework, the regional\nuniversities would constitute the most accessible tier.\n\n                                 24\n\fnever adopted, in which regular admission would be granted to\n\nstudents achieving (1) a 2.0 GPA in the core curriculum and a\n\nminimum of 16 on the Enhanced ACT or (2) a 2.50 GPA in the core,\n\na ranking in the top 50% of the class, and a minimum of 13 on the\n\nEnhanced ACT.28   The United States contends that under this\n\nstandard, an estimated 73.6% of black students who took the ACT\n\nwould qualify for admission, as compared to 52.5% or 50.7% under\n\nthe proposal adopted by the district court.   The United States\n\nstates that “ACT predictive data indicate that, at the [HBIs],\n\nwhere remedial instruction was given, freshmen with these\n\nqualifications could be expected to achieve at least a C\n\naverage.”    U.S. Br. at 12.\n\n     Defendants argue that the new admissions criteria wholly\n\neliminate prior policies traceable to de jure segregation.\n\nDefendants contend that the new admissions standards sufficiently\n\naddress the concerns articulated in Fordice because they do not\n\ndifferentiate between universities according to historical racial\n\ndesignation and do not rely on the ACT as the sole criterion for\n\nadmission.    Defendants argue that under Fordice, the traceable\n\nadmissions policy was the Board’s particular use of differential\n\nACT cutoff scores, which effectively channeled black students to\n\nthe HBIs, and not use of the ACT per se.   Accordingly, defendants\n\ncontend that the new policy is not traceable to the prior de jure\n\n\n     28\n        The district court noted that the United States “has\nalso suggested adoption of a 2.5 overall GPA for admission to all\nuniversities.” Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1480. The United\nStates does not urge this standard on appeal.\n\n                                 25\n\fsystem and may be implemented because the record discloses that\n\nit is educationally sound and was not adopted for a\n\ndiscriminatory purpose.     While defendants maintain that Fordice\n\ndoes not require the district court to select the educationally\n\nsound alternative with the least discriminatory effect, they\n\nargue that even if the district court did have such an\n\nobligation, its findings regarding the segregative effect and\n\neducational soundness of the new admissions standards effectively\n\ndischarged it.\n\n            c.   Analysis\n\n     The district court’s findings that the new criteria for\n\nadmission are educationally sound and will not perpetuate\n\nsegregation within the system are not challenged on appeal.\n\nPlaintiffs contend, rather, that the district court erred by\n\nfailing to consider the educational soundness of proposals that\n\nwould have resulted in a smaller reduction in the number of black\n\nstudents excluded from regular admission.\n\n     We agree with plaintiffs that it would be inappropriate to\n\nremedy the traceable, segregative effects of an admissions policy\n\nin a system originally designed to limit educational opportunity\n\nfor black citizens by adopting a policy that itself caused a\n\nreduction in meaningful educational opportunity for black\n\ncitizens.    We do not, however, understand the district court to\n\nhave done so.    The district court considered and rejected\n\nalternative proposals as educationally unsound, and expressly\n\ncontemplated that the remedial route to admission could alleviate\n\n\n                                  26\n\fany potential disproportionate impact on those black students who\n\nare capable, with reasonable remediation,29 of doing college\n\nlevel work.\n\n     We understand the district court to have determined, in the\n\nspecific context of formulating an appropriate remedial decree in\n\nthis case under Fordice, that access to higher education must be\n\nprovided only to those applicants who can demonstrate, based on\n\neducationally sound and constitutionally permissible indicators,\n\nan ability (with reasonable remediation) to do college level work\n\nand who therefore have a real prospect of earning a degree.30\n\nThe court found that admission of students unprepared to do\n\ncollege level work may result in significant attrition\n\naccompanied by unprofitable debt accumulation.   Ayers II, 879 F.\n\nSupp. at 1435.31   Fordice does not require that all students who\n\n     29\n        The record reflects that each of the universities at\nissue here has for many years recognized that remediation is\nappropriate to enable certain students successfully to complete a\ncollege education. The amount of remediation that has been\nprovided has varied among the universities. We recognize that\nhow much remediation is appropriate or “reasonable” is informed\nby concepts of practicability and educational soundness.\n     30\n        All Mississippi universities at issue here require\nstudents to achieve at least a C average in order to graduate.\nIndeed, as indicated in our discussion below, all parties key\ntheir arguments regarding the educational soundness of\nalternative admissions proposals to this standard.\n     31\n        The court found that Louisiana institutions, which\nmaintain open admissions, “suffer from a very high attrition rate\nresulting in students owing one, two or three years of college\nexpenses and having little or nothing to show for it.” Ayers II,\n879 F. Supp. at 1435. Defendants’ expert, Dr. James Wharton,\ntestified that access to four-year institutions in Louisiana is\n“not meaningful access because we also have tremendous attrition\nand students get hurt in that attrition.” Likewise, Dr. Hunter\nBoylan testified that “[a]ccess without an opportunity to succeed\n\n                                 27\n\fwould have been admitted under the prior, unconstitutional\n\nadmissions standards be admitted under the reformed admissions\n\nstandards without regard to the educational soundness of the\n\nreformed standards.    Instead, the district court’s mandate under\n\nFordice was limited to reforming traceable, segregative policies\n\n“to the extent practicable and consistent with sound educational\n\npractices.”   505 U.S. at 729.32   Having found admissions policies\n\nand practices to be traceable to the de jure system and to have\n\npresent segregative effects, the district court properly focused\n\nits consideration of alternative admissions policies on their\n\neducational soundness and potential to eliminate existing\n\nsegregative effects; its focus, in turn, on ability to do college\n\nlevel work is consistent with both the evidence as presented by\n\nplaintiffs and Fordice.\n\n                i.     Rejection of plaintiffs’ proposals\n\n\nisn’t really access.    If you have an open door it quickly becomes\na revolving door.”\n     32\n        The Court in Fordice declined to adopt a standard that\nwould require the State to eliminate insofar as practicable all\npresent discriminatory effects of the prior system:\n\n     To the extent we understand private petitioners to urge\n     us to focus on present discriminatory effects without\n     addressing whether such consequences flow from policies\n     rooted in the prior system, we reject this position.\n     . . . Though they seem to disavow as radical a remedy\n     as student reassignment in the university setting,\n     their focus on “student enrollment, faculty and staff\n     employment patterns, [and] black citizens’ college-\n     going and degree-granting rates” would seemingly compel\n     remedies akin to those upheld in Green v. School Bd. of\n     New Kent County were we to adopt their legal standard.\n\n505 U.S. at 730 n.4 (citations omitted) (second alteration in\noriginal); see also id. at 732 n.6.\n\n                                   28\n\f     The district court set forth in detail the respective\n\nadmissions standards proposed by private plaintiffs and the\n\nUnited States.    See Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1479-80.    Although\n\nthe district court credited expert testimony indicating that\n\ndifferential or tiered admissions standards are both sound and\n\nroutinely used, id. at 1482, it did not adopt private plaintiffs’\n\nproposal in light of its finding that the open admissions\n\ncomponent of this proposal was educationally unsound.      Id. at\n\n1481-82.   The district court found that\n\n     universities across the nation generally are moving\n     toward higher admissions requirements, not lower ones.\n     According to the testimony, students in working toward\n     goals will usually do that which is expected of them.\n     If they believe they need not prepare themselves for\n     college by taking the core curriculum in high school,\n     they will not do so. Such unpreparedness may bring\n     them to college campuses unable to execute the rigors\n     of college work and result in low retention rates,\n     college debt accumulations and years expended with no\n     degrees. . . . It has also been shown that institutions\n     of higher learning which open their doors to unprepared\n     students via open admissions not only do a disservice\n     to many of the admittees, but can lower the quality\n     and, concurrently, the prestige of the institutions\n     generally.\n\nId. at 1482-83.   These findings are not clearly erroneous, and\n\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting\n\nprivate plaintiffs’ proposal.\n\n     Even assuming that tiered admissions could be implemented\n\nwithout open admissions as a component thereof, it was not an\n\nabuse of discretion in this context for the district court to opt\n\ninstead for a policy based on uniform standards.   In the\n\nMississippi system of higher education, differential admissions\n\ncriteria were rooted in the de jure past and fostered both\n\n                                 29\n\fsegregation of the races and the public perception that the\n\ninstitutions with lower standards -- the HBIs -- were of inferior\n\nquality.    Id. at 1477, 1486.   A tiered system would continue to\n\ndifferentiate among institutions based on their respective\n\nmissions.   See id. at 1482.     In light of the history of\n\ndifferential admissions in Mississippi higher education, and in\n\nlight of its finding that policies and practices governing the\n\nmissions of the universities are traceable to de jure segregation\n\nand continue to have segregative effects, the district court was\n\nwithin its discretion to unify standards across institutions.\n\n     The standards proposed by the United States met this\n\ninterest in uniformity, but were fixed at a level that the\n\ndistrict court found to be educationally unsound.     Under the\n\nUnited States’s proposal, students with a 2.5 GPA and a class\n\nrank in the top 50% would qualify for regular admission with an\n\nEnhanced ACT score of 13.   While this formula adds high school\n\ngrades and class rank into the eligibility determination, it\n\nnevertheless represents a lowering of the ACT score requirement\n\nfrom even post-1989 levels at the HBIs.     In contrast, students\n\nwith identical qualifications would need an Enhanced ACT score of\n\n16 to qualify for regular admission under the Board’s proposal.\n\nThe district court concluded that the requirements for regular\n\nadmission under the Board’s proposal were “quite moderate,” and\n\nstated that it “does not find persuasive or educationally sound\n\nthe adoption of open admissions or continually lowering\n\nadmissions standards, as was done at the HBIs after the 1987\n\n\n                                   30\n\ftrial.”     Id.    We understand this finding to encompass the\n\nstandards endorsed by the United States.\n\n     Both plaintiffs and defendants cite ACT predictive data in\n\nsupport of their respective proposals.      The United States points\n\nout that such data indicates that students with the minimum\n\nqualifications they propose would be expected to achieve at least\n\na C average by the end of their freshman year at each of the\n\nHBIs.     We note that such students are predicted to complete their\n\nfreshman year with grades significantly below a C average, the\n\nminimum required for graduation, at any of the HWIs.       See\n\nPP 39-R.     Defendants highlight a different aspect of the same\n\npredictive data, which the district court apparently found\n\npersuasive:       students with the minimum qualifications proposed by\n\nthe Board would be expected to complete their freshman year with\n\na C average or slightly below at each of the HWIs.      The district\n\ncourt’s finding that the Board’s proposed standards are “quite\n\nmoderate” is indeed supported by the evidence.      On this record,\n\nthe district court could fairly conclude that it would be\n\neducationally unsound to adopt an admissions policy under which\n\nstudents could do college level work at only three institutions\n\nin the system.33      We realize that no set of standards is without\n\nits flaws.     Significantly, as we discuss below, the standards\n\nthat the district court did adopt provide an alternative route to\n\n     33\n        Under the United States’s proposal, the three\ninstitutions at which students could do college level work are\nthe HBIs. The standards proposed by the United States therefore\ncould have the perverse, albeit unintended, effect of\nperpetuating the channeling effect described in Fordice.\n\n                                    31\n\fadmission that does not rely on ACT scores whatsoever.   The\n\ndistrict court’s decision to order implementation of this system,\n\nrather than dilute standards for regular admission, was a proper\n\nexercise of its discretion.\n\n                ii.   Reliance on spring screening and summer\n                      remedial program\n\n     The district court recognized the likelihood that the\n\nBoard’s standards would reduce the number of black students\n\neligible for regular admission as compared to then-prevailing\n\nstandards,34 and chose to adopt them only in conjunction with the\n\nadditional opportunity to gain admission through the spring\n\nscreening and summer remedial program.   The district court was\n\nunable to conclude that the new standards, which provide an\n\nalternative route to admission that does not rely on ACT scores\n\nwhatsoever,35 would actually reduce the total number of black\n\nstudents eligible for admission either as regular or remediated\n\nadmittees.   In light of the district court finding that lowering\n\nadmissions standards “as was done at the HBIs after the 1987\n\ntrial” is educationally unsound, the court apparently determined\n\nthat to the extent any reduction in the number of black students\n\neligible for admission relative to post-1989 standards does take\n\n     34\n        On the other hand, the district court found that under\nthe Board’s standards, the number of black students eligible for\nregular admission would increase relative to standards in\nexistence at the time of trial in 1987. See Ayers II, 879 F.\nSupp. at 1479.\n     35\n        According to the Board, any high school graduate,\nregardless of academic performance, may participate in spring\nscreening. There is no requirement that participants in spring\nscreening take the ACT. Bd. R-202.\n\n                                 32\n\fplace, it may reflect the educational unsoundness of prior\n\npolicies.     As contemplated, the new standards should result in\n\nthe identification and admission of those applicants who, with\n\nreasonable remediation, can do college level work.     This is\n\nconsistent with Fordice’s mandate of a reformed admissions policy\n\nthat is practicable and educationally sound.\n\n     The district court also recognized that the spring screening\n\nand summer remedial program was untested and its standards not\n\nfully established at the time of trial.     See id. at 1478-79,\n\n1481.     We think that the program was sufficiently defined that\n\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in ordering its\n\nimplementation.     If, however, as plaintiffs suggest may be the\n\ncase,36 the spring and summer program is unable to any\n\nsignificant degree to achieve its intended objectives of\n\nidentifying and admitting otherwise eligible applicants -- i.e.,\n\napplicants who could, with reasonable remediation, successfully\n\ncomplete a regular academic program -- for whatever reason, then\n\nthe program must be reevaluated.37     The district court’s proper\n\n     36\n        In its Motion to Expedite the Appeal, the United States\npresents recently discovered evidence concerning the first year’s\nimplementation of the new standards and the spring and summer\nprogram, which may demonstrate that the new standards exclude a\nsignificant percentage of black students who would have been\neligible for regular admission at the time of the 1994 trial, and\nthat the spring and summer program offers limited ameliorative\npotential. Such evidence, however, is not part of the record\nbefore us and we do not consider it in any substantive way for\npurposes of this appeal.\n     37\n        The district court’s conclusion that the Board’s\nobligation to graduating high school students does not encompass\n“students ineligible for regular admission under its proposal,\nwho do not choose to participate in a screening process for\n\n                                  33\n\fretention of jurisdiction over this action indicates its intent\n\nto examine this important component of the admissions system once\n\nthe relevant data becomes available.38   If the district court\n\nultimately concludes that the spring screening and summer\n\nremedial program (as it may be modified) is unable to any\n\nsignificant degree to achieve its objectives, then the court\n\nshould, if possible, identify and implement another practicable\n\nand educationally sound method for achieving those objectives.\n\n               iii. Elimination of existing remedial courses\n\n     We have thus far addressed the spring and summer program as\n\na component of the reformed admissions policy.   We turn now to\n\nthe argument made by the plaintiffs that the district court erred\n\nin relying upon the summer remedial program to replace the\n\nexisting remedial courses in the absence of a finding that the\n\nsummer program could achieve the same results as the\n\nuniversities’ existing remedial courses in enabling students to\n\nsucceed in and graduate from college.\n\n     We note in this connection that the plan proposed by the\n\nBoard provides that “[d]evelopmental studies are only offered\n\n\n\nacademic placement analysis,” Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1481, is\ntoo sweeping insofar as it may include students who, with\nreasonable remediation, are capable of doing college level work\nbut who self-select out of the spring or summer program because\nof the unique burdens imposed by the program or flaws in its\ndesign or operation.\n     38\n        Cf. Green v. County Sch. Bd., 391 U.S. 430, 439 (1968)\n(“Moreover, whatever plan is adopted will require evaluation in\npractice, and the court should retain jurisdiction until it is\nclear that state-imposed segregation has been completely\nremoved.”).\n\n                                34\n\fduring the summer session.”    In ordering implementation of this\n\nplan, the district court tacitly approved the elimination of\n\nmost, perhaps even all, of the remedial courses that had been\n\noffered by all the universities at issue here, most notably by\n\nthe HBIs.   This is a troubling decision, implicating the reformed\n\npolicies for regular admission as well as the spring screening\n\nand summer remedial program.   On the one hand, there was evidence\n\nto indicate that an intensive, structured program of remedial\n\ninstruction during the summer months prior to a student’s\n\nimmersion in the college experience may actually be more\n\neffective at preparing students for college than a more diffused\n\nprogram of remedial instruction throughout the academic year.    On\n\nthe other hand, the district court appeared to base its decision\n\nnot to consolidate Mississippi Valley State University with Delta\n\nState University, at least in part, on the significant percentage\n\nof students enrolled in remedial, or developmental, education at\n\nMississippi Valley and on Mississippi Valley’s role as “a\n\nsignificant nurturer of underprepared blacks,” id. at 1492, a\n\nrole that the district court apparently did not want to see\n\neliminated.39 Further, it is not clear to what extent the\n\noperative predictive data assumes the existence of remedial\n\nprograms insofar as it is based on historical achievement.    It is\n\nclear that the predictive data relied upon by the State in\n\n     39\n        We find it significant that the presidents of\nMississippi’s HBIs testified that the existing remedial programs\nat the HBIs are essential to meet the needs of the students they\nserve and at least one questioned whether the summer remedial\nprogram would adequately replace them.\n\n                                 35\n\fsupport of its argument that its proposed admissions standards\n\nwere “quite moderate” indicate that students who are admitted\n\nwith the minimum qualifications required under the new standards\n\nare not predicted to achieve a C average during their first year\n\nat at least three of the HWIs.    This suggests, as defendants note\n\nin their brief and indicated at oral argument before this court,\n\nthat many students who are admitted under the reformed standards\n\nwill need “substantial educational assistance,” possibly\n\nincluding remedial courses.40    Remedial courses may be an\n\nimportant part of the admissions policy at any school in which a\n\nsignificant number of students are not predicted to achieve a C\n\naverage during their first year.\n\n     Plaintiffs did not challenge the State’s existing\n\nremediation policies as traceable to the de jure era.     There was\n\ntherefore no requirement, under Fordice, for reformation of those\n\npolicies as such.   However, the Board’s proposed admissions\n\nstandards (Bd. R-202) treated the adoption of the summer program\n\nand the elimination of the existing remedial courses as\n\ncomponents of its admissions standards, and the district court,\n\nin ordering the implementation of the Board’s proposal,\n\neffectively did the same.   The principle that apparently\n\nunderlies the Board’s admissions policy (and, therefore, the\n\n     40\n        There may be a distinction between students who qualify\nfor regular admission but who are also in need of remedial\neducation and students who do not so qualify. The total\nimmersion aspect of the summer program may be important for the\nlatter group but unnecessarily burdensome for the former group.\nIn suggesting these considerations, we intimate no view as to\ntheir ultimate merit.\n\n                                  36\n\fdistrict court’s decision) is that, in the case of any applicant,\n\nwhat can and cannot be accomplished with reasonable remediation\n\nis a key element of the admissions decision.     Clearly, this\n\nprinciple is educationally sound.     But the court’s action in\n\neliminating the existing remedial courses can legitimately be\n\nchallenged by plaintiffs as an inappropriate feature of the\n\ncourt’s admissions remedy.    We have recognized that there are\n\nsome tensions in the district court’s findings in this regard.\n\nIn the light of these tensions and the absence of specific\n\nconsideration of the justification for, or reasonableness of,\n\neliminating these unchallenged courses, we are sufficiently\n\nconcerned about the district court’s exercise of its discretion\n\nin this regard to direct the court on remand to reconsider its\n\ndecision to eliminate these courses.     On remand, the district\n\ncourt should determine if remedial courses are needed to help\n\nensure that students admitted under the new admissions criteria\n\nhave a realistic chance of achieving academic success.41\n\n               iv.   Timing\n\n     The United States argues that it may take several years for\n\nthe summer program to be thoroughly implemented, tested, and\n\nevaluated and argues that during the interim, an admissions\n\npolicy that minimizes any reduction in the number of black\n\n\n\n\n     41\n        The decision whether to take more evidence on the\nadvisability of reinstating any or all of these courses, either\nas previously offered or as modified to operate in conjunction\nwith the summer remedial program, is left to the district court.\n\n                                 37\n\fstudents eligible for regular admission should be installed.42\n\nWe reject this argument.    The summer program has sufficient\n\npromise, on the present state of the record, to allow it “to\n\nprove itself in operation,” Green v. County Sch. Bd., 391 U.S.\n\n430, 440-41 (1968), should the district court decide to continue\n\non that path.     There is no reason why, however, reconsideration\n\nof the district court’s decision to eliminate the existing\n\nremedial courses cannot be done promptly.     We intimate no view on\n\nthe outcome of that reconsideration.\n\n             d.   Conclusions regarding undergraduate admissions\n                  standards\n\n     Except as set forth below, we affirm paragraph 2 of the\n\nremedial decree, which reads in relevant part as follows:     “The\n\n1995 admissions standards as proposed by the Board for first-time\n\nfreshmen, effective for the academic year [1996-97], shall be\n\nimplemented at all universities.”      Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at\n\n1494.     We do not affirm paragraph 2 insofar as it eliminates the\n\nremedial courses previously offered at each of the eight\n\nuniversities.     We remand this latter issue for reconsideration in\n\nthe light of this opinion.     We understand the district court’s\n\ncontinuing jurisdiction to encompass the evaluation of the\n\neffectiveness of the spring screening and summer remedial\n\n     42\n        The United States makes a similar argument with respect\nto the time that it will take to implement changes at the\ncommunity colleges. We think that the remedial decree adopted by\nthe district court adequately addresses the community colleges to\nthe extent they can be addressed in this case. The fact that\nimplementation of this aspect of the remedial decree will take\ntime does not require installation of an interim admissions\npolicy.\n\n                                  38\n\fprogram, as a component of the admissions system, in achieving\n\nits intended objectives of identifying and admitting those\n\nstudents who are capable, with reasonable remediation, of doing\n\ncollege level work but who fail to qualify for regular admission.\n\nShould the district court ultimately conclude that this program\n\n(as it may be modified) is unable to any significant degree to\n\nachieve its objectives, then the court will need to identify and\n\nimplement another method for achieving those objectives.\n\n     3.   Scholarship Policies\n\n          a.   District court ruling\n\n     While the district court found that undergraduate admissions\n\npolicies in general are vestiges of de jure segregation that\n\ncontinue to have segregative effects, it found that scholarship\n\npolicies in particular are not.    On remand, plaintiffs challenged\n\nthe use of ACT cutoff scores for the award of undergraduate\n\nacademic scholarships at the HWIs, as well as the use of ACT\n\ncutoff scores and alumni connection in the award of nonresident\n\nfee waivers for out-of-state admittees.43   Unlike most other\n\n\n     43\n        The nonresident fee waivers for children of nonresident\nalumni are referred to in the record also as “alumni\nscholarships.” Our use of the term “scholarships” encompasses\nacademic scholarships as well as nonresident fee waivers, but we\nuse the term “nonresident fee waiver” when referring solely to\nthis type of award.\n\n     We note that Mississippi University for Women offers certain\nscholarships to resident and nonresident children of MUW alumni\nthat require a minimum ACT score of 21 for eligibility. These\nscholarships are distinct from the nonresident fee waivers, but\nplaintiffs challenge the use of the ACT cutoff score and the\nalumni connection in determining eligibility for these\nscholarships as well.\n\n                                  39\n\fforms of financial aid, the scholarships challenged by plaintiffs\n\nare generally awarded on the basis of academic achievement, not\n\nfinancial need, and do not require repayment by the recipient.\n\nThe district court found a significant disparity in the\n\npercentage of nonresident fee waivers awarded by race in any\n\ngiven year.     Id. at 1433.   The evidence indicated similar\n\ndisparities in the award of academic scholarships.      The district\n\ncourt concluded, however, that\n\n          [t]he Board’s policy of allowing [nonresident fee\n     waivers] to be based on ACT cutoffs and the use of ACT\n     cutoff scores as the sole criterion for the receipt of\n     academic scholarship monies has not been proven to have\n     linkage with the de jure system, and there is no\n     evidence that these practices currently foster\n     separation of the races such as influencing student\n     choice. Therefore, reformation of these policies\n     cannot be ordered consistent with the law of the case,\n     absent evidence of discriminatory purpose of which the\n     court finds none. The use of ACT scores in awarding\n     scholarships is widespread throughout the United States\n     and generally viewed as educationally sound.\n\nId. at 1434-35 (footnote omitted).      The district court did not\n\nmake a specific finding with regard to the traceability of the\n\nalumni connection requirement for nonresident fee waivers.      The\n\nremedial decree does not order alteration of any of the\n\nchallenged scholarship policies.\n\n           b.     Arguments on appeal\n\n     Plaintiffs argue that the district court clearly erred in\n\nfinding that the use of ACT cutoffs in the award of academic\n\nscholarships and nonresident fee waivers at the HWIs is not\n\ntraceable to the dual system and does not have segregative\n\neffects.   Although the district court’s findings and conclusions\n\n\n                                   40\n\fwith respect to academic scholarships focus specifically on\n\npolicies that establish an ACT cutoff score as the sole criterion\n\nfor award, plaintiffs’ challenge encompasses all instances in\n\nwhich the HWIs require a minimum ACT score for scholarship\n\neligibility.44   Accordingly, plaintiffs have identified on appeal\n\nnumerous scholarships at various HWIs that are available only to\n\nstudents with certain minimum ACT scores.    Plaintiffs contend\n\nthat the use of ACT cutoff scores for scholarship eligibility is\n\ntraceable to the de jure system because under that system ACT\n\ncutoff scores were implemented for the purpose of excluding black\n\nstudents from the HWIs.    The segregative effects of this\n\npractice, plaintiffs argue, are evident in the racial disparity\n\nin scholarship awards.    Because black students receive only a\n\nvery small proportion of such scholarships, yet are more likely\n\nthan white students to be in need of financial aid, the policy\n\neffectively reduces the number of black students able to attend\n\nthe HWIs.   Moreover, plaintiffs argue that the record does not\n\n     44\n        In the Pretrial Order, private plaintiffs listed as a\nchallenged remnant “[t]he policy of using ACT cutoff scores in\nselecting persons to receive particular scholarships at the\nundergraduate level at each HWI.” The United States similarly\nidentified this alleged remnant as “[t]he practice of using the\nACT in selecting persons to receive scholarships at the\nundergraduate level.”\n\n     Significantly, plaintiffs do not challenge any of the\nscholarship policies at the HBIs and no party argues on appeal\nthat such policies either are traceable to the de jure system or\nhave present segregative effects. Accordingly, we express no\nopinion on the scholarship policies at the HBIs or their\nrelevance in reforming scholarship policies to eliminate present\nsegregative effects. In fashioning the most appropriate remedy,\nhowever, the district court may find it relevant to consider all\nscholarship policies.\n\n                                 41\n\fsupport the district court’s finding that the use of ACT cutoff\n\nscores in the award of scholarships is widespread.\n\n     Plaintiffs also contend that the district court erred in\n\nupholding the practice of limiting nonresident fee waivers to\n\nchildren of an institution’s alumni.       Plaintiffs maintain that\n\nthe alumni connection requirement is traceable to the de jure\n\nsystem in that parents of today’s students were systematically\n\nexcluded from the HWIs under the de jure system.\n\n          c.     Analysis\n\n     Although it is clear from the record that undergraduate\n\nscholarship policies were litigated on remand, the district court\n\nmade virtually no fact findings with regard to specific policy\n\ncriteria or operation.      The parties’ original briefing of this\n\nissue on appeal was also scant.45       In response to our request for\n\nsupplemental briefing, plaintiffs provided a summary of the\n\nchallenged policies along with the racial breakdown of their\n\ndistribution for the 1992-93 year (and in one instance, for the\n\n1991-92 year).   Defendants have not contested the accuracy of\n\nthis summary, which is drawn from defendants’ answers to\n\ninterrogatories and from other evidence introduced by defendants.\n\nWe therefore accept plaintiffs’ factual summary.       According to\n\nthat summary, the scholarships alleged to be traceable to de jure\n\nsegregation and to have present discriminatory effects are as\n\n\n     45\n        To ensure that we were apprised of all arguments and\nrelevant evidence on appeal, we requested, and the parties\nsupplied, supplemental briefing on the issue of undergraduate\nscholarships.\n\n                                   42\n\ffollows:\n\n\n\nDELTA STATE UNIVERSITY     First-time freshman enrollment 1992-93: 21% black\nScholarship      Minimum     Number of Recipients          Dollars Received\nName46           ACT\n                 Score       Black     White     Total     Black       White            Total\nDean’s and       26               2      160         162    $1,375        $131,175        $132,550\nPresidential\n                                      1% black                     1% black\n\n\nMISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY     First-time freshman enrollment 1992-93: 16% black\nScholarship      Minimum     Number of Recipients          Dollars Received\nName             ACT\n                 Score       Black     White     Total     Black       White            Total\nEntering         31               1      294         299    $2,000        $546,000        $555,000\nFreshman ACT\n8,000\nSharp Forestry   31               0        3           3           0            7,500           7,500\nEntering         29               5      454         468    16,250         596,836         626,836\nFreshman ACT\n5,000 and\nSchillig\nRamsey &         28               0       41          41           0       115,500         115,500\nElaine O’Neal\nand Hearin-\nHess\nEntering         28               5      248         267     7,944         239,444         261,388\nFreshmen ACT\n4,000, South\nCentral Bell,\nand Jesse &\nLillian Tims\nLeadership       20               8       71          80     3,600             34,450       38,550\nJohn C.          24               1        6           8     1,000              6,000           8,000\nStennis\nAlumni           21             N/A      N/A         N/A       N/A                N/A             N/A\nTOTAL                            20     1117        1166   $30,794      $1,545,730      $1,612,774\n                                      2% black                     2% black             MISSISSIPPI\n                                                                                        UNIVERSITY\n                                                                                        FOR WOMEN\n\n\n\n        46\n        Plaintiffs advise in their brief that in some instances\ndata for more than one scholarship with the same ACT cutoff score\nhas been grouped.

We agree with the\n\nprinciple articulated by the district court that use of an ACT\n\ncutoff is not unlawful in all circumstances.                         “Rather, its\n\nparticular use in any circumstance must be examined to consider\nwhether as a component of the policy challenged, the same is\n\ntraceable to prior de jure segregation.”                    Ayers II, 879 F. Supp.\n\nat 1434.      In light of the facts set out above, however, we\n\nconclude that the district court erred in arriving at its\n\nfindings regarding traceability and segregative effects.47\n\n        The district court may have applied an erroneous view of\n\n\n        47\n        Our conclusion in this regard applies to the use of ACT\ncutoffs in all challenged scholarships.\n\n                                            45\n\ftraceability.     As defendants point out in their supplemental\n\nletter brief, a traceable policy is one “rooted in” the prior\n\ndual system.     See Fordice, 505 U.S. at 730 n.4, 732 n.6, 743.     It\n\nis only “surviving aspects” of de jure segregation that a state\n\nneed remedy.     See id. at 733.   That is not to say, however, that\n\na challenged policy as it exists today must have been in effect\n\nduring the de jure period in order to be constitutionally\n\nproblematic.     The undergraduate admissions criteria that the\n\ndistrict court found to be traceable, for instance, had been\n\nmodified several times since the de jure era but nonetheless were\n\nfound to be rooted in the prior system.     Similarly, the Supreme\n\nCourt found Mississippi’s scheme of institutional mission\n\nclassifications to be traceable to de jure segregation even\n\nthough it was not put in place until several years after\n\ntermination of official segregation.      See id. at 732-33, 739-41.\n\nThe Court noted that “[t]he institutional mission designations\n\nadopted in 1981 have as their antecedents the policies enacted to\n\nperpetuate racial separation during the de jure segregated\n\nregime.”    Id. at 739.   In United States v. Louisiana, this court\n\nimplicitly recognized that Louisiana’s open admissions policy\n\ncould be traceable to that state’s prior de jure system despite\n\nits adoption only after de jure segregation had ended.      See 9\n\nF.3d at 1167.     Because the district court had not addressed the\n\npolicy’s traceability, we left the issue open for resolution on\n\nremand.    Id.\n\n     In this case, plaintiffs concede that the record does not\n\n\n                                   46\n\fcontain evidence directly linking the use of ACT cutoffs for\n\nscholarship purposes with any time prior to 1980.      Such evidence\n\napparently was not developed because plaintiffs concluded, in our\n\nview correctly, that the discriminatory use of ACT cutoffs to\n\nexclude black students from the HWIs during the de jure period\n\nestablishes traceability with respect to all current practices\n\nthat limit black student access to the HWIs by setting ACT cutoff\n\nscores at a level that disproportionately favors white students.\n\nDefendants contend that plaintiffs have failed to prove\n\ntraceability because they have not produced evidence establishing\n\nthat the practice of using ACT cutoffs in the award of\n\nscholarships was initiated either “(i) during de jure\n\nsegregation, (ii) as an integral component of de jure\n\nsegregation, (iii) to continue, perpetuate, or further\n\nsegregation, or (iv) because of some intentionally segregative\n\npolicy which formerly existed.”48      This argument misses the mark.\n\nFirst, to the extent defendants suggest it is lacking, evidence\n\nof discriminatory purpose is required to establish a\n\nconstitutional violation only for present policies that are not\n\ntraceable to the prior system; discriminatory purpose is not an\n\nelement of traceability itself.     Fordice, 505 U.S. at 733 n.8.\n\nSecond, this argument ignores the relationship between\n\nscholarship awards and grants of admission, an element missing\n\n     48\n        Upon motion of plaintiffs, the district court placed the\nburden of proving traceability on plaintiffs. No party appeals\nthe allocation of burdens of proof. For purposes of this appeal,\nwe assume without deciding that the district court did not err in\nthis respect.\n\n                                  47\n\ffrom the district court’s analysis as well.\n\n     Scholarship decisions are not wholly independent of\n\nadmissions in the way that most financial aid determinations are.\n\nIndeed, the record indicates that at University of Mississippi,\n\nDelta State University, and Mississippi University for Women, the\n\napplication for admission also constitutes the application for\n\nscholarships.   It is because scholarships are intended to reward\n\nexemplary academic achievement, as defendants point out, that\n\nscholarship decision criteria overlap more with those for\n\nadmission than for financial aid.     By their nature, scholarships\n\nare designed to attract outstanding students to the awarding\n\ninstitution; that scholarships need not be repaid is a powerful\n\nincentive for students to both pursue and accept them.    As a\n\ncomponent of admissions, scholarship policies further the process\n\nthat ultimately culminates in matriculation.    In finding that the\n\nuse of ACT cutoffs in the scholarship context is not traceable to\n\nthe de jure system, the district court may have distinguished\n\nscholarships too strictly from admissions, although its opinion,\n\nwhich addresses scholarships as a component of admissions,\n\nsuggests otherwise.   See Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1424, 1431-35.\n\n     As presented by plaintiffs, the challenged scholarships\n\nrequire students to achieve a certain minimum ACT score to be\n\neligible for the award.    Accordingly, a student who has not\n\nachieved the requisite ACT score will not be considered,\n\nregardless of how impressive his or her grades or other academic\n\nachievements might be.    This is “constitutionally problematic”\n\n\n                                 48\n\ffor the same reason the Supreme Court found the use of the ACT in\n\nadmissions to be so.    See Fordice, 505 U.S. at 736 (“Another\n\nconstitutionally problematic aspect of the State’s use of the ACT\n\ntest scores is its policy of denying automatic admission if an\n\napplicant fails to earn the minimum ACT score specified for the\n\nparticular institution, without also resorting to the applicant’s\n\nhigh school grades as an additional factor in predicting college\n\nperformance.”).   Just as there may be students who could do\n\ncollege level work yet might be precluded from enrolling in an\n\ninstitution that maintains ACT cutoffs in admissions, there may\n\nbe students who have outstanding academic achievement that merits\n\nrecognition apart from their ACT scores.\n\n     It bears emphasis that the use of ACT cutoffs in the award\n\nof scholarships raises constitutional suspicion only because of\n\nthe history of de jure segregation in Mississippi.     The practice\n\nof rewarding academic achievement as determined by standardized\n\ntest scores, even where it results in significant racial\n\ndisparities in receipt of awards, is not per se unconstitutional.\n\nUse of ACT cutoffs does not take place on a clean slate in\n\nMississippi, however.   The alleged practice of basing scholarship\n\neligibility on minimum ACT scores flows from earlier\n\ndiscriminatory use of ACT cutoffs and therefore triggers further\n\nconstitutional inquiry, under Fordice, into whether it continues\n\nto have segregative effects.\n\n     The use of ACT cutoff scores in the award of scholarships\n\nrestricts black students’ access to the HWIs in much the same way\n\n\n                                 49\n\fthat the use of ACT cutoff scores in a system of differential\n\nadmissions standards was found to restrict access.     The district\n\ncourt findings and other evidence indicate that scholarships with\n\nACT cutoff scores are disproportionately awarded to white\n\nstudents.   See Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1433.     In addition, the\n\ndistrict court found that black applicants to Mississippi’s\n\nuniversities are more likely to need financial aid than white\n\napplicants.     Id. at 1433-34 n.28.   To the extent that\n\nacademically accomplished black students are unable to achieve\n\nACT scores that would qualify them for scholarships at the HWIs,\n\nthey are discouraged from both applying to and matriculating at\n\nthese institutions.49    While the potential segregative effect of\n\nthe use of ACT cutoffs in determining scholarship eligibility is\n\nperhaps somewhat less pronounced than that of the use of ACT\n\ncutoffs in admissions, the evidence nevertheless indicates that\n\nsuch potential does exist.\n\n     The fact that some HWIs offer scholarships specifically for\n\nblack applicants does not, as the State argues, alter this\n\nconclusion.   The evidence suggests that such scholarships\n\nrepresent an extremely limited proportion of available\n\nscholarship monies, and in most instances fall significantly\n\nshort of the amount of aid offered through generally available\n\nscholarships.    The availability of a small number of minority\n\nscholarships at the HWIs does not automatically neutralize the\n\n     49\n        The district court found that black students continue to\nbe significantly underrepresented at most of the HWIs. Ayers II,\n879 F. Supp. at 1469.\n\n                                  50\n\fongoing discriminatory effects of current scholarship policies\n\nrooted in the de jure past.\n\n     There is evidence in the record to indicate that the use of\n\nACT cutoffs in the award of scholarships can be practicably\n\neliminated consistent with sound educational practices.    Of\n\ncourse, as we noted with respect to undergraduate admissions\n\npolicies, we do not hold that reliance on ACT scores for\n\nscholarship purposes must be eradicated entirely.   We leave to\n\nthe district court on remand factfinding with regard to the\n\npracticability of reforming current policies consistent with\n\nsound educational practices.\n\n     Plaintiffs also argue that the district court erred in\n\nfailing to find that basing eligibility for nonresident fee\n\nwaivers (and, in the case of Mississippi University for Women,\n\ncertain scholarships for children of resident and nonresident\n\nalumni) on relationship to alumni of Mississippi’s HWIs is\n\ntraceable to the de jure system and has present segregative\n\neffects.   We agree that this practice, which the district court\n\nfound to result in the disproportionate award of such\n\nscholarships to white students, has present segregative effects.\n\nWe are not persuaded, however, that traceability has been\n\nestablished on this record.50   Plaintiffs’ argument rests upon\n\nthe exclusion of blacks from the HWIs during the de jure period.\n\n\n     50\n        Our conclusion in this regard applies to the alumni\nconnection requirement in the challenged scholarships offered by\nMississippi University for Women as well as that in the\nnonresident fee waivers.\n\n                                 51\n\fThis fact, without more, does not establish the traceability of\n\nthe alumni element of the present nonresident fee waivers.    In\n\neffect, plaintiffs seek relief for “present discriminatory\n\neffects without addressing whether such consequences flow from\n\npolicies rooted in the prior system.”    Fordice, 505 U.S. at 730\n\nn.4.    The Supreme Court has rejected this position.   Id.\n\nPlaintiffs note in their briefs that this court struck down, as\n\nunlawfully discriminating against black applicants to Mississippi\n\nuniversities, a requirement established by the Board shortly\n\nafter the decision in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483\n\n(1954), that each applicant for admission furnish letters or\n\ncertificates from alumni attesting to the good moral character of\n\nthe applicant.    See Meredith v. Fair, 305 F.2d 343, 351 (5th\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 371 U.S. 828 (1962).    In our view (assuming\n\nthat plaintiffs intend this as an alternative basis for\n\ntraceability), on this record the alumni certificate requirement\n\nfor admission has no connection, historical or otherwise, with\n\nthe nonresident fee waivers presently awarded to the children of\n\nnonresident alumni except for the fact that both involve some\n\n“alumni connection.”    Any such argument urges us to a level of\n\ngenerality that is beyond the traceability contemplated by\n\nFordice.\n\n            d.   Conclusions regarding scholarship policies\n\n       We reverse the district court’s finding that the use of ACT\n\ncutoff scores as a criterion for the award of scholarships at the\n\nHWIs is not traceable to the de jure system and does not\n\n\n                                 52\n\fcurrently foster segregation.   We remand for determination of the\n\npracticability and educational soundness of reforming this aspect\n\nof the undergraduate scholarship policies at the HWIs and the\n\nimplementation, if necessary, of appropriate remedial relief.\n\n\n\nB.   Enhancement of Historically Black Institutions\n\n     1.   Background Facts\n\n     Plaintiffs contend that several policies related to funding\n\nand programs at the HBIs are remnants of the de jure system that\n\nmust be remedied by relief more expansive than that ordered by\n\nthe district court.   Plaintiffs’ arguments in this regard\n\nencompass four interrelated areas:   new academic programs, land\n\ngrant programs, program duplication, and funding.   According to\n\nplaintiffs, these aspects of higher education affect student\n\nchoice, and existing policies must be remedied in order to enable\n\nthe HBIs to attract students of all races.51\n\n     In addition, private plaintiffs appear to advocate\n\nenhancement of the HBIs in order to rectify the detrimental\n\neffects of past de jure segregation, without regard to present\n\npolicies and practices.   This position is at odds with standards\n\nestablished in Fordice.   The Supreme Court expressly rejected the\n\nproposition that the State’s duty to dismantle its prior de jure\n\nsystem requires elimination of all continuing discriminatory\n\n\n     51\n        The district court found that “[b]lacks are now\nattending the HWIs as a group in statistical parity with their\nrepresentation in the qualified pool.” Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at\n1486.\n\n                                53\n\feffects:   “To the extent we understand private petitioners to\n\nurge us to focus on present discriminatory effects without\n\naddressing whether such consequences flow from policies rooted in\n\nthe prior system, we reject this position.”     Fordice, 505 U.S. at\n\n730 n.4.   Likewise,\n\n          [i]f we understand private petitioners to press us\n     to order the upgrading of Jackson State, Alcorn State,\n     and Mississippi Valley State solely so that they may be\n     publicly financed, exclusively black enclaves by\n     private choice, we reject that request. The State\n     provides these facilities for all its citizens and it\n     has not met its burden under Brown to take affirmative\n     steps to dismantle its prior de jure system when it\n     perpetuates a separate, but ‘more equal’ one.\n\nId. at 743.\n\n     The appropriate inquiry under Fordice, then, is whether\n\nchanges in resource allocation are necessary to dismantle fully\n\npresent policies and practices rooted in the prior system that\n\nserve to maintain the racial identifiability of the universities\n\nand that can practicably be eliminated without eroding sound\n\neducational policies.   See id.    Current policies and practices\n\n(as distinguished from lingering disparities in institutional\n\ndevelopment per se) implicate the Fourteenth Amendment only\n\ninsofar as they are traceable to the prior system and continue to\n\nhave segregative effects, either by influencing student choice or\n\notherwise.\n\n     2.    New Academic Programs\n\n           a.   District court ruling\n\n     The programmatic expansions of Jackson State and Alcorn\n\nState ordered by the district court respond to its findings\n\n\n                                   54\n\fconcerning deliberate efforts by the State of Mississippi to\n\nrestrict the educational opportunities of its black citizens, as\n\nwell as the traceability of current mission assignments to these\n\nhistorical antecedents.     See Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1437-41,\n\n1477, 1483-86.   As the district court found, after establishment\n\nof Alcorn State in 1871 and continuing through roughly the first\n\nhalf of this century, the prevailing notion concerning the\n\neducation of blacks was that blacks could benefit only from\n\nagricultural or mechanical training, rather than a liberal\n\neducation as provided to whites.       Id. at 1437-38.   Alcorn State\n\nwas originally designated as an agricultural college for\n\nMississippi’s black youth, and Jackson State and Mississippi\n\nValley State, founded in 1940 and 1950, respectively, were\n\nestablished primarily to train black teachers.       Ayers I, 674 F.\n\nSupp. at 1527-28.   During the years 1945 through 1970, when both\n\nthe HWIs and the HBIs experienced considerable growth in\n\nenrollment, the bulk of the State’s higher education resources,\n\nparticularly programmatic allocations, went to University of\n\nMississippi, University of Southern Mississippi, and Mississippi\n\nState University, the three leading white universities.        Ayers\n\nII, 879 F. Supp. at 1439.\n\n     The district court found that the mission designations\n\nadopted by the Board in 1981 -- and in place throughout both the\n\n1987 and 1994 trials -- effectively fixed the scope of\n\nprogrammatic offerings that were in place at each university\n\nduring the de jure period.     Id. at 1438-39.   The Board designated\n\n\n                                  55\n\fUniversity of Mississippi, University of Southern Mississippi,\n\nand Mississippi State University “comprehensive” universities,\n\nthereby indicating that these institutions would continue to\n\noffer a greater number and a higher level of degree programs than\n\nall other institutions.   Based on its location in the city of\n\nJackson, Jackson State was designated an “urban” university with\n\nthe mission of serving the urban community.    The Board designated\n\nAlcorn State, Delta State, Mississippi University for Women, and\n\nMississippi Valley State “regional” universities, signifying a\n\nprogrammatic range limited to undergraduate instruction.     Id. at\n\n1438.\n\n     In Fordice, the Supreme Court found that\n\n     when combined with the differential admission practices\n     and unnecessary program duplication, it is likely that\n     the mission designations interfere with student choice\n     and tend to perpetuate the segregated system. On\n     remand, the court should inquire whether it would be\n     practicable and consistent with sound educational\n     practices to eliminate any such discriminatory effects\n     of the State’s present policy of mission assignments.\n\n505 U.S. at 741.   The district court indeed found that\n\n“[p]olicies and practices governing the missions of the\n\ninstitutions of higher learning are traceable to de jure\n\nsegregation and continue to foster separation of the races.”\n\nAyers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1477.    The remedial decree, however,\n\ndoes not order any alteration of the mission designations.     See\n\nid. at 1483.52   No party appeals retention of the mission\n\n\n     52\n         The Board apparently has upgraded the mission of Jackson\nState to an “enhanced” urban designation. Ayers II, 879 F. Supp.\nat 1483.\n\n                                  56\n\fdesignations per se.\n\n     The remedial decree does order some augmentation of the\n\nprograms offered at Jackson State and Alcorn State.53     The\n\ndistrict court found that the policies and practices of de jure\n\nsegregation impeded the development of both universities.       Id. at\n\n1466, 1484.   At Jackson State, the court found that the dearth of\n\nprofessional programs hindered potential other-race enrollment at\n\nthe main campus.   Id. at 1485.   Although the court found that the\n\nrecord supported neither the educational soundness of\n\ntransferring programs to Jackson State nor the desegregative\n\npotential of institutional affiliation with the University of\n\nMississippi Medical Center, it found that the addition of other\n\nunique, high demand programs did have potential to desegregate\n\nthe institution.   See id. at 1485-86.   The district court\n\naccordingly ordered implementation at Jackson State of programs\n\nin allied health, social work (Ph.D), urban planning\n\n(Masters/Ph.D), and business (DBA).54    Id. at 1494.   In addition,\n\nthe remedial decree directs the Board to undertake an\n\ninstitutional study\n\n     with the express purpose of determining the nature and\n     direction of those programs slated to be implemented,\n     as well as further programmatic expansion at JSU, to\n     best achieve the urban emphasis of its mission.\n     Included in this study will be an evaluation of the\n\n     53\n        The remedial decree orders the State to provide the\nfunding for all measures ordered by the decree. Ayers II, 879 F.\nSupp. at 1496.\n     54\n        The doctoral program in business is to be implemented at\nJackson State “when existing business programs are accredited.”\nAyers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1494.\n\n                                  57\n\f     feasibility and educational soundness of establishing\n     an engineering school, a public law school, and a five-\n     year pharmacy program under the direction and control\n     of JSU.\n\nId. at 1495.\n\n     With respect to Alcorn State, the district court found that\n\ncertain proposed programmatic enhancements promised realistically\n\nto increase other-race presence and were educationally sound.\n\nAccordingly, the district court ordered implementation of an MBA\n\nprogram at Alcorn’s Natchez Center, to be funded specially by the\n\nState along with related capital improvements.   The court also\n\nordered the State to provide the Small Farm Development Center at\n\nAlcorn with annual research and extension funds to match similar\n\nfederal funds appropriated to Alcorn, up to an aggregate of $4\n\nmillion each year.55   Id. at 1495.\n\n     The district court did not order any programmatic\n\nenhancements at Mississippi Valley State.   Although the court\n\nfound that Mississippi Valley State’s proximity to Delta State\n\ntended to perpetuate segregation,56 it stated that\n\n     [o]n the record . . . the court cannot find that\n     institutional enhancement of MVSU will eliminate the\n     vestiges of segregation that have contributed to MVSU’s\n     status as essentially a one-race institution. Evidence\n     does not persuade the court that merely adding programs\n     and increasing budgets will desegregate a HBI. That is\n     not to say, however, that changes made over time at the\n\n     55\n        The Small Farm Development Center falls within the land\ngrant function of Alcorn State. While we note this component of\nthe remedial decree here, we discuss the court’s ruling with\nrespect to land grant programs separately below.\n     56\n        The district court’s findings with respect to the\nsegregative effects of proximate and nonproximate institutions\nare set forth in our discussion of program duplication infra.\n\n                                 58\n\f      university consistent with its mission as a\n      baccalaureate institution cannot promote diversity at\n      the campus. The court cannot find that institutional\n      or programmatic enhancement of MVSU is justified as\n      educationally sound for desegregation purposes based on\n      this record.\n\nId. at 1491.   The court also found, however, that while\n\n      there is evidence to suggest that transferring programs\n      to MVSU may not be educationally sound, there is\n      likewise evidence that measures can be taken which,\n      over time, offer a potential of desegregating MVSU. As\n      one of the State’s own witnesses testified, evidence\n      suggests that HBIs in other formally de jure segregated\n      states have been successful in integrating their\n      student bodies through a variety of approaches and\n      measures.\n\nId.   The sole portion of the remedial decree that pertains\n\nspecifically to Mississippi Valley State is the following section\n\nconcerning the proposed merger with Delta State:\n\n           12. If, after further study of any available\n      educationally sound alternatives, the Board determines\n      that desegregation in the Mississippi Delta can be\n      attained only through its DSU/MVSU consolidation\n      proposal and that abandoning the financial investment\n      presently in place at the [MVSU] campus and\n      constructing replacement facilities at the [DSU] campus\n      present a practical course of action, it shall\n      substantiate that conclusion no later than July 1, 1996\n      to the Monitoring Committee.\n\nId. at 1495.\n\n      Finally, the district court determined that practices\n\nconcerning accreditation of academic programs at the HBIs did not\n\nwarrant remedial relief.57   The court found that while none of\n\nthe HBIs was accredited as of 1961, each has now attained\n\n      57\n        Private plaintiffs and the United States challenged\n“[t]he practice of failing to take the necessary steps (including\nthe provision[] of required facilities) to secure the\naccreditation of programs at the HBIs.” Ayers II, 879 F. Supp.\nat 1497, 1501.\n\n                                 59\n\faccreditation and “[s]ince 1980, with the possible exception of\n\nJSU, the overall percentage of programs accredited at all\n\nuniversities has increased substantially.”   Id. at 1441.   The\n\ncourt found that the State’s “inattentiveness” to the HBIs during\n\nthe de jure period with regard to program and institutional\n\naccreditation negatively affected institutional prestige, but\n\nthat “there is no evidence that the State’s previous failings in\n\nthis regard persist into the present day.”   Id. at 1445.   The\n\ncourt stated that little evidence had been presented on the\n\npresent status of the accreditation issue.   Id.\n\n          b.    Arguments on appeal\n\n     Plaintiffs argue that the district court erred as a matter\n\nof law by failing to order any new programs at Mississippi Valley\n\nState and only two new programs at Alcorn State.   While\n\nplaintiffs do not challenge the district court’s rejection of the\n\nBoard’s proposal to merge Mississippi Valley State and Delta\n\nState, they contend that the record does not support the court’s\n\nconclusion that programmatic enhancement of Mississippi Valley\n\nState will not help to desegregate the Delta.   Plaintiffs argue\n\nwith respect to Alcorn State that further relief is warranted\n\ngiven the Natchez location of the MBA program, which plaintiffs\n\ncontend will not help to desegregate the main campus,58 and the\n\nState’s prior commitment to funding the Small Farm Development\n\nCenter.   The United States specifically asks this court to remand\n\n\n     58\n        The Natchez Center is located approximately 40 miles\nfrom Alcorn’s main campus. Ayers I, 674 F. Supp. at 1542.\n\n                                60\n\fwith instructions to order the Board to study and report to the\n\nMonitoring Committee on actions that could be taken to enable\n\nMississippi Valley State and Alcorn State to attract students of\n\nall races, including improvement of existing programs and the\n\naddition of unique, high demand programs.59   Plaintiffs do not\n\nappeal the district court’s order as it pertains to programmatic\n\nenhancement of Jackson State.60\n\n     Private plaintiffs also argue that the district court\n\nclearly erred in finding that problems with accreditation of\n\nprograms at the HBIs do not persist to the present.\n\n     Defendants contend that the traceability of mission\n\nassignments does not warrant institutional enhancement of the\n\nHBIs beyond that ordered by the district court, and that the\n\nrecord does not support general enhancement of these institutions\n\nas a desegregation tool.\n\n          c.   Analysis\n\n     The issue of programmatic enhancement directly implicates\n\npolicies governing institutional missions, which the district\n\ncourt found to be traceable to the de jure system and to have\n\ncurrent segregative effects.   Fordice mandates that the State\n\n\n     59\n        The United States in its brief argues that the district\ncourt should have ordered additional funding at the HBIs to,\namong other things, “improve the quality of existing programs.”\nU.S. Br. at 44. Except for specific issues (such as, for\nexample, program accreditation and faculty salaries) that we have\naddressed elsewhere in this opinion, the general issue of program\nquality is not briefed and we therefore do not address it.\n     60\n        The parties’ arguments concerning the land grant\nprograms in particular are discussed in Part III.B.3 infra.\n\n                                  61\n\feliminate such vestiges of the prior system to the extent\n\npracticable and consistent with sound educational practices.\n\nThis is a substantial burden; accordingly, to the extent that the\n\nrecord indicates that the State could practicably take steps to\n\ndesegregate that do not run afoul of sound educational practices,\n\nthe State has a duty to do so and the remedial decree should so\n\nreflect.\n\n     Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the\n\ndistrict court’s finding that “merely adding programs and\n\nincreasing budgets” is not likely to desegregate an HBI, Ayers\n\nII, 879 F. Supp. at 1491, is supported by the evidence and is not\n\nclearly erroneous.   There was testimony that the Louisiana\n\nexperience with implementation of a consent decree to desegregate\n\npublic institutions of higher education was not successful in\n\nattracting white students to historically black universities,\n\ndespite investment of over $75 million in new academic programs\n\nat those universities.   The evidence showed that there was no\n\ncorrelation between dollars expended on new program\n\nimplementation and white enrollment in those programs.   During\n\nthe six years (1981-87) that the Louisiana consent decree was in\n\neffect, white enrollment in predominantly black universities\n\nincreased by just 1.1%, while black enrollment in predominantly\n\nwhite universities decreased from 56% to 47% of black enrollment\n\nin the system as a whole.61\n\n     61\n        Cf. United States v. Louisiana, 692 F. Supp. 642, 645\n(E.D. La. 1988) (“Despite the slight increase in black enrollment\nstatewide, the racial polarization has increased as a whole\n\n                                62\n\f     The district court’s findings do indicate, however, that\n\nsteps can be taken that might serve to desegregate Mississippi\n\nValley State, although determining what those steps might be\n\nrequires further study.   In its discussion of Mississippi Valley\n\nState in the context of the proposed merger with Delta State, the\n\ncourt stated that “evidence suggests that HBIs in other formally\n\nde jure segregated states have been successful in integrating\n\ntheir student bodies through a variety of approaches and\n\nmeasures.”   Id.   Indeed, evidence presented by the United States\n\nand defendants indicates that well-planned programs that respond\n\nto the particular needs and interests of local populations can\n\nhelp to desegregate historically black institutions.   Witnesses\n\nfor both parties testified that programs not duplicated at\n\nproximate institutions, targeted to local demands, and in many\n\ncases offered through alternative delivery systems (such as off-\n\ncampus, evening, or weekend programs) have had success in\n\nattracting white students to historically black institutions in\n\nother states.\n\n     Consistent with its findings regarding the potential to\n\ndesegregate Mississippi Valley State, the district court stated\n\n\nduring the term of the consent decree: the predominantly white\ninstitutions had about 2000 fewer black students in 1987 than in\n1981, while the predominantly black institutions showed only a\nnegligible increase in white enrollment from around 0.3% in 1981\nto around 1.1% in 1987.”). According to the three-judge court\nthat reviewed the special master’s final report in the Louisiana\ncase, “[t]he experience of the consent decree confirms that\nenhancement of [predominantly black institutions] without more\nsimply makes [predominantly black institutions] more attractive\nto black students, without attracting white students.” United\nStates v. Louisiana, 718 F. Supp. 499, 508 (E.D. La. 1989).\n\n                                 63\n\fin its opinion that it “will direct the Board to explore these\n\nareas more thoroughly to determine what measures have had success\n\nin other systems of higher education, if any, which also have a\n\nreasonable chance of success in desegregating MVSU.”     Id. at\n\n1492.     This directive, however, was not incorporated into the\n\nremedial decree.     This may be explained by the fact that the\n\nfuture of Mississippi Valley State was uncertain at the time the\n\ndistrict court drafted its opinion.     Under the remedial decree,\n\nmerger with DSU remained a possibility that depended upon the\n\nBoard’s study of options for desegregating the Delta region.       We\n\ncannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in\n\nfailing to order the above relief when the very existence of\n\nMississippi Valley State as an independent institution remained\n\nin question.     At present, however, all parties apparently have\n\nconcluded that merger of Mississippi Valley State with Delta\n\nState is neither required nor desired.62    On remand, the district\n\ncourt must clarify the status of the merger proposal.     If the\n\ndistrict court confirms that merger will no longer be pursued,\n\nthen the district court must address the continuing segregative\n\neffects of Mississippi Valley State’s limited mission and\n\nincorporate into its remedial decree a provision requiring the\n\nBoard, on a continuing basis, to study and report to the\n\n     62\n        Counsel for defendants stated at oral argument before\nthis court that defendants had publicly announced that they were\nno longer pursuing merger. In its brief, the United States\nexpressed unqualified support for the district court’s rejection\nof the merger proposal. Private plaintiffs’ argument for\nenhancement of Mississippi Valley State likewise indicates their\nopposition to merger.\n\n                                  64\n\fMonitoring Committee on new academic programs that have a\n\nreasonable chance of increasing other-race presence at\n\nMississippi Valley State.\n\n     Plaintiffs’ contention that the district court was required\n\nto order further relief at Alcorn State is less persuasive, at\n\nleast as it addresses the short term.   We are not persuaded that\n\nfurther relief is warranted on the basis of the MBA program’s\n\nlocation away from the main campus at Natchez; plaintiffs’ own\n\nexpert testified that off-campus offerings are among those\n\ninitiatives that have been successful at attracting other-race\n\nstudents to historically black institutions.   Nor are we\n\npersuaded that the State’s prior commitment to funding the Small\n\nFarm Development Center necessitates the order of additional\n\nrelief; this fact does not implicate the Fordice standard for\n\nremedial relief.   The record does suggest, however, that measures\n\nthat have been successful in desegregating historically black\n\ninstitutions in other states may have potential over the longer\n\nterm to be effective also at Alcorn State.   We see no reason, in\n\nlight of the traceability of the HBIs’ limited missions and of\n\ntheir continuing racial identifiability, to limit continuing\n\nstudy of new academic programs with desegregative potential to\n\nJackson State.   The district court should have incorporated such\n\nrelief with respect to Alcorn State into the remedial decree.\n\n     We recognize that substantial evidence indicates that\n\nefforts to desegregate an HBI can succeed only insofar as they\n\ntap into locale-specific demands.    Any such inherent limitation\n\n\n                                65\n\fon the potential to achieve desegregation in the university\n\ncontext may underlie some of the district court’s findings and\n\nsuggests that implementation of unique, high demand programs that\n\ncan reasonably be expected to attract white students to HBIs may\n\nultimately turn out to be quite modest.\n\n     Private plaintiffs’ argument that the district court clearly\n\nerred in finding no present neglect by the State with respect to\n\naccreditation of programs at the HBIs is unavailing.   The\n\ndistrict court’s finding of substantial increases in the\n\npercentage of programs accredited at all universities is\n\nsupported by the record, and private plaintiffs do not identify\n\nany present policy that currently hinders accreditation of\n\nprograms at the HBIs.\n\n     Private plaintiffs’ accreditation concerns are relevant,\n\nhowever, to one aspect of the district court’s remedial decree.\n\nThe doctoral program in business that the court ordered at\n\nJackson State is not to be implemented until existing business\n\nprograms are accredited, and the record indicates that despite\n\nthe Board’s goal of achieving accreditation for these programs,\n\nset forth as early as 1974 in the Board’s plan of compliance with\n\nTitle VI, it has not yet been accomplished.   The record is not\n\nclear as to the reasons that these programs are not yet\n\naccredited.   In the interest of ensuring that the district\n\ncourt’s order concerning the doctoral program in business be\n\ngiven meaningful effect, the district court on remand should\n\ninquire into present efforts to achieve accreditation of Jackson\n\n\n                                66\n\fState’s business programs and order any relief that is\n\nappropriate with respect to the Board.\n\n            d.   Conclusions regarding new academic programs\n\n     We affirm the portions of the remedial decree addressing the\n\naddition of new academic programs at Jackson State and Alcorn\n\nState.    We direct the district court on remand to clarify the\n\nstatus of the Board’s proposal to merge Mississippi Valley State\n\nwith Delta State.    If the district court confirms that merger\n\nwill no longer be pursued, it should incorporate into the\n\nremedial decree a provision directing the Board to study and to\n\nreport to the Monitoring Committee on whether there are any new\n\nacademic programs, including programs which have had success in\n\ndesegregating other systems of higher education, that may have a\n\nreasonable chance of success in desegregating Mississippi Valley\n\nState.    We further remand for incorporation into the remedial\n\ndecree of a similar provision directed to Alcorn State covering\n\nnew academic and land grant programs.    On the issue of\n\naccreditation, the district court should determine the status of\n\ncurrent efforts to achieve accreditation of existing business\n\nprograms at Jackson State and order appropriate relief, if\n\nnecessary, to ensure that the Board is taking steps commensurate\n\nwith its role in this accreditation process.\n\n     3.     Land Grant Programs\n\n            a.   District court ruling\n\n     Mississippi State University and Alcorn State University are\n\n\n\n\n                                  67\n\fMississippi’s two public land grant institutions.63    As found by\n\nthe district court, the traditional elements of the land grant\n\nfunction consist of residential instruction, agricultural\n\nresearch (including an experiment station), and an extension\n\nservice.64   Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1464.   The district court\n\nfound that during the de jure period the State consistently\n\ndirected federal and state land grant funds toward Mississippi\n\nState University rather than Alcorn State.     Id. at 1464-65.\n\nSpecifically, Mississippi directed all federal funding for\n\nagricultural research under the Hatch Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 361a-361i,\n\nand all federal funding for extension services to farmers under\n\nthe Smith-Lever Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 341-349, to Mississippi State,65\n\nwhile Alcorn State received federal funding only under an 1890\n\nfederal statute providing funds for black land grant colleges.\n\n     63\n        “A land grant institution is defined as a college\nuniversity [sic] entitled to financial and programmatic support\nfrom the federal government pursuant to a series of statutes\noriginating with the Morrill Acts enacted by Congress in 1862 and\n1890.” Ayers I, 674 F. Supp. at 1543. The Morrill Act of 1862\nand subsequent statutes “defined the land grant college to be an\ninstitution that provides instruction in agriculture and\nmechanical arts, research in agriculture through the experimental\nstations, and extension of knowledge to farmers through\ncooperative extension programs.” Id.\n     64\n        Cooperative extension is a joint effort of the federal\ngovernment, land grant institutions, and county governments to\ntransfer knowledge to farmers and assist in the development of\nfarm operations. Ayers I, 674 F. Supp. at 1545. Cooperative\nextension originated with the Smith-Lever Act of 1914, 7 U.S.C.\n§§ 341-349, and is jointly financed by federal, state, and county\ngovernments. Ayers I, 674 F. Supp. at 1545.\n     65\n        Although the district court made no specific finding in\nthis regard, the evidence indicates that matching state funds\nwere directed to Mississippi State along with the Hatch and\nSmith-Lever federal appropriations.\n\n                                 68\n\fAyers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1464.     As a result, Mississippi State\n\nenjoys land grant activities of much greater size and breadth\n\nthan Alcorn State.   Id. at 1466.      The district court found that\n\n“[o]peration and maintenance of two racially identifiable land\n\ngrant programs are traceable to de jure segregation and have\n\nsegregative effects.”    Id. at 1477.\n\n     The court made findings with respect to each of the\n\ntraditional land grant functions.      The court found that the\n\nquality of residential instruction is directly and positively\n\naffected by agricultural research conducted on the campus of a\n\nland grant institution, which is more extensive at Mississippi\n\nState than at Alcorn State due to Mississippi State’s broader\n\nresearch mission.    Id. at 1464, 1466.    Turning to agricultural\n\nresearch, the court found:\n\n          With little or no exception, federal Hatch Act\n     dollars are administered in every state by a single\n     institution. In this time of fewer and fewer persons\n     entering the field of agriculture, but the system\n     nevertheless effectively feeding more and more people,\n     it would be inefficient and, thus, educationally\n     unsound to administer two separate agricultural\n     research programs in the state. To diffuse the program\n     would create two separate administrative entities,\n     difficulties in communication among the participating\n     scientists, and inefficient duplication.\n\nId. at 1465.\n\n     Similarly, the court found that it would be unsound to\n\nadminister federal funds for cooperative extension work through\n\ntwo independent cooperative extension programs:\n\n          The general rule of practice is that Smith-Lever\n     funds are administered by only one university in each\n     state. . . . To duplicate administrative processes and\n     procedures as it relates to the delivery of extension\n\n                                  69\n\f     programming is unsound because the short duration of\n     extension educational programs makes program\n     coordination difficult from year to year.\n\nId. at 1465-66.\n\n     Although the court found that “the operation of two racially\n\nidentifiable land grant institutions might continue to have some\n\nsegregative effects that would be minuscule because of the small\n\nnumber of students now majoring in agriculture,” id. at 1484, it\n\nconcluded that “[t]he current allocation of agricultural\n\neducation programs is educationally sound and there exists no\n\npractical alternative to the current method of providing research\n\nand extension services.”     Id. at 1466.   With the exception of a\n\nspecial funding allocation for the Small Farm Development Center\n\nat Alcorn State, the remedial decree did not mandate any changes\n\nin current land grant policies or practices.      See id. at 1494-96.\n\n          b.      Arguments on appeal\n\n     The United States argues that “the court erred as a matter\n\nof law when it failed to evaluate alternative proposals for\n\nchanges in the allocation of land grant programs short of\n\ndividing the land grant programs equally between the 2\n\ninstitutions.”    U.S. Br. at 47.    The United States further\n\ncontends that to the extent the district court’s conclusion that\n\nthere are no practical alternatives to the current method of\n\nproviding research and extension services “is a finding that\n\nthere are no educationally sound alternatives to the present\n\nallocation of programs, that finding is clearly erroneous.”      Id.\n\nPrivate plaintiffs advance similar arguments.      Both the United\n\n\n                                    70\n\fStates and private plaintiffs cite evidence that there are unmet\n\nneeds in Mississippi for new land grant programs, such as water\n\nquality, that could be met at Alcorn State.\n\n       Defendants argue that the district court correctly found\n\nthat any segregative effects associated with the operation of two\n\nracially identifiable land grant institutions could not be\n\nremedied consistent with sound educational practices.    Defendants\n\nfurther contend that the addition of agricultural programs at\n\nAlcorn State will not contribute to desegregation.\n\n            c.   Analysis\n\n       The district court’s finding that it would be impractical\n\nand educationally unsound to alter the current method of\n\nproviding research and extension services is well supported by\n\nexpert testimony in the record.    As the district court found, the\n\nprimary source of federal funds for agricultural research is the\n\nHatch Act, and for cooperative extension funds the Smith-Lever\n\nAct.    Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1464.   Substantial evidence\n\nindicates that federal (and matching state) funds appropriated\n\nthrough these acts typically are administered by a single\n\ninstitution in each state and that it would be unsound to\n\nadminister in Mississippi either two separate research programs\n\nwith Hatch funds or two separate extension programs with Smith-\n\nLever funds.\n\n       Contrary to the suggestion of plaintiffs, the district court\n\nopinion does not limit its consideration of changes in the\n\nallocation of research and extension funds to “equally” dividing\n\n\n                                  71\n\fsuch funds between Mississippi State and Alcorn State.    While the\n\ncourt recognized that it would be inappropriate to break up the\n\nacademic and research facilities at Mississippi State and Alcorn\n\nState and divide them “equally” between educational institutions\n\nsolely on the basis of Alcorn State’s heretofore restricted\n\ndevelopment, see id. at 1466, this statement reflects a legal\n\nstandard rather than a finding drawn from the evidence on\n\npracticability or educational soundness.    The evidence led the\n\ndistrict court to conclude more generally that “[t]he current\n\nallocation of agricultural education programs is educationally\n\nsound and there exists no practical alternative to the current\n\nmethod of providing research and extension services.”    Id.66\n\nPlaintiffs’ argument that the district court should have\n\nconsidered alternatives other than an “equal” division of land\n\ngrant programs accordingly is without merit.\n\n     We read the district court’s conclusion that it would be\n\nimpractical and educationally unsound to change the current\n\npractice of administering research and extension services\n\nprimarily through Mississippi State to be limited to research and\n\nextension services funded through the Hatch and Smith-Lever Acts,\n\nas those statutes are now configured.   Significantly, we do not\n\nread the district court opinion to preclude future implementation\n\nof land grant programs at Alcorn State.    Instead, the district\n\n     66\n        The district court similarly stated that “[t]he evidence\npreponderates toward the conclusion that dividing the roles\nwithin the extension arena between two universities rather than\nas it is currently conducted is not an educationally sound\nalternative.” Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1484.\n\n                               72\n\fcourt’s implicit decision not to order implementation at this\n\ntime at Alcorn State of a program in water quality or any other\n\nland grant program offered by plaintiffs reflects the lack of\n\nsufficient definition of any of these programs in this record.\n\nThe addition to the remedial decree, see Part III.B.2.d supra, of\n\na provision directing the Board, on a continuing basis, to study\n\nand to report to the Monitoring Committee on programs that have a\n\nreasonable chance of increasing other-race presence at Alcorn\n\nState encompasses land grant programs as well as new academic\n\nprograms and permits further study of the programs proposed by\n\nplaintiffs.\n\n           d.   Conclusions regarding land grant programs\n\n     We affirm the district court’s ruling as it concerns land\n\ngrant functions at Mississippi State and Alcorn State.\n\n     4.    Duplication of Programs\n\n           a.   Fordice\n\n     Program duplication was one of the four remnants of the de\n\njure system identified by the Supreme Court in Fordice.     505 U.S.\n\nat 738.   Following the 1987 trial, the district court found\n\nsignificant duplication of programs at the HBIs by the HWIs,\n\nAyers I, 674 F. Supp. at 1541, but concluded that “there is no\n\nproof” that such duplication “is directly associated with the\n\nracial identifiability of institutions,” and that “there is no\n\nproof that the elimination of unnecessary program duplication\n\nwould be justifiable from an educational standpoint or that its\n\nelimination would have a substantial effect on student choice.”\n\n\n                                73\n\fId. at 1561.    The Supreme Court stated that “[i]t can hardly be\n\ndenied that such duplication was part and parcel of the prior\n\ndual system of higher education -- the whole notion of ‘separate\n\nbut equal’ required duplicative programs in two sets of schools -\n\n- and that the present unnecessary duplication is a continuation\n\nof that practice.”    Fordice, 505 U.S. at 738.   The Court\n\nemphasized that the State bears the burden of proving that\n\npresent-day program duplication is not constitutionally defective\n\nand held that the district court had improperly shifted the\n\nburden to plaintiffs.    Id.   The Court indicated that, on remand,\n\nthe district court should “consider the combined effects of\n\nunnecessary program duplication with other policies, such as\n\ndifferential admissions standards, in evaluating whether the\n\nState had met its duty to dismantle its prior de jure segregated\n\nsystem.”   Id. at 739.\n\n           b.    District court ruling\n\n     The alleged remnant presented by plaintiffs to the district\n\ncourt on remand was “[t]he policy and practice of unnecessarily\n\nduplicating HBIs’ programs and course offerings at HWIs.”       Ayers\n\nII, 879 F. Supp. at 1498, 1502.    The district court defined\n\n“unnecessary duplication” as “‘those instances where two or more\n\ninstitutions offer the same nonessential or noncore program.’”\n\nId. at 1441 (quoting Ayers I, 674 F. Supp. at 1540).     “‘Under\n\nthis definition, all duplication at the bachelors level of\n\nnonbasic liberal arts and sciences course work and all\n\nduplication at the masters level and above are considered to be\n\n\n                                  74\n\funnecessary.’”   Id.\n\n     The district court found that 40% of the noncore bachelors\n\nprograms offered at one or more of the three HBIs are\n\nunnecessarily duplicated at one or more of the five HWIs; 83% of\n\nthe masters programs offered at one or more of the HBIs are\n\nunnecessarily duplicated at one or more of the five HWIs; 60% of\n\nthe specialist programs offered at one or more of the HBIs are\n\nunnecessarily duplicated at one or more of the five HWIs; and 25%\n\nof the doctoral programs offered at one or more of the HBIs are\n\nunnecessarily duplicated at one or more of the five HWIs.      Id. at\n\n1443.   As a group, the HWIs have significantly more high demand,\n\nnoncore programs that are not duplicated anywhere else in the\n\nsystem as compared with the HBIs as a group.    Id. at 1442.\n\n     Analyzing program duplication in general, the district court\n\nfound that the joint operation of duplicative offerings between\n\nracially identifiable institutions and differential admissions\n\nstandards “raises a serious inference that this duplication\n\ncontinues to promote segregation.”    Id. at 1445.   The court drew\n\na distinction, however, between proximate and nonproximate\n\ninstitutions in making more specific findings on the question of\n\nsegregative effect.    The court concluded that only program\n\nduplication between proximate, racially identifiable institutions\n\nwas traceable to de jure segregation and had segregative effects.\n\nId. at 1477, 1486.\n\n     The court addressed two instances of program duplication\n\nbetween proximate, racially identifiable institutions.     First,\n\n\n                                 75\n\fin its remedial decree, the district court ordered the Board to\n\n“take whatever remaining steps are necessary, if any, to vest\n\ncomplete institutional control in JSU over the facility formerly\n\nknown as the Universities Center in JSU.”     Id. at 1495.   The\n\nUniversities Center, located in Jackson, consisted of extension\n\nprograms operated by various HWIs.     Ayers I, 674 F. Supp. at\n\n1542.   In 1972 the Board voted to assign management\n\nresponsibilities for the Universities Center to Mississippi\n\nState, the University of Mississippi, and Jackson State.      Id.     At\n\nthe trials in 1987 and 1994, plaintiffs identified continued\n\noperation of these extension programs in close proximity with\n\nJackson State as a vestige of the de jure system.      The district\n\ncourt’s order eliminates whatever competition for enrollment the\n\nUniversities Center fostered with respect to Jackson State.\n\n     Second, the court considered program duplication between\n\nMississippi Valley State and Delta State, which are proximate,\n\nracially identifiable institutions in the Delta.    The district\n\ncourt found that\n\n     [b]ecause of the proximity of these institutions\n     (approximately 35 miles apart) and the similar scope of\n     their missions, (liberal arts undergraduate\n     institutions) [sic] location, costs and program\n     offerings would not appear to have a significant impact\n     on student choice. Rather, lower admissions standards\n     at MVSU appear more likely to attract black students of\n     the Delta region, since as a class black students score\n     lower on the standardized tests used for admission to\n     universities. In light of differing admissions\n     standards, it is clear that program duplication between\n     these two universities does foster segregation.\n\nAyers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1486.    The district court noted that\n\nmerger of Mississippi Valley State and Delta State would\n\n                                  76\n\feliminate segregative duplication, id. at 1486, 1489, but\n\nrejected the Board’s merger proposal for a number of other\n\nreasons.    See id. at 1491-92.   In so doing, the court indicated\n\nthat measures “less drastic” than merger should be considered.\n\nId. at 1492.    In its conclusions of law, the district court\n\nstated that “the Board must study program duplication between DSU\n\nand MVSU to determine whether any segregative duplication may be\n\neliminated consistent with sound educational practices.”        Id. at\n\n1494.   Neither this directive nor any other remedy pertaining to\n\ndecreasing program duplication with respect to Mississippi Valley\n\nState, however, was incorporated into the remedial decree.\n\n      Turning to program duplication between nonproximate\n\ninstitutions, the district court found that “it has not been\n\nestablished that program duplication between non-proximate\n\nracially identifiable universities significantly fosters\n\nsegregation.”    Id. at 1486.   The court found that factors\n\naffecting student choice included location, academic reputation,\n\nand prestige, none of which is implicated by program duplication.\n\nId.   Noting that admissions standards help to shape public\n\nperceptions of an institution, the court found that “[t]he\n\nconsistently lower admissions standards in effect at the HBIs\n\nhave perpetuated the perception that these institutions are\n\ninferior.   Accordingly, the likelihood of significant\n\ndesegregation of HBIs is small and confined to those students who\n\nare academically underprepared.”       Id.   The court concluded that\n\nabsent differences in “prestige or public image,” unnecessary\n\n\n                                  77\n\fduplication “has little to do with student choice.”      Id.     Program\n\nduplication is most likely to influence students who are not\n\nplace-bound and who have the greatest flexibility in choosing an\n\ninstitution.     Id.67\n\n      The court concluded that “[s]ystem-wide admissions\n\nstandards, coupled with the financial and programmatic\n\nenhancements of JSU and ASU, realistically promise to obviate or\n\nlessen whatever segregative effects are potentially harbored by\n\nthe duplication between racially identifiable non-proximate\n\ninstitutions.”     Id.   In addition, the court found that the\n\nBoard’s existing process for reviewing programs is an\n\neducationally sound method of managing duplication in the system.\n\nId.   Under this process, Board staff consults with university\n\nofficials whenever a program’s enrollment or graduation rates\n\ndrop below a certain level predetermined by the Board.       The\n\nuniversity is then given an opportunity to justify continuation\n\nof the program despite its deficiencies.      Id. at 1443.\n\n      Although the court indicated that uniform admissions,\n\nprogrammatic enhancements, and the Board’s program review\n\nprocedures would adequately mitigate any potential segregative\n\neffects of program duplication between nonproximate institutions,\n\nit ordered the Board to study program duplication with respect to\n\n\n      67\n        Elsewhere, the district court found that operation of\nAlcorn State and Mississippi State, which are nonproximate,\nracially identifiable, land grant institutions, “might continue\nto have some segregative effects that would be minuscule because\nof the small number of students now majoring in agriculture.”\nAyers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1484.\n\n                                   78\n\fJackson State.    The Board is to undertake this as part of a\n\ngeneral study:\n\n          4. The Board shall undertake an on-site\n     institutional study of JSU to determine the relative\n     strengths and weaknesses of its existing programs as\n     soon as is practicable. . . . The nature and extent of\n     duplication with other institutions in the system will\n     be addressed in this study in the context of\n     determining whether meaningful programmatic uniqueness\n     may be gained which would bring about significant white\n     enrollment through elimination and/or transfer of\n     existing programs at other institutions and the\n     feasibility/educational soundness of such elimination\n     and/or transfer.\n\nId. at 1494-95.\n\n          c.      Arguments on appeal\n\n     The United States argues that the district court erred in\n\nfailing to order the Board “to undertake a system-wide effort to\n\nreduce program duplication and to increase the numbers of unique\n\nhigh demand offerings at the [HBIs].”   U.S. Br. at 47-48.   The\n\nUnited States’s argument on this issue continues, in its\n\nentirety, as follows:\n\n     The court’s finding that duplication between\n     nonproximate institutions does not cause segregation\n     contains no citations or references to record evidence,\n     and appears to be based upon its findings that other\n     factors, such as location, affect student choice,\n     rather than any evidence that duplication does not\n     affect choice. Again, the court impermissibly placed\n     the burden of proof on the plaintiffs, rather than on\n     the defendants. And its finding that the Board’s\n     existing program review process is adequate to\n     eliminate any segregative effect of duplication, is\n     clearly erroneous, since that process is not triggered\n     by the existence of duplication or the need to promote\n     desegregation.\n\nId. at 48 (citations omitted).    Private plaintiffs do not raise\n\nthe issue of program duplication on appeal.\n\n\n                                  79\n\f            d.   Analysis\n\n     No party contests the district court’s finding that program\n\nduplication between proximate racially identifiable institutions\n\nis traceable to de jure segregation and continues to have\n\nsegregative effects.    We therefore accept this finding as\n\nsupported by the record and conclude that the United States’s\n\nargument as it applies to Mississippi Valley State is well taken.\n\nThe district court itself stated that it would order a study of\n\nprogram duplication between Mississippi Valley State and Delta\n\nState, see Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1494, yet failed to\n\nincorporate any such provision into the remedial decree.      Again,\n\nthe omission may have been occasioned by the continuing\n\npossibility that Mississippi Valley State would be merged with\n\nDelta State.     See Part III.B.2.c supra.   We cannot conclude that\n\nthe district court abused its discretion in failing to order a\n\nstudy of program duplication at Mississippi Valley State when the\n\ncontinued existence of Mississippi Valley State remained in\n\nquestion.    However, upon conclusion of the inquiry we have\n\nordered above, if the district court confirms that merger will no\n\nlonger be pursued, then the district court must incorporate into\n\nits remedial decree a provision requiring the Board to study and\n\nreport to the Monitoring Committee on unnecessary program\n\nduplication between Mississippi Valley State and Delta State.68\n\n     68\n        As we noted in our discussion of new academic programs,\nPart III.B.2.b supra, the specific relief requested by the United\nStates on appeal with respect to enhancement of the HBIs is an\norder requiring the Board to study and report to the Monitoring\nCommittee on actions that could make the HBIs more attractive to\n\n                                  80\n\f     The United States’s argument as it applies to nonproximate\n\ninstitutions, on the other hand, is not briefed sufficiently for\n\nthis court to review this aspect of the district court’s ruling\n\nfor error.    Cf. Cinel v. Connick, 15 F.3d 1338, 1345 (5th Cir.),\n\ncert. denied, 513 U.S. 868 (1994)(“A party who inadequately\n\nbriefs an issue is considered to have abandoned the claim.”).    It\n\nis of no consequence that the district court did not cite to the\n\nrecord in the portion of its opinion addressing the potential\n\nsegregative effects of program duplication in nonproximate\n\ninstitutions.   While citations to the record are helpful, and we\n\ncommend the district court for its abundant documentation of the\n\nrecord throughout its opinion as a whole, the district court is\n\nnot required to provide them.   Significantly, the United States\n\ndoes not contend that the court’s finding of no segregative\n\neffect in the context of nonproximate institutions is clearly\n\nerroneous.\n\n     The United States argues, rather, that the court\n\nimpermissibly shifted the burden of proof on this issue to the\n\nplaintiffs.   While the court’s language might suggest imposition\n\nof the burden of proof on plaintiffs (“it has not been\n\nestablished that program duplication between non-proximate\n\nracially identifiable universities significantly fosters\n\nsegregation”), its reasoning indicates reliance not on the\n\nabsence of evidence of segregative effect, but rather on the\n\n\nwhite students. In light of this request and the structure of\nthe remedial decree, where we have ordered relief in the\nenhancement area, we have done so in those terms.\n\n                                 81\n\fpresence of evidence that factors other than duplicative program\n\nofferings have a more significant effect on student choice.      We\n\nare not persuaded that the court erred in its allocation of the\n\nburden of proof.\n\n     The United States’s argument that the district court’s\n\nfinding “that the Board’s existing program review process is\n\nadequate to eliminate any segregative effect of duplication is\n\nclearly erroneous” mischaracterizes the district court’s finding.\n\nThe court found that “the Board’s program review process is an\n\neducationally sound way of managing duplication in the system.”\n\nAyers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1486.    This finding is supported in the\n\nrecord and makes no pretense of disposing of the issue of\n\npotential segregative effects.    The court went on to conclude\n\nthat “[s]ystem-wide admissions standards, coupled with the\n\nfinancial and programmatic enhancements of JSU and ASU,\n\nrealistically promise to obviate or lessen whatever segregative\n\neffects are potentially harbored by the duplication between\n\nracially identifiable non-proximate institutions.”      Id.   We note\n\nthat even in light of this conclusion, the district court did\n\norder a study of program duplication at Jackson State to\n\ndetermine if elimination or transfer of programs at other\n\ninstitutions might help attract white students to Jackson State.\n\nId. at 1495.\n\n          e.   Conclusions regarding program duplication\n\n     We affirm the district court’s findings and conclusions on\n\nthe issue of program duplication.      If, on remand, the district\n\n\n                                  82\n\fcourt confirms that the merger of Mississippi Valley State and\n\nDelta State will no longer be pursued, the district court should\n\nincorporate into its remedial decree a provision requiring the\n\nBoard to study and to report to the Monitoring Committee on\n\nunnecessary program duplication between Mississippi Valley State\n\nand Delta State.\n\n     5.    Funding\n\n           a.   District court ruling\n\n     Mississippi’s eight universities receive state funding\n\nthrough both an annual legislative general support appropriation\n\nand line item appropriations.    The universities also rely on\n\nself-generated funds, which include private contributions as well\n\nas federal grants and loans.    See id. at 1446-53; Ayers I, 674 F.\n\nSupp. at 1546-48.    In its overall findings of liability, the\n\ndistrict court concluded that “[f]unding policies and practices\n\nfollow the mission assignments and, to that degree only, are\n\ntraceable to prior de jure segregation.”    Ayers II, 879 F. Supp.\n\nat 1477.   We discuss each source of state funding and the\n\nrelevant findings of the district court in turn.\n\n     The Board is responsible for allocating the legislative\n\ngeneral support appropriation among the universities.    Beginning\n\nin 1974, the Board utilized a funding formula that allocated this\n\nfunding to the universities in accordance with their mission\n\ndesignations.   In November of 1987, following the first trial,\n\nthe Board adopted a new funding formula under which level of\n\nfunding is determined by the size of a university’s enrollment,\n\n\n                                 83\n\ffaculty, and physical plant.    Id. at 1449 & n.122.   The 1987\n\nfunding formula consists of eight components:    instruction,\n\nresearch, public service, academic support, student services,\n\ninstitutional support, operation and maintenance, and\n\nscholarships and fellowships.    Id. at 1447.   By far the largest\n\nof these components is instruction, which accounted for more than\n\n58% of the total budget in fiscal year 1994-95.     Id.   The general\n\nsupport appropriation does not include funds for capital\n\nimprovements.    Id.\n\n     The district court found that\n\n     because the size of the university’s enrollment\n     determines the level of funding, the larger\n     institutions with the highest percentage of upper level\n     programs obtain the greatest amount of funding. This\n     causes practically the same result as under the\n     previous formula that funded by institutional mission\n     designation.\n\nId. at 1449.    Stated differently, the court found that “the\n\nhistorical disparity in funding between the HWIs and HBIs once\n\npracticed by law persists through perpetuation of the status quo\n\nas it existed then.”    Id. at 1452-53.   The court concluded,\n\nhowever, that\n\n          [c]urrent policies and practices governing funding\n     of institutions are lawful. There is no per se funding\n     policy or practice traceable to the de jure era.\n     Attainment of funding “equity” between the HBIs and\n     HWIs is impractical and educationally unsound. It can\n     neither be attained within our lifetime nor . . . does\n     it realistically promise to guarantee further\n     desegregation given the present institutional\n     landscape. The testimony showed that the formula is\n     largely geared to funding the students without\n     consideration of race at whichever institution the\n     students choose to attend and at the program level the\n     students choose. Accordingly, the court finds that the\n     funding formula should not be altered.\n\n                                 84\n\fId. at 1453.\n\n     Line item appropriations fund specific activities and\n\nprograms offered at the public universities.       Capital\n\nimprovements and repair and renovation of existing facilities are\n\nfunded through a combination of line item appropriations and\n\nself-generated funds.   The district court found that line item\n\nfunding accounts for a “substantial” share of total state\n\nappropriations for institutions of higher education and\n\ncontributes “significantly” to the quality of any given\n\ninstitution.   Id. at 1451.\n\n     The district court found that, in general, line item funding\n\n“disproportionately flows to the HWIs.”    Id.     In the context of\n\ncapital improvements and repair and renovation, however, the\n\ncourt concluded that funding policies and practices do not follow\n\nthe mission assignments and are not traceable to de jure\n\nsegregation.   Id. at 1477.   Although the State provided new\n\nconstruction funds disproportionately to the HWIs during the late\n\n1960s, figures from 1970 through 1994 indicate that the HBIs\n\nreceived a percentage of capital improvements funds that exceeded\n\ntheir percentage of systemwide enrollment.       Id. at 1454.69\n\n     69\n        From 1970 through 1980, when the HBIs had approximately\n25% of the total systemwide enrollment, the HBIs received 39% of\nthe state appropriations for new construction. From 1981 until\n1994, the HBIs averaged 22% of systemwide enrollment yet obtained\n32% of total funding available for capital improvements. Ayers\nII, 879 F. Supp. at 1454; see also Ayers I, 674 F. Supp. at 1548-\n49.\n\n     We note that these findings appear to conflict with evidence\ncredited by the district court that no HBI received a line item\nappropriation until 1993. See Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1451.\n\n                                 85\n\f     The district court made distinct findings with respect to\n\nlibrary allocations and equipment availability.      The court found\n\nthat the library collections of the HWIs have been consistently\n\nsuperior to those of the HBIs for the past 40 years, and that the\n\nphysical space of the HBIs’ libraries is “of a lesser quality\n\noverall” than that of the HWIs’ libraries.       Id. at 1456-57.   The\n\ncourt likewise found that investment in equipment at the HWIs\n\nexceeded that provided to the HBIs during the de jure era and\n\nthat, currently, the quality of fixed equipment at the HBIs is\n\ninferior to that at the HWIs.     Id. at 1457.   The court concluded\n\nthat “[p]olicies and practices governing equipment availability\n\nand library allocations follow the mission assignments and, to\n\nthat degree, are traceable to de jure segregation.”       Id. at 1477.\n\n     As to the present segregative effects of library and\n\nequipment funding policies, the district court found generally\n\nthat “[t]he nature and condition of facilities of a campus are\n\nfactors that influence student choice in deciding where to attend\n\ncollege.”    Id. at 1457.   With respect to equipment in particular,\n\nthe court found that “[t]he quality and type of equipment\n\navailable on a campus is important from the student’s standpoint\n\nin terms of adequately preparing the student to enter the job\n\nmarket.”    Id.   As to libraries, the court recognized that, as\n\npart of an institution’s image, the library “plays a part in the\n\nrecruitment of students and faculty,” id. at 1456, but also found\n\n\nNo party, however, challenges either finding, and resolution of\nthis apparent discrepancy is not essential to our ruling on the\nissue of funding.\n\n                                  86\n\fthat “the number of books in the library is [not] a significant\n\nfeature of a university that influences student choice of where\n\nto attend.”    Id. at 1457.   In light of these findings, the court\n\nultimately concluded that “increasing the size of the HBIs’\n\nlibraries beyond that consistent with their missions is not\n\neducationally sound.”    Id. at 1458.   The court found it\n\nsignificant that the libraries at Alcorn State and Jackson State\n\nare presently undergoing expansion.     Id.70\n\n     The remedial decree orders the State to provide special\n\nfunds to both Jackson State and Alcorn State in addition to the\n\nfunds necessary for the programmatic additions outlined\n\nearlier.71    At Jackson State, the State is to provide, per Board\n\nproposal over a five-year period, up to $15 million earmarked for\n\nproperty acquisition, campus entrances, campus security, and\n\ngrounds enhancement.    For the benefit of Jackson State and Alcorn\n\nState, respectively, the State is to establish two $5 million\n\nendowment trusts, “with the income therefrom to be used to\n\nprovide funds for continuing educational enhancement and racial\n\ndiversity, including recruitment of white students and\n\nscholarships for white applicants in a number and an amount\n\n\n     70\n         The court found that the State legislature had recently\napproved a $12 million expansion of the library at Jackson State,\nalready underway at the time of the district court’s opinion.\nExpansion of the library at Alcorn State was also underway, with\n$3 million having already been invested. Ayers II, 879 F. Supp.\nat 1457.\n     71\n        The decree contains a general provision that orders the\nState to provide funding for all measures ordered therein. Ayers\nII, 879 F. Supp. at 1496.\n\n                                  87\n\fdetermined by the court upon recommendation from the Monitoring\n\nCommittee.”    Id. at 1495.72\n\n          b.     Arguments on appeal\n\n     Plaintiffs argue that the district court misapplied Fordice\n\nin concluding that “[t]here is no per se funding policy or\n\npractice traceable to the de jure era.”      Plaintiffs contend that\n\ndisparities in current funding are traceable to the de jure\n\nsystem, have discriminatory effects, and should be reformed to\n\nthe extent practicable and consistent with sound educational\n\npractices.\n\n     Plaintiffs also contend that the district court erred by\n\nfailing to consider adjustments to the funding formula to take\n\ninto account student financial need and the higher costs of\n\nremedial education, “or increases in funding to the [HBIs] to aid\n\nthem in overcoming the cumulative effects of decades of\n\nunderfunding.”    U.S. Br. at 44.73    Plaintiffs specifically\n\nrequest funding to enhance existing facilities, including\n\n     72\n        The court found that “the endowment for JSU . . . and\nthe funds proposed to be set aside to purchase adjoining land are\nsound steps toward correcting JSU’s image.” Ayers II, 879 F.\nSupp. at 1485. Likewise, the court found that “the proposed\nfunding for the small farm development center and the proposed\nendowment . . . promise realistically to solve ASU’s other-race\npresence problems and is [sic] otherwise educationally sound.”\nId. at 1486.\n     73\n        Plaintiffs suggest in their briefs that the district\ncourt erroneously focused solely on achieving funding “equity”\nbetween the HBIs and the HWIs. While the district court found\nthat “[a]ttainment of funding ‘equity’ between the HBIs and HWIs\nis impractical and educationally unsound,” Ayers II, 879 F. Supp.\nat 1453, the court did not purport to rely exclusively on this\nfinding for its determination that “the funding formula should\nnot be altered.” Id.\n\n                                  88\n\flibraries and equipment, at the HBIs.74\n\n     Defendants contend that the district court correctly found\n\nthat no current funding policy is traceable to de jure\n\nsegregation.   Moreover, defendants argue that the dedication of\n\nfunds for general institutional enhancement does not contribute\n\nto the desegregation of historically black institutions.\n\n          c.    Analysis\n\n     We find the district court’s ruling to be supported by the\n\nrecord and consistent with Fordice.   Fordice required the\n\ndistrict court to examine challenged policies and practices to\n\ndetermine if they had roots in the de jure era.   The district\n\ncourt correctly focused on the traceability of policies and\n\npractices that result in funding disparities rather than the\n\ntraceability of the disparities themselves, as plaintiffs urge.\n\n     The district court did not clearly err in finding that the\n\nfunding formula itself is not traceable to de jure segregation.\n\nUnlike the previous formula, which allocated funds based on\n\nmission designations, the present formula allocates funds as a\n\nfunction of the size of each institution’s enrollment, faculty,\n\nand physical plant.   While the formula responds to conditions\n\nthat to a significant degree have resulted from the mission\n\ndesignations (and consequently results in the HWIs receiving a\n\n     74\n        Plaintiffs request funding to develop and support new or\ntransferred programs and to enhance existing programs. Their\narguments relating to programs have been addressed in Parts\nIII.B.2 and III.B.3 supra. Plaintiffs also suggest that funding\nincreases at the HBIs could provide resources to hire new faculty\nor increase the pay of existing faculty. Arguments related to\nfaculty hiring and salaries are addressed in Part III.C infra.\n\n                                89\n\fgreater proportion of funds), the manner in which the formula\n\ndoes so is guided by valid educational concerns and is not linked\n\nto any prior discriminatory practice.\n\n     Plaintiffs argue that the district court should have\n\nconsidered adjustments to the funding formula in two respects,\n\nneither of which has merit.   First, plaintiffs argue that the\n\nformula should be adjusted for the higher cost of remedial\n\neducation, citing evidence that a disproportionately high number\n\nof black students in Mississippi are underprepared for college\n\nand that such an adjustment would encourage the HWIs to provide\n\nremedial courses and to attract black students and would aid the\n\nHBIs in providing the remedial instruction needed by their\n\nstudents.   Plaintiffs have not, however, identified any traceable\n\npolicy related to the funding of remedial education, nor have\n\nthey identified any record evidence that remedial education as\n\nstructured under the remedial decree is or is likely to be\n\nunderfunded; the decree itself requires the State to provide\n\nfunding for the summer program.    If, after examination of the\n\nresults of the summer program implementation, the district court\n\nfinds that the program needs to be modified or expanded, then the\n\ndistrict court should order appropriate funding at that time.75\n\nWe have also ordered the district court to reconsider paragraph 2\n\n\n     75\n        Private plaintiffs contend that because the funding\nformula does not provide additional funds to meet the needs of\nless adequately prepared students, the formula encourages HWI\n“disinterest” in using available exceptions to admissions. This\nargument is moot in light of our ruling on undergraduate\nadmissions standards.\n\n                                  90\n\fof the remedial decree insofar as it eliminates the remedial\n\ncourses previously offered at each of the eight universities.\n\nIf, after such reconsideration, the district court concludes that\n\nany or all of these courses should be reinstated, then it should\n\norder appropriate funding.\n\n     Second, plaintiffs argue that the funding formula should be\n\nadjusted to take into account the proportion of students at a\n\nuniversity who are in need of financial aid.   As it currently\n\noperates, the funding formula provides funds for scholarships and\n\nfellowships (which are only a portion of the total financial aid\n\navailable to students at each university) on the basis of each\n\nuniversity’s tuition income.76   The district court found that\n\nthis practice is neither unusual nor unique to Mississippi, but\n\nthat in Mississippi the universities that charge the highest\n\ntuition -- the three comprehensive HWIs -- also generally have\n\nthe largest proportion of students who have little or no need for\n\nfinancial assistance.   Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1451.   Again,\n\nhowever, plaintiffs have identified no traceable policy\n\n     76\n        According to evidence presented by the Board, the\n“scholarships and fellowships” component of the formula is\ndefined as follows:\n\n     Includes expenditures for scholarships and fellowships\n     in the form of outright grants to students selected by\n     the institution and financed from current funds,\n     restricted or unrestricted. It also should include\n     trainee stipends, prizes, and awards. The recipient of\n     an outright grant is not required to perform service to\n     the institution as consideration for the grant, nor is\n     he expected to repay the amount of the grant to the\n     funding source.\n\nBd. R-274.\n\n                                 91\n\fconcerning the adequacy of scholarship and fellowship funds\n\nprovided to the HBIs.   Any potential segregative effects of the\n\nfailure of the formula to take financial need into account is a\n\nfunction of the socioeconomic status of black applicants, not a\n\ntraceable policy of the de jure system.\n\n     Plaintiffs’ argument for general funds to enhance facilities\n\nis not supported by this record.     The district court found “no\n\npattern of inequity in funding in recent years for the HBIs as a\n\ngroup” with respect to facilities.     Id. at 1457.    The court’s\n\nfinding that funding for capital improvements and repair and\n\nrenovation disproportionately benefitted the HBIs during the\n\n1970s and 1980s is supported by the record, as is the court’s\n\nfinding that the inferior maintenance of the HBIs is not due to\n\nfunding inequities but may result from decisions at the HBIs to\n\nset aside operation and maintenance funds for other uses.       See\n\nid. at 1455, 1458.\n\n     As to library allocations, the district court’s finding that\n\nit would be educationally unsound to increase the size of the\n\nholdings of a university’s library beyond the scope of its\n\nmission is not clearly erroneous.     Funds for library acquisitions\n\nare provided through the academic support component of the\n\nfunding formula, and plaintiffs identify no evidence that this\n\nmethod of providing library funding is itself traceable to the de\n\njure system.\n\n     The court’s findings and conclusions concerning equipment\n\nfunding are more difficult for us to interpret.       The court found\n\n\n                                92\n\fthat the quality of fixed equipment, such as science lab\n\nfurnishings, at the HBIs is inferior to that at the HWIs.     Id. at\n\n1457.   Likewise, the court found that the technical and\n\nscientific equipment at the HWIs is “more advanced and generally\n\nin better condition than that of the HBIs.”   Id.   We are unable\n\nto determine based on this record, however, whether these\n\nequipment disparities implicate the funding formula, line item\n\nappropriations for capital improvements, or self-generated funds.\n\nNor are we able to determine the reasons for the disparities,\n\nwhich the district court opinion leaves unexplained.    The court’s\n\ndetermination that policies and practices governing equipment\n\navailability follow the mission assignments is perplexing in view\n\nof overlaps in the missions of the eight universities.     Each\n\nuniversity offers, for instance, undergraduate instruction.\n\nUndergraduate instruction in foreign languages, chemistry,\n\nbiology, or computing, to take a few examples, benefits from the\n\navailability of appropriate equipment.   Libraries likewise\n\nbenefit from the availability of modern technological equipment.\n\nThere is no apparent reason why the mission assignments, insofar\n\nas they relate to common university features such as these,\n\nshould result in disparities in equipment quality between the\n\nHBIs and the HWIs.   Put somewhat differently, if the different\n\nmission assignments are adduced as a reason for marked\n\ndisparities in equipment that is necessary or desirable for the\n\nundergraduate education that is provided at all eight\n\nuniversities, then they may indicate the existence of a policy or\n\n\n                                93\n\fpractice traceable to the de jure era that has present\n\nsegregative effects in that equipment quality may affect student\n\nchoice.   We therefore remand the issue of equipment funding to\n\nthe district court for further factfinding on the causes of the\n\ndisparities.    To the extent the disparities are attributable to\n\nthe mission assignments and have segregative effects that will be\n\nreduced by additional funding, relief may be in order.\n\n           d.    Conclusions regarding funding\n\n     We affirm the district court’s findings and conclusions\n\nregarding funding, except with regard to funding of equipment.\n\nWe remand the issue of equipment funding to the district court\n\nfor further factfinding on the cause and segregative effect of\n\nthe disparities, and, if necessary, the implementation of\n\nappropriate relief.\n\n\n\nC.   Employment of Black Faculty and Administrators\n\n     At both the 1987 and 1994 trials, plaintiffs challenged\n\ndefendants’ employment policies and practices on the ground that\n\nthey perpetuated segregation by resulting in racially\n\nidentifiable faculty and administrators at Mississippi’s public\n\ninstitutions of higher education and in race-based differences in\n\nfaculty rank, tenure, and salary.     Id. at 1459.   After hearing\n\nextensive testimony on remand, the district court found that no\n\ncurrent employment policies or practices are traceable to de jure\n\nsegregation.    Id. at 1477.\n\n     Plaintiffs contend on appeal that the dearth of black\n\n\n                                 94\n\ffaculty and administrators at the HWIs is traceable to the dual\n\nsystem and continues to have segregative effects by impeding the\n\nability of those institutions to recruit black students.    While\n\nnot challenging the district court’s finding that the HWIs have\n\nbeen making genuine efforts to recruit more black faculty and\n\nhave hired more black faculty than would be statistically\n\npredicted, plaintiffs nevertheless argue that this finding\n\naddresses only entry-level hiring and not the limited employment\n\nof blacks in tenured faculty and administrative positions.\n\nPlaintiffs therefore maintain that the district court was\n\nconstitutionally required to order the Board to increase efforts\n\nto hire and promote more black individuals to these levels.       In\n\naddition, plaintiffs contend that the district court should have\n\nordered relief with regard to the disparities in faculty salaries\n\nat the HBIs and HWIs.\n\n     Under the de jure system, no blacks served as faculty,\n\nadministrators, or managers at the HWIs.   Id. at 1459.    The\n\ndistrict court found during the initial trial in this case that\n\nMississippi has since adopted race-neutral hiring practices.       Id.\n\nAs the district court recognized, however, the inquiry on remand\n\nmust go beyond implementation of race-neutral practices and focus\n\n“upon the identification of remnants within the hiring process\n\nthat continue to foster segregation or the racial identifiability\n\nof the institutions of higher learning in Mississippi.”     Id.\n\n     Although the district court found that the HWIs remain\n\nracially identifiable at the level of administrators and tenured\n\n\n                               95\n\ffaculty,77 id. at 1462, it also found that since 1974 the HWIs\n\nhave hired more black faculty than would be expected based on a\n\nstatistical analysis of the qualified labor pool and national\n\nhiring demands.   Id. at 1461, 1463.   Mississippi’s HWIs compete\n\nwith other universities, particularly predominantly black\n\nuniversities, as well as business, industry, and government for\n\nthe relatively small number of blacks who earn doctorate degrees\n\neach year.78   Id. at 1461.   Under these circumstances, the\n\ndistrict court found that “[a]lthough the racial predominance of\n\nfaculty and administrators at the HWIs and the shortage of\n\nqualified black faculty are to some extent attributable to de\n\njure segregation, the HWIs are making sincere and serious efforts\n\nto increase the percentages of African-American faculty and\n\nadministrators at these institutions.”    Id. at 1463.\n\n     The relatively small number of blacks in tenured faculty and\n\nadministrative positions at the HWIs may be attributable at least\n\nin part to the de jure system, but racial identifiability at\n\nthese levels itself does not establish a constitutional\n\n\n     77\n        For the period 1986-92, 94% of the full professors at\nthe HWIs were white, and only 2% were black. For fiscal year\n1992, 98% of the administrators at the HWIs were white, and 2%\nblack. Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1460.\n     78\n        In 1991, for instance, blacks earned 3.8% of doctorates\nawarded to U.S. citizens nationwide. Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at\n1461. In general, only about 40% of black holders of doctorates\nearned in any given year move into academia. Id. The district\ncourt’s 1987 findings reflect a similar shortage of minority\nscholars; in addition, the district court found that out-of-state\ninstitutions are frequently able to use higher salaries to lure\nblack professors away from Mississippi universities after they\nhave gained experience. Ayers I, 674 F. Supp. at 1537-38.\n\n                                  96\n\fviolation.    See Fordice, 505 U.S. at 743.   As we noted earlier,\n\nFordice rejects the notion that the State must remedy all present\n\ndiscriminatory effects without regard to “whether such\n\nconsequences flow from policies rooted in the prior system.”       Id.\n\nat 730 n.4.   Plaintiffs identify no such policies with respect to\n\nselection of tenured faculty and administrators.79    The district\n\ncourt found, rather, that black doctorate holders are relatively\n\nfew and in high demand,80 that representation of blacks in the\n\nfaculty ranks of the HWIs exceeds reasonable expectations, and\n\nthat the HWIs actively employ a variety of measures to attract\n\nand retain qualified black faculty.    Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at\n\n1461-62.\n\n     79\n        With respect to administrative positions, private\nplaintiffs contend that the district court failed to consider\nevidence indicating that the Board approves all such hires, and\nin the case of at least three institutions the Board makes such\napprovals with knowledge of the race of the prospective\nemployees. Private plaintiffs link this practice with evidence\nthat in the history of the system, only nine black persons have\nserved at the level of dean or above at the HWIs, and with\ntestimony of black faculty members concerning unsuccessful\nefforts to secure administrative positions at MSU.\n\n     We find that the district court did not err by failing to\nfind a traceable practice on the basis of such evidence. Without\nmore, these facts are insufficient to establish that the Board\nmaintains a practice of discriminating against black candidates\nfor administrative openings; notably absent is any claim that the\nBoard refused to approve any qualified black candidates.\n     80\n        The district court did not link the limited number of\nblack doctorate holders with the dearth of high-level black\nadministrators. We note that there is record evidence to\nindicate that, to the extent that a terminal degree is a\nnecessary or desirable qualification for an administrative\nposition (as it may be, for example, in the case of an academic\ndean), the scarcity of black doctorate holders found by the\ndistrict court would adversely affect the number of high-level\nblack administrators.\n\n                                 97\n\f     The very low percentages of blacks holding either full\n\nprofessor status or administrative rank at the HWIs are indeed a\n\nsobering reflection of longstanding efforts to limit the\n\neducational opportunities of black citizens, not in Mississippi\n\nalone.   In view of the above findings, however, and combined with\n\nthe lack of evidence linking any present policies to the de jure\n\nsystem, we find no error in the district court’s ruling.    We\n\nconclude that the district court correctly applied the standards\n\narticulated in Fordice in determining that “[t]here is no current\n\npolicy or practice in a relevant sense that produces the shortage\n\nof available black faculty, nor can liability be based on prior\n\nexclusionary admissions policies and practices that reduced the\n\nqualified pool, in light of the State’s continuous substantial\n\naffirmative efforts to correct this imbalance.”     Id. at 1463.\n\n     With respect to disparities in faculty salaries, the\n\ndistrict court did not err in declining to order relief in light\n\nof its finding that such disparities reflect legitimate\n\ndifferences, keyed to discipline and rank, in average faculty\n\nsalaries at peer institutions in the region.     Id. at 1459.    The\n\ncourt found it significant, moreover, that, although funding for\n\nfaculty salaries is provided by the State under the formula, each\n\ninstitution has the autonomy to determine the number of faculty\n\npositions needed, their rank within the university, and the\n\ncompensation for that rank.   Id.    Finding no traceable policy,\n\nthe court properly declined to order relief.\n\n     We affirm the district court’s findings of fact and\n\n\n                                98\n\fconclusions of law on the subject of the defendants’ employment\n\npolicies and practices.\n\n\n\nD.   System Governance\n\n     Plaintiffs argued before the district court that vestiges of\n\nthe de jure system could be found with respect to the composition\n\nof the Board and its staff.   All institutions of higher learning\n\nin Mississippi have been governed by a single entity -- the Board\n\nof Trustees of State Institutions of Higher Learning -- since\n\n1932.   No black person served on the Board until 1972, and no\n\nblack person was appointed to serve as a professional staff\n\nmember until 1974.    Id. at 1473.    At present, the twelve members\n\nof the Board are appointed by the governor with the advice and\n\nconsent of the Mississippi senate.\n\n     The district court found no evidence of a current practice\n\nof denying or diluting the representation of black citizens on\n\nthe Board.   Id.   At the time of trial, the Board had three black\n\nmembers and its immediate past president was black.       Id.    Of the\n\nBoard’s 108 employees, 26 were black.      Id.   The district court\n\nnoted that black Board staff members hold professional positions\n\nof responsibility such as Assistant Commissioner for Academic\n\nAffairs and Associate Commissioner of Academic Affairs.         Id.\n\n     Private plaintiffs contend that the district court ignored\n\nevidence of Board selection practices that minimize the\n\nparticipation of black persons on the Board, as well as evidence\n\nof the Board’s practice of hiring blacks for only low-level\n\n\n                                 99\n\fpositions on staff.\n\n     With respect to Board composition, private plaintiffs cite\n\nevidence that from 1972 to 1992, only six out of 24 to 30 newly\n\nseated Board members were black.   We are unable to conclude on\n\nthe basis of this bare statistic that the district court clearly\n\nerred in finding no traceable policy or practice concerning Board\n\ncomposition.   After reviewing both the history of black persons’\n\nexclusion from the Board and the post-1972 role of black Board\n\nmembers, the district court found that “[t]he fact that blacks\n\nhave actively participated on the Board for more than twenty\n\nyears indicates that no current exclusionary policy exists.”      Id.\n\nAs with employment, numerical disparities alone do not establish\n\nliability for maintaining remnants of the prior dual system.\n\n     With respect to Board staff, private plaintiffs advance two\n\nrelated contentions.   First, they argue that the district court’s\n\nfindings regarding staffing totals are clearly erroneous.   After\n\nreviewing the record, we conclude that this argument is without\n\nmerit.81   Second, private plaintiffs argue that a significant\n\nmajority of staff positions held by blacks are in low-level job\n\ncategories.    This argument is unavailing for reasons similar to\n\nthose discussed above; private plaintiffs rely on employment\n\nfigures without regard to other information that might reveal a\n\n\n     81\n        Private plaintiffs argue that blacks held only 23 of a\ntotal of 105 staff positions in 1992. Private plaintiffs’ own\nexhibit, however, indicates that the district court did not err\nin its finding that blacks held 26 of 108 staff positions in that\nyear. Private plaintiffs offer no explanation in their briefs\nfor this disparity.\n\n                                 100\n\ftraceable practice with discriminatory effects, such as the\n\nrelevant pool of qualified candidates or the particulars of the\n\nappointment process.    Accordingly, we do not disturb the district\n\ncourt’s finding of no traceable policy or practice in the area of\n\nsystem governance.    We affirm the district court’s findings of\n\nfact and conclusions of law on the subject of system governance.\n\n\n\n                           IV. CONCLUSION\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court’s\n\nfindings of fact, conclusions of law, and remedial decree except\n\nas follows:\n\n          1.   In affirming the district court’s\n\n     implementation of the Board’s admissions standards, we\n\n     do not affirm the elimination of the remedial courses\n\n     previously offered at each of the eight universities.\n\n     We remand this issue for immediate reconsideration in\n\n     the light of this opinion.    If the district court\n\n     concludes that any or all of the previously offered\n\n     remedial courses should be reinstated, the same should\n\n     be implemented, with appropriate funding, to be\n\n     effective beginning with the academic year 1997-98.\n\n     The district court should provide findings of fact and\n\n     conclusions of law in support of its decision regarding\n\n     reinstatement.\n\n          2.   We reverse the district court’s finding that\n\n     the use of ACT cutoff scores as a criterion for the\n\n\n                                  101\n\faward of scholarships at the HWIs is not traceable to\n\nthe de jure system and does not currently foster\n\nsegregation.   We remand for determination of the\n\npracticability and educational soundness of reforming\n\nthis aspect of the undergraduate scholarship policies\n\nat the HWIs and the implementation, if necessary, of\n\nappropriate remedial relief to be effective beginning\n\nwith the academic year 1998-99.\n\n     3.   We direct the district court on remand to\n\nclarify the status of the Board’s proposal to merge\n\nMississippi Valley State with Delta State and, if the\n\ndistrict court confirms that merger will no longer be\n\npursued, to vacate paragraph 12 of the remedial decree\n\nand to incorporate into the remedial decree (a) a\n\nprovision directing the Board to study and to report to\n\nthe Monitoring Committee on new academic programs that\n\nhave a reasonable chance of increasing other-race\n\npresence at Mississippi Valley State and (b) a\n\nprovision requiring the Board to study and to report to\n\nthe Monitoring Committee on unnecessary program\n\nduplication between Mississippi Valley State and Delta\n\nState.\n\n     4.   We direct the district court on remand to\n\nincorporate into the remedial decree a provision\n\ndirecting the Board to study and report to the\n\nMonitoring Committee on new academic and land grant\n\n\n                           102\n\f     programs that have a reasonable chance of increasing\n\n     other-race presence at Alcorn State.\n\n          5.    On the issue of accreditation, the district\n\n     court should determine the status of current efforts to\n\n     achieve accreditation of existing business programs at\n\n     Jackson State and order appropriate relief, if\n\n     necessary, to ensure that the Board is taking steps\n\n     commensurate with its role in this accreditation\n\n     process.\n\n          6.    We remand the issue of equipment funding to\n\n     the district court for further factfinding on the cause\n\n     and segregative effect of the disparities, and, if\n\n     necessary, the implementation of appropriate relief.\n\n     We understand the district court’s continuing jurisdiction\n\nto encompass the evaluation of the effectiveness of the spring\n\nscreening and summer remedial program, as a component of the\n\nadmissions system, in achieving its intended objectives of\n\nidentifying and admitting those students who are capable, with\n\nreasonable remediation, of doing college level work but who fail\n\nto qualify for regular admission.      If the district court\n\nultimately concludes that this program (as it may be modified) is\n\nunable to any significant degree to achieve its objectives, then\n\nthe court should, if possible, identify and implement another\n\npracticable and educationally sound method for achieving those\n\nobjectives in sufficient time for the academic year 1999-2000.\n\nIf, after examination of the results of the summer program\n\n\n                                 103\n\fimplementation, the district court finds that the program needs\n\nto be modified or expanded, then the district court should order\n\nappropriate funding at that time.\n\n     Any further appeals shall be to this panel.\n\n     AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.   Each party shall bear\n\nits own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                               104\n\f",

After we heard the initial appeal of this case in\n\n1990, the Supreme Court established, for the first time, the\n\nstandards for determining in the university context whether a\n\nstate has met its affirmative obligation to dismantle its prior\n\nde jure system.   We now review the district court’s ruling\n\nfollowing trial on remand to determine whether it erred in its\n\napplication of these standards.\n\n     For the reasons set forth below, we affirm in part, reverse\n\nin part, and remand the case to the district court for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n                           I.

The Court stated that\n\n      even after a State dismantles its segregative\n      admissions policy, there may still be state action that\n      is traceable to the State’s prior de jure segregation\n      and that continues to foster segregation. . . . If\n      policies traceable to the de jure system are still in\n      force and have discriminatory effects, those policies\n      too must be reformed to the extent practicable and\n      consistent with sound educational practices.\n\nId. at 729.   Applying this standard, the Court identified\n\nadmissions standards, program duplication, institutional mission\n\nassignments, and continued operation of all eight public\n\nuniversities as a nonexclusive list of “constitutionally suspect”\n\nremnants of the prior de jure system, “for even though such\n\npolicies may be race neutral on their face, they substantially\n\nrestrict a person’s choice of which institution to enter, and\n\n                                  6\n\fthey contribute to the racial identifiability of the eight public\n\nuniversities.   Mississippi must justify these policies or\n\neliminate them.”   Id. at 733.   The Court directed that these and\n\n“each of the other policies now governing the State’s university\n\nsystem that have been challenged or that are challenged on\n\nremand” be examined “in light of the standard that we articulate\n\ntoday.”   Id.\n\n     On remand, the district court ordered each party to submit\n\nproposed remedies “to resolve the areas of the State’s liability\n\npursuant to the Supreme Court mandate.”   Without conceding\n\nliability, defendant Board of Trustees of State Institutions of\n\nHigher Learning (the “Board”)3 responded by presenting a detailed\n\nproposal for modification of the higher education system.     This\n\nproposal contained, among other provisions, uniform standards of\n\nadmission for all universities, as well as a plan to merge Delta\n\nState University and Mississippi Valley State University into one\n\ninstitution to serve students in the Mississippi Delta.4\n\n     The private plaintiffs and the United States (collectively,\n\n“plaintiffs”) responded by insisting that the range of\n\n\n     3\n         The Board is responsible for the management and control\nof the eight public universities at issue in this case.

Its general powers and duties\ninclude, inter alia, managing all university property, disbursing\nfunds, establishing standards for admission and graduation, and\nsupervising the functioning of each institution. See id. § 37-\n101-15.\n     4\n        The Board submitted its original proposal to the district\ncourt on October 22, 1992. The Board submitted a modified\nproposal shortly before trial. The proposed admissions standards\nand merger plan were contained in both.\n\n                                  7\n\fconstitutionally suspect policies and practices to be examined on\n\nremand had yet to be determined.5    Pursuant to a subsequent court\n\norder, plaintiffs identified the following policies and practices\n\nfor examination:   admissions standards that allegedly deny black\n\nstudents equal access to higher education and tend to channel\n\nblack students to the HBIs; the use of ACT scores as a basis for\n\nawarding undergraduate scholarships at the HWIs; maintenance of\n\ninstitutional mission assignments that largely follow historical\n\nracial designations; funding policies that disproportionately\n\nbenefit the HWIs; allocation of academic programs that is\n\nunfavorable to the HBIs; allocation of land grant programs\n\nbetween Alcorn State and Mississippi State that is unfavorable to\n\nAlcorn; duplication of the HBIs’ programs and course offerings at\n\nthe HWIs; maintenance of facilities at the HBIs that are inferior\n\nto those at the HWIs; employment practices that perpetuate the\n\nracial identifiability of the universities and compensate faculty\n\nat the HBIs at a lower rate than faculty at the HWIs; maintenance\n\nof all eight institutions; and practices that limit the\n\nparticipation of black persons in system governance.

Specific relief includes adoption of the uniform\n\nadmissions standards proposed by the Board and allocation of\n\nadditional resources to Jackson State University and Alcorn State\n\nUniversity.    The district court did not order implementation of\n\nthe Board’s proposal to consolidate Delta State University and\n\nMississippi Valley State University.   The decree establishes a\n\nMonitoring Committee to monitor implementation of the terms and\n\nobligations imposed by the decree.    The Monitoring Committee is\n\nto consist of three disinterested persons with experience in the\n\nfield of higher education, agreed upon by the parties and\n\n\n     6\n        In addition, the district court found that the practice\nof maintaining participation in racially identifiable athletic\nconferences is traceable to de jure segregation but does not have\nsegregative effects. Athletic programs are not an issue in this\nappeal.\n     7\n        The remedial decree is set forth in its entirety in the\nopinion below, Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1494-96.

Issues on appeal\n\nencompass undergraduate admissions standards, scholarship\n\ncriteria, enhancement of historically black universities, system\n\ngovernance, and employment.9   No party appeals the district\n\ncourt’s rejection of the Board’s consolidation proposal.\n\n\n\n                     II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n     The standard set forth by the Supreme Court in Fordice\n\nguides our review of the district court’s judgment.    Fordice\n\nestablished that “a State does not discharge its constitutional\n\nobligations until it eradicates policies and practices traceable\n\n\n     8\n        In an order entered on March 1, 1996, the district court\nstayed appointment of the Monitoring Committee, along with any\nreports required to be made to the Monitoring Committee, pending\ncompletion of “the appellate process.” We see no reason why the\nstay contemplated by the March 1 order should continue. We\nassume that the stay will be vacated and that the Monitoring\nCommittee will be activated promptly.\n     9\n        The scope of private plaintiffs’ argument on appeal is\nbroader in some respects than that of the United States, although\nthe two positions overlap considerably. We note distinctions\nwhere relevant.\n\n                                 10\n\fto its prior de jure dual system that continue to foster\n\nsegregation.”   505 U.S. at 728.    More specifically,\n\n     [i]f the State perpetuates policies and practices\n     traceable to its prior system that continue to have\n     segregative effects -- whether by influencing student\n     enrollment decisions or by fostering segregation in\n     other facets of the university system -- and such\n     policies are without sound educational justification\n     and can be practicably eliminated, the State has not\n     satisfied its burden of proving that it has dismantled\n     its prior system.\n\nId. at 731.   We have read Fordice to require that “each suspect\n\nstate policy or practice be analyzed to determine whether it is\n\ntraceable to the prior de jure system, whether it continues to\n\nfoster segregation, whether it lacks sound educational\n\njustification, and whether its elimination is practicable.”\n\nUnited States v. Louisiana, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6100\"><a href=\"/opinion/6100/united-states-v-state-of-la/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1159</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1164 (5th Cir. 1993).\n\nThe State’s liability depends upon these factors.        Id.10\n\n     Once liability is found, the offending policies and\n\npractices “must be reformed to the extent practicable and\n\nconsistent with sound educational practices.”     Fordice, 505 U.S.\n\nat 729.   “[S]urely the State may not leave in place policies\n\nrooted in its prior officially segregated system that serve to\n\nmaintain the racial identifiability of its universities if those\n\npolicies can practicably be eliminated without eroding sound\n\n     10\n        At this stage in a desegregation case, a state’s\n“liability” consists of its obligation to remedy remnants of a\nprior de jure system for which constitutional liability has\nalready been established. In Louisiana, we used the term\n“liability” in this sense of an affirmative obligation to remedy\nvestiges of the prior system. In the interest of consistency, we\ncontinue to use “liability” in this sense here, albeit with the\nunderstanding that the liability of the State of Mississippi, as\na threshold matter, stems from its operation of a de jure system.\n\n                                   11\n\feducational policies.”     Id. at 743.   Accordingly, we have\n\ninterpreted the directives of Fordice “as recognizing the need to\n\nconsider the practicability and soundness of educational\n\npractices in determining remedies as well as in making an initial\n\ndetermination of liability.”     Louisiana, 9 F.3d at 1164.\n\n     We apply the directives of Fordice in conjunction with\n\ngeneral standards of appellate review.     This appeal challenges\n\nelements of the district court’s remedial decree and implicates\n\nseveral of its findings and conclusions.      We do not disturb the\n\ndistrict court’s findings of fact unless they are clearly\n\nerroneous, although we freely reassess its conclusions of law\n\nunder the de novo standard of review.

DISCUSSION\n\nA.   Admissions Policies and Practices\n\n     1.   Background Facts\n\n     In 1961, less than one week after James Meredith applied to\n\nthe University of Mississippi, the Board adopted a policy\n\nrequiring all applicants for undergraduate admission to any state\n\n\n                                  12\n\finstitution of higher education to take the American College Test\n\n(“ACT”).   Ayers I, 674 F. Supp. at 1530-31.    Several months\n\nlater, the Board authorized each university to set a minimum ACT\n\nscore for eligibility for admission.   Id. at 1531.     By 1963, the\n\nUniversity of Mississippi, Mississippi State University, and the\n\nUniversity of Southern Mississippi required an ACT composite\n\nscore of at least 15 for all freshmen applicants.      Id.   At the\n\ntime, the average ACT score among white students was 18, while\n\nthat for black students was 7.   Fordice, 505 U.S. at 734.\n\n     When this case was tried initially in 1987, admissions\n\nstandards for first-time freshman varied along with the\n\nhistorical racial identifiability of each institution.       Four HWIs\n\ncontinued to require a composite score of at least 15 on the ACT\n\nfor automatic admission; the other HWI, Mississippi University\n\nfor Women, required a score of 15-17 together with a high school\n\ngrade point average of at least 3.0 on a 4.0 scale, or a score of\n\nat least 18.   Ayers I, 674 F. Supp. at 1533-34.     The HBIs\n\nrequired a minimum ACT composite score of 13.      Id. at 1534.11\n\n     Based on the undisturbed factual findings of the district\n\ncourt -- and unmoved by lower court determinations that the\n\nadmissions standards derived from policies enacted in the 1970s\n\nto redress the problem of student unpreparedness -- the Supreme\n\nCourt concluded in Fordice that the policies were traceable to\n\n     11\n        The HBIs maintained more liberal exceptions policies\nthan the HWIs, although no university could enroll a student with\nan ACT score below 9. See Ayers I, 674 F. Supp. at 1533-34.\n\n                                 13\n\fthe de jure system, were originally adopted for a discriminatory\n\npurpose, and continued to have discriminatory effects.        505 U.S.\n\nat 734.   The Court found that the minimum ACT requirements\n\n“restrict[ed] the range of choices of entering students as to\n\nwhich institution they may attend in a way that perpetuate[d]\n\nsegregation.”   Id.   Those students who received ACT scores too\n\nlow to meet the admissions requirements at the HWIs were\n\nrestricted to the HBIs or community colleges if they wanted a\n\nhigher education.     Id. at 734-35.   As the Court stated,\n\n“[p]roportionately more blacks than whites face[d] this choice:\n\nIn 1985, 72 percent of Mississippi’s white high school seniors\n\nachieved an ACT composite score of 15 or better, while less than\n\n30 percent of black high school seniors earned that score.”        Id.\n\nat 735.   The Court also deemed “constitutionally problematic” the\n\nfact that the State denied automatic admission if an applicant\n\ndid not achieve the minimum ACT score specified for a particular\n\ninstitution, without also considering high school grades as an\n\nadditional factor in predicting college performance.      Id. at\n\n736.12\n\n     Plaintiffs’ challenges on remand included the use of\n\ndifferential ACT-based admissions policies at the HWIs and HBIs,\n\nas well as the use of ACT cutoff scores and alumni connection in\n\n\n     12\n        The Court found significant the fact that the disparity\nbetween black and white students’ grade averages was much\nnarrower than the gap between their average ACT scores,\nsuggesting that an admissions formula that included grades would\nincrease the number of black students eligible for automatic\nuniversity admission.

Undergraduate Admissions Standards\n\n           a.   District court ruling\n\n     The district court concluded that “[u]ndergraduate\n\nadmissions policies and practices are vestiges of de jure\n\nsegregation that continue to have segregative effects.”     Ayers\n\nII, 879 F. Supp. at 1477.   More specifically, the court found\n\nthat the admissions standards in place at the time of the 1987\n\ntrial were traceable to the prior de jure system and continued to\n\nhave segregative effects in a system where racially identifiable\n\ninstitutions offer numerous duplicative academic programs.       Id.\n\nat 1434.   The court held that defendants had a duty to eradicate\n\nuse of the ACT cutoff score “as a sole criterion for admission to\n\nthe system when the ACT is used in conjunction with differing\n\nadmissions standards between the HBIs and HWIs.”   Id.14\n\n     13\n        Plaintiffs also challenged policies and practices\npertaining to admissions exceptions. The district court’s\nfinding that no such policies or practices are traceable to the\nde jure system is not contested on appeal.\n     14\n        The court did not rule that use of an ACT cutoff is per\nse unlawful. “Rather, its particular use in any circumstance\nmust be examined to consider whether as a component of the policy\nchallenged, the same is traceable to prior de jure segregation.”\nAyers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1434.\n\n     Significantly, despite plaintiffs’ claims that the addition\nof ACT scores to high school grades as a predictor of freshman\ngrades improves the prediction only marginally, the district\ncourt concluded that the ACT was “a sound component of the\nadmissions decision for the reason that the ACT, in combination\nwith high school grades, remains a better predictor of academic\n\n                                15\n\f     Although admissions standards had been modified somewhat by\n\nthe time of the trial on remand, the district court found that\n\nthey “basically utilized a version of the 1987 standards with\n\nvarious exceptions.”   Id. at 1431.   In 1989, the ACT was replaced\n\nby the Enhanced ACT.   Id. at 1430.   Scores on the two tests are\n\nnot equivalent; the American College Testing Program accordingly\n\npublishes concordance tables that correlate scores on the old ACT\n\nand Enhanced ACT according to percentile rank.15     The\n\nintroduction of the Enhanced ACT prompted the Board to solicit\n\nrecommendations from the eight universities for revised\n\nadmissions standards based on the new test.    Each HWI recommended\n\nuse of an Enhanced ACT score of 18 for regular admission, which\n\napproximated the previous standard of an ACT score of 15.     Each\n\nHBI recommended use of an Enhanced ACT score of 15 for regular\n\nadmission, the concordant value of which was 11 on the old ACT.\n\nBecause the HBIs had previously required an ACT score of at least\n\n13 for regular admission, this recommendation represented an\n\neffective lowering of admissions standards at these\n\ninstitutions.16   Throughout the system, students not qualifying\n\n\nperformance than either criterion alone.”     Id. at 1482.   This\nconclusion is supported by the record.\n     15\n        An ACT score of 15, for instance, has a concordant value\nof 18 on the Enhanced ACT, meaning that a score of 15 on the ACT\nwould be in the same percentile ranking as a score of 18 on the\nEnhanced ACT.\n     16\n        Private plaintiffs quarrel with the district court’s\ncharacterization of the change in the admissions standard at the\nHBIs as a “lowering,” arguing that, viewed in historical context,\nthis change merely restored some of the access that had been\nforeclosed by an earlier increase in minimum ACT requirements.\n\n                                 16\n\ffor regular admission could be admitted as “high risk”\n\nexceptions.    The recommended Enhanced ACT scores for high risk\n\napplicants ranged from 14 to 17 at the HWIs, and from 12 to 14 at\n\nthe HBIs.    The Board approved all recommendations.17\n\nDifferential admissions standards thus persisted in the system\n\nthrough the 1994 trial and, as found by the district court,\n\n“resulted in the ‘channeling effect’ described in Fordice.”    Id.\n\nat 1434.    The district court’s remedial order responded to the\n\nstandards in place in 1994.18\n\n     Defendants proposed, and the district court ordered\n\nimplementation of, new admissions criteria that standardize\n\nrequirements at all eight universities beginning with\n\napplications for admission in the fall of 1996.    The new criteria\n\n\nWe review the district court’s ruling against this backdrop and\nin light of evidence concerning educational soundness.\n     17\n        The district court noted that although the lower ACT\nrequirements at the HBIs were originally proposed by the HBI\npresidents, “it is the Board’s responsibility to manage the\nhigher education system in accordance with constitutional\nprinciples.” Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1434.\n     18\n        While it found that admissions policies continued to\nhave segregative effects, the district court also found that\n“there is no per se policy or practice of minimizing the\nparticipation of African-Americans in the [higher education]\nsystem.” Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1435. The court found\ncredible evidence indicating that defendants had made substantial\nprogress toward increasing minority access to higher education.\nSee id. at 1433, 1435. In Mississippi, the ratio of the State’s\nshare of the nation’s black enrollment in public four-year\ninstitutions to its share of the nation’s black population is\nmore favorable than the national mean and that of many non de\njure states. See id. at 1435. Private plaintiffs appear to\ncontend that the district court’s finding of no current per se\npolicy of limiting access to the higher education system is\nclearly erroneous. We conclude that any such contention is\nwithout merit.\n\n                                 17\n\fgrant “regular admission”19 to applicants who have (1) a GPA of\n\nat least 3.20 in a designated core curriculum, (2) a GPA of at\n\nleast 2.50 in the core curriculum or class rank in the top 50%\n\nand an Enhanced ACT score of at least 16, or (3) a GPA of at\n\nleast 2.0 in the core curriculum and an Enhanced ACT score of at\n\nleast 18.    Id. at 1477-78.\n\n     The admissions policy ordered by the district court provides\n\nan important alternative to regular admission through a spring\n\nscreening and summer remedial program for applicants who do not\n\nmeet the requirements for regular admission.   Students\n\nparticipating in the spring screening process will take the\n\nMississippi College Placement Examination (the “accuplacer”)\n\nduring the spring of their senior year in high school.    Based\n\nupon these scores, Enhanced ACT subtest scores, and counselor\n\ninterviews, students will either be admitted for the fall\n\nsemester or invited to participate in the summer remedial\n\nprogram.20   The summer program is designed to provide ten to\n\neleven weeks of remedial instruction in reading, writing, and\n\nmathematics, taught both in traditional classroom settings and\n\n\n     19\n        “Regular admission” is the term used throughout the\ndistrict court opinion, and will be used herein, to denote\nautomatic admission based on the criteria listed in the text, as\ndistinguished from admission via the spring screening and summer\nremedial program, discussed infra. See Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at\n1477-78 & n.297.\n     20\n         It appears, based on the language of the Board’s\nproposal and testimony during trial, that some applicants who\nparticipate in spring screening may not be admitted to the summer\nremedial program and will be advised to pursue other educational\noptions.\n\n                                 18\n\fthrough computer-assisted individual components.     Id. at 1478.\n\nIn addition, the program plan incorporates cultural and\n\nrecreational activities to “climatize” students to the college\n\ncampus.    Id.21   Those students who successfully complete the\n\nsummer program, by passing at minimum the remedial English and\n\nmathematics courses, will be admitted in the fall.\n\n     The district court found that “the new admissions standards\n\nthrough their uniformity will eliminate the prior segregative\n\neffects of the previous differential admissions standards between\n\nthe HBIs and HWIs, noted by the Supreme Court in Fordice.”        Id.\n\nat 1481.    The district court found that as compared with the\n\nstandards litigated in the 1987 trial, the new standards would\n\nresult in an overall increase in the number of black students\n\neligible for regular admission to the university system.22        As\n\n     21\n        Although the district court made no specific findings in\nthis regard, the undisputed evidence indicates that the summer\nremedial program is a departure from past remedial practices\nwithin the university system. Prior to the district court’s\norder, full semester remedial courses were offered at each\nuniversity. Although students who are granted admission via the\nsummer program must participate in a year-long academic support\nprogram designed to provide individualized support for marginally\nprepared students enrolled in regular academic credit courses,\napparently many of the remedial courses previously offered during\nthe academic year are to be eliminated under the new plan. See\nPart III.B.2.c.iii infra.\n     22\n           The new standards were predicted to have the following\nimpact:\n\n     (a) the pool of black students eligible for regular\n     admission to a public HWI will increase from\n     approximately 32.4% to 52.5%; (b) the pool of black\n     students eligible for regular admission at the HBIs in\n     1995 will be increased from approximately 45.3% to\n     52.5%; (c) the pool of black students eligible for\n     admission to the system as a whole will also increase\n\n                                   19\n\fcompared with the standards in place at the time of the 1994\n\ntrial, which were less stringent than in 1987 as a result of the\n\n1989 changes in requirements at the HBIs, the new standards would\n\nresult in an overall decline in the percentage of black students\n\neligible for regular admission to the system.23    The district\n\ncourt noted, however, that the summer program offers a distinct\n\nopportunity for applicants to gain admission.     Id. at 1479.24\n\nThe court found the summer program to be “credible and\n\neducationally advanced.   In its proposed form, it is considered\n\nby its developers as an educationally sound developmental\n\nsystem.”   Id. at 1481.   The district court concluded that\n\n           [w]hile the new admissions standards may reduce\n      the number of black students eligible to be admitted to\n      the system without remedial courses required, it is not\n      evident that the new standards will actually reduce the\n      number of black students ultimately admitted to the\n      system as either regular or remediated admittees.\n\nId.\n\n      Finally, although the State’s community college system is\n\n\n\n      under the proposed 1995 standards as compared with the\n      1987 standards.\n\nAyers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1479.\n      23\n        While 68.2% of black high school graduates who took the\nACT were eligible for regular admission to some university in the\nsystem at the time of the 1994 trial, the new standards were\nprojected to reduce this figure to 52.5% or 50.7%. Ayers II, 879\nF. Supp. at 1479.\n      24\n        The district court stated this finding in terms of the\n“summer program” only. We note that, as described by the\ndistrict court and in the record, the spring screening program\ncan lead to admission for the fall semester without participation\nin the summer remedial program. See Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at\n1478.\n\n                                  20\n\fthe subject of a separate lawsuit, the district court made\n\nfindings and ordered relief in this regard because the community\n\ncollege system is relevant to the issue of access to higher\n\neducation.     The court found evidence that the community college\n\nsystem “can have an impact on the admissions policies of the\n\nuniversities and their ability to further diversify institutions\n\nof higher learning.”      Id. at 1475.   The court also found,\n\nhowever, that the community college system in Mississippi is not\n\nproviding remediation for students unprepared for four-year\n\ninstitutions “to any great degree.”       Id.    The district court\n\napparently linked this to at least two factors.         First, in\n\ncontrast to the open admissions policy that prevailed at all\n\ncommunity colleges when this case was tried in 1987, some\n\ncommunity colleges now require minimum ACT scores for admission\n\nto certain programs.      Id. at 1474-75.25     Second, the\n\n“overwhelming majority” of students who start at the community\n\ncollege level do not transfer to four-year universities.            Id. at\n\n1475.     The University of Southern Mississippi has the highest\n\nproportion of transfer students in its student body, largely\n\nattributable to its recruiting efforts and articulation\n\nagreements with several community colleges in surrounding\n\nregions.     Id.   Black students transfer at a significantly lower\n\n\n     25\n         The use of ACT cutoffs for admission to community\ncolleges is not an issue in this case, and the district court did\nnot make findings or conclusions with respect to the\nconstitutionality of this practice. Accordingly, we do not\naddress this aspect of the community college system in our\nopinion.\n\n                                   21\n\frate than whites, possibly because a high percentage of black\n\nstudents in community colleges are enrolled in two-year\n\nvocational programs.\n\n     The district court concluded that the State “is losing a\n\nvaluable resource in not coordinating the admissions requirements\n\nand remedial programs between the community colleges and the\n\nuniversities.”     Id.   The remedial decree contains a provision\n\nordering the Board “to study the feasibility of establishing\n\nsystem-wide coordination of the community colleges in the State\n\nin the areas of admissions standards and articulation\n\nprocedures,” and to report its findings to the Monitoring\n\nCommittee.     Id. at 1496.\n\n          b.      Arguments on appeal\n\n     The district court’s finding that undergraduate admissions\n\npolicies and practices are vestiges of de jure segregation that\n\ncontinue to have segregative effects is not contested on appeal.\n\nPlaintiffs do contest the remedy thereupon ordered.\n\n     Plaintiffs’ challenge to the admissions remedy has two\n\nparts.   First, plaintiffs argue that the district court’s\n\nadoption of the Board’s proposed standards was improper because\n\nthese standards will significantly reduce the number of black\n\nstudents eligible for regular admission to the university system,\n\nand thereby disproportionately burden black students with a loss\n\nof educational opportunity.     Plaintiffs assert that the district\n\ncourt was obligated by Fordice to consider the educational\n\nsoundness of alternative proposals that would have excluded fewer\n\n\n                                   22\n\fblack students, but failed to do so.\n\n     Second, plaintiffs argue that the district court’s reliance\n\non the spring screening and summer remedial program to compensate\n\nfor the projected decline in regular admission of black students\n\nwas inappropriate because the program was untested and\n\nincompletely defined at the time of trial.   Plaintiffs contend\n\nthat although the district court found the summer program to be\n\n“credible and educationally advanced,” it did not specifically\n\nfind that the program would be an effective means of identifying\n\nstudents capable of succeeding in college or that it could\n\nachieve the same results as “existing remedial programs.”26    In\n\naddition, plaintiffs argue that the summer program is not a\n\nviable option for the many black students who must work during\n\nthe summer in order to afford to go to college in the fall, and\n\nthat the community college system currently does not provide an\n\nadequate alternative.   Plaintiffs therefore argue that the Board\n\nshould be required to maintain existing remedial courses and to\n\nadopt standards that minimize any reduction in the number of\n\nblack students eligible for admission, at least during the period\n\nthat the summer program is being tested and the community college\n\n\n     26\n        We understand “existing remedial programs” to mean the\nvarious combinations of remedial, or basic skills, courses and\nother forms of educational assistance, such as tutoring and\ncounseling, that have been offered by the eight universities. In\nthis record, “remedial education” and “remediation” are to some\ndegree used interchangeably with “developmental education” and\n“developmental studies.” We use the term “remedial programs” to\nrefer to the entire range of such educational assistance, and the\nterm “remedial courses” to refer to courses that teach basic,\npre-college skills.\n\n                                23\n\fsystem undergoing change.\n\n     Although their criticisms of the new admissions standards\n\ncoincide, private plaintiffs and the United States advocate\n\ndifferent admissions policies as alternatives.   Private\n\nplaintiffs proposed below and re-urge here adoption of a tiered\n\nadmissions policy, in which admissions requirements vary along\n\nwith the mission of each university,27 with the most accessible\n\ntier having “open admissions.”   By “open admissions,” private\n\nplaintiffs mean a policy of granting admission to students with a\n\nhigh school diploma and ACT score of 10.    Id. at 1480.    Under\n\nprivate plaintiffs’ proposal, the three comprehensive\n\nuniversities would use the admissions standards proposed by the\n\nBoard, and Jackson State University would have open admissions\n\nfor eight years with the option thereafter of gradually raising\n\nadmissions standards to the level prevailing at the comprehensive\n\nuniversities.   Id.   Existing remedial programs would be\n\nstrengthened in this scheme.\n\n     The United States proposed below and re-urges here an\n\nadmissions policy, which was presented to the Board in 1992 but\n\n\n     27\n        The eight universities are grouped into three classes\naccording to their programmatic mission. University of\nMississippi, University of Southern Mississippi, and Mississippi\nState University are “comprehensive” universities, which offer\nthe greatest range and highest level of degree programs. Jackson\nState University has an “urban” mission to serve the urban\ncommunity of Jackson, Mississippi, in which it is located.\nAlcorn State University, Delta State University, Mississippi\nUniversity for Women, and Mississippi Valley State University are\n“regional” universities that focus primarily on undergraduate\neducation. In private plaintiffs’ framework, the regional\nuniversities would constitute the most accessible tier.\n\n                                 24\n\fnever adopted, in which regular admission would be granted to\n\nstudents achieving (1) a 2.0 GPA in the core curriculum and a\n\nminimum of 16 on the Enhanced ACT or (2) a 2.50 GPA in the core,\n\na ranking in the top 50% of the class, and a minimum of 13 on the\n\nEnhanced ACT.28   The United States contends that under this\n\nstandard, an estimated 73.6% of black students who took the ACT\n\nwould qualify for admission, as compared to 52.5% or 50.7% under\n\nthe proposal adopted by the district court.   The United States\n\nstates that “ACT predictive data indicate that, at the [HBIs],\n\nwhere remedial instruction was given, freshmen with these\n\nqualifications could be expected to achieve at least a C\n\naverage.”    U.S. Br. at 12.\n\n     Defendants argue that the new admissions criteria wholly\n\neliminate prior policies traceable to de jure segregation.\n\nDefendants contend that the new admissions standards sufficiently\n\naddress the concerns articulated in Fordice because they do not\n\ndifferentiate between universities according to historical racial\n\ndesignation and do not rely on the ACT as the sole criterion for\n\nadmission.    Defendants argue that under Fordice, the traceable\n\nadmissions policy was the Board’s particular use of differential\n\nACT cutoff scores, which effectively channeled black students to\n\nthe HBIs, and not use of the ACT per se.   Accordingly, defendants\n\ncontend that the new policy is not traceable to the prior de jure\n\n\n     28\n        The district court noted that the United States “has\nalso suggested adoption of a 2.5 overall GPA for admission to all\nuniversities.” Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1480. The United\nStates does not urge this standard on appeal.\n\n                                 25\n\fsystem and may be implemented because the record discloses that\n\nit is educationally sound and was not adopted for a\n\ndiscriminatory purpose.     While defendants maintain that Fordice\n\ndoes not require the district court to select the educationally\n\nsound alternative with the least discriminatory effect, they\n\nargue that even if the district court did have such an\n\nobligation, its findings regarding the segregative effect and\n\neducational soundness of the new admissions standards effectively\n\ndischarged it.\n\n            c.   Analysis\n\n     The district court’s findings that the new criteria for\n\nadmission are educationally sound and will not perpetuate\n\nsegregation within the system are not challenged on appeal.\n\nPlaintiffs contend, rather, that the district court erred by\n\nfailing to consider the educational soundness of proposals that\n\nwould have resulted in a smaller reduction in the number of black\n\nstudents excluded from regular admission.\n\n     We agree with plaintiffs that it would be inappropriate to\n\nremedy the traceable, segregative effects of an admissions policy\n\nin a system originally designed to limit educational opportunity\n\nfor black citizens by adopting a policy that itself caused a\n\nreduction in meaningful educational opportunity for black\n\ncitizens.    We do not, however, understand the district court to\n\nhave done so.    The district court considered and rejected\n\nalternative proposals as educationally unsound, and expressly\n\ncontemplated that the remedial route to admission could alleviate\n\n\n                                  26\n\fany potential disproportionate impact on those black students who\n\nare capable, with reasonable remediation,29 of doing college\n\nlevel work.\n\n     We understand the district court to have determined, in the\n\nspecific context of formulating an appropriate remedial decree in\n\nthis case under Fordice, that access to higher education must be\n\nprovided only to those applicants who can demonstrate, based on\n\neducationally sound and constitutionally permissible indicators,\n\nan ability (with reasonable remediation) to do college level work\n\nand who therefore have a real prospect of earning a degree.30\n\nThe court found that admission of students unprepared to do\n\ncollege level work may result in significant attrition\n\naccompanied by unprofitable debt accumulation.   Ayers II, 879 F.\n\nSupp. at 1435.31   Fordice does not require that all students who\n\n     29\n        The record reflects that each of the universities at\nissue here has for many years recognized that remediation is\nappropriate to enable certain students successfully to complete a\ncollege education. The amount of remediation that has been\nprovided has varied among the universities. We recognize that\nhow much remediation is appropriate or “reasonable” is informed\nby concepts of practicability and educational soundness.\n     30\n        All Mississippi universities at issue here require\nstudents to achieve at least a C average in order to graduate.\nIndeed, as indicated in our discussion below, all parties key\ntheir arguments regarding the educational soundness of\nalternative admissions proposals to this standard.\n     31\n        The court found that Louisiana institutions, which\nmaintain open admissions, “suffer from a very high attrition rate\nresulting in students owing one, two or three years of college\nexpenses and having little or nothing to show for it.” Ayers II,\n879 F. Supp. at 1435. Defendants’ expert, Dr. James Wharton,\ntestified that access to four-year institutions in Louisiana is\n“not meaningful access because we also have tremendous attrition\nand students get hurt in that attrition.” Likewise, Dr. Hunter\nBoylan testified that “[a]ccess without an opportunity to succeed\n\n                                 27\n\fwould have been admitted under the prior, unconstitutional\n\nadmissions standards be admitted under the reformed admissions\n\nstandards without regard to the educational soundness of the\n\nreformed standards.    Instead, the district court’s mandate under\n\nFordice was limited to reforming traceable, segregative policies\n\n“to the extent practicable and consistent with sound educational\n\npractices.”   505 U.S. at 729.32   Having found admissions policies\n\nand practices to be traceable to the de jure system and to have\n\npresent segregative effects, the district court properly focused\n\nits consideration of alternative admissions policies on their\n\neducational soundness and potential to eliminate existing\n\nsegregative effects; its focus, in turn, on ability to do college\n\nlevel work is consistent with both the evidence as presented by\n\nplaintiffs and Fordice.\n\n                i.     Rejection of plaintiffs’ proposals\n\n\nisn’t really access.    If you have an open door it quickly becomes\na revolving door.”\n     32\n        The Court in Fordice declined to adopt a standard that\nwould require the State to eliminate insofar as practicable all\npresent discriminatory effects of the prior system:\n\n     To the extent we understand private petitioners to urge\n     us to focus on present discriminatory effects without\n     addressing whether such consequences flow from policies\n     rooted in the prior system, we reject this position.\n     . . . Though they seem to disavow as radical a remedy\n     as student reassignment in the university setting,\n     their focus on “student enrollment, faculty and staff\n     employment patterns, [and] black citizens’ college-\n     going and degree-granting rates” would seemingly compel\n     remedies akin to those upheld in Green v. School Bd. of\n     New Kent County were we to adopt their legal standard.\n\n505 U.S. at 730 n.4 (citations omitted) (second alteration in\noriginal); see also id. at 732 n.6.\n\n                                   28\n\f     The district court set forth in detail the respective\n\nadmissions standards proposed by private plaintiffs and the\n\nUnited States.    See Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1479-80.    Although\n\nthe district court credited expert testimony indicating that\n\ndifferential or tiered admissions standards are both sound and\n\nroutinely used, id. at 1482, it did not adopt private plaintiffs’\n\nproposal in light of its finding that the open admissions\n\ncomponent of this proposal was educationally unsound.      Id. at\n\n1481-82.   The district court found that\n\n     universities across the nation generally are moving\n     toward higher admissions requirements, not lower ones.\n     According to the testimony, students in working toward\n     goals will usually do that which is expected of them.\n     If they believe they need not prepare themselves for\n     college by taking the core curriculum in high school,\n     they will not do so. Such unpreparedness may bring\n     them to college campuses unable to execute the rigors\n     of college work and result in low retention rates,\n     college debt accumulations and years expended with no\n     degrees. . . . It has also been shown that institutions\n     of higher learning which open their doors to unprepared\n     students via open admissions not only do a disservice\n     to many of the admittees, but can lower the quality\n     and, concurrently, the prestige of the institutions\n     generally.\n\nId. at 1482-83.   These findings are not clearly erroneous, and\n\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting\n\nprivate plaintiffs’ proposal.\n\n     Even assuming that tiered admissions could be implemented\n\nwithout open admissions as a component thereof, it was not an\n\nabuse of discretion in this context for the district court to opt\n\ninstead for a policy based on uniform standards.   In the\n\nMississippi system of higher education, differential admissions\n\ncriteria were rooted in the de jure past and fostered both\n\n                                 29\n\fsegregation of the races and the public perception that the\n\ninstitutions with lower standards -- the HBIs -- were of inferior\n\nquality.    Id. at 1477, 1486.   A tiered system would continue to\n\ndifferentiate among institutions based on their respective\n\nmissions.   See id. at 1482.     In light of the history of\n\ndifferential admissions in Mississippi higher education, and in\n\nlight of its finding that policies and practices governing the\n\nmissions of the universities are traceable to de jure segregation\n\nand continue to have segregative effects, the district court was\n\nwithin its discretion to unify standards across institutions.\n\n     The standards proposed by the United States met this\n\ninterest in uniformity, but were fixed at a level that the\n\ndistrict court found to be educationally unsound.     Under the\n\nUnited States’s proposal, students with a 2.5 GPA and a class\n\nrank in the top 50% would qualify for regular admission with an\n\nEnhanced ACT score of 13.   While this formula adds high school\n\ngrades and class rank into the eligibility determination, it\n\nnevertheless represents a lowering of the ACT score requirement\n\nfrom even post-1989 levels at the HBIs.     In contrast, students\n\nwith identical qualifications would need an Enhanced ACT score of\n\n16 to qualify for regular admission under the Board’s proposal.\n\nThe district court concluded that the requirements for regular\n\nadmission under the Board’s proposal were “quite moderate,” and\n\nstated that it “does not find persuasive or educationally sound\n\nthe adoption of open admissions or continually lowering\n\nadmissions standards, as was done at the HBIs after the 1987\n\n\n                                   30\n\ftrial.”     Id.    We understand this finding to encompass the\n\nstandards endorsed by the United States.\n\n     Both plaintiffs and defendants cite ACT predictive data in\n\nsupport of their respective proposals.      The United States points\n\nout that such data indicates that students with the minimum\n\nqualifications they propose would be expected to achieve at least\n\na C average by the end of their freshman year at each of the\n\nHBIs.     We note that such students are predicted to complete their\n\nfreshman year with grades significantly below a C average, the\n\nminimum required for graduation, at any of the HWIs.       See\n\nPP 39-R.     Defendants highlight a different aspect of the same\n\npredictive data, which the district court apparently found\n\npersuasive:       students with the minimum qualifications proposed by\n\nthe Board would be expected to complete their freshman year with\n\na C average or slightly below at each of the HWIs.      The district\n\ncourt’s finding that the Board’s proposed standards are “quite\n\nmoderate” is indeed supported by the evidence.      On this record,\n\nthe district court could fairly conclude that it would be\n\neducationally unsound to adopt an admissions policy under which\n\nstudents could do college level work at only three institutions\n\nin the system.33      We realize that no set of standards is without\n\nits flaws.     Significantly, as we discuss below, the standards\n\nthat the district court did adopt provide an alternative route to\n\n     33\n        Under the United States’s proposal, the three\ninstitutions at which students could do college level work are\nthe HBIs. The standards proposed by the United States therefore\ncould have the perverse, albeit unintended, effect of\nperpetuating the channeling effect described in Fordice.\n\n                                    31\n\fadmission that does not rely on ACT scores whatsoever.   The\n\ndistrict court’s decision to order implementation of this system,\n\nrather than dilute standards for regular admission, was a proper\n\nexercise of its discretion.\n\n                ii.   Reliance on spring screening and summer\n                      remedial program\n\n     The district court recognized the likelihood that the\n\nBoard’s standards would reduce the number of black students\n\neligible for regular admission as compared to then-prevailing\n\nstandards,34 and chose to adopt them only in conjunction with the\n\nadditional opportunity to gain admission through the spring\n\nscreening and summer remedial program.   The district court was\n\nunable to conclude that the new standards, which provide an\n\nalternative route to admission that does not rely on ACT scores\n\nwhatsoever,35 would actually reduce the total number of black\n\nstudents eligible for admission either as regular or remediated\n\nadmittees.   In light of the district court finding that lowering\n\nadmissions standards “as was done at the HBIs after the 1987\n\ntrial” is educationally unsound, the court apparently determined\n\nthat to the extent any reduction in the number of black students\n\neligible for admission relative to post-1989 standards does take\n\n     34\n        On the other hand, the district court found that under\nthe Board’s standards, the number of black students eligible for\nregular admission would increase relative to standards in\nexistence at the time of trial in 1987. See Ayers II, 879 F.\nSupp. at 1479.\n     35\n        According to the Board, any high school graduate,\nregardless of academic performance, may participate in spring\nscreening. There is no requirement that participants in spring\nscreening take the ACT. Bd. R-202.\n\n                                 32\n\fplace, it may reflect the educational unsoundness of prior\n\npolicies.     As contemplated, the new standards should result in\n\nthe identification and admission of those applicants who, with\n\nreasonable remediation, can do college level work.     This is\n\nconsistent with Fordice’s mandate of a reformed admissions policy\n\nthat is practicable and educationally sound.\n\n     The district court also recognized that the spring screening\n\nand summer remedial program was untested and its standards not\n\nfully established at the time of trial.     See id. at 1478-79,\n\n1481.     We think that the program was sufficiently defined that\n\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in ordering its\n\nimplementation.     If, however, as plaintiffs suggest may be the\n\ncase,36 the spring and summer program is unable to any\n\nsignificant degree to achieve its intended objectives of\n\nidentifying and admitting otherwise eligible applicants -- i.e.,\n\napplicants who could, with reasonable remediation, successfully\n\ncomplete a regular academic program -- for whatever reason, then\n\nthe program must be reevaluated.37     The district court’s proper\n\n     36\n        In its Motion to Expedite the Appeal, the United States\npresents recently discovered evidence concerning the first year’s\nimplementation of the new standards and the spring and summer\nprogram, which may demonstrate that the new standards exclude a\nsignificant percentage of black students who would have been\neligible for regular admission at the time of the 1994 trial, and\nthat the spring and summer program offers limited ameliorative\npotential. Such evidence, however, is not part of the record\nbefore us and we do not consider it in any substantive way for\npurposes of this appeal.\n     37\n        The district court’s conclusion that the Board’s\nobligation to graduating high school students does not encompass\n“students ineligible for regular admission under its proposal,\nwho do not choose to participate in a screening process for\n\n                                  33\n\fretention of jurisdiction over this action indicates its intent\n\nto examine this important component of the admissions system once\n\nthe relevant data becomes available.38   If the district court\n\nultimately concludes that the spring screening and summer\n\nremedial program (as it may be modified) is unable to any\n\nsignificant degree to achieve its objectives, then the court\n\nshould, if possible, identify and implement another practicable\n\nand educationally sound method for achieving those objectives.\n\n               iii. Elimination of existing remedial courses\n\n     We have thus far addressed the spring and summer program as\n\na component of the reformed admissions policy.   We turn now to\n\nthe argument made by the plaintiffs that the district court erred\n\nin relying upon the summer remedial program to replace the\n\nexisting remedial courses in the absence of a finding that the\n\nsummer program could achieve the same results as the\n\nuniversities’ existing remedial courses in enabling students to\n\nsucceed in and graduate from college.\n\n     We note in this connection that the plan proposed by the\n\nBoard provides that “[d]evelopmental studies are only offered\n\n\n\nacademic placement analysis,” Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1481, is\ntoo sweeping insofar as it may include students who, with\nreasonable remediation, are capable of doing college level work\nbut who self-select out of the spring or summer program because\nof the unique burdens imposed by the program or flaws in its\ndesign or operation.\n     38\n        Cf. Green v. County Sch. Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107705\"><a href=\"/opinion/107705/green-v-county-school-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 439 (1968)\n(“Moreover, whatever plan is adopted will require evaluation in\npractice, and the court should retain jurisdiction until it is\nclear that state-imposed segregation has been completely\nremoved.”).\n\n                                34\n\fduring the summer session.”    In ordering implementation of this\n\nplan, the district court tacitly approved the elimination of\n\nmost, perhaps even all, of the remedial courses that had been\n\noffered by all the universities at issue here, most notably by\n\nthe HBIs.   This is a troubling decision, implicating the reformed\n\npolicies for regular admission as well as the spring screening\n\nand summer remedial program.   On the one hand, there was evidence\n\nto indicate that an intensive, structured program of remedial\n\ninstruction during the summer months prior to a student’s\n\nimmersion in the college experience may actually be more\n\neffective at preparing students for college than a more diffused\n\nprogram of remedial instruction throughout the academic year.    On\n\nthe other hand, the district court appeared to base its decision\n\nnot to consolidate Mississippi Valley State University with Delta\n\nState University, at least in part, on the significant percentage\n\nof students enrolled in remedial, or developmental, education at\n\nMississippi Valley and on Mississippi Valley’s role as “a\n\nsignificant nurturer of underprepared blacks,” id. at 1492, a\n\nrole that the district court apparently did not want to see\n\neliminated.39 Further, it is not clear to what extent the\n\noperative predictive data assumes the existence of remedial\n\nprograms insofar as it is based on historical achievement.    It is\n\nclear that the predictive data relied upon by the State in\n\n     39\n        We find it significant that the presidents of\nMississippi’s HBIs testified that the existing remedial programs\nat the HBIs are essential to meet the needs of the students they\nserve and at least one questioned whether the summer remedial\nprogram would adequately replace them.\n\n                                 35\n\fsupport of its argument that its proposed admissions standards\n\nwere “quite moderate” indicate that students who are admitted\n\nwith the minimum qualifications required under the new standards\n\nare not predicted to achieve a C average during their first year\n\nat at least three of the HWIs.    This suggests, as defendants note\n\nin their brief and indicated at oral argument before this court,\n\nthat many students who are admitted under the reformed standards\n\nwill need “substantial educational assistance,” possibly\n\nincluding remedial courses.40    Remedial courses may be an\n\nimportant part of the admissions policy at any school in which a\n\nsignificant number of students are not predicted to achieve a C\n\naverage during their first year.\n\n     Plaintiffs did not challenge the State’s existing\n\nremediation policies as traceable to the de jure era.     There was\n\ntherefore no requirement, under Fordice, for reformation of those\n\npolicies as such.   However, the Board’s proposed admissions\n\nstandards (Bd. R-202) treated the adoption of the summer program\n\nand the elimination of the existing remedial courses as\n\ncomponents of its admissions standards, and the district court,\n\nin ordering the implementation of the Board’s proposal,\n\neffectively did the same.   The principle that apparently\n\nunderlies the Board’s admissions policy (and, therefore, the\n\n     40\n        There may be a distinction between students who qualify\nfor regular admission but who are also in need of remedial\neducation and students who do not so qualify. The total\nimmersion aspect of the summer program may be important for the\nlatter group but unnecessarily burdensome for the former group.\nIn suggesting these considerations, we intimate no view as to\ntheir ultimate merit.\n\n                                  36\n\fdistrict court’s decision) is that, in the case of any applicant,\n\nwhat can and cannot be accomplished with reasonable remediation\n\nis a key element of the admissions decision.     Clearly, this\n\nprinciple is educationally sound.     But the court’s action in\n\neliminating the existing remedial courses can legitimately be\n\nchallenged by plaintiffs as an inappropriate feature of the\n\ncourt’s admissions remedy.    We have recognized that there are\n\nsome tensions in the district court’s findings in this regard.\n\nIn the light of these tensions and the absence of specific\n\nconsideration of the justification for, or reasonableness of,\n\neliminating these unchallenged courses, we are sufficiently\n\nconcerned about the district court’s exercise of its discretion\n\nin this regard to direct the court on remand to reconsider its\n\ndecision to eliminate these courses.     On remand, the district\n\ncourt should determine if remedial courses are needed to help\n\nensure that students admitted under the new admissions criteria\n\nhave a realistic chance of achieving academic success.41\n\n               iv.   Timing\n\n     The United States argues that it may take several years for\n\nthe summer program to be thoroughly implemented, tested, and\n\nevaluated and argues that during the interim, an admissions\n\npolicy that minimizes any reduction in the number of black\n\n\n\n\n     41\n        The decision whether to take more evidence on the\nadvisability of reinstating any or all of these courses, either\nas previously offered or as modified to operate in conjunction\nwith the summer remedial program, is left to the district court.\n\n                                 37\n\fstudents eligible for regular admission should be installed.42\n\nWe reject this argument.    The summer program has sufficient\n\npromise, on the present state of the record, to allow it “to\n\nprove itself in operation,” Green v. County Sch. Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107705\"><a href=\"/opinion/107705/green-v-county-school-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">430</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 440-41 (1968), should the district court decide to continue\n\non that path.     There is no reason why, however, reconsideration\n\nof the district court’s decision to eliminate the existing\n\nremedial courses cannot be done promptly.     We intimate no view on\n\nthe outcome of that reconsideration.\n\n             d.   Conclusions regarding undergraduate admissions\n                  standards\n\n     Except as set forth below, we affirm paragraph 2 of the\n\nremedial decree, which reads in relevant part as follows:     “The\n\n1995 admissions standards as proposed by the Board for first-time\n\nfreshmen, effective for the academic year [1996-97], shall be\n\nimplemented at all universities.”      Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at\n\n1494.     We do not affirm paragraph 2 insofar as it eliminates the\n\nremedial courses previously offered at each of the eight\n\nuniversities.     We remand this latter issue for reconsideration in\n\nthe light of this opinion.     We understand the district court’s\n\ncontinuing jurisdiction to encompass the evaluation of the\n\neffectiveness of the spring screening and summer remedial\n\n     42\n        The United States makes a similar argument with respect\nto the time that it will take to implement changes at the\ncommunity colleges. We think that the remedial decree adopted by\nthe district court adequately addresses the community colleges to\nthe extent they can be addressed in this case. The fact that\nimplementation of this aspect of the remedial decree will take\ntime does not require installation of an interim admissions\npolicy.\n\n                                  38\n\fprogram, as a component of the admissions system, in achieving\n\nits intended objectives of identifying and admitting those\n\nstudents who are capable, with reasonable remediation, of doing\n\ncollege level work but who fail to qualify for regular admission.\n\nShould the district court ultimately conclude that this program\n\n(as it may be modified) is unable to any significant degree to\n\nachieve its objectives, then the court will need to identify and\n\nimplement another method for achieving those objectives.\n\n     3.   Scholarship Policies\n\n          a.   District court ruling\n\n     While the district court found that undergraduate admissions\n\npolicies in general are vestiges of de jure segregation that\n\ncontinue to have segregative effects, it found that scholarship\n\npolicies in particular are not.    On remand, plaintiffs challenged\n\nthe use of ACT cutoff scores for the award of undergraduate\n\nacademic scholarships at the HWIs, as well as the use of ACT\n\ncutoff scores and alumni connection in the award of nonresident\n\nfee waivers for out-of-state admittees.43   Unlike most other\n\n\n     43\n        The nonresident fee waivers for children of nonresident\nalumni are referred to in the record also as “alumni\nscholarships.” Our use of the term “scholarships” encompasses\nacademic scholarships as well as nonresident fee waivers, but we\nuse the term “nonresident fee waiver” when referring solely to\nthis type of award.\n\n     We note that Mississippi University for Women offers certain\nscholarships to resident and nonresident children of MUW alumni\nthat require a minimum ACT score of 21 for eligibility. These\nscholarships are distinct from the nonresident fee waivers, but\nplaintiffs challenge the use of the ACT cutoff score and the\nalumni connection in determining eligibility for these\nscholarships as well.\n\n                                  39\n\fforms of financial aid, the scholarships challenged by plaintiffs\n\nare generally awarded on the basis of academic achievement, not\n\nfinancial need, and do not require repayment by the recipient.\n\nThe district court found a significant disparity in the\n\npercentage of nonresident fee waivers awarded by race in any\n\ngiven year.     Id. at 1433.   The evidence indicated similar\n\ndisparities in the award of academic scholarships.      The district\n\ncourt concluded, however, that\n\n          [t]he Board’s policy of allowing [nonresident fee\n     waivers] to be based on ACT cutoffs and the use of ACT\n     cutoff scores as the sole criterion for the receipt of\n     academic scholarship monies has not been proven to have\n     linkage with the de jure system, and there is no\n     evidence that these practices currently foster\n     separation of the races such as influencing student\n     choice. Therefore, reformation of these policies\n     cannot be ordered consistent with the law of the case,\n     absent evidence of discriminatory purpose of which the\n     court finds none. The use of ACT scores in awarding\n     scholarships is widespread throughout the United States\n     and generally viewed as educationally sound.\n\nId. at 1434-35 (footnote omitted).      The district court did not\n\nmake a specific finding with regard to the traceability of the\n\nalumni connection requirement for nonresident fee waivers.      The\n\nremedial decree does not order alteration of any of the\n\nchallenged scholarship policies.\n\n           b.     Arguments on appeal\n\n     Plaintiffs argue that the district court clearly erred in\n\nfinding that the use of ACT cutoffs in the award of academic\n\nscholarships and nonresident fee waivers at the HWIs is not\n\ntraceable to the dual system and does not have segregative\n\neffects.   Although the district court’s findings and conclusions\n\n\n                                   40\n\fwith respect to academic scholarships focus specifically on\n\npolicies that establish an ACT cutoff score as the sole criterion\n\nfor award, plaintiffs’ challenge encompasses all instances in\n\nwhich the HWIs require a minimum ACT score for scholarship\n\neligibility.44   Accordingly, plaintiffs have identified on appeal\n\nnumerous scholarships at various HWIs that are available only to\n\nstudents with certain minimum ACT scores.    Plaintiffs contend\n\nthat the use of ACT cutoff scores for scholarship eligibility is\n\ntraceable to the de jure system because under that system ACT\n\ncutoff scores were implemented for the purpose of excluding black\n\nstudents from the HWIs.    The segregative effects of this\n\npractice, plaintiffs argue, are evident in the racial disparity\n\nin scholarship awards.    Because black students receive only a\n\nvery small proportion of such scholarships, yet are more likely\n\nthan white students to be in need of financial aid, the policy\n\neffectively reduces the number of black students able to attend\n\nthe HWIs.   Moreover, plaintiffs argue that the record does not\n\n     44\n        In the Pretrial Order, private plaintiffs listed as a\nchallenged remnant “[t]he policy of using ACT cutoff scores in\nselecting persons to receive particular scholarships at the\nundergraduate level at each HWI.” The United States similarly\nidentified this alleged remnant as “[t]he practice of using the\nACT in selecting persons to receive scholarships at the\nundergraduate level.”\n\n     Significantly, plaintiffs do not challenge any of the\nscholarship policies at the HBIs and no party argues on appeal\nthat such policies either are traceable to the de jure system or\nhave present segregative effects. Accordingly, we express no\nopinion on the scholarship policies at the HBIs or their\nrelevance in reforming scholarship policies to eliminate present\nsegregative effects. In fashioning the most appropriate remedy,\nhowever, the district court may find it relevant to consider all\nscholarship policies.\n\n                                 41\n\fsupport the district court’s finding that the use of ACT cutoff\n\nscores in the award of scholarships is widespread.\n\n     Plaintiffs also contend that the district court erred in\n\nupholding the practice of limiting nonresident fee waivers to\n\nchildren of an institution’s alumni.       Plaintiffs maintain that\n\nthe alumni connection requirement is traceable to the de jure\n\nsystem in that parents of today’s students were systematically\n\nexcluded from the HWIs under the de jure system.\n\n          c.     Analysis\n\n     Although it is clear from the record that undergraduate\n\nscholarship policies were litigated on remand, the district court\n\nmade virtually no fact findings with regard to specific policy\n\ncriteria or operation.      The parties’ original briefing of this\n\nissue on appeal was also scant.45       In response to our request for\n\nsupplemental briefing, plaintiffs provided a summary of the\n\nchallenged policies along with the racial breakdown of their\n\ndistribution for the 1992-93 year (and in one instance, for the\n\n1991-92 year).   Defendants have not contested the accuracy of\n\nthis summary, which is drawn from defendants’ answers to\n\ninterrogatories and from other evidence introduced by defendants.\n\nWe therefore accept plaintiffs’ factual summary.       According to\n\nthat summary, the scholarships alleged to be traceable to de jure\n\nsegregation and to have present discriminatory effects are as\n\n\n     45\n        To ensure that we were apprised of all arguments and\nrelevant evidence on appeal, we requested, and the parties\nsupplied, supplemental briefing on the issue of undergraduate\nscholarships.\n\n                                   42\n\ffollows:\n\n\n\nDELTA STATE UNIVERSITY     First-time freshman enrollment 1992-93: 21% black\nScholarship      Minimum     Number of Recipients          Dollars Received\nName46           ACT\n                 Score       Black     White     Total     Black       White            Total\nDean’s and       26               2      160         162    $1,375        $131,175        $132,550\nPresidential\n                                      1% black                     1% black\n\n\nMISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY     First-time freshman enrollment 1992-93: 16% black\nScholarship      Minimum     Number of Recipients          Dollars Received\nName             ACT\n                 Score       Black     White     Total     Black       White            Total\nEntering         31               1      294         299    $2,000        $546,000        $555,000\nFreshman ACT\n8,000\nSharp Forestry   31               0        3           3           0            7,500           7,500\nEntering         29               5      454         468    16,250         596,836         626,836\nFreshman ACT\n5,000 and\nSchillig\nRamsey &         28               0       41          41           0       115,500         115,500\nElaine O’Neal\nand Hearin-\nHess\nEntering         28               5      248         267     7,944         239,444         261,388\nFreshmen ACT\n4,000, South\nCentral Bell,\nand Jesse &\nLillian Tims\nLeadership       20               8       71          80     3,600             34,450       38,550\nJohn C.          24               1        6           8     1,000              6,000           8,000\nStennis\nAlumni           21             N/A      N/A         N/A       N/A                N/A             N/A\nTOTAL                            20     1117        1166   $30,794      $1,545,730      $1,612,774\n                                      2% black                     2% black             MISSISSIPPI\n                                                                                        UNIVERSITY\n                                                                                        FOR WOMEN\n\n\n\n        46\n        Plaintiffs advise in their brief that in some instances\ndata for more than one scholarship with the same ACT cutoff score\nhas been grouped.

We agree with the\n\nprinciple articulated by the district court that use of an ACT\n\ncutoff is not unlawful in all circumstances.                         “Rather, its\n\nparticular use in any circumstance must be examined to consider\nwhether as a component of the policy challenged, the same is\n\ntraceable to prior de jure segregation.”                    Ayers II, 879 F. Supp.\n\nat 1434.      In light of the facts set out above, however, we\n\nconclude that the district court erred in arriving at its\n\nfindings regarding traceability and segregative effects.47\n\n        The district court may have applied an erroneous view of\n\n\n        47\n        Our conclusion in this regard applies to the use of ACT\ncutoffs in all challenged scholarships.\n\n                                            45\n\ftraceability.     As defendants point out in their supplemental\n\nletter brief, a traceable policy is one “rooted in” the prior\n\ndual system.     See Fordice, 505 U.S. at 730 n.4, 732 n.6, 743.     It\n\nis only “surviving aspects” of de jure segregation that a state\n\nneed remedy.     See id. at 733.   That is not to say, however, that\n\na challenged policy as it exists today must have been in effect\n\nduring the de jure period in order to be constitutionally\n\nproblematic.     The undergraduate admissions criteria that the\n\ndistrict court found to be traceable, for instance, had been\n\nmodified several times since the de jure era but nonetheless were\n\nfound to be rooted in the prior system.     Similarly, the Supreme\n\nCourt found Mississippi’s scheme of institutional mission\n\nclassifications to be traceable to de jure segregation even\n\nthough it was not put in place until several years after\n\ntermination of official segregation.      See id. at 732-33, 739-41.\n\nThe Court noted that “[t]he institutional mission designations\n\nadopted in 1981 have as their antecedents the policies enacted to\n\nperpetuate racial separation during the de jure segregated\n\nregime.”    Id. at 739.   In United States v. Louisiana, this court\n\nimplicitly recognized that Louisiana’s open admissions policy\n\ncould be traceable to that state’s prior de jure system despite\n\nits adoption only after de jure segregation had ended.      See 9\n\nF.3d at 1167.     Because the district court had not addressed the\n\npolicy’s traceability, we left the issue open for resolution on\n\nremand.    Id.\n\n     In this case, plaintiffs concede that the record does not\n\n\n                                   46\n\fcontain evidence directly linking the use of ACT cutoffs for\n\nscholarship purposes with any time prior to 1980.      Such evidence\n\napparently was not developed because plaintiffs concluded, in our\n\nview correctly, that the discriminatory use of ACT cutoffs to\n\nexclude black students from the HWIs during the de jure period\n\nestablishes traceability with respect to all current practices\n\nthat limit black student access to the HWIs by setting ACT cutoff\n\nscores at a level that disproportionately favors white students.\n\nDefendants contend that plaintiffs have failed to prove\n\ntraceability because they have not produced evidence establishing\n\nthat the practice of using ACT cutoffs in the award of\n\nscholarships was initiated either “(i) during de jure\n\nsegregation, (ii) as an integral component of de jure\n\nsegregation, (iii) to continue, perpetuate, or further\n\nsegregation, or (iv) because of some intentionally segregative\n\npolicy which formerly existed.”48      This argument misses the mark.\n\nFirst, to the extent defendants suggest it is lacking, evidence\n\nof discriminatory purpose is required to establish a\n\nconstitutional violation only for present policies that are not\n\ntraceable to the prior system; discriminatory purpose is not an\n\nelement of traceability itself.     Fordice, 505 U.S. at 733 n.8.\n\nSecond, this argument ignores the relationship between\n\nscholarship awards and grants of admission, an element missing\n\n     48\n        Upon motion of plaintiffs, the district court placed the\nburden of proving traceability on plaintiffs. No party appeals\nthe allocation of burdens of proof. For purposes of this appeal,\nwe assume without deciding that the district court did not err in\nthis respect.\n\n                                  47\n\ffrom the district court’s analysis as well.\n\n     Scholarship decisions are not wholly independent of\n\nadmissions in the way that most financial aid determinations are.\n\nIndeed, the record indicates that at University of Mississippi,\n\nDelta State University, and Mississippi University for Women, the\n\napplication for admission also constitutes the application for\n\nscholarships.   It is because scholarships are intended to reward\n\nexemplary academic achievement, as defendants point out, that\n\nscholarship decision criteria overlap more with those for\n\nadmission than for financial aid.     By their nature, scholarships\n\nare designed to attract outstanding students to the awarding\n\ninstitution; that scholarships need not be repaid is a powerful\n\nincentive for students to both pursue and accept them.    As a\n\ncomponent of admissions, scholarship policies further the process\n\nthat ultimately culminates in matriculation.    In finding that the\n\nuse of ACT cutoffs in the scholarship context is not traceable to\n\nthe de jure system, the district court may have distinguished\n\nscholarships too strictly from admissions, although its opinion,\n\nwhich addresses scholarships as a component of admissions,\n\nsuggests otherwise.   See Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1424, 1431-35.\n\n     As presented by plaintiffs, the challenged scholarships\n\nrequire students to achieve a certain minimum ACT score to be\n\neligible for the award.    Accordingly, a student who has not\n\nachieved the requisite ACT score will not be considered,\n\nregardless of how impressive his or her grades or other academic\n\nachievements might be.    This is “constitutionally problematic”\n\n\n                                 48\n\ffor the same reason the Supreme Court found the use of the ACT in\n\nadmissions to be so.    See Fordice, 505 U.S. at 736 (“Another\n\nconstitutionally problematic aspect of the State’s use of the ACT\n\ntest scores is its policy of denying automatic admission if an\n\napplicant fails to earn the minimum ACT score specified for the\n\nparticular institution, without also resorting to the applicant’s\n\nhigh school grades as an additional factor in predicting college\n\nperformance.”).   Just as there may be students who could do\n\ncollege level work yet might be precluded from enrolling in an\n\ninstitution that maintains ACT cutoffs in admissions, there may\n\nbe students who have outstanding academic achievement that merits\n\nrecognition apart from their ACT scores.\n\n     It bears emphasis that the use of ACT cutoffs in the award\n\nof scholarships raises constitutional suspicion only because of\n\nthe history of de jure segregation in Mississippi.     The practice\n\nof rewarding academic achievement as determined by standardized\n\ntest scores, even where it results in significant racial\n\ndisparities in receipt of awards, is not per se unconstitutional.\n\nUse of ACT cutoffs does not take place on a clean slate in\n\nMississippi, however.   The alleged practice of basing scholarship\n\neligibility on minimum ACT scores flows from earlier\n\ndiscriminatory use of ACT cutoffs and therefore triggers further\n\nconstitutional inquiry, under Fordice, into whether it continues\n\nto have segregative effects.\n\n     The use of ACT cutoff scores in the award of scholarships\n\nrestricts black students’ access to the HWIs in much the same way\n\n\n                                 49\n\fthat the use of ACT cutoff scores in a system of differential\n\nadmissions standards was found to restrict access.     The district\n\ncourt findings and other evidence indicate that scholarships with\n\nACT cutoff scores are disproportionately awarded to white\n\nstudents.   See Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1433.     In addition, the\n\ndistrict court found that black applicants to Mississippi’s\n\nuniversities are more likely to need financial aid than white\n\napplicants.     Id. at 1433-34 n.28.   To the extent that\n\nacademically accomplished black students are unable to achieve\n\nACT scores that would qualify them for scholarships at the HWIs,\n\nthey are discouraged from both applying to and matriculating at\n\nthese institutions.49    While the potential segregative effect of\n\nthe use of ACT cutoffs in determining scholarship eligibility is\n\nperhaps somewhat less pronounced than that of the use of ACT\n\ncutoffs in admissions, the evidence nevertheless indicates that\n\nsuch potential does exist.\n\n     The fact that some HWIs offer scholarships specifically for\n\nblack applicants does not, as the State argues, alter this\n\nconclusion.   The evidence suggests that such scholarships\n\nrepresent an extremely limited proportion of available\n\nscholarship monies, and in most instances fall significantly\n\nshort of the amount of aid offered through generally available\n\nscholarships.    The availability of a small number of minority\n\nscholarships at the HWIs does not automatically neutralize the\n\n     49\n        The district court found that black students continue to\nbe significantly underrepresented at most of the HWIs. Ayers II,\n879 F. Supp. at 1469.\n\n                                  50\n\fongoing discriminatory effects of current scholarship policies\n\nrooted in the de jure past.\n\n     There is evidence in the record to indicate that the use of\n\nACT cutoffs in the award of scholarships can be practicably\n\neliminated consistent with sound educational practices.    Of\n\ncourse, as we noted with respect to undergraduate admissions\n\npolicies, we do not hold that reliance on ACT scores for\n\nscholarship purposes must be eradicated entirely.   We leave to\n\nthe district court on remand factfinding with regard to the\n\npracticability of reforming current policies consistent with\n\nsound educational practices.\n\n     Plaintiffs also argue that the district court erred in\n\nfailing to find that basing eligibility for nonresident fee\n\nwaivers (and, in the case of Mississippi University for Women,\n\ncertain scholarships for children of resident and nonresident\n\nalumni) on relationship to alumni of Mississippi’s HWIs is\n\ntraceable to the de jure system and has present segregative\n\neffects.   We agree that this practice, which the district court\n\nfound to result in the disproportionate award of such\n\nscholarships to white students, has present segregative effects.\n\nWe are not persuaded, however, that traceability has been\n\nestablished on this record.50   Plaintiffs’ argument rests upon\n\nthe exclusion of blacks from the HWIs during the de jure period.\n\n\n     50\n        Our conclusion in this regard applies to the alumni\nconnection requirement in the challenged scholarships offered by\nMississippi University for Women as well as that in the\nnonresident fee waivers.\n\n                                 51\n\fThis fact, without more, does not establish the traceability of\n\nthe alumni element of the present nonresident fee waivers.    In\n\neffect, plaintiffs seek relief for “present discriminatory\n\neffects without addressing whether such consequences flow from\n\npolicies rooted in the prior system.”    Fordice, 505 U.S. at 730\n\nn.4.    The Supreme Court has rejected this position.   Id.\n\nPlaintiffs note in their briefs that this court struck down, as\n\nunlawfully discriminating against black applicants to Mississippi\n\nuniversities, a requirement established by the Board shortly\n\nafter the decision in Brown v.

In our view (assuming\n\nthat plaintiffs intend this as an alternative basis for\n\ntraceability), on this record the alumni certificate requirement\n\nfor admission has no connection, historical or otherwise, with\n\nthe nonresident fee waivers presently awarded to the children of\n\nnonresident alumni except for the fact that both involve some\n\n“alumni connection.”    Any such argument urges us to a level of\n\ngenerality that is beyond the traceability contemplated by\n\nFordice.\n\n            d.   Conclusions regarding scholarship policies\n\n       We reverse the district court’s finding that the use of ACT\n\ncutoff scores as a criterion for the award of scholarships at the\n\nHWIs is not traceable to the de jure system and does not\n\n\n                                 52\n\fcurrently foster segregation.   We remand for determination of the\n\npracticability and educational soundness of reforming this aspect\n\nof the undergraduate scholarship policies at the HWIs and the\n\nimplementation, if necessary, of appropriate remedial relief.\n\n\n\nB.   Enhancement of Historically Black Institutions\n\n     1.   Background Facts\n\n     Plaintiffs contend that several policies related to funding\n\nand programs at the HBIs are remnants of the de jure system that\n\nmust be remedied by relief more expansive than that ordered by\n\nthe district court.   Plaintiffs’ arguments in this regard\n\nencompass four interrelated areas:   new academic programs, land\n\ngrant programs, program duplication, and funding.   According to\n\nplaintiffs, these aspects of higher education affect student\n\nchoice, and existing policies must be remedied in order to enable\n\nthe HBIs to attract students of all races.51\n\n     In addition, private plaintiffs appear to advocate\n\nenhancement of the HBIs in order to rectify the detrimental\n\neffects of past de jure segregation, without regard to present\n\npolicies and practices.   This position is at odds with standards\n\nestablished in Fordice.   The Supreme Court expressly rejected the\n\nproposition that the State’s duty to dismantle its prior de jure\n\nsystem requires elimination of all continuing discriminatory\n\n\n     51\n        The district court found that “[b]lacks are now\nattending the HWIs as a group in statistical parity with their\nrepresentation in the qualified pool.” Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at\n1486.\n\n                                53\n\feffects:   “To the extent we understand private petitioners to\n\nurge us to focus on present discriminatory effects without\n\naddressing whether such consequences flow from policies rooted in\n\nthe prior system, we reject this position.”     Fordice, 505 U.S. at\n\n730 n.4.   Likewise,\n\n          [i]f we understand private petitioners to press us\n     to order the upgrading of Jackson State, Alcorn State,\n     and Mississippi Valley State solely so that they may be\n     publicly financed, exclusively black enclaves by\n     private choice, we reject that request. The State\n     provides these facilities for all its citizens and it\n     has not met its burden under Brown to take affirmative\n     steps to dismantle its prior de jure system when it\n     perpetuates a separate, but ‘more equal’ one.\n\nId. at 743.\n\n     The appropriate inquiry under Fordice, then, is whether\n\nchanges in resource allocation are necessary to dismantle fully\n\npresent policies and practices rooted in the prior system that\n\nserve to maintain the racial identifiability of the universities\n\nand that can practicably be eliminated without eroding sound\n\neducational policies.   See id.    Current policies and practices\n\n(as distinguished from lingering disparities in institutional\n\ndevelopment per se) implicate the Fourteenth Amendment only\n\ninsofar as they are traceable to the prior system and continue to\n\nhave segregative effects, either by influencing student choice or\n\notherwise.\n\n     2.    New Academic Programs\n\n           a.   District court ruling\n\n     The programmatic expansions of Jackson State and Alcorn\n\nState ordered by the district court respond to its findings\n\n\n                                   54\n\fconcerning deliberate efforts by the State of Mississippi to\n\nrestrict the educational opportunities of its black citizens, as\n\nwell as the traceability of current mission assignments to these\n\nhistorical antecedents.     See Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1437-41,\n\n1477, 1483-86.   As the district court found, after establishment\n\nof Alcorn State in 1871 and continuing through roughly the first\n\nhalf of this century, the prevailing notion concerning the\n\neducation of blacks was that blacks could benefit only from\n\nagricultural or mechanical training, rather than a liberal\n\neducation as provided to whites.       Id. at 1437-38.   Alcorn State\n\nwas originally designated as an agricultural college for\n\nMississippi’s black youth, and Jackson State and Mississippi\n\nValley State, founded in 1940 and 1950, respectively, were\n\nestablished primarily to train black teachers.       Ayers I, 674 F.\n\nSupp. at 1527-28.   During the years 1945 through 1970, when both\n\nthe HWIs and the HBIs experienced considerable growth in\n\nenrollment, the bulk of the State’s higher education resources,\n\nparticularly programmatic allocations, went to University of\n\nMississippi, University of Southern Mississippi, and Mississippi\n\nState University, the three leading white universities.        Ayers\n\nII, 879 F. Supp. at 1439.\n\n     The district court found that the mission designations\n\nadopted by the Board in 1981 -- and in place throughout both the\n\n1987 and 1994 trials -- effectively fixed the scope of\n\nprogrammatic offerings that were in place at each university\n\nduring the de jure period.     Id. at 1438-39.   The Board designated\n\n\n                                  55\n\fUniversity of Mississippi, University of Southern Mississippi,\n\nand Mississippi State University “comprehensive” universities,\n\nthereby indicating that these institutions would continue to\n\noffer a greater number and a higher level of degree programs than\n\nall other institutions.   Based on its location in the city of\n\nJackson, Jackson State was designated an “urban” university with\n\nthe mission of serving the urban community.    The Board designated\n\nAlcorn State, Delta State, Mississippi University for Women, and\n\nMississippi Valley State “regional” universities, signifying a\n\nprogrammatic range limited to undergraduate instruction.     Id. at\n\n1438.\n\n     In Fordice, the Supreme Court found that\n\n     when combined with the differential admission practices\n     and unnecessary program duplication, it is likely that\n     the mission designations interfere with student choice\n     and tend to perpetuate the segregated system. On\n     remand, the court should inquire whether it would be\n     practicable and consistent with sound educational\n     practices to eliminate any such discriminatory effects\n     of the State’s present policy of mission assignments.\n\n505 U.S. at 741.   The district court indeed found that\n\n“[p]olicies and practices governing the missions of the\n\ninstitutions of higher learning are traceable to de jure\n\nsegregation and continue to foster separation of the races.”\n\nAyers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1477.    The remedial decree, however,\n\ndoes not order any alteration of the mission designations.     See\n\nid. at 1483.52   No party appeals retention of the mission\n\n\n     52\n         The Board apparently has upgraded the mission of Jackson\nState to an “enhanced” urban designation. Ayers II, 879 F. Supp.\nat 1483.\n\n                                  56\n\fdesignations per se.\n\n     The remedial decree does order some augmentation of the\n\nprograms offered at Jackson State and Alcorn State.53     The\n\ndistrict court found that the policies and practices of de jure\n\nsegregation impeded the development of both universities.       Id. at\n\n1466, 1484.   At Jackson State, the court found that the dearth of\n\nprofessional programs hindered potential other-race enrollment at\n\nthe main campus.   Id. at 1485.   Although the court found that the\n\nrecord supported neither the educational soundness of\n\ntransferring programs to Jackson State nor the desegregative\n\npotential of institutional affiliation with the University of\n\nMississippi Medical Center, it found that the addition of other\n\nunique, high demand programs did have potential to desegregate\n\nthe institution.   See id. at 1485-86.   The district court\n\naccordingly ordered implementation at Jackson State of programs\n\nin allied health, social work (Ph.D), urban planning\n\n(Masters/Ph.D), and business (DBA).54    Id. at 1494.   In addition,\n\nthe remedial decree directs the Board to undertake an\n\ninstitutional study\n\n     with the express purpose of determining the nature and\n     direction of those programs slated to be implemented,\n     as well as further programmatic expansion at JSU, to\n     best achieve the urban emphasis of its mission.\n     Included in this study will be an evaluation of the\n\n     53\n        The remedial decree orders the State to provide the\nfunding for all measures ordered by the decree. Ayers II, 879 F.\nSupp. at 1496.\n     54\n        The doctoral program in business is to be implemented at\nJackson State “when existing business programs are accredited.”\nAyers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1494.\n\n                                  57\n\f     feasibility and educational soundness of establishing\n     an engineering school, a public law school, and a five-\n     year pharmacy program under the direction and control\n     of JSU.\n\nId. at 1495.\n\n     With respect to Alcorn State, the district court found that\n\ncertain proposed programmatic enhancements promised realistically\n\nto increase other-race presence and were educationally sound.\n\nAccordingly, the district court ordered implementation of an MBA\n\nprogram at Alcorn’s Natchez Center, to be funded specially by the\n\nState along with related capital improvements.   The court also\n\nordered the State to provide the Small Farm Development Center at\n\nAlcorn with annual research and extension funds to match similar\n\nfederal funds appropriated to Alcorn, up to an aggregate of $4\n\nmillion each year.55   Id. at 1495.\n\n     The district court did not order any programmatic\n\nenhancements at Mississippi Valley State.   Although the court\n\nfound that Mississippi Valley State’s proximity to Delta State\n\ntended to perpetuate segregation,56 it stated that\n\n     [o]n the record . . . the court cannot find that\n     institutional enhancement of MVSU will eliminate the\n     vestiges of segregation that have contributed to MVSU’s\n     status as essentially a one-race institution. Evidence\n     does not persuade the court that merely adding programs\n     and increasing budgets will desegregate a HBI. That is\n     not to say, however, that changes made over time at the\n\n     55\n        The Small Farm Development Center falls within the land\ngrant function of Alcorn State. While we note this component of\nthe remedial decree here, we discuss the court’s ruling with\nrespect to land grant programs separately below.\n     56\n        The district court’s findings with respect to the\nsegregative effects of proximate and nonproximate institutions\nare set forth in our discussion of program duplication infra.\n\n                                 58\n\f      university consistent with its mission as a\n      baccalaureate institution cannot promote diversity at\n      the campus. The court cannot find that institutional\n      or programmatic enhancement of MVSU is justified as\n      educationally sound for desegregation purposes based on\n      this record.\n\nId. at 1491.   The court also found, however, that while\n\n      there is evidence to suggest that transferring programs\n      to MVSU may not be educationally sound, there is\n      likewise evidence that measures can be taken which,\n      over time, offer a potential of desegregating MVSU. As\n      one of the State’s own witnesses testified, evidence\n      suggests that HBIs in other formally de jure segregated\n      states have been successful in integrating their\n      student bodies through a variety of approaches and\n      measures.\n\nId.   The sole portion of the remedial decree that pertains\n\nspecifically to Mississippi Valley State is the following section\n\nconcerning the proposed merger with Delta State:\n\n           12. If, after further study of any available\n      educationally sound alternatives, the Board determines\n      that desegregation in the Mississippi Delta can be\n      attained only through its DSU/MVSU consolidation\n      proposal and that abandoning the financial investment\n      presently in place at the [MVSU] campus and\n      constructing replacement facilities at the [DSU] campus\n      present a practical course of action, it shall\n      substantiate that conclusion no later than July 1, 1996\n      to the Monitoring Committee.\n\nId. at 1495.\n\n      Finally, the district court determined that practices\n\nconcerning accreditation of academic programs at the HBIs did not\n\nwarrant remedial relief.57   The court found that while none of\n\nthe HBIs was accredited as of 1961, each has now attained\n\n      57\n        Private plaintiffs and the United States challenged\n“[t]he practice of failing to take the necessary steps (including\nthe provision[] of required facilities) to secure the\naccreditation of programs at the HBIs.” Ayers II, 879 F. Supp.\nat 1497, 1501.\n\n                                 59\n\faccreditation and “[s]ince 1980, with the possible exception of\n\nJSU, the overall percentage of programs accredited at all\n\nuniversities has increased substantially.”   Id. at 1441.   The\n\ncourt found that the State’s “inattentiveness” to the HBIs during\n\nthe de jure period with regard to program and institutional\n\naccreditation negatively affected institutional prestige, but\n\nthat “there is no evidence that the State’s previous failings in\n\nthis regard persist into the present day.”   Id. at 1445.   The\n\ncourt stated that little evidence had been presented on the\n\npresent status of the accreditation issue.   Id.\n\n          b.    Arguments on appeal\n\n     Plaintiffs argue that the district court erred as a matter\n\nof law by failing to order any new programs at Mississippi Valley\n\nState and only two new programs at Alcorn State.   While\n\nplaintiffs do not challenge the district court’s rejection of the\n\nBoard’s proposal to merge Mississippi Valley State and Delta\n\nState, they contend that the record does not support the court’s\n\nconclusion that programmatic enhancement of Mississippi Valley\n\nState will not help to desegregate the Delta.   Plaintiffs argue\n\nwith respect to Alcorn State that further relief is warranted\n\ngiven the Natchez location of the MBA program, which plaintiffs\n\ncontend will not help to desegregate the main campus,58 and the\n\nState’s prior commitment to funding the Small Farm Development\n\nCenter.   The United States specifically asks this court to remand\n\n\n     58\n        The Natchez Center is located approximately 40 miles\nfrom Alcorn’s main campus. Ayers I, 674 F. Supp. at 1542.\n\n                                60\n\fwith instructions to order the Board to study and report to the\n\nMonitoring Committee on actions that could be taken to enable\n\nMississippi Valley State and Alcorn State to attract students of\n\nall races, including improvement of existing programs and the\n\naddition of unique, high demand programs.59   Plaintiffs do not\n\nappeal the district court’s order as it pertains to programmatic\n\nenhancement of Jackson State.60\n\n     Private plaintiffs also argue that the district court\n\nclearly erred in finding that problems with accreditation of\n\nprograms at the HBIs do not persist to the present.\n\n     Defendants contend that the traceability of mission\n\nassignments does not warrant institutional enhancement of the\n\nHBIs beyond that ordered by the district court, and that the\n\nrecord does not support general enhancement of these institutions\n\nas a desegregation tool.\n\n          c.   Analysis\n\n     The issue of programmatic enhancement directly implicates\n\npolicies governing institutional missions, which the district\n\ncourt found to be traceable to the de jure system and to have\n\ncurrent segregative effects.   Fordice mandates that the State\n\n\n     59\n        The United States in its brief argues that the district\ncourt should have ordered additional funding at the HBIs to,\namong other things, “improve the quality of existing programs.”\nU.S. Br. at 44. Except for specific issues (such as, for\nexample, program accreditation and faculty salaries) that we have\naddressed elsewhere in this opinion, the general issue of program\nquality is not briefed and we therefore do not address it.\n     60\n        The parties’ arguments concerning the land grant\nprograms in particular are discussed in Part III.B.3 infra.\n\n                                  61\n\feliminate such vestiges of the prior system to the extent\n\npracticable and consistent with sound educational practices.\n\nThis is a substantial burden; accordingly, to the extent that the\n\nrecord indicates that the State could practicably take steps to\n\ndesegregate that do not run afoul of sound educational practices,\n\nthe State has a duty to do so and the remedial decree should so\n\nreflect.\n\n     Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the\n\ndistrict court’s finding that “merely adding programs and\n\nincreasing budgets” is not likely to desegregate an HBI, Ayers\n\nII, 879 F. Supp. at 1491, is supported by the evidence and is not\n\nclearly erroneous.   There was testimony that the Louisiana\n\nexperience with implementation of a consent decree to desegregate\n\npublic institutions of higher education was not successful in\n\nattracting white students to historically black universities,\n\ndespite investment of over $75 million in new academic programs\n\nat those universities.   The evidence showed that there was no\n\ncorrelation between dollars expended on new program\n\nimplementation and white enrollment in those programs.   During\n\nthe six years (1981-87) that the Louisiana consent decree was in\n\neffect, white enrollment in predominantly black universities\n\nincreased by just 1.1%, while black enrollment in predominantly\n\nwhite universities decreased from 56% to 47% of black enrollment\n\nin the system as a whole.61\n\n     61\n        Cf.

In its discussion of Mississippi Valley\n\nState in the context of the proposed merger with Delta State, the\n\ncourt stated that “evidence suggests that HBIs in other formally\n\nde jure segregated states have been successful in integrating\n\ntheir student bodies through a variety of approaches and\n\nmeasures.”   Id.   Indeed, evidence presented by the United States\n\nand defendants indicates that well-planned programs that respond\n\nto the particular needs and interests of local populations can\n\nhelp to desegregate historically black institutions.   Witnesses\n\nfor both parties testified that programs not duplicated at\n\nproximate institutions, targeted to local demands, and in many\n\ncases offered through alternative delivery systems (such as off-\n\ncampus, evening, or weekend programs) have had success in\n\nattracting white students to historically black institutions in\n\nother states.\n\n     Consistent with its findings regarding the potential to\n\ndesegregate Mississippi Valley State, the district court stated\n\n\nduring the term of the consent decree: the predominantly white\ninstitutions had about 2000 fewer black students in 1987 than in\n1981, while the predominantly black institutions showed only a\nnegligible increase in white enrollment from around 0.3% in 1981\nto around 1.1% in 1987.”). According to the three-judge court\nthat reviewed the special master’s final report in the Louisiana\ncase, “[t]he experience of the consent decree confirms that\nenhancement of [predominantly black institutions] without more\nsimply makes [predominantly black institutions] more attractive\nto black students, without attracting white students.” United\nStates v.

This directive, however, was not incorporated into the\n\nremedial decree.     This may be explained by the fact that the\n\nfuture of Mississippi Valley State was uncertain at the time the\n\ndistrict court drafted its opinion.     Under the remedial decree,\n\nmerger with DSU remained a possibility that depended upon the\n\nBoard’s study of options for desegregating the Delta region.       We\n\ncannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in\n\nfailing to order the above relief when the very existence of\n\nMississippi Valley State as an independent institution remained\n\nin question.     At present, however, all parties apparently have\n\nconcluded that merger of Mississippi Valley State with Delta\n\nState is neither required nor desired.62    On remand, the district\n\ncourt must clarify the status of the merger proposal.     If the\n\ndistrict court confirms that merger will no longer be pursued,\n\nthen the district court must address the continuing segregative\n\neffects of Mississippi Valley State’s limited mission and\n\nincorporate into its remedial decree a provision requiring the\n\nBoard, on a continuing basis, to study and report to the\n\n     62\n        Counsel for defendants stated at oral argument before\nthis court that defendants had publicly announced that they were\nno longer pursuing merger. In its brief, the United States\nexpressed unqualified support for the district court’s rejection\nof the merger proposal. Private plaintiffs’ argument for\nenhancement of Mississippi Valley State likewise indicates their\nopposition to merger.\n\n                                  64\n\fMonitoring Committee on new academic programs that have a\n\nreasonable chance of increasing other-race presence at\n\nMississippi Valley State.\n\n     Plaintiffs’ contention that the district court was required\n\nto order further relief at Alcorn State is less persuasive, at\n\nleast as it addresses the short term.   We are not persuaded that\n\nfurther relief is warranted on the basis of the MBA program’s\n\nlocation away from the main campus at Natchez; plaintiffs’ own\n\nexpert testified that off-campus offerings are among those\n\ninitiatives that have been successful at attracting other-race\n\nstudents to historically black institutions.   Nor are we\n\npersuaded that the State’s prior commitment to funding the Small\n\nFarm Development Center necessitates the order of additional\n\nrelief; this fact does not implicate the Fordice standard for\n\nremedial relief.   The record does suggest, however, that measures\n\nthat have been successful in desegregating historically black\n\ninstitutions in other states may have potential over the longer\n\nterm to be effective also at Alcorn State.   We see no reason, in\n\nlight of the traceability of the HBIs’ limited missions and of\n\ntheir continuing racial identifiability, to limit continuing\n\nstudy of new academic programs with desegregative potential to\n\nJackson State.   The district court should have incorporated such\n\nrelief with respect to Alcorn State into the remedial decree.\n\n     We recognize that substantial evidence indicates that\n\nefforts to desegregate an HBI can succeed only insofar as they\n\ntap into locale-specific demands.    Any such inherent limitation\n\n\n                                65\n\fon the potential to achieve desegregation in the university\n\ncontext may underlie some of the district court’s findings and\n\nsuggests that implementation of unique, high demand programs that\n\ncan reasonably be expected to attract white students to HBIs may\n\nultimately turn out to be quite modest.\n\n     Private plaintiffs’ argument that the district court clearly\n\nerred in finding no present neglect by the State with respect to\n\naccreditation of programs at the HBIs is unavailing.   The\n\ndistrict court’s finding of substantial increases in the\n\npercentage of programs accredited at all universities is\n\nsupported by the record, and private plaintiffs do not identify\n\nany present policy that currently hinders accreditation of\n\nprograms at the HBIs.\n\n     Private plaintiffs’ accreditation concerns are relevant,\n\nhowever, to one aspect of the district court’s remedial decree.\n\nThe doctoral program in business that the court ordered at\n\nJackson State is not to be implemented until existing business\n\nprograms are accredited, and the record indicates that despite\n\nthe Board’s goal of achieving accreditation for these programs,\n\nset forth as early as 1974 in the Board’s plan of compliance with\n\nTitle VI, it has not yet been accomplished.   The record is not\n\nclear as to the reasons that these programs are not yet\n\naccredited.   In the interest of ensuring that the district\n\ncourt’s order concerning the doctoral program in business be\n\ngiven meaningful effect, the district court on remand should\n\ninquire into present efforts to achieve accreditation of Jackson\n\n\n                                66\n\fState’s business programs and order any relief that is\n\nappropriate with respect to the Board.\n\n            d.   Conclusions regarding new academic programs\n\n     We affirm the portions of the remedial decree addressing the\n\naddition of new academic programs at Jackson State and Alcorn\n\nState.    We direct the district court on remand to clarify the\n\nstatus of the Board’s proposal to merge Mississippi Valley State\n\nwith Delta State.    If the district court confirms that merger\n\nwill no longer be pursued, it should incorporate into the\n\nremedial decree a provision directing the Board to study and to\n\nreport to the Monitoring Committee on whether there are any new\n\nacademic programs, including programs which have had success in\n\ndesegregating other systems of higher education, that may have a\n\nreasonable chance of success in desegregating Mississippi Valley\n\nState.    We further remand for incorporation into the remedial\n\ndecree of a similar provision directed to Alcorn State covering\n\nnew academic and land grant programs.    On the issue of\n\naccreditation, the district court should determine the status of\n\ncurrent efforts to achieve accreditation of existing business\n\nprograms at Jackson State and order appropriate relief, if\n\nnecessary, to ensure that the Board is taking steps commensurate\n\nwith its role in this accreditation process.\n\n     3.     Land Grant Programs\n\n            a.   District court ruling\n\n     Mississippi State University and Alcorn State University are\n\n\n\n\n                                  67\n\fMississippi’s two public land grant institutions.63    As found by\n\nthe district court, the traditional elements of the land grant\n\nfunction consist of residential instruction, agricultural\n\nresearch (including an experiment station), and an extension\n\nservice.64   Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1464.   The district court\n\nfound that during the de jure period the State consistently\n\ndirected federal and state land grant funds toward Mississippi\n\nState University rather than Alcorn State.     Id. at 1464-65.\n\nSpecifically, Mississippi directed all federal funding for\n\nagricultural research under the Hatch Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 361a-361i,\n\nand all federal funding for extension services to farmers under\n\nthe Smith-Lever Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 341-349, to Mississippi State,65\n\nwhile Alcorn State received federal funding only under an 1890\n\nfederal statute providing funds for black land grant colleges.\n\n     63\n        “A land grant institution is defined as a college\nuniversity [sic] entitled to financial and programmatic support\nfrom the federal government pursuant to a series of statutes\noriginating with the Morrill Acts enacted by Congress in 1862 and\n1890.” Ayers I, 674 F. Supp. at 1543. The Morrill Act of 1862\nand subsequent statutes “defined the land grant college to be an\ninstitution that provides instruction in agriculture and\nmechanical arts, research in agriculture through the experimental\nstations, and extension of knowledge to farmers through\ncooperative extension programs.” Id.\n     64\n        Cooperative extension is a joint effort of the federal\ngovernment, land grant institutions, and county governments to\ntransfer knowledge to farmers and assist in the development of\nfarm operations. Ayers I, 674 F. Supp. at 1545. Cooperative\nextension originated with the Smith-Lever Act of 1914, 7 U.S.C.\n§§ 341-349, and is jointly financed by federal, state, and county\ngovernments. Ayers I, 674 F. Supp. at 1545.\n     65\n        Although the district court made no specific finding in\nthis regard, the evidence indicates that matching state funds\nwere directed to Mississippi State along with the Hatch and\nSmith-Lever federal appropriations.\n\n                                 68\n\fAyers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1464.     As a result, Mississippi State\n\nenjoys land grant activities of much greater size and breadth\n\nthan Alcorn State.   Id. at 1466.      The district court found that\n\n“[o]peration and maintenance of two racially identifiable land\n\ngrant programs are traceable to de jure segregation and have\n\nsegregative effects.”    Id. at 1477.\n\n     The court made findings with respect to each of the\n\ntraditional land grant functions.      The court found that the\n\nquality of residential instruction is directly and positively\n\naffected by agricultural research conducted on the campus of a\n\nland grant institution, which is more extensive at Mississippi\n\nState than at Alcorn State due to Mississippi State’s broader\n\nresearch mission.    Id. at 1464, 1466.    Turning to agricultural\n\nresearch, the court found:\n\n          With little or no exception, federal Hatch Act\n     dollars are administered in every state by a single\n     institution. In this time of fewer and fewer persons\n     entering the field of agriculture, but the system\n     nevertheless effectively feeding more and more people,\n     it would be inefficient and, thus, educationally\n     unsound to administer two separate agricultural\n     research programs in the state. To diffuse the program\n     would create two separate administrative entities,\n     difficulties in communication among the participating\n     scientists, and inefficient duplication.\n\nId. at 1465.\n\n     Similarly, the court found that it would be unsound to\n\nadminister federal funds for cooperative extension work through\n\ntwo independent cooperative extension programs:\n\n          The general rule of practice is that Smith-Lever\n     funds are administered by only one university in each\n     state. . . . To duplicate administrative processes and\n     procedures as it relates to the delivery of extension\n\n                                  69\n\f     programming is unsound because the short duration of\n     extension educational programs makes program\n     coordination difficult from year to year.\n\nId. at 1465-66.\n\n     Although the court found that “the operation of two racially\n\nidentifiable land grant institutions might continue to have some\n\nsegregative effects that would be minuscule because of the small\n\nnumber of students now majoring in agriculture,” id. at 1484, it\n\nconcluded that “[t]he current allocation of agricultural\n\neducation programs is educationally sound and there exists no\n\npractical alternative to the current method of providing research\n\nand extension services.”     Id. at 1466.   With the exception of a\n\nspecial funding allocation for the Small Farm Development Center\n\nat Alcorn State, the remedial decree did not mandate any changes\n\nin current land grant policies or practices.      See id. at 1494-96.\n\n          b.      Arguments on appeal\n\n     The United States argues that “the court erred as a matter\n\nof law when it failed to evaluate alternative proposals for\n\nchanges in the allocation of land grant programs short of\n\ndividing the land grant programs equally between the 2\n\ninstitutions.”    U.S. Br. at 47.    The United States further\n\ncontends that to the extent the district court’s conclusion that\n\nthere are no practical alternatives to the current method of\n\nproviding research and extension services “is a finding that\n\nthere are no educationally sound alternatives to the present\n\nallocation of programs, that finding is clearly erroneous.”      Id.\n\nPrivate plaintiffs advance similar arguments.      Both the United\n\n\n                                    70\n\fStates and private plaintiffs cite evidence that there are unmet\n\nneeds in Mississippi for new land grant programs, such as water\n\nquality, that could be met at Alcorn State.\n\n       Defendants argue that the district court correctly found\n\nthat any segregative effects associated with the operation of two\n\nracially identifiable land grant institutions could not be\n\nremedied consistent with sound educational practices.    Defendants\n\nfurther contend that the addition of agricultural programs at\n\nAlcorn State will not contribute to desegregation.\n\n            c.   Analysis\n\n       The district court’s finding that it would be impractical\n\nand educationally unsound to alter the current method of\n\nproviding research and extension services is well supported by\n\nexpert testimony in the record.    As the district court found, the\n\nprimary source of federal funds for agricultural research is the\n\nHatch Act, and for cooperative extension funds the Smith-Lever\n\nAct.    Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1464.   Substantial evidence\n\nindicates that federal (and matching state) funds appropriated\n\nthrough these acts typically are administered by a single\n\ninstitution in each state and that it would be unsound to\n\nadminister in Mississippi either two separate research programs\n\nwith Hatch funds or two separate extension programs with Smith-\n\nLever funds.\n\n       Contrary to the suggestion of plaintiffs, the district court\n\nopinion does not limit its consideration of changes in the\n\nallocation of research and extension funds to “equally” dividing\n\n\n                                  71\n\fsuch funds between Mississippi State and Alcorn State.    While the\n\ncourt recognized that it would be inappropriate to break up the\n\nacademic and research facilities at Mississippi State and Alcorn\n\nState and divide them “equally” between educational institutions\n\nsolely on the basis of Alcorn State’s heretofore restricted\n\ndevelopment, see id. at 1466, this statement reflects a legal\n\nstandard rather than a finding drawn from the evidence on\n\npracticability or educational soundness.    The evidence led the\n\ndistrict court to conclude more generally that “[t]he current\n\nallocation of agricultural education programs is educationally\n\nsound and there exists no practical alternative to the current\n\nmethod of providing research and extension services.”    Id.66\n\nPlaintiffs’ argument that the district court should have\n\nconsidered alternatives other than an “equal” division of land\n\ngrant programs accordingly is without merit.\n\n     We read the district court’s conclusion that it would be\n\nimpractical and educationally unsound to change the current\n\npractice of administering research and extension services\n\nprimarily through Mississippi State to be limited to research and\n\nextension services funded through the Hatch and Smith-Lever Acts,\n\nas those statutes are now configured.   Significantly, we do not\n\nread the district court opinion to preclude future implementation\n\nof land grant programs at Alcorn State.    Instead, the district\n\n     66\n        The district court similarly stated that “[t]he evidence\npreponderates toward the conclusion that dividing the roles\nwithin the extension arena between two universities rather than\nas it is currently conducted is not an educationally sound\nalternative.” Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1484.\n\n                               72\n\fcourt’s implicit decision not to order implementation at this\n\ntime at Alcorn State of a program in water quality or any other\n\nland grant program offered by plaintiffs reflects the lack of\n\nsufficient definition of any of these programs in this record.\n\nThe addition to the remedial decree, see Part III.B.2.d supra, of\n\na provision directing the Board, on a continuing basis, to study\n\nand to report to the Monitoring Committee on programs that have a\n\nreasonable chance of increasing other-race presence at Alcorn\n\nState encompasses land grant programs as well as new academic\n\nprograms and permits further study of the programs proposed by\n\nplaintiffs.\n\n           d.   Conclusions regarding land grant programs\n\n     We affirm the district court’s ruling as it concerns land\n\ngrant functions at Mississippi State and Alcorn State.\n\n     4.    Duplication of Programs\n\n           a.   Fordice\n\n     Program duplication was one of the four remnants of the de\n\njure system identified by the Supreme Court in Fordice.     505 U.S.\n\nat 738.   Following the 1987 trial, the district court found\n\nsignificant duplication of programs at the HBIs by the HWIs,\n\nAyers I, 674 F. Supp. at 1541, but concluded that “there is no\n\nproof” that such duplication “is directly associated with the\n\nracial identifiability of institutions,” and that “there is no\n\nproof that the elimination of unnecessary program duplication\n\nwould be justifiable from an educational standpoint or that its\n\nelimination would have a substantial effect on student choice.”\n\n\n                                73\n\fId. at 1561.    The Supreme Court stated that “[i]t can hardly be\n\ndenied that such duplication was part and parcel of the prior\n\ndual system of higher education -- the whole notion of ‘separate\n\nbut equal’ required duplicative programs in two sets of schools -\n\n- and that the present unnecessary duplication is a continuation\n\nof that practice.”    Fordice, 505 U.S. at 738.   The Court\n\nemphasized that the State bears the burden of proving that\n\npresent-day program duplication is not constitutionally defective\n\nand held that the district court had improperly shifted the\n\nburden to plaintiffs.    Id.   The Court indicated that, on remand,\n\nthe district court should “consider the combined effects of\n\nunnecessary program duplication with other policies, such as\n\ndifferential admissions standards, in evaluating whether the\n\nState had met its duty to dismantle its prior de jure segregated\n\nsystem.”   Id. at 739.\n\n           b.    District court ruling\n\n     The alleged remnant presented by plaintiffs to the district\n\ncourt on remand was “[t]he policy and practice of unnecessarily\n\nduplicating HBIs’ programs and course offerings at HWIs.”       Ayers\n\nII, 879 F. Supp. at 1498, 1502.    The district court defined\n\n“unnecessary duplication” as “‘those instances where two or more\n\ninstitutions offer the same nonessential or noncore program.’”\n\nId. at 1441 (quoting Ayers I, 674 F. Supp. at 1540).     “‘Under\n\nthis definition, all duplication at the bachelors level of\n\nnonbasic liberal arts and sciences course work and all\n\nduplication at the masters level and above are considered to be\n\n\n                                  74\n\funnecessary.’”   Id.\n\n     The district court found that 40% of the noncore bachelors\n\nprograms offered at one or more of the three HBIs are\n\nunnecessarily duplicated at one or more of the five HWIs; 83% of\n\nthe masters programs offered at one or more of the HBIs are\n\nunnecessarily duplicated at one or more of the five HWIs; 60% of\n\nthe specialist programs offered at one or more of the HBIs are\n\nunnecessarily duplicated at one or more of the five HWIs; and 25%\n\nof the doctoral programs offered at one or more of the HBIs are\n\nunnecessarily duplicated at one or more of the five HWIs.      Id. at\n\n1443.   As a group, the HWIs have significantly more high demand,\n\nnoncore programs that are not duplicated anywhere else in the\n\nsystem as compared with the HBIs as a group.    Id. at 1442.\n\n     Analyzing program duplication in general, the district court\n\nfound that the joint operation of duplicative offerings between\n\nracially identifiable institutions and differential admissions\n\nstandards “raises a serious inference that this duplication\n\ncontinues to promote segregation.”    Id. at 1445.   The court drew\n\na distinction, however, between proximate and nonproximate\n\ninstitutions in making more specific findings on the question of\n\nsegregative effect.    The court concluded that only program\n\nduplication between proximate, racially identifiable institutions\n\nwas traceable to de jure segregation and had segregative effects.\n\nId. at 1477, 1486.\n\n     The court addressed two instances of program duplication\n\nbetween proximate, racially identifiable institutions.     First,\n\n\n                                 75\n\fin its remedial decree, the district court ordered the Board to\n\n“take whatever remaining steps are necessary, if any, to vest\n\ncomplete institutional control in JSU over the facility formerly\n\nknown as the Universities Center in JSU.”     Id. at 1495.   The\n\nUniversities Center, located in Jackson, consisted of extension\n\nprograms operated by various HWIs.     Ayers I, 674 F. Supp. at\n\n1542.   In 1972 the Board voted to assign management\n\nresponsibilities for the Universities Center to Mississippi\n\nState, the University of Mississippi, and Jackson State.      Id.     At\n\nthe trials in 1987 and 1994, plaintiffs identified continued\n\noperation of these extension programs in close proximity with\n\nJackson State as a vestige of the de jure system.      The district\n\ncourt’s order eliminates whatever competition for enrollment the\n\nUniversities Center fostered with respect to Jackson State.\n\n     Second, the court considered program duplication between\n\nMississippi Valley State and Delta State, which are proximate,\n\nracially identifiable institutions in the Delta.    The district\n\ncourt found that\n\n     [b]ecause of the proximity of these institutions\n     (approximately 35 miles apart) and the similar scope of\n     their missions, (liberal arts undergraduate\n     institutions) [sic] location, costs and program\n     offerings would not appear to have a significant impact\n     on student choice. Rather, lower admissions standards\n     at MVSU appear more likely to attract black students of\n     the Delta region, since as a class black students score\n     lower on the standardized tests used for admission to\n     universities. In light of differing admissions\n     standards, it is clear that program duplication between\n     these two universities does foster segregation.\n\nAyers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1486.    The district court noted that\n\nmerger of Mississippi Valley State and Delta State would\n\n                                  76\n\feliminate segregative duplication, id. at 1486, 1489, but\n\nrejected the Board’s merger proposal for a number of other\n\nreasons.    See id. at 1491-92.   In so doing, the court indicated\n\nthat measures “less drastic” than merger should be considered.\n\nId. at 1492.    In its conclusions of law, the district court\n\nstated that “the Board must study program duplication between DSU\n\nand MVSU to determine whether any segregative duplication may be\n\neliminated consistent with sound educational practices.”        Id. at\n\n1494.   Neither this directive nor any other remedy pertaining to\n\ndecreasing program duplication with respect to Mississippi Valley\n\nState, however, was incorporated into the remedial decree.\n\n      Turning to program duplication between nonproximate\n\ninstitutions, the district court found that “it has not been\n\nestablished that program duplication between non-proximate\n\nracially identifiable universities significantly fosters\n\nsegregation.”    Id. at 1486.   The court found that factors\n\naffecting student choice included location, academic reputation,\n\nand prestige, none of which is implicated by program duplication.\n\nId.   Noting that admissions standards help to shape public\n\nperceptions of an institution, the court found that “[t]he\n\nconsistently lower admissions standards in effect at the HBIs\n\nhave perpetuated the perception that these institutions are\n\ninferior.   Accordingly, the likelihood of significant\n\ndesegregation of HBIs is small and confined to those students who\n\nare academically underprepared.”       Id.   The court concluded that\n\nabsent differences in “prestige or public image,” unnecessary\n\n\n                                  77\n\fduplication “has little to do with student choice.”      Id.     Program\n\nduplication is most likely to influence students who are not\n\nplace-bound and who have the greatest flexibility in choosing an\n\ninstitution.     Id.67\n\n      The court concluded that “[s]ystem-wide admissions\n\nstandards, coupled with the financial and programmatic\n\nenhancements of JSU and ASU, realistically promise to obviate or\n\nlessen whatever segregative effects are potentially harbored by\n\nthe duplication between racially identifiable non-proximate\n\ninstitutions.”     Id.   In addition, the court found that the\n\nBoard’s existing process for reviewing programs is an\n\neducationally sound method of managing duplication in the system.\n\nId.   Under this process, Board staff consults with university\n\nofficials whenever a program’s enrollment or graduation rates\n\ndrop below a certain level predetermined by the Board.       The\n\nuniversity is then given an opportunity to justify continuation\n\nof the program despite its deficiencies.      Id. at 1443.\n\n      Although the court indicated that uniform admissions,\n\nprogrammatic enhancements, and the Board’s program review\n\nprocedures would adequately mitigate any potential segregative\n\neffects of program duplication between nonproximate institutions,\n\nit ordered the Board to study program duplication with respect to\n\n\n      67\n        Elsewhere, the district court found that operation of\nAlcorn State and Mississippi State, which are nonproximate,\nracially identifiable, land grant institutions, “might continue\nto have some segregative effects that would be minuscule because\nof the small number of students now majoring in agriculture.”\nAyers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1484.\n\n                                   78\n\fJackson State.    The Board is to undertake this as part of a\n\ngeneral study:\n\n          4. The Board shall undertake an on-site\n     institutional study of JSU to determine the relative\n     strengths and weaknesses of its existing programs as\n     soon as is practicable. . . . The nature and extent of\n     duplication with other institutions in the system will\n     be addressed in this study in the context of\n     determining whether meaningful programmatic uniqueness\n     may be gained which would bring about significant white\n     enrollment through elimination and/or transfer of\n     existing programs at other institutions and the\n     feasibility/educational soundness of such elimination\n     and/or transfer.\n\nId. at 1494-95.\n\n          c.      Arguments on appeal\n\n     The United States argues that the district court erred in\n\nfailing to order the Board “to undertake a system-wide effort to\n\nreduce program duplication and to increase the numbers of unique\n\nhigh demand offerings at the [HBIs].”   U.S. Br. at 47-48.   The\n\nUnited States’s argument on this issue continues, in its\n\nentirety, as follows:\n\n     The court’s finding that duplication between\n     nonproximate institutions does not cause segregation\n     contains no citations or references to record evidence,\n     and appears to be based upon its findings that other\n     factors, such as location, affect student choice,\n     rather than any evidence that duplication does not\n     affect choice. Again, the court impermissibly placed\n     the burden of proof on the plaintiffs, rather than on\n     the defendants. And its finding that the Board’s\n     existing program review process is adequate to\n     eliminate any segregative effect of duplication, is\n     clearly erroneous, since that process is not triggered\n     by the existence of duplication or the need to promote\n     desegregation.\n\nId. at 48 (citations omitted).    Private plaintiffs do not raise\n\nthe issue of program duplication on appeal.\n\n\n                                  79\n\f            d.   Analysis\n\n     No party contests the district court’s finding that program\n\nduplication between proximate racially identifiable institutions\n\nis traceable to de jure segregation and continues to have\n\nsegregative effects.    We therefore accept this finding as\n\nsupported by the record and conclude that the United States’s\n\nargument as it applies to Mississippi Valley State is well taken.\n\nThe district court itself stated that it would order a study of\n\nprogram duplication between Mississippi Valley State and Delta\n\nState, see Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1494, yet failed to\n\nincorporate any such provision into the remedial decree.      Again,\n\nthe omission may have been occasioned by the continuing\n\npossibility that Mississippi Valley State would be merged with\n\nDelta State.     See Part III.B.2.c supra.   We cannot conclude that\n\nthe district court abused its discretion in failing to order a\n\nstudy of program duplication at Mississippi Valley State when the\n\ncontinued existence of Mississippi Valley State remained in\n\nquestion.    However, upon conclusion of the inquiry we have\n\nordered above, if the district court confirms that merger will no\n\nlonger be pursued, then the district court must incorporate into\n\nits remedial decree a provision requiring the Board to study and\n\nreport to the Monitoring Committee on unnecessary program\n\nduplication between Mississippi Valley State and Delta State.68\n\n     68\n        As we noted in our discussion of new academic programs,\nPart III.B.2.b supra, the specific relief requested by the United\nStates on appeal with respect to enhancement of the HBIs is an\norder requiring the Board to study and report to the Monitoring\nCommittee on actions that could make the HBIs more attractive to\n\n                                  80\n\f     The United States’s argument as it applies to nonproximate\n\ninstitutions, on the other hand, is not briefed sufficiently for\n\nthis court to review this aspect of the district court’s ruling\n\nfor error.    Cf. Cinel v. Connick, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662444\"><a href=\"/opinion/662444/dino-cinel-v-harry-f-connick-individually-and-as-district-attorney-for/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1338</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1345 (5th Cir.),\n\ncert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">868</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1994)(“A party who inadequately\n\nbriefs an issue is considered to have abandoned the claim.”).    It\n\nis of no consequence that the district court did not cite to the\n\nrecord in the portion of its opinion addressing the potential\n\nsegregative effects of program duplication in nonproximate\n\ninstitutions.   While citations to the record are helpful, and we\n\ncommend the district court for its abundant documentation of the\n\nrecord throughout its opinion as a whole, the district court is\n\nnot required to provide them.   Significantly, the United States\n\ndoes not contend that the court’s finding of no segregative\n\neffect in the context of nonproximate institutions is clearly\n\nerroneous.\n\n     The United States argues, rather, that the court\n\nimpermissibly shifted the burden of proof on this issue to the\n\nplaintiffs.   While the court’s language might suggest imposition\n\nof the burden of proof on plaintiffs (“it has not been\n\nestablished that program duplication between non-proximate\n\nracially identifiable universities significantly fosters\n\nsegregation”), its reasoning indicates reliance not on the\n\nabsence of evidence of segregative effect, but rather on the\n\n\nwhite students. In light of this request and the structure of\nthe remedial decree, where we have ordered relief in the\nenhancement area, we have done so in those terms.\n\n                                 81\n\fpresence of evidence that factors other than duplicative program\n\nofferings have a more significant effect on student choice.      We\n\nare not persuaded that the court erred in its allocation of the\n\nburden of proof.\n\n     The United States’s argument that the district court’s\n\nfinding “that the Board’s existing program review process is\n\nadequate to eliminate any segregative effect of duplication is\n\nclearly erroneous” mischaracterizes the district court’s finding.\n\nThe court found that “the Board’s program review process is an\n\neducationally sound way of managing duplication in the system.”\n\nAyers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1486.    This finding is supported in the\n\nrecord and makes no pretense of disposing of the issue of\n\npotential segregative effects.    The court went on to conclude\n\nthat “[s]ystem-wide admissions standards, coupled with the\n\nfinancial and programmatic enhancements of JSU and ASU,\n\nrealistically promise to obviate or lessen whatever segregative\n\neffects are potentially harbored by the duplication between\n\nracially identifiable non-proximate institutions.”      Id.   We note\n\nthat even in light of this conclusion, the district court did\n\norder a study of program duplication at Jackson State to\n\ndetermine if elimination or transfer of programs at other\n\ninstitutions might help attract white students to Jackson State.\n\nId. at 1495.\n\n          e.   Conclusions regarding program duplication\n\n     We affirm the district court’s findings and conclusions on\n\nthe issue of program duplication.      If, on remand, the district\n\n\n                                  82\n\fcourt confirms that the merger of Mississippi Valley State and\n\nDelta State will no longer be pursued, the district court should\n\nincorporate into its remedial decree a provision requiring the\n\nBoard to study and to report to the Monitoring Committee on\n\nunnecessary program duplication between Mississippi Valley State\n\nand Delta State.\n\n     5.    Funding\n\n           a.   District court ruling\n\n     Mississippi’s eight universities receive state funding\n\nthrough both an annual legislative general support appropriation\n\nand line item appropriations.    The universities also rely on\n\nself-generated funds, which include private contributions as well\n\nas federal grants and loans.    See id. at 1446-53; Ayers I, 674 F.\n\nSupp. at 1546-48.    In its overall findings of liability, the\n\ndistrict court concluded that “[f]unding policies and practices\n\nfollow the mission assignments and, to that degree only, are\n\ntraceable to prior de jure segregation.”    Ayers II, 879 F. Supp.\n\nat 1477.   We discuss each source of state funding and the\n\nrelevant findings of the district court in turn.\n\n     The Board is responsible for allocating the legislative\n\ngeneral support appropriation among the universities.    Beginning\n\nin 1974, the Board utilized a funding formula that allocated this\n\nfunding to the universities in accordance with their mission\n\ndesignations.   In November of 1987, following the first trial,\n\nthe Board adopted a new funding formula under which level of\n\nfunding is determined by the size of a university’s enrollment,\n\n\n                                 83\n\ffaculty, and physical plant.    Id. at 1449 & n.122.   The 1987\n\nfunding formula consists of eight components:    instruction,\n\nresearch, public service, academic support, student services,\n\ninstitutional support, operation and maintenance, and\n\nscholarships and fellowships.    Id. at 1447.   By far the largest\n\nof these components is instruction, which accounted for more than\n\n58% of the total budget in fiscal year 1994-95.     Id.   The general\n\nsupport appropriation does not include funds for capital\n\nimprovements.    Id.\n\n     The district court found that\n\n     because the size of the university’s enrollment\n     determines the level of funding, the larger\n     institutions with the highest percentage of upper level\n     programs obtain the greatest amount of funding. This\n     causes practically the same result as under the\n     previous formula that funded by institutional mission\n     designation.\n\nId. at 1449.    Stated differently, the court found that “the\n\nhistorical disparity in funding between the HWIs and HBIs once\n\npracticed by law persists through perpetuation of the status quo\n\nas it existed then.”    Id. at 1452-53.   The court concluded,\n\nhowever, that\n\n          [c]urrent policies and practices governing funding\n     of institutions are lawful. There is no per se funding\n     policy or practice traceable to the de jure era.\n     Attainment of funding “equity” between the HBIs and\n     HWIs is impractical and educationally unsound. It can\n     neither be attained within our lifetime nor . . . does\n     it realistically promise to guarantee further\n     desegregation given the present institutional\n     landscape. The testimony showed that the formula is\n     largely geared to funding the students without\n     consideration of race at whichever institution the\n     students choose to attend and at the program level the\n     students choose. Accordingly, the court finds that the\n     funding formula should not be altered.\n\n                                 84\n\fId. at 1453.\n\n     Line item appropriations fund specific activities and\n\nprograms offered at the public universities.       Capital\n\nimprovements and repair and renovation of existing facilities are\n\nfunded through a combination of line item appropriations and\n\nself-generated funds.   The district court found that line item\n\nfunding accounts for a “substantial” share of total state\n\nappropriations for institutions of higher education and\n\ncontributes “significantly” to the quality of any given\n\ninstitution.   Id. at 1451.\n\n     The district court found that, in general, line item funding\n\n“disproportionately flows to the HWIs.”    Id.     In the context of\n\ncapital improvements and repair and renovation, however, the\n\ncourt concluded that funding policies and practices do not follow\n\nthe mission assignments and are not traceable to de jure\n\nsegregation.   Id. at 1477.   Although the State provided new\n\nconstruction funds disproportionately to the HWIs during the late\n\n1960s, figures from 1970 through 1994 indicate that the HBIs\n\nreceived a percentage of capital improvements funds that exceeded\n\ntheir percentage of systemwide enrollment.       Id. at 1454.69\n\n     69\n        From 1970 through 1980, when the HBIs had approximately\n25% of the total systemwide enrollment, the HBIs received 39% of\nthe state appropriations for new construction. From 1981 until\n1994, the HBIs averaged 22% of systemwide enrollment yet obtained\n32% of total funding available for capital improvements. Ayers\nII, 879 F. Supp. at 1454; see also Ayers I, 674 F. Supp. at 1548-\n49.\n\n     We note that these findings appear to conflict with evidence\ncredited by the district court that no HBI received a line item\nappropriation until 1993. See Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1451.\n\n                                 85\n\f     The district court made distinct findings with respect to\n\nlibrary allocations and equipment availability.      The court found\n\nthat the library collections of the HWIs have been consistently\n\nsuperior to those of the HBIs for the past 40 years, and that the\n\nphysical space of the HBIs’ libraries is “of a lesser quality\n\noverall” than that of the HWIs’ libraries.       Id. at 1456-57.   The\n\ncourt likewise found that investment in equipment at the HWIs\n\nexceeded that provided to the HBIs during the de jure era and\n\nthat, currently, the quality of fixed equipment at the HBIs is\n\ninferior to that at the HWIs.     Id. at 1457.   The court concluded\n\nthat “[p]olicies and practices governing equipment availability\n\nand library allocations follow the mission assignments and, to\n\nthat degree, are traceable to de jure segregation.”       Id. at 1477.\n\n     As to the present segregative effects of library and\n\nequipment funding policies, the district court found generally\n\nthat “[t]he nature and condition of facilities of a campus are\n\nfactors that influence student choice in deciding where to attend\n\ncollege.”    Id. at 1457.   With respect to equipment in particular,\n\nthe court found that “[t]he quality and type of equipment\n\navailable on a campus is important from the student’s standpoint\n\nin terms of adequately preparing the student to enter the job\n\nmarket.”    Id.   As to libraries, the court recognized that, as\n\npart of an institution’s image, the library “plays a part in the\n\nrecruitment of students and faculty,” id. at 1456, but also found\n\n\nNo party, however, challenges either finding, and resolution of\nthis apparent discrepancy is not essential to our ruling on the\nissue of funding.\n\n                                  86\n\fthat “the number of books in the library is [not] a significant\n\nfeature of a university that influences student choice of where\n\nto attend.”    Id. at 1457.   In light of these findings, the court\n\nultimately concluded that “increasing the size of the HBIs’\n\nlibraries beyond that consistent with their missions is not\n\neducationally sound.”    Id. at 1458.   The court found it\n\nsignificant that the libraries at Alcorn State and Jackson State\n\nare presently undergoing expansion.     Id.70\n\n     The remedial decree orders the State to provide special\n\nfunds to both Jackson State and Alcorn State in addition to the\n\nfunds necessary for the programmatic additions outlined\n\nearlier.71    At Jackson State, the State is to provide, per Board\n\nproposal over a five-year period, up to $15 million earmarked for\n\nproperty acquisition, campus entrances, campus security, and\n\ngrounds enhancement.    For the benefit of Jackson State and Alcorn\n\nState, respectively, the State is to establish two $5 million\n\nendowment trusts, “with the income therefrom to be used to\n\nprovide funds for continuing educational enhancement and racial\n\ndiversity, including recruitment of white students and\n\nscholarships for white applicants in a number and an amount\n\n\n     70\n         The court found that the State legislature had recently\napproved a $12 million expansion of the library at Jackson State,\nalready underway at the time of the district court’s opinion.\nExpansion of the library at Alcorn State was also underway, with\n$3 million having already been invested. Ayers II, 879 F. Supp.\nat 1457.\n     71\n        The decree contains a general provision that orders the\nState to provide funding for all measures ordered therein. Ayers\nII, 879 F. Supp. at 1496.\n\n                                  87\n\fdetermined by the court upon recommendation from the Monitoring\n\nCommittee.”    Id. at 1495.72\n\n          b.     Arguments on appeal\n\n     Plaintiffs argue that the district court misapplied Fordice\n\nin concluding that “[t]here is no per se funding policy or\n\npractice traceable to the de jure era.”      Plaintiffs contend that\n\ndisparities in current funding are traceable to the de jure\n\nsystem, have discriminatory effects, and should be reformed to\n\nthe extent practicable and consistent with sound educational\n\npractices.\n\n     Plaintiffs also contend that the district court erred by\n\nfailing to consider adjustments to the funding formula to take\n\ninto account student financial need and the higher costs of\n\nremedial education, “or increases in funding to the [HBIs] to aid\n\nthem in overcoming the cumulative effects of decades of\n\nunderfunding.”    U.S. Br. at 44.73    Plaintiffs specifically\n\nrequest funding to enhance existing facilities, including\n\n     72\n        The court found that “the endowment for JSU . . . and\nthe funds proposed to be set aside to purchase adjoining land are\nsound steps toward correcting JSU’s image.” Ayers II, 879 F.\nSupp. at 1485. Likewise, the court found that “the proposed\nfunding for the small farm development center and the proposed\nendowment . . . promise realistically to solve ASU’s other-race\npresence problems and is [sic] otherwise educationally sound.”\nId. at 1486.\n     73\n        Plaintiffs suggest in their briefs that the district\ncourt erroneously focused solely on achieving funding “equity”\nbetween the HBIs and the HWIs. While the district court found\nthat “[a]ttainment of funding ‘equity’ between the HBIs and HWIs\nis impractical and educationally unsound,” Ayers II, 879 F. Supp.\nat 1453, the court did not purport to rely exclusively on this\nfinding for its determination that “the funding formula should\nnot be altered.” Id.\n\n                                  88\n\flibraries and equipment, at the HBIs.74\n\n     Defendants contend that the district court correctly found\n\nthat no current funding policy is traceable to de jure\n\nsegregation.   Moreover, defendants argue that the dedication of\n\nfunds for general institutional enhancement does not contribute\n\nto the desegregation of historically black institutions.\n\n          c.    Analysis\n\n     We find the district court’s ruling to be supported by the\n\nrecord and consistent with Fordice.   Fordice required the\n\ndistrict court to examine challenged policies and practices to\n\ndetermine if they had roots in the de jure era.   The district\n\ncourt correctly focused on the traceability of policies and\n\npractices that result in funding disparities rather than the\n\ntraceability of the disparities themselves, as plaintiffs urge.\n\n     The district court did not clearly err in finding that the\n\nfunding formula itself is not traceable to de jure segregation.\n\nUnlike the previous formula, which allocated funds based on\n\nmission designations, the present formula allocates funds as a\n\nfunction of the size of each institution’s enrollment, faculty,\n\nand physical plant.   While the formula responds to conditions\n\nthat to a significant degree have resulted from the mission\n\ndesignations (and consequently results in the HWIs receiving a\n\n     74\n        Plaintiffs request funding to develop and support new or\ntransferred programs and to enhance existing programs. Their\narguments relating to programs have been addressed in Parts\nIII.B.2 and III.B.3 supra. Plaintiffs also suggest that funding\nincreases at the HBIs could provide resources to hire new faculty\nor increase the pay of existing faculty. Arguments related to\nfaculty hiring and salaries are addressed in Part III.C infra.\n\n                                89\n\fgreater proportion of funds), the manner in which the formula\n\ndoes so is guided by valid educational concerns and is not linked\n\nto any prior discriminatory practice.\n\n     Plaintiffs argue that the district court should have\n\nconsidered adjustments to the funding formula in two respects,\n\nneither of which has merit.   First, plaintiffs argue that the\n\nformula should be adjusted for the higher cost of remedial\n\neducation, citing evidence that a disproportionately high number\n\nof black students in Mississippi are underprepared for college\n\nand that such an adjustment would encourage the HWIs to provide\n\nremedial courses and to attract black students and would aid the\n\nHBIs in providing the remedial instruction needed by their\n\nstudents.   Plaintiffs have not, however, identified any traceable\n\npolicy related to the funding of remedial education, nor have\n\nthey identified any record evidence that remedial education as\n\nstructured under the remedial decree is or is likely to be\n\nunderfunded; the decree itself requires the State to provide\n\nfunding for the summer program.    If, after examination of the\n\nresults of the summer program implementation, the district court\n\nfinds that the program needs to be modified or expanded, then the\n\ndistrict court should order appropriate funding at that time.75\n\nWe have also ordered the district court to reconsider paragraph 2\n\n\n     75\n        Private plaintiffs contend that because the funding\nformula does not provide additional funds to meet the needs of\nless adequately prepared students, the formula encourages HWI\n“disinterest” in using available exceptions to admissions. This\nargument is moot in light of our ruling on undergraduate\nadmissions standards.\n\n                                  90\n\fof the remedial decree insofar as it eliminates the remedial\n\ncourses previously offered at each of the eight universities.\n\nIf, after such reconsideration, the district court concludes that\n\nany or all of these courses should be reinstated, then it should\n\norder appropriate funding.\n\n     Second, plaintiffs argue that the funding formula should be\n\nadjusted to take into account the proportion of students at a\n\nuniversity who are in need of financial aid.   As it currently\n\noperates, the funding formula provides funds for scholarships and\n\nfellowships (which are only a portion of the total financial aid\n\navailable to students at each university) on the basis of each\n\nuniversity’s tuition income.76   The district court found that\n\nthis practice is neither unusual nor unique to Mississippi, but\n\nthat in Mississippi the universities that charge the highest\n\ntuition -- the three comprehensive HWIs -- also generally have\n\nthe largest proportion of students who have little or no need for\n\nfinancial assistance.   Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1451.   Again,\n\nhowever, plaintiffs have identified no traceable policy\n\n     76\n        According to evidence presented by the Board, the\n“scholarships and fellowships” component of the formula is\ndefined as follows:\n\n     Includes expenditures for scholarships and fellowships\n     in the form of outright grants to students selected by\n     the institution and financed from current funds,\n     restricted or unrestricted. It also should include\n     trainee stipends, prizes, and awards. The recipient of\n     an outright grant is not required to perform service to\n     the institution as consideration for the grant, nor is\n     he expected to repay the amount of the grant to the\n     funding source.\n\nBd. R-274.\n\n                                 91\n\fconcerning the adequacy of scholarship and fellowship funds\n\nprovided to the HBIs.   Any potential segregative effects of the\n\nfailure of the formula to take financial need into account is a\n\nfunction of the socioeconomic status of black applicants, not a\n\ntraceable policy of the de jure system.\n\n     Plaintiffs’ argument for general funds to enhance facilities\n\nis not supported by this record.     The district court found “no\n\npattern of inequity in funding in recent years for the HBIs as a\n\ngroup” with respect to facilities.     Id. at 1457.    The court’s\n\nfinding that funding for capital improvements and repair and\n\nrenovation disproportionately benefitted the HBIs during the\n\n1970s and 1980s is supported by the record, as is the court’s\n\nfinding that the inferior maintenance of the HBIs is not due to\n\nfunding inequities but may result from decisions at the HBIs to\n\nset aside operation and maintenance funds for other uses.       See\n\nid. at 1455, 1458.\n\n     As to library allocations, the district court’s finding that\n\nit would be educationally unsound to increase the size of the\n\nholdings of a university’s library beyond the scope of its\n\nmission is not clearly erroneous.     Funds for library acquisitions\n\nare provided through the academic support component of the\n\nfunding formula, and plaintiffs identify no evidence that this\n\nmethod of providing library funding is itself traceable to the de\n\njure system.\n\n     The court’s findings and conclusions concerning equipment\n\nfunding are more difficult for us to interpret.       The court found\n\n\n                                92\n\fthat the quality of fixed equipment, such as science lab\n\nfurnishings, at the HBIs is inferior to that at the HWIs.     Id. at\n\n1457.   Likewise, the court found that the technical and\n\nscientific equipment at the HWIs is “more advanced and generally\n\nin better condition than that of the HBIs.”   Id.   We are unable\n\nto determine based on this record, however, whether these\n\nequipment disparities implicate the funding formula, line item\n\nappropriations for capital improvements, or self-generated funds.\n\nNor are we able to determine the reasons for the disparities,\n\nwhich the district court opinion leaves unexplained.    The court’s\n\ndetermination that policies and practices governing equipment\n\navailability follow the mission assignments is perplexing in view\n\nof overlaps in the missions of the eight universities.     Each\n\nuniversity offers, for instance, undergraduate instruction.\n\nUndergraduate instruction in foreign languages, chemistry,\n\nbiology, or computing, to take a few examples, benefits from the\n\navailability of appropriate equipment.   Libraries likewise\n\nbenefit from the availability of modern technological equipment.\n\nThere is no apparent reason why the mission assignments, insofar\n\nas they relate to common university features such as these,\n\nshould result in disparities in equipment quality between the\n\nHBIs and the HWIs.   Put somewhat differently, if the different\n\nmission assignments are adduced as a reason for marked\n\ndisparities in equipment that is necessary or desirable for the\n\nundergraduate education that is provided at all eight\n\nuniversities, then they may indicate the existence of a policy or\n\n\n                                93\n\fpractice traceable to the de jure era that has present\n\nsegregative effects in that equipment quality may affect student\n\nchoice.   We therefore remand the issue of equipment funding to\n\nthe district court for further factfinding on the causes of the\n\ndisparities.    To the extent the disparities are attributable to\n\nthe mission assignments and have segregative effects that will be\n\nreduced by additional funding, relief may be in order.\n\n           d.    Conclusions regarding funding\n\n     We affirm the district court’s findings and conclusions\n\nregarding funding, except with regard to funding of equipment.\n\nWe remand the issue of equipment funding to the district court\n\nfor further factfinding on the cause and segregative effect of\n\nthe disparities, and, if necessary, the implementation of\n\nappropriate relief.\n\n\n\nC.   Employment of Black Faculty and Administrators\n\n     At both the 1987 and 1994 trials, plaintiffs challenged\n\ndefendants’ employment policies and practices on the ground that\n\nthey perpetuated segregation by resulting in racially\n\nidentifiable faculty and administrators at Mississippi’s public\n\ninstitutions of higher education and in race-based differences in\n\nfaculty rank, tenure, and salary.     Id. at 1459.   After hearing\n\nextensive testimony on remand, the district court found that no\n\ncurrent employment policies or practices are traceable to de jure\n\nsegregation.    Id. at 1477.\n\n     Plaintiffs contend on appeal that the dearth of black\n\n\n                                 94\n\ffaculty and administrators at the HWIs is traceable to the dual\n\nsystem and continues to have segregative effects by impeding the\n\nability of those institutions to recruit black students.    While\n\nnot challenging the district court’s finding that the HWIs have\n\nbeen making genuine efforts to recruit more black faculty and\n\nhave hired more black faculty than would be statistically\n\npredicted, plaintiffs nevertheless argue that this finding\n\naddresses only entry-level hiring and not the limited employment\n\nof blacks in tenured faculty and administrative positions.\n\nPlaintiffs therefore maintain that the district court was\n\nconstitutionally required to order the Board to increase efforts\n\nto hire and promote more black individuals to these levels.       In\n\naddition, plaintiffs contend that the district court should have\n\nordered relief with regard to the disparities in faculty salaries\n\nat the HBIs and HWIs.\n\n     Under the de jure system, no blacks served as faculty,\n\nadministrators, or managers at the HWIs.   Id. at 1459.    The\n\ndistrict court found during the initial trial in this case that\n\nMississippi has since adopted race-neutral hiring practices.       Id.\n\nAs the district court recognized, however, the inquiry on remand\n\nmust go beyond implementation of race-neutral practices and focus\n\n“upon the identification of remnants within the hiring process\n\nthat continue to foster segregation or the racial identifiability\n\nof the institutions of higher learning in Mississippi.”     Id.\n\n     Although the district court found that the HWIs remain\n\nracially identifiable at the level of administrators and tenured\n\n\n                               95\n\ffaculty,77 id. at 1462, it also found that since 1974 the HWIs\n\nhave hired more black faculty than would be expected based on a\n\nstatistical analysis of the qualified labor pool and national\n\nhiring demands.   Id. at 1461, 1463.   Mississippi’s HWIs compete\n\nwith other universities, particularly predominantly black\n\nuniversities, as well as business, industry, and government for\n\nthe relatively small number of blacks who earn doctorate degrees\n\neach year.78   Id. at 1461.   Under these circumstances, the\n\ndistrict court found that “[a]lthough the racial predominance of\n\nfaculty and administrators at the HWIs and the shortage of\n\nqualified black faculty are to some extent attributable to de\n\njure segregation, the HWIs are making sincere and serious efforts\n\nto increase the percentages of African-American faculty and\n\nadministrators at these institutions.”    Id. at 1463.\n\n     The relatively small number of blacks in tenured faculty and\n\nadministrative positions at the HWIs may be attributable at least\n\nin part to the de jure system, but racial identifiability at\n\nthese levels itself does not establish a constitutional\n\n\n     77\n        For the period 1986-92, 94% of the full professors at\nthe HWIs were white, and only 2% were black. For fiscal year\n1992, 98% of the administrators at the HWIs were white, and 2%\nblack. Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at 1460.\n     78\n        In 1991, for instance, blacks earned 3.8% of doctorates\nawarded to U.S. citizens nationwide. Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at\n1461. In general, only about 40% of black holders of doctorates\nearned in any given year move into academia. Id. The district\ncourt’s 1987 findings reflect a similar shortage of minority\nscholars; in addition, the district court found that out-of-state\ninstitutions are frequently able to use higher salaries to lure\nblack professors away from Mississippi universities after they\nhave gained experience. Ayers I, 674 F. Supp. at 1537-38.\n\n                                  96\n\fviolation.    See Fordice, 505 U.S. at 743.   As we noted earlier,\n\nFordice rejects the notion that the State must remedy all present\n\ndiscriminatory effects without regard to “whether such\n\nconsequences flow from policies rooted in the prior system.”       Id.\n\nat 730 n.4.   Plaintiffs identify no such policies with respect to\n\nselection of tenured faculty and administrators.79    The district\n\ncourt found, rather, that black doctorate holders are relatively\n\nfew and in high demand,80 that representation of blacks in the\n\nfaculty ranks of the HWIs exceeds reasonable expectations, and\n\nthat the HWIs actively employ a variety of measures to attract\n\nand retain qualified black faculty.    Ayers II, 879 F. Supp. at\n\n1461-62.\n\n     79\n        With respect to administrative positions, private\nplaintiffs contend that the district court failed to consider\nevidence indicating that the Board approves all such hires, and\nin the case of at least three institutions the Board makes such\napprovals with knowledge of the race of the prospective\nemployees. Private plaintiffs link this practice with evidence\nthat in the history of the system, only nine black persons have\nserved at the level of dean or above at the HWIs, and with\ntestimony of black faculty members concerning unsuccessful\nefforts to secure administrative positions at MSU.\n\n     We find that the district court did not err by failing to\nfind a traceable practice on the basis of such evidence. Without\nmore, these facts are insufficient to establish that the Board\nmaintains a practice of discriminating against black candidates\nfor administrative openings; notably absent is any claim that the\nBoard refused to approve any qualified black candidates.\n     80\n        The district court did not link the limited number of\nblack doctorate holders with the dearth of high-level black\nadministrators. We note that there is record evidence to\nindicate that, to the extent that a terminal degree is a\nnecessary or desirable qualification for an administrative\nposition (as it may be, for example, in the case of an academic\ndean), the scarcity of black doctorate holders found by the\ndistrict court would adversely affect the number of high-level\nblack administrators.\n\n                                 97\n\f     The very low percentages of blacks holding either full\n\nprofessor status or administrative rank at the HWIs are indeed a\n\nsobering reflection of longstanding efforts to limit the\n\neducational opportunities of black citizens, not in Mississippi\n\nalone.   In view of the above findings, however, and combined with\n\nthe lack of evidence linking any present policies to the de jure\n\nsystem, we find no error in the district court’s ruling.    We\n\nconclude that the district court correctly applied the standards\n\narticulated in Fordice in determining that “[t]here is no current\n\npolicy or practice in a relevant sense that produces the shortage\n\nof available black faculty, nor can liability be based on prior\n\nexclusionary admissions policies and practices that reduced the\n\nqualified pool, in light of the State’s continuous substantial\n\naffirmative efforts to correct this imbalance.”     Id. at 1463.\n\n     With respect to disparities in faculty salaries, the\n\ndistrict court did not err in declining to order relief in light\n\nof its finding that such disparities reflect legitimate\n\ndifferences, keyed to discipline and rank, in average faculty\n\nsalaries at peer institutions in the region.     Id. at 1459.    The\n\ncourt found it significant, moreover, that, although funding for\n\nfaculty salaries is provided by the State under the formula, each\n\ninstitution has the autonomy to determine the number of faculty\n\npositions needed, their rank within the university, and the\n\ncompensation for that rank.   Id.    Finding no traceable policy,\n\nthe court properly declined to order relief.\n\n     We affirm the district court’s findings of fact and\n\n\n                                98\n\fconclusions of law on the subject of the defendants’ employment\n\npolicies and practices.\n\n\n\nD.   System Governance\n\n     Plaintiffs argued before the district court that vestiges of\n\nthe de jure system could be found with respect to the composition\n\nof the Board and its staff.   All institutions of higher learning\n\nin Mississippi have been governed by a single entity -- the Board\n\nof Trustees of State Institutions of Higher Learning -- since\n\n1932.   No black person served on the Board until 1972, and no\n\nblack person was appointed to serve as a professional staff\n\nmember until 1974.    Id. at 1473.    At present, the twelve members\n\nof the Board are appointed by the governor with the advice and\n\nconsent of the Mississippi senate.\n\n     The district court found no evidence of a current practice\n\nof denying or diluting the representation of black citizens on\n\nthe Board.   Id.   At the time of trial, the Board had three black\n\nmembers and its immediate past president was black.       Id.    Of the\n\nBoard’s 108 employees, 26 were black.      Id.   The district court\n\nnoted that black Board staff members hold professional positions\n\nof responsibility such as Assistant Commissioner for Academic\n\nAffairs and Associate Commissioner of Academic Affairs.         Id.\n\n     Private plaintiffs contend that the district court ignored\n\nevidence of Board selection practices that minimize the\n\nparticipation of black persons on the Board, as well as evidence\n\nof the Board’s practice of hiring blacks for only low-level\n\n\n                                 99\n\fpositions on staff.\n\n     With respect to Board composition, private plaintiffs cite\n\nevidence that from 1972 to 1992, only six out of 24 to 30 newly\n\nseated Board members were black.   We are unable to conclude on\n\nthe basis of this bare statistic that the district court clearly\n\nerred in finding no traceable policy or practice concerning Board\n\ncomposition.   After reviewing both the history of black persons’\n\nexclusion from the Board and the post-1972 role of black Board\n\nmembers, the district court found that “[t]he fact that blacks\n\nhave actively participated on the Board for more than twenty\n\nyears indicates that no current exclusionary policy exists.”      Id.\n\nAs with employment, numerical disparities alone do not establish\n\nliability for maintaining remnants of the prior dual system.\n\n     With respect to Board staff, private plaintiffs advance two\n\nrelated contentions.   First, they argue that the district court’s\n\nfindings regarding staffing totals are clearly erroneous.   After\n\nreviewing the record, we conclude that this argument is without\n\nmerit.81   Second, private plaintiffs argue that a significant\n\nmajority of staff positions held by blacks are in low-level job\n\ncategories.    This argument is unavailing for reasons similar to\n\nthose discussed above; private plaintiffs rely on employment\n\nfigures without regard to other information that might reveal a\n\n\n     81\n        Private plaintiffs argue that blacks held only 23 of a\ntotal of 105 staff positions in 1992. Private plaintiffs’ own\nexhibit, however, indicates that the district court did not err\nin its finding that blacks held 26 of 108 staff positions in that\nyear. Private plaintiffs offer no explanation in their briefs\nfor this disparity.\n\n                                 100\n\ftraceable practice with discriminatory effects, such as the\n\nrelevant pool of qualified candidates or the particulars of the\n\nappointment process.    Accordingly, we do not disturb the district\n\ncourt’s finding of no traceable policy or practice in the area of\n\nsystem governance.    We affirm the district court’s findings of\n\nfact and conclusions of law on the subject of system governance.\n\n\n\n                           IV. CONCLUSION\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court’s\n\nfindings of fact, conclusions of law, and remedial decree except\n\nas follows:\n\n          1.   In affirming the district court’s\n\n     implementation of the Board’s admissions standards, we\n\n     do not affirm the elimination of the remedial courses\n\n     previously offered at each of the eight universities.\n\n     We remand this issue for immediate reconsideration in\n\n     the light of this opinion.    If the district court\n\n     concludes that any or all of the previously offered\n\n     remedial courses should be reinstated, the same should\n\n     be implemented, with appropriate funding, to be\n\n     effective beginning with the academic year 1997-98.\n\n     The district court should provide findings of fact and\n\n     conclusions of law in support of its decision regarding\n\n     reinstatement.\n\n          2.   We reverse the district court’s finding that\n\n     the use of ACT cutoff scores as a criterion for the\n\n\n                                  101\n\faward of scholarships at the HWIs is not traceable to\n\nthe de jure system and does not currently foster\n\nsegregation.   We remand for determination of the\n\npracticability and educational soundness of reforming\n\nthis aspect of the undergraduate scholarship policies\n\nat the HWIs and the implementation, if necessary, of\n\nappropriate remedial relief to be effective beginning\n\nwith the academic year 1998-99.\n\n     3.   We direct the district court on remand to\n\nclarify the status of the Board’s proposal to merge\n\nMississippi Valley State with Delta State and, if the\n\ndistrict court confirms that merger will no longer be\n\npursued, to vacate paragraph 12 of the remedial decree\n\nand to incorporate into the remedial decree (a) a\n\nprovision directing the Board to study and to report to\n\nthe Monitoring Committee on new academic programs that\n\nhave a reasonable chance of increasing other-race\n\npresence at Mississippi Valley State and (b) a\n\nprovision requiring the Board to study and to report to\n\nthe Monitoring Committee on unnecessary program\n\nduplication between Mississippi Valley State and Delta\n\nState.\n\n     4.   We direct the district court on remand to\n\nincorporate into the remedial decree a provision\n\ndirecting the Board to study and report to the\n\nMonitoring Committee on new academic and land grant\n\n\n                           102\n\f     programs that have a reasonable chance of increasing\n\n     other-race presence at Alcorn State.\n\n          5.    On the issue of accreditation, the district\n\n     court should determine the status of current efforts to\n\n     achieve accreditation of existing business programs at\n\n     Jackson State and order appropriate relief, if\n\n     necessary, to ensure that the Board is taking steps\n\n     commensurate with its role in this accreditation\n\n     process.\n\n          6.    We remand the issue of equipment funding to\n\n     the district court for further factfinding on the cause\n\n     and segregative effect of the disparities, and, if\n\n     necessary, the implementation of appropriate relief.\n\n     We understand the district court’s continuing jurisdiction\n\nto encompass the evaluation of the effectiveness of the spring\n\nscreening and summer remedial program, as a component of the\n\nadmissions system, in achieving its intended objectives of\n\nidentifying and admitting those students who are capable, with\n\nreasonable remediation, of doing college level work but who fail\n\nto qualify for regular admission.      If the district court\n\nultimately concludes that this program (as it may be modified) is\n\nunable to any significant degree to achieve its objectives, then\n\nthe court should, if possible, identify and implement another\n\npracticable and educationally sound method for achieving those\n\nobjectives in sufficient time for the academic year 1999-2000.\n\nIf, after examination of the results of the summer program\n\n\n                                 103\n\fimplementation, the district court finds that the program needs\n\nto be modified or expanded, then the district court should order\n\nappropriate funding at that time.\n\n     Any further appeals shall be to this panel.\n\n     AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.   Each party shall bear\n\nits own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                               104\n\f</pre>",
