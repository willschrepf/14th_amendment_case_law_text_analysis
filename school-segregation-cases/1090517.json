Phoenix\n     By   Donald M. Peters\nAttorneys for Amicus Curiae The Arizona Fire District\nAssociation\n________________________________________________________________\n\nR Y A N, Justice\n\n¶1           Arizona    Revised    Statutes            (“A.R.S.”)     section       48-\n\n805(B)(14)     (Supp.   2004),    permits        fire    districts    to    “[a]dopt\n\nresolutions     establishing      fee   schedules          for    providing        fire\n\nprotection services and services for the preservation of life.”1\n\nIncluded    among   the   permissible       fee    schedules        are   those    for\n\n“facilities benefit assessments.”                Id.     In this case, we must\n\ndetermine whether the “facilities benefit assessment” charged by\n\nNorthwest    Fire   District     constitutes       a    valid    exercise     of   its\n\nstatutory authority.      We conclude that it does not.\n\n                                        I\n\n¶2           Northwest Fire District was organized under Title 48,\n\nChapter 1, Articles 10 and 11 of the Arizona Revised Statutes,\n\nto   provide    emergency   services        to    district       residents.        The\n\nDistrict covers more than 140 square miles in the northwest\n\nportion of metropolitan Tucson – an area that has seen some of\n\nthe most rapid development in Pima County over the past decade.\n\n\n1\n     Section 48-805 has since been amended, and the applicable\nprovision has been renumbered as (B)(13).    2006 Ariz. Sess.\nLaws, ch. 315, § 9. Because the District passed the Resolution\nat issue here before this amendment, we will refer to the\nprovision as (B)(14).\n\n                                        2\n\fThis rapid development has strained the District’s resources and\n\nits ability to adequately meet its statutory duties.\n\n¶3          This economic strain results in part from the timing\n\nof property tax assessments.             According to the affidavit of the\n\nPima County Assessor, the value of a residential structure is\n\nnot   included     in    the    tax    assessment      until    construction       is\n\ncomplete; even then, the value may not be placed on the tax\n\nrolls for up to fifteen months.\n\n¶4          In   2003,    the    District    responded     to   fires    at     three\n\npartially    constructed        homes.       Because    the     value    of     these\n\nstructures was not on the property tax rolls, District resources\n\nwere expended to protect property that had not yet been fully\n\ntaxed.      This    situation      prompted     the    District     to    consider\n\nimposing a fee, due upon application for a building permit, on\n\nnew construction.\n\n¶5          In   December      2004,   the   District’s    board,       relying   on\n\nA.R.S. § 48-805(B)(14), approved Resolution 2004-048 authorizing\n\na facilities benefit assessment on new construction.                          Section\n\n48-805(B)(14) states that fire districts may:\n\n      [a]dopt resolutions establishing fee schedules for\n      providing fire protection services and services for\n      the preservation of life including emergency fire and\n      emergency medical services, plan reviews, standby\n      charges,   fire  cause   determination, users’  fees,\n      facilities benefit assessments or any other fee\n      schedule that may be required.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n\n                                         3\n\f¶6            According         to    the    Resolution,            a     facilities          benefit\n\nassessment         was     necessary        to    pay       “the        costs       of   developing\n\nfacilities from which to provide services to new construction\n\nareas.”         The Resolution stated that because of the delay in\n\nplacing      new    construction        on       the    property         tax     rolls,       current\n\ntaxes     did      not     generate      sufficient          revenue           to     cover      these\n\nexpenses, leaving other District residents to bear the added\n\nburden of providing services to new construction.\n\n¶7            The        District     began       assessing         new         construction        on\n\nJanuary      14,    2005,       the   effective         date       of    the     Resolution,        by\n\nsending out invoices that stated:\n\n        The purpose of this [facilities benefit] assessment is\n        to provide funding for the purchase of land and the\n        construction of new fire facilities as needed within\n        the District. This assessment enables the District to\n        recoup property taxes not collected due to delays in\n        placing property improvements, such as a new home or\n        commercial building, on the property tax rolls.\n\nU.S.     Home      of     Arizona      Construction            Company          and      U.S.     Home\n\nCorporation (collectively “U.S. Home”), one of the home builders\n\nin the District, refused to pay the assessment.                                       The District\n\nfiled    a    complaint         to    recover         the   unpaid        facilities          benefit\n\nassessments.\n\n¶8            The superior court granted summary judgment in favor\n\nof U.S. Home.             The court concluded that a fire district could\n\nraise    revenue         only    through         taxes,      bond        elections,        and    fee\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fschedules.          It further found that the items for which a fire\n\ndistrict could create fee schedules under A.R.S. § 48-805(B)(14)\n\nwere “much more limited items . . . which appear to be for a\n\nspecific      service.”        It   held   that     fees    could      be    charged      for\n\nactual    services      rendered,      but       those    charges     must     reasonably\n\nrelate to their purpose, and the District’s assessment did not\n\nsatisfy this criterion.\n\n¶9            The     District      appealed,       and    the     court     of    appeals\n\nreversed and remanded.              Nw. Fire Dist. v. U.S. Home of Ariz.\n\nConstr. Co., 213 Ariz. 489, 495, ¶ 23, 143 P.3d 1030, 1036 (App.\n\n2006).     Relying on cases and statutes from other jurisdictions,\n\nthe court determined that a facilities benefit assessment is “a\n\nspecial       assessment         against         real      property         for      public\n\nimprovements.”          Id. at 491, ¶ 8, 143 P.3d at 1032 (quoting\n\nBarratt Am., Inc. v. City of San Diego, 12 Cal. Rptr. 3d 132,\n\n137 (Cal. Ct. App. 2004)).                 Under this definition, the court\n\nreasoned, the District’s fee qualified as a facilities benefit\n\nassessment      because    the      District       intended      to    use     the    money\n\ncollected      to    develop     facilities        to    provide      services       to   the\n\nconstruction areas.        Id. at 491-92, ¶ 8, 143 P.3d at 1032-33.\n\n¶10           In rejecting the superior court’s holding that the fee\n\ncould    be   assessed     only     for    services       rendered,      the      court    of\n\nappeals determined that this assessment does provide a service -\n\nthe guarantee of adequate facilities to respond to an emergency.\n\n\n                                             5\n\fId. at 492, ¶ 10, 143 P.3d at 1033.                         Further, the court found,\n\nthe    lack     of       limiting      language        in     A.R.S.    §    48-805(B)(14)\n\ndemonstrates the legislature’s intent to create a broad power to\n\nassess.       Id. at ¶ 11.            The court concluded that if the District\n\nwas not entitled to impose these assessments on property owners\n\nthat   benefited          from    the     District’s          facilities,         the   phrase\n\n“facilities benefit assessment” would be rendered meaningless.\n\nId. at 493, ¶ 14, 143 P.3d at 1034.\n\n¶11           U.S. Home petitioned for review, arguing that the fee\n\nimposed    is      not    a   valid     facilities          benefit    assessment.          The\n\nDistrict       responded         by     arguing        that    the     fee        charged    is\n\nstatutorily permitted and that the court of appeals opinion did\n\nnot give it unregulated power to raise revenue.\n\n¶12           We     granted        review      because        this    case        raises    an\n\nimportant issue for the more than 130 fire districts in the\n\nstate and their residents.                 We have jurisdiction under Article\n\n6, Section 5(3), of the Arizona Constitution and A.R.S. § 12-\n\n120.24 (2003).            Whether a particular exercise of power by the\n\nDistrict falls within its statutory authority is a question of\n\nlaw, which we review de novo.                   See Hohokam Irrigation & Drainage\n\nDist. v. Ariz. Pub. Serv. Co., 204 Ariz. 394, 397, ¶ 5, 64 P.3d\n\n836, 839 (2003).\n\n                                                II\n\n¶13           Fire       districts        are        constitutional         and     statutory\n\n\n                                                6\n\fentities, much like municipal corporations.                       See Ariz. Const.\n\nart. 13, § 7; A.R.S. §§ 48-802 to -834 (2000); Cal. Portland\n\nCement Co. v. Picture Rocks Fire Dist., 143 Ariz. 170, 174, 692\n\nP.2d 1019, 1023 (App. 1984).                   As such, a fire district can\n\nexercise      only    those    limited     powers       granted    to    it     by   the\n\nlegislature.         Cf. Hohokam Irrigation & Drainage Dist., 204 Ariz.\n\nat 397, ¶ 6, 64 P.3d at 839; Local 266, Int’l Bhd. of Elec.\n\nWorkers v. Salt River Project Agric. Improvement & Power Dist.,\n\n78 Ariz. 30, 38, 275 P.2d 393, 398 (1954).                     The revenue-raising\n\npower of fire districts – the power at issue here – has been\n\nlimited by the legislature to issuing and selling bonds, A.R.S.\n\n§ 48-806 (Supp. 2006); collecting property taxes,                         id.    § 48-\n\n807(F)   (Supp.       2006);    and     charging    fees     in   accordance         with\n\npermitted fee schedules, id. § 48-805(B)(14).                      It is this last\n\nstatutory power on which the District relied in adopting its\n\n“facilities benefit assessment.”\n\n¶14           The legislature has not defined “facilities benefit\n\nassessment.”         U.S. Home argues that the superior court correctly\n\ninterpreted      this       provision    narrowly       by     finding    that       this\n\nassessment could issue only for specific services rendered.                          The\n\ncourt    of   appeals,       however,    afforded       this    phrase    a     broader\n\ninterpretation         by    stating     that      it    permitted       “a     special\n\nassessment against real property for public improvements.”                            Nw.\n\nFire Dist., 213 Ariz. at 491, ¶ 8, 143 P.3d at 1032 (quoting\n\n\n                                           7\n\fBarratt Am., Inc., 12 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 137).\n\n¶15          We   need      not    decide    today     between     these    differing\n\ninterpretations.         Even assuming the court of appeals correctly\n\ndetermined    that     the    legislature        intended     “facilities        benefit\n\nassessment” to grant fire districts the power to impose “special\n\nassessments,”     we     conclude     that      the   District’s     fee    is    not   a\n\nspecial assessment.\n\n                                            A\n\n¶16          A “special assessment” is “an assessment against real\n\nproperty     based     on    the    proposition       that,    due    to    a    public\n\nimprovement of some nature, such real property has received a\n\nbenefit.”     Barry v. Sch. Dist. No. 210, 105 Ariz. 139, 140, 460\n\nP.2d 634, 635 (1969) (quoting State v. Carney, 139 N.E.2d 339,\n\n340 (Ohio 1956)); Weller v. City of Phoenix, 39 Ariz. 148, 151,\n\n4 P.2d 665, 667 (1931) (defining assessments as “special and\n\nlocal impositions on property, made for a public purpose, but\n\nfixed in amount with reference to the special benefit which such\n\nproperty derives from the expenditure” (emphasis omitted)).                             A\n\nspecial     assessment        therefore         may   not     be   levied        against\n\nparticular property if the property will not receive a specific\n\nbenefit from the improvement funded by the assessment.                               See\n\nMosher v. City of Phoenix, 39 Ariz. 470, 480, 7 P.2d 622, 626\n\n(1932), overruled on other grounds by In re Forsstrom, 44 Ariz.\n\n472, 493-94, 38 P.2d 878, 887 (1934).                 “The rationale of special\n\n\n                                            8\n\fassessment is that the assessed property has received a special\n\nbenefit over and above that received by the general public.”\n\nJ.W. Jones Cos. v. City of San Diego, 203 Cal. Rptr. 580, 584\n\n(Ct. App. 1984) (quoting Solvang Mun. Improvement Dist. V. Bd.\n\nOf Supervisors, 169 Cal. Rptr. 391, 395 (Cal. Ct. App. 1980)).\n\n¶17         Because   property   may       be   assessed   its   proportion    of\n\nspecified costs only if it receives a special benefit from the\n\nimprovement that is different than the benefit received by other\n\nproperties, any evaluation of a special assessment must begin by\n\nreviewing the improvements funded by the assessment and their\n\nestimated costs.      Cf. A.R.S. § 48-577 (2000) (stating that a\n\nmunicipal   special    assessment      requires      preliminary    plans     for\n\nimprovements and cost estimates and also requires that no lot be\n\nassessed more than “its proportion of the estimate”).                Without a\n\nspecific plan and cost estimate, there can be no way of knowing\n\nthe property owner’s share of the improvement costs or whether a\n\nparticular property will be benefited at all, let alone whether\n\nit will receive a benefit different than all other properties in\n\nthe district.\n\n¶18         The District’s Resolution did not set forth or refer\n\nto any specific plan for the construction of new facilities.\n\nThe District thus cannot demonstrate the cost of such facilities\n\nor the associated benefit to each assessed property.\n\n¶19         Furthermore, the District has not shown that the funds\n\n\n                                       9\n\fcollected under this assessment will be spent on facilities that\n\nuniquely benefit the assessed property.                      The funds collected\n\nwere    not      segregated;     instead      they    were     placed      into   the\n\nDistrict’s general fund.            The District’s proposed budget for\n\n2005-06 showed these funds being spent without any indication\n\nthat they were earmarked for facilities that specially benefited\n\nthe    assessed    properties.         Moreover,      even    assuming     that   the\n\nDistrict will eventually use the money for facilities, there is\n\nno    way   to   conclude   on   the   current       record   that   the    assessed\n\nproperty will benefit in a way that other property within the\n\nDistrict does not.          The District’s general plans to use the\n\nfunds for facilities to benefit the new construction are not\n\nenough.     For example, the District could fulfill this aspiration\n\nby simply expanding a current fire station or acquiring the\n\nadjacent lot for new facilities.              In that situation, there would\n\nbe no special benefit to new construction that would not also be\n\nshared by the prior District residents served by that station.\n\nSee Mosher, 39 Ariz. at 480, 7 P.2d at 626.\n\n                                         B\n\n¶20           Nonetheless, the District asserts that its facilities\n\nbenefit assessment did not exceed the power granted by A.R.S. §\n\n48-805(B)(14) because the fee assessed to U.S. Home and others\n\nwas meant to ensure adequate facilities for new construction.\n\nThe District further argues that its failure to formulate a plan\n\n\n                                         10\n\ffor the construction or improvement of facilities to benefit the\n\nnew   construction      should     not    be     determinative    because       its\n\ndecision is a legislative decision, not one for the judiciary.\n\n¶21         The District’s interpretation of “facilities benefit\n\nassessment,” however, would effectively permit it to circumvent\n\nstatutory protections for fire district property owners.                       Such\n\nan interpretation would render the statutory protections largely\n\nillusory.    See Jennings v. Woods, 194 Ariz. 314, 320, ¶ 21, 982\n\nP.2d 274, 280 (1999) (interpreting statutory provisions so as\n\nnot to render a provision meaningless).\n\n¶22         For    instance,     under    the    District’s    theory,    a    fire\n\ndistrict could request a lower property tax authorization or\n\nissue fewer bonds to appease qualified electors, and then levy a\n\nfacilities benefit assessment against certain district property\n\nowners, such as U.S. Home, to cover the district’s facilities\n\ncosts.      Such   an   assessment   could      exceed   the   three     and   one-\n\nquarter percent property tax cap of A.R.S. § 48-807(F) or the\n\nsix percent bond cap of A.R.S. § 48-806(D) and thereby evade\n\nthese statutory limitations.             The assessment would also evade\n\nelectoral approval and the statutory requirement that proceeds\n\nfrom the sale of bonds be placed in a separate fund and used\n\nonly for a specific purpose.             Id. § 48-806(D), (G).         Without a\n\nspecific    plan   to   improve    or    build    facilities,    the     assessed\n\nproperty owners have not only lost these statutory protections,\n\n\n                                         11\n\fbut     they    also    have   no   assurance         that   the    assessment       was\n\nnecessary or that they will benefit from the facilities they\n\nhave     funded.2         An   interpretation          of    “facilities         benefit\n\nassessment” that allows this result cannot have been what the\n\nlegislature intended in passing A.R.S. § 48-805(B)(14).\n\n¶23            Unlike the court of appeals, we are not persuaded that\n\nthe    political       accountability     of    the    District’s        board    offers\n\nappropriate protection for District property owners.                             See Nw.\n\nFire Dist., 213 Ariz. at 492, ¶ 12, 143 P.3d at 1033.                                The\n\nassessment here was not levied against qualified electors of the\n\nDistrict.        See A.R.S. § 48-802(C) (Supp. 2004) (stating that\n\nonly qualified electors who are district residents may vote in a\n\ndistrict       election).      It   was    the    builder,         not   a   qualified\n\nelector, who was charged the assessment upon application for a\n\nbuilding permit. Therefore, the public accountability check on\n\nthis assessment was lacking.\n\n                                          III\n\n¶24            Finally, the District argues that our opinion in Home\n\nBuilders Association of Central Arizona v. City of Scottsdale,\n\n187 Ariz. 479, 930 P.2d 993 (1997), controls the outcome of this\n\ncase.     We find that opinion distinguishable on several grounds.\n\n\n2\n     Remedying a shortfall in tax revenue through a facilities\nbenefit assessment, as the District did here, raises the same\nconcerns.\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\fFirst,   the     fee    under     consideration        in      Home    Builders       was   a\n\ndevelopment fee.         Id. at 480, 930 P.2d at 994.                   Fire districts,\n\nunlike     municipalities,           do    not    have        the   power      to     impose\n\ndevelopment fees.3            See, e.g., A.R.S. § 9-463.05 (Supp. 2006);\n\ncf. Hohokam Irrigation & Drainage Dist., 204 Ariz. at 397, ¶ 6,\n\n64 P.3d at 839 (stating that irrigation districts’ powers are\n\nlimited to those enumerated in the constitution or statutes).\n\n¶25         Second, the ability to impose a development fee is\n\nbroader than the ability to impose a special assessment.                                Home\n\nBuilders, 187 Ariz. at 483, 930 P.2d at 997.                        Specific plans are\n\nnot   required     to    impose      a    development       fee,      unlike   a    special\n\nassessment.      Id.     Because we assume for purposes of this opinion\n\nthat a facilities benefit assessment is a special assessment,\n\nthe   District’s         assessment         cannot       be     afforded       the      same\n\nflexibility as the development fee in Home Builders.\n\n¶26         Third, the city’s plan in Home Builders was much more\n\nspecific    than       that    put    forth      by   the      District.        The    city\n\nspecifically delineated its program for meeting its future water\n\nneeds, including how the water would be obtained and estimating\n\n\n3\n     Development fees are designed to “offset costs to [a]\nmunicipality associated with providing necessary public services\nto a development.” A.R.S. § 9-463.05(A) (Supp. 2006). They are\n“designed to assist in raising the capital necessary to meet\nneeds that surely will arise in the foreseeable future but whose\nprecise details may not at the outset be quite clear.”      Home\nBuilders, 187 Ariz. at 483, 930 P.2d at 997.\n\n\n\n                                            13\n\fthe total costs associated with bringing these resources to the\n\ncity.     Id.       at    480-81,      930    P.2d       at    994-95.           The    city     then\n\ndetermined the cost of bringing each acre-foot of water to the\n\ncity    and     the       average      amount        of       water        certain       types      of\n\ndevelopment      require.           Id.       at    485,       930    P.2d       at    999.         The\n\ndevelopment fee was then calculated based on the estimated cost\n\nfor providing water to the type of development being charged.\n\nId.\n\n¶27           Here, the District has not created a plan for any\n\nparticular      facilities        to    benefit          those       assessed,         nor    has   it\n\ndetermined       what          facilities          are        necessary          for     the        new\n\nconstruction.              Therefore,         the        District          cannot       accurately\n\ndetermine how much to assess the property owners because it has\n\nno estimated cost for the necessary facilities.                                  Although plans\n\nsupporting special assessments are required to be more specific\n\nthan those for development fees, id. at 483, 930 P.2d at 997,\n\nthe District’s plan is far less developed than that in Home\n\nBuilders.       Thus, the District’s reliance on Home Builders is\n\nunavailing.\n\n                                               IV\n\n¶28           For        the    foregoing          reasons,           we     hold       that        the\n\n“facilities benefit assessment” promulgated by the District was\n\nnot    authorized         by   A.R.S.     §    48-805(B)(14),              and    is     therefore\n\n\n\n\n                                               14\n\finvalid.4     Accordingly, we affirm the trial court’s grant of\n\nsummary judgment in favor of U.S. Home and vacate the opinion of\n\nthe court of appeals.\n\n\n                          _______________________________________\n                          Michael D.

Peters, Phoenix, Attorneys for Amicus Curiae The Arizona Fire District Association.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>RYAN, Justice.</p>\n<p>¶ 1 Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") section 48-805(B)(14) (Supp.2004), permits fire districts to \"[a]dopt resolutions establishing fee schedules for providing fire protection services and services for the preservation of life.\"<sup>[1]</sup> Included among the permissible fee schedules are those for \"facilities benefit assessments.\" <i>Id.</i> In this case, we must determine whether the \"facilities benefit assessment\" charged by Northwest Fire District constitutes a valid exercise of its statutory authority. We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>¶ 2 Northwest Fire District was organized under Title 48, Chapter 1, Articles 10 and 11 of the Arizona Revised Statutes, to provide emergency services to district residents. The District covers more than 140 square miles in the northwest portion of metropolitan Tucsonan area that has seen some of the most rapid development in Pima County over the past decade. This rapid development has strained the District's resources and its ability to adequately meet its statutory duties.</p>\n<p>¶ 3 This economic strain results in part from the timing of property tax assessments. According to the affidavit of the Pima County Assessor, the value of a residential structure is not included in the tax assessment until construction is complete; even then, the value may not be placed on the tax rolls for up to fifteen months.</p>\n<p>¶ 4 In 2003, the District responded to fires at three partially constructed homes. Because the value of these structures was not on the property tax rolls, District resources were expended to protect property that had not yet been fully taxed. This situation prompted the District to consider imposing a fee, due upon application for a building permit, on new construction.</p>\n<p>¶ 5 In December 2004, the District's board, relying on A.R.S. § 48-805(B)(14), approved Resolution 2004-048 authorizing a facilities benefit assessment on new construction. Section 48-805(B)(14) states that fire districts may:</p>\n<blockquote>[a]dopt resolutions establishing fee schedules for providing fire protection services and services for the preservation of life including emergency fire and emergency medical services, plan reviews, standby charges, fire cause determination, users' fees, <i>facilities benefit assessments</i> or any other fee schedule that may be required.</blockquote>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>¶ 6 According to the Resolution, a facilities benefit assessment was necessary to pay \"the costs of developing facilities from which to provide services to new construction areas.\" The Resolution stated that because of the delay in placing new construction on the property tax rolls, current taxes did not generate sufficient revenue to cover these expenses, leaving other District residents to bear the added burden of providing services to new construction.</p>\n<p>¶ 7 The District began assessing new construction on January 14, 2005, the effective date of the Resolution, by sending out invoices that stated:</p>\n<blockquote>The purpose of this [facilities benefit] assessment is to provide funding for the purchase of land and the construction of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*537</span> new fire facilities as needed within the District. This assessment enables the District to recoup property taxes not collected due to delays in placing property improvements, such as a new home or commercial building, on the property tax rolls.</blockquote>\n<p>U.S. Home of Arizona Construction Company and U.S. Home Corporation (collectively \"U.S. Home\"), one of the home builders in the District, refused to pay the assessment. The District filed a complaint to recover the unpaid facilities benefit assessments.</p>\n<p>¶ 8 The superior court granted summary judgment in favor of U.S. Home. The court concluded that a fire district could raise revenue only through taxes, bond elections, and fee schedules. It further found that the items for which a fire district could create fee schedules under A.R.S. § 48-805(B)(14) were \"much more limited items . . . which appear to be for a specific service.\" It held that fees could be charged for actual services rendered, but those charges must reasonably relate to their purpose, and the District's assessment did not satisfy this criterion.</p>\n<p>¶ 9 The District appealed, and the court of appeals reversed and remanded. <i>Nw. Fire Dist. v. U.S. Home of Ariz. Constr. Co.,</i> 213 Ariz. 489, 495, ¶ 23, 143 P.3d 1030, 1036 (App.2006). Relying on cases and statutes from other jurisdictions, the court determined that a facilities benefit assessment is \"a special assessment against real property for public improvements.\" <i>Id.</i> at 491, ¶ 8, 143 P.3d at 1032 (quoting <i>Barratt Am., Inc. v. City of San Diego,</i> 117 Cal.App.4th 809, 12 Cal.Rptr.3d 132, 137 (2004)). Under this definition, the court reasoned, the District's fee qualified as a facilities benefit assessment because the District intended to use the money collected to develop facilities to provide services to the construction areas. <i>Id.</i> at 491-92, ¶ 8, 143 P.3d at 1032-33.</p>\n<p>¶ 10 In rejecting the superior court's holding that the fee could be assessed only for services rendered, the court of appeals determined that this assessment does provide a servicethe guarantee of adequate facilities to respond to an emergency. <i>Id.</i> at 492, ¶ 10, 143 P.3d at 1033. Further, the court found, the lack of limiting language in A.R.S. § 48-805(B)(14) demonstrates the legislature's intent to create a broad power to assess. <i>Id.</i> at ¶ 11, 143 P.3d 1030. The court concluded that if the District was not entitled to impose these assessments on property owners that benefited from the District's facilities, the phrase \"facilities benefit assessment\" would be rendered meaningless. <i>Id.</i> at 493, ¶ 14, 143 P.3d at 1034.</p>\n<p>¶ 11 U.S. Home petitioned for review, arguing that the fee imposed is not a valid facilities benefit assessment. The District responded by arguing that the fee charged is statutorily permitted and that the court of appeals opinion did not give it unregulated power to raise revenue.</p>\n<p>¶ 12 We granted review because this case raises an important issue for the more than 130 fire districts in the state and their residents. We have jurisdiction under Article 6, Section 5(3), of the Arizona Constitution and A.R.S. § 12-120.24 (2003). Whether a particular exercise of power by the District falls within its statutory authority is a question of law, which we review de novo. <i>See </i><i>Hohokam Irrigation &amp; Drainage Dist. v. Ariz. Pub. Serv. Co.,</i> 204 Ariz. 394, 397, ¶ 5, 64 P.3d 836, 839 (2003).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>¶ 13 Fire districts are constitutional and statutory entities, much like municipal corporations. <i>See</i> Ariz. Const. art. 13, § 7; A.R.S. §§ 48-802 to -834 (2000); <i>Cal. Portland Cement Co. v. Picture Rocks Fire Dist.,</i> 143 Ariz. 170, 174, 692 P.2d 1019, 1023 (App. 1984). As such, a fire district can exercise only those limited powers granted to it by the legislature. <i>Cf. </i><i>Hohokam Irrigation &amp; Drainage Dist.,</i> 204 Ariz. at 397, ¶ 6, 64 P.3d at 839; <i>Local 266, Int'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers v. Salt River Project Agric. Improvement &amp; Power Dist.,</i> 78 Ariz. 30, 38, 275 P.2d 393, 398 (1954). The revenue-raising power of fire districtsthe power at issue herehas been limited by the legislature to issuing and selling bonds, A.R.S. § 48-806 (Supp.2006); collecting property taxes, <i>id.</i> § 48-807(F) (Supp.2006); and charging fees in accordance with permitted fee schedules, <i>id.</i> § 48-805(B)(14). It is this last statutory power on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*538</span> which the District relied in adopting its \"facilities benefit assessment.\"</p>\n<p>¶ 14 The legislature has not defined \"facilities benefit assessment.\" U.S. Home argues that the superior court correctly interpreted this provision narrowly by finding that this assessment could issue only for specific services rendered. The court of appeals, however, afforded this phrase a broader interpretation by stating that it permitted \"a special assessment against real property for public improvements.\" <i>Nw. Fire Dist.,</i> 213 Ariz. at 491, ¶ 8, 143 P.3d at 1032 (quoting <i>Barratt Am., Inc.,</i> 12 Cal.Rptr.3d at 137).</p>\n<p>¶ 15 We need not decide today between these differing interpretations. Even assuming the court of appeals correctly determined that the legislature intended \"facilities benefit assessment\" to grant fire districts the power to impose \"special assessments,\" we conclude that the District's fee is not a special assessment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>¶ 16 A \"special assessment\" is \"an assessment against real property based on the proposition that, due to a public improvement of some nature, such real property has received a benefit.\" <i>Barry v. Sch. Dist. No. 210,</i> 105 Ariz. 139, 140, 460 P.2d 634, 635 (1969) (quoting <i>State v. Carney,</i> 166 Ohio St. 81, 139 N.E.2d 339, 340 (1956)); <i>Weller v. City of Phoenix,</i> 39 Ariz. 148, 151, 4 P.2d 665, 667 (1931) (defining assessments as \"special and local impositions on property, made for a public purpose, but fixed in amount with reference to the special benefit which such property derives from the expenditure\" (emphasis omitted)). A special assessment therefore may not be levied against particular property if the property will not receive a specific benefit from the improvement funded by the assessment. <i>See </i><i>Mosher v. City of Phoenix,</i> 39 Ariz. 470, 480, 7 P.2d 622, 626 (1932), <i>overruled on other grounds by </i><i>In re Forsstrom,</i> 44 Ariz. 472, 493-94, 38 P.2d 878, 887 (1934). \"The rationale of special assessment is that the assessed property has received a special benefit over and above that received by the general public.\" <i>J.W. Jones Cos. v. City of San Diego,</i> 157 Cal.App.3d 745, 203 Cal.Rptr. 580, 584 (1984) (quoting <i>Solvang Mun. Improvement Dist. v. Bd. Of Supervisors,</i> 112 Cal.App.3d 545, 169 Cal. Rptr. 391, 395 (1980)).</p>\n<p>¶ 17 Because property may be assessed its proportion of specified costs only if it receives a special benefit from the improvement that is different than the benefit received by other properties, any evaluation of a special assessment must begin by reviewing the improvements funded by the assessment and their estimated costs. <i>Cf.</i> A.R.S. § 48-577 (2000) (stating that a municipal special assessment requires preliminary plans for improvements and cost estimates and also requires that no lot be assessed more than \"its proportion of the estimate\"). Without a specific plan and cost estimate, there can be no way of knowing the property owner's share of the improvement costs or whether a particular property will be benefited at all, let alone whether it will receive a benefit different than all other properties in the district.</p>\n<p>¶ 18 The District's Resolution did not set forth or refer to any specific plan for the construction of new facilities. The District thus cannot demonstrate the cost of such facilities or the associated benefit to each assessed property.</p>\n<p>¶ 19 Furthermore, the District has not shown that the funds collected under this assessment will be spent on facilities that uniquely benefit the assessed property. The funds collected were not segregated; instead they were placed into the District's general fund. The District's proposed budget for 2005-06 showed these funds being spent without any indication that they were earmarked for facilities that specially benefited the assessed properties. Moreover, even assuming that the District will eventually use the money for facilities, there is no way to conclude on the current record that the assessed property will benefit in a way that other property within the District does not. The District's general plans to use the funds for facilities to benefit the new construction are not enough. For example, the District could fulfill this aspiration by simply expanding a current fire station or acquiring the adjacent lot for new facilities. In that situation, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*539</span> there would be no special benefit to new construction that would not also be shared by the prior District residents served by that station. <i>See </i><i>Mosher,</i> 39 Ariz. at 480, 7 P.2d at 626.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>¶ 20 Nonetheless, the District asserts that its facilities benefit assessment did not exceed the power granted by A.R.S. § 48-805(B)(14) because the fee assessed to U.S. Home and others was meant to ensure adequate facilities for new construction. The District further argues that its failure to formulate a plan for the construction or improvement of facilities to benefit the new construction should not be determinative because its decision is a legislative decision, not one for the judiciary.</p>\n<p>¶ 21 The District's interpretation of \"facilities benefit assessment,\" however, would effectively permit it to circumvent statutory protections for fire district property owners. Such an interpretation would render the statutory protections largely illusory. <i>See </i><i>Jennings v. Woods,</i> 194 Ariz. 314, 320, ¶ 21, 982 P.2d 274, 280 (1999) (interpreting statutory provisions so as not to render a provision meaningless).</p>\n<p>¶ 22 For instance, under the District's theory, a fire district could request a lower property tax authorization or issue fewer bonds to appease qualified electors, and then levy a facilities benefit assessment against certain district property owners, such as U.S. Home, to cover the district's facilities costs. Such an assessment could exceed the three and one-quarter percent property tax cap of A.R.S. § 48-807(F) or the six percent bond cap of A.R.S. § 48-806(D) and thereby evade these statutory limitations. The assessment would also evade electoral approval and the statutory requirement that proceeds from the sale of bonds be placed in a separate fund and used only for a specific purpose. <i>Id.</i> § 48-806(D), (G). Without a specific plan to improve or build facilities, the assessed property owners have not only lost these statutory protections, but they also have no assurance that the assessment was necessary or that they will benefit from the facilities they have funded.<sup>[2]</sup> An interpretation of \"facilities benefit assessment\" that allows this result cannot have been what the legislature intended in passing A.R.S. § 48-805(B)(14).</p>\n<p>¶ 23 Unlike the court of appeals, we are not persuaded that the political accountability of the District's board offers appropriate protection for District property owners. <i>See Nw. Fire Dist.,</i> 213 Ariz. at 492, ¶ 12, 143 P.3d at 1033. The assessment here was not levied against qualified electors of the District. <i>See</i> A.R.S. § 48-802(C) (Supp.2004) (stating that only qualified electors who are district residents may vote in a district election). It was the builder, not a qualified elector, who was charged the assessment upon application for a building permit. Therefore, the public accountability check on this assessment was lacking.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>¶ 24 Finally, the District argues that our opinion in <i>Home Builders Association of Central Arizona v. City of Scottsdale,</i> 187 Ariz. 479, 930 P.2d 993 (1997), controls the outcome of this case. We find that opinion distinguishable on several grounds. First, the fee under consideration in <i>Home Builders</i> was a development fee. <i>Id.</i> at 480, 930 P.2d at 994. Fire districts, unlike municipalities, do not have the power to impose development fees.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See, e.g.,</i> A.R.S. § 9-463.05 (Supp.2006); <i>cf. </i><i>Hohokam Irrigation &amp; Drainage Dist.,</i> 204 Ariz. at 397, ¶ 6, 64 P.3d at 839 (stating that irrigation districts' powers are limited to those enumerated in the constitution or statutes).</p>\n<p>¶ 25 Second, the ability to impose a development fee is broader than the ability <span class=\"star-pagination\">*540</span> to impose a special assessment. <i>Home Builders,</i> 187 Ariz. at 483, 930 P.2d at 997. Specific plans are not required to impose a development fee, unlike a special assessment. <i>Id.</i> Because we assume for purposes of this opinion that a facilities benefit assessment is a special assessment, the District's assessment cannot be afforded the same flexibility as the development fee in <i>Home Builders.</i></p>\n<p>¶ 26 Third, the city's plan in <i>Home Builders</i> was much more specific than that put forth by the District. The city specifically delineated its program for meeting its future water needs, including how the water would be obtained and estimating the total costs associated with bringing these resources to the city. <i>Id.</i> at 480-81, 930 P.2d at 994-95. The city then determined the cost of bringing each acre-foot of water to the city and the average amount of water certain types of development require. <i>Id.</i> at 485, 930 P.2d at 999. The development fee was then calculated based on the estimated cost for providing water to the type of development being charged. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>¶ 27 Here, the District has not created a plan for any particular facilities to benefit those assessed, nor has it determined what facilities are necessary for the new construction. Therefore, the District cannot accurately determine how much to assess the property owners because it has no estimated cost for the necessary facilities. Although plans supporting special assessments are required to be more specific than those for development fees, <i>id.</i> at 483, 930 P.2d at 997, the District's plan is far less developed than that in <i>Home Builders.</i> Thus, the District's reliance on <i>Home Builders</i> is unavailing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>¶ 28 For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the \"facilities benefit assessment\" promulgated by the District was not authorized by A.R.S. § 48-805(B)(14), and is therefore invalid.<sup>[4]</sup> Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of U.S. Home and vacate the opinion of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p>CONCURRING: RUTH V.

We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>¶ 2 Northwest Fire District was organized under Title 48, Chapter 1, Articles 10 and 11 of the Arizona Revised Statutes, to provide emergency services to district residents. The District covers more than 140 square miles in the northwest portion of metropolitan Tucsonan area that has seen some of the most rapid development in Pima County over the past decade. This rapid development has strained the District's resources and its ability to adequately meet its statutory duties.</p>\n<p>¶ 3 This economic strain results in part from the timing of property tax assessments. According to the affidavit of the Pima County Assessor, the value of a residential structure is not included in the tax assessment until construction is complete; even then, the value may not be placed on the tax rolls for up to fifteen months.</p>\n<p>¶ 4 In 2003, the District responded to fires at three partially constructed homes. Because the value of these structures was not on the property tax rolls, District resources were expended to protect property that had not yet been fully taxed. This situation prompted the District to consider imposing a fee, due upon application for a building permit, on new construction.</p>\n<p>¶ 5 In December 2004, the District's board, relying on A.R.S. § 48-805(B)(14), approved Resolution 2004-048 authorizing a facilities benefit assessment on new construction. Section 48-805(B)(14) states that fire districts may:</p>\n<blockquote>[a]dopt resolutions establishing fee schedules for providing fire protection services and services for the preservation of life including emergency fire and emergency medical services, plan reviews, standby charges, fire cause determination, users' fees, <i>facilities benefit assessments</i> or any other fee schedule that may be required.</blockquote>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>¶ 6 According to the Resolution, a facilities benefit assessment was necessary to pay \"the costs of developing facilities from which to provide services to new construction areas.\" The Resolution stated that because of the delay in placing new construction on the property tax rolls, current taxes did not generate sufficient revenue to cover these expenses, leaving other District residents to bear the added burden of providing services to new construction.</p>\n<p>¶ 7 The District began assessing new construction on January 14, 2005, the effective date of the Resolution, by sending out invoices that stated:</p>\n<blockquote>The purpose of this [facilities benefit] assessment is to provide funding for the purchase of land and the construction of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*537</span> new fire facilities as needed within the District. This assessment enables the District to recoup property taxes not collected due to delays in placing property improvements, such as a new home or commercial building, on the property tax rolls.</blockquote>\n<p>U.S. Home of Arizona Construction Company and U.S. Home Corporation (collectively \"U.S. Home\"), one of the home builders in the District, refused to pay the assessment. The District filed a complaint to recover the unpaid facilities benefit assessments.</p>\n<p>¶ 8 The superior court granted summary judgment in favor of U.S. Home. The court concluded that a fire district could raise revenue only through taxes, bond elections, and fee schedules. It further found that the items for which a fire district could create fee schedules under A.R.S. § 48-805(B)(14) were \"much more limited items . . . which appear to be for a specific service.\" It held that fees could be charged for actual services rendered, but those charges must reasonably relate to their purpose, and the District's assessment did not satisfy this criterion.</p>\n<p>¶ 9 The District appealed, and the court of appeals reversed and remanded. <i>Nw. Fire Dist. v. U.S. Home of Ariz. Constr. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">213</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></span>, 495, ¶ 23, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1030</span></span>, 1036 (App.2006). Relying on cases and statutes from other jurisdictions, the court determined that a facilities benefit assessment is \"a special assessment against real property for public improvements.\" <i>Id.</i> at 491, ¶ 8, 143 P.3d at 1032 (quoting <i>Barratt Am., Inc. v. City of San Diego,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2251989\"><a href=\"/opinion/2251989/barratt-american-inc-v-city-of-san-diego/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">132</span></a></span>, 137 (2004)). Under this definition, the court reasoned, the District's fee qualified as a facilities benefit assessment because the District intended to use the money collected to develop facilities to provide services to the construction areas. <i>Id.</i> at 491-92, ¶ 8, 143 P.3d at 1032-33.</p>\n<p>¶ 10 In rejecting the superior court's holding that the fee could be assessed only for services rendered, the court of appeals determined that this assessment does provide a servicethe guarantee of adequate facilities to respond to an emergency. <i>Id.</i> at 492, ¶ 10, 143 P.3d at 1033. Further, the court found, the lack of limiting language in A.R.S. § 48-805(B)(14) demonstrates the legislature's intent to create a broad power to assess. <i>Id.</i> at ¶ 11, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1030</span></span>. The court concluded that if the District was not entitled to impose these assessments on property owners that benefited from the District's facilities, the phrase \"facilities benefit assessment\" would be rendered meaningless. <i>Id.</i> at 493, ¶ 14, 143 P.3d at 1034.</p>\n<p>¶ 11 U.S. Home petitioned for review, arguing that the fee imposed is not a valid facilities benefit assessment. The District responded by arguing that the fee charged is statutorily permitted and that the court of appeals opinion did not give it unregulated power to raise revenue.</p>\n<p>¶ 12 We granted review because this case raises an important issue for the more than 130 fire districts in the state and their residents. We have jurisdiction under Article 6, Section 5(3), of the Arizona Constitution and A.R.S. § 12-120.24 (2003). Whether a particular exercise of power by the District falls within its statutory authority is a question of law, which we review de novo. <i>See </i><i>Hohokam Irrigation &amp; Drainage Dist. v. Ariz. Pub. Serv. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">394</span></span>, 397, ¶ 5, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">836</span></span>, 839 (2003).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>¶ 13 Fire districts are constitutional and statutory entities, much like municipal corporations. <i>See</i> Ariz. Const. art. 13, § 7; A.R.S. §§ 48-802 to -834 (2000); <i>Cal. Portland Cement Co. v. Picture Rocks Fire Dist.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1173146\"><a href=\"/opinion/1173146/cal-portland-cement-v-picture-rocks-fire-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">170</span></a></span>, 174, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1173146\"><a href=\"/opinion/1173146/cal-portland-cement-v-picture-rocks-fire-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">692</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1019</span></a></span>, 1023 (App. 1984). As such, a fire district can exercise only those limited powers granted to it by the legislature. <i>Cf. </i><i>Hohokam Irrigation &amp; Drainage Dist.,</i> 204 Ariz. at 397, ¶ 6, 64 P.3d at 839; <i>Local 266, Int'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers v. Salt River Project Agric. Improvement &amp; Power Dist.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1164862\"><a href=\"/opinion/1164862/local-266-v-salt-river-project-agr-imp-p-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 38, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1164862\"><a href=\"/opinion/1164862/local-266-v-salt-river-project-agr-imp-p-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">275</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></a></span>, 398 (1954). The revenue-raising power of fire districtsthe power at issue herehas been limited by the legislature to issuing and selling bonds, A.R.S. § 48-806 (Supp.2006); collecting property taxes, <i>id.</i> § 48-807(F) (Supp.2006); and charging fees in accordance with permitted fee schedules, <i>id.</i> § 48-805(B)(14). It is this last statutory power on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*538</span> which the District relied in adopting its \"facilities benefit assessment.\"</p>\n<p>¶ 14 The legislature has not defined \"facilities benefit assessment.\" U.S. Home argues that the superior court correctly interpreted this provision narrowly by finding that this assessment could issue only for specific services rendered. The court of appeals, however, afforded this phrase a broader interpretation by stating that it permitted \"a special assessment against real property for public improvements.\" <i>Nw. Fire Dist.,</i> 213 Ariz. at 491, ¶ 8, 143 P.3d at 1032 (quoting <i>Barratt Am., Inc.,</i> 12 Cal.Rptr.3d at 137).</p>\n<p>¶ 15 We need not decide today between these differing interpretations. Even assuming the court of appeals correctly determined that the legislature intended \"facilities benefit assessment\" to grant fire districts the power to impose \"special assessments,\" we conclude that the District's fee is not a special assessment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>¶ 16 A \"special assessment\" is \"an assessment against real property based on the proposition that, due to a public improvement of some nature, such real property has received a benefit.\" <i>Barry v.

Without a specific plan and cost estimate, there can be no way of knowing the property owner's share of the improvement costs or whether a particular property will be benefited at all, let alone whether it will receive a benefit different than all other properties in the district.</p>\n<p>¶ 18 The District's Resolution did not set forth or refer to any specific plan for the construction of new facilities. The District thus cannot demonstrate the cost of such facilities or the associated benefit to each assessed property.</p>\n<p>¶ 19 Furthermore, the District has not shown that the funds collected under this assessment will be spent on facilities that uniquely benefit the assessed property. The funds collected were not segregated; instead they were placed into the District's general fund. The District's proposed budget for 2005-06 showed these funds being spent without any indication that they were earmarked for facilities that specially benefited the assessed properties. Moreover, even assuming that the District will eventually use the money for facilities, there is no way to conclude on the current record that the assessed property will benefit in a way that other property within the District does not. The District's general plans to use the funds for facilities to benefit the new construction are not enough. For example, the District could fulfill this aspiration by simply expanding a current fire station or acquiring the adjacent lot for new facilities. In that situation, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*539</span> there would be no special benefit to new construction that would not also be shared by the prior District residents served by that station. <i>See </i><i>Mosher,</i> 39 Ariz. at 480, 7 P.2d at 626.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>¶ 20 Nonetheless, the District asserts that its facilities benefit assessment did not exceed the power granted by A.R.S. § 48-805(B)(14) because the fee assessed to U.S. Home and others was meant to ensure adequate facilities for new construction. The District further argues that its failure to formulate a plan for the construction or improvement of facilities to benefit the new construction should not be determinative because its decision is a legislative decision, not one for the judiciary.</p>\n<p>¶ 21 The District's interpretation of \"facilities benefit assessment,\" however, would effectively permit it to circumvent statutory protections for fire district property owners. Such an interpretation would render the statutory protections largely illusory. <i>See </i><i>Jennings v. Woods,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1252880\"><a href=\"/opinion/1252880/jennings-v-woods/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span>, 320, ¶ 21, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1252880\"><a href=\"/opinion/1252880/jennings-v-woods/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span>, 280 (1999) (interpreting statutory provisions so as not to render a provision meaningless).</p>\n<p>¶ 22 For instance, under the District's theory, a fire district could request a lower property tax authorization or issue fewer bonds to appease qualified electors, and then levy a facilities benefit assessment against certain district property owners, such as U.S. Home, to cover the district's facilities costs. Such an assessment could exceed the three and one-quarter percent property tax cap of A.R.S. § 48-807(F) or the six percent bond cap of A.R.S. § 48-806(D) and thereby evade these statutory limitations. The assessment would also evade electoral approval and the statutory requirement that proceeds from the sale of bonds be placed in a separate fund and used only for a specific purpose. <i>Id.</i> § 48-806(D), (G). Without a specific plan to improve or build facilities, the assessed property owners have not only lost these statutory protections, but they also have no assurance that the assessment was necessary or that they will benefit from the facilities they have funded.<sup>[2]</sup> An interpretation of \"facilities benefit assessment\" that allows this result cannot have been what the legislature intended in passing A.R.S. § 48-805(B)(14).</p>\n<p>¶ 23 Unlike the court of appeals, we are not persuaded that the political accountability of the District's board offers appropriate protection for District property owners. <i>See Nw.

The assessment here was not levied against qualified electors of the District. <i>See</i> A.R.S. § 48-802(C) (Supp.2004) (stating that only qualified electors who are district residents may vote in a district election). It was the builder, not a qualified elector, who was charged the assessment upon application for a building permit. Therefore, the public accountability check on this assessment was lacking.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>¶ 24 Finally, the District argues that our opinion in <i>Home Builders Association of Central Arizona v. City of Scottsdale,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1452531\"><a href=\"/opinion/1452531/home-builders-assn-v-city-of-scottsdale/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">479</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1452531\"><a href=\"/opinion/1452531/home-builders-assn-v-city-of-scottsdale/\"><span class=\"volume\">930</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">993</span></a></span> (1997), controls the outcome of this case. We find that opinion distinguishable on several grounds. First, the fee under consideration in <i>Home Builders</i> was a development fee. <i>Id.</i> at 480, 930 P.2d at 994. Fire districts, unlike municipalities, do not have the power to impose development fees.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See, e.g.,</i> A.R.S. § 9-463.05 (Supp.2006); <i>cf. </i><i>Hohokam Irrigation &amp; Drainage Dist.,</i> 204 Ariz. at 397, ¶ 6, 64 P.3d at 839 (stating that irrigation districts' powers are limited to those enumerated in the constitution or statutes).</p>\n<p>¶ 25 Second, the ability to impose a development fee is broader than the ability <span class=\"star-pagination\">*540</span> to impose a special assessment. <i>Home Builders,</i> 187 Ariz. at 483, 930 P.2d at 997. Specific plans are not required to impose a development fee, unlike a special assessment. <i>Id.</i> Because we assume for purposes of this opinion that a facilities benefit assessment is a special assessment, the District's assessment cannot be afforded the same flexibility as the development fee in <i>Home Builders.</i></p>\n<p>¶ 26 Third, the city's plan in <i>Home Builders</i> was much more specific than that put forth by the District. The city specifically delineated its program for meeting its future water needs, including how the water would be obtained and estimating the total costs associated with bringing these resources to the city. <i>Id.</i> at 480-81, 930 P.2d at 994-95. The city then determined the cost of bringing each acre-foot of water to the city and the average amount of water certain types of development require. <i>Id.</i> at 485, 930 P.2d at 999. The development fee was then calculated based on the estimated cost for providing water to the type of development being charged. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>¶ 27 Here, the District has not created a plan for any particular facilities to benefit those assessed, nor has it determined what facilities are necessary for the new construction. Therefore, the District cannot accurately determine how much to assess the property owners because it has no estimated cost for the necessary facilities. Although plans supporting special assessments are required to be more specific than those for development fees, <i>id.</i> at 483, 930 P.2d at 997, the District's plan is far less developed than that in <i>Home Builders.</i> Thus, the District's reliance on <i>Home Builders</i> is unavailing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>¶ 28 For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the \"facilities benefit assessment\" promulgated by the District was not authorized by A.R.S. § 48-805(B)(14), and is therefore invalid.<sup>[4]</sup> Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of U.S. Home and vacate the opinion of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p>CONCURRING: RUTH V. McGREGOR, Chief Justice, REBECCA WHITE BERCH, Vice Chief Justice, ANDREW D. HURWITZ and W. SCOTT BALES, Justices.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Section 48-805 has since been amended, and the applicable provision has been renumbered as (B)(13). 2006 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 315, § 9. Because the District passed the Resolution at issue here before this amendment, we will refer to the provision as (B)(14).</p>\n<p>[2]  Remedying a shortfall in tax revenue through a facilities benefit assessment, as the District did here, raises the same concerns.</p>\n<p>[3]  Development fees are designed to \"offset costs to [a] municipality associated with providing necessary public services to a development.\" A.R.S. § 9-463.05(A) (Supp.2006). They are \"designed to assist in raising the capital necessary to meet needs that surely will arise in the foreseeable future but whose precise details may not at the outset be quite clear.\" <i>Home Builders,</i> 187 Ariz. at 483, 930 P.2d at 997.</p>\n<p>[4]  Because we conclude that the District's assessment exceeded its authority under A.R.S. § 48-805(B)(14), we need not address the other issues raised by the parties.</p>\n\n</div>",
