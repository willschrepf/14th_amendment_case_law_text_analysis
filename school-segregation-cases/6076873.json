This court decided that case in March 2015. We remanded for\n\nfurther findings on the issue of Kassahun's gross monthly income for purposes of\n\nestablishing child support and maintenance awards. We otherwise affirmed the\n\nvarious orders the trial court entered.\n\n       Kassahun now appeals the trial court's order and findings on remand. He\n\nargues that the trial court's findings are not supported by substantial evidence, that\n\nthe trial court used incorrect values and methods to calculate his income, that\n\nAshagari's financial declarations were not verified by \"[o]ther sufficient verification\"\n\nunder RCW 26.19.071(2), that the trial court misapplied the statutory factors under\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/2\n\n\nRCW 26.09.090 in calculating its maintenance award, and that the trial court erred\n\nwhen it declined to impute income to Ashagari. Finding no error, we affirm.\n\n                                      FACTS\n\n      This court previously stated the relevant underlying facts as follows:\n\n      In 1986,[Kassahun] moved to Seattle .. . . He found work driving a\n      taxicab until he purchased a Texaco gas station in 1991.\n\n             . . . Kassahun hired [Fanaye Ashagari] to work at his gas           i\n      station as a cashier. They began a romantic relationship and, in\n      January 1998, they were married. The parties have three children.\n      Ashagari did not return to work outside the home after their first child\n      was born in 2001.\n\n\n\n            The parties bought a home together in 1999. They purchased\n      a taxicab license in 2000. In 2002, they acquired the Abyssinia\n      Market. . . . Over the years they were able to save a large sum of\n      money. In 2011, unbeknown to Ashagari, Kassahun withdrew\n      $187,000 from the joint bank account and invested $180,000 in\n      another taxicab license.\n\n             Kassahun paid himself a modest salary from his work at the\n      Abyssinia Market. His tax returns reflected the paychecks he wrote\n      to himself from the business account as well as his income from one\n      of the taxicabs. He reported an income from the taxicab licenses of\n      less than $1,000 a year. But at trial, Kassahun claimed to receive\n      $1,000 each month per taxicab, paid in cash. He provided no\n      documented proof of this income and stated that he does not keep\n      records of the income.\n\n\n\n              Kassahun and Ashagari separated on September 16, 2011.\n\nIn re Marriage of Ashagari and Kassahun, No. 71295-1-1, slip op. at 1-3(Wash.\n\nCt. App. March 23, 2015)(unpublished),\n\nhttp://www.courts.wasioviopinions/pdf/712951.pdf, review denied, 184 Wn.2d\n\n1012(2015).\n\n                                         2\n\f No. 75343-6-1/3\n\n\n        In July 2012, Ashagari petitioned for dissolution of the parties' marriage.\n\n Ashagari submitted a financial declaration that showed that she had total\n\n household monthly expenses of $6,485.54.1            This included payments on the\n\n parties' home equity loan and monthly expenses for the parties' children. She\n\n estimated that Kassahun earned between $10,000 and $12,000 per month in\n\n income from the Abyssinia Market (the Market) and taxicab licenses.\n\n        In August 2012, Kassahun filed a financial declaration that stated that his\n\n net monthly income was $4,015.56 and his total monthly expenses were\n\n $3,110.00. In June 2013, Kassahun submitted an amended financial declaration\n\n that stated his gross monthly income consisted of $3,000 in wages, $2,000 in\n\n business income from his taxicab' licenses, and $1,500 in other income. He\n\n declared that his total monthly expenses were $3,682.\n\n        The trial court issued a temporary order of child support requiring Kassahun\n\n to pay a monthly transfer amount of $2,111.26. The court imputed $11,000 in net\n\n monthly income to Kassahun, based on its finding that his income was unknown.\n\n The trial court imputed $1,500 of income per month to Ashagari. It also issued a\n\n temporary restraining order and an order of temporary relief requiring Kassahun to\n\n pay $1,000 per month in maintenance and pay the household bills.\n\n        Kassahun testified that these obligations made him destitute:2 Prior to trial,\n\n Kassahun obtained $50,000 from Taketu Truneh, allegedly to help pay his support\n\n\n'Ashagari filed a new financial declaration in June 2013 that listed her household monthly\nexpenses at $6,667.54.\n2 There are conflicting accounts as to whether Kassahun was destitute in 2012. For\nexample, Kassahun voluntarily paid the family's household expenses after moving out in\nSeptember 2011. He stopped making payments and claimed he was destitute after\nAshagari filed for divorce. Further, he leased a new Mercedes-Benz automobile in\n                                            3\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/4\n\n\nobligations; $9,000 remained at the time of trial. The trial court found these claims\n\nto be not credible. For example, Kassahun used part of these funds for personal\n\nexpenses and attorney fees.\n\n       At trial, Kassahun testified that he had a gross monthly income of $3,000,\n\nincome from two taxicab licenses of $2,000 per month,3 and an additional $1,200\n\nto $1,500 per month taken from the Market to pay personal expenses and a\n\nshareholder loan. He testified that his net monthly income was $4,714 and his\n\nmonthly expenses were $3,682. His testimony was corroborated by Steven\n\nKessler, a certified public accountant who had reviewed Kassahun's financial\n\nrecords.\n\n       The trial court found that Kassahun's total gross monthly income was\n\n$13,750. In re Ashagari, No. 71295-1-1, slip op. at 13. The trial court found that\n\nthe tax returns presented by the parties were unreliable due to Kassahun's low\n\nreported gross monthly income relative to his monthly expenses. In re Ashagari,\n\nNo. 71295-1-1, slip op. at 13. Also, Kassahun's testimony indicated that he realized\n\nuntaxed income from several sources.4 Based on its calculation of his gross\n\nmonthly income, the trial court ordered Kassahun to pay $1,347.72 per month in\n\nchild support and $5,000 per month in maintenance to Ashagari.\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2013 and incurred numerous personal expenses between when the divorce was\nfiled and trial.\n3 Kassahun did not report his income from at least one of the taxicabs to the IRS.\n4 At trial, Kassahun testified that he paid several Abyssinia Market employees in cash\nobtained from sales, which was unreported and untaxed. He also testified that he received\ncash payments from his two taxicab drivers but did not keep records, and only reported\nincome from one of the taxicabs on his personal income taxes.\n                                           4\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/5\n\n\n       On appeal, this court concluded that the trial court's findings for its\n\ncalculation of Kassahun's gross monthly income were insufficient to permit review.\n\nIn re Ashagari, No. 71295-1-1, slip op. at 13. This court remanded for further\n\nfindings on the calculation of Kassahun's gross monthly income, and recalculation\n\nof Kassahun's maintenance and support obligations if necessary. In re Ashaciari,\n\nNo. 71295-1-1, slip op. at 15.\n\n       On remand, the trial court determined that it had erred when it calculated\n\nKassahun's income, and found instead that his gross monthly income was\n\n$12,750. It based its determination on its previous findings, its oral ruling in July\n\n2013, and additional findings on remand. Also, the trial court changed the method\n\nit used to compute Kassahun's taxes so that his tax liability decreased by\n\napproximately $1,000. This increased his net monthly income from $4,814.34 to\n\n$5,399.52. The trial court adjusted Kassahun's child support obligation to $1,696\n\nper month but did not change his $5,000 per month maintenance obligation.\n\nAlthough the order of child support on remand was effective as of November 13,\n\n2013, the trial court used the current ages of the children, rather than the ages of\n\nthe children when the original order of child support was entered, to calculate\n\nKassahun's support obligation. This increased his monthly transfer amount to\n\n$1,592.73.\n\n       Kassahun appeals.\n\n                                    ANALYSIS\n\n       Trial court decisions in dissolution proceedings are reviewed for manifest\n\nabuse of discretion, and are rarely changed on appeal. In re Marriage of Griffin,\n\n\n                                         5\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/6\n\n\n114 Wn.2d 772, 776, 791 P.2d 519(1990) (citing In re Marriage of Landry, 103\n\nWn.2d 807, 809, 699 P.2d 214 (1985)). The party challenging a decision by the\n\ntrial court in a dissolution proceeding bears the burden of showing that the court\n\nmanifestly abused its discretion. Griffin, 114 Wn.2d at 776.\n\n      \"A trial court abuses its discretion if its decision is manifestly unreasonable\n\nor based on untenable grounds or untenable reasons.\" In re Marriage of Littlefield,\n\n133 Wn.2d 39, 46, 940 P.2d 1362(1997).\n\n             A court's decision is manifestly unreasonable if it is outside\n      the range of acceptable choices, given the facts and the applicable\n      legal standard; it is based on untenable grounds if the factual findings\n      are unsupported by the record; it is based on untenable reasons if it\n      is based on an incorrect standard or the facts do not meet the\n      requirements of the correct standard.\n\nLittlefield, 133 Wn.2d at 47.\n\n                         Kassahun Gross Monthly Income\n\n       Kassahun argues that the trial court abused its discretion in determining his\n\nchild support obligation because it was based on an erroneous calculation of his\n\ngross monthly income. He assigns error to a number of the trial court's findings\n\non remand and also argues that the trial court improperly relied on the financial\n\ndeclarations submitted by the parties to calculate his gross monthly income.\n\n       Findings on Remand\n\n       Kassahun assigns error to a number of the trial court's findings on remand\n\nrelated to its calculation of his gross monthly income. He argues that these findings\n\nwere not supported by substantial evidence in the record. We conclude that\n\nsubstantial evidence does support these findings.\n\n\n\n                                         6\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/7\n\n\n       \"[F]indings of fact supported by substantial evidence will not be disturbed\n\non appeal.\"    Bering v.

Miller\n\nv. McCamish, 78 Wn.2d 821, 831,479 P.2d 919 (1971).\n\n       Unchallenged findings of fact are verities on appeal. State v. Stenson, 132\n\nWn.2d 668, 697, 940 P.2d 1239(1997).\n\n       a. Reliability of Tax Returns\n\n       Kassahun first assigns error to the trial court's finding that his tax returns\n\nwere not reliable and that he admitted as much. The record contains several\n\nindications that Kassahun's tax returns would not be reliable measures of his\n\nincome. For example, Kassahun testified that he received $1,000 a month in cash\n\nfrom each of his two taxicab licenses. But he stated that he only reported income\n\nfor one of the taxicabs and did not keep records of the income he received.\n\nFurther, Kassahun testified that he used funds from his business to pay for\n\npersonal expenses,5 and did not keep records separating personal expenses from\n\n\n\n\n5For example, a payment to Vern Fonk Insurance because of a DUI and paying off various\npersonal credit cards.\n                                          7\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/8\n\n\nbusiness expenses.           Therefore, the record contains substantial evidence\n\nsupporting the trial court's finding that Kassahun's tax returns were not reliable\n\nmeasures of his income. The trial court's statement that Kassahun admitted to this\n\nis reasonably interpreted as a reference to his own admissions that he did not\n\nreport income on his tax returns and used business funds to pay personal\n\nexpenses.\n\n          Kassahun, relying on In re Marriage of Mansour, argues that the trial court\n\nhad to find an error in the tax return itself before finding it was unreliable. 126 Wn.\n\nApp. 1, 106 P.3d 768(2004). In Mansour, the trial court found that Mr. Mansour's\n\ntax returns were not an accurate measure of his income because he took tax\n\ndeductions that he was not entitled to. 126 Wn. App. at 13. But the reviewing\n\ncourt did not hold that errors in the tax return itself are the only appropriate basis\n\nfor deciding that a tax return is unreliable. Kassahun's own testimony showing that\n\nhis tax returns were unreliable constituted substantial evidence supporting the trial\n\ncourt's finding.\n\n          b. Reliability of Wage Statements\n\n          Kassahun next assigns error to the trial court's finding that Kassahun's\n\nwage statements were not a reliable measure of his income because he paid\n\nhimself a \"very small wage.\"6 Kassahun argues that the record does not show that\n\nhis wage was \"very small,\" or that the wage statements are unreliable. Kassahun\n\ndoes not elaborate on his challenge to the trial court's finding that he paid himself\n\na \"small wage.\"\n\n\n6   Br. of Appellant at 2.\n                                           8\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/9\n\n\n       The trial court's finding reads,\"The Respondent's wage statements are not\n\na reliable indicator of his income due to the fact that he pays himself a very small\n\nwage and used the same credit cards to purchase the inventory for his grocery\n\nstore and to pay the family's expense.\"7 Kassahun reported that he paid himself a\n\npretax wage of $3,000 per month from the Market. But he also wrote checks to\n\nhimself out of the Market's funds to pay personal expenses, used business credit\n\ncards for personal expenses, and took cash from the Market in addition to his\n\nreported wages. Further, the record shows that Kassahun had significant personal\n\nexpenses, many of which he paid using cash, which exceeded the reported\n\nexpenditures from his personal bank account.         Taken together, the record\n\ndemonstrates that Kassahun's spending behaviors did not match the $3,000 per\n\nmonth wage he paid himself from the Market. The trial court's finding that\n\nKassahun's wage statements were unreliable was supported by substantial\n\nevidence.\n\n       c. Failure to Segregate Business and Personal Expenses\n\n       Kassahun assigns error to the trial court's finding that he used the same\n\ncredit cards for business and personal expenses, and that he did not segregate\n\nhis personal expenses and report them as income. This finding is supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence. Kassahun concedes that he testified at trial that he used\n\nbusiness credit cards to pay for personal expenses. Furthermore, Kassahun took\n\nthousands of dollars from the Market, in addition to his wages, in 2012 alone.8\n\n\n\n\n7 Clerk's Papers(CP) at 394.\n8 Ex. 55.\n\n\n                                         9\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/10\n\n\n       Kassahun argues that he \"did try to segregate those items and report them\n\nas income,\" but does not support this argument with citations to the record.9 He\n\nalso argues that these expenses were included in the $1,200 to $1,500 per month\n\nhe and Kessler testified that he took from the Market to cover personal expenses.\n\nKessler did not review Kassahun's credit card statements for any year. Kessler\n\ndid not review Kassahun's personal bank statements from 2011 to 2013 in-depth.\n\nThe testimony offered by Kassahun and Kessler is insufficient to overcome the\n\nsubstantial evidence in the record that Kassahun used business credit cards to\n\npay personal expenses and failed to segregate these charges or declare them as\n\nincome.\n\n       d. Use of Business Cash\n\n       Kassahun assigns error to the trial court's finding that he had access to\n\nlarge amounts of cash through his business, which he used to pay his employees\n\nand for other personal expenses. Kassahun testified that he paid his employees\n\nin cash \"out of the till.\"1Â° He used funds from his business to pay for personal\n\nexpenses. He testified that he used his Macy's credit card and cash to pay for his\n\nsupervised visitation with his children. He also used cash to pay for a number of\n\npersonal expenses, including gas, recreational activities with his children, and a\n\ndomestic violence treatment program, in amounts that exceeded his reported\n\nexpenditures from his personal bank account. In sum, Kassahun testified to a\n\npattern of using business funds to pay for personal expenses, and his cash\n\n\n\n\n9 Br. of Appellant at 26.\n1Â° Br. of Appellant at 26; see Report of Proceedings (July 15, 2013) at 562-63.\n                                           10\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/11\n\n\nexpenditures did not match his reported payments from his personal bank account.\n\nAccordingly, substantial evidence supports this finding of fact.\"\n\n       e. Credit Card Debt\n\n       Kassahun assigns error to the trial court's finding that the parties did not\n\nhave credit card debt, and that they paid for expenses from the cash flow of the\n\nMarket and taxicab licenses and managed to save enough to purchase a second\n\ntaxicab license. Substantial evidence supports this finding as well. The financial\n\ndeclarations submitted by the parties in 2012 did not list credit card debt. In 2011,\n\nthe family had savings of $187,000, and Kassahun used $180,000 to invest in a\n\nsecond taxicab license.\n\n       Kassahun argues that at the time of trial he did have credit card debt. He\n\ntestified that he incurred $5,000 of debt on his AAA Visa card in March 2013to pay\n\nfor attorney fees, and that AAA Visa sent him a check for a $6,000 cash advance\n\nto put toward the debt. Other than the AAA Visa statement showing the deposit of\n\n$6,000, Kassahun did not offer documentary evidence to support his claim. The\n\ntrial court was free to disregard Kassahun's self-serving statement if it did not find\n\nhim credible. His argument is insufficient to show that the trial court's finding was\n\nnot supported by substantial evidence.\n\n       f. TaxiCab License Undocumented Income\n\n       Kassahun assigns error to the trial court's finding that he had\n\nundocumented income from the two cab licenses. He argues that his income from\n\n\n\n\" Kassahun also argues that there was no evidence that this cash was unreported or\ncame from an unverified source. The challenged finding does not say that the cash from\nthe Market was unreported or unverified.\n                                          11\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/12\n\n\nthe taxi licenses was in fact documented on his tax returns, bank records, and\n\nquarterly reports to the Department of Labor and Industries and the Department of\n\nRevenue. But, while the record shows the income that Kassahun reported,\n\nKassahun did not provide any documentation of the actual income he received.\n\nAnd evidence suggests there was unreported income. For example, Kassahun's\n\ntax returns for 2011 show that he reported only $755 of profit from the taxicab\n\nlicenses.12 He testified that he was paid $1,000 in cash per month from each of\n\nhis taxicab licenses, but almost all of his profits went toward paying the taxicabs'\n\nexpenses. He does not cite any documentary evidence showing that he was in\n\nfact paid $1,000 per month per taxicab, or evidence supporting his argument that\n\nessentially all of these profits went toward maintaining the taxicabs. In fact, he\n\ntestified that he did not keep a ledger or other record of the money he received.\n\nThe trial court's finding that Kassahun did not document his income from the\n\ntaxicab licenses was supported by substantial evidence.\n\n       g. Parties' Total Monthly Expenditures\n\n       Kassahun argues that the trial court's finding that the parties' total monthly\n\nexpenditures were $8,700 was not supported by substantial evidence. Kassahun\n\nalleges that the trial court did not sufficiently explain which expenses it considered\n\nor what duplications it eliminated. The trial court stated that it \"looked at the\n\nexpenditures that the parties submitted in these financial declarations under\n\n\n\n\n12As discussed above, Kassahun only reported income for one of his taxicab licenses on\nhis tax returns. At trial, he testified that he received $1,000 in cash per month from each\nof his two taxicabs. The total listed income of $23,752 appears to possibly include the\nalleged income from both taxicabs. Neither party addresses this discrepancy in depth.\n                                            12\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/13\n\n\npenalty of perjury and eliminated duplications. The Court added up the expenses,\n\nminus Mr. Kassahun's housing and utilities, and reached a figure of about\n\n$8,700.\"13 Each party's financial declaration lists monthly expense information.\n\nThe trial court set forth its methodology for reaching its final figure. The record\n\ncontains substantial evidence showing the basis for the trial court's decision.\n\n         h. Kassahun Saving Ability\n\n         Kassahun argues that the trial court's finding that Kassahun was able to\n\nsave approximately $1,500 per month during the parties' marriage was not\n\nsupported by substantial evidence. The parties were married in January 1996. In\n\nre Ashaqari, No. 71295-1-1, slip op. at 2. In 2011, Kassahun withdrew $187,000\n\nfrom the parties' joint bank account. In re Ashagari, No. 71295-1-1, slip op. at 2.\n\nThe trial court's finding that this figure represented savings the parties had accrued\n\nover 10 years was supported by substantial evidence in the record.\n\n         i. Credibility of Witnesses\n\n         Kassahun assigns error to the trial court's finding that Kessler, Kassahun's\n\nexpert, was not credible because he did not have access to sufficient records and\n\ndid not provide a reliable estimate of the amount of cash available to Kassahun.\n\nKessler's testimony demonstrates that the trial court had reason to question\n\nKessler's credibility. Kessler stated that he based his valuation on the wages\n\nKassahun paid himself from the Market, Kassahun's income from the taxicab\n\nlicenses, income from his shareholder loan, and normalization for Kassahun's use\n\nof business funds for personal expenses. But Kessler also testified that he did not\n\n\n13   CP at 396.\n                                          13\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/14\n\n\nreview Kassahun's personal bank statements extensively, and did not review\n\nKassahun's credit card statements at all. The court's finding that Kessler was not\n\ncredible is supported by substantial evidence in the record.\n\n       Kassahun also assigns error to the trial court's finding that Kassahun was\n\nnot credible when he testified he was forced to borrow money for his maintenance\n\nand child support obligations because he used the money for personal expenses\n\nand attorney fees. This court does not review credibility determinations.\n\n       Calculation of Kassahun's Gross Monthly Income\n\n       Kassahun argues that this court should vacate the trial court's maintenance\n\nand child support orders. He contends that the trial court abused its discretion by\n\ncalculating his income based on the expenditures alleged in the parties' financial\n\ndeclarations. Because courts may look to financial declarations to calculate the\n\ngross income of parties and the trial court's underlying findings of fact were\n\nsupported by substantial evidence, we disagree.\n\n       When the court determines the child support obligation of each parent, it\n\nshould consider lap income and resources of each parent's household.\" RCW\n\n26.19.071(1). When calculating a parent's gross monthly income, the court\n\nincludes income from many different sources, including salaries, wages, income\n\nfrom second jobs, maintenance actually received, and income from self-\n\nemployment or proprietorship of a business. RCW 26.19.071(3).\n\n       Offered income and deductions must be verified by tax returns for the past\n\ntwo years or current paystubs, and \"[o]ther sufficient verification\" is required to\n\n\n\n\n                                        14\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/15\n\n\nverify \"income and deductions which do not appear on tax returns or paystubs.\"\n\nRCW 26.19.071(2).\n\n      \"RCW 26.19.071(1) does not require that the court make a precise\n\ndetermination of income. Instead, the court is required to consider all income and\n\nresources of each parent's household.\" In re Marriage of Marzetta, 129 Wn. App.\n\n607, 623, 120 P.3d 75 (2005). An appellate court \"must presume that the [trial]\n\ncourt considered all evidence before it in fashioning [an order of child support].\" In\n\nre Marriage of Kelly, 85 Wn. App. 785, 793, 934 P.2d 1218(1997).\n\n       A trial court's determination of child support is reviewed for abuse of\n\ndiscretion. In re Marriage of Fiorito, 112 Wn. App. 657, 663, 50 P.3d 298(2002).\n\nA trial court abuses its discretion if its decision is manifestly unreasonable or based\n\non untenable grounds, including an erroneous view of the law. Fiorito, 112 Wn.\n\nApp. at 663-64.\n\n       Use of Financial Statements\n\n       Kassahun first argues that the trial court erroneously relied on the financial\n\ndeclarations of the parties to calculate his gross monthly income. Because courts\n\nmay look to the parties' financial declarations when calculating income, we\n\ndisagree.\n\n       A trial court may consider the financial declarations submitted by parties\n\nthroughout dissolution proceedings. See, e.g., In re Marriage of Zacapu, 192 Wn.\n\nApp. 700, 709, 368 P.3d 242(2016)(trial court did not abuse its discretion when it\n\nconsidered the parties' financial declarations to calculate a deviation from the\n\nobligor's standard calculation); In re Marriage of Avvad, 110 Wn. App. 462, 474,\n\n\n                                          15\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/16\n\n\n38 P.3d 1033(2002)(consideration of stock options listed in financial declaration\n\nwhen determining financial status of the parties when evaluating attorney fee\n\naward); Brandli v. Talley, 98 Wn. App. 521, 527, 991 P.2d 94 (1999) (trial court\n\nerred when it denied party's request for deviation when it failed to consider\n\nsubstantial assets listed in opposing party's financial declaration). These cases\n\ndemonstrate that Washington trial courts have frequently looked to the financial\n\ndeclarations submitted by the parties during a dissolution proceeding.\n\n       Here, the trial court found that the parties' monthly expenses totaled\n\napproximately $8,700 by adding up the expenses in their financial declarations and\n\nsubtracting Kassahun's housing and utilities. It used this value and the parties'\n\nsaving ability to reach a net monthly income, adjusted for taxes, and found that\n\nKassahun's gross monthly income was $12,750. The trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion when it used the financial declarations of the parties to calculate\n\nKassahun's income for purposes of determining its final order of child support.\n\n       Kassahun cites In re Marriage of Trichak to argue that this court has\n\nrejected the use of financial declarations to verify income, and instead requires the\n\nuse of tax returns. 72 Wn. App. 21, 26-27, 863 P.2d 585 (1993). Kassahun\n\nmisconstrues the holding of Trichak. There, Mr. Trichak contended that the trial\n\ncourt erred in using the $1,255 figure listed on Ms. Trichak's support schedule\n\nworksheet as her gross monthly income instead of the $2,000 figure provided on\n\nher financial affidavit. 72 Wn. App. at 23. The Court of Appeals disagreed,\n\nbecause the value listed on the financial affidavit was marked as an estimate and\n\n\n\n\n                                         16\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/17\n\n\nthe support schedule figure was supported by Ms. Trichak's reliable tax returns.\n\nTrichak, 72 Wn. App. at 26-27.\n\n       Kassahun next argues that the expenditures listed in the financial\n\ndeclarations of the parties are inherently less reliable than the incomes listed in the\n\nfinancial declarations. He does not cite to legal authority in support of this\n\nargument. He has not otherwise shown that the use of the expenditures listed in\n\nfinancial declarations is in and of itself an abuse of discretion by the trial court.\n\n       Kassahun argues that the only calculation of income that the record\n\nsupports is approximately $6,500, consisting of the $3,000 in W-2 wages from the\n\nMarket, $2,000 per month in income from the taxicab licenses, and $1,500 per\n\nmonth of business expenses to cover personal expenses listed in his financial\n\ndeclaration. He also relies on his testimony that he was compelled to borrow\n\n$50,000 to meet his child support and maintenance obligations in 2012.\n\n       The figures Kassahun offered necessarily rely on the accuracy of his tax\n\nreturns and the credibility of his testimony at trial. But as discussed above, the trial\n\ncourt's findings that Kassahun's documents and testimony were unreliable were\n\nsupported by substantial evidence. Further, Kassahun does not challenge the trial\n\ncourt's finding that Kassahun's claims that he was destitute and was forced to\n\nborrow money to meet his obligations were not credible because he used the funds\n\nfor personal expenses and attorney fees. Therefore, it was within the trial court's\n\ndiscretion to look to the sworn financial declarations of the parties, rather than the\n\n\n\n\n                                           17\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/18\n\n\nfinancial documents and testimony submitted by Kassahun, to calculate\n\nKassahun's gross monthly income.14\n\n       Use of Saving Ability to Calculate Kassahun's Gross Monthly Income\n\n       Kassahun argues that the trial court erred when it considered his ability to\n\nsave during the parties' marriage in its calculation of his gross monthly income.\n\nSpecifically, he argues that there was no evidence that he had any ability to save\n\nmoney at the time the trial court entered its order of child support in November\n\n2013. Because he has not offered persuasive legal authority or citations to the\n\nrecord in support of this argument, we disagree.\n\n       Kassahun cites In re Marriage of Scanlon, 109 Wn. App. 167, 34 P.3d 877\n\n(2001) and In re Marriage of Payne, 82 Wn. App. 147, 916 P.2d 968(1996). The\n\nScanlon court involved a former husband's request for downward modification of\n\nhis child support obligation, as well as reallocation of visitation-related travel\n\nexpenses and federal income tax credits. 109 Wn. App. at 171. The Payne court\n\nheld that past earnings were not a relevant measure of gross monthly income\n\nwhere a party's income had changed. 82 Wn. App. at 152.\n\n       Neither case supports Kassahun's position. Scanlon involved a motion to\n\nmodify an existing child support obligation in light of an alleged reduction in\n\nincome. Similarly, Payne, involved a reduction in a party's income that rendered\n\npast earnings irrelevant. Here, the record does not show that Kassahun's income\n\n\n\n\n14 The trial court provided an alternate method of calculating Kassahun's gross monthly\nincome based on Kassahun's monthly expenditures. Because the trial court did not abuse\nits discretion when it looked to the parties' financial declarations to calculate Kassahun's\ngross monthly income, we need not review its alternate calculation method.\n                                            18\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/19\n\n\nor ability to save changed from the time the parties were married until the trial court\n\nentered its order of child support.\n\n       Kassahun also argues that his being forced to take out a loan to meet his\n\nsupport obligations demonstrates that he had no ability to save at the time the trial\n\ncourt entered its order of child support. But the trial court found that Kassahun's\n\nclaim that he was forced to borrow money was not credible, a finding that\n\nKassahun does not challenge on appeal. Moreover, Kassahun leased a new\n\nMercedes in February 2013 despite his claims of poverty beginning in October\n\n2012. Kassahun's citation to the purported loan does not support his claim that\n\nhis ability to save had changed.\n\n        In sum, Kassahun has not demonstrated that his income or ability to save\n\nchanged significantly in the time between the parties' filing of financial documents\n\nand the trial court's final order.\n\n        Total Gross Monthly Income\n\n       Kassahun assigns error to the trial court's finding that his gross monthly\n\nincome was $12,750. Because the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it\n\nlooked to the parties' financial declarations to calculate Kassahun's gross monthly\n\nincome and its underlying findings of fact were supported by substantial evidence,\n\nwe find no error.15\n\n\n15 Ashagari attached the trial court's \"Final Order and Findings on Petition to Modify Child\nSupport and Maintenance Order, Corrected to add debtor and creditor names to Â¶1\" to\nher appellate brief. She refers to the final order several times in support of her arguments\nregarding Kassahun's gross monthly income and the trial court's decision to not impute\nmaintenance to her. The order and findings on remand at issue in the present appeal was\nentered March 17, 2016, while the final order was entered May 26, 2016. The final order\nis subject to a separate appeal. Court of Appeals No. 75496-3-1. Kassahun filed a motion\nto strike the final order and all references thereto on February 23, 2017. The final order\n                                            19\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/20\n\n\n             Verification of Expenditures by Other Sufficient Verification\n\n       Kassahun argues that the trial court's maintenance and child support orders\n\nare erroneous because they relied on the expenditures alleged in the parties'\n\nfinancial declarations, which were not sufficiently supported by \"[o]ther sufficient\n\nverification,\" as required by RCW 26.19.071(2). Because Ashagari submitted\n\nsubstantial financial documentation in support of her claimed expenses and\n\ntestified to them at trial, we conclude that they were supported by other sufficient\n\nverification.\n\n       \"Tax returns for the preceding two years and current paystubs shall be\n\nprovided to verify income and deductions. Other sufficient verification shall be\n\nrequired for income and deductions which do not appear on tax returns or\n\npaystubs.\"      RCW 26.19.071(2).      This verification may be through adequate\n\nindependent records documenting actual income. In re Marriage of Bucklin, 70\n\nWn. App. 837, 841, 855 P.2d 1197 (1993).\n\n       Trial court decisions in dissolution proceedings are reviewed for manifest\n\nabuse of discretion. Landry, 103 Wn.2d at 809.\n\n       Kassahun argues that Ashagari did not provide independent records\n\nsupporting her claimed expenses.16 But Ashagari submitted large numbers of\n\nfinancial documents for the trial court's consideration. These included income tax\n\nrecords, credit card statements, bank statements, checks, home mortgage\n\n\n\nis not properly before this court and has been offered for an improper purpose. Thus, we\ngrant Kassahun's motion to strike the final order.\n16 In his reply brief, Kassahun argues for the first time that these documents are hearsay\nbecause they were not sufficiently authenticated or verified. ER 802. We need not\naddress this argument. RAP 10.3(c).\n                                           20\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/21\n\n\nrecords, business records, and records of household expenses. Ashagari also\n\ntestified at trial about her claimed. expenses. The trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion when it looked to these documents and Ashagari's testimony at trial as\n\n\"[o]ther sufficient verification\" of her claimed expenses. RCW 26.19.071(2).\n\n       Among his general challenges to Ashagari's claimed expenses as lacking\n\nverification, Kassahun argues that she erroneously claimed an expense for\n\ninstallment payments for the home equity loan. Kassahun argues that the Market\n\nitself made these payments, not Ashagari.\n\n       This court will not disturb a trial court's credibility determinations. Currier v.\n\nNorthland Servs., Inc., 182 Wn. App. 733, 741, 332 P.3d 1006 (2014), review\n\ndenied, 182 Wn.2d 1006 (2015).\n\n       Kassahun did not submit documentary evidence supporting his claim that\n\nthe Market paid for the home equity loan, rather than the family. The Chase home\n\nequity statements submitted by Ashagari shows that the home equity loan listed\n\nboth her and Kassahun, and installment payments of $730.28 were made in\n\nOctober 2011 and April 2012. The trial court's findings show that it did not find\n\nKassahun's self-serving and unsupported testimony credible, and we will not\n\ndisturb that determination on appeal.\n\n                                  Maintenance Award\n\n       Kassahun argues that the trial court abused its discretion because its\n\nmaintenance award did not show that it had fairly considered the relevant statutory\n\nfactors. Because the trial court referred to the statutory factors in its initial findings\n\n\n\n\n                                           21\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/22\n\n\nand reiterated that it found that Kassahun could meet his obligations on remand,\n\nwe disagree.\n\n       In a dissolution proceeding, the court may grant a maintenance award for\n\neither spouse or domestic partner. RCW 26.09.090(1). The court may enter a\n\nmaintenance order for an amount and length of time the court deems just, without\n\nregard to misconduct. RCW 26.09.090(1). The statute includes a nonexclusive\n\nlist of factors a court may consider, including the financial resources of the party\n\nseeking maintenance, the standard of living established during the marriage, and\n\nthe ability of the obligor spouse to pay maintenance while meeting his or her own\n\nneeds. RCW 26.09.090(1)(a)-(f).\n\n       An award of maintenance is within the trial court's discretion. In re Marriage\n\nof Matthews, 70 Wn. App. 116, 123, 853 P.2d 462(1993). A trial court abuses its\n\ndiscretion if its award of spousal maintenance does not evidence a fair\n\nconsideration of the statutory factors used in determining its award. Spreen v.\n\nSpreen, 107 Wn. App. 341, 349, 28 P.3d 769(2001).\n\n       In its initial findings, the trial court explicitly referred to the factors listed in\n\nRCW 26.09.090. It found that Kassahun had significant earning capacity and\n\nfinancial resources, including those he did not disclose. It also considered that\n\nAshagari had few job skills, and found that maintenance was necessary to allow\n\nher to attend school and obtain additional training. On remand, the trial court\n\nstated that its previous maintenance award would remain unchanged. The trial\n\ncourt properly considered the factors contained in RCW 26.09.090, and thus did\n\nnot abuse its discretion.\n\n\n                                            22\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/23\n\n\n        Kassahun argues that the trial court abused its discretion by finding that he\n\nhad an earning capacity and financial resources that exceeded what he claimed.\n\nAs discussed above, the trial court's findings that Kassahun did not report all of his\n\nincome on his tax returns, used business funds for personal expenses, and was\n\nnot credible when testifying to his financial status were supported by substantial\n\nevidence. He does not offer new arguments for why the trial court's finding was\n\nnot supported by substantial evidence.\n\n       Kassahun also argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it found\n\nthat he could pay $5,000 per month in maintenance while still meeting his financial\n\nobligations.    He does not offer citation to the record or further argument\n\nestablishing that he is unable to pay. This is insufficient to show that the trial court\n\nabused its discretion.\n\n                                     Trial Court Bias\n\n       Kassahun argues that the trial court's rulings were the result of bias against\n\nhim or based on a consideration of his fault or misconduct.17 Because Kassahun\n\nhas not offered any evidence or supporting authority for his arguments, we\n\nconclude that Kassahun has not shown that the trial court was biased against him.\n\n       A court may not consider a party's misconduct when determining a\n\nmaintenance award. RCW 26.09.090(1); In re Marriage of Muhammad,153 Wn.2d\n\n795, 803-04, 108 P.3d 779(2005).\n\n\n17In his reply brief, Kassahun cites to the court's finding that he engaged in marital\nmisconduct. In the trial court's original findings in support of its parenting plan, the court\nnoted that Kassahun's history of domestic violence necessitated restrictions under RCW\n26.09.191. The trial court's decision regarding the parenting plan is not at issue in this\nappeal, and there is nothing to indicate that this finding impacted its decisions regarding\nKassahun's gross monthly income.\n                                             23\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/24\n\n\n       We presume that a trial judge properly discharged her official duties without\n\nbias or prejudice. Jones v. Halvorson-Berg, 69 Wn. App. 117, 127, 847 P.2d 945\n\n(1993)(citing Kay Corp. v. Anderson, 72 Wn.2d 879, 885, 436 P.2d 459 (1967)).\n\nThe party seeking to overcome that presumption must provide specific facts\n\nestablishing bias. State v. Post, 118 Wn.2d 596,619 n.9, 826 P.2d 172, 837 P.2d\n\n599 (1992).\n\n       The only grounds Kassahun relies on to demonstrate bias are allegedly\n\nerroneous legal decisions made by the trial court. He first argues that the trial\n\ncourt's methods of calculating his income on remand were \"patently flawed\" and\n\nconstituted an abuse of discretion because the trial court decreased its calculation\n\nof his gross monthly income but changed the way it calculated his taxes so that his\n\nnet monthly income increased by $1,000.18 Kassahun does not cite to legal\n\nauthority in support of this argument. He has also not demonstrated that the trial\n\ncourt is restricted to its original method of calculating his gross monthly income on\n\nremand. This is insufficient to overcome the presumption that the trial court did\n\nnot act with bias or prejudice towards Kassahun.\n\n       Kassahun next argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it used\n\nthe current ages of the children when it entered its order of child support on remand\n\nin November 2013, rather than the ages of the children when the original order of\n\nchild support was entered.19 Again, he does not cite to legal authority in support\n\n\n\n\n18 Br. of Appellant at 45-46.\n18 In his reply brief, Kassahun argues for the first time that the trial court erroneously\ndivided the parties' property in favor of Ashagari.

He has not shown that\n\nthe trial court had to use the children's ages when it entered its original order as\n\nopposed to its new order created on remand. This is insufficient to overcome the\n\npresumption that the trial court did not act with bias or prejudice towards Kassahun.\n\n       Kassahun's unsupported allegations of bias or improper consideration of\n\nmisconduct or fault are insufficient to show that the trial court abused its discretion\n\nwhen it recalculated his gross monthly income or when it used the current ages of\n\nthe children when constructing its award of child support on remand.\n\n                           Imputation of Income to Ashaqari\n\n       Kassahun argues for the first time on appeal that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by declining to impute income to Ashagari. \"The appellate court may\n\nrefuse to review any claim of error which was not raised in the trial court.\" RAP\n\n2.5(a). Kassahun did not challenge the trial court's refusal to impute income to\n\nAshagari in his first appeal, and the case was remanded for the specific purpose\n\nof the trial court making specific findings to support its determination of Kassahun's\n\nincome. In re Ashagari, No. 71295-1-1, slip op. at 14. Because Kassahun raises\n\nthis argument for the first time in his second appeal in the case, we decline to reach\n\nthe merits of the issue.\n\n                              Attorney Fees and Costs\n\n       Ashagari requests that this court order Kassahun to pay her reasonable\n\nattorney fees and costs.\n\n       In a dissolution proceeding, the court may order a party to pay the\n\nreasonable attorney fees and costs of the other party after considering the financial\n\n\n                                          25\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/26\n\n\nresources of both parties.

In contrast, on remand Kassahun was found to\n\nhave a monthly income of $12,750.

Finding no error, we affirm.\n\n                                      FACTS\n\n      This court previously stated the relevant underlying facts as follows:\n\n      In 1986,[Kassahun] moved to Seattle .. . . He found work driving a\n      taxicab until he purchased a Texaco gas station in 1991.\n\n             . . . Kassahun hired [Fanaye Ashagari] to work at his gas           i\n      station as a cashier. They began a romantic relationship and, in\n      January 1998, they were married. The parties have three children.\n      Ashagari did not return to work outside the home after their first child\n      was born in 2001.\n\n\n\n            The parties bought a home together in 1999. They purchased\n      a taxicab license in 2000. In 2002, they acquired the Abyssinia\n      Market. . . . Over the years they were able to save a large sum of\n      money. In 2011, unbeknown to Ashagari, Kassahun withdrew\n      $187,000 from the joint bank account and invested $180,000 in\n      another taxicab license.\n\n             Kassahun paid himself a modest salary from his work at the\n      Abyssinia Market. His tax returns reflected the paychecks he wrote\n      to himself from the business account as well as his income from one\n      of the taxicabs. He reported an income from the taxicab licenses of\n      less than $1,000 a year. But at trial, Kassahun claimed to receive\n      $1,000 each month per taxicab, paid in cash. He provided no\n      documented proof of this income and stated that he does not keep\n      records of the income.\n\n\n\n              Kassahun and Ashagari separated on September 16, 2011.\n\nIn re Marriage of Ashagari and Kassahun, No. 71295-1-1, slip op. at 1-3(Wash.\n\nCt.

She\n\n estimated that Kassahun earned between $10,000 and $12,000 per month in\n\n income from the Abyssinia Market (the Market) and taxicab licenses.\n\n        In August 2012, Kassahun filed a financial declaration that stated that his\n\n net monthly income was $4,015.56 and his total monthly expenses were\n\n $3,110.00. In June 2013, Kassahun submitted an amended financial declaration\n\n that stated his gross monthly income consisted of $3,000 in wages, $2,000 in\n\n business income from his taxicab' licenses, and $1,500 in other income. He\n\n declared that his total monthly expenses were $3,682.\n\n        The trial court issued a temporary order of child support requiring Kassahun\n\n to pay a monthly transfer amount of $2,111.26. The court imputed $11,000 in net\n\n monthly income to Kassahun, based on its finding that his income was unknown.\n\n The trial court imputed $1,500 of income per month to Ashagari. It also issued a\n\n temporary restraining order and an order of temporary relief requiring Kassahun to\n\n pay $1,000 per month in maintenance and pay the household bills.\n\n        Kassahun testified that these obligations made him destitute:2 Prior to trial,\n\n Kassahun obtained $50,000 from Taketu Truneh, allegedly to help pay his support\n\n\n'Ashagari filed a new financial declaration in June 2013 that listed her household monthly\nexpenses at $6,667.54.\n2 There are conflicting accounts as to whether Kassahun was destitute in 2012. For\nexample, Kassahun voluntarily paid the family's household expenses after moving out in\nSeptember 2011. He stopped making payments and claimed he was destitute after\nAshagari filed for divorce. Further, he leased a new Mercedes-Benz automobile in\n                                            3\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/4\n\n\nobligations; $9,000 remained at the time of trial. The trial court found these claims\n\nto be not credible. For example, Kassahun used part of these funds for personal\n\nexpenses and attorney fees.\n\n       At trial, Kassahun testified that he had a gross monthly income of $3,000,\n\nincome from two taxicab licenses of $2,000 per month,3 and an additional $1,200\n\nto $1,500 per month taken from the Market to pay personal expenses and a\n\nshareholder loan. He testified that his net monthly income was $4,714 and his\n\nmonthly expenses were $3,682. His testimony was corroborated by Steven\n\nKessler, a certified public accountant who had reviewed Kassahun's financial\n\nrecords.\n\n       The trial court found that Kassahun's total gross monthly income was\n\n$13,750. In re Ashagari, No. 71295-1-1, slip op. at 13. The trial court found that\n\nthe tax returns presented by the parties were unreliable due to Kassahun's low\n\nreported gross monthly income relative to his monthly expenses. In re Ashagari,\n\nNo. 71295-1-1, slip op. at 13. Also, Kassahun's testimony indicated that he realized\n\nuntaxed income from several sources.4 Based on its calculation of his gross\n\nmonthly income, the trial court ordered Kassahun to pay $1,347.72 per month in\n\nchild support and $5,000 per month in maintenance to Ashagari.\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2013 and incurred numerous personal expenses between when the divorce was\nfiled and trial.\n3 Kassahun did not report his income from at least one of the taxicabs to the IRS.\n4 At trial, Kassahun testified that he paid several Abyssinia Market employees in cash\nobtained from sales, which was unreported and untaxed. He also testified that he received\ncash payments from his two taxicab drivers but did not keep records, and only reported\nincome from one of the taxicabs on his personal income taxes.\n                                           4\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/5\n\n\n       On appeal, this court concluded that the trial court's findings for its\n\ncalculation of Kassahun's gross monthly income were insufficient to permit review.\n\nIn re Ashagari, No. 71295-1-1, slip op. at 13. This court remanded for further\n\nfindings on the calculation of Kassahun's gross monthly income, and recalculation\n\nof Kassahun's maintenance and support obligations if necessary. In re Ashaciari,\n\nNo. 71295-1-1, slip op. at 15.\n\n       On remand, the trial court determined that it had erred when it calculated\n\nKassahun's income, and found instead that his gross monthly income was\n\n$12,750. It based its determination on its previous findings, its oral ruling in July\n\n2013, and additional findings on remand. Also, the trial court changed the method\n\nit used to compute Kassahun's taxes so that his tax liability decreased by\n\napproximately $1,000. This increased his net monthly income from $4,814.34 to\n\n$5,399.52. The trial court adjusted Kassahun's child support obligation to $1,696\n\nper month but did not change his $5,000 per month maintenance obligation.\n\nAlthough the order of child support on remand was effective as of November 13,\n\n2013, the trial court used the current ages of the children, rather than the ages of\n\nthe children when the original order of child support was entered, to calculate\n\nKassahun's support obligation. This increased his monthly transfer amount to\n\n$1,592.73.\n\n       Kassahun appeals.\n\n                                    ANALYSIS\n\n       Trial court decisions in dissolution proceedings are reviewed for manifest\n\nabuse of discretion, and are rarely changed on appeal.

Reliability of Tax Returns\n\n       Kassahun first assigns error to the trial court's finding that his tax returns\n\nwere not reliable and that he admitted as much. The record contains several\n\nindications that Kassahun's tax returns would not be reliable measures of his\n\nincome. For example, Kassahun testified that he received $1,000 a month in cash\n\nfrom each of his two taxicab licenses. But he stated that he only reported income\n\nfor one of the taxicabs and did not keep records of the income he received.\n\nFurther, Kassahun testified that he used funds from his business to pay for\n\npersonal expenses,5 and did not keep records separating personal expenses from\n\n\n\n\n5For example, a payment to Vern Fonk Insurance because of a DUI and paying off various\npersonal credit cards.\n                                          7\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/8\n\n\nbusiness expenses.           Therefore, the record contains substantial evidence\n\nsupporting the trial court's finding that Kassahun's tax returns were not reliable\n\nmeasures of his income. The trial court's statement that Kassahun admitted to this\n\nis reasonably interpreted as a reference to his own admissions that he did not\n\nreport income on his tax returns and used business funds to pay personal\n\nexpenses.\n\n          Kassahun, relying on In re Marriage of Mansour, argues that the trial court\n\nhad to find an error in the tax return itself before finding it was unreliable. 126 Wn.\n\nApp. 1, 106 P.3d 768(2004). In Mansour, the trial court found that Mr. Mansour's\n\ntax returns were not an accurate measure of his income because he took tax\n\ndeductions that he was not entitled to. 126 Wn. App. at 13. But the reviewing\n\ncourt did not hold that errors in the tax return itself are the only appropriate basis\n\nfor deciding that a tax return is unreliable. Kassahun's own testimony showing that\n\nhis tax returns were unreliable constituted substantial evidence supporting the trial\n\ncourt's finding.\n\n          b. Reliability of Wage Statements\n\n          Kassahun next assigns error to the trial court's finding that Kassahun's\n\nwage statements were not a reliable measure of his income because he paid\n\nhimself a \"very small wage.\"6 Kassahun argues that the record does not show that\n\nhis wage was \"very small,\" or that the wage statements are unreliable. Kassahun\n\ndoes not elaborate on his challenge to the trial court's finding that he paid himself\n\na \"small wage.\"\n\n\n6   Br. of Appellant at 2.\n                                           8\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/9\n\n\n       The trial court's finding reads,\"The Respondent's wage statements are not\n\na reliable indicator of his income due to the fact that he pays himself a very small\n\nwage and used the same credit cards to purchase the inventory for his grocery\n\nstore and to pay the family's expense.\"7 Kassahun reported that he paid himself a\n\npretax wage of $3,000 per month from the Market. But he also wrote checks to\n\nhimself out of the Market's funds to pay personal expenses, used business credit\n\ncards for personal expenses, and took cash from the Market in addition to his\n\nreported wages. Further, the record shows that Kassahun had significant personal\n\nexpenses, many of which he paid using cash, which exceeded the reported\n\nexpenditures from his personal bank account.         Taken together, the record\n\ndemonstrates that Kassahun's spending behaviors did not match the $3,000 per\n\nmonth wage he paid himself from the Market. The trial court's finding that\n\nKassahun's wage statements were unreliable was supported by substantial\n\nevidence.\n\n       c. Failure to Segregate Business and Personal Expenses\n\n       Kassahun assigns error to the trial court's finding that he used the same\n\ncredit cards for business and personal expenses, and that he did not segregate\n\nhis personal expenses and report them as income. This finding is supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence. Kassahun concedes that he testified at trial that he used\n\nbusiness credit cards to pay for personal expenses. Furthermore, Kassahun took\n\nthousands of dollars from the Market, in addition to his wages, in 2012 alone.8\n\n\n\n\n7 Clerk's Papers(CP) at 394.\n8 Ex. 55.\n\n\n                                         9\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/10\n\n\n       Kassahun argues that he \"did try to segregate those items and report them\n\nas income,\" but does not support this argument with citations to the record.9 He\n\nalso argues that these expenses were included in the $1,200 to $1,500 per month\n\nhe and Kessler testified that he took from the Market to cover personal expenses.\n\nKessler did not review Kassahun's credit card statements for any year. Kessler\n\ndid not review Kassahun's personal bank statements from 2011 to 2013 in-depth.\n\nThe testimony offered by Kassahun and Kessler is insufficient to overcome the\n\nsubstantial evidence in the record that Kassahun used business credit cards to\n\npay personal expenses and failed to segregate these charges or declare them as\n\nincome.\n\n       d. Use of Business Cash\n\n       Kassahun assigns error to the trial court's finding that he had access to\n\nlarge amounts of cash through his business, which he used to pay his employees\n\nand for other personal expenses. Kassahun testified that he paid his employees\n\nin cash \"out of the till.\"1Â° He used funds from his business to pay for personal\n\nexpenses. He testified that he used his Macy's credit card and cash to pay for his\n\nsupervised visitation with his children. He also used cash to pay for a number of\n\npersonal expenses, including gas, recreational activities with his children, and a\n\ndomestic violence treatment program, in amounts that exceeded his reported\n\nexpenditures from his personal bank account. In sum, Kassahun testified to a\n\npattern of using business funds to pay for personal expenses, and his cash\n\n\n\n\n9 Br. of Appellant at 26.\n1Â° Br. of Appellant at 26; see Report of Proceedings (July 15, 2013) at 562-63.\n                                           10\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/11\n\n\nexpenditures did not match his reported payments from his personal bank account.\n\nAccordingly, substantial evidence supports this finding of fact.\"\n\n       e. Credit Card Debt\n\n       Kassahun assigns error to the trial court's finding that the parties did not\n\nhave credit card debt, and that they paid for expenses from the cash flow of the\n\nMarket and taxicab licenses and managed to save enough to purchase a second\n\ntaxicab license. Substantial evidence supports this finding as well. The financial\n\ndeclarations submitted by the parties in 2012 did not list credit card debt. In 2011,\n\nthe family had savings of $187,000, and Kassahun used $180,000 to invest in a\n\nsecond taxicab license.\n\n       Kassahun argues that at the time of trial he did have credit card debt. He\n\ntestified that he incurred $5,000 of debt on his AAA Visa card in March 2013to pay\n\nfor attorney fees, and that AAA Visa sent him a check for a $6,000 cash advance\n\nto put toward the debt. Other than the AAA Visa statement showing the deposit of\n\n$6,000, Kassahun did not offer documentary evidence to support his claim. The\n\ntrial court was free to disregard Kassahun's self-serving statement if it did not find\n\nhim credible. His argument is insufficient to show that the trial court's finding was\n\nnot supported by substantial evidence.\n\n       f. TaxiCab License Undocumented Income\n\n       Kassahun assigns error to the trial court's finding that he had\n\nundocumented income from the two cab licenses. He argues that his income from\n\n\n\n\" Kassahun also argues that there was no evidence that this cash was unreported or\ncame from an unverified source. The challenged finding does not say that the cash from\nthe Market was unreported or unverified.\n                                          11\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/12\n\n\nthe taxi licenses was in fact documented on his tax returns, bank records, and\n\nquarterly reports to the Department of Labor and Industries and the Department of\n\nRevenue. But, while the record shows the income that Kassahun reported,\n\nKassahun did not provide any documentation of the actual income he received.\n\nAnd evidence suggests there was unreported income. For example, Kassahun's\n\ntax returns for 2011 show that he reported only $755 of profit from the taxicab\n\nlicenses.12 He testified that he was paid $1,000 in cash per month from each of\n\nhis taxicab licenses, but almost all of his profits went toward paying the taxicabs'\n\nexpenses. He does not cite any documentary evidence showing that he was in\n\nfact paid $1,000 per month per taxicab, or evidence supporting his argument that\n\nessentially all of these profits went toward maintaining the taxicabs. In fact, he\n\ntestified that he did not keep a ledger or other record of the money he received.\n\nThe trial court's finding that Kassahun did not document his income from the\n\ntaxicab licenses was supported by substantial evidence.\n\n       g. Parties' Total Monthly Expenditures\n\n       Kassahun argues that the trial court's finding that the parties' total monthly\n\nexpenditures were $8,700 was not supported by substantial evidence. Kassahun\n\nalleges that the trial court did not sufficiently explain which expenses it considered\n\nor what duplications it eliminated. The trial court stated that it \"looked at the\n\nexpenditures that the parties submitted in these financial declarations under\n\n\n\n\n12As discussed above, Kassahun only reported income for one of his taxicab licenses on\nhis tax returns. At trial, he testified that he received $1,000 in cash per month from each\nof his two taxicabs. The total listed income of $23,752 appears to possibly include the\nalleged income from both taxicabs. Neither party addresses this discrepancy in depth.\n                                            12\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/13\n\n\npenalty of perjury and eliminated duplications. The Court added up the expenses,\n\nminus Mr. Kassahun's housing and utilities, and reached a figure of about\n\n$8,700.\"13 Each party's financial declaration lists monthly expense information.\n\nThe trial court set forth its methodology for reaching its final figure. The record\n\ncontains substantial evidence showing the basis for the trial court's decision.\n\n         h. Kassahun Saving Ability\n\n         Kassahun argues that the trial court's finding that Kassahun was able to\n\nsave approximately $1,500 per month during the parties' marriage was not\n\nsupported by substantial evidence. The parties were married in January 1996. In\n\nre Ashaqari, No. 71295-1-1, slip op. at 2. In 2011, Kassahun withdrew $187,000\n\nfrom the parties' joint bank account. In re Ashagari, No. 71295-1-1, slip op. at 2.\n\nThe trial court's finding that this figure represented savings the parties had accrued\n\nover 10 years was supported by substantial evidence in the record.\n\n         i. Credibility of Witnesses\n\n         Kassahun assigns error to the trial court's finding that Kessler, Kassahun's\n\nexpert, was not credible because he did not have access to sufficient records and\n\ndid not provide a reliable estimate of the amount of cash available to Kassahun.\n\nKessler's testimony demonstrates that the trial court had reason to question\n\nKessler's credibility. Kessler stated that he based his valuation on the wages\n\nKassahun paid himself from the Market, Kassahun's income from the taxicab\n\nlicenses, income from his shareholder loan, and normalization for Kassahun's use\n\nof business funds for personal expenses. But Kessler also testified that he did not\n\n\n13   CP at 396.\n                                          13\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/14\n\n\nreview Kassahun's personal bank statements extensively, and did not review\n\nKassahun's credit card statements at all. The court's finding that Kessler was not\n\ncredible is supported by substantial evidence in the record.\n\n       Kassahun also assigns error to the trial court's finding that Kassahun was\n\nnot credible when he testified he was forced to borrow money for his maintenance\n\nand child support obligations because he used the money for personal expenses\n\nand attorney fees. This court does not review credibility determinations.\n\n       Calculation of Kassahun's Gross Monthly Income\n\n       Kassahun argues that this court should vacate the trial court's maintenance\n\nand child support orders. He contends that the trial court abused its discretion by\n\ncalculating his income based on the expenditures alleged in the parties' financial\n\ndeclarations. Because courts may look to financial declarations to calculate the\n\ngross income of parties and the trial court's underlying findings of fact were\n\nsupported by substantial evidence, we disagree.\n\n       When the court determines the child support obligation of each parent, it\n\nshould consider lap income and resources of each parent's household.\" RCW\n\n26.19.071(1). When calculating a parent's gross monthly income, the court\n\nincludes income from many different sources, including salaries, wages, income\n\nfrom second jobs, maintenance actually received, and income from self-\n\nemployment or proprietorship of a business. RCW 26.19.071(3).\n\n       Offered income and deductions must be verified by tax returns for the past\n\ntwo years or current paystubs, and \"[o]ther sufficient verification\" is required to\n\n\n\n\n                                        14\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/15\n\n\nverify \"income and deductions which do not appear on tax returns or paystubs.\"\n\nRCW 26.19.071(2).\n\n      \"RCW 26.19.071(1) does not require that the court make a precise\n\ndetermination of income.

Because courts\n\nmay look to the parties' financial declarations when calculating income, we\n\ndisagree.\n\n       A trial court may consider the financial declarations submitted by parties\n\nthroughout dissolution proceedings. See, e.g., In re Marriage of Zacapu, 192 Wn.\n\nApp. 700, 709, 368 P.3d 242(2016)(trial court did not abuse its discretion when it\n\nconsidered the parties' financial declarations to calculate a deviation from the\n\nobligor's standard calculation); In re Marriage of Avvad, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash.

These cases\n\ndemonstrate that Washington trial courts have frequently looked to the financial\n\ndeclarations submitted by the parties during a dissolution proceeding.\n\n       Here, the trial court found that the parties' monthly expenses totaled\n\napproximately $8,700 by adding up the expenses in their financial declarations and\n\nsubtracting Kassahun's housing and utilities. It used this value and the parties'\n\nsaving ability to reach a net monthly income, adjusted for taxes, and found that\n\nKassahun's gross monthly income was $12,750. The trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion when it used the financial declarations of the parties to calculate\n\nKassahun's income for purposes of determining its final order of child support.\n\n       Kassahun cites In re Marriage of Trichak to argue that this court has\n\nrejected the use of financial declarations to verify income, and instead requires the\n\nuse of tax returns. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash.

Kassahun\n\nmisconstrues the holding of Trichak. There, Mr. Trichak contended that the trial\n\ncourt erred in using the $1,255 figure listed on Ms. Trichak's support schedule\n\nworksheet as her gross monthly income instead of the $2,000 figure provided on\n\nher financial affidavit. 72 Wn. App. at 23. The Court of Appeals disagreed,\n\nbecause the value listed on the financial affidavit was marked as an estimate and\n\n\n\n\n                                         16\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/17\n\n\nthe support schedule figure was supported by Ms. Trichak's reliable tax returns.\n\nTrichak, 72 Wn. App. at 26-27.\n\n       Kassahun next argues that the expenditures listed in the financial\n\ndeclarations of the parties are inherently less reliable than the incomes listed in the\n\nfinancial declarations. He does not cite to legal authority in support of this\n\nargument. He has not otherwise shown that the use of the expenditures listed in\n\nfinancial declarations is in and of itself an abuse of discretion by the trial court.\n\n       Kassahun argues that the only calculation of income that the record\n\nsupports is approximately $6,500, consisting of the $3,000 in W-2 wages from the\n\nMarket, $2,000 per month in income from the taxicab licenses, and $1,500 per\n\nmonth of business expenses to cover personal expenses listed in his financial\n\ndeclaration. He also relies on his testimony that he was compelled to borrow\n\n$50,000 to meet his child support and maintenance obligations in 2012.\n\n       The figures Kassahun offered necessarily rely on the accuracy of his tax\n\nreturns and the credibility of his testimony at trial. But as discussed above, the trial\n\ncourt's findings that Kassahun's documents and testimony were unreliable were\n\nsupported by substantial evidence. Further, Kassahun does not challenge the trial\n\ncourt's finding that Kassahun's claims that he was destitute and was forced to\n\nborrow money to meet his obligations were not credible because he used the funds\n\nfor personal expenses and attorney fees. Therefore, it was within the trial court's\n\ndiscretion to look to the sworn financial declarations of the parties, rather than the\n\n\n\n\n                                           17\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/18\n\n\nfinancial documents and testimony submitted by Kassahun, to calculate\n\nKassahun's gross monthly income.14\n\n       Use of Saving Ability to Calculate Kassahun's Gross Monthly Income\n\n       Kassahun argues that the trial court erred when it considered his ability to\n\nsave during the parties' marriage in its calculation of his gross monthly income.\n\nSpecifically, he argues that there was no evidence that he had any ability to save\n\nmoney at the time the trial court entered its order of child support in November\n\n2013. Because he has not offered persuasive legal authority or citations to the\n\nrecord in support of this argument, we disagree.\n\n       Kassahun cites In re Marriage of Scanlon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash.

App.</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 916 P.2d 968(1996). The\n\nScanlon court involved a former husband's request for downward modification of\n\nhis child support obligation, as well as reallocation of visitation-related travel\n\nexpenses and federal income tax credits. 109 Wn. App. at 171. The Payne court\n\nheld that past earnings were not a relevant measure of gross monthly income\n\nwhere a party's income had changed. 82 Wn. App. at 152.\n\n       Neither case supports Kassahun's position. Scanlon involved a motion to\n\nmodify an existing child support obligation in light of an alleged reduction in\n\nincome. Similarly, Payne, involved a reduction in a party's income that rendered\n\npast earnings irrelevant. Here, the record does not show that Kassahun's income\n\n\n\n\n14 The trial court provided an alternate method of calculating Kassahun's gross monthly\nincome based on Kassahun's monthly expenditures. Because the trial court did not abuse\nits discretion when it looked to the parties' financial declarations to calculate Kassahun's\ngross monthly income, we need not review its alternate calculation method.\n                                            18\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/19\n\n\nor ability to save changed from the time the parties were married until the trial court\n\nentered its order of child support.\n\n       Kassahun also argues that his being forced to take out a loan to meet his\n\nsupport obligations demonstrates that he had no ability to save at the time the trial\n\ncourt entered its order of child support. But the trial court found that Kassahun's\n\nclaim that he was forced to borrow money was not credible, a finding that\n\nKassahun does not challenge on appeal. Moreover, Kassahun leased a new\n\nMercedes in February 2013 despite his claims of poverty beginning in October\n\n2012. Kassahun's citation to the purported loan does not support his claim that\n\nhis ability to save had changed.\n\n        In sum, Kassahun has not demonstrated that his income or ability to save\n\nchanged significantly in the time between the parties' filing of financial documents\n\nand the trial court's final order.\n\n        Total Gross Monthly Income\n\n       Kassahun assigns error to the trial court's finding that his gross monthly\n\nincome was $12,750. Because the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it\n\nlooked to the parties' financial declarations to calculate Kassahun's gross monthly\n\nincome and its underlying findings of fact were supported by substantial evidence,\n\nwe find no error.15\n\n\n15 Ashagari attached the trial court's \"Final Order and Findings on Petition to Modify Child\nSupport and Maintenance Order, Corrected to add debtor and creditor names to Â¶1\" to\nher appellate brief.

RCW 26.19.071(2).\n\n       Among his general challenges to Ashagari's claimed expenses as lacking\n\nverification, Kassahun argues that she erroneously claimed an expense for\n\ninstallment payments for the home equity loan. Kassahun argues that the Market\n\nitself made these payments, not Ashagari.\n\n       This court will not disturb a trial court's credibility determinations.

The Chase home\n\nequity statements submitted by Ashagari shows that the home equity loan listed\n\nboth her and Kassahun, and installment payments of $730.28 were made in\n\nOctober 2011 and April 2012. The trial court's findings show that it did not find\n\nKassahun's self-serving and unsupported testimony credible, and we will not\n\ndisturb that determination on appeal.\n\n                                  Maintenance Award\n\n       Kassahun argues that the trial court abused its discretion because its\n\nmaintenance award did not show that it had fairly considered the relevant statutory\n\nfactors. Because the trial court referred to the statutory factors in its initial findings\n\n\n\n\n                                           21\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/22\n\n\nand reiterated that it found that Kassahun could meet his obligations on remand,\n\nwe disagree.\n\n       In a dissolution proceeding, the court may grant a maintenance award for\n\neither spouse or domestic partner. RCW 26.09.090(1). The court may enter a\n\nmaintenance order for an amount and length of time the court deems just, without\n\nregard to misconduct. RCW 26.09.090(1). The statute includes a nonexclusive\n\nlist of factors a court may consider, including the financial resources of the party\n\nseeking maintenance, the standard of living established during the marriage, and\n\nthe ability of the obligor spouse to pay maintenance while meeting his or her own\n\nneeds. RCW 26.09.090(1)(a)-(f).\n\n       An award of maintenance is within the trial court's discretion.

App.</span> <span class=\"page\">116</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 123, 853 P.2d 462(1993). A trial court abuses its\n\ndiscretion if its award of spousal maintenance does not evidence a fair\n\nconsideration of the statutory factors used in determining its award. Spreen v.\n\nSpreen, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 349, 28 P.3d 769(2001).\n\n       In its initial findings, the trial court explicitly referred to the factors listed in\n\nRCW 26.09.090. It found that Kassahun had significant earning capacity and\n\nfinancial resources, including those he did not disclose. It also considered that\n\nAshagari had few job skills, and found that maintenance was necessary to allow\n\nher to attend school and obtain additional training. On remand, the trial court\n\nstated that its previous maintenance award would remain unchanged. The trial\n\ncourt properly considered the factors contained in RCW 26.09.090, and thus did\n\nnot abuse its discretion.\n\n\n                                            22\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/23\n\n\n        Kassahun argues that the trial court abused its discretion by finding that he\n\nhad an earning capacity and financial resources that exceeded what he claimed.\n\nAs discussed above, the trial court's findings that Kassahun did not report all of his\n\nincome on his tax returns, used business funds for personal expenses, and was\n\nnot credible when testifying to his financial status were supported by substantial\n\nevidence. He does not offer new arguments for why the trial court's finding was\n\nnot supported by substantial evidence.\n\n       Kassahun also argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it found\n\nthat he could pay $5,000 per month in maintenance while still meeting his financial\n\nobligations.    He does not offer citation to the record or further argument\n\nestablishing that he is unable to pay. This is insufficient to show that the trial court\n\nabused its discretion.\n\n                                     Trial Court Bias\n\n       Kassahun argues that the trial court's rulings were the result of bias against\n\nhim or based on a consideration of his fault or misconduct.17 Because Kassahun\n\nhas not offered any evidence or supporting authority for his arguments, we\n\nconclude that Kassahun has not shown that the trial court was biased against him.\n\n       A court may not consider a party's misconduct when determining a\n\nmaintenance award. RCW 26.09.090(1); In re Marriage of Muhammad,153 Wn.2d\n\n795, 803-04, 108 P.3d 779(2005).\n\n\n17In his reply brief, Kassahun cites to the court's finding that he engaged in marital\nmisconduct. In the trial court's original findings in support of its parenting plan, the court\nnoted that Kassahun's history of domestic violence necessitated restrictions under RCW\n26.09.191. The trial court's decision regarding the parenting plan is not at issue in this\nappeal, and there is nothing to indicate that this finding impacted its decisions regarding\nKassahun's gross monthly income.\n                                             23\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/24\n\n\n       We presume that a trial judge properly discharged her official duties without\n\nbias or prejudice.

He first argues that the trial\n\ncourt's methods of calculating his income on remand were \"patently flawed\" and\n\nconstituted an abuse of discretion because the trial court decreased its calculation\n\nof his gross monthly income but changed the way it calculated his taxes so that his\n\nnet monthly income increased by $1,000.18 Kassahun does not cite to legal\n\nauthority in support of this argument. He has also not demonstrated that the trial\n\ncourt is restricted to its original method of calculating his gross monthly income on\n\nremand. This is insufficient to overcome the presumption that the trial court did\n\nnot act with bias or prejudice towards Kassahun.\n\n       Kassahun next argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it used\n\nthe current ages of the children when it entered its order of child support on remand\n\nin November 2013, rather than the ages of the children when the original order of\n\nchild support was entered.19 Again, he does not cite to legal authority in support\n\n\n\n\n18 Br. of Appellant at 45-46.\n18 In his reply brief, Kassahun argues for the first time that the trial court erroneously\ndivided the parties' property in favor of Ashagari. RCW 26.09.080. We decline to reach\nthis issue. RAP 10.3(c).\n                                           24\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/25\n\n\nof his argument that this constituted an abuse of discretion. He has not shown that\n\nthe trial court had to use the children's ages when it entered its original order as\n\nopposed to its new order created on remand. This is insufficient to overcome the\n\npresumption that the trial court did not act with bias or prejudice towards Kassahun.\n\n       Kassahun's unsupported allegations of bias or improper consideration of\n\nmisconduct or fault are insufficient to show that the trial court abused its discretion\n\nwhen it recalculated his gross monthly income or when it used the current ages of\n\nthe children when constructing its award of child support on remand.\n\n                           Imputation of Income to Ashaqari\n\n       Kassahun argues for the first time on appeal that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by declining to impute income to Ashagari. \"The appellate court may\n\nrefuse to review any claim of error which was not raised in the trial court.\" RAP\n\n2.5(a). Kassahun did not challenge the trial court's refusal to impute income to\n\nAshagari in his first appeal, and the case was remanded for the specific purpose\n\nof the trial court making specific findings to support its determination of Kassahun's\n\nincome. In re Ashagari, No. 71295-1-1, slip op. at 14. Because Kassahun raises\n\nthis argument for the first time in his second appeal in the case, we decline to reach\n\nthe merits of the issue.\n\n                              Attorney Fees and Costs\n\n       Ashagari requests that this court order Kassahun to pay her reasonable\n\nattorney fees and costs.\n\n       In a dissolution proceeding, the court may order a party to pay the\n\nreasonable attorney fees and costs of the other party after considering the financial\n\n\n                                          25\n\fNo. 75343-6-1/26\n\n\nresources of both parties.
