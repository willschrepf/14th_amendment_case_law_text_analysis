Hilbig, Justice\n\nDelivered and Filed: March 30, 2011\n\nREVERSED AND RENDERED; REMANDED\n\n                                         BACKGROUND\n\n           On April 4, 2004, David and Guadalupe Cantu’s house was damaged in a hailstorm. The\n\nCantus’ house was insured under a policy with Southland Lloyds Insurance Co. Southland sent\n\nan independent adjustor, Bobby Arnold, to the Cantus’ home to inspect the damage on April 13,\n\n2004. On April 27, 2004, Southland mailed to the Cantus a copy of Arnold’s repair estimate and\n\na letter advising them that a claim check in the amount of $2,036.85 would be sent to their\n\f                                                                                      04-09-00705-CV\n\n\ninsurance agent within seven working days. On April 29, 2004, the check was sent to the\n\nCantus’ insurance agent at SAS-Lowery Insurance Agency. The Cantus cashed the check, but\n\ndid not otherwise respond to Southland regarding the Arnold estimate. However, in June 2004,\n\nthe Cantus notified Southland by letter that they had employed Joe Ortiz as a “building\n\nconsultant” to investigate the extent of loss to their home. In the letter, the Cantus authorized\n\nOrtiz and/or Marcus Stites to act on their behalf. However, because Ortiz never returned Mr.\n\nCantu’s telephone calls, the Cantus later decided to hire an attorney.          On July 10, 2004,\n\nSouthland received an estimate prepared by Stites for Joatmon Loss Services in the amount of\n\n$6,855.66. Southland, unaware that the Cantus were dissatisfied with Ortiz and had hired an\n\nattorney, asked Arnold to contact Stites to determine why the estimate was so high. Southland\n\nnever received a response from Joatmon or Stites. In June 2006, Bob Barton of Barton Claim\n\nService inspected the Cantus’ house at their request. He prepared a report that concluded most\n\nof the interior and exterior surfaces of the house had to be replaced for a total of $65,000.\n\n       The Cantus eventually sued Southland on claims for breach of contract and bad faith.\n\nSouthland generally denied and also pled accord and satisfaction on the grounds that it had paid\n\n$2,036.85 in satisfaction of the “covered losses” under the policy. A jury found in favor of the\n\nCantus. Southland now appeals.\n\n                                       CANTUS’ EXPERT\n\n       At trial, Bob Barton did not testify. Instead, Art Boutin, who adopted Barton’s estimate,\n\ntestified on the Cantus’ behalf regarding the extent of damage to their house caused by the\n\nhailstorm. In its first issue, Southland raises several complaints regarding Boutin’s testimony.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\f                                                                                           04-09-00705-CV\n\n\n1.         Relevance and Reliability\n\n           Under the policy, Southland’s liability was limited to the lesser of the following: (1) the\n\nactual cash value at the time of loss determined with proper deduction for depreciation; (2) the\n\ncost to repair or replace the damaged property with material of like kind and quality, with proper\n\ndeduction for depreciation; or (3) the specified limit of liability of the policy. According to\n\nSouthland, Boutin’s opinion that the hailstorm caused more than $65,000 in damage was not\n\nrelevant because (1) he did not review the policy; (2) he did not intend to opine on whether the\n\ndamage was covered by the terms of the policy; (3) he made no effort to determine whether any\n\nof the losses were “covered losses” under the policy; (4) his estimate was not economically\n\nfeasible because the Cantus’ house was valued at only $40,000; 1 and (5) he did not verify\n\nwhether the items listed as damages in Barton’s report were actually damaged. Thus, Southland\n\nconcludes, Boutin’s opinion is not relevant because he ignored what Southland characterizes as\n\nthe “essential measure of damages in this case,” which is “actual cash value [of the cost of\n\nrepairs at the time of the loss] less depreciation.” Southland also asserts Boutin’s opinion is\n\nunreliable because it was speculative and there is too wide an analytical gap between his\n\ntestimony and the Barton report on which he relied.\n\n           An expert’s testimony is admissible under Texas Rule of Evidence 702 if the expert is\n\nqualified, 2 and the expert’s opinion is relevant to the issues in the case and based upon a reliable\n\nfoundation. TEX. R. EVID. 702; Gammill v. Jack Williams Chevrolet, Inc., 972 S.W.2d 713, 720\n\n(Tex. 1998); E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Robinson, 923 S.W.2d 549, 556 (Tex. 1995).\n\nRule 702’s reliability requirement focuses on the principles, research, and methodology\n\n\n1\n This “value” is taken from a section entitled “Coverages” contained in Southland’s “Homeowners’/Fire Quick\nQuote By Fax.”\n2\n    Southland does not challenge Boutin’s qualifications.\n\n                                                            -3-\n\f                                                                                     04-09-00705-CV\n\n\nunderlying an expert’s conclusions. Exxon Pipeline Co. v. Zwahr, 88 S.W.3d 623, 629 (Tex.\n\n2002). Under this requirement, expert testimony is unreliable if it is not grounded in the methods\n\nand procedures of science and is no more than subjective belief or unsupported speculation.\n\nRobinson, 923 S.W.2d at 557. Expert testimony is also unreliable if there is too great an\n\nanalytical gap between the data the expert relies upon and the opinion offered. Gammill, 972\n\nS.W.2d at 727. In applying this reliability standard, however, the trial court does not decide\n\nwhether the expert’s conclusions are correct; rather, the trial court determines whether the\n\nanalysis used to reach those conclusions is reliable. Id. at 728. Although the trial court serves as\n\nan evidentiary gatekeeper by screening out irrelevant and unreliable expert evidence, it has broad\n\ndiscretion to determine the admissibility of evidence. Zwahr, 88 S.W.3d at 629. Accordingly,\n\nwe review the trial court’s decision to admit Boutin’s testimony for an abuse of discretion. See\n\nGammill, 972 S.W.2d at 718-19; Robinson, 923 S.W.2d at 558.\n\n       Boutin, an independent insurance adjuster, testified he adopted Barton’s report as his\n\nestimate of the cost to repair the damage to the Cantus’ home that was caused by the hailstorm.\n\nHe stated the manner in which the Barton report was prepared was no different from any\n\nestimate he would have prepared for an insurance company. Boutin said that if he had been\n\nasked by the Cantus to prepare the report, his investigation would have been the same as\n\nBarton’s.   Boutin explained that the software used to prepare the Barton report is called\n\nExactimate and is accepted by most insurance companies. Exactimate has a large database for\n\nmaterials and labor for specific geographic areas, and he has used Exactimate for seven years.\n\nBoutin spoke with Mr. Cantu, who provided him with an overview of the damage sustained\n\nduring the storm. Boutin spent approximately ninety minutes at the house, and with the Barton\n\nreport in hand, he went inside the house, room-by-room, to take measurements. He also took\n\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\f                                                                                    04-09-00705-CV\n\n\nmeasurements outside, including on the roof. He said he independently verified the damage to\n\nthe house as represented in the Barton report. He saw no damage to the house other than the\n\ndamage caused by the hailstorm. He was aware the Cantus had already made some exterior\n\nrepairs to the house, but he did not know if any interior repairs had been made.\n\n       Barton prepared his report in June 2006, and Boutin went to the Cantu home for the first\n\ntime in January 2009. Boutin said his ability to adopt Barton’s estimate or his ability to prepare\n\nhis own report would not have been affected by his not going to the house until 2009. When\n\nasked why, he responded that “In the past I’ve been asked to adopt other estimates with\n\ninsurance companies doing inspection[s], and it’s much the same process. You go out and do the\n\nmeasurements and it was virtually the same process.” When asked to explain a repair estimate of\n\n$65,000 on a home insured for only $42,000, Boutin stated that the amount of work that must be\n\ndone to repair damage to the house has nothing to do with the amount for which the house is\n\ninsured.   Boutin said one of the reasons this happens is because the cost of any required\n\ndemolition work, such as removal of debris, may account for up to fifty percent of the value of\n\nthe repair work. The Barton report calls for replacing the fascia boards, siding, and insulation on\n\nthe outside of the house, as well as replacing everything related to the roof. Although Mr. Cantu\n\nsaid that hail damaged only two sides of the house, Boutin agreed with Barton that all four sides\n\nshould be replaced because “it’s an industry standard that if 50 percent or more is damaged, you\n\nreplace all of the siding” to ensure the siding matched on all four sides of the house, and he\n\nfollowed this rule when he worked for insurance companies. He said the same rule applied to\n\nroof damage. When asked why he would estimate repair work to the outside of the house even\n\nthough Mr. Cantu had already done some of the exterior repairs, Boutin replied that an estimate\n\nis based on an assumption that no repair work has been done.\n\n\n\n                                               -5-\n\f                                                                                      04-09-00705-CV\n\n\n       As to the interior of the house, the report calls for extensive repair work in almost every\n\nroom throughout the house—such as replacing ceiling insulation, removing kitchen cabinets,\n\nreplacing dry wall, and replacing and removing electric outlets—because all those areas were\n\ndamaged by the storm. When asked how he knew these areas had been damaged by the storm,\n\nBoutin replied, “It’s consistent with damage that I’ve seen in the past.” He said he saw the\n\ninterior damage when he inspected the Cantus’ house. He also said the fifty percent rule did not\n\nnecessarily apply to interior work. When asked why all the interior work was needed, Boutin\n\nstated, “Because when the ceilings are damaged, to take the ceiling down, you are going to\n\ndamage the walls as you remove them.” From his inspection, he knew there would be ceiling\n\ndamage from roof leaks. As to why all the kitchen cabinets had to be replaced when there was\n\nno evidence water had gotten into the cabinets, Boutin explained that in the process of removing\n\nthe cabinets to replace drywall, they could be damaged.\n\n       Boutin said he had no problem with the insurance company applying a fifty percent\n\ndepreciation on the material to replace the Cantus’ roof because fifty percent is an industry\n\nstandard. He explained that the amount of depreciation on a roof is more than on materials for\n\nother parts of the house, such as siding, because a roof does not last as long. However, he\n\nbelieved the amount Southland paid to the Cantus would replace only part of the roof. Although\n\nthe Arnold estimate prepared for Southland applied depreciation to both labor and materials,\n\nBoutin said that in the thousands of times he has applied depreciation, he has never taken\n\ndepreciation on labor because labor is not a “material” that loses value over time.\n\n       On cross-examination, Boutin admitted he had not seen the Southland insurance policy\n\nissued to the Cantus. However, Boutin said he did not intend to opine on whether the damages\n\nwere covered by the terms of the policy; instead, he intended to opine about the cost to repair the\n\n\n\n                                                -6-\n\f                                                                                   04-09-00705-CV\n\n\ndamage caused by the hailstorm. As to Barton’s report, Boutin said he never spoke to Barton\n\nabout the report. Boutin acknowledged that the storm damage occurred in 2004, but Barton’s\n\nreport was not prepared until 2006. Boutin was not aware of anyone adjusting the Exactimate\n\n2006 cost estimate to reflect 2004 numbers. However, he did not believe there was a significant\n\ndifference in cost between 2004 and 2006. The estimate called for the existing roof to be\n\nreplaced with a twenty-five-year composition shingle roof, but Boutin did not know whether the\n\noriginal roof had twenty-year or twenty-five-year shingles. He conceded that replacing a twenty-\n\nyear shingle roof with a twenty-five-year shingle roof would place the owner in a better position\n\nthan he was in before the storm. He did not know what portion of the roof or roof decking\n\nneeded to be replaced. He did not know the pre-storm quality of the fascia and whether it was\n\nthe same as the quality of fascia called for in the report. He did not know the size of the air\n\nconditioner before the storm, although the Barton report included a large unit. The report called\n\nfor insulation in the walls, although Boutin did not know if the walls were insulated prior to the\n\nstorm. And if there was pre-existing insulation, he did not know whether it had gotten wet and,\n\ntherefore, needed to be replaced. However, he said he did not need to check the insulation\n\nbecause he knew the dry wall and almost the entire ceiling throughout the house were wet and,\n\ntherefore, the insulation was wet. On redirect, Boutin stated he saw water damage from the\n\nhailstorm to the ceiling, walls, and floor of the house.\n\n       Boutin was called as an expert to opine only on the estimated cost to repair any damage\n\nto the Cantus’ home caused by the hailstorm. For that purpose, we conclude he was required\n\nonly to determine what damage was attributable to hail and it was not necessary for him to (1)\n\nreview the policy; (2) opine on whether the damage was covered by the terms of the policy; or\n\n(3) determine whether any of the losses were “covered losses” under the policy. We disagree\n\n\n\n                                                 -7-\n\f                                                                                    04-09-00705-CV\n\n\nwith Southland’s argument that his estimate was not economically feasible because the Cantus’\n\nhouse was valued at only $40,000, because Boutin adequately explained that the amount of work\n\nthat must be done to repair a house has nothing to do with the amount of insurance available to\n\npay for those repairs. Finally, we conclude Southland’s argument that Boutin did not verify\n\nwhether the items listed as damages in Barton’s report were actually damaged goes to the weight\n\nof the evidence and not its relevance or reliability.\n\n2.     “Parroting” the Opinion of Another Expert\n\n       As an expert, Boutin was permitted to testify as to relevant matters about which he had\n\npersonal knowledge, TEX. R. EVID. 402, 602, 703, and to state his opinion based upon his\n\npersonal knowledge of the facts and the evidence, TEX. R. EVID. 703.             Boutin was also\n\nauthorized to rely on facts or data contained in the Barton report in forming his own opinion as to\n\nthe evidence examined, regardless of the admissibility of such facts or data.\n\n       On appeal, Southland argues Boutin’s testimony lacked relevance and reliability because\n\nhe merely adopted Bob Barton’s report. Southland argues that federal rules of evidence similar\n\nto Texas Rule of Evidence 703 “do not extend so far as to allow experts to simply parrot or recite\n\nthe opinions of other experts, as Boutin did here.” Southland relies on several federal cases for\n\nthe proposition that “experts are permitted to rely on opinions of other experts to the extent that\n\nthey are of the type that would be reasonably relied upon by other experts in the field.” See\n\nMalletier v. Dooney & Bourke, Inc., 525 F. Supp. 2d 558, 664 (S.D.N.Y. 2007). “But in doing\n\nso, the expert witness must in the end be giving his own opinion. He cannot simply be a conduit\n\nfor the opinion of an unproduced expert.” Id.\n\n       In Malletier, an expert, Weston Anson, based his conclusion on a regression analysis\n\nconducted on Louis Vuitton sales data. Id. But Anson did not conduct the regression analysis\n\n\n\n                                                 -8-\n\f                                                                                                  04-09-00705-CV\n\n\nhimself; instead, it was conducted by Anson’s company’s senior analyst, Fernando Torres, who\n\nwas not produced at trial. The court held that “[w]hile Mr. Torres was probably qualified to\n\nconduct a regression analysis . . . Anson was not presented as and was demonstrably unqualified\n\nto be an expert on statistical analysis.” Id. (emphasis added). At his deposition, Anson testified\n\nthat “in simplistic terms” he knew how to conduct a regression analysis. “But that asserted\n\nability was based on studying statistics in graduate school 30 years earlier, and no good faith\n\nargument can be made that 30 year-old course study is a sufficient qualification to testify as a\n\nstatistician.” Id. Anson admitted he “essentially had nothing to do with the preparation of the\n\nregression analysis” and instead, it was his practice to “turn this over to an economist.” Id. The\n\ncourt concluded “Anson’s occasional use of statistics in his daily life simply does not qualify\n\nhim as an expert on that complex subject.” Id. Therefore, “[b]ecause Anson is not qualified to\n\nconduct or interpret statistical analyses, the regression analysis could only be admissible if\n\nAnson is permitted to give an opinion by relying completely on Torres’s opinion.” Id. The court\n\nheld that a “‘scientist, however well credentialed he may be, is not permitted to be the\n\nmouthpiece of a scientist in a different specialty.’” Id. at 665 (quoting Dura Auto. Sys. v. CTS\n\nCorp., 285 F.3d 609, 614 (7th Cir. 2002)). “In the words of the Dura court, Torres exercised\n\n‘independent judgment’ that was ‘beyond [Anson’s] ken.’” Id. at 665-66 (quoting Dura, 285\n\nF.3d at 613). 3 “With respect to the regression analysis, Anson was not an expert but rather a\n\n\n\n\n3\n  The Dura court determined that the assistants of the challenged expert “did not merely collect data for him to\nmassage or apply concededly appropriate techniques in a concededly appropriate manner, or otherwise perform\nroutine procedures, and that he himself lacks the necessary expertise to determine whether the techniques were\nappropriately chosen and applied.” 285 F.3d at 615 (emphasis added). In this case there were two “crucial issues”:\n“the map of the capture zone and whether, if CTS’s plant was within it, how much if any of the contamination of the\nwell field was due to the groundwater running beneath that plant.” Id. The court concluded the expert “was not\ncompetent to opine on the first issue, and without an expert opinion on that issue Dura could not get to the second\nand so could not prevail.” Id.\n\n\n                                                       -9-\n\f                                                                                    04-09-00705-CV\n\n\n‘mouthpiece.’ Louis Vuitton thus produced the wrong expert to prove the reliability of the\n\nregression analysis.” Id. at 666.\n\n       Southland also relies on Matter of James Wilson Associates, 965 F.2d 160 (7th Cir.\n\n1992), in which evidence of a building’s state of repair was obtained by a consulting engineer\n\nretained by the insurer’s expert witness, an architect who planned to testify about the physical\n\ncondition of the building as reported to him by the consulting engineer. The court first noted that\n\nan expert is “permitted to testify to an opinion formed on the basis of information that is handed\n\nto rather than developed by him—information of which he lacks first-hand knowledge and which\n\nmight not be admissible in evidence no matter by whom presented.” Id. at 172. “But the judge\n\nmust make sure that the expert isn’t being used as a vehicle for circumventing the rules of\n\nevidence.” Id. at 173. “The fact that inadmissible evidence is the (permissible) premise of the\n\nexpert’s opinion does not make that evidence admissible for other purposes, purposes\n\nindependent of the opinion.” Id. The court stated as follows:\n\n       If for example the expert witness (call him A) bases his opinion in part on a fact\n       (call it X) that the party’s lawyer told him, the lawyer cannot in closing argument\n       tell the jury, “See, we proved X through our expert witness, A.” That was the kind\n       of hand-off attempted in this case. The issue was the state of the building, and the\n       expert who had evaluated that state-the consulting engineer-was the one who\n       should have testified. The architect could use what the engineer told him to offer\n       an opinion within the architect’s domain of expertise, but he could not testify for\n       the purpose of vouching for the truth of what the engineer had told him—of\n       becoming in short the engineer’s spokesman. Why [the insurer] did not call the\n       engineer as a witness is unexplained, but it is improper to use an expert witness as\n       a screen against cross-examination (though the other side could always call him as\n       an adverse witness, and cross-examine him).\n\nId. at 173 (emphasis added).\n\n       Finally, in In re Sulfuric Acid Antitrust Litigation, the court stated “Analysis becomes\n\nmore complicated if the assistants exercise professional judgment that is beyond the expert’s\n\nken.” 446 F. Supp. 2d 910, 916 (N.D. Ill. 2006). “In that context, it must be determined whether\n\n                                               - 10 -\n\f                                                                                    04-09-00705-CV\n\n\nthe disclosed expert is genuinely formulating an opinion based in part on the underlying data or\n\nwhether he is acting as the ‘mouthpiece’ for the non-testifying individual on whose data he is\n\nrelying.” Id. “If the latter, the hearsay rule prohibits the testimony unless the non-testifying\n\nindividual also testifies.” Id.\n\n        We do not believe Boutin was merely “parroting” the Barton opinion.               Barton’s\n\nprofessional judgment was within Boutin’s knowledge—they are both experienced insurance\n\nadjusters and Boutin is familiar with and has used the Exactimate software used by Barton to\n\nprepare his report. Boutin’s qualifications as an insurance adjuster are undisputed. He stated the\n\nmanner in which the Barton estimate was prepared was no different from any estimate he would\n\nhave prepared for an insurance company. Boutin has adjusted approximately forty claims with\n\nBarton, and he said that if he had been asked by the Cantus to prepare the report, his\n\ninvestigation would have been the same as Barton’s.         Boutin spoke with Mr. Cantu, who\n\nprovided him with an overview of the damages sustained during the storm, and he independently\n\ninspected and verified the damage to the house as represented in the Barton report. He saw no\n\ndamage to the house other than the hail damage. Based on this record, we conclude Boutin was\n\n“genuinely formulating an opinion based in part on the underlying data” supplied by Barton.\n\n                                     BAD FAITH CLAIM\n\n        In answer to question number four, the jury found Southland engaged in unfair or\n\ndeceptive acts or practices by (1) refusing to pay a claim without conducting a reasonable\n\ninvestigation of the claim based on all available information; (2) failing to attempt in good faith\n\nto effectuate a prompt, fair, and equitable settlement of a claim when the insurer’s liability has\n\nbecome reasonably clear; and (3) compelling the Cantus to institute a lawsuit to recover amounts\n\ndue under their policy by offering substantially less than the amounts ultimately recovered. In\n\n\n\n                                               - 11 -\n\f                                                                                      04-09-00705-CV\n\n\nanswer to question number seven, the jury found that Southland engaged in such conduct\n\n“knowingly.” In its second and fourth issues, Southland asserts the evidence is legally and\n\nfactually insufficient to support these bad faith findings or that it acted with “actual awareness of\n\nthe falsity, deception, or unfairness of the conduct in question.”\n\n       A breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing may give rise to a cause of action in\n\ntort that is separate from any cause of action for breach of the underlying insurance contract.\n\nTransp. Ins. Co. v. Moriel, 879 S.W.2d 10, 17 (Tex. 1994). “The contract aspect of a coverage\n\ndispute concerns either the factual basis for the claim, the proper legal interpretation of the\n\npolicy, or both.” Id. If the loss is covered, the insurer must pay the claim pursuant to the terms\n\nof the insurance contract. Id. An insurer’s failure to pay a covered claim is ordinarily a breach\n\nof contract that does not alone entitle a plaintiff to mental anguish or exemplary damages. Id.\n\n       “The threshold of bad faith is reached when a breach of contract is accompanied by an\n\nindependent tort.” Id. In Arnold v. National County Mutual Fire Ins., the Texas Supreme Court\n\naddressed whether insurers have a common law duty to deal fairly and in good faith with their\n\ninsureds. 725 S.W.2d 165, 167 (Tex. 1987). Holding that such a duty does exist, the Arnold\n\nCourt held that a “cause of action for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing is stated\n\nwhen it is alleged that there is no reasonable basis for denial of a claim or delay in payment or a\n\nfailure on the part of the insurer to determine whether there is any reasonable basis for the denial\n\nor delay.” Id.\n\n       Almost ten years later, the Texas Supreme Court clarified the standard for imposing\n\nliability for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing in Universe Life Ins. Co. v. Giles,\n\n950 S.W.2d 48, 54 (Tex. 1997) (stating that “‘no reasonable basis’ element of tort has injected\n\nneedless complexity into no-evidence review of bad faith claims”). Noting that the Texas\n\n\n\n                                                - 12 -\n\f                                                                                       04-09-00705-CV\n\n\nInsurance Code defined unfair insurance settlement practices to include “‘failing to attempt in\n\ngood faith to effectuate a prompt, fair, and equitable settlement of a claim with respect to which\n\nthe insurer’s liability has become reasonably clear . . . ,’” the Court concluded this standard\n\nwould “prove workable in” common law bad faith claims. Id. at 55-56 (quoting predecessor to\n\nTEX. INS. CODE ANN. § 541.060(a)(2)(A) (West 2009)). According to the Giles Court, the\n\n“‘reasonably clear’ standard recasts the liability standard in positive terms, rather than the current\n\nnegative formulation. Under this standard, an insurer will be liable if the insurer knew or should\n\nhave known that it was reasonably clear that the claim was covered.” Id. at 56. The Giles Court\n\nalso noted that an insurer cannot escape liability merely by failing to investigate a claim so that it\n\ncan contend liability was never reasonably clear. Id. at n.5. Instead, the Court reaffirmed that an\n\ninsurance company may also breach its duty of good faith and fair dealing by failing to\n\nreasonably investigate a claim. Id. Whether an insurer acted in bad faith because it failed to\n\nattempt in good faith to effectuate a prompt, fair, and equitable settlement of a claim after its\n\nliability became reasonably clear is a question for the factfinder. Id. at 56.\n\n       In this case, the trial court submitted the case under the “reasonably clear” standard by\n\nasking whether Southland engaged in unfair or deceptive acts or practices by failing to attempt in\n\ngood faith to effectuate a prompt, fair, and equitable settlement of a claim when the insurer’s\n\nliability had become reasonably clear. The trial court also submitted the case under the standard\n\nset forth in the Insurance Code by asking whether Southland (1) refused to pay a claim without\n\nconducting a reasonable investigation of the claim based on all available information, or (2)\n\ncompelled the Cantus to institute a lawsuit to recover amounts due under their policy by\n\noffering substantially less than the amounts ultimately recovered.           TEX. INS. CODE ANN.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 13 -\n\f                                                                                      04-09-00705-CV\n\n\n§§ 541.060(a)(7), 542.003(b)(5) (West 2009). The jury answered affirmatively to each question;\n\ntherefore, we consider the sufficiency of the evidence in support of each finding.\n\n       In reviewing the evidence, we must distinguish between the evidence supporting the\n\ncontract issue and the tort issue. The issue of bad faith does not focus on whether the claim was\n\nvalid. Lyons v. Millers Cas. Ins. Co., 866 S.W.2d 597, 601 (Tex. 1993). “The evidence must\n\nrelate to the tort issue of [whether the insurer’s liability had become reasonably clear], not just to\n\nthe contract issue of coverage.” Id. at 600. “This focus on the evidence and its relation to the\n\nelements of bad faith is necessary to maintain the distinction between a contract claim on the\n\npolicy, and a claim of bad faith delay or denial of that claim, which arises from the tort duty . . .\n\nimposed on insurers . . . . ” Id. Courts and juries do not weigh the conflicting evidence that was\n\nbefore the insurer; rather, they decide whether evidence existed to justify denial of the claim.\n\nState Farm Lloyds, Inc. v. Polasek, 847 S.W.2d 279, 285 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1992, writ\n\ndenied).   In other words, the issue under a no-evidence review is whether there is “some\n\nevidence” that the insurer’s liability had become reasonably clear. See id. at 284-85.\n\n       Evidence that shows only a bona fide coverage dispute does not, standing alone,\n\ndemonstrate bad faith. State Farm Lloyds v. Nicolau, 951 S.W.2d 444, 448 (Tex. 1997); Moriel,\n\n879 S.W.2d at 17. “Nor is bad faith established if the evidence shows the insurer was merely\n\nincorrect about the factual basis for its denial of the claim, or about the proper construction of the\n\npolicy.” Moriel, 879 S.W.2d at 18. “A simple disagreement among experts about whether the\n\ncause of the loss is one covered by the policy will not support a judgment for bad faith.” Id. On\n\nthe other hand, the mere fact that an insurer relies upon an expert’s report to deny a claim does\n\nnot automatically foreclose bad faith recovery as a matter of law. Nicolau, 951 S.W.2d at 448.\n\nInstead, an insurer’s reliance on an expert’s report, standing alone, will not necessarily shield the\n\n\n\n                                                - 14 -\n\f                                                                                    04-09-00705-CV\n\n\ncarrier if there is evidence that the report was not objectively prepared or the insurer’s reliance\n\non the report was unreasonable. Id. Evidence casting doubt on the reliability of the insurer’s\n\nexpert’s opinions may support a bad faith finding. Id. Whether the insurer’s liability had\n\nbecome reasonably clear, however, must be judged by the facts before the insurer at the time the\n\nclaim was denied. Viles v. Sec. Nat’l Ins. Co., 788 S.W.2d 566, 567 (Tex. 1990).\n\n       The Cantus did not argue at trial that Southland hired Arnold because of any lack of\n\nobjectivity on his part; however, on appeal, the Cantus assert Southland sent Arnold to perform\n\nan outcome-oriented investigation. But to show bad faith, the Cantus were required to produce\n\nevidence showing “behavior more egregious than merely hiring a firm whose reports generally\n\nfeature an outcome favored by its recipient.” See Travelers Pers. Sec. Ins. v. McClelland, 189\n\nS.W.3d 846, 854 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2006, no pet.); see also Nicolau, 951 S.W.2d\n\nat 449 (“All experts presumably have certain general views and expertise, and an insurer’s mere\n\nawareness of such views is not necessarily an indication of bad faith.”).\n\n       The only evidence in the record as to why Southland retained Arnold comes from the\n\ntestimony of Roy Hignight, the Southland employee who handled the Cantus’ claim and who\n\nhired Arnold. Hignight stated that Arnold had adjusted claims for Southland for about ten years,\n\nand he knew Arnold to be an experienced independent insurance adjuster. Thus, nothing in the\n\nrecord indicates Southland hired Arnold based on any view he personally held. See Nicolau, 951\n\nS.W.2d at 448 (concluding evidence supported logical inference that State Farm obtained reports\n\nfrom Haag Engineering because of Haag’s general view that plumbing leaks (a covered loss) are\n\nunlikely to cause foundation damage). Mr. Cantu testified Arnold spent only about forty-five\n\nminutes at the house and the jury heard Arnold’s own testimony that he inspected twelve to\n\nthirteen houses on one day for Southland. Arnold testified that over the past ten years he had\n\n\n\n                                               - 15 -\n\f                                                                                   04-09-00705-CV\n\n\nworked for more than two dozen different insurance companies. However, the record contains\n\nno evidence as to Arnold’s general view of claims work for either Southland specifically or other\n\ninsurance companies generally. See State Farm Lloyds v. Hamilton, 265 S.W.3d 725, 735 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Dallas 2008, pet. dism’d) (record contained evidence that insurer’s expert never testified\n\nagainst insurer’s interest and derived a large part of his business from insurer). Because the\n\nCantus produced no evidence that would support an inference that Arnold’s report was not\n\nobjectively prepared, we next consider whether Southland’s reliance on Arnold’s report was\n\nreasonable.\n\n       The Cantus contend the reasonableness of Southland’s decision to pay what it did is\n\ncalled into question by (1) its reliance on Arnold’s “slip-shot” inspection and “low-ball”\n\nestimate, and (2) the fact that, when faced with evidence “purportedly” from the Cantus that the\n\nestimate it paid was not sufficient and that Southland had missed significant elements of the\n\ncovered damages in its own estimates, Southland did nothing. The Cantus’ argument focuses on\n\nthe depth of the investigation into the damage that resulted from the hailstorm. The Cantus\n\ncontend Arnold spent only about forty-five minutes at the house, he did not document in his\n\nreport all the damage they allege was caused by the storm, and he took an inappropriate amount\n\nof depreciation. Although Arnold disputed Mr. Cantu’s estimate of the length of time he spent at\n\nthe house, it was for the jury to decide whose testimony to accept on this question. There is no\n\ndispute that Arnold did not photograph all the damage in the house. However, Arnold testified\n\nhe documents only damage that results from a covered loss, and Hignight agreed it would not be\n\npossible for adjusters to document every single damaged item in a structure without regard to\n\nwhether the damage resulted from a covered loss. For example, Arnold photographed one stain\n\non the ceiling but not a second stain because the Cantus told him the second stain pre-existed the\n\n\n\n                                              - 16 -\n\f                                                                                     04-09-00705-CV\n\n\nhailstorm. The Cantus denied this, and testified both ceiling stains appeared after the storm. The\n\nCantus rely on Barton’s report to allege there was water and hail damage throughout the house to\n\na greater extent than that documented in Arnold’s report. Again, the jury was free to credit the\n\nCantus’ testimony and Barton’s report over that of Arnold. However, to establish bad faith,\n\nrather than a mere breach of contract, the Cantus were required to show more than a “simple\n\ndisagreement among experts about whether the cause of loss is one covered by the policy . . . .”\n\nMoriel, 879 S.W.2d at 18. A conflict between the carrier’s expert and other experts may or may\n\nnot, standing alone, be sufficient to allow a “bad faith” claim to go to a jury. Guajardo v. Liberty\n\nMut. Ins. Co., 831 S.W.2d 358, 365 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1992, writ denied). “In addition\n\nto the conflicting expert opinion, the party alleging bad faith must also bring direct or\n\ncircumstantial evidence showing that the carrier’s expert’s opinion was questionable and that the\n\ncarrier knew or should have known that the opinion was questionable.” Id.\n\n       The depth of Arnold’s investigation was the same as Barton’s in that both inspected the\n\ninside and outside of the house and took various measurements. Mr. Cantu conceded he had\n\nconversations with both men about the extent of the damage. Southland received two estimates\n\nbefore the lawsuit was filed: one from Arnold in the amount of $4,390.50 that included damage\n\nto both the inside and outside of the house, and one from Stites in the amount of $6,855.66 that\n\nincluded damage only to the outside of the house. Southland received the third estimate from\n\nBarton after the lawsuit was filed in the amount of $65,000 that included damage to both the\n\ninside and outside of the house, but no depreciation.         Regardless of the reasons for the\n\ndisagreement amongst the three adjusters, the fact remains that they disagreed and provided\n\nSouthland with three widely varying estimates. That Arnold’s estimate was lower than Stites’\n\nestimate, which, in turn, was lower than Barton’s estimate “only establishes the estimates\n\n\n\n                                               - 17 -\n\f                                                                                    04-09-00705-CV\n\n\ndiffered.” Johnson v. Essex Ins. Co., No. 04-00-00745-CV, 2002 WL 112561, at *8 (Tex.\n\nApp.—San Antonio Jan. 30, 2002, no pet.) (mem. op.). “Similarly, evidence that the scope of\n\nrepairs in [Arnold’s] report ‘does not come close to matching’ [Barton’s] report is not evidence\n\nof unreasonableness.” Id. Therefore, we also look to Southland’s actions with regard to the\n\ndiffering reports and whether Stites’s pre-lawsuit estimate of damage cast doubt on the reliability\n\nof Arnold’s estimate of damage.\n\n       Roy Hignight first received the claim on April 5, 2004, the day after the storm. The next\n\nday, Hignight informed the Cantus by letter that Southland had received their claim and an\n\nadjuster would contact them. The letter provided the Cantus with Robert Arnold’s name and\n\ntelephone number. Although Mr. Cantu testified he did not remember receiving the letter,\n\nHignight testified the letter was mailed to the Cantus and was never returned to Southland as not\n\ndelivered. Arnold arrived at the house about seven days after the storm. Arnold’s estimate for\n\ntotal loss amounted to $4,390.50, less depreciation of $1,933.65 and the deductible of $420, for a\n\nnet claim amount of $2,036.85.\n\n       Hignight testified that when he reviewed Arnold’s report, he saw nothing wrong with it,\n\nexcept he did not believe the spot on the ceiling needed to be repaired. However, because\n\nArnold’s estimate allowed for the cost of repair, Hignight did not contest the repair estimate, and\n\nhe paid the claim in the amount recommended by Arnold. By letter dated April 27, 2004,\n\nHignight enclosed a copy of Arnold’s estimate and informed the Cantus that a claim check in the\n\namount of $2,036.85 would be mailed to their agent within seven working days. Hignight said\n\nthat the check was cashed and he never heard from the Cantus or SAS-Lowery until he received\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 18 -\n\f                                                                                                04-09-00705-CV\n\n\na June 17, 2004 letter purportedly4 signed by the Cantus. In this letter, the Cantus expressly\n\nauthorized Ortiz and/or Stites to act on their behalf with respect to the claim and appointed Ortiz\n\nand/or Stites as their agent to meet with Southland, its employees, and adjustors “to discuss this\n\nloss and work toward a mutually satisfactory settlement of this claim.” The Cantus reserved to\n\nthemselves the right to enter into a final settlement of the claim, but asked that Joe A. Ortiz,\n\nBuilding Consultant, be named as a co-payee on any drafts or checks. The letter ended by\n\nstating that “[i]n the unlikely event that the services of an attorney become necessary, [the\n\nCantus ] will provide you with the name of [their] attorney.” Hignight believed the letter meant\n\nthe Cantus wanted him to work directly with Ortiz or Stites as their agent. When Hignight\n\nreceived the letter, he forwarded a copy to Arnold. On July 9, 2004, Hignight received a copy of\n\na June 16, 2004 estimate prepared by Stites for Joatmon Loss Services, Inc., which estimated the\n\ncost of repairs at $6,855.66. Hignight sent Arnold a copy of the estimate and asked Arnold to\n\ncontact Stites and ask for an explanation as to why the unit costs were so high and to see if they\n\ncould work things out. The next day, Arnold faxed a copy of the Stites estimate to both Hignight\n\nand Stites with Arnold’s handwritten notes on various line items in the estimate. Arnold also\n\nfaxed a copy of his own estimate to Stites.               On the fax coversheet to Hignight, Arnold\n\ncharacterized the Stites estimate as “excessive” and he stated he was awaiting Stites’ response.\n\nOn the fax coversheet to Stites, Arnold wrote as follows:\n\n        We have recvd & revwd your repair bid for the above referenced insured.

We are faxing you our repair estimate to review and go\n        by.\n               Please call me or fax me your reply.\n\n\n4\n  Mr. Cantu testified he and his wife hired Ortiz after a community meeting, but he claimed he and his wife only\nsigned a blank sheet of paper. The letter has the Cantus’ names and address in the letterhead and is addressed to\nSAS-Lowery Insurance Agency, which forwarded the letter to Hignight.\n\n\n                                                     - 19 -\n\f                                                                                  04-09-00705-CV\n\n\nSouthland was not aware of the Cantus’ dissatisfaction with Ortiz and neither Arnold nor\n\nHignight received a response from Stites, Ortiz, or anyone at Joatmon.\n\n       The Stites estimate, which did not account for depreciation or the Cantus’ deductible,\n\ncalled for replacing the roof, painting the exterior fascia, and final cleanup for a total of\n\n$6,855.66, compared to Arnold’s pre-depreciation/deductible estimate of $4,390.50. Hignight\n\nexplained his interpretation of the Stites estimate as follows:\n\n       It showed me that it was the same scope as Bobby Arnold’s estimate.\n\n                                              ...\n\n               Well, the areas that Marcus Stites allowed for was [sic] the same areas\n       Bobby Arnold allowed for, with the exception that Bobby Arnold allowed for\n       interior damage and repairs to the air conditioning and windows and which\n       Marcus Stites did not allow that.\n\n                                              ...\n\n              I interpreted [Stites’ not allowing for interior damage] as that Mr. Stites\n       did not have any issues with the interior allowance made by Mr. Arnold; that his\n       concern was on the — on the roof and other exterior items that Bobby Arnold\n       allowed for.\n\n\nWhen asked why Stites’s estimate was almost $2,000 more than the Arnold estimate, Hignight\n\nresponded that some of the items on Stites’s report appeared “to be extremely high.”\n\n       The next and last time Hignight heard anything about the Cantus’ claim was December\n\n20, 2004 when Arnold faxed to him a letter signed by the Cantus and mailed to Arnold. In the\n\nletter, which was dated October 12, 2004 but not received by Arnold until December 20, 2004,\n\nthe Cantus “invoke[d] the appraisal process” because they believed “the funds that Colonial\n\nLloyds Insurance Company estimated to repair [their] house are not sufficient.”        Hignight\n\ntestified that Southland and Colonial Lloyds Insurance Company are not the same company.\n\nHignight also said that language in the letter that referenced the appraisal process was not\n\n                                                - 20 -\n\f                                                                                        04-09-00705-CV\n\n\nlanguage contained in the policy Southland issued to the Cantus. Hignight thought the Cantus\n\nwere referencing an entirely different policy on other property they owned. However, Hignight\n\nconceded that the policy number referenced in the letter was the Cantus’ Southland policy and\n\nthe claim number referenced the hailstorm claim. He admitted that despite his confusion he did\n\nnot attempt to contact the Cantus or anyone working on their behalf.\n\n           Hignight said that until the Cantus sued in November 2005, he knew only of the Stites\n\nestimate, which was a couple of thousand dollars more than the Arnold estimate. In mid-\n\nNovember 2005, Hignight received the Cantus’ petition in which they alleged they “sustained\n\ncovered losses in the form of accidental plumbing or air condition leaks and discharges, water\n\ndamage, and damage resulting therefrom including damage to the architectural finishes of the\n\nhome . . . .” The petition did not specifically mention the April 2004 hailstorm, nor did the\n\npetition complain specifically about the manner in which Southland handled the hailstorm claim.\n\nUpon receiving the petition, Hignight contacted the Cantus’ insurance agent at SAS-Lowery,\n\nOlga Lopez, because Southland had never heard of a problem with the accidental discharge of\n\nwater, and Lopez informed him SAS-Lowery had received a hand-written letter dated October 3,\n\n2005 from the Cantus asserting additional water damage. 5 Hignight asked Lopez why the\n\nOctober 3 letter had not been immediately sent to Southland, and Lopez said she did not know\n\nwhat the letter was in reference to. Hignight said he finally realized the lawsuit was filed in\n\nconnection with the hailstorm when he received a copy of the Barton estimate in October 2006,\n\nalmost one year after the lawsuit was filed. Hignight characterized the Barton estimate as\n\n“excessive” because “[v]irtually every surface area on the house is damaged to include decking,\n\nflooring, interior walls, kitchen cabinetry, bathrooms, bedrooms, exterior siding, everything on\n\nthe house is claimed to be damaged in this scope.”\n5\n    Mr. Cantu testified the letter was hand-written for him at his attorney’s office.\n\n                                                            - 21 -\n\f                                                                                    04-09-00705-CV\n\n\n         Southland paid considerably less than what the Cantus believed their losses to be;\n\nhowever, the evidence shows the Cantus cashed Southland’s check without complaint. Two\n\nmonths later, Southland received a letter in which the Cantus authorized Ortiz and/or Stites to act\n\non their behalf, and appointed Ortiz and/or Stites to meet with Southland’s adjusters and\n\nemployees to discuss the loss “and work toward a mutually satisfactory settlement of” their\n\nclaim.    Although Mr. Cantu testified he later became dissatisfied with Ortiz, he never\n\ncommunicated this dissatisfaction to either Southland or Arnold. Therefore, acting in accordance\n\nwith the terms of the letter, Southland attempted to communicate only with Stites. When\n\nSouthland received Stites’s estimate and attempted to contact Stites regarding his estimate,\n\nSouthland never received a response.\n\n         The fact of liability for damage caused by the hailstorm was clear, and Southland\n\npromptly issued a check to cover repairs for storm damage as determined by its adjuster.\n\nPursuant to the terms of the insurance contract, Southland was not liable for normal wear and\n\ntear. The question, thus, became a coverage dispute: whether all of the damage alleged by the\n\nCantus was the result of the hailstorm, and if caused by the storm, the extent of repair versus\n\nreplacement necessary to put the Cantus back into the position they were in before the storm.\n\nLiability as to this question was not reasonably clear at the time Southland paid the claim and\n\nwas ultimately decided by the jury in this case. Therefore, we conclude there is no evidence that\n\nSouthland’s reliance on Arnold’s report was unreasonable, nor is there any other evidence from\n\nwhich a factfinder could infer that Southland failed to attempt in good faith to effectuate a\n\nprompt, fair, and equitable settlement when its liability had become reasonably clear or that\n\nSouthland failed to conduct a reasonable investigation based on all available information. For\n\nthese same reasons, we also conclude there is no evidence the Cantus were compelled to institute\n\n\n\n                                               - 22 -\n\f                                                                                                    04-09-00705-CV\n\n\na lawsuit to recover amounts due under their policy because Southland offered substantially less\n\nthan the amounts ultimately recovered.               Accordingly, we conclude the evidence is legally\n\ninsufficient to support a finding on bad faith. 6\n\n                                         BREACH OF CONTRACT\n\n         The jury awarded the Cantus $30,000 as compensation for Southland’s failure to pay for\n\ncovered physical loss to their home. In its third issue, Southland contends the Cantus are not\n\nentitled to recover on their breach of contract claim because they failed to segregate what was a\n\n“covered loss” under the policy from what was not a “covered loss” in Barton’s report.\n\n         The premise of Southland’s argument, with which we agree, is that an insured is entitled\n\nto recover only that portion of the damage caused solely by a covered peril. See Wallis v. United\n\nServs. Auto. Assoc., 2 S.W.3d 300, 302-03 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1999, pet. denied).\n\nHowever, Wallis and the other opinions upon which Southland relies all involved cases in which\n\nthe jury was asked to allocate damage attributable to a peril specifically covered under the\n\ninsurance policy versus damage attributable to a peril specifically excluded under the policy. For\n\nexample, in Wallis, USAA determined the foundation damage to the insureds’ house was caused\n\nby a combination of several excluded perils, including settlement, poor surface drainage, the\n\ntopography of the lot, and surrounding vegetation. Id. at 301-02. Plumbing leaks, which were\n\ncovered perils under the policy, were also detected; however, based on soil testing and continued\n\nearth settlement following repair of the insureds’ plumbing system, USAA concluded the leaks\n\nwere negligible and had not caused or contributed to the complained-of damage.                               USAA\n\nbelieved improper compaction of the fill dirt upon which the insureds’ foundation rested was the\n\nprimary source of the problem. Experts for the insureds did not refute USAA’s evidence\n\n\n6\n We, therefore, do not reach the issue of whether there is evidence to support the jury’s finding that Southland acted\nwith “actual awareness of the falsity, deception, or unfairness of the conduct in question.”\n\n                                                        - 23 -\n\f                                                                                   04-09-00705-CV\n\n\nregarding the excluded perils. They did, however, challenge the conclusion drawn regarding the\n\neffect of the plumbing leaks, and claimed instead that the leaks could not be excluded as a\n\ncontributing cause of the damage. Id. at 302.\n\n       At trial, the jury was asked to determine whether perils excluded under the policy caused\n\nthe damage.    The jury was also charged with determining whether “accidental discharge,\n\nleakage, or overflow of water from within a plumbing system” contributed to the damage. The\n\njury answered both questions affirmatively and found that thirty-five percent of the damage was\n\ncaused by plumbing leaks. In its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, USAA\n\nasserted its entitlement to judgment on several grounds, including that even if damage caused by\n\na plumbing leak is covered, the insureds failed to produce any evidence to demonstrate what\n\nportion of the loss was caused solely by the plumbing leak. The trial court disregarded the jury’s\n\nanswer to question two, granted USAA’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and\n\nentered a take-nothing judgment in favor of USAA.\n\n       On appeal, a panel of this court concluded the record contained evidence from which the\n\njury could conclude that plumbing leaks had contributed to the loss. Id. at 303. However, the\n\ninsureds’ engineers could not indicate the extent to which this peril damaged the home, and this\n\nwas “fatal” to the insureds’ claim. Id. at 304. This court held there was no basis from which the\n\njury could reasonably infer that thirty-five percent of the damage was caused by the plumbing\n\nleaks. Id. “The jury heard no testimony regarding how much of the . . . damage was caused by\n\nthe plumbing leaks. It learned only that plumbing leaks were found.” Id. Because there was no\n\nevidence upon which the jury could determine that thirty-five percent of the damage was caused\n\nby plumbing leaks, this court concluded the trial court properly granted a take-nothing judgment\n\nin favor of USAA.\n\n\n\n                                                - 24 -\n\f                                                                                      04-09-00705-CV\n\n\n        Here, there was no dispute that damage from a hailstorm was a covered peril and the jury\n\nwas not presented with other possible excluded perils. Instead, in this case, the only dispute was\n\nthe extent of the damage caused by the covered peril, and the evidence went beyond merely\n\ninforming the jury that hail damage was “found.” Unlike in Wallis, the jury heard testimony\n\nregarding how much of the Cantus’ damage was caused by the hailstorm: the Barton report\n\nitemized the damage and the Cantus and Boutin testified that all of the itemized damage was\n\ncaused by hail. Southland’s expert claimed some of the damage he saw—when he went to the\n\nhouse two years after the hailstorm—was caused by “chronic water damage” such as from air\n\nconditioning condensation drainage or the use of water sprinklers. Therefore, unlike in Wallis,\n\nthe jury here was not required to guess what percentage of the damage was caused by the\n\nhailstorm; instead, the jury was faced with a credibility question: the Cantus claimed all the\n\ndamage itemized in Barton’s report was due to hail, while Southland claimed some of the\n\ndamage was caused by ordinary wear and tear. The jury apparently believed the Cantus and their\n\nexpert, and we defer to that determination. Accordingly, we overrule Southland’s third issue.\n\n                                        ATTORNEY’S FEES\n\n        In its fifth issue, Southland asserts the award of attorney’s fees should be reversed for the\n\nfollowing reasons: (1) there is no recovery for breach of contract or violation of the Insurance\n\nCode, and (2) the Cantus failed to make a pretrial disclosure of the manner of calculation of the\n\nfees in response to a request for disclosure.           Because we overrule Southland’s complaint\n\nregarding the Cantus’ breach of contract claim, the Cantus are entitled to attorney’s fees. See\n\nTEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 38.001(8) (West 2008) (“A person may recover\n\nreasonable attorney’s fees from an individual or corporation, in addition to the amount of a valid\n\nclaim and costs, if the claim is for . . . an oral or written contract.”).\n\n\n\n                                                   - 25 -\n\f                                                                                    04-09-00705-CV\n\n\n       As to Southland’s second argument, SAS-Lowery’s pretrial request for disclosure asked\n\nthe Cantus for “the amount and any method of calculating economic damages.” See TEX. R. CIV.\n\nP. 194.2(d) (“A party may request disclosure of . . . the amount and any method of calculating\n\neconomic damages.”). In response, the Cantus stated they would “be seeking the following\n\ndamages”: (1) actual damages, (2) compensatory damages, (3) mental anguish, (4) attorney’s\n\nfees, and (5) punitive, exemplary, and/or treble damages. In response to a question regarding the\n\nidentity of any testifying expert, the Cantus stated they might call Matthew Pearson or Marc\n\nGravely, who would “testify about the reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees incurred by [the\n\nCantus] in prosecuting this action. [The Cantus’] counsel does not keep detailed billing records\n\nfor contingent fee cases but generally charges [sic] $250.00 an hour for insurance cases of this\n\ntype.” On appeal, Southland contends that despite its Rule 194.2(d) request, prior to trial the\n\nCantus never disclosed any amount of attorney’s fees accrued or gave any means by which the\n\nfees would be calculated. Southland argues that because the Cantus failed “to make, amend, or\n\nsupplement a discovery response in a timely manner [they] may not introduce in evidence the\n\nmaterial or information that was not timely disclosed, or offer the testimony of a witness (other\n\nthan a named party) who was not timely identified . . . .” See TEX. R. CIV. P. 193.6(a).\n\n       We disagree with Southland. The Cantus’ response to the discovery request identified\n\nthe attorneys and stated that the attorneys did not track their hours in contingent fees cases, but\n\nfor insurance cases such as the one here charged $250 per hour. Under the circumstances of this\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 26 -\n\f                                                                                                04-09-00705-CV\n\n\ncase, we conclude this response was sufficient. 7 Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion by allowing the Cantus’ attorney to testify about his fees.\n\n                                MOTION TO COMPEL APPRAISAL\n\n        After the lawsuit was filed, Southland asked the Cantus to submit to an appraisal process\n\nto determine the amount of damage that occurred in the hailstorm. The Cantus did not respond\n\nand Southland filed a motion to compel, which the trial court denied after a hearing. At trial, the\n\ncourt excluded evidence offered by Southland of the Cantus’ alleged refusal to participate in the\n\nappraisal process. In its sixth issue, Southland asserts the trial court erred by denying the motion\n\nfor an appraisal and excluding the evidence at trial.\n\n        Appraisal provisions are included in most property insurance policies and are\n\nenforceable. See State Farm Lloyds v. Johnson, 290 S.W.3d 886, 888 (Tex. 2009). However,\n\n“[p]rovisions of an insurance policy requiring proof of loss and appraisal are inserted for the\n\ninsurer’s benefit and may be waived by it.” Int’l Serv. Ins. Co. v. Brodie, 337 S.W.2d 414, 415\n\n(Tex. Civ. App.—Fort Worth 1960, writ ref’d n.r.e.).\n\n        Waiver is ordinarily a question of fact, but when the facts are admitted or clearly\n\nestablished, it becomes a question of law. Tenneco, Inc. v. Enter. Prods. Co., 925 S.W.2d 640,\n\n643 (Tex. 1996); cf. In re Acadia Ins. Co., 279 S.W.3d 777, 780 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2007,\n\norig. proceeding) (denying mandamus relief where trial court resolved factual dispute concerning\n\nwhether insurer waived its right to appraisal).               Here, there does not appear to be any\n\ndisagreement about the facts concerning the actions leading to Southland’s demand for an\n\n7\n  “[A]ttorney fees are not economic damages.” McCarthy v. Padre Beach Homes, Inc., No. 13-01-846-CV, 2003\nWL 22025858, at *4 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi Aug. 29, 2003, no pet.) (mem. op.); see also TEX. GOV’T CODE\nANN. § 25.0003(c) (West 2004) (excluding attorney’s fees from calculation of county court’s jurisdictional amount\nin controversy). Damages are defined as compensation in money imposed by law for loss or injury. Geters v. Eagle\nIns. Co., 834 S.W.2d 49, 50 (Tex. 1992) (noting that statute allowed for recovery of both damages and attorney’s\nfees, and because statute did not define “damages,” court turned to dictionary definition). “Recovery of attorney\nfees, on the other hand, is permitted by statute, rules of procedure, a contract between the parties, or equity.”\nMcCarthy, 2003 WL 22025858, at *4.\n\n                                                     - 27 -\n\f                                                                                     04-09-00705-CV\n\n\nappraisal. Therefore, we must determine whether the trial court correctly applied the law to\n\nthese undisputed facts.\n\n       In a letter dated October 12, 2004 but not received by Southland until December 20,\n\n2004, the Cantus “invoke[d] the appraisal process” because they believed “the funds that\n\nColonial Lloyds Insurance Company estimated to repair [their] house are not sufficient.”\n\nHignight testified that Southland and Colonial Lloyds Insurance Company are not the same\n\ncompany and language in the letter that referenced the appraisal process was not language\n\ncontained in the policy Southland issued to the Cantus. The letter ends with this sentence:\n\n“Please forward this information to the individual you choose to represent Southland Lloyds\n\nInsurance Company in this appraisal.”\n\n       The Southland appraisal provision, and the language quoted in the October 2004 letter are\n\nidentical in all but two respects. The first sentence of the Southland provision states: “If you and\n\nwe fail to agree on the actual cash value, amount of loss, or the cost of repair, either can make a\n\nwritten demand for appraisal.” The first sentence contained in the letter states: “If you and we\n\nfail to agree on the actual cash value, amount of loss, or the cost of repair or replacement, either\n\ncan make a written demand for appraisal” (emphasis added).           The letter also contains the\n\nfollowing additional language not contained in the Southland provision:\n\n       If you or we request that they do so, the appraisers will also set:\n       a) the full replacement cost of the dwelling\n       b) the full replacement cost of any other building upon which loss is claimed\n       c) the full cost of repair or replacement of loss to such building without deduction\n       for depreciation.\n\n       Southland never responded to the Cantus’ letter. The Cantus filed suit almost one year\n\nlater, on November 7, 2005. On April 9, 2007, Southland filed its motion to compel the\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 28 -\n\f                                                                                                      04-09-00705-CV\n\n\nappraisal process, which was denied after a hearing. Southland did not attempt to obtain relief\n\nvia a petition for writ of mandamus. Trial commenced in April 2009.\n\n         Silence or inaction for an unreasonable period of time may show an intention to yield a\n\nknown right. Tenneco, 925 S.W.2d at 643-44 (finding waiver of operating agreement’s terms by\n\nthree-year silence after transfer of shares). However, “the date of disagreement, or impasse, is\n\nthe point of reference to determine whether a demand for an appraisal is made within a\n\nreasonable time.” In re Slavonic Mut. Fire Ins. Ass’n, 308 S.W.3d 556, 562 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2010, orig. proceeding). Here, Southland received a copy of the letter in\n\nwhich the Cantus invoked the appraisal process on December 20, 2004.                               Southland never\n\nresponded to this letter. The Cantus filed suit on November 7, 2005. Following this date,\n\nSouthland waited another sixteen months to file its motion, which was almost two and one-half\n\nyears after the Cantus’ letter invoking the appraisal process. 8 For these reasons, we conclude the\n\ntrial court did not err in denying Southland’s motion for an appraisal. 9\n\n                                BROAD-FORM DAMAGES QUESTION\n\n         In question number two, the jury was asked what sum of money would compensate the\n\nCantus for damages to their home resulting from Southland’s failure to pay for covered physical\n\nloss. The jury awarded $30,000. In its seventh and last issue, Southland contends this broad\n\nform question was error. Southland contends the jury’s answer could have been based on\n\n\n8\n  We agree with Southland that it did not waive any error on the trial court’s part by not filing a petition for writ of\nmandamus. However, Southland’s not pursuing relief by mandamus is relevant to the issue of whether it waived its\nright to appraisal. The Slavonic court held that the insurance company had no adequate remedy by appeal because\ndenying the right to an appraisal denied the insurance company “the development of proof going to the heart of its\ncase . . . .” Id. at 564. Here, Southland did not file a petition for writ of mandamus, but instead continued with\ndiscovery and went to trial.\n9\n Because we conclude the trial court did not err in denying Southland’s motion for an appraisal, we do not address\nSouthland’s related complaint that the court erred by not allowing into evidence the Cantus’ alleged refusal to\nparticipate in the appraisal process.\n\n\n                                                         - 29 -\n\f                                                                                     04-09-00705-CV\n\n\nevidence that did not qualify as a covered loss, such as replacing all the drywall in a room\n\nbecause there was a water stain on the ceiling, or replacing all the siding when only two sides of\n\nthe house were damaged. Southland asserts that without separate answer blanks as to each type\n\nof repair that the jury found amounted to a total of $30,000, it is impossible to tell what “losses”\n\nthe jury included within the $30,000. Therefore, Southland concludes that under Crown Life Ins.\n\nv. Casteel, 22 S.W.3d 378 (Tex. 2000), it is deprived of any meaningful appellate review.\n\n       In Casteel, the trial court submitted a single broad-form question on the issue of Crown’s\n\nliability to Casteel. The question requested a single answer on Crown’s liability, which the jury\n\nanswered affirmatively. Id. at 387. The Supreme Court concluded the trial court erred in\n\nsubmitting four of the five DTPA grounds for liability because the plaintiff did not have standing\n\nto bring those claims. Id. at 387-88. The Supreme Court held: “When a single broad-form\n\nliability question erroneously commingles valid and invalid liability theories and the appellant’s\n\nobjection is timely and specific, the error is harmful when it cannot be determined whether the\n\nimproperly submitted theories formed the sole basis for the jury’s finding.”            Id. at 389.\n\nRecognizing that broad-form submission should be used when feasible, the Court explained that\n\ngranulated submission should be used when a liability theory is uncertain. Id. at 390. The\n\nSupreme Court later extended the Casteel holding to broad-form questions that commingle\n\ndamage elements when an element is unsupported by legally sufficient evidence. See Harris\n\nCounty v. Smith, 96 S.W.3d 230, 235 (Tex. 2002). In that case, as to awarding damages to one\n\nplaintiff, the jury considered (a) physical pain and mental anguish, (b) loss of earning capacity,\n\n(c) physical impairment, and (d) medical care. Id. at 231. As to the other plaintiff’s potential\n\ndamages, the jury could consider (a) physical pain and mental anguish, (b) physical impairment,\n\nand (c) medical care. Id. at 232. The defendant objected to both questions, asked that the trial\n\n\n\n                                               - 30 -\n\f                                                                                 04-09-00705-CV\n\n\ncourt submit each damage element separately, and complained there was no evidence of loss of\n\nearning capacity as to the first plaintiff and no evidence of any physical impairment as to the\n\nsecond plaintiff.   The Supreme Court concluded the trial court erred in overruling Harris\n\nCounty’s objection to the charge, “which mixed valid and invalid elements of damages in a\n\nsingle broad-form submission, and that such error was harmful because it prevented the appellate\n\ncourt from determining ‘whether the jury based its verdict on an improperly submitted invalid\n\nelement of damage.’” Id. at 234.\n\n       We do not believe Casteel and Harris County apply here because the court’s charge did\n\nnot contain a broad-form damage question that commingled multiple damage elements or\n\ntheories of recovery. Instead, we believe the analysis in Matbon, Inc. v. Gries, 288 S.W.3d 471\n\n(Tex. App.—Eastland 2009, no pet.) applies. In that case, the plaintiffs sought future medical\n\ndamages. At trial, the court admitted into evidence an expert’s testimony that the plaintiffs\n\nwould need a new home and the services of a financial advisor. The defendants objected that\n\nfuture medical expenses are limited to actual medical expenses, and therefore, the cost of a new\n\nhome and the fees for a financial advisor are not recoverable as future medical expenses. Id. at\n\n483. The Eastland Court of Appeals agreed with the defendants. The court then examined\n\nwhether the error was harmful. Relying on Casteel and Harris County, the plaintiffs asserted the\n\ndefendants waived this contention because they did not ask the trial court to include in the\n\ncourt’s charge separate damage questions for each of the challenged items of future medical\n\ndamages that the plaintiffs sought. The court of appeals concluded those cases were inapplicable\n\nbecause the court’s charge did not contain a broad-form damage question that commingled\n\nmultiple damage elements. Id. at 484. Because “[a] claim for future medical damages is a\n\nseparate element of damages available to a personal injury claimant,” the court rejected the\n\n\n\n                                             - 31 -\n\f                                                                                    04-09-00705-CV\n\n\nplaintiffs’ contention that the future medical damages question should be broken down into\n\nseparate sub-parts whenever some of the items sought to be recovered as future medical damages\n\nare challenged.” Id.\n\n       Here, this is not a case where the single broad-form question commingled multiple\n\ndamage elements or theories of recovery; for example, compensation for loss to the Cantus’\n\nhome and mental anguish. Instead, the only type of damage submitted was compensation for\n\nphysical damage to the home, which is a separate element of damages available to the Cantus.\n\nThe jury had before it Barton’s estimate, which itemized the damage and the cost to repair each\n\nline item of damage. Therefore, the trial court was not required to list all the various types of\n\nphysical damage the Cantus alleged were caused by the hailstorm.\n\n                                        CONCLUSION\n\n       The Cantus elected to recover under their bad faith claim, rather than their breach of\n\ncontract claim. We conclude the evidence in support of the jury’s bad faith findings is legally\n\ninsufficient; therefore, we reverse the trial court’s judgment on that claim and render a take-\n\nnothing judgment in favor of Southland on the Cantus’ bad faith claim. However, because we\n\noverrule Southland’s issue on the breach of contract claim, we render judgment in the amount of\n\n$30,000 in favor of the Cantus on that claim.           Finally, because we overrule Southland’s\n\nchallenge to the award of attorney’s fees, we render judgment in favor of the Cantus for the\n\namount of fees as stated in the trial court’s judgment. We remand this cause to the trial court for\n\nentry of a judgment that is consistent with this opinion and that includes a re-calculation of the\n\naward of prejudgment interest.\n\n                                                  Sandee Bryan Marion, Justice\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 32 -\n\f",

The\n\nCantus’ house was insured under a policy with Southland Lloyds Insurance Co. Southland sent\n\nan independent adjustor, Bobby Arnold, to the Cantus’ home to inspect the damage on April 13,\n\n2004. On April 27, 2004, Southland mailed to the Cantus a copy of Arnold’s repair estimate and\n\na letter advising them that a claim check in the amount of $2,036.85 would be sent to their\n\f                                                                                      04-09-00705-CV\n\n\ninsurance agent within seven working days. On April 29, 2004, the check was sent to the\n\nCantus’ insurance agent at SAS-Lowery Insurance Agency. The Cantus cashed the check, but\n\ndid not otherwise respond to Southland regarding the Arnold estimate. However, in June 2004,\n\nthe Cantus notified Southland by letter that they had employed Joe Ortiz as a “building\n\nconsultant” to investigate the extent of loss to their home. In the letter, the Cantus authorized\n\nOrtiz and/or Marcus Stites to act on their behalf. However, because Ortiz never returned Mr.\n\nCantu’s telephone calls, the Cantus later decided to hire an attorney.          On July 10, 2004,\n\nSouthland received an estimate prepared by Stites for Joatmon Loss Services in the amount of\n\n$6,855.66. Southland, unaware that the Cantus were dissatisfied with Ortiz and had hired an\n\nattorney, asked Arnold to contact Stites to determine why the estimate was so high. Southland\n\nnever received a response from Joatmon or Stites. In June 2006, Bob Barton of Barton Claim\n\nService inspected the Cantus’ house at their request. He prepared a report that concluded most\n\nof the interior and exterior surfaces of the house had to be replaced for a total of $65,000.\n\n       The Cantus eventually sued Southland on claims for breach of contract and bad faith.\n\nSouthland generally denied and also pled accord and satisfaction on the grounds that it had paid\n\n$2,036.85 in satisfaction of the “covered losses” under the policy. A jury found in favor of the\n\nCantus. Southland now appeals.\n\n                                       CANTUS’ EXPERT\n\n       At trial, Bob Barton did not testify. Instead, Art Boutin, who adopted Barton’s estimate,\n\ntestified on the Cantus’ behalf regarding the extent of damage to their house caused by the\n\nhailstorm. In its first issue, Southland raises several complaints regarding Boutin’s testimony.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\f                                                                                           04-09-00705-CV\n\n\n1.         Relevance and Reliability\n\n           Under the policy, Southland’s liability was limited to the lesser of the following: (1) the\n\nactual cash value at the time of loss determined with proper deduction for depreciation; (2) the\n\ncost to repair or replace the damaged property with material of like kind and quality, with proper\n\ndeduction for depreciation; or (3) the specified limit of liability of the policy. According to\n\nSouthland, Boutin’s opinion that the hailstorm caused more than $65,000 in damage was not\n\nrelevant because (1) he did not review the policy; (2) he did not intend to opine on whether the\n\ndamage was covered by the terms of the policy; (3) he made no effort to determine whether any\n\nof the losses were “covered losses” under the policy; (4) his estimate was not economically\n\nfeasible because the Cantus’ house was valued at only $40,000; 1 and (5) he did not verify\n\nwhether the items listed as damages in Barton’s report were actually damaged. Thus, Southland\n\nconcludes, Boutin’s opinion is not relevant because he ignored what Southland characterizes as\n\nthe “essential measure of damages in this case,” which is “actual cash value [of the cost of\n\nrepairs at the time of the loss] less depreciation.” Southland also asserts Boutin’s opinion is\n\nunreliable because it was speculative and there is too wide an analytical gap between his\n\ntestimony and the Barton report on which he relied.\n\n           An expert’s testimony is admissible under Texas Rule of Evidence 702 if the expert is\n\nqualified, 2 and the expert’s opinion is relevant to the issues in the case and based upon a reliable\n\nfoundation.

Under this requirement, expert testimony is unreliable if it is not grounded in the methods\n\nand procedures of science and is no more than subjective belief or unsupported speculation.\n\nRobinson, 923 S.W.2d at 557. Expert testimony is also unreliable if there is too great an\n\nanalytical gap between the data the expert relies upon and the opinion offered. Gammill, 972\n\nS.W.2d at 727. In applying this reliability standard, however, the trial court does not decide\n\nwhether the expert’s conclusions are correct; rather, the trial court determines whether the\n\nanalysis used to reach those conclusions is reliable. Id. at 728. Although the trial court serves as\n\nan evidentiary gatekeeper by screening out irrelevant and unreliable expert evidence, it has broad\n\ndiscretion to determine the admissibility of evidence. Zwahr, 88 S.W.3d at 629. Accordingly,\n\nwe review the trial court’s decision to admit Boutin’s testimony for an abuse of discretion. See\n\nGammill, 972 S.W.2d at 718-19; Robinson, 923 S.W.2d at 558.\n\n       Boutin, an independent insurance adjuster, testified he adopted Barton’s report as his\n\nestimate of the cost to repair the damage to the Cantus’ home that was caused by the hailstorm.\n\nHe stated the manner in which the Barton report was prepared was no different from any\n\nestimate he would have prepared for an insurance company. Boutin said that if he had been\n\nasked by the Cantus to prepare the report, his investigation would have been the same as\n\nBarton’s.   Boutin explained that the software used to prepare the Barton report is called\n\nExactimate and is accepted by most insurance companies. Exactimate has a large database for\n\nmaterials and labor for specific geographic areas, and he has used Exactimate for seven years.\n\nBoutin spoke with Mr. Cantu, who provided him with an overview of the damage sustained\n\nduring the storm. Boutin spent approximately ninety minutes at the house, and with the Barton\n\nreport in hand, he went inside the house, room-by-room, to take measurements. He also took\n\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\f                                                                                    04-09-00705-CV\n\n\nmeasurements outside, including on the roof. He said he independently verified the damage to\n\nthe house as represented in the Barton report. He saw no damage to the house other than the\n\ndamage caused by the hailstorm. He was aware the Cantus had already made some exterior\n\nrepairs to the house, but he did not know if any interior repairs had been made.\n\n       Barton prepared his report in June 2006, and Boutin went to the Cantu home for the first\n\ntime in January 2009. Boutin said his ability to adopt Barton’s estimate or his ability to prepare\n\nhis own report would not have been affected by his not going to the house until 2009. When\n\nasked why, he responded that “In the past I’ve been asked to adopt other estimates with\n\ninsurance companies doing inspection[s], and it’s much the same process. You go out and do the\n\nmeasurements and it was virtually the same process.” When asked to explain a repair estimate of\n\n$65,000 on a home insured for only $42,000, Boutin stated that the amount of work that must be\n\ndone to repair damage to the house has nothing to do with the amount for which the house is\n\ninsured.   Boutin said one of the reasons this happens is because the cost of any required\n\ndemolition work, such as removal of debris, may account for up to fifty percent of the value of\n\nthe repair work. The Barton report calls for replacing the fascia boards, siding, and insulation on\n\nthe outside of the house, as well as replacing everything related to the roof. Although Mr. Cantu\n\nsaid that hail damaged only two sides of the house, Boutin agreed with Barton that all four sides\n\nshould be replaced because “it’s an industry standard that if 50 percent or more is damaged, you\n\nreplace all of the siding” to ensure the siding matched on all four sides of the house, and he\n\nfollowed this rule when he worked for insurance companies. He said the same rule applied to\n\nroof damage. When asked why he would estimate repair work to the outside of the house even\n\nthough Mr. Cantu had already done some of the exterior repairs, Boutin replied that an estimate\n\nis based on an assumption that no repair work has been done.\n\n\n\n                                               -5-\n\f                                                                                      04-09-00705-CV\n\n\n       As to the interior of the house, the report calls for extensive repair work in almost every\n\nroom throughout the house—such as replacing ceiling insulation, removing kitchen cabinets,\n\nreplacing dry wall, and replacing and removing electric outlets—because all those areas were\n\ndamaged by the storm. When asked how he knew these areas had been damaged by the storm,\n\nBoutin replied, “It’s consistent with damage that I’ve seen in the past.” He said he saw the\n\ninterior damage when he inspected the Cantus’ house. He also said the fifty percent rule did not\n\nnecessarily apply to interior work. When asked why all the interior work was needed, Boutin\n\nstated, “Because when the ceilings are damaged, to take the ceiling down, you are going to\n\ndamage the walls as you remove them.” From his inspection, he knew there would be ceiling\n\ndamage from roof leaks. As to why all the kitchen cabinets had to be replaced when there was\n\nno evidence water had gotten into the cabinets, Boutin explained that in the process of removing\n\nthe cabinets to replace drywall, they could be damaged.\n\n       Boutin said he had no problem with the insurance company applying a fifty percent\n\ndepreciation on the material to replace the Cantus’ roof because fifty percent is an industry\n\nstandard. He explained that the amount of depreciation on a roof is more than on materials for\n\nother parts of the house, such as siding, because a roof does not last as long. However, he\n\nbelieved the amount Southland paid to the Cantus would replace only part of the roof. Although\n\nthe Arnold estimate prepared for Southland applied depreciation to both labor and materials,\n\nBoutin said that in the thousands of times he has applied depreciation, he has never taken\n\ndepreciation on labor because labor is not a “material” that loses value over time.\n\n       On cross-examination, Boutin admitted he had not seen the Southland insurance policy\n\nissued to the Cantus. However, Boutin said he did not intend to opine on whether the damages\n\nwere covered by the terms of the policy; instead, he intended to opine about the cost to repair the\n\n\n\n                                                -6-\n\f                                                                                   04-09-00705-CV\n\n\ndamage caused by the hailstorm. As to Barton’s report, Boutin said he never spoke to Barton\n\nabout the report. Boutin acknowledged that the storm damage occurred in 2004, but Barton’s\n\nreport was not prepared until 2006. Boutin was not aware of anyone adjusting the Exactimate\n\n2006 cost estimate to reflect 2004 numbers. However, he did not believe there was a significant\n\ndifference in cost between 2004 and 2006. The estimate called for the existing roof to be\n\nreplaced with a twenty-five-year composition shingle roof, but Boutin did not know whether the\n\noriginal roof had twenty-year or twenty-five-year shingles. He conceded that replacing a twenty-\n\nyear shingle roof with a twenty-five-year shingle roof would place the owner in a better position\n\nthan he was in before the storm. He did not know what portion of the roof or roof decking\n\nneeded to be replaced. He did not know the pre-storm quality of the fascia and whether it was\n\nthe same as the quality of fascia called for in the report. He did not know the size of the air\n\nconditioner before the storm, although the Barton report included a large unit. The report called\n\nfor insulation in the walls, although Boutin did not know if the walls were insulated prior to the\n\nstorm. And if there was pre-existing insulation, he did not know whether it had gotten wet and,\n\ntherefore, needed to be replaced. However, he said he did not need to check the insulation\n\nbecause he knew the dry wall and almost the entire ceiling throughout the house were wet and,\n\ntherefore, the insulation was wet. On redirect, Boutin stated he saw water damage from the\n\nhailstorm to the ceiling, walls, and floor of the house.\n\n       Boutin was called as an expert to opine only on the estimated cost to repair any damage\n\nto the Cantus’ home caused by the hailstorm. For that purpose, we conclude he was required\n\nonly to determine what damage was attributable to hail and it was not necessary for him to (1)\n\nreview the policy; (2) opine on whether the damage was covered by the terms of the policy; or\n\n(3) determine whether any of the losses were “covered losses” under the policy.

Finally, we conclude Southland’s argument that Boutin did not verify\n\nwhether the items listed as damages in Barton’s report were actually damaged goes to the weight\n\nof the evidence and not its relevance or reliability.\n\n2.     “Parroting” the Opinion of Another Expert\n\n       As an expert, Boutin was permitted to testify as to relevant matters about which he had\n\npersonal knowledge, TEX.

Boutin was also\n\nauthorized to rely on facts or data contained in the Barton report in forming his own opinion as to\n\nthe evidence examined, regardless of the admissibility of such facts or data.\n\n       On appeal, Southland argues Boutin’s testimony lacked relevance and reliability because\n\nhe merely adopted Bob Barton’s report. Southland argues that federal rules of evidence similar\n\nto Texas Rule of Evidence 703 “do not extend so far as to allow experts to simply parrot or recite\n\nthe opinions of other experts, as Boutin did here.” Southland relies on several federal cases for\n\nthe proposition that “experts are permitted to rely on opinions of other experts to the extent that\n\nthey are of the type that would be reasonably relied upon by other experts in the field.” See\n\nMalletier v.

The court first noted that\n\nan expert is “permitted to testify to an opinion formed on the basis of information that is handed\n\nto rather than developed by him—information of which he lacks first-hand knowledge and which\n\nmight not be admissible in evidence no matter by whom presented.” Id. at 172. “But the judge\n\nmust make sure that the expert isn’t being used as a vehicle for circumventing the rules of\n\nevidence.” Id. at 173. “The fact that inadmissible evidence is the (permissible) premise of the\n\nexpert’s opinion does not make that evidence admissible for other purposes, purposes\n\nindependent of the opinion.” Id.

Barton’s\n\nprofessional judgment was within Boutin’s knowledge—they are both experienced insurance\n\nadjusters and Boutin is familiar with and has used the Exactimate software used by Barton to\n\nprepare his report. Boutin’s qualifications as an insurance adjuster are undisputed. He stated the\n\nmanner in which the Barton estimate was prepared was no different from any estimate he would\n\nhave prepared for an insurance company. Boutin has adjusted approximately forty claims with\n\nBarton, and he said that if he had been asked by the Cantus to prepare the report, his\n\ninvestigation would have been the same as Barton’s.         Boutin spoke with Mr. Cantu, who\n\nprovided him with an overview of the damages sustained during the storm, and he independently\n\ninspected and verified the damage to the house as represented in the Barton report.

According to the Giles Court, the\n\n“‘reasonably clear’ standard recasts the liability standard in positive terms, rather than the current\n\nnegative formulation. Under this standard, an insurer will be liable if the insurer knew or should\n\nhave known that it was reasonably clear that the claim was covered.” Id. at 56. The Giles Court\n\nalso noted that an insurer cannot escape liability merely by failing to investigate a claim so that it\n\ncan contend liability was never reasonably clear. Id. at n.5. Instead, the Court reaffirmed that an\n\ninsurance company may also breach its duty of good faith and fair dealing by failing to\n\nreasonably investigate a claim. Id. Whether an insurer acted in bad faith because it failed to\n\nattempt in good faith to effectuate a prompt, fair, and equitable settlement of a claim after its\n\nliability became reasonably clear is a question for the factfinder. Id. at 56.\n\n       In this case, the trial court submitted the case under the “reasonably clear” standard by\n\nasking whether Southland engaged in unfair or deceptive acts or practices by failing to attempt in\n\ngood faith to effectuate a prompt, fair, and equitable settlement of a claim when the insurer’s\n\nliability had become reasonably clear. The trial court also submitted the case under the standard\n\nset forth in the Insurance Code by asking whether Southland (1) refused to pay a claim without\n\nconducting a reasonable investigation of the claim based on all available information, or (2)\n\ncompelled the Cantus to institute a lawsuit to recover amounts due under their policy by\n\noffering substantially less than the amounts ultimately recovered.

The Cantus\n\ncontend Arnold spent only about forty-five minutes at the house, he did not document in his\n\nreport all the damage they allege was caused by the storm, and he took an inappropriate amount\n\nof depreciation. Although Arnold disputed Mr. Cantu’s estimate of the length of time he spent at\n\nthe house, it was for the jury to decide whose testimony to accept on this question. There is no\n\ndispute that Arnold did not photograph all the damage in the house. However, Arnold testified\n\nhe documents only damage that results from a covered loss, and Hignight agreed it would not be\n\npossible for adjusters to document every single damaged item in a structure without regard to\n\nwhether the damage resulted from a covered loss. For example, Arnold photographed one stain\n\non the ceiling but not a second stain because the Cantus told him the second stain pre-existed the\n\n\n\n                                              - 16 -\n\f                                                                                     04-09-00705-CV\n\n\nhailstorm. The Cantus denied this, and testified both ceiling stains appeared after the storm. The\n\nCantus rely on Barton’s report to allege there was water and hail damage throughout the house to\n\na greater extent than that documented in Arnold’s report. Again, the jury was free to credit the\n\nCantus’ testimony and Barton’s report over that of Arnold. However, to establish bad faith,\n\nrather than a mere breach of contract, the Cantus were required to show more than a “simple\n\ndisagreement among experts about whether the cause of loss is one covered by the policy . . . .”\n\nMoriel, 879 S.W.2d at 18.

Mr. Cantu conceded he had\n\nconversations with both men about the extent of the damage. Southland received two estimates\n\nbefore the lawsuit was filed: one from Arnold in the amount of $4,390.50 that included damage\n\nto both the inside and outside of the house, and one from Stites in the amount of $6,855.66 that\n\nincluded damage only to the outside of the house.

Regardless of the reasons for the\n\ndisagreement amongst the three adjusters, the fact remains that they disagreed and provided\n\nSouthland with three widely varying estimates.

(mem. op.). “Similarly, evidence that the scope of\n\nrepairs in [Arnold’s] report ‘does not come close to matching’ [Barton’s] report is not evidence\n\nof unreasonableness.” Id. Therefore, we also look to Southland’s actions with regard to the\n\ndiffering reports and whether Stites’s pre-lawsuit estimate of damage cast doubt on the reliability\n\nof Arnold’s estimate of damage.\n\n       Roy Hignight first received the claim on April 5, 2004, the day after the storm. The next\n\nday, Hignight informed the Cantus by letter that Southland had received their claim and an\n\nadjuster would contact them. The letter provided the Cantus with Robert Arnold’s name and\n\ntelephone number. Although Mr. Cantu testified he did not remember receiving the letter,\n\nHignight testified the letter was mailed to the Cantus and was never returned to Southland as not\n\ndelivered. Arnold arrived at the house about seven days after the storm. Arnold’s estimate for\n\ntotal loss amounted to $4,390.50, less depreciation of $1,933.65 and the deductible of $420, for a\n\nnet claim amount of $2,036.85.\n\n       Hignight testified that when he reviewed Arnold’s report, he saw nothing wrong with it,\n\nexcept he did not believe the spot on the ceiling needed to be repaired. However, because\n\nArnold’s estimate allowed for the cost of repair, Hignight did not contest the repair estimate, and\n\nhe paid the claim in the amount recommended by Arnold. By letter dated April 27, 2004,\n\nHignight enclosed a copy of Arnold’s estimate and informed the Cantus that a claim check in the\n\namount of $2,036.85 would be mailed to their agent within seven working days. Hignight said\n\nthat the check was cashed and he never heard from the Cantus or SAS-Lowery until he received\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 18 -\n\f                                                                                                04-09-00705-CV\n\n\na June 17, 2004 letter purportedly4 signed by the Cantus. In this letter, the Cantus expressly\n\nauthorized Ortiz and/or Stites to act on their behalf with respect to the claim and appointed Ortiz\n\nand/or Stites as their agent to meet with Southland, its employees, and adjustors “to discuss this\n\nloss and work toward a mutually satisfactory settlement of this claim.” The Cantus reserved to\n\nthemselves the right to enter into a final settlement of the claim, but asked that Joe A. Ortiz,\n\nBuilding Consultant, be named as a co-payee on any drafts or checks. The letter ended by\n\nstating that “[i]n the unlikely event that the services of an attorney become necessary, [the\n\nCantus ] will provide you with the name of [their] attorney.” Hignight believed the letter meant\n\nthe Cantus wanted him to work directly with Ortiz or Stites as their agent. When Hignight\n\nreceived the letter, he forwarded a copy to Arnold. On July 9, 2004, Hignight received a copy of\n\na June 16, 2004 estimate prepared by Stites for Joatmon Loss Services, Inc., which estimated the\n\ncost of repairs at $6,855.66. Hignight sent Arnold a copy of the estimate and asked Arnold to\n\ncontact Stites and ask for an explanation as to why the unit costs were so high and to see if they\n\ncould work things out. The next day, Arnold faxed a copy of the Stites estimate to both Hignight\n\nand Stites with Arnold’s handwritten notes on various line items in the estimate. Arnold also\n\nfaxed a copy of his own estimate to Stites.               On the fax coversheet to Hignight, Arnold\n\ncharacterized the Stites estimate as “excessive” and he stated he was awaiting Stites’ response.\n\nOn the fax coversheet to Stites, Arnold wrote as follows:\n\n        We have recvd & revwd your repair bid for the above referenced insured. (your\n        estimate attached) We found your estimate to be very high, much above industry\n        standard for unit costs. We are faxing you our repair estimate to review and go\n        by.\n               Please call me or fax me your reply.\n\n\n4\n  Mr. Cantu testified he and his wife hired Ortiz after a community meeting, but he claimed he and his wife only\nsigned a blank sheet of paper. The letter has the Cantus’ names and address in the letterhead and is addressed to\nSAS-Lowery Insurance Agency, which forwarded the letter to Hignight.\n\n\n                                                     - 19 -\n\f                                                                                  04-09-00705-CV\n\n\nSouthland was not aware of the Cantus’ dissatisfaction with Ortiz and neither Arnold nor\n\nHignight received a response from Stites, Ortiz, or anyone at Joatmon.\n\n       The Stites estimate, which did not account for depreciation or the Cantus’ deductible,\n\ncalled for replacing the roof, painting the exterior fascia, and final cleanup for a total of\n\n$6,855.66, compared to Arnold’s pre-depreciation/deductible estimate of $4,390.50. Hignight\n\nexplained his interpretation of the Stites estimate as follows:\n\n       It showed me that it was the same scope as Bobby Arnold’s estimate.\n\n                                              ...\n\n               Well, the areas that Marcus Stites allowed for was [sic] the same areas\n       Bobby Arnold allowed for, with the exception that Bobby Arnold allowed for\n       interior damage and repairs to the air conditioning and windows and which\n       Marcus Stites did not allow that.\n\n                                              ...\n\n              I interpreted [Stites’ not allowing for interior damage] as that Mr. Stites\n       did not have any issues with the interior allowance made by Mr. Arnold; that his\n       concern was on the — on the roof and other exterior items that Bobby Arnold\n       allowed for.\n\n\nWhen asked why Stites’s estimate was almost $2,000 more than the Arnold estimate, Hignight\n\nresponded that some of the items on Stites’s report appeared “to be extremely high.”\n\n       The next and last time Hignight heard anything about the Cantus’ claim was December\n\n20, 2004 when Arnold faxed to him a letter signed by the Cantus and mailed to Arnold. In the\n\nletter, which was dated October 12, 2004 but not received by Arnold until December 20, 2004,\n\nthe Cantus “invoke[d] the appraisal process” because they believed “the funds that Colonial\n\nLloyds Insurance Company estimated to repair [their] house are not sufficient.”        Hignight\n\ntestified that Southland and Colonial Lloyds Insurance Company are not the same company.\n\nHignight also said that language in the letter that referenced the appraisal process was not\n\n                                                - 20 -\n\f                                                                                        04-09-00705-CV\n\n\nlanguage contained in the policy Southland issued to the Cantus. Hignight thought the Cantus\n\nwere referencing an entirely different policy on other property they owned. However, Hignight\n\nconceded that the policy number referenced in the letter was the Cantus’ Southland policy and\n\nthe claim number referenced the hailstorm claim. He admitted that despite his confusion he did\n\nnot attempt to contact the Cantus or anyone working on their behalf.\n\n           Hignight said that until the Cantus sued in November 2005, he knew only of the Stites\n\nestimate, which was a couple of thousand dollars more than the Arnold estimate. In mid-\n\nNovember 2005, Hignight received the Cantus’ petition in which they alleged they “sustained\n\ncovered losses in the form of accidental plumbing or air condition leaks and discharges, water\n\ndamage, and damage resulting therefrom including damage to the architectural finishes of the\n\nhome . . . .” The petition did not specifically mention the April 2004 hailstorm, nor did the\n\npetition complain specifically about the manner in which Southland handled the hailstorm claim.\n\nUpon receiving the petition, Hignight contacted the Cantus’ insurance agent at SAS-Lowery,\n\nOlga Lopez, because Southland had never heard of a problem with the accidental discharge of\n\nwater, and Lopez informed him SAS-Lowery had received a hand-written letter dated October 3,\n\n2005 from the Cantus asserting additional water damage. 5 Hignight asked Lopez why the\n\nOctober 3 letter had not been immediately sent to Southland, and Lopez said she did not know\n\nwhat the letter was in reference to. Hignight said he finally realized the lawsuit was filed in\n\nconnection with the hailstorm when he received a copy of the Barton estimate in October 2006,\n\nalmost one year after the lawsuit was filed. Hignight characterized the Barton estimate as\n\n“excessive” because “[v]irtually every surface area on the house is damaged to include decking,\n\nflooring, interior walls, kitchen cabinetry, bathrooms, bedrooms, exterior siding, everything on\n\nthe house is claimed to be damaged in this scope.”\n5\n    Mr. Cantu testified the letter was hand-written for him at his attorney’s office.\n\n                                                            - 21 -\n\f                                                                                    04-09-00705-CV\n\n\n         Southland paid considerably less than what the Cantus believed their losses to be;\n\nhowever, the evidence shows the Cantus cashed Southland’s check without complaint. Two\n\nmonths later, Southland received a letter in which the Cantus authorized Ortiz and/or Stites to act\n\non their behalf, and appointed Ortiz and/or Stites to meet with Southland’s adjusters and\n\nemployees to discuss the loss “and work toward a mutually satisfactory settlement of” their\n\nclaim.    Although Mr. Cantu testified he later became dissatisfied with Ortiz, he never\n\ncommunicated this dissatisfaction to either Southland or Arnold. Therefore, acting in accordance\n\nwith the terms of the letter, Southland attempted to communicate only with Stites. When\n\nSouthland received Stites’s estimate and attempted to contact Stites regarding his estimate,\n\nSouthland never received a response.\n\n         The fact of liability for damage caused by the hailstorm was clear, and Southland\n\npromptly issued a check to cover repairs for storm damage as determined by its adjuster.\n\nPursuant to the terms of the insurance contract, Southland was not liable for normal wear and\n\ntear. The question, thus, became a coverage dispute: whether all of the damage alleged by the\n\nCantus was the result of the hailstorm, and if caused by the storm, the extent of repair versus\n\nreplacement necessary to put the Cantus back into the position they were in before the storm.\n\nLiability as to this question was not reasonably clear at the time Southland paid the claim and\n\nwas ultimately decided by the jury in this case. Therefore, we conclude there is no evidence that\n\nSouthland’s reliance on Arnold’s report was unreasonable, nor is there any other evidence from\n\nwhich a factfinder could infer that Southland failed to attempt in good faith to effectuate a\n\nprompt, fair, and equitable settlement when its liability had become reasonably clear or that\n\nSouthland failed to conduct a reasonable investigation based on all available information. For\n\nthese same reasons, we also conclude there is no evidence the Cantus were compelled to institute\n\n\n\n                                               - 22 -\n\f                                                                                                    04-09-00705-CV\n\n\na lawsuit to recover amounts due under their policy because Southland offered substantially less\n\nthan the amounts ultimately recovered.               Accordingly, we conclude the evidence is legally\n\ninsufficient to support a finding on bad faith. 6\n\n                                         BREACH OF CONTRACT\n\n         The jury awarded the Cantus $30,000 as compensation for Southland’s failure to pay for\n\ncovered physical loss to their home. In its third issue, Southland contends the Cantus are not\n\nentitled to recover on their breach of contract claim because they failed to segregate what was a\n\n“covered loss” under the policy from what was not a “covered loss” in Barton’s report.\n\n         The premise of Southland’s argument, with which we agree, is that an insured is entitled\n\nto recover only that portion of the damage caused solely by a covered peril. See Wallis v. United\n\nServs. Auto. Assoc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1509289\"><a href=\"/opinion/1509289/wallis-v-united-services-auto-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 302-03 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1999, pet. denied).\n\nHowever, Wallis and the other opinions upon which Southland relies all involved cases in which\n\nthe jury was asked to allocate damage attributable to a peril specifically covered under the\n\ninsurance policy versus damage attributable to a peril specifically excluded under the policy. For\n\nexample, in Wallis, USAA determined the foundation damage to the insureds’ house was caused\n\nby a combination of several excluded perils, including settlement, poor surface drainage, the\n\ntopography of the lot, and surrounding vegetation. Id. at 301-02. Plumbing leaks, which were\n\ncovered perils under the policy, were also detected; however, based on soil testing and continued\n\nearth settlement following repair of the insureds’ plumbing system, USAA concluded the leaks\n\nwere negligible and had not caused or contributed to the complained-of damage.                               USAA\n\nbelieved improper compaction of the fill dirt upon which the insureds’ foundation rested was the\n\nprimary source of the problem. Experts for the insureds did not refute USAA’s evidence\n\n\n6\n We, therefore, do not reach the issue of whether there is evidence to support the jury’s finding that Southland acted\nwith “actual awareness of the falsity, deception, or unfairness of the conduct in question.”\n\n                                                        - 23 -\n\f                                                                                   04-09-00705-CV\n\n\nregarding the excluded perils. They did, however, challenge the conclusion drawn regarding the\n\neffect of the plumbing leaks, and claimed instead that the leaks could not be excluded as a\n\ncontributing cause of the damage. Id. at 302.\n\n       At trial, the jury was asked to determine whether perils excluded under the policy caused\n\nthe damage.    The jury was also charged with determining whether “accidental discharge,\n\nleakage, or overflow of water from within a plumbing system” contributed to the damage. The\n\njury answered both questions affirmatively and found that thirty-five percent of the damage was\n\ncaused by plumbing leaks. In its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, USAA\n\nasserted its entitlement to judgment on several grounds, including that even if damage caused by\n\na plumbing leak is covered, the insureds failed to produce any evidence to demonstrate what\n\nportion of the loss was caused solely by the plumbing leak. The trial court disregarded the jury’s\n\nanswer to question two, granted USAA’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and\n\nentered a take-nothing judgment in favor of USAA.\n\n       On appeal, a panel of this court concluded the record contained evidence from which the\n\njury could conclude that plumbing leaks had contributed to the loss. Id. at 303. However, the\n\ninsureds’ engineers could not indicate the extent to which this peril damaged the home, and this\n\nwas “fatal” to the insureds’ claim. Id. at 304. This court held there was no basis from which the\n\njury could reasonably infer that thirty-five percent of the damage was caused by the plumbing\n\nleaks. Id. “The jury heard no testimony regarding how much of the . . . damage was caused by\n\nthe plumbing leaks. It learned only that plumbing leaks were found.” Id. Because there was no\n\nevidence upon which the jury could determine that thirty-five percent of the damage was caused\n\nby plumbing leaks, this court concluded the trial court properly granted a take-nothing judgment\n\nin favor of USAA.\n\n\n\n                                                - 24 -\n\f                                                                                      04-09-00705-CV\n\n\n        Here, there was no dispute that damage from a hailstorm was a covered peril and the jury\n\nwas not presented with other possible excluded perils. Instead, in this case, the only dispute was\n\nthe extent of the damage caused by the covered peril, and the evidence went beyond merely\n\ninforming the jury that hail damage was “found.” Unlike in Wallis, the jury heard testimony\n\nregarding how much of the Cantus’ damage was caused by the hailstorm: the Barton report\n\nitemized the damage and the Cantus and Boutin testified that all of the itemized damage was\n\ncaused by hail. Southland’s expert claimed some of the damage he saw—when he went to the\n\nhouse two years after the hailstorm—was caused by “chronic water damage” such as from air\n\nconditioning condensation drainage or the use of water sprinklers. Therefore, unlike in Wallis,\n\nthe jury here was not required to guess what percentage of the damage was caused by the\n\nhailstorm; instead, the jury was faced with a credibility question: the Cantus claimed all the\n\ndamage itemized in Barton’s report was due to hail, while Southland claimed some of the\n\ndamage was caused by ordinary wear and tear. The jury apparently believed the Cantus and their\n\nexpert, and we defer to that determination. Accordingly, we overrule Southland’s third issue.\n\n                                        ATTORNEY’S FEES\n\n        In its fifth issue, Southland asserts the award of attorney’s fees should be reversed for the\n\nfollowing reasons: (1) there is no recovery for breach of contract or violation of the Insurance\n\nCode, and (2) the Cantus failed to make a pretrial disclosure of the manner of calculation of the\n\nfees in response to a request for disclosure.           Because we overrule Southland’s complaint\n\nregarding the Cantus’ breach of contract claim, the Cantus are entitled to attorney’s fees. See\n\nTEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 38.001(8) (West 2008) (“A person may recover\n\nreasonable attorney’s fees from an individual or corporation, in addition to the amount of a valid\n\nclaim and costs, if the claim is for . . . an oral or written contract.”).\n\n\n\n                                                   - 25 -\n\f                                                                                    04-09-00705-CV\n\n\n       As to Southland’s second argument, SAS-Lowery’s pretrial request for disclosure asked\n\nthe Cantus for “the amount and any method of calculating economic damages.” See TEX. R. CIV.\n\nP. 194.2(d) (“A party may request disclosure of . . . the amount and any method of calculating\n\neconomic damages.”). In response, the Cantus stated they would “be seeking the following\n\ndamages”: (1) actual damages, (2) compensatory damages, (3) mental anguish, (4) attorney’s\n\nfees, and (5) punitive, exemplary, and/or treble damages. In response to a question regarding the\n\nidentity of any testifying expert, the Cantus stated they might call Matthew Pearson or Marc\n\nGravely, who would “testify about the reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees incurred by [the\n\nCantus] in prosecuting this action. [The Cantus’] counsel does not keep detailed billing records\n\nfor contingent fee cases but generally charges [sic] $250.00 an hour for insurance cases of this\n\ntype.” On appeal, Southland contends that despite its Rule 194.2(d) request, prior to trial the\n\nCantus never disclosed any amount of attorney’s fees accrued or gave any means by which the\n\nfees would be calculated. Southland argues that because the Cantus failed “to make, amend, or\n\nsupplement a discovery response in a timely manner [they] may not introduce in evidence the\n\nmaterial or information that was not timely disclosed, or offer the testimony of a witness (other\n\nthan a named party) who was not timely identified . . . .” See TEX. R. CIV. P. 193.6(a).\n\n       We disagree with Southland. The Cantus’ response to the discovery request identified\n\nthe attorneys and stated that the attorneys did not track their hours in contingent fees cases, but\n\nfor insurance cases such as the one here charged $250 per hour. Under the circumstances of this\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 26 -\n\f                                                                                                04-09-00705-CV\n\n\ncase, we conclude this response was sufficient. 7 Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion by allowing the Cantus’ attorney to testify about his fees.\n\n                                MOTION TO COMPEL APPRAISAL\n\n        After the lawsuit was filed, Southland asked the Cantus to submit to an appraisal process\n\nto determine the amount of damage that occurred in the hailstorm. The Cantus did not respond\n\nand Southland filed a motion to compel, which the trial court denied after a hearing. At trial, the\n\ncourt excluded evidence offered by Southland of the Cantus’ alleged refusal to participate in the\n\nappraisal process. In its sixth issue, Southland asserts the trial court erred by denying the motion\n\nfor an appraisal and excluding the evidence at trial.\n\n        Appraisal provisions are included in most property insurance policies and are\n\nenforceable.

Therefore, we must determine whether the trial court correctly applied the law to\n\nthese undisputed facts.\n\n       In a letter dated October 12, 2004 but not received by Southland until December 20,\n\n2004, the Cantus “invoke[d] the appraisal process” because they believed “the funds that\n\nColonial Lloyds Insurance Company estimated to repair [their] house are not sufficient.”\n\nHignight testified that Southland and Colonial Lloyds Insurance Company are not the same\n\ncompany and language in the letter that referenced the appraisal process was not language\n\ncontained in the policy Southland issued to the Cantus. The letter ends with this sentence:\n\n“Please forward this information to the individual you choose to represent Southland Lloyds\n\nInsurance Company in this appraisal.”\n\n       The Southland appraisal provision, and the language quoted in the October 2004 letter are\n\nidentical in all but two respects. The first sentence of the Southland provision states: “If you and\n\nwe fail to agree on the actual cash value, amount of loss, or the cost of repair, either can make a\n\nwritten demand for appraisal.” The first sentence contained in the letter states: “If you and we\n\nfail to agree on the actual cash value, amount of loss, or the cost of repair or replacement, either\n\ncan make a written demand for appraisal” (emphasis added).           The letter also contains the\n\nfollowing additional language not contained in the Southland provision:\n\n       If you or we request that they do so, the appraisers will also set:\n       a) the full replacement cost of the dwelling\n       b) the full replacement cost of any other building upon which loss is claimed\n       c) the full cost of repair or replacement of loss to such building without deduction\n       for depreciation.\n\n       Southland never responded to the Cantus’ letter. The Cantus filed suit almost one year\n\nlater, on November 7, 2005. On April 9, 2007, Southland filed its motion to compel the\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 28 -\n\f                                                                                                      04-09-00705-CV\n\n\nappraisal process, which was denied after a hearing.

App.—\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2010, orig. proceeding). Here, Southland received a copy of the letter in\n\nwhich the Cantus invoked the appraisal process on December 20, 2004.                               Southland never\n\nresponded to this letter. The Cantus filed suit on November 7, 2005. Following this date,\n\nSouthland waited another sixteen months to file its motion, which was almost two and one-half\n\nyears after the Cantus’ letter invoking the appraisal process. 8 For these reasons, we conclude the\n\ntrial court did not err in denying Southland’s motion for an appraisal. 9\n\n                                BROAD-FORM DAMAGES QUESTION\n\n         In question number two, the jury was asked what sum of money would compensate the\n\nCantus for damages to their home resulting from Southland’s failure to pay for covered physical\n\nloss. The jury awarded $30,000. In its seventh and last issue, Southland contends this broad\n\nform question was error. Southland contends the jury’s answer could have been based on\n\n\n8\n  We agree with Southland that it did not waive any error on the trial court’s part by not filing a petition for writ of\nmandamus. However, Southland’s not pursuing relief by mandamus is relevant to the issue of whether it waived its\nright to appraisal. The Slavonic court held that the insurance company had no adequate remedy by appeal because\ndenying the right to an appraisal denied the insurance company “the development of proof going to the heart of its\ncase . . . .” Id. at 564. Here, Southland did not file a petition for writ of mandamus, but instead continued with\ndiscovery and went to trial.\n9\n Because we conclude the trial court did not err in denying Southland’s motion for an appraisal, we do not address\nSouthland’s related complaint that the court erred by not allowing into evidence the Cantus’ alleged refusal to\nparticipate in the appraisal process.\n\n\n                                                         - 29 -\n\f                                                                                     04-09-00705-CV\n\n\nevidence that did not qualify as a covered loss, such as replacing all the drywall in a room\n\nbecause there was a water stain on the ceiling, or replacing all the siding when only two sides of\n\nthe house were damaged. Southland asserts that without separate answer blanks as to each type\n\nof repair that the jury found amounted to a total of $30,000, it is impossible to tell what “losses”\n\nthe jury included within the $30,000. Therefore, Southland concludes that under Crown Life Ins.\n\nv. Casteel, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1376467\"><a href=\"/opinion/1376467/crown-life-ins-co-v-casteel/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 2000), it is deprived of any meaningful appellate review.\n\n       In Casteel, the trial court submitted a single broad-form question on the issue of Crown’s\n\nliability to Casteel. The question requested a single answer on Crown’s liability, which the jury\n\nanswered affirmatively. Id. at 387. The Supreme Court concluded the trial court erred in\n\nsubmitting four of the five DTPA grounds for liability because the plaintiff did not have standing\n\nto bring those claims. Id. at 387-88. The Supreme Court held: “When a single broad-form\n\nliability question erroneously commingles valid and invalid liability theories and the appellant’s\n\nobjection is timely and specific, the error is harmful when it cannot be determined whether the\n\nimproperly submitted theories formed the sole basis for the jury’s finding.”            Id. at 389.\n\nRecognizing that broad-form submission should be used when feasible, the Court explained that\n\ngranulated submission should be used when a liability theory is uncertain. Id. at 390. The\n\nSupreme Court later extended the Casteel holding to broad-form questions that commingle\n\ndamage elements when an element is unsupported by legally sufficient evidence. See Harris\n\nCounty v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1377553\"><a href=\"/opinion/1377553/harris-county-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 235 (Tex. 2002). In that case, as to awarding damages to one\n\nplaintiff, the jury considered (a) physical pain and mental anguish, (b) loss of earning capacity,\n\n(c) physical impairment, and (d) medical care. Id. at 231. As to the other plaintiff’s potential\n\ndamages, the jury could consider (a) physical pain and mental anguish, (b) physical impairment,\n\nand (c) medical care. Id. at 232. The defendant objected to both questions, asked that the trial\n\n\n\n                                               - 30 -\n\f                                                                                 04-09-00705-CV\n\n\ncourt submit each damage element separately, and complained there was no evidence of loss of\n\nearning capacity as to the first plaintiff and no evidence of any physical impairment as to the\n\nsecond plaintiff.   The Supreme Court concluded the trial court erred in overruling Harris\n\nCounty’s objection to the charge, “which mixed valid and invalid elements of damages in a\n\nsingle broad-form submission, and that such error was harmful because it prevented the appellate\n\ncourt from determining ‘whether the jury based its verdict on an improperly submitted invalid\n\nelement of damage.’” Id. at 234.\n\n       We do not believe Casteel and Harris County apply here because the court’s charge did\n\nnot contain a broad-form damage question that commingled multiple damage elements or\n\ntheories of recovery. Instead, we believe the analysis in Matbon, Inc. v. Gries, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1632667\"><a href=\"/opinion/1632667/matbon-inc-v-gries/\"><span class=\"volume\">288</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(Tex. App.—Eastland 2009, no pet.) applies. In that case, the plaintiffs sought future medical\n\ndamages. At trial, the court admitted into evidence an expert’s testimony that the plaintiffs\n\nwould need a new home and the services of a financial advisor. The defendants objected that\n\nfuture medical expenses are limited to actual medical expenses, and therefore, the cost of a new\n\nhome and the fees for a financial advisor are not recoverable as future medical expenses. Id. at\n\n483. The Eastland Court of Appeals agreed with the defendants. The court then examined\n\nwhether the error was harmful. Relying on Casteel and Harris County, the plaintiffs asserted the\n\ndefendants waived this contention because they did not ask the trial court to include in the\n\ncourt’s charge separate damage questions for each of the challenged items of future medical\n\ndamages that the plaintiffs sought. The court of appeals concluded those cases were inapplicable\n\nbecause the court’s charge did not contain a broad-form damage question that commingled\n\nmultiple damage elements. Id. at 484. Because “[a] claim for future medical damages is a\n\nseparate element of damages available to a personal injury claimant,” the court rejected the\n\n\n\n                                             - 31 -\n\f                                                                                    04-09-00705-CV\n\n\nplaintiffs’ contention that the future medical damages question should be broken down into\n\nseparate sub-parts whenever some of the items sought to be recovered as future medical damages\n\nare challenged.” Id.\n\n       Here, this is not a case where the single broad-form question commingled multiple\n\ndamage elements or theories of recovery; for example, compensation for loss to the Cantus’\n\nhome and mental anguish. Instead, the only type of damage submitted was compensation for\n\nphysical damage to the home, which is a separate element of damages available to the Cantus.\n\nThe jury had before it Barton’s estimate, which itemized the damage and the cost to repair each\n\nline item of damage. Therefore, the trial court was not required to list all the various types of\n\nphysical damage the Cantus alleged were caused by the hailstorm.\n\n                                        CONCLUSION\n\n       The Cantus elected to recover under their bad faith claim, rather than their breach of\n\ncontract claim. We conclude the evidence in support of the jury’s bad faith findings is legally\n\ninsufficient; therefore, we reverse the trial court’s judgment on that claim and render a take-\n\nnothing judgment in favor of Southland on the Cantus’ bad faith claim. However, because we\n\noverrule Southland’s issue on the breach of contract claim, we render judgment in the amount of\n\n$30,000 in favor of the Cantus on that claim.           Finally, because we overrule Southland’s\n\nchallenge to the award of attorney’s fees, we render judgment in favor of the Cantus for the\n\namount of fees as stated in the trial court’s judgment. We remand this cause to the trial court for\n\nentry of a judgment that is consistent with this opinion and that includes a re-calculation of the\n\naward of prejudgment interest.\n\n                                                  Sandee Bryan Marion, Justice\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 32 -\n\f</pre>",
