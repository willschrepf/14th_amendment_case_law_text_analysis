The facts necessitating the guardianship are set out in further\n\ndetail in Section VIII below.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\n\n\nPhillips, Lonnie -Application for Temporary Guardian Pending Contest              Page 2 o£6\n\n\n\n                                                                                                    Page 11\n\f                                                v.\n         Applicant states that Lance Ervin Phillips, whose address is 2813 Moore Avenue, Bay\n\nCity, Texas, holds a general power of attorney signed by the Proposed Ward, which Power of\n\nAttorney is attached as \"Exhibit A.\"\n\n                                                VI.\n\n         Applicant requests that the powers granted Lance Ervin Phillips under the power of\n\nattorney be terminated on the qualification of the temporary guardian.\n\n                                               VII.\n\n         Applicant requests that if the Court appoints a Temporary Guardian, it grant him or her\n\nthe powers and authority to represent the Proposed Ward's interests in any pending litigation; to\n\ninitiate additional litigation if necessary to recovery the Proposed Ward's assets or to protect his\n\nassets, property, or well being; to review and any and all documents from his prior attorney for\n\nthe last five years and for any time period for estate or incapacity planning documents; the right\n\nto retain litigation counsel if necessary to adequately act on any of the foregoing requested\n\npowers; the right to collect all the Ward's assets and property, both real and personal, wherever\n\nsituated and by whomsoever held, including to become the payee for any pension, retirement,\n\nSocial Security, or other income, retirement, or public benefit; to order any workmen or repair\n\nwork being done to the Proposed Ward's residence either cease or continue; and to make monthly\n\nexpenditures on the Ward's behalf from the Ward's Estate not to exceed an amount set by the\n\nCourt.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nPhillips, Lonnie -Application for Temporary Guardian Pending Contest                  Page 3 o£6\n\n\n\n                                                                                                       Page 12\n\f                                               VIII.\n\n       Applicant states to the Court that the facts and reasons which support the requested\n\npowers are The Proposed Ward's estate is in imminent danger of irreparable damage due to his\n\nlack of proper representation in the pending lawsuit against Paul Davis Restoration, 405th\n\nJudicial District Court, Galveston County Cause Number 14-CV-0027. In this cause, here is a\n\ndiscrepancy whether the Petitioners are acting pro se or are represented by Ms. Davis: The\n\npleading states it was filed by two children of the Proposed Ward, Ava Phillips and Kevin\n\nCampbell, in an individual capacity and as next friend of the Proposed Ward. This Petition was\n\ndrafted by Ms. Veronica Davis, signed for the Petitioners \"with permission,\" but the Petition\n\nitself lists the Petitioner's as \"pro se.\" The District clerk, however, lists Ms. Veronica Davis as\n\nlead Counsel and Ms. Davis signed the request for service of citation. This litigation was filed\n\nafter the guardianship proceeding was initiated in this court.\n\n       Moreover, The Proposed Ward's assets are being spent by family members and Ms.\n\nVeronica Davis for repairs and materials, ostensibly for the repair of his home which was\n\ndamaged by fire without a proper person to oversee that the expediters actually benefit the\n\nProposed Ward and/or his Estate and that such expenditures are in the best interest of the\n\nProposed Ward.\n\n                                                IX.\n\n       Applicant prays that a hearing on this Application be set; that the Court appoint a proper\n\nperson Temporary Guardian of the Person and Estate of Lonnie Phillips, Jr., an Incapacitated\n\nAdult; that the Court Order appointing Temporary Guardian be effective upon the guardian\n\ntaking the Oath and giving a bond as required by law; that upon the Temporary Guardian's\n\n\nPhillips, Lonnie -Application for Temporary Guardian Pending Contest                Page 4 o£6\n\n\n\n                                                                                                      Page 13\n\fqualification, the Clerk of this Court shall so note such qualification on any certified copy of said\n\nOrder; that the Court appoint an Attorney Ad Litem to represent the Ward's Person and Estate, if\n\nnot already appointed; and that the Court enter any other Orders it deems necessary.\n\n\n\n\n                                             Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n                                             MAGGIORE LAW FIRM PLLC\n                                             1001 TexasAvenue, Suite 1400\n                                             Houston, TX 77002\n\n\n\n\n                                             M.

The parties initially thought that a guardianship\n\nwas necessary to resolve the issues pertaining to allocation of insurance and/or personal funds\n\nfor the benefit of restoration of the home of Lonnie Phillips and how work should proceed on the\n\nhome of lonnie Phillips, Jr. The children of the proposed ward bad a difference of opinion on\n\nhow things should proceed.\n\n       Same is no longer at issue because the initial applicant has abandoned his desire to\n\nproceed as general contractor for the repair of the home which is a part of the proposed ward's\n\nestate. Moreover, work has proceeded on the house and all funds which were previously on\n\nhand for repair, remodel, and rebuild have either been spent or contracts are pending for. Upon\n\ncompletion of the remodel, no funds will remain.\n\n                                               D.\n       The parties did not request nor ever intended for a court to appoint a temporary guardian.\n\n\n                                               -I-\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                   Page 31\n\fNo basis existed for such an appointment. That action was requested by the guardian ad litem,\n\nafter having assured the caretaker Ava Phillips that the parties would set a cowt date. Phillips\n\nfinds the action to be contradictory to the intent of the parties and contrary to the statement A,\n\nattached and incorporated by reference, the same as if fully copied and set fot:th herein.\n\n                                                m.\n       Applicant believes that the appointment of a guardian ad litem and attorney ad litem and\n\ntemporary guardian would serve to delay the rebuilding, repair and restoration of the home and\n\nwould divert funds from the repair process to pay the fees of ad litems, thereby making the home\n\nof Lonnie Phillips uninhabitable and would render the ward unable to return to his home.\n\nMoreover, having to seek approval of the ad litem to complete the work already begun would\n\nonly delay said return. Funds currently on hand are insufficient to complete the restoration of\n\nthe homestead of the ward. Therefore paying of ad litem fees to administer the estate would\n\nrender completion of the home impossible. Attached as Exhibits A & B, are the positions of the\n\napplication and caretaker for the ward, in connection therewith- same being attached and\n\nincorporated by reference, the same as if fully copied and set forth herein.\n\n       The applicant and caretaker bad previously bad concerns regarding whether to proceed\n\nwith the guardianship and did not pay the additional fees, due to the concerns of moving forward\n\nwith same.\n\n                                                IV.\n\n       Applicant further believes that this guardianship was delayed for an inordinate amount of\n\ntime when Davis attempted to work out a hearing date with the former ad litem.

It is necessary and advisable to sell the Estate' s interest in the aforementioned property for\n                     the following reasons:\n                     (a) The real property is currently vacant due to a fire which enabled the house to be\n                          inhabitable;\n                     (b) Family engaged a contractor to repair the home depositing approximately $33,000 of\n                          insurance funds with that contractor. Contractor performed no work, took the funds and\n                          has filed bankruptcy. The real property has been partially renovated but is not livable\n                          and the real property is subject to deterioration and vandalism as it is. The Guardian\n                          has filed claim in the bankruptcy court but it is unlikely that any proceeds will be\n                          returned;\n                     (c) There is approximately $60,000 (which includes funds for reimbursement of personal\n                          belongings) at Hartford Insurance;\n                     (d) Calvary Construction Co., has estimated the remaining repairs at a cost of $80,000 -\n                          $100,000;\n                     (e) The proceeds are needed to pay expenses of the Ward while in an assisted living\n                          facility. He is currently on Medicaid and all expenses for clothes, etc. has been paid\n                          for personally by the Guardian;\n\n\nApplication & Order for Sale of Real Property Under§ 1158.451 of the Estates Code\nIn the Guardianship of Lonnie Phillips, Jr.., an Incapacitated Person\nPage I of3\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                           Page 53\n\f                       (f) Cost to complete renovation is more than the value of the real prope1ty;\n                       (g) It is in the best interest of the Estate to sell the real property \"As Is\"; and\n                       (h) Left vacant the real property poses a liability to the Estate.\n\n            3.         It is the best interest of the Estate for the said property to be sold at a private sale for cash in\n                       as-is condition as the property is liable to perish, waste or deteriorate in value if left vacant\n                       and pose a liability to the Estate.\n\n            Applicant requests that citation be issued to all persons interested in the Estate, as required by law,\n and that, upon consideration or hearing on this Application, the Court enter an Order authorizing Guardian\n to sell the Estate's interest in the aforementioned property at a private sale \"AS IS\" and for cash, and such\n other orders as the Court may deem proper.\n\n                                                                   Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                                                   BY     (}_j);fJJP/fUIZJfl .\n                                                                   Catherine N.

Because the specified methods of service do not exclude any method\n       authorized under the code and therefore do not limit the applicability of the provision, the revised law omits the\n       quoted language as unnecessary.\n\n       (2) Section 632(i), Texas Probate Code, refers to proof of the “time” of mailing of service of citation or notice. The\n       revised law substitutes “date” for “time” for the reason stated in the revisor's note to Section 1051.052.\n\n\nV. T. C.

The revised law substitutes a reference to “this title”\n        for the reference to “this code” because the provisions of the Texas Probate Code that relate to qualification of\n        guardians are revised in Title 3 of this code, and this chapter is included in that title.\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Thompson, the attorney who represented\nof $15,000, and a second in the amount of $10,000—both               plaintiff Niki Koestens *106 in her suit in the trial court\ngranted to Kubosh Bail Bonds, and a notice of lis pendens            against appellees/defendants David Ricardo and Kara K.\nfiled by Koestens. Thompson himself prepared releases for            Peak, challenges the trial court's sanction ordering him to\nboth liens and for the notice of lis pendens; 3 the release          “take all actions necessary to release any and all liens on\nfor the notice of lis pendens was executed by Koestens on            the Property on or before January 31, 2007.” 1 Rather than\nDecember 28, 2006, and *105 the release for the $15,000              address the merits, the majority concludes that this appeal\nlien was executed by Paul A.

However, the evidence\nThompson submitted to the Harris County Clerk the releases           upon which the majority relies shows otherwise.

Land\n       Office, 789 S.W.2d at 571. The former applies where the challenged act is of such short duration that the appellant cannot\n       obtain review before the issue becomes moot, and has only been used to challenge unconstitutional acts performed by\n       the government. Id. The latter is invoked only under narrow circumstances, when vacating the underlying judgment will\n       not cure the adverse consequences suffered by the party seeking to appeal that judgment. Marshall v. Hous. Auth. of City\n       of San Antonio, 198 S.W.3d 782, 789 (Tex.2006). In order to invoke the collateral consequences exception, Thompson\n       must show (1) a concrete disadvantage resulted from the judgment; and (2) the disadvantage will persist even if the\n       judgment is vacated and the case dismissed as moot. Id. Thompson does not contend that either exception applies to the\n       present appeal, nor does he attempt to demonstrate (1) a concrete disadvantage resulted from the trial court's judgment;\n       or (2) he will continue to suffer any adverse consequences if the judgment below is vacated and the cause dismissed\n       as moot. Therefore, neither exception applies to this appeal.\n3      There is additional evidence that Thompson himself took actions to comply with the trial court's sanctions order.\n       Apparently, Thompson also authored a letter to Koestens, dated December 26, 2006, in which he (1) explains the practical\n       effect of the trial court's sanctions order; (2) instructs her to execute the release of the notice of lis pendens, and to have\n       Mr. Kubosh execute the releases of liens; and (3) requests that she “take care of these matters right away.” This letter,\n       attached as Exhibit A to appellees' “Partial Withdrawal Of Motion For Enforcement Of Orders And Request To Cancel\n       Hearing,” is present in appellees' brief, but is absent from the Clerk's Record. However, in their “Request To Supplement\n       Record For Appeal,” filed on July 9, 2007, appellees specifically requested that Exhibit A be included in the record, and\n       Thompson does not challenge the authenticity of the letter included in appellees' brief.\n4      The release for the $10,000 lien that was actually executed by Kubosh was prepared by attorney Stephen Best. It is not\n       apparent on the face of the record why Kubosh did not execute the release prepared by Thompson for this particular lien,\n       and the parties make no attempt to otherwise explain this occurrence in their briefs.\n5      Thompson contends that his appeal is not moot, because (1) the trial court's order on sanctions is still in effect; (2) there\n       has not been a court determination as to the completion of its vague terms; (3) the potential danger posed to him by\n       the order still exists; and (4) the trial court's order is serving as the underlying basis for a malpractice suit by appellees\n       currently pending. To the extent that this can be construed as an attempt to invoke the collateral consequences exception\n       to the mootness doctrine, we have two responses. See Marshall, 198 S.W.3d at 789. First, we have vacated that portion\n       of the order requiring Thompson to remove the liens and have dismissed the motion for sanctions as to Thompson.\n       As a result, nothing remains in the trial court for the appellees or the court to rely on for further contempt proceedings\n       against Thompson. Second, appellees—the parties who brought the motion for sanctions in the trial court—claim on\n       appeal that the appeal is moot by pointing out that Thompson has complied with the order. They would be estopped from\n       taking a contrary position below, or for all practical purposes would have problems taking a contrary position below. See\n       Moore v. Jet Stream Invs., Ltd., 261 S.W.3d 412, 429 (Tex.App.-Texarkana, 2008, no pet. h.) (citing Lopez v.

Article 1942, V. T. C. S., provides that county clerks\nshall be keepers of the records,     books, papers and proceedings        of their\nrespective   courts,  including matters of probate.       Article 6591, V. T. C. S.,\nrequires the clerk to record all instruments       of writing “ authorized    or\nrequired to be recorded in the c o u n t y clerk’s  office . . . .” Article 6600,\nV. T. C. S., requires him to “give attested copies whenever demanded of\nall papers recorded in his office . . . .‘I Therefore,         the answer to your\nquestion depends      on whether     the clerk is authorized      to record   letters\ntestamentary.\n\n         We have not found any provision in the Texas Probate Code, or any\nother s t a t u t e , which authorizes  the clerk to record the letter testamentary\nitself.   However,        the clerk is authorized by the Texas Probate Code to\nrecord such facts a s the name of the e x e c u t o r   t o whom letters testamentary\n\n\n\n                                             p. 1911\n\fThe Honorable         Homer     A.

The facts necessitating the guardianship are set out in further\n\ndetail in Section VIII below.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\n\n\nPhillips, Lonnie -Application for Temporary Guardian Pending Contest              Page 2 o£6\n\n\n\n                                                                                                    Page 11\n\f                                                v.\n         Applicant states that Lance Ervin Phillips, whose address is 2813 Moore Avenue, Bay\n\nCity, Texas, holds a general power of attorney signed by the Proposed Ward, which Power of\n\nAttorney is attached as \"Exhibit A.\"\n\n                                                VI.\n\n         Applicant requests that the powers granted Lance Ervin Phillips under the power of\n\nattorney be terminated on the qualification of the temporary guardian.\n\n                                               VII.\n\n         Applicant requests that if the Court appoints a Temporary Guardian, it grant him or her\n\nthe powers and authority to represent the Proposed Ward's interests in any pending litigation; to\n\ninitiate additional litigation if necessary to recovery the Proposed Ward's assets or to protect his\n\nassets, property, or well being; to review and any and all documents from his prior attorney for\n\nthe last five years and for any time period for estate or incapacity planning documents; the right\n\nto retain litigation counsel if necessary to adequately act on any of the foregoing requested\n\npowers; the right to collect all the Ward's assets and property, both real and personal, wherever\n\nsituated and by whomsoever held, including to become the payee for any pension, retirement,\n\nSocial Security, or other income, retirement, or public benefit; to order any workmen or repair\n\nwork being done to the Proposed Ward's residence either cease or continue; and to make monthly\n\nexpenditures on the Ward's behalf from the Ward's Estate not to exceed an amount set by the\n\nCourt.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nPhillips, Lonnie -Application for Temporary Guardian Pending Contest                  Page 3 o£6\n\n\n\n                                                                                                       Page 12\n\f                                               VIII.\n\n       Applicant states to the Court that the facts and reasons which support the requested\n\npowers are The Proposed Ward's estate is in imminent danger of irreparable damage due to his\n\nlack of proper representation in the pending lawsuit against Paul Davis Restoration, 405th\n\nJudicial District Court, Galveston County Cause Number 14-CV-0027. In this cause, here is a\n\ndiscrepancy whether the Petitioners are acting pro se or are represented by Ms. Davis: The\n\npleading states it was filed by two children of the Proposed Ward, Ava Phillips and Kevin\n\nCampbell, in an individual capacity and as next friend of the Proposed Ward. This Petition was\n\ndrafted by Ms. Veronica Davis, signed for the Petitioners \"with permission,\" but the Petition\n\nitself lists the Petitioner's as \"pro se.\" The District clerk, however, lists Ms. Veronica Davis as\n\nlead Counsel and Ms. Davis signed the request for service of citation. This litigation was filed\n\nafter the guardianship proceeding was initiated in this court.\n\n       Moreover, The Proposed Ward's assets are being spent by family members and Ms.\n\nVeronica Davis for repairs and materials, ostensibly for the repair of his home which was\n\ndamaged by fire without a proper person to oversee that the expediters actually benefit the\n\nProposed Ward and/or his Estate and that such expenditures are in the best interest of the\n\nProposed Ward.\n\n                                                IX.\n\n       Applicant prays that a hearing on this Application be set; that the Court appoint a proper\n\nperson Temporary Guardian of the Person and Estate of Lonnie Phillips, Jr., an Incapacitated\n\nAdult; that the Court Order appointing Temporary Guardian be effective upon the guardian\n\ntaking the Oath and giving a bond as required by law; that upon the Temporary Guardian's\n\n\nPhillips, Lonnie -Application for Temporary Guardian Pending Contest                Page 4 o£6\n\n\n\n                                                                                                      Page 13\n\fqualification, the Clerk of this Court shall so note such qualification on any certified copy of said\n\nOrder; that the Court appoint an Attorney Ad Litem to represent the Ward's Person and Estate, if\n\nnot already appointed; and that the Court enter any other Orders it deems necessary.\n\n\n\n\n                                             Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n                                             MAGGIORE LAW FIRM PLLC\n                                             1001 TexasAvenue, Suite 1400\n                                             Houston, TX 77002\n\n\n\n\n                                             M.

The parties initially thought that a guardianship\n\nwas necessary to resolve the issues pertaining to allocation of insurance and/or personal funds\n\nfor the benefit of restoration of the home of Lonnie Phillips and how work should proceed on the\n\nhome of lonnie Phillips, Jr. The children of the proposed ward bad a difference of opinion on\n\nhow things should proceed.\n\n       Same is no longer at issue because the initial applicant has abandoned his desire to\n\nproceed as general contractor for the repair of the home which is a part of the proposed ward's\n\nestate. Moreover, work has proceeded on the house and all funds which were previously on\n\nhand for repair, remodel, and rebuild have either been spent or contracts are pending for. Upon\n\ncompletion of the remodel, no funds will remain.\n\n                                               D.\n       The parties did not request nor ever intended for a court to appoint a temporary guardian.\n\n\n                                               -I-\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                   Page 31\n\fNo basis existed for such an appointment. That action was requested by the guardian ad litem,\n\nafter having assured the caretaker Ava Phillips that the parties would set a cowt date. Phillips\n\nfinds the action to be contradictory to the intent of the parties and contrary to the statement A,\n\nattached and incorporated by reference, the same as if fully copied and set fot:th herein.\n\n                                                m.\n       Applicant believes that the appointment of a guardian ad litem and attorney ad litem and\n\ntemporary guardian would serve to delay the rebuilding, repair and restoration of the home and\n\nwould divert funds from the repair process to pay the fees of ad litems, thereby making the home\n\nof Lonnie Phillips uninhabitable and would render the ward unable to return to his home.\n\nMoreover, having to seek approval of the ad litem to complete the work already begun would\n\nonly delay said return. Funds currently on hand are insufficient to complete the restoration of\n\nthe homestead of the ward. Therefore paying of ad litem fees to administer the estate would\n\nrender completion of the home impossible. Attached as Exhibits A & B, are the positions of the\n\napplication and caretaker for the ward, in connection therewith- same being attached and\n\nincorporated by reference, the same as if fully copied and set forth herein.\n\n       The applicant and caretaker bad previously bad concerns regarding whether to proceed\n\nwith the guardianship and did not pay the additional fees, due to the concerns of moving forward\n\nwith same.\n\n                                                IV.\n\n       Applicant further believes that this guardianship was delayed for an inordinate amount of\n\ntime when Davis attempted to work out a hearing date with the former ad litem. Instead of\n\nsetting a date, he in tum sought the appointment of another ad litem. Now there appears to be\n\n\n                                                 -2-\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                     Page 32\n\fthree- Maggiore, Drexlier, and Wylie.

A suit is currently pending for monies\n\nowed in connection. with the fire which damaged the aforementioned home.

It is necessary and advisable to sell the Estate' s interest in the aforementioned property for\n                     the following reasons:\n                     (a) The real property is currently vacant due to a fire which enabled the house to be\n                          inhabitable;\n                     (b) Family engaged a contractor to repair the home depositing approximately $33,000 of\n                          insurance funds with that contractor. Contractor performed no work, took the funds and\n                          has filed bankruptcy. The real property has been partially renovated but is not livable\n                          and the real property is subject to deterioration and vandalism as it is. The Guardian\n                          has filed claim in the bankruptcy court but it is unlikely that any proceeds will be\n                          returned;\n                     (c) There is approximately $60,000 (which includes funds for reimbursement of personal\n                          belongings) at Hartford Insurance;\n                     (d) Calvary Construction Co., has estimated the remaining repairs at a cost of $80,000 -\n                          $100,000;\n                     (e) The proceeds are needed to pay expenses of the Ward while in an assisted living\n                          facility. He is currently on Medicaid and all expenses for clothes, etc. has been paid\n                          for personally by the Guardian;\n\n\nApplication & Order for Sale of Real Property Under§ 1158.451 of the Estates Code\nIn the Guardianship of Lonnie Phillips, Jr.., an Incapacitated Person\nPage I of3\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                           Page 53\n\f                       (f) Cost to complete renovation is more than the value of the real prope1ty;\n                       (g) It is in the best interest of the Estate to sell the real property \"As Is\"; and\n                       (h) Left vacant the real property poses a liability to the Estate.\n\n            3.         It is the best interest of the Estate for the said property to be sold at a private sale for cash in\n                       as-is condition as the property is liable to perish, waste or deteriorate in value if left vacant\n                       and pose a liability to the Estate.\n\n            Applicant requests that citation be issued to all persons interested in the Estate, as required by law,\n and that, upon consideration or hearing on this Application, the Court enter an Order authorizing Guardian\n to sell the Estate's interest in the aforementioned property at a private sale \"AS IS\" and for cash, and such\n other orders as the Court may deem proper.\n\n                                                                   Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                                                   BY     (}_j);fJJP/fUIZJfl .\n                                                                   Catherine N.

Because the specified methods of service do not exclude any method\n       authorized under the code and therefore do not limit the applicability of the provision, the revised law omits the\n       quoted language as unnecessary.\n\n       (2) Section 632(i), Texas Probate Code, refers to proof of the “time” of mailing of service of citation or notice. The\n       revised law substitutes “date” for “time” for the reason stated in the revisor's note to Section 1051.052.\n\n\nV. T. C.

The revised law substitutes a reference to “this title”\n        for the reference to “this code” because the provisions of the Texas Probate Code that relate to qualification of\n        guardians are revised in Title 3 of this code, and this chapter is included in that title.\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

One of the points upon which we granted the writ          after the return of the verdict but before the entry of the\nof error was the alleged refusal of the Court of Civil Appeals      judgment, respondent caused to be forwarded to petitioner\nto direct the filing of the supplemental transcript.

Land\n       Office, 789 S.W.2d at 571. The former applies where the challenged act is of such short duration that the appellant cannot\n       obtain review before the issue becomes moot, and has only been used to challenge unconstitutional acts performed by\n       the government. Id. The latter is invoked only under narrow circumstances, when vacating the underlying judgment will\n       not cure the adverse consequences suffered by the party seeking to appeal that judgment. Marshall v. Hous. Auth. of City\n       of San Antonio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894704\"><a href=\"/opinion/894704/marshall-v-housing-auth-city-san-antonio/\"><span class=\"volume\">198</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">782</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 789 (Tex.2006). In order to invoke the collateral consequences exception, Thompson\n       must show (1) a concrete disadvantage resulted from the judgment; and (2) the disadvantage will persist even if the\n       judgment is vacated and the case dismissed as moot. Id. Thompson does not contend that either exception applies to the\n       present appeal, nor does he attempt to demonstrate (1) a concrete disadvantage resulted from the trial court's judgment;\n       or (2) he will continue to suffer any adverse consequences if the judgment below is vacated and the cause dismissed\n       as moot. Therefore, neither exception applies to this appeal.\n3      There is additional evidence that Thompson himself took actions to comply with the trial court's sanctions order.\n       Apparently, Thompson also authored a letter to Koestens, dated December 26, 2006, in which he (1) explains the practical\n       effect of the trial court's sanctions order; (2) instructs her to execute the release of the notice of lis pendens, and to have\n       Mr. Kubosh execute the releases of liens; and (3) requests that she “take care of these matters right away.” This letter,\n       attached as Exhibit A to appellees' “Partial Withdrawal Of Motion For Enforcement Of Orders And Request To Cancel\n       Hearing,” is present in appellees' brief, but is absent from the Clerk's Record. However, in their “Request To Supplement\n       Record For Appeal,” filed on July 9, 2007, appellees specifically requested that Exhibit A be included in the record, and\n       Thompson does not challenge the authenticity of the letter included in appellees' brief.\n4      The release for the $10,000 lien that was actually executed by Kubosh was prepared by attorney Stephen Best. It is not\n       apparent on the face of the record why Kubosh did not execute the release prepared by Thompson for this particular lien,\n       and the parties make no attempt to otherwise explain this occurrence in their briefs.\n5      Thompson contends that his appeal is not moot, because (1) the trial court's order on sanctions is still in effect; (2) there\n       has not been a court determination as to the completion of its vague terms; (3) the potential danger posed to him by\n       the order still exists; and (4) the trial court's order is serving as the underlying basis for a malpractice suit by appellees\n       currently pending. To the extent that this can be construed as an attempt to invoke the collateral consequences exception\n       to the mootness doctrine, we have two responses. See Marshall, 198 S.W.3d at 789. First, we have vacated that portion\n       of the order requiring Thompson to remove the liens and have dismissed the motion for sanctions as to Thompson.\n       As a result, nothing remains in the trial court for the appellees or the court to rely on for further contempt proceedings\n       against Thompson. Second, appellees—the parties who brought the motion for sanctions in the trial court—claim on\n       appeal that the appeal is moot by pointing out that Thompson has complied with the order. They would be estopped from\n       taking a contrary position below, or for all practical purposes would have problems taking a contrary position below. See\n       Moore v.

Article 1942, V. T. C. S., provides that county clerks\nshall be keepers of the records,     books, papers and proceedings        of their\nrespective   courts,  including matters of probate.       Article 6591, V. T. C. S.,\nrequires the clerk to record all instruments       of writing “ authorized    or\nrequired to be recorded in the c o u n t y clerk’s  office . . . .” Article 6600,\nV. T. C. S., requires him to “give attested copies whenever demanded of\nall papers recorded in his office . . . .‘I Therefore,         the answer to your\nquestion depends      on whether     the clerk is authorized      to record   letters\ntestamentary.\n\n         We have not found any provision in the Texas Probate Code, or any\nother s t a t u t e , which authorizes  the clerk to record the letter testamentary\nitself.   However,        the clerk is authorized by the Texas Probate Code to\nrecord such facts a s the name of the e x e c u t o r   t o whom letters testamentary\n\n\n\n                                             p. 1911\n\fThe Honorable         Homer     A.
