INTRODUCTION\n             The State’s local school funding formula requires a local government to\nmake a contribution to fund its local school district. The superior court held that this\nrequired local contribution is an unconstitutional dedication of a “state tax or license.”\nBut the minutes of the constitutional convention and the historical context of those\nproceedings suggest that the delegates intended that local communities and the State\nwould share responsibility for their local schools. And those proceedings also indicate\nthat the delegates did not intend for state-local cooperative programs like the school\nfunding formula to be included in the term “state tax or license.” These factors\ndistinguish this case from previous cases where we found that state funding mechanisms\n\n\n\n\n                                           -2-                                      7075\n\n\fviolated the dedicated funds clause. We therefore hold that the existing funding formula\ndoes not violate the constitution, and we reverse the superior court’s grant of summary\njudgment.\nII.    FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n       A.     School Funding Formula\n              Article VII, section 1 of the Alaska Constitution requires the state\nlegislature to “establish and maintain a system of public schools” open to all children in\nthe state.1 To fulfill this constitutional mandate, the legislature has defined three types\nof school districts according to where the district is located: city school districts,\nborough school districts, and regional education attendance areas.2 “[E]ach organized\nborough is a borough school district”;3 a borough must “establish[], maintain[], and\noperate[] a system of public schools on an areawide basis.”4 Local school boards\nmanage and control these school districts under authority delegated by AS 14.12.020.\nThis statute requires local borough and city governments to raise money “from local\nsources to maintain and operate” their local schools.5\n\n       1\n             Alaska Const. art. VII, § 1 (“The legislature shall by general law establish\nand maintain a system of public schools open to all children of the State, and may\nprovide for other public educational institutions.”).\n       2\n              AS 14.12.010. City school districts are those located within a home-rule\narea or city but outside an organized borough. Id. Borough school districts are those\nlocated in organized boroughs. Id. Regional education attendance areas are those\nlocated outside organized city, home-rule, or borough boundaries. Id.\n       3\n              AS 14.12.010(2).\n       4\n              AS 29.35.160(a).\n       5\n             AS 14.12.020(c) (“The borough assembly for a borough school district, and\nthe city council for a city school district, shall provide the money that must be raised\n                                                                           (continued...)\n                                            -3-                                      7075\n\n\f              The local school funding formula begins with the concept of “basic need.”\nThis concept is intended to equalize districts by providing them with needed resources,\ntaking into account differences among districts.6 A statutory formula determines a\ndistrict’s basic need based on two variables: the district’s adjusted average daily\nmembership and the statewide base student allocation.7 The district’s adjusted average\ndaily membership accounts for several metrics such as enrollment, school size, relative\ncosts in the district, the number of students with special needs, and the number of\ncorrespondence students.8 The base student allocation is a per-student allowance set by\na statute that the legislature periodically revisits.9\n\n\n\n\n(...continued)\nfrom local sources to maintain and operate the district.”). By contrast, the legislature\nfunds districts located in the regional educational attendance areas, which lack taxing\nauthority. Id. (“The legislature shall provide the state money necessary to maintain and\noperate the regional educational attendance areas.”); see Alaska Const. art. X, § 2 (“The\nState may delegate taxing powers to organized boroughs and cities only.”); Matanuska-\nSusitna Borough Sch. Dist. v. State, 931 P.2d 391, 399-400 (Alaska 1997) (stating that\ntaxing power explains, in part, why the legislature treats districts differently).\n       6\n           ALASKA DEP’T OF EDUC. & EARLY DEV., ALASKA’S PUBLIC SCHOOL\nFUNDING FORMULA: A REPORT TO THE ALASKA STATE LEGISLATURE 8 (2001).\n       7\n              AS 14.17.410(b)(1).\n       8\n              AS 14.17.410(b)(1)(A)–(D); AS 14.17.420(a).\n       9\n             AS 14.17.470; see e.g., ch. 9, §§ 8–10, SLA 2008 (setting the amount at\n$5,480 for 2008, $5,580 for 2009, and $5,680 for 2010); ch. 41, § 7, SLA 2006 (setting\nthe amount at $5,380 for 2006). As of November 2015, the per-student allowance is\n$5,830.

The local contribution includes “appropriations and\nthe value of in-kind services made by a district.” AS 14.17.990(6).\n       16\n             AS 14.17.410(b)(2). A mill rate is “a tax applied to real property whereby\neach mill represents $1of tax assessment per $1,000 of the property’s assessed value.”\nBLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 1084 (10th ed. 2014).\n                                            -5-                                       7075\n\n\fcity to contribute more than “45 percent of a district’s basic need for the preceding fiscal\nyear.”17 A city or borough school district also may make a voluntary contribution, but\na statutory cap prevents a local community from contributing more than the greater of\nthe “equivalent of a two mill tax levy on the full and true value of the taxable real and\npersonal property in the district” or “23 percent of the total of the district’s basic need\nfor the fiscal year.”18 Thus, under the current framework, organized boroughs and cities\nwork together with the State to support public schools.\n       B.     Prior Proceedings\n              Ketchikan Gateway Borough is an organized borough that must annually\ncontribute to fund its schools under AS 14.12.020.19 The required payment, set by the\nschool funding formula,20 supports the Ketchikan Gateway Borough School District. In\n2013, the district’s “basic need” for the upcoming 2014 fiscal year was almost\n$26 million; the required local contribution was about $4.2 million. Though the Borough\ncontributed this amount “under protest,” it voluntarily contributed an additional $3.8\nmillion. After contributing the funds, the Borough brought suit against the State, asking\nthe superior court, first, to declare the required local contribution unconstitutional;\nsecond, to enjoin the State from requiring the Borough to comply with the statute; and,\n\n       17\n              AS 14.17.410(b)(2).\n       18\n              AS 14.17.410(c)(1)–(2).\n       19\n               AS 14.12.020(c) (“The borough assembly for a borough school district\n. . . shall provide the money that must be raised from local sources to maintain and\noperate the district.”). Ketchikan Gateway Borough incorporated as a second-class\nborough on September 13, 1963. Ketchikan Gateway Borough, Alaska, Code 01.05.040\n(2015).\n       20\n              See AS 14.17.410(b)(2) (“[T]he required local contribution of a city or\nborough school district is the equivalent of a 2.65 mill tax levy on the full and true value\nof the taxable real and personal property in the district . . . .”).\n                                            -6-                                       7075\n\n\fthird, to direct the State to refund its protested $4.2 million payment. Both parties moved\nfor summary judgment.\n              The superior court partially granted the Borough’s motion. It agreed with\nthe Borough that the required local contribution violated the dedicated funds clause\nunder article IX, section 7 of the state constitution. The dedicated funds clause provides:\n              The proceeds of any state tax or license shall not be dedicated\n              to any special purpose, except as provided in section 15 of\n              this article or when required by the federal government for\n              state participation in federal programs. This provision shall\n              not prohibit the continuance of any dedication for special\n              purposes existing upon the date of ratification of this section\n              by the people of Alaska.[21]\nThe superior court concluded that the required local contribution constituted the proceeds\nof a state tax or license; that the local contribution statute earmarked those funds for a\nspecific purpose and prevented the legislature from using the funds in any other manner;\nand that the required local contribution was not exempt from the constitutional\nprohibition against dedicated funds.\n              The superior court denied summary judgment on the Borough’s other\nclaims. It concluded that the local contribution did not violate the appropriations or\ngovernor’s veto clauses and that equity did not require the State to refund the local\ncontribution to the Borough for the 2014 fiscal year.\n              The appropriations clause under article IX, section 13 provides: “No\nmoney shall be withdrawn from the treasury except in accordance with appropriations\nmade by law. No obligation for the payment of money shall be incurred except as\nauthorized by law. Unobligated appropriations outstanding at the end of the period of\n\n\n\n\n       21\n              Alaska Const. art. IX, § 7.\n\n                                            -7-                                      7075\n\ftime specified by law shall be void.”22 And the governor’s veto clause under article II,\nsection 15 provides: “The governor may veto bills passed by the legislature. He may,\nby veto, strike or reduce items in appropriation bills. He shall return any vetoed bill,\nwith a statement of his objections, to the house of origin.”23 The court concluded that\nneither clause was violated because the required local contribution “does not enter the\nstate treasury” and because the required local contribution is not an appropriation. The\ncourt further concluded that it was unproblematic that the required local contribution\nnever entered the state treasury. In denying the Borough’s request for a refund, the court\nexplained that the State was not unjustly enriched because the required local contribution\ndid not benefit the State.\n              The State appealed and the Borough cross-appealed, together asking us to\nconsider all four prongs of the superior court’s decision: whether the required local\ncontribution is unconstitutional under the dedicated funds, appropriations, or governor’s\nveto clauses and, if so, whether equity requires refunding the Borough’s protested\npayment.24\n\n\n       22\n              Alaska Const. art. IX, § 13.\n       23\n              Alaska Const. art. II, § 15.\n       24\n              Six amici also filed briefs. The Fairbanks North Star Borough filed in\nsupport of the Borough. Five amici filed in support of the State: the Citizens for the\nEducational Advancement of Alaska’s Children and the NEA-Alaska each filed a brief;\nand the Association of Alaska School Boards, the Alaska Council of School\nAdministrators, and the Alaska Superintendents Association filed a joint brief.

Accordingly it concludes that the\nrequired local contribution violates the dedicated funds clause. First the Borough claims\nthat before statehood, “municipalities exercised independent judgment and discretion as\nto what they could afford to pay for schools” and notes that “cities were not required to\nprovide any particular amount to the school districts.” Second the Borough argues that\nthe refund amount that cities received from the Territory “depended on how much was\nappropriated by the Legislature for such purpose.”\n              However, as we explain below, the required local contribution is the most\nrecent iteration of a longstanding state-local cooperative program in which local\ncommunities and the State share responsibility for funding Alaska’s public schools.\nAccordingly, whether or not it is a dedication that predated statehood, the required local\ncontribution is not a “state tax or license” within the meaning of the dedicated funds\nclause.\n\n\n\n\n       31\n              See §§ 37-3-31 to -33, 37-3-41, 37-3-62 Alaska Compiled Laws Annotated\n(ACLA) (1949).

Under the Alaska\nCompiled Laws of 1949, each city constituted a single school district and each had an\nobligation to provide public school services.34 An incorporated city also could join with\nadjacent areas to form an independent school district.35 Local school boards, which\noversaw local school activities, had the power to assess, levy, and collect taxes to assist\nwith this obligation to support their schools.36 Though territorial law did not dictate an\nexact funding amount, it required cities to provide “suitable school houses . . . and . . .\nthe necessary funds to maintain [local] public schools”37 or, if part of an independent\nschool district, to set aside funding for their share of local school costs.38 Like today,\nlocal communities enjoyed discretion in determining how to satisfy their funding\nobligation.

Territorial law provided for the legislature to refund a portion of local school\nexpenses from time to time.41 The amount local communities received reflected a\nstatutory formula that considered factors like the number of students in the district, the\ntotal amount the district spent to maintain its school system, and the expenses the\nTerritory had approved in the district’s budget.42 Thus before Alaska became a state,\nlocal communities and the Territory together supported local schools, much like today.\n\n\n       39\n              Id. § 37-3-35; see AS 14.17.990(6) (defining “local contribution”).\n       40\n              §§ 37-3-55, 37-3-63 ACLA.\n       41\n              Id. §§ 37-3-61 to -62.

The delegates, for example,\nrejected an amendment to the dedicated funds clause proposed by Delegate Buckalew\nthat would have deleted a sentence in the clause that allowed for existing dedications to\ncontinue. Id. at 2416. Delegate Buckalew had expressed concern that “the [only]\nsensible sound way to run a state is to abolish this practice [of earmarking funds] which\nleads to evils as far as the fiscal management of the state is concerned.” Id. at 2413.\nDelegate Peratrovich, who participated in the committee that drafted the clause,\nresponded that the committee sought to strike a compromise:\n               [Y]ou have to compromise. . . . [I]t was dangerous to give\n               free rein to the new state in earmarking funds. However, I\n               realize . . . that there was some good being accomplished by\n               those earmarked funds that we have on the books today and\n               I feel that I cannot support [Buckalew’s amendment] on that\n               condition.\nId. at 2414.\n\n                                           -14-\t                                     7075\n\n\fexceptions. The delegates recognized, for example, that dedications should be allowed\nwhen required to participate in federal programs and when such dedications preexisted\nstatehood. One such draft provided:\n              All tax revenues shall be deposited in a general fund to be\n              established and maintained by the state. This provision shall\n              not prohibit the continuance of any special fund for special\n              purposes existing at the effective date of the constitution.[46]\nA subsequent draft modified the first sentence: “All revenues shall be deposited in the\nState treasury without allocation for special purposes, except where state participation\nin Federal programs will thereby be denied,”47 and preserved the exemption for\nallocations in existence at the time of statehood.48\n              But the delegates feared that this draft language might prohibit too much.49\nAccordingly they modified the clause in two key respects. First, they reworded the\nclause by replacing “[a]ll revenues” with “proceeds of any state tax or license.” Second,\nthey revised the last sentence by replacing “any special fund” with “any dedication”:\n              The proceeds of any state tax or license shall not be\n              dedicated to any special purpose, except as provided in\n              section 15 of this article or when required by the federal\n              government for state participation in federal programs. This\n              provision shall not prohibit the continuance of any dedication\n\n\n\n       46\n            FORMAL OP.

A flat prohibition was neither feasible nor desirable.51 The\ndedicated funds clause could not be “strict[ly] interpret[ed]” because both legal and\ncontractual obligations would “require a segregation of certain moneys,” including:\n             pension contributions, proceeds from bond issues, sinking\n             fund receipts, revolving fund receipts, contributions from\n             local government units for state-local cooperative programs,\n             and tax receipts which the state might collect on behalf of\n             local government units.[52]\nDelegate White explained that the amended language allowed these exceptions to\ncontinue: “By going to the tax itself and saying that the tax shall not be earmarked, we\neliminated [the need to make explicit] all seven of those exceptions.”53\n             The colloquy among the delegates reflects this deliberate compromise\nembodied by the clause. Just as the delegates voiced the need for State control over state\nrevenue, the delegates lauded the clause for preserving certain programs, including those\n\n\n      50\n             Alaska Const. art.

Both the Borough and the State appear to agree that the\ndelegates amended the clause to avoid interfering with programs such as pension\ncontributions and state-local cooperative programs.\n\n                                          -16-                                      7075\n\n\ffor “highways, airports, and schools.”54 Through this compromise, the delegates allowed\ndedications “now on the statute books [to] be left in effect as long as the legislature saw\nfit to leave them there,”55 and, as Delegate White noted, the delegates allowed setting\naside certain monies pursuant to statute, including those for state-local cooperative\nprograms.56\n              The delegates recognized that an arrangement of shared responsibility\nbetween the State and local communities offered substantial benefits, particularly in the\ntransition to the borough system of local governance. Active participation in local\ngovernance promised to save the State “hundreds of thousands of dollars of the\ntaxpayers’ money.”57 Cooperative programs, like those in which the State and local\ncommunities shared the cost of providing local public services, encouraged\nunincorporated areas to incorporate by reassuring them that they would “definitely\nbenefit by organizing . . . [to] get[] into the picture of local government.”58 Existing\ncost-sharing programs between the Territory and local communities, like that in\neducation, combined with increased local control over education and other services\noffered such incentives.59\n\n       54\n              FORMAL OP.

As Delegate Victor Rivers explained:\n              We thought that at the state level it would be the policy as it\n              has been in the past to offer certain inducements to them to\n              organize. Now, at the present time in incorporated cities\n              there are certain refunds of taxes in the nature of license\n              taxes, liquor taxes, and other taxes that are a percentage, at\n              least, of which reverts back to the organized area. In the\n              extent that the benefits the legislature sets up will offset the\n              added cost to the people, . . . but it was our thought there\n              would be enough inducement for them to organize and\n              exercise home rule so that as time went on they would\n              gradually all become incorporated boroughs. . . . The thought\n              was that inducements to organize would be offered on the\n              basis of the granting of home rule powers plus certain other\n              inducements that would make it advantageous to them to be\n              boroughs, as we now have that same program of inducement\n              to organize communities.\nId.

In 1961 the legislature enacted incorporation standards for boroughs, as\nrequired under article X, section 3 of the Alaska Constitution, and delegated significant\nresponsibility to them.68 As the delegates envisioned,69 those responsibilities included\nthe State’s constitutional obligation to provide public schools.70\n\n\n\n\n       67\n                Id. at 2647 (statement of Delegate Rosswog) (noting that the delegates\nsought to develop a “flexible” framework on which the legislature could build and fill\nin the “exact details . . . by law”); see also id. at 2654 (statement of Delegate V.

State laws that governed city\nschool districts now also governed borough school districts, including those related to\n“financial support . . . and other general laws relating to schools.”72 These financial\nsupport laws and other general school laws were largely the same as those in place pre­\nstatehood.73 As in the Territory, local communities, including boroughs, were required\nto support local schools.74\n             In a 1962 act, the legislature began to adapt the pre-statehood cooperative\nprogram for providing school services to the borough system of governance.

In Alex, the program at issue was first enacted in 1976,\nnearly 20 years after Alaska became a state, and there was no evidence suggesting that\nthe program was one the delegates intended would fall outside the clause.104 The\nregional aquaculture associations, who would benefit from the assessment, were also\nestablished in 1976, long after Alaska became a state.105 Accordingly in Alex we did not\nconsider whether a longstanding state-local cooperative program was a “state tax or\nlicense” within the meaning of the dedicated funds clause.\n                     b.\t    City of Fairbanks v.

Article XI (at issue in City of Fairbanks), unlike article IX (at issue\nhere and in Alex), defines the scope of the initiative, referendum, and recall process.111\nBy contrast article IX defines the scope of a different set of powers, those related to state\nfinance and taxation.112 Because City of Fairbanks considered an entirely different set\nof powers, that decision has no bearing here.\n                      c.

Myers v. Alaska Housing Finance Corp.\n              Another ten years passed before we again considered the dedicated funds\nclause. In Myers v. Alaska Housing Finance Corp., we upheld a legislative scheme for\nselling anticipated future state revenue from a settlement against tobacco companies so\nthat it could fund rural school improvements.120 The legislature accomplished the\nscheme in three steps: First, the legislature deemed the State’s right to future settlement\npayments to be an asset.121 As with other assets, the State could sell the future settlement\npayments for a lump sum amount that reflected the present value of the anticipated\nrevenue stream.122 Second, the legislature issued revenue bonds secured by the estimated\npresent value of the settlement.123 Finally, the legislature then appropriated a portion of\nthe bond proceeds to fund the necessary school improvements.124\n              Though the tobacco settlement fell within the scope of the dedicated funds\nclause and though the scheme dedicated future state revenue, we concluded that the\nscheme was constitutional.125 We explained that unlike Alex and Sonneman, which\nclearly dealt with the allocation of future revenues, the revenue allocation scheme in\n\n\n       120\n              68 P.3d 386, 387-88 (Alaska 2003).\n       121\n              Id. at 388.\n       122\n              Id.\n       123\n              Id.\n       124\n              Id.\n       125\n              Id. at 390-91.\n\n                                           -31-                                       7075\n\n\fMyers was different.126 The scheme in Myers reduced future revenue to present value\nand used that value to secure bonds, the proceeds of which would be dedicated to fund\nschool improvements that year.127\n                    e.       Southeast Alaska Conservation Council v. State\n             Most recently, in Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, we returned to\nthe dedicated funds clause when we struck down an act that transferred state land to the\nUniversity of Alaska and then directed that income derived from that land be held in trust\nfor the University.128 Before concluding that the act was unconstitutional, we engaged\nin a two-part inquiry. First, we concluded that proceeds from the land were within the\nscope of the clause’s reference to “proceeds of any state tax or license.”129 In doing so,\nwe reiterated our warning in Alex that the “constitution prohibits the dedication of any\nsource of revenue.”130 And we explained that, unlike Myers, the act did not contemplate\na non-recurring appropriation, which as in Myers would have been permissible under the\nclause.131\n             Second, we considered whether the University was exempt from the\ndedicated funds prohibition by virtue of an implied exception under article VII, section 2\nof the Alaska Constitution, which authorized the University to hold title to real\n\n\n\n\n       126\n             Id. at 392.\n\n       127\n             Id. at 389.\n\n       128\n             202 P.3d 1162, 1165-66, 1177 (Alaska 2009).\n\n       129\n             Id. at 1169.\n\n       130\n             Id.

Like the other\ncases in this line, it did not address a longstanding cooperative program, like the school\nfunding program, in which local governments and the State share responsibility for\nproviding a local public service. Such programs do not violate the dedicated funds\nclause.\n              Here we are asked for the first time whether local contributions to\nlongstanding cooperative programs in which the State and local governments share\nfunding responsibility run afoul of the dedicated funds clause. The minutes of the\nconstitutional convention and the historical context of those proceedings reveal that the\ndelegates did not intend for required local contributions to such programs to be included\nin the term “state tax or license.” Today’s statutory program for funding local public\nschools falls squarely within the type of state-local cooperative programs the delegates\n\n\n\n\n       132\n                Se.

We therefore\nconclude that the existing school funding formula does not violate the dedicated funds\nclause.\n       B.\t      The School Funding Formula Does Not Violate The Appropriations Or\n                Governor’s Veto Clauses.\n                We agree with the superior court that the required local contribution does\nnot violate the appropriations clause or the governor’s veto clause of the Alaska\nConstitution.\n                Article IX, section 13, the appropriations clause, provides: “No money\nshall be withdrawn from the treasury except in accordance with appropriations made by\nlaw. No obligation for the payment of money shall be incurred except as authorized by\nlaw. Unobligated appropriations at the end of the period of time specified by law shall\nbe void.”135 Article II, section 15, the governor’s veto clause, provides: “The governor\nmay veto bills passed by the legislature. He may, by veto, strike or reduce items in\nappropriation bills. He shall return any vetoed bill, with a statement of his objections,\nto the house of origin.”136\n                Like the dedicated funds clause, the appropriations clause and the\ngovernor’s veto clause both address how the State spends state revenue. Together the\nclauses govern the legislature’s and the governor’s “joint responsibility . . . to determine\nthe State’s spending priorities on an annual basis.”137 As with our preceding analysis,\nwe must interpret these constitutional clauses “according to reason, practicality, and\n\n\n\n       135\n                Alaska Const. art. IX, § 13.\n\n       136\n                Alaska Const. art. II, § 15.\n\n       137\n             Simpson v. Murkowski, 129 P.3d 435, 447 (Alaska 2006) (quoting the trial\n\ncourt decision).\n\n                                                -34-\t                                 7075\n\n\fcommon sense, taking into account the plain meaning and purpose of the law as well as\nthe intent of the drafters.”138\n              The Borough argues that the required local contribution is an appropriation\nthat bypasses the constitutionally mandated appropriations process and that the\ngovernor’s veto clause requires that the governor be given the opportunity to veto this\nappropriation. If we assume the required local contribution is local money as the State\ncontends, the required local contribution would not violate either the appropriations\nclause or the governor’s veto clause because these clauses address state money, not local\nmoney. On the other hand, even if we assume that the local contribution is state money\nas the Borough contends, the required local contribution still would not violate either\nclause. The local contribution never enters the state treasury, and it is never subject to\nappropriations bills. The appropriations clause, per its plain language, applies to\nwithdrawals from the state treasury, and the governor’s veto applies to appropriation\nbills.139 The required local contribution does not withdraw from the state treasury; and\nit is not an appropriation bill.\n              The Borough correctly points out that the constitutional delegates\nintentionally established a system in which both the legislature and the governor would\nconsider how to spend state money each year. But while all three clauses — the\ndedicated funds clause, appropriations clause, and governor’s veto clause — address\npower over the state budget, the plain meaning of each clause reveals three distinct\npurposes. Through the dedicated funds clause, the delegates sought to avoid the evils\nof earmarking, which the delegates feared would “curtail[] the exercise of budgetary\n\n\n       138\n              West v.

The Borough Is Not Entitled To A Refund Of Its Protested Payment.\n             Because we find the required local contribution constitutional, we need not\nconsider the Borough’s request for a refund of its protested payment. Accordingly, we\nuphold the superior court’s denial of the Borough’s request.\nV.     CONCLUSION\n             We REVERSE the superior court’s decision granting summary judgment\nin favor of the Borough and REMAND to allow the court to enter judgment in favor of\nthe State.\n\n\n\n\n       140\n           State v.

But like Justice Winfree, I am concerned that\nthe court was not given the opportunity to decide the dedicated funds question controlled\nby article IX, section 7 of the Alaska Constitution as presented by this appeal in the fuller\ncontext of the public schools clause of article VII, section 1 of the Alaska Constitution.\nI do not believe that this court’s opinion today necessarily determines that the State’s\nrequired local contribution would survive constitutional scrutiny under article VII,\nsection 1 — it might, it might not — but the parties intentionally did not litigate this\nquestion either in the superior court or this court, and notwithstanding pointed questions\nby several justices in oral argument inquiring into the potential application of article VII,\nsection 1, the parties adamantly insisted that constitutional provision was not in issue.\nIn my view, therefore, the question whether the State’s required local contribution is\nconstitutional under the public schools clause remains an undecided question.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -37-                                       7075\n\n\fWINFREE, Justice, concurring.\n              Statutes are presumed to be constitutional, and the party challenging a\nstatute’s constitutionality has the burden of persuasion; doubts are resolved in favor of\nconstitutionality.1 Although I have considerable doubt about the constitutionality of the\nstatutorily required local contribution (RLC) public schools funding component, I cannot\nconclude that the presumption has been overcome in this case. I therefore agree that the\nsuperior court’s primary decision — that the RLC is an unconstitutional dedicated tax\n— should be vacated. But I do not rule out an ultimate conclusion that the RLC is\nunconstitutional, as a dedicated tax or otherwise, and therefore do not join the court’s\nanalysis or decision on this point.2 In my view the question cannot be answered\ndefinitively without a full interpretation and understanding of the Alaska Constitution’s\npublic schools clause, which, apparently for strategic reasons, the parties did not\nconfront.\n              Addressing how the RLC has every appearance of a dedicated tax warrants\na brief discussion of the public schools clause. Article VII, section 1 of the Alaska\nConstitution states in relevant part: “The legislature shall by general law establish and\nmaintain a system of public schools open to all children of the State . . . .”\n              We addressed this provision in Macauley v. Hildebrand,3 when we reversed\na superior court decision allowing a borough to require that a non-consenting borough\nschool district use the borough’s centralized system for accounting control over funds\n\n         1\n              Alaskans for a Common Language, Inc. v. Kritz, 170 P.3d 183, 192 (Alaska\n2007).\n         2\n             I agree with the court’s analysis and conclusion affirming the superior\ncourt’s secondary decision that the RLC does not violate the Alaska Constitution’s\nappropriations or governor’s veto clauses.\n         3\n              491 P.2d 120 (Alaska 1971).\n\n                                           -38-                                    7075\n\n\fappropriated to the school district.4 An existing statute allowed centralized accounting\nupon the school district’s consent, and the issue before us was the validity of the borough\nordinance conflicting with the statute.5 We stated the general rule that, notwithstanding\nthe constitution granting broad powers to home rule municipalities,6 “the determination\nof whether a home rule municipality can enforce an ordinance which conflicts with a\nstate statute depends on whether the matter regulated is of statewide or local concern.”7\nWe held that the question was controlled by article VII, section 1:\n              This constitutional mandate for pervasive state authority in\n              the field of education could not be more clear. First, the\n              language is mandatory, not permissive. Second, the section\n              not only requires that the legislature “establish” a school\n              system, but also gives to that body the continuing obligation\n              to “maintain” the system. Finally, the provision is\n              unqualified; no other unit of government shares\n              responsibility or authority.[8]\nWe later confirmed that article VII, section 1’s mandate that the legislature establish and\n\n\n\n\n       4\n              Id. at 121-22.\n       5\n              Id. at 121.\n       6\n              Cf.

We also noted that the legislature’s delegation of “certain educational\nfunctions” to local school boards “does not diminish this constitutionally mandated state\ncontrol over education.” Id.\n\n                                           -39-                                      7075\n\n\fmaintain a public schools system has a dual nature: “It imposes a [constitutional] duty\nupon the state legislature, and it confers upon Alaska school age children a\n[constitutional] right to education.”9\n              In what otherwise is a vacuum the RLC has all the hallmarks of an\nunconstitutional dedicated tax. The RLC is a State-imposed mandate that municipalities\nraise specified funds for the State’s public schools system; it is a revenue source for the\nState — and a tax by any other name remains a tax10 — and the revenues are dedicated\nto the State’s public schools system even though they never enter the State’s treasury.11\n              I find unpersuasive the court’s conclusion that the RLC is exempt from the\ndedicated tax prohibition because it is a post-statehood continuation of a territorial\ndedicated tax or a cooperative effort to establish and maintain public schools. First, the\nRLC was not a part of the territorial municipal school funding system. (The territorial\ntax dedicated to schools discussed at the constitutional convention was a tobacco tax\nearmarked for school construction.12) In the territorial system municipal school districts\nwere required to determine their own budgets and local tax-funding levels, but were\npromised some level of territorial reimbursement.         Now the State determines a\nfoundational “basic need” for all school districts and requires municipalities to fund\nspecific amounts of that “basic need” in their school districts. The territorial system did\nnot include a dedicated tax on municipalities; the current system appears to do so.\n\n\n         9\n              Hootch v. Alaska State-Operated Sch.

It is difficult to understand how mandatory\ndelegation of functions and municipal funding for the State’s public schools system can\nbe a cooperative effort. More importantly, the court misperceives our earlier discussion\nabout funding cooperative efforts — we did not suggest the framers approved of a state\ntax dedicated to a cooperative effort, but rather approved of dedicating State revenues,\nafter they reach the State treasury, to a cooperative effort (and other uses of revenues).13\n              What then gives me pause? By apparent design, the tail may be wagging\nthe dog — the parties appear to be using the dedicated tax clause to define the public\nschools clause’s limits.\n              If we focus solely on the constitutional prohibition of dedicated taxes and\nconclude that the RLC is a dedicated tax, we may be inferentially but necessarily\nconcluding that the public schools clause is a constitutional mandate that the State alone\nmust provide the funds necessary to meet at least minimum constitutional requirements\nfor the statewide unified public schools system.14          Under this view municipal\ncontributions to local public schools may not be compelled, but may be volunteered to\nsupplement State funding to enhance local educational opportunities. This would be a\nremarkable conclusion to reach without ever considering the public schools clause.15\n\n       13\n              Alex, 646 P.2d at 209-10.\n       14\n               Cf.

Alex, 646 P.2d at 210-11, we concluded that the\nlegislature’s general constitutional authority over natural resources could not be\nconstrued to override the constitutional prohibition of a dedicated tax, an analysis that\n                                                                            (continued...)\n\n                                           -41-                                       7075\n\n\f              I certainly do not suggest that this interpretation of the public schools clause\nwould be incorrect. Looking only at the constitutional language and our limited case\nlaw, a credible argument can be made that the constitution requires funding the public\nschools system in a significantly different manner than in territorial days.16 The\nconstitution mandates that the State, through the legislature, “establish and maintain” a\npublic schools system,17 and our case law establishes both that it is a unified public\nschools system18 and that “no other unit of government” shares the State’s obligation.19\nThis seems inconsistent with a RLC; if the current RLC is allowable, the State\ntheoretically could craft a RLC compelling a municipality to pay for all of its public\nschools system costs without any State contribution whatsoever.20\n\n\n         15\n             (...continued)\nmay apply in this context as well. But I decline to apply it in rote fashion without a full\nexplication and understanding of the public schools clause.\n         16\n              Cf.

But this also seems inconsistent with\nthe subsequent constitutional directive that the State, through the legislature, establish\nand maintain a statewide public schools system.\n              An interesting question not before us is whether the State could avoid its\nconstitutional obligation to maintain a statewide unified public schools system by\nrefusing to fund school operations if a municipality does not comply with the RLC\nmandate. See AS 14.17.410(d) (providing that if the RLC is not made, the State will not\n                                                                          (continued...)\n\n                                             -42-                                       7075\n\n\f              On the other hand the public schools clause does not expressly provide that\nthe State must fund the statewide public schools system.21 Before statehood the territory\ndid not alone fund municipal schools,22 and there was little discussion of the public\nschools clause at the constitutional convention.23 And as the court notes, shortly after\nstatehood the legislature created a public schools funding framework inconsistent with\nthe notion that the State is solely obligated to fund the public schools system.24 Perhaps,\nas the court concludes — but not for its stated reasons — the RLC is constitutionally\nviable. But this conclusion may also inferentially and necessarily require the conclusion\n\n\n\n\n       20\n              (...continued)\nprovide any school funds); cf. Matanuska-Susitna Borough Sch.

Hammond, 553 P.2d 1, 4 n.4 (Alaska 1976) (“Contemporaneous\ninterpretation of fundamental law by those participating in its drafting has traditionally\nbeen viewed as especially weighty evidence of the framers’ intent.”). By my count 10\nconstitutional delegates were in the 60-member 1961-62 legislature: Delegates Coghill,\nHellenthal, McNealy, McNees, Metcalf, Nolan, Peratrovich, Smith, Sweeney, and\nTaylor.\n\n                                           -43-                                      7075\n\n\fthat the State does not have a constitutional duty to fund the statewide public schools\nsystem.\n              I am left with the following conclusions. If the public schools clause\nrequires that the statewide schools system be funded to a constitutionally acceptable\nminimum by the State, then the RLC likely is an unconstitutional dedicated tax. If the\npublic schools clause allows the legislature to require local funding for the statewide\nunified schools system, then, depending on its parameters for requiring local funding, the\nRLC may or may not be an unconstitutional dedicated tax. But, deliberately, the\ninterpretation of the public schools clause was not litigated in the superior court and,\ntherefore, was not meaningfully briefed in this appeal. Although I have considerable\ndoubt that the RLC is constitutional, on this record and briefing I must resolve that doubt\nin favor of the presumption that it is constitutional.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -44-                                      7075\n\n\f",

INTRODUCTION\n             The State’s local school funding formula requires a local government to\nmake a contribution to fund its local school district. The superior court held that this\nrequired local contribution is an unconstitutional dedication of a “state tax or license.”\nBut the minutes of the constitutional convention and the historical context of those\nproceedings suggest that the delegates intended that local communities and the State\nwould share responsibility for their local schools. And those proceedings also indicate\nthat the delegates did not intend for state-local cooperative programs like the school\nfunding formula to be included in the term “state tax or license.” These factors\ndistinguish this case from previous cases where we found that state funding mechanisms\n\n\n\n\n                                           -2-                                      7075\n\n\fviolated the dedicated funds clause. We therefore hold that the existing funding formula\ndoes not violate the constitution, and we reverse the superior court’s grant of summary\njudgment.\nII.    FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n       A.     School Funding Formula\n              Article VII, section 1 of the Alaska Constitution requires the state\nlegislature to “establish and maintain a system of public schools” open to all children in\nthe state.1 To fulfill this constitutional mandate, the legislature has defined three types\nof school districts according to where the district is located: city school districts,\nborough school districts, and regional education attendance areas.2 “[E]ach organized\nborough is a borough school district”;3 a borough must “establish[], maintain[], and\noperate[] a system of public schools on an areawide basis.”4 Local school boards\nmanage and control these school districts under authority delegated by AS 14.12.020.\nThis statute requires local borough and city governments to raise money “from local\nsources to maintain and operate” their local schools.5\n\n       1\n             Alaska Const. art. VII, § 1 (“The legislature shall by general law establish\nand maintain a system of public schools open to all children of the State, and may\nprovide for other public educational institutions.”).\n       2\n              AS 14.12.010. City school districts are those located within a home-rule\narea or city but outside an organized borough. Id. Borough school districts are those\nlocated in organized boroughs. Id. Regional education attendance areas are those\nlocated outside organized city, home-rule, or borough boundaries. Id.\n       3\n              AS 14.12.010(2).\n       4\n              AS 29.35.160(a).\n       5\n             AS 14.12.020(c) (“The borough assembly for a borough school district, and\nthe city council for a city school district, shall provide the money that must be raised\n                                                                           (continued...)\n                                            -3-                                      7075\n\n\f              The local school funding formula begins with the concept of “basic need.”\nThis concept is intended to equalize districts by providing them with needed resources,\ntaking into account differences among districts.6 A statutory formula determines a\ndistrict’s basic need based on two variables: the district’s adjusted average daily\nmembership and the statewide base student allocation.7 The district’s adjusted average\ndaily membership accounts for several metrics such as enrollment, school size, relative\ncosts in the district, the number of students with special needs, and the number of\ncorrespondence students.8 The base student allocation is a per-student allowance set by\na statute that the legislature periodically revisits.9\n\n\n\n\n(...continued)\nfrom local sources to maintain and operate the district.”). By contrast, the legislature\nfunds districts located in the regional educational attendance areas, which lack taxing\nauthority. Id.

Prior Proceedings\n              Ketchikan Gateway Borough is an organized borough that must annually\ncontribute to fund its schools under AS 14.12.020.19 The required payment, set by the\nschool funding formula,20 supports the Ketchikan Gateway Borough School District. In\n2013, the district’s “basic need” for the upcoming 2014 fiscal year was almost\n$26 million; the required local contribution was about $4.2 million. Though the Borough\ncontributed this amount “under protest,” it voluntarily contributed an additional $3.8\nmillion. After contributing the funds, the Borough brought suit against the State, asking\nthe superior court, first, to declare the required local contribution unconstitutional;\nsecond, to enjoin the State from requiring the Borough to comply with the statute; and,\n\n       17\n              AS 14.17.410(b)(2).\n       18\n              AS 14.17.410(c)(1)–(2).\n       19\n               AS 14.12.020(c) (“The borough assembly for a borough school district\n. . . shall provide the money that must be raised from local sources to maintain and\noperate the district.”).

Both parties moved\nfor summary judgment.\n              The superior court partially granted the Borough’s motion. It agreed with\nthe Borough that the required local contribution violated the dedicated funds clause\nunder article IX, section 7 of the state constitution. The dedicated funds clause provides:\n              The proceeds of any state tax or license shall not be dedicated\n              to any special purpose, except as provided in section 15 of\n              this article or when required by the federal government for\n              state participation in federal programs. This provision shall\n              not prohibit the continuance of any dedication for special\n              purposes existing upon the date of ratification of this section\n              by the people of Alaska.[21]\nThe superior court concluded that the required local contribution constituted the proceeds\nof a state tax or license; that the local contribution statute earmarked those funds for a\nspecific purpose and prevented the legislature from using the funds in any other manner;\nand that the required local contribution was not exempt from the constitutional\nprohibition against dedicated funds.\n              The superior court denied summary judgment on the Borough’s other\nclaims. It concluded that the local contribution did not violate the appropriations or\ngovernor’s veto clauses and that equity did not require the State to refund the local\ncontribution to the Borough for the 2014 fiscal year.\n              The appropriations clause under article IX, section 13 provides: “No\nmoney shall be withdrawn from the treasury except in accordance with appropriations\nmade by law. No obligation for the payment of money shall be incurred except as\nauthorized by law. Unobligated appropriations outstanding at the end of the period of\n\n\n\n\n       21\n              Alaska Const. art. IX, § 7.\n\n                                            -7-                                      7075\n\ftime specified by law shall be void.”22 And the governor’s veto clause under article II,\nsection 15 provides: “The governor may veto bills passed by the legislature. He may,\nby veto, strike or reduce items in appropriation bills. He shall return any vetoed bill,\nwith a statement of his objections, to the house of origin.”23 The court concluded that\nneither clause was violated because the required local contribution “does not enter the\nstate treasury” and because the required local contribution is not an appropriation. The\ncourt further concluded that it was unproblematic that the required local contribution\nnever entered the state treasury. In denying the Borough’s request for a refund, the court\nexplained that the State was not unjustly enriched because the required local contribution\ndid not benefit the State.\n              The State appealed and the Borough cross-appealed, together asking us to\nconsider all four prongs of the superior court’s decision: whether the required local\ncontribution is unconstitutional under the dedicated funds, appropriations, or governor’s\nveto clauses and, if so, whether equity requires refunding the Borough’s protested\npayment.24\n\n\n       22\n              Alaska Const. art.

Accordingly it concludes that the\nrequired local contribution violates the dedicated funds clause. First the Borough claims\nthat before statehood, “municipalities exercised independent judgment and discretion as\nto what they could afford to pay for schools” and notes that “cities were not required to\nprovide any particular amount to the school districts.” Second the Borough argues that\nthe refund amount that cities received from the Territory “depended on how much was\nappropriated by the Legislature for such purpose.”\n              However, as we explain below, the required local contribution is the most\nrecent iteration of a longstanding state-local cooperative program in which local\ncommunities and the State share responsibility for funding Alaska’s public schools.\nAccordingly, whether or not it is a dedication that predated statehood, the required local\ncontribution is not a “state tax or license” within the meaning of the dedicated funds\nclause.\n\n\n\n\n       31\n              See §§ 37-3-31 to -33, 37-3-41, 37-3-62 Alaska Compiled Laws Annotated\n(ACLA) (1949).

Under the Alaska\nCompiled Laws of 1949, each city constituted a single school district and each had an\nobligation to provide public school services.34 An incorporated city also could join with\nadjacent areas to form an independent school district.35 Local school boards, which\noversaw local school activities, had the power to assess, levy, and collect taxes to assist\nwith this obligation to support their schools.36 Though territorial law did not dictate an\nexact funding amount, it required cities to provide “suitable school houses . . . and . . .\nthe necessary funds to maintain [local] public schools”37 or, if part of an independent\nschool district, to set aside funding for their share of local school costs.38 Like today,\nlocal communities enjoyed discretion in determining how to satisfy their funding\nobligation. They could dedicate a special school tax to the purpose, or they could\n\n\n\n\n       34\n             See § 37-3-32 ACLA (“Every city shall constitute a school district and it\nshall be the duty of the [city] council to provide the [school district] with . . . the\nnecessary funds to maintain public schools . . . .”).\n       35\t\n              Id. § 37-3-41.\n       36\n                Id. §§ 37-3-24 to -26, 37-3-32, 37-3-53; see also id. § 37-3-33 (establishing\nauthorized expenditures by the school board).

Territorial law provided for the legislature to refund a portion of local school\nexpenses from time to time.41 The amount local communities received reflected a\nstatutory formula that considered factors like the number of students in the district, the\ntotal amount the district spent to maintain its school system, and the expenses the\nTerritory had approved in the district’s budget.42 Thus before Alaska became a state,\nlocal communities and the Territory together supported local schools, much like today.\n\n\n       39\n              Id. § 37-3-35; see AS 14.17.990(6) (defining “local contribution”).\n       40\n              §§ 37-3-55, 37-3-63 ACLA.\n       41\n              Id. §§ 37-3-61 to -62.

Id. at 2416.

The delegates recognized, for example, that dedications should be allowed\nwhen required to participate in federal programs and when such dedications preexisted\nstatehood. One such draft provided:\n              All tax revenues shall be deposited in a general fund to be\n              established and maintained by the state. This provision shall\n              not prohibit the continuance of any special fund for special\n              purposes existing at the effective date of the constitution.[46]\nA subsequent draft modified the first sentence: “All revenues shall be deposited in the\nState treasury without allocation for special purposes, except where state participation\nin Federal programs will thereby be denied,”47 and preserved the exemption for\nallocations in existence at the time of statehood.48\n              But the delegates feared that this draft language might prohibit too much.49\nAccordingly they modified the clause in two key respects. First, they reworded the\nclause by replacing “[a]ll revenues” with “proceeds of any state tax or license.” Second,\nthey revised the last sentence by replacing “any special fund” with “any dedication”:\n              The proceeds of any state tax or license shall not be\n              dedicated to any special purpose, except as provided in\n              section 15 of this article or when required by the federal\n              government for state participation in federal programs.

A flat prohibition was neither feasible nor desirable.51 The\ndedicated funds clause could not be “strict[ly] interpret[ed]” because both legal and\ncontractual obligations would “require a segregation of certain moneys,” including:\n             pension contributions, proceeds from bond issues, sinking\n             fund receipts, revolving fund receipts, contributions from\n             local government units for state-local cooperative programs,\n             and tax receipts which the state might collect on behalf of\n             local government units.[52]\nDelegate White explained that the amended language allowed these exceptions to\ncontinue: “By going to the tax itself and saying that the tax shall not be earmarked, we\neliminated [the need to make explicit] all seven of those exceptions.”53\n             The colloquy among the delegates reflects this deliberate compromise\nembodied by the clause.

The thought\n              was that inducements to organize would be offered on the\n              basis of the granting of home rule powers plus certain other\n              inducements that would make it advantageous to them to be\n              boroughs, as we now have that same program of inducement\n              to organize communities.\nId.

In Alex, the program at issue was first enacted in 1976,\nnearly 20 years after Alaska became a state, and there was no evidence suggesting that\nthe program was one the delegates intended would fall outside the clause.104 The\nregional aquaculture associations, who would benefit from the assessment, were also\nestablished in 1976, long after Alaska became a state.105 Accordingly in Alex we did not\nconsider whether a longstanding state-local cooperative program was a “state tax or\nlicense” within the meaning of the dedicated funds clause.\n                     b.\t    City of Fairbanks v.

Myers v. Alaska Housing Finance Corp.\n              Another ten years passed before we again considered the dedicated funds\nclause. In Myers v. Alaska Housing Finance Corp., we upheld a legislative scheme for\nselling anticipated future state revenue from a settlement against tobacco companies so\nthat it could fund rural school improvements.120 The legislature accomplished the\nscheme in three steps: First, the legislature deemed the State’s right to future settlement\npayments to be an asset.121 As with other assets, the State could sell the future settlement\npayments for a lump sum amount that reflected the present value of the anticipated\nrevenue stream.122 Second, the legislature issued revenue bonds secured by the estimated\npresent value of the settlement.123 Finally, the legislature then appropriated a portion of\nthe bond proceeds to fund the necessary school improvements.124\n              Though the tobacco settlement fell within the scope of the dedicated funds\nclause and though the scheme dedicated future state revenue, we concluded that the\nscheme was constitutional.125 We explained that unlike Alex and Sonneman, which\nclearly dealt with the allocation of future revenues, the revenue allocation scheme in\n\n\n       120\n              </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2598794\"><a href=\"/opinion/2598794/myers-v-alaska-housing-finance-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 387-88 (Alaska 2003).\n       121\n              Id. at 388.\n       122\n              Id.\n       123\n              Id.\n       124\n              Id.\n       125\n              Id. at 390-91.\n\n                                           -31-                                       7075\n\n\fMyers was different.126 The scheme in Myers reduced future revenue to present value\nand used that value to secure bonds, the proceeds of which would be dedicated to fund\nschool improvements that year.127\n                    e.       Southeast Alaska Conservation Council v. State\n             Most recently, in Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, we returned to\nthe dedicated funds clause when we struck down an act that transferred state land to the\nUniversity of Alaska and then directed that income derived from that land be held in trust\nfor the University.128 Before concluding that the act was unconstitutional, we engaged\nin a two-part inquiry. First, we concluded that proceeds from the land were within the\nscope of the clause’s reference to “proceeds of any state tax or license.”129 In doing so,\nwe reiterated our warning in Alex that the “constitution prohibits the dedication of any\nsource of revenue.”130 And we explained that, unlike Myers, the act did not contemplate\na non-recurring appropriation, which as in Myers would have been permissible under the\nclause.131\n             Second, we considered whether the University was exempt from the\ndedicated funds prohibition by virtue of an implied exception under article VII, section 2\nof the Alaska Constitution, which authorized the University to hold title to real\n\n\n\n\n       126\n             Id. at 392.\n\n       127\n             Id. at 389.\n\n       128\n             </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2515353\"><a href=\"/opinion/2515353/southeast-ak-conservation-council-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1162</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1165-66, 1177 (Alaska 2009).\n\n       129\n             Id. at 1169.\n\n       130\n             Id.

Like the other\ncases in this line, it did not address a longstanding cooperative program, like the school\nfunding program, in which local governments and the State share responsibility for\nproviding a local public service. Such programs do not violate the dedicated funds\nclause.\n              Here we are asked for the first time whether local contributions to\nlongstanding cooperative programs in which the State and local governments share\nfunding responsibility run afoul of the dedicated funds clause. The minutes of the\nconstitutional convention and the historical context of those proceedings reveal that the\ndelegates did not intend for required local contributions to such programs to be included\nin the term “state tax or license.” Today’s statutory program for funding local public\nschools falls squarely within the type of state-local cooperative programs the delegates\n\n\n\n\n       132\n                Se.

No obligation for the payment of money shall be incurred except as authorized by\nlaw. Unobligated appropriations at the end of the period of time specified by law shall\nbe void.”135 Article II, section 15, the governor’s veto clause, provides: “The governor\nmay veto bills passed by the legislature. He may, by veto, strike or reduce items in\nappropriation bills. He shall return any vetoed bill, with a statement of his objections,\nto the house of origin.”136\n                Like the dedicated funds clause, the appropriations clause and the\ngovernor’s veto clause both address how the State spends state revenue. Together the\nclauses govern the legislature’s and the governor’s “joint responsibility . . . to determine\nthe State’s spending priorities on an annual basis.”137 As with our preceding analysis,\nwe must interpret these constitutional clauses “according to reason, practicality, and\n\n\n\n       135\n                Alaska Const. art.

If we assume the required local contribution is local money as the State\ncontends, the required local contribution would not violate either the appropriations\nclause or the governor’s veto clause because these clauses address state money, not local\nmoney. On the other hand, even if we assume that the local contribution is state money\nas the Borough contends, the required local contribution still would not violate either\nclause. The local contribution never enters the state treasury, and it is never subject to\nappropriations bills. The appropriations clause, per its plain language, applies to\nwithdrawals from the state treasury, and the governor’s veto applies to appropriation\nbills.139 The required local contribution does not withdraw from the state treasury; and\nit is not an appropriation bill.\n              The Borough correctly points out that the constitutional delegates\nintentionally established a system in which both the legislature and the governor would\nconsider how to spend state money each year. But while all three clauses — the\ndedicated funds clause, appropriations clause, and governor’s veto clause — address\npower over the state budget, the plain meaning of each clause reveals three distinct\npurposes.

But like Justice Winfree, I am concerned that\nthe court was not given the opportunity to decide the dedicated funds question controlled\nby article IX, section 7 of the Alaska Constitution as presented by this appeal in the fuller\ncontext of the public schools clause of article VII, section 1 of the Alaska Constitution.\nI do not believe that this court’s opinion today necessarily determines that the State’s\nrequired local contribution would survive constitutional scrutiny under article VII,\nsection 1 — it might, it might not — but the parties intentionally did not litigate this\nquestion either in the superior court or this court, and notwithstanding pointed questions\nby several justices in oral argument inquiring into the potential application of article VII,\nsection 1, the parties adamantly insisted that constitutional provision was not in issue.\nIn my view, therefore, the question whether the State’s required local contribution is\nconstitutional under the public schools clause remains an undecided question.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -37-                                       7075\n\n\fWINFREE, Justice, concurring.\n              Statutes are presumed to be constitutional, and the party challenging a\nstatute’s constitutionality has the burden of persuasion; doubts are resolved in favor of\nconstitutionality.1 Although I have considerable doubt about the constitutionality of the\nstatutorily required local contribution (RLC) public schools funding component, I cannot\nconclude that the presumption has been overcome in this case. I therefore agree that the\nsuperior court’s primary decision — that the RLC is an unconstitutional dedicated tax\n— should be vacated. But I do not rule out an ultimate conclusion that the RLC is\nunconstitutional, as a dedicated tax or otherwise, and therefore do not join the court’s\nanalysis or decision on this point.2 In my view the question cannot be answered\ndefinitively without a full interpretation and understanding of the Alaska Constitution’s\npublic schools clause, which, apparently for strategic reasons, the parties did not\nconfront.\n              Addressing how the RLC has every appearance of a dedicated tax warrants\na brief discussion of the public schools clause. Article VII, section 1 of the Alaska\nConstitution states in relevant part: “The legislature shall by general law establish and\nmaintain a system of public schools open to all children of the State . . . .”\n              We addressed this provision in Macauley v. Hildebrand,3 when we reversed\na superior court decision allowing a borough to require that a non-consenting borough\nschool district use the borough’s centralized system for accounting control over funds\n\n         1\n              Alaskans for a Common Language, Inc. v.

First, the\n              language is mandatory, not permissive. Second, the section\n              not only requires that the legislature “establish” a school\n              system, but also gives to that body the continuing obligation\n              to “maintain” the system. Finally, the provision is\n              unqualified; no other unit of government shares\n              responsibility or authority.[8]\nWe later confirmed that article VII, section 1’s mandate that the legislature establish and\n\n\n\n\n       4\n              Id. at 121-22.\n       5\n              Id. at 121.\n       6\n              Cf.

We also noted that the legislature’s delegation of “certain educational\nfunctions” to local school boards “does not diminish this constitutionally mandated state\ncontrol over education.” Id.\n\n                                           -39-                                      7075\n\n\fmaintain a public schools system has a dual nature: “It imposes a [constitutional] duty\nupon the state legislature, and it confers upon Alaska school age children a\n[constitutional] right to education.”9\n              In what otherwise is a vacuum the RLC has all the hallmarks of an\nunconstitutional dedicated tax. The RLC is a State-imposed mandate that municipalities\nraise specified funds for the State’s public schools system; it is a revenue source for the\nState — and a tax by any other name remains a tax10 — and the revenues are dedicated\nto the State’s public schools system even though they never enter the State’s treasury.11\n              I find unpersuasive the court’s conclusion that the RLC is exempt from the\ndedicated tax prohibition because it is a post-statehood continuation of a territorial\ndedicated tax or a cooperative effort to establish and maintain public schools. First, the\nRLC was not a part of the territorial municipal school funding system. (The territorial\ntax dedicated to schools discussed at the constitutional convention was a tobacco tax\nearmarked for school construction.12) In the territorial system municipal school districts\nwere required to determine their own budgets and local tax-funding levels, but were\npromised some level of territorial reimbursement.         Now the State determines a\nfoundational “basic need” for all school districts and requires municipalities to fund\nspecific amounts of that “basic need” in their school districts. The territorial system did\nnot include a dedicated tax on municipalities; the current system appears to do so.\n\n\n         9\n              Hootch v. Alaska State-Operated Sch.

It is difficult to understand how mandatory\ndelegation of functions and municipal funding for the State’s public schools system can\nbe a cooperative effort. More importantly, the court misperceives our earlier discussion\nabout funding cooperative efforts — we did not suggest the framers approved of a state\ntax dedicated to a cooperative effort, but rather approved of dedicating State revenues,\nafter they reach the State treasury, to a cooperative effort (and other uses of revenues).13\n              What then gives me pause? By apparent design, the tail may be wagging\nthe dog — the parties appear to be using the dedicated tax clause to define the public\nschools clause’s limits.\n              If we focus solely on the constitutional prohibition of dedicated taxes and\nconclude that the RLC is a dedicated tax, we may be inferentially but necessarily\nconcluding that the public schools clause is a constitutional mandate that the State alone\nmust provide the funds necessary to meet at least minimum constitutional requirements\nfor the statewide unified public schools system.14          Under this view municipal\ncontributions to local public schools may not be compelled, but may be volunteered to\nsupplement State funding to enhance local educational opportunities. This would be a\nremarkable conclusion to reach without ever considering the public schools clause.15\n\n       13\n              Alex, 646 P.2d at 209-10.\n       14\n               Cf.

Alex, 646 P.2d at 210-11, we concluded that the\nlegislature’s general constitutional authority over natural resources could not be\nconstrued to override the constitutional prohibition of a dedicated tax, an analysis that\n                                                                            (continued...)\n\n                                           -41-                                       7075\n\n\f              I certainly do not suggest that this interpretation of the public schools clause\nwould be incorrect. Looking only at the constitutional language and our limited case\nlaw, a credible argument can be made that the constitution requires funding the public\nschools system in a significantly different manner than in territorial days.16 The\nconstitution mandates that the State, through the legislature, “establish and maintain” a\npublic schools system,17 and our case law establishes both that it is a unified public\nschools system18 and that “no other unit of government” shares the State’s obligation.19\nThis seems inconsistent with a RLC; if the current RLC is allowable, the State\ntheoretically could craft a RLC compelling a municipality to pay for all of its public\nschools system costs without any State contribution whatsoever.20\n\n\n         15\n             (...continued)\nmay apply in this context as well.

But this also seems inconsistent with\nthe subsequent constitutional directive that the State, through the legislature, establish\nand maintain a statewide public schools system.\n              An interesting question not before us is whether the State could avoid its\nconstitutional obligation to maintain a statewide unified public schools system by\nrefusing to fund school operations if a municipality does not comply with the RLC\nmandate. See AS 14.17.410(d) (providing that if the RLC is not made, the State will not\n                                                                          (continued...)\n\n                                             -42-                                       7075\n\n\f              On the other hand the public schools clause does not expressly provide that\nthe State must fund the statewide public schools system.21 Before statehood the territory\ndid not alone fund municipal schools,22 and there was little discussion of the public\nschools clause at the constitutional convention.23 And as the court notes, shortly after\nstatehood the legislature created a public schools funding framework inconsistent with\nthe notion that the State is solely obligated to fund the public schools system.24 Perhaps,\nas the court concludes — but not for its stated reasons — the RLC is constitutionally\nviable.

If the\npublic schools clause allows the legislature to require local funding for the statewide\nunified schools system, then, depending on its parameters for requiring local funding, the\nRLC may or may not be an unconstitutional dedicated tax. But, deliberately, the\ninterpretation of the public schools clause was not litigated in the superior court and,\ntherefore, was not meaningfully briefed in this appeal.
