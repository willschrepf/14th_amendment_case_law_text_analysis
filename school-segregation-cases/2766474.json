After a disposition hearing, the jury determined that D.T.\r\nwas in need of rehabilitation and could not be provided the quality of care and level of support and\r\nsupervision that he would need to meet the conditions of probation.  The verdict on disposition\r\nwas a commitment to the Texas Youth Commission (TYC) for a period of ten years with the\r\npossibility of transfer to prison.  There is no indication in the record that D.T. appealed this\r\ndecision.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Almost two years later, in October of 2002, TYC referred D.T. to the court for approval of\r\nhis transfer to prison.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex. Hum. Res. Code Ann</span>. § 61.079 (Vernon 2001).  D.T. was 17\r\nyears old at the time of the referral.  The court conducted a release/transfer hearing and ordered\r\nD.T. transferred to prison to serve the remainder of his ten year sentence.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex. Fam. Code\r\nAnn</span>. § 54.11 (Vernon Supp. 2004).  We affirm the court’s order.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span>Abuse of Discretion</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>In his sole issue on appeal, D.T. contends the court abused its discretion in transferring him\r\nto prison due to no evidence or insufficient evidence.  Specifically, he contends that the TYC\r\nrepresentative could not provide the court with evidence supporting the Commission’s\r\nrecommendation and that TYC did not provide him with adequate opportunity or resources for\r\nrehabilitation.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>At a transfer/release hearing the court may consider written reports from probation officers,\r\nprofessional court employees, professional consultants, or employees of TYC, in addition to the\r\ntestimony of witnesses.  <span>Tex. Fam. Code Ann</span>. § 54.11(d) (Vernon Supp. 2004).  The court may\r\nalso consider the experiences and character of the person before and after commitment to the youth\r\ncommission, the nature of the penal offense that the person was found to have committed and the\r\nmanner in which the offense was committed, the abilities of the person to contribute to society,\r\nthe protection of the victim of the offense or any member of the victim's family, the\r\nrecommendations of the youth commission and prosecuting attorney, the best interests of the\r\nperson, and any other factor relevant to the issue to be decided.  <span>Tex. Fam. Code Ann</span>. §\r\n54.11(k) (Vernon Supp. 2004).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>But the court is not required to consider all of the factors, and it is expressly allowed to\r\nconsider unlisted but relevant factors.  <i>In re C.L., Jr.</i>, 874 S.W.2d 880, 886 (Tex. App.—Austin\r\n1994, no pet.).  Evidence of each listed factor is not required.  <i>Id</i>.  Similarly, the court may assign\r\ndifferent weights to the factors it considers.  <i>Id</i>.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>We will follow the existing case law which uniformly holds that, when reviewing the trial\r\ncourt's decision to transfer a juvenile from TYC to prison, the reviewing court employs an abuse\r\nof discretion standard. <i> In re C.D.T.</i>, 98 S.W.3d 280, 283 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2003,\r\npet. denied); <i>In re T.D.H.</i>, 971 S.W.2d 606, 610 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1998, no pet.).  The\r\nreviewing court must view the entire record to determine if the trial court acted without reference\r\nto guiding rules and in an arbitrary manner.  <i>C.D.T</i>., 98 S.W.3d at 283; <i>T.D.H</i>., 971 S.W.2d at\r\n610.  An abuse of discretion does not exist if the court bases its decision on conflicting evidence. \r\n<i>J.R.W. v. State</i>, 879 S.W.2d 254, 257 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1994, no writ).  And we do not review\r\nfactual issues under legal or factual insufficiency standards.  <i>Id</i>.<br>\r\n<span><i>Evidence</i></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The court heard testimony from Leonard Cucolo, the TYC court liaison, a juvenile probation\r\nofficer, D.T., his mother, and his pastor.  The court also took into consideration 4 exhibits of\r\nTYC documents and one report from TYC summarizing the Commission’s position.  The court\r\nnoted that it had these five exhibits for a month.  All five exhibits were admitted into evidence\r\nwithout objection.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>D.T.’s behavior at TYC was less than model.  The record showed that D.T., in 22 months\r\nin placement, had at least 173 documented incidents of misconduct which included self-referrals,\r\ndisruption of the program, and assaultive behavior.  He was segregated from the general\r\npopulation and placed in a security unit 22 times due to the seriousness of the misconduct or for\r\nhis uncooperative behavior.  According to TYC’s written summary, the last time D.T. was placed\r\nin the security unit was in November, a month after his referral to juvenile court.  In December,\r\nhe spat at a staff member.  D.T. denied most of the reported misconduct incidents, contending that\r\nthe staff lied about him.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>In addition to this evidence, there was conflicting testimony regarding in what “phase” D.T.\r\nwas currently placed.  The phases ranged from zero, being poor, to four, being the highest phase\r\nobtainable while confined.  Cucolo initially testified that D.T. was in phase one.  He later checked\r\nthe documents admitted and discovered that as of November, the last time documents were\r\ncompiled, D.T. was in phase two.  D.T. had just been demoted from phase three.  D.T. testified\r\nthat as of the hearing, he was in phase three.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>At the time of his referral to the juvenile court, D.T.’s academic progress fluctuated.  He had\r\nan I.Q. of 114 but had not obtained a G.E.D. and had only earned two credits toward his high\r\nschool diploma.  D.T. contended that he took the G.E.D. in November and graduated in\r\nDecember.  He admitted, though, that he accomplished this after his referral back to court.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>According to the documentary evidence before the court, D.T. never rose above a phase 2 in\r\nhis correctional therapy.  He did not complete his assignments necessary to be promoted to phase\r\n3.  And he would not admit his responsibility for the offense he was found to have committed. \r\nAt the hearing, D.T. accepted responsibility.  The TYC reports also indicated that D.T. showed\r\na lack of empathy for his victims.  His primary service worker could not recommend specialized\r\ntreatment for D.T. because he had not made sufficient progress in the general resocialization\r\nprogram.  The last psychological evaluation conducted on D.T. concluded that D.T. was\r\nunmotivated and was unlikely to benefit from additional treatment in TYC.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>TYC unanimously recommended that D.T. be transferred to prison.  The prosecutor echoed\r\nthat recommendation.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>D.T. contends that Cucolo did not testify about all the factors listed in the family code and\r\nwas incorrect in what he did testify about.  As we stated earlier, the State is not required to\r\nproduce evidence on all the listed factors.  And, an abuse of discretion does not exist if the court\r\nbases its decision on conflicting evidence.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>D.T. also contends that TYC did not provide him with the opportunity to advance in his\r\nbehavior and treatment because it did not place him in a specialized sex offender program.  The\r\nEllis County Juvenile Probation Department and an early psychological evaluation recommended\r\nsuch treatment.  However, D.T. had been afforded the opportunity to participate in a sex offender\r\nprogram in Dallas before his commitment to TYC.  After almost five months, D.T. made little\r\nprogress toward successful completion of the program.  D.T. had limited participation in the\r\nprogram and his parents were uninvolved in his treatment.  Generally, his parents were\r\nuncooperative with the juvenile justice system.  But because D.T. had not progressed in the\r\ngeneral resocialization program at TYC, he was not a candidate for the sex offender’s program.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><i><span>Application</span></i></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>After reviewing the entire record, we hold that the court did not abuse its discretion.

D.T. testified\r\nthat as of the hearing, he was in phase three.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>At the time of his referral to the juvenile court, D.T.’s academic progress fluctuated.  He had\r\nan I.Q. of 114 but had not obtained a G.E.D. and had only earned two credits toward his high\r\nschool diploma.  D.T. contended that he took the G.E.D. in November and graduated in\r\nDecember.  He admitted, though, that he accomplished this after his referral back to court.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>According to the documentary evidence before the court, D.T. never rose above a phase 2 in\r\nhis correctional therapy.  He did not complete his assignments necessary to be promoted to phase\r\n3.  And he would not admit his responsibility for the offense he was found to have committed. \r\nAt the hearing, D.T. accepted responsibility.  The TYC reports also indicated that D.T. showed\r\na lack of empathy for his victims.  His primary service worker could not recommend specialized\r\ntreatment for D.T. because he had not made sufficient progress in the general resocialization\r\nprogram.  The last psychological evaluation conducted on D.T. concluded that D.T. was\r\nunmotivated and was unlikely to benefit from additional treatment in TYC.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>TYC unanimously recommended that D.T. be transferred to prison.  The prosecutor echoed\r\nthat recommendation.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>D.T. contends that Cucolo did not testify about all the factors listed in the family code and\r\nwas incorrect in what he did testify about.  As we stated earlier, the State is not required to\r\nproduce evidence on all the listed factors.  And, an abuse of discretion does not exist if the court\r\nbases its decision on conflicting evidence.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>D.T. also contends that TYC did not provide him with the opportunity to advance in his\r\nbehavior and treatment because it did not place him in a specialized sex offender program.  The\r\nEllis County Juvenile Probation Department and an early psychological evaluation recommended\r\nsuch treatment.  However, D.T. had been afforded the opportunity to participate in a sex offender\r\nprogram in Dallas before his commitment to TYC.  After almost five months, D.T. made little\r\nprogress toward successful completion of the program.  D.T. had limited participation in the\r\nprogram and his parents were uninvolved in his treatment.  Generally, his parents were\r\nuncooperative with the juvenile justice system.  But because D.T. had not progressed in the\r\ngeneral resocialization program at TYC, he was not a candidate for the sex offender’s program.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><i><span>Application</span></i></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>After reviewing the entire record, we hold that the court did not abuse its discretion.
