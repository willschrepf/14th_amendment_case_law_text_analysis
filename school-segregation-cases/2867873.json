The answer to that\nquestion turns on what, if any, collateral consequences flow\nfrom the fact that, in the first suit, the district court denied\nplaintiff's motion to join, as additional parties plaintiff, the\nindividual and the corporation that subsequently initiated\nthe second suit. Relying both on res judicata principles and\non New Jersey's entire controversy doctrine, the defendant\nmoved to dismiss the second suit. The district court found\nthe entire controversy doctrine inapplicable, but concluded\nthat res judicata principles were applicable and mandated\ndismissal. Our review of the procedural history of these\nlinked cases yields the following conclusions: we agree with\nthe district court's entire controversy analysis but disagree\nwith its res judicata analysis; accordingly, we reverse the\ndistrict court's judgment dismissing the second suit.\n\n                    2\n\fI.\n\nIn order to explicate the issues posed by this appeal it\nwill be necessary to examine the procedural history of these\ntwo suits in some detail. Plaintiff-appellants in the case at\nbar -- the second of the two suits -- are Ralph Venuto and\nAutomotive Management Systems, Inc. (\"AMS\"). Venuto is\nsole shareholder and president of Lightning Lube, Inc.\n(\"Lube\"), a franchisor of quick-oil-change businesses.\nVenuto is also sole shareholder and president of AMS. AMS\noperated some of Lube's franchises, and both AMS and\nVenuto obtained sites for Lube's other franchisees, acting\nas either landlord or loan guarantor.1 Defendant-appellee in\nthe case at bar is Witco Corporation, Lube's motor oil\nsupplier.\n\nIn 1987, Lube brought a diversity suit (\"Lube I\") in federal\ncourt in New Jersey against Witco.2 The dispute now before\nthis court had its origins in 1988, when Lube moved to\namend its Lube I complaint by, among other changes,\nadding Venuto and AMS as additional plaintiffs. Witco\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. According to the original complaint in the case at bar, AMS is Lube's\nparent, with the two corporations sharing a principal place of business.\nThe first amended complaint, however, (1) makes no mention of an AMS-\nLube parent-subsidiary relationship, and (2) states that AMS's principal\nplace of business is Venuto's residence.\n\n2. The gravamen of Lube's claim in Lube I was that Witco, acting through\na division (Kendall Refining Co.), had attempted to destroy Lube. On\nappeal, this court, speaking through Judge Greenberg, described that\ncase as follows:\n\nLightning Lube accused Witco of breaching its supply agreement\nand destroying Lightning Lube's relationship with its franchisees to\nbenefit a competing quick-lube business that Witco had started with\nAvis Services, Inc. (Avis). Witco's actions allegedly caused Lighting\nLube's existing franchisees either to abandon it or to hold back\npayment of royalty fees and resulted in large numbers of prospective\nfranchisees never opening Lightning Lube centers. As a result,\nLightning Lube lacked the cash flow necessary to continue operating\nand its owner, Ralph Venuto, was forced to sell its assets to another\ncompany for far less than their true worth.\n\nLightning Lube, Inc. v. Witco Corp., 4 F.3d 1153, 1161 (3d Cir. 1993). In\nthat suit, Venuto and AMS were joined by Witco as third-party\ndefendants.\n\n                   3\n\fopposed the motion to amend, arguing that the motion was\nfiled over two months after the deadline for amending the\npleadings had passed and that the additional claims would\ngreatly prolong discovery.\n\nAt a hearing on the motion, the parties and then-\nMagistrate Judge Simandle,3 who was overseeing pretrial\nproceedings on behalf of Judge Rodriguez, discussed at\nlength the consequences of a denial of Lube's motion to\namend. Lube's then-counsel, Steven M. Kramer, asked\n\"What good it is to the judicial system to force me today,\nbefore I leave the courtroom[,] to take the amended\ncomplaint, tear it off, put a summons in front of it and file\nit downstairs for a second lawsuit?\" App. 306. Witco's then-\ncounsel, Benjamin D. Leibowitz, responded shortly\nthereafter, \"I'd say, yes, Mr. Kramer, go downstairs and file\nthat other complaint,\" arguing that the addition of the new\nparties would prolong already difficult and protracted\ndiscovery. App. 309. Mr. Leibowitz later observed that Mr.\nKramer could \"throw rocks in both courts at us, and he's\nnot going to lose anything by the other complaint not being\ntied into this action because the claims he's going to make\nthere, presumably, would be whatever they are.\" App. 314.\nJudge Simandle then confirmed that Mr. Leibowitz meant\nwhat he said:\n\nTHE COURT: Now, a moment ago you argued that\nyour your [sic] client at this point would prefer at this\npoint to defend second [sic] lawsuit. Mr. Kramer could\ngo to the office and file on behalf of his client, which\ncontains each and every count, and you don't dispute\nthat?\n\nMR. LEIBOWITZ: I don't dispute it.\n\nTHE COURT: Why would that serve your client's\ninterests? Or was that more of a rhetorical argument?\n\nApp. 320-21. Mr. Leibowitz's lengthy response included the\nfollowing two statements:\n\nListen, Mr. Kramer will have the benefit of thefirst\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. In 1992, Judge Simandle became a Judge of the United States District\nCourt for the District of New Jersey.\n\n                    4\n\fcase and second case, if he losses [sic], he's going to be\nable to go before the jury, looking, res ajudicata, a\njudgment was entered against Kendall Refining\nCompany because it did this and here's the complaint.\nThen how much work is he going to have to do? If he\nhas a complaint for bad faith, that will make this case.\nIt's even more advantageous for Mr. Kramer to get this\ncase over with and to have a second case.\n\nApp. 324.\n\nAnd when we get this case over, Mr. Kramer is either\ngoing to skate into a second case with a jury award and\nhe's going to say, see, here's their bad faith, and it's\ngoing to reduce a lot of work, or we're going to go in\nthere, and he's [sic] going to say, you had nothing then\nand you don't have anything now, and the disposition\nof this case, as it stands now can proceed more\nexpeditiously, and will in fact directly affect the\noutcome of that second case.\n\nThere's no question that the issues that are subject\nto res ajudicata are going to be res ajudicata in the\nsecond case. Under the circumstances, what we're\nsaying is Mr. Kramer might be well advised. I don't\nknow what the statute of limitations is, or if he has a\nstatute of limitations problem, to wait for the outcome\nof this case, and the discovery from this case, the\nparties could stipulate to be used in the other case, to\nthe extent that it becomes relevant in the other case.\n\nApp. 327-28.\n\nJudge Simandle later issued a letter opinion and order\ngranting the motion to amend in part but denying the\nportion of the motion seeking to add Venuto and AMS as\nplaintiffs. He reasoned that Lube had delayed too long\nwithout explanation in moving to amend, and that\nintroducing additional plaintiffs and claims would unduly\ncomplicate the case given the amount of discovery already\ncompleted. The order specifically provided, however, that\nthe denial was \"without prejudice.\" Judge Simandle later\ndenied Lube's motion for reconsideration.\n\nShortly thereafter, Venuto and AMS (hereinafter together\n\n                    5\n\f\"Venuto\") filed the complaint against Witco in the instant\ncase (which we shall call \"Lube II\"). 4 Lube II was assigned to\nJudge Rodriguez, the judge presiding over Lube I. Judge\nRodriguez then affirmed Judge Simandle's denial of Lube's\nmotion for reconsideration in Lube I, and stayed any action\nin Lube II pending the outcome of Lube I.\n\nLube went on to win a $61.5 million jury verdict from\nWitco in Lube I, $50 million of which consisted of punitive\ndamages. The district court struck the $50 million punitive\ndamage award and reduced the compensatory damages\naward to approximately $9.5 million. This court affirmed.\nSee Lightning Lube, Inc. v. Witco Corp., 4 F.3d 1153 (3d Cir.\n1993).\n\nAfter Lube I was decided on appeal, the district court\nlifted the stay in Lube II for the purpose of allowing Venuto\nto file his first amended complaint and allowing Witco to file\na motion to dismiss. Witco's motion to dismiss asserted\nthat the action was barred by (1) New Jersey's entire\ncontroversy doctrine and (2) res judicata. Because both\nsides relied on materials outside the pleadings, the court\ntreated Witco's motion as a motion for summary judgment\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56.\n\nThe district court held that the action was not barred by\nthe entire controversy doctrine. The court reasoned that\nJudge Simandle might have \"intended to permit the second\naction in light of the defendant's apparent support of a\nsecond action,\" thus apparently preserving Venuto's claims\nfor purposes of the entire controversy doctrine.\n\nThe district court went on to conclude that Lube II was\nnonetheless barred by res judicata -- which we understand\nto mean claim preclusion, as distinct from issue preclusion.5\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. Lightning Lube, Inc., was originally a plaintiff in Lube II, but was\ndropped as a party plaintiff in the First Amended Complaint, filed in\n1994.\n\n5. The term \"res judicata\" has both a broad and a narrow meaning.\nNarrowly, in the sense evidently used by Judge Rodriguez, it refers only\nto claim preclusion. Our use of the term in this opinion likewise relates\nonly to the claim preclusion aspect of res judicata doctrine. However, the\npreferred usage of the term encompasses both claim and issue\n\n                    6\n\fThe court determined that Venuto was in privity with\nLightning Lube, the plaintiff in Lube I. It then compared the\ncounts in the Lube II amended complaint with the\ntransactions at issue in Lube I, and concluded that they\nwere based on the same \"cause of action.\" With these two\nelements, and the uncontested fact that Lube I was decided\non the merits, the court concluded that Lube II was barred\nby res judicata.6\n\nVenuto now appeals this decision. The district court had\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332; we have\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. Our review of the\ndistrict court's application of res judicata rules and the\nentire controversy doctrine is plenary. See Lubrizol Corp. v.\nExxon Corp., 929 F.2d 960, 962 (3d Cir. 1991).\n\nII.\n\nWe turn first to whether the district court properly\ndetermined that Venuto's claims are barred by res judicata.\nIn Lubrizol, this court had occasion to discuss the question\nwhether federal or state res judicata law governs successive\ndiversity actions, but we declined to decide the issue\n\"because our holding would be the same under both federal\nand state law.\" Lubrizol, 929 F.2d at 963. In this case as\nwell, we find that the same result would be arrived at under\nfederal and state res judicata law, and therefore we once\nagain need not decide the choice of law question.7\n_________________________________________________________________\n\npreclusion. See, e.g., Migra v. Warren City School Dist. Bd. of Educ., 465\nU.S. 75, 77 n.1 (1984); 18 Wright, Miller & Cooper, Federal Practice and\nProcedure, § 4402, at 8 (1981). Issue preclusion, or collateral estoppel, is\nnot an issue in this case as presented on appeal, but may be an issue\non remand. See text accompanying note 13, infra.\n\n6. The court also considered and rejected Venuto's argument that Witco\nshould be judicially estopped from pleading res judicata because of its\nstatements to Judge Simandle at the hearing on Lube's motion to\namend. The court noted that Witco's counsel had referred to res judicata\nand had observed that \"Mr. Kramer might be well advised.\" The court\nconcluded that \"[b]ecause there was no misrepresentation by Witco with\nregard to the res judicata defense, it is entitled to assert it.\"\n\n7. Since Lubrizol, this court has on one occasion applied state res\njudicata law to successive diversity actions. See Collins v. E.I. DuPont de\n\n                    7\n\fThe district court concluded that Witco had established\nthe elements necessary for a res judicata defense. We\nassume that the district court's findings were correct.\nNonetheless, because Judge Simandle expressly preserved\nVenuto's and AMS's claims for a future action through\ndenying the motion to amend \"without prejudice,\" we will\nreverse.\n\nVenuto relies on the Restatement (Second) of Judgments\n§ 26, as well as federal and New Jersey case law. The\nRestatement provides as follows:\n\n(1) When any of the following circumstances exists, the\ngeneral rule of § 24 [the Restatement's general rule\nprohibiting claim splitting] does not apply to extinguish\nthe claim, and part or all of the claim subsists as a\npossible basis for a second action by the plaintiff\nagainst the defendant:\n\n(a) The parties have agreed in terms or in effect that\nthe plaintiff may split his claim, or the defendant has\nacquiesced therein; or\n\n(b) The court in the first action has expressly reserved\nthe plaintiff's right to maintain the second action . . . .\n\nRestatement (Second) of Judgments § 26 (1982). The\ncommentary to subsection (1)(b) provides, in relevant part,\nthat\n\n[a] determination by the court that its judgment is\n\"without prejudice\" (or words to that effect) to a second\naction on the omitted part of the claim, expressed in\nthe judgment itself, or in the findings of fact,\nconclusions of law, opinion, or similar record, unless\nreversed or set aside, should ordinarily be given effect\nin the second action.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nNemours & Co., 34 F.3d 172, 176 (3d Cir. 1994). This court has also\napplied \"the law of the adjudicating state [i.e., the Virgin Islands]\" when\na prior action was brought in the District Court of the Virgin Islands\nunder both federal and Virgin Islands law. See Huck ex rel. Sea Air\nShuttle Corp. v. Dawson, 106 F.3d 45, 48 (3d Cir. 1997), petition for cert.\nfiled, 65 U.S.L.W. 3755 (U.S. May 1, 1997) (No. 96-1741). But those\nopinions did not discuss the choice of law question, and we therefore\nregard the question as still an open one.\n\n                     8\n\fId. § 26 cmt. b.8\n\nAlthough this court has not previously had occasion to\naddress whether, as a matter of federal res judicata law, a\ncourt's decision to exclude a claim \"without prejudice\"\npreserves the claim for a second action, several other\ncircuits have addressed the issue. Each of these courts has\npermitted the second action. See Guzowski v. Hartman, 849\nF.2d 252, 255 (6th Cir. 1988); Blackwelder v. Millman, 522\nF.2d 766, 773 (4th Cir. 1975); see also King v. Provident\nLife & Accident Insurance Co., 23 F.3d 926, 929 (5th Cir.\n1994) (reversing a res judicata determination when the first\ncourt had expressly reserved certain claims); Stolberg v.\nTrustees for the State Colleges of Connecticut, 541 F.2d 890,\n893 (2d Cir. 1976) (\"If the underlying judgment had\nexplicitly provided that [a particular] issue had not been\nlitigated and the defendants were not precluded from\nraising it, there would be no question\" that res judicata\nwould not bar a second suit.); cf. Torres v. Rebarchak, 814\nF.2d 1219, 1225 (7th Cir. 1987) (concluding that Illinois\nwould apply the position of the Restatement § 26 when\nsome claims in the first suit had been dismissed \"without\nprejudice\").9\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. Professors Wright, Miller, and Cooper share the Restatement view that\nthe first court reviewing a claim has at least some power to determine\nthe preclusive effects of its judgments:\n\nDespite the general rule that a court cannot dictate preclusion\nconsequences at the time of deciding a first action, it should have\npower to narrow the ordinary rules of claim preclusion. A judgment\nthat expressly leaves open the opportunity to bring a second action\non specified parts of the claim or cause of action that was advanced\nin the first action should be effective to forestall preclusion.\n\n18 Wright, Miller, and Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure, § 4413, at\n106 (1981 & Supp. 1997).\n\n9. The only court of appeals opinion to the contrary that we have\nidentified is one that was decided on the basis of state law; moreover,\nthe case arose in an unusual procedural setting not present here. In\nAbramson v. Harbor Island Marina, Inc., 816 F.2d 975 (4th Cir. 1987), a\nstate court, after a bench trial regarding a lease dispute, had declined to\naward specific performance or damages for out-of-pocket expenses, but\nhad awarded the return of the lessee's deposit,\" `without prejudice to the\n\n                    9\n\fWitco responds with three arguments why Venuto's\nclaims should be barred by res judicata. We think that\nnone of these arguments has merit. First, Witco argues that\npermitting Venuto to bring his claims after the motion to\namend was denied for untimeliness would reward delay. We\nneed not fear that applying the Restatement rule will\nreward delay: if a district court concludes that a litigant\nhas unduly delayed, it can -- and, presumably, ordinarily\nwill -- deny a motion to amend \"with prejudice.\" Here,\nhowever, despite the untimeliness of the motion, Judge\nSimandle chose to deny the motion \"without prejudice.\"\n\nWitco next argues that the denial of the motion to amend\nwas superseded by the final judgment in Lube I. It notes\nespecially that \"[n]othing about the final judgment in Lube\nI was `without prejudice' to any rights Lube or its privies\nmay have had.\" This argument is also meritless. Witco\noverlooks the established rule that interlocutory orders,\nsuch as the order denying the motion to amend without\nprejudice, merge into the final judgment. See, e.g., In re\nWestinghouse Securities Litigation, 90 F.3d 696, 706 (3d\nCir. 1996). In issuing its final judgment, a court need not\nreview all of its interlocutory orders and expressly reaffirm\ntheir continuing vitality.\n\nFinally, Witco argues that Judge Simandle's denial of\nLube's motion to amend was not an express reservation of\nVenuto's claims, and hence did not fall within the scope of\n§ 26(1)(b) of the Restatement. Witco argues that Judge\nSimandle's use of the term \"without prejudice\" was only\nintended to preserve Lube's opportunity to move to amend\nits complaint at a later time, if discovery proved to be more\nlengthy than anticipated. This interpretation strains\ncredulity. It is highly unlikely that Judge Simandle, after\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nright of either party to sue the other for damages in a Court of law.' \" Id.\nat 976. The Fourth Circuit, applying Maryland law, refused to permit a\nsecond action \"where a plaintiff has prayed for damages as part of his\nrelief and has attempted to prove his damages at trial and where the\ntrial judge has found the proof of some damages insufficient and has\nentered an award of other damages.\" Id. at 977. Needless to say, Venuto\nhas not yet had a trial nor has he been awarded partial damages on his\nclaims.\n\n                    10\n\fdenying the motion to amend because the motion was\nuntimely and because granting it would unduly delay\nresolution of Lube I, intended to indicate that he would\nentertain a second motion to amend at a later time. Rather,\nit seems clear that Judge Simandle intended to permit\nVenuto and AMS to file their claims in a separate suit, as\nhad been discussed at the argument on the motion.\n\nWe find the logic of § 26(1)(b) of the Restatement to be\npersuasive. As Professors Wright, Miller, and Cooper have\nreasoned,\n\nAn order by the first court that its judgment does not\npreclude a second suit on specified parts of the claim or\ncause of action advanced in the first suit may preserve\nvalid grounds of recovery without undue violence to the\nvalues of res judicata. The express reservation notifies\nthe defendant that repose has not yet been achieved.\nThe plaintiff may have a substantially better\nopportunity to prove the reserved claim, or to determine\nthat it is not worth litigating. For that matter, the\ndefendant may also prove better able to meet the\nunexpected theory in a second suit.\n\n18 Wright, Miller, and Cooper, Federal Practice and\nProcedure, § 4413, at 107 (1981).\n\nIn finding that logic applicable to the case at bar, we note\nthat this is not an instance in which the court's use of the\nphrase \"without prejudice\" was inadvertent. Compare\nHulmes v. Honda Motor Co., Ltd., 924 F. Supp. 673 (D.N.J.\n1996) (refusing to find a second action barred by the entire\ncontroversy doctrine, although a prior action had been\ndismissed \"with prejudice,\" in part because the phrase had\nbeen used inadvertently). Judge Simandle and Witco's\ncounsel explicitly discussed the possibility of a second\naction, and Witco's counsel stated that \"Mr. Kramer will\nhave the benefit of the first case and second case\" and \"he\ncan throw rocks in both courts at us.\" In these\ncircumstances, Judge Simandle appropriately exercised his\ndiscretion to permit Venuto to file a second action. We\n\n                    11\n\fconclude that, consonant with the federal cases cited\nabove, Venuto's claims are not barred by res judicata.10\n\nWe reach the same result applying state law. To the\nextent that New Jersey retains its own res judicata law,\nseparate from the entire controversy doctrine,11 it likewise\nallows a second suit to be brought on a claim if thefirst\ncourt dismissed the claim \"without prejudice.\" In\nWoodward-Clyde Consultants v. Chemical and Pollution\nSciences, Inc., 523 A.2d 131 (N.J. 1987), the New Jersey\nSupreme Court held that a dismissal of a counterclaim was\nwithout prejudice, and therefore assertion in a second suit\nof the claim put forward in the dismissed counterclaim was\nnot precluded by the entire controversy doctrine. The court\nintroduced its analysis as follows:\n\nA dismissal without prejudice is not an adjudication on\nthe merits and does not bar reinstitution of the same\nclaim in a later action. Malhame v. Borough of\nDemarest, 415 A.2d 358 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div.\n1980) (quoting Christiansen v. Christiansen, 134 A.2d\n14 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1957). Plaintiff contends,\nhowever, that the institution of a subsequent action\nviolates the entire controversy doctrine. We disagree.\n\n523 A.2d at 135 (citations edited). One of the cases cited,\nChristiansen v. Christiansen, involved a dismissal of one\nclaim from an earlier action \"without prejudice,\" and an\nargument that this claim was barred in a second action\nbecause of res judicata. The Christiansen court stated that\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10. Because we rely on § 26(1)(b) of the Restatement, and on cases\napplying its logic, we need not determine whether the statements of\nWitco's counsel at the Lube I hearing on the motion to amend the\ncomplaint constitute acquiescence under § 26(1)(a) of the Restatement.\n\n11. As we noted in Lubrizol, 929 F.2d at 965, New Jersey appears to\nretain a res judicata doctrine apart from the entire controversy doctrine.\nSee Culver v. Insurance Company of North America, 559 A.2d 400,\n404-06 (N.J. 1989) (explicating res judicata law). The New Jersey\nSupreme Court has noted, however, that the entire controversy doctrine\n\"attempts to avoid the delay, waste and expense of fragmented litigation\"\nand that \"[t]o this extent, the entire controversy doctrine is wholly\nconsistent with the doctrine of res judicata.\" Id. at 406.\n\n                    12\n\f[a] dismissal without prejudice is comparable to a\nnonsuit under the former practice at law. It adjudicates\nnothing. Another action may be instituted and the\nsame facts urged either alone or in company with\nothers as the basis of a claim for relief.\n\n134 A.2d at 18 (citations omitted). The Christiansen court\ntherefore concluded that the claim was not barred by res\njudicata.\n\nIt therefore seems plain that New Jersey courts recognize\nthat a dismissal of a claim without prejudice removes the\nclaim from a res judicata bar. Because both New Jersey\nand federal law are in agreement that res judicata should\nnot bar Venuto's suit, the district court's ruling on this\npoint was in error.\n\nIII.\n\nWitco argues that, even if this court concludes that the\ndistrict court erred on the res judicata issue, it should\nnonetheless affirm on the basis that Venuto's claims were\nbarred by the entire controversy doctrine.12 The entire\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12. We note that the considerations that would argue for the application\nof federal res judicata law in successive diversity actions would appear\nto argue with equal force that the entire controversy doctrine -- a\ncreature of state law -- should not be held applicable in successive\ndiversity suits. However, as already noted, this court has not yet had\noccasion to decide whether federal or state res judicata law applies in\nsuch situations. See in this connection Judge Irenas's thoughtful opinion\nin Fioriglio v. City of Atlantic City, -- F. Supp. --, 1997 WL 249234\n(D.N.J. May 6, 1997).\n\nThe New Jersey Supreme Court appears to have held that federal res\njudicata law governs a second court's actions when the first action was\nbrought in federal court, see Watkins v. Resorts Int'l Hotel and Casino,\nInc.. 591 A.2d 592. 598 (N.J. 1991) (\"the preclusive effect of the\njudgment is a function of the procedures of the federal court that\nrendered it\"); in Watkins, however, thefirst action had been a federal-\nquestion and not a diversity action. The New Jersey court has also\nstressed that New Jersey courts' application of the entire controversy\ndoctrine to bar a state court action after a previous suit was brought in\nfederal court is not binding on federal courts, stating that \"our threshold\nis not a barrier elsewhere.\" Mortgagelinq Corp. v. Commonwealth Land\n\n                    13\n\fcontroversy doctrine is codified in New Jersey Rule\nGoverning Civil Practice 4:30A. The New Jersey Supreme\nCourt has recently summarized the doctrine as follows:\n\nThe fundamental principle behind the inclusion\npolicy of the entire controversy doctrine is that the\nadjudication of a legal controversy should occur in one\nlitigation in only one court; accordingly, all parties\ninvolved in the litigation should at the very least\npresent in that proceeding all of their claims and\ndefenses that are related to the underlying controversy.\n\n....\n\nThe objectives behind the doctrine are threefold: (1) to\nencourage the comprehensive and conclusive\ndetermination of a legal controversy; (2) to achieve\nparty fairness, including both parties before the court\nas well as prospective parties; and (3) to promote\njudicial economy and efficiency by avoiding fragmented,\nmultiple and duplicative litigation.\n\nThe doctrine has evolved over time through the\ncommon law. . . . The doctrine was . . . extended to\ninclude all affirmative claims that a party might have\nagainst another party, including counterclaims and\ncross-claims, as well as all parties with a material\ninterest in the controversy, i.e., those who can affect or\nbe affected by the judicial outcome of the\ncontroversy. . . . In essence, it is the factual\ncircumstances giving rise to the controversy itself,\nrather than a commonality of claims, issues or parties,\nthat triggers the requirement of joinder to create a\ncohesive and complete litigation. . . .\n\n . . . It is for [sic] trial court to determine whether or\nnot joinder is appropriate in a given case, and thus\nlitigants should be compelled to bring all actions at one\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nTitle Ins. Co., 662 A.2d 536, 542 (N.J. 1995). See generally Stephen B.\nBurbank, Where's the Beef? The Interjurisdictional Effects of New\nJersey's Entire Controversy Doctrine, 28 Rutgers L.J. 87 (1996); Rochelle\nCooper Dreyfuss & Linda J. Silberman, Interjurisdictional Implications of\nthe Entire Controversy Doctrine, 28 Rutgers L.J. 123 (1996).\n\n                    14\n\ftime. A trial court is empowered to segregate different\nclaims to assure manageability, clarity and fairness. A\nplaintiff who fails to allow the trial court the\nopportunity to supervise the entire controversy risks\nlosing the right to bring that claim later.\n\nMystic Isle Development Corp. v. Perskie & Nehmad, 662\nA.2d 523, 529-30 (1995) (citations omitted); see also\nRycoline Products, Inc. v. C & W Unlimited, 109 F.3d 883,\n885-86 (3d Cir. 1997) (summarizing the entire controversy\ndoctrine).\n\nAs noted above in our discussion of res judicata, the New\nJersey Supreme Court held in Woodward-Clyde that a\ncourt's dismissal of a claim \"without prejudice\" authorizes\na second claim, notwithstanding the entire controversy\ndoctrine. However, in Mystic Isle the New Jersey Supreme\nCourt somewhat tightened the entire controversy doctrine.\n\nIn Mystic Isle, the court held that a second suit against\nfour defendants was barred by the entire controversy\ndoctrine, even though the first court's dismissal of the first\nsuit against one of the four defendants had been \"without\nprejudice.\" The court first distinguished Woodward-Clyde,\nstating that \"it is the party's original compliance with the\ndoctrine [by presenting all its claims to the trial court],\nrather than the absence of a conclusive determination of a\nclaim, that ensures preservation of that claim.\" 662 A.2d at\n534.\n\nThe Mystic Isle court went on to note that\n\n[i]n certain circumstances, especially where a plaintiff\nmanipulates the judicial system in order to fragment\nlitigation, the principles underlying the entire\ncontroversy doctrine may mandate that a suit be\nbarred even though it stems from the dismissal of a\nprior action without prejudice.\n\nId. (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 19 cmt. a\n(1982)). In that case, the plaintiff had \"deliberately\ncontrived to have one claim dismissed in the [first] action in\norder to circumvent the preclusive effect of the entire\ncontroversy doctrine on its subsequent . . . claim,\" id. at\n535; because of this \"manipulat[ion] of the judicial system,\"\nthe plaintiff's claim was barred.\n\n                    15\n\fWe do not find the case at bar to be the sort of case that\nshould, in the words of Mystic Isle, be\"barred even though\nit stems from the dismissal of a prior action without\nprejudice.\" The major focus of the entire controversy\ndoctrine is to bring all claims before the trial court for\ndisposition in one proceeding; once all claims are put\nforward, the \"trial court has the discretion to structure the\nlitigation to assure efficient administration, clarity and\nfairness.\" Id. at 534. Here, the plaintiff in the first suit\ncomplied with the dictates of the entire controversy doctrine\nand undertook to present all claims for the court's decision\non how best to structure the litigation. The court then\ndecided -- contrary to the plaintiff's express preference --\nthat the claims should be heard in separate suits; no\nplaintiff \"manipulation of the judicial system\" occurred.\nTherefore, the ruling of the district court in the present\ncase that this second suit is not barred by the entire\ncontroversy doctrine was correct.\n\nIV.\n\nWe conclude that Venuto's and AMS's claims against\nWitco are not barred by the claim preclusion aspect of res\njudicata or by the entire controversy doctrine. We note that\nanother aspect of res judicata -- namely, issue preclusion\nor collateral estoppel -- may be applicable to some or all of\nVenuto's and AMS's claims (and, conceivably, to some or all\nof Witco's defenses),13 but we leave these matters to the\ndistrict court. The judgment of the district court is reversed\nand the case remanded for further proceedings.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\nClerk of the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Third Circuit\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13. Witco's counsel was evidently referring to issue preclusion at the\nhearing on Lube's motion to amend its complaint, when he stated that\n\"[t]here's no question that the issues that are subject to res ajudicata are\ngoing to be res ajudicata in the second case.\" App. 328.

The answer to that\nquestion turns on what, if any, collateral consequences flow\nfrom the fact that, in the first suit, the district court denied\nplaintiff's motion to join, as additional parties plaintiff, the\nindividual and the corporation that subsequently initiated\nthe second suit. Relying both on res judicata principles and\non New Jersey's entire controversy doctrine, the defendant\nmoved to dismiss the second suit. The district court found\nthe entire controversy doctrine inapplicable, but concluded\nthat res judicata principles were applicable and mandated\ndismissal. Our review of the procedural history of these\nlinked cases yields the following conclusions: we agree with\nthe district court's entire controversy analysis but disagree\nwith its res judicata analysis; accordingly, we reverse the\ndistrict court's judgment dismissing the second suit.\n\n                    2\n\fI.\n\nIn order to explicate the issues posed by this appeal it\nwill be necessary to examine the procedural history of these\ntwo suits in some detail. Plaintiff-appellants in the case at\nbar -- the second of the two suits -- are Ralph Venuto and\nAutomotive Management Systems, Inc. (\"AMS\"). Venuto is\nsole shareholder and president of Lightning Lube, Inc.\n(\"Lube\"), a franchisor of quick-oil-change businesses.\nVenuto is also sole shareholder and president of AMS. AMS\noperated some of Lube's franchises, and both AMS and\nVenuto obtained sites for Lube's other franchisees, acting\nas either landlord or loan guarantor.1 Defendant-appellee in\nthe case at bar is Witco Corporation, Lube's motor oil\nsupplier.\n\nIn 1987, Lube brought a diversity suit (\"Lube I\") in federal\ncourt in New Jersey against Witco.2 The dispute now before\nthis court had its origins in 1988, when Lube moved to\namend its Lube I complaint by, among other changes,\nadding Venuto and AMS as additional plaintiffs. Witco\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. According to the original complaint in the case at bar, AMS is Lube's\nparent, with the two corporations sharing a principal place of business.\nThe first amended complaint, however, (1) makes no mention of an AMS-\nLube parent-subsidiary relationship, and (2) states that AMS's principal\nplace of business is Venuto's residence.\n\n2. The gravamen of Lube's claim in Lube I was that Witco, acting through\na division (Kendall Refining Co.), had attempted to destroy Lube. On\nappeal, this court, speaking through Judge Greenberg, described that\ncase as follows:\n\nLightning Lube accused Witco of breaching its supply agreement\nand destroying Lightning Lube's relationship with its franchisees to\nbenefit a competing quick-lube business that Witco had started with\nAvis Services, Inc. (Avis). Witco's actions allegedly caused Lighting\nLube's existing franchisees either to abandon it or to hold back\npayment of royalty fees and resulted in large numbers of prospective\nfranchisees never opening Lightning Lube centers. As a result,\nLightning Lube lacked the cash flow necessary to continue operating\nand its owner, Ralph Venuto, was forced to sell its assets to another\ncompany for far less than their true worth.\n\nLightning Lube, Inc. v. Witco Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"652883\"><a href=\"/opinion/652883/lightning-lube-inc-laser-lube-a-new-jersey-corporation-v-witco/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1153</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1161 (3d Cir. 1993). In\nthat suit, Venuto and AMS were joined by Witco as third-party\ndefendants.\n\n                   3\n\fopposed the motion to amend, arguing that the motion was\nfiled over two months after the deadline for amending the\npleadings had passed and that the additional claims would\ngreatly prolong discovery.\n\nAt a hearing on the motion, the parties and then-\nMagistrate Judge Simandle,3 who was overseeing pretrial\nproceedings on behalf of Judge Rodriguez, discussed at\nlength the consequences of a denial of Lube's motion to\namend. Lube's then-counsel, Steven M. Kramer, asked\n\"What good it is to the judicial system to force me today,\nbefore I leave the courtroom[,] to take the amended\ncomplaint, tear it off, put a summons in front of it and file\nit downstairs for a second lawsuit?\" App. 306. Witco's then-\ncounsel, Benjamin D. Leibowitz, responded shortly\nthereafter, \"I'd say, yes, Mr. Kramer, go downstairs and file\nthat other complaint,\" arguing that the addition of the new\nparties would prolong already difficult and protracted\ndiscovery. App. 309. Mr. Leibowitz later observed that Mr.\nKramer could \"throw rocks in both courts at us, and he's\nnot going to lose anything by the other complaint not being\ntied into this action because the claims he's going to make\nthere, presumably, would be whatever they are.\" App. 314.\nJudge Simandle then confirmed that Mr. Leibowitz meant\nwhat he said:\n\nTHE COURT: Now, a moment ago you argued that\nyour your [sic] client at this point would prefer at this\npoint to defend second [sic] lawsuit. Mr. Kramer could\ngo to the office and file on behalf of his client, which\ncontains each and every count, and you don't dispute\nthat?\n\nMR. LEIBOWITZ: I don't dispute it.\n\nTHE COURT: Why would that serve your client's\ninterests? Or was that more of a rhetorical argument?\n\nApp. 320-21. Mr. Leibowitz's lengthy response included the\nfollowing two statements:\n\nListen, Mr. Kramer will have the benefit of thefirst\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. In 1992, Judge Simandle became a Judge of the United States District\nCourt for the District of New Jersey.\n\n                    4\n\fcase and second case, if he losses [sic], he's going to be\nable to go before the jury, looking, res ajudicata, a\njudgment was entered against Kendall Refining\nCompany because it did this and here's the complaint.\nThen how much work is he going to have to do? If he\nhas a complaint for bad faith, that will make this case.\nIt's even more advantageous for Mr. Kramer to get this\ncase over with and to have a second case.\n\nApp. 324.\n\nAnd when we get this case over, Mr. Kramer is either\ngoing to skate into a second case with a jury award and\nhe's going to say, see, here's their bad faith, and it's\ngoing to reduce a lot of work, or we're going to go in\nthere, and he's [sic] going to say, you had nothing then\nand you don't have anything now, and the disposition\nof this case, as it stands now can proceed more\nexpeditiously, and will in fact directly affect the\noutcome of that second case.\n\nThere's no question that the issues that are subject\nto res ajudicata are going to be res ajudicata in the\nsecond case. Under the circumstances, what we're\nsaying is Mr. Kramer might be well advised. I don't\nknow what the statute of limitations is, or if he has a\nstatute of limitations problem, to wait for the outcome\nof this case, and the discovery from this case, the\nparties could stipulate to be used in the other case, to\nthe extent that it becomes relevant in the other case.\n\nApp. 327-28.\n\nJudge Simandle later issued a letter opinion and order\ngranting the motion to amend in part but denying the\nportion of the motion seeking to add Venuto and AMS as\nplaintiffs. He reasoned that Lube had delayed too long\nwithout explanation in moving to amend, and that\nintroducing additional plaintiffs and claims would unduly\ncomplicate the case given the amount of discovery already\ncompleted. The order specifically provided, however, that\nthe denial was \"without prejudice.\" Judge Simandle later\ndenied Lube's motion for reconsideration.\n\nShortly thereafter, Venuto and AMS (hereinafter together\n\n                    5\n\f\"Venuto\") filed the complaint against Witco in the instant\ncase (which we shall call \"Lube II\"). 4 Lube II was assigned to\nJudge Rodriguez, the judge presiding over Lube I. Judge\nRodriguez then affirmed Judge Simandle's denial of Lube's\nmotion for reconsideration in Lube I, and stayed any action\nin Lube II pending the outcome of Lube I.\n\nLube went on to win a $61.5 million jury verdict from\nWitco in Lube I, $50 million of which consisted of punitive\ndamages. The district court struck the $50 million punitive\ndamage award and reduced the compensatory damages\naward to approximately $9.5 million. This court affirmed.\nSee Lightning Lube, Inc. v. Witco Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"652883\"><a href=\"/opinion/652883/lightning-lube-inc-laser-lube-a-new-jersey-corporation-v-witco/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1153</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir.\n1993).\n\nAfter Lube I was decided on appeal, the district court\nlifted the stay in Lube II for the purpose of allowing Venuto\nto file his first amended complaint and allowing Witco to file\na motion to dismiss. Witco's motion to dismiss asserted\nthat the action was barred by (1) New Jersey's entire\ncontroversy doctrine and (2) res judicata. Because both\nsides relied on materials outside the pleadings, the court\ntreated Witco's motion as a motion for summary judgment\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56.\n\nThe district court held that the action was not barred by\nthe entire controversy doctrine. The court reasoned that\nJudge Simandle might have \"intended to permit the second\naction in light of the defendant's apparent support of a\nsecond action,\" thus apparently preserving Venuto's claims\nfor purposes of the entire controversy doctrine.\n\nThe district court went on to conclude that Lube II was\nnonetheless barred by res judicata -- which we understand\nto mean claim preclusion, as distinct from issue preclusion.5\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. Lightning Lube, Inc., was originally a plaintiff in Lube II, but was\ndropped as a party plaintiff in the First Amended Complaint, filed in\n1994.\n\n5. The term \"res judicata\" has both a broad and a narrow meaning.\nNarrowly, in the sense evidently used by Judge Rodriguez, it refers only\nto claim preclusion. Our use of the term in this opinion likewise relates\nonly to the claim preclusion aspect of res judicata doctrine. However, the\npreferred usage of the term encompasses both claim and issue\n\n                    6\n\fThe court determined that Venuto was in privity with\nLightning Lube, the plaintiff in Lube I. It then compared the\ncounts in the Lube II amended complaint with the\ntransactions at issue in Lube I, and concluded that they\nwere based on the same \"cause of action.\" With these two\nelements, and the uncontested fact that Lube I was decided\non the merits, the court concluded that Lube II was barred\nby res judicata.6\n\nVenuto now appeals this decision. The district court had\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332; we have\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. Our review of the\ndistrict court's application of res judicata rules and the\nentire controversy doctrine is plenary. See Lubrizol Corp. v.\nExxon Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558591\"><a href=\"/opinion/558591/the-lubrizol-corporation-v-exxon-corporation-and-exxon-research-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">960</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 962 (3d Cir. 1991).\n\nII.\n\nWe turn first to whether the district court properly\ndetermined that Venuto's claims are barred by res judicata.\nIn Lubrizol, this court had occasion to discuss the question\nwhether federal or state res judicata law governs successive\ndiversity actions, but we declined to decide the issue\n\"because our holding would be the same under both federal\nand state law.\" Lubrizol, 929 F.2d at 963. In this case as\nwell, we find that the same result would be arrived at under\nfederal and state res judicata law, and therefore we once\nagain need not decide the choice of law question.7\n_________________________________________________________________\n\npreclusion. See, e.g., Migra v. Warren City School Dist. Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111093\"><a href=\"/opinion/111093/migra-v-warren-city-school-dist-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 77 n.1 (1984); 18 Wright, Miller & Cooper, Federal Practice and\nProcedure, § 4402, at 8 (1981). Issue preclusion, or collateral estoppel, is\nnot an issue in this case as presented on appeal, but may be an issue\non remand. See text accompanying note 13, infra.\n\n6. The court also considered and rejected Venuto's argument that Witco\nshould be judicially estopped from pleading res judicata because of its\nstatements to Judge Simandle at the hearing on Lube's motion to\namend. The court noted that Witco's counsel had referred to res judicata\nand had observed that \"Mr. Kramer might be well advised.\" The court\nconcluded that \"[b]ecause there was no misrepresentation by Witco with\nregard to the res judicata defense, it is entitled to assert it.\"\n\n7. Since Lubrizol, this court has on one occasion applied state res\njudicata law to successive diversity actions. See Collins v. E.I. DuPont de\n\n                    7\n\fThe district court concluded that Witco had established\nthe elements necessary for a res judicata defense. We\nassume that the district court's findings were correct.\nNonetheless, because Judge Simandle expressly preserved\nVenuto's and AMS's claims for a future action through\ndenying the motion to amend \"without prejudice,\" we will\nreverse.\n\nVenuto relies on the Restatement (Second) of Judgments\n§ 26, as well as federal and New Jersey case law. The\nRestatement provides as follows:\n\n(1) When any of the following circumstances exists, the\ngeneral rule of § 24 [the Restatement's general rule\nprohibiting claim splitting] does not apply to extinguish\nthe claim, and part or all of the claim subsists as a\npossible basis for a second action by the plaintiff\nagainst the defendant:\n\n(a) The parties have agreed in terms or in effect that\nthe plaintiff may split his claim, or the defendant has\nacquiesced therein; or\n\n(b) The court in the first action has expressly reserved\nthe plaintiff's right to maintain the second action . . . .\n\nRestatement (Second) of Judgments § 26 (1982). The\ncommentary to subsection (1)(b) provides, in relevant part,\nthat\n\n[a] determination by the court that its judgment is\n\"without prejudice\" (or words to that effect) to a second\naction on the omitted part of the claim, expressed in\nthe judgment itself, or in the findings of fact,\nconclusions of law, opinion, or similar record, unless\nreversed or set aside, should ordinarily be given effect\nin the second action.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nNemours & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"677334\"><a href=\"/opinion/677334/john-collins-shirley-collins-his-wife-john-wojenski-robert-austin-juanita/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 176 (3d Cir. 1994).

Professors Wright, Miller, and Cooper share the Restatement view that\nthe first court reviewing a claim has at least some power to determine\nthe preclusive effects of its judgments:\n\nDespite the general rule that a court cannot dictate preclusion\nconsequences at the time of deciding a first action, it should have\npower to narrow the ordinary rules of claim preclusion. A judgment\nthat expressly leaves open the opportunity to bring a second action\non specified parts of the claim or cause of action that was advanced\nin the first action should be effective to forestall preclusion.\n\n18 Wright, Miller, and Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure, § 4413, at\n106 (1981 & Supp. 1997).\n\n9. The only court of appeals opinion to the contrary that we have\nidentified is one that was decided on the basis of state law; moreover,\nthe case arose in an unusual procedural setting not present here. In\nAbramson v. Harbor Island Marina, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"487150\"><a href=\"/opinion/487150/neil-abramson-v-harbor-island-marina-inc-harbor-island-marina-inc-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">816</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">975</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 1987), a\nstate court, after a bench trial regarding a lease dispute, had declined to\naward specific performance or damages for out-of-pocket expenses, but\nhad awarded the return of the lessee's deposit,\" `without prejudice to the\n\n                    9\n\fWitco responds with three arguments why Venuto's\nclaims should be barred by res judicata. We think that\nnone of these arguments has merit. First, Witco argues that\npermitting Venuto to bring his claims after the motion to\namend was denied for untimeliness would reward delay. We\nneed not fear that applying the Restatement rule will\nreward delay: if a district court concludes that a litigant\nhas unduly delayed, it can -- and, presumably, ordinarily\nwill -- deny a motion to amend \"with prejudice.\" Here,\nhowever, despite the untimeliness of the motion, Judge\nSimandle chose to deny the motion \"without prejudice.\"\n\nWitco next argues that the denial of the motion to amend\nwas superseded by the final judgment in Lube I. It notes\nespecially that \"[n]othing about the final judgment in Lube\nI was `without prejudice' to any rights Lube or its privies\nmay have had.\" This argument is also meritless. Witco\noverlooks the established rule that interlocutory orders,\nsuch as the order denying the motion to amend without\nprejudice, merge into the final judgment. See, e.g., In re\nWestinghouse Securities Litigation, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"722540\"><a href=\"/opinion/722540/in-re-westinghouse-securities-litigation-margaret-alessi-gloria/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">696</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 706 (3d\nCir. 1996). In issuing its final judgment, a court need not\nreview all of its interlocutory orders and expressly reaffirm\ntheir continuing vitality.\n\nFinally, Witco argues that Judge Simandle's denial of\nLube's motion to amend was not an express reservation of\nVenuto's claims, and hence did not fall within the scope of\n§ 26(1)(b) of the Restatement. Witco argues that Judge\nSimandle's use of the term \"without prejudice\" was only\nintended to preserve Lube's opportunity to move to amend\nits complaint at a later time, if discovery proved to be more\nlengthy than anticipated. This interpretation strains\ncredulity. It is highly unlikely that Judge Simandle, after\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nright of either party to sue the other for damages in a Court of law.' \" Id.\nat 976. The Fourth Circuit, applying Maryland law, refused to permit a\nsecond action \"where a plaintiff has prayed for damages as part of his\nrelief and has attempted to prove his damages at trial and where the\ntrial judge has found the proof of some damages insufficient and has\nentered an award of other damages.\" Id. at 977. Needless to say, Venuto\nhas not yet had a trial nor has he been awarded partial damages on his\nclaims.\n\n                    10\n\fdenying the motion to amend because the motion was\nuntimely and because granting it would unduly delay\nresolution of Lube I, intended to indicate that he would\nentertain a second motion to amend at a later time. Rather,\nit seems clear that Judge Simandle intended to permit\nVenuto and AMS to file their claims in a separate suit, as\nhad been discussed at the argument on the motion.\n\nWe find the logic of § 26(1)(b) of the Restatement to be\npersuasive. As Professors Wright, Miller, and Cooper have\nreasoned,\n\nAn order by the first court that its judgment does not\npreclude a second suit on specified parts of the claim or\ncause of action advanced in the first suit may preserve\nvalid grounds of recovery without undue violence to the\nvalues of res judicata. The express reservation notifies\nthe defendant that repose has not yet been achieved.\nThe plaintiff may have a substantially better\nopportunity to prove the reserved claim, or to determine\nthat it is not worth litigating. For that matter, the\ndefendant may also prove better able to meet the\nunexpected theory in a second suit.\n\n18 Wright, Miller, and Cooper, Federal Practice and\nProcedure, § 4413, at 107 (1981).\n\nIn finding that logic applicable to the case at bar, we note\nthat this is not an instance in which the court's use of the\nphrase \"without prejudice\" was inadvertent. Compare\nHulmes v. Honda Motor Co., Ltd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1472169\"><a href=\"/opinion/1472169/hulmes-v-honda-motor-co-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Judge Simandle and Witco's\ncounsel explicitly discussed the possibility of a second\naction, and Witco's counsel stated that \"Mr. Kramer will\nhave the benefit of the first case and second case\" and \"he\ncan throw rocks in both courts at us.\" In these\ncircumstances, Judge Simandle appropriately exercised his\ndiscretion to permit Venuto to file a second action. We\n\n                    11\n\fconclude that, consonant with the federal cases cited\nabove, Venuto's claims are not barred by res judicata.10\n\nWe reach the same result applying state law.

The doctrine was . . . extended to\ninclude all affirmative claims that a party might have\nagainst another party, including counterclaims and\ncross-claims, as well as all parties with a material\ninterest in the controversy, i.e., those who can affect or\nbe affected by the judicial outcome of the\ncontroversy. . . . In essence, it is the factual\ncircumstances giving rise to the controversy itself,\nrather than a commonality of claims, issues or parties,\nthat triggers the requirement of joinder to create a\ncohesive and complete litigation. . . .\n\n . . .

However, in Mystic Isle the New Jersey Supreme\nCourt somewhat tightened the entire controversy doctrine.\n\nIn Mystic Isle, the court held that a second suit against\nfour defendants was barred by the entire controversy\ndoctrine, even though the first court's dismissal of the first\nsuit against one of the four defendants had been \"without\nprejudice.\" The court first distinguished Woodward-Clyde,\nstating that \"it is the party's original compliance with the\ndoctrine [by presenting all its claims to the trial court],\nrather than the absence of a conclusive determination of a\nclaim, that ensures preservation of that claim.\" 662 A.2d at\n534.\n\nThe Mystic Isle court went on to note that\n\n[i]n certain circumstances, especially where a plaintiff\nmanipulates the judicial system in order to fragment\nlitigation, the principles underlying the entire\ncontroversy doctrine may mandate that a suit be\nbarred even though it stems from the dismissal of a\nprior action without prejudice.\n\nId. (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 19 cmt. a\n(1982)). In that case, the plaintiff had \"deliberately\ncontrived to have one claim dismissed in the [first] action in\norder to circumvent the preclusive effect of the entire\ncontroversy doctrine on its subsequent . . . claim,\" id. at\n535; because of this \"manipulat[ion] of the judicial system,\"\nthe plaintiff's claim was barred.\n\n                    15\n\fWe do not find the case at bar to be the sort of case that\nshould, in the words of Mystic Isle, be\"barred even though\nit stems from the dismissal of a prior action without\nprejudice.\" The major focus of the entire controversy\ndoctrine is to bring all claims before the trial court for\ndisposition in one proceeding; once all claims are put\nforward, the \"trial court has the discretion to structure the\nlitigation to assure efficient administration, clarity and\nfairness.\" Id. at 534. Here, the plaintiff in the first suit\ncomplied with the dictates of the entire controversy doctrine\nand undertook to present all claims for the court's decision\non how best to structure the litigation. The court then\ndecided -- contrary to the plaintiff's express preference --\nthat the claims should be heard in separate suits; no\nplaintiff \"manipulation of the judicial system\" occurred.\nTherefore, the ruling of the district court in the present\ncase that this second suit is not barred by the entire\ncontroversy doctrine was correct.\n\nIV.\n\nWe conclude that Venuto's and AMS's claims against\nWitco are not barred by the claim preclusion aspect of res\njudicata or by the entire controversy doctrine. We note that\nanother aspect of res judicata -- namely, issue preclusion\nor collateral estoppel -- may be applicable to some or all of\nVenuto's and AMS's claims (and, conceivably, to some or all\nof Witco's defenses),13 but we leave these matters to the\ndistrict court.
