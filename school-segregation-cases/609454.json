The Senate floor debate indicates that the congressional intent in the amendment was to override the appellate decision in this and other cases.  120 Cong.Rec. S9336 (daily ed. May 30, 1974).

Since appellants made their first request the facts and the law have both changed.  Some of the case files have been terminated in the interim and Department counsel indicated that if a new request were made today the passage of time and the occurrence of certain events have created a situation in which some of the remaining contested files would now be handed over.  However, the Department would still contend that it was entitled under the new law to refuse disclosure of some of the other files.
