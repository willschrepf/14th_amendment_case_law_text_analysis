This Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction of the denial of\n                 UIW’s plea to the jurisdiction because UIW is not a\n                 “governmental unit” as defined by Tex. Civ.

Neither UIW nor its Campus Police is a “governmental unit”\n                 under the Texas Tort Claims Act ...................................................... 7\n\n                 A.       No Texas court has ever held that a private institution is a\n                          “governmental unit” in the absence of a specific statute and\n                          government funding of the service at issue .......................... 7\n\n                 B.       That a statute authorizes UIW to establish a Campus Police\n                          Department does not make the UIW Campus Police a\n                          “governmental unit.”.............................................................. 10\n\n\n\n\n                                                          ii\n\f                  C.       Allowing UIW’s campus police to enforce state and\n                           municipal law in limited circumstances does not turn UIW\n                           or its police department into a “governmental unit.” ....... 13\n\n\n         III.     Even if UIW is a governmental entity, the Texas Tort Claims Act\n                  does not bar the Reduses negligence claims because they arise\n                  from a death caused by tangible use of tangible personal\n                  property. ....................................................................................16\n\n         IV.      UIW’s argument regarding respondeat superior is not properly\n                  part of a plea to the jurisdiction and should be dismissed for\n                  insufficient notice under Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a.... .......................... 18\n\n         V.       UIW’s argument regarding dismissal of Officer Carter fails\n                  because the UIW Campus Police is not a “governmental unit” and\n                  the TTCA election of remedies does not apply.............................22\n\nConclusion and Prayer ........................................................................................... 20\n\nCertificate of Service ............................................................................................... 22\n\n\n\n\n                                                           iii\n\f                                        INDEX OF AUTHORITIES\n\nAttorney General, Texas, Opinion No. MW-537, Dec. 22, 1987 .................... 21\n\nCantu Services, v.

(“Mickey”) Redus, Individually\n\nand as Executor of the Estate of Robert Cameron Redus, would show the\n\nHonorable Fourth Court of Appeals as follows:\n\n\n\n\n                                   vii\n\f                          STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n      Valerie and Mickey Redus sued University of the Incarnate Word\n\n(“UIW”) and Christopher Carter for claims arising from their son Cameron’s\n\ndeath on December 6, 2013. Carter, a UIW Campus Police Officer, shot\n\nCameron Redus five times, killing him in the parking lot at Cameron’s off-\n\ncampus apartment in Alamo Heights.\n\n      The Reduses filed suit on May 6, 2014. CR (Clerk’s Record) at 1. UIW,\n\non February 13, 2015, pleaded a Texas Tort Claims Act affirmative defense\n\nand filed a plea to the jurisdiction. CR at 109 and 125. The trial court denied\n\nthe plea to the jurisdiction on March 2, 2014 (CR at 418) and UIW initiated\n\nthis interlocutory appeal.\n\n      UIW’s claimed statutory basis for this interlocutory appeal is Tex. Civ.\n\nPrac. & Rem. Code § 51.014(a)(8). The central—and likely the only—issue in\n\nthe appeal is whether UIW, a private Catholic institution of higher education,\n\nis a “governmental unit” under the Texas Tort Claims Act. See Tex. Civ. Prac.\n\n& Rem. Code § 101.001(3)(D). The Reduses, on April 21, 2015, filed a motion\n\nto dismiss this appeal for want of jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                                      viii\n\f                     ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n1.   Whether this Court has jurisdiction of an interlocutory appeal\n     brought by a private institution of higher education claiming to\n     be a “governmental unit”?\n2.   Whether the UIW Campus Police Department is a “governmental\n     unit” by virtue of the license issued to UIW and the fact that\n     UIW’s officers are licensed by the state?\n3.   Whether the Texas Tort Claims Act precludes the Reduses’\n     negligence claims against UIW, a private institution of higher\n     education?\n4.   Whether UIW’s appellate issue regarding respondeat superior—\n     effectively a motion for summary judgment as to liability—is\n     properly part of a plea to the jurisdiction?\n5.   Whether the Reduses claims against Carter should be dismissed,\n     given that UIW is a private institution of higher education?\n\n\n\n\n                              ix\n\f                        INTRODUCTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n          UIW asks this Court to do something that no other Texas court has\n\ndone: find that a private university’s police department is a “governmental\n\nunit” even though it does not receive government funding, does not act at the\n\ndirection of a state agency, and is wholly controlled by UIW.\n\n          UIW’s application to establish a law enforcement agency states that\n\nUIW, a private university, is the “requesting governmental body” for the\n\npolice department. CR at 206. The statutory authority for the UIW police\n\ndepartment, Tex. Educ. Code § 51.212, allows “private institutions of higher\n\neducation…to employ and commission peace officers” for limited purposes.\n\nNothing in the statutory authority or licensing requirements that apply to\n\nUIW turn it into the “governmental unit” that it now claims to be. 1\n\n          A plea to the jurisdiction seeks dismissal of a case for lack of subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction. Harris County. v. Sykes, 136 S.W.3d 635, 638 (Tex.\n\n2004). Sovereign immunity deprives a trial court of subject matter\n\njurisdiction if a plaintiff sues the state or a state agency, unless the\n\nLegislature has consented to suit. Texas Parks & Wildlife Dep’t v. Sawyer\n\nTrust, 354 S.W.3d 384, 388 (Tex.2011).\n\n\n\n1\n    UIW waited over seven months after filing its original answer—from June 2, 2014 to February 13, 2015—\n      to discover and allege its status as a “governmental unit” under the Texas Tort Claims Act. The trial\n      court held a hearing on the plea to the jurisdiction 269 days after UIW filed its original answer.\n\f      Immunity from suit prohibits suits against the State unless the State\n\nexpressly consents to the suit. Wichita Falls State Hosp. v. Taylor, 106\n\nS.W.3d 692, 696 (Tex.2003). Unlike immunity from suit, immunity from\n\nliability does not affect a court’s jurisdiction to hear a case and cannot be\n\nraised in a plea to the jurisdiction. Id.; Texas Dep’t of Transp. v. Jones, 8\n\nS.W.3d 636, 638–39 (Tex.1999).\n\n      Even if UIW is somehow a “governmental unit,” the Legislature has\n\nwaived immunity for UIW’s officers in defined circumstances. See Tex. Educ.\n\nCode § 51.212(b). Additionally, the Reduses’ negligence claims against UIW\n\nare not barred by the Texas Tort Claims Act.\n\n      Whether a court has subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law.\n\nSawyer Trust, 354 S.W.3d at 388. Whether a pleading alleges facts that\n\naffirmatively demonstrate a trial court’s subject matter jurisdiction is also a\n\nquestion of law reviewed de novo. Tex. Dep’t of Parks & Wildlife v. Miranda,\n\n133 S.W.3d 217, 226 (Tex.2004). If the relevant evidence is undisputed or\n\nfails to raise a fact question on the jurisdictional issue, the trial court rules\n\non the plea to the jurisdiction as a matter of law. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                       2\n\f                           STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\nA.    Plea to the Jurisdiction Evidence\n\n      The Reduses do not dispute that UIW applied for and received a license\n\nto establish a law enforcement agency under Tex. Educ. Code § 51.212, which\n\nallows “governing boards of private institutions of higher education…to\n\nemploy and commission peace officers.” CR at 206. The Reduses do not\n\ndispute that Carter is a licensed Texas peace officer. CR at 197-204.\n\nB.    Facts of the Underlying Case\n\n      UIW offers a three-page recitation of facts largely based on the\n\nReduses’ Original Petition, which has been superseded by their First\n\nAmended Petition (attached as Exhibit 1). See Appellant’s Brief at 4-7.\n\n      As this Court knows, pleadings are not competent evidence, even if\n\nsworn or verified. Laidlaw Waste Systems v. City of Wilmer, 904 S.W.2d\n\n656, 660 (Tex. 1995); Hidalgo v. Surety Sav. & Loan Ass'n, 462 S.W.2d 540,\n\n545 (Tex.1971). Nonetheless, the Reduses removed the factual allegation\n\nupon which UIW relies for its argument that plaintiffs allege intentional\n\nrather than negligent torts. See Appellant’s Brief at 6 (“Cameron was in a\n\nsubmissive position when Carter discharged his weapon for the last time.”)\n\n      The Reduses do not dispute that UIW Campus Police Officer Carter\n\nshot and killed Cameron Redus in the parking lot of his off-campus\n                                      3\n\fapartment in Alamo Heights. The Reduses do not dispute that Carter was on\n\nduty at UIW on December 6, 2013.\n\nC.    UIW’s Authority to form a Police Department\n\n      Again, the Reduses do not dispute that UIW applied for and received a\n\nlicense to establish a law enforcement agency under Tex. Educ. Code § 51.212\n\nand that Carter is a licensed Texas peace officer. CR at 197-204, 206.\n\n      UIW wrongly states that its authority to establish the police\n\ndepartment comes from Tex. Educ. Code § 51.203, which authorizes a “state\n\ninstitution of higher education” to employ and commission peace officers.\n\nAppellant’s Brief at 8. UIW’s application (CR at 206), however, accurately\n\nidentifies the applicable statute as Tex. Educ. Code § 51.212, which\n\nauthorizes “private institutions of higher education” to employ and\n\ncommission peace officers. No Texas court has held that the authority to\n\nemploy and commission somehow transforms a private university into a\n\ngovernmental unit.\n\nD.    Procedural Status of the Case\n\n      The “procedural status” that UIW provides (Appellant’s Brief at 9-13)\n\nis rife with argument and mischaracterization of documents that are not\n\nrelevant to this Court’s jurisdiction. The timeline is simple:\n\n\n\n                                       4\n\f               •   The Reduses filed this action on May 6, 2014.\n               •   UIW answered and removed the action on June 2.\n               •   The federal court remanded the action on November 25.\n               •   UIW filed its amended answer on February 13, 2015.\n               •   The trial court heard the plea to the jurisdiction on February 26.\n               •   The trial court denied the plea on March 2.\n               •   UIW appealed the denial on March 3.\n               •   The Reduses filed their amended petition on March 16. 2\n\nContrary to UIW’s statement regarding the federal court’s “stark warning” in\n\nabout TTCA immunity in a footnote (Appellant’s Brief at 10), the court stated\n\nin its conclutson that “Plaintiffs’ claims do not create federal jurisdiction”\n\nand “are valid causes of action under state law.” CR at 399.\n\n          The trial court declined to issue findings and conclusions, presumably\n\nbecause the denial of the plea to the jurisdiction does not constitute a\n\njudgment. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 296. The Reduses did request that the trial court\n\nissue a finding that UIW is not a “governmental unit.”\n\n\n\n\n2\n    UIW argues that Plaintiffs’ First Amended Petition was improperly filed as an “unabashed contempt of\n      court,” but has not moved to strike it or hold counsel in contempt. Appellant’s Brief at 12. UIW also\n      argues that plaintiffs improperly filed a motion to compel. Id. at 13. The trial court granted Plaintiff’s\n      Motion to Compel, leading UIW to file a separate mandamus yesterday. UIW conveniently fails to\n      inform the Court that it waited almost 260 days after filing its original answer to assert its TTCA\n      immunity and almost 270 days for a hearing. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 51.014(c).\n                                                        5\n\f                                 ARGUMENT\n\nI.    This Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction of the denial of\n      UIW’s plea to the jurisdiction because UIW is not a\n      “governmental unit” as defined by Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.\n      Code § 101.001(3).\n\n      An interlocutory appeal is only allowed following the grant or denial of\n\na plea to the jurisdiction if the plea is made by a “governmental\n\nunit.” See Critical Air Medicine, Inc. v. Shepard, 2005 WL 3533130\n\n(Tex.App.—San Antonio 2005, no pet.)(dismissing interlocutory appeal filed\n\nunder § 51.014(a)(8) by private corporation); Mobil Oil Corp. v. Shores, 128\n\nS.W.3d 718, 721 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 2004, no pet.) (same); Cantu\n\nServices, v. United Freedom Associates, Inc., 329 S.W.3d 58, 64 (Tex. App.—\n\nEl Paso 2010, no pet.).\n\n      This Court noted in Critical Air:\n\n      It is undisputed that Critical Air is a private corporation and not\n      an agency of state government, a political subdivision of the\n      state, or an institution, agency or organ of government whose\n      status and authority is derived from state law.\n\nId. at *2.\n\n      Similarly, it is undisputed that UIW is a private university and not a\n\nstate government agency. UIW’s argument is that the authority to hire and\n\ncommission peace officers somehow transforms it into an “institution,\n\n\n\n                                      6\n\fagency, or organ of government.” See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code\n\n§ 101.001(3)(D). The authorizing statute does not justify this interpretation.\n\n           Parallel statutes in the Education Code authorize “the governing\n\nboards” of the universities to “employ and commission peace officers.” See\n\nTex. Educ. Code § 51.203 (for “state institutions of higher education”) and\n\n§ 51.212 (for “private institutions of higher education”). There is no\n\nprecedent for the argument that granting this authority transforms a private\n\ninstitution into a government institution, agency or organ. As argued in\n\nAppellees’ Motion to Dismiss, this Court should dismiss this appeal for want\n\nof jurisdiction.\n\nII.        Neither UIW nor its Campus Police is a “governmental unit”\n           under the Texas Tort Claims Act.3\n\n           UIW expressly seeks the protections of the Texas Tort Claims Act as a\n\n“governmental unit.” CR at 120 (UIW’s First Amended Answer at ¶ 63-64).\n\nUIW argues that its police department draws its right to exist from a statute\n\n(Tex. Educ. Code § 51.212) and that the department and its officers are\n\nlicensed by the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement, a “regulatory state\n\nagency.” Id. UIW, in its appellate brief, cites no case law holding that any part\n\nof a private university is a “governmental unit.”\n\n3   Section II, with the exception of footnote 3, is copied verbatim from Appellees’ Motion to Dismiss for Want\n      of Jurisdiction.\n                                                        7\n\f      A.      No Texas court has ever held that a private institution is\n              a “governmental unit” in the absence of a specific\n              statute and government funding of the service at issue.\n\n      No Texas court has ever held that a private, non-profit institution of\n\nhigher education is a “governmental unit” in the absence of a statute defining\n\nthe institution and its actions as such. In Klein v. Hernandez, 315, S.W.2d 1,\n\n2 (Tex. 2010), the plaintiff sued Baylor College of Medicine for malpractice\n\nby its physicians at Ben Taub Hospital, a public hospital. The Supreme Court\n\nnoted that:\n\n      Baylor [College of Medicine] is a private, non-profit medical\n      school, but is also a ‘supported medical school,’ which means that\n      it has contracts with the Texas Higher Education Coordinating\n      Board and receives state funding specifically allocated for\n      training physicians who provide medical care at public hospitals\n      such as Ben Taub.\n\nThe Court noted that private medical school derived its status as a\n\n“governmental unit” from Tex. Health & Safety Code § 312.006(a), which\n\ndefines Baylor as a “governmental unit” when its doctors are working at\n\npublic hospitals. Id. at 8.\n\n      In contrast to the Baylor College of Medicine, UIW has no claim to a\n\ncontract with a state agency, to receiving state funding, or to a statute\n\ndefining any part of the university as a “governmental unit.” UIW does not\n\neven address the implications of the Texas Supreme Court’s Klein holding,\n\n\n                                      8\n\fchoosing instead to rely almost completely on LTTS Charter School, Inc. v.\n\nC2 Construction, Inc., 342 S.W.3d 73 (Tex. 2011). See Appellant’s Brief at 24-\n\n26.\n\n      The Supreme Court, in LTTS Charter School, held that an open-\n\nenrollment charter school operated as part of the public school system is a\n\n“governmental unit.” Id. at 76. The Supreme Court’s opinion drew a vigorous\n\ndissent (id. at 82), and the case is easily distinguishable from UIW’s claims.\n\nCharter schools by statute are “part of the public school system” which bears\n\n“the primary responsibility for implementing the state's system of public\n\neducation.” Id. at 82. Charter schools receive government funding and\n\noperate within the Texas public school testing system. Id. at 74.\n\n      UIW, by contrast, has specifically and purposely chosen to operate\n\noutside Texas’ system of public higher education. See Tex. Educ. Code\n\n§ 61.003, with definitions of “public senior college or university” and “private\n\nor independent institution of higher education.” UIW identifies itself as:\n\n      an incorporated charitable institution created and sponsored by\n      the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word, a Catholic order of\n      nuns. The Sisters established the school in 1881, devoted to\n      providing education without private gain. The UIW is a\n      charitable institution under both Texas and Federal law.\n\n\n\n\n                                       9\n\fCR at 109. State and private institutions of higher education have different\n\nenabling statutes for establishing campus police departments. Compare Tex.\n\nEduc. Code § 51.203 (state) and § 51.212 (private).\n\n      UIW also cites Zacharie v. City of San Antonio by and through San\n\nAntonio Water System Board of Trustees, 952 S.W.2d 56, 59 (Tex.App.—San\n\nAntonio 1997, no writ) and City of Leon Valley Economic Development\n\nCorporation v. Little, 422 S.W.3d S.W.3d 37, 40 (Tex.App.—San Antonio\n\n2013, no pet.) as supporting its argument. Both cases are distinguishable. In\n\nZacharie, this Court held that San Antonio’s Water System was a city agent\n\nand thus entitled to immunity.\n\n      In Leon Valley, this Court held that an economic development\n\ncorporation’s (“EDC”) statutory designation as a “governmental unit” under\n\nTex. Loc. Gov. Code § 505.106(b) did not protect it from contractual liability,\n\nalthough the status did authorized the EDC to file an interlocutory appeal. In\n\nallowing the interlocutory appeal to proceed, this Court followed the EDC’s\n\nenabling statute: “For purposes of Chapter 101, Civil Practice and Remedies\n\nCode, a Type B corporation is a governmental unit and the corporation’s\n\nactions are governmental functions.” Tex. Loc. Gov. Code § 505.106(b).\n\nNeither this Court nor any other Texas court has held that that a private\n\n\n\n                                      10\n\finstitution is a governmental unit in the absence of a specific statute and\n\ngovernment funding of the services at issue.\n\n      B.    That a statute authorizes UIW to establish a Campus\n            Police Department does not make the UIW Campus\n            Police a “governmental unit.”\n\n      Section 101.001(3)(D) of the Civil Practices and Remedies Code defines\n\na “governmental unit” as\n\n      any other institution, agency, or organ of government the status\n      and authority of which are derived from the Constitution of\n      Texas or from laws passed by the legislature under the\n      constitution.\n\nUIW argues that a Texas statute—Tex. Educ. Code § 51.212—authorizes the\n\ncreation of UIW’s police department, that its officers are licensed by a state\n\nagency, and that they enforce state law. Appellant’s Brief at 17-24.\n\n      So, UIW’s argument goes, the UIW Campus Police Department is an\n\n“institution, agency, or organ of government the…authority of which [is]\n\nderived from…laws passed by the legislature.” The argument proves too\n\nmuch ignoring the fact that UIW as private university is not an “institution,\n\nagency, or organ of government.”\n\n      The only case applying this statute to any extent is LTTS Charter\n\nSchool, 342 S.W.3d at 80. The Supreme Court held only that § 101.001(3)(D)\n\ndoes not require a statute specifically establishing the government agency.\n\n\n                                      11\n\fThe Court’s holding, however, is primarily based on Tex. Educ. Code\n\n§ 12.105: “An open-enrollment charter school is part of the public school\n\nsystem” and the public schools are governmental units. See §101.001(3)(B).\n\n      UIW’s argument misinterprets §101.001(3)(D). According to the\n\nSupreme Court, an “open-enrollment charter school” is an “institution,\n\nagency, or organ of government” because it is “part of the public school\n\nsystem.” LTTS Charter School 342 S.W.3d at 82. Unlike open enrollment\n\npublic charter schools, UIW has no claim to being part of a “state institution\n\nof higher education” or part of the “field of public higher education.” See Tex.\n\nEduc. Code § 51.203 (enabling statute for police departments at state\n\nuniversities) and § 61.002 (enabling statute for the Texas Higher Education\n\nCoordinating Board). UIW has specifically chosen to avoid the extensive\n\nstate regulation of higher education, such as tuition regulation and degree\n\nofferings. See Tex. Educ. Code Title 3 generally.\n\n      Textually—as the statute requires—UIW cannot establish that it is a\n\ngovernmental “institution, agency, or organ.” See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.\n\nCode § 101.001(3)(D). Merely being an “institution, agency, or organ” whose\n\nexistence is enabled by a statute and governed by a state agency does make\n\nthe “institution, agency, or organ” a “governmental unit.”\n\n\n\n                                      12\n\f        For example, Texas lawyers draw their right to practice law in Texas\n\ncourts and to form law firms from the State Bar of Texas, “a public\n\ncorporation and an administrative agency of the judicial department of\n\ngovernment.” See Tex. Govt. Code § 81.011. Only persons licensed by the\n\nState Bar of Texas can be employed as lawyers in law firms.\n\n        Texas barbers draw their authority to “perform any act of barbering”\n\nfrom Tex. Occ. Code § 1601.251 and Texas barbershops draw their authority\n\nto exist from Tex. Occ. Code § 1601.301. Barbers and barbershops are\n\ngoverned by a state licensing agency, the Texas Department of Licensing and\n\nRegulation (“TDLR”), a “regulatory state agency,” pursuant to administrative\n\nrules. See Tex. Admin. Code § 82.1, et seq. Neither barbers nor barbershops\n\nare turned into a “governmental unit” by these statutes.\n\n        The same could be said for numerous other respectable occupations.\n\nBut neither barbershops nor law firms are entitled to call themselves\n\n“governmental units” and claim the immunities of the TTCA when sued in\n\ntort.\n\n\n\n\n                                      13\n\f          C.      Allowing UIW’s campus police to enforce state and\n                  municipal law in limited circumstances does not turn\n                  UIW or its police department into a “governmental\n                  unit.”\n\n           UIW argues that the authority of its Campus Police and the\n\nindividually licensed officer to enforce state law bolsters its claim to be a\n\n“governmental unit.” See Appellant’s Brief at 19-23. The truth, however, is\n\nthat any person can enforce a good portion of Texas criminal law without a\n\nTCOLE license.\n\n          Article 14.01(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure allows:\n\n          A peace officer or any other person, may, without a warrant,\n          arrest an offender when the offense is committed in his presence\n          or within his view, if the offense is one classed as a felony or as\n          an offense against the public peace.\n\nThe statute grants both peace officers and private citizens the same rights of\n\nwarrantless arrest for the two broadly defined categories of crimes. See Ofﬁce\n\nof the Attorney General, Texas, Opinion No. MW-537, Dec. 22, 1987 (citing\n\nAlexander v. United States, 390 F.2d 101 (5th Cir. 1968); Romo v. State, 577\n\nS.W.2d 251 (Tex. Crim. App. 1979); Woods v. State, 213 S.W.2d 685 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1948) (“Any individual may make a ‘citizen’s arrest’ under that\n\nprovision, provided that all applicable legal requirements are met.”)4\n\n\n4\n    The best that UIW can argue is that the officers that UIW employs or commissions have a broader\n      authority to enforce state law than private citizens have. There is nothing about this grant that somehow\n      transforms UIW into an “institution, agency, or organ of government.”\n                                                       14\n\f      No Texas court has ever held that a statute authorizing a private entity\n\nto enforce state law makes that entity an “institution, agency, or organ of\n\ngovernment” for purposes of the Texas Tort Claims Act. See Tex. Code of\n\nCrim. Proc. § 2.12 for an extended list of 36 types of peace officers and § 14.03\n\nfor the authority given to the officers. UIW Campus Police are “officers\n\ncommissioned under… Subchapter E, Chapter 51, Education Code.” Tex.\n\nCode. Crim. Proc. § 2.12(8). The officers’ authority is defined by § 14.03.\n\n      In its application for a “law enforcement agency number,” UIW\n\nidentifies its “Requesting Governmental Body” as “University of the\n\nIncarnate Word.” C.R. 206. UIW’s Board of Trustees approved a resolution\n\nsupporting the formation of the police department. C.R. 350. As noted above,\n\nTexas law gives “governing boards of private institutions of higher\n\neducation” the authority “to employ and commission police officers.” Tex.\n\nEduc. Code § 51.212. Nothing about this process turns UIW into a\n\n“governmental unit.” UIW’s Campus Police Department receives no\n\ngovernment funding and has no contract with any government agency.\n\n      The cases UIW cites in the appellate brief do not support its argument;\n\nthey instead hold that private entities subject themselves to Constitutional\n\nviolations by their involvement with governmental functions. Appellant’s\n\nBrief at 19-20.\n                                       15\n\f      For example, in Evans v. Newton, 382 U.S. 296 (1966), the Supreme\n\nCourt held that private managers of a public park could not enforce racial\n\nsegregation in the park. In Rosborough v. Management & Training Corp.,\n\n350 F.3d 459, 461 (5th Cir. 2003), the Fifth Circuit found that “private prison-\n\nmanagement corporations and their employees may be sued under § 1983 by\n\na prisoner who has suffered a constitutional injury.” In other words, the cases\n\ncited by UIW hold that a private entity subjects itself to greater, not less,\n\nliability by taking on a government function. This is consistent with the\n\nstatute providing limited immunity for peace officers employed by private\n\nuniversities. See Tex. Educ. Code § 51.212(b)(1).\n\nIII. Even if UIW is a governmental entity, the Texas Tort Claims\n     Act does not bar the Reduses negligence claims because they\n     arise from a death caused by tangible use of tangible\n     personal property.\n\n      UIW argues that the Reduses claims are barred by the TTCA because\n\nthey are “negligence claims that arise from an intentional tort.” See\n\nAppellant’s Brief at 27-33. As noted above, the Reduses filed an amended\n\npetition following the denial of the plea to the jurisdiction. Exhibit 1. The\n\nReduses have not made any intentional tort claims against either defendant,\n\nand there is no evidence in the record of the circumstances of the shooting.\n\n\n\n\n                                      16\n\f      As this Court knows, the TTCA does not waive sovereign immunity for\n\nintentional torts. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 101.057. The federal court,\n\nin its remand order, held that “Plaintiffs’ claims—negligence, gross\n\nnegligence, respondeat superior liability, and wrongful death—arise from\n\nstate law and are valid causes of action under state law.” CR at 399.\n\n      Although a governmental unit is immune from intentional tort claims,\n\nan injured party may still pursue a separate negligence claim arising out of\n\nthe same facts. Young v. City of Dimmitt, 787 S.W.2d 50, 51 (Tex. 1990). A\n\ngovernmental unit is liable for personal injury and death caused by a\n\ncondition or use of tangible personal or real property if the governmental\n\nunit would, were it a private person, be liable to the claimant according to\n\nTexas law. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 101.021(2). Firearms are\n\ntangible personal property under the TTCA. See Morin v. Moore, 309 F.3d\n\n316 (5th Cir.2002) (recognizing Texas law).\n\n      UIW represents that Harris County v. Cabazos, 177 S.W. 3d 105 (Tex.\n\nApp. – Houston [1st Dist.] 2005) involves facts similar to this matter.\n\nAppellants’ Brief at 31-32. This is misleading. Cabazos pleaded guilty to\n\nevading arrest in a separate criminal action and then filed a civil lawsuit\n\nagainst Harris County and a Sherriff’s Deputy whom he never served and\n\nwho never appeared in the case. Id. at 108. The undisputed evidence before\n                                      17\n\fthe Court was that the deputy intentionally shot the plaintiff. Id. at 112.\n\n      UIW’s reliance upon Texas Dept. of Public Safety v. Petta, 44 S.W. 3d\n\n575 (Tex. 2001) is wholly unfounded. Petta was convicted of fleeing or\n\nattempting to elude a police officer in her criminal case, which arose out of\n\nthe same facts as her civil action against a State Trooper employed by the\n\nTexas Department of Public Safety. Id at 576. The basis of the summary\n\njudgment dismissal, which was upheld by the Supreme Court, was that Petta\n\nwas collaterally estopped from re-litigating the underlying facts after her\n\nguilty conviction. Id at 577.\n\n      In both Petta and Cabazos, plaintiffs specifically pleaded claims not\n\nwaived by the TTCA. As discussed above, the TTCA does not bar the Reduses’\n\nnegligence claims and, in any case, UIW is not a “governmental unit.” Officer\n\nCarter was simply an employee of a private educational institution.\n\n      In City of San Augustine, v. Parrish, 10 S.W.3d 734 (Tex.App.-Tyler\n\n1999, pet. dism'd w.o.j.), plaintiffs sued for wrongful death arising from a\n\npolice shooting. The city appealed both the trial court’s denial of its plea to\n\nthe jurisdiction on sovereign immunity and its motion for summary\n\njudgment on official immunity. In upholding the trial court's denial of the\n\nplea, the court considered only the plaintiffs' pleadings; it rejected the city's\n\nreliance on the summary judgment evidence. Id. at 739-40.\n                                       18\n\f      The plaintiffs alleged that a police officer “negligently shot and killed”\n\nthe decedent, and that the police officer negligently used his pistol when\n\n“such use was not reasonable or reasonably necessary to control or subdue a\n\ncitizen and negligently endangered those in the vicinity.” Id. Relying solely\n\non the pleadings, the court held that the intentional tort exclusion did not\n\nbar the suit. Id. The Court should deny UIW’s Plea to the Jurisdiction.\n\nIV.   UIW’s argument regarding respondeat superior is not\n      properly part of a plea to the jurisdiction and should be\n      dismissed for insufficient notice under Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a.\n\n      UIW argues that, as a matter of law, it cannot be held liable in\n\nrespondeat superior because Carter is a licensed Texas peace officer whose\n\nimmunity is governed by Tex. Educ. Code § 51.212(b) and other statutes\n\ndefining the authority of licensed peace officers. Appellant’s Brief at 33-38.\n\nUIW made the same argument in its Plea to the Jurisdiction. CR at 144-148.\n\n      Sovereign immunity has two components: immunity from suit and\n\nimmunity from liability. See Tooke v. City of Mexia, 197 S.W.3d 325, 332\n\n(Tex.2006); Fed. Sign v. Tex. S. Univ., 951 S.W.2d 401, 405 (Tex.1997). The\n\nlaw is well-settled that immunity from liability does not affect a court’s\n\njurisdiction to hear a case and cannot be raised in a plea to the jurisdiction.\n\nWichita Falls State Hosp. v. Taylor, 106 S.W.3d at 696; TXDOT v. Jones, 8\n\nS.W.3d at 638–39.\n                                      19\n\f      The trial court did not and could not rule on UIW’s respondeat\n\nsuperior liability; the trial court denied the plea to the jurisdiction. CR at\n\n418. This Court has nothing to review regarding immunity from liability,\n\nbecause the argument cannot be raised in a plea to the jurisdiction. The case\n\nUIW cites, Cherqui v. Westheimer St. Festival Corp., 116 S.W.3d 337 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2003, no pet.), demonstrates this standard: The\n\ncase involves an appeal following a verdict, not an interlocutory appeal of a\n\nplea to the jurisdiction. Id. at 341.\n\n      Because UIW’s liability for the acts of its employee cannot be raised in\n\na plea to the jurisdiction, this Court should dismiss this appeal as to UIW’s\n\nclaimed immunity from liability for the acts of its employee.\n\nV.    UIW’s argument regarding dismissal of Officer Carter fails\n      because the UIW Campus Police is not a “governmental\n      unit” and the TTCA election of remedies does not apply.\n      UIW finally argues that this Court must dismiss defendant\n\nChristopher Carter under the TTCA’s election of remedies provision. See\n\nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 101.106 and Appellant’s Brief at 38-39. As\n\nexplained above, UIW is not a “governmental unit” and is not entitled to the\n\nbenefits of the TTCA. This Court should dismiss the appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                        20\n\f                          CONCLUSION AND PRAYER\n\n      For these reasons, appellees Valerie Redus and Robert M. Redus,\n\nIndividually and as Executor of the Estate of Robert Cameron Redus, asks\n\nthis Court to dismiss this appeal for want of jurisdiction or, in the alternative,\n\ndeny the plea to the jurisdiction, remand this action to the trial court for\n\nfurther proceedings, and grant appellees all other and further relief to which\n\nthey are entitled.\n\n\n\n\n                                       21\n\fRespectfully submitted,\n\nLAW OFFICE OF BRENT C.

This Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction of the denial of\n                 UIW’s plea to the jurisdiction because UIW is not a\n                 “governmental unit” as defined by Tex. Civ.

No Texas court has ever held that a private institution is a\n                          “governmental unit” in the absence of a specific statute and\n                          government funding of the service at issue .......................... 7\n\n                 B.       That a statute authorizes UIW to establish a Campus Police\n                          Department does not make the UIW Campus Police a\n                          “governmental unit.”.............................................................. 10\n\n\n\n\n                                                          ii\n\f                  C.       Allowing UIW’s campus police to enforce state and\n                           municipal law in limited circumstances does not turn UIW\n                           or its police department into a “governmental unit.” ....... 13\n\n\n         III.     Even if UIW is a governmental entity, the Texas Tort Claims Act\n                  does not bar the Reduses negligence claims because they arise\n                  from a death caused by tangible use of tangible personal\n                  property. ....................................................................................16\n\n         IV.

UIW’s argument regarding dismissal of Officer Carter fails\n                  because the UIW Campus Police is not a “governmental unit” and\n                  the TTCA election of remedies does not apply.............................22\n\nConclusion and Prayer ........................................................................................... 20\n\nCertificate of Service ............................................................................................... 22\n\n\n\n\n                                                           iii\n\f                                        INDEX OF AUTHORITIES\n\nAttorney General, Texas, Opinion No. MW-537, Dec. 22, 1987 .................... 21\n\nCantu Services, v.

Carter, a UIW Campus Police Officer, shot\n\nCameron Redus five times, killing him in the parking lot at Cameron’s off-\n\ncampus apartment in Alamo Heights.\n\n      The Reduses filed suit on May 6, 2014. CR (Clerk’s Record) at 1. UIW,\n\non February 13, 2015, pleaded a Texas Tort Claims Act affirmative defense\n\nand filed a plea to the jurisdiction. CR at 109 and 125. The trial court denied\n\nthe plea to the jurisdiction on March 2, 2014 (CR at 418) and UIW initiated\n\nthis interlocutory appeal.\n\n      UIW’s claimed statutory basis for this interlocutory appeal is Tex. Civ.\n\nPrac. & Rem. Code § 51.014(a)(8). The central—and likely the only—issue in\n\nthe appeal is whether UIW, a private Catholic institution of higher education,\n\nis a “governmental unit” under the Texas Tort Claims Act. See Tex. Civ. Prac.\n\n& Rem. Code § 101.001(3)(D). The Reduses, on April 21, 2015, filed a motion\n\nto dismiss this appeal for want of jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                                      viii\n\f                     ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n1.   Whether this Court has jurisdiction of an interlocutory appeal\n     brought by a private institution of higher education claiming to\n     be a “governmental unit”?\n2.   Whether the UIW Campus Police Department is a “governmental\n     unit” by virtue of the license issued to UIW and the fact that\n     UIW’s officers are licensed by the state?\n3.   Whether the Texas Tort Claims Act precludes the Reduses’\n     negligence claims against UIW, a private institution of higher\n     education?\n4.   Whether UIW’s appellate issue regarding respondeat superior—\n     effectively a motion for summary judgment as to liability—is\n     properly part of a plea to the jurisdiction?\n5.   Whether the Reduses claims against Carter should be dismissed,\n     given that UIW is a private institution of higher education?\n\n\n\n\n                              ix\n\f                        INTRODUCTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n          UIW asks this Court to do something that no other Texas court has\n\ndone: find that a private university’s police department is a “governmental\n\nunit” even though it does not receive government funding, does not act at the\n\ndirection of a state agency, and is wholly controlled by UIW.\n\n          UIW’s application to establish a law enforcement agency states that\n\nUIW, a private university, is the “requesting governmental body” for the\n\npolice department. CR at 206. The statutory authority for the UIW police\n\ndepartment, Tex. Educ. Code § 51.212, allows “private institutions of higher\n\neducation…to employ and commission peace officers” for limited purposes.\n\nNothing in the statutory authority or licensing requirements that apply to\n\nUIW turn it into the “governmental unit” that it now claims to be. 1\n\n          A plea to the jurisdiction seeks dismissal of a case for lack of subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction.

Plea to the Jurisdiction Evidence\n\n      The Reduses do not dispute that UIW applied for and received a license\n\nto establish a law enforcement agency under Tex. Educ. Code § 51.212, which\n\nallows “governing boards of private institutions of higher education…to\n\nemploy and commission peace officers.” CR at 206. The Reduses do not\n\ndispute that Carter is a licensed Texas peace officer. CR at 197-204.\n\nB.    Facts of the Underlying Case\n\n      UIW offers a three-page recitation of facts largely based on the\n\nReduses’ Original Petition, which has been superseded by their First\n\nAmended Petition (attached as Exhibit 1). See Appellant’s Brief at 4-7.\n\n      As this Court knows, pleadings are not competent evidence, even if\n\nsworn or verified. Laidlaw Waste Systems v. City of Wilmer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1523453\"><a href=\"/opinion/1523453/laidlaw-waste-systems-dallas-v-wilmer/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">656</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 660 (Tex. 1995); Hidalgo v.

Nonetheless, the Reduses removed the factual allegation\n\nupon which UIW relies for its argument that plaintiffs allege intentional\n\nrather than negligent torts. See Appellant’s Brief at 6 (“Cameron was in a\n\nsubmissive position when Carter discharged his weapon for the last time.”)\n\n      The Reduses do not dispute that UIW Campus Police Officer Carter\n\nshot and killed Cameron Redus in the parking lot of his off-campus\n                                      3\n\fapartment in Alamo Heights. The Reduses do not dispute that Carter was on\n\nduty at UIW on December 6, 2013.\n\nC.    UIW’s Authority to form a Police Department\n\n      Again, the Reduses do not dispute that UIW applied for and received a\n\nlicense to establish a law enforcement agency under Tex. Educ. Code § 51.212\n\nand that Carter is a licensed Texas peace officer. CR at 197-204, 206.\n\n      UIW wrongly states that its authority to establish the police\n\ndepartment comes from Tex. Educ. Code § 51.203, which authorizes a “state\n\ninstitution of higher education” to employ and commission peace officers.\n\nAppellant’s Brief at 8. UIW’s application (CR at 206), however, accurately\n\nidentifies the applicable statute as Tex. Educ. Code § 51.212, which\n\nauthorizes “private institutions of higher education” to employ and\n\ncommission peace officers. No Texas court has held that the authority to\n\nemploy and commission somehow transforms a private university into a\n\ngovernmental unit.\n\nD.    Procedural Status of the Case\n\n      The “procedural status” that UIW provides (Appellant’s Brief at 9-13)\n\nis rife with argument and mischaracterization of documents that are not\n\nrelevant to this Court’s jurisdiction. The timeline is simple:\n\n\n\n                                       4\n\f               •   The Reduses filed this action on May 6, 2014.\n               •   UIW answered and removed the action on June 2.\n               •   The federal court remanded the action on November 25.\n               •   UIW filed its amended answer on February 13, 2015.\n               •   The trial court heard the plea to the jurisdiction on February 26.\n               •   The trial court denied the plea on March 2.\n               •   UIW appealed the denial on March 3.\n               •   The Reduses filed their amended petition on March 16. 2\n\nContrary to UIW’s statement regarding the federal court’s “stark warning” in\n\nabout TTCA immunity in a footnote (Appellant’s Brief at 10), the court stated\n\nin its conclutson that “Plaintiffs’ claims do not create federal jurisdiction”\n\nand “are valid causes of action under state law.” CR at 399.\n\n          The trial court declined to issue findings and conclusions, presumably\n\nbecause the denial of the plea to the jurisdiction does not constitute a\n\njudgment. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 296. The Reduses did request that the trial court\n\nissue a finding that UIW is not a “governmental unit.”\n\n\n\n\n2\n    UIW argues that Plaintiffs’ First Amended Petition was improperly filed as an “unabashed contempt of\n      court,” but has not moved to strike it or hold counsel in contempt. Appellant’s Brief at 12. UIW also\n      argues that plaintiffs improperly filed a motion to compel. Id. at 13. The trial court granted Plaintiff’s\n      Motion to Compel, leading UIW to file a separate mandamus yesterday. UIW conveniently fails to\n      inform the Court that it waited almost 260 days after filing its original answer to assert its TTCA\n      immunity and almost 270 days for a hearing. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 51.014(c).\n                                                        5\n\f                                 ARGUMENT\n\nI.    This Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction of the denial of\n      UIW’s plea to the jurisdiction because UIW is not a\n      “governmental unit” as defined by Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.\n      Code § 101.001(3).\n\n      An interlocutory appeal is only allowed following the grant or denial of\n\na plea to the jurisdiction if the plea is made by a “governmental\n\nunit.” See Critical Air Medicine, Inc. v.

App.—\n\nEl Paso 2010, no pet.).\n\n      This Court noted in Critical Air:\n\n      It is undisputed that Critical Air is a private corporation and not\n      an agency of state government, a political subdivision of the\n      state, or an institution, agency or organ of government whose\n      status and authority is derived from state law.\n\nId. at *2.\n\n      Similarly, it is undisputed that UIW is a private university and not a\n\nstate government agency. UIW’s argument is that the authority to hire and\n\ncommission peace officers somehow transforms it into an “institution,\n\n\n\n                                      6\n\fagency, or organ of government.” See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code\n\n§ 101.001(3)(D). The authorizing statute does not justify this interpretation.\n\n           Parallel statutes in the Education Code authorize “the governing\n\nboards” of the universities to “employ and commission peace officers.” See\n\nTex. Educ. Code § 51.203 (for “state institutions of higher education”) and\n\n§ 51.212 (for “private institutions of higher education”). There is no\n\nprecedent for the argument that granting this authority transforms a private\n\ninstitution into a government institution, agency or organ. As argued in\n\nAppellees’ Motion to Dismiss, this Court should dismiss this appeal for want\n\nof jurisdiction.\n\nII.        Neither UIW nor its Campus Police is a “governmental unit”\n           under the Texas Tort Claims Act.3\n\n           UIW expressly seeks the protections of the Texas Tort Claims Act as a\n\n“governmental unit.” CR at 120 (UIW’s First Amended Answer at ¶ 63-64).\n\nUIW argues that its police department draws its right to exist from a statute\n\n(Tex. Educ. Code § 51.212) and that the department and its officers are\n\nlicensed by the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement, a “regulatory state\n\nagency.” Id. UIW, in its appellate brief, cites no case law holding that any part\n\nof a private university is a “governmental unit.”\n\n3   Section II, with the exception of footnote 3, is copied verbatim from Appellees’ Motion to Dismiss for Want\n      of Jurisdiction.\n                                                        7\n\f      A.      No Texas court has ever held that a private institution is\n              a “governmental unit” in the absence of a specific\n              statute and government funding of the service at issue.\n\n      No Texas court has ever held that a private, non-profit institution of\n\nhigher education is a “governmental unit” in the absence of a statute defining\n\nthe institution and its actions as such. In Klein v. Hernandez, 315, S.W.2d 1,\n\n2 (Tex. 2010), the plaintiff sued Baylor College of Medicine for malpractice\n\nby its physicians at Ben Taub Hospital, a public hospital. The Supreme Court\n\nnoted that:\n\n      Baylor [College of Medicine] is a private, non-profit medical\n      school, but is also a ‘supported medical school,’ which means that\n      it has contracts with the Texas Higher Education Coordinating\n      Board and receives state funding specifically allocated for\n      training physicians who provide medical care at public hospitals\n      such as Ben Taub.\n\nThe Court noted that private medical school derived its status as a\n\n“governmental unit” from Tex. Health & Safety Code § 312.006(a), which\n\ndefines Baylor as a “governmental unit” when its doctors are working at\n\npublic hospitals. Id. at 8.\n\n      In contrast to the Baylor College of Medicine, UIW has no claim to a\n\ncontract with a state agency, to receiving state funding, or to a statute\n\ndefining any part of the university as a “governmental unit.” UIW does not\n\neven address the implications of the Texas Supreme Court’s Klein holding,\n\n\n                                      8\n\fchoosing instead to rely almost completely on LTTS Charter School, Inc. v.\n\nC2 Construction, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2540054\"><a href=\"/opinion/2540054/ltts-charter-school-inc-v-c2-constr-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 2011). See Appellant’s Brief at 24-\n\n26.\n\n      The Supreme Court, in LTTS Charter School, held that an open-\n\nenrollment charter school operated as part of the public school system is a\n\n“governmental unit.” Id. at 76. The Supreme Court’s opinion drew a vigorous\n\ndissent (id. at 82), and the case is easily distinguishable from UIW’s claims.\n\nCharter schools by statute are “part of the public school system” which bears\n\n“the primary responsibility for implementing the state's system of public\n\neducation.” Id. at 82. Charter schools receive government funding and\n\noperate within the Texas public school testing system. Id. at 74.\n\n      UIW, by contrast, has specifically and purposely chosen to operate\n\noutside Texas’ system of public higher education. See Tex. Educ.

Little, 422 S.W.3d S.W.3d 37, 40 (Tex.App.—San Antonio\n\n2013, no pet.) as supporting its argument. Both cases are distinguishable. In\n\nZacharie, this Court held that San Antonio’s Water System was a city agent\n\nand thus entitled to immunity.\n\n      In Leon Valley, this Court held that an economic development\n\ncorporation’s (“EDC”) statutory designation as a “governmental unit” under\n\nTex. Loc. Gov. Code § 505.106(b) did not protect it from contractual liability,\n\nalthough the status did authorized the EDC to file an interlocutory appeal. In\n\nallowing the interlocutory appeal to proceed, this Court followed the EDC’s\n\nenabling statute: “For purposes of Chapter 101, Civil Practice and Remedies\n\nCode, a Type B corporation is a governmental unit and the corporation’s\n\nactions are governmental functions.” Tex. Loc. Gov. Code § 505.106(b).\n\nNeither this Court nor any other Texas court has held that that a private\n\n\n\n                                      10\n\finstitution is a governmental unit in the absence of a specific statute and\n\ngovernment funding of the services at issue.\n\n      B.    That a statute authorizes UIW to establish a Campus\n            Police Department does not make the UIW Campus\n            Police a “governmental unit.”\n\n      Section 101.001(3)(D) of the Civil Practices and Remedies Code defines\n\na “governmental unit” as\n\n      any other institution, agency, or organ of government the status\n      and authority of which are derived from the Constitution of\n      Texas or from laws passed by the legislature under the\n      constitution.\n\nUIW argues that a Texas statute—Tex. Educ. Code § 51.212—authorizes the\n\ncreation of UIW’s police department, that its officers are licensed by a state\n\nagency, and that they enforce state law. Appellant’s Brief at 17-24.\n\n      So, UIW’s argument goes, the UIW Campus Police Department is an\n\n“institution, agency, or organ of government the…authority of which [is]\n\nderived from…laws passed by the legislature.” The argument proves too\n\nmuch ignoring the fact that UIW as private university is not an “institution,\n\nagency, or organ of government.”\n\n      The only case applying this statute to any extent is LTTS Charter\n\nSchool, 342 S.W.3d at 80. The Supreme Court held only that § 101.001(3)(D)\n\ndoes not require a statute specifically establishing the government agency.\n\n\n                                      11\n\fThe Court’s holding, however, is primarily based on Tex. Educ. Code\n\n§ 12.105: “An open-enrollment charter school is part of the public school\n\nsystem” and the public schools are governmental units. See §101.001(3)(B).\n\n      UIW’s argument misinterprets §101.001(3)(D). According to the\n\nSupreme Court, an “open-enrollment charter school” is an “institution,\n\nagency, or organ of government” because it is “part of the public school\n\nsystem.” LTTS Charter School 342 S.W.3d at 82. Unlike open enrollment\n\npublic charter schools, UIW has no claim to being part of a “state institution\n\nof higher education” or part of the “field of public higher education.” See Tex.\n\nEduc. Code § 51.203 (enabling statute for police departments at state\n\nuniversities) and § 61.002 (enabling statute for the Texas Higher Education\n\nCoordinating Board). UIW has specifically chosen to avoid the extensive\n\nstate regulation of higher education, such as tuition regulation and degree\n\nofferings. See Tex. Educ. Code Title 3 generally.\n\n      Textually—as the statute requires—UIW cannot establish that it is a\n\ngovernmental “institution, agency, or organ.” See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.\n\nCode § 101.001(3)(D). Merely being an “institution, agency, or organ” whose\n\nexistence is enabled by a statute and governed by a state agency does make\n\nthe “institution, agency, or organ” a “governmental unit.”\n\n\n\n                                      12\n\f        For example, Texas lawyers draw their right to practice law in Texas\n\ncourts and to form law firms from the State Bar of Texas, “a public\n\ncorporation and an administrative agency of the judicial department of\n\ngovernment.” See Tex. Govt. Code § 81.011. Only persons licensed by the\n\nState Bar of Texas can be employed as lawyers in law firms.\n\n        Texas barbers draw their authority to “perform any act of barbering”\n\nfrom Tex. Occ. Code § 1601.251 and Texas barbershops draw their authority\n\nto exist from Tex. Occ. Code § 1601.301. Barbers and barbershops are\n\ngoverned by a state licensing agency, the Texas Department of Licensing and\n\nRegulation (“TDLR”), a “regulatory state agency,” pursuant to administrative\n\nrules. See Tex. Admin. Code § 82.1, et seq. Neither barbers nor barbershops\n\nare turned into a “governmental unit” by these statutes.\n\n        The same could be said for numerous other respectable occupations.\n\nBut neither barbershops nor law firms are entitled to call themselves\n\n“governmental units” and claim the immunities of the TTCA when sued in\n\ntort.\n\n\n\n\n                                      13\n\f          C.      Allowing UIW’s campus police to enforce state and\n                  municipal law in limited circumstances does not turn\n                  UIW or its police department into a “governmental\n                  unit.”\n\n           UIW argues that the authority of its Campus Police and the\n\nindividually licensed officer to enforce state law bolsters its claim to be a\n\n“governmental unit.” See Appellant’s Brief at 19-23. The truth, however, is\n\nthat any person can enforce a good portion of Texas criminal law without a\n\nTCOLE license.\n\n          Article 14.01(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure allows:\n\n          A peace officer or any other person, may, without a warrant,\n          arrest an offender when the offense is committed in his presence\n          or within his view, if the offense is one classed as a felony or as\n          an offense against the public peace.\n\nThe statute grants both peace officers and private citizens the same rights of\n\nwarrantless arrest for the two broadly defined categories of crimes.

App. 1948) (“Any individual may make a ‘citizen’s arrest’ under that\n\nprovision, provided that all applicable legal requirements are met.”)4\n\n\n4\n    The best that UIW can argue is that the officers that UIW employs or commissions have a broader\n      authority to enforce state law than private citizens have. There is nothing about this grant that somehow\n      transforms UIW into an “institution, agency, or organ of government.”\n                                                       14\n\f      No Texas court has ever held that a statute authorizing a private entity\n\nto enforce state law makes that entity an “institution, agency, or organ of\n\ngovernment” for purposes of the Texas Tort Claims Act. See Tex. Code of\n\nCrim. Proc. § 2.12 for an extended list of 36 types of peace officers and § 14.03\n\nfor the authority given to the officers. UIW Campus Police are “officers\n\ncommissioned under… Subchapter E, Chapter 51, Education Code.” Tex.\n\nCode. Crim. Proc. § 2.12(8). The officers’ authority is defined by § 14.03.\n\n      In its application for a “law enforcement agency number,” UIW\n\nidentifies its “Requesting Governmental Body” as “University of the\n\nIncarnate Word.” C.R. 206. UIW’s Board of Trustees approved a resolution\n\nsupporting the formation of the police department. C.R. 350. As noted above,\n\nTexas law gives “governing boards of private institutions of higher\n\neducation” the authority “to employ and commission police officers.” Tex.\n\nEduc. Code § 51.212. Nothing about this process turns UIW into a\n\n“governmental unit.” UIW’s Campus Police Department receives no\n\ngovernment funding and has no contract with any government agency.\n\n      The cases UIW cites in the appellate brief do not support its argument;\n\nthey instead hold that private entities subject themselves to Constitutional\n\nviolations by their involvement with governmental functions. Appellant’s\n\nBrief at 19-20.\n                                       15\n\f      For example, in Evans v. Newton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107137\"><a href=\"/opinion/107137/evans-v-newton/\"><span class=\"volume\">382</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1966), the Supreme\n\nCourt held that private managers of a public park could not enforce racial\n\nsegregation in the park. In Rosborough v. Management & Training Corp.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"33219\"><a href=\"/opinion/33219/rosborough-v-mgmt-training-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">459</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 461 (5th Cir. 2003), the Fifth Circuit found that “private prison-\n\nmanagement corporations and their employees may be sued under § 1983 by\n\na prisoner who has suffered a constitutional injury.” In other words, the cases\n\ncited by UIW hold that a private entity subjects itself to greater, not less,\n\nliability by taking on a government function. This is consistent with the\n\nstatute providing limited immunity for peace officers employed by private\n\nuniversities. See Tex. Educ. Code § 51.212(b)(1).\n\nIII. Even if UIW is a governmental entity, the Texas Tort Claims\n     Act does not bar the Reduses negligence claims because they\n     arise from a death caused by tangible use of tangible\n     personal property.\n\n      UIW argues that the Reduses claims are barred by the TTCA because\n\nthey are “negligence claims that arise from an intentional tort.” See\n\nAppellant’s Brief at 27-33. As noted above, the Reduses filed an amended\n\npetition following the denial of the plea to the jurisdiction. Exhibit 1. The\n\nReduses have not made any intentional tort claims against either defendant,\n\nand there is no evidence in the record of the circumstances of the shooting.\n\n\n\n\n                                      16\n\f      As this Court knows, the TTCA does not waive sovereign immunity for\n\nintentional torts. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 101.057. The federal court,\n\nin its remand order, held that “Plaintiffs’ claims—negligence, gross\n\nnegligence, respondeat superior liability, and wrongful death—arise from\n\nstate law and are valid causes of action under state law.” CR at 399.\n\n      Although a governmental unit is immune from intentional tort claims,\n\nan injured party may still pursue a separate negligence claim arising out of\n\nthe same facts. Young v. City of Dimmitt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1639678\"><a href=\"/opinion/1639678/young-v-city-of-dimmitt/\"><span class=\"volume\">787</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 51 (Tex. 1990). A\n\ngovernmental unit is liable for personal injury and death caused by a\n\ncondition or use of tangible personal or real property if the governmental\n\nunit would, were it a private person, be liable to the claimant according to\n\nTexas law. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 101.021(2). Firearms are\n\ntangible personal property under the TTCA. See Morin v.

This is misleading. Cabazos pleaded guilty to\n\nevading arrest in a separate criminal action and then filed a civil lawsuit\n\nagainst Harris County and a Sherriff’s Deputy whom he never served and\n\nwho never appeared in the case. Id. at 108. The undisputed evidence before\n                                      17\n\fthe Court was that the deputy intentionally shot the plaintiff. Id. at 112.\n\n      UIW’s reliance upon Texas Dept. of Public Safety v. Petta, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1772033\"><a href=\"/opinion/1772033/texas-dept-of-public-safety-v-petta/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 2001) is wholly unfounded. Petta was convicted of fleeing or\n\nattempting to elude a police officer in her criminal case, which arose out of\n\nthe same facts as her civil action against a State Trooper employed by the\n\nTexas Department of Public Safety. Id at 576. The basis of the summary\n\njudgment dismissal, which was upheld by the Supreme Court, was that Petta\n\nwas collaterally estopped from re-litigating the underlying facts after her\n\nguilty conviction. Id at 577.\n\n      In both Petta and Cabazos, plaintiffs specifically pleaded claims not\n\nwaived by the TTCA. As discussed above, the TTCA does not bar the Reduses’\n\nnegligence claims and, in any case, UIW is not a “governmental unit.” Officer\n\nCarter was simply an employee of a private educational institution.\n\n      In City of San Augustine, v.

The city appealed both the trial court’s denial of its plea to\n\nthe jurisdiction on sovereign immunity and its motion for summary\n\njudgment on official immunity. In upholding the trial court's denial of the\n\nplea, the court considered only the plaintiffs' pleadings; it rejected the city's\n\nreliance on the summary judgment evidence. Id. at 739-40.\n                                       18\n\f      The plaintiffs alleged that a police officer “negligently shot and killed”\n\nthe decedent, and that the police officer negligently used his pistol when\n\n“such use was not reasonable or reasonably necessary to control or subdue a\n\ncitizen and negligently endangered those in the vicinity.” Id. Relying solely\n\non the pleadings, the court held that the intentional tort exclusion did not\n\nbar the suit. Id. The Court should deny UIW’s Plea to the Jurisdiction.\n\nIV.   UIW’s argument regarding respondeat superior is not\n      properly part of a plea to the jurisdiction and should be\n      dismissed for insufficient notice under Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a.\n\n      UIW argues that, as a matter of law, it cannot be held liable in\n\nrespondeat superior because Carter is a licensed Texas peace officer whose\n\nimmunity is governed by Tex. Educ. Code § 51.212(b) and other statutes\n\ndefining the authority of licensed peace officers. Appellant’s Brief at 33-38.\n\nUIW made the same argument in its Plea to the Jurisdiction. CR at 144-148.\n\n      Sovereign immunity has two components: immunity from suit and\n\nimmunity from liability. See Tooke v.

UIW’s argument regarding dismissal of Officer Carter fails\n      because the UIW Campus Police is not a “governmental\n      unit” and the TTCA election of remedies does not apply.\n      UIW finally argues that this Court must dismiss defendant\n\nChristopher Carter under the TTCA’s election of remedies provision. See\n\nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 101.106 and Appellant’s Brief at 38-39. As\n\nexplained above, UIW is not a “governmental unit” and is not entitled to the\n\nbenefits of the TTCA.
