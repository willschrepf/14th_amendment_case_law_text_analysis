Meldorf, Hixson, Tennessee, for the appellant, Masoud Bajestani.\n\nSelma Cash Paty, Chattanooga, Tennessee, for the appellee, Maryam Ghorashi-Bajestani.\n\f                                          OPINION\n\n                                         Background\n\n\n              Wife and Husband were married in July of 2000, first in an Islamic ceremony,\nand then again in a ceremony at the courthouse in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Two minor\nchildren were born of the marriage. Husband has adult children from a previous marriage.\nIn February of 2008, Wife sued Husband for divorce.\n\n              Wife testified at trial that she was born on March 23, 1968 in Iran. Wife has\ndual citizenship in the United States and Iran. Wife holds an engineering degree that she\nobtained in Florida. Wife stated: “That was my dream always to move to United States and\nbecome an engineer. I couldn’t compete or pass the exams in Iran as a female in that field.”\nWife speaks Persian, English, and German, and stated that she did not think anyone had a\nhard time understanding her. Wife admitted she is in good health and has no physical\nproblems.\n\n              Wife stopped working outside the home in July of 2001 when she gave birth\nto the parties’ first child. Wife’s last job outside the home was at Alstom Power in\nChattanooga where she worked as a mechanical engineer and earned $43,000 per year. Wife\nworked at Alstom Power for seven or eight months. When the parties married, Wife had a\nstudent loan of $21,000. Wife paid off this loan with money she earned while working at\nAlstom Power during the marriage. The parties’ second child was born in August of 2003.\n\n              When asked if she planned to return to working outside the home, Wife stated:\n\n       I feel that I have a job, that is taking care of my kids, already. This is the most\n       important job I’ve ever had, and my kids are very small. And if I want to go\n       back to work force, I need some special education, I need refresh courses and\n       I need to get back to that standard that - - to apply for a job. It’s been eight\n       years I haven’t worked. There’s so many things I’ve forgotten.\n\n               But the most important thing that I don’t want to forget is that my kids\n       are most important and the money that I might be able to make outside - - and\n       my kids don’t have an uncle, cousin, grandparents, so I really think that I need\n       to stay with my kids.\n\n            Wife testified that her expenses per month were $14,567. Wife also calculated\nwhat her expenses would be if she obtained a job outside the home making $43,000 to\n\n                                               -2-\n\f$45,000 per year. She testified that if she obtained such a job, her expenses would be\n$17,000 per month due to:\n\n       Additional expenses, the cost of the clothing, car maintenance, laundry, all\n       those things that - - the kids will have to stay at school longer hours, it’s going\n       to add to that, their food, the grocery, the lunch outside, all of these, the gas,\n       is going to add up.\n\nWhen asked if there would be a benefit to her obtaining a job outside the home, Wife stated:\n“No, not at all. Actually, it’s better if I don’t let a stranger raise my kids rather than me stay\nhome and be with my kids.” When asked if she was aware of jobs in the community that pay\nbetween $70,000 and $80,000 that she could apply for, Wife stated: “My kids need me\nmore.” Wife admitted that the school her children attend has an after-school program that\nruns until 6 p.m., which her children could attend. She also admitted that there is a pre-care\nprogram at the school, and the children could be delivered to the school before 8 a.m.\n\n              Wife testified that during the marriage, the family would take two or three trips\nper year and further stated: “we have an overseas, once-a-year overseas trip with the kids,\nand the other trips would be to New York City visiting relatives, Virginia.” When asked\nwhere she shops for herself and the children, Wife stated: “We go to New York to shop or\nAtlanta, or on our trips, if we went to London, we do those kind of shopping, going around\non tours, we went to Alaska.” Since filing for divorce, Wife has traveled to New York,\nAlaska, and Washington, D.C.\n\n               Husband was 53 years old at the time of trial. He testified that he is an Iranian\ncitizen, and that he also has been a United States citizen since 1982. Husband has lived in\nthe United States since 1975. Husband has three grown children from a previous marriage.\nHusband owns the home the parties lived in during the marriage and testified that he was\nawarded this home in his prior divorce. The parties are debt-free except for the mortgage on\nthe home.\n\n               Husband works for TVA. Husband described his job stating: “I’m the vice\npresident for Watts Bar Unit 2 project. It’s a new nuclear plant that’s being built and this is\ngoing to be the first new plant after 20 years that is going to come online in the United\nStates.” Husband holds a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering and a master’s degree.\nHusband signed a contract for his current job in October of 2007. He stated: “The contract\nis for five years and one year after the plant comes online. So it’s for a total of six years.\nThe contract that is written, it actually says that when the plant comes online and runs for\nsome period of time reliably and safely, then there are some incentives. So if you add\neverything, it’s a six-year contract, essentially.” Per the contract, Husband had four years left\n\n                                               -3-\n\fto complete the job as of the time of trial. Husband has no future contracts.\n\n             In 2005 Husband moved to Huntsville, Alabama for his job. Wife and the\nchildren remained in Tennessee. When asked why she remained in Tennessee, Wife stated:\n\n       Because the kids were going already to school here. They had already started\n       to school. They were in the middle of the year, of their school year. And\n       [Husband] told me that project is going to be done, finished earlier than two\n       years. He’s trying to push the process to be done in earlier than two years.\n\nWhen questioned further, Wife admitted that at that time the parties’ older child was\nattending pre-school, and the younger child was only three years old. Husband testified that\nbecause he was “assigned to a city outside my central station…,” TVA provided Husband\nwith housing and paid his expenses during the time he worked in Alabama. Husband lived\nin Huntsville, Alabama for eighteen or nineteen months and saw Wife and children on\nweekends.\n\n               At trial, Husband stated: “I’m willing to pay for my children’s education,\nprivate school, and other expenses that comes with other education like piano lesson, other\nthan just tuition for the school.” He further stated that he anticipates helping his children\nwith college.\n\n                The parties were married in 2000 and that year Husband had taxable income\nof approx $300,000. In 2001, Husband had taxable income of approximately $236,000.\nWife’s W2 form for 2001 shows wages of approximately $24,000 for the approximately\nseven months that she worked outside the home during that year. In 2002, Husband’s income\nwas approximately $115,000. Husband’s income for 2003 was approximately $155,000. In\n2004, Husband had income of approximately $119,00. Husband’s income for 2005 was\napproximately $300,000. In 2006, Husband had income of approximately $594,00. Husband\ntestified that his base salary in 2006 was approximately $240,000, and that the remaining\namount consisted of bonuses. Husband’s wages including bonuses for 2007 were\napproximately $599,000. However, in 2007 Husband declared approximately $2,293,000\nin taxable income because Husband withdrew $1.5 million out of his TVA deferred\ncompensation account in 2007.\n\n                Husband has a contract for deferred compensation for Watts Bar Unit 2. He\nstated: “Deferred compensation, this is a contract that was put in place, essentially what they\ncall it is the golden handcuff, to essentially to get you to stay for the duration of the whole\nproject. But you have to meet certain requirements to be able to get the money that’s in this\ncontract.… Specifically, budget, schedule, that if you miss - - and the safe and reliable\n\n                                              -4-\n\foperation of the unit after it comes online. And if you miss any of this, essentially, you won’t\nget this deferred compensation.”\n\n               Husband testified: “That bonus is based on performance of the project,\nperformance of the certain milestones that you are to meet, budget, schedule and TVA’s\noverall performance.” Husband testified that for 2008, “TVA overall performance has not\nbeen good because of various issues that we have had this year, drought. The performance\nof the fossil units and nuclear units hasn’t been good, so we missed a lot of milestones.”\n\n             With regard to the $1.5 withdrawal from his deferred compensation account,\nHusband stated:\n\n       The reason I withdrew that money was because this money, the deferred\n       compensation money is actually in the market, you know, invested in the\n       market. So I looked at the market and the market wasn’t going to go\n       anywhere; actually it was losing its value, the dollar was losing its value, and\n       I had this opportunity that I discussed with [Wife] to invest some money\n       outside the U.S. and specifically buy some property back in Tehran, Iran. So\n       I decided to withdraw that money and invest it outside the U.S.\n\nHusband stated that he and Wife were planning on sending a little over $1 million for this\npurpose and that to date he has sent $600,000. Husband testified that the money he sent to\nIran has not been invested in anything because he did not fulfill his commitment to send the\nfull amount. Husband claims he can get the money back with some loss of percentage due\nto conversion. He testified that the money is not in a bank, but instead is in his brother-in-\nlaw’s possession.\n\n              Husband withdrew the $1.5 million by claiming financial hardship and an\nimmediate and heavy need for housing. At trial, Husband admitted that he did not have a\nfinancial hardship at the time he made the withdrawal. He further admitted that he was not\ntaking the money for housing but for an investment. Husband had to pay taxes on the\nwithdrawal such that the net amount that Husband received was $975,000.\n\n               Husband sent the money “to a bank in Canada and from Canada to Tehran,”\nIran via two transfers. Husband testified that at the time he made the first transfer he did not\nthink he had received the divorce papers. Husband testified that when he went to Wife’s\nattorney’s office to pick up the divorce papers, no one told him about the restraining order,\nand that he “actually never read the whole paper” because he was upset.\n\n              In addition to the $1.5 million withdrawal, Husband made other withdrawals\n\n                                              -5-\n\ffrom his deferred compensation account during the marriage. Exhibits introduced at trial\nshow withdrawals of approximately $37,000, $194,000, and $85,000, among others.\nHusband testified that he loaned money to his sister and her husband. A copy of a check\nintroduced at trial shows that Husband wrote a check to his sister in 2003 for $40,000.\nHusband stated that his sister paid him back approximately $6,500, and that Husband does\nnot expect her and her husband to pay back the remainder of the loaned monies. Husband\nalso testified that he has been paying some of his sick parent’s expenses. Husband stated:\n“I’ve been supporting my parents for the last 20-some years ….” In October Husband sent\nhis parents $10,000, which he testified was to pay for their hospital bills. Husband testified\nthat he would estimate that he has sent his parents approximately $8,000 to $10,000 per year.\nHusband also has paid $1,000 per month plus all expenses for his children from his previous\nmarriage. Husband later testified that he had sent $3,000 to his daughter from his previous\nmarriage and, when questioned further, stated that his earlier answer of $1,000 referred to\nthe alimony he paid to his previous wife.\n\n             Husband claimed that CD accounts in both the parties’ names were actually his\nseparate property. He testified:\n\n       Before I got married I had two CD accounts: one was with AmSouth, and the\n       other one was SunTrust Bank. And over the years it went from one CD\n       account to another. When it matured, I put them in another account. And all\n       the money that we didn’t spend from year to year I added to those, to different\n       CD accounts. And all the CD accounts, they were all in my name until last\n       year when she specifically asked me that she wants to be added to - - her name\n       to be added to the CD accounts. So we both went to Regions Bank and I\n       added her name to my CD accounts.\n\nHusband asserted that at the time the parties married, one of his CD accounts was worth\napproximately $58,000, and the other approximately $40,000.\n\n              Husband testified that he and Wife talked about the possibility of her returning\nto work. He stated that he told Wife that there were different companies paying people with\nWife’s experience and level of education between $70,000 and $80,000. Husband testified\nthat Wife’s “engineering degree and experience that she has when she worked at Alstom,\nthat’s adequate to get a decent job.”\n\n              After trial, the Trial Court entered its detailed order on April 16, 2009 finding\nand holding, inter alia:\n\n       K. The Court finds that [Wife] has grounds for divorce and should be granted\n\n                                              -6-\n\fa divorce on the grounds of Inappropriate Marital conduct.\n\n                                     ***\n\nC. The Court finds that the [Husband’s] home, located at 619 Grand Mountain\nDrive, Chattanooga, TN is his premarital property as defined by T.C.A. § 36-4-\n121(a)(1)(B); the liability for the mortgage at SunTrust Bank is solely\n[Husband’s]. However, the home has increased $50,000 in value during the\nmarriage. In addition, the mortgage has been reduced from $177,000 to\n$88,000 during the marriage which results in an additional increase of $89,000\nin equity paid with income received during the marriage.\n\nThe Court further finds that throughout the marriage, [Husband] never\ntransferred title to the property to [Wife], nor increased the debt on the\nproperty to the financial detriment of [Wife]. Neither did he ever treat the\nproperty as marital property. Transmutation occurs when previously separate\nproperty is treated in such [a] way as to give evidence of an intention that it\nbecome marital property. This can occur if property is purchased with separate\nfunds but then titled to both parties to the marriage, or it can occur by deeding\nseparate property into the names of both parties with the intent to make a gift\nof the property to the marital estate. McClellan v. McClellan, 874 S.W.2d 350\n(Tn. App. [sic] 1993).\n\n[Husband’s] premarital home was thus never transmuted into marital property\nand remains the sole and exclusive property of [Husband].\n\nD. The Court finds that the parties’ agreed division of non-vehicular personal\nproperty results in [Wife] receiving assets valued at $14,750 and [Husband]\nassets valued at receiving $9,060. Ex. 51 and 40.\n\nE. The court further finds that the parties’ agreed division of vehicles results\nin [Wife] receiving $18,000 and [Husband] receiving $15,800. Ex. 68, p.1.\n\nF. The Court finds that $94,186 of [Husband’s] 401(k) is a premarital asset.\nEx. 65 and 27. The current value of said 401(k) is $251,012. Ex. 74. Thus,\n$156,826 of the increase of the 401(k) is a marital asset.\n\nG. The Court finds that the TVA Pension is not able to be calculated under the\nrules of said Plan. Therefore, the portion acquired during marriage shall be\ncalculated as a fraction, the numerator of which shall be 8.25, being the\n\n                                       -7-\n\fnumber of years of marriage between these parties, and the denominator shall\nbe the total years in which [Husband] shall have been a member of said Plan,\nfrom the date of his initial membership until the date he retires from TVA. Ex.\n5.\n\nH. The Court finds that the Regions Bank CD is a marital asset. In 2006,\n[Husband] specifically put his wife’s name on the Certificate of Deposit.\nTransmutation is brought about “by placing separate property in the name of\nboth spouses.” Batson v Batson, 769 S.W.2d 849, 858 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1988).\nThe current value of said CD is $1,050,000. Ex. 68.\n\nI. [Husband] claims as his separate property on “Exhibit 58\" $250,000 in\ndeferred compensation with TVA. The Court finds that as of October 2000\n[Husband] did have $247,258 in his deferred compensation plan (Exhibit 75).\nHowever, the court finds that [Husband] has withdrawn from his deferred\ncompensation account $37,083 October 2, 2000, $194,221 on August 2007 and\n$85,000 September 23, 2005 (Exhibit 9, 10, 31, 90). Having withdrawn from\nhis deferred compensation plan more money than he had in the fund when the\nparties married, the Court finds that there is no longer any separate money in\nhis deferred compensation plan. [Husband] also paid alimony and child\nsupport to his first wife and family, gave $40,000 to his sister, and gave\nthousands of dollars to his parents in Iran during the marriage. The current\nvalue of [Husband’s] TVA Deferred Compensation Plan is $2,730,141. The\nCourt further finds that the afore-stated value is the remainder after the\n[$1,500,000] withdrawn therefrom by [Husband] on December 24, 2007. Ex.\n13.\n\n       1. Before [Husband] withdrew $1.5 million from his deferred\n       compensation account, he had over four million dollars in\n       deferred compensation (Exhibit 25). He deposited the $975,000\n       he received from the withdrawal after taxes were withheld in the\n       joint CD account (Ex. 23) To withdraw the 1.5 million,\n       [Husband] falsely certified that he was making a “hardship\n       withdrawal” for “housing” (Exhibit 30). He admits he knew his\n       application was the same as a sworn affidavit and that the\n       statements that the financial hardship is “my immediate and\n       heavy financial need” and that the stated purpose of the\n       withdrawal for “housing” were not true. Because of the\n       embargo on doing business with Iran, from the $975,000\n       deposited in the joint CD account, [Husband] transferred\n\n                                      -8-\n\f       $600,000 to a bank in Canada to be transferred to his brother-in-\n       law in Iran to be invested (Ex. 29). He testified he did not know\n       where the money was, if it was drawing interest or whose name\n       it is deposited in but he could get it back.\n\n       2. The remainder was placed in the Regions Bank CD where it\n       remains.\n\nJ. Although [Husband] claims the $300,000 he transferred to Iran on the day\nhe was served with this divorce and $300,000 he transferred February 14,\n2008, three days after the divorce complaint was filed are his separate funds,\nthe Court finds this money was earned during the marriage and is marital\nproperty. [Husband] claims that he did not read the injunction against\ntransferring and disposing of funds before he made the transfers. The Court\nfinds that these transfers were made after [Husband] knew or should have\nknown that he was enjoined from withdrawing these funds from the joint CD\naccount. The Court finds it makes no difference whether [Husband] knew or\ndid not know about the injunction, the money was admittedly withdrawn from\nthe joint CD account and is a marital asset to be divided with his wife. Wife\ntestified she was against this investment because of the political situation\nbetween Iran and the United States.\n\nK. The following assets are found to be [Husband’s] separate assets: $94,185\nin [Husband’s] 401(k) Plan in July 2000 (Ex. 26); $119,214 in his TVA\nRetirement Annuity; that part of his TVA pension earned prior to the marriage\nand the part earned following the dissolution of this marriage; a boat; two\nrefrigerators; a washer; a dryer; a stereo; a camera; and two Persian rugs.\n\nL. The following assets are found to be [Wife’s] separate property: all her\njewelry; fifty percent interest in house in Iran given by her parents; furniture\nshe owned prior to the marriage.\n\n                                     ***\n\n       In dividing the assets, the Court considered the fact that [Husband]\nowned the residence prior to the marriage and that during the marriage about\n$89,000 in equity resulted from the payments of principal, interest and\ninsurance from money earned during the marriage. Brock v. Brock, 941\nS.W.2d 896, 901, [sic] (Tenn. Ct. App. 1996).\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f       There is no question that by the wrongful withdrawing of $1.5 million\ndeferred compensation in 2007 and incurring tax liability of $525,000 withheld\nby TVA (Ex. 13) and an additional $51,000 tax, a total of $576,000, [Husband]\ndissipated $576,000 of the marital estate. [Husband] did not need the money.\nIf he had not withdrawn it, it could have been distributed to Wife at a much\nlower tax rate.\n\n        When [Husband] married [Wife], he had $72,579.57 in AmSouth\nchecking, $103,694.87 in AmSouth CD’s and $38,000 in SunTrust CD[’]s, a\ntotal of $214,229.44. (Exhibit 58 of [Husband’s] responses to Interrogatories\ndated May 21, 2008 with his list of Assets and Liabilities). He claims the\namount of these accounts should be set aside to him as his separate property.\nBoth parties testified that after they married, [Husband] put his wife on his\nbank accounts. He referred to the Regions Bank account as “our” account and\nstated “we” put everything in one account. In 2006, he specifically put his\nwife’s name on the certificate of deposit account in which there was\n$1,713,827 on January 31, 2008 (Ex. 39, 69).\n\n        [Husband] admits that he paid alimony and child support after their\nmarriage to his first wife and family (Exhibit 93). He sent thousands of dollars\nto his parents in Iran during this marriage. He gave or loaned $40,000 to his\nsister, Sepideh Maghandam. He cannot identify any account in which the\nmoney he had when he married is now located.\n\n      Transmutation is brought about “by placing separate property in the\nname of both spouses.” Batson v. Batson, 769, [sic] S.W.2d 849, 858 (Tenn.\nCt. App. 1988).\n\n       During the marriage, when parties treat their separate property in such\na way as to show their intent that it become marital property, transmutation\noccurs.\n\n       Although [Husband] claims the $300,000 he transferred to Iran on the\nday he was served with this divorce and $300,000 he transferred February 14,\n2008, three days after the divorce complaint was filed are his separate funds,\nthe Court finds this money was earned during the marriage and is marital\nproperty.\n\n                                     ***\n\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fA. [Husband] is employed by the Tennessee Valley Authority. His present\ncontract is for the position of Vice President of Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, Unit\n2. Ex. 4 and 33. Said contract expires in 2012, but because of possible\nperformance bonuses, benefits may be paid through 2013. [Husband] has no\ncontract of employment beyond 2012 with TVA or any other employer.\n[Husband] has testified that he reasonably believes his employment under the\ncontract will actually be completed during 2011.\n\nB. [Husband’s] present income, including bonuses, is $619,000 a year. (Ex.\n72).\n\nC. [Husband] has received all deferred compensation disbursements to which\nhe is entitled under his previous contacts for Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant. The\nfinal such disbursement was received on July 23, 2008, Ex. 11.\n\nD. [Husband] is presently under contract to receive deferred compensation,\nbased upon his completion of the contract and his attainment of certain\nperformance goals. However, the deferred compensation can only be received\nif he remains a TVA employee during the term of said contract and completes\nsaid entire contract.\n\n       1. The amount of said deferred compensation which he receives\n       varies depending upon his attainment of certain goals.\n\n       2. As with his deferred compensation under his Browns Ferry\n       Contract, said deferred compensation from Watts Bar will be\n       paid into a deferred compensation account and not directly to\n       [Husband]. Because the deferred compensation is contingent,\n       the Court did not include it in the child support calculation.\n\nE. Further, said deferred compensation is paid to [Husband], if earned, only\nat certain times and any withdrawal of said funds by him from said deferred\ncompensation account is a taxable event to him at the time they are withdrawn.\n\nF. [Husband’s] one-time withdrawal on December 24, 2007, Ex. 13, of\n$1,500,000 ($985,000, after taxes) from a deferred compensation plan\nestablished by his employer did not represent earnings for purposes of\ncalculating child support; said withdrawal was an asset transfer for the\npurposes of purchasing and developing a piece of real property in Iran.\n\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fG. [Husband’s] earnings during the marriage were $293,437.58 in 2000;\n$212,532 plus $6,212 in interest in 2001; $115,786 plus $562 interest in 2002;\n$155,196 plus $155 interest in 2003; $119,657 plus $7 interest in 2004;\n$300,841 plus $199 interest in 2005 (all from testimony of [Husband]);\n$594,344 plus $870 interest in 2006 (Ex. 15), and $619,885.54 plus $14,895\ninterest in 2007 (Ex. 14).\n\nH. [Wife] is a licensed civil engineer with a baccalaureate degree.\n\nI. [Wife] speaks three languages, has no physical or mental limitations, and is\ncapable of working.\n\nJ. [Wife’s] last salary was $44,000 a year in 2001 from Alstom Power.\n\n       1. This was her first job as a civil engineer after obtaining her\n       degree.\n\n       2. [Wife] worked for approximately 7 months, until near the\n       birth of the parties’ first child.\n\n       3. In 2001, [Wife] retained all of her earnings, $24,286.47\n       rather than contributing them to the family income; she used her\n       earnings to pay her pre-marital debt for her college education\n       with the agreement of [Husband].\n\nK. [Wife] is capable of earning between $72,000 and $80,000 a year in the\nChattanooga area.\n\nL. There are positions paying these starting salaries in the Chattanooga area;\nsuch positions have been available for the last few years and would not be\nunder the supervision or control of [Husband.]\n\nM. [Wife] has refused to return to work or seek work during the pendency of\nthis divorce. However, she is aware that there are positions available for her\nto work in the field in which she is trained.\n\n                                    ***\n\nO. Pursuant to the Tennessee Administrative Regulations § 1240-2-4, the\nChild Support Regulations, [Wife] is inferred to have income of $72,000 a\n\n                                     -12-\n\fyear and the Court determines [Husband] has income of $619,000 a year.\n\n                                    ***\n\n      a. Pursuant to § 1240-2-4-.07(g), the maximum child support\n      obligations payable by [Husband] to [Wife] is presently $3,200\n      a month.\n\n      b. [Husband] has already agreed in open Court to continue to\n      pay the children’s private school tuition, books, and fees,\n      (including the expected increases therein thru 12 th grade) and\n      their summer activity fees. These amounts, for 2007, amounted\n      to $25,599.96, which for child support calculation purposes is\n      converted to $2,133.33/month.\n\n             (1) The Court adopts and approves this agreement\n             as a part of his additional child support obligation.\n\n      c. The Final Child Support Order, or FCSO, (Ex. 86, line 16)\n      and the pro-rata monthly cost of private school and summer\n      activities, is $5,333.33 a month[.]\n\n      d. Because the FCSO and the private school and summer\n      activity expenses exceeds the amount of [Husband’s] duty under\n      the Adjusted Support Obligations, or ASO by over $900 a\n      month, [Husband] shall have no other duty of financial support\n      for his children.\n\n      e. Under the present child support laws, [Husband] is not\n      responsible for his children’s education or care beyond the 12 th\n      grade, unless said child were to become an adult disabled child.\n      T.C.A. § 36-5-101.\n\n      f. Further, based on [Husband’s] treatment of children of his\n      first marriage, the Court does not find [Husband] to be a risk of\n      flight or abandonment and therefore, there is no reason to\n      require [Husband] to establish and fund an education trust for\n      his children.\n\n      Thus, the Court finds the testimony of Dr. Bruce Hutchinson of\n\n                                     -13-\n\f       no benefit in determining [Husband’s] future child support\n       obligations.\n\n                                      ***\n\n      Taking into consideration the factors set out in T.C.A. 36-5-101(d) the\nCourt has determined that [Wife] is economically disadvantaged relative to\n[Husband] and should be awarded alimony. The Court finds that even though\nWife has the education and training as an engineer, it is unlikely that she\nwould ever be rehabilitated to an earning capacity approaching that of\n[Husband].\n\n        The parties shared a comfortable living standard that exceeded the\naverage and Husband was still able to put aside large sums of money. Wife\nwas able to go to New York, Atlanta and London for shopping trips. Husband\ntook trips to Iran and sometimes traveled with Wife. Husband purchased, as\ngifts for Wife, expensive jewelry.\n\n       The Court finds both parties contributed to this marriage. [Husband] by\nhis financial contribution. There is no question that his stressful job caused\nhim to spend many hours and often days away from his family and to have a\nstrained, detached relationship with [Wife] when he was home. [Wife]\nwillingly took over almost all of the child care, household upkeep and\nhomemaker duties.\n\n        Need and the ability to pay are the critical factors in setting the amount\nof an alimony award. Smith v. Smith, 912 S.W.2d 155, 159 (Tenn. App. 1995);\nLancaster v. Lancaster, 671 S.W.2d at 503. Isbell v. Isbell, 816 S.W.2d 735,\n[sic] (Tenn. 1991).\n\n       [Wife] filed two expense sheets: one as if she were working with\nexpenses of $17,261 (Ex. 18) and the other based on her providing full time\nchild care with expenses of $14,567 (Ex. 17). She explained the reason for the\ndifference between $11,160 a month in expense statements she filed in May\n2008 was because that expense statement was for her temporary expenses\nwhile the case was pending and [Husband] was paying for health insurance\nand other insurance and expenses that she did not consider.\n\n       She explained the $1600 for mortgage on her Exhibits 17 and 18 was\nto cover insurance and taxes. She hoped she would receive a sufficient amount\n\n                                       -14-\n\fof liquid assets so she could pay a substantial amount of cash for a residence\nand have no mortgage or a very small mortgage. The Court finds these\nexplanations credible.\n\n       [Husband] says the entire family lived on $10,000 a month. However,\nhe spent two years living in Huntsville and now lives in Spring City and\nreceives various reimbursements and benefits from TVA. He testified TVA\npaid for all of his housing expenses when he is living away from Chattanooga\nbecause Chattanooga was his home base.\n\n       Furthermore, based on his representation that his net pay was\n$21,498.97 a month, his net income for 2008 through October was\n$214,989.70. In addition to that, he drew an additional $144,000 (net on his\n$188,000 bonus), a total of $358,989.70 net after taxes and other deductions,\nsuch as health insurance.\n\n       [Husband] started paying spousal support June 1, 2008. In July 2008,\nhe drew $144,000 net on his $188,000 compensation bonus. In the five\nmonths between June 1 and November 5, he had total income of $251,490. He\npaid his wife and for his children, $32,500 (6,500 a month). [Husband] by his\nrepresentations should have had $218,990 disposable income after paying\nspousal and child support.\n\n       The Court finds [Wife’s] testimony about their usual standard of living\nis more credible than [Husband’s]. The Court finds her request for $14,567 is\nreasonable. Since the Court found that [Husband] should pay $3,200 for child\nsupport and the costs of private school tuitions, [Wife’s] need is reduced to\n$5,734. However, [Wife] did not consider the fact that she would have to pay\nincome tax on the amount awarded to her as alimony. Husband will be able\nto deduct the alimony. Considering a minimum of 15% income tax Wife will\nhave to pay, the Court finds that [Wife] needs and [Husband] can afford to pay\n$6,600 a month as transitional spousal support for a period of six years;\nreducing to $4,500 per month for three years and then $2,500 per month as\nperiodic alimony.\n\n       Further, as part of her transition, [Wife] shall be entitled to remain in\nthe house at 619 Grand Mountain Drive up to ninety (90) days following the\npayment to her of the lump sum specified by the Court as her share of the\nmarital property. During this period, [Husband] shall pay the mortgage,\ninsurance and taxes on the home.\n\n                                      -15-\n\f                                             ***\n\n              Wife has requested that the fees she incurred in this divorce be\n       adjudged against [Husband]. The Court finds said request is reasonable and\n       should be granted.\n\n              In adjudging the fees against Husband as additional alimony, the Court\n       has considered the disparity in the earning capacities of the parties; the issues\n       raised by Husband regarding the Islamic marital certificate being a prenuptial\n       agreement, and his alleged premarital assets which no longer existed; and his\n       transfer of assets after service of the statutory injunction. The attorney’s fees\n       and costs resulted from [Wife] being forced to defend against these claims to\n       protect her future and the support and education of their children.\n\n                                             ***\n\n       6. [Husband] shall pay to [Wife] $6,600 a month as transitional spousal\n       support for a period of six years; then, reducing to $4,500 per month for three\n       years and then $2,500 per month as periodic alimony. The payment of\n       transitional spousal support to [Wife] is non-modifiable and shall not terminate\n       on the remarriage of [Wife], but shall terminate on the death of either party.\n       The periodic alimony shall terminate on the death of either party and the\n       remarriage of [Wife], whichever occurs first.\n\n              Husband filed a motion to alter or amend or for a new trial, which the Trial\nCourt granted in part and denied in part finding and holding, inter alia, that if transfer of any\nportion of Husband’s TVA Deferred Compensation Plan results in a taxable event, each party\nwill be responsible for one-half of said taxes. Husband appeals to this Court.\n\n                                          Discussion\n\n               Although not stated exactly as such, Husband raises seven issues on appeal: 1)\nwhether the Trial Court erred in holding that certain of Husband’s pre-marital assets had been\ntransmuted, and that certain of Husband’s pre-marital assets had been co-mingled with\nmarital assets; 2) whether the Trial Court erred in dividing the portion of Husband’s deferred\ncompensation not accessible to Husband until certain contractual dates and conditions have\nbeen met; 3) whether the Trial Court erred in awarding transitional alimony to Wife, and in\nsetting the amount; 4) whether the Trial Court erred in awarding alimony in futuro to Wife,\nand in setting the amount; 5) whether the Trial Court erred in awarding Wife attorney’s fees;\n6) whether the Trial Court erred in finding that Husband had violated the initial statutory\n\n                                              -16-\n\frestraining order; and, 7) whether the Trial Court erred in requiring Husband to pay for\ncertain portions of the transcript Wife wanted included on appeal.\n\n              Wife raises four issues on appeal, which we restate as: 1) whether the Trial\nCourt erred in failing to establish an educational trust for the minor children; 2) whether the\nTrial Court erred in limiting child support to the presumptive amount of $3,200; 3) whether\nthe Trial Court erred in imputing income to Wife of $72,000 a year for purposes of\ncalculating child support; and, 4) whether the Trial Court erred in failing to include\nHusband’s deferred compensation in the child support calculation. Wife also requests an\naward of attorney’s fees on appeal, and requests that this Court take notice of a post-judicial\nfact.\n\n               Our review is de novo upon the record, accompanied by a presumption of\ncorrectness of the findings of fact of the trial court, unless the preponderance of the evidence\nis otherwise. Tenn. R. App. P. 13(d); Bogan v. Bogan, 60 S.W.3d 721, 727 (Tenn. 2001).\nA trial court's conclusions of law are subject to a de novo review with no presumption of\ncorrectness. S. Constructors, Inc. v. Loudon County Bd. of Educ., 58 S.W.3d 706, 710 (Tenn.\n2001).\n\n               We first consider whether the Trial Court erred in holding that certain of\nHusband’s pre-marital assets had been transmuted, and that certain of Husband’s pre-marital\nassets had been co-mingled with marital assets. Our Supreme Court discussed the concepts\nof marital property and separate property in Langschmidt v. Langschmidt and noted that in\naddition to the statutory provisions contained in Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-121(b), Tennessee\nintermediate appellate courts have recognized two methods by which separate property may\nbe converted into marital property. Langschmidt v. Langschmidt, 81 S.W.3d 741, 747 (Tenn.\n2002). These two methods are commingling and transmutation, which the Supreme Court\nnoted have been described by this Court as follows:\n\n              [S]eparate property becomes marital property [by commingling]\n              if inextricably mingled with marital property or with the separate\n              property of the other spouse. If the separate property continues\n              to be segregated or can be traced into its product, commingling\n              does not occur.... [Transmutation] occurs when separate\n              property is treated in such a way as to give evidence of an\n              intention that it become marital property.... The rationale\n              underlying these doctrines is that dealing with property in these\n              ways creates a rebuttable presumption of a gift to the marital\n              estate. This presumption is based also upon the provision in\n              many marital property statutes that property acquired during the\n\n                                              -17-\n\f              marriage is presumed to be marital. The presumption can be\n              rebutted by evidence of circumstances or communications\n              clearly indicating an intent that the property remain separate.\n\nLangschmidt, 81 S.W.3d at 747 (citations omitted).\n\n                Husband argues on appeal about two specific items that he claims should have\nbeen classified as his pre-marital property. First, Husband claims that he had accumulated\napproximately $214,000 in CDs and other accounts prior to the marriage and that this money\nshould have been classified as his separate property. The evidence in the record on appeal\nshows that Husband put Wife’s name on these accounts during the marriage. Husband\nasserts that he put Wife’s name on the accounts because Wife pressured him to do so, but that\nhe never intended to gift that money to Wife or to the marriage.\n\n               The Trial Court found that these pre-marital funds had been transmuted when\nHusband put Wife’s name on the accounts. The evidence does not preponderate against this\nfinding. Husband failed to rebut the presumption that by putting Wife’s name on the\naccounts he was making a gift to the marital estate. We find no error in the Trial Court’s\nclassification that this property, which had been Husband’s pre-marital separate property,\nwas transmuted into marital property.\n\n                Second, Husband argues on appeal that the Trial Court erred in classifying all\nof the funds in Husband’s deferred compensation plan as marital when Husband asserts that\napproximately $250,000 of those funds constituted pre-marital property. With regard to this\nissue, the Trial Court specifically found that: “Having withdrawn from his deferred\ncompensation plan more money than [Husband] had in the fund when the parties married,\nthe Court finds that there is no longer any separate money in his deferred compensation\nplan.” The Trial Court found that during the marriage, Husband had paid alimony and child\nsupport to his previous family, had given money to his sister and his parents, and had\nwrongfully withdrawn $1.5 million after fraudulently claiming a hardship thereby incurring\ntax liability and dissipating the marital estate.\n\n              The evidence does not preponderate against these findings made by the Trial\nCourt. We find no error in the Trial Court’s holding that there no longer existed any pre-\nmarital funds in Husband’s deferred compensation account.\n\n             We next consider whether the Trial Court erred in dividing the portion of\nHusband’s deferred compensation not accessible to Husband until certain contractual dates\nand conditions have been met. In its order the Trial Court held that Husband:\n\n\n\n                                             -18-\n\f       shall execute such documents as are necessary and required by Tennessee\n       Valley Authority and Tennessee Valley Authority Retirement Systems and/or\n       the Plan Administrators of any of [Husband’s] retirement and deferred\n       compensation plans to transfer to [Wife] fifty percent of the amount in the\n       deferred compensation and that part of the pension, 401 (k) and the TVA\n       Retirement Annuity earned and/or contributed from July 20, 2000 to the date\n       of the divorce, together with the gains and losses, if any, to the date of\n       distribution to [Wife].\n\nUnder the Trial Court’s order, Wife will get fifty percent of the amount in Husband’s\ndeferred compensation plan which the Trial Court found to have a value as of the time of trial\nof $2,730,141. The evidence does not preponderate against this finding as to the value of\nHusband’s deferred compensation plan.\n\n               It is not the role of this Court to tweak a trial court’s distribution of property.\nRather, we must look to determine if the overall property distribution is equitable. King v.\nKing, 986 S.W.2d 216, 219 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1998). Husband, as is often the case in appeals\nto this Court concerning a division of marital property, wishes to focus on whether the\ndivision as to particular assets was equitable rather than whether the overall property\ndistribution was equitable. We decline to tweak the property division as the evidence does\nnot preponderate against this being an overall equitable marital property distribution. The\nevidence in the record before us does not preponderate against either the Trial Court’s\nclassification or valuation of the marital property. Likewise, the evidence does not\npreponderate against the Trial Court’s property division being an equitable division. This\nissue is without merit.\n\n               Next, we consider whether the Trial Court erred in awarding transitional\nalimony to Wife, and in setting the amount. Trial courts have broad discretion to determine\nwhether alimony is needed and, if so, the nature, amount, and duration of support. Garfinkel\nv. Garfinkel, 945 S.W.2d 744, 748 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1996). Pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. §\n36-5-121(i), the court is to consider the following factors in determining alimony:\n\n              (1) The relative earning capacity, obligations, needs, and financial\n       resources of each party, including income from pension, profit sharing or\n       retirement plans and all other sources;\n\n               (2) The relative education and training of each party, the ability and\n       opportunity of each party to secure such education and training, and the\n       necessity of a party to secure further education and training to improve such\n       party's earnings capacity to a reasonable level;\n\n                                              -19-\n\f              (3) The duration of the marriage;\n\n              (4) The age and mental condition of each party;\n\n             (5) The physical condition of each party, including, but not limited to,\n       physical disability or incapacity due to a chronic debilitating disease;\n\n              (6) The extent to which it would be undesirable for a party to seek\n       employment outside the home, because such party will be custodian of a minor\n       child of the marriage;\n\n              (7) The separate assets of each party, both real and personal, tangible\n       and intangible;\n\n              (8) The provisions made with regard to the marital property, as defined\n       in § 36-4-121;\n\n              (9) The standard of living of the parties established during the marriage;\n\n              (10) The extent to which each party has made such tangible and\n       intangible contributions to the marriage as monetary and homemaker\n       contributions, and tangible and intangible contributions by a party to the\n       education, training or increased earning power of the other party;\n\n              (11) The relative fault of the parties, in cases where the court, in its\n       discretion, deems it appropriate to do so; and\n\n              (12) Such other factors, including the tax consequences to each party,\n       as are necessary to consider the equities between the parties.\n\nTenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(i) (2005).\n\n               “There are no hard and fast rules for spousal support decisions.” Anderton v.\nAnderton, 988 S.W.2d 675, 682 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1998). Decisions regarding alimony require\na careful balancing of the factors in Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(i) and typically hinge on\nthe unique facts and circumstances of the case. Anderton, 988 S.W.2d at 683. While all of\nthe statutory factors are significant, the two most important factors are the obligor spouse’s\nability to pay and the need of the disadvantaged spouse. Aaron v. Aaron, 909 S.W.2d 408,\n410 (Tenn. 1995).\n\n\n\n                                             -20-\n\f              In pertinent part, Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(g) provides:\n\n       (g)(1) Transitional alimony means a sum of money payable by one (1) party to,\n       or on behalf of, the other party for a determinate period of time. Transitional\n       alimony is awarded when the court finds that rehabilitation is not necessary,\n       but the economically disadvantaged spouse needs assistance to adjust to the\n       economic consequences of a divorce, legal separation or other proceeding\n       where spousal support may be awarded, such as a petition for an order of\n       protection.\n\nTenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(g)(1) (2005).\n\n                As pertinent to this issue, the Trial Court found “[Wife] needs and [Husband]\ncan afford to pay $6,600 a month as transitional spousal support for a period of six years;\nreducing to $4,500 per month for three years ….” We agree with the Trial Court that the\nevidence shows that Wife is not in need of rehabilitation. Wife is a licensed civil engineer\nwho holds a baccalaureate degree. She has worked in the past at her chosen career. The\nevidence in the record on appeal further shows that Wife quit working outside the home\nwhen she gave birth to the parties’ first child, and that Wife has worked as a homemaker and\nstay-at-home mother since that time. Thus, Wife had been out of the workforce, as of the\ntime of trial, for seven years. The evidence does not preponderate against the Trial Court’s\nfinding that Wife is economically disadvantaged and in need of assistance to adjust to the\neconomic consequences of divorce.\n\n             The Trial Court awarded Wife transitional alimony for nine years in this eight\nyear marriage. Wife and Husband were married for only seven years when Wife filed for\ndivorce.\n\n              The evidence preponderates against the Trial Court’s finding that Wife needs\nlonger to adjust to the economic consequences of the divorce than the parties were married\nand for longer than Wife did not work in her chosen profession. Given the facts and\ncircumstances in this case, including Wife’s professional training and the significant assets\nshe received in the property division, the award of transitional alimony for nine years for\nwhat was only an eight year marriage is inappropriate.\n\n              Given the facts and circumstances of this case as discussed, we find that an\naward of transitional alimony in the amount of $6,600 a month for six years is appropriate\nto allow Wife to adjust to the economic consequences of the divorce. We, therefore, modify\nthe award of transitional alimony to be in the amount of $6,600 per month lasting only six\nyears.\n\n                                            -21-\n\f               We next consider whether the Trial Court erred in awarding alimony in futuro\nto Wife, and in calculating the amount. As pertinent to this issue, Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-\n121(f)(1) states:\n\n               (f)(1) Alimony in futuro, also known as periodic alimony, is a payment\n       of support and maintenance on a long term basis or until death or remarriage\n       of the recipient. Such alimony may be awarded when the court finds that there\n       is relative economic disadvantage and that rehabilitation is not feasible,\n       meaning that the disadvantaged spouse is unable to achieve, with reasonable\n       effort, an earning capacity that will permit the spouse's standard of living after\n       the divorce to be reasonably comparable to the standard of living enjoyed\n       during the marriage, or to the post-divorce standard of living expected to be\n       available to the other spouse, considering the relevant statutory factors and the\n       equities between the parties.\n\nTenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(f)(1) (2005).\n\n              The Trial Court specifically found that:\n\n       H. [Wife] is a licensed civil engineer with a baccalaureate degree.\n\n       I. [Wife] speaks three languages, has no physical or mental limitations, and is\n       capable of working.\n\n       J. [Wife’s] last salary was $44,000 a year in 2001 for Alstom Power.\n\n              1. This was her first job as a civil engineer after obtaining her\n              degree.\n\n              2. [Wife] worked for approximately 7 months, until near the\n              birth of the parties’ first child.\n\n              3. In 2001, [Wife] retained all of her earnings, $24,286.47\n              rather than contributing them to the family income; she used her\n              earnings to pay her pre-marital debt for her college education\n              with the agreement of [Husband].\n\n       K. [Wife] is capable of earning between $72,000 and $80,000 a year in the\n       Chattanooga area.\n\n\n\n                                             -22-\n\f       L. There are positions paying these starting salaries in the Chattanooga area;\n       such positions have been available for the last few years and would not be\n       under the supervision or control of [Husband.]\n\n       M. [Wife] has refused to return to work or seek work during the pendency of\n       this divorce. However, she is aware that there are positions available for her\n       to work in the field in which she is trained.\n\nThe Trial Court also found that “even though Wife has the education and training as an\nengineer, it is unlikely that she would ever be rehabilitated to an earning capacity\napproaching that of [Husband].”\n\n               We respectfully disagree. The record reveals that Wife was forty-one years old\nat the time of trial, speaks three languages, and has no physical or mental limitations which\nwould prevent her from working. She holds the same baccalaureate degree as does Husband\nand is a licensed civil engineer. Wife was able in the past to obtain a job working in her\nchosen field. The evidence further shows that there are job openings within Wife’s chosen\nfield in the community where Wife lives. Wife received almost $2.6 million in assets from\nthe distribution of marital property plus one-half of Husband’s TVA pension earned during\nthe eight year marriage and received no debt.\n\n              This was a relatively short-term marriage lasting only eight years. While the\nTrial Court noted that the parties enjoyed “a comfortable living standard that exceeded the\naverage …,” the record also reveals that during the first five years of the eight years the\nparties were married, Husband’s income was significantly less than it was during the final\nyears of the marriage. It is pure speculation to say that it is unlikely that Wife could reach\nan earning capacity approaching that of Husband given Wife’s age, education, and\nqualifications. Wife is younger than Husband and Wife has almost the same educational\nbackground as Husband does. Wife has no acceptable reason for not working in her chosen\nprofession. The record is devoid of evidence showing that Wife is unable to obtain a job, or\nincapable of working. Another important factor relevant to the issue of Wife’s need is that\nshe received almost $2.6 million of the marital property from this marriage of only eight\nyears.\n\n               The evidence preponderates against a finding that Wife has a need for alimony\nin futuro extending beyond the six years of transitional alimony. After considering all of the\nrelevant factors, we conclude that the award of alimony in futuro was inappropriate in this\ncase. We, therefore, vacate the award of alimony in futuro.\n\n              Next, we consider whether the Trial Court erred in calculating the award of\n\n                                             -23-\n\fattorney’s fees. An award of alimony in solido for payment of attorney fees likewise should\nbe based on the factors set forth in Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(i), and is appropriate when\nthe spouse seeking attorney fees does not have adequate funds to pay his or her legal\nexpenses. Yount v. Yount, 91 S.W.3d 777, 783 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2002). Conversely, a spouse\nwith sufficient property or income to pay his or her attorney fees is not entitled to be\ncompensated. Koja v. Koja, 42 S.W.3d 94, 98 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2000).\n\n               Wife received almost $2.6 million in assets in the divorce plus one-half of\nHusband’s TVA pension earned during the marriage and no debt. She has adequate funds\nto pay her own legal expenses. We note, however, that during argument before the Trial\nCourt on the post-trial motions, Husband’s attorney admitted that Husband did not object to\nthe request for attorney’s fees with regard to Husband’s argument that the Islamic marriage\ncertificate constituted a prenuptial agreement under Islamic law. Husband’s attorney stated:\n“We failed in that. We deserve to be hit with [the attorney’s fees relative to this issue], for\nlack of a better phrase, I hate to use the word deserve, but the bottom line is, that’s how it\nworks.” Given this admission, we find that Husband shall be responsible for paying Wife’s\nattorney’s fees with regard to this particular issue.\n\n               Rather than remand for a determination of the cost of fees specific to this\nparticular argument, which would result in the parties expending even more money on\nattorney’s fees, we find that the $10,000 that Husband already has paid toward Wife’s\nattorney’s fees covers these fees. Wife is responsible for the remainder of her legal expenses.\nWe, therefore, modify the Trial Court’s award of attorney’s fees to Wife to reflect that\nHusband is responsible only for the $10,000, which Husband already has paid, and that Wife\nis responsible for the remainder of her legal expenses.\n\n                We next consider whether the Trial Court erred in finding that Husband had\nviolated the initial statutory restraining order. The Trial Court found that Husband made two\ntransfers of money “after [Husband] knew or should have known that he was enjoined from\nwithdrawing these funds from the joint CD account.” The evidence does not preponderate\nagainst this finding. We note that the Trial Court did not “punish” Husband in any way for\nthis violation. We find no error in the Trial Court’s finding that Husband had violated the\ninitial statutory restraining order.\n\n              We next consider whether the Trial Court erred in requiring Husband to pay\nfor certain portions of the transcript Wife wanted included on appeal. After filing this\nappeal, Husband designated portions of the record to be included on appeal. Wife then\ndesignated additional portions of the record she wanted included on appeal. Husband filed\na motion seeking an order requiring Wife to pay for the additional portions of the record\nwhich she had designated. The Trial Court held a hearing and then entered its order finding\n\n                                             -24-\n\fand holding, inter alia, that Husband’s motion seeking to have Wife pay for the disputed\nportions of the record was not well taken.\n\n             In Scandlyn v. Scandlyn, this Court stated:\n\n             The trial court has wide latitude in the steps taken to assure that a “fair,\n      accurate and complete account of what transpired” is transmitted to the\n      appellate court. Rule 24(b), T.R.A.P., provides that if additional parts of the\n      record are designated by the appellee, the appellant shall “either have the\n      additional parts prepared at his own expense or apply to the trial court for an\n      order requiring the appellee to do so.” The action upon the application is, of\n      course, within the discretion of the trial court.\n\nScandlyn v. Scandlyn, No. 1043, 1986 Tenn. App. LEXIS 3138, at *11 (Tenn. Ct. App. July\n18, 1986), Rule 11 appl. perm. appeal denied Nov. 3, 1986. As this Court has explained:\n\n      Our Supreme Court discussed the abuse of discretion standard in Eldridge v.\n      Eldridge, stating:\n\n                     Under the abuse of discretion standard, a trial court’s\n             ruling “will be upheld so long as reasonable minds can disagree\n             as to [the] propriety of the decision made.” A trial court abuses\n             its discretion only when it “applie[s] an incorrect legal standard,\n             or reache[s] a decision which is against logic or reasoning that\n             cause[s] an injustice to the party complaining.” The abuse of\n             discretion standard does not permit the appellate court to\n             substitute its judgment for that of the trial court.\n\n      Eldridge v. Eldridge, 42 S.W.3d 82, 85 (Tenn. 2001) (citations omitted).\n\n              Appellate courts ordinarily permit discretionary decisions to stand when\n      reasonable judicial minds can differ concerning their soundness. Overstreet\n      v. Shoney’s, Inc., 4 S.W.3d 694, 709 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1999). A trial court’s\n      discretionary decision must take into account applicable law and be consistent\n      with the facts before the court. Id. When reviewing a discretionary decision\n      by the trial court, the “appellate courts should begin with the presumption that\n      the decision is correct and should review the evidence in the light most\n      favorable to the decision.” Id.\n\nDelapp v. Pratt, 152 S.W.3d 530, 538 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2004).\n\n                                             -25-\n\f                Reasonable judicial minds, at a minimum, could disagree as to the propriety\nof the Trial Court’s decision to order Husband to pay for the disputed portions of the\ntranscript, the very essence of a discretionary decision. We will not substitute our judgment\nfor that of the Trial Court. We, therefore, find no error with regard to this issue.\n\n               Turning to Wife’s issues, we next consider whether the Trial Court erred in\nfailing to establish an educational trust for the minor children. With regard to this issue, the\nTrial Court found and held:\n\n       a. Pursuant to § 1240-2-4-.07(g), the maximum child support obligations\n       payable by [Husband] to [Wife] is presently $3,200 a month.\n\n       b. [Husband] has already agreed in open Court to continue to pay the\n       children’s private school tuition, books, and fees, (including the expected\n       increases therein thru 12th grade) and their summer activity fees. These\n       amounts, for 2007, amounted to $25,599.96, which for child support\n       calculation purposes is converted to $2,133.33/month.\n\n              (1) The Court adopts and approves this agreement as a part of\n              his additional child support obligation.\n\n       c. The Final Child Support Order, or FCSO, (Ex. 86, line 16) and the pro-rata\n       monthly cost of private school and summer activities, is $5,333.33 a month[.]\n\n       d. Because the FCSO and the private school and summer activity expenses\n       exceeds the amount of [Husband’s] duty under the Adjusted Support\n       Obligations, or ASO by over $900 a month, [Husband] shall have no other\n       duty of financial support for his children.\n\n       e. Under the present child support laws, [Husband] is not responsible for his\n       children’s education or care beyond the 12th grade, unless said child were to\n       become an adult disabled child. T.C.A. § 36-5-101.\n\n       f. Further, based on [Husband’s] treatment of children of his first marriage, the\n       Court does not find [Husband] to be a risk of flight or abandonment and\n       therefore, there is no reason to require [Husband] to establish and fund an\n       education trust for his children.\n\nThe evidence does not preponderate against these findings made by the Trial Court.\n\n\n\n                                              -26-\n\f               The Child Support Guidelines provide that a parent “seeking support in excess\nof the amount provided by the applicable percentage must prove by a preponderance of the\nevidence that more than this amount is reasonably necessary to provide for the needs of the\nchild.” Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 1240-2-4-.07(g)(1). If that parent proves the need for\nsupport in excess of the presumptive amount the court shall add an appropriate amount as a\ndeviation and “may require that sums paid pursuant to this subparagraph be placed in an\neducational or other trust fund for the benefit of the child.” Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 1240-2-\n4-.07(g)(2)(iii)1 .\n\n               Thus, it was within the Trial Court’s discretion to order an educational trust for\nthe benefit of the children if Wife first proved by a preponderance of the evidence that child\nsupport in an amount greater than the presumptive amount was reasonably necessary to\nprovide for the needs of the children. Wife failed to make this showing. As such, we find\nno abuse of discretion by the Trial Court and thus no error in the Trial Court’s refusal to\norder an educational trust.\n\n               We next consider whether the Trial Court erred in limiting child support to the\npresumptive amount. In her brief on appeal Wife argues: “If the alimony is reduced, then the\nchild support should be increased proportionately in accordance with the guideline\nregulations.” Wife fails to acknowledge that alimony and child support are two separate and\ndistinct issues. Furthermore, Wife also has failed to recognize that the Trial Court did award\nmore than the presumptive amount in child support when it first awarded the maximum\namount of child support under the guidelines, and then additionally approved Husband’s\nagreement to continue to pay private school tuition, books, fees, and summer activities, and\nawarded the amounts for these in addition to the maximum presumptive amount. In addition,\nwe note that in support of her argument Wife relies upon the testimony of Dr. Bruce\nHutchinson despite the fact that the Trial Court very clearly and specifically stated: “the\nCourt finds the testimony of Dr. Bruce Hutchinson of no benefit in determining [Husband’s]\nfuture child support obligations.” We find no error in the Trial Court’s award of child\nsupport.\n\n             Next, we consider whether the Trial Court erred in imputing income to Wife\nof $72,000 per year for the purposes of computing child support. As this Court explained in\nRichardson v. Spanos:\n\n\n\n        1\n         In her brief on appeal Wife quotes from the Child Support Guidelines in effect in the early 1990s\nand cites to case law from that same time period applying that specific section. The Child Support\nGuidelines have changed significantly since that time. We quote from and apply, as did the Trial Court, the\nChild Support Guidelines applicable at the time of the divorce in the instant case.\n\n                                                   -27-\n\f             Prior to the adoption of the Child Support Guidelines, trial courts had\n      wide discretion in matters relating to child custody and support. Hopkins v.\n      Hopkins, 152 S.W.3d 447, 452 (Tenn. 2004) (Barker, J., dissenting). Their\n      discretion was guided only by broad equitable principles and rules which took\n      into consideration the condition and means of each parent. Brooks v. Brooks,\n      166 Tenn. 255, 257, 61 S.W.2d 654, 654 (1933). However, the adoption of the\n      Child Support Guidelines has limited the court’s discretion substantially, and\n      decisions regarding child support must be made within the strictures of the\n      Child Support Guidelines. Berryhill v. Rhodes, 21 S.W.3d 188, 193 (Tenn.\n      2000); Jones v. Jones, 930 S.W.2d 541, 545 (Tenn. 1996); Smith v. Smith, 165\n      S.W.3d 279, 282 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2004).\n\n                                            ***\n\n              Because child support decisions retain an element of discretion, we\n      review them using the deferential “abuse of discretion” standard. This\n      standard is a review-constraining standard of review that calls for less intense\n      appellate review and, therefore, less likelihood that the trial court’s decision\n      will be reversed. State ex rel Jones v. Looper, 86 S.W.3d 189, 193 (Tenn. Ct.\n      App. 2000); White v. Vanderbilt Univ., 21 S.W.3d 215, 222-23 (Tenn. Ct. App.\n      1999). Appellate courts do not have the latitude to substitute their discretion\n      for that of the trial court. Henry v. Goins, 104 S.W.3d 475, 479 (Tenn. 2003);\n      State ex rel. Vaughn v. Kaatrude, 21 S.W.3d 244, 248 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2000).\n      Thus, a trial court’s discretionary decision will be upheld as long as it is not\n      clearly unreasonable, Bogan v. Bogan, 60 S.W.3d 721, 733 (Tenn. 2001), and\n      reasonable minds can disagree about its correctness. Eldridge v. Eldridge, 42\n      S.W.3d 82, 85 (Tenn. 2001); State v. Scott, 33 S.W.3d 746, 752 (Tenn. 2000).\n      Discretionary decisions must, however, take the applicable law and the\n      relevant facts into account. Ballard v. Herzke, 924 S.W.2d 652, 661 (Tenn.\n      1996). Accordingly, a trial court will be found to have “abused its discretion”\n      when it applies an incorrect legal standard, reaches a decision that is illogical,\n      bases its decision on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence, or\n      employs reasoning that causes an injustice to the complaining party. Perry v.\n      Perry, 114 S.W.3d 465, 467 (Tenn. 2003); Clinard v. Blackwood, 46 S.W.3d\n      177, 182 (Tenn. 2001); Overstreet v. Shoney’s, Inc., 4 S.W.3d 694, 709 (Tenn.\n      Ct. App. 1999).\n\nRichardson v. Spanos, 189 S.W.3d 720, 725 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005).\n\n             The Child Support Guidelines provide that imputing income to a parent when\n\n                                             -28-\n\fcalculating child support is appropriate: “If a parent has been determined by a tribunal to be\nwillfully and/or voluntarily underemployed or unemployed ….” Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs.\n1240-2-4-.04(3)(a)(2)(i)(I). When making a determination of willful or voluntary\nunemployment or underemployment, a trial court may consider:\n\n       (I) The parent’s past and present employment;\n\n       (II) The parent’s education, training, and ability to work;\n\n       (III) The State of Tennessee recognizes the role of a stay-at-home parent as an\n       important and valuable factor in a child’s life. In considering whether there\n       should be any imputation of income to a stay-at-home parent, the tribunal shall\n       consider:\n\n              I. Whether the parent acted in the role of full-time caretaker\n              while the parents were living in the same household;\n\n              II. The length of time the parent staying at home has remained\n              out of the workforce for this purpose; and\n\n              III. The age of the minor children.\n\nTenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 1240-2-4-.04(3)(a)(2)(iii).\n\nThe Trial Court clearly considered all of the relevant factors and determined that it was\nproper to impute income to Wife for purposes of calculating child support. The evidence in\nthe record on appeal does not preponderate against this finding.\n\n              Wife also argues that the Trial Court erred in imputing the amount of $72,000.\nThe record reveals that Husband testified that there are companies in the community where\nWife lives paying people with Wife’s experience and level of education between $70,000 and\n$80,000. The record on appeal is devoid of evidence to the contrary.\n\n               Wife argues that this Court should not accept Husband’s testimony with regard\nto this issue as the Trial Court found Husband to be not credible. Wife is mistaken. The\nTrial Court found Wife to be more credible with regard to other issues, but clearly found\nHusband to be credible with regard to this issue. The Trial Court specifically found that\n“[Wife] is capable of earning between $72,000 and $80,000 a year in the Chattanooga area”\nand that “[t]here are positions paying these starting salaries in the Chattanooga area; such\npositions have been available for the last few years and would not be under the supervision\n\n                                             -29-\n\for control of [Husband].”\n\n             The evidence in the record on appeal does not preponderate against these\nfindings. Given this, we find no error in the Trial Court’s imputing income to Wife of\n$72,000 per year for the purposes of computing child support.\n\n              We next consider whether the Trial Court erred in not including money from\nthe deferred compensation plan in Husband’s income for purposes of calculating child\nsupport. To begin, we again note that Wife’s argument relies upon the testimony of Dr.\nBruce Hutchinson, which the Trial Court clearly and specifically found to be “of no benefit\nin determining [Husband’s] future child support obligations.” In addition, the Trial Court\nawarded the maximum presumptive amount, and Wife failed to prove by a preponderance\nof the evidence that more than this amount was reasonably necessary to provide for the needs\nof the children, as discussed fully above. As such, even if the Trial Court erred in not\nconsidering the funds in the deferred compensation plan when calculating child support, and\nwe make no finding regarding whether this was or was not error, any such alleged error was\nharmless. This issue is without merit.\n\n               Wife requests this Court to take notice of the post-judicial fact that Regions\nBank paid Wife $885,860, and paid Husband the remainder of funds in the account,\n$217,621.43. In its findings of fact and conclusions of law contained in its April 16, 2009\norder, the Trial Court valued the Regions Bank CD at $1,050,000. However, in Exhibit 1,\nincorporated into the Trial Court’s order by reference, the Trial Court valued the Regions\nBank CD at $1,085,000. Exhibit 2, incorporated into the order by reference, shows that the\nTrial Court distributed the Regions Bank CD by awarding $885,860 to Wife and $229,450\nto Husband. When added together, the award of $885,860 to Wife and the award of\n$229,450 to Husband total $1,115,310.\n\n              Clearly, the amount of money in the Regions Bank CD both at the time the\nTrial Court valued it and at the time of distribution was different from the values stated in\nthe Trial Court’s order. The end result as to that asset is that while Wife received the full\n$885,860 specifically awarded to her, Husband received less than the $229,450 awarded to\nhim. We are puzzled as to why Wife, rather than Husband, requests we take notice of this\nfact, and Wife has not shown how this fact would be relevant to the issues raised on appeal.\nIn the exercise of our discretion we deny Wife’s motion.\n\n               Finally, each party has more than sufficient assets to pay his or her own\nattorney. In the exercise of our discretion, we decline to award attorney’s fees on appeal to\neither party.\n\n\n\n                                            -30-\n\f                                       Conclusion\n\n              The portion of the judgment of the Trial Court awarding alimony in futuro is\nvacated. The portion of the judgment awarding transitional alimony and attorney’s fees is\nmodified such that Husband shall pay Wife $6,600 per month as transitional alimony for six\nyears, and Husband shall be responsible only for the $10,000 in Wife’s attorney’s fees which\nHusband already has paid. The remainder of the Trial Court’s judgment is affirmed, and this\ncause is remanded to the Trial Court for collection of the costs below. The costs on appeal\nare assessed one-half against the appellant, Masoud Bajestani, and his surety, and one-half\nagainst the appellee, Maryam Ghorashi-Bajastani.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   _________________________________\n                                                   D.

Two minor\nchildren were born of the marriage. Husband has adult children from a previous marriage.\nIn February of 2008, Wife sued Husband for divorce.\n\n              Wife testified at trial that she was born on March 23, 1968 in Iran. Wife has\ndual citizenship in the United States and Iran. Wife holds an engineering degree that she\nobtained in Florida. Wife stated: “That was my dream always to move to United States and\nbecome an engineer. I couldn’t compete or pass the exams in Iran as a female in that field.”\nWife speaks Persian, English, and German, and stated that she did not think anyone had a\nhard time understanding her. Wife admitted she is in good health and has no physical\nproblems.\n\n              Wife stopped working outside the home in July of 2001 when she gave birth\nto the parties’ first child. Wife’s last job outside the home was at Alstom Power in\nChattanooga where she worked as a mechanical engineer and earned $43,000 per year. Wife\nworked at Alstom Power for seven or eight months. When the parties married, Wife had a\nstudent loan of $21,000. Wife paid off this loan with money she earned while working at\nAlstom Power during the marriage. The parties’ second child was born in August of 2003.\n\n              When asked if she planned to return to working outside the home, Wife stated:\n\n       I feel that I have a job, that is taking care of my kids, already. This is the most\n       important job I’ve ever had, and my kids are very small. And if I want to go\n       back to work force, I need some special education, I need refresh courses and\n       I need to get back to that standard that - - to apply for a job. It’s been eight\n       years I haven’t worked. There’s so many things I’ve forgotten.\n\n               But the most important thing that I don’t want to forget is that my kids\n       are most important and the money that I might be able to make outside - - and\n       my kids don’t have an uncle, cousin, grandparents, so I really think that I need\n       to stay with my kids.\n\n            Wife testified that her expenses per month were $14,567. Wife also calculated\nwhat her expenses would be if she obtained a job outside the home making $43,000 to\n\n                                               -2-\n\f$45,000 per year. She testified that if she obtained such a job, her expenses would be\n$17,000 per month due to:\n\n       Additional expenses, the cost of the clothing, car maintenance, laundry, all\n       those things that - - the kids will have to stay at school longer hours, it’s going\n       to add to that, their food, the grocery, the lunch outside, all of these, the gas,\n       is going to add up.\n\nWhen asked if there would be a benefit to her obtaining a job outside the home, Wife stated:\n“No, not at all. Actually, it’s better if I don’t let a stranger raise my kids rather than me stay\nhome and be with my kids.” When asked if she was aware of jobs in the community that pay\nbetween $70,000 and $80,000 that she could apply for, Wife stated: “My kids need me\nmore.” Wife admitted that the school her children attend has an after-school program that\nruns until 6 p.m., which her children could attend. She also admitted that there is a pre-care\nprogram at the school, and the children could be delivered to the school before 8 a.m.\n\n              Wife testified that during the marriage, the family would take two or three trips\nper year and further stated: “we have an overseas, once-a-year overseas trip with the kids,\nand the other trips would be to New York City visiting relatives, Virginia.” When asked\nwhere she shops for herself and the children, Wife stated: “We go to New York to shop or\nAtlanta, or on our trips, if we went to London, we do those kind of shopping, going around\non tours, we went to Alaska.” Since filing for divorce, Wife has traveled to New York,\nAlaska, and Washington, D.C.\n\n               Husband was 53 years old at the time of trial. He testified that he is an Iranian\ncitizen, and that he also has been a United States citizen since 1982. Husband has lived in\nthe United States since 1975. Husband has three grown children from a previous marriage.\nHusband owns the home the parties lived in during the marriage and testified that he was\nawarded this home in his prior divorce. The parties are debt-free except for the mortgage on\nthe home.\n\n               Husband works for TVA. Husband described his job stating: “I’m the vice\npresident for Watts Bar Unit 2 project. It’s a new nuclear plant that’s being built and this is\ngoing to be the first new plant after 20 years that is going to come online in the United\nStates.” Husband holds a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering and a master’s degree.\nHusband signed a contract for his current job in October of 2007. He stated: “The contract\nis for five years and one year after the plant comes online. So it’s for a total of six years.\nThe contract that is written, it actually says that when the plant comes online and runs for\nsome period of time reliably and safely, then there are some incentives. So if you add\neverything, it’s a six-year contract, essentially.” Per the contract, Husband had four years left\n\n                                               -3-\n\fto complete the job as of the time of trial. Husband has no future contracts.\n\n             In 2005 Husband moved to Huntsville, Alabama for his job. Wife and the\nchildren remained in Tennessee. When asked why she remained in Tennessee, Wife stated:\n\n       Because the kids were going already to school here. They had already started\n       to school. They were in the middle of the year, of their school year. And\n       [Husband] told me that project is going to be done, finished earlier than two\n       years. He’s trying to push the process to be done in earlier than two years.\n\nWhen questioned further, Wife admitted that at that time the parties’ older child was\nattending pre-school, and the younger child was only three years old. Husband testified that\nbecause he was “assigned to a city outside my central station…,” TVA provided Husband\nwith housing and paid his expenses during the time he worked in Alabama. Husband lived\nin Huntsville, Alabama for eighteen or nineteen months and saw Wife and children on\nweekends.\n\n               At trial, Husband stated: “I’m willing to pay for my children’s education,\nprivate school, and other expenses that comes with other education like piano lesson, other\nthan just tuition for the school.” He further stated that he anticipates helping his children\nwith college.\n\n                The parties were married in 2000 and that year Husband had taxable income\nof approx $300,000. In 2001, Husband had taxable income of approximately $236,000.\nWife’s W2 form for 2001 shows wages of approximately $24,000 for the approximately\nseven months that she worked outside the home during that year. In 2002, Husband’s income\nwas approximately $115,000. Husband’s income for 2003 was approximately $155,000. In\n2004, Husband had income of approximately $119,00. Husband’s income for 2005 was\napproximately $300,000. In 2006, Husband had income of approximately $594,00. Husband\ntestified that his base salary in 2006 was approximately $240,000, and that the remaining\namount consisted of bonuses. Husband’s wages including bonuses for 2007 were\napproximately $599,000. However, in 2007 Husband declared approximately $2,293,000\nin taxable income because Husband withdrew $1.5 million out of his TVA deferred\ncompensation account in 2007.\n\n                Husband has a contract for deferred compensation for Watts Bar Unit 2. He\nstated: “Deferred compensation, this is a contract that was put in place, essentially what they\ncall it is the golden handcuff, to essentially to get you to stay for the duration of the whole\nproject. But you have to meet certain requirements to be able to get the money that’s in this\ncontract.… Specifically, budget, schedule, that if you miss - - and the safe and reliable\n\n                                              -4-\n\foperation of the unit after it comes online. And if you miss any of this, essentially, you won’t\nget this deferred compensation.”\n\n               Husband testified: “That bonus is based on performance of the project,\nperformance of the certain milestones that you are to meet, budget, schedule and TVA’s\noverall performance.” Husband testified that for 2008, “TVA overall performance has not\nbeen good because of various issues that we have had this year, drought. The performance\nof the fossil units and nuclear units hasn’t been good, so we missed a lot of milestones.”\n\n             With regard to the $1.5 withdrawal from his deferred compensation account,\nHusband stated:\n\n       The reason I withdrew that money was because this money, the deferred\n       compensation money is actually in the market, you know, invested in the\n       market. So I looked at the market and the market wasn’t going to go\n       anywhere; actually it was losing its value, the dollar was losing its value, and\n       I had this opportunity that I discussed with [Wife] to invest some money\n       outside the U.S. and specifically buy some property back in Tehran, Iran. So\n       I decided to withdraw that money and invest it outside the U.S.\n\nHusband stated that he and Wife were planning on sending a little over $1 million for this\npurpose and that to date he has sent $600,000. Husband testified that the money he sent to\nIran has not been invested in anything because he did not fulfill his commitment to send the\nfull amount. Husband claims he can get the money back with some loss of percentage due\nto conversion. He testified that the money is not in a bank, but instead is in his brother-in-\nlaw’s possession.\n\n              Husband withdrew the $1.5 million by claiming financial hardship and an\nimmediate and heavy need for housing. At trial, Husband admitted that he did not have a\nfinancial hardship at the time he made the withdrawal. He further admitted that he was not\ntaking the money for housing but for an investment. Husband had to pay taxes on the\nwithdrawal such that the net amount that Husband received was $975,000.\n\n               Husband sent the money “to a bank in Canada and from Canada to Tehran,”\nIran via two transfers. Husband testified that at the time he made the first transfer he did not\nthink he had received the divorce papers. Husband testified that when he went to Wife’s\nattorney’s office to pick up the divorce papers, no one told him about the restraining order,\nand that he “actually never read the whole paper” because he was upset.\n\n              In addition to the $1.5 million withdrawal, Husband made other withdrawals\n\n                                              -5-\n\ffrom his deferred compensation account during the marriage. Exhibits introduced at trial\nshow withdrawals of approximately $37,000, $194,000, and $85,000, among others.\nHusband testified that he loaned money to his sister and her husband. A copy of a check\nintroduced at trial shows that Husband wrote a check to his sister in 2003 for $40,000.\nHusband stated that his sister paid him back approximately $6,500, and that Husband does\nnot expect her and her husband to pay back the remainder of the loaned monies. Husband\nalso testified that he has been paying some of his sick parent’s expenses. Husband stated:\n“I’ve been supporting my parents for the last 20-some years ….” In October Husband sent\nhis parents $10,000, which he testified was to pay for their hospital bills. Husband testified\nthat he would estimate that he has sent his parents approximately $8,000 to $10,000 per year.\nHusband also has paid $1,000 per month plus all expenses for his children from his previous\nmarriage. Husband later testified that he had sent $3,000 to his daughter from his previous\nmarriage and, when questioned further, stated that his earlier answer of $1,000 referred to\nthe alimony he paid to his previous wife.\n\n             Husband claimed that CD accounts in both the parties’ names were actually his\nseparate property. He testified:\n\n       Before I got married I had two CD accounts: one was with AmSouth, and the\n       other one was SunTrust Bank. And over the years it went from one CD\n       account to another. When it matured, I put them in another account. And all\n       the money that we didn’t spend from year to year I added to those, to different\n       CD accounts. And all the CD accounts, they were all in my name until last\n       year when she specifically asked me that she wants to be added to - - her name\n       to be added to the CD accounts. So we both went to Regions Bank and I\n       added her name to my CD accounts.\n\nHusband asserted that at the time the parties married, one of his CD accounts was worth\napproximately $58,000, and the other approximately $40,000.\n\n              Husband testified that he and Wife talked about the possibility of her returning\nto work. He stated that he told Wife that there were different companies paying people with\nWife’s experience and level of education between $70,000 and $80,000. Husband testified\nthat Wife’s “engineering degree and experience that she has when she worked at Alstom,\nthat’s adequate to get a decent job.”\n\n              After trial, the Trial Court entered its detailed order on April 16, 2009 finding\nand holding, inter alia:\n\n       K. The Court finds that [Wife] has grounds for divorce and should be granted\n\n                                              -6-\n\fa divorce on the grounds of Inappropriate Marital conduct.\n\n                                     ***\n\nC. The Court finds that the [Husband’s] home, located at 619 Grand Mountain\nDrive, Chattanooga, TN is his premarital property as defined by T.C.A. § 36-4-\n121(a)(1)(B); the liability for the mortgage at SunTrust Bank is solely\n[Husband’s]. However, the home has increased $50,000 in value during the\nmarriage. In addition, the mortgage has been reduced from $177,000 to\n$88,000 during the marriage which results in an additional increase of $89,000\nin equity paid with income received during the marriage.\n\nThe Court further finds that throughout the marriage, [Husband] never\ntransferred title to the property to [Wife], nor increased the debt on the\nproperty to the financial detriment of [Wife]. Neither did he ever treat the\nproperty as marital property. Transmutation occurs when previously separate\nproperty is treated in such [a] way as to give evidence of an intention that it\nbecome marital property. This can occur if property is purchased with separate\nfunds but then titled to both parties to the marriage, or it can occur by deeding\nseparate property into the names of both parties with the intent to make a gift\nof the property to the marital estate.

McClellan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Tn. App. [sic] 1993).\n\n[Husband’s] premarital home was thus never transmuted into marital property\nand remains the sole and exclusive property of [Husband].\n\nD. The Court finds that the parties’ agreed division of non-vehicular personal\nproperty results in [Wife] receiving assets valued at $14,750 and [Husband]\nassets valued at receiving $9,060. Ex. 51 and 40.\n\nE. The court further finds that the parties’ agreed division of vehicles results\nin [Wife] receiving $18,000 and [Husband] receiving $15,800. Ex. 68, p.1.\n\nF. The Court finds that $94,186 of [Husband’s] 401(k) is a premarital asset.\nEx. 65 and 27. The current value of said 401(k) is $251,012. Ex. 74. Thus,\n$156,826 of the increase of the 401(k) is a marital asset.\n\nG. The Court finds that the TVA Pension is not able to be calculated under the\nrules of said Plan. Therefore, the portion acquired during marriage shall be\ncalculated as a fraction, the numerator of which shall be 8.25, being the\n\n                                       -7-\n\fnumber of years of marriage between these parties, and the denominator shall\nbe the total years in which [Husband] shall have been a member of said Plan,\nfrom the date of his initial membership until the date he retires from TVA. Ex.\n5.\n\nH. The Court finds that the Regions Bank CD is a marital asset. In 2006,\n[Husband] specifically put his wife’s name on the Certificate of Deposit.\nTransmutation is brought about “by placing separate property in the name of\nboth spouses.” Batson v Batson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1625062\"><a href=\"/opinion/1625062/batson-v-batson/\"><span class=\"volume\">769</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">849</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 858 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1988).\nThe current value of said CD is $1,050,000. Ex. 68.\n\nI. [Husband] claims as his separate property on “Exhibit 58\" $250,000 in\ndeferred compensation with TVA. The Court finds that as of October 2000\n[Husband] did have $247,258 in his deferred compensation plan (Exhibit 75).\nHowever, the court finds that [Husband] has withdrawn from his deferred\ncompensation account $37,083 October 2, 2000, $194,221 on August 2007 and\n$85,000 September 23, 2005 (Exhibit 9, 10, 31, 90). Having withdrawn from\nhis deferred compensation plan more money than he had in the fund when the\nparties married, the Court finds that there is no longer any separate money in\nhis deferred compensation plan. [Husband] also paid alimony and child\nsupport to his first wife and family, gave $40,000 to his sister, and gave\nthousands of dollars to his parents in Iran during the marriage. The current\nvalue of [Husband’s] TVA Deferred Compensation Plan is $2,730,141. The\nCourt further finds that the afore-stated value is the remainder after the\n[$1,500,000] withdrawn therefrom by [Husband] on December 24, 2007. Ex.\n13.\n\n       1. Before [Husband] withdrew $1.5 million from his deferred\n       compensation account, he had over four million dollars in\n       deferred compensation (Exhibit 25). He deposited the $975,000\n       he received from the withdrawal after taxes were withheld in the\n       joint CD account (Ex. 23) To withdraw the 1.5 million,\n       [Husband] falsely certified that he was making a “hardship\n       withdrawal” for “housing” (Exhibit 30). He admits he knew his\n       application was the same as a sworn affidavit and that the\n       statements that the financial hardship is “my immediate and\n       heavy financial need” and that the stated purpose of the\n       withdrawal for “housing” were not true. Because of the\n       embargo on doing business with Iran, from the $975,000\n       deposited in the joint CD account, [Husband] transferred\n\n                                      -8-\n\f       $600,000 to a bank in Canada to be transferred to his brother-in-\n       law in Iran to be invested (Ex. 29). He testified he did not know\n       where the money was, if it was drawing interest or whose name\n       it is deposited in but he could get it back.\n\n       2. The remainder was placed in the Regions Bank CD where it\n       remains.\n\nJ. Although [Husband] claims the $300,000 he transferred to Iran on the day\nhe was served with this divorce and $300,000 he transferred February 14,\n2008, three days after the divorce complaint was filed are his separate funds,\nthe Court finds this money was earned during the marriage and is marital\nproperty. [Husband] claims that he did not read the injunction against\ntransferring and disposing of funds before he made the transfers. The Court\nfinds that these transfers were made after [Husband] knew or should have\nknown that he was enjoined from withdrawing these funds from the joint CD\naccount. The Court finds it makes no difference whether [Husband] knew or\ndid not know about the injunction, the money was admittedly withdrawn from\nthe joint CD account and is a marital asset to be divided with his wife. Wife\ntestified she was against this investment because of the political situation\nbetween Iran and the United States.\n\nK. The following assets are found to be [Husband’s] separate assets: $94,185\nin [Husband’s] 401(k) Plan in July 2000 (Ex. 26); $119,214 in his TVA\nRetirement Annuity; that part of his TVA pension earned prior to the marriage\nand the part earned following the dissolution of this marriage; a boat; two\nrefrigerators; a washer; a dryer; a stereo; a camera; and two Persian rugs.\n\nL. The following assets are found to be [Wife’s] separate property: all her\njewelry; fifty percent interest in house in Iran given by her parents; furniture\nshe owned prior to the marriage.\n\n                                     ***\n\n       In dividing the assets, the Court considered the fact that [Husband]\nowned the residence prior to the marriage and that during the marriage about\n$89,000 in equity resulted from the payments of principal, interest and\ninsurance from money earned during the marriage.

[Husband] did not need the money.\nIf he had not withdrawn it, it could have been distributed to Wife at a much\nlower tax rate.\n\n        When [Husband] married [Wife], he had $72,579.57 in AmSouth\nchecking, $103,694.87 in AmSouth CD’s and $38,000 in SunTrust CD[’]s, a\ntotal of $214,229.44. (Exhibit 58 of [Husband’s] responses to Interrogatories\ndated May 21, 2008 with his list of Assets and Liabilities). He claims the\namount of these accounts should be set aside to him as his separate property.\nBoth parties testified that after they married, [Husband] put his wife on his\nbank accounts. He referred to the Regions Bank account as “our” account and\nstated “we” put everything in one account. In 2006, he specifically put his\nwife’s name on the certificate of deposit account in which there was\n$1,713,827 on January 31, 2008 (Ex. 39, 69).\n\n        [Husband] admits that he paid alimony and child support after their\nmarriage to his first wife and family (Exhibit 93). He sent thousands of dollars\nto his parents in Iran during this marriage. He gave or loaned $40,000 to his\nsister, Sepideh Maghandam. He cannot identify any account in which the\nmoney he had when he married is now located.\n\n      Transmutation is brought about “by placing separate property in the\nname of both spouses.” Batson v. Batson, 769, [sic] S.W.2d 849, 858 (Tenn.\nCt. App. 1988).\n\n       During the marriage, when parties treat their separate property in such\na way as to show their intent that it become marital property, transmutation\noccurs.\n\n       Although [Husband] claims the $300,000 he transferred to Iran on the\nday he was served with this divorce and $300,000 he transferred February 14,\n2008, three days after the divorce complaint was filed are his separate funds,\nthe Court finds this money was earned during the marriage and is marital\nproperty.\n\n                                     ***\n\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fA. [Husband] is employed by the Tennessee Valley Authority. His present\ncontract is for the position of Vice President of Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, Unit\n2. Ex. 4 and 33. Said contract expires in 2012, but because of possible\nperformance bonuses, benefits may be paid through 2013. [Husband] has no\ncontract of employment beyond 2012 with TVA or any other employer.\n[Husband] has testified that he reasonably believes his employment under the\ncontract will actually be completed during 2011.\n\nB. [Husband’s] present income, including bonuses, is $619,000 a year. (Ex.\n72).\n\nC. [Husband] has received all deferred compensation disbursements to which\nhe is entitled under his previous contacts for Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant. The\nfinal such disbursement was received on July 23, 2008, Ex. 11.\n\nD. [Husband] is presently under contract to receive deferred compensation,\nbased upon his completion of the contract and his attainment of certain\nperformance goals. However, the deferred compensation can only be received\nif he remains a TVA employee during the term of said contract and completes\nsaid entire contract.\n\n       1. The amount of said deferred compensation which he receives\n       varies depending upon his attainment of certain goals.\n\n       2. As with his deferred compensation under his Browns Ferry\n       Contract, said deferred compensation from Watts Bar will be\n       paid into a deferred compensation account and not directly to\n       [Husband]. Because the deferred compensation is contingent,\n       the Court did not include it in the child support calculation.\n\nE. Further, said deferred compensation is paid to [Husband], if earned, only\nat certain times and any withdrawal of said funds by him from said deferred\ncompensation account is a taxable event to him at the time they are withdrawn.\n\nF. [Husband’s] one-time withdrawal on December 24, 2007, Ex. 13, of\n$1,500,000 ($985,000, after taxes) from a deferred compensation plan\nestablished by his employer did not represent earnings for purposes of\ncalculating child support; said withdrawal was an asset transfer for the\npurposes of purchasing and developing a piece of real property in Iran.\n\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fG. [Husband’s] earnings during the marriage were $293,437.58 in 2000;\n$212,532 plus $6,212 in interest in 2001; $115,786 plus $562 interest in 2002;\n$155,196 plus $155 interest in 2003; $119,657 plus $7 interest in 2004;\n$300,841 plus $199 interest in 2005 (all from testimony of [Husband]);\n$594,344 plus $870 interest in 2006 (Ex. 15), and $619,885.54 plus $14,895\ninterest in 2007 (Ex. 14).\n\nH. [Wife] is a licensed civil engineer with a baccalaureate degree.\n\nI. [Wife] speaks three languages, has no physical or mental limitations, and is\ncapable of working.\n\nJ. [Wife’s] last salary was $44,000 a year in 2001 from Alstom Power.\n\n       1. This was her first job as a civil engineer after obtaining her\n       degree.\n\n       2. [Wife] worked for approximately 7 months, until near the\n       birth of the parties’ first child.\n\n       3. In 2001, [Wife] retained all of her earnings, $24,286.47\n       rather than contributing them to the family income; she used her\n       earnings to pay her pre-marital debt for her college education\n       with the agreement of [Husband].\n\nK. [Wife] is capable of earning between $72,000 and $80,000 a year in the\nChattanooga area.\n\nL. There are positions paying these starting salaries in the Chattanooga area;\nsuch positions have been available for the last few years and would not be\nunder the supervision or control of [Husband.]\n\nM. [Wife] has refused to return to work or seek work during the pendency of\nthis divorce. However, she is aware that there are positions available for her\nto work in the field in which she is trained.\n\n                                    ***\n\nO. Pursuant to the Tennessee Administrative Regulations § 1240-2-4, the\nChild Support Regulations, [Wife] is inferred to have income of $72,000 a\n\n                                     -12-\n\fyear and the Court determines [Husband] has income of $619,000 a year.\n\n                                    ***\n\n      a. Pursuant to § 1240-2-4-.07(g), the maximum child support\n      obligations payable by [Husband] to [Wife] is presently $3,200\n      a month.\n\n      b. [Husband] has already agreed in open Court to continue to\n      pay the children’s private school tuition, books, and fees,\n      (including the expected increases therein thru 12 th grade) and\n      their summer activity fees. These amounts, for 2007, amounted\n      to $25,599.96, which for child support calculation purposes is\n      converted to $2,133.33/month.\n\n             (1) The Court adopts and approves this agreement\n             as a part of his additional child support obligation.\n\n      c. The Final Child Support Order, or FCSO, (Ex. 86, line 16)\n      and the pro-rata monthly cost of private school and summer\n      activities, is $5,333.33 a month[.]\n\n      d. Because the FCSO and the private school and summer\n      activity expenses exceeds the amount of [Husband’s] duty under\n      the Adjusted Support Obligations, or ASO by over $900 a\n      month, [Husband] shall have no other duty of financial support\n      for his children.\n\n      e. Under the present child support laws, [Husband] is not\n      responsible for his children’s education or care beyond the 12 th\n      grade, unless said child were to become an adult disabled child.\n      T.C.A. § 36-5-101.\n\n      f. Further, based on [Husband’s] treatment of children of his\n      first marriage, the Court does not find [Husband] to be a risk of\n      flight or abandonment and therefore, there is no reason to\n      require [Husband] to establish and fund an education trust for\n      his children.\n\n      Thus, the Court finds the testimony of Dr. Bruce Hutchinson of\n\n                                     -13-\n\f       no benefit in determining [Husband’s] future child support\n       obligations.\n\n                                      ***\n\n      Taking into consideration the factors set out in T.C.A. 36-5-101(d) the\nCourt has determined that [Wife] is economically disadvantaged relative to\n[Husband] and should be awarded alimony. The Court finds that even though\nWife has the education and training as an engineer, it is unlikely that she\nwould ever be rehabilitated to an earning capacity approaching that of\n[Husband].\n\n        The parties shared a comfortable living standard that exceeded the\naverage and Husband was still able to put aside large sums of money. Wife\nwas able to go to New York, Atlanta and London for shopping trips. Husband\ntook trips to Iran and sometimes traveled with Wife. Husband purchased, as\ngifts for Wife, expensive jewelry.\n\n       The Court finds both parties contributed to this marriage. [Husband] by\nhis financial contribution. There is no question that his stressful job caused\nhim to spend many hours and often days away from his family and to have a\nstrained, detached relationship with [Wife] when he was home. [Wife]\nwillingly took over almost all of the child care, household upkeep and\nhomemaker duties.\n\n        Need and the ability to pay are the critical factors in setting the amount\nof an alimony award.

She explained the reason for the\ndifference between $11,160 a month in expense statements she filed in May\n2008 was because that expense statement was for her temporary expenses\nwhile the case was pending and [Husband] was paying for health insurance\nand other insurance and expenses that she did not consider.\n\n       She explained the $1600 for mortgage on her Exhibits 17 and 18 was\nto cover insurance and taxes. She hoped she would receive a sufficient amount\n\n                                       -14-\n\fof liquid assets so she could pay a substantial amount of cash for a residence\nand have no mortgage or a very small mortgage. The Court finds these\nexplanations credible.\n\n       [Husband] says the entire family lived on $10,000 a month. However,\nhe spent two years living in Huntsville and now lives in Spring City and\nreceives various reimbursements and benefits from TVA. He testified TVA\npaid for all of his housing expenses when he is living away from Chattanooga\nbecause Chattanooga was his home base.\n\n       Furthermore, based on his representation that his net pay was\n$21,498.97 a month, his net income for 2008 through October was\n$214,989.70. In addition to that, he drew an additional $144,000 (net on his\n$188,000 bonus), a total of $358,989.70 net after taxes and other deductions,\nsuch as health insurance.\n\n       [Husband] started paying spousal support June 1, 2008. In July 2008,\nhe drew $144,000 net on his $188,000 compensation bonus. In the five\nmonths between June 1 and November 5, he had total income of $251,490. He\npaid his wife and for his children, $32,500 (6,500 a month). [Husband] by his\nrepresentations should have had $218,990 disposable income after paying\nspousal and child support.\n\n       The Court finds [Wife’s] testimony about their usual standard of living\nis more credible than [Husband’s]. The Court finds her request for $14,567 is\nreasonable. Since the Court found that [Husband] should pay $3,200 for child\nsupport and the costs of private school tuitions, [Wife’s] need is reduced to\n$5,734. However, [Wife] did not consider the fact that she would have to pay\nincome tax on the amount awarded to her as alimony. Husband will be able\nto deduct the alimony. Considering a minimum of 15% income tax Wife will\nhave to pay, the Court finds that [Wife] needs and [Husband] can afford to pay\n$6,600 a month as transitional spousal support for a period of six years;\nreducing to $4,500 per month for three years and then $2,500 per month as\nperiodic alimony.\n\n       Further, as part of her transition, [Wife] shall be entitled to remain in\nthe house at 619 Grand Mountain Drive up to ninety (90) days following the\npayment to her of the lump sum specified by the Court as her share of the\nmarital property. During this period, [Husband] shall pay the mortgage,\ninsurance and taxes on the home.\n\n                                      -15-\n\f                                             ***\n\n              Wife has requested that the fees she incurred in this divorce be\n       adjudged against [Husband]. The Court finds said request is reasonable and\n       should be granted.\n\n              In adjudging the fees against Husband as additional alimony, the Court\n       has considered the disparity in the earning capacities of the parties; the issues\n       raised by Husband regarding the Islamic marital certificate being a prenuptial\n       agreement, and his alleged premarital assets which no longer existed; and his\n       transfer of assets after service of the statutory injunction. The attorney’s fees\n       and costs resulted from [Wife] being forced to defend against these claims to\n       protect her future and the support and education of their children.\n\n                                             ***\n\n       6.

The payment of\n       transitional spousal support to [Wife] is non-modifiable and shall not terminate\n       on the remarriage of [Wife], but shall terminate on the death of either party.\n       The periodic alimony shall terminate on the death of either party and the\n       remarriage of [Wife], whichever occurs first.\n\n              Husband filed a motion to alter or amend or for a new trial, which the Trial\nCourt granted in part and denied in part finding and holding, inter alia, that if transfer of any\nportion of Husband’s TVA Deferred Compensation Plan results in a taxable event, each party\nwill be responsible for one-half of said taxes. Husband appeals to this Court.\n\n                                          Discussion\n\n               Although not stated exactly as such, Husband raises seven issues on appeal: 1)\nwhether the Trial Court erred in holding that certain of Husband’s pre-marital assets had been\ntransmuted, and that certain of Husband’s pre-marital assets had been co-mingled with\nmarital assets; 2) whether the Trial Court erred in dividing the portion of Husband’s deferred\ncompensation not accessible to Husband until certain contractual dates and conditions have\nbeen met; 3) whether the Trial Court erred in awarding transitional alimony to Wife, and in\nsetting the amount; 4) whether the Trial Court erred in awarding alimony in futuro to Wife,\nand in setting the amount; 5) whether the Trial Court erred in awarding Wife attorney’s fees;\n6) whether the Trial Court erred in finding that Husband had violated the initial statutory\n\n                                              -16-\n\frestraining order; and, 7) whether the Trial Court erred in requiring Husband to pay for\ncertain portions of the transcript Wife wanted included on appeal.\n\n              Wife raises four issues on appeal, which we restate as: 1) whether the Trial\nCourt erred in failing to establish an educational trust for the minor children; 2) whether the\nTrial Court erred in limiting child support to the presumptive amount of $3,200; 3) whether\nthe Trial Court erred in imputing income to Wife of $72,000 a year for purposes of\ncalculating child support; and, 4) whether the Trial Court erred in failing to include\nHusband’s deferred compensation in the child support calculation. Wife also requests an\naward of attorney’s fees on appeal, and requests that this Court take notice of a post-judicial\nfact.\n\n               Our review is de novo upon the record, accompanied by a presumption of\ncorrectness of the findings of fact of the trial court, unless the preponderance of the evidence\nis otherwise.

These two methods are commingling and transmutation, which the Supreme Court\nnoted have been described by this Court as follows:\n\n              [S]eparate property becomes marital property [by commingling]\n              if inextricably mingled with marital property or with the separate\n              property of the other spouse. If the separate property continues\n              to be segregated or can be traced into its product, commingling\n              does not occur.... [Transmutation] occurs when separate\n              property is treated in such a way as to give evidence of an\n              intention that it become marital property.... The rationale\n              underlying these doctrines is that dealing with property in these\n              ways creates a rebuttable presumption of a gift to the marital\n              estate. This presumption is based also upon the provision in\n              many marital property statutes that property acquired during the\n\n                                              -17-\n\f              marriage is presumed to be marital. The presumption can be\n              rebutted by evidence of circumstances or communications\n              clearly indicating an intent that the property remain separate.\n\nLangschmidt, 81 S.W.3d at 747 (citations omitted).\n\n                Husband argues on appeal about two specific items that he claims should have\nbeen classified as his pre-marital property. First, Husband claims that he had accumulated\napproximately $214,000 in CDs and other accounts prior to the marriage and that this money\nshould have been classified as his separate property. The evidence in the record on appeal\nshows that Husband put Wife’s name on these accounts during the marriage. Husband\nasserts that he put Wife’s name on the accounts because Wife pressured him to do so, but that\nhe never intended to gift that money to Wife or to the marriage.\n\n               The Trial Court found that these pre-marital funds had been transmuted when\nHusband put Wife’s name on the accounts. The evidence does not preponderate against this\nfinding. Husband failed to rebut the presumption that by putting Wife’s name on the\naccounts he was making a gift to the marital estate. We find no error in the Trial Court’s\nclassification that this property, which had been Husband’s pre-marital separate property,\nwas transmuted into marital property.\n\n                Second, Husband argues on appeal that the Trial Court erred in classifying all\nof the funds in Husband’s deferred compensation plan as marital when Husband asserts that\napproximately $250,000 of those funds constituted pre-marital property. With regard to this\nissue, the Trial Court specifically found that: “Having withdrawn from his deferred\ncompensation plan more money than [Husband] had in the fund when the parties married,\nthe Court finds that there is no longer any separate money in his deferred compensation\nplan.” The Trial Court found that during the marriage, Husband had paid alimony and child\nsupport to his previous family, had given money to his sister and his parents, and had\nwrongfully withdrawn $1.5 million after fraudulently claiming a hardship thereby incurring\ntax liability and dissipating the marital estate.\n\n              The evidence does not preponderate against these findings made by the Trial\nCourt. We find no error in the Trial Court’s holding that there no longer existed any pre-\nmarital funds in Husband’s deferred compensation account.\n\n             We next consider whether the Trial Court erred in dividing the portion of\nHusband’s deferred compensation not accessible to Husband until certain contractual dates\nand conditions have been met. In its order the Trial Court held that Husband:\n\n\n\n                                             -18-\n\f       shall execute such documents as are necessary and required by Tennessee\n       Valley Authority and Tennessee Valley Authority Retirement Systems and/or\n       the Plan Administrators of any of [Husband’s] retirement and deferred\n       compensation plans to transfer to [Wife] fifty percent of the amount in the\n       deferred compensation and that part of the pension, 401 (k) and the TVA\n       Retirement Annuity earned and/or contributed from July 20, 2000 to the date\n       of the divorce, together with the gains and losses, if any, to the date of\n       distribution to [Wife].\n\nUnder the Trial Court’s order, Wife will get fifty percent of the amount in Husband’s\ndeferred compensation plan which the Trial Court found to have a value as of the time of trial\nof $2,730,141. The evidence does not preponderate against this finding as to the value of\nHusband’s deferred compensation plan.\n\n               It is not the role of this Court to tweak a trial court’s distribution of property.\nRather, we must look to determine if the overall property distribution is equitable. King v.\nKing, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1079274\"><a href=\"/opinion/1079274/king-v-king/\"><span class=\"volume\">986</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">216</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 219 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1998). Husband, as is often the case in appeals\nto this Court concerning a division of marital property, wishes to focus on whether the\ndivision as to particular assets was equitable rather than whether the overall property\ndistribution was equitable. We decline to tweak the property division as the evidence does\nnot preponderate against this being an overall equitable marital property distribution. The\nevidence in the record before us does not preponderate against either the Trial Court’s\nclassification or valuation of the marital property. Likewise, the evidence does not\npreponderate against the Trial Court’s property division being an equitable division. This\nissue is without merit.\n\n               Next, we consider whether the Trial Court erred in awarding transitional\nalimony to Wife, and in setting the amount. Trial courts have broad discretion to determine\nwhether alimony is needed and, if so, the nature, amount, and duration of support. Garfinkel\nv.

Ct. App. 1996). Pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. §\n36-5-121(i), the court is to consider the following factors in determining alimony:\n\n              (1) The relative earning capacity, obligations, needs, and financial\n       resources of each party, including income from pension, profit sharing or\n       retirement plans and all other sources;\n\n               (2) The relative education and training of each party, the ability and\n       opportunity of each party to secure such education and training, and the\n       necessity of a party to secure further education and training to improve such\n       party's earnings capacity to a reasonable level;\n\n                                              -19-\n\f              (3) The duration of the marriage;\n\n              (4) The age and mental condition of each party;\n\n             (5) The physical condition of each party, including, but not limited to,\n       physical disability or incapacity due to a chronic debilitating disease;\n\n              (6) The extent to which it would be undesirable for a party to seek\n       employment outside the home, because such party will be custodian of a minor\n       child of the marriage;\n\n              (7) The separate assets of each party, both real and personal, tangible\n       and intangible;\n\n              (8) The provisions made with regard to the marital property, as defined\n       in § 36-4-121;\n\n              (9) The standard of living of the parties established during the marriage;\n\n              (10) The extent to which each party has made such tangible and\n       intangible contributions to the marriage as monetary and homemaker\n       contributions, and tangible and intangible contributions by a party to the\n       education, training or increased earning power of the other party;\n\n              (11) The relative fault of the parties, in cases where the court, in its\n       discretion, deems it appropriate to do so; and\n\n              (12) Such other factors, including the tax consequences to each party,\n       as are necessary to consider the equities between the parties.\n\nTenn.

Anderton, 988 S.W.2d at 683. While all of\nthe statutory factors are significant, the two most important factors are the obligor spouse’s\nability to pay and the need of the disadvantaged spouse. Aaron v. Aaron, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2452214\"><a href=\"/opinion/2452214/aaron-v-aaron/\"><span class=\"volume\">909</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">408</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n410 (Tenn. 1995).\n\n\n\n                                             -20-\n\f              In pertinent part, Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(g) provides:\n\n       (g)(1) Transitional alimony means a sum of money payable by one (1) party to,\n       or on behalf of, the other party for a determinate period of time. Transitional\n       alimony is awarded when the court finds that rehabilitation is not necessary,\n       but the economically disadvantaged spouse needs assistance to adjust to the\n       economic consequences of a divorce, legal separation or other proceeding\n       where spousal support may be awarded, such as a petition for an order of\n       protection.\n\nTenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(g)(1) (2005).\n\n                As pertinent to this issue, the Trial Court found “[Wife] needs and [Husband]\ncan afford to pay $6,600 a month as transitional spousal support for a period of six years;\nreducing to $4,500 per month for three years ….” We agree with the Trial Court that the\nevidence shows that Wife is not in need of rehabilitation. Wife is a licensed civil engineer\nwho holds a baccalaureate degree. She has worked in the past at her chosen career. The\nevidence in the record on appeal further shows that Wife quit working outside the home\nwhen she gave birth to the parties’ first child, and that Wife has worked as a homemaker and\nstay-at-home mother since that time. Thus, Wife had been out of the workforce, as of the\ntime of trial, for seven years. The evidence does not preponderate against the Trial Court’s\nfinding that Wife is economically disadvantaged and in need of assistance to adjust to the\neconomic consequences of divorce.\n\n             The Trial Court awarded Wife transitional alimony for nine years in this eight\nyear marriage. Wife and Husband were married for only seven years when Wife filed for\ndivorce.\n\n              The evidence preponderates against the Trial Court’s finding that Wife needs\nlonger to adjust to the economic consequences of the divorce than the parties were married\nand for longer than Wife did not work in her chosen profession. Given the facts and\ncircumstances in this case, including Wife’s professional training and the significant assets\nshe received in the property division, the award of transitional alimony for nine years for\nwhat was only an eight year marriage is inappropriate.\n\n              Given the facts and circumstances of this case as discussed, we find that an\naward of transitional alimony in the amount of $6,600 a month for six years is appropriate\nto allow Wife to adjust to the economic consequences of the divorce. We, therefore, modify\nthe award of transitional alimony to be in the amount of $6,600 per month lasting only six\nyears.\n\n                                            -21-\n\f               We next consider whether the Trial Court erred in awarding alimony in futuro\nto Wife, and in calculating the amount. As pertinent to this issue, Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-\n121(f)(1) states:\n\n               (f)(1) Alimony in futuro, also known as periodic alimony, is a payment\n       of support and maintenance on a long term basis or until death or remarriage\n       of the recipient. Such alimony may be awarded when the court finds that there\n       is relative economic disadvantage and that rehabilitation is not feasible,\n       meaning that the disadvantaged spouse is unable to achieve, with reasonable\n       effort, an earning capacity that will permit the spouse's standard of living after\n       the divorce to be reasonably comparable to the standard of living enjoyed\n       during the marriage, or to the post-divorce standard of living expected to be\n       available to the other spouse, considering the relevant statutory factors and the\n       equities between the parties.\n\nTenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(f)(1) (2005).\n\n              The Trial Court specifically found that:\n\n       H. [Wife] is a licensed civil engineer with a baccalaureate degree.\n\n       I. [Wife] speaks three languages, has no physical or mental limitations, and is\n       capable of working.\n\n       J. [Wife’s] last salary was $44,000 a year in 2001 for Alstom Power.\n\n              1. This was her first job as a civil engineer after obtaining her\n              degree.\n\n              2. [Wife] worked for approximately 7 months, until near the\n              birth of the parties’ first child.\n\n              3. In 2001, [Wife] retained all of her earnings, $24,286.47\n              rather than contributing them to the family income; she used her\n              earnings to pay her pre-marital debt for her college education\n              with the agreement of [Husband].\n\n       K. [Wife] is capable of earning between $72,000 and $80,000 a year in the\n       Chattanooga area.\n\n\n\n                                             -22-\n\f       L. There are positions paying these starting salaries in the Chattanooga area;\n       such positions have been available for the last few years and would not be\n       under the supervision or control of [Husband.]\n\n       M. [Wife] has refused to return to work or seek work during the pendency of\n       this divorce. However, she is aware that there are positions available for her\n       to work in the field in which she is trained.\n\nThe Trial Court also found that “even though Wife has the education and training as an\nengineer, it is unlikely that she would ever be rehabilitated to an earning capacity\napproaching that of [Husband].”\n\n               We respectfully disagree. The record reveals that Wife was forty-one years old\nat the time of trial, speaks three languages, and has no physical or mental limitations which\nwould prevent her from working. She holds the same baccalaureate degree as does Husband\nand is a licensed civil engineer. Wife was able in the past to obtain a job working in her\nchosen field. The evidence further shows that there are job openings within Wife’s chosen\nfield in the community where Wife lives. Wife received almost $2.6 million in assets from\nthe distribution of marital property plus one-half of Husband’s TVA pension earned during\nthe eight year marriage and received no debt.\n\n              This was a relatively short-term marriage lasting only eight years. While the\nTrial Court noted that the parties enjoyed “a comfortable living standard that exceeded the\naverage …,” the record also reveals that during the first five years of the eight years the\nparties were married, Husband’s income was significantly less than it was during the final\nyears of the marriage. It is pure speculation to say that it is unlikely that Wife could reach\nan earning capacity approaching that of Husband given Wife’s age, education, and\nqualifications. Wife is younger than Husband and Wife has almost the same educational\nbackground as Husband does. Wife has no acceptable reason for not working in her chosen\nprofession. The record is devoid of evidence showing that Wife is unable to obtain a job, or\nincapable of working. Another important factor relevant to the issue of Wife’s need is that\nshe received almost $2.6 million of the marital property from this marriage of only eight\nyears.\n\n               The evidence preponderates against a finding that Wife has a need for alimony\nin futuro extending beyond the six years of transitional alimony. After considering all of the\nrelevant factors, we conclude that the award of alimony in futuro was inappropriate in this\ncase. We, therefore, vacate the award of alimony in futuro.\n\n              Next, we consider whether the Trial Court erred in calculating the award of\n\n                                             -23-\n\fattorney’s fees. An award of alimony in solido for payment of attorney fees likewise should\nbe based on the factors set forth in Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(i), and is appropriate when\nthe spouse seeking attorney fees does not have adequate funds to pay his or her legal\nexpenses. Yount v. Yount, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1636819\"><a href=\"/opinion/1636819/yount-v-yount/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">777</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 783 (Tenn.

Koja, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1073497\"><a href=\"/opinion/1073497/koja-v-koja/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 98 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2000).\n\n               Wife received almost $2.6 million in assets in the divorce plus one-half of\nHusband’s TVA pension earned during the marriage and no debt. She has adequate funds\nto pay her own legal expenses. We note, however, that during argument before the Trial\nCourt on the post-trial motions, Husband’s attorney admitted that Husband did not object to\nthe request for attorney’s fees with regard to Husband’s argument that the Islamic marriage\ncertificate constituted a prenuptial agreement under Islamic law. Husband’s attorney stated:\n“We failed in that. We deserve to be hit with [the attorney’s fees relative to this issue], for\nlack of a better phrase, I hate to use the word deserve, but the bottom line is, that’s how it\nworks.” Given this admission, we find that Husband shall be responsible for paying Wife’s\nattorney’s fees with regard to this particular issue.\n\n               Rather than remand for a determination of the cost of fees specific to this\nparticular argument, which would result in the parties expending even more money on\nattorney’s fees, we find that the $10,000 that Husband already has paid toward Wife’s\nattorney’s fees covers these fees. Wife is responsible for the remainder of her legal expenses.\nWe, therefore, modify the Trial Court’s award of attorney’s fees to Wife to reflect that\nHusband is responsible only for the $10,000, which Husband already has paid, and that Wife\nis responsible for the remainder of her legal expenses.\n\n                We next consider whether the Trial Court erred in finding that Husband had\nviolated the initial statutory restraining order. The Trial Court found that Husband made two\ntransfers of money “after [Husband] knew or should have known that he was enjoined from\nwithdrawing these funds from the joint CD account.” The evidence does not preponderate\nagainst this finding. We note that the Trial Court did not “punish” Husband in any way for\nthis violation. We find no error in the Trial Court’s finding that Husband had violated the\ninitial statutory restraining order.\n\n              We next consider whether the Trial Court erred in requiring Husband to pay\nfor certain portions of the transcript Wife wanted included on appeal. After filing this\nappeal, Husband designated portions of the record to be included on appeal. Wife then\ndesignated additional portions of the record she wanted included on appeal. Husband filed\na motion seeking an order requiring Wife to pay for the additional portions of the record\nwhich she had designated. The Trial Court held a hearing and then entered its order finding\n\n                                             -24-\n\fand holding, inter alia, that Husband’s motion seeking to have Wife pay for the disputed\nportions of the record was not well taken.\n\n             In Scandlyn v. Scandlyn, this Court stated:\n\n             The trial court has wide latitude in the steps taken to assure that a “fair,\n      accurate and complete account of what transpired” is transmitted to the\n      appellate court. Rule 24(b), T.R.A.P., provides that if additional parts of the\n      record are designated by the appellee, the appellant shall “either have the\n      additional parts prepared at his own expense or apply to the trial court for an\n      order requiring the appellee to do so.” The action upon the application is, of\n      course, within the discretion of the trial court.\n\nScandlyn v. Scandlyn, No. 1043, 1986 Tenn. App. LEXIS 3138, at *11 (Tenn. Ct. App. July\n18, 1986), Rule 11 appl. perm. appeal denied Nov. 3, 1986. As this Court has explained:\n\n      Our Supreme Court discussed the abuse of discretion standard in Eldridge v.\n      Eldridge, stating:\n\n                     Under the abuse of discretion standard, a trial court’s\n             ruling “will be upheld so long as reasonable minds can disagree\n             as to [the] propriety of the decision made.” A trial court abuses\n             its discretion only when it “applie[s] an incorrect legal standard,\n             or reache[s] a decision which is against logic or reasoning that\n             cause[s] an injustice to the party complaining.” The abuse of\n             discretion standard does not permit the appellate court to\n             substitute its judgment for that of the trial court.\n\n      Eldridge v.

We will not substitute our judgment\nfor that of the Trial Court. We, therefore, find no error with regard to this issue.\n\n               Turning to Wife’s issues, we next consider whether the Trial Court erred in\nfailing to establish an educational trust for the minor children. With regard to this issue, the\nTrial Court found and held:\n\n       a. Pursuant to § 1240-2-4-.07(g), the maximum child support obligations\n       payable by [Husband] to [Wife] is presently $3,200 a month.\n\n       b. [Husband] has already agreed in open Court to continue to pay the\n       children’s private school tuition, books, and fees, (including the expected\n       increases therein thru 12th grade) and their summer activity fees. These\n       amounts, for 2007, amounted to $25,599.96, which for child support\n       calculation purposes is converted to $2,133.33/month.\n\n              (1) The Court adopts and approves this agreement as a part of\n              his additional child support obligation.\n\n       c. The Final Child Support Order, or FCSO, (Ex. 86, line 16) and the pro-rata\n       monthly cost of private school and summer activities, is $5,333.33 a month[.]\n\n       d. Because the FCSO and the private school and summer activity expenses\n       exceeds the amount of [Husband’s] duty under the Adjusted Support\n       Obligations, or ASO by over $900 a month, [Husband] shall have no other\n       duty of financial support for his children.\n\n       e. Under the present child support laws, [Husband] is not responsible for his\n       children’s education or care beyond the 12th grade, unless said child were to\n       become an adult disabled child. T.C.A. § 36-5-101.\n\n       f. Further, based on [Husband’s] treatment of children of his first marriage, the\n       Court does not find [Husband] to be a risk of flight or abandonment and\n       therefore, there is no reason to require [Husband] to establish and fund an\n       education trust for his children.\n\nThe evidence does not preponderate against these findings made by the Trial Court.\n\n\n\n                                              -26-\n\f               The Child Support Guidelines provide that a parent “seeking support in excess\nof the amount provided by the applicable percentage must prove by a preponderance of the\nevidence that more than this amount is reasonably necessary to provide for the needs of the\nchild.” Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 1240-2-4-.07(g)(1). If that parent proves the need for\nsupport in excess of the presumptive amount the court shall add an appropriate amount as a\ndeviation and “may require that sums paid pursuant to this subparagraph be placed in an\neducational or other trust fund for the benefit of the child.” Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 1240-2-\n4-.07(g)(2)(iii)1 .\n\n               Thus, it was within the Trial Court’s discretion to order an educational trust for\nthe benefit of the children if Wife first proved by a preponderance of the evidence that child\nsupport in an amount greater than the presumptive amount was reasonably necessary to\nprovide for the needs of the children. Wife failed to make this showing. As such, we find\nno abuse of discretion by the Trial Court and thus no error in the Trial Court’s refusal to\norder an educational trust.\n\n               We next consider whether the Trial Court erred in limiting child support to the\npresumptive amount. In her brief on appeal Wife argues: “If the alimony is reduced, then the\nchild support should be increased proportionately in accordance with the guideline\nregulations.” Wife fails to acknowledge that alimony and child support are two separate and\ndistinct issues. Furthermore, Wife also has failed to recognize that the Trial Court did award\nmore than the presumptive amount in child support when it first awarded the maximum\namount of child support under the guidelines, and then additionally approved Husband’s\nagreement to continue to pay private school tuition, books, fees, and summer activities, and\nawarded the amounts for these in addition to the maximum presumptive amount. In addition,\nwe note that in support of her argument Wife relies upon the testimony of Dr. Bruce\nHutchinson despite the fact that the Trial Court very clearly and specifically stated: “the\nCourt finds the testimony of Dr. Bruce Hutchinson of no benefit in determining [Husband’s]\nfuture child support obligations.” We find no error in the Trial Court’s award of child\nsupport.\n\n             Next, we consider whether the Trial Court erred in imputing income to Wife\nof $72,000 per year for the purposes of computing child support. As this Court explained in\nRichardson v. Spanos:\n\n\n\n        1\n         In her brief on appeal Wife quotes from the Child Support Guidelines in effect in the early 1990s\nand cites to case law from that same time period applying that specific section. The Child Support\nGuidelines have changed significantly since that time. We quote from and apply, as did the Trial Court, the\nChild Support Guidelines applicable at the time of the divorce in the instant case.\n\n                                                   -27-\n\f             Prior to the adoption of the Child Support Guidelines, trial courts had\n      wide discretion in matters relating to child custody and support.

Ct. App. 2005).\n\n             The Child Support Guidelines provide that imputing income to a parent when\n\n                                             -28-\n\fcalculating child support is appropriate: “If a parent has been determined by a tribunal to be\nwillfully and/or voluntarily underemployed or unemployed ….” Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs.\n1240-2-4-.04(3)(a)(2)(i)(I). When making a determination of willful or voluntary\nunemployment or underemployment, a trial court may consider:\n\n       (I) The parent’s past and present employment;\n\n       (II) The parent’s education, training, and ability to work;\n\n       (III) The State of Tennessee recognizes the role of a stay-at-home parent as an\n       important and valuable factor in a child’s life. In considering whether there\n       should be any imputation of income to a stay-at-home parent, the tribunal shall\n       consider:\n\n              I. Whether the parent acted in the role of full-time caretaker\n              while the parents were living in the same household;\n\n              II. The length of time the parent staying at home has remained\n              out of the workforce for this purpose; and\n\n              III. The age of the minor children.\n\nTenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 1240-2-4-.04(3)(a)(2)(iii).\n\nThe Trial Court clearly considered all of the relevant factors and determined that it was\nproper to impute income to Wife for purposes of calculating child support. The evidence in\nthe record on appeal does not preponderate against this finding.\n\n              Wife also argues that the Trial Court erred in imputing the amount of $72,000.\nThe record reveals that Husband testified that there are companies in the community where\nWife lives paying people with Wife’s experience and level of education between $70,000 and\n$80,000. The record on appeal is devoid of evidence to the contrary.\n\n               Wife argues that this Court should not accept Husband’s testimony with regard\nto this issue as the Trial Court found Husband to be not credible. Wife is mistaken. The\nTrial Court found Wife to be more credible with regard to other issues, but clearly found\nHusband to be credible with regard to this issue. The Trial Court specifically found that\n“[Wife] is capable of earning between $72,000 and $80,000 a year in the Chattanooga area”\nand that “[t]here are positions paying these starting salaries in the Chattanooga area; such\npositions have been available for the last few years and would not be under the supervision\n\n                                             -29-\n\for control of [Husband].”\n\n             The evidence in the record on appeal does not preponderate against these\nfindings. Given this, we find no error in the Trial Court’s imputing income to Wife of\n$72,000 per year for the purposes of computing child support.\n\n              We next consider whether the Trial Court erred in not including money from\nthe deferred compensation plan in Husband’s income for purposes of calculating child\nsupport. To begin, we again note that Wife’s argument relies upon the testimony of Dr.\nBruce Hutchinson, which the Trial Court clearly and specifically found to be “of no benefit\nin determining [Husband’s] future child support obligations.” In addition, the Trial Court\nawarded the maximum presumptive amount, and Wife failed to prove by a preponderance\nof the evidence that more than this amount was reasonably necessary to provide for the needs\nof the children, as discussed fully above. As such, even if the Trial Court erred in not\nconsidering the funds in the deferred compensation plan when calculating child support, and\nwe make no finding regarding whether this was or was not error, any such alleged error was\nharmless. This issue is without merit.\n\n               Wife requests this Court to take notice of the post-judicial fact that Regions\nBank paid Wife $885,860, and paid Husband the remainder of funds in the account,\n$217,621.43. In its findings of fact and conclusions of law contained in its April 16, 2009\norder, the Trial Court valued the Regions Bank CD at $1,050,000. However, in Exhibit 1,\nincorporated into the Trial Court’s order by reference, the Trial Court valued the Regions\nBank CD at $1,085,000. Exhibit 2, incorporated into the order by reference, shows that the\nTrial Court distributed the Regions Bank CD by awarding $885,860 to Wife and $229,450\nto Husband. When added together, the award of $885,860 to Wife and the award of\n$229,450 to Husband total $1,115,310.\n\n              Clearly, the amount of money in the Regions Bank CD both at the time the\nTrial Court valued it and at the time of distribution was different from the values stated in\nthe Trial Court’s order. The end result as to that asset is that while Wife received the full\n$885,860 specifically awarded to her, Husband received less than the $229,450 awarded to\nhim. We are puzzled as to why Wife, rather than Husband, requests we take notice of this\nfact, and Wife has not shown how this fact would be relevant to the issues raised on appeal.\nIn the exercise of our discretion we deny Wife’s motion.\n\n               Finally, each party has more than sufficient assets to pay his or her own\nattorney. In the exercise of our discretion, we decline to award attorney’s fees on appeal to\neither party.\n\n\n\n                                            -30-\n\f                                       Conclusion\n\n              The portion of the judgment of the Trial Court awarding alimony in futuro is\nvacated. The portion of the judgment awarding transitional alimony and attorney’s fees is\nmodified such that Husband shall pay Wife $6,600 per month as transitional alimony for six\nyears, and Husband shall be responsible only for the $10,000 in Wife’s attorney’s fees which\nHusband already has paid. The remainder of the Trial Court’s judgment is affirmed, and this\ncause is remanded to the Trial Court for collection of the costs below. The costs on appeal\nare assessed one-half against the appellant, Masoud Bajestani, and his surety, and one-half\nagainst the appellee, Maryam Ghorashi-Bajastani.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   _________________________________\n                                                   D.
