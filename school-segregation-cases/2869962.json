Both have\nappealed alleging numerous trial and sentencing errors.\nThe government has also filed a cross-appeal challenging\nWeston's sentence based upon the district court's\ncalculation of Weston's Base Offense Level.\n\n                               2\n\fFor the reasons that follow, we will affirm the convictions\nof both defendants on all counts of the indictment, and we\nwill also affirm Boone's sentence. However, for reasons set\nforth below, we will vacate Weston's sentence and remand\nfor re-sentencing consistent with this opinion.\n\nI. FACTS\n\nThomas Weston manufactured crack cocaine and enlisted\nnumerous persons to distribute large quantities of crack\nand powder cocaine in Asbury Park, New Jersey between\n1995 and 1998. The evidence at trial established that\nWeston purchased 3 to 5 kilograms of cocaine powder from\na wholesale distributer in New York City. He converted\ncocaine powder into crack cocaine, delivered cocaine to a\ncoterie of street level dealers for distribution in Asbury\nPark, and personally \"cooked\" at least 200 grams of cocaine\npowder into crack cocaine.\n\nWeston solicited Stewart Mills, a hot dog vendor in\nAsbury Park, to sell crack cocaine for him. However, Mills\nwas a reformed drug addict who was strongly opposed to\ndrug-dealing. Unbeknownst to Weston, Mills told local law\nenforcement officials about Weston's drug activities and\nagreed to broker controlled drug deals between Weston and\nundercover agents posing as drug buyers.\n\nWeston told Mills that crack should be sold at $900 an\nounce, and that Mills would have to sell a minimum of 4\nounces. Weston also gave Mills code words and numbers\nthat Mills was to use when communicating with Weston\nabout drug transactions. Weston eventually agreed to sell\nfour ounces of crack to a buyer whom Mills introduced as\na drug user named \"Malik.\" Malik was actually Gregory\nHilton, an undercover agent of the Drug Enforcement\nAgency. Mills and Weston agreed that the sale would occur\non July 11, 1997, in Howell, New Jersey, at a flea market\nknown as the \"Collingswood Auction.\"\n\nThereafter, Mills paged Weston from a public telephone\nas instructed by the DEA agents. He entered the number\n\"3600\" which represented the price (i.e. $3,600) that Agent\nHilton was willing to pay for 4 ounces of crack as Weston\nhad requested. Weston called Mills back and arranged a\n\n                               3\n\fmeeting at Weston's home in Asbury Park, and Mills and\nWeston then met to finalize the arrangements.\n\nWeston next contacted Curtis Farris (a/k/a \"C-Allah\")\nand offered him $500 to deliver the drugs to the buyer at\nthe Collingswood Auction. Farris agreed and told Weston\nthat he would have someone else make the actual delivery.\nFarris selected Larry Boone (a/k/a \"God Supreme\"). Boone\nhad sold cocaine for Farris before, and Farris knew that\nBoone and Mills were friendly.\n\nFarris offered Boone $100 and an eighth of an ounce of\ncocaine to deliver the package of cocaine to Collingswood\nAuction and collect the sales price. Boone agreed.\nMeanwhile, Weston partially reneged on his agreement with\nMills to provide four ounces of crack cocaine, and\nunilaterally substituted 111 grams (approximately four\nounces) of cocaine powder for delivery to Farris. On the\nafternoon of July 11, 1997, Farris drove Boone to the\nCollingswood Auction in a black Jeep. En route, Farris gave\nBoone a brown paper bag. That bag contained a smaller\nplastic bag containing 111 grams of powder cocaine that\nWeston had supplied.\n\nLaw enforcement officials who had set up surveillance at\nthe Collingswood Auction saw Weston and two other people\narrive 2:45 p.m. Farris and Boone arrived about ten\nminutes later. Boone approached Mills and said he was\n\"there to do the deal.\" Mills introduced Farris and Boone to\nAgent Hilton, posing as \"Malik.\" Hilton accompanied Boone\nto Farris' car as directed. Once inside the car, Boone took\na clear plastic bag from his jacket. The bag contained the\ndistinctive white cocaine powder. Agent Hilton never saw\nthe brown paper bag.\n\nAlthough Weston had set a price of $3,600, unbeknownst\nto Farris, Boone demanded $3,700 from Agent Hilton.\nHilton briefly complained about the increase but ultimately\npaid it as he did not want to compromise the investigation\nby walking away from the transaction. Hilton agreed and\nBoone handed him the plastic bag of cocaine which Agent\nHilton opened and examined in Boone's presence inside the\nJeep. After inspecting the cocaine in front of Boone, Hilton\nproduced $3,700 in cash which he counted in Boone's\n\n                               4\n\fpresence and handed to Boone so that Boone could recount\nit. After Hilton left the Jeep, Boone surreptitiously skimmed\n$100 from the $3,700 payment, and drove off followed by\nWeston who had driven another car to the flea market to\nobserve the transaction.1\n\nAbout a week later, Boone came to Mills' home. Boone\nannounced that he \"was back rolling,\" which meant that he\nwas selling cocaine again. He informed Mills that he (Boone)\nhad a \"connection\" and could get Mills all the\"weight\"\n(large quantities of cocaine) that Mills wanted. During that\nmeeting, Boone gave Mills his \"business card.\"\n\nSeveral weeks later, again acting at the request of DEA,\nMills brokered another sale of four ounces of cocaine from\nWeston to Agent Hilton posing as \"Malik.\" During a\nsurreptitiously recorded conversation on July 22, 1997,\nMills told Weston that Malik wanted to buy four ounces of\ncrack for $3,600 during the following week. Weston again\ngave Farris powder cocaine, rather than crack. However,\nFarris used Herbert Jones to make the delivery to Hilton\nbecause he could not find Boone. Jones made the delivery\non August 1, 1997. This time the transfer occurred in a\nrestaurant that Mills owned.\n\nMills again met Weston on October 4, 1997. The meeting\noccurred inside a bar, and during the meeting Mills (who\nwas equipped with a hidden recorder) asked Weston why he\nhad delivered powder cocaine on July 11 and August 1\nrather than the crack that Malik requested. Weston initially\nclaimed that he no longer \"cooked up crack.\" However,\nWeston then directed Mills out of the bar so they could\nspeak without being overheard. Using slang terms for\nmanufacturing crack (\"cooking,\" \"laying out,\" \"bringing\nback\"), Weston told Mills that he (Weston) would convert\nthe four ounces of cocaine that he most recently sold to\nMalik into four and one-half ounces of crack. Weston also\ntold Mills that he could provide Mills with additional crack\ncocaine if he wanted it. Later, Weston told Mills to pick up\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Surveillance officers captured the entire transaction on videotape, and\nHilton wore a hidden audio transmitter that allowed his conversation to\nbe recorded by the agents conducting surveillance.\n\n                                5\n\fsome powder cocaine, and bring it to Weston's home so\nthat Weston could \"cook it up.\"\n\nII. DISTRICT COURT PROCEEDINGS\n\nWeston, Boone and Jones were arrested by warrant and\ncomplaint on June 3, 1998. Farris was arrested on\nSeptember 11, 1998. On October 27, 1998, a federal grand\njury issued a superseding indictment charging Weston,\nBoone, Farris and Jones with conspiring to distribute, and\npossessing with intent to distribute, more than 5 grams of\ncocaine base (crack cocaine) and more than 200 grams of\ncocaine, contrary to 21 U.S.C. S 841(a)(1), in violation of 21\nU.S.C. S 846. The government also filed an enhanced\npenalty information against Weston, pursuant to 21 U.S.C.\nSS 841(b)(1)(B) and 851(a)(1). The requested enhancement\nwas based upon Weston's 1992 sentence of four years\nincarceration in Maryland for possession of 39 grams of\ncrack cocaine with intent to distribute.\n\nFarris entered into a plea agreement whereby he agreed\nto cooperate with the government and plead guilty to the\nsuperseding indictment. Jones also pleaded guilty. Boone\nand Weston proceeded to trial where the jury convicted\nthem of the charged conspiracy.\n\nPrior to sentencing, the Probation Office calculated\nWeston's Adjusted and Total Offense Level at 40. 2 In light of\nWeston's five criminal history points, and Criminal History\nCategory of III, Weston's Guidelines Range was 360 months\nto life imprisonment. Following three days of sentencing\nhearings, the district court reduced the Total Offense Level\nfrom 40 to 32.3 The court refused to consider any of the\ncrack cocaine that Weston cooked as \"relevant conduct\"\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. The Probation Office used the 1998 Sentencing Guidelines Manual for\nWeston and Boone.\n\n3. It is not clear from the briefs or the transcript of the proceedings\nwhy\nthe district court reduced the Total Offense Level to 32. The only\nrelevance that it may have for our purposes is the Apprendi claim that\nwe discuss below. However, as we discuss below, inasmuch as Weston\nis exposed to a life sentence because of a prior drug felony conviction,\nApprendi does not apply.\n\n                                 6\n\funder the Guidelines. This reduced the Guideline Range\ncalculated by the pre-sentence report by more than half.\nThe district court also reduced Weston's Criminal History\nCategory to II, resulting in a Guidelines Range of 135 to\n168 months. The district court then imposed a sentence of\n168 months and a term of supervised release of 8 years.\n\nBecause Boone had been convicted of two previous drug-\ntrafficking felonies in New Jersey state courts, as well as\naggravated assault with a deadly weapon, the district court\nfound that Boone was a \"career offender\" under the\nSentencing Guidelines. The court assigned Boone a Base\nOffense Level of 32, and a Criminal History Category of VI.\nThe court declined Boone's request for a three level\ndownward adjustment for \"acceptance of responsibility\"\npursuant to U.S.S.G. S 3E1.1, but the district court agreed\nthat the resulting Guidelines Range of 210 to 262 months\nwas too high. Therefore, the court granted Boone a three\nlevel downward departure, and imposed a custodial\nsentence of 151 months -- the bottom of the resulting\nsentencing range -- followed by a four-year term of\nsupervised release.\n\nWeston and Boone have filed appeals, at Nos. 99-5695\nand 99-5439 respectively. In Weston's case, the government\nhas filed a cross-appeal (No. 99-5894), based upon the\ndistrict court's failure to attribute any crack cocaine to\nWeston in calculating his applicable Offense Level. We will\nseparately discuss each defendant's appeal and the\ngovernment's cross-appeal.\n\nIII. WESTON'S APPEAL\n\nWeston's counsel has raised three claims of trial error. In\naddition, we have permitted Weston to file a pro se brief, in\nwhich he has raised three claims of sentencing error. Each\nassignment of error is discussed separately.\n\n1. The District Court Erred by Allowing Testimony\nRegarding Threats Against a Government Witness.\n\nIn his counseled brief, Weston argues that the district\ncourt improperly allowed the government to cross-examine\n\n                               7\n\ftwo defense witnesses regarding Weston's efforts to coerce\nFarris into providing false exculpatory testimony for\nWeston.\n\nAfter Weston was indicted, he tried to get Farris to sign\nan affidavit in which Farris was to swear that he did not\nknow Weston. When Farris returned to prison following his\nguilty plea, he found a letter in his cell.4 The letter\nthreatened harm to Farris and his family if Farris testified\nagainst Weston, and it instructed Farris to recopy a portion\nof the letter and sign it in his own handwriting. The portion\nof the letter that was to be recopied stated that Weston had\nnot committed the crimes he was charged with. Farris\nbelieved that the letter came from Weston. Farris did copy\na portion of the letter as requested, but he added a\nsentence in which he asked the reader to notify law\nenforcement if Farris was the victim of foul play. Farris\nthen threw away the original letter.\n\nFarris later spoke to Robert Perry, an inmate who worked\nin the prison library and was helping Weston prepare for\ntrial. Perry told Farris that he should hope for a long prison\nsentence, because otherwise \"somebody is going to kill\nyou.\" Farris responded by telling Perry that he would\nwithdraw his guilty plea and refuse to testify against\nWeston. Farris hoped that Perry would relay that message\nto Weston.\n\nShortly thereafter, Farris was summoned to the prison\nlibrary where he encountered Weston, Boone and Perry.\nWeston had Farris' letter and directed Farris to rewrite the\nletter omitting the reference to foul play. About one week\nlater, Farris was again summoned to the prison library\nwhere Boone demanded that Farris write a similar letter\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. According to the government, after Farris received the letter he asked\nanother inmate named Gavin if he had written the letter. Gavin denied\nhaving written the letter but warned Farris that he had better not\ncooperate with the government because Farris' life and Farris' family's\nlives will be in danger. Government's Br. at 15 n.5. Presumably, Gavin\nis the same person Weston calls Garrin. According to Weston, Garrin is\nthe only person who Farris actually identified as threatening him, but\nwho the government never directly associated with Weston. Weston's\nCounseled Br. at 7.\n\n                                8\n\fexonerating him (Boone). Farris was transferred to another\nprison after telling law enforcement authorities about the\nthreats. According to the government, Farris was terrified\nby these threats, and did not want to testify.\n\nAt trial, Weston denied ever threatening Farris, or ever\nseeing the letter that purported to exonerate Weston.\nWeston also testified that when he saw Farris in prison,\nFarris was surprised that Weston had been charged.\nAccording to Weston, Farris had suggested that Jones had\nimplicated Weston, and Farris volunteered to exonerate\nWeston.\n\nTo further contradict Farris' testimony about Weston's\nintimidation, Weston presented several inmates who had\nbeen incarcerated with Weston and/or Farris. Johnny\nDavenport testified on direct examination that at the time\nof trial he had been an inmate in the same prison as\nWeston. He had known Weston for 18 years and Farris for\n25 years. Davenport claimed that Farris admitted to him\nthat the government wanted Farris to \"lie on[Weston].\"\nDavenport further testified that Farris told him that Weston\nwas not involved in the drug conspiracy.\n\nOn cross-examination, Davenport testified, without\nobjection, that he was six feet tall, and weighed about 225\npounds. When the prosecutor asked Davenport whether he\nmade use of this time in jail by \"keeping in good shape,\"\nWeston's counsel objected to \"personal observations of the\nprosecutor.\" The objection was overruled. The prosecutor\nthen inquired, without objection, whether Davenport lifted\nweights in jail. Davenport claimed that he did not. Then,\nagain without objection, the prosecutor elicited testimony\nthat Davenport had been convicted of drug-trafficking\noffenses and assault.\n\nWeston also called Nard Henderson as a defense witness.\nHenderson testified on direct examination that he spoke to\nFarris while the two were in a holding cell at the Federal\nCourthouse in Trenton, New Jersey. According to\nHenderson, Farris told him Weston \"had nothing to do with\nit.\" Henderson also claimed that Farris \"was going to write\na letter, clearing [Weston].\" On cross-examination,\nHenderson testified without objection that he was six feet,\n\n                                9\n\ftwo and one-half inches tall, weighed 280 pounds, that he\nhad an extensive criminal record that included drug-\ntrafficking and resisting arrest, and that he was a\"career\noffender.\"\n\nWeston argues that the cross-examination of these\nwitnesses was an improper attempt to \"convey an image in\nthe minds of the jurors that Farris was continually living\nunder the threat of violent physical harm rendered by\nWeston's prison henchmen.\" Weston's Counseled Br. at 6-7.\nIn Weston's view, \"the harm visited upon [him], despite the\nincriminat[ing] evidence adduced below, mandates reversal\nby the Honorable Court.\" Id. at 7.\n\nAt the outset, we note that Weston's only objection to this\nline of cross-examination was that it exceeded the scope of\ndirect, and that the questions were based upon improper\nobservations by the prosecutor. Consequently, our scope of\nreview as to these issues is whether the district court\ncommitted plain error in allowing the testimony. United\nStates v. Saada, 212 F.3d 210, 224 (3d Cir. 2000). \"[W]e\nmay reverse only if we find error . . . so serious as to\nundermine the fundamental fairness of the trial and\ncontribute to a miscarriage of justice.\" United States v.\nTurcks, 41 F.3d 893, 897 (3d Cir. 1994)(citation omitted).\n\n       A plain error is clear or obvious. In most cases, an\n       error will be deemed to have affected substantial rights\n       where it is prejudicial. Prejudicial error, affecting\n       substantial rights, must have affected the outcome of\n       the District Court proceedings. The inquiry concerning\n       prejudice on plain error review is similar to our inquiry\n       into harmless error with the important difference that\n       the defendant, rather than the government, bears the\n       burden of persuasion in a plain error analysis.\n\nId. at 898 (citation and internal quotations omitted). Here\nWeston never even attempts to show how the disputed\ntestimony constitutes plain error. He merely claims that he\nwas harmed by the \"improper\" cross-examination. We do\nnot believe this testimony amounts to plain error, and he\nhas not met his burden of showing that it was plain error.5\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. We do not think the court erred in allowing this inquiry. However,\neven if we assume that the district court did err, the error clearly did\nnot\naffect the outcome of the trial because Farris, Perry, and Gavin (or\n\"Garrin\") also testified about Weston's threats.\n\n                                10\n\f2. The District Court Erred by Allowing\n       the Government to Cross-Examine Witnesses About\n       Weston's Prior Drug-Trafficking Activities.\n\nWeston's counsel also argues that the district court\nimproperly allowed the government to cross-examine two\nwitnesses about Weston's prior, uncharged drug-trafficking.\nWeston called Rayfield James as a character witness, and\nasked him about Weston's reputation in the community for\ntruthfulness and honesty. James replied that Weston is\n\"straightforward,\" and \"a man of his word.\" On cross-\nexamination, James testified, without objection, that \"with\nme, . . . [Weston had] a reputation for being law-abiding,\"\nand truthful. James also testified on cross-examination\nthat he was unaware that Weston had previously been\nconvicted of dealing crack cocaine, but that, even if he had\nbeen aware, it would not have changed his opinion of\nWeston's character.\n\nHowever, Weston objected when the government asked\nJames if he was aware that the nightclub Weston owned in\nAsbury Park had been the subject of a search warrant\nexecuted by narcotics agents. The objection was overruled\nand the district court immediately instructed the jury that\nthe question was permissible \"not for the truth of any such\nassertion but rather as it may affect the opinion of the\nwitness.\" James then testified that he was not aware of any\nsearch warrant and that even if he had been, it would not\nhave affected his opinion of Weston.\n\nWeston's counsel argues that allowing questions about\nWeston's prior conviction and the search of his night club\namounted to \"fatal error.\" According to counsel, \"[t]he\ninescapable conclusion is that the government knew of\nother narcotic activity on [Weston's] part that was not part\nof [his] trial\" and \"a juror could only be left with the\nthought that Weston was a continuing target for narcotics\nagents.\" Weston's Counseled Br. at 8. We disagree.6\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. We review for plain error those claims that were not preserved in the\ndistrict court, United States v. Saada, 212 F.3d 210, 224 (3d Cir. 2000),\nand for abuse of discretion for those claims that were preserved. United\nStates v. Davis, 183 F.3d 231, 256 (3d Cir. 1999).\n\n                               11\n\fThe Federal Rules of Evidence provide that:\n\n       In all cases in which evidence of character or a trait of\n       character of a person is admissible, proof may be made\n       by testimony as to reputation or by testimony in the\n       form of an opinion. On cross-examination, inquiry is\n       allowable into relevant specific instances of conduct.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 405(a)(italics added). Therefore, the\ngovernment could inquire about James's awareness of\nWeston's prior conviction and the execution of the search\nwarrant at Weston's night club once Weston put his\ncharacter in issue. See United States v. Scholl , 166 F.3d\n964, 974-75 (9th Cir. 1999)(approving cross-examination of\nopinion character witness by reference to defendant's\nspecific acts of misconduct). The district court has broad\ndiscretion regarding the cross-examination of character\nwitnesses, and the court did not abuse that discretion in\nallowing the government to challenge the character\ntestimony that Weston offered. United States v. Furst, 886\nF.2d 558, 578 (3d Cir. 1989).\n\nFurthermore, inasmuch as counsel did not object to\ninquiry into Weston's prior drug-trafficking conviction\nduring James' cross-examination, Weston again has the\nburden of establishing plain error.\n\nThe testimony regarding the search of Weston's night\nclub did not amount to plain error. For one thing, Mills\ntestified, without objection, that he had purchased drugs\nthere. Accordingly, we fail to see how inquiring into James'\nknowledge of a search of that night club could have\nprejudiced Weston; especially given the district court's\nprompt limiting instruction. See United States v. Curtis, 644\nF.2d 263, 269 (3d Cir. 1981)(no reversible error for\nimproper cross-examination of a reputation witness which\nelicited only information that had already been introduced\ninto evidence).\n\nSimilarly, Duval Moore testified on direct examination\nthat he and Farris were lifelong friends, and cell mates in\njail. Moore told the jury that Farris told him that Farris had\na deal that included falsely implicating Weston in the\ncharged drug offenses. On cross-examination, Moore\ncontinued to claim that Farris told him that the FBI\n\n                                12\n\finstructed Farris to lie about Weston. Moore also claimed\nthat Farris gave him a letter in which Farris stated that he\nwanted to withdraw his guilty plea because he knew he\nwould have to lie for the government. However, according to\nMoore, law enforcement officials refused to allow Farris to\nwithdraw his plea.\n\nThe government attacked Moore's credibility by eliciting\n(without objection) that Moore had several convictions for\ncocaine trafficking and violent crimes. Moore refused to\nidentify his suppliers during that line of questioning, and\nthe government responded by asking: \"isn't it a fact that\nyou distributed Thomas Weston's cocaine and you're\ncovering for him here?\" Moore denied that assertion and\nWeston's counsel stated he objected \"unless the prosecutor\nhas some proof of that.\" At a sidebar, the government then\nproffered that Farris had informed investigators that he\nonce delivered a package of cocaine from Weston to Moore\nfor subsequent distribution by Moore. Weston's counsel\nresponded with a motion for a mistrial, \"just for the record,\"\nwhich the court denied.\n\nWeston now argues that testimony was \"highly\ninflammatory, . . . meant to prejudice, and [constitutes]\nreversible error.\" However, at trial Weston did not object to\nthe inquiry because of its inflammatory or prejudicial\nnature. Rather, counsel argued that the question was not\npermissible unless the government had proof of the\nassertion. Accordingly, we once again review for plain error.\nGiven the context of the cross-examination, we conclude\nthat the district court did not commit any error in allowing\nthe inquiry -- let alone, plain error. Evidence that Moore\nand Weston had been drug dealing partners was relevant to\nMoore's possible bias in favor of Weston. See United States\nv. Abel, 469 U.S. 45, 52 (1984)(evidence regarding joint\nmembership of witness and defendant in criminal\norganization was properly admitted to establish possible\nbias of witness in favor of defendant). In addition, the jury\nwas properly instructed that answers, not questions,\nconstitute evidence, and Moore denied selling drugs for\nWeston.7\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. In explaining why this evidence did not violate the strictures of Rule\n404(b), we again emphasize the danger inherent in this kind of evidence.\n\n                               13\n\fMoreover, there was significant evidence of Weston's\ninvolvement in the drug trade. Mills testified that he saw\nWeston distribute drugs, that he purchased drugs from\nWeston, and that Weston solicited him to sell drugs. Farris\ntestified that he purchased drugs with Weston. Weston\nadmitted that he had previously manufactured crack\ncocaine, and Weston was captured on audiotape discussing\nthe charged conspiracy with Mills. Thus, the district court\ndid not err in allowing the limited inquiry into whether\nMoore once sold drugs for Weston to establish the\nrelationship between the two. See United States v. Godinez,\n114 F.3d 583, 588 (6th Cir. 1997)(no plain error for\nimproper question on cross-examination of defense witness\nabout whether defendant was involved in drug-dealing,\nwhere cooperating co-conspirators had previously testified\nextensively that defendant was the leader of a drug-\ntrafficking organization).\n\n3. The District Court Erred by Refusing\n       to Strike All References to Crack Cocaine.\n\nAt the close of the government's case, Weston moved to\nstrike \"any illusions to crack cocaine\" from the jury's\nconsideration. He argued that the government's evidence\nproved that Weston actually sold Agent Hilton cocaine\npowder, not crack cocaine. However, the district court\ndenied Weston's motion. Here, Weston's counsel argues\nthat \"injecting the specter of crack evokes the ire of any\njury,\" and is \"so inflammatory that the mere\nunsubstantiated allegation of involvement may be enough\nto convict.\" Weston's Counseled Br. at 10. He therefore\nasserts that the district court committed reversible error in\ndenying his motion.\n\nAs recited earlier, the superseding indictment charged\nthat Weston, Farris, Boone and Jones conspired to\ndistribute and to possess with intent to distribute more\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nSee United States v. Sampson, 980 F.2d 883,   886 (3d Cir. 1992)\n(\"Although the government will hardly admit   it, the reasons proffered to\nadmit prior bad act evidence . . . is often   mixed between an urge to show\nsome other consequential fact as well as to   impugn the defendant's\ncharacter.\").\n\n                               14\n\fthan 5 grams of crack cocaine and more than 200 grams of\ncocaine. Although the substance that Weston actually\ndelivered was cocaine powder, more than sufficient evidence\nwas introduced at trial to support the conviction for\nconspiring to manufacture and deliver crack cocaine. The\ngovernment produced testimony that Weston had, on two\noccasions, agreed to supply crack cocaine to agent Hilton,\nand Weston offered to personally convert the powder to\ncrack when Mills (the go-between) reminded Weston that\nHilton wanted crack.\n\nAt trial, Weston denied furnishing the cocaine that was\ndelivered to Hilton. However, the evidence certainly\nsupported the jury's conclusion that Weston was\nresponsible for that delivery. Weston's argument is really\nbottomed upon an implicit assertion that he cannot be\nconvicted of conspiring to distribute crack without evidence\nthat he actually delivered that substance as opposed to\npowder cocaine. However, one can certainly conspire to\ndeliver and distribute crack without the actual distribution\nor delivery if the charge has otherwise been proven beyond\na reasonable doubt. See United States v. DeSimone, 119\nF.3d 217, 223 (2d Cir. 1997). Consequently, the district\ncourt properly refused counsel's motion to strike\"any\nillusions to crack cocaine\" from the jury's consideration.8\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. The legal basis for counsel's motion is not clear. In the district\ncourt,\nhe relied upon Fed. R. Crim. P. 29. However, we do not believe that rule\ngives the district court the authority to strike evidence from the jury's\nconsideration. Rather, it authorizes the district court to \"order the\nentry\nof judgment of acquittal of one or more of the offenses charged in the\nindictment . . . after the evidence on either side is closed if the\nevidence\nis insufficient to sustain a conviction for such offense.\" Fed. R. Crim.\nP.\n29. On appeal, counsel does not cite to any specific authority. Rather, he\ncharacterizes his motion as one \"to strike crack cocaine from the\nindictment.\" Weston's Counseled Br. at 10. However, Weston never\nmentioned the indictment in his motion to strike in the district court and\nhe never mentioned Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(d), which governs requests to\nstrike allegations from an indictment. In any event, we have ignored the\nprocedural intricacies and reached the merits of the argument.\n\n                               15\n\f4. The PSR Erroneously Calculated the Amount of\n       Drugs Attributable to Weston.\n\nIn his pro se brief challenging his sentence, Weston\nargues that the district court erred at sentencing by\nattributing 5 kilograms of cocaine powder to him that he\npurchased in New York City.9 In Weston's view, only the\n220 grams of cocaine powder that he caused to be delivered\nto Agent Hilton during the two controlled buys identified in\nthe indictment can be attributed to him under the\nSentencing Guidelines.\n\nHowever, a sentence in a criminal conspiracy is based\nupon all relevant conduct and not merely offense conduct.\nSee United States v. Rivera-Maldonado, 194 F.3d 224, 228\n(7th Cir.) (Since defendant was convicted of conspiring to\ndistribute controlled substances, she is responsible for all\n\"drugs [she] personally handled or anticipated handling,\nand, under the relevant conduct rubric, for drugs involved\nin additional acts that were reasonably foreseeable by\n[her] and were committed in furtherance of the\nconspiracy.\")(citation omitted). The evidence here easily\nestablished that Weston's relevant conduct included the\npurchase and sale of approximately 5 kilograms of cocaine\npowder.\n\nWeston and Farris first met in the autumn of 1995 inside\nFarris' telephone pager store in Asbury Park. Weston had\nfour pagers set to a single telephone number which he used\nin dispatching his confederates to make cocaine sales. After\nWeston told Farris that he was unhappy with his cocaine\nsuppliers, Farris drove Weston to New York City to meet a\nman referred to as \"Poppy\", a Dominican from whom Farris\nhad been buying cocaine in lots of 200 to 700 grams. 10\n\nFarris introduced Weston to Poppy as a \"steady\", and\ndescribed Weston as a high volume cocaine buyer. Weston\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. \"When . . . construction of the Sentencing Guidelines is required on\nappeal, the standard of review is plenary.\" United States v. Greene, 212\nF.3d 758, 760 (3d Cir. 2000). Review of the district court's findings of\nfacts with regard to the sentence is clear error. United States v. Yeaman,\n194 F.3d 442, 456 (3d Cir. 1999).\n\n10. Farris diluted the cocaine and then sold the diluted product.\n\n                               16\n\fand Farris each gave Poppy $4,000 to purchase a total of\n400 grams of cocaine. Thereafter, on five or six occasions,\nWeston gave Farris cash in the average amount of $6,000\nto purchase additional cocaine from Poppy. Farris charged\nWeston 10 grams of cocaine (worth about $300) in return\nfor purchasing $6,000 to $7,000 of cocaine from Poppy. On\nthree or four other occasions, Weston bought cocaine from\nPoppy for Farris in amounts of up to $8,000, and charged\nFarris the same ten gram fee for that \"service.\" On six or\nseven other occasions, Weston went to Poppy and made\nunspecified purchases of his own.\n\nIn early 1996, Weston and Farris went together to New\nYork City, where each purchased between $6,000 and\n$8,000 of cocaine from Poppy. The evidence established\nthat Weston and Poppy appeared to be well acquainted with\neach other. Weston last used Farris to purchase cocaine\nfrom Poppy in late 1997 or early 1998. Farris' testimony\nestablished that Weston's bulk cocaine purchases from\nPoppy to Weston and/or Weston and Farris amounted to\nbetween 4.8 and 5.7 kilograms of cocaine. The Sentencing\nGuidelines provide that \"[t]ypes and quantities of drugs not\nspecified in the count of conviction may be considered in\ndetermining the offense level. See S 1B1.3(a)(2)(Relevant\nConduct).\" U.S.S.G. S 2D1.1, Application Note 12.\n\nRelevant Conduct for a drug trafficking conviction\nincludes not only all controlled substances involved\"during\nthe commission of the offense of conviction,\" but also those\nsubstances involved as \"part of the same course of conduct\nor common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\"\nU.S.S.G. S 1B1.1(a)(2). Consequently, all of Weston's drug-\ntrafficking that was part of the same course of conduct or\ncommon scheme must be included in the drug quantity,\nregardless of whether a particular transaction resulted in a\nconviction. See U.S.S.G. S 1B1.3, Application Note 3\n(application of S 1B1.3(a)(2) \"does not require the defendant,\nin fact, to have been convicted of multiple counts.\").\n\nWeston's multiple drug-trafficking offenses, including the\noffense of conviction, and his purchases from Poppy, were\npart of a \"common scheme or plan,\" because they were\n\"substantially connected to each other by at least one\ncommon factor, such as . . . common accomplices, . .. [or\n\n                                17\n\fa] common purpose.\" U.S.S.G. S 1B1.3, Application Note\n9(A). Weston and Farris were clearly accomplices in the\noffense of conviction and in their joint purchases of cocaine\npowder from Poppy. Farris introduced Weston to Poppy,\nidentified Weston as a reliable bulk purchaser of cocaine,\npurchased cocaine from Poppy for Weston, and gave\nWeston money to purchase cocaine from Poppy. Farris also\narranged for Boone and Jones to deliver Weston's cocaine\nin the charged conspiracy. Therefore, the district court\nproperly held Weston accountable for all the cocaine that\nhe purchased from Poppy; either alone or jointly with\nFarris.\n\nThe purchases from Poppy and the offense of conviction\nalso \"qualifi[ed] as part of the same course of conduct\n[because] they [were] sufficiently related or connected to\neach other as to warrant the conclusion that they were part\nof [an] . . . ongoing series of offenses.\" U.S.S.G. S 1B1.3,\nApplication Note 9(B). The conduct all occurred within the\nsmall geographic area in or near Asbury Park, involved\ncocaine that Weston sold through intermediaries, and it\ninvolved the same co-conspirators, i.e., Weston and Farris.\n\nAccordingly, we find no merit in Weston's claim that the\n5 kilograms of cocaine purchased in New York should not\nbe attributed to him under the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\n5. The District Court Erred by Crediting Farris'\n       Testimony on the Volume of Drugs Weston\n       Distributed.\n\nIn his pro se brief, Weston relies upon United States v.\nMiele, 989 F.2d 659 (3d Cir. 1993), in arguing that the\ndistrict court committed clear error by crediting Farris'\ntestimony regarding the volume of cocaine that he and\nWeston purchased from Poppy. Weston claims that Farris'\ntestimony was internally inconsistent.\n\nIn Miele, the district court's estimate of drug quantity\nrested upon the unsworn hearsay statement of an\ninformant. That informant later contradicted that estimate\nin sworn testimony he gave during the trial of Miele's co-\ndefendants. We found that the \"vast disparity between [the\ninformant's] estimate in the PSI and the significantly lower\n\n                               18\n\festimates he provided at the co-defendants' trial cast [ ]\ndoubt on the reliability of the PSI's estimate.\" Id. at 664.\nSince the district court never explained why it accepted the\ninformant's higher estimate in calculating the drug\nquantity, we remanded for resentencing. Id.\n\nHere, however, the district court based the volume of\ncocaine on Farris' sworn trial testimony, and the court\nconcluded that the testimony was reliable. The testimony\nremained unshaken after vigorous cross-examination.\nMoreover, the \"vast disparity\" in estimates of drug quantity\nthat we found so troubling in Miele is absent here. Farris'\ntestimony was neither speculative nor contradictory.\nWeston argues that Farris' testimony was contradictory\nbecause Farris first testified on direct that he and Weston\nfirst went to New York to buy cocaine from Poppy in 1995,\nbut then, on cross-examination, testified that the first trip\nwas in 1996. Although Farris did initially testify that the\nfirst trip was in 1995, he immediately corrected himself and\nexplained that it was in 1996. Moreover, even if he had not\ndone so, the resulting discrepancy would not have been\nanalogous to the discrepancies in Miele. Slight memory\nlapses hardly compel a sentencing court to completely\nreject testimony about drug quantity. This is particularly\ntrue where, as here, it was immediately corrected, and\ninvolves an issue that is not at all relevant to the substance\nof the testimony about drug quantity. See United States v.\nHuddleston, 194 F.3d 214, 224 (1st Cir. 1999)(rejecting\nargument that district court, in calculating the drug\namount, should not have relied on testimony of an\ninformant whose \"testimony regarding dates and times was\nfuzzy,\" because \"such credibility calls are grist for the trial\ncourt's mill.\"). Given Farris' familiarity with drug\ntransactions, his estimate of volume was appropriately\nconsidered by the district court. It is \"not unreasonable . . .\nto believe that the testimony of a man experienced in drug\ndeals was sufficient to establish an appropriate drug\nquantity.\" Id.\n\nWeston also alleges that Farris' testimony should not be\ncredited because of an inconsistency regarding the\nwholesale price of cocaine. Farris said that he paid $20 a\ngram for cocaine that he purchased from Poppy in New\n\n                                19\n\fYork in bulk. He also said that he and Weston paid Poppy\n$4,000 each for \"close to half a key [kilogram].\" Finally,\nFarris testified that he and Weston would charge each other\n$300 to pick up cocaine from Poppy, and ten grams of\ncocaine (i.e., $30 a gram) were accepted in payment.\n\nHowever, as the government points out, Farris' accounts\nare easily reconciled. At $20 a gram when bought in bulk,\n400 grams, costing $8,000, ($4,000 from Weston and\n$4,000 from Farris) is relatively \"close to half a key,\" i.e.,\n500 grams. Farris testimony that smaller quantities (i.e. 10\ngrams) cost more (i.e. $30 a gram) than bulk purchases\nsimply reflects the \"economies of scale\" that apparently\noperated in this illegal market.\n\nFinally, Weston complains that Farris' testimony should\nnot be credited because Farris did not give a dollar amount\nfor each of the quantities of cocaine that either he or\nWeston purchased from Poppy. Therefore, argues Weston,\nthe district court's estimate of the total volume of drugs\nwas clearly erroneous. We disagree. Farris recited particular\ndollar amounts for several of the purchases, estimated the\naverage amount of money spent during other transactions,\nand estimated the total number of transactions. This is\nsufficient to support the district court's estimate of the total\namount of cocaine that Weston and Farris bought from\nPoppy. See United States v. Grandados, 202 F.3d 1025,\n1029 (8th Cir. 2000)(not clear error for district court to\nestimate unknown quantities of drugs involved in certain\ntransactions by reference to known quantities involved in\nother, similar transactions).\n\n6. The District Court Erred by Enhancing Weston's\n       Sentence for Obstruction of Justice.\n\nSection 3C1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for\na two level enhancement if a defendant \"willfully obstructed\nor impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the\nadministration of justice.\" Examples of obstruction include:\n\"threatening, intimidating, or otherwise unlawfully\ninfluencing . . . a witness, or attempting to do so;\"\n\"suborning, or attempting to suborn perjury\"; and \"other\nconduct prohibited by the obstruction of justice provisions\n\n                               20\n\funder Title 18, United States Code.\" U.S.S.G.S 3C1.1,\nApplication Note 4(a).\n\nIn the Presentence Report, the Probation Office found\nthat Weston obstructed justice and recommended a two\nlevel enhancement under U.S.S.G. S 3C1.l. This was based\nupon the letter that Weston attempted to coerce Farris into\nsigning. PSR P 38. Weston objected, claiming that Farris'\naccount of the circumstances surrounding the purported\nletter were not credible. However, the district court\nobserved Farris' testimony and concluded otherwise. The\ncourt concluded \"this is one of the most clear and\nconvincing episodes of obstruction of justice that I have\nseen.\" The court found that it even rose to a level that\nexceeded the degree of obstruction encompassed within the\n\"heartland\" of S 3C1. It would have been difficult to\nconclude otherwise.\n\nIn his pro se brief, Weston challenges Farris' credibility\nby pointing to Farris' cross-examination testimony about a\ngold cadillac Weston purportedly owned. However, Weston's\nownership of a gold Cadillac has absolutely nothing to do\nwith his conviction. The district concluded that Farris\ntestified credibly about Weston's obstruction activity, and\nwe afford that finding deference. United States v. Igbonwa,\n120 F.3d 437, 440 (3d Cir. 1997). Given the credible\ntestimony that Weston directly and indirectly attempted to\ncoerce Farris into signing a copy of the aforementioned\nexculpatory letter, the district court did not err in\nconcluding that a two level enchantment for obstruction of\njustice was warranted.\n\nIV. THE GOVERNMENT'S CROSS-APPEAL\nIN WESTON'S CASE\n\nThe government argues that the district court erred in\nreducing Weston's Offense Level and Guidelines Range by\nignoring credible evidence that he manufactured and\ndistributed at least 200 grams of crack cocaine. The\ngovernment claims that Weston's Offense Level should be\nincreased at least to the level applicable to the 200 grams\nof crack cocaine that Weston manufactured on a single\noccasion.\n\n                               21\n\fThe government relies upon the crack that Weston\npersonally manufactured from the powder he and Farris\npurchased from Poppy in New York City. Earlier, we noted\nthat Weston and Farris bought cocaine powder in New York\nCity from Poppy for distribution in Asbury Park. Weston\ntold Farris that crack cocaine sold faster on the street than\ncocaine powder. Weston also told Farris that he (Weston)\npersonally manufactured crack from cocaine powder and\ncould produce 140 grams of crack from every 100 grams of\ncocaine powder used. After one of Farris' customers\ncomplained about some cocaine he had purchased from\nFarris, Farris went to Weston to ask if Weston could\nconvert cocaine powder into crack. When Farris\nencountered Weston, Weston was in the middle of\npreparing a batch of crack. Farris testified that he saw\n\"maybe a couple of hundred grams\" of powder cocaine on\na plate, and some baking soda. In Farris' presence, Weston\nplaced the mixture of cocaine powder and baking soda into\na pot of boiling water and held the pot over the stove. After\nthe water boiled off, the hard, off-white crack cocaine\nremained as a residue in the pot. Farris was very familiar\nwith the appearance of crack having ingested it in the past.\n\nOn another occasion, while Weston was selling Farris\ncocaine powder on the street, Weston dropped a clear\nplastic bag containing 7 to 10 grams of crack cocaine on\nthe ground.\n\nWeston also repeatedly solicited Mills to sell crack\ncocaine for him. He told Mills that Mills could multiply his\ndaily income from hot dog sales (about $150 a day) by ten\nor twenty times if he sold crack cocaine for Weston. Weston\nsaid that a street-level dealer for his drug-trafficking\norganization could earn at least $1,500 and as much as\n$3,000 a day in commissions from the sales of crack\ncocaine.\n\nWeston also told Mills that Weston could \"lay out\" or\ncook powder cocaine in order to transform it into\"rock\ncocaine,\" i.e., crack. Weston said he could convert an ounce\nof powder cocaine into an ounce and a half of crack. On\none occasion, Weston showed Mills some crack cocaine and\ntold Mills, \"this is the game you need to get into to make a\nlot more money.\"\n\n                               22\n\fMills sold hot dogs from a pushcart in front of a night\nclub called the \"Mishypoo.\" The club was frequented by\nnumerous crack dealers, including those working for\nWeston. The dealers would sell crack directly outside the\nnight club, in plain view of Mills. When the crack dealers\nwent inside the night club, they would occasionally ask\nMills to come into the bar and tell them when Weston\narrived so they could get their inventory from him. Mills\ntestified that Weston drove to the club two to three times a\nweek. When he arrived, he would summon the dealers to\nhis car. After a few minutes they would leave with packages\nof crack cocaine to sell.\n\nIn addition, Mills later brokered the two aforementioned\ncrack deals between Weston and Agent Hilton. During his\ndirect testimony, Weston admitted to previously\nmanufacturing crack, and being convicted for offenses\ninvolving crack in Maryland several years earlier. He\ntestified that it was common to refer to the manufacture of\ncrack using terms such as: \"cook\" cocaine,\"lay it out,\" and\n\"bring it back.\" He explained that the process requires\nboiling cocaine powder, baking soda and water together and\nthat if a large amount of baking soda was used, the amount\nof crack produced would exceed the amount of cocaine\npowder used. That is consistent with Mills' and Farris'\ntestimony about the crack Weston manufactured.\n\nThe PSR stated that the trial evidence established that\nWeston (personally or through Farris) obtained a minimum\nof 5 kilograms of powder cocaine from Poppy, the New York\nCity supplier. PSR P 31. According to the PSR, a\npreponderance of evidence established that Weston\nconverted most of the 5 kilograms of cocaine powder into\ncrack. Id. The gram weight of that crack was at least equal\nto the gram weight of the powder cocaine. Id. Accordingly,\nthe PSR recommended that Weston be held accountable for\nat least 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base. Id. The PSR thus\napplied a Base Offense level of 38 under U.S.S.G.\nS 2D1.1(c)(1).11 PSR PP 42-51.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11. The Drug Quantity Table requires its highest Offense Level of 38 if\nthe defendant is responsible for \"1.5 KG or more of `cocaine base.' \"\nU.S.S.G. S 2D1.1(c)(1).\n\n                               23\n\fWeston objected to that calculation, and claimed that he\nshould only be held accountable for the 220 grams of\npowder cocaine that was delivered to Agent Hilton. At the\nfirst of three sentencing hearings, Farris testified that,\nbased on his extensive experience as a seller of cocaine\npowder, he could accurately estimate the weight of a batch\nof cocaine powder from a visual inspection. After argument\nby the parties, the district court adopted the PSR's\ncalculation that Weston was responsible for at least 1.5\nkilograms of crack cocaine (and 5 kilograms of cocaine) and\nwas subject to a Total and Adjusted Offense Level of 40.\nThe hearing was then continued to another date to consider\nanother issue.\n\nAt the second sentencing hearing, Weston challenged the\ntrial testimony that he was an extensive crack dealer.\nHowever, the district court rejected Weston's challenge\nstating:\n\n       I presided over the trial and also over the [first]\n       sentencing hearing [at which Farris testified]. . . and I\n       was able to make determinations as to credibility. .. .\n       It seems to me that there's no reason to revisit my\n       prior ruling contrary to the defendant's position\n       [regarding the applicable drug type and amount].\n       Neither Mills nor Farris can be found incredible.\n       Rather, they -- I found them to be quite credible as to\n       the defendant's position himself that he was aware of\n       and knew how to prepare crack cocaine . . . . My prior\n       ruling will stand.\n\nEven though Weston was properly held responsible for at\nleast 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine (and therefore subject\nto an Adjusted Offense Level of 40 and a Guidelines Range\nof 325 to 405 months), Weston challenged the Adjusted\nOffense Level and Guidelines Range by continuing his\nattack on Farris' credibility. However, the district court\ncorrectly pointed out that, even without any of the crack\nthat Weston manufactured outside of Farris' presence,\nFarris saw Weston prepare approximately 200 grams of\ncrack on one occasion alone.12 Therefore, based only upon\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12. As recited earlier, Farris testified during the trial that he\npersonally\nobserved Weston convert a batch of \"maybe a couple of hundred grams\"\nof cocaine powder into crack.\n\n                               24\n\fthose 200 grams, Weston's base offense level would be 34,\npursuant to U.S.S.G. S 2D1.1(c)(3), i.e.,\"At least 150\nG[rams] but less than 500 G[rams] of Cocaine Base.\"13 The\ndistrict court then adjourned the sentencing hearing to the\nnext day in order to consider additional documents that\nWeston had submitted.\n\nAt the third sentencing hearing, the district court\nrepeated that it \"remained convinced of [Farris'] credibility.\"\nIt also noted that the evidence established that Farris saw\nWeston manufacturing \"a fairly substantial quantity\" of\ncrack on one occasion. The court noted that the evidence\nshowed that Weston was asked to manufacture crack\ncocaine on a number of occasions, and that Weston talked\nabout crack to Farris and Mills. Nonetheless, the district\ncourt concluded that the evidence failed to establish the\namount of crack cocaine attributable to Weston with\nsufficient precision. The court explained:\n\n       [t]he danger is that although [Weston] may be a\n       substantial crack dealer, we don't know how much\n       crack he was actually providing, and we want to be\n       careful not to go from a reasonable extrapolation into\n       the possibility of conjecture, especially where the\n       guidelines are so severe.\n\nAfter reiterating that Farris testified truthfully about\nWeston's drug-trafficking and that the government had\nproven that Weston was a \"substantial drug dealer,\" the\ndistrict court decided that it would give Weston the\"benefit\nof the doubt.\" Therefore, based on Farris' testimony about\nthe volume of cocaine powder he and Weston purchased in\nNew York City from Poppy, the court assigned between 3 to\n5 kilograms of powder cocaine to Weston. That attribution\nrested on a finding supported \"by clear and convincing\nevidence,\" and not merely by a preponderance of the\nevidence. It resulted in a base offense level of 30. U.S.S.G.\nS 2D1.1(c)(5). However, the district court continued to have\nconcerns about the amount of crack cocaine involved. The\ncourt noted:\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13. The Guidelines Drug Quantity Table states that \" `Cocaine base,' for\npurposes of this guideline, means `crack.' \" U.S.S.G. S 2D1.1(c)(1), Note\n(D).\n\n                               25\n\f       As far as cocaine base, we know that [Weston] was in\n       possession of some crack cocaine. In the testimony of\n       Farris we don't have a calculation of the precise\n       amount. Was it, as the government speculates, about\n       200 grams? Was it less? You can certainly safely say\n       that it was some amount. I think that's encompassed\n       in level 30 as well as far as the defendant's activities as\n       a crack cocaine dealer.\n\nThe government responded by reminding the district\ncourt that Farris watched Weston convert about 200 grams\nof cocaine powder into a like amount of crack on a single\noccasion. Therefore, argued the government, assuming a\none-to-one ratio, Farris' estimate of 200 grams of crack was\n50 grams (or 33%) more than the amount required for\napplication of a Base Offense Level of 34 under U.S.S.G.\nS 2D1.1(c)(3), i.e., at least 150 grams but less than 500\ngrams of crack. The district court noted that the\ngovernment's position was \"persuasive and reasonable.\"\nNevertheless, the court \"prefer[red] to base [its] ruling upon\nthe clear amount of powder cocaine which is here rather\nthan the extrapolation of the crack cocaine.\" The court then\nopined: \"as I say, I may well be wrong. I don't know. I may\nwell be too lenient, but we'll see whether people feel I'm too\nlenient when the time comes. I don't intend to be lenient.\"\nFinally, the district court restated its position that it was\nbasing its decision on drug quantities involved only on the\nbasis of the cocaine powder and not crack cocaine:\n\n       The government makes a very strong argument that we\n       should consider that there was 200 grams of cocaine\n       base when he was cooking it, and therefore, it should\n       be level 34. I say that is a reasonable position. I prefer\n       to base my ruling on the powdered cocaine level here,\n       but I do consider that, and I do consider [Weston's]\n       crack cocaine activities -- including that testimony\n       from Farris as to the substantial amounts of cocaine\n       and the testimony of Mills concerning crack cocaine\n       and [Weston's] own statements about the ability to\n       crack -- to cook crack cocaine.\n\nNot unexpectedly, the government argues that Weston's\nsentence must be vacated and the matter remanded so that\nthe district court can hold Weston responsible for at least\n\n                               26\n\fthe 200 grams of crack which Farris estimated he saw\nWeston manufacture.14 Therefore, the government argues\nthat Weston's Base Offense Level should be 34. U.S.S.G.\nS 2D1.1(c)(3) (\"At least 150 G but less than 500 G of\nCocaine Base.\").\n\nWe applaud the district court's caution and candor.\nHowever, under U.S.S.G. S 2D1.1, it is clear that the Base\nOffense Level for a drug-trafficking offense is a function of\nthe quantity of the drugs involved in the offense, see United\nStates v. Paulino, 996 F.2d 1541, 1543 (3d Cir. 1991), and\nthe Guidelines Application Notes require that \"the total\nquantity\" of drugs involved in the count of conviction and\nall relevant conduct \"shall be aggregated to determine the\nscale of the offense.\" U.S.S.G. S 2D1.1, Application Note 12\n(emphasis added). The Application Notes further requires\nthat \"[w]here there are multiple transactions or multiple\ndrug types, the quantities of drugs are to be added\" using\nthe drug equivalency tables. Id. Application Notes 6 and 10\n(\"In each case, convert each of the drugs to its marijuana\nequivalent, add the quantities, and look up the total in the\nDrug Quantity Table to obtain the combined offense level.\").\nSimilarly, the Guidelines Commentary provides that where\n\"there is no drug seizure or the amount seized does not\nreflect the scale of the offense, the sentencing judge shall\napproximate the quantity of the controlled substance.\"\nU.S.S.G. S 2D1.1, Application Note 12 (emphasis added).\nConsequently, the district court must \"determine the\namount and kind of controlled substance for which[the]\ndefendant should be held accountable -- and then .. .\nimpose a sentence that varies depending on the amount\nand kind.\" Edwards v. United States, 523 U.S. 511, 513-14\n(1998). We agree with the district court's concern that\n\"recognition of the need to estimate . . . is not a license to\ncalculate drug amounts by guesswork.\" United States v.\nPaulino, 996 F.2d at 1545. \"Instead, the sentencing court\nmust carefully scrutinize the government's proof to ensure\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n14. By focusing on the crack cocaine Farris saw Weston manufacture on\none occasion, we assume that the government has conceded that the\nevidence concerning Weston's manufacturing and/or distribution of any\nother crack cocaine is too imprecise to enable the sentencing court to\nproperly calculate drug amounts, other than by sheer speculation.\n\n                               27\n\fthat its estimates are supported by a preponderance of the\nevidence.\" Id.\n\nHowever, the district court's drug quantity calculation\nhere cannot stand. The district court never doubted Farris'\ncredibility. Evidence at the last sentencing hearing caused\nthe district court to expressly note that \"one time [Farris]\nsaw [Weston] cooking up a quantity of which was not\nmeasured but which he saw and looked like a fairly\nsubstantial quantity.\" Yet, the district court was concerned\nbecause Farris, though credible, was unable to state\"the\nprecise amount\" of crack that he saw Weston manufacture\non that one occasion.\n\nAs noted above, Farris' trial testimony established that he\nsaw Weston preparing crack cocaine from \"maybe a couple\nof hundred grams\" of powder cocaine and some baking\nsoda. Weston placed the mixture of cocaine powder and\nbaking soda into a pot of boiling water and held the pot\nover a stove. There is no doubt that Farris was sufficiently\nfamiliar with crack to be able to properly identify the\nresidue that Weston produced from the \"couple hundred\ngrams\" of powder on that one occasion. Moreover, Farris\ntestified at the first sentencing hearing that his experience\nas a cocaine dealer allowed him to accurately estimate the\nweight of a batch of cocaine powder based only upon a\nvisual inspection.\n\nThe government relies upon Farris' estimate of a couple\nhundred grams of powder on this one occasion, and the\ncredible testimony that he could accurately estimate the\nweight of a batch of cocaine powder. Weston stated that he\ncould produce at least an equivalent amount of crack from\na like amount of powder. Thus, argues the government,\nFarris' testimony is sufficient to establish that Weston\nmanufactured at least 200 grams of crack.\n\nThe district court explained its reluctance to factor those\n200 grams of crack into Weston's sentence as follows: \"In\nthe testimony of Farris we don't have a calculation of the\nprecise amount. Was it, as the government speculates,\nabout 200 grams? Was it less?\" Yet, the district court was\nconvinced that Weston \"was in possession of some crack\ncocaine,\" and appeared to be convinced that Weston \"may\n\n                                28\n\fbe a substantial crack dealer.\" Finding itself in a quandary,\nthe district court apparently sought middle ground by\nfinding that Weston was responsible for the powder cocaine\nand for \"some amount\" of crack, but found that the crack\nwas \"encompassed in level 30 as well as far as the\ndefendant's activities as a crack cocaine dealer.\"\n\nHowever, that conclusion was erroneous. Since the\ndistrict court found that Weston was responsible for\"some\namount\" of crack cocaine as well as powder, it was required\nto convert each controlled substance into a volume of\nmarijuana, pursuant to the Guidelines' \"Drug Equivalency\nTables,\" and then select the Offense Level that applied to\nthe aggregated quantity of marijuana. U.S.S.G. S 2D1.1,\nApplication Notes 6 and 10; see United States v. Brown, 36\nF.3d 655, 663 (7th Cir. 1994). The district court was\ntherefore required to consider all of the controlled\nsubstances, of whatever type, that Weston was responsible\nfor. Its failure to aggregate the drug types and quantities\nrequires us to vacate Weston's sentence and remand for\nresentencing.\n\nThe district court's conclusion that the crack was\nencompassed in the Base Offense Level of 30 is erroneous\nbecause it is tantamount to holding that Weston was not\nresponsible for any crack whatsoever. A Base Offense Level\nof 30 would be proper if the district court had found that\nWeston was responsible only for 3 to 5 kilograms of cocaine\npowder. U.S.S.G. S 2D1.1(c)(5)(\"At least 3.5 KG but less\nthan 5 KG of Cocaine.\"). However, once the district found\nWeston responsible for any amount of crack cocaine, it had\nto apply a Base Offense Level that would reflect that\nadditional quantity of that controlled substance.\n\nFor example, if we assume that Weston was responsible\nfor 5 kilograms of cocaine powder, that amount of cocaine\npowder would place him in Base Offense Level 30. Under\nthe Guideline's drug equivalency formula of 200 grams of\nmarijuana per gram of cocaine, the 5 kilograms of cocaine\nwould represent 1,000 kilograms of marijuana. U.S.S.G.\nS 2D1.1, Application Note 10, Drug Equivalent Tables. One\nthousand kilograms of marijuana is the ceiling for Base\nOffense Level 30. Consequently, any additional marijuana\nequivalents would require a higher base offense level.\n\n                               29\n\fTherefore, if the district court found that Weston was\nresponsible for 5 kilograms of cocaine powder and any\nmeasurable amount of crack cocaine -- which is equivalent\nto 20 kilograms of marijuana per gram -- it would have had\nto conclude that Weston was responsible for more than\n1,000 kilograms of marijuana and it should therefore have\napplied a Base Offense Level above 30.\n\nMoreover, even if we assume that Weston was responsible\nonly for the lowest amount of cocaine powder covered by\nLevel 30 (i.e., 3 kilograms), that quantity translates into a\nmarijuana equivalent of 700 kilograms. Thus, any amount\nof crack above 15 grams (the equivalent of 300 grams of\nmarijuana) would place Weston above the ceiling for level\n30 and require a higher level. The evidence here certainly\nestablishes that Weston was responsible for more than 15\ngrams of crack. Farris not only testified that he saw Weston\ntransform \"maybe a couple of hundred grams\" of cocaine\npowder into crack, but also testified about another occasion\nwhen he was buying cocaine powder from Weston on the\nstreet. During that encounter, Weston dropped a clear\nplastic bag containing 7 to 10 grams of crack on the\nground. Thus, Weston was clearly responsible for more\nthan 15 grams of crack.\n\nWe agree that it would be highly problematic to attempt\nto attribute all of the crack that was mentioned to Weston\nfor Guidelines purposes. That level of precision is not\nsupported by the generalized estimates on this record.\nHowever, we conclude that the court erred in not at least\nattributing the 200 grams that Farris saw Weston\nmanufacture. Given the totality of the evidence here, it is\nbeyond debate that Weston manufactured and/or\ndistributed, at least that much. We will therefore vacate\nWeston's sentence and remand for the district court to\nmake an appropriate determination of Weston's Base\nOffense Level in light of our discussion.15, 16\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n15. We take no position on the government's claim that on remand the\ndistrict court should resentence Weston using a Base Offense Level of\n34. The district court can best make that determination in the first\ninstance.\n\n16. In Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490 (2000), the Supreme\nCourt held that \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact\nthat\n\n                                30\n\fV. BOONE'S APPEAL\n\nBoone makes six arguments in his appeal. We consider\neach separately.\n\n1. The District Court Erred by Admitting Evidence of\n       Boone's Prior Drug-Trafficking.\n\nBoone's defense at trial was that even though he\naccepted $100 dollars to deliver a bag that happened to\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nincreases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory\nmaximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.\" Apprendi was not raised as an issue by Weston and was only\nbriefly alluded to at oral argument. However, in an over-abundance of\ncaution, we do think that a short discussion of Apprendi is warranted.\n\nThe superseding indictment charged Weston, Boone, Farris and Jones\nwith conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute more\nthan 5 grams of cocaine base (crack) and more than 200 grams of\ncocaine contrary to 21 U.S.C. S 841(a)(1) in violation of 21 U.S.C. S 846.\nAs noted above, the government filed an enhanced penalty information\nagainst Weston, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. SS 841(b)(1)(B) and 851(a)(1). That\ninformation referenced a 1992 state felony conviction for possession of\ncrack cocaine with intent to distribute, and Weston does not now\nchallenge that enhancement. As a consequence of his conviction, Weston\nfaces a possible statutory maximum penalty of life imprisonment. See 21\nU.S.C. S 841(b)(1)(B) (\"If any person commits such a violation [of S\n841(a)]\nafter a prior conviction for a felony drug offense has become final, such\nperson shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which may not be\nless than 10 years and not more than life imprisonment. . . .\").\n\nWe recently applied Apprendi, and reiterated the proposition that the\nlimitations of Apprendi do not apply unless the quantity calculation\nincreases the statutory maximum the defendant is exposed to. If it does,\nthe calculation must be submitted to the jury and established beyond a\nreasonable doubt. United States v. Vazquez, 271 F.3d 93, 98 (3d Cir.\n2001). Here, however, the district court's drug calculation on remand\ncannot possibly increase the statutory maximum. That maximum is\nalready set at life because of Weston's prior drug conviction. See United\nStates v. Cepero, 224 F.3d 256, 2676 n. 5 (3d Cir. 2000) (en banc)\n(Apprendi does not apply where application of Sentencing Guidelines\ndoes not implicate a fact that would increase the penalty beyond the\nstatutory maximum). See also United States v. Williams, 235 F.3d 858,\n862-863 (3d Cir. 2000)(Apprendi does not apply to a situation where the\ndistrict court decides a fact that increases a defendant's sentence under\nthe Guidelines, but the sentence imposed does not exceed the statutory\nmaximum).\n\n                               31\n\fcontain cocaine, he was an ignorant \"go-fer\" and did not\nknow what he delivered. To meet that defense, the district\ncourt permitted the government to admit evidence of\nBoone's prior drug-trafficking activities pursuant to Fed. R.\nEvid. 404(b). However, the court gave a limiting instruction\nin which it informed the jury that the evidence was being\nadmitted solely on the issue of Boone's knowledge of the\ncontents of the bag, and to demonstrate his prior\nrelationship with Farris and Mills. With that caution, the\ncourt admitted evidence that, on different occasions, Mills\nhad observed Boone selling cocaine inside of the nightclubs\nwhere Mills worked. The district court also admitted\nevidence that Boone sold cocaine supplied by Farris. In\naddition, even though the government also tried to admit\nBoone's two prior drug-trafficking convictions into evidence,\nthe district court limited the government to a stipulation\nthat Boone had previously twice possessed cocaine with the\nintent to deliver it. Boone argues that the district court\nabused its discretion in admitting this evidence.\n\nRule 404(b) provides in relevant part that: \"Evidence of\nother crimes, wrongs or acts . . . may . . . be admissible . . .\nfor [certain] purposes, such as motive, opportunity, intent,\npreparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of\nmistake or accident.\" (Emphasis added). Under Rule 404(b),17\nevidence of other criminal conduct is \"admissible whenever\nrelevant to a case other than [to show] the defendant's\ncriminal propensity.\" United States v. Sriyuth, 98 F.3d 739,\n745 (3d Cir. 1996). The prime inquiry is whether the\nevidence is probative of a material issue other than\ncharacter. Huddleston v. United States, 485 U.S. 681, 687\n(1988).\n\nThe prior crimes evidence was admitted to show that\nBoone was familiar with drug-trafficking practices and to\nestablish that his relationship with Farris and Mills\nincluded drug-trafficking. The evidence demonstrated his\n\"knowledge,\" \"intent\" and \"lack of mistake or accident.\" It\nwas properly admitted to rebut his defense of ignorance,\nand not to establish a propensity for criminal conduct.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n17. Admission of evidence under Rule 404(b) is reviewed for abuse of\ndiscretion. United States v. Balter, 91 F.3d 427, 436 (3d Cir. 1996).\n\n                               32\n\fBoone does not complain about the limiting instructions\nthe trial court gave. The court cautioned the jury when the\nevidence was admitted and again as part of the final jury\ninstructions, and those instructions were adequate to\naddress concerns that the evidence would be used for an\nimproper purpose.\n\nBoone argues that evidence of his prior drug-trafficking\noffenses established no \"logical inferences\" that he knew\nthe bag contained cocaine, as opposed to \"stolen jewelry, or\nplatinum dust.\" Boone's Br. at 9. However, that very\nargument illustrates the propriety of admitting evidence of\nBoone's prior drug involvement. The government correctly\nresponds that evidence of one's familiarity with the\nsubterfuge and concealment inherent in drug-trafficking\nwas relevant to the issue of whether Boone may have\nbelieved the bag contained contraband other than cocaine.\nSee United States v. Ferrer-Cruz, 899 F.2d 135, 138 (1st\nCir. 1990).18\n\nFinally, we conclude that evidence of Boone's prior drug-\ntrafficking was harmless in any event. Farris testified that\nhe asked Boone to deliver cocaine to Agent Hilton posing as\n\"Malik,\" and that Boone agreed. Hilton testified that he\nreceived the cocaine from Boone in a manner that was\ncharacteristic of clandestine drug transactions and that the\ncocaine was plainly visible to Boone. Mills then testified\nthat Boone acknowledged that he got involved because he\nwas then actively dealing drugs.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n18. In Ferrer-Cruz, the court stated:\n\n         Since one who has previous experience with drugs is . . . more\nlikely\n       to recognize (and hence to know) that the bags' contents were drugs\n       that one without such experience, the inference at issue do not\n       involve character. . . . Moreover, the probative value of the\nevidence\n       . . . is quite high. . . . [A] juror might have though that the\n       government failed to prove anything beyond [appellant's] presence\nin\n       a car with cocaine; and, believing that the government failed to\n       prove [appellant] knew it was cocaine or that he intended to\ndeliver\n       cocaine to the co-defendants, such a juror might have voted to\n       acquit. The evidence of a past conviction might have helped\n       convince a juror of guilt through its permissible suggestion that\n       [appellant] knew about drugs and drug possession.\n\n899 F.2d at 138.\n\f33\n\fBoone also challenges the district court's admission of\nMills' testimony that between 1984 and 1986, he observed\nBoone selling cocaine inside the restrooms of two\nnightclubs where Mills worked. In pressing this objection,\nhe concedes that the evidence was \"minimally relevant to\nknowledge.\" He claims, however, that its probative value\nwas outweighed by its prejudicial effect and it was therefore\ninadmissible under the balance required by Fed. R. Evid.\n403. Boone did not object to this testimony under Rule 403\nin the district court. We therefore again review for plain\nerror, but Boone does not argue plain error even now.\nRather, he spends a great deal of time arguing that Mills'\ntestimony was incredible or unreliable. That was clearly an\nissue for the jury to resolve, and it apparently did so in\nfavor of the government. Moreover, given Boone's\"innocent\ngo-fer\" defense, this evidence was proper under Rule 403.\n\n2. Sufficiency of the Evidence.\n\nBoone argues that evidence of his knowledge of the\ncontents of the package he delivered was insufficient to\nsustain his conviction. He insists that he \"never shared a\nunity of purpose with Farris, and that he never even spoke\nwith Weston during the time-frame of the charged\nconspiracy.\" He maintains that \"he was never told, and had\nno dependable basis to know, what was in the package he\ndelivered to Agent Hilton.\" Boone's Br. at 17. However,\nFarris' testimony by itself is sufficient to support Boone's\nconviction, and the jury apparently credited that testimony.\nFarris testified that he: (1) selected Boone to deliver the\ncocaine to Hilton because of Boone's long-standing ties to\nMills and Boone's prior drug dealing for Farris; (2) told\nBoone that he wanted him to deliver cocaine and offered\nBoone $100 and an eighth of an ounce of cocaine for the\njob; and (3) Boone took the cocaine and agreed to deliver it.\nSee United States v. Hernandez, 962 F.2d 1152, 1156 (5th\nCir. 1992)(uncorroborated testimony of cooperating co-\nconspirators that they had conspired to sell drugs, and that\nappellant knew of, joined, and helped effectuate the\nconspiracy, was sufficient to support conviction for violation\nof 21 U.S.C. S 846).\n\n                                  34\n\fNonetheless, Boone argues Farris' testimony is not\nsufficient because, according to Boone, on cross-\nexamination Farris \"clarified that he only told Boone he had\na deal for him, and there was no specific mention of drugs.\"\nBoone's Br. at 17. However, Boone mischaracterizes the\ntestimony Farris offered on cross-examination. When asked:\n\"what exactly did [he] say to Mr. Boone,\" Farris testified:\n\n       That I had something for him, a deal going in on a few\n       days and I asked him, did -- did he want to be a part\n       of it or something like that.\n\nFarris failed to offer a verbatim recitation of what he told\nBoone, even though he was asked for one. Farris related\nonly that he said \"something like that.\" Farris' testimony\nwas not an admission that he failed to tell Boone that the\npackage Boone delivered contained cocaine. Moreover, this\nargument again establishes the propriety of the\naforementioned 404(b) evidence. Assuming that Farris only\ndiscussed the delivery in vague terms such as \"doing a\n\"deal,\" it was important for the jury to understand Boone's\nfamiliarity with the kind of vagaries that could cloak\ndiscussions of a drug delivery.\n\nIn any event, the evidence was sufficient to sustain\nBoone's conviction regardless of any inconsistency in Farris'\ndirect and cross-examination testimony. A jury is free to\nbelieve part of a witness' testimony and disbelieve another\npart of it. United States v. Prince, 883 F.2d 953, 958 n.3\n(11th Cir. 1989). Thus, a witness' testimony is not\ninsufficient to establish a point simply because he or she\nlater contradicts or alters it. See United States v. Stirone,\n311 F.2d 277, 284 (3d Cir. 1963)(evidence was sufficient\neven though testimony of a government witness was to\nsome extent self-contradictory). Furthermore, we review the\nsufficiency of the evidence in the light most favorable to the\nverdict winner, and we credit all reasonable inferences that\nsupport the verdict. United States v. Riddick , 156 F.3d 505,\n508 (3d Cir. 1998). We will sustain the verdict if any\nrational trier of fact could have found the essential\nelements of the crimes beyond a reasonable doubt based\nupon the evidence viewed in that light. United States v.\nVoigt, 89 F.3d 1050, 1080 (3d Cir. 1996).\n\n                               35\n\fThe jury here could easily have credited Farris' direct\ntestimony that Boone agreed to deliver what he was told\nwas a package of cocaine, notwithstanding any purported\ninconsistency on cross-examination. Accordingly, we\nconclude that the evidence was sufficient to support\nBoone's conviction.\n\n3. The District Court Erred by Not Granting\n       a New Trial Based on the Government's Failure\n       to Disclose Brady Material.\n\nBoone claims that the government failed to disclose two\nitems of exculpatory information in violation of Brady v.\nMaryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) and its progeny, and he is\ntherefore entitled to a new trial.\n\nIn Brady v. Maryland, the Supreme Court held that\n\"suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an\naccused upon request violates due process where the\nevidence is material either to guilt or to punishment,\nirrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the\nprosecution.\" 373 U.S. at 87. The affirmative duty to\ndisclose includes impeachment evidence as well as\nexculpatory evidence. United States v. Bagley , 473 U.S.\n667, 676 (1985). In Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263 (1999),\nthe Court wrote:\n\n       [T]he term \"Brady violation\" is sometimes used to refer\n       to any breach of the broad obligation to disclose\n       exculpatory evidence--that is, to any suppression of\n       so-called \"Brady material\"--although, strictly speaking,\n       there is never a real \"Brady violation\" unless the\n       nondisclosure was so serious that there is a reasonable\n       probability that the suppressed evidence would have\n       produced a different verdict. There are three\n       components of a true Brady violation: The evidence at\n       issue must be favorable to the accused, either because\n       it is exculpatory, or because it is impeaching; that\n       evidence must have been suppressed by the State,\n       either willfully or inadvertently; and prejudice must\n       have ensued.\n\nId. at 281-82.\n\n                               36\n\fThe first claimed Brady violation is a statement of a\nconfidential informant. Boone first learned about this\nconfidential informant in the Presentence Report, which\nread, at P 9, as follows:\n\n       In early 1997, [law enforcement officials] received\n       information from a confidential source19 . . . that\n       several individuals, including THOMAS WESTON,\n       a/k/a Rasul; CURTIS FARRIS, a/k/a C-Allah; LARRY\n       BOONE, a/k/a God Supreme; and HERBERT JONES\n       were responsible for the distribution of significant\n       quantities of \"crack\" in the Asbury Park area.\n\nAfter he received a draft of the PSR, Boone, by letter dated\nMay 12, 1999, sought disclosure of information relating to\nthis informant. The government responded by informing\nBoone that the informant had stopped cooperating with the\nauthorities before Boone was released from state prison in\nearly 1997. In other words, the government conceded that\nthe representation in the PSR that the confidential\ninformant had provided information about Boone was\nerroneous.\n\nNonetheless, Boone claims this non-disclosure violated\ndue process. The argument is, however, somewhat difficult\nto follow. If the confidential informant made the statement\nabout Boone, it certainly would not be exculpatory or\nmaterial. On the contrary, if the statement was made it\nwould have been inculpatory and not subject to Brady\ndisclosure. In any event, Boone contends that if the PSR\nwas correct, i.e., had the confidential informant made an\ninculpatory statement about him, he (Boone) could have\ncalled the confidential informant as his own witness and\nestablished that the allegations were false. He claims he\n\"could have impeached the unknown informant and shown\nthat Boone had been falsely accused of being an early\ncoconspirator, which created a domino effect, causing Mills,\nFarris, and Agent Hilton to either lie or mold their stories\nto fit the framework of their target conspiracy.\" Boone's Br.\nat 19-20.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n19. Stewart Mills, who testified at trial, is identified as a second\nconfidential informant in P 9 of the PSR, and is not the same person\nidentified in this excerpt.\n\n                               37\n\fHowever, Boone fails to tell us how his new twist on the\n\"domino theory\" would have exculpated him. Moreover,\neven if we assume that Boone could have somehow shown\nthat the confidential informant had falsely implicated him,\nhe has not even attempted to establish that Mills, Farris\nand/or Hilton were even aware of the informant's\nstatement, or that they perjured themselves and conspired\nto \"mold their testimony\" to conform to it.\n\nAlternatively, Boone suggests that even if the government\nwas correct that the confidential informant's statement was\nwrong, the statement was actually exculpatory because he\ncould have used the statement to show the jury that he\ncould not have been a member of the Weston, Farris and\nJones drug conspiracy during the time he was in state\nprison. However, assuming arguendo that the statement\nwould be exculpatory as posited, Boone has not shown that\nit was material. The test for materiality is whether the\nfailure to disclose prejudiced the defendant, i.e., whether\nthe failure to disclose undermined confidence in the\noutcome of the trial. See Smith v. Holtz, 210 F.3d 186, 195-\n200 (3d Cir. 2000). The fact that Weston, Farris and Jones\nwere engaged in drug-trafficking prior to Boone's release\nfrom state prison does not negate Farris' testimony that he\nrecruited Boone after Boone's release from prison for the\nexpress purpose of delivering cocaine to Agent Hilton on\nJuly 11, 1997. In fact, it corroborates that testimony. Once\nBoone agreed to the July 11th transaction, he joined the\nconspiracy.\n\nThe second Brady violation Boone asserts involves a\nstatement co-defendant Jones made to a pre-sentence\ninvestigator after pleading guilty. Jones told the investigator\nthat Weston typically wrapped his drugs in brown paper\nbags. According to Boone, he could have used this\ninformation to show that the cocaine Farris received from\nWeston and gave to Boone was wrapped in a brown paper\nbag, thereby preventing Boone from knowing that cocaine\nwas inside. However, Boone did not need Jones' statement\nto establish this because Farris testified that the cocaine he\ndelivered to Boone was wrapped in a brown paper bag.\nThus, Jones' statement would have been cumulative and,\nconsequently, not material. See United States v. Burns, 162\n\n                               38\n\fF.3d 840, 851 (5th Cir. 1998)(non-disclosure of information\nthat supported the defense theory that fraudulent billing\nwas caused by untimely reimbursements by victim agency\nwas not material because it was merely cumulative of other\nevidence elicited by defense on this point). Moreover, Agent\nHilton testified that by the time Boone delivered the cocaine\nto him, it was in a clear plastic bag. Jones' statement does\nnot contradict that statement because the cocaine was\nwrapped in a clear plastic bag that was then placed in the\nbrown paper bag that was handed to Boone.\n\n4. The District Court Erred in Instructing\n       the Jury That It Could Consider Evidence That\n       Boone Attempted to Influence a Witness as\n       Indicative of Consciousness of Guilt.\n\nBoone argues that the court erred in instructing the jury\nthat evidence of the threatening letter Farris received\n(apparently from Weston, or at his direction) could be\nconsidered as consciousness of guilt. That evidence, which\nwe have set forth above, was admitted without objection,\nand Boone does not challenge its admission here. Boone\nobjected to the charge at trial, but was overruled. He does\nnot now argue that the charge did not accurately state the\nlaw. Rather, he argues that the district court's charge was\nunfair and inappropriate. First, he argues that it was unfair\nbecause it \"lump[ed] together\" Boone's and Weston's prison\ncontacts with Farris. Boone's Br. at 23. He argues this was\nunfair because Weston asked Farris to lie, but he (Boone)\nsimply asked Farris to tell the truth. That is, Boone\nmaintains that he asked Farris to \"truthfully\" state that\nBoone innocently accompanied Farris to the Collingwood\nAuction to ask Mills for a legitimate job, not knowing that\nFarris had solicited Boone to deliver cocaine. This argument\nagain misstates the trial testimony. Farris testified that he\nclearly and fully informed Boone that Boone was being\nhired to deliver cocaine. According to Farris, Boone did not\naccompany Farris to the Collingwood Auction to ask Mills\nfor a job.\n\nBoone's other arguments about the consciousness of\nguilt instruction are equally meritless. Boone claims that\nthe instruction was unwarranted because \"the government\n\n                                39\n\fplaced their witnesses among his co-defendants in[the jail]\n. . . and continuous banter went back and forth to and\nfrom Farris.\" Boone's Br. at 44. Although Boone's point\nhere is rather elusive, we assume (as does the government),\nthat Boone is suggesting that the government attempted to\nentrap Boone by creating an opportunity for him to discuss\nhis drug dealing in front of Farris after Farris agreed to\ncooperate. This is apparently based upon an argument that\nthe government intentionally failed to segregate Farris from\nBoone and Weston after Farris began cooperating. Boone\ndoes not offer any proof to support this claim, and we fail\nto see the legal basis for an \"entrapment\" claim even if\nBoone had such evidence. Therefore, this argument must\nfail.\n\nFinally, Boone claims that Farris, not Boone, initiated\ntheir discussion in the library regarding drafting an\nexculpatory letter. However, that argument misses the\npoint, and is also contradicted by Farris' testimony. The\nfact that the defense presented other prison inmates who\nclaimed that Farris admitted to them that Weston and\nBoone were not guilty of the charges only created a jury\nquestion regarding Farris' credibility. The court properly left\nthat question to the jury.\n\n5. The District Court Erred by Not Charging\n       That a Single Transaction Does Not Establish\n       Conspiracy Membership, or That a Member Can\n       Constructively Terminate His Membership.\n\nBoone argues that the district court improperly denied\nhis request for an instruction that his involvement in a\nsingle transaction did not prove that he was guilty of\nconspiracy. He relies upon our decision in United States v.\nPrice, 13 F.3d 711, 726-29 (3d Cir. 1994). There, we\nreversed a jury instruction that a defendant could be guilty\nof conspiring to distribute cocaine by offering to buy\ncocaine from a member of the conspiracy, even if the buyer\nhad no intention of reselling the cocaine. Here, however,\nBoone did not buy drugs; he delivered them. Thus, Price\ndoes not help him. In fact, the evidence clearly\ndemonstrated that Boone was brought into the conspiracy\nto deliver Weston's cocaine, collect the purchase price and\n\n                               40\n\fremit it to Farris. Boone was only to be paid if he delivered\nthe cocaine, and Weston and Farris would receive the\nmoney only if Boone delivered the cocaine and collected the\nsales price. This is sufficient to prove a conspiracy. See\nUnited States v. DiPasquale, 740 F.2d 1282, 1292 (3d Cir.\n1984). Accordingly, the district court properly denied the\nrequested instruction.\n\nMoreover, the evidence refutes Boone's claim that he was\nonly involved in one illegal act. Farris selected Boone to\ndeliver cocaine to \"Malik\" on July 11th because Boone had\npreviously delivered cocaine for Farris and because Boone\nwas friendly with Mills. Farris' subsequent attempt to use\nBoone for another delivery to \"Malik\" on August 1, was\nstymied only because Farris could not find Boone.\nMeanwhile, Boone was assuring Mills that he (Boone) could\nprovide Mills with large amounts of cocaine to sell. This\nevidence establishes Boone as a member of an ongoing\nconspiracy; not a one-time participant.\n\nThe district court instructed the jury that, after joining a\nconspiracy, a person may terminate his involvement only by\n\"an affirmative act of termination . . . withdrawal or\ndisassociation.\" Boone argued that he was entitled to a\n\"constructive termination\" instruction based on the\nargument that he constructively terminated his\nmembership in the conspiracy by participating in only one\ntransaction. He has presented no authority for that rather\nnovel proposition, and we are not aware of any. Rather, we\nbelieve the district court accurately stated the law. Boone\nwas required to make a prima facie showing of affirmative\nacts to defeat or disavow his membership in the conspiracy.\nSuch acts of disavowal include making a full confession to\nauthorities or renouncing the conspiracy to the co-\nconspirators. United States v. Antar, 53 F.3d 568, 582 (3d\nCir. 1995). The mere cessation of activity is insufficient to\nestablish withdrawal. Id. at 582. Boone did nothing to\nattempt to withdraw. Therefore, the district court did not\nerr in refusing to give the requested jury instruction.\n\n                                41\n\f6. The District Court Erred by Finding\n       that Boone Did Not Accept Responsibility\n       for his Crime.\n\nFinally, Boone claims that the district court committed\nclear error by finding that he did not \"accept responsibility\"\nfor his crimes and declining to reduce his Offense Level\npursuant to U.S.S.G. S 3E1.1. A defendant seeking a\nreduction for acceptance of responsibility bears the burden\nof establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that he\nor she is entitled to the reduction, and we review the\ndistrict court's denial of the reduction for clear error. United\nStates v. Muhammad, 146 F.3d 161, 167 (3d Cir. 1998).\nThe district court's denial of the reduction is entitled to\n\"great deference\" because \"[t]he sentencing judge is in a\nunique position to evaluate a defendant's acceptance of\nresponsibility.\" U.S.S.G. S 3E1.1, Application Note 5.\n\nBoone's claim of acceptance of responsibility is hard to\ntake seriously. It is based upon a statement he gave to\ninvestigators after he was arrested that he now argues was\n\"in all respects a complete confession.\" Boone's Br. at 28.\nAfter his arrest, Boone waived his Miranda rights and\nagreed to give a statement to investigators. In that\nstatement he claimed that, on July 11, 1997, Farris asked\nhim to do a favor and \"give this guy a package.\" Boone said\nhe agreed, and Farris drove Boone to the Collingwood\nAuction. Boone admitted that he delivered the package, and\nthat he skimmed $100 from the money that he received\nfrom \"Malik.\" He denied any knowledge of Farris' cocaine\nsupplier. Boone did not admit that he committed the\ncharged offenses, and he did not admit that he knew the\npackage contained cocaine. Given the evidence here, his\n\"cooperation\" is more a false exculpatory statement than an\nacceptance of responsibility. A defendant does not earn the\nacceptance of responsibility reduction simply by speaking\nto investigators. See United States v. DeLeon-Rodriquez, 70\nF.3d 764, 767 (3d Cir. 1995)(district court did not commit\nplain error by denying acceptance reduction where\nappellant's pre-trial statement to investigators stopped\nshort of a full confession). Continuing his game of\"cat and\nmouse,\" Boone argues that he did not admit that he knew\nthat the package contained drugs because he was not\n\n                               42\n\fspecifically asked by the investigators. However, we cannot\nhelp but cast a particularly jaundiced eye on that assertion\nbecause it strikes us as nothing more than a post-hoc\nfabrication to buttress his appeal.\n\nBoone would be hard pressed to demonstrate that he\naccepted responsibility even with his post-arrest statement.\nHe seeks the benefit of the portion of U.S.S.G.S 3E1.1\nApplication Note 2, that provides that \"where a defendant\ngoes to trial to assert and preserve issues that do not relate\nto factual guilt (e. g., to make a constitutional challenge to\na statute or a challenge to the applicability of a statute to\nhis conduct)\", a defendant may be entitled to the\nacceptance of responsibility reduction. That provision is of\nno avail here.\n\nInitially, Boone attempted to rely on the panel opinion in\nUnited States v. Singleton, 144 F.3d 1343 (10th Cir.\n1998)(Singleton I), which held that the government was\nbarred from making promises of leniency to cooperating\nwitnesses in exchange for their truthful testimony against\na defendant. Thus, he filed a pre-trial motion seeking to\nsuppress Mills' testimony based on Singleton I . He concedes\nthat his suppression motion was probably a dead letter by\nthe time of trial because the panel decision had been\nreversed by the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit en\nbanc. 165 F.3d 1297 (10th Cir.) (Singleton II).20 Nonetheless,\nhe claims that even though the Court of Appeals for the\nTenth Circuit repudiated Singleton I by the time of his trial,\nwe had not as yet addressed the issue.21 Thus, he argues\nthat he continued to fall under the exception explained in\nApplication Note 2.\n\nHowever, we are hard pressed to see how Boone could\nseriously argue for an acceptance of responsibility\nreduction. He opposed the admission of relevant,\ninculpatory evidence, and challenged as incredible the\ntestimony of government witnesses Mills, Farris and Agent\nHilton. We think the law is clear that such actions are\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n20. The Supreme Court later denied a petition for certiorari. 527 U.S.\n1024 (1999).\n\n21. When this appeal was argued we had decided United States v. Hunte,\n193 F.3d 173 (3d Cir. 1999) in which we rejected Singleton I.\n\n                               43\n\finconsistent with the \"acceptance of responsibility\"\nreduction in the Guidelines. United States v. DeLeon-\nRodriquez, 70 F.3d at 767 (acceptance of responsibility\nreduction properly denied because appellant challenged the\nadmission of and accuracy of the government's trial\nevidence, and argued for a verdict of not guilty).\n\nVI. CONCLUSION\n\nFor all of the above reasons, we will affirm Boone's\nsentence of judgment and conviction and will affirm\nWeston's conviction. However, we will vacate Weston's\nsentence and remand solely for the district court to\ndetermine his Base Offense Level consistent with our\nopinion.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                                44\n\f",

However, for reasons set\nforth below, we will vacate Weston's sentence and remand\nfor re-sentencing consistent with this opinion.\n\nI. FACTS\n\nThomas Weston manufactured crack cocaine and enlisted\nnumerous persons to distribute large quantities of crack\nand powder cocaine in Asbury Park, New Jersey between\n1995 and 1998. The evidence at trial established that\nWeston purchased 3 to 5 kilograms of cocaine powder from\na wholesale distributer in New York City. He converted\ncocaine powder into crack cocaine, delivered cocaine to a\ncoterie of street level dealers for distribution in Asbury\nPark, and personally \"cooked\" at least 200 grams of cocaine\npowder into crack cocaine.\n\nWeston solicited Stewart Mills, a hot dog vendor in\nAsbury Park, to sell crack cocaine for him. However, Mills\nwas a reformed drug addict who was strongly opposed to\ndrug-dealing. Unbeknownst to Weston, Mills told local law\nenforcement officials about Weston's drug activities and\nagreed to broker controlled drug deals between Weston and\nundercover agents posing as drug buyers.\n\nWeston told Mills that crack should be sold at $900 an\nounce, and that Mills would have to sell a minimum of 4\nounces. Weston also gave Mills code words and numbers\nthat Mills was to use when communicating with Weston\nabout drug transactions. Weston eventually agreed to sell\nfour ounces of crack to a buyer whom Mills introduced as\na drug user named \"Malik.\" Malik was actually Gregory\nHilton, an undercover agent of the Drug Enforcement\nAgency. Mills and Weston agreed that the sale would occur\non July 11, 1997, in Howell, New Jersey, at a flea market\nknown as the \"Collingswood Auction.\"\n\nThereafter, Mills paged Weston from a public telephone\nas instructed by the DEA agents. He entered the number\n\"3600\" which represented the price (i.e. $3,600) that Agent\nHilton was willing to pay for 4 ounces of crack as Weston\nhad requested. Weston called Mills back and arranged a\n\n                               3\n\fmeeting at Weston's home in Asbury Park, and Mills and\nWeston then met to finalize the arrangements.\n\nWeston next contacted Curtis Farris (a/k/a \"C-Allah\")\nand offered him $500 to deliver the drugs to the buyer at\nthe Collingswood Auction. Farris agreed and told Weston\nthat he would have someone else make the actual delivery.\nFarris selected Larry Boone (a/k/a \"God Supreme\"). Boone\nhad sold cocaine for Farris before, and Farris knew that\nBoone and Mills were friendly.\n\nFarris offered Boone $100 and an eighth of an ounce of\ncocaine to deliver the package of cocaine to Collingswood\nAuction and collect the sales price. Boone agreed.\nMeanwhile, Weston partially reneged on his agreement with\nMills to provide four ounces of crack cocaine, and\nunilaterally substituted 111 grams (approximately four\nounces) of cocaine powder for delivery to Farris. On the\nafternoon of July 11, 1997, Farris drove Boone to the\nCollingswood Auction in a black Jeep. En route, Farris gave\nBoone a brown paper bag. That bag contained a smaller\nplastic bag containing 111 grams of powder cocaine that\nWeston had supplied.\n\nLaw enforcement officials who had set up surveillance at\nthe Collingswood Auction saw Weston and two other people\narrive 2:45 p.m. Farris and Boone arrived about ten\nminutes later. Boone approached Mills and said he was\n\"there to do the deal.\" Mills introduced Farris and Boone to\nAgent Hilton, posing as \"Malik.\" Hilton accompanied Boone\nto Farris' car as directed. Once inside the car, Boone took\na clear plastic bag from his jacket. The bag contained the\ndistinctive white cocaine powder. Agent Hilton never saw\nthe brown paper bag.\n\nAlthough Weston had set a price of $3,600, unbeknownst\nto Farris, Boone demanded $3,700 from Agent Hilton.\nHilton briefly complained about the increase but ultimately\npaid it as he did not want to compromise the investigation\nby walking away from the transaction. Hilton agreed and\nBoone handed him the plastic bag of cocaine which Agent\nHilton opened and examined in Boone's presence inside the\nJeep. After inspecting the cocaine in front of Boone, Hilton\nproduced $3,700 in cash which he counted in Boone's\n\n                               4\n\fpresence and handed to Boone so that Boone could recount\nit. After Hilton left the Jeep, Boone surreptitiously skimmed\n$100 from the $3,700 payment, and drove off followed by\nWeston who had driven another car to the flea market to\nobserve the transaction.1\n\nAbout a week later, Boone came to Mills' home. Boone\nannounced that he \"was back rolling,\" which meant that he\nwas selling cocaine again. He informed Mills that he (Boone)\nhad a \"connection\" and could get Mills all the\"weight\"\n(large quantities of cocaine) that Mills wanted. During that\nmeeting, Boone gave Mills his \"business card.\"\n\nSeveral weeks later, again acting at the request of DEA,\nMills brokered another sale of four ounces of cocaine from\nWeston to Agent Hilton posing as \"Malik.\" During a\nsurreptitiously recorded conversation on July 22, 1997,\nMills told Weston that Malik wanted to buy four ounces of\ncrack for $3,600 during the following week. Weston again\ngave Farris powder cocaine, rather than crack. However,\nFarris used Herbert Jones to make the delivery to Hilton\nbecause he could not find Boone. Jones made the delivery\non August 1, 1997. This time the transfer occurred in a\nrestaurant that Mills owned.\n\nMills again met Weston on October 4, 1997. The meeting\noccurred inside a bar, and during the meeting Mills (who\nwas equipped with a hidden recorder) asked Weston why he\nhad delivered powder cocaine on July 11 and August 1\nrather than the crack that Malik requested. Weston initially\nclaimed that he no longer \"cooked up crack.\" However,\nWeston then directed Mills out of the bar so they could\nspeak without being overheard. Using slang terms for\nmanufacturing crack (\"cooking,\" \"laying out,\" \"bringing\nback\"), Weston told Mills that he (Weston) would convert\nthe four ounces of cocaine that he most recently sold to\nMalik into four and one-half ounces of crack. Weston also\ntold Mills that he could provide Mills with additional crack\ncocaine if he wanted it. Later, Weston told Mills to pick up\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Surveillance officers captured the entire transaction on videotape, and\nHilton wore a hidden audio transmitter that allowed his conversation to\nbe recorded by the agents conducting surveillance.\n\n                                5\n\fsome powder cocaine, and bring it to Weston's home so\nthat Weston could \"cook it up.\"\n\nII. DISTRICT COURT PROCEEDINGS\n\nWeston, Boone and Jones were arrested by warrant and\ncomplaint on June 3, 1998. Farris was arrested on\nSeptember 11, 1998. On October 27, 1998, a federal grand\njury issued a superseding indictment charging Weston,\nBoone, Farris and Jones with conspiring to distribute, and\npossessing with intent to distribute, more than 5 grams of\ncocaine base (crack cocaine) and more than 200 grams of\ncocaine, contrary to 21 U.S.C. S 841(a)(1), in violation of 21\nU.S.C. S 846. The government also filed an enhanced\npenalty information against Weston, pursuant to 21 U.S.C.\nSS 841(b)(1)(B) and 851(a)(1). The requested enhancement\nwas based upon Weston's 1992 sentence of four years\nincarceration in Maryland for possession of 39 grams of\ncrack cocaine with intent to distribute.\n\nFarris entered into a plea agreement whereby he agreed\nto cooperate with the government and plead guilty to the\nsuperseding indictment. Jones also pleaded guilty. Boone\nand Weston proceeded to trial where the jury convicted\nthem of the charged conspiracy.\n\nPrior to sentencing, the Probation Office calculated\nWeston's Adjusted and Total Offense Level at 40. 2 In light of\nWeston's five criminal history points, and Criminal History\nCategory of III, Weston's Guidelines Range was 360 months\nto life imprisonment. Following three days of sentencing\nhearings, the district court reduced the Total Offense Level\nfrom 40 to 32.3 The court refused to consider any of the\ncrack cocaine that Weston cooked as \"relevant conduct\"\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. The Probation Office used the 1998 Sentencing Guidelines Manual for\nWeston and Boone.\n\n3. It is not clear from the briefs or the transcript of the proceedings\nwhy\nthe district court reduced the Total Offense Level to 32. The only\nrelevance that it may have for our purposes is the Apprendi claim that\nwe discuss below. However, as we discuss below, inasmuch as Weston\nis exposed to a life sentence because of a prior drug felony conviction,\nApprendi does not apply.\n\n                                 6\n\funder the Guidelines. This reduced the Guideline Range\ncalculated by the pre-sentence report by more than half.\nThe district court also reduced Weston's Criminal History\nCategory to II, resulting in a Guidelines Range of 135 to\n168 months. The district court then imposed a sentence of\n168 months and a term of supervised release of 8 years.\n\nBecause Boone had been convicted of two previous drug-\ntrafficking felonies in New Jersey state courts, as well as\naggravated assault with a deadly weapon, the district court\nfound that Boone was a \"career offender\" under the\nSentencing Guidelines. The court assigned Boone a Base\nOffense Level of 32, and a Criminal History Category of VI.\nThe court declined Boone's request for a three level\ndownward adjustment for \"acceptance of responsibility\"\npursuant to U.S.S.G. S 3E1.1, but the district court agreed\nthat the resulting Guidelines Range of 210 to 262 months\nwas too high. Therefore, the court granted Boone a three\nlevel downward departure, and imposed a custodial\nsentence of 151 months -- the bottom of the resulting\nsentencing range -- followed by a four-year term of\nsupervised release.\n\nWeston and Boone have filed appeals, at Nos. 99-5695\nand 99-5439 respectively. In Weston's case, the government\nhas filed a cross-appeal (No. 99-5894), based upon the\ndistrict court's failure to attribute any crack cocaine to\nWeston in calculating his applicable Offense Level. We will\nseparately discuss each defendant's appeal and the\ngovernment's cross-appeal.\n\nIII. WESTON'S APPEAL\n\nWeston's counsel has raised three claims of trial error. In\naddition, we have permitted Weston to file a pro se brief, in\nwhich he has raised three claims of sentencing error. Each\nassignment of error is discussed separately.\n\n1. The District Court Erred by Allowing Testimony\nRegarding Threats Against a Government Witness.\n\nIn his counseled brief, Weston argues that the district\ncourt improperly allowed the government to cross-examine\n\n                               7\n\ftwo defense witnesses regarding Weston's efforts to coerce\nFarris into providing false exculpatory testimony for\nWeston.\n\nAfter Weston was indicted, he tried to get Farris to sign\nan affidavit in which Farris was to swear that he did not\nknow Weston. When Farris returned to prison following his\nguilty plea, he found a letter in his cell.4 The letter\nthreatened harm to Farris and his family if Farris testified\nagainst Weston, and it instructed Farris to recopy a portion\nof the letter and sign it in his own handwriting. The portion\nof the letter that was to be recopied stated that Weston had\nnot committed the crimes he was charged with. Farris\nbelieved that the letter came from Weston. Farris did copy\na portion of the letter as requested, but he added a\nsentence in which he asked the reader to notify law\nenforcement if Farris was the victim of foul play. Farris\nthen threw away the original letter.\n\nFarris later spoke to Robert Perry, an inmate who worked\nin the prison library and was helping Weston prepare for\ntrial. Perry told Farris that he should hope for a long prison\nsentence, because otherwise \"somebody is going to kill\nyou.\" Farris responded by telling Perry that he would\nwithdraw his guilty plea and refuse to testify against\nWeston. Farris hoped that Perry would relay that message\nto Weston.\n\nShortly thereafter, Farris was summoned to the prison\nlibrary where he encountered Weston, Boone and Perry.\nWeston had Farris' letter and directed Farris to rewrite the\nletter omitting the reference to foul play. About one week\nlater, Farris was again summoned to the prison library\nwhere Boone demanded that Farris write a similar letter\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. According to the government, after Farris received the letter he asked\nanother inmate named Gavin if he had written the letter. Gavin denied\nhaving written the letter but warned Farris that he had better not\ncooperate with the government because Farris' life and Farris' family's\nlives will be in danger. Government's Br. at 15 n.5. Presumably, Gavin\nis the same person Weston calls Garrin. According to Weston, Garrin is\nthe only person who Farris actually identified as threatening him, but\nwho the government never directly associated with Weston. Weston's\nCounseled Br. at 7.\n\n                                8\n\fexonerating him (Boone). Farris was transferred to another\nprison after telling law enforcement authorities about the\nthreats. According to the government, Farris was terrified\nby these threats, and did not want to testify.\n\nAt trial, Weston denied ever threatening Farris, or ever\nseeing the letter that purported to exonerate Weston.\nWeston also testified that when he saw Farris in prison,\nFarris was surprised that Weston had been charged.\nAccording to Weston, Farris had suggested that Jones had\nimplicated Weston, and Farris volunteered to exonerate\nWeston.\n\nTo further contradict Farris' testimony about Weston's\nintimidation, Weston presented several inmates who had\nbeen incarcerated with Weston and/or Farris. Johnny\nDavenport testified on direct examination that at the time\nof trial he had been an inmate in the same prison as\nWeston. He had known Weston for 18 years and Farris for\n25 years. Davenport claimed that Farris admitted to him\nthat the government wanted Farris to \"lie on[Weston].\"\nDavenport further testified that Farris told him that Weston\nwas not involved in the drug conspiracy.\n\nOn cross-examination, Davenport testified, without\nobjection, that he was six feet tall, and weighed about 225\npounds. When the prosecutor asked Davenport whether he\nmade use of this time in jail by \"keeping in good shape,\"\nWeston's counsel objected to \"personal observations of the\nprosecutor.\" The objection was overruled. The prosecutor\nthen inquired, without objection, whether Davenport lifted\nweights in jail. Davenport claimed that he did not. Then,\nagain without objection, the prosecutor elicited testimony\nthat Davenport had been convicted of drug-trafficking\noffenses and assault.\n\nWeston also called Nard Henderson as a defense witness.\nHenderson testified on direct examination that he spoke to\nFarris while the two were in a holding cell at the Federal\nCourthouse in Trenton, New Jersey. According to\nHenderson, Farris told him Weston \"had nothing to do with\nit.\" Henderson also claimed that Farris \"was going to write\na letter, clearing [Weston].\" On cross-examination,\nHenderson testified without objection that he was six feet,\n\n                                9\n\ftwo and one-half inches tall, weighed 280 pounds, that he\nhad an extensive criminal record that included drug-\ntrafficking and resisting arrest, and that he was a\"career\noffender.\"\n\nWeston argues that the cross-examination of these\nwitnesses was an improper attempt to \"convey an image in\nthe minds of the jurors that Farris was continually living\nunder the threat of violent physical harm rendered by\nWeston's prison henchmen.\" Weston's Counseled Br. at 6-7.\nIn Weston's view, \"the harm visited upon [him], despite the\nincriminat[ing] evidence adduced below, mandates reversal\nby the Honorable Court.\" Id. at 7.\n\nAt the outset, we note that Weston's only objection to this\nline of cross-examination was that it exceeded the scope of\ndirect, and that the questions were based upon improper\nobservations by the prosecutor. Consequently, our scope of\nreview as to these issues is whether the district court\ncommitted plain error in allowing the testimony. United\nStates v. Saada, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768678\"><a href=\"/opinion/768678/united-states-v-neil-saada-and-isaac-saada-aka-zuckie/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 224 (3d Cir. 2000). \"[W]e\nmay reverse only if we find error . . . so serious as to\nundermine the fundamental fairness of the trial and\ncontribute to a miscarriage of justice.\" United States v.\nTurcks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"683524\"><a href=\"/opinion/683524/united-states-v-arthur-turcks/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">893</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 897 (3d Cir. 1994)(citation omitted).\n\n       A plain error is clear or obvious. In most cases, an\n       error will be deemed to have affected substantial rights\n       where it is prejudicial. Prejudicial error, affecting\n       substantial rights, must have affected the outcome of\n       the District Court proceedings. The inquiry concerning\n       prejudice on plain error review is similar to our inquiry\n       into harmless error with the important difference that\n       the defendant, rather than the government, bears the\n       burden of persuasion in a plain error analysis.\n\nId. at 898 (citation and internal quotations omitted). Here\nWeston never even attempts to show how the disputed\ntestimony constitutes plain error. He merely claims that he\nwas harmed by the \"improper\" cross-examination. We do\nnot believe this testimony amounts to plain error, and he\nhas not met his burden of showing that it was plain error.5\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. We do not think the court erred in allowing this inquiry. However,\neven if we assume that the district court did err, the error clearly did\nnot\naffect the outcome of the trial because Farris, Perry, and Gavin (or\n\"Garrin\") also testified about Weston's threats.\n\n                                10\n\f2. The District Court Erred by Allowing\n       the Government to Cross-Examine Witnesses About\n       Weston's Prior Drug-Trafficking Activities.\n\nWeston's counsel also argues that the district court\nimproperly allowed the government to cross-examine two\nwitnesses about Weston's prior, uncharged drug-trafficking.\nWeston called Rayfield James as a character witness, and\nasked him about Weston's reputation in the community for\ntruthfulness and honesty. James replied that Weston is\n\"straightforward,\" and \"a man of his word.\" On cross-\nexamination, James testified, without objection, that \"with\nme, . . . [Weston had] a reputation for being law-abiding,\"\nand truthful. James also testified on cross-examination\nthat he was unaware that Weston had previously been\nconvicted of dealing crack cocaine, but that, even if he had\nbeen aware, it would not have changed his opinion of\nWeston's character.\n\nHowever, Weston objected when the government asked\nJames if he was aware that the nightclub Weston owned in\nAsbury Park had been the subject of a search warrant\nexecuted by narcotics agents. The objection was overruled\nand the district court immediately instructed the jury that\nthe question was permissible \"not for the truth of any such\nassertion but rather as it may affect the opinion of the\nwitness.\" James then testified that he was not aware of any\nsearch warrant and that even if he had been, it would not\nhave affected his opinion of Weston.\n\nWeston's counsel argues that allowing questions about\nWeston's prior conviction and the search of his night club\namounted to \"fatal error.\" According to counsel, \"[t]he\ninescapable conclusion is that the government knew of\nother narcotic activity on [Weston's] part that was not part\nof [his] trial\" and \"a juror could only be left with the\nthought that Weston was a continuing target for narcotics\nagents.\" Weston's Counseled Br. at 8.

Therefore, the\ngovernment could inquire about James's awareness of\nWeston's prior conviction and the execution of the search\nwarrant at Weston's night club once Weston put his\ncharacter in issue. See United States v. Scholl , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"761284\"><a href=\"/opinion/761284/united-states-v-william-l-scholl-united-states-of-america-v-william-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">964</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 974-75 (9th Cir. 1999)(approving cross-examination of\nopinion character witness by reference to defendant's\nspecific acts of misconduct). The district court has broad\ndiscretion regarding the cross-examination of character\nwitnesses, and the court did not abuse that discretion in\nallowing the government to challenge the character\ntestimony that Weston offered. United States v. Furst, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529953\"><a href=\"/opinion/529953/united-states-v-furst-sidney-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">886</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">558</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 578 (3d Cir. 1989).\n\nFurthermore, inasmuch as counsel did not object to\ninquiry into Weston's prior drug-trafficking conviction\nduring James' cross-examination, Weston again has the\nburden of establishing plain error.\n\nThe testimony regarding the search of Weston's night\nclub did not amount to plain error. For one thing, Mills\ntestified, without objection, that he had purchased drugs\nthere. Accordingly, we fail to see how inquiring into James'\nknowledge of a search of that night club could have\nprejudiced Weston; especially given the district court's\nprompt limiting instruction. See United States v. Curtis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"388330\"><a href=\"/opinion/388330/united-states-v-william-curtis-iii/\"><span class=\"volume\">644</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 269 (3d Cir. 1981)(no reversible error for\nimproper cross-examination of a reputation witness which\nelicited only information that had already been introduced\ninto evidence).\n\nSimilarly, Duval Moore testified on direct examination\nthat he and Farris were lifelong friends, and cell mates in\njail. Moore told the jury that Farris told him that Farris had\na deal that included falsely implicating Weston in the\ncharged drug offenses. On cross-examination, Moore\ncontinued to claim that Farris told him that the FBI\n\n                                12\n\finstructed Farris to lie about Weston. Moore also claimed\nthat Farris gave him a letter in which Farris stated that he\nwanted to withdraw his guilty plea because he knew he\nwould have to lie for the government. However, according to\nMoore, law enforcement officials refused to allow Farris to\nwithdraw his plea.\n\nThe government attacked Moore's credibility by eliciting\n(without objection) that Moore had several convictions for\ncocaine trafficking and violent crimes. Moore refused to\nidentify his suppliers during that line of questioning, and\nthe government responded by asking: \"isn't it a fact that\nyou distributed Thomas Weston's cocaine and you're\ncovering for him here?\" Moore denied that assertion and\nWeston's counsel stated he objected \"unless the prosecutor\nhas some proof of that.\" At a sidebar, the government then\nproffered that Farris had informed investigators that he\nonce delivered a package of cocaine from Weston to Moore\nfor subsequent distribution by Moore. Weston's counsel\nresponded with a motion for a mistrial, \"just for the record,\"\nwhich the court denied.\n\nWeston now argues that testimony was \"highly\ninflammatory, . . . meant to prejudice, and [constitutes]\nreversible error.\" However, at trial Weston did not object to\nthe inquiry because of its inflammatory or prejudicial\nnature. Rather, counsel argued that the question was not\npermissible unless the government had proof of the\nassertion. Accordingly, we once again review for plain error.\nGiven the context of the cross-examination, we conclude\nthat the district court did not commit any error in allowing\nthe inquiry -- let alone, plain error. Evidence that Moore\nand Weston had been drug dealing partners was relevant to\nMoore's possible bias in favor of Weston. See United States\nv. Abel, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111285\"><a href=\"/opinion/111285/united-states-v-abel/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 52 (1984)(evidence regarding joint\nmembership of witness and defendant in criminal\norganization was properly admitted to establish possible\nbias of witness in favor of defendant). In addition, the jury\nwas properly instructed that answers, not questions,\nconstitute evidence, and Moore denied selling drugs for\nWeston.7\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. In explaining why this evidence did not violate the strictures of Rule\n404(b), we again emphasize the danger inherent in this kind of evidence.\n\n                               13\n\fMoreover, there was significant evidence of Weston's\ninvolvement in the drug trade. Mills testified that he saw\nWeston distribute drugs, that he purchased drugs from\nWeston, and that Weston solicited him to sell drugs. Farris\ntestified that he purchased drugs with Weston. Weston\nadmitted that he had previously manufactured crack\ncocaine, and Weston was captured on audiotape discussing\nthe charged conspiracy with Mills. Thus, the district court\ndid not err in allowing the limited inquiry into whether\nMoore once sold drugs for Weston to establish the\nrelationship between the two. See United States v. Godinez,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741089\"><a href=\"/opinion/741089/united-states-v-enrique-godinez-96-1441-and-juvenal-godinez-96-1501/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">583</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 588 (6th Cir. 1997)(no plain error for\nimproper question on cross-examination of defense witness\nabout whether defendant was involved in drug-dealing,\nwhere cooperating co-conspirators had previously testified\nextensively that defendant was the leader of a drug-\ntrafficking organization).\n\n3. The District Court Erred by Refusing\n       to Strike All References to Crack Cocaine.\n\nAt the close of the government's case, Weston moved to\nstrike \"any illusions to crack cocaine\" from the jury's\nconsideration. He argued that the government's evidence\nproved that Weston actually sold Agent Hilton cocaine\npowder, not crack cocaine. However, the district court\ndenied Weston's motion. Here, Weston's counsel argues\nthat \"injecting the specter of crack evokes the ire of any\njury,\" and is \"so inflammatory that the mere\nunsubstantiated allegation of involvement may be enough\nto convict.\" Weston's Counseled Br. at 10. He therefore\nasserts that the district court committed reversible error in\ndenying his motion.\n\nAs recited earlier, the superseding indictment charged\nthat Weston, Farris, Boone and Jones conspired to\ndistribute and to possess with intent to distribute more\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nSee United States v. Sampson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596118\"><a href=\"/opinion/596118/united-states-v-harvey-sampson-and-rose-sampson-harvey-keith-sampson/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">883</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,   886 (3d Cir. 1992)\n(\"Although the government will hardly admit   it, the reasons proffered to\nadmit prior bad act evidence . . . is often   mixed between an urge to show\nsome other consequential fact as well as to   impugn the defendant's\ncharacter.\").\n\n                               14\n\fthan 5 grams of crack cocaine and more than 200 grams of\ncocaine. Although the substance that Weston actually\ndelivered was cocaine powder, more than sufficient evidence\nwas introduced at trial to support the conviction for\nconspiring to manufacture and deliver crack cocaine. The\ngovernment produced testimony that Weston had, on two\noccasions, agreed to supply crack cocaine to agent Hilton,\nand Weston offered to personally convert the powder to\ncrack when Mills (the go-between) reminded Weston that\nHilton wanted crack.\n\nAt trial, Weston denied furnishing the cocaine that was\ndelivered to Hilton. However, the evidence certainly\nsupported the jury's conclusion that Weston was\nresponsible for that delivery. Weston's argument is really\nbottomed upon an implicit assertion that he cannot be\nconvicted of conspiring to distribute crack without evidence\nthat he actually delivered that substance as opposed to\npowder cocaine. However, one can certainly conspire to\ndeliver and distribute crack without the actual distribution\nor delivery if the charge has otherwise been proven beyond\na reasonable doubt.

Consequently, the district\ncourt properly refused counsel's motion to strike\"any\nillusions to crack cocaine\" from the jury's consideration.8\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. The legal basis for counsel's motion is not clear. In the district\ncourt,\nhe relied upon Fed. R. Crim. P. 29. However, we do not believe that rule\ngives the district court the authority to strike evidence from the jury's\nconsideration. Rather, it authorizes the district court to \"order the\nentry\nof judgment of acquittal of one or more of the offenses charged in the\nindictment . . . after the evidence on either side is closed if the\nevidence\nis insufficient to sustain a conviction for such offense.\" Fed. R. Crim.\nP.\n29. On appeal, counsel does not cite to any specific authority. Rather, he\ncharacterizes his motion as one \"to strike crack cocaine from the\nindictment.\" Weston's Counseled Br. at 10. However, Weston never\nmentioned the indictment in his motion to strike in the district court and\nhe never mentioned Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(d), which governs requests to\nstrike allegations from an indictment. In any event, we have ignored the\nprocedural intricacies and reached the merits of the argument.\n\n                               15\n\f4. The PSR Erroneously Calculated the Amount of\n       Drugs Attributable to Weston.\n\nIn his pro se brief challenging his sentence, Weston\nargues that the district court erred at sentencing by\nattributing 5 kilograms of cocaine powder to him that he\npurchased in New York City.9 In Weston's view, only the\n220 grams of cocaine powder that he caused to be delivered\nto Agent Hilton during the two controlled buys identified in\nthe indictment can be attributed to him under the\nSentencing Guidelines.\n\nHowever, a sentence in a criminal conspiracy is based\nupon all relevant conduct and not merely offense conduct.\nSee United States v.

The evidence here easily\nestablished that Weston's relevant conduct included the\npurchase and sale of approximately 5 kilograms of cocaine\npowder.\n\nWeston and Farris first met in the autumn of 1995 inside\nFarris' telephone pager store in Asbury Park. Weston had\nfour pagers set to a single telephone number which he used\nin dispatching his confederates to make cocaine sales. After\nWeston told Farris that he was unhappy with his cocaine\nsuppliers, Farris drove Weston to New York City to meet a\nman referred to as \"Poppy\", a Dominican from whom Farris\nhad been buying cocaine in lots of 200 to 700 grams. 10\n\nFarris introduced Weston to Poppy as a \"steady\", and\ndescribed Weston as a high volume cocaine buyer.

Farris diluted the cocaine and then sold the diluted product.\n\n                               16\n\fand Farris each gave Poppy $4,000 to purchase a total of\n400 grams of cocaine. Thereafter, on five or six occasions,\nWeston gave Farris cash in the average amount of $6,000\nto purchase additional cocaine from Poppy. Farris charged\nWeston 10 grams of cocaine (worth about $300) in return\nfor purchasing $6,000 to $7,000 of cocaine from Poppy. On\nthree or four other occasions, Weston bought cocaine from\nPoppy for Farris in amounts of up to $8,000, and charged\nFarris the same ten gram fee for that \"service.\" On six or\nseven other occasions, Weston went to Poppy and made\nunspecified purchases of his own.\n\nIn early 1996, Weston and Farris went together to New\nYork City, where each purchased between $6,000 and\n$8,000 of cocaine from Poppy. The evidence established\nthat Weston and Poppy appeared to be well acquainted with\neach other. Weston last used Farris to purchase cocaine\nfrom Poppy in late 1997 or early 1998. Farris' testimony\nestablished that Weston's bulk cocaine purchases from\nPoppy to Weston and/or Weston and Farris amounted to\nbetween 4.8 and 5.7 kilograms of cocaine. The Sentencing\nGuidelines provide that \"[t]ypes and quantities of drugs not\nspecified in the count of conviction may be considered in\ndetermining the offense level. See S 1B1.3(a)(2)(Relevant\nConduct).\" U.S.S.G. S 2D1.1, Application Note 12.\n\nRelevant Conduct for a drug trafficking conviction\nincludes not only all controlled substances involved\"during\nthe commission of the offense of conviction,\" but also those\nsubstances involved as \"part of the same course of conduct\nor common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\"\nU.S.S.G. S 1B1.1(a)(2). Consequently, all of Weston's drug-\ntrafficking that was part of the same course of conduct or\ncommon scheme must be included in the drug quantity,\nregardless of whether a particular transaction resulted in a\nconviction. See U.S.S.G. S 1B1.3, Application Note 3\n(application of S 1B1.3(a)(2) \"does not require the defendant,\nin fact, to have been convicted of multiple counts.\").\n\nWeston's multiple drug-trafficking offenses, including the\noffense of conviction, and his purchases from Poppy, were\npart of a \"common scheme or plan,\" because they were\n\"substantially connected to each other by at least one\ncommon factor, such as . . . common accomplices, . .. [or\n\n                                17\n\fa] common purpose.\" U.S.S.G. S 1B1.3, Application Note\n9(A). Weston and Farris were clearly accomplices in the\noffense of conviction and in their joint purchases of cocaine\npowder from Poppy. Farris introduced Weston to Poppy,\nidentified Weston as a reliable bulk purchaser of cocaine,\npurchased cocaine from Poppy for Weston, and gave\nWeston money to purchase cocaine from Poppy. Farris also\narranged for Boone and Jones to deliver Weston's cocaine\nin the charged conspiracy. Therefore, the district court\nproperly held Weston accountable for all the cocaine that\nhe purchased from Poppy; either alone or jointly with\nFarris.\n\nThe purchases from Poppy and the offense of conviction\nalso \"qualifi[ed] as part of the same course of conduct\n[because] they [were] sufficiently related or connected to\neach other as to warrant the conclusion that they were part\nof [an] . . . ongoing series of offenses.\" U.S.S.G. S 1B1.3,\nApplication Note 9(B). The conduct all occurred within the\nsmall geographic area in or near Asbury Park, involved\ncocaine that Weston sold through intermediaries, and it\ninvolved the same co-conspirators, i.e., Weston and Farris.\n\nAccordingly, we find no merit in Weston's claim that the\n5 kilograms of cocaine purchased in New York should not\nbe attributed to him under the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\n5. The District Court Erred by Crediting Farris'\n       Testimony on the Volume of Drugs Weston\n       Distributed.\n\nIn his pro se brief, Weston relies upon United States v.\nMiele, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"603517\"><a href=\"/opinion/603517/united-states-v-anthony-m-miele-john-jay-mcelfresh-charles-j-walters/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">659</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1993), in arguing that the\ndistrict court committed clear error by crediting Farris'\ntestimony regarding the volume of cocaine that he and\nWeston purchased from Poppy. Weston claims that Farris'\ntestimony was internally inconsistent.\n\nIn Miele, the district court's estimate of drug quantity\nrested upon the unsworn hearsay statement of an\ninformant. That informant later contradicted that estimate\nin sworn testimony he gave during the trial of Miele's co-\ndefendants. We found that the \"vast disparity between [the\ninformant's] estimate in the PSI and the significantly lower\n\n                               18\n\festimates he provided at the co-defendants' trial cast [ ]\ndoubt on the reliability of the PSI's estimate.\" Id. at 664.\nSince the district court never explained why it accepted the\ninformant's higher estimate in calculating the drug\nquantity, we remanded for resentencing. Id.\n\nHere, however, the district court based the volume of\ncocaine on Farris' sworn trial testimony, and the court\nconcluded that the testimony was reliable. The testimony\nremained unshaken after vigorous cross-examination.\nMoreover, the \"vast disparity\" in estimates of drug quantity\nthat we found so troubling in Miele is absent here. Farris'\ntestimony was neither speculative nor contradictory.\nWeston argues that Farris' testimony was contradictory\nbecause Farris first testified on direct that he and Weston\nfirst went to New York to buy cocaine from Poppy in 1995,\nbut then, on cross-examination, testified that the first trip\nwas in 1996. Although Farris did initially testify that the\nfirst trip was in 1995, he immediately corrected himself and\nexplained that it was in 1996. Moreover, even if he had not\ndone so, the resulting discrepancy would not have been\nanalogous to the discrepancies in Miele. Slight memory\nlapses hardly compel a sentencing court to completely\nreject testimony about drug quantity. This is particularly\ntrue where, as here, it was immediately corrected, and\ninvolves an issue that is not at all relevant to the substance\nof the testimony about drug quantity. See United States v.\nHuddleston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766478\"><a href=\"/opinion/766478/united-states-v-mark-e-huddleston/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 224 (1st Cir. 1999)(rejecting\nargument that district court, in calculating the drug\namount, should not have relied on testimony of an\ninformant whose \"testimony regarding dates and times was\nfuzzy,\" because \"such credibility calls are grist for the trial\ncourt's mill.\"). Given Farris' familiarity with drug\ntransactions, his estimate of volume was appropriately\nconsidered by the district court. It is \"not unreasonable . . .\nto believe that the testimony of a man experienced in drug\ndeals was sufficient to establish an appropriate drug\nquantity.\" Id.\n\nWeston also alleges that Farris' testimony should not be\ncredited because of an inconsistency regarding the\nwholesale price of cocaine. Farris said that he paid $20 a\ngram for cocaine that he purchased from Poppy in New\n\n                                19\n\fYork in bulk. He also said that he and Weston paid Poppy\n$4,000 each for \"close to half a key [kilogram].\" Finally,\nFarris testified that he and Weston would charge each other\n$300 to pick up cocaine from Poppy, and ten grams of\ncocaine (i.e., $30 a gram) were accepted in payment.\n\nHowever, as the government points out, Farris' accounts\nare easily reconciled. At $20 a gram when bought in bulk,\n400 grams, costing $8,000, ($4,000 from Weston and\n$4,000 from Farris) is relatively \"close to half a key,\" i.e.,\n500 grams. Farris testimony that smaller quantities (i.e. 10\ngrams) cost more (i.e. $30 a gram) than bulk purchases\nsimply reflects the \"economies of scale\" that apparently\noperated in this illegal market.\n\nFinally, Weston complains that Farris' testimony should\nnot be credited because Farris did not give a dollar amount\nfor each of the quantities of cocaine that either he or\nWeston purchased from Poppy. Therefore, argues Weston,\nthe district court's estimate of the total volume of drugs\nwas clearly erroneous. We disagree. Farris recited particular\ndollar amounts for several of the purchases, estimated the\naverage amount of money spent during other transactions,\nand estimated the total number of transactions. This is\nsufficient to support the district court's estimate of the total\namount of cocaine that Weston and Farris bought from\nPoppy. See United States v. Grandados, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767542\"><a href=\"/opinion/767542/united-states-of-america-v-sergio-javier-granados/\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1025</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1029 (8th Cir. 2000)(not clear error for district court to\nestimate unknown quantities of drugs involved in certain\ntransactions by reference to known quantities involved in\nother, similar transactions).\n\n6. The District Court Erred by Enhancing Weston's\n       Sentence for Obstruction of Justice.\n\nSection 3C1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for\na two level enhancement if a defendant \"willfully obstructed\nor impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the\nadministration of justice.\" Examples of obstruction include:\n\"threatening, intimidating, or otherwise unlawfully\ninfluencing . . . a witness, or attempting to do so;\"\n\"suborning, or attempting to suborn perjury\"; and \"other\nconduct prohibited by the obstruction of justice provisions\n\n                               20\n\funder Title 18, United States Code.\" U.S.S.G.S 3C1.1,\nApplication Note 4(a).\n\nIn the Presentence Report, the Probation Office found\nthat Weston obstructed justice and recommended a two\nlevel enhancement under U.S.S.G. S 3C1.l. This was based\nupon the letter that Weston attempted to coerce Farris into\nsigning. PSR P 38. Weston objected, claiming that Farris'\naccount of the circumstances surrounding the purported\nletter were not credible. However, the district court\nobserved Farris' testimony and concluded otherwise. The\ncourt concluded \"this is one of the most clear and\nconvincing episodes of obstruction of justice that I have\nseen.\" The court found that it even rose to a level that\nexceeded the degree of obstruction encompassed within the\n\"heartland\" of S 3C1. It would have been difficult to\nconclude otherwise.\n\nIn his pro se brief, Weston challenges Farris' credibility\nby pointing to Farris' cross-examination testimony about a\ngold cadillac Weston purportedly owned. However, Weston's\nownership of a gold Cadillac has absolutely nothing to do\nwith his conviction. The district concluded that Farris\ntestified credibly about Weston's obstruction activity, and\nwe afford that finding deference. United States v. Igbonwa,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744493\"><a href=\"/opinion/744493/united-states-of-america-no-96-1848-v-franklin-uzo-igbonwa-aka/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">437</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 440 (3d Cir. 1997). Given the credible\ntestimony that Weston directly and indirectly attempted to\ncoerce Farris into signing a copy of the aforementioned\nexculpatory letter, the district court did not err in\nconcluding that a two level enchantment for obstruction of\njustice was warranted.\n\nIV. THE GOVERNMENT'S CROSS-APPEAL\nIN WESTON'S CASE\n\nThe government argues that the district court erred in\nreducing Weston's Offense Level and Guidelines Range by\nignoring credible evidence that he manufactured and\ndistributed at least 200 grams of crack cocaine. The\ngovernment claims that Weston's Offense Level should be\nincreased at least to the level applicable to the 200 grams\nof crack cocaine that Weston manufactured on a single\noccasion.\n\n                               21\n\fThe government relies upon the crack that Weston\npersonally manufactured from the powder he and Farris\npurchased from Poppy in New York City. Earlier, we noted\nthat Weston and Farris bought cocaine powder in New York\nCity from Poppy for distribution in Asbury Park. Weston\ntold Farris that crack cocaine sold faster on the street than\ncocaine powder. Weston also told Farris that he (Weston)\npersonally manufactured crack from cocaine powder and\ncould produce 140 grams of crack from every 100 grams of\ncocaine powder used. After one of Farris' customers\ncomplained about some cocaine he had purchased from\nFarris, Farris went to Weston to ask if Weston could\nconvert cocaine powder into crack. When Farris\nencountered Weston, Weston was in the middle of\npreparing a batch of crack. Farris testified that he saw\n\"maybe a couple of hundred grams\" of powder cocaine on\na plate, and some baking soda. In Farris' presence, Weston\nplaced the mixture of cocaine powder and baking soda into\na pot of boiling water and held the pot over the stove. After\nthe water boiled off, the hard, off-white crack cocaine\nremained as a residue in the pot. Farris was very familiar\nwith the appearance of crack having ingested it in the past.\n\nOn another occasion, while Weston was selling Farris\ncocaine powder on the street, Weston dropped a clear\nplastic bag containing 7 to 10 grams of crack cocaine on\nthe ground.\n\nWeston also repeatedly solicited Mills to sell crack\ncocaine for him. He told Mills that Mills could multiply his\ndaily income from hot dog sales (about $150 a day) by ten\nor twenty times if he sold crack cocaine for Weston. Weston\nsaid that a street-level dealer for his drug-trafficking\norganization could earn at least $1,500 and as much as\n$3,000 a day in commissions from the sales of crack\ncocaine.\n\nWeston also told Mills that Weston could \"lay out\" or\ncook powder cocaine in order to transform it into\"rock\ncocaine,\" i.e., crack. Weston said he could convert an ounce\nof powder cocaine into an ounce and a half of crack. On\none occasion, Weston showed Mills some crack cocaine and\ntold Mills, \"this is the game you need to get into to make a\nlot more money.\"\n\n                               22\n\fMills sold hot dogs from a pushcart in front of a night\nclub called the \"Mishypoo.\" The club was frequented by\nnumerous crack dealers, including those working for\nWeston. The dealers would sell crack directly outside the\nnight club, in plain view of Mills. When the crack dealers\nwent inside the night club, they would occasionally ask\nMills to come into the bar and tell them when Weston\narrived so they could get their inventory from him. Mills\ntestified that Weston drove to the club two to three times a\nweek. When he arrived, he would summon the dealers to\nhis car. After a few minutes they would leave with packages\nof crack cocaine to sell.\n\nIn addition, Mills later brokered the two aforementioned\ncrack deals between Weston and Agent Hilton. During his\ndirect testimony, Weston admitted to previously\nmanufacturing crack, and being convicted for offenses\ninvolving crack in Maryland several years earlier. He\ntestified that it was common to refer to the manufacture of\ncrack using terms such as: \"cook\" cocaine,\"lay it out,\" and\n\"bring it back.\" He explained that the process requires\nboiling cocaine powder, baking soda and water together and\nthat if a large amount of baking soda was used, the amount\nof crack produced would exceed the amount of cocaine\npowder used. That is consistent with Mills' and Farris'\ntestimony about the crack Weston manufactured.\n\nThe PSR stated that the trial evidence established that\nWeston (personally or through Farris) obtained a minimum\nof 5 kilograms of powder cocaine from Poppy, the New York\nCity supplier. PSR P 31. According to the PSR, a\npreponderance of evidence established that Weston\nconverted most of the 5 kilograms of cocaine powder into\ncrack. Id. The gram weight of that crack was at least equal\nto the gram weight of the powder cocaine. Id. Accordingly,\nthe PSR recommended that Weston be held accountable for\nat least 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base. Id. The PSR thus\napplied a Base Offense level of 38 under U.S.S.G.\nS 2D1.1(c)(1).11 PSR PP 42-51.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11. The Drug Quantity Table requires its highest Offense Level of 38 if\nthe defendant is responsible for \"1.5 KG or more of `cocaine base.' \"\nU.S.S.G. S 2D1.1(c)(1).\n\n                               23\n\fWeston objected to that calculation, and claimed that he\nshould only be held accountable for the 220 grams of\npowder cocaine that was delivered to Agent Hilton. At the\nfirst of three sentencing hearings, Farris testified that,\nbased on his extensive experience as a seller of cocaine\npowder, he could accurately estimate the weight of a batch\nof cocaine powder from a visual inspection. After argument\nby the parties, the district court adopted the PSR's\ncalculation that Weston was responsible for at least 1.5\nkilograms of crack cocaine (and 5 kilograms of cocaine) and\nwas subject to a Total and Adjusted Offense Level of 40.\nThe hearing was then continued to another date to consider\nanother issue.\n\nAt the second sentencing hearing, Weston challenged the\ntrial testimony that he was an extensive crack dealer.\nHowever, the district court rejected Weston's challenge\nstating:\n\n       I presided over the trial and also over the [first]\n       sentencing hearing [at which Farris testified]. . . and I\n       was able to make determinations as to credibility. .. .\n       It seems to me that there's no reason to revisit my\n       prior ruling contrary to the defendant's position\n       [regarding the applicable drug type and amount].\n       Neither Mills nor Farris can be found incredible.\n       Rather, they -- I found them to be quite credible as to\n       the defendant's position himself that he was aware of\n       and knew how to prepare crack cocaine . . . . My prior\n       ruling will stand.\n\nEven though Weston was properly held responsible for at\nleast 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine (and therefore subject\nto an Adjusted Offense Level of 40 and a Guidelines Range\nof 325 to 405 months), Weston challenged the Adjusted\nOffense Level and Guidelines Range by continuing his\nattack on Farris' credibility. However, the district court\ncorrectly pointed out that, even without any of the crack\nthat Weston manufactured outside of Farris' presence,\nFarris saw Weston prepare approximately 200 grams of\ncrack on one occasion alone.12 Therefore, based only upon\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12. As recited earlier, Farris testified during the trial that he\npersonally\nobserved Weston convert a batch of \"maybe a couple of hundred grams\"\nof cocaine powder into crack.\n\n                               24\n\fthose 200 grams, Weston's base offense level would be 34,\npursuant to U.S.S.G. S 2D1.1(c)(3), i.e.,\"At least 150\nG[rams] but less than 500 G[rams] of Cocaine Base.\"13 The\ndistrict court then adjourned the sentencing hearing to the\nnext day in order to consider additional documents that\nWeston had submitted.\n\nAt the third sentencing hearing, the district court\nrepeated that it \"remained convinced of [Farris'] credibility.\"\nIt also noted that the evidence established that Farris saw\nWeston manufacturing \"a fairly substantial quantity\" of\ncrack on one occasion. The court noted that the evidence\nshowed that Weston was asked to manufacture crack\ncocaine on a number of occasions, and that Weston talked\nabout crack to Farris and Mills. Nonetheless, the district\ncourt concluded that the evidence failed to establish the\namount of crack cocaine attributable to Weston with\nsufficient precision. The court explained:\n\n       [t]he danger is that although [Weston] may be a\n       substantial crack dealer, we don't know how much\n       crack he was actually providing, and we want to be\n       careful not to go from a reasonable extrapolation into\n       the possibility of conjecture, especially where the\n       guidelines are so severe.\n\nAfter reiterating that Farris testified truthfully about\nWeston's drug-trafficking and that the government had\nproven that Weston was a \"substantial drug dealer,\" the\ndistrict court decided that it would give Weston the\"benefit\nof the doubt.\" Therefore, based on Farris' testimony about\nthe volume of cocaine powder he and Weston purchased in\nNew York City from Poppy, the court assigned between 3 to\n5 kilograms of powder cocaine to Weston. That attribution\nrested on a finding supported \"by clear and convincing\nevidence,\" and not merely by a preponderance of the\nevidence. It resulted in a base offense level of 30. U.S.S.G.\nS 2D1.1(c)(5). However, the district court continued to have\nconcerns about the amount of crack cocaine involved. The\ncourt noted:\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13. The Guidelines Drug Quantity Table states that \" `Cocaine base,' for\npurposes of this guideline, means `crack.' \" U.S.S.G. S 2D1.1(c)(1), Note\n(D).\n\n                               25\n\f       As far as cocaine base, we know that [Weston] was in\n       possession of some crack cocaine. In the testimony of\n       Farris we don't have a calculation of the precise\n       amount. Was it, as the government speculates, about\n       200 grams? Was it less? You can certainly safely say\n       that it was some amount. I think that's encompassed\n       in level 30 as well as far as the defendant's activities as\n       a crack cocaine dealer.\n\nThe government responded by reminding the district\ncourt that Farris watched Weston convert about 200 grams\nof cocaine powder into a like amount of crack on a single\noccasion. Therefore, argued the government, assuming a\none-to-one ratio, Farris' estimate of 200 grams of crack was\n50 grams (or 33%) more than the amount required for\napplication of a Base Offense Level of 34 under U.S.S.G.\nS 2D1.1(c)(3), i.e., at least 150 grams but less than 500\ngrams of crack. The district court noted that the\ngovernment's position was \"persuasive and reasonable.\"\nNevertheless, the court \"prefer[red] to base [its] ruling upon\nthe clear amount of powder cocaine which is here rather\nthan the extrapolation of the crack cocaine.\" The court then\nopined: \"as I say, I may well be wrong. I don't know. I may\nwell be too lenient, but we'll see whether people feel I'm too\nlenient when the time comes. I don't intend to be lenient.\"\nFinally, the district court restated its position that it was\nbasing its decision on drug quantities involved only on the\nbasis of the cocaine powder and not crack cocaine:\n\n       The government makes a very strong argument that we\n       should consider that there was 200 grams of cocaine\n       base when he was cooking it, and therefore, it should\n       be level 34. I say that is a reasonable position. I prefer\n       to base my ruling on the powdered cocaine level here,\n       but I do consider that, and I do consider [Weston's]\n       crack cocaine activities -- including that testimony\n       from Farris as to the substantial amounts of cocaine\n       and the testimony of Mills concerning crack cocaine\n       and [Weston's] own statements about the ability to\n       crack -- to cook crack cocaine.\n\nNot unexpectedly, the government argues that Weston's\nsentence must be vacated and the matter remanded so that\nthe district court can hold Weston responsible for at least\n\n                               26\n\fthe 200 grams of crack which Farris estimated he saw\nWeston manufacture.14 Therefore, the government argues\nthat Weston's Base Offense Level should be 34. U.S.S.G.\nS 2D1.1(c)(3) (\"At least 150 G but less than 500 G of\nCocaine Base.\").\n\nWe applaud the district court's caution and candor.\nHowever, under U.S.S.G. S 2D1.1, it is clear that the Base\nOffense Level for a drug-trafficking offense is a function of\nthe quantity of the drugs involved in the offense, see United\nStates v.

We agree with the district court's concern that\n\"recognition of the need to estimate . . . is not a license to\ncalculate drug amounts by guesswork.\" United States v.\nPaulino, 996 F.2d at 1545. \"Instead, the sentencing court\nmust carefully scrutinize the government's proof to ensure\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n14. By focusing on the crack cocaine Farris saw Weston manufacture on\none occasion, we assume that the government has conceded that the\nevidence concerning Weston's manufacturing and/or distribution of any\nother crack cocaine is too imprecise to enable the sentencing court to\nproperly calculate drug amounts, other than by sheer speculation.\n\n                               27\n\fthat its estimates are supported by a preponderance of the\nevidence.\" Id.\n\nHowever, the district court's drug quantity calculation\nhere cannot stand. The district court never doubted Farris'\ncredibility. Evidence at the last sentencing hearing caused\nthe district court to expressly note that \"one time [Farris]\nsaw [Weston] cooking up a quantity of which was not\nmeasured but which he saw and looked like a fairly\nsubstantial quantity.\" Yet, the district court was concerned\nbecause Farris, though credible, was unable to state\"the\nprecise amount\" of crack that he saw Weston manufacture\non that one occasion.\n\nAs noted above, Farris' trial testimony established that he\nsaw Weston preparing crack cocaine from \"maybe a couple\nof hundred grams\" of powder cocaine and some baking\nsoda. Weston placed the mixture of cocaine powder and\nbaking soda into a pot of boiling water and held the pot\nover a stove. There is no doubt that Farris was sufficiently\nfamiliar with crack to be able to properly identify the\nresidue that Weston produced from the \"couple hundred\ngrams\" of powder on that one occasion. Moreover, Farris\ntestified at the first sentencing hearing that his experience\nas a cocaine dealer allowed him to accurately estimate the\nweight of a batch of cocaine powder based only upon a\nvisual inspection.\n\nThe government relies upon Farris' estimate of a couple\nhundred grams of powder on this one occasion, and the\ncredible testimony that he could accurately estimate the\nweight of a batch of cocaine powder. Weston stated that he\ncould produce at least an equivalent amount of crack from\na like amount of powder. Thus, argues the government,\nFarris' testimony is sufficient to establish that Weston\nmanufactured at least 200 grams of crack.\n\nThe district court explained its reluctance to factor those\n200 grams of crack into Weston's sentence as follows: \"In\nthe testimony of Farris we don't have a calculation of the\nprecise amount. Was it, as the government speculates,\nabout 200 grams? Was it less?\" Yet, the district court was\nconvinced that Weston \"was in possession of some crack\ncocaine,\" and appeared to be convinced that Weston \"may\n\n                                28\n\fbe a substantial crack dealer.\" Finding itself in a quandary,\nthe district court apparently sought middle ground by\nfinding that Weston was responsible for the powder cocaine\nand for \"some amount\" of crack, but found that the crack\nwas \"encompassed in level 30 as well as far as the\ndefendant's activities as a crack cocaine dealer.\"\n\nHowever, that conclusion was erroneous. Since the\ndistrict court found that Weston was responsible for\"some\namount\" of crack cocaine as well as powder, it was required\nto convert each controlled substance into a volume of\nmarijuana, pursuant to the Guidelines' \"Drug Equivalency\nTables,\" and then select the Offense Level that applied to\nthe aggregated quantity of marijuana. U.S.S.G. S 2D1.1,\nApplication Notes 6 and 10; see United States v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"678854\"><a href=\"/opinion/678854/united-states-v-cortez-c-guyton/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">655</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 663 (7th Cir. 1994). The district court was\ntherefore required to consider all of the controlled\nsubstances, of whatever type, that Weston was responsible\nfor. Its failure to aggregate the drug types and quantities\nrequires us to vacate Weston's sentence and remand for\nresentencing.\n\nThe district court's conclusion that the crack was\nencompassed in the Base Offense Level of 30 is erroneous\nbecause it is tantamount to holding that Weston was not\nresponsible for any crack whatsoever. A Base Offense Level\nof 30 would be proper if the district court had found that\nWeston was responsible only for 3 to 5 kilograms of cocaine\npowder. U.S.S.G. S 2D1.1(c)(5)(\"At least 3.5 KG but less\nthan 5 KG of Cocaine.\"). However, once the district found\nWeston responsible for any amount of crack cocaine, it had\nto apply a Base Offense Level that would reflect that\nadditional quantity of that controlled substance.\n\nFor example, if we assume that Weston was responsible\nfor 5 kilograms of cocaine powder, that amount of cocaine\npowder would place him in Base Offense Level 30. Under\nthe Guideline's drug equivalency formula of 200 grams of\nmarijuana per gram of cocaine, the 5 kilograms of cocaine\nwould represent 1,000 kilograms of marijuana. U.S.S.G.\nS 2D1.1, Application Note 10, Drug Equivalent Tables. One\nthousand kilograms of marijuana is the ceiling for Base\nOffense Level 30. Consequently, any additional marijuana\nequivalents would require a higher base offense level.\n\n                               29\n\fTherefore, if the district court found that Weston was\nresponsible for 5 kilograms of cocaine powder and any\nmeasurable amount of crack cocaine -- which is equivalent\nto 20 kilograms of marijuana per gram -- it would have had\nto conclude that Weston was responsible for more than\n1,000 kilograms of marijuana and it should therefore have\napplied a Base Offense Level above 30.\n\nMoreover, even if we assume that Weston was responsible\nonly for the lowest amount of cocaine powder covered by\nLevel 30 (i.e., 3 kilograms), that quantity translates into a\nmarijuana equivalent of 700 kilograms. Thus, any amount\nof crack above 15 grams (the equivalent of 300 grams of\nmarijuana) would place Weston above the ceiling for level\n30 and require a higher level. The evidence here certainly\nestablishes that Weston was responsible for more than 15\ngrams of crack. Farris not only testified that he saw Weston\ntransform \"maybe a couple of hundred grams\" of cocaine\npowder into crack, but also testified about another occasion\nwhen he was buying cocaine powder from Weston on the\nstreet. During that encounter, Weston dropped a clear\nplastic bag containing 7 to 10 grams of crack on the\nground. Thus, Weston was clearly responsible for more\nthan 15 grams of crack.\n\nWe agree that it would be highly problematic to attempt\nto attribute all of the crack that was mentioned to Weston\nfor Guidelines purposes. That level of precision is not\nsupported by the generalized estimates on this record.\nHowever, we conclude that the court erred in not at least\nattributing the 200 grams that Farris saw Weston\nmanufacture. Given the totality of the evidence here, it is\nbeyond debate that Weston manufactured and/or\ndistributed, at least that much. We will therefore vacate\nWeston's sentence and remand for the district court to\nmake an appropriate determination of Weston's Base\nOffense Level in light of our discussion.15, 16\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n15. We take no position on the government's claim that on remand the\ndistrict court should resentence Weston using a Base Offense Level of\n34. The district court can best make that determination in the first\ninstance.\n\n16. In Apprendi v.

BOONE'S APPEAL\n\nBoone makes six arguments in his appeal. We consider\neach separately.\n\n1.

However, in an over-abundance of\ncaution, we do think that a short discussion of Apprendi is warranted.\n\nThe superseding indictment charged Weston, Boone, Farris and Jones\nwith conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute more\nthan 5 grams of cocaine base (crack) and more than 200 grams of\ncocaine contrary to 21 U.S.C. S 841(a)(1) in violation of 21 U.S.C. S 846.\nAs noted above, the government filed an enhanced penalty information\nagainst Weston, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. SS 841(b)(1)(B) and 851(a)(1). That\ninformation referenced a 1992 state felony conviction for possession of\ncrack cocaine with intent to distribute, and Weston does not now\nchallenge that enhancement. As a consequence of his conviction, Weston\nfaces a possible statutory maximum penalty of life imprisonment. See 21\nU.S.C. S 841(b)(1)(B) (\"If any person commits such a violation [of S\n841(a)]\nafter a prior conviction for a felony drug offense has become final, such\nperson shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which may not be\nless than 10 years and not more than life imprisonment. . . .\").\n\nWe recently applied Apprendi, and reiterated the proposition that the\nlimitations of Apprendi do not apply unless the quantity calculation\nincreases the statutory maximum the defendant is exposed to. If it does,\nthe calculation must be submitted to the jury and established beyond a\nreasonable doubt. United States v.

To meet that defense, the district\ncourt permitted the government to admit evidence of\nBoone's prior drug-trafficking activities pursuant to Fed. R.\nEvid. 404(b). However, the court gave a limiting instruction\nin which it informed the jury that the evidence was being\nadmitted solely on the issue of Boone's knowledge of the\ncontents of the bag, and to demonstrate his prior\nrelationship with Farris and Mills. With that caution, the\ncourt admitted evidence that, on different occasions, Mills\nhad observed Boone selling cocaine inside of the nightclubs\nwhere Mills worked. The district court also admitted\nevidence that Boone sold cocaine supplied by Farris. In\naddition, even though the government also tried to admit\nBoone's two prior drug-trafficking convictions into evidence,\nthe district court limited the government to a stipulation\nthat Boone had previously twice possessed cocaine with the\nintent to deliver it. Boone argues that the district court\nabused its discretion in admitting this evidence.\n\nRule 404(b) provides in relevant part that: \"Evidence of\nother crimes, wrongs or acts . . . may . . . be admissible . . .\nfor [certain] purposes, such as motive, opportunity, intent,\npreparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of\nmistake or accident.\" (Emphasis added).

The court cautioned the jury when the\nevidence was admitted and again as part of the final jury\ninstructions, and those instructions were adequate to\naddress concerns that the evidence would be used for an\nimproper purpose.\n\nBoone argues that evidence of his prior drug-trafficking\noffenses established no \"logical inferences\" that he knew\nthe bag contained cocaine, as opposed to \"stolen jewelry, or\nplatinum dust.\" Boone's Br. at 9. However, that very\nargument illustrates the propriety of admitting evidence of\nBoone's prior drug involvement. The government correctly\nresponds that evidence of one's familiarity with the\nsubterfuge and concealment inherent in drug-trafficking\nwas relevant to the issue of whether Boone may have\nbelieved the bag contained contraband other than cocaine.\nSee United States v. Ferrer-Cruz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538800\"><a href=\"/opinion/538800/united-states-v-carlos-ferrer-cruz/\"><span class=\"volume\">899</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">135</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 138 (1st\nCir. 1990).18\n\nFinally, we conclude that evidence of Boone's prior drug-\ntrafficking was harmless in any event. Farris testified that\nhe asked Boone to deliver cocaine to Agent Hilton posing as\n\"Malik,\" and that Boone agreed. Hilton testified that he\nreceived the cocaine from Boone in a manner that was\ncharacteristic of clandestine drug transactions and that the\ncocaine was plainly visible to Boone. Mills then testified\nthat Boone acknowledged that he got involved because he\nwas then actively dealing drugs.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n18. In Ferrer-Cruz, the court stated:\n\n         Since one who has previous experience with drugs is . . . more\nlikely\n       to recognize (and hence to know) that the bags' contents were drugs\n       that one without such experience, the inference at issue do not\n       involve character. . . . Moreover, the probative value of the\nevidence\n       . . . is quite high. . . . [A] juror might have though that the\n       government failed to prove anything beyond [appellant's] presence\nin\n       a car with cocaine; and, believing that the government failed to\n       prove [appellant] knew it was cocaine or that he intended to\ndeliver\n       cocaine to the co-defendants, such a juror might have voted to\n       acquit. The evidence of a past conviction might have helped\n       convince a juror of guilt through its permissible suggestion that\n       [appellant] knew about drugs and drug possession.\n\n899 F.2d at 138.\n\f33\n\fBoone also challenges the district court's admission of\nMills' testimony that between 1984 and 1986, he observed\nBoone selling cocaine inside the restrooms of two\nnightclubs where Mills worked. In pressing this objection,\nhe concedes that the evidence was \"minimally relevant to\nknowledge.\" He claims, however, that its probative value\nwas outweighed by its prejudicial effect and it was therefore\ninadmissible under the balance required by Fed. R. Evid.\n403. Boone did not object to this testimony under Rule 403\nin the district court. We therefore again review for plain\nerror, but Boone does not argue plain error even now.\nRather, he spends a great deal of time arguing that Mills'\ntestimony was incredible or unreliable. That was clearly an\nissue for the jury to resolve, and it apparently did so in\nfavor of the government. Moreover, given Boone's\"innocent\ngo-fer\" defense, this evidence was proper under Rule 403.\n\n2. Sufficiency of the Evidence.\n\nBoone argues that evidence of his knowledge of the\ncontents of the package he delivered was insufficient to\nsustain his conviction. He insists that he \"never shared a\nunity of purpose with Farris, and that he never even spoke\nwith Weston during the time-frame of the charged\nconspiracy.\" He maintains that \"he was never told, and had\nno dependable basis to know, what was in the package he\ndelivered to Agent Hilton.\" Boone's Br. at 17. However,\nFarris' testimony by itself is sufficient to support Boone's\nconviction, and the jury apparently credited that testimony.\nFarris testified that he: (1) selected Boone to deliver the\ncocaine to Hilton because of Boone's long-standing ties to\nMills and Boone's prior drug dealing for Farris; (2) told\nBoone that he wanted him to deliver cocaine and offered\nBoone $100 and an eighth of an ounce of cocaine for the\njob; and (3) Boone took the cocaine and agreed to deliver it.\nSee United States v. Hernandez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"582706\"><a href=\"/opinion/582706/united-states-v-ralph-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">962</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1152</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1156 (5th\nCir. 1992)(uncorroborated testimony of cooperating co-\nconspirators that they had conspired to sell drugs, and that\nappellant knew of, joined, and helped effectuate the\nconspiracy, was sufficient to support conviction for violation\nof 21 U.S.C. S 846).\n\n                                  34\n\fNonetheless, Boone argues Farris' testimony is not\nsufficient because, according to Boone, on cross-\nexamination Farris \"clarified that he only told Boone he had\na deal for him, and there was no specific mention of drugs.\"\nBoone's Br. at 17. However, Boone mischaracterizes the\ntestimony Farris offered on cross-examination. When asked:\n\"what exactly did [he] say to Mr. Boone,\" Farris testified:\n\n       That I had something for him, a deal going in on a few\n       days and I asked him, did -- did he want to be a part\n       of it or something like that.\n\nFarris failed to offer a verbatim recitation of what he told\nBoone, even though he was asked for one. Farris related\nonly that he said \"something like that.\" Farris' testimony\nwas not an admission that he failed to tell Boone that the\npackage Boone delivered contained cocaine. Moreover, this\nargument again establishes the propriety of the\naforementioned 404(b) evidence. Assuming that Farris only\ndiscussed the delivery in vague terms such as \"doing a\n\"deal,\" it was important for the jury to understand Boone's\nfamiliarity with the kind of vagaries that could cloak\ndiscussions of a drug delivery.\n\nIn any event, the evidence was sufficient to sustain\nBoone's conviction regardless of any inconsistency in Farris'\ndirect and cross-examination testimony.

The government responded by informing\nBoone that the informant had stopped cooperating with the\nauthorities before Boone was released from state prison in\nearly 1997. In other words, the government conceded that\nthe representation in the PSR that the confidential\ninformant had provided information about Boone was\nerroneous.\n\nNonetheless, Boone claims this non-disclosure violated\ndue process. The argument is, however, somewhat difficult\nto follow. If the confidential informant made the statement\nabout Boone, it certainly would not be exculpatory or\nmaterial. On the contrary, if the statement was made it\nwould have been inculpatory and not subject to Brady\ndisclosure. In any event, Boone contends that if the PSR\nwas correct, i.e., had the confidential informant made an\ninculpatory statement about him, he (Boone) could have\ncalled the confidential informant as his own witness and\nestablished that the allegations were false. He claims he\n\"could have impeached the unknown informant and shown\nthat Boone had been falsely accused of being an early\ncoconspirator, which created a domino effect, causing Mills,\nFarris, and Agent Hilton to either lie or mold their stories\nto fit the framework of their target conspiracy.\" Boone's Br.\nat 19-20.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n19. Stewart Mills, who testified at trial, is identified as a second\nconfidential informant in P 9 of the PSR, and is not the same person\nidentified in this excerpt.\n\n                               37\n\fHowever, Boone fails to tell us how his new twist on the\n\"domino theory\" would have exculpated him. Moreover,\neven if we assume that Boone could have somehow shown\nthat the confidential informant had falsely implicated him,\nhe has not even attempted to establish that Mills, Farris\nand/or Hilton were even aware of the informant's\nstatement, or that they perjured themselves and conspired\nto \"mold their testimony\" to conform to it.\n\nAlternatively, Boone suggests that even if the government\nwas correct that the confidential informant's statement was\nwrong, the statement was actually exculpatory because he\ncould have used the statement to show the jury that he\ncould not have been a member of the Weston, Farris and\nJones drug conspiracy during the time he was in state\nprison. However, assuming arguendo that the statement\nwould be exculpatory as posited, Boone has not shown that\nit was material. The test for materiality is whether the\nfailure to disclose prejudiced the defendant, i.e., whether\nthe failure to disclose undermined confidence in the\noutcome of the trial. See Smith v. Holtz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768442\"><a href=\"/opinion/768442/jay-c-smith-v-john-j-holtz-bureau-of-technical-services-pennsylvania/\"><span class=\"volume\">210</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 195-\n200 (3d Cir. 2000). The fact that Weston, Farris and Jones\nwere engaged in drug-trafficking prior to Boone's release\nfrom state prison does not negate Farris' testimony that he\nrecruited Boone after Boone's release from prison for the\nexpress purpose of delivering cocaine to Agent Hilton on\nJuly 11, 1997. In fact, it corroborates that testimony. Once\nBoone agreed to the July 11th transaction, he joined the\nconspiracy.\n\nThe second Brady violation Boone asserts involves a\nstatement co-defendant Jones made to a pre-sentence\ninvestigator after pleading guilty. Jones told the investigator\nthat Weston typically wrapped his drugs in brown paper\nbags. According to Boone, he could have used this\ninformation to show that the cocaine Farris received from\nWeston and gave to Boone was wrapped in a brown paper\nbag, thereby preventing Boone from knowing that cocaine\nwas inside. However, Boone did not need Jones' statement\nto establish this because Farris testified that the cocaine he\ndelivered to Boone was wrapped in a brown paper bag.\nThus, Jones' statement would have been cumulative and,\nconsequently, not material. See United States v. Burns, 162\n\n                               </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span>\n\f<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">840</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 851 (5th Cir. 1998)(non-disclosure of information\nthat supported the defense theory that fraudulent billing\nwas caused by untimely reimbursements by victim agency\nwas not material because it was merely cumulative of other\nevidence elicited by defense on this point). Moreover, Agent\nHilton testified that by the time Boone delivered the cocaine\nto him, it was in a clear plastic bag. Jones' statement does\nnot contradict that statement because the cocaine was\nwrapped in a clear plastic bag that was then placed in the\nbrown paper bag that was handed to Boone.\n\n4. The District Court Erred in Instructing\n       the Jury That It Could Consider Evidence That\n       Boone Attempted to Influence a Witness as\n       Indicative of Consciousness of Guilt.\n\nBoone argues that the court erred in instructing the jury\nthat evidence of the threatening letter Farris received\n(apparently from Weston, or at his direction) could be\nconsidered as consciousness of guilt. That evidence, which\nwe have set forth above, was admitted without objection,\nand Boone does not challenge its admission here. Boone\nobjected to the charge at trial, but was overruled. He does\nnot now argue that the charge did not accurately state the\nlaw. Rather, he argues that the district court's charge was\nunfair and inappropriate. First, he argues that it was unfair\nbecause it \"lump[ed] together\" Boone's and Weston's prison\ncontacts with Farris. Boone's Br. at 23. He argues this was\nunfair because Weston asked Farris to lie, but he (Boone)\nsimply asked Farris to tell the truth. That is, Boone\nmaintains that he asked Farris to \"truthfully\" state that\nBoone innocently accompanied Farris to the Collingwood\nAuction to ask Mills for a legitimate job, not knowing that\nFarris had solicited Boone to deliver cocaine. This argument\nagain misstates the trial testimony. Farris testified that he\nclearly and fully informed Boone that Boone was being\nhired to deliver cocaine. According to Farris, Boone did not\naccompany Farris to the Collingwood Auction to ask Mills\nfor a job.\n\nBoone's other arguments about the consciousness of\nguilt instruction are equally meritless. Boone claims that\nthe instruction was unwarranted because \"the government\n\n                                39\n\fplaced their witnesses among his co-defendants in[the jail]\n. . . and continuous banter went back and forth to and\nfrom Farris.\" Boone's Br. at 44. Although Boone's point\nhere is rather elusive, we assume (as does the government),\nthat Boone is suggesting that the government attempted to\nentrap Boone by creating an opportunity for him to discuss\nhis drug dealing in front of Farris after Farris agreed to\ncooperate. This is apparently based upon an argument that\nthe government intentionally failed to segregate Farris from\nBoone and Weston after Farris began cooperating. Boone\ndoes not offer any proof to support this claim, and we fail\nto see the legal basis for an \"entrapment\" claim even if\nBoone had such evidence. Therefore, this argument must\nfail.\n\nFinally, Boone claims that Farris, not Boone, initiated\ntheir discussion in the library regarding drafting an\nexculpatory letter. However, that argument misses the\npoint, and is also contradicted by Farris' testimony. The\nfact that the defense presented other prison inmates who\nclaimed that Farris admitted to them that Weston and\nBoone were not guilty of the charges only created a jury\nquestion regarding Farris' credibility. The court properly left\nthat question to the jury.\n\n5. The District Court Erred by Not Charging\n       That a Single Transaction Does Not Establish\n       Conspiracy Membership, or That a Member Can\n       Constructively Terminate His Membership.\n\nBoone argues that the district court improperly denied\nhis request for an instruction that his involvement in a\nsingle transaction did not prove that he was guilty of\nconspiracy. He relies upon our decision in United States v.\nPrice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"660192\"><a href=\"/opinion/660192/united-states-v-james-price-aka-squeezie-james-price-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">711</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 726-29 (3d Cir. 1994). There, we\nreversed a jury instruction that a defendant could be guilty\nof conspiring to distribute cocaine by offering to buy\ncocaine from a member of the conspiracy, even if the buyer\nhad no intention of reselling the cocaine. Here, however,\nBoone did not buy drugs; he delivered them. Thus, Price\ndoes not help him. In fact, the evidence clearly\ndemonstrated that Boone was brought into the conspiracy\nto deliver Weston's cocaine, collect the purchase price and\n\n                               40\n\fremit it to Farris. Boone was only to be paid if he delivered\nthe cocaine, and Weston and Farris would receive the\nmoney only if Boone delivered the cocaine and collected the\nsales price. This is sufficient to prove a conspiracy. See\nUnited States v. DiPasquale, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"439957\"><a href=\"/opinion/439957/united-states-v-anthony-dipasquale-in-no-83-1364-appeal-of-james/\"><span class=\"volume\">740</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1282</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1292 (3d Cir.\n1984). Accordingly, the district court properly denied the\nrequested instruction.\n\nMoreover, the evidence refutes Boone's claim that he was\nonly involved in one illegal act. Farris selected Boone to\ndeliver cocaine to \"Malik\" on July 11th because Boone had\npreviously delivered cocaine for Farris and because Boone\nwas friendly with Mills. Farris' subsequent attempt to use\nBoone for another delivery to \"Malik\" on August 1, was\nstymied only because Farris could not find Boone.\nMeanwhile, Boone was assuring Mills that he (Boone) could\nprovide Mills with large amounts of cocaine to sell. This\nevidence establishes Boone as a member of an ongoing\nconspiracy; not a one-time participant.\n\nThe district court instructed the jury that, after joining a\nconspiracy, a person may terminate his involvement only by\n\"an affirmative act of termination . . . withdrawal or\ndisassociation.\" Boone argued that he was entitled to a\n\"constructive termination\" instruction based on the\nargument that he constructively terminated his\nmembership in the conspiracy by participating in only one\ntransaction. He has presented no authority for that rather\nnovel proposition, and we are not aware of any. Rather, we\nbelieve the district court accurately stated the law. Boone\nwas required to make a prima facie showing of affirmative\nacts to defeat or disavow his membership in the conspiracy.\nSuch acts of disavowal include making a full confession to\nauthorities or renouncing the conspiracy to the co-\nconspirators. United States v. Antar, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"695161\"><a href=\"/opinion/695161/united-states-v-mitchell-antar-in-94-5228-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 582 (3d\nCir. 1995). The mere cessation of activity is insufficient to\nestablish withdrawal. Id. at 582. Boone did nothing to\nattempt to withdraw. Therefore, the district court did not\nerr in refusing to give the requested jury instruction.\n\n                                41\n\f6. The District Court Erred by Finding\n       that Boone Did Not Accept Responsibility\n       for his Crime.\n\nFinally, Boone claims that the district court committed\nclear error by finding that he did not \"accept responsibility\"\nfor his crimes and declining to reduce his Offense Level\npursuant to U.S.S.G. S 3E1.1. A defendant seeking a\nreduction for acceptance of responsibility bears the burden\nof establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that he\nor she is entitled to the reduction, and we review the\ndistrict court's denial of the reduction for clear error. United\nStates v. Muhammad, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755161\"><a href=\"/opinion/755161/united-states-v-rabb-muhammad-aka-william-allison-aka-jerome-camp/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 167 (3d Cir. 1998).\nThe district court's denial of the reduction is entitled to\n\"great deference\" because \"[t]he sentencing judge is in a\nunique position to evaluate a defendant's acceptance of\nresponsibility.\" U.S.S.G. S 3E1.1, Application Note 5.\n\nBoone's claim of acceptance of responsibility is hard to\ntake seriously. It is based upon a statement he gave to\ninvestigators after he was arrested that he now argues was\n\"in all respects a complete confession.\" Boone's Br. at 28.\nAfter his arrest, Boone waived his Miranda rights and\nagreed to give a statement to investigators. In that\nstatement he claimed that, on July 11, 1997, Farris asked\nhim to do a favor and \"give this guy a package.\" Boone said\nhe agreed, and Farris drove Boone to the Collingwood\nAuction. Boone admitted that he delivered the package, and\nthat he skimmed $100 from the money that he received\nfrom \"Malik.\" He denied any knowledge of Farris' cocaine\nsupplier. Boone did not admit that he committed the\ncharged offenses, and he did not admit that he knew the\npackage contained cocaine. Given the evidence here, his\n\"cooperation\" is more a false exculpatory statement than an\nacceptance of responsibility. A defendant does not earn the\nacceptance of responsibility reduction simply by speaking\nto investigators. See United States v. DeLeon-Rodriquez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"708170\"><a href=\"/opinion/708170/united-states-v-jesus-rhadames-deleon-rodriguez-jesus-rhadames/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">764</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 767 (3d Cir. 1995)(district court did not commit\nplain error by denying acceptance reduction where\nappellant's pre-trial statement to investigators stopped\nshort of a full confession). Continuing his game of\"cat and\nmouse,\" Boone argues that he did not admit that he knew\nthat the package contained drugs because he was not\n\n                               42\n\fspecifically asked by the investigators. However, we cannot\nhelp but cast a particularly jaundiced eye on that assertion\nbecause it strikes us as nothing more than a post-hoc\nfabrication to buttress his appeal.\n\nBoone would be hard pressed to demonstrate that he\naccepted responsibility even with his post-arrest statement.\nHe seeks the benefit of the portion of U.S.S.G.S 3E1.1\nApplication Note 2, that provides that \"where a defendant\ngoes to trial to assert and preserve issues that do not relate\nto factual guilt (e. g., to make a constitutional challenge to\na statute or a challenge to the applicability of a statute to\nhis conduct)\", a defendant may be entitled to the\nacceptance of responsibility reduction. That provision is of\nno avail here.\n\nInitially, Boone attempted to rely on the panel opinion in\nUnited States v. Singleton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754623\"><a href=\"/opinion/754623/united-states-v-sonya-evette-singleton/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1343</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir.\n1998)(Singleton I), which held that the government was\nbarred from making promises of leniency to cooperating\nwitnesses in exchange for their truthful testimony against\na defendant. Thus, he filed a pre-trial motion seeking to\nsuppress Mills' testimony based on Singleton I . He concedes\nthat his suppression motion was probably a dead letter by\nthe time of trial because the panel decision had been\nreversed by the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit en\nbanc. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"760928\"><a href=\"/opinion/760928/united-states-v-sonya-evette-singleton-national-association-of-criminal/\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1297</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir.) (Singleton II).20 Nonetheless,\nhe claims that even though the Court of Appeals for the\nTenth Circuit repudiated Singleton I by the time of his trial,\nwe had not as yet addressed the issue.21 Thus, he argues\nthat he continued to fall under the exception explained in\nApplication Note 2.\n\nHowever, we are hard pressed to see how Boone could\nseriously argue for an acceptance of responsibility\nreduction. He opposed the admission of relevant,\ninculpatory evidence, and challenged as incredible the\ntestimony of government witnesses Mills, Farris and Agent\nHilton. We think the law is clear that such actions are\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n20. The Supreme Court later denied a petition for certiorari. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1024</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1999).\n\n21.

United States v. DeLeon-\nRodriquez, 70 F.3d at 767 (acceptance of responsibility\nreduction properly denied because appellant challenged the\nadmission of and accuracy of the government's trial\nevidence, and argued for a verdict of not guilty).\n\nVI. CONCLUSION\n\nFor all of the above reasons, we will affirm Boone's\nsentence of judgment and conviction and will affirm\nWeston's conviction. However, we will vacate Weston's\nsentence and remand solely for the district court to\ndetermine his Base Offense Level consistent with our\nopinion.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                                44\n\f</pre>",
