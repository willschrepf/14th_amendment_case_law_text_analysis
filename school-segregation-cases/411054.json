VDOT also challenged several of AMEC’s claims as\n\nunrecoverable under the contract and some aspects of AMEC’s claimed damages as unavailable\n\nas a matter of law.\n\n       The circuit court rejected all of VDOT’s arguments and awarded AMEC a general verdict\n\nof $21,181,941, the entire amount AMEC sought at the time of trial. AMEC requested, but the\n\ncourt disallowed, an award of prejudgment interest. The parties’ cross-appeals bring each of\n\nthese issues to us for review. We reverse in part, affirm in part, and remand for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                   I.\n\n       In 2000, VDOT awarded AMEC a contract for the construction of the Route 58\n\nClarksville Bypass in Mecklenburg County. The contract price, approximately $72.5 million,\n\nincluded widening four miles of roadway, constructing interchanges and overpasses, and\n\nbuilding four new bridges, the largest spanning the John H. Kerr Reservoir. The contract called\n\nfor completion of the project in November 2003. The contract’s actual completion occurred in\n\n2005. During the five-year project, AMEC encountered difficulties meeting deadlines and\n\ncompleting tasks within its original cost estimates.\n\n       After the completion of the project, AMEC requested an additional $24 million in cost\n\noverruns. Though bundled as a single administrative claim, AMEC’s request for damages\n\nincluded over a dozen specific allegations arising out of various aspects of the five-year project.\n\nWhen VDOT rejected AMEC’s administrative claim, AMEC filed suit in the circuit court. In its\n\namended complaint, AMEC alleged damages caused by:\n\n                      “differing site conditions” involving the drilled shaft work on\n                      the Kerr Reservoir bridge, Amended Complaint ¶¶ 36-63,\n\n\n\n                                                  -2-\n\f                  high lake water levels in the Kerr Reservoir, id. ¶¶ 64-71,\n\n                  Work Orders 4, 6, 7, 12, and 16 authorizing deadline\n                  extensions, id. ¶¶ 72-80, 2\n\n                  work performed during two “winter periods,” id. ¶¶ 81-89,\n\n                  “differing site conditions” involving “boulders at the B640\n                  bridge,” id. ¶¶ 90-95,\n\n                  work site interference from “overhead power lines” at\n                  bridge B641, id. ¶¶ 96-104,\n\n                  problems with the “drilled shaft concrete mix design,” id.\n                  ¶¶ 105-16,\n\n                  replacing the pier 17 foundation cap on the Kerr Reservoir\n                  bridge, id. ¶¶ 117-22,\n\n                  a pier cap plan error involving pier 23 on the Kerr\n                  Reservoir bridge, id. ¶¶ 123-27,\n\n                  shaft layout problems with pier 18 on the Kerr Reservoir\n                  bridge, id. ¶¶ 128-33,\n\n                  repair to a pier 2 column on bridge B643, id. ¶¶ 134-36,\n                  and\n\n                  acceleration efforts, id. ¶¶ 144-50.\n\n       Seeking damages for each of these claims, AMEC relied on Code § 33.1-387. Under the\n\nstatute, a government contractor may institute a “civil action” claiming damages “under the\n\ncontract” so long as (i) the civil action seeks only “costs and expenses” caused by VDOT, and\n\n(ii) the contractor submits its claim to VDOT “within the time and as set out” in Code\n\n§ 33.1-386, which “shall be a condition precedent” to filing suit. Only administrative claims\n\nsubmitted to VDOT, and denied by it, can be asserted in the civil action. See Commonwealth v.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      Prior to trial, the circuit court dismissed AMEC’s claim relating to Work Order 12.\nAMEC has not appealed this ruling.\n\n\n                                               -3-\n\fYeatts, Inc., 233 Va. 17, 20, 353 S.E.2d 717, 719 (1987) (noting the statute authorizes a civil\n\naction “for any portion of the claim” denied by VDOT). 3\n\n        In its responsive pleadings, VDOT asserted that AMEC failed “to satisfy legal and\n\ncontractual conditions precedent to the initiation of legal action” and failed to “exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies.” Prior to trial, VDOT filed a “Motion for Leave to File Pleas in Bar.”\n\nThe pleas in bar contended that many of AMEC’s claims violated Code § 33.1-386(A), which\n\nauthorizes the assertion of an administrative claim “provided that written notice of the\n\ncontractor’s intention to file such claim shall have been given to the Department at the time of\n\nthe occurrence or beginning of the work upon which the claim and subsequent action is based.”\n\nVDOT proffered that AMEC never provided timely, written notice of its intention to file many of\n\nthe claims asserted in the civil action. 4\n\n        AMEC resisted the motion for leave on several grounds, including the assertion that the\n\npleas in bar would involve a “full blown evidentiary hearing, based on a year’s worth of\n\nvoluminous discovery, which will properly occur at trial anyway.” AMEC Brief in Response to\n\nVDOT’s Motion for Leave to File Pleas in Bar at 6. For this reason, AMEC argued, “a full and\n\nfair determination of whether notice was provided is best suited for trial.” Id. at 8.\n\n        On December 13, 2007, the circuit court held a hearing on VDOT’s motion for leave.\n\nWithout addressing the merits of the underlying pleas, the court held the motion for “leave to file\n\n\n\n        3\n         For this reason, we do not address AMEC’s allegation that VDOT breached a “duty of\ngood faith” by refusing to grant “time extensions,” by “blaming” AMEC for the lack of progress,\nby expressing “indifference” to settlement, or by rejecting AMEC’s claim “in bad faith.”\nAmended Complaint ¶¶ 137-43. AMEC did not assert a breach of any “duty of good faith” in its\nadministrative claim.\n        4\n         VDOT also asserted AMEC similarly violated a provision of the contract which VDOT\ninterpreted to require a written statement of the “claimed damage” during, but not after, the\nperiod of contract performance. See VDOT Road and Bridge Specification § 105.16.\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\fpleas in bar will be denied.” On January 23, 2008, the court entered a written order denying\n\nVDOT’s motion for leave to file the pleas in bar. 5 About a month later, the parties received a\n\nletter opinion from the circuit court addressing the merits of the pleas in bar which the court\n\nearlier held could not be filed. The letter began with a reference to “oral argument” on “July 10,\n\n2007” and ended with this conclusion: “Accordingly, the court finds that AMEC’s actual notice\n\nwas sufficient enough to satisfy the statutory and written notice provisions a[t] issue.” AMEC\n\nCivil, LLC v. Commonwealth, 74 Va. Cir. 492, 507 (2008).\n\n        With respect to the statutory written notice requirement, the circuit court held that\n\n“AMEC did not provide VDOT with written notice of its claims as required by Va. Code Ann.\n\n§ 33.1-386.” Id. at 500; see also id. at 504 (“although AMEC did not fully comply with the\n\nwritten notice requirement of Va. Code Ann. § 33.1-386”); id. at 506 (noting “AMEC’s failure to\n\nabide by the statute’s written notice provision”). AMEC’s failure to provide written notice did\n\nnot matter, the court reasoned, because VDOT had “actual notice.” Id. at 506. Actual notice,\n\nwhether written or not, satisfied the court’s “liberal construction” of the statute. Id. at 499. 6\n\n\n\n        5\n          The circuit court granted leave to VDOT to file a summary judgment motion asserting\nthat statutory and contractual written notice requirements mandated the dismissal of various\nAMEC claims. At the hearing on January 23, 2008, the court denied the motion without “ruling\non the merits,” deciding instead “to wait until trial” to resolve the contested issues. The court\nmemorialized that ruling in a written pretrial order entered February 20, 2008.\n        6\n          The court addressed the analogous contractual written notice requirement, see n.4,\nsupra, by finding that the “lack of written notice, standing alone, does not contractually preclude\nAMEC from properly bringing claims against VDOT.” AMEC, 74 Va. Cir. at 497. In the\nalternative, the court sua sponte held VDOT “implicitly waived” the contractual written notice\nrequirement, id. — a point not raised, briefed, or argued by either party. On appeal, AMEC\nconcedes “this was not an argument AMEC asserted during motion practice or trial.” AMEC\nAppellee Br. at 18 n.9 (No. 2061-08-2). “Nor does AMEC rely upon ‘waiver’ now.” Id.\n“AMEC is not asserting that any notice provisions were waived.” Id. at 15 n.7 (emphasis in\noriginal). We accept AMEC’s concession. See Billups v. Carter, 268 Va. 701, 709, 604 S.E.2d\n414, 419 (2004) (“We adhere to the rule that the principles of waiver and estoppel do not apply\nto the Commonwealth and that when acting in its governmental capacity it cannot be bound by\n\n\n                                                  -5-\n\f        VDOT filed a motion for reconsideration pointing out that no hearing had been held on\n\n“July 10, 2007” as the court’s letter opinion stated. 7 More important, VDOT argued, the letter\n\nopinion “contained findings of fact and conclusions of law on issues on which no evidence has\n\nbeen taken” and concluded with a judicial ruling on pleas in bar “which the Court did not allow\n\nVDOT to file.” A few days later, the trial court entered an order denying without comment\n\nVDOT’s motion to reconsider.\n\n        At trial, VDOT repeated its assertion that the lack of written notice barred many of\n\nAMEC’s claims. When VDOT raised the point during its motion to strike, the circuit court held\n\nthe issue had already been decided pretrial. “The motion on actual notice as a substitute for\n\nwritten notice has already been ruled on,” the court continued, “I don’t need to hear another thing\n\nabout it.”\n\n        After trial, the court issued a short letter stating it would enter a “general verdict” in favor\n\nof AMEC for $21,181,941, the entire amount of AMEC’s request at trial. See Letter Opinion at\n\n1 (July 1, 2008). The court refused AMEC’s request for prejudgment interest. Reaffirming its\n\npretrial ruling on VDOT’s unfiled pleas in bar, the court stated that every “factual assumption”\n\nmade in its pretrial ruling turned out to be true. Id. at 2. The court did not identify any specific\n\nexhibits or witnesses supporting this conclusion. The court instead referred generally to\n\n“memoranda addressing the issues” and “minutes” of meetings. Id. These unspecified\n\ndocuments, the court held, provided whatever “written notice” AMEC was required to give\n\nduring the period of contract performance. Id.\n\n\nthe unauthorized acts or representations of its employees and agents.”) (citing, among other\ncases, Main v. Dep’t of Highways, 206 Va. 143, 150, 142 S.E.2d 524, 529 (1965), which refused\nto apply waiver or estoppel to notice provisions of a highway contract).\n        7\n         The record does not contain any hearing conducted on July 10, 2007. VDOT’s motion\nfor leave to file pleas in bar was not filed until December 2007.\n\n\n                                                  -6-\n\f                                                 II.\n\n       The cross-appeals in this case raise an array of issues, with the resolution of some\n\nmooting the need to resolve others. We believe the dispute on appeal can be clustered into four\n\nprincipal subjects:\n\n              A.        TIMELY, WRITTEN NOTICE OF AMEC’S INTENTION TO FILE\n                        CLAIMS PURSUANT TO CODE § 33.1-386(A).\n\n              B.        VDOT’S CONTRACTUAL CHALLENGE TO SEVERAL OF AMEC’S\n                        CLAIMS.\n\n              C.        VDOT’S CHALLENGE TO THE TRIAL COURT’S DAMAGE\n                        AWARD.\n\n              D.        AMEC’S REQUEST FOR PREJUDGMENT INTEREST.\n\nOur holdings on the issues we address render it unnecessary to offer advisory opinions on the\n\nissues we do not address. “In this case, as in all others, we seek to decide cases ‘on the best and\n\nnarrowest ground available’ from the record.” Kirby v. Commonwealth, 50 Va. App. 691, 698\n\nn.2, 653 S.E.2d 600, 603 n.2 (2007) (citations omitted).\n\n                   A.     TIMELY, WRITTEN NOTICE OF AMEC’S INTENTION\n                          TO FILE CLAIMS PURSUANT TO CODE § 33.1-386(A)\n\n       Under Code § 33.1-387, a government contractor may file a civil action against the\n\nCommonwealth for any claim “under the contract” that has been submitted to, and denied by,\n\nVDOT. This statute must be “strictly construed” by the courts. XL Specialty Ins. Co. v.\n\nCommonwealth, 269 Va. 362, 371, 611 S.E.2d 356, 361 (2005). This principle of strict\n\nconstruction follows a long and unbroken tradition in Virginia law. See Sabre Constr. Corp. v.\n\nCounty of Fairfax, 256 Va. 68, 73, 501 S.E.2d 144, 147 (1998) (“The Public Procurement Act\n\nconstitutes a waiver of public bodies’ sovereign immunity, is in derogation of the common law,\n\nand, therefore, must be strictly construed.”); Halberstam v. Commonwealth, 251 Va. 248, 252,\n\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f467 S.E.2d 783, 785 (1996) (holding that the “notice provisions of the Virginia Tort Claims Act”\n\nmust be “strictly construed” by the courts). It is thus fair to say, as most commentators do, that\n\n“strict compliance with notice of claim requirements has become the clearly established rule.”\n\nRobert K. Richardson, Notice of Claim Requirements under the Virginia Public Procurement\n\nAct: Owner’s Friend — Contractor’s Nightmare, 48 Va. Lawyer 34, 36 (October 1999); see also\n\n14 Michael A. Branca & Mark R. Berry, Virginia Practice Series: Construction Law § 6:6, at 174\n\n(2008-09) (“Virginia courts have made clear that the notice requirements of the VPPA are\n\nstrictly applied, and cannot be relaxed or waived by the public body.”).\n\n       Under Code § 33.1-387, a prior administrative claim “as set out” in § 33.1-386 “shall be a\n\ncondition precedent” to the contractor’s right to bring a civil action. When a statute imposes a\n\n“condition precedent” on a suit against the Commonwealth, that limitation “is not merely a\n\nprocedural requirement, but a part of the newly created substantive cause of action.” Sabre\n\nConstr., 256 Va. at 72, 501 S.E.2d at 147 (citation omitted); cf. Hallstrom v. Tillamook County,\n\n493 U.S. 20, 31 (1989) (holding the legislature’s “mandatory conditions precedent to\n\ncommencing suit” may not be disregarded as mere technical requirements). It is not an\n\naffirmative defense obligating the Commonwealth to disprove the occurrence of the condition\n\nbut rather an element of the prima facie case on which the plaintiff has the burden of proof.\n\n       Code § 33.1-386(A) authorizes a contractor to submit an administrative claim to VDOT\n\nseeking damages “under the contract.” The statute, however, includes an important proviso. The\n\nadministrative claim must “set forth the facts upon which the claim is based, provided that\n\nwritten notice of the contractor’s intention to file such claim shall have been given to the\n\nDepartment at the time of the occurrence or beginning of the work upon which the claim and\n\nsubsequent action is based.” Code § 33.1-386(A) (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\f        In its pretrial ruling, the circuit court held that “AMEC did not provide VDOT with\n\nwritten notice of its claims as required by Va. Code Ann. § 33.1-386.” AMEC, 74 Va. Cir. at\n\n500 (emphasis added); see also id. at 504 (acknowledging “AMEC did not fully comply with the\n\nwritten notice requirement of Va. Code Ann. § 33.1-386”); id. at 506 (noting, but finding\n\nunimportant, “AMEC’s failure to abide by the statute’s written notice provision”). The court\n\ndismissed the statutory default as an inconsequential technicality because VDOT had “actual\n\nnotice” of AMEC’s claims. Id. at 503, 506.\n\n        In its post-trial ruling, the court reaffirmed its pretrial ruling that “actual notice was an\n\nacceptable substitute for written notice.” Letter Opinion at 1 (July 1, 2008). The court added,\n\nhowever, a few sentences offering an alternative holding: From “minutes” of meetings and\n\n“memoranda” exchanged between the parties, VDOT “also had written notice of the plaintiff’s\n\nclaims.” Id. at 2 (emphasis added). On several levels, we disagree with both the circuit court’s\n\npretrial and post-trial rulings.\n\n        To begin with, the circuit court’s pretrial ruling began its statutory analysis under the\n\nheading, “Legal Function Trumps Legal Form,” and ended on a similar note, “legal form must\n\nyield to the interests of legal function.” AMEC, 74 Va. Cir. at 499, 506. Our statutory analysis\n\nbegins and ends with a less ambitious premise: “We can only administer the law as it is written.”\n\nUninsured Employer’s Fund v. Wilson, 46 Va.

To comply with Code § 33.1-386(A), the writing must\n\nannounce “the contractor’s intention to file such claim” with VDOT “at the time of the\n\noccurrence or beginning of the work upon which the claim and subsequent action is based.”\n\n(Emphasis added.) This unique notice is not a mere heads-up about an ongoing problem with the\n\ncontractor’s ability to perform. Nor is it a status report on the myriad difficulties discussed\n\nduring the management of the contract. As was true in this case, most complex government\n\ncontracts generate an avalanche of such documentation.\n\n       A written notice under Code § 33.1-386(A) differs from the mass of ordinary\n\ndocumentation by conspicuously declaring that, at least in the contractor’s view, a serious legal\n\nthreshold has been crossed. 8 Signaling discontent with the agreed contract pricing, the\n\ncontractor declares its intent to assert an administrative claim for damages that, if rejected, could\n\nresult in the assertion of a civil action against the contracting agency in the courts. Once hopeful\n\nof an on-time, on-budget, conflict-free contract, the parties find themselves traveling the path\n\ntoward litigation. Knowing when a particular dispute has started down that path can be crucial.\n\nA contracting agency may need to make difficult judgments about continued management of the\n\ncontract. And, depending on the magnitude of the dispute, the agency may also need to calibrate\n\nthe effect a threatened claim might have on its limited procurement budgets.\n\n       That said, Code § 33.1-386(A)’s written notice proviso does not require the sophistication\n\nof a legal pleading. Any document can suffice if it clearly and timely states the contractor’s\n\n       8\n         That was certainly true of this contract. During the course of the project, AMEC sent\nVDOT over five hundred serialized letters addressing various concerns. Only a handful\nannounced AMEC’s intention to escalate an ongoing issue into an administrative claim. In one\nletter, AMEC stated its intention to file a claim only to later expressly withdraw the notice when\nit “decided that the extent of this claim did not escalate and therefore AMEC is withdrawing this\nclaim.” AMEC Serial Letter No. 161, withdrawing AMEC Serial Letter No. 100.\n\n\n                                                - 11 -\n\fintention to later file an administrative claim. 9 The leading Virginia case on this subject, Flory\n\nSmall Bus. Dev. Ctr. v. Commonwealth, 261 Va. 230, 541 S.E.2d 915 (2001), enforced an\n\nidentical written notice requirement of the Public Procurement Act, Code § 2.2-4363, formerly\n\nCode § 11-69(A). 10 In Flory, a dispute arose between a contractor and an agency over whether\n\nthe agency should pay for services performed by the contractor prior to signing the contract. Six\n\nmonths later, after providing services, the contractor sent invoices demanding payment.\n\n       Flory held that the contractor’s invoices, while arguably a written notice of intent to make\n\na claim, came too late because they had not been issued at the “time of the occurrence or\n\nbeginning of the work upon which the claim is based.” Id. at 238-39, 541 S.E.2d at 919-20. And\n\nthe dispute over payment six months earlier, while arguably timely, made the agency generally\n\naware of the contractor’s position but did not specifically “inform” the agency that the contractor\n\n“intended to claim reimbursement” for the disputed services. Id. (emphasis added). It was not\n\nenough that the contracting agency could have intuited the contractor’s intent to file a claim\n\nbased upon the nature of the dispute. The intent to file the claim had to be express, timely, and\n\nin writing. Because the statute established “mandatory, procedural requirements which must be\n\nmet in order for a court to reach the merits of a case,” id. at 238, 541 S.E.2d at 919, these\n\nomissions defeated the contractor’s civil action as a matter of law. Compare Flory, 261 Va. at\n\n       9\n         For purposes of our analysis, we assume arguendo that “minutes of a progress meeting”\ncan constitute a statutorily compliant “written notice” if the written minutes specifically record\nthe contractor’s assertion of its intent to file a claim. See Welding, Inc. v. Bland County Serv.\nAuth., 261 Va. 218, 227, 541 S.E.2d 909, 914 (2001) (interpreting identical language in the\nPublic Procurement Act, Code § 2.2-4363 (formerly Code § 11-69(A))).\n       10\n           The General Assembly copied the requirement of a “written notice” of an “intention to\nfile such claim” from Code § 33.1-386(A) and incorporated it verbatim into the Public\nProcurement Act, Code § 2.2-4363, formerly Code § 11-69(A). See Virginia Procurement Law\nStudy of Senate Joint Resolution 148, 1979 Session, at 51 (1980) (“The language in subsection\n(a) [of former Code § 11-69] is derived from Section 33.1-386.”). We construe these two\nsynonymous provisions the same way.\n\n\n                                                - 12 -\n\f239, 541 S.E.2d at 920 (“[W]e hold that the trial court did not err in dismissing the Center’s\n\nmotion for judgment with prejudice, and we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.”), with\n\nAMEC, 74 Va. Cir. at 500 (asserting that the “Flory Court . . . held that the plaintiff’s claim\n\ncould not be dismissed for failing to comply with the written statutory notice requirement”).\n\n       Under Flory, each written notice of intent must be examined individually. “By\n\nidentifying more than one event that triggers the filing of an intent to file a claim, the statute\n\nacknowledges that not all claims will arise under the same circumstances.” Flory, 261 Va. at\n\n238, 541 S.E.2d at 919. It necessarily follows that the “timing and form” of a putative notice of\n\nintent “requires an examination of the circumstances of each case.” Id. Guided by these\n\nprinciples, we review on appeal each of AMEC’s claims that VDOT contends did not satisfy the\n\nwritten notice requirement of Code § 33.1-386(A).\n\n           Claim Involving Drilled Shaft Work\n\n       This claim involved difficulties AMEC encountered while performing the drilled shaft\n\nwork for the Kerr Reservoir bridge. Various letters and meeting minutes, some as early as 2000,\n\nshowed that AMEC and VDOT knew of problems associated with this aspect of the project. In\n\n2001, despite these concerns, AMEC began the drilled shaft work on the Kerr Reservoir bridge.\n\nAMEC waited until 2003 — two years after beginning the drilled shaft work — to provide its\n\nfirst written notice of an intention to assert a claim. By that time, AMEC had completed about\n\n85% of the drilled shaft work on the bridge.\n\n       As in Flory, the earlier exchange of documents concerning the problems with the drilled\n\nshaft work did not comply with Code § 33.1-386(A)’s requirement that the notice announce the\n\ncontractor’s intention to file an administrative claim for damages. AMEC’s 2003 written notice,\n\nwhile clearly announcing such an intention, was untimely because it came long after “the time of\n\n\n\n\n                                                 - 13 -\n\fthe occurrence or beginning of the work upon which the claim and subsequent action is based.”\n\nCode § 33.1-386(A). 11\n\n            Claim for Defects in the Drilled Shaft Concrete Specification\n\n       During the drilled shaft work, AMEC encountered problems with the concrete mix it used\n\nin an effort to comply with the applicable contractual specification. In its administrative claim,\n\nAMEC asserted the specification was defective and VDOT should have known about it. No\n\nevidence at trial, however, showed that AMEC ever provided any written notice during the\n\nperformance of the contract of an intention to later file a claim for damages caused by the\n\nallegedly defective concrete specification. 12\n\n            Claim for Concrete Formwork for Foundation Caps, Piers & Columns\n\n       In its administrative claim, AMEC sought damages for work associated with setting and\n\nstripping concrete formwork for foundation caps, piers, and columns. At no point during the\n\ncontract performance, however, did VDOT ever receive written notice of AMEC’s intention to\n\nfile independent claims for these alleged additional costs. 13\n\n\n       11\n           On appeal, VDOT also contends the circuit court erred by not barring the drilled shaft\nclaim under accord and satisfaction principles. Our holding makes it unnecessary to address this\nissue. We similarly need not pass judgment on AMEC’s assertion, or VDOT’s argument in\nrebuttal, that VDOT’s “superior knowledge” of the underlying problem (allegedly obtained from\nanother project which experienced similar problems) implied a contractual duty on VDOT’s part\nto notify AMEC of all foreseeable difficulties associated with this aspect of the project.\n       12\n          Our holding renders it unnecessary to address VDOT’s alternative argument that, even\nif AMEC had complied with Code § 33.1-386(A), no viable claim existed because the concrete\nmix requirements constituted a performance, not a design, specification. See, e.g., P.R. Burke\nCorp. v. United States, 277 F.3d 1346, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2002); Conner Bros. Constr. Co. v.\nUnited States, 65 Fed. Cl. 657, 685 (2005). In addition, as was the case with the drilled shaft\nclaim, we do not examine the merits or demerits of AMEC’s “superior knowledge” assertion.\nSee n.11, supra.\n       13\n         VDOT’s opening brief addressed this issue specifically. See VDOT Opening Br. at iii\n& 19-20 (No. 2061-08-2). AMEC’s brief in response does not address the issue.\n\n\n                                                 - 14 -\n\f            Claim for Pier 17 Foundation Cap Repair\n\n       In December 2002, AMEC began constructing a foundation cap for pier 17 at the Kerr\n\nReservoir bridge. Lake water leaked into the form during the concrete pour. The water\n\nweakened the concrete and rendered the foundation cap defective. AMEC eventually had to\n\ndemolish the defective cap and replace it with a new one.\n\n       At trial, an AMEC witness testified that an unidentified AMEC representative, on an\n\nunspecified date, verbally informed VDOT of AMEC’s intention to file a claim for damages\n\narising out of the extra work associated with the pier 17 foundation cap repair. VDOT denied\n\nany such conversation took place. The record contains no written notice from AMEC to VDOT\n\nthat can be reasonably interpreted as stating any intention by AMEC to file a claim based upon\n\nthe repair work to pier 17’s foundation cap. 14\n\n            Claim for Work Authorized by Work Orders 4, 6, 7 & 16\n\n       The contract anticipated the need for additional work not specified in the bid or award.\n\nWhen the need arose, the contract authorized the issuance of a work order after the parties\n\nreached agreement on what was to be done, when it would be done, and at what additional\n\ncost. 15 Over sixty work orders were issued during the project.\n\n       Work Orders 4, 6, 7, and 16 collectively authorized additional work, compensated AMEC\n\nat contractual unit prices, and extended the project completion date. When AMEC and VDOT\n\nagreed to these work orders, AMEC made no written request for any compensation other than the\n\n       14\n           VDOT also argues that, as a matter of law, AMEC failed to establish any contractual\nbasis for this claim even if it had been the subject of a timely, written notice under Code\n§ 33.1-386(A). See VDOT Opening Br. at 30-31(No. 2061-08-2). We need not decide this\nquestion given our holding.\n       15\n          The contract also authorized “force account” work in which VDOT orders the\ncontractor to perform specific tasks. See Specification § 109.05. Work Orders 4, 6, 7, and 16\nwere not “force account” orders.\n\n\n                                                  - 15 -\n\funit pricing specified in the contract. Nor did AMEC at that time communicate in writing any\n\nintention to later file a claim seeking damages related to these work orders. AMEC claimed it\n\nprovided written notice in July 2004, see Trial Ex. D-135, at 7-8, but that notice came after\n\ncommencement of the work authorized by Work Orders 4, 6, 7, and 16. 16\n\n            Claim for Acceleration Damages\n\n       On various aspects of the job, AMEC accelerated its efforts to keep on track with\n\nexpected timelines. AMEC claimed this accelerated effort began in January 2002.\n\n       In 2003, one of AMEC’s representatives engaged VDOT “in a talking process”\n\nconcerning AMEC’s acceleration efforts. The first written notice of any intention to assert an\n\nacceleration claim came in April 2004. This notice announced an intent to file a claim for\n\ndamages “incurred to date” for prior acceleration efforts (work commenced before April 2004)\n\nnot “correctly and fully addressed by Work Order No. 39.” AMEC’s later administrative claim\n\nsought damages for acceleration efforts commenced before and after the April 2004 notice.\n\n            Claim for Damages During the First Winter Period\n\n       The original contract term of performance contemplated three winter periods from 2000\n\nto 2003. Anticipating the possibility of an extension of the completion date, VDOT Road and\n\nBridge Specification § 108.09(b) provided that delays caused by “unforeseen causes” pushing\n\nwork into later winter seasons could render winter working conditions “unsuitable” for\n\ncompleting the job. If that occurred, “consideration may be given to granting an extension of\n\n\n\n\n       16\n          Work Orders 6 and 7 stated that AMEC agreed to perform “the work described herein\nand at the unit prices set forth” and that VDOT agreed to grant the extension and compensate\nAMEC on a “unit price” basis. On appeal, VDOT reasserts its accord-and-satisfaction argument\nmade at trial. See VDOT Opening Br. at 38-40 (No. 2061-08-2). We need not address this issue\ngiven our holding.\n\n\n                                               - 16 -\n\ftime that will encompass a suitable period during which such work can be expeditiously and\n\nacceptably performed.” Id. (emphasis added). 17\n\n       In March 2003, AMEC provided VDOT with written notice of its intent to claim\n\ndamages for the winter extension from November 30, 2003, to April 1, 2004 (the “first winter\n\nperiod”). This first winter period extension was necessary, AMEC stated, given the time\n\nextensions previously granted by VDOT in Work Orders 6, 7, 12, and 16. VDOT acknowledged\n\nreceipt of the written notice and directed AMEC to keep daily records of its work and actual\n\ncosts during the extension period. 18\n\n                          *       *       *      *       *       *       *\n\n       With respect to this last item, AMEC’s claim for damages during the first winter period,\n\nthe circuit court correctly held AMEC’s March 2003 written notice informed VDOT in a timely\n\nmanner of AMEC’s intent to claim damages. 19\n\n       As for AMEC’s acceleration claim, it turns on the timing and scope of the April 2004\n\nwritten notice. This notice was untimely as to acceleration efforts prior to April 2004 but timely\n\nas to acceleration efforts after April 2004 to the extent they were reasonably attributable to\n\ncontractually compensable delays not “correctly and fully addressed by Work Order No. 39.”\n\nOn remand, the circuit court should determine whether any such post-notice efforts existed\n\n       17\n       We cite to VDOT’s Road and Bridge Specifications existing at the time of the contract.\nVDOT amended these Specifications in 2007 and began using the amended version in 2008.\n       18\n          VDOT does not assert on appeal any written-notice challenge to AMEC’s claim for\ndamages arising out of the “second winter period.” Instead, VDOT challenges the “second\nwinter period” claim (as well as the first) as unrecoverable under the contract. See Part II(B),\ninfra at 23-24.\n       19\n          The same conclusion applies to VDOT’s argument that AMEC failed to provide\nwritten notice under Specification § 105.16, which similarly required written notice “at the time\nof the occurrence or beginning of the work upon which the claim and subsequent action are\nbased.” (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n                                                - 17 -\n\fconsistent with our views of the contractual compensability of AMEC’s claims. See Part II(B),\n\ninfra at 18-28.\n\n        With respect to the remaining items contested on appeal (AMEC’s claims for drilled shaft\n\nwork; drilled shaft concrete specification; concrete formwork for foundation caps, piers, and\n\ncolumns; pier 17 foundation cap repair; and Work Orders 4, 6, 7, and 16), 20 we hold the court\n\nerred as a matter of law in concluding AMEC gave timely “written notice” of its “intention to\n\nfile” a claim “at the time of the occurrence or beginning of the work upon which the claim and\n\nsubsequent action is based.” See Code § 33.1-386(A). The circuit court’s contrary conclusion\n\nfirst dispensed with the statutory requirement of written notice and then held, in the alternative,\n\nthat written notice had been given from “minutes” of meetings and “memoranda” exchanged\n\nbetween the parties. No legal precedent supports the court’s first ruling, and no evidence\n\nsupports its alternative ruling.\n\n                          B. VDOT’S CONTRACTUAL CHALLENGES\n                              TO SEVERAL OF AMEC’S CLAIMS\n\n        At trial, VDOT challenged AMEC’s recovery of damages caused by elevated lake water\n\nlevels, two winter periods, unanticipated boulders at the B640 bridge, interference from overhead\n\npower lines, and premium costs for a bond. No provisions of the contract, VDOT argued,\n\nprovided any remedy for these claims.\n\n             Damages for Elevated Lake Water Levels\n\n        Code § 33.1-387 authorizes a contractor to recover damages “under the contract.”\n\nAMEC sought, and the circuit court awarded, damages caused by elevated lake water levels in\n\n\n        20\n          At trial, VDOT either acknowledged or failed to contest AMEC’s assertions that it\nprovided timely, statutorily compliant, written notices of an intention to file claims related to\nelevated lake levels, the second winter period, boulders at bridge B640, and overhead power\nlines. VDOT has not made an issue of these claims on appeal.\n\n\n                                                - 18 -\n\fthe Kerr Reservoir. In support of this claim, AMEC relied on Specification § 104.03, entitled\n\n“Differing Site Conditions.” This provision authorized additional compensation in two\n\nsituations: first, when “subsurface or latent physical conditions” encountered during the work\n\ndiffer materially “from those indicated in the Contract” and, second, when “unknown physical\n\nconditions of an unusual nature” differ materially “from those ordinarily encountered and\n\ngenerally recognized as inherent in the work . . . .” Specification § 104.03.\n\n       Another provision of the contract, however, directly addressed the issue of fluctuating\n\nlake water levels. Under the heading “Site Information,” the contract stated:\n\n             The Contractor should be aware that due to the method of operating\n             the John H. Kerr Reservoir and other factors beyond the control of the\n             Department, the power pool elevation in the reservoir routinely\n             fluctuates by several feet. These fluctuations can take place within a\n             few days. It is the responsibility of the Contractor to avail himself of\n             the historical records of the water levels maintained by the U.S. Army\n             Corps of Engineers, Wilmington District and determine the impacts\n             possible fluctuations may have on planned construction methods and\n             operation. Information on past water levels is available through the\n             Corp’s website at http://www.saw.usace.army.mil while current and\n             predicted water elevations can be obtained by contacting the John H.\n             Kerr Powerhouse at (804) 738-6371 . . . .\n\nContract Order No. F77 at 142. 21 VDOT argued this provision precluded high lake water\n\nfluctuations from being deemed a differing site condition under Specification § 104.03.\n\n       We cannot discern from the record how the circuit court reconciled these two provisions.\n\nAMEC draws our attention to a remark from the bench on the last day of trial in which the court\n\nsaid the high water was a “major condition,” making it “very difficult to believe that anyone\n\ncould reasonably be expected to plan for a period of high water at the level this water was.” The\n\n\n\n       21\n           Specification § 103.06, entitled “Contract Documents,” provided that the “Contract\nshall include the schedule of prices submitted by the bidder, plans, standard drawings, these\nspecifications, supplemental specifications, special provisions, special provision copied notes,\nand the standard form of the Contract, all as furnished by the Department.”\n\n\n                                                - 19 -\n\fostensible clarity of that remark, however, is clouded by another statement, only a moment or\n\ntwo earlier, in which the court acknowledged: “I’m not sure there were differing site conditions\n\nor not.” And both comments were made in a soliloquy which began, “Let me give you a couple\n\nof observations because I’m still not totally pessimistic you can find a way to work this out.”\n\n       However one interprets the court’s remarks, we hold the contract defeats AMEC’s\n\nhigh-water claim as a matter of law. Specification § 104.03 authorized a recovery of costs\n\ncaused (i) by “subsurface or latent physical conditions” encountered during the work which\n\ndiffer materially “from those indicated in the contract,” or (ii) by “unknown physical conditions\n\nof an unusual nature” which differ materially “from those ordinarily encountered and generally\n\nrecognized as inherent in the work . . . .” (Emphasis added.) In the lexicon of government\n\ncontract law, the first part of § 104.03 is known as a Type I condition and the second as a Type II\n\ncondition. See generally Gerald I. Katz, Virginia General Conditions for Public Projects I-9 to\n\nI-10 (Virginia Law Foundation 1993); John Cibinic, Jr., Ralph C. Nash, Jr. & James F. Nagle,\n\nAdministration of Government Contracts 494-514 (4th ed. 2006) (reviewing parallel provision in\n\nfederal government contracts).\n\n       Both aspects of Specification § 104.03 must then be placed within the context of the Site\n\nInformation provision. This provision unmistakably informed AMEC that “factors beyond the\n\ncontrol” of VDOT caused the lake water level to “routinely” fluctuate “by several feet.” See\n\nContract Order No. F77 at 142. Inherent in the representation that fluctuations by several feet\n\nwere routine was the suggestion that non-routine fluctuations might be even higher. The Site\n\nInformation provision warned AMEC to examine the U.S. Army Corps historical records (which\n\nincluded nearly 50 years of water elevation data) to “determine the impacts possible fluctuations\n\nmay have on planned construction methods and operation.” Id. (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 20 -\n\f       When read alongside the Site Information provision, neither aspect of § 104.03 justifies\n\nthe court’s award. No Type I condition existed because the elevated lake water levels did not\n\ndiffer from any condition “indicated in the contract.” See Specification § 104.03. Only an\n\nincongruence between a contract’s representations and the realities of the worksite triggers a\n\nType I condition under § 104.03. See, e.g., Asphalt Roads & Materials v. Commonwealth, 257\n\nVa. 452, 454, 512 S.E.2d 804, 805 (1999) (finding Type I condition where “contract drawings”\n\nbadly underestimated the specific amount of unusable soil to be removed by the contractor). The\n\nVDOT-AMEC contract established neither a baseline nor even a range of fluctuations. Instead,\n\nthe contract advised AMEC that the water level of the lake “routinely fluctuates” by several feet\n\nand directed AMEC to review the historical records to take into account non-routine “possible\n\nfluctuations” of these levels. See Contract Order No. F77 at 142. Because lake water\n\nfluctuations were “beyond the control” of VDOT, id., the contract steered clear of making any\n\nbinding representations on the subject.\n\n       No Type II condition existed either. “A Type II differing site condition is more rare than\n\nits Type I counterpart and is much more difficult to prove.” 1 Richard F. Smith, Virginia\n\nConstruction Law Deskbook ¶ 11.403, at 296 (2008); see also Cibinic, Nash & Nagel, supra, at\n\n492 (recognizing the “relatively heavy burden of proof” required to prove a Type II condition).\n\nAt best, AMEC’s evidence proved only that for a period of time the lake water rose to an unusual\n\nlevel. Standing alone, however, that fact did not authorize contractual compensation. To recover\n\ndamages, the contractor must prove “the condition was unknown, unforeseeable and unusual.”\n\nCibinic, Nash & Nagel, supra, at 509 (emphasis in original).\n\n       As Specification § 104.03 makes clear, only “unknown physical conditions” can\n\nconstitute a Type II condition. Known conditions, whether of an unusual nature or not, must be\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 21 -\n\ffactored into the contractor’s risk assessment. See, e.g., Steven W. Feldman, Government\n\nContract Guidebook § 28:8(b), at 797-98 (4th ed. 2008-09) (listing “[h]igh water level in a lake\n\nwhere work was to be performed” as a condition not included within the “Differing Site\n\nConditions” provision); Cibinic, Nash & Nagle, supra, at 486-87 (listing “flooding” and\n\n“unusually high water” as outside the scope of the “Differing Site Conditions” clause). Under\n\nthe VDOT-AMEC contract, routine and non-routine water level fluctuations presented known\n\nconditional risks associated with the worksite — both categorically placed outside the scope of a\n\nType II condition of Specification § 104.03.\n\n       In reply, AMEC argues VDOT conceded its contractual responsibility to compensate\n\nAMEC for delays attributable to high water by extending the contract completion date for this\n\nvery reason. Thus, “AMEC as a matter of logic became entitled to compensation for the delay.”\n\nAMEC Appellee Br. at 23 (No. 2061-08-2). We disagree.\n\n        VDOT issued work orders granting AMEC extra time to complete the work. The\n\nextensions protected AMEC from per diem liquidated damages under Specification § 108.12 for\n\nfailing to complete the work on time and also protected the contract from being terminated\n\nbecause of the delay. But nothing in these extension work orders, or in the contract itself,\n\nnecessarily provided AMEC with any contractual entitlement to recover damages during the\n\nperiods of extension. 22\n\n       As a general rule, “where the issue is excusable delay as opposed to compensable delay,\n\nthe government accedes, because alternatives such as default termination are not feasible or\n\n       22\n         VDOT made this point to AMEC at the time of the extensions. Work Order 39 granted\na 148-day extension with the caveat: “This time extension shall in no way be construed to mean\nthe Department will pay for any overhead cost associate[d] with the time extension.” Work\nOrder 51 repeated this qualification: “This time extension is not recognition by the Department\nof responsibility for any delays on the Project and shall in no way be construed to mean the\nDepartment will pay for any overhead cost associated with the time extension.”\n\n\n                                                - 22 -\n\fotherwise not in the government’s best interests.” Feldman, supra, § 29.11, at 827. Similarly,\n\nexcusable delay provisions generally “protect a contractor only from a default termination or\n\nliquidated damages liability. These clauses do not entitle the contractor to recover any additional\n\nperformance costs.” Glen E. Monroe, Government Contract Law Manual § 2.92, at 52 (1979).\n\n“Normally, if the delay was caused by events beyond the contractor’s control, the contractor will\n\nbe excused for the delay in performance (under the contract’s “Default” clause) but is\n\nresponsible for the additional costs caused by the delay.” Feldman, supra, § 16:1, at 488.\n\nAMEC’s view to the contrary, if it had the force of law, would badly disorient the management\n\nof government contracts. A contracting agency would be loath to grant time extensions if the\n\ninvariant consequence of doing so meant the agency thereby stipulated to inestimable damages\n\nand forfeited any right to contest the compensability of the contractor’s claim. 23\n\n            Claim for Damages During Two “Winter Periods”\n\n       The contract initially required AMEC to complete the project by November 2003. On\n\nseveral occasions, VDOT agreed to extend the deadline. The extensions collectively spanned\n\ntwo additional winters. In the circuit court, AMEC argued it had a contractual right to be\n\ncompensated for damages during these two additional winter periods.\n\n       On appeal, VDOT claims the circuit court’s general verdict included compensation for\n\neach day of both winter periods: $1,938,418 for November 30, 2003, to April 1, 2004, and\n\n       23\n           VDOT raises two additional points. VDOT argues AMEC anticipated unusual water\nlevel fluctuations by instructing its subcontractor to “design the system” for constructing\nfoundation caps so it would work if the water level increased to “15 feet above the soffit\nelevation” (about 307 feet), thus putting in place a “design parameter” belying AMEC’s later\nallegation that high water levels constituted a differing site condition. To make matters worse,\nVDOT adds, high water could not be viewed as a but-for cause in any event because AMEC’s\nengineering manager admitted at trial that AMEC could only pour foundation caps “up to about\n301” feet, a level well within the lake’s routine fluctuations. We offer no opinion on these\nassertions, preferring instead to rest our decision solely on the plain meaning of governing\ncontractual provisions.\n\n\n                                                - 23 -\n\f$1,922,530 for November 30, 2004, to April 1, 2005. AMEC disagrees, arguing that it “did not\n\nclaim, nor was it awarded, damages for the entirety of both Winter Periods, as VDOT claims.”\n\nAMEC Appellee Br. at 25 (No. 2061-08-2) (emphasis in original). AMEC asserts its evidence\n\nestablished that, “through AMEC’s efforts, the ‘Second Winter Period’ did not ultimately affect\n\nAMEC’s completion of the Project.” Id. “Thus, to the extent AMEC overcame any delay event,\n\nincluding the ‘Second Winter Period,’ AMEC did not seek compensation for that time.” Id.\n\n(emphasis in original).\n\n       The circuit court’s general verdict did not segregate either or both of the additional winter\n\nperiods from the aggregate damages awarded to AMEC. Because we reverse many of AMEC’s\n\nclaims the circuit court relied upon for its general verdict, we cannot determine how much, if\n\nany, of the damage award is attributable to either or both of the additional winter periods. We\n\ndecline to offer what, in all likelihood, could be an advisory opinion.\n\n       Suffice it to say, even when a government contract authorizes recovery of damages for\n\nwinter weather, the “contractor must demonstrate — through contemporaneous records if\n\npossible — the extent of the adverse weather and its impact on critical activities.” Feldman,\n\nsupra, § 29:7, at 821. We direct the circuit court on remand to review the evidentiary record and\n\nto make specific findings on whether AMEC proved any entitlement to damages for conditions\n\nduring either or both of the two additional winter periods. If the court finds in AMEC’s favor,\n\nthe court should identify the contractual basis for the award and make factual findings as to the\n\nspecific damages awarded. 24\n\n\n\n       24\n          On appeal, VDOT challenges the contractual compensability of AMEC’s claims to\nboth winter periods. Thus, it should not be assumed on remand that VDOT’s challenge has been\nwaived under law-of-the-case principles (as it should be with respect to AMEC’s claim related to\nboulders at bridge B640, see n.25, infra).\n\n\n\n                                                - 24 -\n\f             Claim Related to Boulders at Bridge B640\n\n        At trial, AMEC claimed it sustained damages due to drilled shaft problems and\n\nunanticipated boulders at the bridge B640 worksite. These conditions allegedly delayed work for\n\n40 days. On appeal, VDOT does not challenge the compensability of the boulders claim.\n\nInstead, VDOT contends the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to AMEC proved no\n\nmore than 8 days of delay attributable to boulders. The remainder, VDOT argues, belongs solely\n\nto delays attributable to the drilled shaft claim.\n\n        Here again, on this record, we cannot resolve this dispute on appeal given the inseverable\n\nnature of the circuit court’s general verdict. Because we find many of AMEC’s claims\n\nstatutorily barred (including the drilled shaft claim), we remand the boulders claim to the circuit\n\ncourt with instructions to examine the evidentiary record and to make specific factual findings. 25\n\nOn remand, the circuit court should apply the maxim: “[W]here there is evidence of damage\n\nfrom several causes, for a portion of which a defendant cannot be held liable, a plaintiff must\n\npresent evidence that will show within a reasonable degree of certainty the share of damages for\n\nwhich that defendant is responsible.” TechDyn Systems Corp. v. Whittaker Corp., 245 Va. 291,\n\n296, 427 S.E.2d 334, 337 (1993) (citations omitted).\n\n             Claim for Interference from Overhead Power Lines\n\n        The circuit court’s general verdict included an award of damages AMEC sought as a\n\nresult of having to wait for Dominion Virginia Power to deenergize overhead power lines near\n\nthe worksite of pier 1 on bridge B641. AMEC claimed Specification § 105.07 inaccurately\n\nstated that “[e]xisting utilities” were indicated on the plans. The plans specifically noted the\n\npresence of the “footings for the power line post” near pier 1 on bridge B641 but not the lines\n\n        25\n         As for the boulders issue, AMEC’s entitlement to a recovery under the “Differing Site\nConditions” clause became law of the case when VDOT did not challenge it on appeal.\n\n\n                                                     - 25 -\n\fstrung between the power poles. After the contract was awarded, Dominion Virginia Power\n\nmoved the power pole pedestal shown on the original plans to make way for AMEC to install the\n\nroad leading to bridge B641.\n\n        In its pretrial motions and at trial, VDOT pointed out that AMEC failed to read the\n\nentirety of Specification § 105.07. Though § 105.07 anticipated that all utilities would be\n\nindicated on VDOT’s plans (presumably the poles as well as the lines between them), the\n\nprovision nonetheless placed the burden on AMEC to conduct its own pre-construction\n\ninvestigation to confirm the information in the plans:\n\n                Prior to preparing a bid, the bidder shall contact known utility\n                owners to determine the nature, extent, and location of existing,\n                adjusted, or new utility facilities. Any additional cost resulting\n                therefrom shall be reflected in the bid price for other items in the\n                Contract.\n\nSpecification § 105.07. The contract further provided: “The new location of such utilities will\n\nnot normally be shown on the plans. Some utilities may remain or be adjusted within the\n\nconstruction limits simultaneously with project construction operations.” Id. (emphasis added).\n\nThe specification required AMEC to “coordinate project construction with planned utility\n\nadjustments . . . .” Id.\n\n        As for any contractual right to damages, Specification § 105.07 expressly disclaimed\n\nVDOT’s liability for damages caused by “interference” from electrical utility lines:\n\n              Except as otherwise specified herein, the Department will not be\n              responsible for any claims for additional compensation from the\n              Contractor resulting from delays, inconvenience, or damage sustained\n              by him attributable to interference by utility appurtenances, or the\n              operation of moving the same, other than a consideration of an\n              extension of time.\n\n              If it is determined that interference by utility appurtenances caused a\n              delay of such magnitude or otherwise altered project operations so as\n              to increase significantly the Contractor’s cost of performing the work,\n\n\n\n                                                 - 26 -\n\f             the [VDOT] Engineer may consider additional compensation limited\n             to the actual costs incurred by the Contractor. The determination of\n             the severity of the interference, its impact on the Contractor’s costs,\n             and the amount, if any, of compensation shall be at the sole discretion\n             of the Engineer. . . . Nothing herein shall be construed as requiring\n             acceptance of the Contractor’s presentation or payment of additional\n             compensation.\n\n       In short, Specification § 105.07 noted that the plans should indicate the location of utility\n\nlines. AMEC does not deny the pre-construction plans depicted the location of the “power line\n\npedestal” or claim the utility lines were not readily apparent from a site visit. At trial, AMEC\n\nclaimed only that the lines themselves were not drawn in. Even assuming an insufficiency in the\n\nplans, Specification § 105.07 obligated the contractor to conduct its own investigation “to\n\ndetermine the nature, extent, and location” of the lines and to “coordinate project construction\n\nwith planned utility adjustments.” AMEC conceded that it made no effort to do so.\n\n       While VDOT reserved the “sole discretion” to provide the contractor either with an\n\nextension or compensation, Specification § 105.07 divested AMEC of any right to “additional\n\ncompensation” beyond that which VDOT has approved. For these reasons, the circuit court\n\nerred in awarding any contractual damages under Specification § 105.07 for damages AMEC\n\nallegedly sustained due to the overhead power lines near pier 1 on bridge B641.\n\n            Claim for “Bond Premium”\n\n       The circuit court awarded AMEC damages for a “bond premium.” 26 On appeal, VDOT\n\nchallenges the bond premium award as factually insupportable. 27 We have found no place in the\n\nrecord, however, where VDOT objected to the bond premium.\n\n\n       26\n          Other than a line item on a spreadsheet exhibit summarizing AMEC’s damages, no evidence\nin the record discloses what the bond was or what contractual right AMEC had to recover it as an\nelement of damages. The circuit court made no mention of it from the bench or in its letter opinions.\nWe infer the court awarded the bond premium line item, however, because the general verdict award\nnecessarily included the amount. See Modified Summary of Damages (Tr. Exhibit P-103).\n       27\n          Because VDOT does not raise the issue on appeal, we do not address whether the\ndefaulted appellate challenge to the bond premium could be analogized to the situation in Little\n                                                 - 27 -\n\f       Rule 5A:18 precludes appellants from raising for the first time on appeal “grounds\n\nasserted as a ‘basis for reversal’ of the trial court’s judgment.” Blackman v. Commonwealth, 45\n\nVa. App. 633, 642, 613 S.E.2d 460, 465 (2005). Exceptions to Rule 5A:18 exist — but we\n\nemploy them only in rare cases, and we never invoke them sua sponte. See Widdifield v.\n\nCommonwealth, 43 Va. App. 559, 564, 600 S.E.2d 159, 162 (2004) (en banc); Edwards v.\n\nCommonwealth, 41 Va. App. 752, 761, 589 S.E.2d 444, 448 (2003) (en banc), aff’d by\n\nunpublished order, No. 040019 (Va. Oct. 15, 2004). Consequently, we will not review on appeal\n\nthe factual or legal basis for the circuit court’s award of a bond premium.\n\n              C. VDOT’S CHALLENGE TO THE TRIAL COURT’S DAMAGE AWARD\n\n       With respect to compensatory damages — both on undisputed claims and those surviving\n\nappeal — we must address VDOT’s argument that AMEC’s damage models were flawed on two\n\ndifferent levels. VDOT asserts AMEC failed to present a prima facie case for its claim for\n\nextended, unabsorbed, home office overhead costs. VDOT also argues AMEC recovered\n\nimpermissible mark-ups on its claims for reimbursement of actual costs for extra material, labor,\n\nand equipment.\n\n           Home Office Overhead Damages\n\n       AMEC’s expert included in his damage model a component for extended, unabsorbed,\n\nhome office overhead. In a pretrial in limine motion and at trial, VDOT objected to AMEC’s\n\nfailure to present any evidence that it was unable to recoup home office overhead expenses by\n\ndeploying its workforce on other revenue-producing aspects of the project. The court rejected\n\nVDOT’s objection without comment.\n\n\n\n\nv. Cooke, 274 Va. 697, 719, 652 S.E.2d 129, 142 (2007). In neither its appellate briefs nor oral\nargument did VDOT seek a remand of the bond premium award for recalculation based upon any\nsuccess VDOT might have in obtaining the reversal of any of AMEC’s other claims.\n                                             - 28 -\n\f        Overhead costs include expenses incurred by a contractor “for the benefit of its business\n\nas a whole.” Fairfax County Redev. & Housing Auth. v. Worcester Bros., 257 Va. 382, 387-88,\n\n514 S.E.2d 147, 150-51 (1999). The calculation includes, for example, “the salaries of office\n\nstaff, accounting expenses, dues and subscriptions, equipment costs, and utility services.” Id.\n\nWhen a project takes longer than the contractor estimated, the overhead expenses are “extended”\n\nfor the period of delay. See generally Cibinic, Nash & Nagle, supra, at 720-26; Branca & Berry,\n\nsupra, § 11:25, at 369. The overhead costs become “unabsorbed” when the contractor cannot\n\nperform other revenue-generating work to cover the lost income from the delayed work. See W.\n\nNoel Keyes, Government Contracts § 42.8, at 944-45 & nn.13 & 15 (3d ed. 2003). “When this\n\noccurs, the ‘reduced activity’ contract no longer ‘absorbs’ its share of overhead costs.” Fairfax\n\nCounty Redev., 257 Va. at 388, 514 S.E.2d at 150 (citation omitted).\n\n        Not “every instance of delay,” even if attributable to a contractual breach, entitles the\n\ncontractor to a recovery of home office overhead costs. Id. at 388, 514 S.E.2d at 151. To prevail\n\nunder Virginia law, the contractor must prove among other things “that it could not otherwise\n\nreasonably recoup its pro rata home office expenses incurred while its workforce was idled by\n\nthe delay.” Id. As a matter of law, the contractor cannot recover if it fails to “show that it was\n\nreasonably unable to recoup its overhead costs.” Lockheed Info. Mgmt. Systems Co. v.\n\nMaximus, Inc., 259 Va. 92, 116, 524 S.E.2d 420, 433 (2000). It is not enough to show that the\n\n“government significantly interfered with efficient performance of the contract.” Charles G.\n\nWilliams Constr., Inc. v. White, 326 F.3d 1376, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2003). In those circumstances,\n\nthe contractor can still “allocate a portion of its indirect costs to that contract.” Id. at 1381.\n\n        On appeal, VDOT contends AMEC failed to offer any evidence that it could not\n\nreasonably recoup its home office overhead costs from other revenue-producing work during the\n\n\n\n\n                                                  - 29 -\n\fperiods of delay. 28 We agree. AMEC’s expert described his calculation of home office\n\noverhead in cursory terms. His trial exhibit simply did the math: first calculating the ratio of\n\nproject revenue to company revenue, applying that ratio to home office overhead, creating a per\n\ndiem rate from the resulting project attribution, and then multiplying the per diem rate by the\n\ntotal days of delay. These mathematical equations, however, relied wholly upon the unstated\n\n(and thus unproven) assumption that AMEC could not have recouped its home office overhead\n\nfrom other revenue-producing work. Neither AMEC’s expert nor any of its fact witnesses\n\naddressed this point.\n\n       The inadequacy of AMEC’s factual foundation parallels a similarly insufficient showing\n\nrejected by Lockheed. There, a contractor’s expert allocated “company-wide overhead\n\nexpenses” to the breached contract and testified that the lost revenue from the contract caused the\n\nallocated overhead to drive down the company’s overall profits. Lockheed, 259 Va. at 115, 524\n\nS.E.2d at 433. The expert did not specifically address (nor did any other evidence) whether other\n\nrevenue-producing work could have reasonably absorbed the overhead. Lockheed held the\n\nexpert’s testimony failed to establish a prima facie case for home office overhead damages:\n\n               When a breach by a party causes a delay to the ability of the other\n               party to perform, the injured party is entitled to recover, as\n               damages, unabsorbed overhead expenses. To recover such\n               damages, the injured party must show that it could not otherwise\n               recoup its pro rata home office expenses incurred during the delay\n               and it must prove the amount of these expenses with reasonable\n               certainty . . . . [T]he plaintiff is required to show that it was\n               reasonably unable to recoup its overhead costs. There is no such\n               evidence in this case.\n\n\n       28\n           VDOT’s argument on appeal goes further, contending that the evidence affirmatively\ndisproved AMEC’s entitlement for home office overhead by establishing that AMEC mobilized\nto other revenue-generating aspects of the project — thus producing earnings that fully or\npartially recouped any allegedly unabsorbed overhead. See P.J. Dick, Inc. v. Principi, 324 F.3d\n1364, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (affirming denial of overhead costs where the evidence “shows\nconclusively that [the contractor] was able to progress other parts of the work during the time\nperiods it alleges it was suspended”). Our holding makes it unnecessary to decide whether the\nevidence disentitled AMEC to a recovery of home office overhead.\n                                                - 30 -\n\fId. at 115-16, 524 S.E.2d at 433 (second emphasis added). The same can be said here as well.\n\nAMEC’s evidence failed to address its “ability or inability to reasonably recoup,” id. at 116, 524\n\nS.E.2d at 433, overhead expenses from other revenues. The circuit court, therefore, erred in\n\nfinding AMEC’s evidence sufficient to support an award of home office overhead. 29\n\n            Actual Costs vs. § 109.05 Mark-Ups\n\n       Prior to trial, VDOT filed a motion in limine objecting to AMEC’s expected expert\n\ntestimony on damages. AMEC’s expert, VDOT argued, improperly calculated damages by\n\nemploying cost mark-ups under Specification § 109.05. These mark-ups included, among other\n\nthings, enhancements for “administration and profit.” The circuit court denied the motion\n\nwithout prejudice reserving all such issues for resolution at trial.\n\n       At trial, AMEC’s expert admitted his damage model used mark-ups allowed under\n\nSpecification § 109.05. That provision authorized compensation for “[e]xtra work” on a “force\n\naccount basis.” AMEC used this method in its administrative claim and expressly applied\n\n“applicable mark ups” to base labor and equipment costs. See AMEC Administrative Claim at\n\n22. A 10% mark-up was applied to AMEC’s subcontractor costs under § 109.05(f) and a 15%\n\nmark-up to AMEC’s rented equipment costs under § 109.05(d). The materials costs included a\n\n15% mark-up to cover “administration and profit” under § 109.05(c). AMEC added to its labor\n\ncosts a 70% mark-up under § 109.05(a)-(b).\n\n       VDOT renewed its objection at trial to this testimony and contested any damage award\n\nbased upon it. VDOT argued § 109.05’s “force account” pricing formula applied not to\n\ncontractual damages generally but only to “[e]xtra work” pursuant to work orders issued by\n\nVDOT during the project. AMEC’s claims for contractual damages did not seek recovery for\n\nforce-account work orders.\n\n       29\n         VDOT does not argue AMEC similarly failed to prove its worksite overhead expenses\nwere unabsorbed. We express no opinion on the matter. See generally Feldman, supra, § 29:6,\nat 817-18.\n                                           - 31 -\n\f       The circuit court rejected VDOT’s arguments without comment. The court’s general\n\nverdict adopted in full the damage figures advocated by AMEC’s expert. On appeal, AMEC\n\ndefends the circuit court’s award arguing that “Specification § 109.05 prescribes the method of\n\ncalculation.” AMEC Appellee Br. at 18 (No. 2061-08-2).\n\n       As we have already explained, AMEC failed to present a prima facie case for the\n\nrecovery of home office overhead. To the extent § 109.05’s force-account pricing formula\n\nincluded a recovery of home office overhead, the circuit court erred by awarding such damages.\n\n       We reach the same conclusion with respect to profit margins included within the mark-\n\nups allowed by § 109.05. Because AMEC’s claims did not (and could not) seek recovery on a\n\nforce-account basis, § 109.05 has no relevance. 30 Instead, AMEC’s claims stemmed either from\n\nthe Differing Site Conditions provision, § 104.03, which expressly excluded “anticipated\n\nprofits,” or from the general dispute provision, § 105.16, which twice stated, “Only actual costs\n\nfor materials, labor, and equipment will be considered.” (Emphasis added.) 31\n\n       To the extent it relied on § 109.05’s allowance of profit margin mark-ups, AMEC’s\n\ndamage model was systemically flawed. An award of actual costs includes direct costs (like the\n\nprice of materials and the wages of employees) and indirect costs (like home office overhead).\n\nSee Fairfax County Redev., 257 Va. at 388, 514 S.E.2d at 151. Actual costs exclude profit\n\nmargin mark-ups, which by definition go beyond direct and indirect expenditures. Cf. William\n\n       30\n          As AMEC correctly notes, Specification § 109.05 provided: “Extra work performed in\naccordance with the requirements of Section 104.03 will be paid for at the unit prices or lump\nsum specified in the work order.” Under § 101.02, however, “[e]xtra work” means an “item of\nwork that is not provided for in the Contract as awarded but that is found to be essential to the\nsatisfactory fulfillment of the Contract within its intended scope.” Extra work thus does not\ninclude completing, albeit under more arduous or costly conditions, an “item of work” already\nrequired by the contract.\n       31\n          The applicability, if any, of Code § 2.2-4335 to any aspect of AMEC’s delay damage\nclaims has not been addressed by AMEC or VDOT either in the circuit court or on appeal. We\nthus offer no opinion on this subject. Cf. Martin Bros. Contractors v. Va. Military Inst., 277 Va.\n586, 675 S.E.2d 183 (2009).\n\n                                               - 32 -\n\fSchwartzkopf & John J. McNamara, Calculating Construction Damages § 8.03, at 171 (2d ed.\n\n2001) (“Generally, profit may not be recovered when a contractor is simply delayed in the\n\nperformance of its work.”).\n\n       On remand, the circuit court should reexamine the evidentiary record to determine\n\nwhether the evidence provides a reasonable basis to determine actual costs incurred by AMEC as\n\na result of the claims unaffected by this appeal. 32 The recalculated damage award should\n\nexclude any recovery for mark-ups attributable to home office overhead and profit margins.\n\n                     D.   AMEC’S REQUEST FOR PREJUDGMENT INTEREST\n\n       The circuit court denied AMEC’s request for prejudgment interest on its award of\n\ncompensatory damages. On appeal, AMEC asserts the court erred in doing so. We disagree.\n\n       “Interest may be awarded against a sovereign only by its consent.” Bd. of Supervisors v.\n\nFCS Bldg. Ass’n, 254 Va. 464, 466, 492 S.E.2d 634, 636 (1997) (citing Ry. Express Agency Inc.\n\nv. Commonwealth, 196 Va. 1059, 1066, 87 S.E.2d 183, 187 (1955)). In Virginia, “so far as we\n\nknow, it has never been held by this court that a claim asserted against the State . . . bears interest\n\nwhere there is no provision in the statute or authorized agreement creating the liability for the\n\npayment of interest.” County of Fairfax v. Century Concrete Servs., 254 Va. 423, 425, 492\n\nS.E.2d 648, 650 (1997) (quoting City of Lynchburg v. Amherst County, 115 Va. 600, 608, 80\n\nS.E. 117, 120 (1913)); see Commonwealth v. Safe Deposit & Trust Co., 155 Va. 458, 460, 155\n\n\n\n\n       32\n           VDOT also challenges any use of the “Rental Rate Blue Book” for purposes of\nestimating actual costs associated with owner-furnished equipment. AMEC’s expert, however,\ntestified that he used the Blue Book to approximate “actual costs” for owner furnished\nequipment. Based on this testimony, the circuit court accepted the Blue Book as “a standard\nused in the profession” for estimating these costs. On this record, we cannot say the court was\nplainly wrong. Therefore, once purged of home office overhead and profit margins, if any, the\nestimates in the “Rental Rate Blue Book” may be relied upon by the circuit court as a basis for\ndetermining owner-furnished equipment costs on remand. See generally Schwartzkopf &\nMcNamara, supra, § 3.04[C], at 88-89.\n                                                - 33 -\n\fS.E.2d 897, 898 (1930) (noting that “interest, when not stipulated for by contract, or authorized\n\nby statute, . . . is not to be awarded against a sovereign government”). 33\n\n       “Under Virginia law, courts must strictly construe contractual — as well as statutory —\n\nwaivers of immunity.” George Hyman Constr. Co. v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n\n816 F.2d 753, 760 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (rejecting, on sovereign immunity grounds, a claim for\n\nprejudgment interest arising out of a government contract). Our courts have long held “there can\n\nbe no waiver of sovereign immunity by implication.” Hinchey v. Ogden, 226 Va. 234, 241, 307\n\nS.E.2d 891, 895 (1983). The General Assembly “may limit the right to sue to certain specified\n\ncauses” and, when it does so, the Commonwealth “can be sued only in the manner and upon the\n\nterms and conditions prescribed.” Va. Bd. of Med. v. Va. Physical Therapy Ass’n, 13 Va. App.\n\n458, 465, 413 S.E.2d 59, 63 (1991) (citation omitted).\n\n       No express statutory waiver of sovereign immunity exists for AMEC’s claim for\n\nprejudgment interest. Code § 33.1-387 authorizes AMEC’s civil action only on the “portion” of\n\nthe administrative claim denied by VDOT. Code § 33.1-386(A) authorizes an administrative\n\nclaim, but limits it to a recovery of “costs and expenses” under the contract. Code § 33.1-386(A)\n\nsays nothing about an allowance of prejudgment interest on contractually recoverable costs and\n\nexpenses. The general prejudgment interest statute, Code § 8.01-382, does not expressly or by\n\nnecessary implication apply to the Commonwealth. To be sure, the statutory predecessors to\n\nCode § 8.01-382 (Code of 1904, §§ 3390-91) existed when the Virginia Supreme Court said our\n\ncourts “aided by the legislature” have authorized prejudgment claims, but that no court has\n\n\n\n       33\n          Safe Deposit Co. quoted this dictum from a Wisconsin case that has since been\noverruled. See City of Milwaukee v. Firemen’s Relief Ass’n, 165 N.W.2d 384, 390 (Wis. 1969),\noverruling Schlesinger v. State, 218 N.W. 440 (Wis. 1928). The dictum, however, continues to\nhave considerable support from modern precedents. See, e.g., Kingston Constructors v.\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 860 F. Supp. 886, 888 (D.D.C. 1994) (“It is well-settled\nthat a sovereign is immune from liability for interest unless it has waived its immunity by statute\nor contract.”).\n                                                - 34 -\n\fauthorized such claims “against the State” itself. City of Lynchburg, 115 Va. at 608, 80 S.E. at\n\n120.\n\n       Nothing in the contract authorized a recovery of prejudgment interest on a successful\n\nadministrative claim. The contract limited payment of interest to situations involving an\n\nuntimely “final payment” under § 109.09 or a “partial payment” invested with an escrow agent\n\nunder § 109.07. These payments, however, involve agreed-upon contractual payments — not\n\ncontested sums asserted in the administrative claim process. The provision governing disputed\n\nadministrative claims, § 105.16, did not authorize interest on disputed claims. Even when\n\nVDOT and the contractor enter into a settlement agreement resolving a disputed administrative\n\nclaim, the payment of the settlement funds itself “will not be subject to payment of interest\n\nunless such payment is specified as a condition of the claim settlement.” Specification § 105.16.\n\n                                                 III.\n\n       In sum, we reverse in part and affirm in part the circuit court’s final order.\n\n       A. Statutory Written Notice Requirements.\n\n       Code § 33.1-386(A) bars part of AMEC’s acceleration claim and five of the other six\n\nclaims challenged by VDOT on appeal as violative of the statutory requirement of a timely,\n\nwritten notice of the contractor’s intention to file an administrative claim. We direct the circuit\n\ncourt on remand to recalculate its award to exclude these barred claims. 34\n\n       B. Contractual Compensabilty of Several of AMEC’s Claims.\n\n       The circuit court erred in awarding damages for AMEC’s claims related to elevated lake\n\nwater levels and interference from overhead power lines.\n\n\n       34\n           The barred claims involve the disputes concerning drilled shaft work; acceleration\nefforts prior to April 2004 and acceleration efforts after April 2004 unrelated to the alleged\ninadequacies of Work Order 39; drilled shaft concrete specification; concrete formwork for\nfoundation caps, piers, and columns; pier 17 foundation cap repair; and Work Orders 4, 6, 7, and\n16. We hold neither Code § 33.1-386(A) nor the notice provisions of the contract bar the claim\nfor the first winter period.\n                                                - 35 -\n\f       With respect to AMEC’s claim related to the two winter periods, we direct the circuit\n\ncourt on remand to review the evidentiary record and to make specific findings on whether\n\nAMEC proved any entitlement to damages for conditions during either or both of the two\n\nadditional winter periods. If the court finds in AMEC’s favor, the court should identify the\n\ncontractual basis for the award and make factual findings as to any specific damages awarded.\n\n       With respect to AMEC’s claim of damages caused by boulders at bridge B640, we direct\n\nthe circuit court on remand to review the evidentiary record and to make specific findings on\n\nwhether AMEC proved damages specifically attributable to this condition.\n\n       Applying Rule 5A:18, we affirm the circuit court’s award of damages associated with\n\nAMEC’s bond premium.\n\n       C. Calculation of AMEC’s Damages.\n\n       The circuit court erred in granting AMEC an award for home office overhead and by\n\nallowing AMEC to mark up its actual costs with either home office overhead or profit margins.\n\nWe direct the court on remand to excise such mark-ups from any damage award attributable to\n\nclaims surviving this appeal.\n\n       D. Prejudgment Interest.\n\n       We affirm the circuit court’s denial of AMEC’s request for an award for prejudgment\n\ninterest. VDOT raises no challenge on appeal to any award of post-judgment interest, and thus,\n\nwe do not address this issue.\n\n\n\n                                                        Reversed in part, affirmed in part,\n                                                        and remanded for further proceedings\n                                                        consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 36 -\n\f",

VDOT also challenged several of AMEC’s claims as\n\nunrecoverable under the contract and some aspects of AMEC’s claimed damages as unavailable\n\nas a matter of law.\n\n       The circuit court rejected all of VDOT’s arguments and awarded AMEC a general verdict\n\nof $21,181,941, the entire amount AMEC sought at the time of trial. AMEC requested, but the\n\ncourt disallowed, an award of prejudgment interest. The parties’ cross-appeals bring each of\n\nthese issues to us for review. We reverse in part, affirm in part, and remand for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                   I.\n\n       In 2000, VDOT awarded AMEC a contract for the construction of the Route 58\n\nClarksville Bypass in Mecklenburg County. The contract price, approximately $72.5 million,\n\nincluded widening four miles of roadway, constructing interchanges and overpasses, and\n\nbuilding four new bridges, the largest spanning the John H. Kerr Reservoir. The contract called\n\nfor completion of the project in November 2003. The contract’s actual completion occurred in\n\n2005. During the five-year project, AMEC encountered difficulties meeting deadlines and\n\ncompleting tasks within its original cost estimates.\n\n       After the completion of the project, AMEC requested an additional $24 million in cost\n\noverruns. Though bundled as a single administrative claim, AMEC’s request for damages\n\nincluded over a dozen specific allegations arising out of various aspects of the five-year project.\n\nWhen VDOT rejected AMEC’s administrative claim, AMEC filed suit in the circuit court. In its\n\namended complaint, AMEC alleged damages caused by:\n\n                      “differing site conditions” involving the drilled shaft work on\n                      the Kerr Reservoir bridge, Amended Complaint ¶¶ 36-63,\n\n\n\n                                                  -2-\n\f                  high lake water levels in the Kerr Reservoir, id. ¶¶ 64-71,\n\n                  Work Orders 4, 6, 7, 12, and 16 authorizing deadline\n                  extensions, id. ¶¶ 72-80, 2\n\n                  work performed during two “winter periods,” id. ¶¶ 81-89,\n\n                  “differing site conditions” involving “boulders at the B640\n                  bridge,” id. ¶¶ 90-95,\n\n                  work site interference from “overhead power lines” at\n                  bridge B641, id. ¶¶ 96-104,\n\n                  problems with the “drilled shaft concrete mix design,” id.\n                  ¶¶ 105-16,\n\n                  replacing the pier 17 foundation cap on the Kerr Reservoir\n                  bridge, id. ¶¶ 117-22,\n\n                  a pier cap plan error involving pier 23 on the Kerr\n                  Reservoir bridge, id. ¶¶ 123-27,\n\n                  shaft layout problems with pier 18 on the Kerr Reservoir\n                  bridge, id. ¶¶ 128-33,\n\n                  repair to a pier 2 column on bridge B643, id. ¶¶ 134-36,\n                  and\n\n                  acceleration efforts, id. ¶¶ 144-50.\n\n       Seeking damages for each of these claims, AMEC relied on Code § 33.1-387. Under the\n\nstatute, a government contractor may institute a “civil action” claiming damages “under the\n\ncontract” so long as (i) the civil action seeks only “costs and expenses” caused by VDOT, and\n\n(ii) the contractor submits its claim to VDOT “within the time and as set out” in Code\n\n§ 33.1-386, which “shall be a condition precedent” to filing suit. Only administrative claims\n\nsubmitted to VDOT, and denied by it, can be asserted in the civil action. See Commonwealth v.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      Prior to trial, the circuit court dismissed AMEC’s claim relating to Work Order 12.\nAMEC has not appealed this ruling.\n\n\n                                               -3-\n\fYeatts, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Va.</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 20, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1393441\"><a href=\"/opinion/1393441/com-dept-of-hwys-tr-v-ew-yeatts/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">717</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 719 (1987) (noting the statute authorizes a civil\n\naction “for any portion of the claim” denied by VDOT). 3\n\n        In its responsive pleadings, VDOT asserted that AMEC failed “to satisfy legal and\n\ncontractual conditions precedent to the initiation of legal action” and failed to “exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies.” Prior to trial, VDOT filed a “Motion for Leave to File Pleas in Bar.”\n\nThe pleas in bar contended that many of AMEC’s claims violated Code § 33.1-386(A), which\n\nauthorizes the assertion of an administrative claim “provided that written notice of the\n\ncontractor’s intention to file such claim shall have been given to the Department at the time of\n\nthe occurrence or beginning of the work upon which the claim and subsequent action is based.”\n\nVDOT proffered that AMEC never provided timely, written notice of its intention to file many of\n\nthe claims asserted in the civil action. 4\n\n        AMEC resisted the motion for leave on several grounds, including the assertion that the\n\npleas in bar would involve a “full blown evidentiary hearing, based on a year’s worth of\n\nvoluminous discovery, which will properly occur at trial anyway.” AMEC Brief in Response to\n\nVDOT’s Motion for Leave to File Pleas in Bar at 6. For this reason, AMEC argued, “a full and\n\nfair determination of whether notice was provided is best suited for trial.” Id. at 8.\n\n        On December 13, 2007, the circuit court held a hearing on VDOT’s motion for leave.\n\nWithout addressing the merits of the underlying pleas, the court held the motion for “leave to file\n\n\n\n        3\n         For this reason, we do not address AMEC’s allegation that VDOT breached a “duty of\ngood faith” by refusing to grant “time extensions,” by “blaming” AMEC for the lack of progress,\nby expressing “indifference” to settlement, or by rejecting AMEC’s claim “in bad faith.”\nAmended Complaint ¶¶ 137-43. AMEC did not assert a breach of any “duty of good faith” in its\nadministrative claim.\n        4\n         VDOT also asserted AMEC similarly violated a provision of the contract which VDOT\ninterpreted to require a written statement of the “claimed damage” during, but not after, the\nperiod of contract performance. See VDOT Road and Bridge Specification § 105.16.\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\fpleas in bar will be denied.” On January 23, 2008, the court entered a written order denying\n\nVDOT’s motion for leave to file the pleas in bar. 5 About a month later, the parties received a\n\nletter opinion from the circuit court addressing the merits of the pleas in bar which the court\n\nearlier held could not be filed. The letter began with a reference to “oral argument” on “July 10,\n\n2007” and ended with this conclusion: “Accordingly, the court finds that AMEC’s actual notice\n\nwas sufficient enough to satisfy the statutory and written notice provisions a[t] issue.” AMEC\n\nCivil, LLC v. Commonwealth, 74 Va. Cir. 492, 507 (2008).\n\n        With respect to the statutory written notice requirement, the circuit court held that\n\n“AMEC did not provide VDOT with written notice of its claims as required by Va. Code Ann.\n\n§ 33.1-386.” Id. at 500; see also id. at 504 (“although AMEC did not fully comply with the\n\nwritten notice requirement of Va. Code Ann. § 33.1-386”); id. at 506 (noting “AMEC’s failure to\n\nabide by the statute’s written notice provision”). AMEC’s failure to provide written notice did\n\nnot matter, the court reasoned, because VDOT had “actual notice.” Id. at 506. Actual notice,\n\nwhether written or not, satisfied the court’s “liberal construction” of the statute. Id. at 499. 6\n\n\n\n        5\n          The circuit court granted leave to VDOT to file a summary judgment motion asserting\nthat statutory and contractual written notice requirements mandated the dismissal of various\nAMEC claims. At the hearing on January 23, 2008, the court denied the motion without “ruling\non the merits,” deciding instead “to wait until trial” to resolve the contested issues. The court\nmemorialized that ruling in a written pretrial order entered February 20, 2008.\n        6\n          The court addressed the analogous contractual written notice requirement, see n.4,\nsupra, by finding that the “lack of written notice, standing alone, does not contractually preclude\nAMEC from properly bringing claims against VDOT.” AMEC, 74 Va. Cir. at 497. In the\nalternative, the court sua sponte held VDOT “implicitly waived” the contractual written notice\nrequirement, id. — a point not raised, briefed, or argued by either party. On appeal, AMEC\nconcedes “this was not an argument AMEC asserted during motion practice or trial.” AMEC\nAppellee Br. at 18 n.9 (No. 2061-08-2). “Nor does AMEC rely upon ‘waiver’ now.” Id.\n“AMEC is not asserting that any notice provisions were waived.” Id. at 15 n.7 (emphasis in\noriginal).

The\n\nadministrative claim must “set forth the facts upon which the claim is based, provided that\n\nwritten notice of the contractor’s intention to file such claim shall have been given to the\n\nDepartment at the time of the occurrence or beginning of the work upon which the claim and\n\nsubsequent action is based.” Code § 33.1-386(A) (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\f        In its pretrial ruling, the circuit court held that “AMEC did not provide VDOT with\n\nwritten notice of its claims as required by Va.

This unique notice is not a mere heads-up about an ongoing problem with the\n\ncontractor’s ability to perform. Nor is it a status report on the myriad difficulties discussed\n\nduring the management of the contract. As was true in this case, most complex government\n\ncontracts generate an avalanche of such documentation.\n\n       A written notice under Code § 33.1-386(A) differs from the mass of ordinary\n\ndocumentation by conspicuously declaring that, at least in the contractor’s view, a serious legal\n\nthreshold has been crossed. 8 Signaling discontent with the agreed contract pricing, the\n\ncontractor declares its intent to assert an administrative claim for damages that, if rejected, could\n\nresult in the assertion of a civil action against the contracting agency in the courts. Once hopeful\n\nof an on-time, on-budget, conflict-free contract, the parties find themselves traveling the path\n\ntoward litigation. Knowing when a particular dispute has started down that path can be crucial.\n\nA contracting agency may need to make difficult judgments about continued management of the\n\ncontract. And, depending on the magnitude of the dispute, the agency may also need to calibrate\n\nthe effect a threatened claim might have on its limited procurement budgets.\n\n       That said, Code § 33.1-386(A)’s written notice proviso does not require the sophistication\n\nof a legal pleading.

Only a handful\nannounced AMEC’s intention to escalate an ongoing issue into an administrative claim.

And\n\nthe dispute over payment six months earlier, while arguably timely, made the agency generally\n\naware of the contractor’s position but did not specifically “inform” the agency that the contractor\n\n“intended to claim reimbursement” for the disputed services. Id. (emphasis added). It was not\n\nenough that the contracting agency could have intuited the contractor’s intent to file a claim\n\nbased upon the nature of the dispute. The intent to file the claim had to be express, timely, and\n\nin writing. Because the statute established “mandatory, procedural requirements which must be\n\nmet in order for a court to reach the merits of a case,” id. at 238, 541 S.E.2d at 919, these\n\nomissions defeated the contractor’s civil action as a matter of law. Compare Flory, 261 Va. at\n\n       9\n         For purposes of our analysis, we assume arguendo that “minutes of a progress meeting”\ncan constitute a statutorily compliant “written notice” if the written minutes specifically record\nthe contractor’s assertion of its intent to file a claim.

See Virginia Procurement Law\nStudy of Senate Joint Resolution 148, 1979 Session, at 51 (1980) (“The language in subsection\n(a) [of former Code § 11-69] is derived from Section 33.1-386.”). We construe these two\nsynonymous provisions the same way.\n\n\n                                                - 12 -\n\f239, 541 S.E.2d at 920 (“[W]e hold that the trial court did not err in dismissing the Center’s\n\nmotion for judgment with prejudice, and we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.”), with\n\nAMEC, 74 Va. Cir. at 500 (asserting that the “Flory Court . . . held that the plaintiff’s claim\n\ncould not be dismissed for failing to comply with the written statutory notice requirement”).\n\n       Under Flory, each written notice of intent must be examined individually. “By\n\nidentifying more than one event that triggers the filing of an intent to file a claim, the statute\n\nacknowledges that not all claims will arise under the same circumstances.” Flory, 261 Va. at\n\n238, 541 S.E.2d at 919. It necessarily follows that the “timing and form” of a putative notice of\n\nintent “requires an examination of the circumstances of each case.” Id. Guided by these\n\nprinciples, we review on appeal each of AMEC’s claims that VDOT contends did not satisfy the\n\nwritten notice requirement of Code § 33.1-386(A).\n\n           Claim Involving Drilled Shaft Work\n\n       This claim involved difficulties AMEC encountered while performing the drilled shaft\n\nwork for the Kerr Reservoir bridge. Various letters and meeting minutes, some as early as 2000,\n\nshowed that AMEC and VDOT knew of problems associated with this aspect of the project. In\n\n2001, despite these concerns, AMEC began the drilled shaft work on the Kerr Reservoir bridge.\n\nAMEC waited until 2003 — two years after beginning the drilled shaft work — to provide its\n\nfirst written notice of an intention to assert a claim. By that time, AMEC had completed about\n\n85% of the drilled shaft work on the bridge.\n\n       As in Flory, the earlier exchange of documents concerning the problems with the drilled\n\nshaft work did not comply with Code § 33.1-386(A)’s requirement that the notice announce the\n\ncontractor’s intention to file an administrative claim for damages. AMEC’s 2003 written notice,\n\nwhile clearly announcing such an intention, was untimely because it came long after “the time of\n\n\n\n\n                                                 - 13 -\n\fthe occurrence or beginning of the work upon which the claim and subsequent action is based.”\n\nCode § 33.1-386(A). 11\n\n            Claim for Defects in the Drilled Shaft Concrete Specification\n\n       During the drilled shaft work, AMEC encountered problems with the concrete mix it used\n\nin an effort to comply with the applicable contractual specification. In its administrative claim,\n\nAMEC asserted the specification was defective and VDOT should have known about it. No\n\nevidence at trial, however, showed that AMEC ever provided any written notice during the\n\nperformance of the contract of an intention to later file a claim for damages caused by the\n\nallegedly defective concrete specification. 12\n\n            Claim for Concrete Formwork for Foundation Caps, Piers & Columns\n\n       In its administrative claim, AMEC sought damages for work associated with setting and\n\nstripping concrete formwork for foundation caps, piers, and columns. At no point during the\n\ncontract performance, however, did VDOT ever receive written notice of AMEC’s intention to\n\nfile independent claims for these alleged additional costs. 13\n\n\n       11\n           On appeal, VDOT also contends the circuit court erred by not barring the drilled shaft\nclaim under accord and satisfaction principles. Our holding makes it unnecessary to address this\nissue. We similarly need not pass judgment on AMEC’s assertion, or VDOT’s argument in\nrebuttal, that VDOT’s “superior knowledge” of the underlying problem (allegedly obtained from\nanother project which experienced similar problems) implied a contractual duty on VDOT’s part\nto notify AMEC of all foreseeable difficulties associated with this aspect of the project.\n       12\n          Our holding renders it unnecessary to address VDOT’s alternative argument that, even\nif AMEC had complied with Code § 33.1-386(A), no viable claim existed because the concrete\nmix requirements constituted a performance, not a design, specification.

In addition, as was the case with the drilled shaft\nclaim, we do not examine the merits or demerits of AMEC’s “superior knowledge” assertion.\nSee n.11, supra.\n       13\n         VDOT’s opening brief addressed this issue specifically. See VDOT Opening Br. at iii\n& 19-20 (No. 2061-08-2). AMEC’s brief in response does not address the issue.\n\n\n                                                 - 14 -\n\f            Claim for Pier 17 Foundation Cap Repair\n\n       In December 2002, AMEC began constructing a foundation cap for pier 17 at the Kerr\n\nReservoir bridge. Lake water leaked into the form during the concrete pour. The water\n\nweakened the concrete and rendered the foundation cap defective. AMEC eventually had to\n\ndemolish the defective cap and replace it with a new one.\n\n       At trial, an AMEC witness testified that an unidentified AMEC representative, on an\n\nunspecified date, verbally informed VDOT of AMEC’s intention to file a claim for damages\n\narising out of the extra work associated with the pier 17 foundation cap repair. VDOT denied\n\nany such conversation took place. The record contains no written notice from AMEC to VDOT\n\nthat can be reasonably interpreted as stating any intention by AMEC to file a claim based upon\n\nthe repair work to pier 17’s foundation cap. 14\n\n            Claim for Work Authorized by Work Orders 4, 6, 7 & 16\n\n       The contract anticipated the need for additional work not specified in the bid or award.\n\nWhen the need arose, the contract authorized the issuance of a work order after the parties\n\nreached agreement on what was to be done, when it would be done, and at what additional\n\ncost. 15 Over sixty work orders were issued during the project.\n\n       Work Orders 4, 6, 7, and 16 collectively authorized additional work, compensated AMEC\n\nat contractual unit prices, and extended the project completion date. When AMEC and VDOT\n\nagreed to these work orders, AMEC made no written request for any compensation other than the\n\n       14\n           VDOT also argues that, as a matter of law, AMEC failed to establish any contractual\nbasis for this claim even if it had been the subject of a timely, written notice under Code\n§ 33.1-386(A). See VDOT Opening Br. at 30-31(No. 2061-08-2). We need not decide this\nquestion given our holding.\n       15\n          The contract also authorized “force account” work in which VDOT orders the\ncontractor to perform specific tasks. See Specification § 109.05. Work Orders 4, 6, 7, and 16\nwere not “force account” orders.\n\n\n                                                  - 15 -\n\funit pricing specified in the contract. Nor did AMEC at that time communicate in writing any\n\nintention to later file a claim seeking damages related to these work orders. AMEC claimed it\n\nprovided written notice in July 2004, see Trial Ex. D-135, at 7-8, but that notice came after\n\ncommencement of the work authorized by Work Orders 4, 6, 7, and 16. 16\n\n            Claim for Acceleration Damages\n\n       On various aspects of the job, AMEC accelerated its efforts to keep on track with\n\nexpected timelines. AMEC claimed this accelerated effort began in January 2002.\n\n       In 2003, one of AMEC’s representatives engaged VDOT “in a talking process”\n\nconcerning AMEC’s acceleration efforts. The first written notice of any intention to assert an\n\nacceleration claim came in April 2004. This notice announced an intent to file a claim for\n\ndamages “incurred to date” for prior acceleration efforts (work commenced before April 2004)\n\nnot “correctly and fully addressed by Work Order No. 39.” AMEC’s later administrative claim\n\nsought damages for acceleration efforts commenced before and after the April 2004 notice.\n\n            Claim for Damages During the First Winter Period\n\n       The original contract term of performance contemplated three winter periods from 2000\n\nto 2003. Anticipating the possibility of an extension of the completion date, VDOT Road and\n\nBridge Specification § 108.09(b) provided that delays caused by “unforeseen causes” pushing\n\nwork into later winter seasons could render winter working conditions “unsuitable” for\n\ncompleting the job. If that occurred, “consideration may be given to granting an extension of\n\n\n\n\n       16\n          Work Orders 6 and 7 stated that AMEC agreed to perform “the work described herein\nand at the unit prices set forth” and that VDOT agreed to grant the extension and compensate\nAMEC on a “unit price” basis. On appeal, VDOT reasserts its accord-and-satisfaction argument\nmade at trial. See VDOT Opening Br. at 38-40 (No. 2061-08-2). We need not address this issue\ngiven our holding.\n\n\n                                               - 16 -\n\ftime that will encompass a suitable period during which such work can be expeditiously and\n\nacceptably performed.” Id. (emphasis added). 17\n\n       In March 2003, AMEC provided VDOT with written notice of its intent to claim\n\ndamages for the winter extension from November 30, 2003, to April 1, 2004 (the “first winter\n\nperiod”). This first winter period extension was necessary, AMEC stated, given the time\n\nextensions previously granted by VDOT in Work Orders 6, 7, 12, and 16. VDOT acknowledged\n\nreceipt of the written notice and directed AMEC to keep daily records of its work and actual\n\ncosts during the extension period. 18\n\n                          *       *       *      *       *       *       *\n\n       With respect to this last item, AMEC’s claim for damages during the first winter period,\n\nthe circuit court correctly held AMEC’s March 2003 written notice informed VDOT in a timely\n\nmanner of AMEC’s intent to claim damages. 19\n\n       As for AMEC’s acceleration claim, it turns on the timing and scope of the April 2004\n\nwritten notice. This notice was untimely as to acceleration efforts prior to April 2004 but timely\n\nas to acceleration efforts after April 2004 to the extent they were reasonably attributable to\n\ncontractually compensable delays not “correctly and fully addressed by Work Order No. 39.”\n\nOn remand, the circuit court should determine whether any such post-notice efforts existed\n\n       17\n       We cite to VDOT’s Road and Bridge Specifications existing at the time of the contract.\nVDOT amended these Specifications in 2007 and began using the amended version in 2008.\n       18\n          VDOT does not assert on appeal any written-notice challenge to AMEC’s claim for\ndamages arising out of the “second winter period.” Instead, VDOT challenges the “second\nwinter period” claim (as well as the first) as unrecoverable under the contract. See Part II(B),\ninfra at 23-24.\n       19\n          The same conclusion applies to VDOT’s argument that AMEC failed to provide\nwritten notice under Specification § 105.16, which similarly required written notice “at the time\nof the occurrence or beginning of the work upon which the claim and subsequent action are\nbased.” (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n                                                - 17 -\n\fconsistent with our views of the contractual compensability of AMEC’s claims. See Part II(B),\n\ninfra at 18-28.\n\n        With respect to the remaining items contested on appeal (AMEC’s claims for drilled shaft\n\nwork; drilled shaft concrete specification; concrete formwork for foundation caps, piers, and\n\ncolumns; pier 17 foundation cap repair; and Work Orders 4, 6, 7, and 16), 20 we hold the court\n\nerred as a matter of law in concluding AMEC gave timely “written notice” of its “intention to\n\nfile” a claim “at the time of the occurrence or beginning of the work upon which the claim and\n\nsubsequent action is based.” See Code § 33.1-386(A). The circuit court’s contrary conclusion\n\nfirst dispensed with the statutory requirement of written notice and then held, in the alternative,\n\nthat written notice had been given from “minutes” of meetings and “memoranda” exchanged\n\nbetween the parties. No legal precedent supports the court’s first ruling, and no evidence\n\nsupports its alternative ruling.\n\n                          B. VDOT’S CONTRACTUAL CHALLENGES\n                              TO SEVERAL OF AMEC’S CLAIMS\n\n        At trial, VDOT challenged AMEC’s recovery of damages caused by elevated lake water\n\nlevels, two winter periods, unanticipated boulders at the B640 bridge, interference from overhead\n\npower lines, and premium costs for a bond. No provisions of the contract, VDOT argued,\n\nprovided any remedy for these claims.\n\n             Damages for Elevated Lake Water Levels\n\n        Code § 33.1-387 authorizes a contractor to recover damages “under the contract.”\n\nAMEC sought, and the circuit court awarded, damages caused by elevated lake water levels in\n\n\n        20\n          At trial, VDOT either acknowledged or failed to contest AMEC’s assertions that it\nprovided timely, statutorily compliant, written notices of an intention to file claims related to\nelevated lake levels, the second winter period, boulders at bridge B640, and overhead power\nlines. VDOT has not made an issue of these claims on appeal.\n\n\n                                                - 18 -\n\fthe Kerr Reservoir. In support of this claim, AMEC relied on Specification § 104.03, entitled\n\n“Differing Site Conditions.” This provision authorized additional compensation in two\n\nsituations: first, when “subsurface or latent physical conditions” encountered during the work\n\ndiffer materially “from those indicated in the Contract” and, second, when “unknown physical\n\nconditions of an unusual nature” differ materially “from those ordinarily encountered and\n\ngenerally recognized as inherent in the work . . . .” Specification § 104.03.\n\n       Another provision of the contract, however, directly addressed the issue of fluctuating\n\nlake water levels. Under the heading “Site Information,” the contract stated:\n\n             The Contractor should be aware that due to the method of operating\n             the John H. Kerr Reservoir and other factors beyond the control of the\n             Department, the power pool elevation in the reservoir routinely\n             fluctuates by several feet. These fluctuations can take place within a\n             few days. It is the responsibility of the Contractor to avail himself of\n             the historical records of the water levels maintained by the U.S. Army\n             Corps of Engineers, Wilmington District and determine the impacts\n             possible fluctuations may have on planned construction methods and\n             operation. Information on past water levels is available through the\n             Corp’s website at http://www.saw.usace.army.mil while current and\n             predicted water elevations can be obtained by contacting the John H.\n             Kerr Powerhouse at (804) 738-6371 . . . .\n\nContract Order No. F77 at 142. 21 VDOT argued this provision precluded high lake water\n\nfluctuations from being deemed a differing site condition under Specification § 104.03.\n\n       We cannot discern from the record how the circuit court reconciled these two provisions.\n\nAMEC draws our attention to a remark from the bench on the last day of trial in which the court\n\nsaid the high water was a “major condition,” making it “very difficult to believe that anyone\n\ncould reasonably be expected to plan for a period of high water at the level this water was.” The\n\n\n\n       21\n           Specification § 103.06, entitled “Contract Documents,” provided that the “Contract\nshall include the schedule of prices submitted by the bidder, plans, standard drawings, these\nspecifications, supplemental specifications, special provisions, special provision copied notes,\nand the standard form of the Contract, all as furnished by the Department.”\n\n\n                                                - 19 -\n\fostensible clarity of that remark, however, is clouded by another statement, only a moment or\n\ntwo earlier, in which the court acknowledged: “I’m not sure there were differing site conditions\n\nor not.” And both comments were made in a soliloquy which began, “Let me give you a couple\n\nof observations because I’m still not totally pessimistic you can find a way to work this out.”\n\n       However one interprets the court’s remarks, we hold the contract defeats AMEC’s\n\nhigh-water claim as a matter of law. Specification § 104.03 authorized a recovery of costs\n\ncaused (i) by “subsurface or latent physical conditions” encountered during the work which\n\ndiffer materially “from those indicated in the contract,” or (ii) by “unknown physical conditions\n\nof an unusual nature” which differ materially “from those ordinarily encountered and generally\n\nrecognized as inherent in the work . . . .” (Emphasis added.) In the lexicon of government\n\ncontract law, the first part of § 104.03 is known as a Type I condition and the second as a Type II\n\ncondition. See generally Gerald I. Katz, Virginia General Conditions for Public Projects I-9 to\n\nI-10 (Virginia Law Foundation 1993); John Cibinic, Jr., Ralph C. Nash, Jr. & James F. Nagle,\n\nAdministration of Government Contracts 494-514 (4th ed. 2006) (reviewing parallel provision in\n\nfederal government contracts).\n\n       Both aspects of Specification § 104.03 must then be placed within the context of the Site\n\nInformation provision. This provision unmistakably informed AMEC that “factors beyond the\n\ncontrol” of VDOT caused the lake water level to “routinely” fluctuate “by several feet.” See\n\nContract Order No. F77 at 142. Inherent in the representation that fluctuations by several feet\n\nwere routine was the suggestion that non-routine fluctuations might be even higher. The Site\n\nInformation provision warned AMEC to examine the U.S. Army Corps historical records (which\n\nincluded nearly 50 years of water elevation data) to “determine the impacts possible fluctuations\n\nmay have on planned construction methods and operation.” Id. (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 20 -\n\f       When read alongside the Site Information provision, neither aspect of § 104.03 justifies\n\nthe court’s award. No Type I condition existed because the elevated lake water levels did not\n\ndiffer from any condition “indicated in the contract.” See Specification § 104.03. Only an\n\nincongruence between a contract’s representations and the realities of the worksite triggers a\n\nType I condition under § 104.03. See, e.g., Asphalt Roads & Materials v. Commonwealth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1059800\"><a href=\"/opinion/1059800/asphalt-roads-materials-v-com-dot/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Va.</span> <span class=\"page\">452</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 454, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1059800\"><a href=\"/opinion/1059800/asphalt-roads-materials-v-com-dot/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">804</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 805 (1999) (finding Type I condition where “contract drawings”\n\nbadly underestimated the specific amount of unusable soil to be removed by the contractor). The\n\nVDOT-AMEC contract established neither a baseline nor even a range of fluctuations. Instead,\n\nthe contract advised AMEC that the water level of the lake “routinely fluctuates” by several feet\n\nand directed AMEC to review the historical records to take into account non-routine “possible\n\nfluctuations” of these levels. See Contract Order No. F77 at 142. Because lake water\n\nfluctuations were “beyond the control” of VDOT, id., the contract steered clear of making any\n\nbinding representations on the subject.\n\n       No Type II condition existed either. “A Type II differing site condition is more rare than\n\nits Type I counterpart and is much more difficult to prove.” 1 Richard F. Smith, Virginia\n\nConstruction Law Deskbook ¶ 11.403, at 296 (2008); see also Cibinic, Nash & Nagel, supra, at\n\n492 (recognizing the “relatively heavy burden of proof” required to prove a Type II condition).\n\nAt best, AMEC’s evidence proved only that for a period of time the lake water rose to an unusual\n\nlevel. Standing alone, however, that fact did not authorize contractual compensation. To recover\n\ndamages, the contractor must prove “the condition was unknown, unforeseeable and unusual.”\n\nCibinic, Nash & Nagel, supra, at 509 (emphasis in original).\n\n       As Specification § 104.03 makes clear, only “unknown physical conditions” can\n\nconstitute a Type II condition. Known conditions, whether of an unusual nature or not, must be\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 21 -\n\ffactored into the contractor’s risk assessment. See, e.g., Steven W. Feldman, Government\n\nContract Guidebook § 28:8(b), at 797-98 (4th ed. 2008-09) (listing “[h]igh water level in a lake\n\nwhere work was to be performed” as a condition not included within the “Differing Site\n\nConditions” provision); Cibinic, Nash & Nagle, supra, at 486-87 (listing “flooding” and\n\n“unusually high water” as outside the scope of the “Differing Site Conditions” clause). Under\n\nthe VDOT-AMEC contract, routine and non-routine water level fluctuations presented known\n\nconditional risks associated with the worksite — both categorically placed outside the scope of a\n\nType II condition of Specification § 104.03.\n\n       In reply, AMEC argues VDOT conceded its contractual responsibility to compensate\n\nAMEC for delays attributable to high water by extending the contract completion date for this\n\nvery reason. Thus, “AMEC as a matter of logic became entitled to compensation for the delay.”\n\nAMEC Appellee Br. at 23 (No. 2061-08-2). We disagree.\n\n        VDOT issued work orders granting AMEC extra time to complete the work. The\n\nextensions protected AMEC from per diem liquidated damages under Specification § 108.12 for\n\nfailing to complete the work on time and also protected the contract from being terminated\n\nbecause of the delay. But nothing in these extension work orders, or in the contract itself,\n\nnecessarily provided AMEC with any contractual entitlement to recover damages during the\n\nperiods of extension. 22\n\n       As a general rule, “where the issue is excusable delay as opposed to compensable delay,\n\nthe government accedes, because alternatives such as default termination are not feasible or\n\n       22\n         VDOT made this point to AMEC at the time of the extensions. Work Order 39 granted\na 148-day extension with the caveat: “This time extension shall in no way be construed to mean\nthe Department will pay for any overhead cost associate[d] with the time extension.” Work\nOrder 51 repeated this qualification: “This time extension is not recognition by the Department\nof responsibility for any delays on the Project and shall in no way be construed to mean the\nDepartment will pay for any overhead cost associated with the time extension.”\n\n\n                                                - 22 -\n\fotherwise not in the government’s best interests.” Feldman, supra, § 29.11, at 827. Similarly,\n\nexcusable delay provisions generally “protect a contractor only from a default termination or\n\nliquidated damages liability. These clauses do not entitle the contractor to recover any additional\n\nperformance costs.” Glen E. Monroe, Government Contract Law Manual § 2.92, at 52 (1979).\n\n“Normally, if the delay was caused by events beyond the contractor’s control, the contractor will\n\nbe excused for the delay in performance (under the contract’s “Default” clause) but is\n\nresponsible for the additional costs caused by the delay.” Feldman, supra, § 16:1, at 488.\n\nAMEC’s view to the contrary, if it had the force of law, would badly disorient the management\n\nof government contracts. A contracting agency would be loath to grant time extensions if the\n\ninvariant consequence of doing so meant the agency thereby stipulated to inestimable damages\n\nand forfeited any right to contest the compensability of the contractor’s claim. 23\n\n            Claim for Damages During Two “Winter Periods”\n\n       The contract initially required AMEC to complete the project by November 2003. On\n\nseveral occasions, VDOT agreed to extend the deadline. The extensions collectively spanned\n\ntwo additional winters. In the circuit court, AMEC argued it had a contractual right to be\n\ncompensated for damages during these two additional winter periods.\n\n       On appeal, VDOT claims the circuit court’s general verdict included compensation for\n\neach day of both winter periods: $1,938,418 for November 30, 2003, to April 1, 2004, and\n\n       23\n           VDOT raises two additional points. VDOT argues AMEC anticipated unusual water\nlevel fluctuations by instructing its subcontractor to “design the system” for constructing\nfoundation caps so it would work if the water level increased to “15 feet above the soffit\nelevation” (about 307 feet), thus putting in place a “design parameter” belying AMEC’s later\nallegation that high water levels constituted a differing site condition. To make matters worse,\nVDOT adds, high water could not be viewed as a but-for cause in any event because AMEC’s\nengineering manager admitted at trial that AMEC could only pour foundation caps “up to about\n301” feet, a level well within the lake’s routine fluctuations. We offer no opinion on these\nassertions, preferring instead to rest our decision solely on the plain meaning of governing\ncontractual provisions.\n\n\n                                                - 23 -\n\f$1,922,530 for November 30, 2004, to April 1, 2005. AMEC disagrees, arguing that it “did not\n\nclaim, nor was it awarded, damages for the entirety of both Winter Periods, as VDOT claims.”\n\nAMEC Appellee Br. at 25 (No. 2061-08-2) (emphasis in original). AMEC asserts its evidence\n\nestablished that, “through AMEC’s efforts, the ‘Second Winter Period’ did not ultimately affect\n\nAMEC’s completion of the Project.” Id. “Thus, to the extent AMEC overcame any delay event,\n\nincluding the ‘Second Winter Period,’ AMEC did not seek compensation for that time.” Id.\n\n(emphasis in original).\n\n       The circuit court’s general verdict did not segregate either or both of the additional winter\n\nperiods from the aggregate damages awarded to AMEC. Because we reverse many of AMEC’s\n\nclaims the circuit court relied upon for its general verdict, we cannot determine how much, if\n\nany, of the damage award is attributable to either or both of the additional winter periods. We\n\ndecline to offer what, in all likelihood, could be an advisory opinion.\n\n       Suffice it to say, even when a government contract authorizes recovery of damages for\n\nwinter weather, the “contractor must demonstrate — through contemporaneous records if\n\npossible — the extent of the adverse weather and its impact on critical activities.” Feldman,\n\nsupra, § 29:7, at 821. We direct the circuit court on remand to review the evidentiary record and\n\nto make specific findings on whether AMEC proved any entitlement to damages for conditions\n\nduring either or both of the two additional winter periods. If the court finds in AMEC’s favor,\n\nthe court should identify the contractual basis for the award and make factual findings as to the\n\nspecific damages awarded. 24\n\n\n\n       24\n          On appeal, VDOT challenges the contractual compensability of AMEC’s claims to\nboth winter periods. Thus, it should not be assumed on remand that VDOT’s challenge has been\nwaived under law-of-the-case principles (as it should be with respect to AMEC’s claim related to\nboulders at bridge B640, see n.25, infra).\n\n\n\n                                                - 24 -\n\f             Claim Related to Boulders at Bridge B640\n\n        At trial, AMEC claimed it sustained damages due to drilled shaft problems and\n\nunanticipated boulders at the bridge B640 worksite. These conditions allegedly delayed work for\n\n40 days. On appeal, VDOT does not challenge the compensability of the boulders claim.\n\nInstead, VDOT contends the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to AMEC proved no\n\nmore than 8 days of delay attributable to boulders. The remainder, VDOT argues, belongs solely\n\nto delays attributable to the drilled shaft claim.\n\n        Here again, on this record, we cannot resolve this dispute on appeal given the inseverable\n\nnature of the circuit court’s general verdict. Because we find many of AMEC’s claims\n\nstatutorily barred (including the drilled shaft claim), we remand the boulders claim to the circuit\n\ncourt with instructions to examine the evidentiary record and to make specific factual findings. 25\n\nOn remand, the circuit court should apply the maxim: “[W]here there is evidence of damage\n\nfrom several causes, for a portion of which a defendant cannot be held liable, a plaintiff must\n\npresent evidence that will show within a reasonable degree of certainty the share of damages for\n\nwhich that defendant is responsible.” TechDyn Systems Corp. v.

AMEC claimed Specification § 105.07 inaccurately\n\nstated that “[e]xisting utilities” were indicated on the plans. The plans specifically noted the\n\npresence of the “footings for the power line post” near pier 1 on bridge B641 but not the lines\n\n        25\n         As for the boulders issue, AMEC’s entitlement to a recovery under the “Differing Site\nConditions” clause became law of the case when VDOT did not challenge it on appeal.\n\n\n                                                     - 25 -\n\fstrung between the power poles. After the contract was awarded, Dominion Virginia Power\n\nmoved the power pole pedestal shown on the original plans to make way for AMEC to install the\n\nroad leading to bridge B641.\n\n        In its pretrial motions and at trial, VDOT pointed out that AMEC failed to read the\n\nentirety of Specification § 105.07. Though § 105.07 anticipated that all utilities would be\n\nindicated on VDOT’s plans (presumably the poles as well as the lines between them), the\n\nprovision nonetheless placed the burden on AMEC to conduct its own pre-construction\n\ninvestigation to confirm the information in the plans:\n\n                Prior to preparing a bid, the bidder shall contact known utility\n                owners to determine the nature, extent, and location of existing,\n                adjusted, or new utility facilities. Any additional cost resulting\n                therefrom shall be reflected in the bid price for other items in the\n                Contract.\n\nSpecification § 105.07. The contract further provided: “The new location of such utilities will\n\nnot normally be shown on the plans. Some utilities may remain or be adjusted within the\n\nconstruction limits simultaneously with project construction operations.” Id. (emphasis added).\n\nThe specification required AMEC to “coordinate project construction with planned utility\n\nadjustments . . . .” Id.\n\n        As for any contractual right to damages, Specification § 105.07 expressly disclaimed\n\nVDOT’s liability for damages caused by “interference” from electrical utility lines:\n\n              Except as otherwise specified herein, the Department will not be\n              responsible for any claims for additional compensation from the\n              Contractor resulting from delays, inconvenience, or damage sustained\n              by him attributable to interference by utility appurtenances, or the\n              operation of moving the same, other than a consideration of an\n              extension of time.\n\n              If it is determined that interference by utility appurtenances caused a\n              delay of such magnitude or otherwise altered project operations so as\n              to increase significantly the Contractor’s cost of performing the work,\n\n\n\n                                                 - 26 -\n\f             the [VDOT] Engineer may consider additional compensation limited\n             to the actual costs incurred by the Contractor. The determination of\n             the severity of the interference, its impact on the Contractor’s costs,\n             and the amount, if any, of compensation shall be at the sole discretion\n             of the Engineer. . . . Nothing herein shall be construed as requiring\n             acceptance of the Contractor’s presentation or payment of additional\n             compensation.\n\n       In short, Specification § 105.07 noted that the plans should indicate the location of utility\n\nlines. AMEC does not deny the pre-construction plans depicted the location of the “power line\n\npedestal” or claim the utility lines were not readily apparent from a site visit. At trial, AMEC\n\nclaimed only that the lines themselves were not drawn in. Even assuming an insufficiency in the\n\nplans, Specification § 105.07 obligated the contractor to conduct its own investigation “to\n\ndetermine the nature, extent, and location” of the lines and to “coordinate project construction\n\nwith planned utility adjustments.” AMEC conceded that it made no effort to do so.\n\n       While VDOT reserved the “sole discretion” to provide the contractor either with an\n\nextension or compensation, Specification § 105.07 divested AMEC of any right to “additional\n\ncompensation” beyond that which VDOT has approved. For these reasons, the circuit court\n\nerred in awarding any contractual damages under Specification § 105.07 for damages AMEC\n\nallegedly sustained due to the overhead power lines near pier 1 on bridge B641.\n\n            Claim for “Bond Premium”\n\n       The circuit court awarded AMEC damages for a “bond premium.” 26 On appeal, VDOT\n\nchallenges the bond premium award as factually insupportable. 27 We have found no place in the\n\nrecord, however, where VDOT objected to the bond premium.\n\n\n       26\n          Other than a line item on a spreadsheet exhibit summarizing AMEC’s damages, no evidence\nin the record discloses what the bond was or what contractual right AMEC had to recover it as an\nelement of damages. The circuit court made no mention of it from the bench or in its letter opinions.\nWe infer the court awarded the bond premium line item, however, because the general verdict award\nnecessarily included the amount. See Modified Summary of Damages (Tr. Exhibit P-103).\n       27\n          Because VDOT does not raise the issue on appeal, we do not address whether the\ndefaulted appellate challenge to the bond premium could be analogized to the situation in Little\n                                                 - 27 -\n\f       Rule 5A:18 precludes appellants from raising for the first time on appeal “grounds\n\nasserted as a ‘basis for reversal’ of the trial court’s judgment.” Blackman v.

VDOT’S CHALLENGE TO THE TRIAL COURT’S DAMAGE AWARD\n\n       With respect to compensatory damages — both on undisputed claims and those surviving\n\nappeal — we must address VDOT’s argument that AMEC’s damage models were flawed on two\n\ndifferent levels. VDOT asserts AMEC failed to present a prima facie case for its claim for\n\nextended, unabsorbed, home office overhead costs. VDOT also argues AMEC recovered\n\nimpermissible mark-ups on its claims for reimbursement of actual costs for extra material, labor,\n\nand equipment.\n\n           Home Office Overhead Damages\n\n       AMEC’s expert included in his damage model a component for extended, unabsorbed,\n\nhome office overhead. In a pretrial in limine motion and at trial, VDOT objected to AMEC’s\n\nfailure to present any evidence that it was unable to recoup home office overhead expenses by\n\ndeploying its workforce on other revenue-producing aspects of the project.

See generally Cibinic, Nash & Nagle, supra, at 720-26; Branca & Berry,\n\nsupra, § 11:25, at 369. The overhead costs become “unabsorbed” when the contractor cannot\n\nperform other revenue-generating work to cover the lost income from the delayed work. See W.\n\nNoel Keyes, Government Contracts § 42.8, at 944-45 & nn.13 & 15 (3d ed. 2003). “When this\n\noccurs, the ‘reduced activity’ contract no longer ‘absorbs’ its share of overhead costs.” Fairfax\n\nCounty Redev., 257 Va. at 388, 514 S.E.2d at 150 (citation omitted).\n\n        Not “every instance of delay,” even if attributable to a contractual breach, entitles the\n\ncontractor to a recovery of home office overhead costs.

In those circumstances,\n\nthe contractor can still “allocate a portion of its indirect costs to that contract.” Id. at 1381.\n\n        On appeal, VDOT contends AMEC failed to offer any evidence that it could not\n\nreasonably recoup its home office overhead costs from other revenue-producing work during the\n\n\n\n\n                                                  - 29 -\n\fperiods of delay. 28 We agree. AMEC’s expert described his calculation of home office\n\noverhead in cursory terms. His trial exhibit simply did the math: first calculating the ratio of\n\nproject revenue to company revenue, applying that ratio to home office overhead, creating a per\n\ndiem rate from the resulting project attribution, and then multiplying the per diem rate by the\n\ntotal days of delay. These mathematical equations, however, relied wholly upon the unstated\n\n(and thus unproven) assumption that AMEC could not have recouped its home office overhead\n\nfrom other revenue-producing work. Neither AMEC’s expert nor any of its fact witnesses\n\naddressed this point.\n\n       The inadequacy of AMEC’s factual foundation parallels a similarly insufficient showing\n\nrejected by Lockheed. There, a contractor’s expert allocated “company-wide overhead\n\nexpenses” to the breached contract and testified that the lost revenue from the contract caused the\n\nallocated overhead to drive down the company’s overall profits. Lockheed, 259 Va. at 115, 524\n\nS.E.2d at 433. The expert did not specifically address (nor did any other evidence) whether other\n\nrevenue-producing work could have reasonably absorbed the overhead. Lockheed held the\n\nexpert’s testimony failed to establish a prima facie case for home office overhead damages:\n\n               When a breach by a party causes a delay to the ability of the other\n               party to perform, the injured party is entitled to recover, as\n               damages, unabsorbed overhead expenses. To recover such\n               damages, the injured party must show that it could not otherwise\n               recoup its pro rata home office expenses incurred during the delay\n               and it must prove the amount of these expenses with reasonable\n               certainty . . . . [T]he plaintiff is required to show that it was\n               reasonably unable to recoup its overhead costs. There is no such\n               evidence in this case.\n\n\n       28\n           VDOT’s argument on appeal goes further, contending that the evidence affirmatively\ndisproved AMEC’s entitlement for home office overhead by establishing that AMEC mobilized\nto other revenue-generating aspects of the project — thus producing earnings that fully or\npartially recouped any allegedly unabsorbed overhead.

The circuit court, therefore, erred in\n\nfinding AMEC’s evidence sufficient to support an award of home office overhead. 29\n\n            Actual Costs vs. § 109.05 Mark-Ups\n\n       Prior to trial, VDOT filed a motion in limine objecting to AMEC’s expected expert\n\ntestimony on damages. AMEC’s expert, VDOT argued, improperly calculated damages by\n\nemploying cost mark-ups under Specification § 109.05. These mark-ups included, among other\n\nthings, enhancements for “administration and profit.” The circuit court denied the motion\n\nwithout prejudice reserving all such issues for resolution at trial.\n\n       At trial, AMEC’s expert admitted his damage model used mark-ups allowed under\n\nSpecification § 109.05. That provision authorized compensation for “[e]xtra work” on a “force\n\naccount basis.” AMEC used this method in its administrative claim and expressly applied\n\n“applicable mark ups” to base labor and equipment costs. See AMEC Administrative Claim at\n\n22. A 10% mark-up was applied to AMEC’s subcontractor costs under § 109.05(f) and a 15%\n\nmark-up to AMEC’s rented equipment costs under § 109.05(d). The materials costs included a\n\n15% mark-up to cover “administration and profit” under § 109.05(c). AMEC added to its labor\n\ncosts a 70% mark-up under § 109.05(a)-(b).\n\n       VDOT renewed its objection at trial to this testimony and contested any damage award\n\nbased upon it. VDOT argued § 109.05’s “force account” pricing formula applied not to\n\ncontractual damages generally but only to “[e]xtra work” pursuant to work orders issued by\n\nVDOT during the project. AMEC’s claims for contractual damages did not seek recovery for\n\nforce-account work orders.\n\n       29\n         VDOT does not argue AMEC similarly failed to prove its worksite overhead expenses\nwere unabsorbed. We express no opinion on the matter. See generally Feldman, supra, § 29:6,\nat 817-18.\n                                           - 31 -\n\f       The circuit court rejected VDOT’s arguments without comment. The court’s general\n\nverdict adopted in full the damage figures advocated by AMEC’s expert. On appeal, AMEC\n\ndefends the circuit court’s award arguing that “Specification § 109.05 prescribes the method of\n\ncalculation.” AMEC Appellee Br. at 18 (No. 2061-08-2).\n\n       As we have already explained, AMEC failed to present a prima facie case for the\n\nrecovery of home office overhead. To the extent § 109.05’s force-account pricing formula\n\nincluded a recovery of home office overhead, the circuit court erred by awarding such damages.\n\n       We reach the same conclusion with respect to profit margins included within the mark-\n\nups allowed by § 109.05. Because AMEC’s claims did not (and could not) seek recovery on a\n\nforce-account basis, § 109.05 has no relevance. 30 Instead, AMEC’s claims stemmed either from\n\nthe Differing Site Conditions provision, § 104.03, which expressly excluded “anticipated\n\nprofits,” or from the general dispute provision, § 105.16, which twice stated, “Only actual costs\n\nfor materials, labor, and equipment will be considered.” (Emphasis added.) 31\n\n       To the extent it relied on § 109.05’s allowance of profit margin mark-ups, AMEC’s\n\ndamage model was systemically flawed. An award of actual costs includes direct costs (like the\n\nprice of materials and the wages of employees) and indirect costs (like home office overhead).\n\nSee Fairfax County Redev., 257 Va. at 388, 514 S.E.2d at 151. Actual costs exclude profit\n\nmargin mark-ups, which by definition go beyond direct and indirect expenditures. Cf. William\n\n       30\n          As AMEC correctly notes, Specification § 109.05 provided: “Extra work performed in\naccordance with the requirements of Section 104.03 will be paid for at the unit prices or lump\nsum specified in the work order.” Under § 101.02, however, “[e]xtra work” means an “item of\nwork that is not provided for in the Contract as awarded but that is found to be essential to the\nsatisfactory fulfillment of the Contract within its intended scope.” Extra work thus does not\ninclude completing, albeit under more arduous or costly conditions, an “item of work” already\nrequired by the contract.\n       31\n          The applicability, if any, of Code § 2.2-4335 to any aspect of AMEC’s delay damage\nclaims has not been addressed by AMEC or VDOT either in the circuit court or on appeal. We\nthus offer no opinion on this subject. Cf. Martin Bros. Contractors v. Va.

Based on this testimony, the circuit court accepted the Blue Book as “a standard\nused in the profession” for estimating these costs. On this record, we cannot say the court was\nplainly wrong.

Code § 33.1-387 authorizes AMEC’s civil action only on the “portion” of\n\nthe administrative claim denied by VDOT. Code § 33.1-386(A) authorizes an administrative\n\nclaim, but limits it to a recovery of “costs and expenses” under the contract. Code § 33.1-386(A)\n\nsays nothing about an allowance of prejudgment interest on contractually recoverable costs and\n\nexpenses. The general prejudgment interest statute, Code § 8.01-382, does not expressly or by\n\nnecessary implication apply to the Commonwealth. To be sure, the statutory predecessors to\n\nCode § 8.01-382 (Code of 1904, §§ 3390-91) existed when the Virginia Supreme Court said our\n\ncourts “aided by the legislature” have authorized prejudgment claims, but that no court has\n\n\n\n       33\n          Safe Deposit Co. quoted this dictum from a Wisconsin case that has since been\noverruled.

The contract limited payment of interest to situations involving an\n\nuntimely “final payment” under § 109.09 or a “partial payment” invested with an escrow agent\n\nunder § 109.07. These payments, however, involve agreed-upon contractual payments — not\n\ncontested sums asserted in the administrative claim process. The provision governing disputed\n\nadministrative claims, § 105.16, did not authorize interest on disputed claims. Even when\n\nVDOT and the contractor enter into a settlement agreement resolving a disputed administrative\n\nclaim, the payment of the settlement funds itself “will not be subject to payment of interest\n\nunless such payment is specified as a condition of the claim settlement.” Specification § 105.16.\n\n                                                 III.\n\n       In sum, we reverse in part and affirm in part the circuit court’s final order.\n\n       A.

We direct the circuit\n\ncourt on remand to recalculate its award to exclude these barred claims. 34\n\n       B. Contractual Compensabilty of Several of AMEC’s Claims.\n\n       The circuit court erred in awarding damages for AMEC’s claims related to elevated lake\n\nwater levels and interference from overhead power lines.\n\n\n       34\n           The barred claims involve the disputes concerning drilled shaft work; acceleration\nefforts prior to April 2004 and acceleration efforts after April 2004 unrelated to the alleged\ninadequacies of Work Order 39; drilled shaft concrete specification; concrete formwork for\nfoundation caps, piers, and columns; pier 17 foundation cap repair; and Work Orders 4, 6, 7, and\n16.

If the court finds in AMEC’s favor, the court should identify the\n\ncontractual basis for the award and make factual findings as to any specific damages awarded.\n\n       With respect to AMEC’s claim of damages caused by boulders at bridge B640, we direct\n\nthe circuit court on remand to review the evidentiary record and to make specific findings on\n\nwhether AMEC proved damages specifically attributable to this condition.\n\n       Applying Rule 5A:18, we affirm the circuit court’s award of damages associated with\n\nAMEC’s bond premium.\n\n       C. Calculation of AMEC’s Damages.\n\n       The circuit court erred in granting AMEC an award for home office overhead and by\n\nallowing AMEC to mark up its actual costs with either home office overhead or profit margins.\n\nWe direct the court on remand to excise such mark-ups from any damage award attributable to\n\nclaims surviving this appeal.\n\n       D. Prejudgment Interest.\n\n       We affirm the circuit court’s denial of AMEC’s request for an award for prejudgment\n\ninterest. VDOT raises no challenge on appeal to any award of post-judgment interest, and thus,\n\nwe do not address this issue.\n\n\n\n                                                        Reversed in part, affirmed in part,\n                                                        and remanded for further proceedings\n                                                        consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 36 -\n\f</pre>",
