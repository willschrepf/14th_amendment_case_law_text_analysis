INTRODUCTION\n\nThis matter comes on before this court on appeal from an\norder entered on May 1, 1998, partially dismissing this\naction pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to\nstate a claim on which relief can be granted. 1 See Doug\nGrant, Inc. v. Greate Bay Casino Corp., 3 F. Supp.2d 518\n(D.N.J. 1998). The appellants had instituted this action in\nthe Superior Court of New Jersey but the appellees r emoved\nit to the district court. Consequently, when the district\ncourt entered the Rule 12(b)(6) order it r emanded\nappellants' state-law claims that it did not addr ess to the\nSuperior Court. In view of the procedural posture of this\ncase, we treat the allegations of fact in the complaint as\ntrue, and consider them in a light most favorable to the\nappellants.2\n\nThe individual appellants are blackjack players who have\nfrequented Atlantic City casinos operated by the casino\nappellees. Of the 60 individual appellants, all but six have\ndeveloped card-counting skills for playing blackjack\nenabling them to reduce or eliminate the nor mal odds in\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. In our extensive Introduction and at other places in our opinion, we\nessentially have tracked the district court's compr ehensive opinion. We\nalso note that the Supreme Court of New Jersey in Campione v. Adamar\nof N. J., Inc., 714 A.2d 299, 301, 305-06 (N.J. 1998), discussed the\ncountermeasures the New Jersey Casino Control Commission has\nallowed the casinos to take against card-counters. Of course, the\ncasinos' use of these countermeasures is at the heart of this case.\n\n2. Inasmuch as the complaint references and relies on the content of\ncertain documents, we consider them on this appeal. See Churchill v.\nStar Enter., 183 F.3d 184, 190 n.5 (3d Cir. 1999); Rose v. Bartle, 871\nF.2d 331, 339 n.3 (3d Cir. 1989). Indeed, this case is unusual as the\nappendix consists of four volumes and thus is of a length which might\nbe expected on an appeal from a summary judgment rather than on\nappeal from a motion to dismiss.\n\n                               4\n\ffavor of the casinos and, indeed, to turn the odds in their\nfavor. The corporate appellants are associated with\nappellant Doug Grant, Inc., a New Jersey corporation,\nwhose predecessor corporations operated car d-counting\nschools and mock casinos established by the appellant,\nDoug Grant, a renowned card-counter . Doug Grant, Inc.\nalso provided the training for several cooperative player\ngroups, including many of the appellants her e, who pooled\ntheir financial resources and agr eed to share their\nblackjack winnings.\n\nA. The Play of Blackjack, Card-Counting and Shuffling-\n       At-Will and Other Countermeasur es\n\nThe gravamen of appellants' complaint is that the casinos\nhave taken countermeasures that the appellants regard as\nillegal to eliminate the advantage that a skilled card-\ncounter may have over them in playing blackjack, the one\ncasino game in which a player's skill may incr ease his\nchance of winning to the point of eliminating the winning\nodds in favor of the \"house.\" See Campione v. Adamar of N.\nJ., Inc., 714 A.2d 299, 301 (N.J. 1998). Car d-counters use\nintellect and memory to identify the time during the course\nof play when a player's odds of winning are better or worse.\nThus, the individual appellants allege that the casinos have\nimpaired their ability to win money from the casinos in\nblackjack. The corporate appellants allege that their schools\nand mock casinos were forced to close as a result of the\ncasinos' countermeasures against car d-counters, and\nbecause of bomb threats, break-ins, destruction of\nproperty, theft of student lists, stalking and other\nintimidation tactics.\n\nIt is necessary for us partially to describe how blackjack\ngames are run in order to put appellants' allegations in\ncontext. Blackjack is played with decks containing 52 cards\nof four suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades) with\neach suit containing 13 cards (Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10,\n9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2). See N.J.A.C. S 19:46-1.17. Before a\nblackjack game starts, the dealer receives one or more,\nusually between six to eight, card decks fr om a casino\nsupervisor and inspects them in the presence of the\nfloorperson. See id. S 19:47-2.4(a). After inspecting the\ncards, the dealer takes them to a blackjack table and\n\n                               5\n\fspreads them out in a fan, face upward, for visual\ninspection by the first player or players to arrive at the\ntable. See id. S 19:47-2.4(b). After these players are afforded\nan opportunity to inspect the cards, the dealer turns them\nface downward on the table, mixes them thor oughly, and\nshuffles them until they are \"randomly intermixed.\" The\ndealer then places the cards into a stack. See id. S 19:47-\n2.4(c); id. S 19:47-2.5(a). After the shuffling is completed,\nthe dealer asks the player seated at a particular position at\nthe table, as defined by the regulations of the Casino\nControl Commission (\"CCC\"), the casino r egulatory agency,\nid. 19:47-2.5(e), to cut the deck. See id. S 19:47-2.5(b). The\nplayer cuts the deck by placing a plastic cutting card in the\nstack at least ten cards from either end. See id. S 19:47-\n2.5(c).\n\nOnce the player has inserted the cutting car d, the dealer\ntakes all the cards in front of the cutting card and places\nthem at the back of the stack. See id. S 19:47-2.5(d). The\ndealer then takes the entire stack of shuffled cards and\ncuts and aligns it along the side of the dealing shoe which\nhas a mark on its side enabling the dealer to insert the\ncutting card so that it is in a position \"at least\napproximately\" one-quarter of the way fr om the back of the\nstack. See id. S 19:47-2.5(d); id. S 19:46-1.19(d)(4). The\ndealer then inserts the stack of cards into the dealing shoe\nfor commencement of play. See id. S 19:47-2.5(d). The cards\nbehind the cutting card will not be used during the game.\n\nOnce play has commenced the dealer deals the car ds to\nthe players in a series of hands until the dealer r eaches the\ncutting card. When the dealer reaches the cutting card, the\ndealer repeats the shuffling process and cutting procedures\ndescribed above. See id. S 19:47-2.5(h).\n\nA blackjack player's object is to reach as close as possible\nto a total card value of 21 without exceeding that value. A\nplayer exceeding 21 loses regardless of the dealer's\nsubsequently acquired hand. Persons in the casino\nindustry and card-counters have come to r ecognize that, in\na player's endeavor to reach a value as close as possible to\n21, certain cards are more favorable to the player and\ncertain cards are more favorable to the dealer. In particular,\nappellants assert that the Ace, King, Queen, Jack and Ten\n\n                               6\n\fare favorable to a player, but the 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2 are\nfavorable to the dealer and thus to the house. The 7, 8, and\n9 are said to be neutral. At any point during the play, the\ncards in a shoe can contain more player -favorable cards or\nmore dealer-favorable cards. When there are more player-\nfavorable cards, a player's chances of winning are increased\nbut when there are more dealer -favorable cards, the\ndealer's chances of winning are increased. Whether and\nwhen a shoe will turn out to be player - or dealer-favorable\nis purely random.\n\nCard-counters attempt to \"count cards\" to determine\nwhether and when a shoe is player-favorable. They then\nvary their bets, i.e., betting high when the shoe is player-\nfavorable and low when the shoe is dealer-favorable to\nincrease their chances of having a winning r ound of play.\nBets are placed before each individual r ound of blackjack,\nusually within established minimum and maximum limits\nfor the table. According to the appellants, successful card-\ncounting contains several basic elements including the\nassignment of a point value to each card, maintaining a\nrunning total of those points during play, betting strategies,\nplaying strategies, money management, a sufficient\nbankroll, and \"the intangible ability to consistently apply\nthese interrelated strategies under fast-paced casino\nconditions.\" See app. at 24.\n\nFor maximum advantage, card-counters need to be able\nto view, through the rounds of play, as many of the cards\nin the shoe as possible. The greater number of cards they\nare able to view, the easier it is for them to determine to\nwhom the remaining cards in the shoe ar e favorable. For\nthis reason, card-counters prefer that the dealer place the\ncutting card toward the end of the shoe, leaving a small\nnumber of cards behind the cutting-card and increasing\nthe overall number of cards in play. Car d-counters also\nprefer to have the entire shoe of car ds played. If the dealer\nreshuffles prior to reaching the cutting card, then the card-\ncounters' opportunity to bet high on a shoe with a\nremainder of mostly player-favorable car ds is impaired.\n\nThe casinos, on the other hand, prefer to decr ease the\ncard-counters' opportunity to bet high on a player-favorable\nshoe. Therefore, it is in their inter est to decrease the card-\n\n                               7\n\fcounters' chances of determining whether a shoe is player-\nfavorable by playing with fewer cards in the shoe, i.e.,\nplacing the cutting card as far from the back of the stack\nas permitted by the CCC regulations. It is also in the\ncasinos' interest to reshuffle prior to reaching the cutting\ncard when the remaining cards in a shoe are player-\nfavorable. These practices, however, come at a cost to the\ncasino as the more often the dealer goes thr ough the\nmeticulous shuffling process, the shorter the actual time of\nplay and thus the smaller the casino's profits.\n\nAppellants allege that the casinos maintain car d-counting\nteams and/or video and computer surveillance equipment\nto identify card-counters and inform the dealers of their\nparticipation in a blackjack game so that the dealers can\ntake countermeasures against them. Appellants challenge\nthese practices, claiming they violate the New Jersey\n\"cheating games\" section in the Casino Contr ol Act, N.J.\nStat. Ann. S 5:12-115 (West 1996), which provides that it\nshall be unlawful:\n\n       Knowingly to deal, conduct, carry on, operate or expose\n       for play any game or games played with cards . . .\n       which have in any manner been marked or tamper ed\n       with, or placed in a condition, or operated in a manner,\n       the result of which tends to deceive the public or tends\n       to alter the normal random selection of characteristics\n       or the normal chance of the game which could\n       determine or alter the result of the game.\n\nThe appellants make several specific allegations to\nsupport their claims. See Doug Grant, 3 F . Supp.2d at 524-\n25. First, they argue that the card-counter identifying\nprocess fundamentally is flawed because it tends unfairly to\nmisidentify non-card-counters as card-counters. They claim\ncasinos define card-counters as (1) any patr on who\nincreases a bet during a player-favorable count, or (2) any\npatron who knows or is related to someone who has\nincreased a bet during a player-favorable count. According\nto appellants, a player the casino identifies as a card-\ncounter is \"branded for life\" and never is able to play a\n\"fair\" game of blackjack without being subjected to\ncountermeasures. The casinos allegedly share information\nabout suspected card-counters through defendant Griffin\n\n                                8\n\fInvestigations and other similar agencies. These agencies\nallegedly keep dossiers containing the pictur es of suspected\ncard-counters which casino employees then use to spot\ncard-counters for the purpose of knowing when to\nimplement countermeasures.\n\nSecond, appellants claim that the casinos utilize what\nthey term the \"cheating-at-will\" pr eferential shuffle and\nwhich, as codified by the CCC regulations, generally is\nknown as the \"shuffle-at-will.\" A dealer r eshuffling prior to\nreaching the cut-card marker shuffles-at-will. A casino will\nshuffle in this manner when its card-counting team\ndetermines that the shoe is player-favorable at a table\nwhere it suspects card-counters ar e playing. Appellants\nallege that the shuffle-at-will provides an extra 2%\nadvantage to the casino, nearly double its nor mal chance of\nwinning, and thus providing the casinos with a windfall of\nmillions of dollars. Id. at 525. They also claim that a casino\ncan shuffle-at-will abusively to the disadvantage of players\nwho are not card-counters by shuffling-at-will even when\nits employees do not suspect that there is a card-counter\nplaying at a table. Id.\n\nAppellants recount specific instances in which individual\nappellants allegedly were subjected to shuffling-at-will by\nspecific casinos throughout the past ten years. On some,\nbut not all, of these occasions, the player r eported the\nshuffle-at-will to the CCC and/or the New Jersey\nDepartment of Gaming Enforcement (\"DGE\") official on-site\nat every casino. According to appellants, the casinos never\nhave responded to such complaints by admitting to\ncounting cards and shuffling during a player -favorable\ncount. Id.\n\nAppellants also allege that because they have been\nidentified as card-counters, they are limited to one wager at\na time, are refused cards, have bets pushed back, and are\nforced to bet below the original posted limit at the table. Id.\nMoreover, they allege that \"shills\" associated with the\ncasinos sometimes occupy all seats at tables at which they\nwish to play. Id. The appellants allege that they have been\ntreated in these adverse ways even though players who are\nnot card-counters are not so treated.\n\n                               9\n\fAppellants also claim that the casinos have denied them\nhospitality \"comps,\" such as meals, after identifying them\nas card-counters. Id. Finally, appellants allege that they\nhave been threatened, assaulted and stalked because of\ntheir suspected card-counter status. Id. They allege that\nthey have been threatened in person while at the casinos\nby both known and unknown casino employees and that\nthey have been threatened and sent pornographic materials\nover the Internet by unnamed John Does allegedly\nconnected to the casinos. Id.\n\nB. The Casino Control Act and CCC Regulations\n\nThe New Jersey Casino Control Act, N.J. Stat. Ann.\nS 5:12-1 et seq. (West 1996) (the \"Act\"), gives the CCC\ncomprehensive authority to define and r egulate the rules\nand conduct of play for blackjack and other authorized\ncasino games. See Campione, 714 A.2d at 304; Uston v.\nResorts Int'l Hotel, Inc., 445 A.2d 370, 372-73 (N.J. 1982).\nIt also grants the CCC \"exclusive jurisdiction\" over the\ninterpretation and enforcement of r egulations governing \"all\nmatters delegated to it or within the scope of its powers\nunder the provisions of [the Act].\" N.J. Stat. Ann. S 5:12-\n133b; see also id. 5:12-69, 70. That jurisdiction delegates\nto the CCC the power to promulgate regulations regarding\nthe rules of casino games, including blackjack, id. SS 5:12-\n69-70f, gambling related advertising, id. S 5:12-70o, and the\nenforcement of gaming regulations, including the\ninvestigation, adjudication, and punishment of r egulatory\nviolations, id. SS 5:12-63b, f, g;id. S 5:12-64; id. S 5:12-129.\n\nThe regulations governing blackjack ar e exhaustive and\nset forth in great detail the rules for the conduct of the\ngame. See N.J.A.C. S 19:47-2.1 et seq. Indeed, the New\nJersey Supreme Court has stated that, \"[i]t is no\nexaggeration to state that the Commission's r egulation of\nblackjack is more extensive than the entir e administrative\nregulation of many industries.\" Uston , 445 A.2d 373. The\nCCC is very aware of the card-counter controversy. As the\nparties have recognized, the CCC carefully has considered\nand addressed in its regulatory capacity the effect card-\ncounters can have on the game and the ways in which\ncasinos should be permitted to respond to professional\ncard-counters. See, e.g., 14 N.J. Reg. 467-70 (May 17,\n\n                               10\n\f1982); 14 N.J. Reg. 559-69 (June 7, 1982); 14 N.J. Reg.\n841 (Aug. 2, 1982); 23 N.J. Reg. 1784 (June 3, 1991); 23\nN.J. Reg. 2613 (Sept. 3, 1991); 23 N.J. Reg. 3350 (Nov. 4,\n1991); 23 N.J. Reg. 3354 (Nov. 4, 1991); 25 N.J. Reg. 3953\n(Sept. 7, 1993); 25 N.J. Reg. 5521 (Dec. 6, 1993). The CCC\nregulations authorize the casinos to use certain\ncountermeasures to prevent car d-counters from overcoming\nthe statistical advantage that is necessary to ensur e the\ncasinos' financial viability.\n\nThe CCC adopted many of its regulations authorizing\ncountermeasures in response to the New Jersey Supreme\nCourt's ruling in Uston, 445 A.2d 370, a case considering\nwhether casinos have the authority to exclude car d-\ncounters from their premises. The court determined that\ncasinos were not authorized to exclude car d-counters,\nreasoning that the Act gave the CCC exclusive and plenary\nauthority to set the rules and methods of play of casino\ngames and that the CCC had not authorized the exclusion\nof card-counters as a countermeasur e.3 The court\nsuggested, however, that if the CCC wanted to approve\nmeasures to neutralize the card-counter threat, it might be\nable to exclude card-counters, provided that the regulation\ndid not violate constitutional or statutory limits. Uston, 445\nA.2d at 375-76.\n\nYet, prior to Uston, the CCC had codified a practice which\nthe casinos used as a card-counter counter measure even\nthough the CCC did not promulgate it for that purpose.\nThis regulation provides that: \"[a] casino licensee, in its\ndiscretion\" may permit a player to\"wager on [more than]\none box at a Blackjack table.\" N.J.A.C. S 19:47-2.14. The\nCCC had been allowing the use of this practice against\ncard-counters through its approval of casinos' internal\ncontrol pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. S 5:12-99. The rule\nspecifically grants casinos discretion to allow players\n(usually non-card-counters) to bet on mor e than one box,\nand presumably, in light of the discretionary language,\nallows them to preclude card-counters fr om betting on\nmore than one box.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. It appears that prior to Uston the casinos on at least some occasions\nexcluded card-counters and did so with \"overwhelming force.\" See State\nv. Sanders, 448 A.2d 481, 485 (N.J. Super . Ct. App. Div. 1982).\n\n                                11\n\fAfter Uston, the CCC held a series of hearings on the\nissue of card-counters and decided to enact r egulations\nauthorizing the casinos to use certain measur es to\nneutralize the potential negative effect car d-counters could\nhave on their financial viability. See Campione, 714 A.2d at\n305. The new regulations, which the New Jersey Supreme\nCourt urged the CCC to consider in lieu of allowing the\ncasinos to exclude card-counters, balanced the statutory\ngoals of casino viability and fair odds to all players. See\nN.J. Stat. Ann. S 5:12-100e. The CCC intended the\nregulations to ensure both the fair ness and integrity of\ncasino gambling and \"the right of the casinos to have the\nrules drawn so as to allow some reasonable pr ofit.\" Uston,\n445 A.2d at 376; see also 14 N.J. Reg. 560-61 (June 7,\n1982); 23 N.J. Reg. 1784 (June 3, 1991).\n\nSeveral of these countermeasures involved the manner by\nwhich casinos could shuffle the blackjack car ds. The first\napproved shuffling method is known as the\"Bart Carter\nShuffle,\" a \"shuffling procedur e in which approximately one\ndeck of cards is shuffled after being dealt, segregated into\nseparate stacks and each stack is inserted into pr emarked\nlocations within the remaining decks contained in the\ndealing shoe.\" N.J.A.C. S 19:47-2.1; see also 14 N.J. Reg.\n559 (June 7, 1982); 14 N.J. Reg. 841 (Aug. 2, 1982). The\nCCC also approved the \"shuffle-at-will,\" which we have\ndescribed above, to allow the casinos to shuffle after any\nround of play. To implement this appr oval, the CCC\namended the existing shuffle regulation by adding language\nregarding the casinos' authority to shuffle \"after each round\nof play\":\n\n        (a) Immediately prior to commencement of play, after\n       any round of play as may be determined by the casino\n       licensee and after each shoe of cards is dealt, the\n       dealer shall shuffle the cards so that they are randomly\n       intermixed.\n\n       . . .\n\n        (h) A reshuffle of the cards in the shoe shall take\n       place after the cutting card is reached in the shoe . . .\n       except that:\n\n                               12\n\f        1. The casino licensee may determine aft er each\n       round of play that the cards should be r eshuffled;\n\n        2. When the `Bart Carter Shuffle' is util ized a\n       reshuffle shall take place after the car ds in the discard\n       rack exceed approximately one deck in number .\n\nN.J.A.C. S 19:47-2.5; see 14 N.J. Reg. 559 (June 7, 1982),\n14 N.J. Reg. 841 (Aug. 2, 1982).\n\nThe CCC also has approved the use of a device known as\nthe continuous shuffling shoe. In place of the dealing and\nshuffling requirements set forth in N.J.A.C. 19:47-2.5 and\n2.6, a casino licensee may utilize a dealing shoe or other\ndevice designed to reshuffle the cards automatically,\nprovided that the CCC or its authorized designatee has\napproved such shoe or device and the pr ocedures for\ndealing and shuffling the cards through the use of this\ndevice. See N.J.A.C. S 19:47-2.21; see also 14 N.J. Reg. 559\n(June 7, 1982), 14 N.J. Reg. 841 (Aug. 2, 1982).\n\nThe shuffling regulations, particularly the most\ncommonly used shuffle-at-will, have enabled the casinos to\nlessen the card-counters' ability to deter mine whether cards\nremaining in the shoe are player-favorable. As we already\nhave noted, when the cards are reshuffled continuously or\nprior to the dealer reaching the cutting-car d in the shoe,\ncard-counters lose their potential advantage over the\ncasinos because they no longer can increase their bets,\nsecure in the knowledge that their chance of r eceiving\nplayer-favorable cards has been incr eased.\n\nThe CCC also authorized one non-shuffling\ncountermeasure after the Uston decision--an increase in\nthe number of decks casinos are allowed to use in\nblackjack play. See N.J.A.C. S 19:47-2.2. This change\nhelped the casinos combat card-counters by incr easing the\nnumber of cards card-counters would need to track to\ndetermine whether a shoe was player-favorable. Plainly, the\nmore cards in the shoe, the more difficult a player's task is\nto keep track of the cards.\n\nAfter the CCC authorized these initial counter measures,\nin 1991 it approved another regulation which provides that:\n\n                                13\n\f        [A] casino licensee may at any time change the\n       permissible minimum or maximum wager at a table\n       game, without notifying the Commission of such\n       change, upon posting a sign at the gaming table\n       advising patrons of the new permissible minimum or\n       maximum wager and announcing the change to\n       patrons who are at the table.\n\nN.J.A.C. S 19:47-8.3(c); see also 23 N.J. Reg. 1784 (June 3,\n1991); 23 N.J. Reg. 2613 (Sept. 3, 1991); 23 N.J. Reg. 3350\n(Nov. 4, 1991); 23 N.J. Reg. 3354 (Nov. 4, 1991). This\nregulation gives the casinos the authority to lower the\nbetting limit whenever it identifies a car d-counter so that\nthe card-counter will not be able to bet high when the shoe\nbecomes player-favorable. Then, in 1993, the CCC made a\nfurther addition to its regulations which, as further\namended in 1999, provides:\n\n       (b) A casino licensee may offer:\n\n       1. Different maximum wagers at one gaming table for\n       each permissible wager in an authorized game; and\n\n       2. Different maximum wagers at dif ferent gaming\n       tables for each permissible wager in an authorized\n       game.\n\n       (c) A casino licensee shall provide notice of the\n       minimum and maximum wagers in effect at each\n       gaming table, and any changes thereto, in accor dance\n       with N.J.A.C. 19:47-8.3.\n\n       (d) Notwithstanding (c) above, a casino licensee may, in\n       its discretion, permit a player to wager below the\n       established minimum wager or above the established\n       maximum wager at a gaming table.\n\n       (e) Any wager accepted by a dealer which is in excess\n       of the established maximum permitted wager at that\n       gaming table shall be paid or lost in its entir ety in\n       accordance with the rules of the game, notwithstanding\n       that the wager exceeded the current table maximum or\n       was lower than the current table maximum.\n\nN.J.A.C. 19:47-8.2(b) to (e); see 25 N.J. Reg. 3953 (Sept. 7,\n1993); 25 N.J. Reg. 5521 (Dec. 6, 1993). This r egulation\n\n                               14\n\fclarified that the casinos could limit specifically the wagers\nof only those patrons identified as car d-counters, while\npermitting non-card-counters to continue betting at higher\nlimits.\n\nThe New Jersey courts seem not to doubt the legality of\nthe CCC-authorized countermeasures. In particular, the\ntrial court in Campione recognized that the practice of\n\"shuffling at will,\" the central concer n in this case identified\nby the district court, is authorized by CCC r egulation, see\nN.J.A.C. S 19:47-2.5, and affects all patrons, even those not\ncounting cards, at a blackjack table. See Campione v.\nAdamar of N. J., Inc., 643 A.2d 42, 50-51 (N.J. Super. Ct.\nLaw Div. 1993), rev'd on other gr ounds, 694 A.2d 1045 (N.J.\nSuper. Ct. App. Div. 1997), mod. and af f 'd, 714 A.2d 299\n(N.J. 1998). Further, on appeal in Campione, the New\nJersey Superior Court, Appellate Division, found that the\nCCC \"authorizes the disparate treatment of card-counters.\"\n694 A.2d at 1050. The court noted that the CCC has\napproved the countermeasures allowing for betting limits\nand permitting casinos to vary the number of boxes in\nwhich particular players can wager. Id. at 1047. Finally, the\nNew Jersey Supreme Court in Campione, while not\nexpressly upholding the countermeasur es the CCC has\nallowed, implicitly made it clear the CCC lawfully may\npermit such countermeasures. 714 A.2d at 305, 308.\n\nII. JURISDICTION\n\nThe complaint in this action alleged violations of the\nUnited States Constitution, 42 U.S.C. S 1983, and the\nfederal RICO statute, as well as causes of action under the\nNew Jersey RICO statute, constitution and common law.\nThus, the district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.\nSS 1441, 1331, and 1367. We have jurisdiction pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. S 1291.\n\nIII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nOur review of a district court's order of dismissal of a\ncomplaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for failur e to state a\nclaim upon which relief may be granted, is plenary and we\napply the same test as the district court. See Maio v. Aetna,\n\n                               15\n\fInc., 221 F.3d 472, 481 (3d Cir. 2000). Thus, \"[a] motion to\ndismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) may be granted only if,\naccepting all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as\ntrue, and viewing them in the light most favorable to\nplaintiff, plaintiff is not entitled to relief.\" Id. at 481-82.\nHowever, while our standard of r eview requires us to accept\nas true all factual allegations in the complaint,\"we need\nnot accept as true `unsupported conclusions and\nunwarranted inferences.' \" City of Pittsburgh v. West Penn\nPower Co., 147 F.3d 256, 263 n.13 (3d Cir . 1998) (quoting\nSchuylkill Energy Res., Inc. v. Pennsylvania Power & Light\nCo., 113 F.3d 405, 417 (3d Cir. 1997)). \"[C]ourts have an\nobligation in matters before them to view the complaint as\na whole and to base rulings not upon the presence of mere\nwords but, rather, upon the presence of a factual situation\nwhich is or is not justiciable. We do draw on the allegations\nof the complaint, but in a realistic, rather than a slavish,\nmanner.\" Id. at 263.\n\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nA. RICO Claims\n\nAppellants' first count alleges claims for racketeering\nunder federal RICO, 18 U.S.C. S 1964(c), New Jersey RICO,\nN.J. Stat. Ann. S 2C:41-4c (West 1995), and the RICO\nprovisions of the Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. S 5:12-127c (West\n1996). As appellees point out, the predicate acts of alleged\nracketeering on which appellants' base their RICO claims\nconsist almost exclusively of the use of counter measures or\nalleged violations of other CCC regulations. In order to\nmake out a RICO claim, appellants first must show that the\ncasinos committed the predicate criminal acts enumerated\nby RICO. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. SS 1961, 1962. Appellants\nclaim that the casinos committed the following pr edicate\nacts: shuffling-at-will when the count was player -favorable,\nusing computer and video technology to assist in counting\ncards and identifying card-counters, denying comps to\nappellants, using shills, limiting plaintiffs to one hand of\nblackjack at a time, lowering betting limits, and failing to\ndisclose the use and nature of the disputed\ncountermeasures. See br. 30-41; Doug Grant, 3 F. Supp.2d\nat 531-32. Based on the premise that these uses of\n\n                               16\n\fauthorized countermeasures and other alleged regulatory\nviolations are criminal acts, appellants' complaint alleges\nthat the casinos' operation of blackjack violates criminal\nstatutes regarding unlawful debt collection, transmission of\ngambling information, operation of illegal gambling\nbusiness, and interstate commerce for an unlawful activity.\n\nThe district court believed that the primary purported\npredicate act on which appellants relied is the shuffling of\ncards when the count is favorable to the players.4 The\ncomplaint alleges that use of the \"shuffling-at-will\"\ncountermeasure constitutes a predicate act of racketeering\nbecause it violates the criminal casino \"cheating\" statute,\nN.J. Stat. Ann. S 5:12-115. The trial court in Campione\nrejected this precise claim. Campione , 643 A.2d at 51\n(\"labeling of the shuffling at will as `cheating' is specious\").\nMoreover, despite appellants' pr otestations, the regulation\nitself makes clear that a casino at its discr etion may shuffle\nat the conclusion of any round of play:\n\n       (a) Immediately prior to commencement of play, after\n       any round of play as may be determined by the casino\n       licensee and after each shoe of cards is dealt, the\n       dealer shall shuffle the cards so that they are randomly\n       intermixed.\n\n       . . .\n\n       (h) A reshuffle of the cards in the shoe shall take place\n       after the cutting card is reached in the shoe as\n       provided in N.J.A.C. 19:47-2.6(1) except that:\n\n        1. The casino licensee may determine after each\n       round of play that the cards shall be r eshuffled.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. In their brief, the appellants contend that the district court was\nincorrect in this characterization, as their\"central concern is the\ndeceptive, unadvertised and clandestine use of countermeasures only\nwhen the cards favor players.\" See br. at 31. We will not linger on this\npoint for two reasons. First, the casinos take their countermeasures\nquite openly. For example, it should be appar ent to anyone at a table\nwhen the dealer shuffles before the cutting card is reached. Second, it\nseems clear that, as the district court recognized, the principal\ncountermeasure is shuffling-at-will.\n\n                               17\n\fN.J.A.C. S 19:47-2.5(a), (h).\n\nAppellants attempt at length to skew the plain meaning\nof this regulation and the relevant r egulatory history\nleading to its adoption to convince us that the CCC has\nauthorized only a \"random shuffle-at-will,\" i.e., not a\nreshuffle that occurs only during player favorable counts.\nSee br. at 33. Appellants' restrictive interpretation of the\nshuffle-at-will regulation, however, runs contrary to its\nexpress language.\n\nThe regulatory history makes clear that the CCC is fully\naware of and allows the practice of shuffling-at-will when\nthere is a player-favorable count as a countermeasure\nagainst card-counters. When the CCC published the\nproposed regulation to allow the casinos to shuffle-at-will,\nit noted that the casinos might shuffle when the count is\nfavorable and that this practice might affect the odds of the\ngame:\n\n       The economic impact of this proposed amendment\n       would vary depending on when in fact the car ds were\n       shuffled. For example, if the cards wer e always shuffled\n       after the first round of play regar dless of the point\n       count, then the casino advantage against the basic\n       strategy player and average player would probably\n       remain the same with the advantage enjoyed by the\n       card counter being decreased. If the car ds, however,\n       were only shuffled in positive point count situations\n       and not in negative point count situations, the casino\n       advantage against all types of players would incr ease.\n\n14 N.J. Reg. 470 (May 17, 1982).\n\nAppellants appear to take issue with the propriety of the\nshuffle-at-will regulation. But even assuming that in this\naction we should entertain a challenge to the r egulation, we\nperceive nothing illegal in it.5 In any event, even if the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. There have been numerous state administrative and judicial\nproceedings regarding the issues before us but it is difficult from the\nparties' briefs and appendix to discern their exact status. In any event,\nwe do not find any state determination inconsistent with the result we\nreach. Significantly, the parties are in agreement that shortly after\n\n                                18\n\fregulation is an improper exercise of the CCC's authority,\na conclusion that we reject, a casino following it before its\ninvalidation hardly could be subject to RICO liability for\nthat conduct. In our view, a casino does not commit a\npredicate RICO act when it engages in conduct the CCC\nexpressly permits.\n\nWe are disturbed that appellants have couched their\narguments in dramatic hyperbole obfuscating the real\nissues. Indeed, we are satisfied that the appellants have\nmischaracterized the facts. For instance, appellants\ncharacterize the use of the shuffle-at-will as\"secretly\nremoving cards from a blackjack game in progress.\" See br.\nat 30. But the reshuffle is hardly secr et as the dealer does\nit openly in the view of the players. Moreover , a dealer\nreshuffling does not remove cards from the deck. Rather,\nthe reshuffle simply places the cards in a different random\norder for the next hands.\n\nAppellants further allege that the shuffle-at-will is a RICO\ncriminal predicate act because it has a tendency to alter the\nnormal random chance of the game. See br. at 32-39. What\nappellants fail to realize, however, is that the normal\nrandom chance of the game is defined pursuant to the\nstatutory rules and CCC regulations. As the CCC has\nexplained:\n\n       [T]he normal chance and random character of any\n       casino game is necessarily defined and deter mined by\n       the rules governing the conduct of the game. Since the\n       Commission has the statutory authority to initially\n       establish the rules of the game, N.J.S.A. S 5:12-100e\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nappellants filed this action, the individual appellants \"filed a petition\nwith the CCC with claims identical to those raised in the federal\ncomplaint.\" See appellants' br. at 4; appellees' br. at 5-6. In addition,\nthe\nindividual appellants later filed a declaratory petition with the CCC\nseeking its \"interpretive ruling on pr ovisions of the Act, blackjack\nregulations and casino practices that ar e at issue in this appeal.\" See\nappellants' br. at 6; appellees' br. at 6. Apparently, appellants were not\nsatisfied with the outcome of the declaratory petition, see 31 N.J. Reg.\n555 (Feb. 16, 1999), as they have appealed fr om the determination to the\nNew Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division.\n\n                               19\n\f       and 70f, and primary jurisdiction to resolve any issues\n       concerning interpretation of the Act and the rules\n       promulgated thereunder, . . . it is absurd to allege that\n       practices approved by the Commission as being\n       consistent with its rules constitute `cheating' under\n       section 115 of the Act.\n\n31 N.J. Reg. 556 (Feb. 16, 1999). While appellants may\nwish to have the CCC rethink the scope of the shuffle-at-\nwill regulation, we are satisfied that after being stripped of\nits conclusory legal dressing, there is no allegation in the\ncomplaint regarding reshuffling sufficient to support a\nRICO claim against the casino defendants.\n\nAppellants' other alleged predicate acts ar e similarly\ninsufficient to support a RICO claim. The alleged violations\nof criminal statutes regarding unlawful debt collection, 18\nU.S.C. S 1962, transmission of gambling infor mation, 18\nU.S.C. S 1084, interference with commerce by threats or\nviolence, 18 U.S.C. S 1951, interstate commer ce for\nunlawful activity, 18 U.S.C. S 1952, and operating an illegal\ngambling business, 18 U.S.C. S 1955, all derive from the\nallegations regarding the use of authorized\ncountermeasures and other alleged but in fact nonexistent\nviolations of the CCC regulations. Any debts allegedly\n\"unlawfully collected\" are those lost by players during\nblackjack games played in accordance with the CCC\nregulations. Any \"illegal gambling business\" or \"unlawful\nactivity in interstate commerce\" is simply the play of\nblackjack as authorized by the CCC. Similarly, the casinos\ndo not engage \"in unlawful activity\" or \"operating an illegal\ngambling business\" by not offering appellants or anyone\nelse \"comps,\" which are nothing mor e than free gifts from\nthe casinos. While appellants claim that the casinos are\nobliged to offer \"comps,\" in our view if they fail to do so\nthey are not committing criminal acts in any way impacting\non the integrity of the blackjack game. If appellants want to\nbring a judicial action to recover the value of\"comps,\"\nsurely their forum should be a New Jersey state court, at\nleast in some instances the small claims part. Plainly, the\ncasinos' activities of which appellants complain do not\nconstitute crimes and therefore ar e not predicate RICO\nacts.\n\n                               20\n\fFurthermore, appellants, although mentioning the use of\n\"shills\" in their complaint, have not made any allegations\nthat the casinos violate the statutory prohibition of the use\nof \"shills,\" i.e., persons who induce potential patrons to\nenter a casino or induce them to play any game. See N.J.\nStat. Ann. S 5:12-1001 (West 1996). Certainly the casinos\nhave not used shills to encourage appellants to play\nblackjack in their premises.\n\nIn their brief, appellants further assert that the CCC\nstated in an administrative proceeding that it would be\ndeceptive for casinos actively to solicit a player to count\ncards in its casino without letting the player know that\ncountermeasures will be used against those suspected of\ncounting cards. See br. at 11, 25. Appellants, however, fail\nto cite the full text of the CCC's statement, which\nconcluded:\n\n       [T]he Commission does not believe that any of the\n       exhibits submitted by the commenters come even close\n       to supporting an allegation of active solicitation of card\n       counter play by a casino licensee.\n\n31 N.J. Reg. 556 (Feb. 6, 1999). Thus, appellants' r eference\nto the CCC's statement adds nothing to their allegation that\nthe casinos' use of shills constitutes a RICO act.\n\nAppellants also assert that it is deceptive for the casinos\nto fail to provide players with a complete text of the rules\ngoverning the play of blackjack. This allegation also fails to\nsupport a claim for relief. As we set forth above, the rules\nand regulations governing blackjack ar e numerous and\nthus they do not lend themselves to inclusion in a short\nmanual. Further, the sample casino br ochure in the\nappendix explaining blackjack on its face is not deceptive.\nSee app. at 832-34. While it does not purport to set forth\nall of the blackjack rules, it does give the infor mation\nneeded by a player to play the game.\n\nThe appellants also allege that it is impermissible for the\ncasinos to require one player's wager to be less than that of\nother players at the same table. See br . at 40 (citing N.J.\nStat. Ann. S 5:12-100g (West 1996)). As we mentioned,\nhowever, the CCC has adopted a regulation that specifically\nallows casinos to set different wager limits, even among\n\n                               21\n\fplayers at the same table, if a player is suspected of card\ncounting. See N.J.A.C. S 19:47-8.2(b)-(d). As a result, the\ncasinos cannot be said to have violated the Act in a manner\nto support a RICO cause of action. While appellants may\nwish to challenge the propriety of the r egulation, they have\nnot stated a RICO cause of action against the casinos\nwhose actions are in compliance with the law and the\nCCC's regulations.\n\nAppellants next argue that the casinos' failur e to obtain\nprior approval for the countermeasur es they implement\nconstitutes a predicate act. See br . at 40-41. Yet appellants\nalso recognize that the CCC has determined that the\ncasinos do not need prior approval to implement the\nmeasures. See id. at 41. While the appellants note that that\nruling is being challenged on appeal, it will be time enough\nfor a federal court to consider the RICO implications if and\nwhen the CCC determines that the casinos' practices are\nillegal and the casinos do not comply prospectively with the\nCCC's determinations.\n\nThe only alleged predicate acts that ar e not based on\nCCC regulations are the allegations of assaults, threats,\nand stalking-in-person and via the Internet. Appellants\nallege that one appellant was knocked off his seat on one\noccasion, that some appellants were followed ar ound\ncasinos, and that one appellant was grabbed by the arm\nwhile being escorted out of a casino. However , these minor\naltercations cannot be regarded as conduct egregious\nenough to serve as predicate acts sufficient to support what\nappellants apparently believe is massive litigation, in which,\nbefore trebling, they are seeking at least $347,532,800 in\ndamages. See Doug Grant, 3 F. Supp.2d at 522 n.1. Nor do\nthe appellants' claims of receiving anonymous\npornographic, offensive and threatening messages over the\nInternet from John Doe defendants constitute predicate\nacts attributable to the appellees, as appellants put forth\nno basis for concluding or even alleging that anyone\nassociated with the casinos sent the messages. Accor dingly,\nwe will affirm the order of the district court dismissing the\nstate and federal RICO causes of action.\n\nFor the reasons we have set forth, we have r eached the\nconclusion that appellants' allegations that the casinos or\n\n                               22\n\fany appellee has committed predicate RICO acts are\ncompletely insubstantial and border on the frivolous. In the\ncircumstances, inasmuch as appellants have failed to allege\nany predicate act upon which to base a RICO claim, we\nneed not determine conclusively whether appellants\nproperly have pleaded injury to business or pr operty as\nrequired for a RICO damages action. See 18 U.S.C.\nS 1964(c); N.J. Stat. Ann. S 2C:41-4c (W est 1995); Maio, 221\nF.3d at 483-84. Nevertheless, in this r egard we do make the\nfollowing observation which demonstrates why this action,\nwhich has generated a large recor d and required a\nconsiderable expenditure of time and no doubt money is, at\nbottom, at least with respect to the claims we have\nconsidered, a fatuity.\n\nUnlike an ordinary RICO victim, in this case the allegedly\ninjured plaintiffs, i.e., the players, can avoid any injury\nsimply by walking away from the alleged wr ongdoers, the\ncasinos, by not playing blackjack in casinos. In fact, that is\nwhat the casinos apparently want them to do, at least as\nlong as they count cards. While this abstention would\ndeprive them of the opportunity to enrich themselves at the\ncasinos' expense, surely it would be difficult to characterize\nthat lost speculative opportunity as an injury to\"business\nor property.\" If the appellants have played blackjack in the\npast, aware of the casinos' countermeasur es, and if they\ncontinue to play blackjack in the future in the hope of\nprofiting by counting cards, they have suffered and will\nsuffer self-inflicted wounds. Accordingly, at least with\nrespect to individual players who are awar e of the casinos'\ncountermeasures, it is difficult to consider this case within\na RICO formulation.6\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. In their brief, the casinos assert as an alter native ground for\naffirmance that the statute of limitations has run as to some of the\nappellants' claims. See br. at 14 & n.5. Appellants respond that they\nhave alleged continuing violations that render their claims timely. See\nreply br. at 9. Appellants seem to overlook, however, that the corporate\nplaintiffs all ceased operations by 1992. See app. at 930-32. In the\ncircumstances, inasmuch as appellants instituted this action in 1997,\nthe corporate appellants' federal RICO claims ar e barred by the four-year\nRICO statute of limitations. See Forbes v. Eagleson, No. 99-1803, ___\nF.3d. ___, 2000 WL 1529852, at *10 (3d Cir. Oct. 17, 2000).\n\n                               23\n\fB. Leave to Amend\n\nThe appellants originally pleaded a cause of action under\nthe New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act, but omitted that\nclaim in their amended complaint. In the district court, and\nhere, they have asked permission to amend their complaint\nto reinclude the Consumer Fraud Act claim. The district\ncourt denied appellants leave to amend because it found\nthat the Consumer Fraud Act claim was completely without\nmerit and it would be futile to amend the complaint to\ninclude a meritless claim. See Doug Grant, 3 F. Supp.2d at\n536-37.\n\nAs noted by the district court, the New Jersey Supr eme\nCourt recently has held that the Consumer Fraud Act does\nnot apply to a heavily regulated industry to the extent that\napplication of the statute would create a \"r eal possibility\" of\nconflict between the Consumer Fraud Act, as administered\nby the Division of Consumer Affairs, and the r egulatory\nschemes of other administrative bodies. See Lemelledo v.\nBeneficial Mgmt. Corp. of Am., 696 A.2d 546, 553 (N.J.\n1997). Thus, the Consumer Fraud Act is inapplicable where\n\"the other source or sources of r egulation deal specifically,\nconcretely, and pervasively with the particular activity,\nimplying a legislative intent not to subject parties to\nmultiple regulations that, as applied, will work at cross-\npurposes.\" Id. at 554.\n\nCertainly the Casino Control Act evidences the New\nJersey legislature's intent to vest in the CCC exclusive\ncontrol of the regulation of casino gaming, including the\ncontent of related advertising. See N.J. Stat. Ann. S 5:12-\n133b (West 1996); id. S 5:12-70(o); see also Greate Bay\nHotel & Casino v. Tose, 34 F.3d 1227, 1232-33 (3d Cir.\n1994). If we allowed claims such as the appellants'\nproposed consumer fraud claim to proceed in the district\ncourt, we would interfere with the CCC's regulatory\nscheme. The regulation of the game of blackjack, including\nshuffling-at-will and the advertisement regulations, is\nwithin the exclusive jurisdiction of the CCC. Mor eover, the\nCCC has particularized expertise in these matters not\npossessed by courts and juries. While it is true that the\nSupreme Court of New Jersey in Campione, approving our\nopinion in Tose, see 714 A.2d at 307-08, held that the\n\n                               24\n\fcourts were not ousted of jurisdiction over common law\ndamage claims against casinos merely because the claims\narose from gambling transactions, this holding does not\ninform our result here on the very different question of the\napplicability of a different regulatory act to casino\noperations with respect to running blackjack games. Thus,\nthe district court properly denied appellants' motion for\nleave to amend for, as a matter of law, the amended\ncomplaint would not have stated a claim on which r elief\ncould be granted. See Smith v. National Collegiate Athletic\nAss'n, 139 F.3d 180, 190 (3d Cir. 1999), vacated on other\ngrounds, 525 U.S. 459, 119 S.Ct. 924 (1999).\n\nIn reaching our result on this point, we emphasize that\nthe goals of the Consumer Fraud and the Casino Contr ol\nActs are not entirely consistent. The Consumer Fraud Act\nis concerned with the protection of consumers. The Casino\nControl Act, however, has dual purposes that must be\nbalanced -- the protection of gambling patr ons and the\nprotection of the financial viability of the casino industry.\nN.J. Stat. Ann. S 5:12-1b (12) (West 1996). Thus, the Casino\nControl Act presupposes that the consumers as a group,\ni.e., the players, will lose their money, a contemplated\nresult that hardly is the object of the Consumer Fraud Act.\n\nC. Dismissal Against John Does with Prejudice\n\nThe sixth count of the complaint alleges various state\nand federal statutory claims against John Does for sending\noffensive messages and alleged threats over the Internet.\nBut while the appellants in the complaint sought r elief\nagainst the casino appellees for these acts, see app. at 104,\nthey failed to offer any link between the John Does and the\ncasinos. Thus, the district court properly dismissed this\naspect of the complaint, though it did so with pr ejudice. We\nconclude, however, that the dismissal should have been\nwithout prejudice, allowing appellants to bring a claim at a\nlater time if they uncover sufficient facts to per mit them to\nplead facts supporting a conclusion that the casinos were\nresponsible for these acts. Accordingly, we will vacate the\norder dismissing the sixth count with pr ejudice to the\nextent that it included claims relating to the sending of the\noffensive messages and threats over the Internet, and with\nrespect to that aspect of the order will r emand the matter\n\n                               25\n\fto the district court to modify the order so that it dismisses\nthe count without prejudice.\n\nD. Constitutional and Civil Rights Claims\n\nAppellants' sixth count also alleges violations of the\nEqual Protection Clause, the Due Process Clause, Article 1,\nparagraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution, and 42 U.S.C.\nS 1983. As the district court correctly noted, this count fails\nto state a claim upon which relief can be granted for several\nreasons. First, appellants' allegations of state action are\ninsufficient. State regulation and the CCC's authorization of\ncasino activities do not transform the casinos into state\nactors. See Uston v. Hilton Hotels Corp., 448 F. Supp. 116,\n118 (D. Nev. 1978); State v. Sanders, 448 A.2d 481, 486\n(N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1982) (sear ch by casino\nemployees does not constitute state action). It is well\nestablished that \"[m]ere approval of or acquiescence in the\ninitiatives of a private party is not sufficient to justify\nholding the State responsible for those initiatives under the\nterms of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Blum v. Yaretsky,\n457 U.S. 991, 1004-05, 102 S.Ct. 2777, 2786 (1982);\nJackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 419 U.S. 345, 350-51,\n95 S.Ct. 449, 453-54 (1974). Second, appellants have not\nsuffered any equal protection clause violation inasmuch as\nunder the rational basis test applicable for a non-protected\nclass such as card-counters subject to CCC r egulations,\nsee Bally Mfg. Corp. v. New Jersey Casino Contr ol Comm'n,\n426 A.2d 1000, 1005 (N.J.) (casino regulations examined\nunder rational basis test), appeal dismissed, 454 U.S. 804,\n102 S.Ct. 77 (1981), the countermeasur es used by the\ncasinos and authorized by the CCC are rationally related to\nthe legitimate state interest in protecting the financial\nviability of the casino industry. See N.J. Stat. Ann. S 5:12-\n1b(12). Third, we are satisfied that the appellants do not\nhave a constitutionally protected property interest in the\nopportunity to gamble and thus the activities of which they\ncomplain do not violate their due process rights. Therefore,\nthe district court properly dismissed the constitutional and\ncivil rights claims in the sixth count of the complaint for\nfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.7\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. We hasten to add that we do not suggest that our holding means that\nthe casinos have carte blanche in dealing with their patrons and they do\nnot suggest otherwise. For example, both federal and state\ndiscrimination laws would be implicated if casinos discriminated among\ntheir patrons on the basis of their inclusion in protected groups.\n\n                               26\n\fV. CONCLUSION\n\nWe have carefully considered all of appellants'\narguments, including those that we may not have\naddressed specifically, and have concluded that the district\ncourt properly dismissed this action with pr ejudice with\nrespect to the counts of the complaint that it addressed,\nexcept that it should have dismissed count six without\nprejudice to the extent that the count r elated to sending\noffensive messages and threats over the Internet.8\nConsequently, we will modify the order of dismissal to\nprovide that count six partially is dismissed without\nprejudice, and we otherwise will affir m the order of\ndismissal with prejudice, and will affir m the order\nremanding the remaining aspects of the complaint to the\nSuperior Court of New Jersey. We will r emand the case to\nthe district court to enter an order consistent with this\nopinion. Costs on this appeal will be taxed against\nappellants.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. Immediately before oral argument on this appeal, appellants filed a\nmotion requesting \"an evidentiary hearing on possible conflicts of\ninterest of the district court\" because of what appellants said were their\n\"serious concerns\" that the court \"may have undisclosed conflicts of\ninterest or financial interests.\" W e have considered this application\ncarefully and will deny the motion as we find it to be without merit. In\nany event, the appellants' \"serious concer ns\" are quite immaterial, as we\nhave exercised plenary review on all the issues on this appeal so that it\nwould not matter if the appellants' concerns were justified. While we\nrecognize that we review the denial of a motion for leave to amend on an\nabuse of discretion basis, here we ar e upholding the denial on the legal\nbasis that the proposed amendment would not survive a motion to\ndismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). See Smith, 139 F.3d at 190. Thus, we have\nnot deferred to the district court on any issue on which we have passed.\n\n                               27\n\f",

INTRODUCTION\n\nThis matter comes on before this court on appeal from an\norder entered on May 1, 1998, partially dismissing this\naction pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to\nstate a claim on which relief can be granted. 1 See Doug\nGrant, Inc. v. Greate Bay Casino Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2568426\"><a href=\"/opinion/2568426/doug-grant-inc-v-greate-bay-casino-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(D.N.J. 1998). The appellants had instituted this action in\nthe Superior Court of New Jersey but the appellees r emoved\nit to the district court. Consequently, when the district\ncourt entered the Rule 12(b)(6) order it r emanded\nappellants' state-law claims that it did not addr ess to the\nSuperior Court. In view of the procedural posture of this\ncase, we treat the allegations of fact in the complaint as\ntrue, and consider them in a light most favorable to the\nappellants.2\n\nThe individual appellants are blackjack players who have\nfrequented Atlantic City casinos operated by the casino\nappellees. Of the 60 individual appellants, all but six have\ndeveloped card-counting skills for playing blackjack\nenabling them to reduce or eliminate the nor mal odds in\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. In our extensive Introduction and at other places in our opinion, we\nessentially have tracked the district court's compr ehensive opinion. We\nalso note that the Supreme Court of New Jersey in Campione v. Adamar\nof N. J., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2399877\"><a href=\"/opinion/2399877/campione-v-adamar-of-new-jersey-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">714</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 301, 305-06 (N.J. 1998), discussed the\ncountermeasures the New Jersey Casino Control Commission has\nallowed the casinos to take against card-counters. Of course, the\ncasinos' use of these countermeasures is at the heart of this case.\n\n2. Inasmuch as the complaint references and relies on the content of\ncertain documents, we consider them on this appeal. See Churchill v.\nStar Enter., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765099\"><a href=\"/opinion/765099/mary-churchill-in-no-98-1491-v-star-enterprises-aka-star-staff/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">184</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 190 n.5 (3d Cir. 1999); Rose v. Bartle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520594\"><a href=\"/opinion/520594/rose-joseph-in-no-88-1634-v-bartle-paul-asher-robert-smyth-joseph/\"><span class=\"volume\">871</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">331</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 339 n.3 (3d Cir. 1989). Indeed, this case is unusual as the\nappendix consists of four volumes and thus is of a length which might\nbe expected on an appeal from a summary judgment rather than on\nappeal from a motion to dismiss.\n\n                               4\n\ffavor of the casinos and, indeed, to turn the odds in their\nfavor. The corporate appellants are associated with\nappellant Doug Grant, Inc., a New Jersey corporation,\nwhose predecessor corporations operated car d-counting\nschools and mock casinos established by the appellant,\nDoug Grant, a renowned card-counter . Doug Grant, Inc.\nalso provided the training for several cooperative player\ngroups, including many of the appellants her e, who pooled\ntheir financial resources and agr eed to share their\nblackjack winnings.\n\nA. The Play of Blackjack, Card-Counting and Shuffling-\n       At-Will and Other Countermeasur es\n\nThe gravamen of appellants' complaint is that the casinos\nhave taken countermeasures that the appellants regard as\nillegal to eliminate the advantage that a skilled card-\ncounter may have over them in playing blackjack, the one\ncasino game in which a player's skill may incr ease his\nchance of winning to the point of eliminating the winning\nodds in favor of the \"house.\" See Campione v. Adamar of N.\nJ., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2399877\"><a href=\"/opinion/2399877/campione-v-adamar-of-new-jersey-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">714</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 301 (N.J. 1998). Car d-counters use\nintellect and memory to identify the time during the course\nof play when a player's odds of winning are better or worse.\nThus, the individual appellants allege that the casinos have\nimpaired their ability to win money from the casinos in\nblackjack. The corporate appellants allege that their schools\nand mock casinos were forced to close as a result of the\ncasinos' countermeasures against car d-counters, and\nbecause of bomb threats, break-ins, destruction of\nproperty, theft of student lists, stalking and other\nintimidation tactics.\n\nIt is necessary for us partially to describe how blackjack\ngames are run in order to put appellants' allegations in\ncontext. Blackjack is played with decks containing 52 cards\nof four suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades) with\neach suit containing 13 cards (Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10,\n9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2). See N.J.A.C. S 19:46-1.17. Before a\nblackjack game starts, the dealer receives one or more,\nusually between six to eight, card decks fr om a casino\nsupervisor and inspects them in the presence of the\nfloorperson. See id. S 19:47-2.4(a). After inspecting the\ncards, the dealer takes them to a blackjack table and\n\n                               5\n\fspreads them out in a fan, face upward, for visual\ninspection by the first player or players to arrive at the\ntable. See id. S 19:47-2.4(b). After these players are afforded\nan opportunity to inspect the cards, the dealer turns them\nface downward on the table, mixes them thor oughly, and\nshuffles them until they are \"randomly intermixed.\" The\ndealer then places the cards into a stack. See id. S 19:47-\n2.4(c); id. S 19:47-2.5(a). After the shuffling is completed,\nthe dealer asks the player seated at a particular position at\nthe table, as defined by the regulations of the Casino\nControl Commission (\"CCC\"), the casino r egulatory agency,\nid. 19:47-2.5(e), to cut the deck. See id. S 19:47-2.5(b). The\nplayer cuts the deck by placing a plastic cutting card in the\nstack at least ten cards from either end. See id. S 19:47-\n2.5(c).\n\nOnce the player has inserted the cutting car d, the dealer\ntakes all the cards in front of the cutting card and places\nthem at the back of the stack. See id. S 19:47-2.5(d). The\ndealer then takes the entire stack of shuffled cards and\ncuts and aligns it along the side of the dealing shoe which\nhas a mark on its side enabling the dealer to insert the\ncutting card so that it is in a position \"at least\napproximately\" one-quarter of the way fr om the back of the\nstack. See id. S 19:47-2.5(d); id. S 19:46-1.19(d)(4). The\ndealer then inserts the stack of cards into the dealing shoe\nfor commencement of play. See id. S 19:47-2.5(d). The cards\nbehind the cutting card will not be used during the game.\n\nOnce play has commenced the dealer deals the car ds to\nthe players in a series of hands until the dealer r eaches the\ncutting card. When the dealer reaches the cutting card, the\ndealer repeats the shuffling process and cutting procedures\ndescribed above. See id. S 19:47-2.5(h).\n\nA blackjack player's object is to reach as close as possible\nto a total card value of 21 without exceeding that value. A\nplayer exceeding 21 loses regardless of the dealer's\nsubsequently acquired hand. Persons in the casino\nindustry and card-counters have come to r ecognize that, in\na player's endeavor to reach a value as close as possible to\n21, certain cards are more favorable to the player and\ncertain cards are more favorable to the dealer. In particular,\nappellants assert that the Ace, King, Queen, Jack and Ten\n\n                               6\n\fare favorable to a player, but the 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2 are\nfavorable to the dealer and thus to the house. The 7, 8, and\n9 are said to be neutral. At any point during the play, the\ncards in a shoe can contain more player -favorable cards or\nmore dealer-favorable cards. When there are more player-\nfavorable cards, a player's chances of winning are increased\nbut when there are more dealer -favorable cards, the\ndealer's chances of winning are increased. Whether and\nwhen a shoe will turn out to be player - or dealer-favorable\nis purely random.\n\nCard-counters attempt to \"count cards\" to determine\nwhether and when a shoe is player-favorable. They then\nvary their bets, i.e., betting high when the shoe is player-\nfavorable and low when the shoe is dealer-favorable to\nincrease their chances of having a winning r ound of play.\nBets are placed before each individual r ound of blackjack,\nusually within established minimum and maximum limits\nfor the table. According to the appellants, successful card-\ncounting contains several basic elements including the\nassignment of a point value to each card, maintaining a\nrunning total of those points during play, betting strategies,\nplaying strategies, money management, a sufficient\nbankroll, and \"the intangible ability to consistently apply\nthese interrelated strategies under fast-paced casino\nconditions.\" See app. at 24.\n\nFor maximum advantage, card-counters need to be able\nto view, through the rounds of play, as many of the cards\nin the shoe as possible. The greater number of cards they\nare able to view, the easier it is for them to determine to\nwhom the remaining cards in the shoe ar e favorable. For\nthis reason, card-counters prefer that the dealer place the\ncutting card toward the end of the shoe, leaving a small\nnumber of cards behind the cutting-card and increasing\nthe overall number of cards in play. Car d-counters also\nprefer to have the entire shoe of car ds played. If the dealer\nreshuffles prior to reaching the cutting card, then the card-\ncounters' opportunity to bet high on a shoe with a\nremainder of mostly player-favorable car ds is impaired.\n\nThe casinos, on the other hand, prefer to decr ease the\ncard-counters' opportunity to bet high on a player-favorable\nshoe. Therefore, it is in their inter est to decrease the card-\n\n                               7\n\fcounters' chances of determining whether a shoe is player-\nfavorable by playing with fewer cards in the shoe, i.e.,\nplacing the cutting card as far from the back of the stack\nas permitted by the CCC regulations. It is also in the\ncasinos' interest to reshuffle prior to reaching the cutting\ncard when the remaining cards in a shoe are player-\nfavorable. These practices, however, come at a cost to the\ncasino as the more often the dealer goes thr ough the\nmeticulous shuffling process, the shorter the actual time of\nplay and thus the smaller the casino's profits.\n\nAppellants allege that the casinos maintain car d-counting\nteams and/or video and computer surveillance equipment\nto identify card-counters and inform the dealers of their\nparticipation in a blackjack game so that the dealers can\ntake countermeasures against them. Appellants challenge\nthese practices, claiming they violate the New Jersey\n\"cheating games\" section in the Casino Contr ol Act, N.J.\nStat. Ann. S 5:12-115 (West 1996), which provides that it\nshall be unlawful:\n\n       Knowingly to deal, conduct, carry on, operate or expose\n       for play any game or games played with cards . . .\n       which have in any manner been marked or tamper ed\n       with, or placed in a condition, or operated in a manner,\n       the result of which tends to deceive the public or tends\n       to alter the normal random selection of characteristics\n       or the normal chance of the game which could\n       determine or alter the result of the game.\n\nThe appellants make several specific allegations to\nsupport their claims. See Doug Grant, 3 F . Supp.2d at 524-\n25. First, they argue that the card-counter identifying\nprocess fundamentally is flawed because it tends unfairly to\nmisidentify non-card-counters as card-counters. They claim\ncasinos define card-counters as (1) any patr on who\nincreases a bet during a player-favorable count, or (2) any\npatron who knows or is related to someone who has\nincreased a bet during a player-favorable count. According\nto appellants, a player the casino identifies as a card-\ncounter is \"branded for life\" and never is able to play a\n\"fair\" game of blackjack without being subjected to\ncountermeasures. The casinos allegedly share information\nabout suspected card-counters through defendant Griffin\n\n                                8\n\fInvestigations and other similar agencies. These agencies\nallegedly keep dossiers containing the pictur es of suspected\ncard-counters which casino employees then use to spot\ncard-counters for the purpose of knowing when to\nimplement countermeasures.\n\nSecond, appellants claim that the casinos utilize what\nthey term the \"cheating-at-will\" pr eferential shuffle and\nwhich, as codified by the CCC regulations, generally is\nknown as the \"shuffle-at-will.\" A dealer r eshuffling prior to\nreaching the cut-card marker shuffles-at-will. A casino will\nshuffle in this manner when its card-counting team\ndetermines that the shoe is player-favorable at a table\nwhere it suspects card-counters ar e playing. Appellants\nallege that the shuffle-at-will provides an extra 2%\nadvantage to the casino, nearly double its nor mal chance of\nwinning, and thus providing the casinos with a windfall of\nmillions of dollars. Id. at 525. They also claim that a casino\ncan shuffle-at-will abusively to the disadvantage of players\nwho are not card-counters by shuffling-at-will even when\nits employees do not suspect that there is a card-counter\nplaying at a table. Id.\n\nAppellants recount specific instances in which individual\nappellants allegedly were subjected to shuffling-at-will by\nspecific casinos throughout the past ten years. On some,\nbut not all, of these occasions, the player r eported the\nshuffle-at-will to the CCC and/or the New Jersey\nDepartment of Gaming Enforcement (\"DGE\") official on-site\nat every casino. According to appellants, the casinos never\nhave responded to such complaints by admitting to\ncounting cards and shuffling during a player -favorable\ncount. Id.\n\nAppellants also allege that because they have been\nidentified as card-counters, they are limited to one wager at\na time, are refused cards, have bets pushed back, and are\nforced to bet below the original posted limit at the table. Id.\nMoreover, they allege that \"shills\" associated with the\ncasinos sometimes occupy all seats at tables at which they\nwish to play. Id. The appellants allege that they have been\ntreated in these adverse ways even though players who are\nnot card-counters are not so treated.\n\n                               9\n\fAppellants also claim that the casinos have denied them\nhospitality \"comps,\" such as meals, after identifying them\nas card-counters. Id. Finally, appellants allege that they\nhave been threatened, assaulted and stalked because of\ntheir suspected card-counter status. Id. They allege that\nthey have been threatened in person while at the casinos\nby both known and unknown casino employees and that\nthey have been threatened and sent pornographic materials\nover the Internet by unnamed John Does allegedly\nconnected to the casinos. Id.\n\nB. The Casino Control Act and CCC Regulations\n\nThe New Jersey Casino Control Act, N.J. Stat. Ann.\nS 5:12-1 et seq. (West 1996) (the \"Act\"), gives the CCC\ncomprehensive authority to define and r egulate the rules\nand conduct of play for blackjack and other authorized\ncasino games.

The\nCCC is very aware of the card-counter controversy. As the\nparties have recognized, the CCC carefully has considered\nand addressed in its regulatory capacity the effect card-\ncounters can have on the game and the ways in which\ncasinos should be permitted to respond to professional\ncard-counters. See, e.g., 14 N.J. Reg. 467-70 (May 17,\n\n                               10\n\f1982); 14 N.J. Reg. 559-69 (June 7, 1982); 14 N.J. Reg.\n841 (Aug. 2, 1982); 23 N.J. Reg. 1784 (June 3, 1991); 23\nN.J. Reg. 2613 (Sept. 3, 1991); 23 N.J. Reg. 3350 (Nov. 4,\n1991); 23 N.J. Reg. 3354 (Nov. 4, 1991); 25 N.J. Reg. 3953\n(Sept. 7, 1993); 25 N.J. Reg. 5521 (Dec. 6, 1993). The CCC\nregulations authorize the casinos to use certain\ncountermeasures to prevent car d-counters from overcoming\nthe statistical advantage that is necessary to ensur e the\ncasinos' financial viability.\n\nThe CCC adopted many of its regulations authorizing\ncountermeasures in response to the New Jersey Supreme\nCourt's ruling in Uston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2079279\"><a href=\"/opinion/2079279/uston-v-resorts-international-hotel-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, a case considering\nwhether casinos have the authority to exclude car d-\ncounters from their premises. The court determined that\ncasinos were not authorized to exclude car d-counters,\nreasoning that the Act gave the CCC exclusive and plenary\nauthority to set the rules and methods of play of casino\ngames and that the CCC had not authorized the exclusion\nof card-counters as a countermeasur e.3 The court\nsuggested, however, that if the CCC wanted to approve\nmeasures to neutralize the card-counter threat, it might be\nable to exclude card-counters, provided that the regulation\ndid not violate constitutional or statutory limits. Uston, 445\nA.2d at 375-76.\n\nYet, prior to Uston, the CCC had codified a practice which\nthe casinos used as a card-counter counter measure even\nthough the CCC did not promulgate it for that purpose.\nThis regulation provides that: \"[a] casino licensee, in its\ndiscretion\" may permit a player to\"wager on [more than]\none box at a Blackjack table.\" N.J.A.C. S 19:47-2.14. The\nCCC had been allowing the use of this practice against\ncard-counters through its approval of casinos' internal\ncontrol pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. S 5:12-99. The rule\nspecifically grants casinos discretion to allow players\n(usually non-card-counters) to bet on mor e than one box,\nand presumably, in light of the discretionary language,\nallows them to preclude card-counters fr om betting on\nmore than one box.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. It appears that prior to Uston the casinos on at least some occasions\nexcluded card-counters and did so with \"overwhelming force.\" See State\nv. Sanders, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1961754\"><a href=\"/opinion/1961754/state-v-sanders/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 485 (N.J. Super . Ct. App. Div. 1982).\n\n                                11\n\fAfter Uston, the CCC held a series of hearings on the\nissue of card-counters and decided to enact r egulations\nauthorizing the casinos to use certain measur es to\nneutralize the potential negative effect car d-counters could\nhave on their financial viability. See Campione, 714 A.2d at\n305. The new regulations, which the New Jersey Supreme\nCourt urged the CCC to consider in lieu of allowing the\ncasinos to exclude card-counters, balanced the statutory\ngoals of casino viability and fair odds to all players. See\nN.J. Stat. Ann. S 5:12-100e. The CCC intended the\nregulations to ensure both the fair ness and integrity of\ncasino gambling and \"the right of the casinos to have the\nrules drawn so as to allow some reasonable pr ofit.\" Uston,\n445 A.2d at 376; see also 14 N.J. Reg. 560-61 (June 7,\n1982); 23 N.J. Reg. 1784 (June 3, 1991).\n\nSeveral of these countermeasures involved the manner by\nwhich casinos could shuffle the blackjack car ds. The first\napproved shuffling method is known as the\"Bart Carter\nShuffle,\" a \"shuffling procedur e in which approximately one\ndeck of cards is shuffled after being dealt, segregated into\nseparate stacks and each stack is inserted into pr emarked\nlocations within the remaining decks contained in the\ndealing shoe.\" N.J.A.C. S 19:47-2.1; see also 14 N.J. Reg.\n559 (June 7, 1982); 14 N.J. Reg. 841 (Aug. 2, 1982). The\nCCC also approved the \"shuffle-at-will,\" which we have\ndescribed above, to allow the casinos to shuffle after any\nround of play. To implement this appr oval, the CCC\namended the existing shuffle regulation by adding language\nregarding the casinos' authority to shuffle \"after each round\nof play\":\n\n        (a) Immediately prior to commencement of play, after\n       any round of play as may be determined by the casino\n       licensee and after each shoe of cards is dealt, the\n       dealer shall shuffle the cards so that they are randomly\n       intermixed.\n\n       . . .\n\n        (h) A reshuffle of the cards in the shoe shall take\n       place after the cutting card is reached in the shoe . . .\n       except that:\n\n                               12\n\f        1. The casino licensee may determine aft er each\n       round of play that the cards should be r eshuffled;\n\n        2. When the `Bart Carter Shuffle' is util ized a\n       reshuffle shall take place after the car ds in the discard\n       rack exceed approximately one deck in number .\n\nN.J.A.C. S 19:47-2.5; see 14 N.J. Reg. 559 (June 7, 1982),\n14 N.J. Reg. 841 (Aug. 2, 1982).\n\nThe CCC also has approved the use of a device known as\nthe continuous shuffling shoe. In place of the dealing and\nshuffling requirements set forth in N.J.A.C. 19:47-2.5 and\n2.6, a casino licensee may utilize a dealing shoe or other\ndevice designed to reshuffle the cards automatically,\nprovided that the CCC or its authorized designatee has\napproved such shoe or device and the pr ocedures for\ndealing and shuffling the cards through the use of this\ndevice. See N.J.A.C. S 19:47-2.21; see also 14 N.J. Reg. 559\n(June 7, 1982), 14 N.J. Reg. 841 (Aug. 2, 1982).\n\nThe shuffling regulations, particularly the most\ncommonly used shuffle-at-will, have enabled the casinos to\nlessen the card-counters' ability to deter mine whether cards\nremaining in the shoe are player-favorable. As we already\nhave noted, when the cards are reshuffled continuously or\nprior to the dealer reaching the cutting-car d in the shoe,\ncard-counters lose their potential advantage over the\ncasinos because they no longer can increase their bets,\nsecure in the knowledge that their chance of r eceiving\nplayer-favorable cards has been incr eased.\n\nThe CCC also authorized one non-shuffling\ncountermeasure after the Uston decision--an increase in\nthe number of decks casinos are allowed to use in\nblackjack play. See N.J.A.C. S 19:47-2.2. This change\nhelped the casinos combat card-counters by incr easing the\nnumber of cards card-counters would need to track to\ndetermine whether a shoe was player-favorable. Plainly, the\nmore cards in the shoe, the more difficult a player's task is\nto keep track of the cards.\n\nAfter the CCC authorized these initial counter measures,\nin 1991 it approved another regulation which provides that:\n\n                                13\n\f        [A] casino licensee may at any time change the\n       permissible minimum or maximum wager at a table\n       game, without notifying the Commission of such\n       change, upon posting a sign at the gaming table\n       advising patrons of the new permissible minimum or\n       maximum wager and announcing the change to\n       patrons who are at the table.\n\nN.J.A.C. S 19:47-8.3(c); see also 23 N.J. Reg. 1784 (June 3,\n1991); 23 N.J. Reg. 2613 (Sept. 3, 1991); 23 N.J. Reg. 3350\n(Nov. 4, 1991); 23 N.J. Reg. 3354 (Nov. 4, 1991). This\nregulation gives the casinos the authority to lower the\nbetting limit whenever it identifies a car d-counter so that\nthe card-counter will not be able to bet high when the shoe\nbecomes player-favorable. Then, in 1993, the CCC made a\nfurther addition to its regulations which, as further\namended in 1999, provides:\n\n       (b) A casino licensee may offer:\n\n       1. Different maximum wagers at one gaming table for\n       each permissible wager in an authorized game; and\n\n       2. Different maximum wagers at dif ferent gaming\n       tables for each permissible wager in an authorized\n       game.\n\n       (c) A casino licensee shall provide notice of the\n       minimum and maximum wagers in effect at each\n       gaming table, and any changes thereto, in accor dance\n       with N.J.A.C. 19:47-8.3.\n\n       (d) Notwithstanding (c) above, a casino licensee may, in\n       its discretion, permit a player to wager below the\n       established minimum wager or above the established\n       maximum wager at a gaming table.\n\n       (e) Any wager accepted by a dealer which is in excess\n       of the established maximum permitted wager at that\n       gaming table shall be paid or lost in its entir ety in\n       accordance with the rules of the game, notwithstanding\n       that the wager exceeded the current table maximum or\n       was lower than the current table maximum.\n\nN.J.A.C. 19:47-8.2(b) to (e); see 25 N.J. Reg. 3953 (Sept. 7,\n1993); 25 N.J. Reg. 5521 (Dec. 6, 1993). This r egulation\n\n                               14\n\fclarified that the casinos could limit specifically the wagers\nof only those patrons identified as car d-counters, while\npermitting non-card-counters to continue betting at higher\nlimits.\n\nThe New Jersey courts seem not to doubt the legality of\nthe CCC-authorized countermeasures. In particular, the\ntrial court in Campione recognized that the practice of\n\"shuffling at will,\" the central concer n in this case identified\nby the district court, is authorized by CCC r egulation, see\nN.J.A.C. S 19:47-2.5, and affects all patrons, even those not\ncounting cards, at a blackjack table. See Campione v.\nAdamar of N.

RICO Claims\n\nAppellants' first count alleges claims for racketeering\nunder federal RICO, 18 U.S.C. S 1964(c), New Jersey RICO,\nN.J. Stat. Ann. S 2C:41-4c (West 1995), and the RICO\nprovisions of the Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. S 5:12-127c (West\n1996). As appellees point out, the predicate acts of alleged\nracketeering on which appellants' base their RICO claims\nconsist almost exclusively of the use of counter measures or\nalleged violations of other CCC regulations. In order to\nmake out a RICO claim, appellants first must show that the\ncasinos committed the predicate criminal acts enumerated\nby RICO. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. SS 1961, 1962. Appellants\nclaim that the casinos committed the following pr edicate\nacts: shuffling-at-will when the count was player -favorable,\nusing computer and video technology to assist in counting\ncards and identifying card-counters, denying comps to\nappellants, using shills, limiting plaintiffs to one hand of\nblackjack at a time, lowering betting limits, and failing to\ndisclose the use and nature of the disputed\ncountermeasures. See br. 30-41; Doug Grant, 3 F. Supp.2d\nat 531-32. Based on the premise that these uses of\n\n                               16\n\fauthorized countermeasures and other alleged regulatory\nviolations are criminal acts, appellants' complaint alleges\nthat the casinos' operation of blackjack violates criminal\nstatutes regarding unlawful debt collection, transmission of\ngambling information, operation of illegal gambling\nbusiness, and interstate commerce for an unlawful activity.\n\nThe district court believed that the primary purported\npredicate act on which appellants relied is the shuffling of\ncards when the count is favorable to the players.4 The\ncomplaint alleges that use of the \"shuffling-at-will\"\ncountermeasure constitutes a predicate act of racketeering\nbecause it violates the criminal casino \"cheating\" statute,\nN.J. Stat. Ann. S 5:12-115. The trial court in Campione\nrejected this precise claim. Campione , 643 A.2d at 51\n(\"labeling of the shuffling at will as `cheating' is specious\").\nMoreover, despite appellants' pr otestations, the regulation\nitself makes clear that a casino at its discr etion may shuffle\nat the conclusion of any round of play:\n\n       (a) Immediately prior to commencement of play, after\n       any round of play as may be determined by the casino\n       licensee and after each shoe of cards is dealt, the\n       dealer shall shuffle the cards so that they are randomly\n       intermixed.\n\n       . . .\n\n       (h) A reshuffle of the cards in the shoe shall take place\n       after the cutting card is reached in the shoe as\n       provided in N.J.A.C. 19:47-2.6(1) except that:\n\n        1. The casino licensee may determine after each\n       round of play that the cards shall be r eshuffled.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. In their brief, the appellants contend that the district court was\nincorrect in this characterization, as their\"central concern is the\ndeceptive, unadvertised and clandestine use of countermeasures only\nwhen the cards favor players.\" See br. at 31. We will not linger on this\npoint for two reasons. First, the casinos take their countermeasures\nquite openly. For example, it should be appar ent to anyone at a table\nwhen the dealer shuffles before the cutting card is reached. Second, it\nseems clear that, as the district court recognized, the principal\ncountermeasure is shuffling-at-will.\n\n                               17\n\fN.J.A.C. S 19:47-2.5(a), (h).\n\nAppellants attempt at length to skew the plain meaning\nof this regulation and the relevant r egulatory history\nleading to its adoption to convince us that the CCC has\nauthorized only a \"random shuffle-at-will,\" i.e., not a\nreshuffle that occurs only during player favorable counts.\nSee br. at 33. Appellants' restrictive interpretation of the\nshuffle-at-will regulation, however, runs contrary to its\nexpress language.\n\nThe regulatory history makes clear that the CCC is fully\naware of and allows the practice of shuffling-at-will when\nthere is a player-favorable count as a countermeasure\nagainst card-counters. When the CCC published the\nproposed regulation to allow the casinos to shuffle-at-will,\nit noted that the casinos might shuffle when the count is\nfavorable and that this practice might affect the odds of the\ngame:\n\n       The economic impact of this proposed amendment\n       would vary depending on when in fact the car ds were\n       shuffled. For example, if the cards wer e always shuffled\n       after the first round of play regar dless of the point\n       count, then the casino advantage against the basic\n       strategy player and average player would probably\n       remain the same with the advantage enjoyed by the\n       card counter being decreased. If the car ds, however,\n       were only shuffled in positive point count situations\n       and not in negative point count situations, the casino\n       advantage against all types of players would incr ease.\n\n14 N.J. Reg. 470 (May 17, 1982).\n\nAppellants appear to take issue with the propriety of the\nshuffle-at-will regulation. But even assuming that in this\naction we should entertain a challenge to the r egulation, we\nperceive nothing illegal in it.5 In any event, even if the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. There have been numerous state administrative and judicial\nproceedings regarding the issues before us but it is difficult from the\nparties' briefs and appendix to discern their exact status. In any event,\nwe do not find any state determination inconsistent with the result we\nreach. Significantly, the parties are in agreement that shortly after\n\n                                18\n\fregulation is an improper exercise of the CCC's authority,\na conclusion that we reject, a casino following it before its\ninvalidation hardly could be subject to RICO liability for\nthat conduct. In our view, a casino does not commit a\npredicate RICO act when it engages in conduct the CCC\nexpressly permits.\n\nWe are disturbed that appellants have couched their\narguments in dramatic hyperbole obfuscating the real\nissues. Indeed, we are satisfied that the appellants have\nmischaracterized the facts. For instance, appellants\ncharacterize the use of the shuffle-at-will as\"secretly\nremoving cards from a blackjack game in progress.\" See br.\nat 30. But the reshuffle is hardly secr et as the dealer does\nit openly in the view of the players. Moreover , a dealer\nreshuffling does not remove cards from the deck. Rather,\nthe reshuffle simply places the cards in a different random\norder for the next hands.\n\nAppellants further allege that the shuffle-at-will is a RICO\ncriminal predicate act because it has a tendency to alter the\nnormal random chance of the game. See br. at 32-39. What\nappellants fail to realize, however, is that the normal\nrandom chance of the game is defined pursuant to the\nstatutory rules and CCC regulations. As the CCC has\nexplained:\n\n       [T]he normal chance and random character of any\n       casino game is necessarily defined and deter mined by\n       the rules governing the conduct of the game. Since the\n       Commission has the statutory authority to initially\n       establish the rules of the game, N.J.S.A. S 5:12-100e\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nappellants filed this action, the individual appellants \"filed a petition\nwith the CCC with claims identical to those raised in the federal\ncomplaint.\" See appellants' br. at 4; appellees' br. at 5-6. In addition,\nthe\nindividual appellants later filed a declaratory petition with the CCC\nseeking its \"interpretive ruling on pr ovisions of the Act, blackjack\nregulations and casino practices that ar e at issue in this appeal.\" See\nappellants' br. at 6; appellees' br. at 6. Apparently, appellants were not\nsatisfied with the outcome of the declaratory petition, see 31 N.J. Reg.\n555 (Feb. 16, 1999), as they have appealed fr om the determination to the\nNew Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division.\n\n                               19\n\f       and 70f, and primary jurisdiction to resolve any issues\n       concerning interpretation of the Act and the rules\n       promulgated thereunder, . . . it is absurd to allege that\n       practices approved by the Commission as being\n       consistent with its rules constitute `cheating' under\n       section 115 of the Act.\n\n31 N.J. Reg. 556 (Feb. 16, 1999). While appellants may\nwish to have the CCC rethink the scope of the shuffle-at-\nwill regulation, we are satisfied that after being stripped of\nits conclusory legal dressing, there is no allegation in the\ncomplaint regarding reshuffling sufficient to support a\nRICO claim against the casino defendants.\n\nAppellants' other alleged predicate acts ar e similarly\ninsufficient to support a RICO claim. The alleged violations\nof criminal statutes regarding unlawful debt collection, 18\nU.S.C. S 1962, transmission of gambling infor mation, 18\nU.S.C. S 1084, interference with commerce by threats or\nviolence, 18 U.S.C. S 1951, interstate commer ce for\nunlawful activity, 18 U.S.C. S 1952, and operating an illegal\ngambling business, 18 U.S.C. S 1955, all derive from the\nallegations regarding the use of authorized\ncountermeasures and other alleged but in fact nonexistent\nviolations of the CCC regulations. Any debts allegedly\n\"unlawfully collected\" are those lost by players during\nblackjack games played in accordance with the CCC\nregulations. Any \"illegal gambling business\" or \"unlawful\nactivity in interstate commerce\" is simply the play of\nblackjack as authorized by the CCC. Similarly, the casinos\ndo not engage \"in unlawful activity\" or \"operating an illegal\ngambling business\" by not offering appellants or anyone\nelse \"comps,\" which are nothing mor e than free gifts from\nthe casinos. While appellants claim that the casinos are\nobliged to offer \"comps,\" in our view if they fail to do so\nthey are not committing criminal acts in any way impacting\non the integrity of the blackjack game. If appellants want to\nbring a judicial action to recover the value of\"comps,\"\nsurely their forum should be a New Jersey state court, at\nleast in some instances the small claims part. Plainly, the\ncasinos' activities of which appellants complain do not\nconstitute crimes and therefore ar e not predicate RICO\nacts.\n\n                               20\n\fFurthermore, appellants, although mentioning the use of\n\"shills\" in their complaint, have not made any allegations\nthat the casinos violate the statutory prohibition of the use\nof \"shills,\" i.e., persons who induce potential patrons to\nenter a casino or induce them to play any game. See N.J.\nStat. Ann. S 5:12-1001 (West 1996). Certainly the casinos\nhave not used shills to encourage appellants to play\nblackjack in their premises.\n\nIn their brief, appellants further assert that the CCC\nstated in an administrative proceeding that it would be\ndeceptive for casinos actively to solicit a player to count\ncards in its casino without letting the player know that\ncountermeasures will be used against those suspected of\ncounting cards. See br. at 11, 25. Appellants, however, fail\nto cite the full text of the CCC's statement, which\nconcluded:\n\n       [T]he Commission does not believe that any of the\n       exhibits submitted by the commenters come even close\n       to supporting an allegation of active solicitation of card\n       counter play by a casino licensee.\n\n31 N.J. Reg. 556 (Feb. 6, 1999). Thus, appellants' r eference\nto the CCC's statement adds nothing to their allegation that\nthe casinos' use of shills constitutes a RICO act.\n\nAppellants also assert that it is deceptive for the casinos\nto fail to provide players with a complete text of the rules\ngoverning the play of blackjack. This allegation also fails to\nsupport a claim for relief. As we set forth above, the rules\nand regulations governing blackjack ar e numerous and\nthus they do not lend themselves to inclusion in a short\nmanual. Further, the sample casino br ochure in the\nappendix explaining blackjack on its face is not deceptive.\nSee app. at 832-34. While it does not purport to set forth\nall of the blackjack rules, it does give the infor mation\nneeded by a player to play the game.\n\nThe appellants also allege that it is impermissible for the\ncasinos to require one player's wager to be less than that of\nother players at the same table. See br . at 40 (citing N.J.\nStat. Ann. S 5:12-100g (West 1996)). As we mentioned,\nhowever, the CCC has adopted a regulation that specifically\nallows casinos to set different wager limits, even among\n\n                               21\n\fplayers at the same table, if a player is suspected of card\ncounting. See N.J.A.C. S 19:47-8.2(b)-(d). As a result, the\ncasinos cannot be said to have violated the Act in a manner\nto support a RICO cause of action. While appellants may\nwish to challenge the propriety of the r egulation, they have\nnot stated a RICO cause of action against the casinos\nwhose actions are in compliance with the law and the\nCCC's regulations.\n\nAppellants next argue that the casinos' failur e to obtain\nprior approval for the countermeasur es they implement\nconstitutes a predicate act. See br . at 40-41. Yet appellants\nalso recognize that the CCC has determined that the\ncasinos do not need prior approval to implement the\nmeasures. See id. at 41. While the appellants note that that\nruling is being challenged on appeal, it will be time enough\nfor a federal court to consider the RICO implications if and\nwhen the CCC determines that the casinos' practices are\nillegal and the casinos do not comply prospectively with the\nCCC's determinations.\n\nThe only alleged predicate acts that ar e not based on\nCCC regulations are the allegations of assaults, threats,\nand stalking-in-person and via the Internet. Appellants\nallege that one appellant was knocked off his seat on one\noccasion, that some appellants were followed ar ound\ncasinos, and that one appellant was grabbed by the arm\nwhile being escorted out of a casino. However , these minor\naltercations cannot be regarded as conduct egregious\nenough to serve as predicate acts sufficient to support what\nappellants apparently believe is massive litigation, in which,\nbefore trebling, they are seeking at least $347,532,800 in\ndamages. See Doug Grant, 3 F. Supp.2d at 522 n.1. Nor do\nthe appellants' claims of receiving anonymous\npornographic, offensive and threatening messages over the\nInternet from John Doe defendants constitute predicate\nacts attributable to the appellees, as appellants put forth\nno basis for concluding or even alleging that anyone\nassociated with the casinos sent the messages. Accor dingly,\nwe will affirm the order of the district court dismissing the\nstate and federal RICO causes of action.\n\nFor the reasons we have set forth, we have r eached the\nconclusion that appellants' allegations that the casinos or\n\n                               22\n\fany appellee has committed predicate RICO acts are\ncompletely insubstantial and border on the frivolous. In the\ncircumstances, inasmuch as appellants have failed to allege\nany predicate act upon which to base a RICO claim, we\nneed not determine conclusively whether appellants\nproperly have pleaded injury to business or pr operty as\nrequired for a RICO damages action. See 18 U.S.C.\nS 1964(c); N.J. Stat. Ann. S 2C:41-4c (W est 1995); Maio, 221\nF.3d at 483-84. Nevertheless, in this r egard we do make the\nfollowing observation which demonstrates why this action,\nwhich has generated a large recor d and required a\nconsiderable expenditure of time and no doubt money is, at\nbottom, at least with respect to the claims we have\nconsidered, a fatuity.\n\nUnlike an ordinary RICO victim, in this case the allegedly\ninjured plaintiffs, i.e., the players, can avoid any injury\nsimply by walking away from the alleged wr ongdoers, the\ncasinos, by not playing blackjack in casinos. In fact, that is\nwhat the casinos apparently want them to do, at least as\nlong as they count cards. While this abstention would\ndeprive them of the opportunity to enrich themselves at the\ncasinos' expense, surely it would be difficult to characterize\nthat lost speculative opportunity as an injury to\"business\nor property.\" If the appellants have played blackjack in the\npast, aware of the casinos' countermeasur es, and if they\ncontinue to play blackjack in the future in the hope of\nprofiting by counting cards, they have suffered and will\nsuffer self-inflicted wounds. Accordingly, at least with\nrespect to individual players who are awar e of the casinos'\ncountermeasures, it is difficult to consider this case within\na RICO formulation.6\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. In their brief, the casinos assert as an alter native ground for\naffirmance that the statute of limitations has run as to some of the\nappellants' claims. See br. at 14 & n.5. Appellants respond that they\nhave alleged continuing violations that render their claims timely. See\nreply br. at 9. Appellants seem to overlook, however, that the corporate\nplaintiffs all ceased operations by 1992. See app. at 930-32. In the\ncircumstances, inasmuch as appellants instituted this action in 1997,\nthe corporate appellants' federal RICO claims ar e barred by the four-year\nRICO statute of limitations. See Forbes v. Eagleson, No. 99-1803, ___\nF.3d. ___, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1529852</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *10 (3d Cir. Oct. 17, 2000).\n\n                               23\n\fB. Leave to Amend\n\nThe appellants originally pleaded a cause of action under\nthe New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act, but omitted that\nclaim in their amended complaint. In the district court, and\nhere, they have asked permission to amend their complaint\nto reinclude the Consumer Fraud Act claim. The district\ncourt denied appellants leave to amend because it found\nthat the Consumer Fraud Act claim was completely without\nmerit and it would be futile to amend the complaint to\ninclude a meritless claim. See Doug Grant, 3 F. Supp.2d at\n536-37.\n\nAs noted by the district court, the New Jersey Supr eme\nCourt recently has held that the Consumer Fraud Act does\nnot apply to a heavily regulated industry to the extent that\napplication of the statute would create a \"r eal possibility\" of\nconflict between the Consumer Fraud Act, as administered\nby the Division of Consumer Affairs, and the r egulatory\nschemes of other administrative bodies. See Lemelledo v.\nBeneficial Mgmt. Corp. of Am., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1511116\"><a href=\"/opinion/1511116/lemelledo-v-beneficial-management-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">696</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">546</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 553 (N.J.\n1997). Thus, the Consumer Fraud Act is inapplicable where\n\"the other source or sources of r egulation deal specifically,\nconcretely, and pervasively with the particular activity,\nimplying a legislative intent not to subject parties to\nmultiple regulations that, as applied, will work at cross-\npurposes.\" Id. at 554.\n\nCertainly the Casino Control Act evidences the New\nJersey legislature's intent to vest in the CCC exclusive\ncontrol of the regulation of casino gaming, including the\ncontent of related advertising. See N.J. Stat. Ann. S 5:12-\n133b (West 1996); id. S 5:12-70(o); see also Greate Bay\nHotel & Casino v. Tose, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"677797\"><a href=\"/opinion/677797/greate-bay-hotel-casino-dba-sands-hotel-casino-country-club-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1227</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1232-33 (3d Cir.\n1994). If we allowed claims such as the appellants'\nproposed consumer fraud claim to proceed in the district\ncourt, we would interfere with the CCC's regulatory\nscheme. The regulation of the game of blackjack, including\nshuffling-at-will and the advertisement regulations, is\nwithin the exclusive jurisdiction of the CCC. Mor eover, the\nCCC has particularized expertise in these matters not\npossessed by courts and juries. While it is true that the\nSupreme Court of New Jersey in Campione, approving our\nopinion in Tose, see 714 A.2d at 307-08, held that the\n\n                               24\n\fcourts were not ousted of jurisdiction over common law\ndamage claims against casinos merely because the claims\narose from gambling transactions, this holding does not\ninform our result here on the very different question of the\napplicability of a different regulatory act to casino\noperations with respect to running blackjack games. Thus,\nthe district court properly denied appellants' motion for\nleave to amend for, as a matter of law, the amended\ncomplaint would not have stated a claim on which r elief\ncould be granted. See Smith v. National Collegiate Athletic\nAss'n, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 190 (3d Cir. 1999), vacated on other\ngrounds, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118263\"><a href=\"/opinion/118263/national-collegiate-athletic-assn-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">459</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118263\"><a href=\"/opinion/118263/national-collegiate-athletic-assn-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">924</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1999).\n\nIn reaching our result on this point, we emphasize that\nthe goals of the Consumer Fraud and the Casino Contr ol\nActs are not entirely consistent. The Consumer Fraud Act\nis concerned with the protection of consumers. The Casino\nControl Act, however, has dual purposes that must be\nbalanced -- the protection of gambling patr ons and the\nprotection of the financial viability of the casino industry.\nN.J. Stat. Ann. S 5:12-1b (12) (West 1996). Thus, the Casino\nControl Act presupposes that the consumers as a group,\ni.e., the players, will lose their money, a contemplated\nresult that hardly is the object of the Consumer Fraud Act.\n\nC. Dismissal Against John Does with Prejudice\n\nThe sixth count of the complaint alleges various state\nand federal statutory claims against John Does for sending\noffensive messages and alleged threats over the Internet.\nBut while the appellants in the complaint sought r elief\nagainst the casino appellees for these acts, see app. at 104,\nthey failed to offer any link between the John Does and the\ncasinos. Thus, the district court properly dismissed this\naspect of the complaint, though it did so with pr ejudice. We\nconclude, however, that the dismissal should have been\nwithout prejudice, allowing appellants to bring a claim at a\nlater time if they uncover sufficient facts to per mit them to\nplead facts supporting a conclusion that the casinos were\nresponsible for these acts. Accordingly, we will vacate the\norder dismissing the sixth count with pr ejudice to the\nextent that it included claims relating to the sending of the\noffensive messages and threats over the Internet, and with\nrespect to that aspect of the order will r emand the matter\n\n                               25\n\fto the district court to modify the order so that it dismisses\nthe count without prejudice.\n\nD. Constitutional and Civil Rights Claims\n\nAppellants' sixth count also alleges violations of the\nEqual Protection Clause, the Due Process Clause, Article 1,\nparagraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution, and 42 U.S.C.\nS 1983. As the district court correctly noted, this count fails\nto state a claim upon which relief can be granted for several\nreasons. First, appellants' allegations of state action are\ninsufficient. State regulation and the CCC's authorization of\ncasino activities do not transform the casinos into state\nactors. See Uston v.

See N.J. Stat. Ann. S 5:12-\n1b(12). Third, we are satisfied that the appellants do not\nhave a constitutionally protected property interest in the\nopportunity to gamble and thus the activities of which they\ncomplain do not violate their due process rights. Therefore,\nthe district court properly dismissed the constitutional and\ncivil rights claims in the sixth count of the complaint for\nfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.7\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. We hasten to add that we do not suggest that our holding means that\nthe casinos have carte blanche in dealing with their patrons and they do\nnot suggest otherwise. For example, both federal and state\ndiscrimination laws would be implicated if casinos discriminated among\ntheir patrons on the basis of their inclusion in protected groups.\n\n                               26\n\fV. CONCLUSION\n\nWe have carefully considered all of appellants'\narguments, including those that we may not have\naddressed specifically, and have concluded that the district\ncourt properly dismissed this action with pr ejudice with\nrespect to the counts of the complaint that it addressed,\nexcept that it should have dismissed count six without\nprejudice to the extent that the count r elated to sending\noffensive messages and threats over the Internet.8\nConsequently, we will modify the order of dismissal to\nprovide that count six partially is dismissed without\nprejudice, and we otherwise will affir m the order of\ndismissal with prejudice, and will affir m the order\nremanding the remaining aspects of the complaint to the\nSuperior Court of New Jersey. We will r emand the case to\nthe district court to enter an order consistent with this\nopinion. Costs on this appeal will be taxed against\nappellants.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. Immediately before oral argument on this appeal, appellants filed a\nmotion requesting \"an evidentiary hearing on possible conflicts of\ninterest of the district court\" because of what appellants said were their\n\"serious concerns\" that the court \"may have undisclosed conflicts of\ninterest or financial interests.\" W e have considered this application\ncarefully and will deny the motion as we find it to be without merit. In\nany event, the appellants' \"serious concer ns\" are quite immaterial, as we\nhave exercised plenary review on all the issues on this appeal so that it\nwould not matter if the appellants' concerns were justified. While we\nrecognize that we review the denial of a motion for leave to amend on an\nabuse of discretion basis, here we ar e upholding the denial on the legal\nbasis that the proposed amendment would not survive a motion to\ndismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). See Smith, 139 F.3d at 190. Thus, we have\nnot deferred to the district court on any issue on which we have passed.\n\n                               27\n\f</pre>",
