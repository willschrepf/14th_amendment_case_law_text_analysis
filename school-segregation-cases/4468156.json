See Tex.\n\nCode Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.0711, § 3(j) (West Supp. 2015). The trial\n\ncourt sentenced Appellant to death on July 23, 2014 for the capital\n\nmurder of Mildred Finch. (CR:88-89; RR70:84-85).1 Appellant filed his\n\nbrief on direct appeal on June 22, 2015. He filed an amended brief on\n\nAugust 24, 2016.          Appellant presents sixty-seven allegations of\n\nreversible error.\n\n                         STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      On    or   about    March     16,       1986,   Kenneth   Wayne    Thomas\n\n(hereinafter, “Appellant”), broke into the home of Fred and Mildred\n\n\n1The State will refer to the Clerk’s Record filed on December 23, 2014 as “CR,” the\nClerk’s Record filed on October 27, 2015 as “CR2,” the Clerk’s Record filed on\nNovember 30, 2015 as “CR3,” the Clerk’s Record filed on March 3, 2016 as “CR4,”\nand the Sealed Clerk’s Record as “CR-S.”\n                                          1\n\fFinch. Fred and Mildred were home at the time of the burglary and\n\nAppellant stabbed and killed them both.\n\n                          Fred and Mildred\n\n     At the time of their death, Fred and Mildred Finch had been\n\nmarried for many years.    (RR68:221). Fred and Mildred were both in\n\ntheir mid-60s and they shared a small house on Rose Lane, the home\n\nthat they purchased in the 1950s.        (RR60:31; RR68:223-25; SX34A).\n\nMildred, a smart and strong-willed woman with a master’s degree in\n\nmath and science, was a Professor of Mathematics at El Centro College.\n\n(RR68:224; SX2).   Fred, a World War II veteran and former Tuskegee\n\nairman, was a Harvard-educated lawyer who had worked to integrate\n\nschools and hotels in Dallas.   (RR68:221-22; SX1).   Fred and Mildred\n\nhad one child, a daughter named Molly. (RR68:221). Molly married\n\nJames Belt, Jr.    (RR68:220-21).       Molly and James gave Fred and\n\nMildred two grandchildren, James III and Melanie. (RR68:226).\n\n     On Sunday, March 16, 1986, the Belt family attended the 8:00\n\na.m. services at their church. (RR68:227). Afterward, Molly planned to\n\ntake Mildred to the mall. (RR68:227).        James stayed behind at the\n\nchurch to attend Sunday school. (RR68:227).        He would get a ride\n\n\n                                    2\n\fhome with a friend later. (RR68:227).     While James was waiting for\n\nhis ride, he was notified that he had a phone call. (RR68:227). It was\n\nMelanie. (RR68:226, 228). Melanie said that James needed to come to\n\nRose Lane immediately. (RR68:228).\n\n     When James arrived, Molly, Melanie, and James III were in front\n\nof the house. (RR68:228).     A police officer was there.   (RR68:228).\n\nJames went to the back door and asked whether the officer had been\n\ninside the house.   (RR68:228).     The officer had not.    (RR68:228).\n\nJames noticed that the back door was open and Fred’s car was in the\n\ndriveway. (RR68:228).       At that point, James knew something was\n\nwrong so he went inside the house. (RR68:228).     James described the\n\nscene:\n\n     I guess I was on my knees or crawling or something, and I\n     crawled through the kitchen. When I got midway through\n     the kitchen, at the end of the kitchen, I saw [Mildred]. Oh,\n     God. She was laying on the floor, and blood was everywhere.\n     Blood was everywhere: On the floor, on the wall, on the\n     ceiling. It was everywhere. When I touched her, she was\n     cold. I felt her pulse. She was dead.\n\n     I went into the bedroom. [Fred] was dead. Bed was just\n     covered with blood. Blood was on the floor, it was on the\n     wall, it was on the ceiling. It was everywhere.\n\n\n\n                                   3\n\f                       ...\n\n      In the living room, there was clothes piled up everywhere.\n      In the bedroom, the drawers had been pulled out. There\n      were clothes and things on the floor. I could tell that the\n      house had just been ramshacked (sic).\n\n(RR68:228-29).     Fred and Mildred appeared to have been stabbed\n\nmultiple times. (RR60:34).\n\n       Mildred’s body was found lying in the hallway, up against the\n\nwall. (RR60:40, 65-66, 72-75; RR63:11; SX48-53). Detective Gallagher\n\ntestified:\n\n      There was blood everywhere. There was blood on the walls.\n      There were smears on the baseboards. She was wrapped in\n      some sheets and some blankets, and you could still see\n      multiple stab wounds all over her. It was a mess.\n\n(RR60:40; SX50, 51).    Several feet from her body was “a bloody palm\n\nprint or fingerprint on the hallway wall.” (RR60:43).\n\n      Fred’s body was found in the bedroom, lying on the floor about five\n\nfeet from Mildred. (RR60:40-41, 76; RR63:11; SX42-47).       That scene\n\nwas described as follows:\n\n      Mr. Finch suffered multiple stab wounds. He was almost in\n      a kneeling-type position on the floor, with his head down on\n      the floor. There were blankets and everything. Disarray. It\n      was blood everywhere in there. He had pajamas on, but his\n                                    4\n\f     pajamas were down around his ankles or his calves. So his\n     bare buttocks was very obvious to me, as I peered down the\n     hallway.\n\n(RR60:41).    There was blood on the bed, the walls, and the floor.\n\n(RR60:41; RR63:12). There was blood “up and down the hallway, from\n\nthe baseboard almost to the ceiling.” (RR60:63).\n\n     James tried to determine whether anything had been stolen from\n\nthe house. (RR68:230).    He saw “a gap in the closet.” (RR68:230).    A\n\nnumber of Fred’s suits were gone as were his shirts, hats and caps.\n\n(RR68:230). Fred’s gold and silver Rolex was also gone. (RR68:231-32).\n\n     Dr.     Edward McDonough performed an autopsy on Mildred.\n\n(RR61:46-47; SX71-83).    Mildred “had extensive sharp-force trauma\n\nover almost all the surfaces of her body. Particularly, above the waist.”\n\n(RR61:54). The total number of sharp-force wounds was “probably more\n\nthan 90.” (RR61:54).\n\n     Mildred suffered multiple injuries to the head. Dr. McDonough\n\ndescribed the following: a stab-wound to the right side of her chin; a v-\n\nshaped cut to her scalp; a superficial stab wound above her right\n\neyebrow; a three-inch cut on the back of her scalp; and, two stab wounds\n\nto her right-back shoulder. (RR61:63-65; SX75-76, 79-80). Mildred’s\n\n                                    5\n\fother wounds were grouped based on their location: the head; right-\n\nchest; abdomen; and back. (RR61:66; SX82). There were 20 individual\n\nstab wounds to Mildred’s abdomen.           (RR61:67; SX82).   Most were\n\nsuperficial, however, some entered the abdominal cavity. (RR61:67).\n\nThere were 17 wounds to Mildred’s back, some of which penetrated her\n\nright chest cavity.   (RR61:68-69).       There were “about 35 individual\n\nwounds of various widths and depths” to the right side of Mildred’s\n\nbody, from her armpit down to her thigh.           (RR61:69; SX70A, 83).\n\n“There’s a lot of wounds that are even confluent, where they’re so close\n\ntogether they actually blend together.” (RR61:71).        There were stab\n\nwounds to the left side of Mildred’s body. (RR61:71; SX71). There were\n\nfour or five stab wounds to the back of her left upper arm. (RR61:71;\n\nSX81). There were wounds to her right hand. (RR61:72; SX73). There\n\nwas a “through and through stab wound of the wrist” on her left arm.\n\n(RR61:72-74; SX74). Dr. McDonough estimated the depth of the stab\n\nwounds as five to six inches deep.         (RR61:68).   She had defensive\n\nwounds on her hands, wrists, and forearms. (RR61:66).\n\n     Many of the stab wounds affected Mildred’s organs. There was a\n\nstab wound to her right lung; her left lung; eleven stab wounds to the\n\n\n                                      6\n\fliver; her aorta was transected.         (RR61:75). Mildred also suffered a\n\n“fairly-significant blunt-force trauma, which consisted of a fracture of\n\nthe right humerus.” (RR61:67; SX82).             Almost every one of her ribs\n\nwas fractured, some in two places. (RR61:67-68).             Mildred’s cause of\n\ndeath was “multiple stab wounds of the torso.” (RR61:74).\n\n        Dr. Gilliland performed an autopsy on Fred.2 (RR61:47-48, 51-52;\n\nSX57-70, 70A).        Dr. Gilliland documented 21 sharp-force injuries on\n\nFred. (RR61:58).        Fred had a stab wound to the right side of his head\n\nthat was about an inch long. (RR61:79, 80; SX58, 65). He suffered five\n\nstab wounds to the left side of his trunk, injuring his left upper lung,\n\nheart, abdomen, liver, stomach and pancreas. (RR61:79-81; SX58, 62).\n\nThe approximate depth of these wounds is “up to six inches[.]”\n\n(RR61:80).      He suffered ten blunt and sharp-force wounds to his back.\n\n(RR61:80, 82; SX67, 59).        These injuries caused damage to Fred’s left\n\nlung and spleen as well as a fracture of the 11th rib. (RR61:80; SX67).\n\nHe suffered stab wounds to his arms.          (RR61:81; SX64).     The medical\n\nexaminer also “noted there were several cuts between the buttocks.”\n\n\n\n\n2   Dr. McDonough was present and observed Fred’s autopsy. (RR61:47-48).\n                                         7\n\f(RR61:83; SX61). Fred’s cause of death was “multiple stab wounds.”\n\n(RR61:83).\n\n       All of Mildred’s and Fred’s wounds are consistent with a single-\n\nedged knife. (RR61:58, 61). All of the wounds could have been inflicted\n\nby a single knife. (RR61:61, 88).\n\n                   Physical Evidence of the Crime\n\n       The Finch home appeared to have been burglarized. (RR60:37,\n\n43).   The point-of-entry appeared to be a window.     A couple of the\n\nwindow sills on the front of the house appeared to have been recently\n\ndamaged and there were two open windows.       (RR60:36, 55-57, 148-50;\n\nRR63:13; SX35, 37, 107-08).    The window in the front of the house was\n\nopen, but blocked on the inside by a heavy piece of furniture.\n\n(RR60:147, 149, 188; RR63:13; SX108, 110). A bent window screen in\n\nthe yard appeared to fit this window. (RR60:36, 56, 144, 182; SX35-37).\n\n       A window on the side of the house was also open. (RR60:149, 187;\n\nSX36-37).    There was an air conditioning window unit sitting in the\n\ngrass nearby.    (RR60:36, 145, 150; SX36-37). The cord for the unit\n\nstretched from the unit though the open window to the outlet where it\n\nwas still plugged in inside. (RR60:36, 145, 148; SX36-37, 107, 109). On\n\n\n                                    8\n\fthe inside of the house, the curtains were pulled away, consistent with\n\nsomeone coming through the side window from the outside to the inside.\n\n(RR60:150-51; SX109-10).\n\n      The home appeared to have been ransacked.            (RR63:12).    In the\n\nliving room, a stereo, and a cardboard box were stacked up by the front\n\ndoor. (RR60:39, 179). The box appeared to have been “stacked up for a\n\npurpose.” (RR60:204).      Inside the box were some suits and a raincoat.\n\n(RR60:107, 109, 179, 204; SX111). The black raincoat appeared to have\n\nblood on it. (RR60:180, 204).\n\n      In the kitchen, there was a bloody rag on the floor near the\n\nrefrigerator.    (RR60:37; RR63:12; SX41).          There was blood on the\n\nhandle of the refrigerator. (RR60:38).       On the kitchen table, there was\n\na Saturday-edition of the Sunday March 16th newspaper.3 (RR60:37-\n\n38, 109-10; RR61:197; SX112, 114, 116). The newspaper had blood on\n\nit. (RR60:37-38, 109-10; SX112, 114, 116).          The blood appeared to be\n\nan outline of a knife. (RR60:110, 125; SX116). “It looks like there was\n\n\n3 The Dallas Times Herald newspaper on the table was a “Sunday noon dog\nedition[.]” (RR61:197; SX114). This version of the Sunday paper was part of an\nedition that would have gone to press in the morning of Saturday, March 15, 1986.\n(RR61:197; SX114). It would have been available for sale at various over-the-\ncounter locations throughout the county “around 8:30, 9:00 o’clock Saturday\nmorning.” (RR61:197-98).\n                                        9\n\fblood on a knife tip and it was wiped off on the newspaper.” (RR60:178,\n\n209; SX112-16).\n\n     Police walked around the scene trying to find the murder weapon.\n\n(RR60:118, 197). It was never recovered. (RR60:127-28).\n\n                          The Investigation\n\n     On March 18th, the Crime Stoppers Unit received a tip from Kathy\n\nJohnson. (RR60:83, 85, 122).     Kathy knew about the stolen property\n\nand the type of weapon. (RR60:85). She provided Appellant’s name.\n\n(RR60:86).    Kathy met with police later in the day and provided\n\nAppellant’s brother’s name, Lonnie Thomas, and advised that Lonnie\n\nknew of the stolen property as well. (RR60:87, 122).\n\n     Detectives James Gallagher and Phillip Jones went to 4323\n\nElectra to speak with Lonnie.     (RR60:87; RR63:22).     Lonnie wasn’t\n\nhome, but they spoke with his mother, Shirley Baldwin, and his other\n\nbrother, Billy Thomas. (RR63:22).       Shirley told Jones that Appellant\n\nadmitted to the murders. (RR63:63). Jones requested and was granted\n\nconsent to enter the house. (RR63:23). Inside, Jones found a three-piece\n\nblack suit, an umbrella, and black-and-white shoes. (RR63:23). He did\n\nnot find a bloody knife or bloody clothing. (RR63:24).\n\n\n                                   10\n\f      Later that day, Billy called Jones to let him know that Lonnie had\n\nreturned home. (RR63:26).          Jones and Gallagher went back to the\n\nhouse on Electra. (RR63:26).       Lonnie agreed to accompany them back\n\nto the station. (RR60:87; RR63:26). Jones testified:\n\n      What Lonnie told me, en route from 4323 Electra to the\n      office, was that when Kenneth woke him up, he had been\n      stacking property in the house; that he asked him to come\n      out and help move some of the stuff. He walked outside and\n      he said, at that point, that the property had been taken out\n      of the back of a yellow car.\n\n(RR63:54).\n\n      At the station, Lonnie provided a written statement implicating\n\nAppellant.4 (RR60:88, 90, 124; RR63:30).          Lonnie told police that he\n\nsaw Appellant in possession of a bloody weapon.                   (RR60:127).\n\nDetectives were on their way to return Lonnie back to Electra when\n\nthey learned that Lonnie had recently disposed of some of the Finch’s\n\nproperty at a “makeshift dump” on the 4000 block of Hancock Street.\n\n(RR60:91-95; RR63:31; SX34D, 87-88, 94, 100).                Lonnie had not\n\nmentioned Hancock in his statement. (RR63:30). The detectives drove\n\nto the dump site where they recovered several hat boxes, black trash\n\n4Lonnie claimed to be home in bed with his girlfriend, Delores Easter. (RR60:93,\n131).\n                                       11\n\fbags containing clothing, and Fred’s brown briefcase.       (RR60:95-97;\n\nRR63:31; SX87-88, 94-99).\n\n     Lonnie was transported back to the station where he gave a\n\nvoluntary statement and was arrested. (RR60:98-99; RR63:32-33). This\n\ntime, Lonnie said that Kathy Johnson helped him dump the property.\n\n(RR63:32). He claimed that he did not call the police because he “was\n\nafraid that he would be charged or considered a suspect in the case.”\n\n(RR63:49)\n\n     Late that night, Appellant was arrested at the house on Electra,\n\nwhich is about four blocks from the Finch home. (RR60:49, 53, 103;\n\nRR63:35-36; SX34B, 225).     Appellant was wearing Fred’s Rolex watch.\n\n(RR60:106; RR63:36-37; SX219-21).\n\n                       The Hancock Dumpsite\n\n     At the Hancock dumpsite, police located a great deal of Fred’s\n\nproperty, including suitcases, clothing, suits, men’s hats, and hat boxes.\n\n(RR61:97-99, 104-10; SX5-14, 18-21, 23, 86-88, 94-101, 207). Hats and\n\nhat boxes were found under a white sheet. (RR61:100, 102, 104-10;\n\nSX87, 95). A brown hat box was found on top of a couch. (RR61:101;\n\nSX87, 98).    Two black garbage bags containing clothing were found\n\n\n                                    12\n\fnear the couch. (RR61:101-03; SX88, 95, 97). There was also a brown\n\nsatchel containing men’s dress shirts and a loaded Enfield .38-caliber\n\nrevolver in a holster. (RR61:97-98, 103-05, 123; SX84, 85, 87,5 97, 99,\n\n207).\n\n        Among the items collected from the dumpsite were: a men’s three-\n\npiece suit (SX23); a grey and red flannel suit (SX25); a grey plaid suit\n\ncontaining the label “Fred James Finch, Jr” and dated December 10,\n\n1982 (SX27); a grey suit containing the label “Custom Tailored for Fred\n\nFinch” (SX26); a yellow shirt (SX8); a light colored shirt (SX7); a blue\n\nand red plaid shirt (SX12); a blue striped shirt (SX11); a white and blue\n\nshirt (SX9); a gray shirt (SX10); a light-colored plaid shirt (SX6); a blue\n\npatterned shirt (SX13); a blue shirt with a white collar (SX5); a multi-\n\ncolored shirt (SX28); a silver patterned shirt (SX17); two Dobbs hats\n\n(SX19-20); a flannel newsies hat (SX23); a brown fur hat (SX101); a blue\n\nhat (SX21); a tweed hat (SX18); a straw hat; (SX14); a pair of brown\n\ngloves (SX93); three pairs of black gloves (SX102-04); a blue striped\n\nscarf (SX29); a brown suede jacket (SX16).6 (RR61:105-20).\n\n\n5 The gun and holster were released following Appellant’s 1987 trial. (RR61:116;\nSX87).\n6 The property from the Hancock dumpsite that was introduced into evidence\n\nrepresents about one-third of the property collected from that site. (RR61:124).\n                                       13\n\f      Bernard Blackmon7 testified that he worked for the Leonard\n\nCustom Tailoring Company in Cincinnati and the Ripley Shirt\n\nCompany in Dallas, selling tailored suits and tailored shirts.\n\n(RR61:190).      Blackmon sold Fred custom suits.           (RR61:193).    He\n\nidentified State’s Exhibit 26 as a custom-made suit that he sold Fred.\n\n(RR61:193; SX26).     He also ordered custom-tailored shirts for Fred as\n\nwell. (RR61:194-95; SX10-3, 17). The cuffs of these shirts are\n\nmonogramed with Fred’s initials, FJF. (RR61:195).\n\n                            Forensic Evidence\n\n      Appellant’s fingerprints were found on the inside portion of the\n\nwindow sill, on the inside of the window screen, and on the air\n\nconditioning unit. (RR60:215-16, 252-57; SX117-24).         The bloody palm\n\nand fingerprint found near Mildred’s body also belonged to Appellant.\n\n(RR60:111-14, 171-76, 217, 232-257; SX125-26, 202).            Police had no\n\ninformation suggesting that Appellant knew the Finches or had any\n\nreason to be at their home. (RR60:113-14).         Lonnie’s fingerprints did\n\nnot match those recovered from the Rose Lane address. (RR60:131).\n\n\n\n\n7Bernard Blackmon was deceased at the time of the 2014 trial. The transcript of\nhis prior testimony was read into the record. (RR61:188).\n                                      14\n\f     Appellant’s fingerprints were found on the Knox hat box recovered\n\nfrom the Hancock Street dumpsite. (RR60:221, 260; SX134, 202).\n\n     In 1986, Carolyn VanWinkle performed serological testing on the\n\nfollowing items: the black raincoat (SX111); some pillowcases; black\n\nand white shoes; a bedsheet and mattress pad; Mildred’s clothes; and\n\nthe sheets from around Mildred’s body. (RR61:15, 18-19, 21).         The\n\nraincoat tested positive for blood. (RR61:22; SX111). It was Fred’s and\n\nMildred’s blood. (RR61:22, 26; SX111). Further testing of the samples\n\nfrom the raincoat did not reveal the presence of any foreign blood.\n\n(RR61:28-29).   A presumptive test performed on the black-and-white\n\nshoes was positive for blood.   (RR61:35-38; SX30). The gold bedsheet\n\nand white mattress pad collected with Mildred’s body both “had a large\n\nquantity of blood and blood soaked into it.” (RR61:38-39).    Samples of\n\nthe blood corresponded to the Finches. (RR61:39).\n\n     A pink and green pillowcase that was received with Fred’s body by\n\nthe medical examiner was also tested.     (RR61:30-31).      “[T]here was\n\nsemen identified on the pillowcase.” (RR61:31).     “[S]permatozoa were\n\nidentified on that stain.” (RR61:33-34). A screening test performed on\n\n\n\n\n                                   15\n\fthe anal swab collected during Fred’s autopsy was positive for the\n\npresence of semen. (RR61:32-33, 43). The semen was Fred’s. (RR61:43).\n\n      Certain items of evidence were subjected to testing “for handler\n\nDNA or any epithelial cells that may have come off when somebody was\n\ncarrying them or maybe wearing them.” (RR61:128, 132-33; SX208-09).\n\nMildred’s pajama shirt contained human blood. (RR61:137).          There\n\nwere three available cuttings from the shirt, but only one sample\n\nyielded a genetic profile. (RR61:158; SX210). A sample of blood from\n\nMildred’s pajama shirt yielded a partial DNA profile, which was\n\nidentified as Mildred’s own blood.       (RR61:153-55). There were four\n\navailable cuttings from Mildred’s pajama pants. (RR61:159; SX210).\n\nOne sample yielded a partial profile that matched Mildred. (RR61:159;\n\nSX210). There were six available cuttings from the bedsheet from the\n\nFinch home. (RR61:160; SX210).          One sample yielded a full genetic\n\nprofile, which was that of Mildred. (RR61:161-62; SX210).        Several\n\npartial genetic profiles from the sheet were also a match to Mildred.\n\n(RR61:162-63; SX210). Testing of a hair curler yielded a partial profile\n\nmatched to Mildred. (RR61:163; SX210). Testing of a hair curler clip\n\nyielded a partial profile matched to Mildred.        (RR61:163; SX210).\n\n\n                                   16\n\fThree stains from the raincoat did not yield any DNA.       (RR61:164;\n\nSX210).    One stain from the raincoat, however, matched Mildred’s\n\nDNA. (RR61:164-65; SX210).     The cutting from a pillowcase matched\n\nFred’s DNA profile. (RR61:171-72; SX217).\n\n     Angela Fitzwater tested the anal swab from Fred’s rape kit.\n\n(RR61:169; SX218). Both the epithelial cell fraction and the sperm cell\n\nfraction matched Fred’s DNA profile. (RR61:170, 173-74; SX218). DNA\n\ntesting from Fred’s right-hand fingernail clippings was also a match to\n\nFred. (RR61:170; SX218).\n\n                        The Thomas Family\n\n     In March of 1986, Appellant, his mother (Shirley Thomas), his\n\nbrother (Lonnie Thomas), his sister (Shirley), and Lonnie’s girlfriend\n\n(Delores Easter) shared a home at 4323 Electra. (RR62:11-13, 28, 30,\n\n73, 81, 118-19). Lonnie and Easter occupied one of the bedrooms in the\n\nhouse.\n\n     On Saturday, March 15, 1986, Lonnie watched wrestling on\n\ntelevision, after which he and Easter went to bed. (RR62:74).    Early\n\nthe following morning, Appellant woke him up, “bringing in some\n\nclothing and bags and boxes.” (RR62:74).    He had “a suitcase, with a\n\n\n                                  17\n\fpistol in it. He had boxes with hats and clothes, and he had [sic] Rolex\n\nwatch on. (RR62:14).    Appellant wanted Lonnie to help him bring\n\neverything inside. (RR62:32, 75-76). Appellant put the property on the\n\nliving room couch, on the porch and in the back room.          (RR62:31).\n\nIncluded among the property were long-sleeve shirts with initials\n\nembroidered on them. (RR62:15-17). The initials did not correspond\n\nwith Appellant’s name. (RR62:15).        Appellant claimed that he got the\n\nproperty as payment for helping a lady “move something out of her\n\ngarage.” (RR62:76).\n\n     At one point, Appellant went into the bathroom.           (RR62:76).\n\nWhen Appellant came out, Lonnie saw a shirt lying in the bathtub.\n\n(RR62:77).   The shirt was covered in blood on the right side from the\n\nwrist to the elbow. (RR62:76-77).        Lonnie also saw a bloody knife in\n\nthe bedroom.    (RR62:78-79).       It was a long hunting-type knife.\n\n(RR62:78). It was about six inches long and had a “cream-colored speck\n\nwith brown” handle.    (RR62:78).         Appellant claimed that he had\n\nstabbed a dog. (RR62:13-14, 78).\n\n     Appellant showed Lonnie “an old model .38 Breakdown front side”\n\nfirearm. (RR62:79). The gun was in a briefcase. (RR62:80). Appellant\n\n\n                                    18\n\fwas wearing “a gold-band watch.”           (RR62:80-81; SX221).        After he\n\nshowed Lonnie the property, Appellant “basically kind of just sat down\n\nand fell asleep.”    (RR62:82).     When Lonnie woke up the following\n\nmorning, Appellant was gone. (RR62:83). The bloody shirt and knife\n\nwere also gone. (RR62:83).\n\n      That day, Appellant’s other brother, Billy,8 went to the house on\n\nElectra at about noon. (RR62:143).         He wanted his mother to pay him\n\nfor babysitting his nieces and nephew. (RR62:142-43).            At the house,\n\nBilly noticed some big boxes in the bedroom where Lonnie and Kenneth\n\nslept. (RR62:144, 177, 200). He did not see how the boxes got there.\n\n(RR62:177, 200).\n\n      On Monday, Appellant met up with his cousin Thomas Penagraph.\n\n(RR62:42, 43). Appellant went over to Thomas’s house, then Appellant,\n\nThomas, and Thomas’s girlfriend Brenda Jackson all went to the house\n\non Electra. (RR62:43-44). There, Appellant changed into a black suit.\n\n(RR62:45, 50; SX24). He showed Thomas “[t]he suede brown jacket. A\n\ncouple of hats . . . [and] some suits[.]”       (RR62:44-45; SX16, 18-19).\n\nAppellant was wearing a watch that was big and looked expensive.\n\n8Billy Thomas was deceased at the time of the 2014 trial.   The transcript of his\nprior testimony was read into the record. (RR62:140).\n                                      19\n\f(RR62:45; SX219-21). Thomas had not seen Appellant with that watch\n\nor that property before. (RR62:45-46, 52, 68). Appellant gave Thomas\n\none of the jackets and one of the hats. (RR62:46; SX16, 19).\n\n     On Tuesday, Lonnie heard on the radio that a lawyer and his wife\n\nhad been killed “in the South Dallas area, close to where I lived.”\n\n(RR62:85).    That day, Lonnie moved the property from Electra to his\n\ncousin Bobby Roy’s house. (RR62:86, 101).       Billy had told Lonnie of a\n\ncall that he had received from Kathy, “to get the stuff out of my mom’s\n\nhouse because my brother had killed some people.” (RR62:87).       Later,\n\nBilly called and told Lonnie to get rid of the property because the police\n\nwere looking for him. (RR62:87).         Lonnie put everything in a sheet\n\nand trash bags and he and Kathy took the property to Hancock.\n\n(RR62:88-89; SX87-88).     Afterward, he went back to the house on\n\nElectra. (RR62:90).\n\n     The police came and picked Lonnie up and took him to the station\n\nwhere he gave a statement.       (RR62:91, 132-35; SX223).        In this\n\nstatement Lonnie told Detective Gallagher that he saw Appellant with\n\nthe property on Sunday morning. (RR62:92-93).         He told them about\n\nthe bloody shirt. (RR62:93).   He did not say anything about the knife\n\n\n                                    20\n\for the gun or about dumping the property on Hancock. (RR62:93, 128-\n\n29).   The police were taking Lonnie home when they learned that\n\nsomeone had seen Lonnie dumping the property. (RR62:93, 122-23).\n\nLonnie realized that he had to be honest.                (RR62:123, 125).         On\n\nHancock, he pointed out the property that he and Kathy had dumped.\n\n(RR62:94). Lonnie was placed under arrest for murder.9 (RR62:94, 96).\n\nHe gave a second statement. (RR62:95; SX224). In this statement, he\n\ntold police about the bloody knife, the bloody shirt, the pistol, and how\n\nthe property moved from Electra to Hancock. (RR62:95, 135; SX224).\n\n       After Lonnie’s arrest, Billy started receiving calls from Appellant.\n\n(RR62:156-57).      During one call, Appellant said he was coming to the\n\nhouse to get his clothes. (RR62:158, 187). Appellant also said “[t]hat he\n\nwas going to kill us.” (RR62:159). During another call, Appellant said\n\n“[t]hat he was going to kill us all if he didn’t get what he wanted.”\n\n(RR62:160).     He wanted “[h]is money and clothes.” (RR62:161).                 The\n\nthreat to kill was directed at Billy and their mother. (RR62:163). Billy\n\ncalled the police. (RR62:188). He was told to call back if Appellant\n\nwent to the house. (RR62:188).\n\n9After Lonnie testified at the trial in 1987, his case was “dismissed for insufficient\nevidence.” (RR62:97, 137).\n                                         21\n\f        That night, Appellant returned to the Electra house. (RR62:164-\n\n65). Appellant and Billy discussed Lonnie and money.10 (RR62:164-65,\n\n205, 207, 216-17).        Appellant wanted Billy to give him $8,000.\n\n(RR62:165, 193). Appellant went to the back room, came back, pointed\n\na gun at Billy’s head and then pulled the trigger.11 (RR62:166, 193-94,\n\n205).     He pulled the trigger six times. (RR62:166, 194). Billy told\n\nAppellant that the police had called. (RR62:167).           Appellant said that\n\n“he didn’t know what the police were looking for him for unless they\n\nhad some money to give him.”             (RR62:167).       If Billy didn’t give\n\nAppellant his money or clothes, Appellant was going to kill the family.\n\n(RR62:167-68). Appellant was upset. (RR62:170).\n\n        Lonnie’s father, Lonnie Burrell,12 went to the house on Electra\n\nthat night. (RR62:225). When he arrived, Appellant was walking out.\n\n(RR62:226). Appellant asked where Lonnie was. (RR62:226). Burrell\n\nsaid Lonnie was probably in jail for something that Appellant did.\n\n10 On direct examination, Billy testified that the encounter with Appellant and the\ngun occurred on Tuesday night. On cross-examination, he testified that the\nencounter occurred on Monday night. (RR62:197, 205, 207, 209-14). His memory\nwas refreshed with his prior testimony wherein he testified that the encounter took\nplace on Tuesday. (RR62:209-15). He eventually testified that “maybe I had the\ndays mixed up.” (RR62:211).\n11 Billy had not previously seen a gun at the house on Electra. (RR62:200-01).\n12 Lonnie Burrell was deceased at the time of the 2014 trial. The transcript of his\n\nprior testimony was read into the record. (RR62:220).\n                                        22\n\f(RR62:226-27).    Appellant told Burrell that Lonnie did not know\n\nanything. (RR62:227). He said that Lonnie was not with him “during\n\nthe time.”   (RR62:227). Later that evening, coverage of the murders\n\nappeared on the news.           (RR62:228).   Appellant’s mother asked\n\nAppellant whether he killed them and Appellant said yes. (RR62:164,\n\n169-70, 217-18, 228). He said that “the dead can’t talk and he wasn’t\n\nthrough yet.”    (RR62:164). Appellant said that he was not finished\n\nkilling yet. (RR62:229).\n\n      Appellant was arrested later that night. (RR62:172, 229).\n\n                    Appellant’s Criminal History\n\n     The State presented evidence of Appellant’s criminal history and\n\nbad behavior while in prison:\n\n     On February 18, 1979, an 18-year-old Marvin Lindwood went to\n\nhis friend Vicki Calhoun’s house for drinks.          (RR63:68-69, 88).\n\nLindwood and Vicki were sitting around having a good time when\n\nAppellant came over. (RR63:69). Vicki invited him in. (RR63:69). For\n\nthe first couple of hours, everything went well but then Appellant tried\n\nto attack Vicki. (RR63:70).      In the kitchen “he had her in there up\n\nagainst the sink.    He was trying to pull her clothes off of her.”\n\n\n                                     23\n\f(RR63:70). Lindwood told Appellant to leave Vicki alone. (RR63:70,\n\n79). He and Appellant started fighting. (RR63:70, 79, 90). “He hit me.\n\nI hit him.”     (RR63:70).    At some point, Appellant left.   (RR63:71).\n\nLindwood stayed with Vicki to continue drinking and listening to music.\n\n(RR63:71). Later, Lindwood heard someone calling his name outside.\n\n(RR63:71). It was Appellant. (RR63:71).\n\n     “When [Lindwood] went to the door, [Appellant] was standing up\n\nout there acting like he wanted to apologize and all that there.”\n\n(RR63:71). He told Lindwood that he knew he was wrong and asked\n\nLindwood to apologize to Vicki for him. (RR63:71). He said he would\n\nnot return. (RR63:71). Appellant got up as if he were going to walk off.\n\n(RR63:71, 87). Lindwood turned to go inside. (RR63:71, 87, 90).      The\n\nlast thing he remembered was reaching for the screen door. (RR63:71-\n\n73, 90).   “That’s when [Appellant] stabbed [him] in the head with that\n\nscrewdriver.”    (RR63:72).   When Lindwood woke up, he was in the\n\nhospital and nearly a month had passed. (RR63:74).\n\n     The screwdriver penetrated Lindwood’s brain.              (RR63:75).\n\nLindwood suffered irreversible, permanent brain damage. (RR63:84).\n\nThe stabbing caused permanent damage to the left side of his body.\n\n\n                                     24\n\f(RR63:74-75). Lindwood suffered a loss of mobility to his left side.\n\n(RR63:74).\n\n     That same day, Billy, who was living with Appellant, Lonnie, their\n\nsister, and their mother, gave Appellant money to buy beer.\n\n(RR63:111). Appellant did not come back with any beer. (RR63:111,\n\n116-17). Instead, Appellant returned late. (RR63:111). Then, they got\n\ninto a fight during which Appellant cut Billy.13 (RR63:112). Appellant\n\nalso cut Billy’s friend, who happened to be at the house during the fight.\n\n(RR63:112-13). After the fight with Billy, Appellant went next-door, to\n\nhis ex-girlfriend Joyce Brown’s house. (RR63:101-02).       When Brown\n\nrefused to let him inside, Appellant broke her window. (RR63:102-03).\n\n     Appellant was tried for the offense against Lindwood.        He was\n\nconvicted of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and was\n\nsentenced to ten years’ confinement in the institutional division of the\n\nTexas Department of Criminal Justice. (RR60:223, 264-65; SX205).\n\n       In January of 1983, Michael Ferguson was arrested and jailed\n\nfor murder. (RR63:136).      He was assigned to a cell with Appellant.\n\n(RR63:137-38).    Initially, Appellant was “playing the nice-guy role.”\n13 On direct examination, Billy testified that he was cut on his forehead.\n(RR63:112). On cross, Billy admitted that it could have been on his chest.\n(RR63:115).\n                                    25\n\f(RR63:138). Appellant was religious and read scripture. (RR63:138).\n\nOnce Ferguson let his guard down, however, Appellant became\n\naggressive.   (RR63:138-39).    Appellant “started coming on to me\n\nsexually, of course. Extortion. Wanted to know if I had money and\n\nwhatnot.” (RR63:138-39).   Appellant was “[d]emanding.” (RR63:139).\n\nHe was a “predator.” (RR63:142).        Ferguson was transferred out of\n\nAppellant’s tank. (RR63:140-41).\n\n       On June 13, 1983, Steven McCarroll was in the Dallas County\n\nJail, incarcerated on a charge of aggravated robbery.       (RR63:150).\n\nMcCarroll was assigned to Appellant’s tank.      (RR63:150). That day,\n\nMcCarroll saw Appellant “raping another inmate.”            (RR63:151).\n\nMcCarroll was sleeping on the bunk on one side of the cell. (RR63:152-\n\n53). Appellant was on the bunk on the other side with “the sheet up\n\nover the top of the bunk.”     (RR63:152).    The sheet fell down and\n\nMcCarroll saw Appellant on top of the other inmate. (RR63:152). The\n\ninmate was screaming. (RR63:153).\n\n       The following day, when McCarroll got out of the shower\n\nAppellant approached him “want[ing] me to suck his dick.” (RR63:154).\n\nMcCarroll “tried to get away from him. Ended up with a broke nose and\n\n\n                                   26\n\ftwo black eyes.” (RR63:154).    “So he was going to try to force me to\n\nsuck his dick.” (RR63:154).\n\n       On August 25, 1983, then-17-year-old Larry Dean Turner was\n\nincarcerated at the Dallas County Jail on an aggravated robbery\n\ncharge. (RR63:163, 165, 173). Appellant befriended Turner. (RR63:168).\n\nAt first, Appellant “got [Turner] to wash his clothes for him.”\n\n(RR63:167). Then, he tried to get Turner to be “[h]is kid.” (RR63:167).\n\n“All the big peoples [sic] up there. You had younger people on the tank\n\nwith them at that time.” (RR63:168).      Appellant wanted Turner to\n\n“[r]ide with him: Be his bitch.” (RR63:168). Turner explained that\n\nmeant that Turner was supposed to be Appellant’s “woman.           Kid.\n\nWhere I do sexual stuff for him, and stuff like that there.” (RR63:168).\n\nAdditionally, “If he told me to have sex with people, I have to have sex\n\nwith people.” (RR63:169).\n\n     Over the course of the four and a half years Appellant was\n\nincarcerated at the Dallas County Jail, he was moved multiple times.\n\n(RR63:181-82).    Among the reasons for his moves were: placing in\n\nadministrative custody; assaultive towards other inmates; causing\n\n\n\n\n                                   27\n\ftrouble in tank; fighting; making sexual threats; unable to get along\n\nwith others; and to keep down trouble. (RR63:182; SX228).\n\n      Appellant was released from prison on June 1, 1984. (RR63:187;\n\nSX226).    He was required to report to his parole officer, Linda Nelson,\n\non a monthly basis but he failed to do so. (RR63:186, 188). Appellant\n\nwas “unstable with his residence” and he “did not maintain stable\n\nemployment.” (RR63:192-93). While on parole, Appellant tried to stab\n\nhis mother. (RR63:189). He had a parole violation hearing after which\n\nhe was ordered to go to a halfway house for six months.14 (RR63:189).\n\nAppellant absconded from the halfway house. (RR63:190).\n\n      Records relating to Appellant’s disciplinary incidents in prison\n\nwere also admitted.       (RR65:36; SX245).        While in prison, Appellant\n\nengaged in the following conduct: he created a disturbance by flooding\n\nhis cell (twice); he used indecent or vulgar language; he threw his tray\n\nout of his cell; he threatened an officer, telling him,        “If you put me on\n\nthat list again, I will do something to your ass”; Appellant refused to\n\nobey an order (multiple times); he got into a fistfight with another\n\n\n14 At the hearing, Appellant’s mother denied that Appellant had assaulted her; she\ntestified that she wanted him arrested for a few days and she knew she would have\nto tell the police something serious. (RR63:196-97). The assault against Appellant’s\nmother was reduced to a Class C misdemeanor. (RR63:196).\n                                        28\n\finmate; he threw two glasses of water at an officer, striking him on the\n\nface and chest; he was found in possession of contraband (multiple\n\ntimes); and, he threatened an officer, telling him, “I’m going to burn\n\nyour ass.” (RR65:37-40; SX245).\n\n                            Appellant’s Case\n\n      Appellant’s cousin, Anthony Penagraph, testified that he and\n\nAppellant grew up “over there in Frazier Court.” (RR65:43).          It was\n\ndifficult there because in that area “you go to the store, you go to school,\n\nyou had to fight. And Kenneth was not the type of person that was a\n\nfighting person.”   (RR65:44).    Anthony testified that Appellant was\n\npicked on and had to be rescued a couple of times.         (RR65:47).     If\n\nAppellant had to defend himself, however, he would. (RR65:56).\n\n      Appellant’s mother worked a lot. (RR66:78). According to several\n\nof Appellant’s cousins, Shirley treated Appellant differently than her\n\nother children. (RR65:51; RR66:80, 129). “[W]hen it came to Kenneth .\n\n. .   she didn’t do too much for him.       Just to get by.”    (RR65:51).\n\nAppellant did not have a father figure growing up. (RR66:77).\n\n      According to Anthony, Appellant “was a little slow[.]” (RR65:49).\n\nAppellant made it through school but “they would help you get through\n\n\n                                     29\n\fthose     grades.”   (RR65:49).   His        grades   were   “low.”   (RR65:49).\n\nAppellant’s cousin Cynthia Penagraph Rice also believed that Appellant\n\nwas slower than others. (RR66:130). She testified that:\n\n        We always thought that. Because sometimes it will take\n        him, like, quite a minute to kind of catch on. He would say,\n        “What you say?” You know, he was slow.\n\n(RR66:131).\n\n        When he was 15, Appellant received a head injury at Fair Park.\n\n(RR65:52; RR66:19). “It was a guy jumped on him out there and hit him\n\nin the head with some object. And he been acting different ever since.”\n\n(RR65:52).     After Appellant’s head injury, Appellant “kind of drifted\n\naway a little bit.” (RR66:84). He was “[m]ore quiet.” (RR66:85). After\n\nhis head injury, “he seem [sic] to get a little slower.” (RR66:132).\n\n        Appellant’s cousin Bobby testified that Appellant never did any\n\ndrugs around him. (RR66:90).       He had seen him drink beer, however.\n\n(RR66:90).\n\n        Rice was surprised when she learned that Appellant was arrested\n\nfor the Finch murders. (RR66:135). She testified that Appellant is “not\n\nthat type.” (RR66:135). She did not think that Appellant could have\n\ncommitted the offense by himself. (RR66:135).\n\n                                        30\n\f      Rodney Turner is Appellant’s half-brother.15 (RR66:96). Growing\n\nup, Turner had only brief interaction with Appellant. (RR66:96). In\n\n1990, however, he and Appellant reconnected by writing letters when\n\nthey were both in prison. (RR66:97). The men encouraged each other\n\nthrough their letters. (RR66:97). Appellant would include in his letters\n\ncitations to scripture for Turner to look up in the Bible. (RR66:106).\n\nWhen Turner was let out on parole, he visited Appellant in the Dallas\n\nCounty Jail. (RR66:101-02). During their twice-weekly visits, the men\n\ndiscussed religion. (RR66:102). Appellant is able to discuss the Bible,\n\nscriptures, “you know - - just helpful things.”          (RR66:102).     Turner\n\nbrought Appellant’s mother to visit him a couple of times. (RR66:103).\n\nShe appeared supportive of him during the visits, but “when she got in\n\nthe car, was something totally different.” (RR66:103).\n\n      Several detention officers who have supervised Appellant in the\n\nDallas County Jail since he was transferred from prison in October\n\n2010 testified that Appellant does not cause problems in the jail.\n\n(RR67:19-21, 23-24, 41, 50; RR68:22, 25-26, 28). Van Similine testified\n\n\n15 At the time of his testimony, Turner was incarcerated as the result of a parole\nviolation on charges of aggravated sexual assault and burglary of a habitation.\n(RR66:97-98).      Turner admitted that he has ten felony convictions and is a\nregistered sex offender. (RR66:106).\n                                        31\n\fthat Appellant “stays to himself. Don’t [sic] cause no [sic] problems.”\n\n(RR67:41).   In his cell, Appellant is “[e]ither reading or sleeping.”\n\n(RR67:41). Appellant reads “novels off the law library cart.” (RR67:45).\n\nDuring Appellant’s recreation time, he goes to the gym and walks or\n\nplays basketball. (RR67:42). Curfey Anderson described Appellant as\n\n“[i]nstitutionalized.” (RR67:24).\n\n     Defense expert, James Aiken, a prison consultant, reviewed the\n\nrecords detailing Appellant’s confinement history.       (RR67:67, 74).\n\nAccording to Aiken, since he has been incarcerated, Appellant has been\n\non a “predictable scale.” (RR67:83).       Appellant has “gone from\n\ndisruptive behavior, down, down, down, to compliant behavior[.]”\n\n(RR67:83).   Aiken opined that Appellant “can be adequately managed\n\nfor an extended period of time, without causing unusual risk to staff,\n\ninmates or the general public.” (RR67:97). If he is placed in general\n\npopulation, “[h]is vulnerability level will be high. His adjustment level\n\nwould be excellent.” (RR67:97).\n\n                 Appellant’s Psychological Experts\n\n     Dr. Jim Hom, a neuropsychologist, evaluated Appellant’ brain\n\nfunctioning in 1987.     (RR65:82, 91).     Dr. Hom administered the\n\n\n                                    32\n\fHalstead-Reitan Neuropsychological Test Battery. (RR65:88).                On the\n\nWAIS-II,16 a “measure of intelligence,”            Dr. Hom determined that\n\nAppellant’s reading level is at a fourth grade level,17 his spelling below a\n\nthird grade level, and math below a third grade level. (RR65:110, 115).\n\nAppellant scored a verbal IQ of 73, a performance IQ of 85, and a full-\n\nscale IQ of 77. (RR65:118).         In his report, Dr. Hom noted that, with\n\nregard to Appellant’s low scores, “it is likely that these performances\n\nrepresent poor education experience.” (RR65:123; DX7).\n\n      Appellant performed well on the Tactual Performance Test, “a test\n\nof   psychomotor      problem     solving,    incidental    memory      learning.”\n\n(RR65:132). “This is a very challenging test.” (RR65:133).              Appellant\n\nperformed well on the Trail Making Test, Part A, a “test of attention\n\nand concentration[.]” (RR65:134). Appellant demonstrated no problems\n\non tests of vision, hearing, touch, and sensation.                    (RR65:135).\n\nAppellant’s ability for “inscription” using his left hand was “quite\n\nstrong” despite a history of being stabbed on his left arm. (RR65:135;\n\nDX7).\n\n\n16The current version of this test is the WAIS-IV. (RR65:111).\n17Given Appellant’s reading level, the results of two tests were considered invalid:\nthe Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and the Cornel Health\nIndex. (RR65:89-90).\n                                         33\n\f     Dr. Hom testified that Appellant’s “test results are consistent with\n\nsomeone who has what I believe is a significant head injury of one sort\n\nor another.” (RR65:102-03). He assessed Appellant’s intelligence in the\n\n“low 70 range” and his academic abilities at the third and fourth grade,\n\nlevel. (RR65:103). He opined that Appellant has “significant problems\n\nin reasoning and thinking,” and difficulty in sequencing, concentrating,\n\nlanguage and function. (RR65:103-04). He described Appellant’s verbal\n\nmemory as “moderately to severely impaired.” (RR65:105). He also\n\nshowed “mild motor and sensory difficulties.” (RR65:107).        Dr. Hom\n\nconceded that during testing Appellant was, at times, nonchalant and\n\n“[r]eluctant to perform.” (RR65:120, 125, 128; DX7).\n\n     Dr. Antoinette McGarrahan, a psychologist specializing in forensic\n\npsychology and neuropsychology, performed a neuropsychological\n\nevaluation of Appellant in 2012.      (RR66:15-16).      Dr. McGarrahan\n\nadministered 30 to 35 tests over the course of two days. (RR66:21). Dr.\n\nMcGarrahan measured Appellant’s full-scale IQ at 71. (RR66:23). She\n\nplaced this score in “what we used to call ‘mildly mentally retarded’\n\nrange to borderline functioning[.]”      (RR66:23).   She noted that the\n\ninterval of Appellant’s IQ is “essentially plus or minus five points,’ thus\n\n\n                                    34\n\fplacing his true score somewhere in the range of 66-76. (RR66:29-30).\n\nShe observed “significant deficits in [Appellant’s] academic skills” and\n\nmild to moderate memory impairment.                (RR66:23).       Based on the\n\nresults of her evaluation, Dr. McGarrahan concluded that Appellant is\n\nintellectually disabled.18 (RR66:24).\n\n      During the evaluation, Dr. McGarrahan learned that Appellant\n\nwas raised in “the projects” and that his family was poor. (RR66:18).\n\nDr. McGarrahan also pointed out the fact that Appellant’s mother\n\nsmoked and drank alcohol while she was pregnant with Appellant.\n\n(RR66:26). And, Appellant was born with the umbilical cord wrapped\n\naround his neck while his mother was in a car on the way to the\n\nhospital. (RR66:26).       He was never placed in special education but he\n\ndid not learn to drive; he had problem making change; he had difficulty\n\nusing a phone book. (RR66:18, 25). He had “very few jobs over his life.”\n\n(RR66:18).        Appellant was a loner and had difficulty getting along\n\nwith others.     (RR66:25).      He does not have “a psychiatric history.”\n\n(RR66:19).\n\n\n\n\n18Intellectual disability was previously referred to as mental retardation. At trial,\nthe terms were used interchangeably.\n                                         35\n\f     Dr. McGarrahan testified that, consistent with Dr. Hom’s\n\nfindings, in both sets of testing, the primary areas in which Appellant\n\ndemonstrated impairment are reasoning, logical thinking, planning,\n\nand problem solving. (RR66:33).\n\n      On cross-examination, Dr. McGarrahan testified that the history\n\nAppellant gave her “wasn’t quite accurate.” (RR66:36). Appellant told\n\nDr. McGarrahan that “he had a wonderful childhood; that there were no\n\nproblems; that he had great relationships with his family members;\n\nthat he did okay in school.” (RR66:36). Dr. McGarrahan conceded that\n\nAppellant is capable of lying to avoid criminal responsibility.\n\n(RR66:53). She acknowledged that when Appellant was interviewed by\n\na reporter, he said that on the day of the murders he went to church\n\nwith his girlfriend in the morning and then had supper at his father’s\n\nhouse. (RR66:52-53). He also told the reporter that there was no proof\n\nthat he committed the murders because the police did not have a\n\nweapon. (RR66:52).\n\n\n\n\n                                  36\n\f      Psychiatrist Dr. Jaye Crowder became involved in Appellant’s\n\ncase in 1987.19 (RR66:140-42).        Back then, Dr. Crowder performed a\n\nmental status exam, conducted background interviews, and reviewed\n\nAppellant’s medical records. (RR66:142). Dr. Crowder was concerned\n\nthat Appellant had suffered a traumatic brain injury so he referred him\n\nto Dr. Hom for testing. (RR66:142). Dr. Hom’s testing confirmed the\n\npresence of central nervous system damage. (RR66:144). According to\n\nDr. Crowder, Appellant saw difficulty with abstract reasoning.\n\n(RR66:145). “So, in other words, it was more difficult for him to assess\n\nthe   likely   consequences     of   particular   behavior.”      (RR66:145).\n\nAdditionally, “you have typically some impulsiveness and irritability\n\nthat goes with this so that people can overreact in an aggressive way[.]”\n\n(RR66:145).\n\n      Dr. Crowder examined Appellant on January 24, 2013 and again\n\non July 3, 2014. (RR66:146, 153). Appellant remembered him from\n\ntheir 1987 interaction. (RR66:149-50). In the 2013 exam, Dr. Crowder\n\nspent about an hour with Appellant and performed a basic psychiatric\n\n19Dr. Crowder testified to his memory of his 1987 examination. (RR66:151). He no\nlonger has his notes from that time. (RR66:151). He no longer had the notes from\nthe interview he conducted with Appellant’s mother and uncle. (RR66:152). Other\nthan the mother and uncle, Dr. Crowder could not recall who he interviewed.\n(RR66:152).\n                                       37\n\finterview and a Montreal Cognitive Assessment. (RR66:146, 150). He\n\nconcluded that Appellant suffered from “major cognitive disorder due to\n\ntraumatic brain damage and intellectual disability.”         (RR66:148).\n\nRegarding Appellant’s adaptive functioning, Dr. Crowder opined that\n\nAppellant has difficulty in interaction, trouble with employment, and\n\ndid not perform well academically. (RR66:157-58). In Dr. Crowder’s\n\nopinion, the probability of Appellant being a future danger is low.\n\n(RR66:149).    He admitted, however, that an absolute prediction of\n\nfuture danger cannot be made. (RR66:162). And, he conceded that he\n\ntestified at Appellant’s prior trial that Appellant “is certainly a danger\n\nif he’s not treated and not put in a structured setting.” (RR66:164).\n\nDr. Crowder also conceded his prior testimony that Appellant’s alibi –\n\nthat he was with his girlfriend between midnight and six in the\n\nmorning – was easily refutable and not very believable. (RR66:169).\n\n                    The State’s Case-in-Rebuttal\n\n     Melodye Nelson, a 25-year veteran of TDCJ, testified as an expert\n\non the prison system in Texas.    (RR68:144). She is the senior warden\n\nof two correctional facilities located in the Gatesville area. (RR68:144).\n\nShe has previously served as a major at a high-security male prison\n\n\n                                    38\n\ffacility. (RR68:146). “Our majors are what we consider our chiefs of\n\nsecurity. They are the highest-ranking security supervisors that we\n\nhave.”   (RR68:146).    Nelson testified generally about the types of\n\nfacilities, number of inmates and guards statewide, and how inmates\n\nare classified within the system. (RR68:144-45).\n\n     Inmates in TDCJ are classified “in a custody level that is suitable\n\nfor the safety and security of the institution.” (RR68:151). Among the\n\nfactors considered are the inmate’s history of incarceration and prior\n\njail conduct, the length of his sentence, and the inmate’s behavior and\n\nattitude. (RR68:152).   General Population 1, or “G1,” includes those\n\ninmates who are considered “minimum custody.” (RR68:153).         A G1\n\nmay be a trustee, which allows him to live and work outside of the\n\nfacility’s perimeter fences. (RR68:153). General Population 2, or “G2,”\n\nis the largest percentage of the general inmate population. (RR68:153).\n\nA G2 may live and work in a dormitory. (RR68:153). A G2 is allowed to\n\nwork anywhere inside the secure perimeter. (RR68:163).\n\n     General Population 3, or “G3,” includes inmates serving 50 years\n\nor more. (RR68:153). G3s may live in dormitories. (RR68:157). They\n\nare allowed to work, so long as they do not “have access to multiple\n\n\n                                  39\n\fareas of the facility.”   (RR68:158).    General Population 4, or “G4,”\n\nincludes those inmates who have multiple disciplinary infractions.\n\n(RR68:153).       G4s are “housed in cell blocks, two-man cells.”\n\n(RR68:182). They have fewer work opportunities. (RR68:182). General\n\nPopulation 5, or “G5,” are those inmates who are “chronic-rule\n\nviolators[.]” (RR68:153). G5s live on cell blocks and are not allowed\n\ncontact visits.   (RR68:182).     Their ability to purchase from the\n\ncommissary is reduced. (RR68:183). Finally, administrative segregation\n\nis “a classification outside of general population.” (RR68:154). These\n\noffenders are “housed singularly . . . [and they] recreate individually[.]”\n\n(RR68:154).\n\n     An inmate coming into TDCJ with a life sentence is classified as a\n\nG3 upon arrival. (RR68:155).     A capital murderer with a life sentence\n\nwill be initially classified and housed with all other G3s. (RR68:157).\n\nA G3 will change classification to a G2 after ten years of incarceration if\n\nhe has never taken a hostage or escaped a secure correctional facility.\n\n(RR68:162).\n\n     Nelson testified that, on average, there are about 15,000 assaults\n\nin prison each year.      (RR68:165).    This figure includes inmate-on-\n\n\n                                    40\n\finmate assaults as well as inmate-on-staff assaults. (RR68:165).              In\n\nprison, murders occur as well. (RR68:166).            There have been murders\n\nof inmates, guards, and civilian contractors. (RR68:166).\n\n       Dr. Richard Hughes, an educational psychologist, testified that\n\nstudents in the Dallas Independent School District (DISD) are routinely\n\nadministered achievement tests and intelligence tests.               (RR68:190).\n\nDr. Hughes reviewed records of Appellant’s scores on the California\n\nTest   of   Mental   Maturity   and        the    Iowa   Test   of   Educational\n\nDevelopment.    (RR68:190, 192-93; SX246-247).             Both tests have an\n\naverage score of 100 with a standard deviation of 15.                (RR68:192).\n\nBecause these tests are group-administered, they are less reliable than\n\nan individualized testing experience. (RR68:208).\n\n       Appellant was administered the California Test of Mental\n\nMaturity when he was in second grade in May of 1973. (RR68:200).\n\nThe California Test of Mental Maturity is “a group-administered\n\nmeasure of intelligence.” (RR68:198).            Appellant scored a 78 language\n\nIQ, a 92 non-language IQ, and an 82 total IQ. (RR68:198).\n\n       Appellant was administered the Iowa test in September of 1975.\n\n(RR68:207).    This test includes sections on reading, language arts,\n\n\n                                      41\n\fmath, social studies, science, the use of sources,20 and a composite.\n\n(RR68:195). On the reading portion, his score of 91 falls within the\n\naverage range. (RR68:196). On the language arts section, he scored a\n\n78, which falls within the borderline range. (RR68:196).                      Math was\n\nAppellant’s highest score; he scored a 97-98, which is just below the\n\naverage score of 100.           (RR68:197).        On the social studies portion,\n\nAppellant scored an 89-90, which is “one foot in the low-average range.\n\nThe other in the average range.” (RR68:197). On the science portion,\n\nAppellant scored an 83. (RR68:197). On the use of sources portion, he\n\nscored a 93. (RR68:197).            On the composite portion, he scored at the\n\n88-89 level. (RR68:197).\n\n         Dr. Hughes also reviewed Appellant’s grades.               Dr. Hughes noted\n\nthat “[g]rades are not good reflections of intellectual capacity.”\n\n(RR68:201).          Indeed, grades measure only “a student’s ability or\n\n20   Dr. Hughes described the Use of Sources portion as follows:\n\n         The Use of Sources is a sub-test designed to see how a student can\n         utilize sources to pursue answers to problems.\n\n         For example, multiple-choice questions might be posed that says in\n         order to find the capital of the state of Texas, you would look in A, a\n         dictionary; B, an encyclopedia; C, D, and choices like that, to see if they\n         can select the correct source to obtain information that they are\n         pursuing.\n\n(RR68:195).\n                                             42\n\fwillingness to comply, whether they bring their homework assignment\n\nin on time or whether they push through an extra-credit project or\n\nwhether they complete their class work assignment.”          (RR68:201).\n\nGrades    do   not   measure    cognitive   functioning.     (RR68:201).\n\nElementary school children are evaluated using a numerical system,\n\ngiving grades of one through four. (RR68:199-200). A one is assigned\n\nfor “rapid progress,” a two for “satisfactory progress,” a three for\n\n“acceptable progress,” and a four for “little or no progress.” (RR68:200).\n\nIn junior high and high school, students are given grades of A through\n\nF. (RR68:199).\n\n     In his elementary years, Appellant received a number of 3s and\n\n4s. (RR68:203). In sixth grade, Appellant received Bs, Cs, and Ds.\n\n(RR68:204). In seventh grade he received Ds and Fs. (RR68:203). In\n\neighth grade he received all Fs. (RR68:203). When Appellant started\n\nattending Metro North in tenth grade, he received Bs and Cs.\n\n(RR68:203). Appellant was moved to Metro North after his head injury\n\nat Fair Park. (RR68:210).      Metro North is “an alternative regular-\n\neducation program that was on a special class placement for\n\nhandicapped students.” (RR68:204).\n\n\n                                    43\n\f     Appellant’s grades stand in contrast to his test scores, which\n\nreflect an ability to do well in school. (RR68:201-02).   Had Appellant\n\napplied himself in school, his grades would have been better.\n\n(RR68:202).   There is no evidence in Appellant’s DISD records that he\n\nwas ever placed in a special education program. (RR68:207).       “The\n\nrecords from Dallas ISD indicate his education was all offered within\n\nthe general education program.”     (RR68:207).    Notably, Appellant’s\n\nschool records “are not consistent with a student that’s mentally\n\nretarded.” (RR68:207).\n\n     Forensic psychologist and neuropsychologist, Dr. Randy Price,\n\ntestified that Appellant does not meet the definition of intellectually\n\ndisabled as that term is described in Special Issue No. One. (RR69:14).\n\nDr. Price became involved in Appellant’s case in 2003. (RR69:18). Dr.\n\nPrice was scheduled to interview Appellant on July 13, 2014, but he was\n\nunable to do so as Appellant refused. (RR69:21-22).\n\n                 SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n       Issues 1-7: The trial court did not err in denying Appellant’s\n\nBatson challenges to the following prospective jurors: Biswas, Tilley,\n\nMoore, Nohe, Figures, McGowan, Prieston, and Barbosa.\n\n\n                                   44\n\f        Issues 9-23: The trial court did not err in denying Appellant’s\n\nchallenges for cause to fifteen prospective jurors. He was not denied the\n\nright to a fair and unbiased jury.\n\n        Issues 24-30: The trial court did not err in granting the State’s\n\nchallenges for cause against the following prospective jurors: Kingery,\n\nMorris, Davila, Hawkins, Kinzie, Flores, and Hogan.\n\n        Issue 31: The decision by the United States Supreme Court in\n\nHall v. Florida, 134 S. Ct. 1986 (2014), did not invalidate this Court’s\n\ndecision in Ex parte Briseno.\n\n        Issue 32-34: The trial court did not err in denying Appellant’s\n\nrequest to quash the panel of prospective jurors. The trial court did not\n\nerr in denying Appellant’s request to re-question the jurors following\n\nHall.\n\n        Issue 35-36:     Appellant was not deprived of a lawfully\n\nconstituted jury.\n\n        Issue 37: The trial court properly denied Appellant’s Motion to\n\nDisqualify the District Attorney’s Office after Appellant’s former\n\nsecond-chair counsel, Russell Wilson, accepted a job at the Dallas\n\nCounty District Attorney’s Office.        While it is true that Wilson was\n\n\n                                     45\n\fdisqualified from assisting in the prosecution of Appellant’s case, the\n\nelected district attorney and his other assistants were not.\n\n        Issue 38: The trial court properly overruled Appellant’s motion\n\nfor mistrial during the competency trial when the prosecutor referred to\n\nthe “murder weapon.” Alternatively, any alleged error was cured by the\n\ntrial court’s instruction to disregard.\n\n        Issue 39:    Appellant’s objection to the prosecutor’s question\n\nduring the competency trial regarding the 1987 reversal of Appellant’s\n\npunishment is not properly before this Court. Regardless, the same\n\ninformation was later received elsewhere without objection.\n\n        Issue 40-41: The evidence is both legally and factually sufficient\n\nto prove Appellant’s competency to stand trial.\n\n        Issue 42:     The trial court properly overruled Appellant’s\n\nobjection to Dr. Price’s testimony that Appellant exhibits traits\n\nconsistent with anti-social personality disorder.      Alternatively, any\n\nalleged error is harmless.\n\n        Issue 43:   Although Dr. Price testified regarding Appellant’s\n\nlack of remorse during a sub rosa hearing, he did not do so before the\n\njury.\n\n\n                                     46\n\f       Issue 44: The trial court did not err in admitting a silhouette of\n\na knife as a demonstrative aid.      Alternatively, any alleged error is\n\nharmless.\n\n       Issue 45:   The trial court properly admitted the photographs\n\nfrom Mildred’s and Fred’s autopsies as they help to explain the nature\n\nand extent of their injuries.      Alternatively, any alleged error is\n\nharmless.\n\n       Issue 46: The trial court did not err in overruling Appellant’s\n\nobjection to the victim-impact testimony from the Finches’ son-in-law,\n\nJames Belt, Jr.\n\n       Issue 47-48: Appellant failed to prove by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that he was intellectually disabled. The jury’s answer to the\n\nintellectual disability special issue was not so against the great weight\n\nand preponderance of the evidence so as to be manifestly unjust.\n\n       Issue 49: The evidence is legally sufficient to support the jury’s\n\ndecision to find that Appellant is a future danger.\n\n       Issue 50: The trial court did not err in overruling Appellant’s\n\nrequested jury instructions regarding significantly sub-average general\n\n\n\n\n                                    47\n\fintellectual functioning.     One of the proffered instructions was\n\nincorrect. The other was a comment on the weight of the evidence.\n\n       Issue 51: The trial court did not err in overruling Appellant’s\n\nrequest that the jury not be required to be unanimous regarding the\n\nintellectual disability special issue.   Appellant presents no authority\n\nmandating such an instruction.\n\n       Issue 52: The trial court did not err in overruling Appellant’s\n\nrequest for an instruction in the punishment charge that Lonnie\n\nThomas was an accomplice witness. He points to no authority that this\n\ninstruction is required in a punishment charge.\n\n       Issue 53: The trial court did not err in overruling Appellant’s\n\nrequest for an anti-parties charge. Contrary to the statements in his\n\nbrief, the guilt-innocence instruction did not include a parties’\n\ninstruction.\n\n       Issue 54: The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying\n\nAppellant’s motion, filed prior to sentencing, for an additional inquiry\n\ninto Appellant’s competency to stand trial. Appellant failed to present\n\nevidence of a material change in circumstances suggesting that\n\nAppellant’s mental status had deteriorated.\n\n\n                                    48\n\f       Issue 55: Appellant’s claim that the evidence is insufficient to\n\nsupport his conviction for capital murder presents nothing for this\n\nCourt’s review. Appellant was retried on punishment only. His guilt\n\nwas not at issue.\n\n     Issues 56-67:     The trial court properly denied Appellant’s\n\nchallenges to the death penalty. Appellant concedes that this Court has\n\npreviously overruled these issues.\n\n                             ARGUMENT\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE NOS. 1-7: THE TRIAL COURT DID        NOT ERR\nIN DENYING APPELLANT’S BATSON CHALLENGES.\n\n\n       In Issues 1 through 7, Appellant contends that the trial court\n\nerred in overruling his objection based on Batson v. Kentucky, 476\n\nU.S.79 (1986), to the State’s use of peremptory challenges on\n\nprospective jurors Neena Biswas, Leon Tilley, Deborah Moore, Pronsak\n\nNohe, Cassie Figures, Mary McGowan, Artherine Prieston, and Martha\n\nBarbosa. (Appellant’s Brief pp. 34-50). These contentions lack merit\n\nand should be overruled.\n\n                           Applicable Law\n\n     The U.S. Constitution prohibits the use of peremptory challenges\n\nto exclude prospective jurors on the basis of race. See Batson, 476 U.S.\n                                     49\n\fat 85; Watkins v. State, 245 S.W.3d 444, 447 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008).\n\nUnder Batson, a defendant must first make a prima facie showing that\n\nthe prosecution exercised its peremptory challenges on the basis of race.\n\nReed v. Quarterman, 555 F.3d 364, 368 (5th Cir. 2009). If the defendant\n\nmakes that showing, the burden shifts to the prosecutor to present race-\n\nneutral explanations for striking the jurors in question. Id. The court\n\nmust then determine whether the defendant has carried his burden of\n\nproving purposeful discrimination. Id.\n\n      At the second step of this process, the proponent of the strike need\n\nonly tender an explanation that is race-neutral. Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at\n\n447. The ultimate plausibility of that race-neutral explanation is to be\n\nconsidered as part of the third step of the analysis, in which the trial\n\ncourt determines whether the opponent of the strike (usually the\n\ndefendant) has satisfied his burden of persuasion to establish by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that the strike was indeed the product of\n\nthe proponent’s racial discrimination.        Id.   Whether the opponent\n\nsatisfies his burden of persuasion to show that the proponent’s facially\n\nrace-neutral explanation for his strike is pre-textual, not genuine, is a\n\nquestion of fact for the trial court to resolve in the first instance. Id.\n\n\n                                      50\n\f       This Court should not overturn the trial court’s resolution of the\n\nBatson issue unless it determines that the trial court’s ruling was\n\nclearly erroneous. See Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 447-48. In assaying the\n\nrecord for clear error, vel non, this Court should consider the entire\n\nrecord of voir dire; it need not limit itself to arguments or considerations\n\nthat the parties specifically called to the trial court’s attention so long\n\nas those arguments or considerations are manifestly grounded in the\n\nappellate record. Id. at 448. A trial court’s conclusion that a facially\n\nrace-neutral explanation for a peremptory challenge is genuine, rather\n\nthan a pretext, should be given great deference and reversed only when\n\nthat conclusion is, in view of the record as a whole, clearly erroneous.\n\nId.\n\n                                  Analysis\n\n      Appellant failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination\n                             but the issue is moot.\n\n         After the competency trial, but before the punishment jury was\n\nsworn, Appellant objected to the composition of the jury under Batson.\n\n(RR59:66). He identified eight minority veniremembers that the State\n\nstruck. (RR59:66). The Court did not immediately rule and instead\n\nasked, “What says the State?” (RR59:67). Without requesting a ruling,\n                                      51\n\fthe State introduced a copy of and read into the record, the Dallas\n\nCounty District Attorney’s Office policy regarding Batson claims.\n\n(RR59:67-68; SX3Z). The prosecutor then provided a “breakdown [of]\n\nthe strikes” to show that the State did not use a disproportionate\n\nnumber of strikes on the basis of race or gender. (RR59:68-70). At that\n\npoint, the State objected “to the Court having found a prima facie case”\n\nand asked for a ruling. (RR59:70-71). The Court stated that it would\n\n“withhold at this moment a ruling on whether the Defense has made a\n\nprima facie case or not and have the State go into [an] explanation of\n\ntheir strikes.”   (RR59:71).    The State then explained its strikes.\n\n(RR59:71-76).\n\n       At the conclusion of the State’s explanation, the trial court found\n\nthat “the strikes made by the State were not based upon the panel\n\nmembers’ race.    They were neutral in that respect, and denies the\n\nBatson.” (RR59:77).    The State then requested a ruling regarding its\n\nprior objection that Appellant failed to present a prima facie case.\n\n(RR59:77). The trial court stated that it was “of the opinion that a\n\nprima facie case was not presented by the Defense.” (RR59:77).\n\n\n\n\n                                   52\n\f      The issue of whether Appellant established a prima facie case that\n\nthe State exercised its peremptory strikes on the basis of race is moot.\n\n“Once a prosecutor has offered a race-neutral explanation for the\n\nperemptory challenges and the trial court has ruled on the ultimate\n\nquestion of intentional discrimination, the preliminary issue of whether\n\nthe defendant had made a prima facie showing becomes moot.”\n\nHernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 359 (1991); see also Watkins, 245\n\nS.W.3d at 447. Because the State articulated the reasons for its strikes\n\nand   the   trial   ruled   on   the   ultimate   question    of   purposeful\n\ndiscrimination, the preliminary issue of whether Appellant established\n\na prima facie case is moot and not subject to review on appeal. See\n\nChambers v. State, 866 S.W.2d 9, 23 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993) (stating,\n\n“where the State fails at trial to object to the trial court’s failure to rule\n\non the defendant’s prima facie case, that issue becomes moot and it\n\ncannot be raised on appeal”). This Court must therefore assume that\n\nAppellant satisfied his step-one obligation to make a prima facie case of\n\npurposeful discrimination and address only the second and third steps.\n\nSee Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 447.\n\n\n\n\n                                       53\n\f                 The State’s race-neutral explanations\n\n       At the second step of the Batson process, the prosecutor need\n\nonly tender an explanation that is race-neutral on its face. Purkett v.\n\nElem, 514 U.S. 765, 768 (1995) (indicating the State’s burden here is to\n\npresent a facially valid explanation for its strike); Watkins, 245 S.W.3d\n\nat 447. The State satisfied this burden.\n\n            Figures, Prieston, Barbosa, Tilley, Moore, Nohe\n\n       At the Batson hearing, the State stated that it struck Figures,\n\nPrieston, Barbosa, Tilley, Moore, and Nohe because they ranked\n\nthemselves as either a “3” or “4.” (RR59:72-73). The State explained\n\nthat it struck all qualified veniremembers who ranked themselves as\n\neither a “3” or a “4.” (RR59:72-73). Question No. 2 on the questionnaire\n\nasked: “With reference to the death penalty, which of the following\n\nstatements best represents your feelings?” (Figures, Juror 755, Q. p.1).\n\nA ranking of “3” indicated the following opinion: “Although I do not\n\nbelieve that the death penalty should ever be imposed, as long as the\n\nlaw provides for it, I could assess it under the proper set of\n\ncircumstances.” (Figures, Juror 755, Q. p.1). A ranking of “4” indicated\n\nthe following opinion: “I believe that the death penalty is appropriate\n\n                                   54\n\fin some murder cases, but I could never return a verdict which assessed\n\nthe death penalty.” (Figures, Juror 755, Q. p.1).\n\n       The State’s reasons were grounded in these jurors’ opinions\n\nabout the death penalty and are race-neutral.         Courts have found\n\nsimilar grounds as facially neutral. See, e.g., Mathis v. State, 67 S.W.3d\n\n918, 924-25 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002) (holding prosecutor’s explanations—\n\nthat he struck a juror because she was in favor of the death penalty\n\nonly in two specified circumstances and she felt the death penalty was\n\nimposed too frequently—were facially race-neutral).\n\n                                 Biswas\n\n     The State explained that it struck Dr. Neena Biswas, Juror 64, an\n\nAsian female, for a number of reasons.              (RR59:73).    Biswas\n\ndemonstrated concern about being a part of the trial process: she asked\n\nthe trial court whether and why it was necessary for Appellant to be\n\npresent and she stated that as a physician and healer, she was\n\nuncomfortable dealing with the death penalty. (RR59:73). She stated\n\nthat she could not take the oath. (RR59:74). She stated that she would\n\nnot follow the law. (RR59:74).    Biswas stated that she would require\n\nthe State to re-prove guilt and that she would increase the State’s\n\n\n                                    55\n\fburden of proof. (RR59:74). She stated that she would not be able to\n\ndetermine credibility but that police officers have more credibility.\n\n(RR59:74). Biswas “had Fifth Amendment issues.” (RR59:74). Biswas\n\nalso informed the trial court that she was seeking employment, which\n\nmay affect her ability to serve. (RR59:73). These explanations were\n\nrace-neutral.   See, e.g., Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 450-51 (prosecutor’s\n\nexplanation in a burglary case that the juror would hold the State to a\n\nhigher burden than proof beyond a reasonable doubt was race-neutral).\n\n                                 McGowan\n\n       The State explained that it struck McGowan due to her stated\n\nbelief that “prosecutors are out to get people.”     (RR59:75).   This\n\nexplanation does not reflect an inherently discriminatory intent. See\n\nJohnson v. State, 68 S.W.3d 644, 649-50 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002) (finding\n\nprosecutor’s explanation that a juror was resentful toward law\n\nenforcement was race-neutral).\n\n       Additionally, McGowan believed that (1) a difficult childhood\n\nmay lead someone to make bad choices to get attention and (2) if\n\nsomeone commits an offense while on drugs, he should be sent to rehab.\n\n(RR59:75). These explanations are also race-neutral. See Adanandus v.\n\n\n                                   56\n\fState, 866 S.W.2d 210, 224-25 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993) (finding a\n\nveniremember’s    views   regarding      the   role   of   rehabilitation   in\n\npunishment to be a race-neutral explanation for the use of a peremptory\n\nchallenge).\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n     The record supports all of the State’s proffered race-neutral\n\nexplanations for exercising peremptory strikes against the eight\n\nprospective minority jurors. Therefore, the trial court did not clearly\n\nerr in finding that the State satisfied its step-two burden of production\n\nto tender facially race-neutral explanations for its peremptory strikes.\n\nSee Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 451.\n\n  Appellant failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that\n       the strikes were the product of purposeful discrimination\n\n     Appellant failed to demonstrate purposeful discrimination by the\n\nState. Here, the defendant has the burden to persuade the trial court\n\nthat the prosecutor’s explanations for the State’s strikes were incredible\n\nor disingenuous. Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 457. The focus of the Batson\n\ninquiry in this stage is on the genuineness, not reasonableness, of the\n\nasserted non-racial motive. Nieto v. State, 365 S.W.3d 673, 676 (Tex.\n\n\n                                    57\n\fCrim. App. 2012). The question of pretext is a question of fact for the\n\ntrial court to resolve, subject to reversal on appeal only for clear error.\n\nWatkins, 245 S.W.3d at 457.\n\n      Appellant primarily contends that the State’s strikes must have\n\nbeen racially motivated because these jurors were qualified jurors and\n\nsome had characteristics potentially favorable to the State’s position on\n\nthe   death   penalty.   (Appellant’s     Brief   pp.35-41).   The   jurors’\n\nqualifications for jury service are irrelevant to the analysis, however.\n\nFactors relevant to determining whether purposeful discrimination has\n\nbeen proven include the following:\n\n           1. whether the State utilized its option to shuffle the\n              jury panels in a manner that supported an inference\n              of race discrimination;\n\n           2. whether the prosecutor’s office trying the case\n              followed a formal policy to exclude minority venire\n              members from jury service which was known to at\n              least one of the prosecutors at trial;\n\n           3. whether the State exercised its peremptory\n              challenges to eliminate a far greater proportion of\n              minority venire members than non-minority venire\n              members;\n\n           4. whether the reasons the State asserted for\n              eliminating the minority venire members in\n              question appeared to apply equally well to many\n\n                                     58\n\f              non-minority venire members whom the State did\n              not challenge; and\n\n           5. whether the State directed questions expressly\n              designed to elicit grounds for peremptory challenges\n              disproportionately, in a manner that suggested an\n              intent to single out minority venire members for\n              elimination.\n\nWatkins, 245 S.W.3d at 448-49 (relying on Miller-El v. Dretke, 545 U.S.\n\n231, 240-64, 266 (2005)).     This Court looks to the collective and\n\ncumulative impact of these non–exclusive factors in determining\n\nwhether an inference of racial discrimination is so powerful that it\n\novercomes the deference given to trial courts. See id. at 449.\n\n     An analysis of these factors demonstrates that Appellant’s claim\n\nof purposeful discrimination lacks merit.\n\n           1. Jury Shuffle\n\n     The jury pool was not shuffled in this case. The parties selected\n\nthe group of qualified jurors from a February 21, 2014 special venire.\n\n(RR9).   Appellant does not assert or demonstrate that the venire was\n\nshuffled or otherwise arranged in a manner to decrease the possibility\n\nof a minority member.\n\n           2. Formal Policy Prohibits Discrimination\n\n     The Dallas County District Attorney’s office’s notorious formal\n                                    59\n\fpolicy of excluding minorities is a relic of a bygone era.   It is common\n\nknowledge that the office policy of the last several years not only forbids\n\nsuch discrimination, it requires an investigation into sustained Batson\n\nchallenges and authorizes discipline ranging from reprimand to\n\ntermination. At the Batson hearing, the trial court admitted a written\n\ncopy of the District Attorney’s Batson policy into evidence for record\n\npurposes and the prosecutor read it into the record.         (RR59:67-68;\n\nSX3Z).\n\n           3. Proportionality of Strikes\n\n     Appellant argues that even one racially motivated peremptory\n\nstrike violates Batson yet he fails to demonstrate a pattern of\n\ndiscriminatory strikes.   Appellant does not identify the size or racial\n\nmakeup of the pool of qualified venire members. He does not analyze\n\nthe number of strikes used by either side or how they were used.\n\nInstead, he relies on the jurors’ questionnaires, arguing that certain\n\nState-struck jurors gave answers similar to those who were not struck\n\nby the State. Appellant then argues that the State used 8 of its 14\n\nperemptory strikes to eliminate 57% of the minorities on the qualified\n\n\n\n\n                                    60\n\fprospective jury panel, a statistic with which the State disagrees.\n\n(Appellant’s Brief p. 49).\n\n     The data evinces no discriminatory intent by the State. The panel\n\nof qualified venire members consisted of 45 people. Of these, 16 (36%)\n\nwere African-American, 23 (51%) were Caucasian, 3 (7%) were\n\nHispanic, and 3 (7%) were Asian.      The State exercised 14 peremptory\n\nstrikes. Of those 14 strikes, 5 (36%) were used on African-Americans, 6\n\n(43%) were used on Caucasians, 1 (7%) was used on a Hispanic juror,\n\nand 2 (14%) were used on Asians.      Appellant exercised 17 peremptory\n\nstrikes.   Of his 17 strikes, 6 (35%) were used on African-American\n\njurors, 9 (53%) were used on Caucasian jurors, and 2 (12%) were used\n\non Hispanic jurors.    The result was a 12-member jury consisting of 3\n\nAfrican-American jurors, 8 Caucasian jurors, and 1 Asian juror, with 2\n\nAfrican-American alternate jurors.\n\n     By striking 8 of the 22 possible minority veniremembers, the State\n\neliminated only 36% of the minorities on the panel, not 57% as\n\nAppellant alleges. Nevertheless, the number of minorities struck by the\n\nState is, by itself, an irrelevant statistic. It gains relevance only by\n\nestablishing its correlation to the entire panel. See Woodward v. Epps,\n\n\n                                     61\n\f580 F.3d 318, 339 (5th Cir. 2009) (holding that the State’s striking 100\n\npercent of the black jurors alone does not support a finding of\n\ndiscrimination and does not show any disparity in relation to the non-\n\nminority jurors).    In Appellant’s case, the correlation shows no\n\ndiscriminatory intent.\n\n     Of the 45 venire members who could conceivably be chosen for the\n\njury, 22 (49%), were members of a minority. A random selection would\n\nyield either 6 or 7 minority jurors in the 14 jurors selected (12 plus 2\n\nalternates) (or 49% of fourteen, equaling 6.86 jurors). See Watkins, 245\n\nS.W.3d at 451-52 (holding a random selection from a       22% African-\n\nAmerican venire would yield 2 or 3 black jurors because 22% of 12\n\njurors, plus 1 alternate, was 2.86).    This jury panel had 4 minority\n\njurors and 2 minority alternate jurors.     Thus, 49% of the qualified\n\njurors were minorities and 43% of the 14-person jury were minorities.\n\nThis jury had only slightly less than the expected amount of minority\n\nmembers as would be expected from a random selection of the 45\n\nqualified jurors.   Statistical analysis simply fails to show any racial\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n\n\n\n                                   62\n\f           4. Comparative Analysis\n\n     Appellant contends on appeal that the prosecutor’s stated reasons\n\nare a pretext for racial discrimination because the minority State-struck\n\njurors gave responses to certain questions on their questionnaire that\n\nare similar to jurors not struck by the State. (Appellant’s Brief p.42).\n\nImportantly, however, at the Batson hearing, defense counsel failed to\n\nprovide any comparative analysis regarding the jurors. (RR59:66, 71,\n\n76). And, counsel asked only one question of the prosecutor: whether\n\nthe jurors who ranked themselves as “3s,” “4s,” or “5s” on their\n\nquestionnaire were going to be struck without regard to the jurors’\n\nqualifications.   (RR59:76). The prosecutor was not questioned any\n\nfurther regarding his reasons for not striking any similarly-situated\n\nvenire members. (RR59:76). As such, the prosecutor had no opportunity\n\nto respond to counsel’s allegations.        Appellant should not be permitted\n\nto raise claims of disparate treatment for the first time on appeal. By\n\nfailing to properly present this claim at trial, he denied the prosecutor\n\nthe opportunity to create a record on the prosecutor’s strategy, and he\n\ndenied the trial court an opportunity to rule on the claim. Whether a\n\nprosecutor intended to discriminate on the basis of race is a question of\n\n\n                                       63\n\fhistorical fact properly decided in the trial courts. See Hernandez, 500\n\nU.S. at 367-69.    State procedural rules demand that allegations of\n\ndisparate treatment by the prosecutor be raised in the trial court, so\n\nthat they can be properly answered by the State and decided by that\n\ncourt.   See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a); Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 457-58\n\n(Keller, P.J., concurring); Young v. State, 826 S.W.2d 141, 147-49 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1991) (Campbell, J., dissenting).\n\n     The State acknowledges this Court’s majority opinion in Young,\n\nthat a non-capital defendant is not required to raise a comparative\n\nanalysis in the trial court to have evidence of such considered on appeal.\n\nYoung, 826 S.W.2d at 145-46. The Fifth Circuit has applied Young to a\n\ncapital case and criticized this Court’s inconsistency in its application of\n\nthe contemporaneous objection rule to Batson claims in capital cases.\n\nReed, 555 F.3d at 370.\n\n     This Court should explicitly overrule Young.            See generally\n\nWatkins, 245 S.W.3d at 457-58 (Keller, P.J., concurring). Its majority—\n\nand the courts that rely on it—view the comparative analysis as merely\n\nan appellate argument that can be fairly addressed for the first time on\n\nappeal. Young, 826 S.W.2d at 146. In truth, it is a factual allegation of\n\n\n                                     64\n\funfair treatment between jurors. If properly raised in the trial court,\n\nthe prosecution’s response may provide additional facts for the\n\nappellate court to consider when reviewing the Batson ruling. If raised\n\nat trial successfully, the trial court can cure the error before trial even\n\nbegins.\n\n      If not raised at trial, the prosecutor’s mental process and the trial\n\njudge’s credibility decision concerning the non-strikes are simply\n\nomitted from the record.      Jurors are not products of a set of cookie\n\ncutters, and the unexplained decision not to strike a non-minority juror\n\nwho shares one trait in common with a minority juror is held against\n\nthe State on appellate review.       See, e.g., Miller-El, 545 U.S. at 244\n\n(stating, “If, indeed, Fields’s thoughts on rehabilitation did make the\n\nprosecutor uneasy, he should have worried about a number of white\n\npanel members he accepted with no evident reservations.”) (emphasis\n\nadded). The prosecutor’s explanation of his voir dire strategy and the\n\ntrial court’s ruling on the strategy is critical to a fair appellate review.\n\n      At the very least, a prosecutor should enjoy favor on appeal when\n\nthe matter is not raised at trial, much like the presumption against a\n\nfinding of ineffective assistance of defense counsel. In claims regarding\n\n\n                                      65\n\fviolations of a client’s constitutional right to counsel, this Court has\n\nstated that “counsel should ordinarily be accorded an opportunity to\n\nexplain her actions before being condemned as unprofessional and\n\nincompetent.”      Bone v. State, 77 S.W.3d 828, 836 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2002). A prosecutor’s credibility is the heart of Batson review, and he\n\nshould be accorded no less of an opportunity to explain his actions.\n\n     This Court should conclude that the comparative analysis is not\n\npreserved for review or, alternatively, presume that the comparative\n\nanalysis favors the prosecutor absent affirmative evidence on the\n\nrecord.\n\n     In any event, Appellant has wholly failed to establish that the\n\npotential jurors who are the focus of his Batson challenge were similarly\n\nsituated to non-minority potential jurors who were not struck.\n\n               Figures, Prieston, Barbosa, Tilley, Moore, Nohe\n\n          The record supports the State’s assertion that it struck each and\n\nevery qualified prospective juror regardless of race who ranked\n\nhim/herself as a “3” or a “4,” on Question 2 of their questionnaire.\n\n(RR59:72-73). This includes the following prospective jurors:       Cassie\n\nFigures (Juror 755, an African-American female); Artherine Prieston\n\n\n                                      66\n\f(Juror 1055, an African-American female); Martha Barbosa (Juror 1095,\n\na Hispanic female); Jeffrey Nicholson (Juror 281, a Caucasian male);\n\nKelsey Hooten (Juror 445, a Caucasian female); and, Christen Morris\n\n(Juror 1097, a Caucasian female). (RR59:72; Figures, Juror 755, Q. p.1;\n\nPrieston, Juror 1055, Q. p.1; Barbosa, Juror 1095, Q. p.1; Nicholson,\n\nJuror 281, Q. p.1; Hooten, Juror 445, Q. p.1; Morris Juror 1097, Q. p.1).\n\n       The State also struck every person on the qualified-juror panel\n\nthat selected number “4.” (RR59:72-73).      This includes the following\n\nprospective jurors: Leon Tilley (Juror 126, an African-American male);\n\nDeborah Moore (Juror 225, an African American female); Pornsak Nohe\n\n(Juror 497, an Asian male); Macy Haag (Juror 408, a Caucasian\n\nfemale); and, Suzanne Morrison (Juror 920, a Caucasian female).\n\n(RR59:73; Tilley, Juror 126, Q. p.1; Moore, Juror 225, Q. p.1; Nohe,\n\nJuror 497, Q. p.1; Haag, Juror 408, Q. p.1; Morrison, Juror 920, Q. p.1).\n\n     Appellant points to no evidence to the contrary.    He cannot show\n\ndisparate treatment of Figures, Prieston, Barbosa, Tilley, Moore, and\n\nNohe compared to accepted non-minority veniremembers.           As such,\n\nAppellant has failed to show that the prosecutor’s explanation was a\n\npretext for discrimination. See Broadnax v. State, No. AP-76,207, 2011\n\n\n                                    67\n\fTex. Crim. App. Unpub. LEXIS 920, at *7-8 (Tex. Crim. App. Dec. 14,\n\n2011) (not designated for publication) (holding no pretext where\n\nprosecutor struck all jurors who believed death penalty should never be\n\ninvoked).\n\n                              Neena Biswas\n\n     The State explained that it struck Biswas because she was not a\n\nqualified juror. (RR59:73-74).     First, Biswas voiced concerns about\n\ndetermining    punishment      without    having    participated   in   the\n\ndetermination regarding Appellant’s guilt or innocence. According to\n\nBiswas, the guilt/innocence portion of trial is the most important part of\n\nthe process, not the determination of punishment. Her concerns were so\n\ngreat that it would affect her ability to take the oath as a juror to follow\n\nthe law. The following exchange took place:\n\n     [Prosecutor]: Okay. So what I’m hearing from you is that\n     the Judge may give you a jury instruction and charge that\n     you are not allowed to consider the Defendant’s guilt or\n     innocence, because he’s already been found guilty.\n\n     [Biswas]: Correct.\n\n     [Prosecutor]: What I’m hearing from you is that you could\n     not follow that law.\n\n\n\n                                     68\n\f[Biswas]: Absolutely. I will not actually follow it,\nwithout the evidence, without the data. I wouldn’t do a\ngood job. I mean, I would need a lot of details. And that is\nwhat I do in my work.\n\n[Prosecutor]: And so in your mind, do you feel, based on\nyour concern about hearing the facts and circumstances of\nthe case and not being a part of part of [sic] that guilt-or-\ninnocence decision, do you feel like you would make the\nState prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt again that the\nDefendant is guilty of capital murder?\n\n[Biswas]: No, I would not. I will not make a decision.\nBecause I was not involved in the actual thing, if he was\nguilty or not. And I think that is the actual thing. Because,\nwhat comes after the fact is just, oh, how are we going to\ndeal with the problem? Problem’s already been figured out.\nI was not part of that, so I would not be able to decide.\n\n[Prosecutor]: We have to use legal terms here. You said you\ncould not be able to decide. Does that mean - - the law says\neach juror would have to take an oath that they will a true\nverdict render, based on the law and the evidence.\n\n     Are you saying that you could not take that oath?\n\n[Biswas]: I will not take that oath. Because I was not\npart of the actual decision. I could take the oath. But, like I\nsaid, I would prefer not to give a decision “yes” or “no.”\n\n[Prosecutor]: Okay. So you told me both things. So we have\nto have affirm [sic] “yes” or “no” that you will not take that\noath or could not take that oath.\n\n                              69\n\f     [Biswas]: I could not take that oath.\n\n(RR14:50-51) (emphasis added).       Shortly after the above-mentioned\n\nexchange, Biswas stated that she could take the oath, but the issue of\n\nguilt would remain in the back of her mind. (RR14:54). She stated that\n\nshe would have difficulty in following an instruction not to consider\n\nAppellant’s guilt or innocence in answering the special issues.\n\n(RR14:73, 74).    The issue of Biswas’ lack of participation in the\n\nguilt/innocence portion of trial was a recurring theme in her responses.\n\nThe following exchange took place:\n\n     [Prosecutor]: Dr. Biswas, we already talked about, in\n     Special Issue Number One, that you may hear evidence and\n     testimony that includes the facts and circumstances of the\n     offense for which the Defendant was found guilty.\n\n           So you already understand that, correct?\n\n     [Biswas]: Correct.\n\n     [Prosecutor]: But you still say that you would still - - it\n     would still be stuck in your mind, and it would color your\n     answers to these questions: Is this person guilty or not\n     guilty of this offense?\n\n     [Biswas]: Correct.\n\n\n\n                                     70\n\f(RR14:75-76).\n\n     Second, Biswas expressed concern about her ability to answer the\n\ndeliberateness special issue because “we don’t know what was going on\n\nin that person’s mind at that time. We don’t know why he took that\n\naction . . . I don’t know why the guilty verdict was achieved.”\n\n(RR14:67). She testified that she would not be able to make credibility\n\ndeterminations “again, because I was not involved in the guilty or not\n\nguilty verdict, which I think is the main crux of any case.” (RR14:70).\n\n     Third, when asked whether she would require the State to prove\n\nAppellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt before she would consider\n\nthe special issues Biswas said “Yes.” (RR14:52). But then a short time\n\nlater, she said, “I’m not saying you have to prove it again, because it\n\ncost [sic] a lot of money.” (RR14:53). With regard to the future danger\n\nspecial issue, however, Biswas agreed that she would hold the State to a\n\nhigher burden of proof because “[she] was not part of the guilty/not\n\nguilty trial.” (RR14:83).\n\n     Fourth, Biswas testified that she did not agree with a criminal\n\ndefendant’s Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself.\n\n(RR14:86). Initially, she said that if instructed not to consider the fact\n\n\n                                    71\n\fthat Appellant did not testify that she could not follow that instruction.\n\n(RR14:86).   Then she stated that she could follow the law, but she did\n\nnot agree with it and it would weigh on her mind as she deliberated the\n\nspecial issues. (RR14:86-87).\n\n     Finally, Biswas testified that she would place police officers’\n\ncredibility above that of other witnesses. (RR14:88-89).       She testified\n\nthat she “would give them the benefit of the doubt.” (RR14:89). During\n\nher questioning by the defense, Biswas agreed to follow the law and not\n\nstart a police officer at a higher level of certainty. (RR14:108).\n\n     On appeal, in support of his argument that the prosecutor’s\n\nexplanations are a pretext, Appellant points out that Biswas – like 17\n\nother jurors that the State accepted – ranked herself as a “2” on\n\nQuestion 2, indicating a belief that “the death penalty is appropriate in\n\nsome murder cases, and I could return a verdict in a proper case which\n\nassessed the death penalty.”      (Biswas, Juror 64, Q p.2).         In truth,\n\nbecause the State struck all 3s and 4s, the only jurors left for the State\n\nto accept were 2s. Therefore, this argument does nothing to further\n\nAppellant’s claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                     72\n\f     The State does not dispute that Biswas’s responses to certain\n\nquestions in the questionnaire are the same as those of other accepted\n\nvenire members.     The questionnaire should not be considered in a\n\nvacuum, however.      This is especially true as it pertains to Biswas\n\nbecause, while she may appear to be a qualified juror on paper, during\n\ntestimony, Biswas vacillated on her ability to perform the most basic\n\nduty required of a juror: taking the oath and following the law. As\n\nsuch, the State had legitimate reason to be concerned about Biswas\n\nsitting as a juror in a capital murder case.   Since the trial court denied\n\nthe State’s challenge for cause, the State exercised a peremptory\n\nchallenge.     Notably, the State struck all 9 jurors that it had\n\nunsuccessfully challenged for cause:       Biswas (Juror 64, an Asian\n\nfemale), Leon Tilley (Juror 126, an African-American male), Deborah\n\nMoore (Juror 225, an African-American female), Macy Haag (Juror 408,\n\na Caucasian female), Pornsak Nohe (Juror 497, an Asian male), Cassie\n\nFigures (Juror 755, an African-American female), Suzanne Morrison\n\n(Juror 920, a Caucasian female), Mary McGowan (Juror 955, an\n\nAfrican-American female), and Artherine Prieston (Juror 1055, an\n\nAfrican-American female).\n\n\n                                    73\n\f      The record supports the genuineness of the State’s explanations\n\nfor striking Biswas. Appellant has failed to show that the prosecutor’s\n\nexplanation was a pretext for discrimination.\n\n                              Mary McGowan\n\n       The State explained that it struck McGowan because of her bias\n\nagainst the State and because of her belief in rehabilitation rather than\n\nincarceration, even in cases involving capital murder. During voir dire,\n\nafter the prosecutor explained the special issues, he asked McGowan to\n\nelaborate on her response to Question 32, which asks the prospective\n\njuror to write the word that first comes to mind when they think of\n\ncertain professions.      (McGowan, Juror 955, Q p.6).             Regarding\n\nprosecutors, McGowan wrote “they are always out to get a person.”\n\n(McGowan, Juror 955, Q p.6).        She affirmed this statement when she\n\ntestified that “I feel like - - well, in Texas here, I feel like - - it depends\n\non the prosecutors. The majority of them - - . . . - - I just feel like they\n\nare out to get that person.” (RR42:25). She continued:\n\n      So the prosecutor - - I can understand they have to do their\n      job, too. Because they’re a prosecutors [sic], that’s their job\n      to do that. But I think sometimes it’s unfair, and I think\n      that the prosecutor is actually out to get that person really.\n      Just my opinion.\n\n                                      74\n\f(RR42:25).     Later in the questionnaire, on Question 36F, McGowan\n\nwrote that she “Strongly Agree[d]” with the statement, “The Criminal\n\nJustice System in Dallas County is untrustworthy.” (McGowan, Juror\n\n955, Q p.7).\n\n       McGowan also demonstrated a preference for rehabilitation\n\nrather than punishment.     On Question 42 of her questionnaire, she\n\nranked rehabilitation as the most important objective of punishment.\n\n(McGowan, Juror 955, Q p.8). She testified that rehabilitation should\n\nalways be the first option in sentencing. (RR42:28). “Then, if they fail\n\nrehab, if they go back again continuously, then make another decision.”\n\n(RR42:28). She continued, “But I just feel like, in some cases, where\n\nsomebody do [sic] something bad, commit murder or whatever, I feel\n\nlike rehab should be the first thing that should happen.” (RR42:28).\n\nAccording to McGowan, rehabilitation should be an option even in cases\n\ninvolving the death penalty. (RR42:29).\n\n     On appeal, Appellant argues that the State’s explanations are a\n\npretext because McGowan’s responses to certain questions on her\n\nquestionnaire matched those of other veniremembers who were\n\naccepted by the State. As previously argued, the questionnaire cannot\n\n                                   75\n\fbe considered in a vacuum. McGowan (like Biswas and like the 17\n\njurors the State accepted) ranked herself as a “2” on her questionnaire.\n\n(McGowan, Juror 955, Q p.2).       As stated above, this similarity is\n\ninsignificant in light of the fact that the only jurors that the State\n\naccepted were 2s.     Moreover, the State notes that despite having\n\nranked herself as a “2,” on Question 36C, McGowan wrote that she\n\nagreed that the death penalty should be abolished. (McGowan, Juror\n\n955, Q p. 7).\n\n     The State acknowledges that McGowan answered other questions\n\nsimilar to jurors that the State accepted:      (1) she had no moral,\n\nreligious, or personal beliefs that would prevent her from sitting in\n\njudgment of another human being; (2) she had no moral, religious, or\n\npersonal beliefs that would prevent her from returning a verdict that\n\nwould result in the execution of another human being; (3) she agreed\n\nthat life imprisonment or the death penalty are appropriate for someone\n\nguilty of intentional murder committed during the course of a burglary;\n\n(4) she agreed that some crimes call for the death penalty solely because\n\nof their facts and circumstances; (5) she ranked the strength of her\n\nbelief in using the death penalty as a “7”; (6) she believed that\n\n\n                                   76\n\ftestimony from a police officer was the same as any other witness; and,\n\n(7) she believed in the principle of “an eye for an eye.” (McGowan, Juror\n\n955, Q p.8).    Nevertheless, like Biswas, the fact that McGowan\n\nanswered certain questions the same as some accepted jurors does not\n\nchange the testimony she gave during voir dire.      It was McGowan’s\n\ntestimony that set her apart from other jurors and it was that\n\ntestimony that caused the State to exercise a strike against her.\n\n(RR59:75-76).    The record supports the genuineness of the State’s\n\nexplanations for striking McGowan. Appellant has failed to show that\n\nthe prosecutor’s explanation was a pretext for discrimination.\n\n                              Conclusion\n\n     Appellant has wholly failed to show that Jurors Figures, Prieston,\n\nBarbosa, Tilley, Moore, Nohe, Biswas, or McGowan were similarly-\n\nsituated to non-minority jurors that were not struck by the State.\n\n           5. Disparate Questioning\n\n     Appellant points to no instances of disparate questioning by the\n\nState. Cf. Miller-El, 545 U.S. at 256-57 (prosecutors used a graphic\n\nscript when describing the death penalty to African-American jurors\n\nwho were ambivalent to the death penalty more often than with white\n\n\n                                   77\n\fjurors who also were ambivalent). Nor is any disparate questioning\n\napparent in the record.\n\n                              Conclusion\n\n     Appellant has not established by a preponderance of the evidence\n\nthat the State’s exercise of its peremptory challenges against 8 minority\n\nveniremembers was the product of racial discrimination. Appellant has\n\nnot shown that the State’s explanations apply equally to non-minority\n\nvenire members that the State did not challenge, that the State directed\n\nquestions expressly designed to elicit grounds for peremptory challenges\n\ndisproportionately, or that a formal policy excludes minorities from jury\n\nservice.   The record before this Court supports the trial court’s\n\nresolution of the fact question of pretext. Consequently, the trial court\n\ndid not err in denying Appellant’s Batson challenges. See Watkins, 245\n\nS.W.3d at 456-57.\n\n     This Court should overrule Appellant’s first eight issues.\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE NOS. 9-23: THE TRIAL COURT DID          NOT ERR\nIN DENYING APPELLANT’S CHALLENGES FOR CAUSE.\n\n\n     In Issues 9 through 23, Appellant contends that the trial court\n\nerred in denying his challenges to 15 prospective jurors. In so doing,\n\nAppellant argues, the trial court violated his right to a fair and\n                                   78\n\funbiased jury under the United States Constitution and article\n\n35.16(c)(2) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.\n\n                            Applicable Law\n\n       A prospective juror may be challenged for cause if, among other\n\nreasons, he possesses a bias or prejudice in favor of or against the\n\ndefendant or he possesses a bias against an aspect of the law upon\n\nwhich the defendant is entitled to rely. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann.\n\narts. 35.16(a)(9), (c)(2) (West 2006); Threadgill v. State, 146 S.W.3d 654,\n\n667 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004).\n\n       Appellant has the burden of establishing that his challenge for\n\ncause is proper. See Feldman v. State. 71 S.W.3d 738, 747 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2002). Before a venire member can be excused for bias, the law\n\nmust be explained to him and he must be asked whether he can follow\n\nthat law regardless of his personal views. Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at\n\n667.    Appellant does not meet his burden of establishing that his\n\nchallenge for cause is proper until he has shown that the prospective\n\njuror understood the requirement of the law and could not overcome his\n\nprejudice well enough to follow it. See Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 747.\n\n\n\n\n                                    79\n\f     When reviewing a trial court’s decision to deny a challenge for\n\ncause, the appellate court looks at the entire record to determine if\n\nthere is sufficient evidence to support the ruling. Feldman, 71 S.W.3d\n\nat 744.    The appellate court reviews a trial court’s ruling with\n\n“considerable” or “great” deference because the trial judge is in the best\n\nposition to evaluate the prospective juror’s demeanor and was present\n\nto observe the juror and listen to his tone of voice.      Threadgill, 146\n\nS.W.3d at 667; Saldano v. State, 232 S.W.3d 77, 91 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2007). Particular deference is given when the venire member’s answers\n\nare vacillating, unclear, or contradictory.    Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at\n\n667. When the venire member is persistently uncertain about having\n\nthe ability to follow the law, the reviewing court defers to the trial court\n\ndecision. See Gardner v. State, 306 S.W.3d 274, 295-96 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2009). The appellate court reverses a trial court’s ruling on a challenge\n\nfor cause “only if a clear abuse of discretion is evident.” Colburn v.\n\nState, 966 S.W.2d 511, 517 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998).\n\n     Harm from the erroneous denial of a defense challenge for cause\n\noccurs under the following circumstances: (1) a defendant exercises a\n\nperemptory challenge on a prospective juror whom the trial court\n\n\n                                     80\n\ferroneously failed to excuse for cause at the defendant’s request, (2) the\n\ndefendant uses all of his statutorily-allotted peremptory challenges, and\n\n(3) the trial court denies the defendant’s request for an additional\n\nperemptory challenge to use on another prospective juror whom the\n\ndefendant identifies as “objectionable” and who actually sits on the jury.\n\nSaldano, 232 S.W.3d at 91.    When all of these conditions are met, the\n\ndefendant has been wrongfully deprived of one of his statutory\n\nperemptory challenges in that he was forced to use a peremptory\n\nchallenge to remove a prospective juror who should have been removed\n\nfor cause.   See id.   If the defendant received additional peremptory\n\nchallenges beyond the fifteen allotted by statute, he must show harm by\n\nproving that the trial court erroneously denied a number of defense\n\nchallenges for cause equal to at least one more than the number of\n\nadditional peremptory challenges granted.       Escamilla v. State, 143\n\nS.W.3d 814, 821 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004).\n\n                                Analysis\n\n     The parties asserted their challenges for cause and peremptory\n\nchallenges at the conclusion of each prospective juror’s individual voir\n\ndire. With the exception of Jennifer Wilder, following the trial court’s\n\n\n                                    81\n\fdenial of their challenges for cause, the defense exercised a peremptory\n\nstrike against each complained-of veniremember. Appellant exhausted\n\nall fifteen of his statutory peremptory strikes on the following jurors:\n\nAnnie Fenster (Juror 36); Rebecca Sands (Juror 46); Dorce Jackson\n\n(Juror 138); David Darden (Juror 186); Delores Sawyer (Juror 270);\n\nJonathan Henderson (Juror 288); Patricia Withers (Juror 323); Larry\n\nMiddleton (Juror 427); Isaac Tschewik (Juror 440); Michael Dawson\n\n(Juror 469); Angela Thorpe-Harris (Juror 495); Christopher Weinzapfel\n\n(Juror 612); Phillip Rapp (Juror 968); Nancy Ramos (Juror 1025); and\n\nJay Kirby (Juror 1052). (RR13:205-06; RR15:114; RR16:76; RR19:225;\n\nRR20:226; RR22:86; RR26:152, 341; RR27:153; RR28:133; RR32:90:\n\nRR42:71; RR44:20; RR45:68).\n\n     Appellant was granted two additional strikes, which he used to\n\nremove Nathan Sosa (Juror 1070) and James Martin (Juror 1190).\n\n(RR46:34; RR50:47).      Appellant later asked for, and was denied,\n\nanother additional strike to exercise on Jennifer Wilder, whom\n\nAppellant identified as objectionable.   (RR52:87).     Since Appellant\n\nreceived two extra peremptory challenges in addition to the fifteen\n\nallotted by statute, he must show that the trial court erroneously denied\n\n\n                                   82\n\fat least three of his challenges for cause to the other veniremembers\n\nidentified in Issues 9 through 23. See, e.g., Saldano, 232 S.W.3d at 93\n\n(noting that Saldano would have to show 3 erroneous denials because\n\nhe received two extra peremptory strikes).\n\n                             Issue 9: Rebecca Sands\n\n      Appellant challenged Rebecca Sands for cause because she\n\nbelieved that “if a person committed something intentionally, that was\n\na greater state of mind than deliberately[.]”             (RR13:133). Appellant\n\nargued that Sands’s definition of intentional and deliberate would then\n\ncause her to automatically answer the deliberateness special issue21\n\naffirmatively. (RR13:133).\n\n                             Deliberate/Intentional\n\n        During the State’s voir dire, the prosecutor explained the\n\ndeliberateness special issue.           (RR13:90-91).        He explained that\n\n“[d]eliberate falls more than intentional, but short of premeditation.”\n\n(RR13:91).     Sands stated that she could “see the difference” between\n\nthe terms. (RR13:91).\n\n\n21 For ease of the reader, the State will refer to the special issues as follows: “the\nintellectual disability special issue” (Special Issue No. One); “the deliberateness\nspecial issue” (Special Issue No. Two); “the future danger special issue” (Special\nIssue No. Three); and, “the mitigation special issue” (Special Issue No. Four).\n                                         83\n\f     Upon questioning by the defense, Sands tried to articulate what\n\nshe, in her mind, understood the difference to be between intentional\n\nand deliberate conduct. (RR13:117-18). She stated, “I guess deliberate,\n\nto me, is more short-term than intentional.       It’s like, a knee-jerk\n\nreaction, but you knew what was going to happen.” (RR13:118).         The\n\nfollowing exchange then took place:\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: Okay. So, in your mind, intentional is a\n     higher process of thought and deliberate is a little bit more\n     reactionary?\n\n     [Sands]: Yes. I think you can say that.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: I think what you’re saying is, if it has\n     already been determined that this was done intentionally,\n     then it certainly was done deliberately.\n\n     [Sands]: Yes.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: So if you were instructed that the person\n     had already been convicted of doing this intentionally, your\n     answer to Special Issue Number Two would, per your\n     definition, be automatically “yes” because of the instructions\n     of the Court?\n\n     [Sands]: Yes.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: Okay. That’s what I want to know. A lot\n     of people feel that way. And there’s nothing wrong with it.\n\n\n                                   84\n\f     Isn’t this cruel, we don’t define these things and then we ask\n     you to define them?\n\n     But if that’s how you feel, that’s - - you’re fine, if that’s your\n     definition of deliberate, is something less than intentional.\n     So question number two would be answered “yes” for you,\n     because the Court’s instructed you that it was already\n     determined that it was an intentional act?\n\n     [Sands]: I would like to see more of the details.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: I understand that. We’re just asking you\n     about your definitions.\n\n     [Sands]: Okay. That’s my definition.\n\n(RR13:118-19). The above-mentioned exchange continued on for several\n\npages, with defense counsel repeatedly confirming Sands’ view that\n\n“intentional” is a higher state of mind than “deliberate” while\n\nsimultaneously reassuring Sands that she was entitled to her opinion.\n\n(RR13:119-24).    Even when Sands appeared confused and stated, “I\n\ndon’t know where I’m at now[,]” defense counsel did not alleviate her\n\nconfusion, but merely stated:\n\n     I don’t want to confuse you. It’s just that, that is a strange,\n     archaic, dinosaur question from back in the day. A lot of\n     people have that issue. That’s why I’m asking you.\n\n\n\n\n                                     85\n\f     If the answer to Special Issue Number Two is “yes” for you, if\n     it’s an intentional act already, that’s fine. We just need to\n     know that.\n\n     And that’s your answer?\n\n(RR13:120). Sands testified that she would “have to see more evidence”\n\nbut defense counsel cut her off, instructing that she was not asking how\n\nSands would vote, but rather was simply concerned with Sands’\n\ndefinition of the terms. (RR13:122).\n\n     Importantly, at no point during the above-described exchange, did\n\ndefense counsel actually instruct Sands regarding the law or do\n\nanything to correct her misunderstanding of the distinction between the\n\nterms.   As such, Sands was not subject to a challenge for cause based\n\non this exchange.      See generally Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667\n\n(explaining that, before a prospective juror can be excused for bias, the\n\nlaw must be explained to him and he must be asked whether he can\n\nfollow that law regardless of his personal views).\n\n     A review of the entirety of Sands’ voir dire shows that she\n\nunderstood that there is, in fact, a distinction between the terms\n\nintentional and deliberate.    (RR13:89-93, 117-18, 120). Although she\n\nmay have confused legal terms when she was questioned by the defense,\n\n                                    86\n\fthe record reflects that she would not automatically answer the\n\ndeliberateness special issue in the affirmative.\n\n                              Questionnaire\n\n     On    appeal,     Appellant   points   to   Question   9   on   Sands’\n\nquestionnaire, which asks, “For what crimes do you think a sentence of\n\nlife imprisonment is the proper punishment?” (Sands, Juror 46, Q p.3).\n\nSands wrote, “NA.” Appellant fails to state why Sands’ response makes\n\nher challengeable. Regardless, Appellant did not challenge Sands based\n\non this answer at trial; therefore, this complaint is not preserved for\n\nreview. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a) (providing that a timely specific trial\n\nobjection is prerequisite to presenting a complaint on appellate review).\n\nRegardless, during voir dire, when asked to explain this answer, Sands\n\ntestified that “that’s hard to elaborate on, because I don’t know the\n\ncrime.” (RR13:112).      She then agreed that life imprisonment may be\n\nproper punishment on a murder case. (RR13:112).\n\n     Appellant has failed to show that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge for cause against Sands.         Issue 9\n\nshould be overruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                     87\n\f                        Issue 10: Dorce Jackson\n\n     Appellant challenged Jackson for cause for the following reasons:\n\n(1) in her questionnaire, she wrote that a life sentence would be\n\nappropriate in cases of self-defense or mental illness; (2) she would\n\nplace a burden on the defense to provide evidence in connection with the\n\nmitigation special issue; and, (3) she would increase the burden of proof\n\non the intellectual disability special issue. (RR15:111-12).\n\n                             Questionnaire\n\n     After questioning concluded, Appellant challenged Jackson for\n\ncause because “in her questionnaire, she indicated that a life sentence\n\nwould only be appropriate where a person did not intend to do it or it\n\nwas self-defense or had some kind of mental illness.” (RR15:111). This\n\nis a misstatement of Jackson’s answers in her questionnaire.         On\n\nQuestion 9, in response to a question asking “[f]or what crimes do you\n\nthink a sentence of life imprisonment is the proper punishment[,]?”\n\nJackson wrote, “maybe a crime of passion or when murder wasn’t\n\nintended.” (Jackson, Juror 138, Q p.3). Jackson never mentioned self-\n\ndefense and she never mentioned mental illness. And, her response did\n\nnot indicate that murders involving crimes of passion and lack of intent\n\n\n                                    88\n\fwere the sole offenses that should be eligible for life imprisonment.22\n\nMoreover, during questioning, Jackson testified that she “would agree”\n\nwith the statement that “the death penalty may not be appropriate in\n\nsome cases[.]” (RR15:40). She testified that she is “open to anything . .\n\n. It just all depends.” (RR15:86).\n\n                         Burden of Proof – Mitigation\n\n      Appellant challenged Jackson for cause on the basis of her\n\ntestimony that she would require the defense to present evidence or\n\nconvince her that Appellant should receive a life sentence. (RR15:111).\n\nDuring the State’s voir dire, the mitigation special issue and the fact\n\nthat there was no burden of proof on this issue was explained to\n\nJackson.    (RR15:70-76).      Jackson indicated that she understood the\n\nissue and responded in the affirmative when asked whether she could\n\nconsider mitigating evidence “whether it exists or not[.]” (RR15:81-82).\n\nWhen she was questioned by the defense, the following exchange took\n\nplace:\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: Again, my question was: Would you\n      require the Defense - - this table over here, the Defense - - to\n\n22Defense counsel referenced this question during voir dire, but, because it was in\nthe middle of a series of questions, Jackson never specifically answered him.\n(RR15:86).\n                                        89\n\f     provide you or convince you that the person should receive a\n     life sentence instead of a death sentence?\n\n     [Jackson]: Would I want you to provide evidence to have a\n     life sentence instead of death?\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: Correct.\n\n     [Jackson]: But that’s where I’m confused. Because, based on\n     all of this - - going through the steps, wouldn’t I basically be\n     taking that into consideration the whole time?\n\n           You’re going to provide evidence and they are, too,\n     right?\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: Well, what I’m saying, on that issue,\n     nobody has a burden. What I’m asking you is: Would you\n     need - - in order for you to answer that question, would you\n     require the Defense to provide you with mitigation evidence\n     before you could answer Special Issue Number Four?\n\n     [Jackson]: Yes.\n\n(RR15:109-10).   The defense immediately concluded its questioning.\n\n(RR15:110).\n\n     Jackson was not challengeable for cause on the basis of the above-\n\nmentioned exchange. A veniremember is not challengeable for cause\n\nsimply because she will place the burden of proof on mitigation on the\n\ndefense. Saldano, 232 S.W.3d at 92.\n\n                                    90\n\f         Burden of Proof – Intellectual Disability Special Issue\n\n     During questioning, defense counsel reminded Jackson that the\n\ndefense bears the burden on the intellectual disability special issue.\n\n(RR15:92). He asked Jackson what she thought about the fact that the\n\nburden – preponderance of the evidence – was “a lower burden” than\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.     (RR15:93).    Jackson answered, “There\n\nshould be a preponderance of the evidence. I should be able to say I’m\n\nclear on that.”   (RR15:93).    Defense counsel attempted to clarify\n\nJackson’s definition. The following exchange took place:\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: How clear would you want to be?\n\n     [Jackson]: Clear enough to say I feel good about it.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: And if it’s more likely than not, is that\n     enough for you?\n\n     Or would you want “I want to be really sure. I want to be\n     sure beyond a reasonable doubt”?\n\n     [Jackson]: I want to be sure.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: And sure, in your mind, does that also fit\n     into your definition of beyond a reasonable doubt? However\n     you view it. We can’t define it for you.\n\n\n\n\n                                     91\n\f     [Jackson]:   Maybe, beyond a reasonable doubt             is\n     preponderance or different. But the same kind of - -\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: I’m sorry?\n\n     [Jackson]: I said, they’re kind of the same. I want to be\n     clear either way.\n\n(RR15:93-94).   Defense counsel tried to understand whether Jackson’s\n\nneed to be “clear” was equivalent to a preponderance of the evidence or\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. (RR15:93-98). Jackson would not be pinned\n\ndown except to say that she would “want to be sure.” (RR15:95). There\n\nis no evidence to suggest that Jackson would increase the burden on the\n\ndefense on this issue. Indeed, she testified that she “would want to\n\nunderstand and be sure, based on whatever the criteria is.” (RR15:97)\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n     Appellant has failed to show that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge for cause against Jackson. Issue 10\n\nshould be overruled.\n\n                       Issue 11: David Darden\n\n     Appellant challenged Darden for the following reasons: (1) the\n\nresponses in his questionnaire show that Darden had already formed\n\nthe opinion that the appropriate punishment in this type of case was\n\n                                  92\n\fthe death penalty; and, (2) he believed that if a person was guilty of\n\ncapital murder, that person will always be a future danger.    (RR16:72-\n\n73).\n\n                               Questionnaire\n\n       After questioning, the defense challenged Darden for cause based\n\non his responses to two questions on his questionnaire: Question 8 and\n\nQuestion 11. (Darden, Juror 186, Q.p.3). Question 8 asks jurors “For\n\nwhat crimes do you think the death penalty is the proper\n\npunishment?”      (Darden, Juror 186, Q p.3) (emphasis in original).\n\nDarden wrote, “murder in the commission of crimes.” (Darden, Juror\n\n186, Q p.3).    Darden’s response does not reflect a bias against the law\n\nor Appellant.    To the contrary, Darden’s response was consistent with\n\nthe law.    The law provides that the death penalty is available for\n\nintentional murder committed in the course of committing or\n\nattempting to commit certain specified offenses. See Tex. Penal Code\n\nAnn. § 19.03(a)(2) (West Supp. 2015) (capital murder includes\n\nintentional murder “in the course of committing or attempting to\n\ncommit kidnapping, burglary, robbery, aggravated sexual assault,\n\narson, obstruction or retaliation, or terroristic threat”).\n\n\n                                      93\n\f      Question 11 asks jurors whether they agree with the statement\n\nthat “‘The death penalty is reserved for those defendants that are such\n\na threat to society that even incarceration does not remove the\n\npossibility of future violent acts.’” (Darden, Juror 186, Q p.3). Darden\n\nwrote that he agreed with the statement and that “if his/her crimes are\n\nthat bad, death is appropriate in my mind.” (Darden, Juror 186, Q p.3).\n\nAs above, this response does not reflect a bias against the law or\n\nAppellant and, in fact, was consistent with the law. In a death penalty\n\ncase, if the defendant is found guilty, jurors are asked to decide\n\n“whether there is a probability that the defendant would commit\n\ncriminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to\n\nsociety[.]”   Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.0711, §3(b)(2) (West\n\nSupp. 2015). Although the wording is slightly different, the statement\n\nin Question 11 is essentially asking jurors whether they agree with the\n\nlaw. Darden’s response indicated an agreement with – not bias against\n\n– the law.\n\n                        Future Dangerousness\n\n      Appellant also challenged Darden for cause because when he was\n\nasked for “his personal views” regarding the future danger special issue,\n\n\n                                   94\n\fDarden “indicated . . . once he’s been convinced that the person is guilty\n\nof capital murder . . . and he was convinced that the person would be a\n\nfuture danger, that he could never answer Special Issue Number Three\n\nin a way that would result in a life sentence.” (RR16:73).       This basis\n\nfor challenge is not completely clear. If a juror were to find, as counsel’s\n\nchallenge suggests, that a person is a “future danger,” then, following\n\nhis oath, the juror would answer the future danger special issue in the\n\naffirmative. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art 37.0711(e) (West Supp.\n\n2015).   If a juror were to find that a person is a “future danger,” then,\n\nfollowing his oath, the juror would not answer the future danger special\n\nissue in the negative, which would then result in a life sentence.\n\n     During the Defense’s voir dire, counsel asked multiple questions\n\nabout Darden’s feelings about voting for a convicted capital murderer to\n\nreceive a life sentence. (RR16:63-67). At no point, however, did he\n\nexplain the law and then ask whether Darden could set aside his\n\nfeelings and follow the law. See generally Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667\n\n(explaining that, before a prospective juror can be excused for bias, the\n\nlaw must be explained to him and he must be asked whether he can\n\nfollow that law regardless of his personal views).\n\n\n                                     95\n\f       To the extent that any of Darden’s responses during the defense\n\nvoir dire may be interpreted as contradicting his responses during the\n\nState’s voir dire, this Court should defer to the trial court’s resolution of\n\nhis responses.   See Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 744. The reviewing court\n\nmust give great deference to the trial court’s decision on a challenge for\n\ncause based on the trial judge’s opportunity to observe the venire\n\nmember during voir dire. Id. When the record reflects that a prospective\n\njuror vacillated or equivocated on his ability to follow the law, the\n\nreviewing court must defer to the trial judge. Gardner, 306 S.W.3d at\n\n295.\n\n       Appellant has failed to show that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge for cause against Darden. Issue 11\n\nshould be overruled.\n\n                         Issue 12: Delores Sawyer\n\n       Appellant challenged Sawyer for cause because, on two occasions,\n\nshe testified that in deciding the mitigation special issue, she would\n\ntake Appellant’s facial expressions into account. (RR19:224-25).\n\nDuring the State’s voir dire, in response to a line of questioning\n\n\n\n\n                                     96\n\fregarding her ability to find that a person would not be a future danger,\n\nthe following exchange took place:\n\n     [Sawyer]: Because, once again, I haven’t heard all the facts.\n     I believe, if a person shows remorse or some sign of\n     rehabilitation, there’s a possibility that that may not occur\n     in future situations.\n\n     [Prosecutor]: Okay. Tell me what you mean by “remorse”.\n     [sic]\n\n     [Sawyer]: What I do, I pay a lot [of] attention to their\n     demeanor, the body language, if they appear to be\n     somewhat hostile or somewhat combative. You don’t have\n     to be verbal, as far as being combative or hostile. You can\n     look at a person’s body language, his or her eye contact. I’m\n     very good be [sic] reading someone.\n\n     I guess, it comes from my law enforcement training in the\n     past. Because, a lot of times in-law enforcement, you cannot\n     survive if you are not aware of a potential act or an attack\n     within the law enforcement environment. Not only do you\n     have to work in a law enforcement environment, it can\n     happen on your job. We see this everyday.\n\n     What just recently happened in Fort Hood. No one came to\n     work that day and think [sic] that they’re going to have an\n     adverse situation to deal with. So it just depends on a lot of\n     variables and factors. But the individual - - I don’t know\n     the history. It just kind of depends on what I find out about\n     that person. It doesn’t have to be verbal. Body language,\n     like I said. Showing some sign of remorse.\n\n\n                                     97\n\f(RR19:179-80).   During the defense’s voir dire, counsel questioned\n\nSawyer as follows:\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: Let me just ask you this: Do you feel\n     like that you would need to hear from the Defendant, to find\n     out if he had remorse for something, in a hypothetical case?\n\n     Would you need to hear how that person felt about it, before\n     you could consider a life sentence?\n\n     [Sawyer]: No. Like I said, the facts would have already\n     been presented. Like I said earlier, I would watch the\n     Defendant’s body language.       He doesn’t have to say\n     anything. You can tell a lot about a person, whether or not\n     he is feeling remorse, by his body language. If you’re in a\n     court of law and the Defendant (demonstrating). [sic] If\n     you’re in a court of law and the Defendant is, like, just so\n     distraught by what has occurred - -\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: Okay. All right. So you can read ‘em,\n     kind of.\n\n     [Sawyer]: Yes.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]:     Have you been able to read the\n     Defendant in this courtroom today?\n\n     [Sawyer]: Well, when I came in here, I was focusing over\n     here. I saw him. Now, I’m looking at him now. He seems\n     calm and - - I don’t want to use - - well, tranquil means the\n     same as calm. But he seems just calm. Not agitated, not - -\n     he doesn’t appear hostile to me.\n\n\n                                  98\n\f     [Defense Counsel]: Okay. So have you formed any opinions\n     about his character, in just observing him in court?\n\n     [Sawyer]: No, I have not. Once I hear the facts, I may.\n     But, at this point, no.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: Okay. And how he reacts to whatever\n     he hears in court.\n\n     [Sawyer]: Yes.\n\n(RR19:218-20).    The prosecutor objected that the defense was “inviting\n\nthe juror to consider any facts and circumstances that would be outside\n\nof the record.” (RR19:220). The objection was sustained. (RR19:220).\n\n     A defendant’s non-testimonial demeanor is not evidence subject to\n\nreference by the State or the defense. See Good v. State, 723 S.W.2d\n\n734, 736 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986)(discussing comment on defendant’s\n\ndemeanor by the State).     It follows that jurors should not consider the\n\ndefendant’s non-testimonial demeanor. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann.\n\nart. 38.08 (West 2005) (prohibiting any comment on the right of an\n\naccused to remain silent or his failure to testify).\n\n     In this case, defense counsel never explained to Sawyer that if she\n\nwere selected as a juror, she would not be allowed to consider\n\nAppellant’s non-testimonial demeanor.          She never asked whether\n\n                                     99\n\fSawyer could set aside her desire to consider Appellant’s demeanor and\n\nconsider only the evidence properly presented.        See Threadgill, 146\n\nS.W.3d at 667.\n\n     On appeal, Appellant also challenges Sawyer because, in her\n\nquestionnaire, she indicated support for the death penalty; she thought\n\nthe death penalty was seldom used; and she agreed with a statement\n\nthat jurors should do what they believe is right, even if it is contrary to\n\nthe law. (Appellant’s Br. p.59). These complaints are not preserved for\n\nreview because they were not raised at trial. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a)\n\n(providing that a timely specific trial objection is prerequisite to\n\npresenting a complaint on appellate review).\n\n     Appellant has failed to show that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge for cause against Sawyer. Issue 12\n\nshould be overruled.\n\n                       Issue 13: Jonathan Henderson\n\n     Appellant challenged Henderson for cause because: (1) once he\n\nfound a person to be a future danger, the mitigation issue “would really\n\nnot be much to him”; and (2) he was evasive. (RR20:201-02).\n\n\n\n\n                                    100\n\f                   Future Dangerousness/Mitigation\n\n     Appellant challenged Henderson on the basis that he would\n\nautomatically assess the death penalty if he found that the murder was\n\ncommitted deliberately and if the defendant was not intellectually\n\ndisabled and was a future danger. During the State’s voir dire, however,\n\nHenderson testified that he was “[a]bsolutely” open to hearing evidence\n\nin mitigation. (RR20:157). He affirmed that he would keep an open\n\nmind and consider all evidence when deciding the mitigation special\n\nissue. (RR20:163-64).   He confirmed his understanding that there are\n\nno “automatic answers.” (RR20:164).\n\n     During the defense’s voir dire, the following exchange took place:\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: Right. In a hypothetical situation, what\n     are your feelings about the person not receiving the death\n     penalty but receive [sic] a life sentence instead?\n\n     Do you have any feelings, either way?\n\n     [Henderson]: Yes, I do.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: Tell me. What are they?\n\n     [Henderson]: With the hypothetical situation of a man or\n     woman or a person, I should say, committing that type of a\n     crime, it’s almost like an eye for an eye. If they can do it,\n     then they ought to be able to receive it.\n\n                                  101\n\f     ...\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: “You take a life, we take your life.”\n\n     What do you think about that?\n\n     [Henderson]: That’s when I say the facts have to be in line.\n     Because taking a life for a life, and all the facts are the\n     same, leading to that point, then it should be.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: Then this should be the death penalty\n     instead of life?\n\n     Is that what you’re saying?\n\n     [Henderson]: Yes.\n\n(RR20:174-76).    Henderson did not testify that he would not consider\n\nevidence in mitigation or that he would automatically answer the\n\nspecial issues in a way that the death penalty would result.         He\n\ntestified that “the facts have to be in line.” (RR20:175).\n\n     Defense counsel later returned to the subject and asked for\n\nHenderson’s thoughts about a life sentence if the capital murder was\n\ncommitted deliberately by a defendant who is not intellectually disabled\n\nand is a future danger. (RR20:191). Henderson said that “[his] answer\n\nright now would be no life sentence.” (RR20:191). At this point in\n\n\n\n                                    102\n\fquestioning, however, counsel did not remind Henderson that he would\n\nstill have to consider the mitigation special issue; he asked only for his\n\nfeelings up to the future danger special issue.      See Threadgill, 146\n\nS.W.3d at 667.    In any event, when counsel suggested that Henderson\n\nwould not “need to go on anymore[,]” Henderson’s answer changed.\n\n(RR20:193).      Henderson testified that “that’s where that two-fold\n\nquestion comes in again.” (RR20:193).      He testified that “[w]ith [his]\n\nopen mind, [he] would still want to go on.”      (RR20:193).     He later\n\ntestified that “of course [he] would” be open to answering the mitigation\n\nspecial issue in a way that a life sentence would result. (RR20:195-96).\n\n                                Evasive\n\n     Appellant also challenged Henderson on the basis that he was\n\nevasive during the defense voir dire.       A thorough review of the\n\ntranscript shows that Henderson was not evasive.         Rather, he was\n\nsimply finding it difficult to answer some of counsel’s questions with\n\njust a yes or no answer. The following exchange took place:\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: No, I know. Because I’m asking you\n     about your feelings.\n\n     [Henderson]: And I’m telling you. And I want you to\n     understand that my feelings still ride with, I want to go\n\n                                   103\n\f     through the process before I make a decision. But you’re\n     wanting to know, if I had all of these things and all of that\n     came about, then would I say “yes” or “no” to this. That’s an\n     answer. And I don’t want to answer. But I’ve got to give\n     you something. And that answer is what you want to hear\n     right now, is an answer. So I’m giving you an answer, but\n     I’m not answering you, according to how I feel. If that\n     makes any sense.\n\n(RR20:193-94).     A reviewing court should give particular deference\n\nwhen the veniremember’s answers unclear or contradictory.            See\n\nGonzales v. State, 353 S.W.3d 826, 831 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011).\n\n     Appellant has failed to show that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge for cause against Henderson. Issue\n\n13 should be overruled.\n\n                          Issue 14: Isaac Tschewik\n\n     Appellant challenged Tschewik for cause on the basis that he\n\nwould place a burden on the defense in connection with the mitigation\n\nspecial issue. (RR26:340). The following exchange took place during\n\nthe defense voir dire:\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: . . .   “For me to be able to say that\n     person should receive a life sentence instead of a death\n     sentence, you’re going to have to prove to me mitigation.\n     I’m going to place that burden on you to show me that I\n     should not give him the death penalty.”\n\n                                    104\n\f           What do you think?\n\n     [Tschewik]: I think that’s exactly where I am.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: Okay. . . . The law says you can’t place\n     a burden on us.\n\n          Are you telling me that you would place the burden on\n     the Defense to convince you that he shouldn’t receive the\n     death penalty, after you’ve been convinced that he’s a future\n     danger?\n\n     [Tschewik]: Well, I haven’t thought of it that way. I don’t\n     know that I’m placing a burden on the Defense. I’m just\n     trying to keep an open mind. I’m just saying that, you\n     know, it would be difficult to find something in my own\n     mind that will mitigate the circumstances.\n\n           If I heard it and I believed it then, yes, I could do that.\n     I could certainly accept life punishment.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: Okay. You say you may not place a\n     burden. But would you want us - - would you require the\n     Defense to provide you that evidence?\n\n     [Tschewik]: Well, I don’t know where else it’s going to come\n     from.\n\n(RR26:335-36). Tschewik was not challengeable for cause on the basis\n\nof this exchange.   Because there is no law which places the burden of\n\nproof on the State regarding the mitigation issue, a veniremember is\n                                    105\n\fnot challengeable for cause simply because he would place the burden of\n\nproof on this issue on the defense. Ladd v. State, 3 S.W.3d 547, 559\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1999) (citing Barnes v. State, 876 S.W.2d 316, 329-330\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1994).\n\n     Appellant has failed to show that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge for cause against Tschewik. Issue 14\n\nshould be overruled.\n\n                       Issue 15: Michael Dawson\n\n     Appellant challenged Dawson for cause on the basis that (1) he\n\nbelieves in the principle of an eye for an eye; (2) he believes intentional\n\nmurder deserves the death penalty; and, (3) he has reservations about\n\nan individual with intellectual disability receiving a life sentence\n\nbecause that person knows the difference between right and wrong.\n\n                               Eye for an Eye\n\n     Appellant    challenged     Dawson    for   cause   “based   on   his\n\nquestionnaire which, over and over again, he would tell us under oath\n\nthat he believed in the principle of an eye for an eye[.]” (RR27:153).\n\nOn Question #1, which asked whether he was in favor of the death\n\npenalty, Dawson wrote that he “believe[s] in the principle of an eye for\n\n\n                                    106\n\fan eye.” (Dawson, Juror 469, Q p.1). On Question #18, he agreed that\n\nhe believes in the principle of an eye for an eye and referenced his\n\nanswer to Question #1.      (Dawson, Juror 469, Q p.8).      Dawson’s\n\nanswers to these questions do not demonstrate a clear bias against the\n\nlaw.    The State notes that in response to Question #5, Dawson agreed\n\nthat a life sentence would be appropriate in the proper circumstances.\n\n(Dawson, Juror 469, Q p.3). During questioning, he agreed on multiple\n\noccasions that a life sentence may be the appropriate punishment in the\n\nproper case. (RR27:110, 114, 131, 144-45). And, on multiple occasions\n\nhe agreed that he could listen to the evidence and follow the law.\n\n(RR27: 96, 101-02, 105, 119-21). He testified that “If I’m chosen as a\n\njuror, I have to abide by the law.” (RR27:137).\n\n                           Intentional Murder\n\n       Next, Appellant challenged Dawson based on his belief that “once\n\nyou committed a murder that’s intentional, the death penalty is really\n\nthe only option.” (RR27:153). Appellant cited four responses on\n\nDawson’s questionnaire wherein he indicated that intentional murder\n\nwarrants the death penalty. (RR27:153; Dawson, Juror 469, Q pp.2, 3,\n\n4).    During questioning, Dawson acknowledged that in response to\n\n\n                                   107\n\fQuestion 2 on his questionnaire he wrote that the death penalty is\n\nappropriate in all murder cases. He also testified, however, that this\n\nwas just “an answer to a question. But there’s definitely circumstances,\n\nthat all of those things should be weighed.”        (RR27:127-28).      He\n\ntestified that he did not “have an issue” with a life sentence for an\n\nintentional murder. (RR27:131). He agreed that a life sentence could\n\nbe the proper punishment for intentional murder. (RR27:131).\n\n                            Right from Wrong\n\n     Appellant challenged Dawson because he expressed reservation\n\nabout an individual with intellectual disability not being eligible for the\n\ndeath penalty if the individual knows right from wrong. (RR27:153).\n\nDuring questioning, Dawson initially testified that he understood that\n\nan individual with intellectual disability is not eligible to receive the\n\ndeath penalty.    (RR27:132).     He stated, “You don’t want to pass\n\njudgment on someone who committed a crime that was not in their full\n\ncapacity, making judgments.”      (RR27:132-33).    When asked for his\n\nthoughts about an individual with intellectual disability not being\n\neligible for the death penalty even though that person knows right from\n\nwrong, Dawson testified:\n\n\n                                    108\n\f     It’s definitely an interesting dilemma, in that you’re saying\n     someone does meet that criteria and knows right from\n     wrong. I would say that’s more rare than not. But I guess,\n     in that circumstance, you know, it’s kind of - - I don’t know.\n     Almost a gray area. You have to weigh what you’re given\n     and make a decision, I guess.\n\n(RR27:134).     Dawson agreed with defense counsel’s proposition that\n\nhis “belief system” tells him that even if a person is intellectually\n\ndisabled, that person should face the death penalty if that person knows\n\nright from wrong. (RR27:136). Nevertheless, he testified that if he was\n\nchosen as a juror, he would abide by the law.                  (RR27:137).\n\nAdditionally, later in voir dire, Dawson disagreed that he would\n\nincrease the burden on intellectual disability special issue in an effort to\n\nensure the death penalty. (RR27:141-42). The following exchange took\n\nplace:\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: Some people will say, “Do you know\n     what? Because of the way I value life, I’m not going to let\n     this person avoid the death penalty unless I’m positive that\n     they’re mentally I [sic] retarded.\n\n     “They killed somebody. They knew right from wrong, and\n     they did it intentionally.”\n\n     What do you think about that?\n\n\n\n                                    109\n\f     [Dawson]:     I think that’s a little too harsh.        This\n     questionnaire is very direct and black and white. You\n     know, what you’re proposing, there’s things to be\n     considered. There are gray areas. There are definitely\n     circumstances.    That’s why we do this process.         I’m\n     definitely open-minded, and I can hear that and decide.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: I have no doubt that you will keep an\n     open mind and listen to the evidence. But what I’m asking\n     you is this: There’s some people that say, “Do you know\n     what? For me to say this person is mentally retarded and\n     just let them avoid the death penalty when I know they\n     committed an intentional murder of another human being\n     while committing a felony, I’m going to have to be really\n     convinced that they’re mentally retarded.\n\n     “If not, I may be letting some guy off from getting the death\n     penalty, who I believe deserves it.”\n\n     [Dawson]: It’s about what the law requires. That’s what I\n     have to follow. That’s what I have to base my opinion on.\n     It’s not whether or not I think he’s really mentally retarded\n     or not. It’s based on what the law says.\n\n(RR27:141-42).\n\n     A review of Dawson’s voir dire shows no bias as a matter of law.\n\nIndeed, as previously stated, Dawson agreed on multiple occasions that\n\nhe could listen to the evidence and follow the law. (RR27:96, 101-02,\n\n105, 119-21).\n\n\n                                  110\n\f                             Questionnaire\n\n     On appeal, Appellant lists a number of other responses Dawson\n\nwrote in his questionnaire that he claims made Dawson challengeable\n\nfor cause.    (Appellant’s Brief p.64).    These arguments were not\n\npresented to the trial court and therefore are not preserved. See Tex. R.\n\nApp. P. 33.1(a).\n\n     Appellant has failed to show that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge for cause against Dawson. Issue 15\n\nshould be overruled.\n\n                    Issue 16: Angela Thorpe-Harris\n\n     Appellant challenged Thorpe-Harris for cause on the basis of her\n\ntestimony that she would place a burden on the defense in connection\n\nwith the deliberateness special issue. (RR28:129).\n\n                            Burden of Proof\n\n     During the voir dire, defense counsel asked Thorpe-Harris for her\n\nthoughts about a life sentence for an individual who committed the\n\noffense deliberately and was not intellectually disabled. (RR28:120).\n\nThe following exchange took place:\n\n     [Thorpe-Harris]: If they did it deliberately?\n\n\n                                     111\n\f[Defense Counsel]: Uh-huh.\n\n[Thorpe-Harris]: I could consider it. But I know personally\nit would take a little bit of proving.\n\n[Defense Counsel]: Who would have to prove what, for a life\nsentence?\n\n[Thorpe-Harris]: You (indicating). Your side. You have to\nconvince me.\n\n...\n\n[Defense Counsel]: Okay. The law says, you can’t place\nthat burden on me. But, honestly, you’d do that, correct?\n\n[Thorpe-Harris]: Right.\n\n[Defense Counsel]: And there’s nothing wrong with saying\nthat. Like I said, that’s why we ask these questions. I’m\nsure you didn’t get up today saying to yourself “I know\neverything about capital murder law and I know exactly\nhow I would act.” But you know yourself.\n\n[Thorpe-Harris]: I know the burden is supposed to be on the\nState’s side for that question. But I’m also going to be\nkeying in on what you’re saying, too.\n\n[Defense Counsel]: You would still place a burden on us to\nshow you that it wasn’t deliberate. Because it’s kind of an\nimportant decision that you have to make, right?\n\n[Thorpe-Harris]: Yes.\n\n                             112\n\f     [Defense Counsel]: That’s really how you feel?\n\n     [Thorpe-Harris]: Yes.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: So if the Judge were to ask you, “Hey,\n     Ms. Thorpe-Harris, you understand that you can’t place a\n     burden on the Defense,” you would, correct?\n\n     [Thorpe-Harris]: Yeah. I’m going to listen to you. Yeah.\n\n(RR28:120-22).\n\n     After the defense asserted its challenge against Thorpe-Harris,\n\nshe was returned to the courtroom for the judge to clarify her\n\ntestimony.       (RR28:130).   The       judge   confirmed   Thorpe-Harris’\n\nunderstanding that the State – and not the Defense – has the burden of\n\nproof on the deliberateness special issue. (RR28:130-31). The following\n\nexchange then took place:\n\n     [Trial Court]: Okay. Would you require that the Defense\n     prove to you that the act was not deliberately?\n\n     Or would you follow the law and just - - if the State proved\n     to you beyond a reasonable doubt that it was deliberate,\n     could you make your decision based on that?\n\n     Or if the State failed to prove to you that it was deliberate,\n     then could you make your decision based on that?\n\n\n                                   113\n\f     [Thorpe-Harris]: Yeah, I could.       I could do it, based on\n     whatever the State decides.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, I think she also told us that\n     she would place a burden on us to prove - - somewhat of a\n     burden on us to prove that it wasn’t deliberate. I would ask\n     you to inquire - - first of all ask, if she did say that to us on\n     the record.\n\n     [Trial Court]: Do you recall saying that?\n\n     [Thorpe-Harris]: Yeah. Because I’m just sort of assuming\n     that the Defense is going to be speaking to it - - I assume - -\n     during the phase. So I’m going to be listening to what they\n     say, too. But I know the burden of proof, from what they’ve\n     told me, is on the State.\n\n     [Trial Court]: You understand that the burden of proof is\n     solely upon the State?\n\n     [Thorpe-Harris]: Yes.\n\n(RR28:32).\n\n     The totality of Thorpe-Harris’s testimony shows that she would\n\nnot place a burden on the defense in connection with the deliberateness\n\nspecial issue. Rather, she “just sort of assum[ed] that the Defense is\n\ngoing to be speaking to” that issue and she would listen to their\n\nevidence.    (RR28:132).      To the extent that Thorpe-Harris was\n\n\n\n                                    114\n\fequivocating on her ability to follow the law, the reviewing court must\n\ndefer to the trial judge. Gardner, 306 S.W.3d at 295.\n\n                            Claims on Appeal\n\n       On appeal, Appellant challenges Thorpe-Harris because she would\n\nrequire severe intellectual disability to assess a life sentence and\n\nbecause she did not trust expert testimony. He also cites a number of\n\nthe responses she gave on her questionnaire. (Appellant’s Brief p. 66-\n\n67).   These complaints are not preserved for review because they were\n\nnot raised at trial. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a) (providing that a timely\n\nspecific trial objection is prerequisite to presenting a complaint on\n\nappellate review).\n\n       Appellant has failed to show that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge for cause against Thorpe-Harris.\n\nIssue 16 should be overruled.\n\n                     Issue 17: Christopher Weinzapfel\n\n       Appellant challenged Weinzapfel for cause because: (1) he was\n\nfamiliar with the case; (2) he was evasive in answering questions; and\n\n(3) he invoked the Fifth Amendment. (RR32:89).\n\n\n\n\n                                   115\n\f                         Familiarity with Case\n\n     Weinzapfel was in high school when the instant offense occurred.\n\n(RR32:14-15). He did not recall all of the details of the case, but he did\n\nremember that it “was the headlined story” and “that there was mental\n\nhealth that was in question and whether or not they were going to seek\n\nthe death penalty[.]” (RR32:50, 51).      At the time, in school, the issue\n\n“from a generic standpoint” was used as a source of discussion and\n\ndebate. (RR32:51).    “We argued both sides of that [issue].” (RR32:51).\n\nAlthough he knew the details of this case when he was in school, he\n\ncould not presently recall them “off the top of [his] head.” (RR32:87).\n\n     Weinzapfel was not challengeable for cause simply because he had\n\nsome knowledge of the facts of the case. Qualified jurors need not be\n\ntotally ignorant of the facts and issues involved in the case.            See\n\nMurphy v. Florida, 421 U.S. 794, 799-800 (1975).        Even if this Court\n\nassumes that Weinzapfel had some limited knowledge of the case, he\n\nnevertheless denied having a pre-formed opinion regarding the case.\n\n(RR32:51-52). Indeed, he stated, “I have to be honest with you, I don’t\n\nremember which side it went. I’ve had too much other stuff on my plate\n\n\n\n\n                                    116\n\fto think too much about it.” (RR32:52). There is nothing in the record\n\nto show that Weinzapfel was biased against Appellant.\n\n                                Evasive\n\n     Appellant challenged Weinzapfel on the basis of his being\n\n“evasive” during questioning. At one point during questioning, defense\n\ncounsel began a series of questions asking Weinzapfel for his thoughts\n\nabout a life sentence if the offense was determined to be deliberate, and\n\nthen if the person is found to be a future danger.         (RR32:79-81).\n\nWeinzapfel testified that he was “stuck in the thought process.”\n\n(RR32:81).   He was having difficulty answering counsel’s questions\n\nwithout having the evidence. (RR32:81). Counsel took the questioning a\n\nstep further and asked whether the circumstances of the defendant’s\n\nchildhood or disabilities would be relevant.    (RR32:82).   Weinzapfel\n\nresponded:\n\n     Again, that’s why I’m hoping that it’s not a matter of what I\n     think but it’s a matter of what I see and what evidence is\n     presented. And then - - I’m not trying to evade that answer.\n     I don’t know. It’s a pretty serious answer, to just be\n     halfhearted about.\n\n\n\n\n                                   117\n\f(RR32:82). A review of the record shows that Weinzapfel was not trying\n\nto be evasive; he was simply finding it difficult to thoughtfully answer\n\ncounsel’s questions without knowing the evidence. (RR32:82).\n\n                            Fifth Amendment\n\n     Appellant also challenged Weinzapfel because he invoked the\n\nFifth Amendment. (RR32:62, 64).          A review of the record shows that\n\nWeinzapfel asked to “take the Fifth” on two occasions, but he did so, not\n\nin the traditional sense.    (RR32:62, 64). The first time Weinzapfel\n\nasked to take the Fifth, he and defense counsel were discussing\n\nWeinzapfel’s ability to concentrate on the evidence given the fact that\n\nhe is the sole provider in his family and would be missing two weeks of\n\nwork if he were seated as a juror.          (RR32:60-62).   The following\n\nexchange took place:\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: So, tell me: Would it be such a concern\n     that it would be hard for to [sic] you concentrate on the\n     evidence?\n\n     [Weinzapfel]: Can I take the Fifth? I have to be honest\n     with you, I work in a profession where I go to work\n     everyday. I deal with life and death. The things that are\n     happening, I can’t take with me. So I wouldn’t be very\n     honest with you, if I said it would sway me. I have to make\n     those decisions, regardless. It is a financial burden. It’s\n\n\n                                   118\n\f     going to cost my family - - cost me the ability. But, hey, like\n     I said before, that’s part of it.\n\n(RR32:62).\n\n     The second time Weinzapfel asked to take the Fifth he and\n\ndefense counsel were discussing Weinzapfel’s connection with the Darlie\n\nRoutier capital murder case. (RR32:64).       Weinzapfel is a firefighter\n\nand paramedic. (RR32:17).      His colleagues, including his best friend,\n\nwere “the primary medics on the case.” (RR32:64).       His testimony is\n\nnot completely clear, but it appears that Weinzapfel helped “prep” his\n\ncolleagues for trial.    (RR32:64).      Defense counsel asked what\n\nWeinzapfel thought “about all that?” (RR32:64). Weinzapfel testified:\n\n     Again, I take the Fifth on that. I’d rather not give an\n     opinion. It’s one of those things to sit back and watch the\n     drama unfold. Knowing what was known and the fact [sic]\n     as they were, with all the details and everything else, it’s a\n     little different than watching it on the news.\n\n(RR32:64).\n\n     The fact that Weinzapfel continued to respond to questioning\n\ndespite his requests to “take the Fifth,” proves that he was not truly\n\nattempting to invoke the Fifth Amendment. Indeed, he continued to\n\nrespond to questioning for an additional 24 pages. (RR32:64-88). This\n\n\n                                   119\n\frefutes trial counsel’s claim that Weinzapfel “would just not answer the\n\nquestion purported [sic] to him.” (RR32:89). It appears that Weinzapfel\n\nused his request to “take the Fifth” in an effort to try to bring\n\nquestioning on a particular topic to a close.\n\n                                Darlie Routier\n\n     On appeal, Appellant also challenges Weinzapfel on the basis of\n\nhis involvement in the Routier case. He fails to state, however, how\n\nthis renders him challengeable.       Regardless, this complaint was not\n\npreserved for review because it was not raised at trial. See Tex. R. App.\n\nP. 33.1(a). In any event, Weinzapfel testified that he was not involved\n\nin investigating the Routier case.         (RR32:63-64). As stated above,\n\nWeinzapfel was apparently involved in helping his colleagues prepare to\n\ntestify for trial. (RR32:64).   He testified that his “directions were very\n\nspecific . . . to make sure those guys were articulate and comfortable\n\nand knew exactly what they were needing to know, as far as from the\n\nmedical side of it.” (RR32:64).\n\n      Appellant has failed to show that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge for cause against Weinzapfel. Issue\n\n17 should be overruled.\n\n\n                                     120\n\f                            Issue 18: Phillip Rapp\n\n        Appellant challenged Rapp for cause for the following reasons: (1)\n\nin his questionnaire he indicated strong feelings in favor of the death\n\npenalty; and (2) he did not understand the questions asked during voir\n\ndire.\n\n                                  Death-Prone\n\n        Appellant    challenged    Rapp       because   he   “indicated    in   his\n\nquestionnaire he has strong feelings for the death penalty,” which\n\nAppellant contended demonstrated a bias against a life sentence.\n\n(RR42:70).          Counsel’s challenge is overly general and fails to\n\nspecifically describe why he believes Rapp is biased.23 Regardless, the\n\nrecord reflects that Rapp would have to hear “[e]verything in the facts”\n\nbefore he could make a decision regarding punishment. (RR42:42-43).\n\nHe denied that he was the type of person that would automatically vote\n\nto assess the death penalty. (RR42:65).             During questioning by the\n\ndefense, Rapp testified that he “would be open to what is presented.\n\nBut, [he] still feel[s] more strongly to the death penalty as oppose [sic]\n\n23 On appeal, Appellant cites a number of responses in Rapp’s questionnaire which\nhe contends demonstrate Rapp’s bias. (Appellant’s Brief pp.69-70). When trial\ncounsel made his challenge in the trial court, he did not specify the responses that\nformed the basis for his challenge. As such, it is the State’s position that he has\nfailed to properly preserve this claim for appellate review.\n                                        121\n\fto a life sentence.” (RR42:67-68). A juror may express strong feelings\n\nfor imposing a death sentence, but “if he also unequivocally states that\n\nhe could set aside those feelings and follow the trial court’s instructions\n\non the law and would base his verdict or his answers to the special\n\nissues on the evidence adduced,” he is not disqualified as a matter of\n\nlaw. See Cordova v. State, 733 S.W.2d 175, 184 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987).\n\nThus, the trial court properly denied Appellant’s challenge on this basis.\n\n                                Confusion\n\n     Appellant also challenged Rapp because “he might not understand\n\nexactly the questions that were proposed to him and may have a\n\nmisunderstanding as to how the scheme works.” (RR42:70).           During\n\nthe State’s voir dire, Rapp affirmed that he understood the process.\n\n(RR42:45, 49, 50, 54, 57). During questioning by the defense, however,\n\nRapp got confused by counsel’s questions.         Defense counsel asked\n\nwhether Rapp could answer the intellectual disability special issue in\n\nthe affirmative, if proven by the evidence.      (RR42:65-66).   Initially,\n\nRapp said no. (RR42:66). When counsel rephrased his question to be\n\nsure that Rapp understood his question, Rapp apologized and testified\n\nthat his answer was yes, he could answer the intellectual disability\n\n\n                                    122\n\fissue in the affirmative. (RR42:67).         Later in the exchange, counsel\n\nasked whether Rapp could “answer it ‘no[.]’”            (RR42:68).    Rapp\n\nanswered that he could not. (RR42:68). Counsel again attempted to\n\nclarify his question.   (RR42:68).       Rapp asked whether counsel was\n\nasking if he could answer the intellectual disability question no.\n\n(RR42:68).   He then testified that he could answer the intellectual\n\ndisability special issue in the negative. (RR42:68).\n\n     Appellant complains that Rapp was confused, yet the questions\n\nRapp was being asked were, in fact, confusing. At times, it was unclear\n\nwhat special issue counsel was asking Rapp to respond to. Once the\n\nquestions were clarified, Rapp was able to respond appropriately.\n\nThere is nothing in the record to show that Rapp misunderstood the\n\nprocess to be followed in this case.\n\n     Appellant has failed to show that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge for cause against Rapp. Issue 18\n\nshould be overruled.\n\n                         Issue 19: Nancy Ramos\n\n     Appellant challenged Ramos for cause because she ranked herself\n\nas a “1” on Question 2 of her questionnaire, indicating a belief that “the\n\n\n                                       123\n\fdeath penalty is appropriate in all murder cases.” (Ramos, Juror 1025,\n\nQ p.2).   Other responses on her questionnaire, however, demonstrate\n\nthat Ramos’ beliefs regarding the death penalty are not quite as rigid as\n\nher self-ranking would make it seem.\n\n     For example, even though Ramos ranked herself as a 1, she\n\nanswered “yes” to Question 5, which asked whether she agreed “that a\n\nlife sentence, rather than the death penalty, would be appropriate\n\nunder the proper circumstances[.]” (Ramos, Juror 1025, Q p.2).        In\n\nresponse to Question 15, she ranked herself a 5 out of 10 on a scale of\n\nhow strongly she holds her belief in the use of the death penalty.\n\n(Ramos, Juror 1025, Q p.3). In response to Question 36C, she indicated\n\nthat she was “uncertain” about whether the death penalty should be\n\nabolished. (Ramos, Juror 1025, Q p.7).      In response to Question 41,\n\nRamos ranked herself a 2 out of 10 on a scale of her attitude toward\n\npunishment in the criminal justice system. (Ramos, Juror 1025, Q p.8).\n\nDuring voir dire, Ramos affirmed that if selected as a juror, she could\n\nlisten and answer the special issues based on the evidence presented.\n\n(RR44:10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18).\n\n\n\n\n                                   124\n\f                            Claims on Appeal\n\n        On appeal, in addition to Ramos’ self-ranking, Appellant cites a\n\nnumber of other responses Ramos gave in her questionnaire.\n\n(Appellant’s Brief p.71). He contends that these responses show Ramos’\n\nbias.    During voir dire, however, Appellant did not question Ramos\n\nabout these responses and he did not mention them during his\n\nchallenge for cause. As such, these complaints are not preserved for\n\nreview. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a).\n\n        Appellant has failed to show that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge for cause against Ramos. Issue 19\n\nshould be overruled.\n\n                           Issue 20: Jay Kirby\n\n        Appellant challenged Kirby for cause because (1) he indicated in\n\nhis questionnaire that the death penalty is appropriate in all murder\n\ncases; and, (2) he declined to name his friend who is a police officer.\n\n                              Questionnaire\n\n        Appellant challenged Kirby “based on his answers on the\n\nquestionnaire; that he believes the death penalty is appropriate in all\n\nmurder cases.” (RR45:68). Kirby ranked himself as a “1” on Question 2\n\n\n                                    125\n\fof his questionnaire, indicating a belief that “the death penalty is\n\nappropriate in all murder cases.”        (Kirby, Juror 1052, Q p.1).   On\n\nQuestion 5, he answered “no” to a question asking if he agreed that a\n\nlife sentence may be appropriate under the proper circumstances.\n\n(Kirby, Juror 1052, Q p.2). He wrote that “[i]f found guilty of murder\n\nwith intent the death penalty should be used.” Id. On Question 9,\n\nKirby wrote that he did not think that “life should be considered in a\n\nmurder case.” (Kirby, Juror 1052, Q p.2).\n\n     While many of Kirby’s responses demonstrate that he is strongly\n\nin favor of the death penalty, they also demonstrate a willingness to\n\nfollow the law. For example, on Question 47, in response to a question\n\nasking whether he agreed or disagreed with the following statement,\n\n“Regardless of what the Judge says the law is, Jurors should do what\n\nthey believe is the right thing to do, even if it goes against the law[,]”\n\nKirby wrote, “Disagree. If the Judge asked me to disregard I will.”\n\n(Kirby, Juror 1052, Q p.9).    When questioned by the State about his\n\nability to “keep an open mind to this process and base [his] answers on\n\nthe evidence,” Kirby testified that he “[could] keep an open mind.”\n\n(RR45:56). He agreed that he could keep an open mind to the process\n\n\n                                   126\n\finvolved in this case. (RR45:56-57). He testified that although he did\n\nnot agree that a defendant does not have to testify, he would follow the\n\nlaw.    (RR45:59).    During questioning by the defense, the following\n\nexchange took place:\n\n       [Defense Counsel]: Some jurors come in and tell us, “You\n       know what? I thought we would just hear evidence and we\n       just check a box, life or death.”\n\n             But now that you understand how this works, are you\n       telling us that you could answer each special issue “yes” or\n       “no” just depending on what you’re convinced of from the\n       evidence?\n\n       [Kirby]: Yes, I can.\n\n       [Defense Counsel]: Even if that leads to a life sentence, you\n       can do that?\n\n       [Kirby]: I believe I can.\n\n       [Defense Counsel]: Because you can see how we would be a\n       little concerned, based on your questionnaire. But now\n       you’re telling us here in court, under oath, that you can do\n       that?\n\n       [Kirby]: Yeah, I believe I can.\n\n(RR45:66-67).     Based on the foregoing, it is clear that Kirby was not\n\ndisqualified as a matter of law. See Cordova, 733 S.W.2d at 184.\n\n                                     127\n\f                          Police Officer Friend\n\n     Appellant also challenged Kirby for cause because Kirby declined\n\nto provide the name of his friend who is a Dallas police officer.\n\n(RR45:68). During questioning by the defense, counsel inquired about\n\nthe fact that, in his questionnaire, Kirby wrote that he has friends who\n\nare police officers. (RR45:65). Kirby testified that has “a friend” who\n\nworks out of the Northwest Police Department.          (RR45:65).   When\n\nasked for his name, Kirby responded that he “would prefer not to, if\n\nthat’s okay.” (RR45:65). Defense counsel did not press Kirby to provide\n\nthe friend’s name, but asked whether he knew if the friend was involved\n\nin the investigation of Appellant’s case. (RR45:65). Kirby testified that\n\nhe knows the friend “socially” and that he did not know whether he was\n\ninvolved. (RR45:65). Without more information, Appellant’s challenge\n\nfails as there is no evidence that Kirby’s friendship with a police officer\n\nmakes him disqualified as a matter of law.     In any event, when asked\n\nwhether he could set aside his relationship with that friend and listen\n\nto the evidence and make a decision based on what he hears in court,\n\nKirby testified, “Sure, I could. Yeah.” (RR45:66).\n\n\n\n\n                                    128\n\f     Appellant has failed to show that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge for cause against Kirby. Issue 20\n\nshould be overruled.\n\n                        Issue 21: Nathan Sosa\n\n     Appellant challenged Sosa for cause because (1) his responses on\n\nhis questionnaire; and, (2) he would only consider a life sentence in\n\nlimited circumstances. (RR46:32).\n\n                            Questionnaire\n\n     Appellant challenged Sosa for cause “based on his answers in the\n\nquestionnaire.” (RR46:32). Appellant did not identify the responses in\n\nthe 22-page questionnaire that he contends render him challengeable\n\nfor cause. As such, this complaint is not preserved for review. See Tex.\n\nR. App. P. 33.1(a).\n\n                                Closure\n\n     Appellant also challenged Sosa for cause because “he’s limited\n\nhimself - - as to when he can consider a life sentence.” (RR46:32). On\n\nQuestion 9 of his questionnaire, in response to the question, “For what\n\ncrimes do you think a sentence of life imprisonment is the proper\n\npunishment[,]” Sosa wrote, “Someone who gives information so as to\n\n\n                                    129\n\fgive closure to love [sic] ones.” (Sosa, Juror 1070, Q p.3).         During\n\nquestioning,     defense   counsel   inquired   regarding   this   response.\n\n(RR46:27-28).     Sosa explained that his answer simply represented an\n\nexample of a case in which he would agree that a life sentence was\n\nproper: if someone committed murder and hid the victims’ bodies, he\n\nshould get a life sentence if he discloses the location of the bodies so\n\nthat the family has “closure.” (RR46:28).        Importantly, Sosa did not\n\ntestify that his example represented the only situation in which a life\n\nsentence would be appropriate.       Quite to the contrary, he testified that\n\nhe could keep an open mind. The following exchange took place:\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: But now that you have heard the way it\n     works here, can you see there might be other circumstances\n     --\n\n     [Sosa]: Oh, yeah.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: - - that might lead someone to vote for a\n     life sentence?\n\n     Is that what you’re telling us here today; that you can keep\n     an open mind to that?\n\n     [Sosa]:     Like I say, you don’t know what people been\n     through.     You can’t just judge one action by being simple\n     about it.    You know, everything comes to a climax. Like I\n     said, I’m   always open-minded. I don’t judge people. I don’t\n                                      130\n\f      have no preconceptions of people. I try not to let that get in\n      my way, because I don’t want to have any preconceived\n      notions about myself. So I try to be fair to everybody, of all\n      walks of life, throughout my life.\n\n      As far as, you know, you show me the evidence, I’ll use my\n      own free mind, my own free will, and I’ll make my own\n      decision.\n\n(RR46:29).     The foregoing proves that Sosa was not limited in his\n\nability to consider a life sentence.\n\n      Appellant has failed to show that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge for cause against Sosa. Issue 21\n\nshould be overruled.\n\n                          Issue 22: James Martin\n\n      Appellant challenged Martin for cause because (1) his responses\n\non his questionnaire; and, (2) he is biased as a result of the fact that his\n\ngrandson was killed.\n\n                               Questionnaire\n\n      Appellant challenged Martin “just based on his questionnaire.”\n\n(RR50:45).   Appellant did not identify the responses in the 22-page\n\nquestionnaire that he contends render him challengeable for cause. As\n\n\n\n\n                                       131\n\fsuch, this complaint is not preserved for review. See Tex. R. App. P.\n\n33.1(a).\n\n                              Martin’s Grandson\n\n      Appellant also challenged Martin “based on the fact that his\n\ngrandson was killed.”       (RR50:45).       Appellant asserted that Martin’s\n\ngrandson’s death would affect his ability to be a fair juror in Appellant’s\n\ncase. (RR50:45).\n\n      On Question 67 of his questionnaire, in response to a question\n\nasking whether he knew anyone who was killed accidentally or\n\notherwise, Martin wrote that “[his] grandson was shot a [sic] killed by a\n\nstray bullit [sic].” (Martin, Juror 1190, Q p.11). Martin testified that\n\nhis grandson’s case occurred in 2005.24 (RR50:43). His grandson’s case\n\nwas prosecuted by the Dallas County District Attorney’s Office, but it\n\nwould not cause him to be unfair in Appellant’s case.                 (RR50:38).\n\nIndeed, Martin denied that there was anything about his grandson’s\n\ncase that would keep him from being able to listen in Appellant’s case.\n\n(RR50:37-38). During the defense voir dire, Martin promised that his\n\n\n\n\n It is not clear whether the offense against Martin’s grandson occurred in 2005 or\n24\n\nwhether the perpetrator’s trial occurred in 2005. (RR50:43).\n                                       132\n\fgrandson’s case would not affect his ability to be a fair juror in\n\nAppellant’s case. (RR50:43).\n\n     The record supports the trial court’s ruling. Martin’s voir dire\n\ndoes not show a bias against Appellant or the law. The record shows\n\nthat he is in favor of the death penalty, but he testified that he would be\n\ncomfortable with assessing a life sentence in the proper circumstances.\n\n(RR50:39, 41).\n\n                            Claims on Appeal\n\n     On appeal, Appellant cites a number of other responses Martin\n\ngave in his questionnaire, which he contends show his bias.\n\n(Appellant’s Brief p.76). Appellant did not cite these responses during\n\nhis challenge for cause. As such, these complaints are not preserved for\n\nreview. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a).\n\n     Appellant has failed to show that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge for cause against Martin. Issue 22\n\nshould be overruled.\n\n                        Issue 23: Jennifer Wilder\n\n     Appellant challenged Wilder for cause because (1) she would\n\nincrease the burden on the defense regarding the intellectual disability\n\n\n                                    133\n\fspecial issue; (2) she would lower the burden on the State regarding the\n\nfuture danger special issue; and, (3) she would impose a burden on the\n\ndefense regarding the mitigation special issue.\n\n                         Intellectual Disability\n\n     Appellant challenged Wilder for cause because she would hold the\n\ndefense “to a burden of beyond a reasonable doubt on Special Issue\n\nNumber One.”      (RR52:85-86).     During the State’s voir dire, the\n\nprosecutor explained that with regard to the intellectual disability\n\nspecial issue, the burden of proof is on the defense to prove it by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence. (RR52:26-33). Wilder affirmed that she\n\ncould abide by the law with regard to this special issue. (RR52:29). She\n\ndenied that she would automatically answer the intellectual disability\n\nspecial issue in the negative simply because the offense at issue is\n\ncapital murder. (RR52:33).\n\n     When questioned by the defense, Wilder gave a response that\n\nsuggested that she would increase the burden of proof:\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: You know, sometimes people have told\n     us also . . . I want to be really sure they’re mentally\n     retarded. I don’t want to be sure, just more likely than not.\n     I want to be the most sure I can be, under the law.\n\n\n\n                                   134\n\f     “I want to be sure beyond a reasonable doubt. I don’t want\n     to have any doubt, for me to just say this person shouldn’t\n     receive the death penalty because they’re mentally\n     retarded.   I want to be convinced more than just a\n     preponderance. I have to be convinced beyond a reasonable\n     doubt.\n\n     “We’re holding the State to beyond-a-reasonable-doubt\n     standard. I want to hold the Defense to that burden also.”\n\n     What do you think?\n\n     [Wilder]: Yes. You’ve got to be fair. I notice you have\n     mentally retarded first, instead of last. It seems like\n     everybody do [sic] a crime, and then they want to say that\n     they are mentally retarded. You can even fool a doctor that\n     you’re mentally retarded. You just got to prove it beyond, as\n     you say, a reasonable doubt. And then you can see some\n     features in a mentally-challenged person also.\n\n(RR52:64-65).   It appears from this exchange that Wilder may have\n\nbeen confused and thought that beyond a reasonable doubt was the\n\nappropriate burden on this special issue.       Later in the exchange,\n\ndefense counsel returned to the subject and explained that the burden\n\non the defense is a preponderance of the evidence.         (RR52:66-67).\n\nWilder affirmed that she would be okay with the defense proving the\n\nintellectual disability special issue by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n(RR52:68).\n\n                                   135\n\f     To the extent that Wilder provided contradictory responses, the\n\nappellate court should defer to the trial judge. When the record reflects\n\nthat a venire member vacillated or equivocated on her ability to follow\n\nthe law, the reviewing court must defer to the trial judge. Gardner, 306\n\nS.W.3d at 295.\n\n                             Future Danger\n\n     Appellant challenged Wilder because she would only require the\n\nState to prove “just a mere chance or a possibility” that Appellant would\n\nbe a future danger.     (RR52:86).         During voir dire, the prosecutor\n\nexplained that the burden on the future danger special issue is on the\n\nState. (RR52:40-41). The State must prove that there is a probability –\n\nmore than a possibility, but less than a certainty – that Appellant\n\nwould be a future danger. (RR52:44-46). Wilder agreed that she would\n\nbe open to either possible answer and testified that “[a]nybody can be\n\nrehabilitated.” (RR52:46).\n\n     When questioned by the defense, Wilder again agreed that the\n\nState would have to prove a probability. (RR52:74). Then, however, as\n\nthe exchange continued, she gave a response that was equivocal.        The\n\nfollowing exchange took place:\n\n\n                                     136\n\f     [Defense Counsel]: So if the law says that you have to hold\n     the State to prove more than a mere chance and they have\n     to prove to you a probability, which is more, would you\n     agree?\n\n     [Wilder]: Yes.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: Could you follow that?\n\n     Or would a mere chance be enough for you?\n\n     Because, if that’s the way you feel, you can tell us. You can\n     say, “I can follow the law and say a probability is what I\n     would hold them to.” You tell me.\n\n     What would make you more comfortable?\n\n     [Wilder]: A mere chance. I think both sides would be a\n     chance. Proving it beyond a reasonable doubt and thinking\n     that this person is going to rehabilitate, even if they ever\n     get out of prison. I could go either way. You’ve got to prove\n     it. But then, nothing is 100 percent proven.\n\n(RR52:74).\n\n     To the extent that any of Wilder’s responses may be interpreted as\n\ncontradictory, this Court should defer to the trial court’s resolution of\n\nher responses.   See Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 744. The reviewing court\n\nmust give great deference to the trial court’s decision on a challenge for\n\ncause based on the trial judge’s opportunity to observe the venire\n\n                                   137\n\fmember during voir dire. Id. When the record reflects that a prospective\n\njuror vacillated or equivocated on her ability to follow the law, the\n\nreviewing court must defer to the trial judge. Gardner, 306 S.W.3d at\n\n295.\n\n                                  Mitigation\n\n       Appellant challenged Wilder because she would place a burden on\n\nthe defense regarding the mitigation special issue. (RR52:86).           At no\n\npoint, however, did Wilder ever say that she would place a burden on\n\nthe defense on this issue. Importantly, neither side instructed Wilder\n\nthat there is no burden as it relates to this issue.          See generally\n\nThreadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667.\n\n       Defense counsel asked Wilder about the fact that some people\n\nwould only answer the mitigation special issue in the affirmative if “the\n\nDefense proves it to [them].” (RR52:75). Wilder responded as follows:\n\n       You got the Defense over here, then you have the person\n       that’s defending the Defendant. You would want your\n       government to really bring everything that they would have\n       in order to prove the Defendant - - if they should receive life\n       or death. It’s just looking at the evidence.\n\n(RR52:76).    Wilder’s response suggests that she would consider the\n\nevidence presented, not that she would impose the burden of proof on\n\n                                     138\n\fthe defense. (RR52:76).       Even if her response can be interpreted as\n\nimposing a burden on the defense, which the State does not concede,\n\nthis Court has stated that a veniremember is not challengeable for\n\ncause simply because he would place the burden of proof on the defense\n\nregarding mitigation.       Saldano, 232 S.W.3d at 92 (citing Ladd, 3\n\nS.W.3d at 559).\n\n                             Claims on Appeal\n\n     On appeal, Appellant cites a number of other responses Wilder\n\ngave in her questionnaire, which he contends show her bias.\n\n(Appellant’s Brief p.78).    Appellant did not mention these responses\n\nduring his challenge for cause.      As such, these complaints are not\n\npreserved for review. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a).\n\n     Appellant has failed to show that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge for cause against Wilder. Issue 23\n\nshould be overruled.\n\n                                  Conclusion\n\n     Appellant has not shown even one erroneous ruling on his\n\nchallenges for cause, much less three erroneous rulings. See Gonzales,\n\n353 S.W.3d at 837. Therefore, he has not shown this Court that he was\n\n\n                                    139\n\fdenied the use of a statutorily provided peremptory strike. Issues 9\n\nthrough 23 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE NOS. 24-30: THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR\nIN GRANTING THE STATE’S CHALLENGES FOR CAUSE.\n\n\n        In Issues 24 through 30, Appellant contends that the trial court\n\nerred     in    granting   the    State’s    challenges   for   cause   against\n\nveniremembers Sheryly Kingery, Kimberly Morris, Consuelo Davila,\n\nGloria Hawkins, Jenna Kinzie, Raul Flores, and Kellye Hogan.                He\n\ncontends the exclusion of these jurors violated article 35.16 of the Texas\n\nCode of Criminal Procedure. Appellant’s contentions lack merit and\n\nshould be overruled.\n\n                                 Applicable Law\n\n        Article 35.16(b) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides\n\nas follows:\n\n        A challenge for cause may be made by the State for any of\n        the following reasons:\n\n               1. That the juror has conscientious scruples in regard\n                  to the infliction of the punishment of death for\n                  crime, in a capital case, where the State is seeking\n                  the death penalty.\n\n               2. That he is related within the third degree of\n                  consanguinity or affinity as determined under\n\n                                       140\n\f              Chapter 573, Government Code, to the defendant;\n              and\n\n           3. That he has a bias or prejudice against any phase of\n              the law upon which the State is entitled to rely for\n              conviction or punishment.\n\nTex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.16(b) (West 2006). A “bias against\n\nthe law” is the refusal to consider or apply the relevant law. Sadler v.\n\nState, 977 S.W.2d 140, 142 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998). The test is whether\n\nthe bias or prejudice would substantially impair the prospective juror’s\n\nability to carry out his oath and instructions in accordance with the law.\n\nThreadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667.\n\n      On appeal, a reviewing court will overturn the trial court's ruling\n\non a challenge for cause only if it clearly abused its discretion. Gonzales,\n\n353 S.W.3d at 831. The reviewing court gives great deference to the\n\ntrial court’s decision on a challenge for cause because the trial judge\n\nwas in the best position to observe the venire member during voir dire.\n\nId.   When the record reflects that a venire member vacillated or\n\nequivocated on her ability to follow the law, the reviewing court must\n\ndefer to the trial judge. Id.\n\n                         Issue 24: Sheryl Kingery\n\n      On her questionnaire, in response to Question 2, Kingery ranked\n                                    141\n\fherself a “5,” indicating a belief that she “could never, under any\n\ncircumstances, return a verdict which assessed the death penalty.”\n\n(RR13:22; Kingery, Juror 32, Q p.1). Kingery wrote that she could not\n\nbe a part of taking someone’s life.       (Kingery, Juror 32, Q p.1). She\n\nmade statements in multiple other places, which made her beliefs\n\nregarding the death penalty clear: she has moral, religious, or personal\n\nbeliefs that would prevent her from returning a verdict which would\n\nresult in the execution of another human being (Kingery, Juror 32, p.3);\n\n“(death sentence) provides no purpose” (Kingery, Juror 32, p.3); “I do\n\nnot believe in the death penalty” (Kingery, Juror 32, p.4); “I simply do\n\nnot believe in the death penalty” (Kingery, Juror 32, p.4); “[the death\n\npenalty] just never made any sense to me.         It seems contradictory.\n\nMurder is a crime but putting someone to death is not” (Kingery, Juror\n\n32, p.5); “I want to be sure to make it clear my stance against the death\n\npenalty and it would be an influence on my thoughts” (Kingery, Juror\n\n32, p.20).\n\n      During voir dire by the State, when asked if she was saying, “I\n\ncan’t be part of [this process], because of my beliefs[,]” Kingery testified\n\nthat the prosecutor was correct. (RR13:23).       Kingery testified that if\n\n\n                                    142\n\fshe were a juror, she “would have to answer [the special issues]\n\ntruthfully[,]” but later, she conceded the possibility that she would be\n\nlooking for a way to answer the questions in such a way that the death\n\npenalty would not result. (RR13:25). Serving as a juror in this case\n\nwould do harm to her conscience. (RR13:25-26).      Kingery repeatedly\n\naffirmed that she does not believe in the death penalty and believes\n\nthat it should be abolished. (RR13:28-29).\n\n     When questioned by the defense, Kingery testified that if she were\n\nselected as a juror, she would show up. (RR13:44). She intimated,\n\nhowever, that her participation would be less than honest.          The\n\nfollowing exchange took place:\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: If you’re selected as a juror, would you\n     just refuse to participate at all in the process?\n\n     [Kingery]: No, I would not refuse to participate. But I know\n     how I would participate.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: Okay. That’s what we’re going to talk\n     about.\n\n     Would you do it honestly?\n\n     I mean, you’ve indicated, when they were asking you\n     questions, that you would participate honestly in the\n     process.\n\n                                  143\n\f      [Kingery]: As honestly as I can. I know I have this strong\n      belief.\n\n(RR13:44).    Later, counsel asked Kingery whether she could honestly\n\nanswer “no” to the mitigation special issue if she did not find any\n\nmitigating evidence.    (RR13:55). Kingery testified that “it would kill\n\n[her].”   (RR13:55).    As the exchange continued, however, she gave\n\nanswers that suggested that her participation would be less than\n\ncompletely honest:\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: But would you be honest and do it?\n\n      [Kingery]: I would have to. Because, one way or the other,\n      my conscience is going to - -\n\n      [Defense Counsel]:     So you would have to answer it\n      honestly.\n\n      [Kingery]: Yes.\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: Even if your answer’s “no” you would be\n      honest and answer “no” that there’s no mitigation, right?\n\n      Even if it would be hard - - extremely hard - - for you, you\n      could do it?\n\n      [Kingery]: Put in that situation, can I absolutely, honestly\n      answer that today?\n\n\n                                   144\n\f     [Defense Counsel]: No. We don’t know what you’re going to\n     hear.\n\n     [Kingery]: I would hope I would do it. But I still can’t say,\n     when it came down to that wire. I can only hope that I will\n     do it.\n\n(RR13:55-56). Kingery then contradicted herself and testified that she\n\n“[could] answer the questions honestly.” (RR13:57).\n\n     A veniremember may not be excused for her general opposition to\n\nthe death penalty. Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510, 522-23 (1968);\n\nRachal v. State, 917 S.W.2d 799, 810 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996).           A\n\nveniremember is challengeable for cause, however, if his beliefs\n\nagainst capital punishment would prevent or substantially impair the\n\nperformance of his duties as a juror in accordance with the court's\n\ninstructions and the juror's oath. See Colburn, 966 S.W.2d at 517.     A\n\njuror must be able to set aside her personal preferences and biases to\n\nconsider as death eligible all those defined as death eligible by section\n\n19.03 of the penal code and article 37.071 of the criminal procedure\n\ncode. Rachal, 917 S.W.2d at 812.\n\n     The totality of Kingery’s voir dire testimony shows that her beliefs\n\nabout capital punishment would prevent or substantially impair the\n\n\n                                   145\n\fperformance of her duties as a juror as required by law. She had a bias\n\nagainst the law governing a defendant’s eligibility for the death penalty.\n\nAs a result of her bias, Kingery could not ensure the parties that she\n\nwould follow the law and answer the special issues honestly. See Clark\n\nv. State, 929 S.W.2d 5, 8-9 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996) (a prospective juror\n\nwho maintains she will consciously distort her answers must be excused\n\non challenge for cause). At a minimum, Kingery vacillated. Where the\n\nvenire member either vacillates or equivocates on her ability to follow\n\nthe law, the Court should defer to the trial court’s judgment on the\n\nchallenge for cause. Granados v. State, 85 S.W.3d 217, 231 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2002).\n\n     The record supports the trial court’s decision to grant the State’s\n\nchallenge. To conclude otherwise would controvert this Court’s policy of\n\nencouraging trial court’s to liberally grant challenges for cause rather\n\nthan err by denying a challenge on a close question. Jones v. State, 982\n\nS.W.2d 386, 394 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998).\n\n     Issue 24 should be overruled.\n\n                       Issue 25: Kimberly Morris\n\n     At the beginning of the State’s voir dire, Morris testified that\n\n\n                                     146\n\falthough she believes in the death penalty, she was concerned about\n\nbeing the person “to say that that should happen to someone[.]”\n\n(RR13:213).   Indeed, she testified that she could not take the oath\n\nbecause of her beliefs about the death penalty. (RR13:218-19). The\n\nfollowing exchange took place:\n\n     [Prosecutor]: Your moral beliefs, they’re yours . . . What I’m\n     hearing you say, when you tell me it might be hard to\n     return a verdict that would result in the execution of\n     somebody else, tells me that you might have some moral\n     dilemma with actually being on a jury that actually imposed\n     a verdict that resulted in the execution of somebody else.\n\n     [Morris]: Yes.\n\n     [Prosecutor]: Is that how you feel?\n\n     [Morris]: That’s how I feel.\n\n     [Prosecutor]: Okay. What I’m saying is that you would\n     have to take an oath to follow the law, even if the law\n     conflicted with your own moral standard.\n\n     Some jurors have told me, “I can’t take that oath, because I\n     don’t want to be in a position of making a determination\n     that, while in line with the law, is not in line with my own\n     morals.”\n\n     Does that make sense?\n\n\n\n                                    147\n\f     [Morris]: Yes.\n\n     [Prosecutor]: Some people have a moral opposition to\n     imposing the death penalty, by their verdict. Okay? And\n     what I’m hearing you tell me is that you could not take that\n     oath.\n\n     Is that right?\n\n     [Morris]: Correct.\n\n     [Prosecutor]: You couldn’t assure me that you would take\n     the oath and follow it all the way through because of your\n     moral dilemmas with the death penalty, correct?\n\n     [Morris]: Correct.\n\n(RR13:217-19).    Later, the prosecutor returned to the subject and\n\nMorris maintained her position, stating, “No. I couldn’t assure you that\n\n[she would take the oath to follow the law].” (RR13:239).\n\n     During voir dire by the defense, however, Morris contradicted\n\nherself.   She testified that she would answer all of the special issues\n\nhonestly. (RR13:249-50, 254-55, 259). She testified that she would take\n\nthe oath if she had to. (RR13:260).         In an effort to clarify Morris’\n\nposition, the trial judge inquired of her as follows:\n\n     [Trial Court]: . . . Now, one side, you’re saying, no, you\n     can’t. The other side, you’re saying, yes, you can.\n\n                                     148\n\f     I need to know “yes” or “no” can you take the oath?\n\n     [Morris]: No.\n\n(RR13:264).\n\n     Given Morris’ repeated statements that she could not take the\n\noath, the trial court properly granted the State’s challenge for cause. A\n\nveniremember is challengeable for cause if she states that her\n\nconvictions are so strong that she cannot take an oath, knowing that a\n\ndeath sentence is a possible result at trial. See Goodwin v. State, 799\n\nS.W.2d 719, 731-32 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990). The record supports the\n\ntrial court’s decision to grant the State’s challenge.   See King v. State,\n\n29 S.W.3d 556, 568 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000).         To conclude otherwise\n\nwould controvert this Court’s policy as stated earlier.        Jones, 982\n\nS.W.2d at 394.\n\n     Issue 25 should be overruled.\n\n                       Issue 26: Consuelo Davila\n\n     On Question 2 of her questionnaire, Davila ranked herself a “5,”\n\nindicating a belief that she “could never, under any circumstances,\n\nreturn a verdict which assessed the death penalty.” (Davila, Juror 103,\n\n\n                                     149\n\fQ p.1). She wrote in 3 places that she did not think that she could “send\n\nsomeone to [the] death penalty.” (Davila, Juror 103, Q pp.3, 4, 20).\n\n     She also answered “yes” to Questions 3 and 4, which ask whether\n\nthe juror has any moral, religious or personal beliefs that would prevent\n\nthem from sitting in judgment of another human being or would\n\nprevent them from returning a verdict that would result in the\n\nexecution of another human being. (Davila, Juror 103, Q p.3).\n\n     During questioning by the State, Davila affirmed the answers on\n\nher questionnaire.    (RR14:133-36).      She agreed that her beliefs\n\nregarding the death penalty would affect her ability to answer the\n\nspecial issues. (RR14:154). The following exchange took place:\n\n     [Prosecutor]: Okay. So your views then on the death\n     penalty will impact how you consider whether somebody is\n     mentally retarded or not; is that right?\n\n     [Davila]: Yes.\n\n     [Prosecutor]: Okay. In other words, you would change or\n     consider Special Issue Number One really not in the context\n     of whether the person suffers from mental retardation, but\n     whether you want him to get the death penalty or not; is\n     that right?\n\n     [Davila]: Yes.\n\n\n                                   150\n\f(RR14:154).   The prosecutor asked Davila whether her feelings would\n\naffect her answer to the deliberateness special issue, “knowing that if\n\nyou answer it ‘yes’ you’re moving closer toward that verdict of death?”\n\n(RR14:159). Davila responded, “I think it would. But I still can’t send\n\nno one to death penalty.”      (RR14:159).   Her views would affect her\n\nanswers to the future danger and the mitigation special issues as well.\n\n(RR14:159-60, 167). Because of her moral beliefs, she is unable to be a\n\npart of the process involved in this case. (RR14:169). When Davila was\n\nquestioned by the defense, she appeared to contradict herself because\n\nshe agreed that she could answer the special issues. (RR14:178-87). At\n\nthe end of questioning, however, she testified that she could not take\n\nthe oath to serve as a juror. (RR14:187-88). The following exchange\n\ntook place:\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: . . . So now that you know how it works,\n     do you think you could take the oath to serve as a juror and\n     be part of the process, as long as all you’re asked to do is\n     answer the questions honestly and base your answers on\n     the evidence?\n\n     Do you think you could do that?\n\n     [Davila]: Honestly, no.\n\n(RR14:187-88).\n                                    151\n\f     Given Davila’s testimony that her beliefs would affect her answers\n\nto the special issues and that she could not take the oath, the trial court\n\nproperly granted the State’s challenge for cause.      See Goodwin, 799\n\nS.W.2d at 731-32. The record supports the trial court’s decision to grant\n\nthe State’s challenge. See King, 29 S.W.3d at 568.           To conclude\n\notherwise would controvert this Court’s policy as stated earlier. Jones,\n\n982 S.W.2d at 394.\n\n     Issue 26 should be overruled.\n\n                        Issue 27: Gloria Hawkins\n\n     In response to Question 1 on her questionnaire, Hawkins wrote\n\nthat she is not in favor of the death penalty.   (Hawkins, Juror 176, Q\n\np.1). During questioning by the State, Hawkins affirmed the statements\n\nin her questionnaire that she does not believe in the death penalty.\n\n(RR15:216). She testified, “No, I wouldn’t be part of a process where\n\nsomeone is executed. I will not be.” (RR15:215). Importantly, Hawkins\n\nrefused to provide any assurance that if she were selected as a juror\n\nthat she would take the oath and follow the law. (RR15:219-21). The\n\nfollowing exchange occurred:\n\n     [Hawkins]: I said, I’m against the death penalty.          Yes,\n     that’s what I wrote. That’s what I mean.\n\n                                     152\n\f[Prosecutor]: Can you take the oath to follow the law and\nrender a true verdict?\n\n[Hawkins]: What do you think?\n\n[Prosecutor]: I think you can. What do you think?\n\n[Hawkins]: I’m not gone [sic] give the death penalty.\n\n[Prosecutor]: Because of how you feel, you’re not going to\ngive the death penalty?\n\n[Hawkins]: And may not even want to give a life penalty.\nBut go ahead.\n\n...\n\n[Prosecutor]: And even if you [heard the evidence], you\ncouldn’t impose the death penalty in any case.\n\nIs that what you’re telling me?\n\n[Hawkins]: If I heard witnesses. No, I will not impose the\ndeath penalty. That is too final. And people change.\n\n...\n\n[Prosecutor]: Are you able to give me your assurance right\nnow that you can take the oath to follow the law and render\na true verdict, based on the law and the evidence?\n\n[Hawkins]: That I could follow the law?\n\n                             153\n\f     [Prosecutor]: And render - -\n\n     [Hawkins]: I’m not a part of that. I don’t have to follow\n     that. No, I don’t have to follow that. I’m not a part of your\n     law.\n\n(RR15:219-21).      In contrast, when she was questioned by the defense,\n\nHawkins testified that she could answer the special issues honestly.\n\n(RR15:227-28). She testified that she could follow the law. (RR15:230-\n\n31, 234-35, 239).\n\n     The totality of Hawkins’ voir dire testimony shows that her beliefs\n\nabout capital punishment would prevent or substantially impair the\n\nperformance of her duties as a juror as required by law. To the extent,\n\nif any, that some of her other remarks could be interpreted as\n\ncontradictory, the trial court was the fact finder during voir dire and,\n\nthus, free to resolve her conflicting answers in the State’s favor. See\n\nKing, 29 S.W.3d at 568 (particular deference is given to the trial court’s\n\nconclusion that venire member cannot follow law when venire member’s\n\nanswers are vacillating, unclear, or contradictory).        To conclude\n\notherwise would controvert this Court’s policy as stated earlier. Jones,\n\n982 S.W.2d at 394.\n\n\n                                    154\n\f                                 Judgment\n\n      On Question 4 of her questionnaire, Hawkins answered “yes” to a\n\nquestion asking whether she has “any moral, religious or personal\n\nbeliefs that would prevent [her] from returning a verdict which would\n\nresult in the execution of another human being.” (Hawkins, Juror 176,\n\nQ p.2). During voir dire, she testified, “I don’t believe I have a right to,\n\nyou know, judge anybody, to say that they should die for what they did.”\n\n(RR15:184). The totality of Hawkins’ voir dire shows she could not sit\n\nin judgment of another individual and her statements support the trial\n\ncourt’s decision.\n\n                                      Guilt\n\n      When Hawkins was told that the Judge would instruct her that\n\nAppellant has already been found guilty, Hawkins testified, “Well, I\n\ndidn’t see the trial. It’s hearsay to me.” (RR15:190).      The prosecutor\n\nexplained     that   another   jury    already   found   Appellant   guilty.\n\n(RR15:190).     Hawkins testified that she would “have to see it for\n\n[her]self[.]” (RR15:190). As above, Hawkins’ testimony shows that she\n\nwas unable (or unwilling) to follow the law. The record supports the\n\ntrial court’s decision.\n\n\n                                       155\n\f                           Fifth Amendment\n\n     On Question 36A of her questionnaire, Hawkins wrote that she\n\nagreed with the statement, “Even though the law says a Defendant has\n\nthe right to remain silent, a person accused of capital murder should\n\ntestify.” (Hawkins, Juror 176, Q p.7). During voir dire, the prosecutor\n\nexplained that jurors are not allowed to consider the fact that a\n\ndefendant does or does not testify in his own defense as evidence of\n\nguilt. (RR15:195).    Hawkins testified that she “[doesn’t] follow that\n\nlaw.” (RR15:195). In contrast, she later contradicted herself when she\n\ntestified that she would follow an instruction not to consider whether\n\nthe defendant elects to testify as evidence of guilt. (RR15:196). To the\n\nextent that Hawkins was a vacillating juror, the record supports the\n\ntrial court’s decision. See King, 29 S.W.3d at 568.\n\n                             Future Danger\n\n     Hawkins testified that she could not find a person to be a future\n\ndanger unless she talks to that person or if that person testifies and she\n\nhears what that person has to say. (RR15:209). She could not answer\n\nthe future danger special issue unless the defendant testifies.\n\n(RR15:210). Even so, “[y]ou can’t tell a person’s heart. You don’t know\n\n\n                                   156\n\fwhat he’s going to do or what he’s not going to do in the future. You\n\ncan’t do it. You can only predict.” (RR15:211).    As a result, she could\n\nnever answer the future danger special issue.      (RR15:211, 212). She\n\ntestified:\n\n      I can’t do that. Because I can’t look at a person’s heart and\n      tell what they’re going to do. I can’t do that. And you can’t\n      either.\n\n(RR15:211-12).   In contrast, she later contradicted herself when she\n\ntestified that she could answer the the future danger special issue “yes.”\n\n(RR15:235-36). To the extent that Hawkins was a vacillating juror, the\n\nrecord supports the trial court’s decision. See King, 29 S.W.3d at 568.\n\n      The record supports the trial court’s decision to grant the State’s\n\nchallenge. To conclude otherwise would controvert this Court’s policy\n\nas stated earlier. Jones, 982 S.W.2d at 394.\n\n      Issue 27 should be overruled.\n\n                         Issue 28: Jenna Kinzie\n\n      On Question 1 of her questionnaire, Kinzie wrote that she is “not\n\nsure what [she] think[s] about the death penalty but [she does] not\n\nthink it should be [her] decision whether someone lives or dies.”\n\n(Kinzie, Juror 243, Q p.2). She ranked herself a “3” on Question 2,\n\n                                      157\n\findicating a belief that, “Although I do not believe that the death\n\npenalty should ever be imposed, as long as the law provides for it, I\n\ncould assess it under the proper set of circumstances.” (Kinzie, Juror\n\n243, Q p.2).   During the State’s voir dire, she described herself as\n\n“teeter-tottery” about the subject. (RR17:114). When the prosecutor\n\nasked if taking the oath would violate her conscience, Kinzie said it\n\nwould. (RR17:125).     Kinzie testified that she thought that she could\n\ntake the oath; however, her views on the death penalty would affect her\n\nanswers to the special issues. (RR17:128-29). During questioning by\n\nthe defense, however, Kinzie agreed that she could take the oath and\n\nrender a verdict based on the law and evidence. (RR17:139, 142, 158).\n\n     After she was questioned by both sides, the trial court brought\n\nKinzie back into the courtroom and asked whether she could “take the\n\noath or not[.]” Kinzie testified that she could not. (RR17:170-71). To\n\nthe extent that Kinzie was a vacillating juror, the record supports the\n\ntrial court’s decision. See King, 29 S.W.3d at 568.\n\n                           Fifth Amendment\n\n     On Question 36A of her questionnaire, Kinzie wrote that she\n\nagreed with the statement, “Even though the law says a Defendant has\n\n\n                                   158\n\fthe right to remain silent, a person accused of capital murder should\n\ntestify.” (Kinzie, Juror 243, Q p.7). During the State’s voir dire, she\n\ntestified that she would prefer that a capital murder defendant testify.\n\n(RR17:133). She was unsure whether she would require the defendant’s\n\ntestimony. (RR17:133).      She would consider it, however, in deciding\n\nthe special issues.    (RR17:135).     When questioned by the defense,\n\nKinzie agreed that she would not consider the defendant’s failure to\n\ntestify. (RR17:157). To the extent that Kinzie was a vacillating juror,\n\nthe record supports the trial court’s decision. See King, 29 S.W.3d at\n\n568.\n\n                              Police Officers\n\n       One of Kinzie’s brothers is a police officer. (RR17:129, 154). As a\n\nresult, even though the law says that police officers are to be judged as\n\nany other witness, Kinzie would find them to be more credible.\n\n(RR17:130-31).    She later contradicted herself and agreed that she\n\nwould wait and listen to their testimony before judging their credibility.\n\n(RR17:155-56).\n\n       The totality of Kinzie’s voir dire testimony clearly shows her\n\nbeliefs about capital punishment and sitting in judgment of another\n\n\n                                     159\n\fperson would prevent or substantially impair her ability to carry out\n\nher obligations as a juror.     And, she vacillated on multiple issues.\n\nIndeed, Kinzie was the classic vacillating juror; she gave different\n\nanswers depending on who was questioning her.            Where the venire\n\nmember either vacillates or equivocates on his ability to follow the law,\n\nthe Court should defer to the trial court’s judgment on the challenge for\n\ncause.    Granados, 85 S.W.3d at 231.         The record supports the trial\n\ncourt’s decision to grant the State’s challenge. To conclude otherwise\n\nwould controvert this Court’s policy as stated earlier.         Jones, 982\n\nS.W.2d at 394.\n\n        Issue 28 should be overruled.\n\n                           Issue 29: Raul Flores\n\n        On his questionnaire, Flores wrote that he is not in favor of the\n\ndeath penalty and described it as “barbaric.” (Flores, Juror 244, Q p.2,\n\np.5).    On Question 4, he answered “yes” to a question asking whether\n\nhe has “any moral, religious or personal beliefs that would prevent\n\n[him] from returning a verdict which would result in the execution of\n\nanother human being.” (Flores, Juror 244, Q p.3). He wrote that he\n\nwas “very unsure that [he] could send a person to their death.” (Flores,\n\n\n                                        160\n\fJuror 244, Q p.3).       On Question 19, Flores answered “no,” that the\n\ndeath penalty is not applied fairly in Texas. (Flores, Juror 244, Q p.4).\n\nOn Question 22, Flores wrote that the death penalty is used too often\n\nand that “it’s used as a political tool to gain votes from people thirsty for\n\npunishment, rather than what benefits society.” (Flores, Juror 244, Q\n\np.4).    He answered “agree” to Question 36C, which asked whether the\n\ndeath penalty should be abolished. (Flores, Juror 244, Q p.7).\n\n        During questioning by the State, Flores’ testimony revealed\n\nconsiderable distrust in the prosecution. The following exchange took\n\nplace:\n\n        [Flores]: Everybody has their agenda. Everybody wants\n        something. It just seems that with the prosecutor, lately,\n        I’ve been hearing about wins and losses. And that’s all that\n        matters. This morning, I heard about a receipt was [sic]\n        withheld, evidence was withheld, and the guy went to\n        prison for 25 years.\n\n        [Prosecutor]: Yep.\n\n        [Flores]: That happened, because a prosecutor wanted to\n        win. I’m suppose to believe what you tell me - -\n\n        [Prosecutor]: Actually, you don’t have to.\n\n        [Flores]: Well, I’m not too succinct [sic] right now.\n\n\n                                      161\n\f     ...\n\n     [Flores]: So you just told me that, okay, we’re here because\n     this happened and this happened and this happened. And\n     I’m supposed to believe you?\n\n     [Prosecutor]: In one sense, yes. In another sense, you don’t\n     have to necessarily agree with it.\n\n     Does that make sense to you?\n\n     [Flores]: You’re telling me these things, and we’re going to\n     proceed onward, as if I believe you. And that’s - -\n\n     [Prosecutor]: That’s a problem for you?\n\n     [Flores]: (Venireperson nods.)\n\n     [Prosecutor]: That’s all right. I can tell.\n\n(RR18:21-23).    The prosecutor asked Flores whether his personal\n\nexperiences and “things that [he has] read about” meant that the State\n\nwas “already behind in this case.” (RR18:39). Flores responded that\n\n“That’s accurate.” (RR18:39).\n\n     Flores openly admitted that he is biased.     He testified, “I’m very\n\nbiased.” (RR18:33).    He testified that his “biases will factor into how\n\n[he] act[s].” (RR18:34).   At one point, Flores testified that he thought\n\nthat he could look at evidence objectively. (RR18:40).      But then he\n\n                                    162\n\freturned to his initial stance. The following exchange took place:\n\n     [Prosecutor]: . . . In other words, you could not be a part of\n     this process that would result in the execution because of\n     how you feel; is that right? “Yes” or “no”?\n\n     [Flores]: No, I couldn’t.\n\n     [Prosecutor]: Okay. All right.\n\n     [Flores]: I’d be fine disregarding the instructions, you know.\n\n     [Prosecutor]:     You   would    be   fine   disregarding   the\n     instructions?\n\n     [Flores]: If the alternative is sending someone to die.\n\n(RR18:40-41).\n\n     Later, when he was questioned by the defense, Flores equivocated\n\nregarding his ability to serve as a juror and answer the special issues\n\nbased on the law and evidence. (RR18:66-67).         Counsel tried to pin\n\nFlores down, but Flores testified that the best answer he was able to\n\ngive was “I don’t know.”\n\n     The totality of Flores’ voir dire testimony clearly shows that his\n\nbeliefs about capital punishment and his clear bias against the State\n\nwould prevent or substantially impair his ability to carry out his oath\n\nand follow instructions in accordance with the law.       Threadgill, 146\n                                   163\n\fS.W.3d at 667. Flores was equivocal about his ability to take the oath.\n\nEven if he did take the oath, however, by his testimony, he would “be\n\nfine disregarding [the court’s] instructions[.]”     (RR18:41). The record\n\nsupports the trial court’s decision.\n\n     Issue 29 should be overruled.\n\n                            Issue 30: Kellye Hogan\n\n     In her questionnaire, Hogan wrote that she is in favor of the death\n\npenalty in the appropriate case, but she is “hesitant to make a decision\n\nfor someone else’s fate.”     (Hogan, Juror 1110, Q p.2, 20). During voir\n\ndire, after hearing the prosecutor summarize the process involved,\n\nHogan testified that she did not feel like she could be a part of the\n\nprocess. (RR47:69). She testified, “I don’t feel like I can handle making\n\nthat type of decision, based on an individual.”        (RR47:69).   Hogan\n\nacknowledged that her testimony differed from the answers in her\n\nquestionnaire; she said that she has “had time to think about it[.]”\n\n(RR47:70).    Initially, Hogan agreed that the death penalty “would be\n\nplaying on [her] mind” as she answered the special issues. (RR47:74).\n\nBut then she testified that if she were a juror that she “would obviously\n\ntell the truth” and that her views on the death penalty would not affect\n\n\n                                       164\n\fher answers to the special issues. (RR47:75-76).      Where the venire\n\nmember either vacillates or equivocates on her ability to follow the law,\n\nthe Court should defer to the trial court’s judgment on the challenge for\n\ncause.   Granados, 85 S.W.3d at 231.     The record supports the trial\n\ncourt’s decision to grant the State’s challenge. To conclude otherwise\n\nwould controvert this Court’s policy as stated earlier.      Jones, 982\n\nS.W.2d at 394.\n\n                            Burden of Proof\n\n     Hogan also testified that she would hold the State to a higher\n\nburden of proof than beyond a reasonable doubt.        (RR47:99).    The\n\nprosecutor explained that although the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt\n\nstandard is the highest burden in the criminal justice system, it “does\n\nnot mean with 100 percent certainty or beyond all possible doubt.”\n\n(RR47:99). When asked if she would hold the State to its burden of\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt or whether she would hold it to a higher\n\nburden, Hogan testified that “it would have to be a higher burden than\n\nreasonable doubt - - beyond a reasonable doubt.”       (RR47:99).    The\n\nprosecutor explained that the law only requires the State to prove\n\nsomething beyond a reasonable doubt but Hogan maintained that she\n\n\n                                   165\n\fwould hold the State to a higher burden. (RR47:100-01). The following\n\nexchange took place:\n\n     [Prosecutor]: The law is, you would be instructed that I’m\n     only suppose to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, if I can\n     prove it at all. Even if you were convinced beyond a\n     reasonable doubt about something, about Special Issue\n     Number Two, Special Issue Number Three, you would still\n     hold me to that higher burden, because of your thoughts on\n     capital murder; is that correct?\n\n     [Hogan]: That’s correct.\n\n     [Prosecutor]:     You would hold me to beyond all possible\n     doubt?\n\n     [Hogan]: Yes.\n\n(RR47:101). When she was questioned by the defense, Hogan appeared\n\nto change her answer. (RR47:112-14). She agreed that she would not\n\nhold the State to an impossible burden, but would hold the State to its\n\nburden of beyond a reasonable doubt. (RR47:114).      In an attempt to\n\nclear up the confusion, the trial court inquired of Hogan regarding the\n\nburden of proof:\n\n     [Trial Court]: . . . All right. I’m confused now, Ms. Hogan.\n     And I want you to tell me. Because, when Mr. Birmingham\n     was talking to you . . . you told him that you would hold him\n     to a higher burden of proof. Mr. Sanchez has been over this\n\n                                   166\n\f     with you.\n\n     You understand, the law is beyond a reasonable doubt?\n     That’s the burden of proof that the State has to prove.\n     Beyond a reasonable doubt can mean anything to you. We\n     don’t have a legal definition of it. It means whatever it\n     means to you, each juror. But that is the burden of proof.\n     It’s not beyond all doubt. It’s not beyond a shadow of a\n     doubt. It’s not beyond - - it’s not 100 percent. It’s not to a\n     certainty. It’s beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n     Now, would you hold the State to that burden?\n\n     Or would you hold them to a higher burden?\n\n     Just be real truthful and honest with us.\n\n     [Hogan]: Okay. Well, that’s what I thought I answered,\n     was it would be a higher - - it would be a higher burden.\n\n     [Trial Court]: A higher burden than beyond a reasonable\n     doubt?\n\n     [Hogan]: Yes.\n\n(RR47:115).   A review of Hogan’s testimony shows that she has a bias\n\nagainst the law regarding the State’s burden of proof.   Her bias would\n\nprevent or substantially impair her ability to carry out her oath and\n\ninstructions in accordance with the law. Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667.\n\nAt a minimum, Hogan was a vacillating juror. See generally Ladd, 3\n\n                                   167\n\fS.W.3d at 559. The record supports the trial court’s decision.\n\n     Issue 30 should be overruled.\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n     The trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the State’s\n\nchallenges for cause regarding Kingery, Morris, Davila, Hawkins,\n\nKinzie, Flores, and Hogan. Even assuming their excusal was erroneous,\n\nit was harmless. The erroneous excusal of a venireperson warrants\n\nreversal only if the record shows that the error deprived the defendant\n\nof a lawfully constituted jury. Jones, 982 S.W.2d at 394. Appellant\n\nmakes no such showing.       Moreover, no evidence indicates that the\n\njurors who served on Appellant’s jury were in any way biased,\n\ninterested, or otherwise disqualified from serving. As a result, reversal\n\nis unwarranted.\n\n     Issues 24 through 30 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S   RESPONSE TO ISSUE    31:   THE SUPREME COURT’S DECISION IN\nHALL V.   FLORIDA DID NOT INVALIDATE THIS      COURT’S   DECISION IN EX\nPARTE BRISENO.\n\n\n     Appellant contends that the recent Supreme Court decision in\n\nHall v. Florida, 134 S. Ct. 1986 (2014) invalidates and renders\n\nunconstitutional this Court’s decision in Ex parte Briseno, 135 S.W.3d 1\n\n                                     168\n\f(Tex. Crim. App. 2004). Appellant’s contention lack merit.\n\n                             Pertinent Facts\n\n     On June 3, 2014, Appellant filed a motion to quash the jury panel\n\nbased on the United States Supreme Court opinion in Hall. (CR:23-24).\n\nDefense counsel argued that under Hall, it is unconstitutional to\n\ninstruct the potential jurors that an IQ of “70 or below” as “it’s actually\n\na moving scale now, depending on the evidence from an expert.”\n\n(RR47:7).    Counsel argued that “by application and by statutory\n\nstatement through the Brisenio [sic] case, we feel that there’s an\n\nunconstitutionality there.”      (RR47:7).     The trial court overruled\n\nAppellant’s objection to the State being permitted to instruct the\n\npotential jurors that the first prong of the test for intellectual disability\n\nrequires an IQ of 70 or below. (RR47:11-12).\n\n     On June 13, 2014, the trial court conducted a second hearing on\n\nAppellant’s motion. At that time, Appellant argued that “Briseno no\n\nlonger applies” after Hall. (RR53:15). The defense maintained its June\n\n3rd argument that the jury had been improperly questioned on the\n\nmatter during voir dire.       (RR53:16-17).      The trial court denied\n\nAppellant’s motion to quash the panel. (RR56:4).\n\n\n                                     169\n\f                            Applicable Law\n\n                                  Atkins\n\n     In Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 321 (2002), the United States\n\nSupreme Court held that the execution of intellectually disabled\n\ndefendants violates the Eighth Amendment. A fundamental premise of\n\nAtkins is that the clinical definition of intellectual disability takes into\n\naccount “that IQ scores represent a range, not a fixed number[.]” Hall,\n\n134 S. Ct. at 1999. “And those clinical definitions have long included\n\nthe [standard error or measurement “SEM”.]” Id.\n\n                                  Briseno\n\n     For the purposes of an Atkins claim, this Court has defined\n\nintellectual disability in accordance with the criteria adopted by the\n\nAmerican Association on Mental Retardation (AAMR) and the Texas\n\nHealth and Safety Code as (1) significant sub-average general\n\nintellectual functioning, usually evidenced by an intelligence quotient\n\n(IQ) score below 70, that is accompanied by, (2) related limitations in\n\nadaptive functioning, (3) the onset of which occurs prior to the age of 18.\n\nSee Briseno, 135 S.W.3d at 7-8; see also Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann.\n\n§ 591.003(7-a) (West Supp. 2015).           The Briseno Court defined\n\n\n                                    170\n\fsignificantly subaverage intellectual functioning as an IQ of about 70 or\n\nbelow (approximately two standard deviations below the mean). Id. at 7\n\nn.24; see also Williams v. State, 270 S.W.3d 112, 113-14 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2008) (noting this Court’s adoption of the AAMR definition of\n\nintellectual disability, which is defined, in part, as “an IQ ‘of about 70’\n\nor below”)) (citing Briseno, 135 S.W.3d at 7 n.24). Regarding adaptive\n\nfunctioning, this Court recognized that the determination may be\n\ndifficult as the criteria “are exceedingly subjective” and articulated\n\nseven factors that a fact-finder may consider when resolving that prong:\n\n         Did those who knew the person best during the\n          developmental stage – his family, friends, teachers,\n          employers, authorities – think he was mentally\n          retarded at that time, and, if so, act in accordance\n          with that determination?\n\n         Has the person formulated plans and carried them\n          through or is his conduct impulsive?\n\n         Does his conduct show leadership or does it show that\n          he is led around by others?\n\n         Is his conduct in response to external stimuli rational\n          and appropriate, regardless of whether it is socially\n          unacceptable?\n\n         Does he respond coherently, rationally, and on point to\n          oral or written questions or do his responses wander\n          from subject to subject?\n\n                                    171\n\f          Can the person hide facts or lie effectively in his own\n           or others’ interests?\n\n          Putting aside any heinousness or gruesomeness\n           surrounding the capital offense, did the commission of\n           that offense require forethought, planning, and\n           complex execution of purpose?\n\nId. at 8-9.\n\n                               Hall v. Florida\n\n      In Hall, the United States Supreme Court held that Florida’s\n\ninterpretation of its intellectual disability statute was unconstitutional.\n\n134 S. Ct. at 2000.     Freddie Hall filed a motion claiming that he was\n\nintellectually disabled and could not be executed. Id. at 1991-92. He\n\npresented in IQ score of 71.25 Id. at 1992. Florida argued that Hall was\n\nnot allowed to present any additional evidence of his intellectual\n\ndisability because he had failed as a threshold matter to present\n\nevidence of an IQ score of 70 or below.          Id.     The Florida court’s\n\ninterpretation of the strict 70 cutoff did not permit consideration of the\n\nSEM. Because Hall failed to meet the strict cutoff, he was not allowed\n\nto present evidence of adaptive deficits. See id.\n\n\n25Hall presented multiple IQ scores, but some were excluded, leaving only scores\nbetween 71 and 80. Id.\n                                      172\n\f     The United States Supreme Court noted that, on its face, there\n\nwas nothing in the Florida statute to preclude consideration of the\n\nstandard error of measurement. Hall, 134 S.Ct. at 1994. The problem\n\nwas that the Florida Supreme Court had interpreted the provisions of\n\nthe intellectual disability statute too narrowly:\n\n     It has held that a person whose test score is above 70,\n     including a score within the margin for measurement error,\n     does not have an intellectual disability and is barred from\n     presenting other evidence that would show his faculties are\n     limited.\n\nId. at 1994 (citing Cherry v. State, 959 So. 2d 702, 712-13 (Fla. 2007)\n\n(per curiam)).    This interpretation contradicts established medical\n\npractice because it uses an IQ score as “final and conclusive evidence of\n\na defendant’s intellectual capacity” even though an IQ score is “on its\n\nown terms, imprecise” and because experts in the field would still\n\nconsider other evidence. Id. at 1995. Hall holds that individual states\n\nmay not bar a defendant from litigating an intellectual disability claim\n\nby implementing a mandatory and rigid IQ test-score cutoff, without\n\nconsidering the IQ test’s SEM. Id. at 2001.\n\n                             Texas post-Hall\n\n     Nearly six months after Hall, in Ex parte Cathey, this Court\n\n                                    173\n\freaffirmed Texas’ use of the definition of intellectual disability adopted\n\nin Briseno. Ex parte Cathey, 451 S.W.3d 1, 9 fn.15 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2014).   Briseno was affirmed again in Ex parte Moore, 470 S.W.3d 481\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2015), cert. granted in part, 136 S. Ct. 2407 (2016). In\n\nMoore, this Court reiterated that, in the absence of action by the\n\nLegislature, Texas would “continue to follow the AAMR’s 1992\n\ndefinition of intellectual disability . . . adopted in Briseno for Atkins\n\nclaims presented in Texas death-penalty claims.” Id. at 486 (citing In\n\nre Allen, 462 S.W.3d 47, 52 (Tex. Crim. App. 2015)).        Citing Hall, this\n\nCourt stated that “the legal test we established in Briseno remains\n\nadequately      ‘informed   by   the    medical   community’s     diagnostic\n\nframework.’” Id. at 487 (citing Hall, 134 S.Ct. at 2000).\n\n                                 Analysis\n\n     Appellant’s      contention       that   Briseno    was       rendered\n\nunconstitutional after Hall lacks merit. Hall stands for the proposition\n\nthat states cannot implement bright line IQ cutoff scores when\n\nconsidering a capital defendant’s claim of intellectual disability.      134\n\nS. Ct. at 2001. Briseno does not call for the use of a bright-line IQ\n\ncutoff score.    Appellant cites no Texas cases implementing a bright-\n\n\n                                       174\n\fline IQ cutoff score. Indeed, in Moore, this Court stated:\n\n     Regarding Briseno’s first prong, general intellectual\n     functioning is defined by the IQ and obtained by assessment\n     with a standardized, individually administered intelligence\n     test. There is a measurement error of approximately five\n     points in assessing IQ, which may vary from instrument to\n     instrument. Therefore, when determining whether an\n     applicant has met Briseno’s first prong, we consider the fact\n     that any IQ score could actually represent a score that is\n     five points higher or five points lower than the score than he\n     actually obtained.\n\nMoore, 470 S.W. 3d at 487 (internal quotations and citations omitted);\n\nsee also Ex parte Hearn, 310 S.W.3d 424, 428 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010)\n\n(noting that there is a measurement error of approximately 5 points in\n\nassessing IQ, which varies from instrument to instrument; thus,\n\ndepending on the IQ test used, a score could actually represent a score\n\nthat is five points higher or five points lower than the actual test\n\nresult); Ex parte Woods, 296 S.W.3d 587, 608 n.35 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2009) (taking into account a potential five-point deviation up or down\n\nin an IQ score). Notably, the Hall Court did not identify Texas as a\n\nstate that, like Florida, employs a bright-line IQ cutoff score. Because\n\nthe definition of intellectual disability announced in Briseno does not\n\npreclude consideration of the SEM, it is not unconstitutional under\n\n                                   175\n\fHall.\n\n        In his brief, Appellant invites this Court to reconsider Briseno in\n\nlight of Hall. He cites Judge Price’s concurring opinion in Cathey and\n\nJudge Alcala’s dissent26 in Ex parte Lizcano, in support of his\n\ncontention that Briseno is un-scientific and unconstitutional.            See\n\nCathey, 451 S.W.3d at 28 (Price, J., concurring); Ex parte Lizcano, No.\n\nWR-68,348-03, 2015 Tex. Crim. App. Unpub. LEXIS 331, at *2 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. Apr. 15, 2015) (Alcala, J., dissenting) (not designated for\n\npublication). Neither opinion advances Appellant’s argument.           In his\n\nbrief opinion in Cathey, Judge Price criticized Briseno, however, his\n\ndisagreement was “with the Court’s decidedly non-diagnostic approach\n\nto evaluating the adaptive deficits prong[,]” not the subaverage-IQ\n\nprong. Cathey, 451 S.W.3d at 28.       In Lizcano, Judge Alcala criticized\n\nBriseno, but, like Judge Price, her criticism concerned the factors used\n\nto determine the adaptive functioning prong, not the subaverage-IQ\n\nprong. Lizcano, 2015 Tex. Crim. App. Unpub. LEXIS at *5-6.                 As\n\nargued above, Hall concerns the subaverage-IQ prong, not the adaptive\n\nfunctioning prong.\n26 In fact, Appellant refers to “Judge Newell’s dissenting opinion” in Lizcano.\nAlthough Judge Newell did dissent, it was Judge Alcala who filed the dissenting\nopinion.\n                                      176\n\f     On appeal, Appellant also complains that Briseno requires a\n\ndefendant to prove that his deficits in adaptive functioning are the\n\nresult of an intellectual disability and not a personality disorder.\n\n(Appellant’s Brief pp.90-98). This argument is procedurally barred as\n\nAppellant failed to raise it in the trial court.   See Tex. R. App. P.\n\n33.1(a).\n\n     Regardless, Appellant’s complaint lacks merit. Briseno does not\n\nrequire a defendant to prove that his adaptive deficits are not the\n\nresult of a personality disorder.    The complained-of language from\n\nBriseno provides as follows:\n\n     The adaptive behavior criteria are exceedingly subjective,\n     and undoubtedly experts will be found to offer opinions on\n     both sides of the issue in most cases. There are, however,\n     some other evidentiary factors which factfinders in the\n     criminal trial context might also focus upon in weighing\n     evidence as indicative of mental retardation or of a\n     personality disorder.\n\nBriseno, 135 S.W.3d at 8 (emphasis added).           The above-quoted\n\nlanguage does not impose an additional evidentiary requirement upon\n\nthe defense.    This language simply explains that the proposed\n\n“evidentiary factors” may help to distinguish between adaptive deficits\n\nrelated to intellectual disability and adaptive deficits related to\n\n\n                                    177\n\fsomething other than intellectual disability. See Moore, 470 S.W.3d at\n\n488 (stating that “An applicant must . . . demonstrate by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that his adaptive behavior deficits are\n\nrelated to significantly sub-average general intellectual functioning\n\nrather than some other cause.”).\n\n         In any event, use of the Briseno evidentiary factors - - which\n\nwould then be used to weigh evidence “as indicative of mental\n\nretardation or of a personality disorder” - - is not mandatory. Id. at 8.\n\nThis Court stated that the factfinders “might . . . focus” on the listed\n\nevidentiary factors. Id. (emphasis added); Ex parte Sosa, 364 S.W.3d\n\n889, 892 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012) (stating that “we did not make\n\nconsideration of any or all of [the Briseno] factors mandatory”).\n\n         Issue 31 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE NOS. 32-34: THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR\nIN OVERRULING APPELLANT’S MOTION TO QUASH, HIS MOTION TO RE-\nQUESTION JURORS, AND HIS MOTION TO LIMIT THE STATE’S VOIR DIRE.27\n\n\n         In Issue 32, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in\n\noverruling his motion to quash the jury after the Supreme Court\n\ndecision in Hall. In Issue 33, Appellant contends that the trial court\n\n\n27   Because Appellant presents Issues 32-34 together, the State will do so as well.\n                                           178\n\ferred in overruling his request to re-question the qualified jurors in\n\nlight of Hall. In Issue 34, Appellant contends that the trial court erred\n\nin overruling his objection that the State not be allowed to voir dire the\n\njury under Briseno. Appellant’s contentions lack merit.\n\n                              Pertinent Facts\n\n      Individual voir dire began on March 31, 2014. (RR12). On May\n\n27, 2014, while jury selection was still underway in this case, the\n\nSupreme Court decided Hall. See Hall, 134 S.Ct. 1986.              At the time\n\nHall was decided, ten jurors had been seated on Appellant’s jury.28\n\n      On June 3, 2014, Appellant filed a Motion to Quash the Jury\n\nPanel based on Hall.       (CR:23-24).       The visiting judge conducted a\n\nhearing on Appellant’s motion but deferred a ruling until the motion\n\nwas presented to the trial court.            (RR47:5-12).      Appellant also\n\n“object[ed] to the State . . . telling jurors that the burden on the Defense\n\nis to prove an IQ of 70 or below, or below 70.” (RR47:5).            Appellant\n\nargued that “may be unconstitutional or is unconstitutional” under\n\nHall. (RR47:5-6). This objection was overruled. (RR47:11-12).\n\n      On June 13, 2014, the trial court conducted a second hearing on\n28 Dunn-Jelen (#208); Daquiera (#256); Blomberg (#259); Kvalheim (#316); Clark\n(#353); Davenport (#504); Agnes (#588); Kiefer (#685); Wells (#802); and, McElyea\n(#857).\n                                       179\n\fAppellant’s motion. At that time, Appellant argued that “Briseno no\n\nlonger applies” after Hall. (RR53:15). The defense maintained its June\n\n3rd argument that the jury had been improperly questioned about the\n\nBriseno factors during voir dire. (RR53:16-17).     Seven days later, the\n\ntrial court convened a third hearing, during which it denied Appellant’s\n\nmotion and stated:\n\n     The Court is denying that motion. And offering the Defense\n     the opportunity as well as the State to bring the panel in\n     either collectively or one at a time to revisit the issue of 70\n     benchmark for mental retardation. The State - - made\n     reference by the State. Bearing in mind that the Court will\n     note for the record that in its questioning, the State did\n     include other factors that the jury may take into\n     consideration when making a determination of mental\n     retardation. However, since the majority of the questions\n     asked to the majority of the jurors indicated 70, I think it is\n     appropriate to revisit with the jurors. The Defense will\n     have the option of whether it wishes to proceed in that\n     manner. Or the Court is also of the opinion should the issue\n     surface during the trial, that the matter could be cured by a\n     jury instruction.\n\n(RR56:4-5).\n\n     After the competency trial, but before the beginning of the\n\npunishment trial, the trial court conducted a fourth hearing in\n\nconnection with Appellant’s motion to quash. (RR59:9). The trial court\n\n                                   180\n\fstated that, in light of Hall, it was going to individually question each of\n\nthe jurors on the panel. (RR59:9). The judge described the procedure to\n\nbe followed:\n\n       Defendant having been found competent to stand trial,\n       there’s several issues we need to address, one being\n       reviewing the . . . mental retardation issue with the panel.\n       The Court is proposing to do that individually, by calling in\n       the jurors in the order they were selected.\n\n       In the event any indicate they are not able to follow the law,\n       then we do have alternate jurors that we can question. The\n       Court is proposing to do that questioning and, in the event\n       that the jurors raise issues or questions, then I’ll allow the\n       attorneys to address or answer those questions or question\n       jurors as they may be needed.\n\n       In that absence, however, if the jurors indicate they are able\n       to follow the law, then that will conclude the Court’s\n       questioning, with respect to each and every juror, and that\n       will be the only issue that the Court will go into.\n\n(RR59:9-10). Appellant objected to the proposed procedure. (RR59:13-\n\n18).\n\n       Each juror was then brought into the courtroom individually,\n\ninformed that during jury selection the United States Supreme Court\n\nissued an opinion regarding intellectual disability and now, the trial\n\ncourt was meeting with each of the jurors to clarify the definition of\n\n                                     181\n\fintellectual disability.    The judge reminded each juror of the three-\n\nprong definition of intellectual disability and then advised that with\n\nregard to IQ scores, the score is not fixed, but represents a range or\n\napproximation of the IQ. (RR59:21-61). Each juror was asked whether\n\nhe or she could follow the law and whether he or she had any questions.\n\nEach of the jurors testified that they could follow the law. None had\n\nany questions. (RR59:22, 25, 30-33, 35-36, 38-45, 47, 49-50, 52, 55-56,\n\n58, 60-61).\n\n     After the trial court concluded its questioning of the jurors,\n\nAppellant made a bill of exception at which time he recited a list of\n\nquestions that he proposed to ask the prospective jurors following Hall.\n\n(RR59:61-65).\n\n                             Standard of Review\n\n                               Motion to Quash\n\n     An appellate court reviews a trial court’s denial of a motion to\n\nquash a jury panel under an abuse of discretion standard. See Mendoza\n\nv. State, 552 S.W.2d 444, 447 (Tex. Crim. App. 1977).\n\n                           Limitation on Questioning\n\n     An appellate court reviews a trial court’s limitation on questioning\n\n\n                                      182\n\fprospective jurors for an abuse of discretion. See Tamez v. State, 27\n\nS.W.3d 668, 672 (Tex. App.—Waco 2000, pet. ref’d).\n\n                           Applicable Law\n\n     Preventing defense counsel from asking proper questions of the\n\nvenire is not an error of constitutional dimension per se. See Easley v.\n\nState, 424 S.W.3d 535, 536 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014).      The trial court\n\nretains the authority to impose reasonable restrictions “for various\n\nreasons, among them to curb the prolixity of what can become the\n\nlengthiest part of a criminal proceeding.” Bodde v. State, 568 S.W.2d\n\n344, 350 (Tex. Crim. App. 1978).\n\n                               Analysis\n\n     Appellant’s issues are insufficiently briefed and therefore nothing\n\nis presented for this Court’s review. See Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(i). After\n\ndescribing the facts underlying his claims, Appellant devotes a single\n\nparagraph to argue three issues.     He fails to recite the standard of\n\nreview and he fails to offer any specific argument or discussion of the\n\nauthority in support of his contentions regarding any of the three\n\ncomplained-of issues. This Court is not required to make Appellant’s\n\ncase for him. Garcia v. State, 887 S.W.2d 862, 882 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n\n                                   183\n\f1994) (stating that a reviewing court “will not brief appellant’s case for\n\nhim”).\n\n                             Issue 32: Motion to Quash\n\n      The trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling\n\nAppellant’s motion to quash the jury panel after the Supreme Court’s\n\ndecision in Hall. As argued above, Hall stands for the proposition that\n\nstates may not prevent a defendant from litigating an intellectual\n\ndisability claim by implementing a mandatory and rigid IQ test score\n\ncutoff, without considering the IQ test’s SEM. Hall, 134 S.Ct. at 2001.\n\nUnlike Florida, Texas does not utilize a cut-off IQ score as a threshold\n\nfor litigating an intellectual disability claim.        Because Texas has no\n\napplicable statute, intellectual disability claims in death penalty cases\n\nare governed by Briseno. Briseno allows for consideration of the SEM in\n\nconnection with an IQ test. Briseno, 135 S.W.3d at 7 n.24. As a result,\n\neven after Hall, Briseno remains valid law. The jurors in this case were\n\nquestioned in accordance with Briseno. Appellant points to no place in\n\nthe transcript where any juror was questioned improperly.29\n\n\n29 During the second hearing on Appellant’s motion to quash, defense counsel\nargued that the jurors were instructed “that the IQ was 70 or below, and sometimes\nthey were told below 70[.]” (RR53:5). Counsel did not identify the jurors she claims\nwere improperly questioned.\n                                        184\n\f     Before the jury was sworn, the trial court conducted a brief\n\nhearing with each individual juror. Each juror was informed of the\n\nSupreme Court’s recent decision in Hall, reminded of the three-prong\n\ntest for intellectual disability, and informed that the significantly-\n\nsubaverage-IQ score of 70 is not a fixed number, but represents a range.\n\nEach juror was asked whether he or she could follow the law.           The\n\njurors were asked if they had any questions.         Although none had\n\nquestions, if a juror had asked one, the trial court planned to “allow the\n\nattorneys to address or answer those questions or question jurors as\n\nthey may be needed.” (RR59:9-10).\n\n     From the beginning, the jurors were questioned in accordance\n\nwith valid law. Nevertheless, the trial court took the added precaution\n\nof informing each juror individually that an IQ score is not a fixed score.\n\nEach of the jurors said that they could follow the law. Accordingly the\n\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling Appellant’s motion\n\nto quash. See Mendoza, 552 S.W.2d at 447. At a minimum, the decision\n\nfalls within the zone of reasonable disagreement. Weatherred v. State,\n\n15 S.W.3d 540, 542 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000).\n\n     Issue 32 should be overruled.\n\n\n                                     185\n\f                      Issue 33: Re-question Jurors\n\n     The trial court did not err in denying Appellant’s motion to re-\n\nquestion the jurors following Hall. Again, Hall did not change the law\n\nin Texas. Like the State, during individual voir dire, Appellant had\n\nforty-five minutes to question each prospective juror and at that time he\n\ncould have asked them about the SEM. Notably, Appellant offers no\n\nexplanation as to why he was unable to ask the questions he proposed\n\nduring his bill of exception during his regular voir dire.\n\n     It was well within the trial court’s discretion to deny Appellant’s\n\nmotion to re-question the jurors. See Bodde, 568 S.W.2d at 350 (stating\n\nthat a trial court may impose reasonable restrictions on voir dire).\n\nAppellant’s proposed questions – all of which he could have asked\n\nduring his portion of voir dire – would have simply and unnecessarily\n\nprolonged voir dire. In any event, any alleged harm was cured when\n\nthe trial court conducted its own questioning, informed each juror that\n\nan IQ score is not a fixed number, and ensured that each juror could\n\nfollow the law.\n\n     Issue 33 should be overruled.\n\n\n                                     186\n\f                  Issue 34: Objection to State’s Voir Dire\n\n       The trial court did not err in denying Appellant’s objection to the\n\nState being allowed to say “70 or below” in explaining the definition of\n\nintellectual disability.   The only basis for Appellant’s objection to the\n\nState’s voir dire is his claim that it is not allowed under Hall.      As\n\nargued above, Hall did not change the law in Texas. Hall rejects bright-\n\nline 70 IQ cutoff scores, which Texas does not apply. Appellant points\n\nto no evidence that the State informed any juror during voir dire that\n\nan IQ score is fixed or that the SEM is not to be considered.\n\n       Issues 34 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE NOS. 35-36:      APPELLANT WAS NOT DEPRIVED\nOF A LAWFULLY CONSTITUTED JURY.\n\n\n       In Issues 35 and 36, Appellant contends that the trial court’s\n\nrulings “in reference to each juror complained about previously”\n\ndeprived him of a lawfully constituted jury resulting in violations of his\n\nrights under the state and federal constitutions and under article 35.16\n\nof the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.       (Appellant’s Brief pp. 105-\n\n07).\n\n\n\n                                    187\n\f     Appellant’s contentions lack merit as he has failed to show that he\n\nwas deprived of a lawfully constituted jury. He has failed to show the\n\ntrial court’s rulings on any of the challenges resulted in the seating of a\n\njuror who was biased or prejudiced. If an appellant does not present\n\nrecord evidence demonstrating that the trial court’s error deprived him\n\nof a jury comprised of legally qualified jurors, he has suffered no harm\n\nand the reviewing court should presume the jurors are qualified. See\n\nGray v. State, 233 S.W.3d 295, 301 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007).\n\n     Issues 35 and 36 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S   RESPONSE TO ISSUE     37:    THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR IN\nDENYING    APPELLANT’S     MOTION       TO   DISQUALIFY   THE    DISTRICT\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE.\n\n\n     Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his pre-\n\ntrial motion to disqualify the Dallas County District Attorney’s Office\n\nfrom prosecuting the instant case. He contends that he was denied due\n\nprocess as the result of a conflict of interest that arose when his former\n\nsecond-chair counsel was hired as an Assistant District Attorney while\n\nthe case was in the pretrial stages. Appellant’s contentions lack merit.\n\n                            Pertinent Facts\n\n     Appellant was originally tried in September 1987. (CR:208). At\n\n                                      188\n\fthe time, he was represented by Wayne Huff and Doug Parks.\n\n(CR:208). When his case was remanded for a new trial on punishment,\n\nthe trial court appointed new counsel. In January 2011, Russell Wilson\n\nwas appointed second-chair trial counsel.             (CR:196; RR3:6, 14).         On\n\nOctober 6, 2011, Wilson filed a motion to withdraw from Appellant’s\n\ncase. (CR:196). In his motion, Wilson wrote that “[i]n June of 2011 [he]\n\naccepted employment with the Dallas County District Attorney’s\n\nOffice.” (CR:196).      “After accepting employment, [Wilson] no longer\n\nperformed work on Mr. Thomas’s behalf.” (CR:196).                   The trial court\n\ngranted Wilson’s motion to withdraw. (CR:197).\n\n      On September 7, 2011, Appellant filed a motion to disqualify the\n\nDallas County District Attorney’s Office.            (CR4:9-12).      The basis for\n\nAppellant’s motion was that Wilson, one of the attorneys who\n\nrepresented him prior to trial, was now employed by the office\n\nresponsible for his prosecution.30 (CR4:9-12). The trial court conducted\n\na hearing on Appellant’s motion.          At the hearing, Wilson testified that\n\nhe was appointed to Appellant’s case as “the second chair.” (RR3:6).\n\nRegarding his work on the case, Wilson testified that he had at least\n\n30Wilson could not the recall specific date he began at the District Attorney’s Office,\nbut he believed it was either July 1, 2011 or July 5, 2011.\n                                         189\n\fone conversation with Appellant, some conversations with lead defense\n\ncounsel, and he had received a packet of discovery from the State.\n\n(RR3:8-10).      According to Wilson, he had “not functioned as\n\n[Appellant’s] attorney . . . since [he] knew that [he] was going to be\n\ntaking a position at the district attorney’s office.” (RR3:7). He did not\n\nbelieve that he had any information about the case or witnesses that\n\nlead counsel did not also have. (RR3:17-18).\n\n     Wilson testified that prior to accepting employment at the District\n\nAttorney’s Office, he discussed with then-elected District Attorney\n\nCraig Watkins “certain understandings regarding the law and the\n\ndiscretion of the district attorney has [sic] as it relates to whether or not\n\nto seek a recusal. (RR3:21-22). Wilson and Watkins later had another\n\nconversation during which Wilson was instructed that he was not\n\nallowed to discuss Appellant’s case with “anybody.” (RR3:20). The lead\n\nprosecutor,   Brandon Birmingham,          was not    allowed to     discuss\n\nAppellant’s case with Wilson either. (RR3:20).\n\n     Wilson testified that he does not supervise Birmingham or anyone\n\nelse in the felony trial bureau division. (RR3:22). He agreed, however,\n\nthat if Appellant were sentenced to death, lawyers in one of the\n\n\n                                     190\n\fdivisions that he does supervise would be responsible for reviewing\n\nAppellant’s case. (RR3:12-13).\n\n     Appellant’s motion was denied. (RR4:4).\n\n                            Applicable Law\n\n     It is well-settled law that a district attorney’s office, not a trial\n\ncourt, determines at its discretion when a conflict of interest exists that\n\nrequires recusal. See Coleman v. State, 246 S.W.3d 76, 81 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2008); State ex. rel. Hill v. Pirtle, 887 S.W.2d 921, 939 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1994) (indicating the district attorney must initiate his own\n\nrecusal).    The offices of the district attorneys in Texas are\n\nconstitutionally created and constitutionally protected.     State ex rel.\n\nEidson v. Edwards, 793 S.W.2d 1, 4 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990).             The\n\nauthority of a district attorney cannot be abridged or taken away, and a\n\ncourt may not remove a district attorney from an individual case absent\n\none of three statutorily defined circumstances: (1) incompetency, (2)\n\nofficial misconduct, or (3) intoxication. Id. at 4-5; Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code\n\nAnn. §§ 87.013, 87.018(a) (West 2008). Moreover, a trial by jury must\n\nbe held before removal.     Eidson, 793 S.W.2d at 5.      If a trial court\n\nremoves a district attorney and his office from a case by court order, it\n\n\n                                    191\n\fdoes so “without authority or jurisdiction.”       See id. at 5 (concluding\n\nerror occurred where the trial judge’s order disqualified the district\n\nattorney because prior defense counsel became an assistant prosecutor\n\nand the trial court sought to avoid the appearance of impropriety).\n\n      In Eidson, defense counsel Ross Adair represented the defendant\n\nduring the investigation stage of a case and at an examining trial.\n\nEidson, 793 S.W.2d at 3. Adair later joined the district attorney’s office\n\nand conducted research for the State’s response to the motion to recuse\n\nthe district attorney in his former client’s case. Id. When the elected\n\ndistrict attorney realized Adair had previously represented the\n\ndefendant, the district attorney gave him instructions not to discuss the\n\ncase with anyone in the District Attorney’s office nor allow anyone to\n\ndiscuss it in his presence. Id. The trial judge granted the defense’s\n\nmotion to recuse the district attorney’s office based on an appearance of\n\nimpropriety. Id. Because no statutory factor for removal was met, this\n\nCourt held the trial judge entered the order without authority or\n\njurisdiction, stating that if a conflict of interest exists, responsibility for\n\nrecusal lies with the district attorney’s office, not the trial court. Id. at\n\n6.\n\n\n                                      192\n\f                                Analysis\n\n     As a threshold matter, it is the State’s position that Appellant\n\nfailed to properly brief this issue. See Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(i). Appellant\n\nasserts that the trial court erred and provides a few facts in connection\n\nwith his complaint, but other than the citation to Eidson, he fails to\n\noffer any specific argument or discussion of the authority in support of\n\nhis contention. This Court is not required to make Appellant’s case for\n\nhim. Garcia, 887 S.W.2d at 882.\n\n     In any event, Appellant’s argument fails.        Current Texas law\n\nprovides that if an assistant district attorney has previously\n\nrepresented a defendant in a particular proceeding, then that particular\n\nattorney is disqualified from assisting in the prosecution of the case, but\n\nthe elected prosecutor and his other assistants are not. Scarborough v.\n\nState, 54 S.W.3d 419, 424 (Tex. App.—Waco 2001, pet. ref’d). Therefore,\n\nalthough Wilson could not participate in the instant prosecution,\n\nnothing prevented the district attorney or any of his assistants from\n\nprosecuting Appellant.\n\n     The State notes that in his motion and at the hearing, Appellant\n\ndid not raise any statutory grounds for District Attorney Craig Watkins’\n\n\n                                    193\n\fdisqualification, and no statutory grounds existed. Appellant argued at\n\ntrial and contends on appeal that a trial court may disqualify a district\n\nattorney where a conflict of interest rises to the level of a due process\n\nviolation, but he failed to assert or show how the alleged conflict\n\nviolated due process. He now asks this Court to conclude that this case\n\nconstitutes an exception to Eidson and current Texas law because (1) it\n\nis a death case, (2) former counsel worked on the case, (3) appellate\n\nattorneys in the District Attorney’s office involved in prosecuting the\n\ncase fall under Wilson’s supervision, (4) the district attorney\n\ndetermined to seek death before hiring Wilson, and (5) “the appearance\n\nof impropriety in the due process of the case.” (Appellant’s Brief p. 108).\n\n      In State ex rel. Hill v. Pirtle, this Court held that “[a] trial court\n\nmay not disqualify a district attorney or his staff on the basis of a\n\nconflict of interest that does not rise to the level of a due-process\n\nviolation.”   Landers v. State, 256 S.W.3d 295, 304 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2008) (citing State ex rel. Hill v. Pirtle, 887 S.W.2d 921, 927 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1994)). At trial, as on appeal, Appellant argues generally that his\n\ndue process rights were violated based on an alleged conflict of interest,\n\nbut he does not point to any evidence of it in the record. Appellant does\n\n\n                                    194\n\fnot allege his former counsel conveyed information to the prosecution\n\nand he does not allege wrongdoing by anyone involved. There is no\n\nevidence or even suggestion of any impropriety in the record.         See\n\nLanders, 256 S.W.3d at 297-98 (holding no due process violation in\n\nprosecution for intoxication manslaughter where elected district\n\nattorney previously represented defendant in DWI prosecution because\n\nthere was no evidence the State used any confidential information).\n\n     Appellant’s assertion the State violated his due process rights—\n\nbased on an “appearance of impropriety,” that this is a death penalty\n\ncase, that his former counsel worked extensively on the case, that\n\nWilson supervised the appellate division, or that the District Attorney\n\nmade the decision to seek a death sentence prior to hiring Wilson—\n\ncarries no weight because no actual due process violation occurred.\n\n     The trial court properly denied Appellant’s motion to disqualify\n\nthe District Attorney. Issue 37 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S   RESPONSE    TO   ISSUE   38:    THE   TRIAL   COURT   PROPERLY\nOVERRULED APPELLANT’S MOTION FOR MISTRIAL DURING APPELLANT’S\nCOMPETENCY TRIAL.\n\n\n     Appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling the\n\nmotion for mistrial that he made during his competency trial.         He\n\n                                    195\n\fcontends that the prosecutor’s remark regarding the “murder weapon”\n\nviolated his right to due process and due course of law and prejudiced\n\nthe jury impaneled to determine his competency.              Appellant’s\n\ncontentions lack merit.\n\n                           Pertinent Facts\n\n     Prior to voir dire in connection with Appellant’s competency trial,\n\nthe defense filed a motion in limine “with respect to informing the jury\n\nin any manner the offense for which the Defendant is accused[.]”\n\n(CR:68). The trial court granted Appellant’s motion and stated:\n\n     . . . I did grant the Motion in Limine filed by Defense. Both\n     sides instruct their witnesses not to go into the offense.\n\n(CR:70; RR57:8).\n\n     During the competency trial, while cross-examining Appellant’s\n\nexpert, the prosecutor referred to the lack of a “murder weapon.”\n\n(RR58:29). The following exchange took place:\n\n     [Prosecutor]:   He has enough understanding of these\n     proceedings to tell you that he was framed, right?\n\n     [McGarrahan]: I’m not sure I understand the question.\n\n     [Prosecutor]: You mentioned that he told you that the jury\n     in this trial that was upcoming wasn’t fixing to see nothing.\n     And he used the words because he was “convicted without a\n                                  196\n\f     weapon.” That was something that was important to him.\n\n     He kept coming back to the fact there was no weapon; is\n     that right?\n\n     [McGarrahan]: The fact that there was no weapon; and\n     there must be, by law, a weapon. Yes.\n\n     [Prosecutor]: All right. Now, it is a fact - - it is not fiction,\n     but it is a fact that there was no murder weapon - - I’m\n     sorry.\n\n(RR58:29).   At that point, defense counsel objected and asked for the\n\njury to disregard the prosecutor’s last statement. (RR58:30). Outside\n\nthe presence of the jury, the defense requested a mistrial and argued\n\nthat an instruction to disregard would not “remove this harm from this\n\njury’s mind[.]” (RR58:31-33). The prosecutor stated that his use of the\n\nword “murder” was unintentional. (RR58:34). He pointed out that in\n\nthe testimony prior to that time, the jury had already heard several\n\nterms tending to indicate a serious underlying felony:            “weapon,”\n\n“exoneree,” and “Conviction Integrity Unit.”       (RR58:34).    The State\n\nargued that an instruction to disregard would cure any alleged error.\n\n(RR58:34).\n\n     The trial court denied Appellant’s motion for mistrial and gave the\n\n\n                                    197\n\fjury the following instruction:\n\n     . . . Ladies and Gentlemen, during the prosecutor’s\n     questioning of the witness, reference was made to the\n     underlying offense alleged against the Defendant. You are\n     hereby instructed to disregard any reference to that offense\n     and not consider it for any purpose, whatsoever.\n\n(RR58:36-37, 40).\n\n                            Applicable Law\n\n                                  Mistrial\n\n     An appellate court reviews the trial court’s denial of a motion for\n\nmistrial under an abuse-of-discretion standard. Hawkins v. State, 135\n\nS.W.3d 72, 77 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004). A mistrial is an appropriate\n\nremedy in extreme circumstances for a narrow class of highly\n\nprejudicial and incurable errors. Hawkins, 135 S.W.3d at 77; Wood v.\n\nState, 18 S.W.3d 642, 648 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000). A mistrial should\n\nonly halt trial proceedings when an error is so prejudicial that\n\ncontinuing the trial would be wasteful and futile because an impartial\n\nverdict cannot be reached or a conviction would have to be reversed on\n\nappeal due to obvious error. Ladd, 3 S.W.3d at 567.\n\n                            Competency Trial\n\n     Because a defendant’s guilt or innocence is not at issue during a\n\n                                    198\n\fhearing on his competency to stand trial, it is improper to introduce\n\nevidence of the offense during that hearing. See Callaway v. State, 594\n\nS.W.2d 440, 443 (Tex. Crim. App. 1980) (citing Ex parte Hagans, 558\n\nS.W.2d 457 (Tex. Crim. App. 1977)). However, not every mention of the\n\ncrime itself is prejudicial; to be prejudicial, \"[t]he evidence of the offense\n\npresented to the competency jury must be of such a nature as to deny\n\nthe accused a fair and impartial determination of his competency.\"\n\nBrandon v. State, 599 S.W.2d 567, 580 (Tex. Crim. App. 1979), vacated\n\non other grounds, 453 U.S. 902, 101 S. Ct. 3134, 69 L. Ed. 2d 988 (1981).\n\n     In the event of an error during the competency proceedings, the\n\nappropriate remedy is to abate the appeal and remand the cause to the\n\ntrial court to determine the feasibility of a retrospective competency\n\nproceeding. See Owens v. State, 473 S.W.3d 812, 816 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2015) (citing Turner v. State, 422 S.W.3d 676, 696-97 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2013)).\n\n                                 Analysis\n\n     Appellant was not denied a fair determination of his competency\n\nbecause the prosecutor referred to the “murder weapon” during cross-\n\nexamination.    See Goodman v. State, 701 S.W.2d 850, 863 (Tex. Crim.\n\n\n                                     199\n\fApp. 1985) overruled on other grounds by Hernandez v. State, 757\n\nS.W.2d 744, 752 (Tex. Crim. App. 1988) (finding no reversible error\n\nwhere the single reference to “the term ‘capital murder’ did not so\n\nconfuse or prejudice the jury against [Goodman] that he was deprived of\n\na fair determination on the matter of his competency to stand trial.”).\n\n     That the prosecutor made a single, passing reference to a “murder\n\nweapon” implied only the nature of the offense. Importantly, the\n\nprosecutor did not refer to the facts of the offense: Appellant broke into\n\nthe Finch home, stabbed Fred and Mildred to death, and then stole a\n\nsignificant portion of Fred’s wardrobe and a number of his other\n\npersonal belongings. Compare Barber v. State, 757 S.W.2d 359, 362\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1988) (finding no reversible error because the use of\n\nthe term “capital murder” during Barber’s competency trial referred\n\nonly to the nature of the offense, but not to the facts of the case) with\n\nCallaway, 594 S.W.2d at 441-42 (finding deprivation of a fair\n\ndetermination of competency where prosecutor argued that Callaway\n\nwould be “back on the streets” and witnesses referred to Callaway’s\n\nprior offenses and that he wanted to be placed in a psychiatric facility\n\nbecause it would be easy to escape).     The jury heard general testimony\n\n\n                                   200\n\fabout the existence of fingerprints and DNA, but they did not learn\n\nspecific details or any of the other evidence against Appellant. Notably,\n\nthe jury did not learn the true nature of the charged offense: capital\n\nmurder.\n\n     In any event, any alleged error was cured when the trial court\n\nsustained Appellant’s objection and instructed the jury to disregard the\n\nprosecutor’s   statement.    Our     system   presumes    that   judicial\n\nadmonishments to the jury are efficacious. Waldo v. State, 746 S.W.2d\n\n750, 754 (Tex. Crim. App. 1988). There is no evidence that shows the\n\njury disregarded the trial court’s instruction, and the remark was not so\n\nprejudicial that they could not ignore it. As such, the trial court acted\n\nwithin its discretion in denying the motion for mistrial and there was\n\nno harm. See Barber, 757 S.W.2d at 362 (finding any error caused by\n\nwitness’s reference to underlying “capital murder” during Barber’s\n\ncompetency trial cured when trial court sustained the objection and\n\ninstructed the jury to disregard).\n\n     Issue 38 should be overruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                     201\n\fSTATE’S   RESPONSE TO ISSUE NO.     39:     APPELLANT’S CLAIM THAT THE\nTRIAL COURT ERRED IN OVERRULING HIS OBJECTION DURING THE\nCOMPETENCY TRIAL IS NOT PROPERLY BEFORE THE COURT.\n\n\n     Appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nobjection during the competency trial. He complains that the\n\nprosecutor’s question regarding the reversal of Appellant’s 1987 trial\n\nwas inadmissible under Rule 403.            Appellant’s contention is not\n\nproperly before the Court.\n\n                             Pertinent Facts\n\n     During    the   competency    trial,    the   prosecutor   questioned\n\nAppellant’s expert about the fact that Appellant was hoping to get a\n\n“harsher sentence” so that he would have “more appeals.” (RR58:23).\n\nThe following exchange occurred:\n\n     [State]: So he has more appeals. It is true that Kenneth\n     Thomas - - appeals have been very fruitful for Kenneth\n     Thomas, haven’t they?\n\n     [McGarrahan]: They have.\n\n     [State]: Okay. That first trial that happened in ’87 in\n     February, that case was reversed on appeal, correct?\n\n(RR58:23-24). Defense counsel objected “to relevancy.” (RR58:24). The\n\nobjection was overruled. (RR58:24). The prosecutor asked his question\n\n                                   202\n\fagain, after which Appellant objected again “to relevancy.” (RR58:24).\n\nThe objection was again overruled. (RR58:24).\n\n                             Applicable Law\n\n     Grounds of error urged on appeal must comport with the\n\nobjections made at trial or error is not preserved. Guevara v.

At trial, Appellant objected to the\n\nprosecutor’s question on the basis of relevancy. (RR58:24). On appeal,\n\nAppellant argues that he is entitled to a reversal on the basis of a\n\nviolation of Rule 403. (Appellant’s Brief pp. 113-14).   Thus, Appellant\n\nfailed to preserve error regarding the complained-of question.          See\n\nGuevara, 97 S.W.3d at 583.\n\n     The fact that Appellant’s first trial was reversed on appeal was\n\nhighly relevant. See Tex. R. Evid. 401. Indeed, as the prosecutor’s\n\nsubsequent    questioning    showed,     Appellant   articulated   to   Dr.\n\nMcGarrahan that his prior sentence was “vacated” and his case\n\n“remanded.”    (RR58:24-25).    That Appellant’s prior sentence was\n\n\n                                   203\n\fvacated and that he was capable of articulating this information was\n\nprobative of his knowledge and understanding of the legal process. This\n\nevidence was relevant to the competency determination:               whether\n\nAppellant had a “rational as well as factual understanding of the\n\nproceedings against [him].” Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 46B.003(a)\n\n(West 2006).\n\n     On appeal, Appellant contends that the complained-of evidence\n\n“allowed the jury to confuse the issue of competency with the\n\nunderlying offense of murder.”      (Appellant’s Brief p.114).       He fails,\n\nhowever, to explain this confusion and he fails to specify how he was\n\nprejudiced. As such, this argument is insufficiently briefed and nothing\n\nis presented for this Court’s review. See Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(i).\n\n     Regardless, the same information came in elsewhere without\n\nobjection. (RR58:61). The complained-of question occurred during the\n\nState’s cross-examination of Dr. McGarrahan.         (RR58:24).        Later,\n\nduring the direct examination of defense witness Cynthia Short,\n\ndefense counsel asked a question to which Short responded, “Kenneth\n\nhad a belief that Judge White, in particular, had played a specific role\n\nin getting the case reversed.” (RR58:61). Defense counsel did not object\n\n\n                                    204\n\fto this statement. (RR58:61).      This Court has held that the erroneous\n\nadmission of evidence will not result in reversal when the same\n\nevidence was received elsewhere without objection.     See Coble v. State,\n\n330 S.W.3d 253, 282 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010).\n\n     Issue 39 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S   RESPONSE    TO   ISSUE    NOS.   40-41:   THE   EVIDENCE   WAS\nSUFFICIENT TO PROVE APPELLANT’S COMPETENCY TO STAND TRIAL.\n\n\n     In two issues, Appellant contends that the evidence is legally and\n\nfactually insufficient to support the jury’s verdict that he was competent\n\nto stand trial for capital murder. Appellant’s contentions lack merit\n\nand should be overruled.\n\n                            Pertinent Facts\n\n                            Appellant’s Case\n\n     Dr. Antoinette McGarrahan, a forensic and neuropsychologist,\n\nwas contacted by the defense in 2012 to conduct a neuropsychological\n\nevaluation as well as a competency-to-stand-trial evaluation of\n\nAppellant. (RR57:163-64, 167). Since then, she has spent “a little over\n\ntwelve hours” evaluating Appellant. (RR57:167).       In connection with\n\nAppellant’s recent competency evaluation, Dr. McGarrahan reviewed:\n\nAppellant’s prior mental health evaluations; transcripts of prior\n                                     205\n\fproceedings; affidavits from Appellant’s family; medical records; and,\n\nschool records. (RR57:170).\n\n       According     to     Dr.     McGarrahan,       the     results   of    her\n\nneuropsychological evaluation “are almost identical to the results [of his\n\nneuropsychological        evaluation    conducted]    about    28   years    ago.”\n\n(RR57:173).      She testified that it would be difficult “to be able to fake\n\nfrom one period to 28 years later on the same tests[.]” (RR57:173). She\n\nalso   administered       tests   to    determine    whether    Appellant     was\n\nmalingering and found that “he was putting forth good effort[.]”\n\n(RR57:173).      Indeed, Appellant tried to present himself in a positive\n\nlight, without intellectual disability, “because he believes that that\n\nbelittles him and removes some of his credibility[.]” (RR57:174).\n\n       Dr.     McGarrahan testified that Appellant was “not presently\n\ncompetent to stand trial.” (RR57:171-72). Her opinion was based on:\n\nneuropsychological testing, which showed that Appellant has a full\n\nscale IQ of 71.           (RR57:172).      Additionally, “he has significant\n\nimpairment in his ability to problem solve, plan, organize, [and] think\n\nrationally.”     (RR57:172).      Appellant perseverates; he “has difficulty\n\ngetting past certain beliefs that he has, that are not based in reality[.]”\n\n\n                                         206\n\f(RR57:172). Appellant is “not able to rationally assist his attorneys, as\n\nhe proceeds to trial.” (RR57:172).\n\n     For twenty-eight years, Appellant has maintained the belief,\n\ndespite being informed to the contrary, that the he cannot be convicted\n\n“if the State does not have a weapon.” (RR57:175). He has been told by\n\ncounsel and others that the weapon is not necessary for conviction, but\n\nhis belief remains strong. (RR57:175). Dr. McGarrahan testified that\n\nthe reason Appellant maintains his belief is rooted in his mental illness.\n\n(RR57:175). His belief is more than just a simple misunderstanding of\n\nthe legal system. (RR57:175-76).\n\n     Another belief that Appellant has maintained over the years is\n\nthat a State’s witness has been involved in “pulling the strings to make\n\nsure that he gets the worst situation possible.”       (RR57:177).    “He\n\nbelieves that this individual dressed in a jail uniform and escorted him\n\nover to court, on one occasion.” (RR57:177). Appellant also believes\n\nthat it would be to his benefit to “get the worst punishment possible.”\n\n(RR57:179).    Given Appellant’s irrational beliefs, he is unable to\n\nrationally consult with his attorneys regarding a strategy for his\n\ndefense. (RR57:179).\n\n\n                                     207\n\f     Dr. McGarrahan testified that Appellant has a factual, but not\n\nrational understanding of the proceedings against him.      (RR57:181).\n\nAnd, distortions in his memory and false beliefs affect his ability to\n\ndisclose information to counsel. (RR57:182). He does, however, have a\n\ngood understanding of the adversarial nature of the proceedings and\n\ncan exhibit appropriate courtroom behavior. (RR57:184). If he were to\n\ntestify, he could respond to questions and verbalize his responses, but\n\n“he would have significant difficulty testifying in a rational, logical\n\nmanner.” (RR57:184).    Appellant could be helped with medication and\n\ncompetency restoration training. (RR57:186).\n\n     According to Dr. McGarrahan, Appellant has a delusional disorder\n\nbut conceded that he is not schizophrenic and is not responding to\n\noutside voices or voices in his head. (RR57:185; RR58:6). Appellant is\n\nintellectually disabled, evidenced by his low IQ and deficits in his\n\nadaptive behavior, many of which began prior to the age of 18.\n\n(RR57:185).\n\n      Dr. McGarrahan conceded that in 1979, Appellant was involved\n\nin a trial and testified in his own defense. (RR58:11). At that time, he\n\nresponded to questions on direct and cross-examination in front of a\n\n\n                                  208\n\fjury.    (RR58:11).   To Dr. McGarrahan’s knowledge, no competency\n\nissues were raised at the time of that trial. (RR58:13). The first time\n\ncompetency was raised was in October of 1986, during jury selection.\n\n(RR58:13). At that time, Drs. Crowder, Koons, Lovett, and Nottingham\n\ntestified or wrote a report. (RR58:13). Drs. Koons and Nottingham\n\nfound Appellant to be competent. (RR58:15). Drs. Crowder and Lovett\n\nfound him to be incompetent. (RR58:46). In 1996, in connection with\n\nanother proceeding, Appellant was evaluated by Drs. Pittman and\n\nRogers. (RR58:15-16).        Dr. Pittman found him to be competent.\n\n(RR58:16). Dr. McGarrahan testified that Dr. Rogers’ opinion “wasn’t\n\nvery clear.”    (RR58:16).     In 2006, there was a hearing regarding\n\nAppellant’s case and no issues of competency were raised at that time.\n\n(RR58:16-17).\n\n        Regarding the evidence against him in this case, Appellant told\n\nDr. McGarrahan that he “was fucked over 27 years ago, because they\n\nonly have he said/she said.”     (RR58:18).   He said it was “hearsay.”\n\n(RR58:19). Appellant told Dr. McGarrahan that the fingerprints found\n\nat the scene were being reviewed by the Innocence Project. (RR58:20-\n\n21). He told her that when the fingerprints are reviewed, they will not\n\n\n                                    209\n\fmatch him.     (RR58:21). This “will stop everything and the Judge will\n\nset him free immediately.” (RR58:27). He identified the then-elected\n\nDistrict Attorney, Craig Watkins, and said that Watkins would be\n\nforced to drop the charges.        (RR58:27).   Appellant also told Dr.\n\nMcGarrahan that DNA testing “rendered him innocent.” (RR58:22).\n\n     Appellant wants a “harsher sentence” so that he will have “more\n\nappeals.” (RR58:23). He told her that his prior sentence was “vacated”\n\nand his case “remanded.” (RR58:24-25). He pointed out to her two\n\ncases from the Supreme Court relevant to his case and was “somewhat”\n\nable to describe the difference between them. (RR58:25-26).\n\n     Dr.     McGarrahan testified that      Appellant   is not   on any\n\npsychoactive medications. (RR58:41).\n\n     Cynthia Short, an attorney who performs client advocacy, was\n\nappointed by the trial court in 2011 to assist in Appellant’s case.\n\n(RR58:54).     Since then, she has spent sixty hours interviewing\n\nAppellant.    (RR58:55).   Appellant resembles prior clients who were\n\nfound incompetent.    (RR58:58).     He maintains a “fixed-false belief”\n\nabout his case and that belief informs his decisions. (RR58:59). He also\n\ndid not understand that the trial judge did not have a role in the\n\n\n                                    210\n\freversal of his case. (RR58:61).\n\n     Short did not believe that Appellant could make rational choices\n\nregarding his legal strategies. (RR58:63). For example, he did not want\n\nto be examined by the State’s expert despite being told that failure to do\n\nso would affect his lawyers’ ability to present evidence gathered on his\n\nbehalf. (RR58:63-65).\n\n     Short described Appellant as follows:\n\n     In many ways, Kenneth is very engaging. He can be very\n     animated. He is able to engage in a conversation. He’s\n     very, very spiritual. He’s very faithful. And we have had\n     many long, animated, good conversations about faith.\n\n     But when we switch to talk about things that are related to\n     the legal process, to criminal justice, then there is a\n     different way in which he understands or attends. He\n     becomes more rigid and flexible [sic], in terms of his\n     understanding of the system and how to make decisions.\n\n(RR58:65-66).   She believes that Appellant would not be able to testify\n\nin his own defense. (RR58:68). She testified that Appellant has “poor\n\nauditory memory” and poor reasoning skills. (RR58:70).\n\n     Short testified that Appellant sustained a brain injury in 1976.\n\n(RR58:71).\n\n     On cross-examination, Short conceded that Appellant testified in\n\n                                   211\n\fhis own defense after the Linwood incident in 1979, years after his\n\nbrain injury. (RR58:71-72). After his arrest for the instant offense,\n\nAppellant spoke with a detective and gave an alibi.31 (RR58:74-75). He\n\nalso gave a TV reporter his alibi. (RR58:76).           Short conceded that\n\nAppellant, if he testified in this case, could tell the jury his version of\n\nthe evidence (that he was not present at the scene of the crime, that the\n\nDNA exonerates him, and that there is no murder weapon). (RR58:86-\n\n88).\n\n                              The State’s Case\n\n       Dr. Kristi Compton, a clinical and forensic psychologist, was\n\nappointed by the trial court to evaluate Appellant’s competency to stand\n\ntrial. (RR58:92-93). Dr. Compton evaluated Appellant on July 3, 2014\n\nat the Dallas County Jail. (RR58:94-95).           Over the course of three\n\nhours, she interviewed and tested Appellant. (RR58:94; SX1-2).            She\n\nadministered the Test of Memory Malingering (“TOMM”), an effort test.\n\n(RR58:99). Appellant was required to look at a series of 50 pictures,\n\nthen identify what he saw.        (RR58:99-100).     A person with normal\n\nintellect would correctly identify 45 of the 50 pictures. (RR58:99-100).\n\n31According to Short, Appellant maintains that he did not meet with detectives.\n(RR58:73-76),\n                                      212\n\fAn individual with intellectual disability will generally identify 30\n\ncorrectly.   (RR58:101).    A score of 25 or below is indicative of overt\n\nmalingering. (RR58:101).       Appellant was administered two trials; he\n\ncorrectly identified 24 out of 50 on the first and 26 out of 50 on the\n\nsecond. (RR58:102). His scores reflected that “he was not putting forth\n\nthe full effort during the evaluation[.]” (RR58:102).\n\n        Dr. Compton also administered the Kaufman Brief Intelligence\n\nTest.     (RR58:97, 103).    Appellant obtained a full-scale IQ of 40.\n\n(RR58:104). A person taking this test gets 40 points just for showing\n\nup.     (RR58:104).   Someone with a 40 IQ “would not be able to\n\ncommunicate.” (RR58:105). “[I]t’s very, very unlikely [a person with a\n\n40 IQ] would be able to communicate in full sentences or understand\n\nmuch beyond that of a three- to four-year-old child.”         (RR58:105).\n\nAppellant’s score was inconsistent with his previous scores, which\n\n“indicate a range between high 60s to low 70s.” (RR58:105).\n\n        Dr. Compton administered the CAST-MR, a test to evaluate\n\ncompetency-related abilities in an individual with low intellect.\n\n(RR58:109). In the Basic Legal Concepts section of this test, the mean\n\nnumber of correct responses for individuals who are incompetent is 13.\n\n\n                                     213\n\f(RR58:110). Appellant answered no questions correctly. (RR58:110).\n\nOn the Skills to Assist Defense Section, the mean number of correct\n\nresponses for individuals with intellectual disability is 8, with an SEM\n\nof 3. (RR58:111). Appellant scored a 5, which is “somewhere within the\n\nrange” of those with intellectual disability. (RR58:111).           When asked\n\nfor spontaneous recall of the roles of the parties (unlike the structured\n\nquestion-and-answer),       Appellant     answered     all   of   the   questions\n\nsufficiently. (RR58:111).\n\n      Appellant correctly described the roles of the parties: the defense\n\nattorneys; prosecutor; and, judge.32 (RR58:106). He understands that\n\nhe has been convicted, that the upcoming trial concerns punishment,\n\nand that there are two possible sentences. (RR58:107-08). Appellant’s\n\nresponses were inconsistent with a 40-point IQ. (RR58:107). According\n\nto Dr. Compton, Appellant “responded to [her] rationally and logically\n\nand processed what [she] was asking, and responded accordingly.”\n\n(RR58:107). And, “there’s no identifiable nexus between mental illness\n\nand [Appellant’s] ability to consistently engage with counsel.”\n\n(RR58:109).       Dr. Compton ranked Appellant’s abilities as follows:\n32 Appellant indicated that he knew a judge is supposed to ensure a fair trial, but\ntold Dr. Compton that they do not. (RR58:106). There was no evidence of a nexus\nbetween this belief and Appellant’s mental state. (RR58:107).\n                                        214\n\fability to disclose facts and events to counsel-below average; ability to\n\nengage in a reasoned choice of legal strategies-below average; ability to\n\ntestify and cross-examine witnesses-below average; ability to assist\n\ncounsel with a defense-below average. (RR58:128-29).\n\n     Throughout the evaluation, Appellant was cooperative with Dr.\n\nCompton.      (RR58:113).   He “related spontaneously” and made eye\n\ncontact. His hygiene was good. (RR58:113).\n\n     Dr. Compton testified that Appellant “functions in the borderline\n\nto mental/mild mental retardation.” (RR58:114).       She did not know\n\nwhere in the range “because [she did] not do adaptive deficits.”\n\n(RR58:114). She did not identify a clinical disorder such as depression,\n\nmania, bipolar disorder, or intense anxiety. (RR58:114). She did not\n\nobserve that he was overtly psychotic or responding to hallucinations.\n\n(RR58:114).    He does, however, have subclinical paranoid delusions\n\nabout being framed and about the lack of a weapon.           (RR58:115).\n\nSomeone with a clinical delusion cannot remove himself from his\n\ndelusion. (RR58:126). Someone with a subclinical delusion is capable of\n\nrecognizing other possibilities. (RR58:126).     Appellant’s subclinical\n\ndelusions are not sufficient to impair his competency status.\n\n\n                                   215\n\f(RR58:116).\n\n      In Dr. Compton’s opinion, Appellant was competent to stand trial.\n\n(RR58:98). He has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyers\n\nwith a reasonable degree of rational understanding and has a rational,\n\nas well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\n\n(RR58:98).\n\n                                Applicable Law\n\n                                  Competency\n\n      “A defendant is presumed competent to stand trial and shall be\n\nfound competent to stand trial unless proved incompetent[.]” Tex. Code\n\nCrim. Proc. Ann. art. 46B.003(b) (West 2006).             A defendant is not\n\ncompetent to stand trial if he lacks:\n\n  (1) Sufficient present ability to consult with the person’s lawyer\n      with a reasonable degree of rational understanding; or\n\n  (2) A rational as well as factual understanding of the\n      proceedings against the person.\n\nId. art. 46B.003(a). Evidence relevant to the competency determination\n\nincludes whether the defendant can: (1) understand the charges against\n\nhim   and     the   potential   consequences   of   the    pending   criminal\n\nproceedings; (2) disclose to counsel pertinent facts, events, and states of\n\n\n                                     216\n\fmind; (3) engage in a reasoned choice of legal strategies and options; (4)\n\nunderstand the adversarial nature of criminal proceedings; (5) exhibit\n\nappropriate courtroom behavior; and, (6) testify. See Tex. Code Crim.\n\nProc. Ann art. 46B.024(1) (West Supp. 2015).\n\n     The burden is on the defendant to prove incompetency by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence. Id. art. 46B.003(b).\n\n                            Legal Sufficiency\n\n     A claim regarding a jury’s refusal to find a defendant incompetent\n\nto stand trial – a determination which he has the burden to prove – is\n\nsimilar to an affirmative defense. See Matlock v. State, 392 S.W.3d 662,\n\n671 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013).     An appellate court reviewing the legal\n\nsufficiency of an affirmative defense should assay the record for a\n\nscintilla of evidence favorable to the factfinder’s finding and disregard\n\nall evidence to the contrary unless a reasonable factfinder could not.\n\nButcher v. State, 454 S.W.3d 13, 20 (Tex. Crim. App. 2015) (citing\n\nMatlock, 392 S.W.3d at 669-70).\n\n                           Factual Sufficiency\n\n     The appellate standard of review for factual sufficiency regarding\n\na jury’s adverse finding on competency is whether the jury’s finding of\n\n\n                                   217\n\fcompetency is so against the great weight and preponderance of the\n\nevidence so as to be manifestly unjust. Meraz v. State, 785 S.W.2d 146,\n\n154-55 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990). The appellate court must consider all of\n\nthe relevant evidence and may not usurp the function of the jury by\n\nsubstituting its judgment in place of the jury's assessment of the weight\n\nand credibility of the witnesses’ testimony. Matlock, 392 S.W.3d at 671.\n\nThe defendant’s claim is sustained only if, after setting out the relevant\n\nevidence and explaining precisely how the contrary evidence greatly\n\noutweighs the evidence supporting the verdict, the court clearly states\n\nwhy the verdict is so much against the great weight of the evidence as\n\nto be manifestly unjust, conscience-shocking, or clearly biased. Id.\n\n                                   Analysis\n\n         Appellant has failed to properly brief the issues. He recites the\n\nevidence and the standard of review, however, he fails to offer any\n\nargument or authority in support of his claims.         See Tex. R. App. P.\n\n38.1(i).\n\n         Regardless, the evidence is both legally and factually sufficient to\n\nsupport the jury’s determination that Appellant was competent to stand\n\ntrial.\n\n\n                                      218\n\f                         Issue 40: Legal Sufficiency\n\n     A review of the record reveals more than a scintilla of evidence to\n\nsupport the jury’s finding. The following evidence supports the jury’s\n\nfinding of competency:\n\n      Appellant can be engaging and animated and can\n       participate in long conversations about faith. (RR58:65-\n       66).\n\n      He understands that he has been convicted, that the\n       upcoming trial concerns punishment, and that there are\n       two possible sentences. (RR57:181; RR58:107-08).\n\n      Appellant can articulate that his prior sentence was\n       “vacated” and his case “remanded” and can cite relevant\n       Supreme Court cases and “somewhat” describe the\n       difference between them. (RR58:25-26).\n\n      Appellant can relate his mental state, alleged offense,\n       and events related to this stage of his case. (RR58:125).\n\n      Appellant can correctly describe the roles of the parties:\n       the defense attorneys; prosecutor; and, judge. (RR57:187;\n       RR58:106).\n\n      Appellant can exhibit appropriate courtroom behavior.\n       (RR57:184).\n\n      If called to testify, Appellant could respond verbally to\n       questioning. (RR57:184). He could tell the jury his\n       version of the evidence, including his claim that he was\n       not present at the scene of the crime, that there is no\n       murder weapon, and that the DNA shows he is innocent.\n       (RR58:86-88).\n\n                                     219\n\f      According to Dr. Compton, “there’s no identifiable nexus\n       between mental illness and [Appellant’s] ability to\n       consistently engage with counsel.” (RR58:109).\n\n      Dr. Compton testified that Appellant “functions in the\n       borderline   to    mental/mild     mental      retardation.”\n       (RR58:114).     She did not know where in the range,\n       “because [she did] not do adaptive deficits.” (RR58:114).\n\n      Dr. Compton identified no clinical disorder such as\n       depression, mania, bipolar disorder, or intense anxiety.\n       (RR58:114). She did not observe that he was overtly\n       psychotic or responding to hallucinations. (RR58:114).\n\n      Appellant is not schizophrenic and does not respond to\n       outside voices or voices in his head. (RR58:6).\n\n      Appellant is not on any psychoactive medications.\n       (RR58:41).\n\n     In short, the jury had substantial evidence from which it could\n\nhave concluded that Appellant had sufficient present ability to consult\n\nwith his lawyers with a reasonable degree of rational understanding\n\nand that he had a rational as well as factual understanding of the\n\nproceedings against him. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art.\n\n46B.003(a).   Appellant did not conclusively prove that he was\n\nincompetent. The jury was entitled to believe Dr. Compton’s testimony\n\nthat Appellant was competent to stand trial. (RR58:98).\n\n\n                                   220\n\f     Issue 40 should be overruled.\n\n                     Issue 41: Factual Sufficiency\n\n     The evidence is factually sufficient to support the jury’s\n\ndetermination that Appellant was competent to stand trial.         The\n\nfollowing evidence, when considered in a neutral light, proves that the\n\njury’s finding that Appellant was competent to stand trial was not\n\nagainst the great weight and preponderance of the evidence:\n\n      Dr. McGarrahan testified that Appellant was not\n       competent to stand trial. (RR57:171-72).\n\n      Dr. Compton testified that Appellant was competent to\n       stand trial. (RR58:98). He had sufficient present ability\n       to consult with his lawyers with a reasonable degree of\n       rational understanding and had a rational, as well as\n       factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\n       (RR58:98).\n\n      Dr. McGarrahan testified that Appellant had a factual\n       (but not rational) understanding of the proceedings\n       against him. (RR57:181). He understood that his prior\n       sentence was “vacated” and his case “remanded.”\n       (RR58:24-25). In the upcoming trial, he wants a “harsher\n       sentence” so that he will have “more appeals.” (RR58:23).\n\n      Dr. Compton testified that Appellant understands that\n       he has been convicted, that the upcoming trial concerns\n       punishment, and that there are two possible sentences.\n       (RR58:107-08).\n\n      Appellant understands the adversarial nature of the\n\n                                     221\n\f  proceedings. (RR57:184). He understands the roles of the\n  parties: the defense attorneys; prosecutor; and, judge.\n  (RR58:106).\n\n Regarding the evidence against him, Appellant told Dr.\n  McGarrahan that the State “only [has] he said/she said.”\n  (RR58:18). He told her that the fingerprints at the scene\n  will not match him and the DNA testing “render[s] him\n  innocent.” (RR58:20-22).\n\n Dr. McGarrahan testified that Appellant is not able to\n  rationally assist his attorneys. (RR57:172). He persists\n  in his belief he cannot be convicted if the State does not\n  have the murder weapon. (RR57:172, 175).\n\n Short testified that that Appellant’s “fixed-false belief”\n  informs his decisions regarding the case. (RR58:59).\n\n Short did not believe that Appellant could make rational\n  choices regarding his legal strategies. (RR58:63). For\n  example, he did not want to be examined by the State’s\n  expert even though it would affect his lawyers’ ability to\n  present evidence gathered on his behalf. (RR58:63-65).).\n\n Dr. McGarrahan testified that if Appellant were to\n  testify, he could respond to questions and verbalize his\n  responses, but would have difficulty doing so in a\n  rational, logical manner. (RR57:184).\n\n Short testified that Appellant would not be able to testify\n  in his own defense but later conceded that if he did, he\n  could tell the jury his version of the evidence (that he was\n  not present at the scene of the crime, that the DNA\n  exonerates him, and that there is no murder weapon).\n  (RR58:68, 86-88).\n\n Dr. Compton testified that Appellant “responded to [her]\n\n                              222\n\f  rationally and logically and processed what [she] was\n  asking, and responded accordingly.” (RR58:107).\n\n According to Dr. Compton, there is “there’s no\n  identifiable nexus between mental illness and\n  [Appellant’s] ability to consistently engage with counsel.”\n  (RR58:109). “[E]ven a mentally ill defendant who resists\n  cooperating with his counsel may nevertheless be found\n  competent if the manifestations of his particular mental\n  illness are not shown to be the engine of his obstinacy.”\n  Turner v. State, 422 S.W.3d 676, 691 (Tex. Crim. App.\n  2013).\n\n Appellant can exhibit appropriate courtroom behavior.\n  (RR57:184).\n\n When tested by Dr. McGarrahan, Appellant put forth\n  good effort and tried to present himself in a positive light.\n  (RR57:174). Dr. McGarrahan’s testing showed a full scale\n  IQ of 71. (RR57:172).\n\n When tested by Dr. Compton, Appellant did not put forth\n  good effort. (RR58:102). Her IQ testing showed a full\n  scale IQ of 40, which is inconsistent with his prior scores.\n  Additionally, given the fact that someone with a 40-point\n  IQ would not be able to communicate, Appellant’s 40-\n  point IQ score was inconsistent with the fact that he was\n  able to communicate with her. (RR58:104-05). On the\n  CAST-MR, Appellant answered no questions correctly in\n  the Basic Legal Concepts section. (RR58:110). On the\n  Skills to Assist Defense Section, he scored within the\n  range of those with intellectual disability. (RR58:111).\n\n Dr. McGarrahan testified that Appellant is intellectually\n  disabled. (RR57:185).\n\n Dr. Compton testified that Appellant “functions in the\n\n                              223\n\f        borderline   to    mental/mild     mental      retardation.”\n        (RR58:114).     She did not know where in the range,\n        “because [she did] not do adaptive deficits.” (RR58:114).\n\n      Dr. McGarrahan testified that Appellant suffers from a\n       delusional disorder, but is not schizophrenic and does not\n       respond to outside voices or voices in his head.\n       (RR57:185; RR58:6).\n\n      Dr. Compton did not identify a clinical disorder such as\n       depression, mania, bipolar disorder, or intense anxiety.\n       (RR58:114). She did not observe that he was overtly\n       psychotic or responding to hallucinations. (RR58:114).\n       He has subclinical paranoid delusions but they are not\n       sufficient to impair his competency status. (RR58:116).\n\n      Appellant is not on any psychoactive medications.\n       (RR58:41).\n\n     The   jury    was   faced   with    conflicting   opinions   from   two\n\npsychologists.    On the one hand was Dr. McGarrahan, the defense\n\nexpert involved in the case for at least two years, who testified to her\n\nopinion that Appellant was incompetent. (RR57:166-67, 171-72). On\n\nthe other hand was Dr. Compton, the trial court’s neutral expert\n\nappointed only days before the competency trial, who testified to her\n\nopinion that Appellant was competent. (RR58:93-95, 98).\n\n     The jury was entitled to credit Dr. Compton’s testimony that\n\nAppellant was competent to stand trial. Dr. Compton was a neutral\n\n\n                                   224\n\fwitness who offered specific testimony regarding her testing and\n\nevaluation of Appellant and her opinion regarding his competency. Dr.\n\nCompton testified that Appellant’s belief in his innocence was “not\n\nsufficient to impair rational communication” with counsel. (RR58:108-\n\n09).   She testified that Appellant understood the charges against him;\n\nthat he was already convicted; that the upcoming trial concerned\n\npunishment only; and the potential punishments. (RR58:107-08, 136).\n\nSee Morris v. State, 301 S.W.3d 281, 291 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009)\n\n(agreeing with lower court holding that Morris’ jury “was entitled to\n\ncredit the opinion testimony of the State’s experts that appellant was\n\ncompetent under art. 46B.003(a).”); see also Williams v. State, 191\n\nS.W.3d 242, 248 (Tex. App.—Austin 2006, no pet.) (stating that “[t]he\n\njury is the judge of the credibility of the witnesses at the competency\n\nhearing and the weight to give to the testimony.”). The fact that some\n\nevidence was presented that could support a finding of incompetency\n\ndoes not render the evidence insufficient. See Butcher, 454 S.W.3d at\n\n20.\n\n       On appeal, Appellant suggests that the reason he performed\n\npoorly on Dr. Compton’s tests was because he did not want to be found\n\n\n                                  225\n\fdisabled and because he thought the evaluation was meant to belittle\n\nand shame him. (Appellant’s Brief p. 118). Appellant’s argument lacks\n\nmerit. If, as Appellant suggests, he did not want to be found\n\nintellectually disabled, it would stand to reason that his scores would be\n\nhigher, reflecting increased effort. Instead, on Dr. Compton’s IQ test,\n\nAppellant’s score was so low that it was not only inconsistent with his\n\nprior IQ testing, but also inconsistent with the level that he was able to\n\ncommunicate with Dr. Compton. (RR58:104-05). On one trial of Dr.\n\nCompton’s malingering test, Appellant’s score was so low that it was\n\nindicative of overt malingering. (RR58:101-02). In any event, Appellant\n\nfails to explain how his lack of participation proves that he was\n\nincompetent to stand trial.\n\n         Appellant suggests that Dr. Compton’s opinion was not reliable\n\nbecause her appointment and evaluation took place only days before\n\ntrial; therefore, she “did not have the time to fully research [Appellant’s]\n\nchildhood, his brain injury, or his prison history.” (Appellant’s Brief\n\np.119). Appellant does not specify, however, how further research into\n\nthe identified areas would have shed light on his competency to stand\n\ntrial.\n\n\n                                    226\n\f       Given all of the testimony and evidence presented, the jury could\n\nhave weighed the conflicting evidence and reasonably found that\n\nAppellant was sufficiently capable of consulting with his attorneys and\n\nwith a reasonable degree of rational understanding and that he had a\n\nrational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against\n\nhim.    The jury's determination that Appellant was competent to stand\n\ntrial was not so against the great weight and preponderance of the\n\nevidence as to be manifestly unjust.\n\n        Issues 40 and 41 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S   RESPONSE TO ISSUE NO.        42:   THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY\nOVERRULED APPELLANT’S OBJECTION TO DR. PRICE’S TESTIMONY THAT\nAPPELLANT      EXHIBITS    TRAITS      CONSISTENT    WITH     ANTI-SOCIAL\nPERSONALITY DISORDER.\n\n\n        Appellant contends that, during the punishment phase of trial,\n\nthe trial court erred in overruling his objection to Dr. Price’s proffered\n\ntestimony that Appellant exhibits traits consistent with anti-social\n\npersonality disorder. In support of his contention, Appellant points to\n\nthe fact that Dr. Price did not diagnose Appellant with this disorder.\n\nAppellant’s contentions lack merit and should be overruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                    227\n\f                            Pertinent Facts\n\n       During a hearing outside the presence of the jury in the\n\npunishment phase of trial, Dr. Price testified that he planned to testify\n\nbefore the jury that Appellant exhibits traits consistent with anti-social\n\npersonality disorder. (RR69:8).    Dr. Price testified, however, that he\n\nwould not diagnose Appellant with anti-social personality disorder\n\nbecause he is not aware of any evidence of a conduct disorder prior to\n\nthe age of 15. (RR69:8). At the conclusion of the hearing, Appellant\n\nobjected that Dr. Price’s testimony would be inadmissible under Rule\n\n403. (RR69:11). Defense counsel objected as follows:\n\n     Your Honor, I do have - - I will object to him testifying in\n     front of the jury about him having the traits of someone\n     with anti-social personality disorder, since he can’t make\n     that diagnosis. I think, because he’s an expert, he gives\n     that inference to the jury. I think it’s dangerous testimony\n     put in front of them, when he can’t even make the diagnosis\n     himself.\n\n     So I would object to him testifying that he has those traits,\n     without being able to make the diagnosis. Even if the Court\n     thinks it’s relevant somehow, I just think that the\n     prejudicial effect outweighs the probative value, in the way\n     he’s going to present it.\n\n\n\n\n                                   228\n\f(RR69:11).   The trial court overruled Appellant’s objection. (RR69:12-\n\n13).\n\n       Before the jury, Dr. Price testified that anti-social personality\n\ndisorder is not a mental disorder, but a long-term personality disorder.\n\n(RR69:66-67).   An individual with this disorder is “kind of against\n\nsociety. It’s an individual who breaks the rules, breaks the law, [and]\n\ndoesn’t accept responsibility for it.” (RR69:67). One requirement for a\n\ndiagnosis of anti-social personality disorder is evidence of a conduct\n\ndisorder prior to the age of 15. (RR69:67-68).    A child with a conduct\n\ndisorder “gets in trouble all the time, skips school, gets in trouble with\n\nthe law, sets fires, is aggressive towards others, et cetera.” (RR69:68).\n\nBased on his review of the case and his interaction with Appellant, Dr.\n\nPrice testified that Appellant “does have traits and features consistent\n\nwith this anti-social personality.” (RR69:68).    Appellant renewed his\n\nprior objection and it was overruled. (RR69:68). Dr. Price then briefly\n\nexplained the basis for his opinion. (RR69:69-72). Importantly, Dr.\n\nPrice testified that he lacked evidence regarding one of the traits\n\nnecessary for a diagnosis of anti-social personality disorder. (RR69:71).\n\n\n\n\n                                   229\n\fDr. Price lacked evidence that the traits began prior to 15 years of age.\n\n(RR69:71-72).\n\n       During cross-examination, defense counsel asked Dr. Price about\n\nhis opinion that Appellant exhibits traits consistent with anti-social\n\npersonality disorder. (RR69:87, 90). He pointed out on at least two\n\nseparate occasions that Dr. Price could not diagnose Appellant with the\n\ndisorder. (RR69:87, 90).\n\n                           Standard of Review\n\n     An appellate court reviews a trial court’s ruling on the\n\nadmissibility of evidence under an abuse of discretion standard of\n\nreview.   See Weatherred, 15 S.W.3d at 542. The trial court’s ruling\n\nshould be upheld if it is within the zone of reasonable disagreement. Id.\n\nAnd, it will be upheld if it is correct on any theory of law applicable to\n\nthe case. Romero v. State, 800 S.W.2d 539, 543 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990).\n\n                            Applicable Law\n\n                             Expert testimony\n\n       Rule 702 authorizes the admission of testimony from a witness\n\npossessing scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge if the\n\nwitness is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience,\n\n                                   230\n\ftraining, or education and his testimony will assist the fact finder to\n\nunderstand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. Tex. R. Evid.\n\n702.\n\n                                Rule 403\n\n       Under Rule 403, all relevant evidence is admissible unless “its\n\nprobative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more\n\nof the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the\n\njury, undue delay, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.” Tex.\n\nR. Evid. 403. All probative evidence proffered by an adverse party will\n\nbe prejudicial, but only unfair prejudice warrants exclusion of the\n\nevidence. See Montgomery v. State, 810 S.W.2d 372, 378 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1990) (citing United States v. Figueroa, 618 F.2d 934, 943 (2nd Cir.\n\n1980). A reviewing court’s consideration of this issue includes, but is\n\nnot limited to: (1) how probative the evidence is; (2) the potential of the\n\nevidence to impress the jury in some irrational, but nevertheless\n\nindelible way; (3) the time needed to develop the evidence; and (4) the\n\nproponent’s need for the evidence. Shuffield v. State, 189 S.W.3d 782,\n\n787 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006).\n\n\n\n\n                                    231\n\f                                Analysis\n\n                                Rule 702\n\n     As a threshold matter, it is unclear whether, at trial, Appellant\n\nintended to object to Dr. Price’s testimony under Rule 702. Defense\n\ncounsel’s statement that “I would object to him testifying that he has\n\nthose traits, without being able to make the diagnosis” is insufficient to\n\nalert the trial court that Dr. Price was unqualified or that his opinion\n\nwas in some way irrelevant or unreliable.       As a result, he has not\n\npreserved this argument for review. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a).\n\n     On appeal, Appellant states that “the testimony was beyond the\n\nexpert’s discipline to opine on the subject[.]” (Appellant’s Brief p.121).\n\nHe cites Kelly v. State, 824 S.W.2d 568 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992), Nenno v.\n\nState, 970 S.W.2d 549 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998), and Texas Rule of\n\nEvidence 702, but offers no further argument or analysis. This Court is\n\nnot required to make Appellant’s case for him. Garcia, 887 S.W.2d at\n\n882 (stating that a reviewing court “will not brief appellant’s case for\n\nhim”).   To the extent Appellant is suggesting that a psychologist is\n\nunable to testify that, based on his review of documents, an individual\n\nis symptomatic of a specific condition, he points to no authority in\n\n                                   232\n\fsupport of his claims. He points to no authority suggesting that such\n\ntestimony is prohibited in that profession.\n\n     In any event, any complaint Appellant had regarding Dr. Price’s\n\nqualifications was waived at the time of trial.   During the sub rosa\n\nhearing prior to Dr. Price’s testimony before the jury, the following\n\nexchange occurred:\n\n     [State]: Judge, I believe, as we have done with Dr.\n     McGarrahan, I believe Dr. Hom and Dr. Crowder, I don’t\n     anticipate objections from Defense that Dr. Price is an\n     expert who is qualified to give certain opinions. I believe\n     that’s the agreement that we have from Mr. Sanchez.\n\n     [Sanchez]: That’s correct, Your Honor.\n\n     [Trial Court]: Very well.\n\n     [State]: So this will be just me - - I will tender him as an\n     expert at this point.\n\n     [Trial Court]: Very well.\n\n     [State]: And then we’ll ask what his opinions are, and we’ll\n     go from there.\n\n(RR68:241-42). The parties agreed that Dr. Price was, in fact, an expert\n\nand the only issue to be addressed was the basis for his opinions. See\n\nTex. R. Evid. 705(b) (stating that an adverse party is entitled to\n\n                                   233\n\fquestion an expert outside the presence of the jury regarding the facts\n\nor data underlying the expert’s opinion).    Appellant did not challenge\n\nDr. Price’s qualifications at the time of trial and he cannot do so for the\n\nfirst time on appeal. Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a).\n\n       Appellant argues that Dr. Price’s testimony was “misleading and\n\ndesigned to give the jury the impression that Appellant had a diagnosed\n\nanti-social personality disorder[.]” (Appellant’s Brief pp.120-21). This\n\nis incorrect. In fact, Dr. Price was upfront about the limitations of his\n\ntestimony. He testified that Appellant “does have traits and features\n\nconsistent with” anti-social personality disorder, but he lacked evidence\n\nof one of the features required to render a diagnosis: evidence that the\n\nsymptoms began before 15 years of age.       (RR69:68, 71-72). On cross-\n\nexamination, he agreed with defense counsel on two separate occasions\n\nthat he could not diagnose Appellant with anti-social personality\n\ndisorder. (RR69:87, 90). The jury was not misled in any way.\n\n                                Rule 403\n\n        At trial, Appellant objected to Dr. Price’s testimony under Rule\n\n403.   Defense counsel stated “that the prejudicial effect outweighs the\n\nprobative value, in the way he’s going to present it.” (RR69:11).   In his\n\n\n                                    234\n\fbrief on appeal, Appellant states that “any probative value was\n\noutweighed by the prejudicial effect.”     (Appellant’s Brief p.121).     As\n\nabove, he offers no argument or analysis on this issue; therefore,\n\nnothing is presented for this Court’s review. See Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(i)\n\n(requiring that a brief contain a clear and concise argument for the\n\ncontentions made, with appropriate citations to authorities and to the\n\nrecord); see, e.g., Walder v. State, 85 S.W.3d 824, 827 (Tex. App.—Waco\n\n2002, no pet.) (setting forth the elements necessary to satisfy the\n\nmandatory requirement of a “clear and concise argument” pursuant to\n\nRule 38.1).\n\n       Regardless, the probative value of Dr. Price’s testimony was not\n\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. First, Dr.\n\nPrice’s testimony was relevant to rebut Appellant’s claim that he is\n\nintellectually disabled. His testimony was presented during the State’s\n\ncase-in-rebuttal to offer an alternate explanation for Dr. McGarrahan’s\n\ntestimony regarding Appellant’s symptoms. As such, his testimony was\n\nhighly probative to rebut the evidence that the defense presented.\n\n       Dr.    Price’s   testimony   was   also   relevant   to   the   jury’s\n\ndetermination of Appellant’s future dangerousness.          See Griffith v.\n\n\n                                    235\n\fState, 983 S.W.2d 282, 288 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998) (potential of future\n\ndangerousness is a question of fact which the jury must answer and\n\ntestimony   from    mental    health     experts     is relevant to     future\n\ndangerousness special issue); see Powell v. State, 898 S.W.2d 821, 830\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1994) (trial court has wide discretion in admitting\n\nevidence relevant to the jury’s determination of a capital murder\n\ndefendant’s death-worthiness).\n\n       Second, there was no chance that the evidence would impress\n\nthe jury in some irrational and indelible way.     While Dr. Price testified\n\nthat Appellant exhibits traits consistent with antisocial personality\n\ndisorder, he was clear that he could not diagnose Appellant with the\n\ndisorder. (RR69: 68, 71-72, 90).\n\n       Third, Dr. Price’s testimony regarding antisocial personality\n\ndisorder, which was presented during the State’s case-in-rebuttal, was\n\nextremely brief. The State’s questioning on this subject consumed less\n\nthan seven pages of transcript. (RR69:16, 66-72).\n\n       Finally, the State needed Dr. Price’s testimony to rebut Dr.\n\nMcGarrahan’s    testimony    regarding   Appellant’s     alleged      adaptive\n\n\n\n\n                                   236\n\fdeficits.   Dr. Price’s testimony offered an alternate explanation for\n\nwhat Dr. McGarrahan testified were Appellant’s adaptive deficits.\n\n        Even if the trial court erred in overruling Appellant’s objections\n\n(which the State does not concede), any alleged error is harmless. Error\n\nin the admission of evidence is non-constitutional error and must be\n\ndisregarded unless the error affects a defendant’s substantial rights.\n\nSee Tex. R. Evid. 103; Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b); Walters v. State, 247\n\nS.W.3d 204, 218-19 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). “[S]ubstantial rights are not\n\naffected by the erroneous admission of evidence if the appellate court,\n\nafter examining the record as a whole, has fair assurance that the error\n\ndid not influence the jury, or had but a slight effect.” Solomon v. State,\n\n49 S.W.3d 356, 365 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n      Examining the record as a whole, it is clear that any error in the\n\ntrial court’s ruling did not have a substantial and injurious effect or\n\ninfluence on the jury.   Dr. Price testified that someone with antisocial\n\npersonality disorder “breaks the rules, breaks the law, doesn’t accept\n\nresponsibility for it.” (RR69:67). That Appellant was one who breaks\n\nrules and laws was already well known to the jury.       By the time Dr.\n\n\n                                    237\n\fPrice testified, the jury already knew that Appellant broke into the\n\nFinch home, stabbed Mildred and Fred to death, and then stole\n\nnumerous items from Fred’s wardrobe.        The jury already knew that\n\nAppellant had stabbed Linwood in the head with a screwdriver. The\n\njury already knew about Appellant’s misconduct in prison.       Dr. Price’s\n\ntestimony had no negative impact on Appellant. Any alleged error did\n\nnot affect Appellant’s substantial rights. See Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b).\n\n     Issues 42 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S   RESPONSE TO ISSUE    43:   DR. PRICE DID NOT TESTIFY BEFORE\nTHE JURY REGARDING APPELLANT’S REMORSE.\n\n\n       Appellant contends that the trial court erred in allowing Dr.\n\nPrice to testify regarding his lack of remorse. Appellant’s contentions\n\nlack merit.\n\n                            Pertinent Facts\n\n       During a sub rosa hearing, Dr. Price was asked for the basis of\n\nhis opinion that Appellant exhibits traits of anti-social personality\n\ndisorder. (RR69:7). He responded as follows:\n\n     Criminal history, his history; especially, prior to 2010, and\n     as far back as 1979, which indicates a repeated pattern of\n     violation of the law; a lack of remorse for those incidents;\n     deceitfulness by repeated lying through the record, both in\n\n                                     238\n\f     response to the offenses and in talking to individuals in\n     prison and others that have evaluated him; at least, a\n     history or irritability and aggressiveness.\n\n(RR69:8). At the conclusion of the hearing, Appellant objected to this\n\ntestimony and complained that it would “violate the Defendant’s Fifth\n\nAmendment right[.]”      (RR69:13).        The objection was overruled.\n\n(RR69:13).\n\n                           Applicable Law\n\n     A reference to a defendant’s lack of remorse is tantamount to a\n\ncomment on his failure to testify. Howard v. State, 153 S.W.3d 382, 385\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2004). The law does not prohibit such a reference\n\nwhere it is supported by record evidence. Id. Consequently, the State is\n\nnot barred from presenting evidence that the accused has demonstrated\n\nby his words or actions a lack of remorse. See, e.g., id. (prosecutor’s\n\ncomment on lack of remorse supported by accused’s statement to officer\n\nthat he had no remorse for crime).\n\n                               Analysis\n\n     Appellant has failed to properly brief this issue. See Tex. R. App.\n\nP. 38.1(i). Importantly, Appellant does not specify where in Dr. Price’s\n\ntestimony before the jury that he refers to Appellant’s lack of remorse.\n\n                                     239\n\fThe State is unable to locate any exchange before the jury wherein Dr.\n\nPrice refers to Appellant’s remorse. Additionally, beyond the statement\n\nthat the unspecified error “violated Appellant’s right to remain silent\n\nand is of constitutional error dimension [and] denied Appellant a fair\n\npunishment hearing,” Appellant offers no argument or analysis.        He\n\ndoes not explain how Dr. Price’s testimony violated his right to remain\n\nsilent. This Court is not required to make Appellant’s case for him.\n\nGarcia, 887 S.W.2d at 882.\n\n       Issue 43 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S   RESPONSE TO ISSUE    44:    THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR IN\nADMITTING A SILHOUETTE OF A KNIFE AS A DEMONSTRATIVE AID.\n\n\n       Appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nobjection to State’s Exhibit #206, a PowerPoint presentation, which\n\ndepicts silhouettes of a single edged blade, because it was speculative.\n\nAppellant points to the fact that the purported murder weapon was\n\nnever introduced into evidence. Appellant’s contentions lack merit.\n\n                             Pertinent Facts\n\n       State’s Exhibit #206 is a PowerPoint presentation that the State\n\nand the medical examiner, Dr. Edward McDonough, compiled to assist\n\n\n                                     240\n\fthe doctor in his testimony regarding the autopsy on Mildred. It was\n\nadmitted over Appellant’s objection for record purposes only. (RR61:49).\n\nAppellant’s objection related to two slides of the exhibit, slides 2 and 5.\n\nSlide 2, entitled, “Stab Wound – Single Edge Blade Characteristics,”\n\ncontains a computer generated image of a single edged knife next to\n\nState’s Exhibit #63, a photograph of one of Mildred’s stab wounds.\n\n(SX206). Slide 5, entitled, “Stab Wound Depth Analysis,” depicts three\n\nsilhouettes that correspond to wounds of various depths. (SX206).\n\n        In a hearing outside the presence of the jury, Appellant objected\n\nto State’s Exhibit #206.33 (RR69:11). He stated the following:\n\n      One thing further, Your Honor. I think the State, as part of\n      their presentation with the medical examiner, will have a\n      PowerPoint which shows a silhouette of a knife next to the\n      pictures. I would object to that as speculative. Especially\n      since there is no knife that’s ever been introduced into\n      evidence.\n\n      For example, this (indicating).      I think it would be\n      misleading to the jury that that’s the way the knife looked,\n      when there’s no evidence in any way that there’s - - a knife\n      like that was ever used.\n\n\n33On appeal, Appellant refers to State’s Exhibit #205. This exhibit is a penitentiary\npack. (SX205). The State believes Appellant is actually referring to State’s Exhibit\n#206, which includes photographs from Mildred’s autopsy along with a silhouette of\na single edge blade. (SX206).\n                                        241\n\f(RR61:11). The State responded that it was offering the exhibit purely\n\nas a demonstrative aid. (RR61:11). “The purpose of this picture is to\n\nshow there’s a sharp edge and dull edge and how a knife like that might\n\nbe - - is consistent with causing a wound like we see in State’s Exhibit\n\nNumber 63[.]” (RR61:11). The photograph will “show the jury why it is\n\nthat this medical examiner will give the opinion that this is consistent\n\nwith a single-edge knife.”     (RR61:12).   The trial court overruled\n\nAppellant’s objection.    (RR61:12).    The exhibit was subsequently\n\nadmitted and utilized by him to explain his autopsy findings.\n\n       In particular, Dr. McDonough testified that Mildred “had\n\nextensive sharp-force trauma over almost all the surfaces of her body.”\n\n(RR61:54).    He explained that as part of an autopsy, the medical\n\nexaminer examines sharp-force wounds in an effort to determine “what\n\nthe weapon might be, possibly the length of the weapon, the width of\n\nthe blade[.]” (RR61:56-57). The examiner looks at the features of the\n\nwound, including the edges, where “[t]here might be a sharp edge and\n\nblunt edge.” (RR61:56).    The features of the wound may suggest the\n\ntype of knife used. (RR61:56, 60-61).    In the instant case, he opined\n\nthat Mildred’s and Fred’s wounds were consistent with a single edged\n\n\n                                  242\n\fblade. (RR61:58).      Dr. McDonough acknowledged, however, that he\n\nwas never presented with a knife to examine or compare to Mildred’s\n\nwounds. (RR61:57).\n\n                          Standard of Review\n\n      An   appellate   court    reviews   a   trial   court’s   admission   of\n\ndemonstrative evidence for an abuse of discretion.          See Simmons v.\n\nState, 622 S.W.2d 111, 113 (Tex. Crim. App. 1981).\n\n                               Applicable Law\n\n      Demonstrative evidence is evidence admitted to serve as a visual\n\naid or illustration of a witness’ testimony. Baker v. State, 177 S.W.3d\n\n113, 123 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2005, no pet.). It is admissible\n\nif it tends to solve some issue in the case and is relevant to the cause.\n\nSee Simmons, 622 S.W.2d at 113. An item of demonstrative evidence\n\nmust be properly identified by showing that the item in question is\n\nwhat its proponent claims as opposed to any idea of speculation,\n\nconjecture, or presumption of what the exhibit represents. Torres v.\n\nState, 116 S.W.3d 208, 213 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2003, no pet.) (citing\n\nVollbaum v. State, 833 S.W.2d 652, 657 (Tex. App.—Waco 1992, pet.\n\nref'd)).\n\n\n                                    243\n\f                                Analysis\n\n        The trial court did not err is overruling Appellant’s objection to\n\nthe State’s use of a computer-generated silhouette of a generic single\n\nedged knife as a demonstrative aid during the medical examiner’s\n\ntestimony. As an initial matter, the silhouette of the knife was properly\n\nidentified. Torres, 116 S.W.3d at 213. Dr. McDonough agreed that the\n\nslide entitled “Stab Wound – Single Edge Blade Characteristics”\n\ncontained a diagram of a knife. (RR61:57).       As to the slide entitled\n\n“Stab Wound Depth Analysis,” he agreed that it explained “different\n\ndepths wounds [sic]” that a single knife may create. (RR61:60).\n\n        The silhouette of the knife was relevant as it helped the medical\n\nexaminer to explain the nature and cause of the injuries that resulted\n\nin Mildred’s death.    The silhouette assisted the jury in understanding\n\nDr. McDonough’s testimony regarding Mildred’s wounds.         Contrary to\n\nthe statements in Appellant’s brief, the silhouette was not speculative.\n\nThe silhouette on Slide 2 depicted a single-edged knife, the same type of\n\nknife   that   Dr.   McDonough believed caused Mildred’s wounds.\n\n(RR61:57-58). The silhouette on Slide 5 showed that a single knife may\n\ncause wounds of different depths. (RR61:60).\n\n\n                                    244\n\f       Importantly, the State did not present the silhouette of the knife\n\nas an image of the weapon that was actually used in the instant offense.\n\nIndeed, the State clarified with Dr. McDonough the fact that he had\n\nnever “seen a knife [and had] never been presented a knife to examine”\n\nin connection with Mildred’s autopsy. (RR61:57). On cross-examination,\n\nDr. McDonough agreed that although he had testified to what the knife\n\nmay look like, he could not testify to a scientific certainty what the knife\n\nlooked like or how long it was. (RR61:90-91). See Simmons, 622 S.W.2d\n\nat 113-14 (finding no abuse of discretion in overruling Simmons’\n\nobjection to the State’s display to the jury of a “similar-type [of] knife”\n\nas that used during the commission of the offense).\n\n     On appeal, Appellant argues that the silhouette of the knife was\n\nalso inadmissible under Rule 403. (Appellant’s Brief pp.122-23). He did\n\nnot object on this basis at trial; he only objected on the basis of\n\nspeculation. (RR61:11). As such, Appellant failed to preserve his Rule\n\n403 objection for this Court’s review. See Guevara, 97 S.W.3d at 583.\n\n       Regardless, the probative value of the silhouette was not\n\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. See Tex. R.\n\nEvid. 403. As stated, the silhouette was probative of the nature of the\n\n\n                                    245\n\fweapon used to inflict Mildred’s fatal injuries. The silhouette was used\n\nto demonstrate the type of blade that may have inflicted Mildred’s\n\nwounds and to demonstrate how a single blade could create different\n\nwounds of varying depth.      The potential for the silhouette to impress\n\nthe jury in an irrational way was low given Dr. McDonough’s\n\nacknowledgement that he was never presented with a particular knife\n\nto examine or compare with Mildred’s wounds and that he could not\n\ntestify to a scientific certainty what the murder weapon actually looked\n\nlike.   At a minimum, the trial court’s decision falls within the zone of\n\nreasonable disagreement. See Weatherred, 15 S.W.3d at 542.\n\n        Even if this Court finds that the trial court erred in allowing the\n\nState to use the silhouette as a demonstrative aid, any alleged error is\n\nharmless as it did not have a substantial and injurious effect or\n\ninfluence on the jury.    The complained-of exhibit was offered during\n\ntestimony by the medical examiner during the punishment phase of\n\ntrial. The fact that Appellant stabbed Mildred to death was previously\n\ndetermined by another jury. Dr. McDonough simply described for the\n\nnew jury Mildred’s cause of death and the nature and extent of her\n\ninjuries.   The complained-of silhouette was used during his testimony\n\n\n                                    246\n\fsimply to help the jury understand the type of weapon that caused her\n\nwounds. There was no attempt to mislead the jury to believe that the\n\nsilhouette was an exact replica of the actual murder weapon. And there\n\nwas no dispute that a sharp, blade-like object was used or the lethal\n\nnature of the wounds it inflicted.      Accordingly, the silhouette of the\n\nknife did not affect Appellant’s substantial rights. See Tex. R. App. P.\n\n44.2(b).\n\n       Issue 44 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE 45: THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY ADMITTED\nTHE AUTOPSY PHOTOGRAPHS. ALTERNATIVELY, ANY ERROR IS HARMLESS.\n\n\n       Appellant contends that the trial court should have excluded all\n\nof the autopsy photographs offered by the State under evidence rule\n\n403. Appellant’s contention appears to be that the probative value of\n\nthe photographs was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n\nAppellant’s contentions lack merit.\n\n                           Pertinent Facts\n\n       In a sub rosa hearing, Appellant objected under Rule 403 to\n\nautopsy photographs of Mildred and Fred “being shown to the jury.”\n\n(RR61:8-9).   The color photographs were the exact photographs\n\nadmitted in the guilt phase of Appellant’s prior 1986 trial. The trial\n                                      247\n\fcourt had rejected a rule 403 objection to their admission back then,\n\nfinding that the probative value was not outweighed by the danger of\n\nany unfair prejudice. (RR61:9).       The State re-offered all twenty-four\n\npreviously admitted autopsy photographs - - fourteen from Mildred’s\n\nautopsy and ten from Fred’s autopsy.           (RR61:9-10).   The prosecutor\n\nstated:\n\n     They are grouped in a manner that is consistent with their\n     grouping of the injuries that show the injuries, the knife\n     wounds, the point of entry, why those points of entry can be\n     seen as being consistent with a single-edge knife. [The\n     medical examiner] will talk about the location of those\n     injuries and how - - especially with Mildred - - those might\n     relate to the fractured ribs that she sustained.\n\n          ...\n\n     There’s probably, I think, 25 [sic] pictures. But that’s\n     because there were a lot of stab wounds that were inflicted\n     upon these two folks.\n\n(RR61:10). Importantly, the 24 photographs offered were only “a small\n\n- - a portion of the total pictures that were taken.” (RR61:11).\n\n          Appellant’s   objection   was     overruled.   (RR61:11).     The\n\nphotographs were admitted during Dr. McDonough’s testimony.\n\n(RR61:48-49).\n\n\n                                      248\n\f                                 Analysis\n\n          The trial court did not err in admitting the 24 autopsy\n\nphotographs over Appellant’s 403 objection.     All 24 photographs were\n\nhighly probative of Mildred and Fred’s injuries; they show the external\n\ninjuries - - stab wounds, cuts, contusions - - that Mildred and Fred\n\nsuffered as a result of the instant offense. The photographs were used\n\nby Dr. McDonough to explain those injuries. (RR61:57, 61-65, 67-74,\n\n78-83).     This Court has held that a trial court does not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in admitting autopsy photographs over a Rule 403 objection\n\nwhere they help to explain the medical examiner’s testimony describing\n\nthe victim’s various wounds for which appellant is responsible.     See\n\nEscamilla, 143 S.W.3d at 826. Given the nature and extent of Mildred\n\nand Fred’s injuries – the sheer volume of stab wounds – the\n\nphotographs were especially important to help the jury understand the\n\nbrutal nature of the offense.\n\n          Furthermore, the 24 complained-of photographs are not unfairly\n\nprejudicial under Rule 403. The photographs are not repetitious; each\n\ndepicts a different area of injury:\n\n\n\n\n                                      249\n\f State’s Exhibit #76, the autopsy identification\n  photograph, is a close up of Mildred’s face.\n  (RR61:63-64; SX76).\n\n State’s Exhibit #79 is a close-up of a large cut to\n  Mildred’s scalp.

See\n\nSantellan v. State, 939 S.W.2d 155, 172-73 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997)\n\n(finding no error in admitting photographs of victim’s naked body\n\nduring autopsy where the photographs show damage done to victim’s\n\n\n\n                                  252\n\fbody by Santellan and no damage attributable to the autopsy is\n\napparent).\n\n      Appellant complains that the prosecutor and Dr. McDonough\n\ncommented that the photographs were “gruesome.” (RR61:61). The\n\nphotographs are gruesome, but they depict nothing more than the\n\ninjuries that Appellant inflicted on Mildred and Fred.        See Ladd, 3\n\nS.W.3d at 568 (holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin admitting photographs of the victim’s body, including autopsy photos,\n\nbecause the photographs depicted the manner of death and were no\n\nmore gruesome than the crime). Notably, Dr. McDonough’s testimony\n\nregarding the photographs consisted of only twenty pages in an\n\notherwise extremely lengthy record. (RR61:57, 61-65, 67-74, 78-83).\n\n      The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted the\n\n24 autopsy photographs. At a minimum, its decision falls within the\n\nzone of reasonable disagreement. See Weatherred, 15 S.W.3d at 542.\n\n                     Any Alleged Error is Harmless\n\n      Even if the trial court erred in admitting the 24 complained-of\n\nphotographs, Appellant was not harmed. As previously argued, there\n\nwas   overwhelming    evidence   supporting   the    jury’s   verdict   on\n\n\n                                  253\n\fpunishment regardless of the photographs of Mildred and Fred.        Even\n\nwithout the photographs, the jury heard evidence that Mildred was\n\nstabbed 90 times. The jury heard evidence of Appellant’s history of\n\nviolence both in and out of prison. Accordingly, taking the entire record\n\ninto consideration, it is clear that any alleged error in admitting the\n\ncomplained-of photographs clearly did not affect Appellant’s substantial\n\nrights and should be disregarded. See Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b).\n\n     Issues 45 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S   RESPONSE TO ISSUE    46:    THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR IN\nOVERRULING APPELLANT’S OBJECTION TO THE TESTIMONY OF JAMES\nBELT, SR.\n\n\n       Appellant contends that the trial court should have excluded the\n\ntestimony of Mildred and Fred’s son-in-law, James Belt.          He claims\n\nBelt’s testimony was not admissible as victim impact testimony.\n\nFurthermore, he claims under Rule 403 that any probative value it had\n\nwas outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Appellant preserved\n\nhis complaints at trial, but the court acted within its discretion in\n\noverruling them.\n\n\n\n\n                                     254\n\f                            Pertinent Facts\n\n       During it’s case-in-rebuttal, the State called Mildred and Fred’s\n\nson-in-law, James Belt, to testify. (RR68:212). Appellant objected that\n\nBelt was not Mildred and Fred’s child. (RR68:218). He objected to the\n\nfact that Belt would testify as to the effect of the offense on his wife,\n\nMildred and Fred’s daughter, Molly, as well as Mildred and Fred’s\n\ngrandchildren, Melanie and James III.         (RR68:212-13, 216).     He\n\nobjected that the defense would not be able to cross-examine Molly.\n\n(RR68:212-13, 216).     Appellant also objected to the testimony under\n\nRule 403. (RR68:214).\n\n       Before the jury, Belt testified that he is married to Mildred and\n\nFred’s only child, Molly.   (RR68:220-21).    Belt and Molly have two\n\nchildren, Melanie and James III.     (RR68:226).   Fred and Belt, both\n\nlawyers, shared an office close to Rose Lane. (RR68:229). Belt testified\n\nthat Fred was more than just a father-in-law; “he was everything to\n\n[Belt].” (RR68:235). Belt had a great deal of respect and admiration for\n\nMildred. (RR68:235).\n\n       Belt testified that even though decades have passed since the\n\noffense, “It comes back. [He] can’t shake it . . . It’s got [him] messed\n\n\n                                   255\n\fup.”   (RR68:236).    After the offense, Molly had to take a leave of\n\nabsence from work for a year. (RR68:237).       “Initially, she had anxiety\n\nattacks. She couldn’t really do anything. But, as time passes, she’s\n\ngotten a lot better . . . But she’s not whole.” (RR68:237).    The offense\n\naffected Melanie as well. Melanie “has never been able to stay in a\n\nhouse by herself.” (RR68:237). Melanie could not be left alone when\n\nshe was a child or after she left home to go off to college. (RR68:237).\n\n                            Applicable Law\n\n       Victim-impact evidence is “evidence concerning the effect the\n\nvictim’s death will have on others, particularly the victim’s family\n\nmembers.” Mosley v. State, 983 S.W.2d 249, 261 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998).\n\nVictim-character evidence is “evidence concerning good qualities\n\npossessed by the victim.” Id. Both types of evidence are admissible “in\n\nthe context of the mitigation special issue, to show the uniqueness of\n\nthe victim, the harm caused by the defendant, and as rebuttal to the\n\ndefendant’s mitigating evidence.” Id. at 262.\n\n       Victim-impact evidence “remind[s] the jury that murder has\n\nforeseeable consequences to the community and the victim’s survivors -\n\n- family members and friends who also suffer harm from murderous\n\n\n                                    256\n\fconduct.” Estrada v. State, 313 S.W.3d 274, 316 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010)\n\n(quoting Salazar v. State, 90 S.W.3d 330, 335 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002)).\n\nEvidence about the victim can be an important humanizing factor,\n\nmaking the victim more than just a faceless stranger before the jury,\n\nand is essential for just decision making in the penalty phase of a\n\ndeath-penalty trial. See Mosley, 983 S.W.2d at 261 (discussing Payne v.\n\nTennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 825 (1991)).\n\n     However, victim-impact evidence is subject to limitations. Victim-\n\nimpact evidence should be excluded under rule 403 if it predominantly\n\nencourages comparisons between the worthiness of the victim and the\n\nworthiness of the defendant. See Mosley, 983 S.W.3d at 262; Tex. R.\n\nEvid. 403. “When the focus of the evidence shifts from humanizing the\n\nvictim . . . to measuring the worth of the victim compared to other\n\nmembers of society[,] then the State exceeds the bounds of permissible\n\ntestimony.” Mosley, 983 S.W.3d at 262.\n\n     Trial courts should exercise sound discretion in permitting some\n\nvictim impact evidence while limiting the amount and scope of such\n\ntestimony.   See Estrada, 313 S.W.3d 315-16 (quoting Salazar, 90\n\nS.W.3d at 336).    Considerations in determining whether testimony\n\n\n                                   257\n\fshould be excluded under rule 403 include the nature of the testimony,\n\nthe relationship between the witness and the victim, the amount of\n\ntestimony to be introduced, and the availability of other testimony\n\nrelating to victim impact and character. See Mosley, 983 S.W.2d at 262.\n\n                               Analysis\n\n       It is the State’s position that Appellant has failed to properly\n\nbrief his complaint regarding the testimony of James Belt. Importantly,\n\nhe does not provide citations to the portion(s) of the record of Belt’s\n\ntestimony that he claims is inadmissible. See Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(i).\n\nThe State notes that Belt offered more than simply victim-impact\n\ntestimony. Belt was also a fact witness; he was the person who found\n\nMildred’s and Fred’s dead bodies. (RR68:228-29).\n\n       In any event, the trial court did not err in allowing Belt to\n\nprovide victim-impact testimony.     Belt’s testimony was relevant and\n\nprobative evidence that humanized Mildred and Fred.         Mosley, 983\n\nS.W.2d at 262. Belt provided a brief description for the jury of who this\n\nmarried couple was and the impact of the murders on their family.\n\nThere was nothing in Belt’s testimony that encouraged a comparison\n\nbetween Mildred and Fred and Appellant. As such, the trial court acted\n\n\n                                   258\n\fwithin its discretion in allowing Belt’s testimony during the State’s\n\ncase-in-rebuttal.\n\n       That Belt was Mildred and Fred’s son-in-law did not render\n\nBelt’s testimony inadmissible. See Mosley, 983 S.W.2d at 262 (stating,\n\n“[W]e do not believe that an absolute rule limiting testimony to family\n\nmembers within a certain degree of relationship is viable.”).    Although\n\nBelt was not Mildred and Fred’s son by birth, he was their son-in-law\n\nand the father of their grandchildren. It is clear from Belt’s testimony\n\nthat he enjoyed an extremely close relationship with Mildred and Fred,\n\nboth personally and (as to Fred) professionally.\n\n       In his brief, Appellant argues that Belt’s testimony was\n\nimproper, extraneous victim testimony because it pertained to a victim\n\nnot named in the indictment. (Appellant’s Brief pp.127-28). Mildred is\n\nthe only complainant listed in the instant indictment, not Fred.\n\n(CR:206).   Appellant did not object on this basis at trial, therefore this\n\nclaim is not preserved for review. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1. Regardless,\n\nAppellant is incorrect.   Belt’s testimony regarding the impact of the\n\noffense, that he “can’t shake it” and that it “[had him] messed up”\n\npertains to Mildred’s murder. Mildred and Fred were killed during the\n\n\n                                    259\n\fsame transaction. Because his testimony pertains to the victim named\n\nin the indictment, it was not improper.\n\n       Appellant complained at trial and in his brief on appeal that\n\nbecause Belt was allowed to testify as to the effect of the offense on\n\nMolly, he was denied the right to cross-examine her. At trial, the State\n\nasked only two questions of Belt regarding the effect of the offense on\n\nMolly. (RR68:236-37).     And, Appellant made no attempt to cross-\n\nexamine him. (RR68:239).\n\n       Even if this Court finds that the trial court erred in admitting\n\nBelt’s victim-impact testimony (which the State does not concede), any\n\nalleged error is harmless. See Tex. R. Evid. 103; Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b).\n\nBelt’s testimony about the impact of the offense on him and his family\n\nwas brief. And, he was the only witness to give this type of testimony.\n\nIndeed, the State was judicious and presented only one witness – Belt –\n\nto testify regarding the impact of the brutal murder of a highly\n\nrespected couple in the Dallas community.        Belt’s testimony did not\n\naffect Appellant’s substantial rights. See Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b).\n\n       Issue 46 should be overruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                    260\n\fSTATE’S   RESPONSE     TO    ISSUE   NOS.   47-48:   APPELLANT    IS   NOT\nINTELLECTUALLY DISABLED.\n\n\n       In Issue 47, Appellant contends that the jury’s response to the\n\nintellectual disability special issue is against the great weight and\n\npreponderance of the evidence. In Issue 48, Appellant contends that the\n\nevidence was sufficient to show that Appellant is intellectually disabled.\n\nAppellant’s contentions lack merit.\n\n                            Standard of Review\n\n       This Court has characterized the issue of intellectual disability\n\nas an affirmative defense. Neal v. State, 256 S.W.3d 264, 273 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2008). When a defendant asserts this affirmative defense at\n\ntrial, he bears the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence\n\nthat he is intellectually disabled. Id. In reviewing the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence to support the jury’s finding that Appellant was not\n\nintellectually disabled, the appellate court considers whether the\n\nfinding is so against the great weight and preponderance of the\n\nevidence as to be manifestly unjust. Id. The jury’s decision is entitled\n\nto great deference as it is in the best position to assess the witnesses’\n\ncredibility and resolve any conflicts in the evidence. Id.\n\n\n\n                                      261\n\f                      Alternate Standard of Review\n\n       In two issues, Appellant contends that the evidence presented at\n\ntrial established that he was intellectually disabled. The State\n\nunderstands Issue 47 to be that the jury’s response to the intellectual\n\ndisability special issue is against the great weight and preponderance of\n\nthe evidence and Issue 48 to be that the evidence was sufficient to show\n\nthat Appellant is intellectually disabled.       It is unclear whether\n\nAppellant is suggesting that there are two standards of review in\n\nconnection with the jury’s response to the intellectual disability issue.\n\nAs stated above, the standard of review in connection with the jury’s\n\nfinding on the intellectual disability special issue is whether the finding\n\nis so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to\n\nbe manifestly unjust.    Neal, 256 S.W.3d at 273.      Appellant cites no\n\nauthority to the contrary.\n\n                             Applicable Law\n\n     A defendant is intellectually disabled and, thus, exempt from the\n\ndeath penalty if he has (1) significant sub-average general intellectual\n\nfunctioning, usually evidenced by an intelligence quotient (IQ) score\n\nbelow 70, that is accompanied by, (2) related limitations in adaptive\n\n\n                                    262\n\ffunctioning, (3) before the age of 18.

The record supports the jury’s decision to\n\nanswer the first special issue “no.”\n\n                                 Appellant’s IQ\n\n     General intellectual functioning refers to an IQ which is obtained\n\nby   assessment      with   a    standardized,    individually   administered\n\nintelligence test.   See Moore, 470 S.W.3d at 487 (citing Hearn, 310\n\nS.W.3d at 428 n.7). Sub-average general intellectual functioning refers\n\nto an individual’s “measured intelligence on standardized psychometric\n\ninstruments of two or more standard deviations below the age-group\n\nmean for the tests used.” Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. §591.003(20)\n\n(West Supp. 2015).      “[T]he MR or Intellectual Disability category is\n\napproximately two standard deviations below the average, about an IQ\n\nscore of 70.” Cathey, 451 S.W.3d at 14.\n\n\n\n\n                                       264\n\f         Appellant presented evidence of two IQ scores:                   77 and 71.\n\n(RR65:118; RR66:23). Dr. Hom administered the Wechsler Adult\n\nIntelligence Test (WAIS-II) in 1987. (RR65:110, 115). On this test,\n\nAppellant’s full-scale IQ was 77. (RR65:118).\n\n         In 2012, Dr. McGarrahan administered the WAIS-IV and\n\nAppellant scored a 71.34 (RR66:16, 23, 29; SX248). Appellant’s “full-\n\nscale IQ was 71, which is in the - - what we used to call ‘mildly mentally\n\nretarded’ range to borderline functioning[.]” (RR66:23). Given that the\n\nstandard error of measurement is “essentially plus or minus five\n\npoints,” Appellant’s score falls in the range of 66-76. (RR66:29-30). Dr.\n\nMcGarrahan testified that Appellant’s IQ score was two standard\n\ndeviations below the norm. (RR66:9-10).\n\n         The State’s expert, Dr. Price, testified that Appellant’s 71 IQ score\n\nplaces him in “the borderline” range of mildly intellectually disabled.\n\n(RR69:78).        He testified, “you take into consideration the confidence\n\ninterval of the IQ score obtained and it includes, in this case, a score\n\nthat should be considered significantly sub-average.” (RR69:79). Dr.\n\n\n\n\n34   At the time of trial, the WAIS-IV was the current edition of this test. (RR69:24).\n                                            265\n\fPrice testified that Appellant meets the first prong of the intellectual\n\ndisability analysis. (RR69:79).\n\n     Taking into consideration the SEM associated with Appellant’s\n\n2012 71-IQ-score, the State agrees with Appellant that the evidence\n\nsubstantiates a finding that he meets the first prong of the intellectual\n\ndisability analysis.\n\n                             Adaptive Behavior\n\n       Even though Appellant’s 2012 IQ score meets the first prong of\n\nthe AAMR definition for intellectual disability, his IQ score alone does\n\nnot justify his classification as intellectually disabled.    See Ex parte\n\nTennard, 960 S.W.2d 57, 60-61 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997) (IQ scores should\n\nnot be used as a “unitary measure of mental retardation”). The score\n\nmust be accompanied by deficits in adaptive behavior. Briseno, 135\n\nS.W.3d at 7. Adaptive behavior is defined as “the effectiveness with or\n\ndegree to which a person meets the standards of personal independence\n\nand social responsibility expected of the person’s age and cultural\n\ngroup.” Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 591.003(1) (West Supp. 2015).\n\n“Impairments     in    adaptive   behavior   are   defined   as   significant\n\nlimitations in an individual's effectiveness in meeting the standards of\n\n\n                                     266\n\fmaturation,    learning,   personal       independence,   and/or   social\n\nresponsibility that are expected for his or her age level and cultural\n\ngroup, as determined by clinical assessment and, usually, standardized\n\nscales.” Briseno, 135 S.W.3d at 7 n.25.\n\n                            Expert Opinion\n\n       Dr. McGarrahan testified that Appellant’s adaptive deficits\n\n“include his academic functioning, his ability to socialize and be in the\n\ncommunity and live independently and take care of himself.”\n\n(RR66:24).    According to Dr. McGarrahan, Appellant could not make\n\nchange; had problems in school; did not learn how to drive; had\n\ndifficulty using a telephone and a telephone book; was a loner; had no\n\nfriends; had trouble getting along with people; and, experienced a head\n\ninjury at the age of 15. (RR66:25-26).\n\n       Dr. Price testified that he did not see significant limitations in\n\nAppellant’s adaptive behaviors. (RR69:38).       According to Dr. Price,\n\nthere was evidence that Appellant “had many different jobs in the time\n\nafter he was 17, in the free world.” (RR69:39). In addition, Appellant\n\nwas not incapable of graduating from high school. (RR69:39). Indeed,\n\nDr. Price did not believe that Appellant’s poor performance in school\n\n\n                                   267\n\fwas related to his intellectual functioning. (RR69:40). That Appellant\n\nwas picked on as a child and was a loner was not evidence of significant\n\nlimitations in adaptive behavior.     (RR69:41).   Some of the evidence\n\nshowed that he would not stand up for himself but other evidence\n\nshowed that he would. (RR69:41-42). Furthermore, Appellant was not\n\na complete loner; he had girlfriends and was close to some family\n\nmembers. (RR69:42). Importantly, when Appellant was younger, he\n\nwas not treated by everyone as if he was intellectually disabled.\n\n(RR69:44).\n\n       Dr. Price testified that Appellant has the ability to “formulate a\n\nplan to behave in a certain way, to get the effect or to achieve the\n\nconsequence that he was after.” (RR69:44-45). He also has the ability\n\nto lie in order to avoid criminal responsibility. (RR69:46). Dr. Price\n\ntestified that it appeared that the lying started with the Linwood\n\nincident. (RR69:46). Appellant “comes up with excuses, self-defense\n\nargument, denies that he committed this offense in the way in which\n\nthe evidence was presented to the jury, telling the investigator one\n\nthing and also telling her at the same time to not put that in the\n\nrecord.”   (RR69:46).   Appellant’s testimony in connection with the\n\n\n                                    268\n\fLinwood offense was significant to Dr. Price and “was very inconsistent\n\nwith a person with mental retardation[.]”        (RR69:58).   Dr. Price\n\ntestified:\n\n      Well, it speaks to the area of communication as adaptive\n      behavior, as well as the social problem-solving area. He\n      testified. He was cross examined. He responded to the\n      questions in a responsive fashion, on point. He understood\n      the questions. He had an answer that was in his own self-\n      interest, whether or not it was accurate or not.\n\n      It also showed a denial of responsibility for the act and a\n      memorization of the conduct. But he was able to, if you will,\n      hold his own on the witness stand under cross examination.\n      Something that can be difficult to do.\n\n(RR69:48).\n\n        Dr. Price also reviewed 24 of Appellant’s 90-day mental status\n\nexaminations from 2002 to 2010. (RR69:51).       “[W]ith very, very few\n\nexceptions, his mental status examines [sic] for those eight years . . .\n\nwere entirely normal.” (RR69:52). There was no evidence of psychosis,\n\nhearing voices, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia.     (RR69:52).    No\n\nmental health medications were administered. (RR69:52). There were\n\nno complaints of unusual behaviors. (RR69:53).\n\n\n\n\n                                   269\n\f                            Other Evidence\n\n       The record reflects that, from a young age, Appellant was an\n\nindividual fully capable of caring for himself and carrying out everyday\n\nactivities whether at home, on the streets, or while incarcerated.\n\nAppellant, also known by his nickname, “Clean,” liked clothes and liked\n\nto dress well. (RR62:19-20, 46, 54, 100, 111; RR66:79). Although he did\n\nnot have a driver’s license, he got around by driving Lonnie’s car,\n\nwalking, or having friends pick him up. (RR62:62-63, 117, 131).\n\n       Contrary to Dr. McGarrahan’s testimony that Appellant was a\n\nloner, didn’t have any friends, and did not know how to get along with\n\nothers, multiple witnesses testified that Appellant had relationships\n\nwith family, friends, and even had a girlfriend. (RR62:65, 131; RR66:25,\n\n131, 71, 96-97). Indeed, from a young age, Appellant maintained close\n\nrelationships with multiple family members, including his brother\n\nLonnie and sister Shirley as well as his cousins Bobby Charles and\n\nThomas, Anthony, and Cynthia Penagraph. (RR62:53, 100; RR65:49-\n\n50, 61; RR66:71). Thomas testified that he and Appellant were “just\n\nlike two peas in a pot (sic).” (RR62:65). They were “[r]eally close.”\n\n(RR62:65). Anthony testified that he and Appellant went everywhere\n\n\n                                  270\n\ftogether. (RR65:51). More recently, Appellant reconnected with his\n\nhalf-brother Rodney Turner. (RR66:96). The men became pen pals,\n\nencouraging each other through their letters. (RR66:97). Appellant’s\n\nletters included citations to Scripture. (RR66:106).\n\n       Growing up, Appellant’s cousins Anthony and Cynthia believed\n\nthat Appellant was slow but Lonnie, Thomas, and Delores Easter did\n\nnot. (RR62:26, 53, 100; RR65:49; RR66:130). Indeed, Lonnie thought\n\nAppellant was intelligent; Appellant could read and hold a conversation\n\nwith him and even helped him with his homework. (RR62:100-01, 118).\n\nEaster described Appellant as “very bright.” (RR62:26).\n\n       There is no evidence that Appellant was ever placed in special\n\neducation classes through DISD.          (RR68:207).   Appellant’s school\n\nrecords reflect that although he performed poorly in middle school, he\n\nimproved by his sophomore year of high school when he started\n\nattending Metro North. (RR68:203-04).        Notably, Appellant’s move to\n\nMetro North did not occur until after his head injury at Fair Park.\n\n(RR68:210). Dr. Price testified that based on the records, Appellant’s\n\nscores on the Iowa and California tests, and his performance at Metro\n\nNorth, Appellant was “not incapable” of graduating.       (RR69:40). See\n\n\n                                   271\n\fCathey, 451 S.W.3d at 64 (noting that “[t]he best source of retrospective\n\ninformation concerning adaptive behavior during the developmental\n\nperiod is usually school records.”).\n\n       Appellant presented evidence of the head injury at Fair Park.35\n\nThe evidence reflects, however, that he testified at the trial in\n\nconnection with the Linwood offense three years after the injury.\n\n(RR69:48). Dr. Price testified that Appellant’s testimony at that trial\n\nwas “very inconsistent with a person with mental retardation[.]”\n\n(RR69:48). Similarly, when he was interviewed by Cindy Kuykendall\n\nafter the instant offense, Appellant responded to questions, answered\n\nquestions   in   his   own   interest,       and   “provided   alibis,   excuses,\n\nrationalizations, [and] denials.” (RR69:49).\n\n       Appellant grew up in an area where fighting was common.\n\n(RR62:55-56, 110). While it is true that Appellant would get picked on,\n\ntwo of his cousins testified that if Appellant had to defend himself, he\n\nwould. (RR62:55, 107; RR65:47-48, 56; RR66:84). He even defended\n\nLonnie on more than one occasion. (RR62:108). Dr. Price testified that\n\nwhether one is picked on is not, by itself, evidence of intellectual\n\n35The State introduced a copy of Appellant’s medical records from Parkland\nHospital. The records contain no mention of the head injury. (RR69:57; SX249).\n                                       272\n\fdisability. (RR69:41).   Instead, it is the response to being picked on\n\nthat should be considered. (RR69:41).\n\n       Although Appellant had “very few jobs over his life[,]” there was\n\nevidence of some work experience. (RR66:18). Appellant worked as a\n\njanitor with his mother at Fair Park. (RR62:114). He worked on trucks\n\nwith Rice’s brother, Anthony. (RR66:126, 136). He worked at the Adel\n\nHunt Furniture Company. (RR66:56). In 1984, however, while he was\n\nout of prison on parole, he did not maintain stable employment.\n\n(RR63:192-93).\n\n       Appellant has a history of lying and manipulative behavior.\n\nWhen interviewed by police in connection with the Linwood incident, he\n\ntold the detective that he intended to kill Linwood when he stabbed\n\nhim, but then he told her not to include that detail in the report.\n\n(RR66:46-48). When he testified at trial, he claimed that he did not\n\nintend to kill Linwood; he just wanted to “scratch” Linwood to get him\n\nto leave him alone. (RR66:46-47).\n\n       In 1983, while in prison, Appellant was aggressive and tried to\n\nextort his then-cellmate Ferguson.        (RR63:137-39).   He manipulated\n\nanother inmate, Turner, into doing his laundry and doing “sexual stuff\n\n\n                                    273\n\ffor him[.]” (RR63:167-68).    A 2010 inventory of Appellant’s cell turned\n\nup two razor blades secreted in a book. (RR65:21-22; SX230). He also\n\nhad a diagram showing how to alter a radio to create a communication\n\ndevice. (RR65:17; SX232).\n\n        In prison, Appellant manages his time and health. He spends\n\nhis time reading.    One detention officer testified that Appellant is\n\nalways reading or sleeping. (RR67:41). He reads “novels off the law\n\nlibrary cart.” (RR67:45).    An inventory of his cell revealed eight books,\n\na dictionary, and a Bible. (RR65:12, 13, 14, 28-29; SX231, 236-42). He\n\nalso had a capital defense periodical that contained markings on\n\npassages concerning confidentiality and strategy. (RR65:24-28; SX233).\n\nWhen he has recreation time at the gym, Appellant walks or plays\n\nbasketball.   (RR67:42).    In the event that Appellant needs to see a\n\ndoctor, he is able to take the steps necessary to do so. (RR69:45).\n\n       In 2006, Appellant took an “Adaptive Behavior Screening Test.”\n\n(RR71:1212-13; SX251). He reported the following: prior to his arrest,\n\nhe lived with his family (common law wife); he supported himself with a\n\njob; he had bills and he paid them; he got to where he needed to go by\n\ndriving himself; he cooked what he ate; when he needed to go to the\n\n\n                                    274\n\fdoctor, his family made an appointment; he looked at an analog clock\n\nand correctly stated the time within 5 minutes; he washed his clothes\n\nhimself; and he reported that, to bake cornbread or a cake or biscuits,\n\nthe oven should be set to 300°-400°.     (RR71:1212-13; SX251).       He\n\nanswered one question incorrectly: “If cigarettes cost $4.35 and you\n\ngave the clerk a $5.00 bill, how much change should you get back?”\n\n(RR71:1213; SX251). Appellant answered “Any other [number]” instead\n\nof “$0.65.” (RR71:1213; SX251).\n\n       The commission of the instant offense demonstrates considerable\n\nforethought and planning. Through trial-and-error, Appellant figured\n\nout how to get inside the Finch home. Once inside, he overpowered not\n\njust one person, but two. After he brutally stabbed and killed Mildred\n\nand Fred, he selected and organized the property that he wanted to\n\ntake and then figured out how to transport it from the Finch home to\n\nhis own. Once at home, he concocted a story to explain the blood on his\n\nclothing and the source of all of the bags and boxes of clothing and\n\nassorted property. Later, he disposed of his bloody clothes and the knife\n\nhe used to kill Mildred and Fred. During an interview with the media\n\nafter the offense, Appellant told a reporter that he got the blood on his\n\n\n                                   275\n\fshoes from a dog that he had hit with a stick. (RR66:50). And, he gave\n\nan alibi for the day after the murders. (RR66:52-53).\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       A significant impairment in adaptive behavior may be thought of\n\nas the extent to which an individual requires assistance to carry\n\nout age-appropriate activities. See Cathey, 451 S.W.3d at 23. Given all\n\nof the foregoing, it is clear that before and after he turned 18, Appellant\n\nwas fully capable of carrying out age-appropriate activities. The jury\n\ncould have reasonably determined that any deficits Appellant had in\n\nadaptive behavior were not within the range of intellectual disability.\n\n                             Onset before 18\n\n     Appellant failed to prove an IQ below 70 and deficiencies in\n\nadaptive behavior prior to the age of 18. First of all, both of Appellant’s\n\nIQ tests were taken after his 18th birthday. When Appellant was tested\n\nby Dr. Hom in 1987, he was 26. (DX7). When he was tested by Dr.\n\nMcGarrahan in 2012, he was 51. (SX248). The only evidence of an IQ\n\ntest taken during the developmental period was the California Test of\n\nMental Maturity taken when Appellant was in second grade.\n\n(RR68:200). On this test, Appellant scored an 82 total IQ. (RR68:198).\n\n\n                                    276\n\f     Next, the evidence of adaptive deficits was conflicting. Some\n\nfamily members thought Appellant was slow, but others thought he\n\nfunctioned well and was bright. Although Appellant performed poorly\n\nduring some school years, his performance was better in others. There\n\nwas evidence that he worked with his mother. There was evidence that\n\nhe was bullied in the neighborhood, but there was also evidence that he\n\nstood up for himself. Appellant failed to prove that he is intellectually\n\ndisabled, much less that the onset occurred during the developmental\n\nperiod. See Cathey, 451 S.W.3d at 28 (stating that “If applicant has\n\nfailed to prove that he is intellectually disabled, he clearly did not prove\n\nthat he was intellectually disabled before the age of approximately\n\neighteen.”).\n\n                                Conclusion\n\n       Given the foregoing, it is clear that the jury’s answer to the\n\nintellectual disability special issue was not so against the great weight\n\nand preponderance of the evidence so as to be manifestly unjust. Neal,\n\n256 S.W.3d at 273.\n\n       Issues 47 and 48 should be overruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                    277\n\fSTATE’S   RESPONSE TO ISSUE NO.           49:   THE EVIDENCE IS LEGALLY\nSUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THE JURY’S FINDING THAT APPELLANT IS A\nFUTURE DANGER.\n\n\n       In Issue 49, Appellant contends that the evidence is legally\n\ninsufficient to support the jury’s finding that there is a probability that\n\nhe will commit criminal acts of violence in the future.        Appellant’s\n\ncontention lacks merit.\n\n                            Applicable Law\n\n     The State has the burden of proving the future dangerousness\n\nissue beyond a reasonable doubt. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art.\n\n37.0711, §§ 3(b)(2), 3(c) (West 2006); Ladd, 3 S.W.3d at 557. A jury may\n\nconsider a variety of factors when determining whether a defendant will\n\npose a continuing threat to society: the circumstances of the offense,\n\nthe defendant’s state of mind, whether he was working alone or with\n\nother parties, the calculated nature of his acts, the forethought and\n\ndeliberation exhibited by the crime’s execution, the existence of a prior\n\ncriminal record, the defendant’s age and personal circumstances at the\n\ntime of the offense, whether the defendant was acting under duress or\n\nthe domination of another at the time of the offense, psychiatric\n\nevidence, and character evidence. See Martinez v. State, 327 S.W.3d\n\n                                    278\n\f727, 730 n.4 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010). In reviewing the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence, the appellate court views all of the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the jury’s finding and determines whether, based on that\n\nevidence and reasonable inferences therefrom, a rational jury could\n\nhave found beyond a reasonable doubt that the answer to the future-\n\ndangerousness issue was “yes.” Id. at 730.\n\n                                Analysis\n\n       The State’s evidence unquestionably demonstrates Appellant’s\n\npropensity for violence. Indeed, the facts of the offense, standing alone,\n\nare sufficient to support a finding of future dangerousness. Appellant\n\nbroke into a home and brutally stabbed two people to death.           “[A]\n\nstabbing death is particularly brutal.” King v. State, 953 S.W.2d 266,\n\n272 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997). Appellant stabbed Mildred 90 times. And,\n\nMildred was not his only victim. He also stabbed Fred to death. This\n\nCourt has stated that the circumstances of the offense may be sufficient\n\nin some cases to support an affirmative finding on the future danger\n\nissue. Devoe v. State, 354 S.W.3d 457, 462 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011); see\n\nalso Martinez v. State, 924 S.W.2d 693, 696 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996)\n\n(commenting on the distinction between murders committed with a gun,\n\n\n                                   279\n\f“which can potentially be used from across a room . . . and which often\n\nresults in death resulting from a single shot” and with a knife “a\n\nweapon which, by virtue of its very nature, forces the user to be in such\n\nclose proximity to his victim that he is often touching him or comes into\n\ncontact with him on each blow [and] several thrusts are often utilized in\n\norder to ensure death”).\n\n         Regardless, the State did not rely on the facts of the offense\n\nalone.    The State presented the following additional evidence of\n\nAppellant’s history of violence which proves that he is a future danger:\n\n   In 1979, Appellant stabbed Linwood in the head with a\n    screwdriver causing permanent brain damage. (RR63:72,\n    84). Appellant told the detective that he was trying to kill\n    Linwood.\n\n   On the same day as the Linwood incident, Appellant got\n    into a fight with his brother Billy, during which he cut Billy\n    and Billy’s friend. (RR63:111-12).\n\n   Later that night, upset when an ex-girlfriend would not let\n    him inside her house, Appellant broke her window.\n    (RR63:102-03).\n\n   In January 1983, Appellant “started coming on” to his\n    cellmate, Ferguson. (RR63:136, 138-39).\n\n   In June 1983, Appellant was seen “raping another inmate.”\n    (RR63:151).\n\n\n                                   280\n\f   On the day after the rape, Appellant tried to force another\n    inmate, McCarroll, to “suck his dick.” (RR63:154). When\n    the inmate refused, Appellant broke the inmate’s nose and\n    gave him two black eyes. (RR63:154).\n\n   In August 1983, Appellant manipulated another inmate,\n    Turner, into washing his clothes and “do[ing] sexual stuff\n    for him[.]” (RR63:168). Appellant also made Turner have\n    sex with other inmates. (RR63:169).\n\n   While in jail, Appellant was moved multiple times for a\n    variety of reasons. He had to be placed in administrative\n    custody; he assaulted other inmates; he caused trouble in\n    the tank; he fought; he made sexual threats; and he could\n    not get along with others. (RR63:182; SX228).\n\n   While in prison, Appellant flooded his cell twice; used\n    indecent or vulgar language; threw his tray out of his cell;\n    threatened an officer twice; refused to obey an order\n    multiple times; got into a fistfight with another inmate;\n    threw two glasses of water at an officer, striking him on the\n    face and chest; and was found in possession of contraband\n    multiple times. (RR65:37-40; SX245).\n\n   In 1984, while on parole, Appellant failed to report and even\n    tried to stab his mother. (RR63:188-89).\n\n       Appellant argues that his good behavior while incarcerated on\n\ndeath row proves that he is not a future danger.     While good behavior\n\nin prison is a factor to consider, it does not preclude a finding of future\n\ndangerousness. Devoe, 354 S.W.3d at 468 (finding evidence sufficient to\n\n\n\n\n                                    281\n\fsupport jury’s finding of future dangerousness despite Devoe’s “pristine”\n\nbehavioral record while incarcerated).\n\n     Viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, the evidence is\n\nmore than sufficient to support the jury’s finding beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt that Appellant would constitute a continuing threat to society.\n\nThe evidence is sufficient to support the jury’s answer to the future\n\ndangerousness special issue.\n\n         Issue 49 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S   RESPONSE TO ISSUE     50:    THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR IN\nDENYING APPELLANT’S REQUESTED JURY INSTRUCTION.\n\n\n         Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his\n\nrequest to amend the jury instruction defining “significantly sub-\n\naverage general intellectual functioning.” Appellant’s contention lacks\n\nmerit.\n\n                             Pertinent Facts\n\n         The trial court’s charge to the jury defines “significantly sub-\n\naverage general intellectual functioning” as follows:\n\n     . . . refers to measured intelligence on standardized\n     psychometric instruments of approximately two or more\n     standard deviations below the group mean for the tests\n     used. Significantly subaverage intellectual functioning is\n\n                                      282\n\f     evidenced by an IQ score of approximately 70 or below. An\n     IQ score is not considered to be a fixed number. Instead a\n     score represents a range or an approximation of a person’s\n     IQ.\n\n(CR3:17).     Appellant requested that the following two sentences be\n\nadded to that definition:\n\n             IQ tests has [sic] a standard error of measurement\n              which is a reflection of the inherent imprecision of\n              the test itself.\n             An IQ score of 70 is considered to represent a band\n              or zone of a score of 65 to 75.\n\n(RR69:120). He argued that his additions would “fully develop and give\n\nan accurate definition of [the] terminology[.]” (RR69:120).   In support\n\nof his argument, Appellant called Dr. McGarrahan who testified that\n\nthe proposed instruction was important as it informs the jury that there\n\nis inherent error in the tests and that the “IQ itself is not a hard and\n\nfast number.” (RR69:122). The State then questioned Dr. McGarrahan\n\nas follows:\n\n     [State]: . . . Dr. McGarrahan, is the standard error of\n     measurement five points, plus or minus, for every IQ test?\n\n     [Dr. McGarrahan]: It is not. And that might not be exactly\n     accurate. The last part, to say a band zone or a score 65 to\n     75, it’s really not. It’s statistically based on each IQ score\n\n\n                                   283\n\f     and each IQ test. So we say approximately, plus or minus,\n     five points. But it’s not exact.\n\n     [State]: So some tests may have a standard error of\n     measurement of two-point something or three-point\n     something. It depends on the test that’s given, correct?\n\n     [Dr. McGarrahan]: It does. And it depends on - - like, we\n     have our verbal IQ or verbal comprehension versus our\n     performance reasoning, and those are different. Their\n     standard errors of measurement are different for each of\n     those.\n\n(RR69:123). The State opposed Appellant’s proffered additions as they\n\nwould constitute a comment on the weight of the evidence. (RR69:125).\n\nThe trial court denied Appellant’s request. (RR69:125).\n\n                           Applicable Law\n\n       The trial court has a duty to provide the jury with a written\n\ncharge, distinctly setting forth the law applicable to the case without\n\nexpressing any opinion as to the weight of the evidence, summing up\n\nthe testimony, discussing the facts, or using any argument that is\n\ncalculated to arouse the sympathy or excite the passions of the jury.\n\nSee Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 36.14 (West 2006).\n\n\n\n\n                                  284\n\f                                 Analysis\n\n       The trial court did not err in refusing Appellant’s request to\n\ninclude his two proffered sentences in the punishment charge.\n\nContrary to the statements in Appellant’s brief, the first sentence,\n\nwhich references the “standard error of measurement which is a\n\nreflection of the inherent imprecision of the test itself[,]” does not define\n\nsub-average general intellectual functioning.     Instead, it is a comment\n\non the weight of the evidence; it recites that IQ tests are inherently\n\nimprecise. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 36.14 (stating that the\n\ncourt’s charge shall not express any opinion as to the weight of the\n\nevidence). The trial court did not err in denying Appellant’s request to\n\ninclude this sentence in the charge.\n\n       The second sentence, which references the “band or zone of a\n\nscore of 65 to 75” is inaccurate.      Dr. McGarrahan testified that that\n\nsentence “might not be exactly accurate.” (RR69:123). She stated, “to\n\nsay a band zone or a score 65 to 75, it’s really not. It’s statistically\n\nbased on each IQ score and each IQ test. So we say approximately, plus\n\nor minus, five points.    But it’s not exact.”     (RR69:123).    Given Dr.\n\n\n\n\n                                     285\n\fMcGarrahan’s testimony, the trial did not err in denying Appellant’s\n\nrequest to include this sentence in the charge.\n\n          The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying\n\nAppellant’s requested instructions.       At a minimum, the ruling falls\n\nwithin the zone of reasonable disagreement. See Weatherred, 15 S.W.3d\n\nat 542.\n\n     Even if this Court finds that the trial court erred in denying\n\nAppellant’s requested instructions, which the State does not concede,\n\nAppellant has failed to show some harm. If there is error in the court’s\n\ncharge and that error was the subject of a timely objection in the trial\n\ncourt, reversal is required if the error is calculated to injure the rights\n\nof the defendant, which means only that there must be some harm as a\n\nresult of the error. See Almanza v. State, 686 S.W.2d 157, 171 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1985) (op. on reh’g). Whether the defendant suffered actual\n\nharm is evaluated in light of the entire jury charge, the state of the\n\nevidence, counsel’s arguments, and any other relevant information in\n\nthe record. See id.\n\n\n     With regard to the first sentence, as previously argued, it was a\n\ncomment on weight of the evidence. Regardless, that IQ scores are not\n\n                                    286\n\ffixed numbers was already before the jury. Dr. McGarrahan testified\n\nregarding the standard error of measurement, as did Dr. Price.\n\n(RR66:29-30; RR69:33-34). Indeed, the fact that IQ scores do not\n\nrepresent fixed numbers was undisputed.       As to the second sentence,\n\nAppellant cannot show harm since Dr. McGarrahan herself testified\n\nthat it may not be an accurate statement. (RR69:123).\n\n     Issue 50 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S   RESPONSE TO ISSUE    51:    THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR IN\nDENYING APPELLANT’S REQUEST THAT THE JURY BE ALLOWED TO ENTER\nA NON-UNANIMOUS VERDICT REGARDING THE INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY\nSPECIAL ISSUE.\n\n\n     Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his\n\nrequest that the jury not be required to unanimously find the\n\nintellectual disability special issue in his favor. Appellant’s contention\n\nlacks merit.\n\n                            Pertinent Facts\n\n       During the charge conference,          Appellant requested the\n\nfollowing:\n\n     . . . where the Court is submitting and that the jury, to find\n     mental retardation, must agree unanimously, we are\n     requesting a civil burden be placed here. In the state of\n\n\n                                     287\n\f      Texas, a civil burden is a jury verdict of ten members of the\n      jury, as opposed to the twelve.\n\n      In other words, none is not unanimously to be found, and we\n      would ask that the Court adopt or adapt one of the - - like,\n      on page three, where it says in the middle of the page “you\n      may not answer either issue” we would request “. . . this\n      Special Issue yes, unless ten or more Members of the Jury\n      agree”. That that be applied, instead of a unanimously [sic]\n      burden.\n\n(RR69:125-26). Appellant’s request was denied. (RR69:126).\n\n           The jury was instructed regarding the intellectual disability\n\nspecial issue as follows:\n\n      You may not answer Special Issue No. 1 “yes” or “no” unless\n      the jury agrees unanimously. Members of the jury need not\n      agree on what particular evidence supports a “yes” answer\n      to Special Issue No. 1.\n\n(CR3:19).\n\n                                  Analysis\n\n           On appeal, Appellant has failed to properly brief this issue. He\n\nlists three cases and a statute, but he includes no argument showing\n\nthat he was entitled to the complained-of instruction. Tex. R. App. P.\n\n38.1(i).\n\n\n\n\n                                      288\n\f        Regardless, Appellant’s argument lacks merit. Unlike the future\n\ndanger and mitigation special issues, the Texas Legislature has not\n\nestablished a statutory scheme for the presentation and determination\n\nof an issue of intellectual disability in a capital murder trial.    See\n\nHunter v. State, 243 S.W.3d 664, 672 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007).          In\n\nHunter, this Court overruled Hunter’s complaint that he was entitled to\n\na pre-trial determination of intellectual disability.   Id.   This Court\n\nstated that, “In the absence of legislation or a constitutional\n\nrequirement directing when the determination of mental retardation is\n\nto be made or by whom, the trial court committed no error in denying\n\n[Hunter] a pretrial determination of mental retardation by a judge or\n\njury separate from that determining guilt.” Id. The same logic applies\n\nhere.   Since there is no statutory scheme dictating the jury verdict\n\nregarding intellectual disability, the trial court committed no error in\n\nrequiring that it be unanimous.\n\n        In his brief, Appellant cites three cases and a civil rule;\n\nhowever, none provide authority in support of his argument that the\n\njury should have been allowed to answer the intellectual disability\n\nspecial issue “yes” if only ten of the twelve jurors agreed. (Appellant’s\n\n\n                                   289\n\fBrief p.144). Neither Briseno nor Gallo mandate Appellant’s proposed\n\ninstruction. Briseno, 135 S.W.3d 1; Gallo v. State, 239 S.W.3d 757 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2007). The opinion in Williams v. State contains a footnote,\n\nwhich recites that jurors were instructed to answer the intellectual\n\ndisability special issue “yes” if at least ten jurors found that he proved\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence that he was intellectually disabled.\n\n270 S.W.3d 112, 134 fn.30 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008). The opinion does not\n\naddress whether that instruction was required or whether it was even\n\nproper. Id.    Rule 292 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provides\n\nthat a jury may render a verdict “by the concurrence . . . of the same ten\n\nor more members of an original jury of twelve[.]” Tex. R. Civ. Proc.\n\nAnn. 292. Appellant points to no authority showing that Rule 292\n\napplies to a jury determination of intellectual disability in a capital\n\nmurder case.\n\n       In any event, even if this Court concludes that the trial court\n\nerred in denying Appellant’s proposed instruction, which the State does\n\nnot concede, any alleged error was harmless. In this case, the jury was\n\nunanimous; the jury unanimously found that Appellant failed to prove\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence that he was intellectually disabled.\n\n\n                                   290\n\f       Issue 51 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S   RESPONSE TO ISSUE    52:    THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR IN\nDENYING    APPELLANT’S    REQUEST          FOR   AN   ACCOMPLICE   WITNESS\nINSTRUCTION.\n\n\n       Appellant contends that the trial court erred in failing to include\n\nan accomplice witness instruction in the instant punishment charge.\n\nAppellant’s contention lacks merit.\n\n                           Pertinent Facts\n\n       During the charge conference, Appellant requested “that the jury\n\nbe instructed that Lonnie Thomas was an accomplice witness[.]”\n\n(RR69:126-27; DX25). Appellant offered the following instruction:\n\n     You are instructed that Lonnie Thomas was an accomplice\n     and you cannot consider his testimony unless you first\n     believe that his testimony is true and shows the guilt of the\n     defendant as charged by the indictment, and then you\n     cannot consider his testimony unless the accomplice\n     witness’ testimony is corroborated by other evidence tending\n     to connect the defendant with the offense charged, and the\n     corroboration is not sufficient if it merely shows the\n     commission of the offense, but it must tend to connect the\n     defendant with its commission.\n\n(DX25). In response, the State argued that an accomplice instruction\n\nwould be appropriate for a guilt-or-innocence charge, but not a\n\npunishment charge.     (RR69:127).         The State pointed out that the\n                                     291\n\fexisting charge already instructed the jury to determine the credibility\n\nof each witness, which would necessarily include Lonnie. (RR69:127).\n\nAnything further would be a comment on the weight of the evidence.\n\n(RR69:127).    Appellant’s request for an instruction was denied.\n\n(RR69:127).\n\n                              Applicable Law\n\n       Article 38.14 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides\n\nas follows:\n\n     A conviction cannot be had upon the testimony of an\n     accomplice unless corroborated by other evidence tending to\n     connect the defendant with the offense committed; and the\n     corroboration is not sufficient if it merely shows the\n     commission of the offense.\n\nTex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.14 (West 2005).\n\n                                 Analysis\n\n       Appellant has failed to properly brief this issue.           Indeed, his\n\nbriefing   regarding   this   issue    consists   of   only   two    sentences.\n\n(Appellant’s Brief pp.144-45).        This Court is not required to make\n\nAppellant’s case for him. Garcia, 887 S.W.2d at 882.\n\n       Moreover, Appellant points to no authority in support of his\n\ncontention that he was entitled to an accomplice-witness-instruction\n                                       292\n\fduring the punishment phase of trial. Appellant cites one case, Zamora\n\nv. State, 411 S.W.3d 504 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013).36 This case concerns\n\nthe use of an accomplice-witness-instruction during the guilt/innocence\n\nphase of trial. Id. at 507-08. Appellant does not cite – and the State\n\ncannot locate – any authority requiring such an instruction in the\n\npunishment charge.\n\n        Issue 52 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S    RESPONSE TO ISSUE         53:    THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR IN\nDENYING APPELLANT’S REQUEST FOR AN ANTI-PARTIES INSTRUCTION IN\nTHE CHARGE.\n\n\n        Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his\n\nrequest for an anti-parties instruction in the jury charge. Appellant’s\n\ncontention lacks merit.\n\n                                 Pertinent Facts\n\n        Appellant requested that the trial court include the following\n\ninstruction in the charge:\n\n      You are further instructed that at this phase of the trial\n      only the conduct of the Defendant can be considered in\n      determining the answers to the special issues submitted to\n      you.\n\n36In fact, Applicant cites to Zamosa v. State, 41 S.W.3d 504 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013).\nThere is no case by that name at that cite. The State believes this is a clerical error.\n                                           293\n\f(RR69:128).\n\n                            Applicable Law\n\n        Where    a   law   of   parties   charge   is    given   during   the\n\nguilt/innocence phase of a capital case, a prophylactic instruction should\n\nbe given, if requested, which would instruct the jury to limit its\n\nconsideration of punishment evidence to conduct shown to have been\n\ncommitted by the defendant.       Belyeu v. State, 791 S.W.2d 66, 72-73\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1989). This is referred to as an “anti-parties” charge.\n\nSee Martinez v. State, 899 S.W.2d 655, 657 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994).\n\nHowever, a blanket rule that each time a charge on the law of parties is\n\ngiven at the guilt/innocence stage of a capital murder case an “anti-\n\nparties” charge must be given on request at the punishment stage (or\n\ncharge error results) is inappropriate. See id. at 73.\n\n                                 Analysis\n\n       Appellant has failed to properly brief this issue. Although he\n\ncites three cases, he fails to set forth any specific argument or\n\ndiscussion of the authority in support of his contention.        (Appellant’s\n\nBrief p.144). This Court is not required to make Appellant’s case for\n\nhim. Garcia, 887 S.W.2d at 882.\n\n                                    294\n\f         Regardless, Appellant’s argument fails. The trial court did not\n\nerr in denying Appellant’s request for an anti-parties charge. Contrary\n\nto the statements in Appellant’s brief, a parties instruction was not\n\nincluded in the original guilt/innocence charge. The jury was instructed\n\nthat Lonnie Thomas was an accomplice, however, there was no\n\ninstruction regarding Appellant’s criminal responsibility as a party.\n\nBecause there was no parties instruction in the guilt/innocence charge,\n\nAppellant was not entitled to one in the instant punishment charge.\n\n         Issue 53 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S   RESPONSE TO ISSUE     54:    THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR IN\nDENYING APPELLANT’S REQUEST FOR A SECOND COMPETENCY HEARING.\n\n\n         Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his\n\nrequest for a second competency hearing. Appellant’s contention lacks\n\nmerit.\n\n                             Pertinent Facts\n\n         On July 9, 2014, the jury found Appellant competent to stand\n\ntrial. (RR59:7).\n\n         Trial on the merits began on July 10, 2014. (RR60). At the\n\nconclusion of testimony on July 15, defense counsel requested the\n\nopportunity for he and Appellant to put some things on the record, ex\n                                      295\n\fparte.    (RR63:204-05).     During that ex parte hearing, Appellant\n\nappeared to offer to “accept signing any document, endorsing any\n\npaperwork needed,” so that he could go home, having already served 27\n\nyears for this offense.      (RR63:209-10).   The trial court informed\n\nAppellant that even if counsel filed a Motion for Time Served, he “would\n\nhave to deny it.    Because the State has the . . . right to make the\n\nelection how they wish to proceed in this type of case. And if they wish\n\nto proceed and pursue the death penalty, then the Court cannot, on its\n\nown, prevent them from doing so.” (RR63:211).\n\n         The following morning, before Appellant was brought into the\n\ncourtroom, he completely undressed himself then smeared feces on his\n\nface and upper chest.      (RR64:4; DX4-5).   In a hearing in chambers,\n\ndefense counsel stated:\n\n     . . . We were in court getting ready to proceed in trial when\n     the bailiffs alerted us that Mr. Thomas was back in his cell\n     and undressed and covered in feces.\n\n     They allowed me to go back to the holding cell to speak to\n     him. I asked him if he would get dressed and clean himself\n     up, and he said he was fine the way he was. I asked him\n     was he refusing to come into court, and he said, no; that he\n     was ready to come into the courtroom, but that’s the way he\n     was going to enter.\n\n\n                                    296\n\f(RR64:3).   Counsel took photographs of Appellant with his phone and\n\nshowed them to the trial court “to support our position again that there\n\nhas been a material change in his competency, and we would ask the\n\nCourt to consider that at this time when deciding whether to make an\n\ninquiry.” (RR64:5-6; DX4-5).   Counsel advised of her intent to file an\n\nAmended Motion for Competency Evaluation and Hearing. (RR64:5).\n\nThe trial court stated that the defense could file their motion and he\n\nwould take it under advisement. (RR64:6). The judge stated, however,\n\nthat he believed that Appellant was “just playing games and trying to\n\ndelay this proceeding.” (RR64:6).\n\n       Appellant agreed to take a shower and clean himself and then\n\nreturn to court. (RR64:10-11). He requested to see his “psych doctor at\n\nthe jail.” (RR64:11).   Testimony resumed that afternoon. (RR65:8).\n\nAppellant elected to remain in the holdover during testimony.\n\n(RR65:8).\n\n       On July 23, 2014, defense counsel filed “Under Seal Defendant’s\n\nSecond Notice of Incompetence to Stand Trial.”      (CR-S:24).   In the\n\nmotion, counsel alleged that “[s]ubsequent to the jury determination on\n\nJuly 9, 2014 that the Defendant was competent to stand trial there has\n\n\n                                    297\n\fbeen a marked and material decline in the Defendant’s competency[.]”\n\n(CR-S:24).   Counsel requested that the trial court again inquire into\n\nAppellant’s competency to stand trial.        In support of the motion,\n\ncounsel attached an affidavit wherein she averred that Appellant’s\n\ncondition had worsened; he has persistent delusions; he did not\n\nunderstand that his innocence is not at issue in the trial proceedings; on\n\nJuly 16, 2014, Appellant “had a breakdown, removing all his clothes in\n\nthe holdover and smearing excrement on his face and chest.” (CR-S:24).\n\n       After closing arguments but before the verdict, defense counsel\n\n“ask[ed] the court consider our Motion and make its ruling.” (RR70:81).\n\nThe motion was denied. (RR70:81). Counsel re-urged the motion after\n\nthe verdict, but prior to sentencing. (RR70:84). The motion was denied.\n\n(RR70:84).\n\n                            Applicable Law\n\n       A defendant is presumed competent to stand trial. Tex. Code\n\nCrim. Proc. Ann. art. 46B.003(b). A defendant is incompetent to stand\n\ntrial if he lacks: (1) sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer\n\nwith a reasonable degree of rational understanding; or (2) a rational as\n\nwell as factual understanding of the proceedings against him. See Tex.\n\n\n                                    298\n\fCode Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 46B.003(a).      Should a formal competency\n\ntrial result in a finding of competency, the trial court is not obliged to\n\nrevisit the issue later absent a material change of circumstances\n\nsuggesting that the defendant's mental status has deteriorated. Turner\n\nv. State, 422 S.W.3d 676, 693 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013).\n\n                                Analysis\n\n        The trial court did not err in denying Appellant’s request for a\n\nsecond competency determination because Appellant failed to prove a\n\nmaterial change of circumstances since the previous determination of\n\ncompetency. Appellant’s competence was determined by a jury on July\n\n9th.   A week later, on July 16th, when trial on the merits was well\n\nunderway, Appellant undressed and smeared feces on his face and\n\nchest. In a hearing in chambers, the judge stated:\n\n       For the record, the Court engaged in a conversation with\n       the Defendant after the end of testimony yesterday and,\n       based on that conversation, the Court is going to proceed\n       with the trial.\n\n       The Court is of the opinion that the Defendant is just\n       playing games and trying to delay this proceeding.\n\n(RR64:6).    This exchange was the informal inquiry into Appellant’s\n\ncompetency. It is clear from the judge’s comment, however, that he did\n\n                                   299\n\fnot believe that evidence existed to support a finding of incompetency.\n\nA trial court's first-hand factual assessment of a defendant's\n\ncompetency is entitled to great deference on appeal. Ross v. State, 133\n\nS.W.3d 618, 627 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004).\n\n       In any event, the trial court invited the defense to file a motion,\n\nwhich the judge would take under advisement. (RR64:4).           Defense\n\ncounsel did not file the instant motion until seven days later, on July\n\n23rd, when the parties delivered their closing arguments.      (CR-S:24).\n\nAlthough the motion alleges that Appellant has suffered “a marked and\n\nmaterial decline in Defendant’s competency[,]”         no evidence was\n\npresented to prove that there had been a material change in\n\ncircumstances in connection with Appellant’s mental status.        In the\n\naffidavit attached to the motion, counsel described that Appellant\n\nsuffers from delusions.    But, this evidence was presented and rejected\n\nat the July 7th competency trial. (RR57:177-80, 182, 185). Counsel also\n\nalleged that Appellant “persists in demanding that we put on a defense\n\nto his guilt.” (CR-S:24). Evidence on this subject was also presented at\n\nthe competency trial.     Dr. McGarrahan testified at length regarding\n\nAppellant’s belief that he cannot be convicted if the State fails to\n\n\n                                    300\n\fintroduce the murder weapon.       (RR57:175-77).     She testified that\n\nAppellant believes that State’s witnesses are working behind the scenes\n\nto ensure his conviction. (RR57:177).     She testified that Appellant’s\n\n“perceptions and his beliefs are not based in reality.” (RR57:179). “He\n\nbelieves that if only his attorneys . . . could file the right motion, he\n\ncould walk out the door.” (RR57:181). The competency jury heard this\n\ninformation and rejected it. (RR59:7).\n\n       The affidavit also described the July 16th feces incident.\n\nHowever, beyond the mere fact of the incident itself, no evidence was\n\npresented to suggest that in the days between the jury’s determination\n\nof competency, the feces incident and informal inquiry, and the filing of\n\nthe motion, that Appellant had suffered a material change of\n\ncircumstances suggesting that his mental status has deteriorated.\n\nBeyond the mere fact of the incident itself, no evidence was presented to\n\nsuggest that Appellant lacked sufficient present ability to consult with\n\nhis lawyers with a reasonable degree of rational understanding or that\n\nhe lacked a rational as well as a factual understanding of the\n\nproceedings. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 46B.003(a). Indeed,\n\nthe affidavit merely recites that after the incident, Appellant “seemed\n\n\n                                   301\n\fdazed [and] largely non-responsive to [counsel’s] questions and\n\nexplanations.” (CR-S:24).    The next day, Appellant “was cheerful and\n\nhad returned to his delusive state.” (CR-S:24). There is no mention of\n\nany additional information suggesting a deterioration in Appellant’s\n\nmental status.\n\n       While it is true that Appellant’s decision to smear feces on his\n\nface and upper chest was shocking and repellant, it was not necessarily\n\nan act demonstrating incompetency.       Johnson v. State, 429 S.W.3d 13,\n\n18 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2013, no pet.) (stating that “[b]izarre,\n\nobscene, or disruptive comments by a defendant during court\n\nproceedings do not necessarily constitute evidence supporting a finding\n\nof incompetency”). Instead, it was an act intended to cause disruption.\n\nFrom the very beginning of the trial proceedings, Appellant engaged in\n\nbehavior calculated to disrupt those proceedings.    At the beginning of\n\nvoir dire, Appellant sought to voluntarily absent himself. (RR12:10-11).\n\nHe told counsel that if he was brought into the courtroom that he would\n\nfight the guards.   (RR11:6).   On July 12th, Appellant told one of his\n\nlawyers that “The three of us need to work together to stop the trial[.]”\n\n(CR-S:24). Three days later (the day before the feces incident), during\n\n\n                                   302\n\ftestimony by State’s witness Turner, Appellant stood up and tried to\n\nwalk out of the courtroom into the holdover. (RR63:163). At the end of\n\nthat day, during the ex parte hearing described above, Appellant told\n\nthe judge that he had “asked Mr. Carlos [sic] to stop the jury several\n\ntimes.” (RR63:210).      The following morning, Appellant smeared feces\n\non himself.\n\n        The feces incident was not the act of a man suffering a material\n\ndeterioration in his mental status; it was the well-devised strategy of a\n\nman trying to derail his capital murder trial. It is worth noting the\n\nbailiff’s description of the incident:\n\n      When we did roll call, [Appellant] was in his cell and he was\n      dressed out at that time. When we had went to get him for\n      court, he was totally nude and he had feces wiped across his\n      entire face and also his chest. His clothes were folded up\n      and put to the side. There was no feces on the walls or floor\n      or anywhere inside the cell. It was just on hisself [sic].\n\n(RR64:9).     Indeed, the photographs reflect that Appellant smeared the\n\nfeces on his face very carefully, deliberately avoiding his eyes, nose, and\n\nmouth. (RR72:15, 17; DX4-5). Afterward, he took the time to wash his\n\nhands as there appears to be no feces on his hands. (RR72:15, 17; DX4-\n\n5).   That Appellant was able to talk to his attorney and agree to clean\n\n\n                                         303\n\fhimself and return to court shows that he was able to communicate\n\nwith counsel. Given the foregoing, it is clear that the trial court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in denying Appellant’s motion for a third inquiry\n\ninto his competency.     At a minimum, it falls within the zone of\n\nreasonable disagreement.\n\n       Issue 54 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S   RESPONSE TO ISSUE NO.      55:   APPELLANT’S CLAIM THAT THE\nEVIDENCE IS INSUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT HIS CONVICTION FOR CAPITAL\nMURDER PRESENTS NOTHING FOR THIS COURT’S REVIEW.\n\n\n     Appellant contends that the evidence is insufficient to support his\n\nconviction for capital murder. In particular, he points to the fact that\n\nthe murder weapon was never found and entered into evidence.\n\n                            Applicable Law\n\n     On an appeal of a retrial on punishment only, an appellant may\n\nnot allege any error that transpired during the guilt-innocence phase of\n\ntrial. See Easton v. State, 920 S.W.2d 747, 749 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] 1996, pet. ref’d). The appeal is entirely limited to issues\n\npertaining to the retrial on punishment. See Sanders v. State, 832\n\nS.W.2d 719, 723-24 (Tex. App.—Austin 1992, no pet.).\n\n\n\n\n                                    304\n\f                               Analysis\n\n     On August 25, 2010, this Court vacated Appellant’s sentence and\n\nremanded the case to the trial court for a new punishment hearing. See\n\nEx parte Thomas, No. AP-76,405, 2010 Tex. Crim. App. Unpub. LEXIS\n\n452, at *6 (Tex. Crim. App. Aug. 25, 2010) (not designated for\n\npublication). Because he was retried as to punishment only, Appellant’s\n\nappeal is limited to issues pertaining to that punishment retrial. See\n\nSanders, 832 S.W.2d at 723-24.               Appellant’s current complaint\n\nregarding the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction for\n\ncapital murder, however, relates to the guilt/innocence phase of trial.\n\nAppellant has failed to present an issue appropriate for this Court’s\n\nreview.\n\n     Issue 55 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S   RESPONSE TO ISSUE NOS.      56-67:   THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY\nDENIED APPELLANT’S CHALLENGES TO THE DEATH PENALTY STATUTE.\n\n\n     In    Issues   56   through       67,     Appellant   challenges   the\n\nconstitutionality of the Texas death penalty statute. He acknowledges\n\nthat these issues have been previously submitted to this Court and\n\noverruled, citing Saldano, 232 S.W.3d 77, but invites the Court to\n\nreview its prior stance on these issues. He claims that he asserts these\n                                     305\n\fissues not to cause unnecessary litigation but to preserve the issues for\n\nfederal court review. (Appellant’s Brief p.151).\n\n      In Issue 56, Appellant contends the statute under which he was\n\nsentenced to death violates the Eighth Amendment by allowing the jury\n\ntoo much discretion in determining who should live and who should die\n\nand results in the arbitrary and capricious imposition of the death\n\npenalty. (Appellant’s Brief p.152).\n\n      In Issue 57, Appellant contends that the Texas death penalty\n\nstatute violates the due process mandates of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment because it implicitly puts the burden of proving the\n\nmitigation special issue on him rather than placing the burden on the\n\nState to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that no circumstances\n\nwarrant a life sentence rather than a death sentence. (Appellant’s Brief\n\np.152).\n\n      In Issue 58, Appellant contends the trial court erred in denying\n\nhis motion to hold that Article 37.0711, §§ 2(e) and (f) violates Article I,\n\n§§ 10 and 13 of the Texas Constitution.37 (Appellant’s Brief p.153).\n\n\n\n37 The State presumes that Appellant’s citation to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art.\n37.071 is actually a citation to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.0711, §§ 3(e) and\n(f) (West Supp. 2015).\n                                        306\n\f     In Issue 59, Appellant contends that the Texas death penalty\n\nscheme violates the due process protections of the U.S. Constitution\n\nbecause it does not require the State to prove the absence of sufficient\n\nmitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt, contrary to\n\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), and its progeny.\n\n(Appellant’s Brief p.154).\n\n     In Issue 60, Appellant contends that the Texas death penalty\n\nscheme violates his rights against cruel and unusual punishment and to\n\ndue process of law under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments by\n\nrequiring at least ten “no” votes for the jury to return a negative answer\n\nto a punishment special issue. (Appellant’s Brief p.154).\n\n     In Issue 61, Appellant contends that the Texas death penalty\n\nscheme violates his rights against cruel and unusual punishment, to an\n\nimpartial jury, and to due process of law under the Sixth, Eighth, and\n\nFourteenth Amendments because vague, undefined terms in the\n\npunishment jury instructions effectively determine the difference\n\nbetween a life or death sentence. (Appellant’s Brief p.155).\n\n     In Issue 62, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in\n\noverruling   his   motion    to   hold     Art.   37.071,   §§   2(e)   and   (f)\n\n\n                                     307\n\funconstitutional because it fails to require the jury to give meaningful\n\nconsideration to mitigating evidence. 38 (Appellant’s Brief p.156).\n\n      In Issue 63, Appellant contends that the mitigation special issue is\n\nunconstitutional because it fails to place the burden of proof on the\n\nState to prove that aggravating evidence exists.               (Appellant’s Brief\n\np.156).\n\n      In Issue 64, Appellant claims that the mitigation special issue is\n\nunconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the\n\nU.S. Constitution because it permits an open-ended discretion which\n\nwas condemned by Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972).\n\n(Appellant’s Brief p.157).\n\n      In Issue 65, Appellant contends that Texas’ statutory capital\n\nsentencing scheme is unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth\n\nAmendments        because      it   lacks     meaningful      appellate     review.\n\n(Appellant’s Brief pp.157-58).\n\n      In Issue 66, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in\n\noverruling his pre-trial motions which raised various constitutional\n\n\n\n38 The State presumes that Appellant’s citation to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art.\n37.071 is actually a citation to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.0711, §§ 3(e) and\n(f).\n                                        308\n\fchallenges   to   the   Texas    capital   murder   punishment    scheme.\n\n(Appellant’s Brief pp.158-59).\n\n     In Issue 67, Appellant contends that the cumulative effect of these\n\nalleged constitutional violations denied him due process of law in\n\nviolation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S.\n\nConstitution. (Appellant’s Brief pp.159-60).\n\n     Appellant invites the Court to revisit its prior decisions on these\n\nissues, which he agrees have all been previously overruled.           See\n\nAppellant’s Brief at 151, 158; Saldano, 232 S.W.3d at 107-09\n\n(overruling multiple challenges to death penalty statute); Escamilla,\n\n143 S.W.3d at 828-829 (overruling similar challenges).           Appellant\n\npresents no new arguments for the State to address. Accordingly, the\n\nState asks this Court to decline his invitation to revisit these legal\n\nclaims and to overrule issues 56 through 67.\n\n\n\n\n                                     309\n\f                               PRAYER\n\n     The State prays that this Honorable Court will affirm the\n\njudgment of the trial court.\n\n                                       Respectfully submitted,\n\n\nSusan Hawk                             Christine Womble\nCriminal District Attorney             Assistant District Attorney\nMessina Madson                         State Bar No. 24035991\nFirst Assistant                        Frank Crowley Courts Bldg\nCriminal District Attorney             133 N.

See Tex.\n\nCode Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.0711, § 3(j) (West Supp. 2015). The trial\n\ncourt sentenced Appellant to death on July 23, 2014 for the capital\n\nmurder of Mildred Finch. (CR:88-89; RR70:84-85).1 Appellant filed his\n\nbrief on direct appeal on June 22, 2015. He filed an amended brief on\n\nAugust 24, 2016.          Appellant presents sixty-seven allegations of\n\nreversible error.\n\n                         STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      On    or   about    March     16,       1986,   Kenneth   Wayne    Thomas\n\n(hereinafter, “Appellant”), broke into the home of Fred and Mildred\n\n\n1The State will refer to the Clerk’s Record filed on December 23, 2014 as “CR,” the\nClerk’s Record filed on October 27, 2015 as “CR2,” the Clerk’s Record filed on\nNovember 30, 2015 as “CR3,” the Clerk’s Record filed on March 3, 2016 as “CR4,”\nand the Sealed Clerk’s Record as “CR-S.”\n                                          1\n\fFinch. Fred and Mildred were home at the time of the burglary and\n\nAppellant stabbed and killed them both.\n\n                          Fred and Mildred\n\n     At the time of their death, Fred and Mildred Finch had been\n\nmarried for many years.    (RR68:221). Fred and Mildred were both in\n\ntheir mid-60s and they shared a small house on Rose Lane, the home\n\nthat they purchased in the 1950s.        (RR60:31; RR68:223-25; SX34A).\n\nMildred, a smart and strong-willed woman with a master’s degree in\n\nmath and science, was a Professor of Mathematics at El Centro College.\n\n(RR68:224; SX2).   Fred, a World War II veteran and former Tuskegee\n\nairman, was a Harvard-educated lawyer who had worked to integrate\n\nschools and hotels in Dallas.   (RR68:221-22; SX1).   Fred and Mildred\n\nhad one child, a daughter named Molly. (RR68:221). Molly married\n\nJames Belt, Jr.    (RR68:220-21).       Molly and James gave Fred and\n\nMildred two grandchildren, James III and Melanie. (RR68:226).\n\n     On Sunday, March 16, 1986, the Belt family attended the 8:00\n\na.m. services at their church. (RR68:227). Afterward, Molly planned to\n\ntake Mildred to the mall. (RR68:227).        James stayed behind at the\n\nchurch to attend Sunday school. (RR68:227).        He would get a ride\n\n\n                                    2\n\fhome with a friend later. (RR68:227).     While James was waiting for\n\nhis ride, he was notified that he had a phone call. (RR68:227). It was\n\nMelanie. (RR68:226, 228). Melanie said that James needed to come to\n\nRose Lane immediately. (RR68:228).\n\n     When James arrived, Molly, Melanie, and James III were in front\n\nof the house. (RR68:228).     A police officer was there.   (RR68:228).\n\nJames went to the back door and asked whether the officer had been\n\ninside the house.   (RR68:228).     The officer had not.    (RR68:228).\n\nJames noticed that the back door was open and Fred’s car was in the\n\ndriveway. (RR68:228).       At that point, James knew something was\n\nwrong so he went inside the house. (RR68:228).     James described the\n\nscene:\n\n     I guess I was on my knees or crawling or something, and I\n     crawled through the kitchen. When I got midway through\n     the kitchen, at the end of the kitchen, I saw [Mildred]. Oh,\n     God. She was laying on the floor, and blood was everywhere.\n     Blood was everywhere: On the floor, on the wall, on the\n     ceiling. It was everywhere. When I touched her, she was\n     cold. I felt her pulse. She was dead.\n\n     I went into the bedroom. [Fred] was dead. Bed was just\n     covered with blood. Blood was on the floor, it was on the\n     wall, it was on the ceiling. It was everywhere.\n\n\n\n                                   3\n\f                       ...\n\n      In the living room, there was clothes piled up everywhere.\n      In the bedroom, the drawers had been pulled out. There\n      were clothes and things on the floor. I could tell that the\n      house had just been ramshacked (sic).\n\n(RR68:228-29).     Fred and Mildred appeared to have been stabbed\n\nmultiple times. (RR60:34).\n\n       Mildred’s body was found lying in the hallway, up against the\n\nwall. (RR60:40, 65-66, 72-75; RR63:11; SX48-53). Detective Gallagher\n\ntestified:\n\n      There was blood everywhere. There was blood on the walls.\n      There were smears on the baseboards. She was wrapped in\n      some sheets and some blankets, and you could still see\n      multiple stab wounds all over her. It was a mess.\n\n(RR60:40; SX50, 51).    Several feet from her body was “a bloody palm\n\nprint or fingerprint on the hallway wall.” (RR60:43).\n\n      Fred’s body was found in the bedroom, lying on the floor about five\n\nfeet from Mildred. (RR60:40-41, 76; RR63:11; SX42-47).       That scene\n\nwas described as follows:\n\n      Mr. Finch suffered multiple stab wounds. He was almost in\n      a kneeling-type position on the floor, with his head down on\n      the floor. There were blankets and everything. Disarray. It\n      was blood everywhere in there. He had pajamas on, but his\n                                    4\n\f     pajamas were down around his ankles or his calves. So his\n     bare buttocks was very obvious to me, as I peered down the\n     hallway.\n\n(RR60:41).    There was blood on the bed, the walls, and the floor.\n\n(RR60:41; RR63:12). There was blood “up and down the hallway, from\n\nthe baseboard almost to the ceiling.” (RR60:63).\n\n     James tried to determine whether anything had been stolen from\n\nthe house. (RR68:230).    He saw “a gap in the closet.” (RR68:230).    A\n\nnumber of Fred’s suits were gone as were his shirts, hats and caps.\n\n(RR68:230). Fred’s gold and silver Rolex was also gone. (RR68:231-32).\n\n     Dr.     Edward McDonough performed an autopsy on Mildred.\n\n(RR61:46-47; SX71-83).    Mildred “had extensive sharp-force trauma\n\nover almost all the surfaces of her body. Particularly, above the waist.”\n\n(RR61:54). The total number of sharp-force wounds was “probably more\n\nthan 90.” (RR61:54).\n\n     Mildred suffered multiple injuries to the head. Dr. McDonough\n\ndescribed the following: a stab-wound to the right side of her chin; a v-\n\nshaped cut to her scalp; a superficial stab wound above her right\n\neyebrow; a three-inch cut on the back of her scalp; and, two stab wounds\n\nto her right-back shoulder. (RR61:63-65; SX75-76, 79-80). Mildred’s\n\n                                    5\n\fother wounds were grouped based on their location: the head; right-\n\nchest; abdomen; and back. (RR61:66; SX82). There were 20 individual\n\nstab wounds to Mildred’s abdomen.           (RR61:67; SX82).   Most were\n\nsuperficial, however, some entered the abdominal cavity. (RR61:67).\n\nThere were 17 wounds to Mildred’s back, some of which penetrated her\n\nright chest cavity.   (RR61:68-69).       There were “about 35 individual\n\nwounds of various widths and depths” to the right side of Mildred’s\n\nbody, from her armpit down to her thigh.           (RR61:69; SX70A, 83).\n\n“There’s a lot of wounds that are even confluent, where they’re so close\n\ntogether they actually blend together.” (RR61:71).        There were stab\n\nwounds to the left side of Mildred’s body. (RR61:71; SX71). There were\n\nfour or five stab wounds to the back of her left upper arm. (RR61:71;\n\nSX81). There were wounds to her right hand. (RR61:72; SX73). There\n\nwas a “through and through stab wound of the wrist” on her left arm.\n\n(RR61:72-74; SX74). Dr. McDonough estimated the depth of the stab\n\nwounds as five to six inches deep.         (RR61:68).   She had defensive\n\nwounds on her hands, wrists, and forearms. (RR61:66).\n\n     Many of the stab wounds affected Mildred’s organs. There was a\n\nstab wound to her right lung; her left lung; eleven stab wounds to the\n\n\n                                      6\n\fliver; her aorta was transected.         (RR61:75). Mildred also suffered a\n\n“fairly-significant blunt-force trauma, which consisted of a fracture of\n\nthe right humerus.” (RR61:67; SX82).             Almost every one of her ribs\n\nwas fractured, some in two places. (RR61:67-68).             Mildred’s cause of\n\ndeath was “multiple stab wounds of the torso.” (RR61:74).\n\n        Dr. Gilliland performed an autopsy on Fred.2 (RR61:47-48, 51-52;\n\nSX57-70, 70A).        Dr. Gilliland documented 21 sharp-force injuries on\n\nFred. (RR61:58).        Fred had a stab wound to the right side of his head\n\nthat was about an inch long. (RR61:79, 80; SX58, 65). He suffered five\n\nstab wounds to the left side of his trunk, injuring his left upper lung,\n\nheart, abdomen, liver, stomach and pancreas. (RR61:79-81; SX58, 62).\n\nThe approximate depth of these wounds is “up to six inches[.]”\n\n(RR61:80).      He suffered ten blunt and sharp-force wounds to his back.\n\n(RR61:80, 82; SX67, 59).        These injuries caused damage to Fred’s left\n\nlung and spleen as well as a fracture of the 11th rib. (RR61:80; SX67).\n\nHe suffered stab wounds to his arms.          (RR61:81; SX64).     The medical\n\nexaminer also “noted there were several cuts between the buttocks.”\n\n\n\n\n2   Dr. McDonough was present and observed Fred’s autopsy. (RR61:47-48).\n                                         7\n\f(RR61:83; SX61). Fred’s cause of death was “multiple stab wounds.”\n\n(RR61:83).\n\n       All of Mildred’s and Fred’s wounds are consistent with a single-\n\nedged knife. (RR61:58, 61). All of the wounds could have been inflicted\n\nby a single knife. (RR61:61, 88).\n\n                   Physical Evidence of the Crime\n\n       The Finch home appeared to have been burglarized. (RR60:37,\n\n43).   The point-of-entry appeared to be a window.     A couple of the\n\nwindow sills on the front of the house appeared to have been recently\n\ndamaged and there were two open windows.       (RR60:36, 55-57, 148-50;\n\nRR63:13; SX35, 37, 107-08).    The window in the front of the house was\n\nopen, but blocked on the inside by a heavy piece of furniture.\n\n(RR60:147, 149, 188; RR63:13; SX108, 110). A bent window screen in\n\nthe yard appeared to fit this window. (RR60:36, 56, 144, 182; SX35-37).\n\n       A window on the side of the house was also open. (RR60:149, 187;\n\nSX36-37).    There was an air conditioning window unit sitting in the\n\ngrass nearby.    (RR60:36, 145, 150; SX36-37). The cord for the unit\n\nstretched from the unit though the open window to the outlet where it\n\nwas still plugged in inside. (RR60:36, 145, 148; SX36-37, 107, 109). On\n\n\n                                    8\n\fthe inside of the house, the curtains were pulled away, consistent with\n\nsomeone coming through the side window from the outside to the inside.\n\n(RR60:150-51; SX109-10).\n\n      The home appeared to have been ransacked.            (RR63:12).    In the\n\nliving room, a stereo, and a cardboard box were stacked up by the front\n\ndoor. (RR60:39, 179). The box appeared to have been “stacked up for a\n\npurpose.” (RR60:204).      Inside the box were some suits and a raincoat.\n\n(RR60:107, 109, 179, 204; SX111). The black raincoat appeared to have\n\nblood on it. (RR60:180, 204).\n\n      In the kitchen, there was a bloody rag on the floor near the\n\nrefrigerator.    (RR60:37; RR63:12; SX41).          There was blood on the\n\nhandle of the refrigerator. (RR60:38).       On the kitchen table, there was\n\na Saturday-edition of the Sunday March 16th newspaper.3 (RR60:37-\n\n38, 109-10; RR61:197; SX112, 114, 116). The newspaper had blood on\n\nit. (RR60:37-38, 109-10; SX112, 114, 116).          The blood appeared to be\n\nan outline of a knife. (RR60:110, 125; SX116). “It looks like there was\n\n\n3 The Dallas Times Herald newspaper on the table was a “Sunday noon dog\nedition[.]” (RR61:197; SX114). This version of the Sunday paper was part of an\nedition that would have gone to press in the morning of Saturday, March 15, 1986.\n(RR61:197; SX114). It would have been available for sale at various over-the-\ncounter locations throughout the county “around 8:30, 9:00 o’clock Saturday\nmorning.” (RR61:197-98).\n                                        9\n\fblood on a knife tip and it was wiped off on the newspaper.” (RR60:178,\n\n209; SX112-16).\n\n     Police walked around the scene trying to find the murder weapon.\n\n(RR60:118, 197). It was never recovered. (RR60:127-28).\n\n                          The Investigation\n\n     On March 18th, the Crime Stoppers Unit received a tip from Kathy\n\nJohnson. (RR60:83, 85, 122).     Kathy knew about the stolen property\n\nand the type of weapon. (RR60:85). She provided Appellant’s name.\n\n(RR60:86).    Kathy met with police later in the day and provided\n\nAppellant’s brother’s name, Lonnie Thomas, and advised that Lonnie\n\nknew of the stolen property as well. (RR60:87, 122).\n\n     Detectives James Gallagher and Phillip Jones went to 4323\n\nElectra to speak with Lonnie.     (RR60:87; RR63:22).     Lonnie wasn’t\n\nhome, but they spoke with his mother, Shirley Baldwin, and his other\n\nbrother, Billy Thomas. (RR63:22).       Shirley told Jones that Appellant\n\nadmitted to the murders. (RR63:63). Jones requested and was granted\n\nconsent to enter the house. (RR63:23). Inside, Jones found a three-piece\n\nblack suit, an umbrella, and black-and-white shoes. (RR63:23). He did\n\nnot find a bloody knife or bloody clothing. (RR63:24).\n\n\n                                   10\n\f      Later that day, Billy called Jones to let him know that Lonnie had\n\nreturned home. (RR63:26).          Jones and Gallagher went back to the\n\nhouse on Electra. (RR63:26).       Lonnie agreed to accompany them back\n\nto the station. (RR60:87; RR63:26). Jones testified:\n\n      What Lonnie told me, en route from 4323 Electra to the\n      office, was that when Kenneth woke him up, he had been\n      stacking property in the house; that he asked him to come\n      out and help move some of the stuff. He walked outside and\n      he said, at that point, that the property had been taken out\n      of the back of a yellow car.\n\n(RR63:54).\n\n      At the station, Lonnie provided a written statement implicating\n\nAppellant.4 (RR60:88, 90, 124; RR63:30).          Lonnie told police that he\n\nsaw Appellant in possession of a bloody weapon.                   (RR60:127).\n\nDetectives were on their way to return Lonnie back to Electra when\n\nthey learned that Lonnie had recently disposed of some of the Finch’s\n\nproperty at a “makeshift dump” on the 4000 block of Hancock Street.\n\n(RR60:91-95; RR63:31; SX34D, 87-88, 94, 100).                Lonnie had not\n\nmentioned Hancock in his statement. (RR63:30). The detectives drove\n\nto the dump site where they recovered several hat boxes, black trash\n\n4Lonnie claimed to be home in bed with his girlfriend, Delores Easter. (RR60:93,\n131).\n                                       11\n\fbags containing clothing, and Fred’s brown briefcase.       (RR60:95-97;\n\nRR63:31; SX87-88, 94-99).\n\n     Lonnie was transported back to the station where he gave a\n\nvoluntary statement and was arrested. (RR60:98-99; RR63:32-33). This\n\ntime, Lonnie said that Kathy Johnson helped him dump the property.\n\n(RR63:32). He claimed that he did not call the police because he “was\n\nafraid that he would be charged or considered a suspect in the case.”\n\n(RR63:49)\n\n     Late that night, Appellant was arrested at the house on Electra,\n\nwhich is about four blocks from the Finch home. (RR60:49, 53, 103;\n\nRR63:35-36; SX34B, 225).     Appellant was wearing Fred’s Rolex watch.\n\n(RR60:106; RR63:36-37; SX219-21).\n\n                       The Hancock Dumpsite\n\n     At the Hancock dumpsite, police located a great deal of Fred’s\n\nproperty, including suitcases, clothing, suits, men’s hats, and hat boxes.\n\n(RR61:97-99, 104-10; SX5-14, 18-21, 23, 86-88, 94-101, 207). Hats and\n\nhat boxes were found under a white sheet. (RR61:100, 102, 104-10;\n\nSX87, 95). A brown hat box was found on top of a couch. (RR61:101;\n\nSX87, 98).    Two black garbage bags containing clothing were found\n\n\n                                    12\n\fnear the couch. (RR61:101-03; SX88, 95, 97). There was also a brown\n\nsatchel containing men’s dress shirts and a loaded Enfield .38-caliber\n\nrevolver in a holster. (RR61:97-98, 103-05, 123; SX84, 85, 87,5 97, 99,\n\n207).\n\n        Among the items collected from the dumpsite were: a men’s three-\n\npiece suit (SX23); a grey and red flannel suit (SX25); a grey plaid suit\n\ncontaining the label “Fred James Finch, Jr” and dated December 10,\n\n1982 (SX27); a grey suit containing the label “Custom Tailored for Fred\n\nFinch” (SX26); a yellow shirt (SX8); a light colored shirt (SX7); a blue\n\nand red plaid shirt (SX12); a blue striped shirt (SX11); a white and blue\n\nshirt (SX9); a gray shirt (SX10); a light-colored plaid shirt (SX6); a blue\n\npatterned shirt (SX13); a blue shirt with a white collar (SX5); a multi-\n\ncolored shirt (SX28); a silver patterned shirt (SX17); two Dobbs hats\n\n(SX19-20); a flannel newsies hat (SX23); a brown fur hat (SX101); a blue\n\nhat (SX21); a tweed hat (SX18); a straw hat; (SX14); a pair of brown\n\ngloves (SX93); three pairs of black gloves (SX102-04); a blue striped\n\nscarf (SX29); a brown suede jacket (SX16).6 (RR61:105-20).\n\n\n5 The gun and holster were released following Appellant’s 1987 trial. (RR61:116;\nSX87).\n6 The property from the Hancock dumpsite that was introduced into evidence\n\nrepresents about one-third of the property collected from that site. (RR61:124).\n                                       13\n\f      Bernard Blackmon7 testified that he worked for the Leonard\n\nCustom Tailoring Company in Cincinnati and the Ripley Shirt\n\nCompany in Dallas, selling tailored suits and tailored shirts.\n\n(RR61:190).      Blackmon sold Fred custom suits.           (RR61:193).    He\n\nidentified State’s Exhibit 26 as a custom-made suit that he sold Fred.\n\n(RR61:193; SX26).     He also ordered custom-tailored shirts for Fred as\n\nwell. (RR61:194-95; SX10-3, 17). The cuffs of these shirts are\n\nmonogramed with Fred’s initials, FJF. (RR61:195).\n\n                            Forensic Evidence\n\n      Appellant’s fingerprints were found on the inside portion of the\n\nwindow sill, on the inside of the window screen, and on the air\n\nconditioning unit. (RR60:215-16, 252-57; SX117-24).         The bloody palm\n\nand fingerprint found near Mildred’s body also belonged to Appellant.\n\n(RR60:111-14, 171-76, 217, 232-257; SX125-26, 202).            Police had no\n\ninformation suggesting that Appellant knew the Finches or had any\n\nreason to be at their home. (RR60:113-14).         Lonnie’s fingerprints did\n\nnot match those recovered from the Rose Lane address. (RR60:131).\n\n\n\n\n7Bernard Blackmon was deceased at the time of the 2014 trial. The transcript of\nhis prior testimony was read into the record. (RR61:188).\n                                      14\n\f     Appellant’s fingerprints were found on the Knox hat box recovered\n\nfrom the Hancock Street dumpsite. (RR60:221, 260; SX134, 202).\n\n     In 1986, Carolyn VanWinkle performed serological testing on the\n\nfollowing items: the black raincoat (SX111); some pillowcases; black\n\nand white shoes; a bedsheet and mattress pad; Mildred’s clothes; and\n\nthe sheets from around Mildred’s body. (RR61:15, 18-19, 21).         The\n\nraincoat tested positive for blood. (RR61:22; SX111). It was Fred’s and\n\nMildred’s blood. (RR61:22, 26; SX111). Further testing of the samples\n\nfrom the raincoat did not reveal the presence of any foreign blood.\n\n(RR61:28-29).   A presumptive test performed on the black-and-white\n\nshoes was positive for blood.   (RR61:35-38; SX30). The gold bedsheet\n\nand white mattress pad collected with Mildred’s body both “had a large\n\nquantity of blood and blood soaked into it.” (RR61:38-39).    Samples of\n\nthe blood corresponded to the Finches. (RR61:39).\n\n     A pink and green pillowcase that was received with Fred’s body by\n\nthe medical examiner was also tested.     (RR61:30-31).      “[T]here was\n\nsemen identified on the pillowcase.” (RR61:31).     “[S]permatozoa were\n\nidentified on that stain.” (RR61:33-34). A screening test performed on\n\n\n\n\n                                   15\n\fthe anal swab collected during Fred’s autopsy was positive for the\n\npresence of semen. (RR61:32-33, 43). The semen was Fred’s. (RR61:43).\n\n      Certain items of evidence were subjected to testing “for handler\n\nDNA or any epithelial cells that may have come off when somebody was\n\ncarrying them or maybe wearing them.” (RR61:128, 132-33; SX208-09).\n\nMildred’s pajama shirt contained human blood. (RR61:137).          There\n\nwere three available cuttings from the shirt, but only one sample\n\nyielded a genetic profile. (RR61:158; SX210). A sample of blood from\n\nMildred’s pajama shirt yielded a partial DNA profile, which was\n\nidentified as Mildred’s own blood.       (RR61:153-55). There were four\n\navailable cuttings from Mildred’s pajama pants. (RR61:159; SX210).\n\nOne sample yielded a partial profile that matched Mildred. (RR61:159;\n\nSX210). There were six available cuttings from the bedsheet from the\n\nFinch home. (RR61:160; SX210).          One sample yielded a full genetic\n\nprofile, which was that of Mildred. (RR61:161-62; SX210).        Several\n\npartial genetic profiles from the sheet were also a match to Mildred.\n\n(RR61:162-63; SX210). Testing of a hair curler yielded a partial profile\n\nmatched to Mildred. (RR61:163; SX210). Testing of a hair curler clip\n\nyielded a partial profile matched to Mildred.        (RR61:163; SX210).\n\n\n                                   16\n\fThree stains from the raincoat did not yield any DNA.       (RR61:164;\n\nSX210).    One stain from the raincoat, however, matched Mildred’s\n\nDNA. (RR61:164-65; SX210).     The cutting from a pillowcase matched\n\nFred’s DNA profile. (RR61:171-72; SX217).\n\n     Angela Fitzwater tested the anal swab from Fred’s rape kit.\n\n(RR61:169; SX218). Both the epithelial cell fraction and the sperm cell\n\nfraction matched Fred’s DNA profile. (RR61:170, 173-74; SX218). DNA\n\ntesting from Fred’s right-hand fingernail clippings was also a match to\n\nFred. (RR61:170; SX218).\n\n                        The Thomas Family\n\n     In March of 1986, Appellant, his mother (Shirley Thomas), his\n\nbrother (Lonnie Thomas), his sister (Shirley), and Lonnie’s girlfriend\n\n(Delores Easter) shared a home at 4323 Electra. (RR62:11-13, 28, 30,\n\n73, 81, 118-19). Lonnie and Easter occupied one of the bedrooms in the\n\nhouse.\n\n     On Saturday, March 15, 1986, Lonnie watched wrestling on\n\ntelevision, after which he and Easter went to bed. (RR62:74).    Early\n\nthe following morning, Appellant woke him up, “bringing in some\n\nclothing and bags and boxes.” (RR62:74).    He had “a suitcase, with a\n\n\n                                  17\n\fpistol in it. He had boxes with hats and clothes, and he had [sic] Rolex\n\nwatch on. (RR62:14).    Appellant wanted Lonnie to help him bring\n\neverything inside. (RR62:32, 75-76). Appellant put the property on the\n\nliving room couch, on the porch and in the back room.          (RR62:31).\n\nIncluded among the property were long-sleeve shirts with initials\n\nembroidered on them. (RR62:15-17). The initials did not correspond\n\nwith Appellant’s name. (RR62:15).        Appellant claimed that he got the\n\nproperty as payment for helping a lady “move something out of her\n\ngarage.” (RR62:76).\n\n     At one point, Appellant went into the bathroom.           (RR62:76).\n\nWhen Appellant came out, Lonnie saw a shirt lying in the bathtub.\n\n(RR62:77).   The shirt was covered in blood on the right side from the\n\nwrist to the elbow. (RR62:76-77).        Lonnie also saw a bloody knife in\n\nthe bedroom.    (RR62:78-79).       It was a long hunting-type knife.\n\n(RR62:78). It was about six inches long and had a “cream-colored speck\n\nwith brown” handle.    (RR62:78).         Appellant claimed that he had\n\nstabbed a dog. (RR62:13-14, 78).\n\n     Appellant showed Lonnie “an old model .38 Breakdown front side”\n\nfirearm. (RR62:79). The gun was in a briefcase. (RR62:80). Appellant\n\n\n                                    18\n\fwas wearing “a gold-band watch.”           (RR62:80-81; SX221).        After he\n\nshowed Lonnie the property, Appellant “basically kind of just sat down\n\nand fell asleep.”    (RR62:82).     When Lonnie woke up the following\n\nmorning, Appellant was gone. (RR62:83). The bloody shirt and knife\n\nwere also gone. (RR62:83).\n\n      That day, Appellant’s other brother, Billy,8 went to the house on\n\nElectra at about noon. (RR62:143).         He wanted his mother to pay him\n\nfor babysitting his nieces and nephew. (RR62:142-43).            At the house,\n\nBilly noticed some big boxes in the bedroom where Lonnie and Kenneth\n\nslept. (RR62:144, 177, 200). He did not see how the boxes got there.\n\n(RR62:177, 200).\n\n      On Monday, Appellant met up with his cousin Thomas Penagraph.\n\n(RR62:42, 43). Appellant went over to Thomas’s house, then Appellant,\n\nThomas, and Thomas’s girlfriend Brenda Jackson all went to the house\n\non Electra. (RR62:43-44). There, Appellant changed into a black suit.\n\n(RR62:45, 50; SX24). He showed Thomas “[t]he suede brown jacket. A\n\ncouple of hats . . . [and] some suits[.]”       (RR62:44-45; SX16, 18-19).\n\nAppellant was wearing a watch that was big and looked expensive.\n\n8Billy Thomas was deceased at the time of the 2014 trial.   The transcript of his\nprior testimony was read into the record. (RR62:140).\n                                      19\n\f(RR62:45; SX219-21). Thomas had not seen Appellant with that watch\n\nor that property before. (RR62:45-46, 52, 68). Appellant gave Thomas\n\none of the jackets and one of the hats. (RR62:46; SX16, 19).\n\n     On Tuesday, Lonnie heard on the radio that a lawyer and his wife\n\nhad been killed “in the South Dallas area, close to where I lived.”\n\n(RR62:85).    That day, Lonnie moved the property from Electra to his\n\ncousin Bobby Roy’s house. (RR62:86, 101).       Billy had told Lonnie of a\n\ncall that he had received from Kathy, “to get the stuff out of my mom’s\n\nhouse because my brother had killed some people.” (RR62:87).       Later,\n\nBilly called and told Lonnie to get rid of the property because the police\n\nwere looking for him. (RR62:87).         Lonnie put everything in a sheet\n\nand trash bags and he and Kathy took the property to Hancock.\n\n(RR62:88-89; SX87-88).     Afterward, he went back to the house on\n\nElectra. (RR62:90).\n\n     The police came and picked Lonnie up and took him to the station\n\nwhere he gave a statement.       (RR62:91, 132-35; SX223).        In this\n\nstatement Lonnie told Detective Gallagher that he saw Appellant with\n\nthe property on Sunday morning. (RR62:92-93).         He told them about\n\nthe bloody shirt. (RR62:93).   He did not say anything about the knife\n\n\n                                    20\n\for the gun or about dumping the property on Hancock. (RR62:93, 128-\n\n29).   The police were taking Lonnie home when they learned that\n\nsomeone had seen Lonnie dumping the property. (RR62:93, 122-23).\n\nLonnie realized that he had to be honest.                (RR62:123, 125).         On\n\nHancock, he pointed out the property that he and Kathy had dumped.\n\n(RR62:94). Lonnie was placed under arrest for murder.9 (RR62:94, 96).\n\nHe gave a second statement. (RR62:95; SX224). In this statement, he\n\ntold police about the bloody knife, the bloody shirt, the pistol, and how\n\nthe property moved from Electra to Hancock. (RR62:95, 135; SX224).\n\n       After Lonnie’s arrest, Billy started receiving calls from Appellant.\n\n(RR62:156-57).      During one call, Appellant said he was coming to the\n\nhouse to get his clothes. (RR62:158, 187). Appellant also said “[t]hat he\n\nwas going to kill us.” (RR62:159). During another call, Appellant said\n\n“[t]hat he was going to kill us all if he didn’t get what he wanted.”\n\n(RR62:160).     He wanted “[h]is money and clothes.” (RR62:161).                 The\n\nthreat to kill was directed at Billy and their mother. (RR62:163). Billy\n\ncalled the police. (RR62:188). He was told to call back if Appellant\n\nwent to the house. (RR62:188).\n\n9After Lonnie testified at the trial in 1987, his case was “dismissed for insufficient\nevidence.” (RR62:97, 137).\n                                         21\n\f        That night, Appellant returned to the Electra house. (RR62:164-\n\n65). Appellant and Billy discussed Lonnie and money.10 (RR62:164-65,\n\n205, 207, 216-17).        Appellant wanted Billy to give him $8,000.\n\n(RR62:165, 193). Appellant went to the back room, came back, pointed\n\na gun at Billy’s head and then pulled the trigger.11 (RR62:166, 193-94,\n\n205).     He pulled the trigger six times. (RR62:166, 194). Billy told\n\nAppellant that the police had called. (RR62:167).           Appellant said that\n\n“he didn’t know what the police were looking for him for unless they\n\nhad some money to give him.”             (RR62:167).       If Billy didn’t give\n\nAppellant his money or clothes, Appellant was going to kill the family.\n\n(RR62:167-68). Appellant was upset. (RR62:170).\n\n        Lonnie’s father, Lonnie Burrell,12 went to the house on Electra\n\nthat night. (RR62:225). When he arrived, Appellant was walking out.\n\n(RR62:226). Appellant asked where Lonnie was. (RR62:226). Burrell\n\nsaid Lonnie was probably in jail for something that Appellant did.\n\n10 On direct examination, Billy testified that the encounter with Appellant and the\ngun occurred on Tuesday night. On cross-examination, he testified that the\nencounter occurred on Monday night. (RR62:197, 205, 207, 209-14). His memory\nwas refreshed with his prior testimony wherein he testified that the encounter took\nplace on Tuesday. (RR62:209-15). He eventually testified that “maybe I had the\ndays mixed up.” (RR62:211).\n11 Billy had not previously seen a gun at the house on Electra. (RR62:200-01).\n12 Lonnie Burrell was deceased at the time of the 2014 trial. The transcript of his\n\nprior testimony was read into the record. (RR62:220).\n                                        22\n\f(RR62:226-27).    Appellant told Burrell that Lonnie did not know\n\nanything. (RR62:227). He said that Lonnie was not with him “during\n\nthe time.”   (RR62:227). Later that evening, coverage of the murders\n\nappeared on the news.           (RR62:228).   Appellant’s mother asked\n\nAppellant whether he killed them and Appellant said yes. (RR62:164,\n\n169-70, 217-18, 228). He said that “the dead can’t talk and he wasn’t\n\nthrough yet.”    (RR62:164). Appellant said that he was not finished\n\nkilling yet. (RR62:229).\n\n      Appellant was arrested later that night. (RR62:172, 229).\n\n                    Appellant’s Criminal History\n\n     The State presented evidence of Appellant’s criminal history and\n\nbad behavior while in prison:\n\n     On February 18, 1979, an 18-year-old Marvin Lindwood went to\n\nhis friend Vicki Calhoun’s house for drinks.          (RR63:68-69, 88).\n\nLindwood and Vicki were sitting around having a good time when\n\nAppellant came over. (RR63:69). Vicki invited him in. (RR63:69). For\n\nthe first couple of hours, everything went well but then Appellant tried\n\nto attack Vicki. (RR63:70).      In the kitchen “he had her in there up\n\nagainst the sink.    He was trying to pull her clothes off of her.”\n\n\n                                     23\n\f(RR63:70). Lindwood told Appellant to leave Vicki alone. (RR63:70,\n\n79). He and Appellant started fighting. (RR63:70, 79, 90). “He hit me.\n\nI hit him.”     (RR63:70).    At some point, Appellant left.   (RR63:71).\n\nLindwood stayed with Vicki to continue drinking and listening to music.\n\n(RR63:71). Later, Lindwood heard someone calling his name outside.\n\n(RR63:71). It was Appellant. (RR63:71).\n\n     “When [Lindwood] went to the door, [Appellant] was standing up\n\nout there acting like he wanted to apologize and all that there.”\n\n(RR63:71). He told Lindwood that he knew he was wrong and asked\n\nLindwood to apologize to Vicki for him. (RR63:71). He said he would\n\nnot return. (RR63:71). Appellant got up as if he were going to walk off.\n\n(RR63:71, 87). Lindwood turned to go inside. (RR63:71, 87, 90).      The\n\nlast thing he remembered was reaching for the screen door. (RR63:71-\n\n73, 90).   “That’s when [Appellant] stabbed [him] in the head with that\n\nscrewdriver.”    (RR63:72).   When Lindwood woke up, he was in the\n\nhospital and nearly a month had passed. (RR63:74).\n\n     The screwdriver penetrated Lindwood’s brain.              (RR63:75).\n\nLindwood suffered irreversible, permanent brain damage. (RR63:84).\n\nThe stabbing caused permanent damage to the left side of his body.\n\n\n                                     24\n\f(RR63:74-75). Lindwood suffered a loss of mobility to his left side.\n\n(RR63:74).\n\n     That same day, Billy, who was living with Appellant, Lonnie, their\n\nsister, and their mother, gave Appellant money to buy beer.\n\n(RR63:111). Appellant did not come back with any beer. (RR63:111,\n\n116-17). Instead, Appellant returned late. (RR63:111). Then, they got\n\ninto a fight during which Appellant cut Billy.13 (RR63:112). Appellant\n\nalso cut Billy’s friend, who happened to be at the house during the fight.\n\n(RR63:112-13). After the fight with Billy, Appellant went next-door, to\n\nhis ex-girlfriend Joyce Brown’s house. (RR63:101-02).       When Brown\n\nrefused to let him inside, Appellant broke her window. (RR63:102-03).\n\n     Appellant was tried for the offense against Lindwood.        He was\n\nconvicted of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and was\n\nsentenced to ten years’ confinement in the institutional division of the\n\nTexas Department of Criminal Justice. (RR60:223, 264-65; SX205).\n\n       In January of 1983, Michael Ferguson was arrested and jailed\n\nfor murder. (RR63:136).      He was assigned to a cell with Appellant.\n\n(RR63:137-38).    Initially, Appellant was “playing the nice-guy role.”\n13 On direct examination, Billy testified that he was cut on his forehead.\n(RR63:112). On cross, Billy admitted that it could have been on his chest.\n(RR63:115).\n                                    25\n\f(RR63:138). Appellant was religious and read scripture. (RR63:138).\n\nOnce Ferguson let his guard down, however, Appellant became\n\naggressive.   (RR63:138-39).    Appellant “started coming on to me\n\nsexually, of course. Extortion. Wanted to know if I had money and\n\nwhatnot.” (RR63:138-39).   Appellant was “[d]emanding.” (RR63:139).\n\nHe was a “predator.” (RR63:142).        Ferguson was transferred out of\n\nAppellant’s tank. (RR63:140-41).\n\n       On June 13, 1983, Steven McCarroll was in the Dallas County\n\nJail, incarcerated on a charge of aggravated robbery.       (RR63:150).\n\nMcCarroll was assigned to Appellant’s tank.      (RR63:150). That day,\n\nMcCarroll saw Appellant “raping another inmate.”            (RR63:151).\n\nMcCarroll was sleeping on the bunk on one side of the cell. (RR63:152-\n\n53). Appellant was on the bunk on the other side with “the sheet up\n\nover the top of the bunk.”     (RR63:152).    The sheet fell down and\n\nMcCarroll saw Appellant on top of the other inmate. (RR63:152). The\n\ninmate was screaming. (RR63:153).\n\n       The following day, when McCarroll got out of the shower\n\nAppellant approached him “want[ing] me to suck his dick.” (RR63:154).\n\nMcCarroll “tried to get away from him. Ended up with a broke nose and\n\n\n                                   26\n\ftwo black eyes.” (RR63:154).    “So he was going to try to force me to\n\nsuck his dick.” (RR63:154).\n\n       On August 25, 1983, then-17-year-old Larry Dean Turner was\n\nincarcerated at the Dallas County Jail on an aggravated robbery\n\ncharge. (RR63:163, 165, 173). Appellant befriended Turner. (RR63:168).\n\nAt first, Appellant “got [Turner] to wash his clothes for him.”\n\n(RR63:167). Then, he tried to get Turner to be “[h]is kid.” (RR63:167).\n\n“All the big peoples [sic] up there. You had younger people on the tank\n\nwith them at that time.” (RR63:168).      Appellant wanted Turner to\n\n“[r]ide with him: Be his bitch.” (RR63:168). Turner explained that\n\nmeant that Turner was supposed to be Appellant’s “woman.           Kid.\n\nWhere I do sexual stuff for him, and stuff like that there.” (RR63:168).\n\nAdditionally, “If he told me to have sex with people, I have to have sex\n\nwith people.” (RR63:169).\n\n     Over the course of the four and a half years Appellant was\n\nincarcerated at the Dallas County Jail, he was moved multiple times.\n\n(RR63:181-82).    Among the reasons for his moves were: placing in\n\nadministrative custody; assaultive towards other inmates; causing\n\n\n\n\n                                   27\n\ftrouble in tank; fighting; making sexual threats; unable to get along\n\nwith others; and to keep down trouble. (RR63:182; SX228).\n\n      Appellant was released from prison on June 1, 1984. (RR63:187;\n\nSX226).    He was required to report to his parole officer, Linda Nelson,\n\non a monthly basis but he failed to do so. (RR63:186, 188). Appellant\n\nwas “unstable with his residence” and he “did not maintain stable\n\nemployment.” (RR63:192-93). While on parole, Appellant tried to stab\n\nhis mother. (RR63:189). He had a parole violation hearing after which\n\nhe was ordered to go to a halfway house for six months.14 (RR63:189).\n\nAppellant absconded from the halfway house. (RR63:190).\n\n      Records relating to Appellant’s disciplinary incidents in prison\n\nwere also admitted.       (RR65:36; SX245).        While in prison, Appellant\n\nengaged in the following conduct: he created a disturbance by flooding\n\nhis cell (twice); he used indecent or vulgar language; he threw his tray\n\nout of his cell; he threatened an officer, telling him,        “If you put me on\n\nthat list again, I will do something to your ass”; Appellant refused to\n\nobey an order (multiple times); he got into a fistfight with another\n\n\n14 At the hearing, Appellant’s mother denied that Appellant had assaulted her; she\ntestified that she wanted him arrested for a few days and she knew she would have\nto tell the police something serious. (RR63:196-97). The assault against Appellant’s\nmother was reduced to a Class C misdemeanor. (RR63:196).\n                                        28\n\finmate; he threw two glasses of water at an officer, striking him on the\n\nface and chest; he was found in possession of contraband (multiple\n\ntimes); and, he threatened an officer, telling him, “I’m going to burn\n\nyour ass.” (RR65:37-40; SX245).\n\n                            Appellant’s Case\n\n      Appellant’s cousin, Anthony Penagraph, testified that he and\n\nAppellant grew up “over there in Frazier Court.” (RR65:43).          It was\n\ndifficult there because in that area “you go to the store, you go to school,\n\nyou had to fight. And Kenneth was not the type of person that was a\n\nfighting person.”   (RR65:44).    Anthony testified that Appellant was\n\npicked on and had to be rescued a couple of times.         (RR65:47).     If\n\nAppellant had to defend himself, however, he would. (RR65:56).\n\n      Appellant’s mother worked a lot. (RR66:78). According to several\n\nof Appellant’s cousins, Shirley treated Appellant differently than her\n\nother children. (RR65:51; RR66:80, 129). “[W]hen it came to Kenneth .\n\n. .   she didn’t do too much for him.       Just to get by.”    (RR65:51).\n\nAppellant did not have a father figure growing up. (RR66:77).\n\n      According to Anthony, Appellant “was a little slow[.]” (RR65:49).\n\nAppellant made it through school but “they would help you get through\n\n\n                                     29\n\fthose     grades.”   (RR65:49).   His        grades   were   “low.”   (RR65:49).\n\nAppellant’s cousin Cynthia Penagraph Rice also believed that Appellant\n\nwas slower than others. (RR66:130). She testified that:\n\n        We always thought that. Because sometimes it will take\n        him, like, quite a minute to kind of catch on. He would say,\n        “What you say?” You know, he was slow.\n\n(RR66:131).\n\n        When he was 15, Appellant received a head injury at Fair Park.\n\n(RR65:52; RR66:19). “It was a guy jumped on him out there and hit him\n\nin the head with some object. And he been acting different ever since.”\n\n(RR65:52).     After Appellant’s head injury, Appellant “kind of drifted\n\naway a little bit.” (RR66:84). He was “[m]ore quiet.” (RR66:85). After\n\nhis head injury, “he seem [sic] to get a little slower.” (RR66:132).\n\n        Appellant’s cousin Bobby testified that Appellant never did any\n\ndrugs around him. (RR66:90).       He had seen him drink beer, however.\n\n(RR66:90).\n\n        Rice was surprised when she learned that Appellant was arrested\n\nfor the Finch murders. (RR66:135). She testified that Appellant is “not\n\nthat type.” (RR66:135). She did not think that Appellant could have\n\ncommitted the offense by himself. (RR66:135).\n\n                                        30\n\f      Rodney Turner is Appellant’s half-brother.15 (RR66:96). Growing\n\nup, Turner had only brief interaction with Appellant. (RR66:96). In\n\n1990, however, he and Appellant reconnected by writing letters when\n\nthey were both in prison. (RR66:97). The men encouraged each other\n\nthrough their letters. (RR66:97). Appellant would include in his letters\n\ncitations to scripture for Turner to look up in the Bible. (RR66:106).\n\nWhen Turner was let out on parole, he visited Appellant in the Dallas\n\nCounty Jail. (RR66:101-02). During their twice-weekly visits, the men\n\ndiscussed religion. (RR66:102). Appellant is able to discuss the Bible,\n\nscriptures, “you know - - just helpful things.”          (RR66:102).     Turner\n\nbrought Appellant’s mother to visit him a couple of times. (RR66:103).\n\nShe appeared supportive of him during the visits, but “when she got in\n\nthe car, was something totally different.” (RR66:103).\n\n      Several detention officers who have supervised Appellant in the\n\nDallas County Jail since he was transferred from prison in October\n\n2010 testified that Appellant does not cause problems in the jail.\n\n(RR67:19-21, 23-24, 41, 50; RR68:22, 25-26, 28). Van Similine testified\n\n\n15 At the time of his testimony, Turner was incarcerated as the result of a parole\nviolation on charges of aggravated sexual assault and burglary of a habitation.\n(RR66:97-98).      Turner admitted that he has ten felony convictions and is a\nregistered sex offender. (RR66:106).\n                                        31\n\fthat Appellant “stays to himself. Don’t [sic] cause no [sic] problems.”\n\n(RR67:41).   In his cell, Appellant is “[e]ither reading or sleeping.”\n\n(RR67:41). Appellant reads “novels off the law library cart.” (RR67:45).\n\nDuring Appellant’s recreation time, he goes to the gym and walks or\n\nplays basketball. (RR67:42). Curfey Anderson described Appellant as\n\n“[i]nstitutionalized.” (RR67:24).\n\n     Defense expert, James Aiken, a prison consultant, reviewed the\n\nrecords detailing Appellant’s confinement history.       (RR67:67, 74).\n\nAccording to Aiken, since he has been incarcerated, Appellant has been\n\non a “predictable scale.” (RR67:83).       Appellant has “gone from\n\ndisruptive behavior, down, down, down, to compliant behavior[.]”\n\n(RR67:83).   Aiken opined that Appellant “can be adequately managed\n\nfor an extended period of time, without causing unusual risk to staff,\n\ninmates or the general public.” (RR67:97). If he is placed in general\n\npopulation, “[h]is vulnerability level will be high. His adjustment level\n\nwould be excellent.” (RR67:97).\n\n                 Appellant’s Psychological Experts\n\n     Dr. Jim Hom, a neuropsychologist, evaluated Appellant’ brain\n\nfunctioning in 1987.     (RR65:82, 91).     Dr. Hom administered the\n\n\n                                    32\n\fHalstead-Reitan Neuropsychological Test Battery. (RR65:88).                On the\n\nWAIS-II,16 a “measure of intelligence,”            Dr. Hom determined that\n\nAppellant’s reading level is at a fourth grade level,17 his spelling below a\n\nthird grade level, and math below a third grade level. (RR65:110, 115).\n\nAppellant scored a verbal IQ of 73, a performance IQ of 85, and a full-\n\nscale IQ of 77. (RR65:118).         In his report, Dr. Hom noted that, with\n\nregard to Appellant’s low scores, “it is likely that these performances\n\nrepresent poor education experience.” (RR65:123; DX7).\n\n      Appellant performed well on the Tactual Performance Test, “a test\n\nof   psychomotor      problem     solving,    incidental    memory      learning.”\n\n(RR65:132). “This is a very challenging test.” (RR65:133).              Appellant\n\nperformed well on the Trail Making Test, Part A, a “test of attention\n\nand concentration[.]” (RR65:134). Appellant demonstrated no problems\n\non tests of vision, hearing, touch, and sensation.                    (RR65:135).\n\nAppellant’s ability for “inscription” using his left hand was “quite\n\nstrong” despite a history of being stabbed on his left arm. (RR65:135;\n\nDX7).\n\n\n16The current version of this test is the WAIS-IV. (RR65:111).\n17Given Appellant’s reading level, the results of two tests were considered invalid:\nthe Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and the Cornel Health\nIndex. (RR65:89-90).\n                                         33\n\f     Dr. Hom testified that Appellant’s “test results are consistent with\n\nsomeone who has what I believe is a significant head injury of one sort\n\nor another.” (RR65:102-03). He assessed Appellant’s intelligence in the\n\n“low 70 range” and his academic abilities at the third and fourth grade,\n\nlevel. (RR65:103). He opined that Appellant has “significant problems\n\nin reasoning and thinking,” and difficulty in sequencing, concentrating,\n\nlanguage and function. (RR65:103-04). He described Appellant’s verbal\n\nmemory as “moderately to severely impaired.” (RR65:105). He also\n\nshowed “mild motor and sensory difficulties.” (RR65:107).        Dr. Hom\n\nconceded that during testing Appellant was, at times, nonchalant and\n\n“[r]eluctant to perform.” (RR65:120, 125, 128; DX7).\n\n     Dr. Antoinette McGarrahan, a psychologist specializing in forensic\n\npsychology and neuropsychology, performed a neuropsychological\n\nevaluation of Appellant in 2012.      (RR66:15-16).      Dr. McGarrahan\n\nadministered 30 to 35 tests over the course of two days. (RR66:21). Dr.\n\nMcGarrahan measured Appellant’s full-scale IQ at 71. (RR66:23). She\n\nplaced this score in “what we used to call ‘mildly mentally retarded’\n\nrange to borderline functioning[.]”      (RR66:23).   She noted that the\n\ninterval of Appellant’s IQ is “essentially plus or minus five points,’ thus\n\n\n                                    34\n\fplacing his true score somewhere in the range of 66-76. (RR66:29-30).\n\nShe observed “significant deficits in [Appellant’s] academic skills” and\n\nmild to moderate memory impairment.                (RR66:23).       Based on the\n\nresults of her evaluation, Dr. McGarrahan concluded that Appellant is\n\nintellectually disabled.18 (RR66:24).\n\n      During the evaluation, Dr. McGarrahan learned that Appellant\n\nwas raised in “the projects” and that his family was poor. (RR66:18).\n\nDr. McGarrahan also pointed out the fact that Appellant’s mother\n\nsmoked and drank alcohol while she was pregnant with Appellant.\n\n(RR66:26). And, Appellant was born with the umbilical cord wrapped\n\naround his neck while his mother was in a car on the way to the\n\nhospital. (RR66:26).       He was never placed in special education but he\n\ndid not learn to drive; he had problem making change; he had difficulty\n\nusing a phone book. (RR66:18, 25). He had “very few jobs over his life.”\n\n(RR66:18).        Appellant was a loner and had difficulty getting along\n\nwith others.     (RR66:25).      He does not have “a psychiatric history.”\n\n(RR66:19).\n\n\n\n\n18Intellectual disability was previously referred to as mental retardation. At trial,\nthe terms were used interchangeably.\n                                         35\n\f     Dr. McGarrahan testified that, consistent with Dr. Hom’s\n\nfindings, in both sets of testing, the primary areas in which Appellant\n\ndemonstrated impairment are reasoning, logical thinking, planning,\n\nand problem solving. (RR66:33).\n\n      On cross-examination, Dr. McGarrahan testified that the history\n\nAppellant gave her “wasn’t quite accurate.” (RR66:36). Appellant told\n\nDr. McGarrahan that “he had a wonderful childhood; that there were no\n\nproblems; that he had great relationships with his family members;\n\nthat he did okay in school.” (RR66:36). Dr. McGarrahan conceded that\n\nAppellant is capable of lying to avoid criminal responsibility.\n\n(RR66:53). She acknowledged that when Appellant was interviewed by\n\na reporter, he said that on the day of the murders he went to church\n\nwith his girlfriend in the morning and then had supper at his father’s\n\nhouse. (RR66:52-53). He also told the reporter that there was no proof\n\nthat he committed the murders because the police did not have a\n\nweapon. (RR66:52).\n\n\n\n\n                                  36\n\f      Psychiatrist Dr. Jaye Crowder became involved in Appellant’s\n\ncase in 1987.19 (RR66:140-42).        Back then, Dr. Crowder performed a\n\nmental status exam, conducted background interviews, and reviewed\n\nAppellant’s medical records. (RR66:142). Dr. Crowder was concerned\n\nthat Appellant had suffered a traumatic brain injury so he referred him\n\nto Dr. Hom for testing. (RR66:142). Dr. Hom’s testing confirmed the\n\npresence of central nervous system damage. (RR66:144). According to\n\nDr. Crowder, Appellant saw difficulty with abstract reasoning.\n\n(RR66:145). “So, in other words, it was more difficult for him to assess\n\nthe   likely   consequences     of   particular   behavior.”      (RR66:145).\n\nAdditionally, “you have typically some impulsiveness and irritability\n\nthat goes with this so that people can overreact in an aggressive way[.]”\n\n(RR66:145).\n\n      Dr. Crowder examined Appellant on January 24, 2013 and again\n\non July 3, 2014. (RR66:146, 153). Appellant remembered him from\n\ntheir 1987 interaction. (RR66:149-50). In the 2013 exam, Dr. Crowder\n\nspent about an hour with Appellant and performed a basic psychiatric\n\n19Dr. Crowder testified to his memory of his 1987 examination. (RR66:151). He no\nlonger has his notes from that time. (RR66:151). He no longer had the notes from\nthe interview he conducted with Appellant’s mother and uncle. (RR66:152). Other\nthan the mother and uncle, Dr. Crowder could not recall who he interviewed.\n(RR66:152).\n                                       37\n\finterview and a Montreal Cognitive Assessment. (RR66:146, 150). He\n\nconcluded that Appellant suffered from “major cognitive disorder due to\n\ntraumatic brain damage and intellectual disability.”         (RR66:148).\n\nRegarding Appellant’s adaptive functioning, Dr. Crowder opined that\n\nAppellant has difficulty in interaction, trouble with employment, and\n\ndid not perform well academically. (RR66:157-58). In Dr. Crowder’s\n\nopinion, the probability of Appellant being a future danger is low.\n\n(RR66:149).    He admitted, however, that an absolute prediction of\n\nfuture danger cannot be made. (RR66:162). And, he conceded that he\n\ntestified at Appellant’s prior trial that Appellant “is certainly a danger\n\nif he’s not treated and not put in a structured setting.” (RR66:164).\n\nDr. Crowder also conceded his prior testimony that Appellant’s alibi –\n\nthat he was with his girlfriend between midnight and six in the\n\nmorning – was easily refutable and not very believable. (RR66:169).\n\n                    The State’s Case-in-Rebuttal\n\n     Melodye Nelson, a 25-year veteran of TDCJ, testified as an expert\n\non the prison system in Texas.    (RR68:144). She is the senior warden\n\nof two correctional facilities located in the Gatesville area. (RR68:144).\n\nShe has previously served as a major at a high-security male prison\n\n\n                                    38\n\ffacility. (RR68:146). “Our majors are what we consider our chiefs of\n\nsecurity. They are the highest-ranking security supervisors that we\n\nhave.”   (RR68:146).    Nelson testified generally about the types of\n\nfacilities, number of inmates and guards statewide, and how inmates\n\nare classified within the system. (RR68:144-45).\n\n     Inmates in TDCJ are classified “in a custody level that is suitable\n\nfor the safety and security of the institution.” (RR68:151). Among the\n\nfactors considered are the inmate’s history of incarceration and prior\n\njail conduct, the length of his sentence, and the inmate’s behavior and\n\nattitude. (RR68:152).   General Population 1, or “G1,” includes those\n\ninmates who are considered “minimum custody.” (RR68:153).         A G1\n\nmay be a trustee, which allows him to live and work outside of the\n\nfacility’s perimeter fences. (RR68:153). General Population 2, or “G2,”\n\nis the largest percentage of the general inmate population. (RR68:153).\n\nA G2 may live and work in a dormitory. (RR68:153). A G2 is allowed to\n\nwork anywhere inside the secure perimeter. (RR68:163).\n\n     General Population 3, or “G3,” includes inmates serving 50 years\n\nor more. (RR68:153). G3s may live in dormitories. (RR68:157). They\n\nare allowed to work, so long as they do not “have access to multiple\n\n\n                                  39\n\fareas of the facility.”   (RR68:158).    General Population 4, or “G4,”\n\nincludes those inmates who have multiple disciplinary infractions.\n\n(RR68:153).       G4s are “housed in cell blocks, two-man cells.”\n\n(RR68:182). They have fewer work opportunities. (RR68:182). General\n\nPopulation 5, or “G5,” are those inmates who are “chronic-rule\n\nviolators[.]” (RR68:153). G5s live on cell blocks and are not allowed\n\ncontact visits.   (RR68:182).     Their ability to purchase from the\n\ncommissary is reduced. (RR68:183). Finally, administrative segregation\n\nis “a classification outside of general population.” (RR68:154). These\n\noffenders are “housed singularly . . . [and they] recreate individually[.]”\n\n(RR68:154).\n\n     An inmate coming into TDCJ with a life sentence is classified as a\n\nG3 upon arrival. (RR68:155).     A capital murderer with a life sentence\n\nwill be initially classified and housed with all other G3s. (RR68:157).\n\nA G3 will change classification to a G2 after ten years of incarceration if\n\nhe has never taken a hostage or escaped a secure correctional facility.\n\n(RR68:162).\n\n     Nelson testified that, on average, there are about 15,000 assaults\n\nin prison each year.      (RR68:165).    This figure includes inmate-on-\n\n\n                                    40\n\finmate assaults as well as inmate-on-staff assaults. (RR68:165).              In\n\nprison, murders occur as well. (RR68:166).            There have been murders\n\nof inmates, guards, and civilian contractors. (RR68:166).\n\n       Dr. Richard Hughes, an educational psychologist, testified that\n\nstudents in the Dallas Independent School District (DISD) are routinely\n\nadministered achievement tests and intelligence tests.               (RR68:190).\n\nDr. Hughes reviewed records of Appellant’s scores on the California\n\nTest   of   Mental   Maturity   and        the    Iowa   Test   of   Educational\n\nDevelopment.    (RR68:190, 192-93; SX246-247).             Both tests have an\n\naverage score of 100 with a standard deviation of 15.                (RR68:192).\n\nBecause these tests are group-administered, they are less reliable than\n\nan individualized testing experience. (RR68:208).\n\n       Appellant was administered the California Test of Mental\n\nMaturity when he was in second grade in May of 1973. (RR68:200).\n\nThe California Test of Mental Maturity is “a group-administered\n\nmeasure of intelligence.” (RR68:198).            Appellant scored a 78 language\n\nIQ, a 92 non-language IQ, and an 82 total IQ. (RR68:198).\n\n       Appellant was administered the Iowa test in September of 1975.\n\n(RR68:207).    This test includes sections on reading, language arts,\n\n\n                                      41\n\fmath, social studies, science, the use of sources,20 and a composite.\n\n(RR68:195). On the reading portion, his score of 91 falls within the\n\naverage range. (RR68:196). On the language arts section, he scored a\n\n78, which falls within the borderline range. (RR68:196).                      Math was\n\nAppellant’s highest score; he scored a 97-98, which is just below the\n\naverage score of 100.           (RR68:197).        On the social studies portion,\n\nAppellant scored an 89-90, which is “one foot in the low-average range.\n\nThe other in the average range.” (RR68:197). On the science portion,\n\nAppellant scored an 83. (RR68:197). On the use of sources portion, he\n\nscored a 93. (RR68:197).            On the composite portion, he scored at the\n\n88-89 level. (RR68:197).\n\n         Dr. Hughes also reviewed Appellant’s grades.               Dr. Hughes noted\n\nthat “[g]rades are not good reflections of intellectual capacity.”\n\n(RR68:201).          Indeed, grades measure only “a student’s ability or\n\n20   Dr. Hughes described the Use of Sources portion as follows:\n\n         The Use of Sources is a sub-test designed to see how a student can\n         utilize sources to pursue answers to problems.\n\n         For example, multiple-choice questions might be posed that says in\n         order to find the capital of the state of Texas, you would look in A, a\n         dictionary; B, an encyclopedia; C, D, and choices like that, to see if they\n         can select the correct source to obtain information that they are\n         pursuing.\n\n(RR68:195).\n                                             42\n\fwillingness to comply, whether they bring their homework assignment\n\nin on time or whether they push through an extra-credit project or\n\nwhether they complete their class work assignment.”          (RR68:201).\n\nGrades    do   not   measure    cognitive   functioning.     (RR68:201).\n\nElementary school children are evaluated using a numerical system,\n\ngiving grades of one through four. (RR68:199-200). A one is assigned\n\nfor “rapid progress,” a two for “satisfactory progress,” a three for\n\n“acceptable progress,” and a four for “little or no progress.” (RR68:200).\n\nIn junior high and high school, students are given grades of A through\n\nF. (RR68:199).\n\n     In his elementary years, Appellant received a number of 3s and\n\n4s. (RR68:203). In sixth grade, Appellant received Bs, Cs, and Ds.\n\n(RR68:204). In seventh grade he received Ds and Fs. (RR68:203). In\n\neighth grade he received all Fs. (RR68:203). When Appellant started\n\nattending Metro North in tenth grade, he received Bs and Cs.\n\n(RR68:203). Appellant was moved to Metro North after his head injury\n\nat Fair Park. (RR68:210).      Metro North is “an alternative regular-\n\neducation program that was on a special class placement for\n\nhandicapped students.” (RR68:204).\n\n\n                                    43\n\f     Appellant’s grades stand in contrast to his test scores, which\n\nreflect an ability to do well in school. (RR68:201-02).   Had Appellant\n\napplied himself in school, his grades would have been better.\n\n(RR68:202).   There is no evidence in Appellant’s DISD records that he\n\nwas ever placed in a special education program. (RR68:207).       “The\n\nrecords from Dallas ISD indicate his education was all offered within\n\nthe general education program.”     (RR68:207).    Notably, Appellant’s\n\nschool records “are not consistent with a student that’s mentally\n\nretarded.” (RR68:207).\n\n     Forensic psychologist and neuropsychologist, Dr. Randy Price,\n\ntestified that Appellant does not meet the definition of intellectually\n\ndisabled as that term is described in Special Issue No. One. (RR69:14).\n\nDr. Price became involved in Appellant’s case in 2003. (RR69:18). Dr.\n\nPrice was scheduled to interview Appellant on July 13, 2014, but he was\n\nunable to do so as Appellant refused.

While it is true that Wilson was\n\n\n                                     45\n\fdisqualified from assisting in the prosecution of Appellant’s case, the\n\nelected district attorney and his other assistants were not.\n\n        Issue 38: The trial court properly overruled Appellant’s motion\n\nfor mistrial during the competency trial when the prosecutor referred to\n\nthe “murder weapon.” Alternatively, any alleged error was cured by the\n\ntrial court’s instruction to disregard.\n\n        Issue 39:    Appellant’s objection to the prosecutor’s question\n\nduring the competency trial regarding the 1987 reversal of Appellant’s\n\npunishment is not properly before this Court. Regardless, the same\n\ninformation was later received elsewhere without objection.\n\n        Issue 40-41: The evidence is both legally and factually sufficient\n\nto prove Appellant’s competency to stand trial.\n\n        Issue 42:     The trial court properly overruled Appellant’s\n\nobjection to Dr. Price’s testimony that Appellant exhibits traits\n\nconsistent with anti-social personality disorder.      Alternatively, any\n\nalleged error is harmless.\n\n        Issue 43:   Although Dr. Price testified regarding Appellant’s\n\nlack of remorse during a sub rosa hearing, he did not do so before the\n\njury.\n\n\n                                     46\n\f       Issue 44: The trial court did not err in admitting a silhouette of\n\na knife as a demonstrative aid.      Alternatively, any alleged error is\n\nharmless.\n\n       Issue 45:   The trial court properly admitted the photographs\n\nfrom Mildred’s and Fred’s autopsies as they help to explain the nature\n\nand extent of their injuries.      Alternatively, any alleged error is\n\nharmless.\n\n       Issue 46: The trial court did not err in overruling Appellant’s\n\nobjection to the victim-impact testimony from the Finches’ son-in-law,\n\nJames Belt, Jr.\n\n       Issue 47-48: Appellant failed to prove by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that he was intellectually disabled. The jury’s answer to the\n\nintellectual disability special issue was not so against the great weight\n\nand preponderance of the evidence so as to be manifestly unjust.\n\n       Issue 49: The evidence is legally sufficient to support the jury’s\n\ndecision to find that Appellant is a future danger.\n\n       Issue 50: The trial court did not err in overruling Appellant’s\n\nrequested jury instructions regarding significantly sub-average general\n\n\n\n\n                                    47\n\fintellectual functioning.     One of the proffered instructions was\n\nincorrect. The other was a comment on the weight of the evidence.\n\n       Issue 51: The trial court did not err in overruling Appellant’s\n\nrequest that the jury not be required to be unanimous regarding the\n\nintellectual disability special issue.   Appellant presents no authority\n\nmandating such an instruction.\n\n       Issue 52: The trial court did not err in overruling Appellant’s\n\nrequest for an instruction in the punishment charge that Lonnie\n\nThomas was an accomplice witness. He points to no authority that this\n\ninstruction is required in a punishment charge.\n\n       Issue 53: The trial court did not err in overruling Appellant’s\n\nrequest for an anti-parties charge. Contrary to the statements in his\n\nbrief, the guilt-innocence instruction did not include a parties’\n\ninstruction.\n\n       Issue 54: The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying\n\nAppellant’s motion, filed prior to sentencing, for an additional inquiry\n\ninto Appellant’s competency to stand trial. Appellant failed to present\n\nevidence of a material change in circumstances suggesting that\n\nAppellant’s mental status had deteriorated.\n\n\n                                    48\n\f       Issue 55: Appellant’s claim that the evidence is insufficient to\n\nsupport his conviction for capital murder presents nothing for this\n\nCourt’s review. Appellant was retried on punishment only. His guilt\n\nwas not at issue.\n\n     Issues 56-67:     The trial court properly denied Appellant’s\n\nchallenges to the death penalty. Appellant concedes that this Court has\n\npreviously overruled these issues.\n\n                             ARGUMENT\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE NOS. 1-7: THE TRIAL COURT DID        NOT ERR\nIN DENYING APPELLANT’S BATSON CHALLENGES.\n\n\n       In Issues 1 through 7, Appellant contends that the trial court\n\nerred in overruling his objection based on Batson v. Kentucky, 476\n\nU.S.79 (1986), to the State’s use of peremptory challenges on\n\nprospective jurors Neena Biswas, Leon Tilley, Deborah Moore, Pronsak\n\nNohe, Cassie Figures, Mary McGowan, Artherine Prieston, and Martha\n\nBarbosa. (Appellant’s Brief pp. 34-50). These contentions lack merit\n\nand should be overruled.\n\n                           Applicable Law\n\n     The U.S. Constitution prohibits the use of peremptory challenges\n\nto exclude prospective jurors on the basis of race. See Batson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n                                     <span class=\"page\">49</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\fat 85; Watkins v.

Crim. App. 2008).\n\nUnder Batson, a defendant must first make a prima facie showing that\n\nthe prosecution exercised its peremptory challenges on the basis of race.\n\nReed v. Quarterman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">555</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 368 (5th Cir. 2009). If the defendant\n\nmakes that showing, the burden shifts to the prosecutor to present race-\n\nneutral explanations for striking the jurors in question. Id. The court\n\nmust then determine whether the defendant has carried his burden of\n\nproving purposeful discrimination. Id.\n\n      At the second step of this process, the proponent of the strike need\n\nonly tender an explanation that is race-neutral. Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at\n\n447. The ultimate plausibility of that race-neutral explanation is to be\n\nconsidered as part of the third step of the analysis, in which the trial\n\ncourt determines whether the opponent of the strike (usually the\n\ndefendant) has satisfied his burden of persuasion to establish by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that the strike was indeed the product of\n\nthe proponent’s racial discrimination.        Id.   Whether the opponent\n\nsatisfies his burden of persuasion to show that the proponent’s facially\n\nrace-neutral explanation for his strike is pre-textual, not genuine, is a\n\nquestion of fact for the trial court to resolve in the first instance. Id.\n\n\n                                      50\n\f       This Court should not overturn the trial court’s resolution of the\n\nBatson issue unless it determines that the trial court’s ruling was\n\nclearly erroneous. See Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 447-48. In assaying the\n\nrecord for clear error, vel non, this Court should consider the entire\n\nrecord of voir dire; it need not limit itself to arguments or considerations\n\nthat the parties specifically called to the trial court’s attention so long\n\nas those arguments or considerations are manifestly grounded in the\n\nappellate record. Id. at 448. A trial court’s conclusion that a facially\n\nrace-neutral explanation for a peremptory challenge is genuine, rather\n\nthan a pretext, should be given great deference and reversed only when\n\nthat conclusion is, in view of the record as a whole, clearly erroneous.\n\nId.\n\n                                  Analysis\n\n      Appellant failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination\n                             but the issue is moot.\n\n         After the competency trial, but before the punishment jury was\n\nsworn, Appellant objected to the composition of the jury under Batson.\n\n(RR59:66). He identified eight minority veniremembers that the State\n\nstruck. (RR59:66). The Court did not immediately rule and instead\n\nasked, “What says the State?” (RR59:67). Without requesting a ruling,\n                                      51\n\fthe State introduced a copy of and read into the record, the Dallas\n\nCounty District Attorney’s Office policy regarding Batson claims.\n\n(RR59:67-68; SX3Z). The prosecutor then provided a “breakdown [of]\n\nthe strikes” to show that the State did not use a disproportionate\n\nnumber of strikes on the basis of race or gender. (RR59:68-70). At that\n\npoint, the State objected “to the Court having found a prima facie case”\n\nand asked for a ruling. (RR59:70-71). The Court stated that it would\n\n“withhold at this moment a ruling on whether the Defense has made a\n\nprima facie case or not and have the State go into [an] explanation of\n\ntheir strikes.”   (RR59:71).    The State then explained its strikes.\n\n(RR59:71-76).\n\n       At the conclusion of the State’s explanation, the trial court found\n\nthat “the strikes made by the State were not based upon the panel\n\nmembers’ race.    They were neutral in that respect, and denies the\n\nBatson.” (RR59:77).    The State then requested a ruling regarding its\n\nprior objection that Appellant failed to present a prima facie case.\n\n(RR59:77). The trial court stated that it was “of the opinion that a\n\nprima facie case was not presented by the Defense.” (RR59:77).\n\n\n\n\n                                   52\n\f      The issue of whether Appellant established a prima facie case that\n\nthe State exercised its peremptory strikes on the basis of race is moot.\n\n“Once a prosecutor has offered a race-neutral explanation for the\n\nperemptory challenges and the trial court has ruled on the ultimate\n\nquestion of intentional discrimination, the preliminary issue of whether\n\nthe defendant had made a prima facie showing becomes moot.”\n\nHernandez v.

Because the State articulated the reasons for its strikes\n\nand   the   trial   ruled   on   the   ultimate   question    of   purposeful\n\ndiscrimination, the preliminary issue of whether Appellant established\n\na prima facie case is moot and not subject to review on appeal.

The State satisfied this burden.\n\n            Figures, Prieston, Barbosa, Tilley, Moore, Nohe\n\n       At the Batson hearing, the State stated that it struck Figures,\n\nPrieston, Barbosa, Tilley, Moore, and Nohe because they ranked\n\nthemselves as either a “3” or “4.” (RR59:72-73). The State explained\n\nthat it struck all qualified veniremembers who ranked themselves as\n\neither a “3” or a “4.” (RR59:72-73). Question No. 2 on the questionnaire\n\nasked: “With reference to the death penalty, which of the following\n\nstatements best represents your feelings?” (Figures, Juror 755, Q. p.1).\n\nA ranking of “3” indicated the following opinion: “Although I do not\n\nbelieve that the death penalty should ever be imposed, as long as the\n\nlaw provides for it, I could assess it under the proper set of\n\ncircumstances.” (Figures, Juror 755, Q. p.1).

(RR59:73).    Biswas\n\ndemonstrated concern about being a part of the trial process: she asked\n\nthe trial court whether and why it was necessary for Appellant to be\n\npresent and she stated that as a physician and healer, she was\n\nuncomfortable dealing with the death penalty.

App. 2012). The question of pretext is a question of fact for the\n\ntrial court to resolve, subject to reversal on appeal only for clear error.\n\nWatkins, 245 S.W.3d at 457.\n\n      Appellant primarily contends that the State’s strikes must have\n\nbeen racially motivated because these jurors were qualified jurors and\n\nsome had characteristics potentially favorable to the State’s position on\n\nthe   death   penalty.   (Appellant’s     Brief   pp.35-41).   The   jurors’\n\nqualifications for jury service are irrelevant to the analysis, however.\n\nFactors relevant to determining whether purposeful discrimination has\n\nbeen proven include the following:\n\n           1. whether the State utilized its option to shuffle the\n              jury panels in a manner that supported an inference\n              of race discrimination;\n\n           2. whether the prosecutor’s office trying the case\n              followed a formal policy to exclude minority venire\n              members from jury service which was known to at\n              least one of the prosecutors at trial;\n\n           3. whether the State exercised its peremptory\n              challenges to eliminate a far greater proportion of\n              minority venire members than non-minority venire\n              members;\n\n           4. whether the reasons the State asserted for\n              eliminating the minority venire members in\n              question appeared to apply equally well to many\n\n                                     58\n\f              non-minority venire members whom the State did\n              not challenge; and\n\n           5. whether the State directed questions expressly\n              designed to elicit grounds for peremptory challenges\n              disproportionately, in a manner that suggested an\n              intent to single out minority venire members for\n              elimination.\n\nWatkins, 245 S.W.3d at 448-49 (relying on Miller-El v. Dretke, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799976\"><a href=\"/opinion/799976/miller-el-v-dretke/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 240-64, 266 (2005)).     This Court looks to the collective and\n\ncumulative impact of these non–exclusive factors in determining\n\nwhether an inference of racial discrimination is so powerful that it\n\novercomes the deference given to trial courts. See id. at 449.\n\n     An analysis of these factors demonstrates that Appellant’s claim\n\nof purposeful discrimination lacks merit.\n\n           1. Jury Shuffle\n\n     The jury pool was not shuffled in this case. The parties selected\n\nthe group of qualified jurors from a February 21, 2014 special venire.\n\n(RR9).   Appellant does not assert or demonstrate that the venire was\n\nshuffled or otherwise arranged in a manner to decrease the possibility\n\nof a minority member.\n\n           2. Formal Policy Prohibits Discrimination\n\n     The Dallas County District Attorney’s office’s notorious formal\n                                    59\n\fpolicy of excluding minorities is a relic of a bygone era.   It is common\n\nknowledge that the office policy of the last several years not only forbids\n\nsuch discrimination, it requires an investigation into sustained Batson\n\nchallenges and authorizes discipline ranging from reprimand to\n\ntermination. At the Batson hearing, the trial court admitted a written\n\ncopy of the District Attorney’s Batson policy into evidence for record\n\npurposes and the prosecutor read it into the record.         (RR59:67-68;\n\nSX3Z).\n\n           3. Proportionality of Strikes\n\n     Appellant argues that even one racially motivated peremptory\n\nstrike violates Batson yet he fails to demonstrate a pattern of\n\ndiscriminatory strikes.   Appellant does not identify the size or racial\n\nmakeup of the pool of qualified venire members. He does not analyze\n\nthe number of strikes used by either side or how they were used.\n\nInstead, he relies on the jurors’ questionnaires, arguing that certain\n\nState-struck jurors gave answers similar to those who were not struck\n\nby the State. Appellant then argues that the State used 8 of its 14\n\nperemptory strikes to eliminate 57% of the minorities on the qualified\n\n\n\n\n                                    60\n\fprospective jury panel, a statistic with which the State disagrees.\n\n(Appellant’s Brief p. 49).\n\n     The data evinces no discriminatory intent by the State. The panel\n\nof qualified venire members consisted of 45 people. Of these, 16 (36%)\n\nwere African-American, 23 (51%) were Caucasian, 3 (7%) were\n\nHispanic, and 3 (7%) were Asian.      The State exercised 14 peremptory\n\nstrikes. Of those 14 strikes, 5 (36%) were used on African-Americans, 6\n\n(43%) were used on Caucasians, 1 (7%) was used on a Hispanic juror,\n\nand 2 (14%) were used on Asians.      Appellant exercised 17 peremptory\n\nstrikes.   Of his 17 strikes, 6 (35%) were used on African-American\n\njurors, 9 (53%) were used on Caucasian jurors, and 2 (12%) were used\n\non Hispanic jurors.    The result was a 12-member jury consisting of 3\n\nAfrican-American jurors, 8 Caucasian jurors, and 1 Asian juror, with 2\n\nAfrican-American alternate jurors.\n\n     By striking 8 of the 22 possible minority veniremembers, the State\n\neliminated only 36% of the minorities on the panel, not 57% as\n\nAppellant alleges. Nevertheless, the number of minorities struck by the\n\nState is, by itself, an irrelevant statistic. It gains relevance only by\n\nestablishing its correlation to the entire panel. See Woodward v. Epps,\n\n\n                                     61\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"67497\"><a href=\"/opinion/67497/woodward-v-epps/\"><span class=\"volume\">580</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">318</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 339 (5th Cir. 2009) (holding that the State’s striking 100\n\npercent of the black jurors alone does not support a finding of\n\ndiscrimination and does not show any disparity in relation to the non-\n\nminority jurors).    In Appellant’s case, the correlation shows no\n\ndiscriminatory intent.\n\n     Of the 45 venire members who could conceivably be chosen for the\n\njury, 22 (49%), were members of a minority. A random selection would\n\nyield either 6 or 7 minority jurors in the 14 jurors selected (12 plus 2\n\nalternates) (or 49% of fourteen, equaling 6.86 jurors). See Watkins, 245\n\nS.W.3d at 451-52 (holding a random selection from a       22% African-\n\nAmerican venire would yield 2 or 3 black jurors because 22% of 12\n\njurors, plus 1 alternate, was 2.86).    This jury panel had 4 minority\n\njurors and 2 minority alternate jurors.     Thus, 49% of the qualified\n\njurors were minorities and 43% of the 14-person jury were minorities.\n\nThis jury had only slightly less than the expected amount of minority\n\nmembers as would be expected from a random selection of the 45\n\nqualified jurors.   Statistical analysis simply fails to show any racial\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n\n\n\n                                   62\n\f           4. Comparative Analysis\n\n     Appellant contends on appeal that the prosecutor’s stated reasons\n\nare a pretext for racial discrimination because the minority State-struck\n\njurors gave responses to certain questions on their questionnaire that\n\nare similar to jurors not struck by the State. (Appellant’s Brief p.42).\n\nImportantly, however, at the Batson hearing, defense counsel failed to\n\nprovide any comparative analysis regarding the jurors. (RR59:66, 71,\n\n76). And, counsel asked only one question of the prosecutor: whether\n\nthe jurors who ranked themselves as “3s,” “4s,” or “5s” on their\n\nquestionnaire were going to be struck without regard to the jurors’\n\nqualifications.   (RR59:76). The prosecutor was not questioned any\n\nfurther regarding his reasons for not striking any similarly-situated\n\nvenire members. (RR59:76). As such, the prosecutor had no opportunity\n\nto respond to counsel’s allegations.        Appellant should not be permitted\n\nto raise claims of disparate treatment for the first time on appeal. By\n\nfailing to properly present this claim at trial, he denied the prosecutor\n\nthe opportunity to create a record on the prosecutor’s strategy, and he\n\ndenied the trial court an opportunity to rule on the claim. Whether a\n\nprosecutor intended to discriminate on the basis of race is a question of\n\n\n                                       63\n\fhistorical fact properly decided in the trial courts. See Hernandez, 500\n\nU.S. at 367-69.    State procedural rules demand that allegations of\n\ndisparate treatment by the prosecutor be raised in the trial court, so\n\nthat they can be properly answered by the State and decided by that\n\ncourt.   See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a); Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 457-58\n\n(Keller, P.J., concurring); Young v.

App. 1991) (Campbell, J., dissenting).\n\n     The State acknowledges this Court’s majority opinion in Young,\n\nthat a non-capital defendant is not required to raise a comparative\n\nanalysis in the trial court to have evidence of such considered on appeal.\n\nYoung, 826 S.W.2d at 145-46. The Fifth Circuit has applied Young to a\n\ncapital case and criticized this Court’s inconsistency in its application of\n\nthe contemporaneous objection rule to Batson claims in capital cases.\n\nReed, 555 F.3d at 370.\n\n     This Court should explicitly overrule Young.            See generally\n\nWatkins, 245 S.W.3d at 457-58 (Keller, P.J., concurring). Its majority—\n\nand the courts that rely on it—view the comparative analysis as merely\n\nan appellate argument that can be fairly addressed for the first time on\n\nappeal. Young, 826 S.W.2d at 146. In truth, it is a factual allegation of\n\n\n                                     64\n\funfair treatment between jurors. If properly raised in the trial court,\n\nthe prosecution’s response may provide additional facts for the\n\nappellate court to consider when reviewing the Batson ruling. If raised\n\nat trial successfully, the trial court can cure the error before trial even\n\nbegins.\n\n      If not raised at trial, the prosecutor’s mental process and the trial\n\njudge’s credibility decision concerning the non-strikes are simply\n\nomitted from the record.      Jurors are not products of a set of cookie\n\ncutters, and the unexplained decision not to strike a non-minority juror\n\nwho shares one trait in common with a minority juror is held against\n\nthe State on appellate review.       See, e.g., Miller-El, 545 U.S. at 244\n\n(stating, “If, indeed, Fields’s thoughts on rehabilitation did make the\n\nprosecutor uneasy, he should have worried about a number of white\n\npanel members he accepted with no evident reservations.”) (emphasis\n\nadded). The prosecutor’s explanation of his voir dire strategy and the\n\ntrial court’s ruling on the strategy is critical to a fair appellate review.\n\n      At the very least, a prosecutor should enjoy favor on appeal when\n\nthe matter is not raised at trial, much like the presumption against a\n\nfinding of ineffective assistance of defense counsel. In claims regarding\n\n\n                                      65\n\fviolations of a client’s constitutional right to counsel, this Court has\n\nstated that “counsel should ordinarily be accorded an opportunity to\n\nexplain her actions before being condemned as unprofessional and\n\nincompetent.”      Bone v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2099804\"><a href=\"/opinion/2099804/bone-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">828</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 836 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2002). A prosecutor’s credibility is the heart of Batson review, and he\n\nshould be accorded no less of an opportunity to explain his actions.\n\n     This Court should conclude that the comparative analysis is not\n\npreserved for review or, alternatively, presume that the comparative\n\nanalysis favors the prosecutor absent affirmative evidence on the\n\nrecord.\n\n     In any event, Appellant has wholly failed to establish that the\n\npotential jurors who are the focus of his Batson challenge were similarly\n\nsituated to non-minority potential jurors who were not struck.\n\n               Figures, Prieston, Barbosa, Tilley, Moore, Nohe\n\n          The record supports the State’s assertion that it struck each and\n\nevery qualified prospective juror regardless of race who ranked\n\nhim/herself as a “3” or a “4,” on Question 2 of their questionnaire.\n\n(RR59:72-73). This includes the following prospective jurors:       Cassie\n\nFigures (Juror 755, an African-American female); Artherine Prieston\n\n\n                                      66\n\f(Juror 1055, an African-American female); Martha Barbosa (Juror 1095,\n\na Hispanic female); Jeffrey Nicholson (Juror 281, a Caucasian male);\n\nKelsey Hooten (Juror 445, a Caucasian female); and, Christen Morris\n\n(Juror 1097, a Caucasian female).

He cannot show\n\ndisparate treatment of Figures, Prieston, Barbosa, Tilley, Moore, and\n\nNohe compared to accepted non-minority veniremembers.           As such,\n\nAppellant has failed to show that the prosecutor’s explanation was a\n\npretext for discrimination. See Broadnax v. State, No. AP-76,207, 2011\n\n\n                                    67\n\fTex. Crim. App. Unpub. LEXIS 920, at *7-8 (Tex. Crim. App. Dec. 14,\n\n2011) (not designated for publication) (holding no pretext where\n\nprosecutor struck all jurors who believed death penalty should never be\n\ninvoked).\n\n                              Neena Biswas\n\n     The State explained that it struck Biswas because she was not a\n\nqualified juror. (RR59:73-74).     First, Biswas voiced concerns about\n\ndetermining    punishment      without    having    participated   in   the\n\ndetermination regarding Appellant’s guilt or innocence. According to\n\nBiswas, the guilt/innocence portion of trial is the most important part of\n\nthe process, not the determination of punishment. Her concerns were so\n\ngreat that it would affect her ability to take the oath as a juror to follow\n\nthe law. The following exchange took place:\n\n     [Prosecutor]: Okay. So what I’m hearing from you is that\n     the Judge may give you a jury instruction and charge that\n     you are not allowed to consider the Defendant’s guilt or\n     innocence, because he’s already been found guilty.\n\n     [Biswas]: Correct.\n\n     [Prosecutor]: What I’m hearing from you is that you could\n     not follow that law.\n\n\n\n                                     68\n\f[Biswas]: Absolutely. I will not actually follow it,\nwithout the evidence, without the data. I wouldn’t do a\ngood job. I mean, I would need a lot of details. And that is\nwhat I do in my work.\n\n[Prosecutor]: And so in your mind, do you feel, based on\nyour concern about hearing the facts and circumstances of\nthe case and not being a part of part of [sic] that guilt-or-\ninnocence decision, do you feel like you would make the\nState prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt again that the\nDefendant is guilty of capital murder?\n\n[Biswas]: No, I would not. I will not make a decision.\nBecause I was not involved in the actual thing, if he was\nguilty or not. And I think that is the actual thing. Because,\nwhat comes after the fact is just, oh, how are we going to\ndeal with the problem? Problem’s already been figured out.\nI was not part of that, so I would not be able to decide.\n\n[Prosecutor]: We have to use legal terms here. You said you\ncould not be able to decide. Does that mean - - the law says\neach juror would have to take an oath that they will a true\nverdict render, based on the law and the evidence.\n\n     Are you saying that you could not take that oath?\n\n[Biswas]: I will not take that oath. Because I was not\npart of the actual decision. I could take the oath. But, like I\nsaid, I would prefer not to give a decision “yes” or “no.”\n\n[Prosecutor]: Okay. So you told me both things. So we have\nto have affirm [sic] “yes” or “no” that you will not take that\noath or could not take that oath.\n\n                              69\n\f     [Biswas]: I could not take that oath.\n\n(RR14:50-51) (emphasis added).       Shortly after the above-mentioned\n\nexchange, Biswas stated that she could take the oath, but the issue of\n\nguilt would remain in the back of her mind. (RR14:54). She stated that\n\nshe would have difficulty in following an instruction not to consider\n\nAppellant’s guilt or innocence in answering the special issues.\n\n(RR14:73, 74).    The issue of Biswas’ lack of participation in the\n\nguilt/innocence portion of trial was a recurring theme in her responses.\n\nThe following exchange took place:\n\n     [Prosecutor]: Dr. Biswas, we already talked about, in\n     Special Issue Number One, that you may hear evidence and\n     testimony that includes the facts and circumstances of the\n     offense for which the Defendant was found guilty.\n\n           So you already understand that, correct?\n\n     [Biswas]: Correct.\n\n     [Prosecutor]: But you still say that you would still - - it\n     would still be stuck in your mind, and it would color your\n     answers to these questions: Is this person guilty or not\n     guilty of this offense?\n\n     [Biswas]: Correct.\n\n\n\n                                     70\n\f(RR14:75-76).\n\n     Second, Biswas expressed concern about her ability to answer the\n\ndeliberateness special issue because “we don’t know what was going on\n\nin that person’s mind at that time. We don’t know why he took that\n\naction . . . I don’t know why the guilty verdict was achieved.”\n\n(RR14:67). She testified that she would not be able to make credibility\n\ndeterminations “again, because I was not involved in the guilty or not\n\nguilty verdict, which I think is the main crux of any case.” (RR14:70).\n\n     Third, when asked whether she would require the State to prove\n\nAppellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt before she would consider\n\nthe special issues Biswas said “Yes.” (RR14:52). But then a short time\n\nlater, she said, “I’m not saying you have to prove it again, because it\n\ncost [sic] a lot of money.” (RR14:53). With regard to the future danger\n\nspecial issue, however, Biswas agreed that she would hold the State to a\n\nhigher burden of proof because “[she] was not part of the guilty/not\n\nguilty trial.” (RR14:83).\n\n     Fourth, Biswas testified that she did not agree with a criminal\n\ndefendant’s Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself.\n\n(RR14:86). Initially, she said that if instructed not to consider the fact\n\n\n                                    71\n\fthat Appellant did not testify that she could not follow that instruction.\n\n(RR14:86).   Then she stated that she could follow the law, but she did\n\nnot agree with it and it would weigh on her mind as she deliberated the\n\nspecial issues. (RR14:86-87).\n\n     Finally, Biswas testified that she would place police officers’\n\ncredibility above that of other witnesses. (RR14:88-89).       She testified\n\nthat she “would give them the benefit of the doubt.” (RR14:89). During\n\nher questioning by the defense, Biswas agreed to follow the law and not\n\nstart a police officer at a higher level of certainty. (RR14:108).\n\n     On appeal, in support of his argument that the prosecutor’s\n\nexplanations are a pretext, Appellant points out that Biswas – like 17\n\nother jurors that the State accepted – ranked herself as a “2” on\n\nQuestion 2, indicating a belief that “the death penalty is appropriate in\n\nsome murder cases, and I could return a verdict in a proper case which\n\nassessed the death penalty.”      (Biswas, Juror 64, Q p.2).         In truth,\n\nbecause the State struck all 3s and 4s, the only jurors left for the State\n\nto accept were 2s. Therefore, this argument does nothing to further\n\nAppellant’s claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                     72\n\f     The State does not dispute that Biswas’s responses to certain\n\nquestions in the questionnaire are the same as those of other accepted\n\nvenire members.     The questionnaire should not be considered in a\n\nvacuum, however.      This is especially true as it pertains to Biswas\n\nbecause, while she may appear to be a qualified juror on paper, during\n\ntestimony, Biswas vacillated on her ability to perform the most basic\n\nduty required of a juror: taking the oath and following the law. As\n\nsuch, the State had legitimate reason to be concerned about Biswas\n\nsitting as a juror in a capital murder case.   Since the trial court denied\n\nthe State’s challenge for cause, the State exercised a peremptory\n\nchallenge.     Notably, the State struck all 9 jurors that it had\n\nunsuccessfully challenged for cause:       Biswas (Juror 64, an Asian\n\nfemale), Leon Tilley (Juror 126, an African-American male), Deborah\n\nMoore (Juror 225, an African-American female), Macy Haag (Juror 408,\n\na Caucasian female), Pornsak Nohe (Juror 497, an Asian male), Cassie\n\nFigures (Juror 755, an African-American female), Suzanne Morrison\n\n(Juror 920, a Caucasian female), Mary McGowan (Juror 955, an\n\nAfrican-American female), and Artherine Prieston (Juror 1055, an\n\nAfrican-American female).\n\n\n                                    73\n\f      The record supports the genuineness of the State’s explanations\n\nfor striking Biswas. Appellant has failed to show that the prosecutor’s\n\nexplanation was a pretext for discrimination.\n\n                              Mary McGowan\n\n       The State explained that it struck McGowan because of her bias\n\nagainst the State and because of her belief in rehabilitation rather than\n\nincarceration, even in cases involving capital murder. During voir dire,\n\nafter the prosecutor explained the special issues, he asked McGowan to\n\nelaborate on her response to Question 32, which asks the prospective\n\njuror to write the word that first comes to mind when they think of\n\ncertain professions.      (McGowan, Juror 955, Q p.6).             Regarding\n\nprosecutors, McGowan wrote “they are always out to get a person.”\n\n(McGowan, Juror 955, Q p.6).        She affirmed this statement when she\n\ntestified that “I feel like - - well, in Texas here, I feel like - - it depends\n\non the prosecutors. The majority of them - - . . . - - I just feel like they\n\nare out to get that person.” (RR42:25). She continued:\n\n      So the prosecutor - - I can understand they have to do their\n      job, too. Because they’re a prosecutors [sic], that’s their job\n      to do that. But I think sometimes it’s unfair, and I think\n      that the prosecutor is actually out to get that person really.\n      Just my opinion.\n\n                                      74\n\f(RR42:25).     Later in the questionnaire, on Question 36F, McGowan\n\nwrote that she “Strongly Agree[d]” with the statement, “The Criminal\n\nJustice System in Dallas County is untrustworthy.” (McGowan, Juror\n\n955, Q p.7).\n\n       McGowan also demonstrated a preference for rehabilitation\n\nrather than punishment.     On Question 42 of her questionnaire, she\n\nranked rehabilitation as the most important objective of punishment.\n\n(McGowan, Juror 955, Q p.8). She testified that rehabilitation should\n\nalways be the first option in sentencing. (RR42:28). “Then, if they fail\n\nrehab, if they go back again continuously, then make another decision.”\n\n(RR42:28). She continued, “But I just feel like, in some cases, where\n\nsomebody do [sic] something bad, commit murder or whatever, I feel\n\nlike rehab should be the first thing that should happen.” (RR42:28).\n\nAccording to McGowan, rehabilitation should be an option even in cases\n\ninvolving the death penalty. (RR42:29).\n\n     On appeal, Appellant argues that the State’s explanations are a\n\npretext because McGowan’s responses to certain questions on her\n\nquestionnaire matched those of other veniremembers who were\n\naccepted by the State. As previously argued, the questionnaire cannot\n\n                                   75\n\fbe considered in a vacuum. McGowan (like Biswas and like the 17\n\njurors the State accepted) ranked herself as a “2” on her questionnaire.\n\n(McGowan, Juror 955, Q p.2).       As stated above, this similarity is\n\ninsignificant in light of the fact that the only jurors that the State\n\naccepted were 2s.     Moreover, the State notes that despite having\n\nranked herself as a “2,” on Question 36C, McGowan wrote that she\n\nagreed that the death penalty should be abolished. (McGowan, Juror\n\n955, Q p. 7).\n\n     The State acknowledges that McGowan answered other questions\n\nsimilar to jurors that the State accepted:      (1) she had no moral,\n\nreligious, or personal beliefs that would prevent her from sitting in\n\njudgment of another human being; (2) she had no moral, religious, or\n\npersonal beliefs that would prevent her from returning a verdict that\n\nwould result in the execution of another human being; (3) she agreed\n\nthat life imprisonment or the death penalty are appropriate for someone\n\nguilty of intentional murder committed during the course of a burglary;\n\n(4) she agreed that some crimes call for the death penalty solely because\n\nof their facts and circumstances; (5) she ranked the strength of her\n\nbelief in using the death penalty as a “7”; (6) she believed that\n\n\n                                   76\n\ftestimony from a police officer was the same as any other witness; and,\n\n(7) she believed in the principle of “an eye for an eye.” (McGowan, Juror\n\n955, Q p.8).    Nevertheless, like Biswas, the fact that McGowan\n\nanswered certain questions the same as some accepted jurors does not\n\nchange the testimony she gave during voir dire.      It was McGowan’s\n\ntestimony that set her apart from other jurors and it was that\n\ntestimony that caused the State to exercise a strike against her.\n\n(RR59:75-76).    The record supports the genuineness of the State’s\n\nexplanations for striking McGowan. Appellant has failed to show that\n\nthe prosecutor’s explanation was a pretext for discrimination.\n\n                              Conclusion\n\n     Appellant has wholly failed to show that Jurors Figures, Prieston,\n\nBarbosa, Tilley, Moore, Nohe, Biswas, or McGowan were similarly-\n\nsituated to non-minority jurors that were not struck by the State.\n\n           5. Disparate Questioning\n\n     Appellant points to no instances of disparate questioning by the\n\nState. Cf. Miller-El, 545 U.S. at 256-57 (prosecutors used a graphic\n\nscript when describing the death penalty to African-American jurors\n\nwho were ambivalent to the death penalty more often than with white\n\n\n                                   77\n\fjurors who also were ambivalent). Nor is any disparate questioning\n\napparent in the record.\n\n                              Conclusion\n\n     Appellant has not established by a preponderance of the evidence\n\nthat the State’s exercise of its peremptory challenges against 8 minority\n\nveniremembers was the product of racial discrimination. Appellant has\n\nnot shown that the State’s explanations apply equally to non-minority\n\nvenire members that the State did not challenge, that the State directed\n\nquestions expressly designed to elicit grounds for peremptory challenges\n\ndisproportionately, or that a formal policy excludes minorities from jury\n\nservice.   The record before this Court supports the trial court’s\n\nresolution of the fact question of pretext. Consequently, the trial court\n\ndid not err in denying Appellant’s Batson challenges. See Watkins, 245\n\nS.W.3d at 456-57.\n\n     This Court should overrule Appellant’s first eight issues.\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE NOS. 9-23: THE TRIAL COURT DID          NOT ERR\nIN DENYING APPELLANT’S CHALLENGES FOR CAUSE.\n\n\n     In Issues 9 through 23, Appellant contends that the trial court\n\nerred in denying his challenges to 15 prospective jurors. In so doing,\n\nAppellant argues, the trial court violated his right to a fair and\n                                   78\n\funbiased jury under the United States Constitution and article\n\n35.16(c)(2) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.\n\n                            Applicable Law\n\n       A prospective juror may be challenged for cause if, among other\n\nreasons, he possesses a bias or prejudice in favor of or against the\n\ndefendant or he possesses a bias against an aspect of the law upon\n\nwhich the defendant is entitled to rely.

When all of these conditions are met, the\n\ndefendant has been wrongfully deprived of one of his statutory\n\nperemptory challenges in that he was forced to use a peremptory\n\nchallenge to remove a prospective juror who should have been removed\n\nfor cause.   See id.   If the defendant received additional peremptory\n\nchallenges beyond the fifteen allotted by statute, he must show harm by\n\nproving that the trial court erroneously denied a number of defense\n\nchallenges for cause equal to at least one more than the number of\n\nadditional peremptory challenges granted.

Crim. App. 2004).\n\n                                Analysis\n\n     The parties asserted their challenges for cause and peremptory\n\nchallenges at the conclusion of each prospective juror’s individual voir\n\ndire. With the exception of Jennifer Wilder, following the trial court’s\n\n\n                                    81\n\fdenial of their challenges for cause, the defense exercised a peremptory\n\nstrike against each complained-of veniremember. Appellant exhausted\n\nall fifteen of his statutory peremptory strikes on the following jurors:\n\nAnnie Fenster (Juror 36); Rebecca Sands (Juror 46); Dorce Jackson\n\n(Juror 138); David Darden (Juror 186); Delores Sawyer (Juror 270);\n\nJonathan Henderson (Juror 288); Patricia Withers (Juror 323); Larry\n\nMiddleton (Juror 427); Isaac Tschewik (Juror 440); Michael Dawson\n\n(Juror 469); Angela Thorpe-Harris (Juror 495); Christopher Weinzapfel\n\n(Juror 612); Phillip Rapp (Juror 968); Nancy Ramos (Juror 1025); and\n\nJay Kirby (Juror 1052). (RR13:205-06; RR15:114; RR16:76; RR19:225;\n\nRR20:226; RR22:86; RR26:152, 341; RR27:153; RR28:133; RR32:90:\n\nRR42:71; RR44:20; RR45:68).\n\n     Appellant was granted two additional strikes, which he used to\n\nremove Nathan Sosa (Juror 1070) and James Martin (Juror 1190).\n\n(RR46:34; RR50:47).      Appellant later asked for, and was denied,\n\nanother additional strike to exercise on Jennifer Wilder, whom\n\nAppellant identified as objectionable.   (RR52:87).     Since Appellant\n\nreceived two extra peremptory challenges in addition to the fifteen\n\nallotted by statute, he must show that the trial court erroneously denied\n\n\n                                   82\n\fat least three of his challenges for cause to the other veniremembers\n\nidentified in Issues 9 through 23. See, e.g., Saldano, 232 S.W.3d at 93\n\n(noting that Saldano would have to show 3 erroneous denials because\n\nhe received two extra peremptory strikes).\n\n                             Issue 9: Rebecca Sands\n\n      Appellant challenged Rebecca Sands for cause because she\n\nbelieved that “if a person committed something intentionally, that was\n\na greater state of mind than deliberately[.]”             (RR13:133). Appellant\n\nargued that Sands’s definition of intentional and deliberate would then\n\ncause her to automatically answer the deliberateness special issue21\n\naffirmatively. (RR13:133).\n\n                             Deliberate/Intentional\n\n        During the State’s voir dire, the prosecutor explained the\n\ndeliberateness special issue.           (RR13:90-91).        He explained that\n\n“[d]eliberate falls more than intentional, but short of premeditation.”\n\n(RR13:91).     Sands stated that she could “see the difference” between\n\nthe terms. (RR13:91).\n\n\n21 For ease of the reader, the State will refer to the special issues as follows: “the\nintellectual disability special issue” (Special Issue No. One); “the deliberateness\nspecial issue” (Special Issue No. Two); “the future danger special issue” (Special\nIssue No. Three); and, “the mitigation special issue” (Special Issue No. Four).\n                                         83\n\f     Upon questioning by the defense, Sands tried to articulate what\n\nshe, in her mind, understood the difference to be between intentional\n\nand deliberate conduct. (RR13:117-18). She stated, “I guess deliberate,\n\nto me, is more short-term than intentional.       It’s like, a knee-jerk\n\nreaction, but you knew what was going to happen.” (RR13:118).         The\n\nfollowing exchange then took place:\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: Okay. So, in your mind, intentional is a\n     higher process of thought and deliberate is a little bit more\n     reactionary?\n\n     [Sands]: Yes. I think you can say that.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: I think what you’re saying is, if it has\n     already been determined that this was done intentionally,\n     then it certainly was done deliberately.\n\n     [Sands]: Yes.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: So if you were instructed that the person\n     had already been convicted of doing this intentionally, your\n     answer to Special Issue Number Two would, per your\n     definition, be automatically “yes” because of the instructions\n     of the Court?\n\n     [Sands]: Yes.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: Okay. That’s what I want to know. A lot\n     of people feel that way. And there’s nothing wrong with it.\n\n\n                                   84\n\f     Isn’t this cruel, we don’t define these things and then we ask\n     you to define them?\n\n     But if that’s how you feel, that’s - - you’re fine, if that’s your\n     definition of deliberate, is something less than intentional.\n     So question number two would be answered “yes” for you,\n     because the Court’s instructed you that it was already\n     determined that it was an intentional act?\n\n     [Sands]: I would like to see more of the details.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: I understand that. We’re just asking you\n     about your definitions.\n\n     [Sands]: Okay. That’s my definition.\n\n(RR13:118-19). The above-mentioned exchange continued on for several\n\npages, with defense counsel repeatedly confirming Sands’ view that\n\n“intentional” is a higher state of mind than “deliberate” while\n\nsimultaneously reassuring Sands that she was entitled to her opinion.\n\n(RR13:119-24).    Even when Sands appeared confused and stated, “I\n\ndon’t know where I’m at now[,]” defense counsel did not alleviate her\n\nconfusion, but merely stated:\n\n     I don’t want to confuse you. It’s just that, that is a strange,\n     archaic, dinosaur question from back in the day. A lot of\n     people have that issue. That’s why I’m asking you.\n\n\n\n\n                                     85\n\f     If the answer to Special Issue Number Two is “yes” for you, if\n     it’s an intentional act already, that’s fine. We just need to\n     know that.\n\n     And that’s your answer?\n\n(RR13:120). Sands testified that she would “have to see more evidence”\n\nbut defense counsel cut her off, instructing that she was not asking how\n\nSands would vote, but rather was simply concerned with Sands’\n\ndefinition of the terms. (RR13:122).\n\n     Importantly, at no point during the above-described exchange, did\n\ndefense counsel actually instruct Sands regarding the law or do\n\nanything to correct her misunderstanding of the distinction between the\n\nterms.   As such, Sands was not subject to a challenge for cause based\n\non this exchange.      See generally Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667\n\n(explaining that, before a prospective juror can be excused for bias, the\n\nlaw must be explained to him and he must be asked whether he can\n\nfollow that law regardless of his personal views).\n\n     A review of the entirety of Sands’ voir dire shows that she\n\nunderstood that there is, in fact, a distinction between the terms\n\nintentional and deliberate.    (RR13:89-93, 117-18, 120). Although she\n\nmay have confused legal terms when she was questioned by the defense,\n\n                                    86\n\fthe record reflects that she would not automatically answer the\n\ndeliberateness special issue in the affirmative.\n\n                              Questionnaire\n\n     On    appeal,     Appellant   points   to   Question   9   on   Sands’\n\nquestionnaire, which asks, “For what crimes do you think a sentence of\n\nlife imprisonment is the proper punishment?” (Sands, Juror 46, Q p.3).\n\nSands wrote, “NA.” Appellant fails to state why Sands’ response makes\n\nher challengeable. Regardless, Appellant did not challenge Sands based\n\non this answer at trial; therefore, this complaint is not preserved for\n\nreview. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a) (providing that a timely specific trial\n\nobjection is prerequisite to presenting a complaint on appellate review).\n\nRegardless, during voir dire, when asked to explain this answer, Sands\n\ntestified that “that’s hard to elaborate on, because I don’t know the\n\ncrime.” (RR13:112).      She then agreed that life imprisonment may be\n\nproper punishment on a murder case. (RR13:112).\n\n     Appellant has failed to show that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge for cause against Sands.         Issue 9\n\nshould be overruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                     87\n\f                        Issue 10: Dorce Jackson\n\n     Appellant challenged Jackson for cause for the following reasons:\n\n(1) in her questionnaire, she wrote that a life sentence would be\n\nappropriate in cases of self-defense or mental illness; (2) she would\n\nplace a burden on the defense to provide evidence in connection with the\n\nmitigation special issue; and, (3) she would increase the burden of proof\n\non the intellectual disability special issue. (RR15:111-12).\n\n                             Questionnaire\n\n     After questioning concluded, Appellant challenged Jackson for\n\ncause because “in her questionnaire, she indicated that a life sentence\n\nwould only be appropriate where a person did not intend to do it or it\n\nwas self-defense or had some kind of mental illness.” (RR15:111). This\n\nis a misstatement of Jackson’s answers in her questionnaire.         On\n\nQuestion 9, in response to a question asking “[f]or what crimes do you\n\nthink a sentence of life imprisonment is the proper punishment[,]?”\n\nJackson wrote, “maybe a crime of passion or when murder wasn’t\n\nintended.” (Jackson, Juror 138, Q p.3). Jackson never mentioned self-\n\ndefense and she never mentioned mental illness. And, her response did\n\nnot indicate that murders involving crimes of passion and lack of intent\n\n\n                                    88\n\fwere the sole offenses that should be eligible for life imprisonment.22\n\nMoreover, during questioning, Jackson testified that she “would agree”\n\nwith the statement that “the death penalty may not be appropriate in\n\nsome cases[.]” (RR15:40). She testified that she is “open to anything . .\n\n. It just all depends.” (RR15:86).\n\n                         Burden of Proof – Mitigation\n\n      Appellant challenged Jackson for cause on the basis of her\n\ntestimony that she would require the defense to present evidence or\n\nconvince her that Appellant should receive a life sentence. (RR15:111).\n\nDuring the State’s voir dire, the mitigation special issue and the fact\n\nthat there was no burden of proof on this issue was explained to\n\nJackson.    (RR15:70-76).      Jackson indicated that she understood the\n\nissue and responded in the affirmative when asked whether she could\n\nconsider mitigating evidence “whether it exists or not[.]” (RR15:81-82).\n\nWhen she was questioned by the defense, the following exchange took\n\nplace:\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: Again, my question was: Would you\n      require the Defense - - this table over here, the Defense - - to\n\n22Defense counsel referenced this question during voir dire, but, because it was in\nthe middle of a series of questions, Jackson never specifically answered him.\n(RR15:86).\n                                        89\n\f     provide you or convince you that the person should receive a\n     life sentence instead of a death sentence?\n\n     [Jackson]: Would I want you to provide evidence to have a\n     life sentence instead of death?\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: Correct.\n\n     [Jackson]: But that’s where I’m confused. Because, based on\n     all of this - - going through the steps, wouldn’t I basically be\n     taking that into consideration the whole time?\n\n           You’re going to provide evidence and they are, too,\n     right?\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: Well, what I’m saying, on that issue,\n     nobody has a burden. What I’m asking you is: Would you\n     need - - in order for you to answer that question, would you\n     require the Defense to provide you with mitigation evidence\n     before you could answer Special Issue Number Four?\n\n     [Jackson]: Yes.\n\n(RR15:109-10).   The defense immediately concluded its questioning.\n\n(RR15:110).\n\n     Jackson was not challengeable for cause on the basis of the above-\n\nmentioned exchange. A veniremember is not challengeable for cause\n\nsimply because she will place the burden of proof on mitigation on the\n\ndefense. Saldano, 232 S.W.3d at 92.\n\n                                    90\n\f         Burden of Proof – Intellectual Disability Special Issue\n\n     During questioning, defense counsel reminded Jackson that the\n\ndefense bears the burden on the intellectual disability special issue.\n\n(RR15:92). He asked Jackson what she thought about the fact that the\n\nburden – preponderance of the evidence – was “a lower burden” than\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.     (RR15:93).    Jackson answered, “There\n\nshould be a preponderance of the evidence. I should be able to say I’m\n\nclear on that.”   (RR15:93).    Defense counsel attempted to clarify\n\nJackson’s definition. The following exchange took place:\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: How clear would you want to be?\n\n     [Jackson]: Clear enough to say I feel good about it.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: And if it’s more likely than not, is that\n     enough for you?\n\n     Or would you want “I want to be really sure. I want to be\n     sure beyond a reasonable doubt”?\n\n     [Jackson]: I want to be sure.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: And sure, in your mind, does that also fit\n     into your definition of beyond a reasonable doubt? However\n     you view it. We can’t define it for you.\n\n\n\n\n                                     91\n\f     [Jackson]:   Maybe, beyond a reasonable doubt             is\n     preponderance or different. But the same kind of - -\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: I’m sorry?\n\n     [Jackson]: I said, they’re kind of the same. I want to be\n     clear either way.\n\n(RR15:93-94).   Defense counsel tried to understand whether Jackson’s\n\nneed to be “clear” was equivalent to a preponderance of the evidence or\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. (RR15:93-98). Jackson would not be pinned\n\ndown except to say that she would “want to be sure.” (RR15:95). There\n\nis no evidence to suggest that Jackson would increase the burden on the\n\ndefense on this issue. Indeed, she testified that she “would want to\n\nunderstand and be sure, based on whatever the criteria is.” (RR15:97)\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n     Appellant has failed to show that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge for cause against Jackson. Issue 10\n\nshould be overruled.\n\n                       Issue 11: David Darden\n\n     Appellant challenged Darden for the following reasons: (1) the\n\nresponses in his questionnaire show that Darden had already formed\n\nthe opinion that the appropriate punishment in this type of case was\n\n                                  92\n\fthe death penalty; and, (2) he believed that if a person was guilty of\n\ncapital murder, that person will always be a future danger.    (RR16:72-\n\n73).\n\n                               Questionnaire\n\n       After questioning, the defense challenged Darden for cause based\n\non his responses to two questions on his questionnaire: Question 8 and\n\nQuestion 11. (Darden, Juror 186, Q.p.3). Question 8 asks jurors “For\n\nwhat crimes do you think the death penalty is the proper\n\npunishment?”      (Darden, Juror 186, Q p.3) (emphasis in original).\n\nDarden wrote, “murder in the commission of crimes.” (Darden, Juror\n\n186, Q p.3).    Darden’s response does not reflect a bias against the law\n\nor Appellant.    To the contrary, Darden’s response was consistent with\n\nthe law.    The law provides that the death penalty is available for\n\nintentional murder committed in the course of committing or\n\nattempting to commit certain specified offenses. See Tex. Penal Code\n\nAnn. § 19.03(a)(2) (West Supp. 2015) (capital murder includes\n\nintentional murder “in the course of committing or attempting to\n\ncommit kidnapping, burglary, robbery, aggravated sexual assault,\n\narson, obstruction or retaliation, or terroristic threat”).\n\n\n                                      93\n\f      Question 11 asks jurors whether they agree with the statement\n\nthat “‘The death penalty is reserved for those defendants that are such\n\na threat to society that even incarceration does not remove the\n\npossibility of future violent acts.’” (Darden, Juror 186, Q p.3). Darden\n\nwrote that he agreed with the statement and that “if his/her crimes are\n\nthat bad, death is appropriate in my mind.” (Darden, Juror 186, Q p.3).\n\nAs above, this response does not reflect a bias against the law or\n\nAppellant and, in fact, was consistent with the law. In a death penalty\n\ncase, if the defendant is found guilty, jurors are asked to decide\n\n“whether there is a probability that the defendant would commit\n\ncriminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to\n\nsociety[.]”   Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.0711, §3(b)(2) (West\n\nSupp. 2015). Although the wording is slightly different, the statement\n\nin Question 11 is essentially asking jurors whether they agree with the\n\nlaw. Darden’s response indicated an agreement with – not bias against\n\n– the law.\n\n                        Future Dangerousness\n\n      Appellant also challenged Darden for cause because when he was\n\nasked for “his personal views” regarding the future danger special issue,\n\n\n                                   94\n\fDarden “indicated . . . once he’s been convinced that the person is guilty\n\nof capital murder . . . and he was convinced that the person would be a\n\nfuture danger, that he could never answer Special Issue Number Three\n\nin a way that would result in a life sentence.” (RR16:73).       This basis\n\nfor challenge is not completely clear. If a juror were to find, as counsel’s\n\nchallenge suggests, that a person is a “future danger,” then, following\n\nhis oath, the juror would answer the future danger special issue in the\n\naffirmative. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art 37.0711(e) (West Supp.\n\n2015).   If a juror were to find that a person is a “future danger,” then,\n\nfollowing his oath, the juror would not answer the future danger special\n\nissue in the negative, which would then result in a life sentence.\n\n     During the Defense’s voir dire, counsel asked multiple questions\n\nabout Darden’s feelings about voting for a convicted capital murderer to\n\nreceive a life sentence. (RR16:63-67). At no point, however, did he\n\nexplain the law and then ask whether Darden could set aside his\n\nfeelings and follow the law. See generally Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667\n\n(explaining that, before a prospective juror can be excused for bias, the\n\nlaw must be explained to him and he must be asked whether he can\n\nfollow that law regardless of his personal views).\n\n\n                                     95\n\f       To the extent that any of Darden’s responses during the defense\n\nvoir dire may be interpreted as contradicting his responses during the\n\nState’s voir dire, this Court should defer to the trial court’s resolution of\n\nhis responses.   See Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 744. The reviewing court\n\nmust give great deference to the trial court’s decision on a challenge for\n\ncause based on the trial judge’s opportunity to observe the venire\n\nmember during voir dire. Id. When the record reflects that a prospective\n\njuror vacillated or equivocated on his ability to follow the law, the\n\nreviewing court must defer to the trial judge. Gardner, 306 S.W.3d at\n\n295.\n\n       Appellant has failed to show that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge for cause against Darden. Issue 11\n\nshould be overruled.\n\n                         Issue 12: Delores Sawyer\n\n       Appellant challenged Sawyer for cause because, on two occasions,\n\nshe testified that in deciding the mitigation special issue, she would\n\ntake Appellant’s facial expressions into account. (RR19:224-25).\n\nDuring the State’s voir dire, in response to a line of questioning\n\n\n\n\n                                     96\n\fregarding her ability to find that a person would not be a future danger,\n\nthe following exchange took place:\n\n     [Sawyer]: Because, once again, I haven’t heard all the facts.\n     I believe, if a person shows remorse or some sign of\n     rehabilitation, there’s a possibility that that may not occur\n     in future situations.\n\n     [Prosecutor]: Okay. Tell me what you mean by “remorse”.\n     [sic]\n\n     [Sawyer]: What I do, I pay a lot [of] attention to their\n     demeanor, the body language, if they appear to be\n     somewhat hostile or somewhat combative. You don’t have\n     to be verbal, as far as being combative or hostile. You can\n     look at a person’s body language, his or her eye contact. I’m\n     very good be [sic] reading someone.\n\n     I guess, it comes from my law enforcement training in the\n     past. Because, a lot of times in-law enforcement, you cannot\n     survive if you are not aware of a potential act or an attack\n     within the law enforcement environment. Not only do you\n     have to work in a law enforcement environment, it can\n     happen on your job. We see this everyday.\n\n     What just recently happened in Fort Hood. No one came to\n     work that day and think [sic] that they’re going to have an\n     adverse situation to deal with. So it just depends on a lot of\n     variables and factors. But the individual - - I don’t know\n     the history. It just kind of depends on what I find out about\n     that person. It doesn’t have to be verbal. Body language,\n     like I said. Showing some sign of remorse.\n\n\n                                     97\n\f(RR19:179-80).   During the defense’s voir dire, counsel questioned\n\nSawyer as follows:\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: Let me just ask you this: Do you feel\n     like that you would need to hear from the Defendant, to find\n     out if he had remorse for something, in a hypothetical case?\n\n     Would you need to hear how that person felt about it, before\n     you could consider a life sentence?\n\n     [Sawyer]: No. Like I said, the facts would have already\n     been presented. Like I said earlier, I would watch the\n     Defendant’s body language.       He doesn’t have to say\n     anything. You can tell a lot about a person, whether or not\n     he is feeling remorse, by his body language. If you’re in a\n     court of law and the Defendant (demonstrating). [sic] If\n     you’re in a court of law and the Defendant is, like, just so\n     distraught by what has occurred - -\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: Okay. All right. So you can read ‘em,\n     kind of.\n\n     [Sawyer]: Yes.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]:     Have you been able to read the\n     Defendant in this courtroom today?\n\n     [Sawyer]: Well, when I came in here, I was focusing over\n     here. I saw him. Now, I’m looking at him now. He seems\n     calm and - - I don’t want to use - - well, tranquil means the\n     same as calm. But he seems just calm. Not agitated, not - -\n     he doesn’t appear hostile to me.\n\n\n                                  98\n\f     [Defense Counsel]: Okay. So have you formed any opinions\n     about his character, in just observing him in court?\n\n     [Sawyer]: No, I have not. Once I hear the facts, I may.\n     But, at this point, no.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: Okay. And how he reacts to whatever\n     he hears in court.\n\n     [Sawyer]: Yes.\n\n(RR19:218-20).    The prosecutor objected that the defense was “inviting\n\nthe juror to consider any facts and circumstances that would be outside\n\nof the record.” (RR19:220). The objection was sustained. (RR19:220).\n\n     A defendant’s non-testimonial demeanor is not evidence subject to\n\nreference by the State or the defense. See Good v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1485240\"><a href=\"/opinion/1485240/good-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">723</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">734</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 736 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986)(discussing comment on defendant’s\n\ndemeanor by the State).     It follows that jurors should not consider the\n\ndefendant’s non-testimonial demeanor. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann.\n\nart. 38.08 (West 2005) (prohibiting any comment on the right of an\n\naccused to remain silent or his failure to testify).\n\n     In this case, defense counsel never explained to Sawyer that if she\n\nwere selected as a juror, she would not be allowed to consider\n\nAppellant’s non-testimonial demeanor.          She never asked whether\n\n                                     99\n\fSawyer could set aside her desire to consider Appellant’s demeanor and\n\nconsider only the evidence properly presented.        See Threadgill, 146\n\nS.W.3d at 667.\n\n     On appeal, Appellant also challenges Sawyer because, in her\n\nquestionnaire, she indicated support for the death penalty; she thought\n\nthe death penalty was seldom used; and she agreed with a statement\n\nthat jurors should do what they believe is right, even if it is contrary to\n\nthe law. (Appellant’s Br. p.59). These complaints are not preserved for\n\nreview because they were not raised at trial. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a)\n\n(providing that a timely specific trial objection is prerequisite to\n\npresenting a complaint on appellate review).\n\n     Appellant has failed to show that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge for cause against Sawyer. Issue 12\n\nshould be overruled.\n\n                       Issue 13: Jonathan Henderson\n\n     Appellant challenged Henderson for cause because: (1) once he\n\nfound a person to be a future danger, the mitigation issue “would really\n\nnot be much to him”; and (2) he was evasive. (RR20:201-02).\n\n\n\n\n                                    100\n\f                   Future Dangerousness/Mitigation\n\n     Appellant challenged Henderson on the basis that he would\n\nautomatically assess the death penalty if he found that the murder was\n\ncommitted deliberately and if the defendant was not intellectually\n\ndisabled and was a future danger. During the State’s voir dire, however,\n\nHenderson testified that he was “[a]bsolutely” open to hearing evidence\n\nin mitigation. (RR20:157). He affirmed that he would keep an open\n\nmind and consider all evidence when deciding the mitigation special\n\nissue. (RR20:163-64).   He confirmed his understanding that there are\n\nno “automatic answers.” (RR20:164).\n\n     During the defense’s voir dire, the following exchange took place:\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: Right. In a hypothetical situation, what\n     are your feelings about the person not receiving the death\n     penalty but receive [sic] a life sentence instead?\n\n     Do you have any feelings, either way?\n\n     [Henderson]: Yes, I do.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: Tell me. What are they?\n\n     [Henderson]: With the hypothetical situation of a man or\n     woman or a person, I should say, committing that type of a\n     crime, it’s almost like an eye for an eye. If they can do it,\n     then they ought to be able to receive it.\n\n                                  101\n\f     ...\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: “You take a life, we take your life.”\n\n     What do you think about that?\n\n     [Henderson]: That’s when I say the facts have to be in line.\n     Because taking a life for a life, and all the facts are the\n     same, leading to that point, then it should be.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: Then this should be the death penalty\n     instead of life?\n\n     Is that what you’re saying?\n\n     [Henderson]: Yes.\n\n(RR20:174-76).    Henderson did not testify that he would not consider\n\nevidence in mitigation or that he would automatically answer the\n\nspecial issues in a way that the death penalty would result.         He\n\ntestified that “the facts have to be in line.” (RR20:175).\n\n     Defense counsel later returned to the subject and asked for\n\nHenderson’s thoughts about a life sentence if the capital murder was\n\ncommitted deliberately by a defendant who is not intellectually disabled\n\nand is a future danger. (RR20:191). Henderson said that “[his] answer\n\nright now would be no life sentence.” (RR20:191). At this point in\n\n\n\n                                    102\n\fquestioning, however, counsel did not remind Henderson that he would\n\nstill have to consider the mitigation special issue; he asked only for his\n\nfeelings up to the future danger special issue.      See Threadgill, 146\n\nS.W.3d at 667.    In any event, when counsel suggested that Henderson\n\nwould not “need to go on anymore[,]” Henderson’s answer changed.\n\n(RR20:193).      Henderson testified that “that’s where that two-fold\n\nquestion comes in again.” (RR20:193).      He testified that “[w]ith [his]\n\nopen mind, [he] would still want to go on.”      (RR20:193).     He later\n\ntestified that “of course [he] would” be open to answering the mitigation\n\nspecial issue in a way that a life sentence would result. (RR20:195-96).\n\n                                Evasive\n\n     Appellant also challenged Henderson on the basis that he was\n\nevasive during the defense voir dire.       A thorough review of the\n\ntranscript shows that Henderson was not evasive.         Rather, he was\n\nsimply finding it difficult to answer some of counsel’s questions with\n\njust a yes or no answer. The following exchange took place:\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: No, I know. Because I’m asking you\n     about your feelings.\n\n     [Henderson]: And I’m telling you. And I want you to\n     understand that my feelings still ride with, I want to go\n\n                                   103\n\f     through the process before I make a decision. But you’re\n     wanting to know, if I had all of these things and all of that\n     came about, then would I say “yes” or “no” to this. That’s an\n     answer. And I don’t want to answer. But I’ve got to give\n     you something. And that answer is what you want to hear\n     right now, is an answer. So I’m giving you an answer, but\n     I’m not answering you, according to how I feel. If that\n     makes any sense.\n\n(RR20:193-94).     A reviewing court should give particular deference\n\nwhen the veniremember’s answers unclear or contradictory.            See\n\nGonzales v.

Issue\n\n13 should be overruled.\n\n                          Issue 14: Isaac Tschewik\n\n     Appellant challenged Tschewik for cause on the basis that he\n\nwould place a burden on the defense in connection with the mitigation\n\nspecial issue. (RR26:340). The following exchange took place during\n\nthe defense voir dire:\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: . . .   “For me to be able to say that\n     person should receive a life sentence instead of a death\n     sentence, you’re going to have to prove to me mitigation.\n     I’m going to place that burden on you to show me that I\n     should not give him the death penalty.”\n\n                                    104\n\f           What do you think?\n\n     [Tschewik]: I think that’s exactly where I am.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: Okay. . . . The law says you can’t place\n     a burden on us.\n\n          Are you telling me that you would place the burden on\n     the Defense to convince you that he shouldn’t receive the\n     death penalty, after you’ve been convinced that he’s a future\n     danger?\n\n     [Tschewik]: Well, I haven’t thought of it that way. I don’t\n     know that I’m placing a burden on the Defense. I’m just\n     trying to keep an open mind. I’m just saying that, you\n     know, it would be difficult to find something in my own\n     mind that will mitigate the circumstances.\n\n           If I heard it and I believed it then, yes, I could do that.\n     I could certainly accept life punishment.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: Okay. You say you may not place a\n     burden. But would you want us - - would you require the\n     Defense to provide you that evidence?\n\n     [Tschewik]: Well, I don’t know where else it’s going to come\n     from.\n\n(RR26:335-36). Tschewik was not challengeable for cause on the basis\n\nof this exchange.   Because there is no law which places the burden of\n\nproof on the State regarding the mitigation issue, a veniremember is\n                                    105\n\fnot challengeable for cause simply because he would place the burden of\n\nproof on this issue on the defense.

Crim. App. 1994).\n\n     Appellant has failed to show that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge for cause against Tschewik. Issue 14\n\nshould be overruled.\n\n                       Issue 15: Michael Dawson\n\n     Appellant challenged Dawson for cause on the basis that (1) he\n\nbelieves in the principle of an eye for an eye; (2) he believes intentional\n\nmurder deserves the death penalty; and, (3) he has reservations about\n\nan individual with intellectual disability receiving a life sentence\n\nbecause that person knows the difference between right and wrong.\n\n                               Eye for an Eye\n\n     Appellant    challenged     Dawson    for   cause   “based   on   his\n\nquestionnaire which, over and over again, he would tell us under oath\n\nthat he believed in the principle of an eye for an eye[.]” (RR27:153).\n\nOn Question #1, which asked whether he was in favor of the death\n\npenalty, Dawson wrote that he “believe[s] in the principle of an eye for\n\n\n                                    106\n\fan eye.” (Dawson, Juror 469, Q p.1). On Question #18, he agreed that\n\nhe believes in the principle of an eye for an eye and referenced his\n\nanswer to Question #1.      (Dawson, Juror 469, Q p.8).      Dawson’s\n\nanswers to these questions do not demonstrate a clear bias against the\n\nlaw.    The State notes that in response to Question #5, Dawson agreed\n\nthat a life sentence would be appropriate in the proper circumstances.\n\n(Dawson, Juror 469, Q p.3). During questioning, he agreed on multiple\n\noccasions that a life sentence may be the appropriate punishment in the\n\nproper case. (RR27:110, 114, 131, 144-45). And, on multiple occasions\n\nhe agreed that he could listen to the evidence and follow the law.\n\n(RR27: 96, 101-02, 105, 119-21). He testified that “If I’m chosen as a\n\njuror, I have to abide by the law.” (RR27:137).\n\n                           Intentional Murder\n\n       Next, Appellant challenged Dawson based on his belief that “once\n\nyou committed a murder that’s intentional, the death penalty is really\n\nthe only option.” (RR27:153). Appellant cited four responses on\n\nDawson’s questionnaire wherein he indicated that intentional murder\n\nwarrants the death penalty. (RR27:153; Dawson, Juror 469, Q pp.2, 3,\n\n4).    During questioning, Dawson acknowledged that in response to\n\n\n                                   107\n\fQuestion 2 on his questionnaire he wrote that the death penalty is\n\nappropriate in all murder cases. He also testified, however, that this\n\nwas just “an answer to a question. But there’s definitely circumstances,\n\nthat all of those things should be weighed.”        (RR27:127-28).      He\n\ntestified that he did not “have an issue” with a life sentence for an\n\nintentional murder. (RR27:131). He agreed that a life sentence could\n\nbe the proper punishment for intentional murder. (RR27:131).\n\n                            Right from Wrong\n\n     Appellant challenged Dawson because he expressed reservation\n\nabout an individual with intellectual disability not being eligible for the\n\ndeath penalty if the individual knows right from wrong. (RR27:153).\n\nDuring questioning, Dawson initially testified that he understood that\n\nan individual with intellectual disability is not eligible to receive the\n\ndeath penalty.    (RR27:132).     He stated, “You don’t want to pass\n\njudgment on someone who committed a crime that was not in their full\n\ncapacity, making judgments.”      (RR27:132-33).    When asked for his\n\nthoughts about an individual with intellectual disability not being\n\neligible for the death penalty even though that person knows right from\n\nwrong, Dawson testified:\n\n\n                                    108\n\f     It’s definitely an interesting dilemma, in that you’re saying\n     someone does meet that criteria and knows right from\n     wrong. I would say that’s more rare than not. But I guess,\n     in that circumstance, you know, it’s kind of - - I don’t know.\n     Almost a gray area. You have to weigh what you’re given\n     and make a decision, I guess.\n\n(RR27:134).     Dawson agreed with defense counsel’s proposition that\n\nhis “belief system” tells him that even if a person is intellectually\n\ndisabled, that person should face the death penalty if that person knows\n\nright from wrong. (RR27:136). Nevertheless, he testified that if he was\n\nchosen as a juror, he would abide by the law.                  (RR27:137).\n\nAdditionally, later in voir dire, Dawson disagreed that he would\n\nincrease the burden on intellectual disability special issue in an effort to\n\nensure the death penalty. (RR27:141-42). The following exchange took\n\nplace:\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: Some people will say, “Do you know\n     what? Because of the way I value life, I’m not going to let\n     this person avoid the death penalty unless I’m positive that\n     they’re mentally I [sic] retarded.\n\n     “They killed somebody. They knew right from wrong, and\n     they did it intentionally.”\n\n     What do you think about that?\n\n\n\n                                    109\n\f     [Dawson]:     I think that’s a little too harsh.        This\n     questionnaire is very direct and black and white. You\n     know, what you’re proposing, there’s things to be\n     considered. There are gray areas. There are definitely\n     circumstances.    That’s why we do this process.         I’m\n     definitely open-minded, and I can hear that and decide.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: I have no doubt that you will keep an\n     open mind and listen to the evidence. But what I’m asking\n     you is this: There’s some people that say, “Do you know\n     what? For me to say this person is mentally retarded and\n     just let them avoid the death penalty when I know they\n     committed an intentional murder of another human being\n     while committing a felony, I’m going to have to be really\n     convinced that they’re mentally retarded.\n\n     “If not, I may be letting some guy off from getting the death\n     penalty, who I believe deserves it.”\n\n     [Dawson]: It’s about what the law requires. That’s what I\n     have to follow. That’s what I have to base my opinion on.\n     It’s not whether or not I think he’s really mentally retarded\n     or not. It’s based on what the law says.\n\n(RR27:141-42).\n\n     A review of Dawson’s voir dire shows no bias as a matter of law.\n\nIndeed, as previously stated, Dawson agreed on multiple occasions that\n\nhe could listen to the evidence and follow the law. (RR27:96, 101-02,\n\n105, 119-21).\n\n\n                                  110\n\f                             Questionnaire\n\n     On appeal, Appellant lists a number of other responses Dawson\n\nwrote in his questionnaire that he claims made Dawson challengeable\n\nfor cause.    (Appellant’s Brief p.64).    These arguments were not\n\npresented to the trial court and therefore are not preserved. See Tex. R.\n\nApp. P. 33.1(a).\n\n     Appellant has failed to show that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge for cause against Dawson. Issue 15\n\nshould be overruled.\n\n                    Issue 16: Angela Thorpe-Harris\n\n     Appellant challenged Thorpe-Harris for cause on the basis of her\n\ntestimony that she would place a burden on the defense in connection\n\nwith the deliberateness special issue. (RR28:129).\n\n                            Burden of Proof\n\n     During the voir dire, defense counsel asked Thorpe-Harris for her\n\nthoughts about a life sentence for an individual who committed the\n\noffense deliberately and was not intellectually disabled. (RR28:120).\n\nThe following exchange took place:\n\n     [Thorpe-Harris]: If they did it deliberately?\n\n\n                                     111\n\f[Defense Counsel]: Uh-huh.\n\n[Thorpe-Harris]: I could consider it. But I know personally\nit would take a little bit of proving.\n\n[Defense Counsel]: Who would have to prove what, for a life\nsentence?\n\n[Thorpe-Harris]: You (indicating). Your side. You have to\nconvince me.\n\n...\n\n[Defense Counsel]: Okay. The law says, you can’t place\nthat burden on me. But, honestly, you’d do that, correct?\n\n[Thorpe-Harris]: Right.\n\n[Defense Counsel]: And there’s nothing wrong with saying\nthat. Like I said, that’s why we ask these questions. I’m\nsure you didn’t get up today saying to yourself “I know\neverything about capital murder law and I know exactly\nhow I would act.” But you know yourself.\n\n[Thorpe-Harris]: I know the burden is supposed to be on the\nState’s side for that question. But I’m also going to be\nkeying in on what you’re saying, too.\n\n[Defense Counsel]: You would still place a burden on us to\nshow you that it wasn’t deliberate. Because it’s kind of an\nimportant decision that you have to make, right?\n\n[Thorpe-Harris]: Yes.\n\n                             112\n\f     [Defense Counsel]: That’s really how you feel?\n\n     [Thorpe-Harris]: Yes.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: So if the Judge were to ask you, “Hey,\n     Ms. Thorpe-Harris, you understand that you can’t place a\n     burden on the Defense,” you would, correct?\n\n     [Thorpe-Harris]: Yeah. I’m going to listen to you. Yeah.\n\n(RR28:120-22).\n\n     After the defense asserted its challenge against Thorpe-Harris,\n\nshe was returned to the courtroom for the judge to clarify her\n\ntestimony.       (RR28:130).   The       judge   confirmed   Thorpe-Harris’\n\nunderstanding that the State – and not the Defense – has the burden of\n\nproof on the deliberateness special issue. (RR28:130-31). The following\n\nexchange then took place:\n\n     [Trial Court]: Okay. Would you require that the Defense\n     prove to you that the act was not deliberately?\n\n     Or would you follow the law and just - - if the State proved\n     to you beyond a reasonable doubt that it was deliberate,\n     could you make your decision based on that?\n\n     Or if the State failed to prove to you that it was deliberate,\n     then could you make your decision based on that?\n\n\n                                   113\n\f     [Thorpe-Harris]: Yeah, I could.       I could do it, based on\n     whatever the State decides.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, I think she also told us that\n     she would place a burden on us to prove - - somewhat of a\n     burden on us to prove that it wasn’t deliberate. I would ask\n     you to inquire - - first of all ask, if she did say that to us on\n     the record.\n\n     [Trial Court]: Do you recall saying that?\n\n     [Thorpe-Harris]: Yeah. Because I’m just sort of assuming\n     that the Defense is going to be speaking to it - - I assume - -\n     during the phase. So I’m going to be listening to what they\n     say, too. But I know the burden of proof, from what they’ve\n     told me, is on the State.\n\n     [Trial Court]: You understand that the burden of proof is\n     solely upon the State?\n\n     [Thorpe-Harris]: Yes.\n\n(RR28:32).\n\n     The totality of Thorpe-Harris’s testimony shows that she would\n\nnot place a burden on the defense in connection with the deliberateness\n\nspecial issue. Rather, she “just sort of assum[ed] that the Defense is\n\ngoing to be speaking to” that issue and she would listen to their\n\nevidence.    (RR28:132).      To the extent that Thorpe-Harris was\n\n\n\n                                    114\n\fequivocating on her ability to follow the law, the reviewing court must\n\ndefer to the trial judge. Gardner, 306 S.W.3d at 295.\n\n                            Claims on Appeal\n\n       On appeal, Appellant challenges Thorpe-Harris because she would\n\nrequire severe intellectual disability to assess a life sentence and\n\nbecause she did not trust expert testimony. He also cites a number of\n\nthe responses she gave on her questionnaire. (Appellant’s Brief p. 66-\n\n67).   These complaints are not preserved for review because they were\n\nnot raised at trial. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a) (providing that a timely\n\nspecific trial objection is prerequisite to presenting a complaint on\n\nappellate review).\n\n       Appellant has failed to show that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge for cause against Thorpe-Harris.\n\nIssue 16 should be overruled.\n\n                     Issue 17: Christopher Weinzapfel\n\n       Appellant challenged Weinzapfel for cause because: (1) he was\n\nfamiliar with the case; (2) he was evasive in answering questions; and\n\n(3) he invoked the Fifth Amendment. (RR32:89).\n\n\n\n\n                                   115\n\f                         Familiarity with Case\n\n     Weinzapfel was in high school when the instant offense occurred.\n\n(RR32:14-15). He did not recall all of the details of the case, but he did\n\nremember that it “was the headlined story” and “that there was mental\n\nhealth that was in question and whether or not they were going to seek\n\nthe death penalty[.]” (RR32:50, 51).      At the time, in school, the issue\n\n“from a generic standpoint” was used as a source of discussion and\n\ndebate. (RR32:51).    “We argued both sides of that [issue].” (RR32:51).\n\nAlthough he knew the details of this case when he was in school, he\n\ncould not presently recall them “off the top of [his] head.” (RR32:87).\n\n     Weinzapfel was not challengeable for cause simply because he had\n\nsome knowledge of the facts of the case. Qualified jurors need not be\n\ntotally ignorant of the facts and issues involved in the case.            See\n\nMurphy v. Florida, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109270\"><a href=\"/opinion/109270/murphy-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">794</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 799-800 (1975).        Even if this Court\n\nassumes that Weinzapfel had some limited knowledge of the case, he\n\nnevertheless denied having a pre-formed opinion regarding the case.\n\n(RR32:51-52). Indeed, he stated, “I have to be honest with you, I don’t\n\nremember which side it went. I’ve had too much other stuff on my plate\n\n\n\n\n                                    116\n\fto think too much about it.” (RR32:52). There is nothing in the record\n\nto show that Weinzapfel was biased against Appellant.\n\n                                Evasive\n\n     Appellant challenged Weinzapfel on the basis of his being\n\n“evasive” during questioning. At one point during questioning, defense\n\ncounsel began a series of questions asking Weinzapfel for his thoughts\n\nabout a life sentence if the offense was determined to be deliberate, and\n\nthen if the person is found to be a future danger.         (RR32:79-81).\n\nWeinzapfel testified that he was “stuck in the thought process.”\n\n(RR32:81).   He was having difficulty answering counsel’s questions\n\nwithout having the evidence. (RR32:81). Counsel took the questioning a\n\nstep further and asked whether the circumstances of the defendant’s\n\nchildhood or disabilities would be relevant.    (RR32:82).   Weinzapfel\n\nresponded:\n\n     Again, that’s why I’m hoping that it’s not a matter of what I\n     think but it’s a matter of what I see and what evidence is\n     presented. And then - - I’m not trying to evade that answer.\n     I don’t know. It’s a pretty serious answer, to just be\n     halfhearted about.\n\n\n\n\n                                   117\n\f(RR32:82). A review of the record shows that Weinzapfel was not trying\n\nto be evasive; he was simply finding it difficult to thoughtfully answer\n\ncounsel’s questions without knowing the evidence. (RR32:82).\n\n                            Fifth Amendment\n\n     Appellant also challenged Weinzapfel because he invoked the\n\nFifth Amendment. (RR32:62, 64).          A review of the record shows that\n\nWeinzapfel asked to “take the Fifth” on two occasions, but he did so, not\n\nin the traditional sense.    (RR32:62, 64). The first time Weinzapfel\n\nasked to take the Fifth, he and defense counsel were discussing\n\nWeinzapfel’s ability to concentrate on the evidence given the fact that\n\nhe is the sole provider in his family and would be missing two weeks of\n\nwork if he were seated as a juror.          (RR32:60-62).   The following\n\nexchange took place:\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: So, tell me: Would it be such a concern\n     that it would be hard for to [sic] you concentrate on the\n     evidence?\n\n     [Weinzapfel]: Can I take the Fifth? I have to be honest\n     with you, I work in a profession where I go to work\n     everyday. I deal with life and death. The things that are\n     happening, I can’t take with me. So I wouldn’t be very\n     honest with you, if I said it would sway me. I have to make\n     those decisions, regardless. It is a financial burden. It’s\n\n\n                                   118\n\f     going to cost my family - - cost me the ability. But, hey, like\n     I said before, that’s part of it.\n\n(RR32:62).\n\n     The second time Weinzapfel asked to take the Fifth he and\n\ndefense counsel were discussing Weinzapfel’s connection with the Darlie\n\nRoutier capital murder case. (RR32:64).       Weinzapfel is a firefighter\n\nand paramedic. (RR32:17).      His colleagues, including his best friend,\n\nwere “the primary medics on the case.” (RR32:64).       His testimony is\n\nnot completely clear, but it appears that Weinzapfel helped “prep” his\n\ncolleagues for trial.    (RR32:64).      Defense counsel asked what\n\nWeinzapfel thought “about all that?” (RR32:64). Weinzapfel testified:\n\n     Again, I take the Fifth on that. I’d rather not give an\n     opinion. It’s one of those things to sit back and watch the\n     drama unfold. Knowing what was known and the fact [sic]\n     as they were, with all the details and everything else, it’s a\n     little different than watching it on the news.\n\n(RR32:64).\n\n     The fact that Weinzapfel continued to respond to questioning\n\ndespite his requests to “take the Fifth,” proves that he was not truly\n\nattempting to invoke the Fifth Amendment. Indeed, he continued to\n\nrespond to questioning for an additional 24 pages. (RR32:64-88). This\n\n\n                                   119\n\frefutes trial counsel’s claim that Weinzapfel “would just not answer the\n\nquestion purported [sic] to him.” (RR32:89). It appears that Weinzapfel\n\nused his request to “take the Fifth” in an effort to try to bring\n\nquestioning on a particular topic to a close.\n\n                                Darlie Routier\n\n     On appeal, Appellant also challenges Weinzapfel on the basis of\n\nhis involvement in the Routier case. He fails to state, however, how\n\nthis renders him challengeable.       Regardless, this complaint was not\n\npreserved for review because it was not raised at trial. See Tex. R. App.\n\nP. 33.1(a). In any event, Weinzapfel testified that he was not involved\n\nin investigating the Routier case.         (RR32:63-64). As stated above,\n\nWeinzapfel was apparently involved in helping his colleagues prepare to\n\ntestify for trial. (RR32:64).   He testified that his “directions were very\n\nspecific . . . to make sure those guys were articulate and comfortable\n\nand knew exactly what they were needing to know, as far as from the\n\nmedical side of it.” (RR32:64).\n\n      Appellant has failed to show that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge for cause against Weinzapfel. Issue\n\n17 should be overruled.\n\n\n                                     120\n\f                            Issue 18: Phillip Rapp\n\n        Appellant challenged Rapp for cause for the following reasons: (1)\n\nin his questionnaire he indicated strong feelings in favor of the death\n\npenalty; and (2) he did not understand the questions asked during voir\n\ndire.\n\n                                  Death-Prone\n\n        Appellant    challenged    Rapp       because   he   “indicated    in   his\n\nquestionnaire he has strong feelings for the death penalty,” which\n\nAppellant contended demonstrated a bias against a life sentence.\n\n(RR42:70).          Counsel’s challenge is overly general and fails to\n\nspecifically describe why he believes Rapp is biased.23 Regardless, the\n\nrecord reflects that Rapp would have to hear “[e]verything in the facts”\n\nbefore he could make a decision regarding punishment. (RR42:42-43).\n\nHe denied that he was the type of person that would automatically vote\n\nto assess the death penalty. (RR42:65).             During questioning by the\n\ndefense, Rapp testified that he “would be open to what is presented.\n\nBut, [he] still feel[s] more strongly to the death penalty as oppose [sic]\n\n23 On appeal, Appellant cites a number of responses in Rapp’s questionnaire which\nhe contends demonstrate Rapp’s bias. (Appellant’s Brief pp.69-70). When trial\ncounsel made his challenge in the trial court, he did not specify the responses that\nformed the basis for his challenge. As such, it is the State’s position that he has\nfailed to properly preserve this claim for appellate review.\n                                        121\n\fto a life sentence.” (RR42:67-68). A juror may express strong feelings\n\nfor imposing a death sentence, but “if he also unequivocally states that\n\nhe could set aside those feelings and follow the trial court’s instructions\n\non the law and would base his verdict or his answers to the special\n\nissues on the evidence adduced,” he is not disqualified as a matter of\n\nlaw.

App. 1987).\n\nThus, the trial court properly denied Appellant’s challenge on this basis.\n\n                                Confusion\n\n     Appellant also challenged Rapp because “he might not understand\n\nexactly the questions that were proposed to him and may have a\n\nmisunderstanding as to how the scheme works.” (RR42:70).           During\n\nthe State’s voir dire, Rapp affirmed that he understood the process.\n\n(RR42:45, 49, 50, 54, 57). During questioning by the defense, however,\n\nRapp got confused by counsel’s questions.         Defense counsel asked\n\nwhether Rapp could answer the intellectual disability special issue in\n\nthe affirmative, if proven by the evidence.      (RR42:65-66).   Initially,\n\nRapp said no. (RR42:66). When counsel rephrased his question to be\n\nsure that Rapp understood his question, Rapp apologized and testified\n\nthat his answer was yes, he could answer the intellectual disability\n\n\n                                    122\n\fissue in the affirmative. (RR42:67).         Later in the exchange, counsel\n\nasked whether Rapp could “answer it ‘no[.]’”            (RR42:68).    Rapp\n\nanswered that he could not. (RR42:68). Counsel again attempted to\n\nclarify his question.   (RR42:68).       Rapp asked whether counsel was\n\nasking if he could answer the intellectual disability question no.\n\n(RR42:68).   He then testified that he could answer the intellectual\n\ndisability special issue in the negative. (RR42:68).\n\n     Appellant complains that Rapp was confused, yet the questions\n\nRapp was being asked were, in fact, confusing. At times, it was unclear\n\nwhat special issue counsel was asking Rapp to respond to. Once the\n\nquestions were clarified, Rapp was able to respond appropriately.\n\nThere is nothing in the record to show that Rapp misunderstood the\n\nprocess to be followed in this case.\n\n     Appellant has failed to show that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge for cause against Rapp. Issue 18\n\nshould be overruled.\n\n                         Issue 19: Nancy Ramos\n\n     Appellant challenged Ramos for cause because she ranked herself\n\nas a “1” on Question 2 of her questionnaire, indicating a belief that “the\n\n\n                                       123\n\fdeath penalty is appropriate in all murder cases.” (Ramos, Juror 1025,\n\nQ p.2).   Other responses on her questionnaire, however, demonstrate\n\nthat Ramos’ beliefs regarding the death penalty are not quite as rigid as\n\nher self-ranking would make it seem.\n\n     For example, even though Ramos ranked herself as a 1, she\n\nanswered “yes” to Question 5, which asked whether she agreed “that a\n\nlife sentence, rather than the death penalty, would be appropriate\n\nunder the proper circumstances[.]” (Ramos, Juror 1025, Q p.2).        In\n\nresponse to Question 15, she ranked herself a 5 out of 10 on a scale of\n\nhow strongly she holds her belief in the use of the death penalty.\n\n(Ramos, Juror 1025, Q p.3). In response to Question 36C, she indicated\n\nthat she was “uncertain” about whether the death penalty should be\n\nabolished. (Ramos, Juror 1025, Q p.7).      In response to Question 41,\n\nRamos ranked herself a 2 out of 10 on a scale of her attitude toward\n\npunishment in the criminal justice system. (Ramos, Juror 1025, Q p.8).\n\nDuring voir dire, Ramos affirmed that if selected as a juror, she could\n\nlisten and answer the special issues based on the evidence presented.\n\n(RR44:10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18).\n\n\n\n\n                                   124\n\f                            Claims on Appeal\n\n        On appeal, in addition to Ramos’ self-ranking, Appellant cites a\n\nnumber of other responses Ramos gave in her questionnaire.\n\n(Appellant’s Brief p.71). He contends that these responses show Ramos’\n\nbias.    During voir dire, however, Appellant did not question Ramos\n\nabout these responses and he did not mention them during his\n\nchallenge for cause. As such, these complaints are not preserved for\n\nreview. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a).\n\n        Appellant has failed to show that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge for cause against Ramos. Issue 19\n\nshould be overruled.\n\n                           Issue 20: Jay Kirby\n\n        Appellant challenged Kirby for cause because (1) he indicated in\n\nhis questionnaire that the death penalty is appropriate in all murder\n\ncases; and, (2) he declined to name his friend who is a police officer.\n\n                              Questionnaire\n\n        Appellant challenged Kirby “based on his answers on the\n\nquestionnaire; that he believes the death penalty is appropriate in all\n\nmurder cases.” (RR45:68). Kirby ranked himself as a “1” on Question 2\n\n\n                                    125\n\fof his questionnaire, indicating a belief that “the death penalty is\n\nappropriate in all murder cases.”        (Kirby, Juror 1052, Q p.1).   On\n\nQuestion 5, he answered “no” to a question asking if he agreed that a\n\nlife sentence may be appropriate under the proper circumstances.\n\n(Kirby, Juror 1052, Q p.2). He wrote that “[i]f found guilty of murder\n\nwith intent the death penalty should be used.” Id. On Question 9,\n\nKirby wrote that he did not think that “life should be considered in a\n\nmurder case.” (Kirby, Juror 1052, Q p.2).\n\n     While many of Kirby’s responses demonstrate that he is strongly\n\nin favor of the death penalty, they also demonstrate a willingness to\n\nfollow the law. For example, on Question 47, in response to a question\n\nasking whether he agreed or disagreed with the following statement,\n\n“Regardless of what the Judge says the law is, Jurors should do what\n\nthey believe is the right thing to do, even if it goes against the law[,]”\n\nKirby wrote, “Disagree. If the Judge asked me to disregard I will.”\n\n(Kirby, Juror 1052, Q p.9).    When questioned by the State about his\n\nability to “keep an open mind to this process and base [his] answers on\n\nthe evidence,” Kirby testified that he “[could] keep an open mind.”\n\n(RR45:56). He agreed that he could keep an open mind to the process\n\n\n                                   126\n\finvolved in this case. (RR45:56-57). He testified that although he did\n\nnot agree that a defendant does not have to testify, he would follow the\n\nlaw.    (RR45:59).    During questioning by the defense, the following\n\nexchange took place:\n\n       [Defense Counsel]: Some jurors come in and tell us, “You\n       know what? I thought we would just hear evidence and we\n       just check a box, life or death.”\n\n             But now that you understand how this works, are you\n       telling us that you could answer each special issue “yes” or\n       “no” just depending on what you’re convinced of from the\n       evidence?\n\n       [Kirby]: Yes, I can.\n\n       [Defense Counsel]: Even if that leads to a life sentence, you\n       can do that?\n\n       [Kirby]: I believe I can.\n\n       [Defense Counsel]: Because you can see how we would be a\n       little concerned, based on your questionnaire. But now\n       you’re telling us here in court, under oath, that you can do\n       that?\n\n       [Kirby]: Yeah, I believe I can.\n\n(RR45:66-67).     Based on the foregoing, it is clear that Kirby was not\n\ndisqualified as a matter of law. See Cordova, 733 S.W.2d at 184.\n\n                                     127\n\f                          Police Officer Friend\n\n     Appellant also challenged Kirby for cause because Kirby declined\n\nto provide the name of his friend who is a Dallas police officer.\n\n(RR45:68). During questioning by the defense, counsel inquired about\n\nthe fact that, in his questionnaire, Kirby wrote that he has friends who\n\nare police officers. (RR45:65). Kirby testified that has “a friend” who\n\nworks out of the Northwest Police Department.          (RR45:65).   When\n\nasked for his name, Kirby responded that he “would prefer not to, if\n\nthat’s okay.” (RR45:65). Defense counsel did not press Kirby to provide\n\nthe friend’s name, but asked whether he knew if the friend was involved\n\nin the investigation of Appellant’s case. (RR45:65). Kirby testified that\n\nhe knows the friend “socially” and that he did not know whether he was\n\ninvolved. (RR45:65). Without more information, Appellant’s challenge\n\nfails as there is no evidence that Kirby’s friendship with a police officer\n\nmakes him disqualified as a matter of law.     In any event, when asked\n\nwhether he could set aside his relationship with that friend and listen\n\nto the evidence and make a decision based on what he hears in court,\n\nKirby testified, “Sure, I could. Yeah.” (RR45:66).\n\n\n\n\n                                    128\n\f     Appellant has failed to show that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge for cause against Kirby. Issue 20\n\nshould be overruled.\n\n                        Issue 21: Nathan Sosa\n\n     Appellant challenged Sosa for cause because (1) his responses on\n\nhis questionnaire; and, (2) he would only consider a life sentence in\n\nlimited circumstances. (RR46:32).\n\n                            Questionnaire\n\n     Appellant challenged Sosa for cause “based on his answers in the\n\nquestionnaire.” (RR46:32). Appellant did not identify the responses in\n\nthe 22-page questionnaire that he contends render him challengeable\n\nfor cause. As such, this complaint is not preserved for review. See Tex.\n\nR. App. P. 33.1(a).\n\n                                Closure\n\n     Appellant also challenged Sosa for cause because “he’s limited\n\nhimself - - as to when he can consider a life sentence.” (RR46:32). On\n\nQuestion 9 of his questionnaire, in response to the question, “For what\n\ncrimes do you think a sentence of life imprisonment is the proper\n\npunishment[,]” Sosa wrote, “Someone who gives information so as to\n\n\n                                    129\n\fgive closure to love [sic] ones.” (Sosa, Juror 1070, Q p.3).         During\n\nquestioning,     defense   counsel   inquired   regarding   this   response.\n\n(RR46:27-28).     Sosa explained that his answer simply represented an\n\nexample of a case in which he would agree that a life sentence was\n\nproper: if someone committed murder and hid the victims’ bodies, he\n\nshould get a life sentence if he discloses the location of the bodies so\n\nthat the family has “closure.” (RR46:28).        Importantly, Sosa did not\n\ntestify that his example represented the only situation in which a life\n\nsentence would be appropriate.       Quite to the contrary, he testified that\n\nhe could keep an open mind. The following exchange took place:\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: But now that you have heard the way it\n     works here, can you see there might be other circumstances\n     --\n\n     [Sosa]: Oh, yeah.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: - - that might lead someone to vote for a\n     life sentence?\n\n     Is that what you’re telling us here today; that you can keep\n     an open mind to that?\n\n     [Sosa]:     Like I say, you don’t know what people been\n     through.     You can’t just judge one action by being simple\n     about it.    You know, everything comes to a climax. Like I\n     said, I’m   always open-minded. I don’t judge people. I don’t\n                                      130\n\f      have no preconceptions of people. I try not to let that get in\n      my way, because I don’t want to have any preconceived\n      notions about myself. So I try to be fair to everybody, of all\n      walks of life, throughout my life.\n\n      As far as, you know, you show me the evidence, I’ll use my\n      own free mind, my own free will, and I’ll make my own\n      decision.\n\n(RR46:29).     The foregoing proves that Sosa was not limited in his\n\nability to consider a life sentence.\n\n      Appellant has failed to show that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge for cause against Sosa. Issue 21\n\nshould be overruled.\n\n                          Issue 22: James Martin\n\n      Appellant challenged Martin for cause because (1) his responses\n\non his questionnaire; and, (2) he is biased as a result of the fact that his\n\ngrandson was killed.\n\n                               Questionnaire\n\n      Appellant challenged Martin “just based on his questionnaire.”\n\n(RR50:45).   Appellant did not identify the responses in the 22-page\n\nquestionnaire that he contends render him challengeable for cause. As\n\n\n\n\n                                       131\n\fsuch, this complaint is not preserved for review. See Tex. R. App. P.\n\n33.1(a).\n\n                              Martin’s Grandson\n\n      Appellant also challenged Martin “based on the fact that his\n\ngrandson was killed.”       (RR50:45).       Appellant asserted that Martin’s\n\ngrandson’s death would affect his ability to be a fair juror in Appellant’s\n\ncase. (RR50:45).\n\n      On Question 67 of his questionnaire, in response to a question\n\nasking whether he knew anyone who was killed accidentally or\n\notherwise, Martin wrote that “[his] grandson was shot a [sic] killed by a\n\nstray bullit [sic].” (Martin, Juror 1190, Q p.11). Martin testified that\n\nhis grandson’s case occurred in 2005.24 (RR50:43). His grandson’s case\n\nwas prosecuted by the Dallas County District Attorney’s Office, but it\n\nwould not cause him to be unfair in Appellant’s case.                 (RR50:38).\n\nIndeed, Martin denied that there was anything about his grandson’s\n\ncase that would keep him from being able to listen in Appellant’s case.\n\n(RR50:37-38). During the defense voir dire, Martin promised that his\n\n\n\n\n It is not clear whether the offense against Martin’s grandson occurred in 2005 or\n24\n\nwhether the perpetrator’s trial occurred in 2005. (RR50:43).\n                                       132\n\fgrandson’s case would not affect his ability to be a fair juror in\n\nAppellant’s case. (RR50:43).\n\n     The record supports the trial court’s ruling. Martin’s voir dire\n\ndoes not show a bias against Appellant or the law. The record shows\n\nthat he is in favor of the death penalty, but he testified that he would be\n\ncomfortable with assessing a life sentence in the proper circumstances.\n\n(RR50:39, 41).\n\n                            Claims on Appeal\n\n     On appeal, Appellant cites a number of other responses Martin\n\ngave in his questionnaire, which he contends show his bias.\n\n(Appellant’s Brief p.76). Appellant did not cite these responses during\n\nhis challenge for cause. As such, these complaints are not preserved for\n\nreview. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a).\n\n     Appellant has failed to show that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge for cause against Martin. Issue 22\n\nshould be overruled.\n\n                        Issue 23: Jennifer Wilder\n\n     Appellant challenged Wilder for cause because (1) she would\n\nincrease the burden on the defense regarding the intellectual disability\n\n\n                                    133\n\fspecial issue; (2) she would lower the burden on the State regarding the\n\nfuture danger special issue; and, (3) she would impose a burden on the\n\ndefense regarding the mitigation special issue.\n\n                         Intellectual Disability\n\n     Appellant challenged Wilder for cause because she would hold the\n\ndefense “to a burden of beyond a reasonable doubt on Special Issue\n\nNumber One.”      (RR52:85-86).     During the State’s voir dire, the\n\nprosecutor explained that with regard to the intellectual disability\n\nspecial issue, the burden of proof is on the defense to prove it by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence. (RR52:26-33). Wilder affirmed that she\n\ncould abide by the law with regard to this special issue. (RR52:29). She\n\ndenied that she would automatically answer the intellectual disability\n\nspecial issue in the negative simply because the offense at issue is\n\ncapital murder. (RR52:33).\n\n     When questioned by the defense, Wilder gave a response that\n\nsuggested that she would increase the burden of proof:\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: You know, sometimes people have told\n     us also . . . I want to be really sure they’re mentally\n     retarded. I don’t want to be sure, just more likely than not.\n     I want to be the most sure I can be, under the law.\n\n\n\n                                   134\n\f     “I want to be sure beyond a reasonable doubt. I don’t want\n     to have any doubt, for me to just say this person shouldn’t\n     receive the death penalty because they’re mentally\n     retarded.   I want to be convinced more than just a\n     preponderance. I have to be convinced beyond a reasonable\n     doubt.\n\n     “We’re holding the State to beyond-a-reasonable-doubt\n     standard. I want to hold the Defense to that burden also.”\n\n     What do you think?\n\n     [Wilder]: Yes. You’ve got to be fair. I notice you have\n     mentally retarded first, instead of last. It seems like\n     everybody do [sic] a crime, and then they want to say that\n     they are mentally retarded. You can even fool a doctor that\n     you’re mentally retarded. You just got to prove it beyond, as\n     you say, a reasonable doubt. And then you can see some\n     features in a mentally-challenged person also.\n\n(RR52:64-65).   It appears from this exchange that Wilder may have\n\nbeen confused and thought that beyond a reasonable doubt was the\n\nappropriate burden on this special issue.       Later in the exchange,\n\ndefense counsel returned to the subject and explained that the burden\n\non the defense is a preponderance of the evidence.         (RR52:66-67).\n\nWilder affirmed that she would be okay with the defense proving the\n\nintellectual disability special issue by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n(RR52:68).\n\n                                   135\n\f     To the extent that Wilder provided contradictory responses, the\n\nappellate court should defer to the trial judge. When the record reflects\n\nthat a venire member vacillated or equivocated on her ability to follow\n\nthe law, the reviewing court must defer to the trial judge. Gardner, 306\n\nS.W.3d at 295.\n\n                             Future Danger\n\n     Appellant challenged Wilder because she would only require the\n\nState to prove “just a mere chance or a possibility” that Appellant would\n\nbe a future danger.     (RR52:86).         During voir dire, the prosecutor\n\nexplained that the burden on the future danger special issue is on the\n\nState. (RR52:40-41). The State must prove that there is a probability –\n\nmore than a possibility, but less than a certainty – that Appellant\n\nwould be a future danger. (RR52:44-46). Wilder agreed that she would\n\nbe open to either possible answer and testified that “[a]nybody can be\n\nrehabilitated.” (RR52:46).\n\n     When questioned by the defense, Wilder again agreed that the\n\nState would have to prove a probability. (RR52:74). Then, however, as\n\nthe exchange continued, she gave a response that was equivocal.        The\n\nfollowing exchange took place:\n\n\n                                     136\n\f     [Defense Counsel]: So if the law says that you have to hold\n     the State to prove more than a mere chance and they have\n     to prove to you a probability, which is more, would you\n     agree?\n\n     [Wilder]: Yes.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: Could you follow that?\n\n     Or would a mere chance be enough for you?\n\n     Because, if that’s the way you feel, you can tell us. You can\n     say, “I can follow the law and say a probability is what I\n     would hold them to.” You tell me.\n\n     What would make you more comfortable?\n\n     [Wilder]: A mere chance. I think both sides would be a\n     chance. Proving it beyond a reasonable doubt and thinking\n     that this person is going to rehabilitate, even if they ever\n     get out of prison. I could go either way. You’ve got to prove\n     it. But then, nothing is 100 percent proven.\n\n(RR52:74).\n\n     To the extent that any of Wilder’s responses may be interpreted as\n\ncontradictory, this Court should defer to the trial court’s resolution of\n\nher responses.   See Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 744. The reviewing court\n\nmust give great deference to the trial court’s decision on a challenge for\n\ncause based on the trial judge’s opportunity to observe the venire\n\n                                   137\n\fmember during voir dire. Id. When the record reflects that a prospective\n\njuror vacillated or equivocated on her ability to follow the law, the\n\nreviewing court must defer to the trial judge. Gardner, 306 S.W.3d at\n\n295.\n\n                                  Mitigation\n\n       Appellant challenged Wilder because she would place a burden on\n\nthe defense regarding the mitigation special issue. (RR52:86).           At no\n\npoint, however, did Wilder ever say that she would place a burden on\n\nthe defense on this issue. Importantly, neither side instructed Wilder\n\nthat there is no burden as it relates to this issue.          See generally\n\nThreadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667.\n\n       Defense counsel asked Wilder about the fact that some people\n\nwould only answer the mitigation special issue in the affirmative if “the\n\nDefense proves it to [them].” (RR52:75). Wilder responded as follows:\n\n       You got the Defense over here, then you have the person\n       that’s defending the Defendant. You would want your\n       government to really bring everything that they would have\n       in order to prove the Defendant - - if they should receive life\n       or death. It’s just looking at the evidence.\n\n(RR52:76).    Wilder’s response suggests that she would consider the\n\nevidence presented, not that she would impose the burden of proof on\n\n                                     138\n\fthe defense. (RR52:76).       Even if her response can be interpreted as\n\nimposing a burden on the defense, which the State does not concede,\n\nthis Court has stated that a veniremember is not challengeable for\n\ncause simply because he would place the burden of proof on the defense\n\nregarding mitigation.       Saldano, 232 S.W.3d at 92 (citing Ladd, 3\n\nS.W.3d at 559).\n\n                             Claims on Appeal\n\n     On appeal, Appellant cites a number of other responses Wilder\n\ngave in her questionnaire, which he contends show her bias.\n\n(Appellant’s Brief p.78).    Appellant did not mention these responses\n\nduring his challenge for cause.      As such, these complaints are not\n\npreserved for review. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a).\n\n     Appellant has failed to show that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge for cause against Wilder. Issue 23\n\nshould be overruled.\n\n                                  Conclusion\n\n     Appellant has not shown even one erroneous ruling on his\n\nchallenges for cause, much less three erroneous rulings. See Gonzales,\n\n353 S.W.3d at 837. Therefore, he has not shown this Court that he was\n\n\n                                    139\n\fdenied the use of a statutorily provided peremptory strike.

He\n\ncontends the exclusion of these jurors violated article 35.16 of the Texas\n\nCode of Criminal Procedure. Appellant’s contentions lack merit and\n\nshould be overruled.\n\n                                 Applicable Law\n\n        Article 35.16(b) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides\n\nas follows:\n\n        A challenge for cause may be made by the State for any of\n        the following reasons:\n\n               1. That the juror has conscientious scruples in regard\n                  to the infliction of the punishment of death for\n                  crime, in a capital case, where the State is seeking\n                  the death penalty.\n\n               2. That he is related within the third degree of\n                  consanguinity or affinity as determined under\n\n                                       140\n\f              Chapter 573, Government Code, to the defendant;\n              and\n\n           3. That he has a bias or prejudice against any phase of\n              the law upon which the State is entitled to rely for\n              conviction or punishment.\n\nTex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.16(b) (West 2006). A “bias against\n\nthe law” is the refusal to consider or apply the relevant law.

Gonzales,\n\n353 S.W.3d at 831. The reviewing court gives great deference to the\n\ntrial court’s decision on a challenge for cause because the trial judge\n\nwas in the best position to observe the venire member during voir dire.\n\nId.   When the record reflects that a venire member vacillated or\n\nequivocated on her ability to follow the law, the reviewing court must\n\ndefer to the trial judge. Id.\n\n                         Issue 24: Sheryl Kingery\n\n      On her questionnaire, in response to Question 2, Kingery ranked\n                                    141\n\fherself a “5,” indicating a belief that she “could never, under any\n\ncircumstances, return a verdict which assessed the death penalty.”\n\n(RR13:22; Kingery, Juror 32, Q p.1). Kingery wrote that she could not\n\nbe a part of taking someone’s life.       (Kingery, Juror 32, Q p.1). She\n\nmade statements in multiple other places, which made her beliefs\n\nregarding the death penalty clear: she has moral, religious, or personal\n\nbeliefs that would prevent her from returning a verdict which would\n\nresult in the execution of another human being (Kingery, Juror 32, p.3);\n\n“(death sentence) provides no purpose” (Kingery, Juror 32, p.3); “I do\n\nnot believe in the death penalty” (Kingery, Juror 32, p.4); “I simply do\n\nnot believe in the death penalty” (Kingery, Juror 32, p.4); “[the death\n\npenalty] just never made any sense to me.         It seems contradictory.\n\nMurder is a crime but putting someone to death is not” (Kingery, Juror\n\n32, p.5); “I want to be sure to make it clear my stance against the death\n\npenalty and it would be an influence on my thoughts” (Kingery, Juror\n\n32, p.20).\n\n      During voir dire by the State, when asked if she was saying, “I\n\ncan’t be part of [this process], because of my beliefs[,]” Kingery testified\n\nthat the prosecutor was correct. (RR13:23).       Kingery testified that if\n\n\n                                    142\n\fshe were a juror, she “would have to answer [the special issues]\n\ntruthfully[,]” but later, she conceded the possibility that she would be\n\nlooking for a way to answer the questions in such a way that the death\n\npenalty would not result. (RR13:25). Serving as a juror in this case\n\nwould do harm to her conscience. (RR13:25-26).      Kingery repeatedly\n\naffirmed that she does not believe in the death penalty and believes\n\nthat it should be abolished. (RR13:28-29).\n\n     When questioned by the defense, Kingery testified that if she were\n\nselected as a juror, she would show up. (RR13:44). She intimated,\n\nhowever, that her participation would be less than honest.          The\n\nfollowing exchange took place:\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: If you’re selected as a juror, would you\n     just refuse to participate at all in the process?\n\n     [Kingery]: No, I would not refuse to participate. But I know\n     how I would participate.\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: Okay. That’s what we’re going to talk\n     about.\n\n     Would you do it honestly?\n\n     I mean, you’ve indicated, when they were asking you\n     questions, that you would participate honestly in the\n     process.\n\n                                  143\n\f      [Kingery]: As honestly as I can. I know I have this strong\n      belief.\n\n(RR13:44).    Later, counsel asked Kingery whether she could honestly\n\nanswer “no” to the mitigation special issue if she did not find any\n\nmitigating evidence.    (RR13:55). Kingery testified that “it would kill\n\n[her].”   (RR13:55).    As the exchange continued, however, she gave\n\nanswers that suggested that her participation would be less than\n\ncompletely honest:\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: But would you be honest and do it?\n\n      [Kingery]: I would have to. Because, one way or the other,\n      my conscience is going to - -\n\n      [Defense Counsel]:     So you would have to answer it\n      honestly.\n\n      [Kingery]: Yes.\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: Even if your answer’s “no” you would be\n      honest and answer “no” that there’s no mitigation, right?\n\n      Even if it would be hard - - extremely hard - - for you, you\n      could do it?\n\n      [Kingery]: Put in that situation, can I absolutely, honestly\n      answer that today?\n\n\n                                   144\n\f     [Defense Counsel]: No. We don’t know what you’re going to\n     hear.\n\n     [Kingery]: I would hope I would do it. But I still can’t say,\n     when it came down to that wire. I can only hope that I will\n     do it.\n\n(RR13:55-56). Kingery then contradicted herself and testified that she\n\n“[could] answer the questions honestly.” (RR13:57).\n\n     A veniremember may not be excused for her general opposition to\n\nthe death penalty.

A\n\nveniremember is challengeable for cause, however, if his beliefs\n\nagainst capital punishment would prevent or substantially impair the\n\nperformance of his duties as a juror in accordance with the court's\n\ninstructions and the juror's oath. See Colburn, 966 S.W.2d at 517.     A\n\njuror must be able to set aside her personal preferences and biases to\n\nconsider as death eligible all those defined as death eligible by section\n\n19.03 of the penal code and article 37.071 of the criminal procedure\n\ncode. Rachal, 917 S.W.2d at 812.\n\n     The totality of Kingery’s voir dire testimony shows that her beliefs\n\nabout capital punishment would prevent or substantially impair the\n\n\n                                   145\n\fperformance of her duties as a juror as required by law. She had a bias\n\nagainst the law governing a defendant’s eligibility for the death penalty.\n\nAs a result of her bias, Kingery could not ensure the parties that she\n\nwould follow the law and answer the special issues honestly.

Indeed, she testified that she could not take the oath\n\nbecause of her beliefs about the death penalty. (RR13:218-19). The\n\nfollowing exchange took place:\n\n     [Prosecutor]: Your moral beliefs, they’re yours . . . What I’m\n     hearing you say, when you tell me it might be hard to\n     return a verdict that would result in the execution of\n     somebody else, tells me that you might have some moral\n     dilemma with actually being on a jury that actually imposed\n     a verdict that resulted in the execution of somebody else.\n\n     [Morris]: Yes.\n\n     [Prosecutor]: Is that how you feel?\n\n     [Morris]: That’s how I feel.\n\n     [Prosecutor]: Okay. What I’m saying is that you would\n     have to take an oath to follow the law, even if the law\n     conflicted with your own moral standard.\n\n     Some jurors have told me, “I can’t take that oath, because I\n     don’t want to be in a position of making a determination\n     that, while in line with the law, is not in line with my own\n     morals.”\n\n     Does that make sense?\n\n\n\n                                    147\n\f     [Morris]: Yes.\n\n     [Prosecutor]: Some people have a moral opposition to\n     imposing the death penalty, by their verdict. Okay? And\n     what I’m hearing you tell me is that you could not take that\n     oath.\n\n     Is that right?\n\n     [Morris]: Correct.\n\n     [Prosecutor]: You couldn’t assure me that you would take\n     the oath and follow it all the way through because of your\n     moral dilemmas with the death penalty, correct?\n\n     [Morris]: Correct.\n\n(RR13:217-19).    Later, the prosecutor returned to the subject and\n\nMorris maintained her position, stating, “No. I couldn’t assure you that\n\n[she would take the oath to follow the law].” (RR13:239).\n\n     During voir dire by the defense, however, Morris contradicted\n\nherself.   She testified that she would answer all of the special issues\n\nhonestly. (RR13:249-50, 254-55, 259). She testified that she would take\n\nthe oath if she had to. (RR13:260).         In an effort to clarify Morris’\n\nposition, the trial judge inquired of her as follows:\n\n     [Trial Court]: . . . Now, one side, you’re saying, no, you\n     can’t. The other side, you’re saying, yes, you can.\n\n                                     148\n\f     I need to know “yes” or “no” can you take the oath?\n\n     [Morris]: No.\n\n(RR13:264).\n\n     Given Morris’ repeated statements that she could not take the\n\noath, the trial court properly granted the State’s challenge for cause. A\n\nveniremember is challengeable for cause if she states that her\n\nconvictions are so strong that she cannot take an oath, knowing that a\n\ndeath sentence is a possible result at trial.

She wrote in 3 places that she did not think that she could “send\n\nsomeone to [the] death penalty.” (Davila, Juror 103, Q pp.3, 4, 20).\n\n     She also answered “yes” to Questions 3 and 4, which ask whether\n\nthe juror has any moral, religious or personal beliefs that would prevent\n\nthem from sitting in judgment of another human being or would\n\nprevent them from returning a verdict that would result in the\n\nexecution of another human being. (Davila, Juror 103, Q p.3).\n\n     During questioning by the State, Davila affirmed the answers on\n\nher questionnaire.    (RR14:133-36).      She agreed that her beliefs\n\nregarding the death penalty would affect her ability to answer the\n\nspecial issues. (RR14:154). The following exchange took place:\n\n     [Prosecutor]: Okay. So your views then on the death\n     penalty will impact how you consider whether somebody is\n     mentally retarded or not; is that right?\n\n     [Davila]: Yes.\n\n     [Prosecutor]: Okay. In other words, you would change or\n     consider Special Issue Number One really not in the context\n     of whether the person suffers from mental retardation, but\n     whether you want him to get the death penalty or not; is\n     that right?\n\n     [Davila]: Yes.\n\n\n                                   150\n\f(RR14:154).   The prosecutor asked Davila whether her feelings would\n\naffect her answer to the deliberateness special issue, “knowing that if\n\nyou answer it ‘yes’ you’re moving closer toward that verdict of death?”\n\n(RR14:159). Davila responded, “I think it would. But I still can’t send\n\nno one to death penalty.”      (RR14:159).   Her views would affect her\n\nanswers to the future danger and the mitigation special issues as well.\n\n(RR14:159-60, 167). Because of her moral beliefs, she is unable to be a\n\npart of the process involved in this case. (RR14:169). When Davila was\n\nquestioned by the defense, she appeared to contradict herself because\n\nshe agreed that she could answer the special issues. (RR14:178-87). At\n\nthe end of questioning, however, she testified that she could not take\n\nthe oath to serve as a juror. (RR14:187-88). The following exchange\n\ntook place:\n\n     [Defense Counsel]: . . . So now that you know how it works,\n     do you think you could take the oath to serve as a juror and\n     be part of the process, as long as all you’re asked to do is\n     answer the questions honestly and base your answers on\n     the evidence?\n\n     Do you think you could do that?\n\n     [Davila]: Honestly, no.\n\n(RR14:187-88).\n                                    151\n\f     Given Davila’s testimony that her beliefs would affect her answers\n\nto the special issues and that she could not take the oath, the trial court\n\nproperly granted the State’s challenge for cause.      See Goodwin, 799\n\nS.W.2d at 731-32. The record supports the trial court’s decision to grant\n\nthe State’s challenge. See King, 29 S.W.3d at 568.           To conclude\n\notherwise would controvert this Court’s policy as stated earlier. Jones,\n\n982 S.W.2d at 394.\n\n     Issue 26 should be overruled.\n\n                        Issue 27: Gloria Hawkins\n\n     In response to Question 1 on her questionnaire, Hawkins wrote\n\nthat she is not in favor of the death penalty.   (Hawkins, Juror 176, Q\n\np.1). During questioning by the State, Hawkins affirmed the statements\n\nin her questionnaire that she does not believe in the death penalty.\n\n(RR15:216). She testified, “No, I wouldn’t be part of a process where\n\nsomeone is executed. I will not be.” (RR15:215). Importantly, Hawkins\n\nrefused to provide any assurance that if she were selected as a juror\n\nthat she would take the oath and follow the law. (RR15:219-21). The\n\nfollowing exchange occurred:\n\n     [Hawkins]: I said, I’m against the death penalty.          Yes,\n     that’s what I wrote. That’s what I mean.\n\n                                     152\n\f[Prosecutor]: Can you take the oath to follow the law and\nrender a true verdict?\n\n[Hawkins]: What do you think?\n\n[Prosecutor]: I think you can. What do you think?\n\n[Hawkins]: I’m not gone [sic] give the death penalty.\n\n[Prosecutor]: Because of how you feel, you’re not going to\ngive the death penalty?\n\n[Hawkins]: And may not even want to give a life penalty.\nBut go ahead.\n\n...\n\n[Prosecutor]: And even if you [heard the evidence], you\ncouldn’t impose the death penalty in any case.\n\nIs that what you’re telling me?\n\n[Hawkins]: If I heard witnesses. No, I will not impose the\ndeath penalty. That is too final. And people change.\n\n...\n\n[Prosecutor]: Are you able to give me your assurance right\nnow that you can take the oath to follow the law and render\na true verdict, based on the law and the evidence?\n\n[Hawkins]: That I could follow the law?\n\n                             153\n\f     [Prosecutor]: And render - -\n\n     [Hawkins]: I’m not a part of that. I don’t have to follow\n     that. No, I don’t have to follow that. I’m not a part of your\n     law.\n\n(RR15:219-21).      In contrast, when she was questioned by the defense,\n\nHawkins testified that she could answer the special issues honestly.\n\n(RR15:227-28). She testified that she could follow the law. (RR15:230-\n\n31, 234-35, 239).\n\n     The totality of Hawkins’ voir dire testimony shows that her beliefs\n\nabout capital punishment would prevent or substantially impair the\n\nperformance of her duties as a juror as required by law. To the extent,\n\nif any, that some of her other remarks could be interpreted as\n\ncontradictory, the trial court was the fact finder during voir dire and,\n\nthus, free to resolve her conflicting answers in the State’s favor. See\n\nKing, 29 S.W.3d at 568 (particular deference is given to the trial court’s\n\nconclusion that venire member cannot follow law when venire member’s\n\nanswers are vacillating, unclear, or contradictory).        To conclude\n\notherwise would controvert this Court’s policy as stated earlier. Jones,\n\n982 S.W.2d at 394.\n\n\n                                    154\n\f                                 Judgment\n\n      On Question 4 of her questionnaire, Hawkins answered “yes” to a\n\nquestion asking whether she has “any moral, religious or personal\n\nbeliefs that would prevent [her] from returning a verdict which would\n\nresult in the execution of another human being.” (Hawkins, Juror 176,\n\nQ p.2). During voir dire, she testified, “I don’t believe I have a right to,\n\nyou know, judge anybody, to say that they should die for what they did.”\n\n(RR15:184). The totality of Hawkins’ voir dire shows she could not sit\n\nin judgment of another individual and her statements support the trial\n\ncourt’s decision.\n\n                                      Guilt\n\n      When Hawkins was told that the Judge would instruct her that\n\nAppellant has already been found guilty, Hawkins testified, “Well, I\n\ndidn’t see the trial. It’s hearsay to me.” (RR15:190).      The prosecutor\n\nexplained     that   another   jury    already   found   Appellant   guilty.\n\n(RR15:190).     Hawkins testified that she would “have to see it for\n\n[her]self[.]” (RR15:190). As above, Hawkins’ testimony shows that she\n\nwas unable (or unwilling) to follow the law. The record supports the\n\ntrial court’s decision.\n\n\n                                       155\n\f                           Fifth Amendment\n\n     On Question 36A of her questionnaire, Hawkins wrote that she\n\nagreed with the statement, “Even though the law says a Defendant has\n\nthe right to remain silent, a person accused of capital murder should\n\ntestify.” (Hawkins, Juror 176, Q p.7). During voir dire, the prosecutor\n\nexplained that jurors are not allowed to consider the fact that a\n\ndefendant does or does not testify in his own defense as evidence of\n\nguilt. (RR15:195).    Hawkins testified that she “[doesn’t] follow that\n\nlaw.” (RR15:195). In contrast, she later contradicted herself when she\n\ntestified that she would follow an instruction not to consider whether\n\nthe defendant elects to testify as evidence of guilt. (RR15:196). To the\n\nextent that Hawkins was a vacillating juror, the record supports the\n\ntrial court’s decision. See King, 29 S.W.3d at 568.\n\n                             Future Danger\n\n     Hawkins testified that she could not find a person to be a future\n\ndanger unless she talks to that person or if that person testifies and she\n\nhears what that person has to say. (RR15:209). She could not answer\n\nthe future danger special issue unless the defendant testifies.\n\n(RR15:210). Even so, “[y]ou can’t tell a person’s heart. You don’t know\n\n\n                                   156\n\fwhat he’s going to do or what he’s not going to do in the future. You\n\ncan’t do it. You can only predict.” (RR15:211).    As a result, she could\n\nnever answer the future danger special issue.      (RR15:211, 212). She\n\ntestified:\n\n      I can’t do that. Because I can’t look at a person’s heart and\n      tell what they’re going to do. I can’t do that. And you can’t\n      either.\n\n(RR15:211-12).   In contrast, she later contradicted herself when she\n\ntestified that she could answer the the future danger special issue “yes.”\n\n(RR15:235-36). To the extent that Hawkins was a vacillating juror, the\n\nrecord supports the trial court’s decision. See King, 29 S.W.3d at 568.\n\n      The record supports the trial court’s decision to grant the State’s\n\nchallenge. To conclude otherwise would controvert this Court’s policy\n\nas stated earlier. Jones, 982 S.W.2d at 394.\n\n      Issue 27 should be overruled.\n\n                         Issue 28: Jenna Kinzie\n\n      On Question 1 of her questionnaire, Kinzie wrote that she is “not\n\nsure what [she] think[s] about the death penalty but [she does] not\n\nthink it should be [her] decision whether someone lives or dies.”\n\n(Kinzie, Juror 243, Q p.2). She ranked herself a “3” on Question 2,\n\n                                      157\n\findicating a belief that, “Although I do not believe that the death\n\npenalty should ever be imposed, as long as the law provides for it, I\n\ncould assess it under the proper set of circumstances.” (Kinzie, Juror\n\n243, Q p.2).   During the State’s voir dire, she described herself as\n\n“teeter-tottery” about the subject. (RR17:114). When the prosecutor\n\nasked if taking the oath would violate her conscience, Kinzie said it\n\nwould. (RR17:125).     Kinzie testified that she thought that she could\n\ntake the oath; however, her views on the death penalty would affect her\n\nanswers to the special issues. (RR17:128-29). During questioning by\n\nthe defense, however, Kinzie agreed that she could take the oath and\n\nrender a verdict based on the law and evidence. (RR17:139, 142, 158).\n\n     After she was questioned by both sides, the trial court brought\n\nKinzie back into the courtroom and asked whether she could “take the\n\noath or not[.]” Kinzie testified that she could not. (RR17:170-71). To\n\nthe extent that Kinzie was a vacillating juror, the record supports the\n\ntrial court’s decision. See King, 29 S.W.3d at 568.\n\n                           Fifth Amendment\n\n     On Question 36A of her questionnaire, Kinzie wrote that she\n\nagreed with the statement, “Even though the law says a Defendant has\n\n\n                                   158\n\fthe right to remain silent, a person accused of capital murder should\n\ntestify.” (Kinzie, Juror 243, Q p.7). During the State’s voir dire, she\n\ntestified that she would prefer that a capital murder defendant testify.\n\n(RR17:133). She was unsure whether she would require the defendant’s\n\ntestimony. (RR17:133).      She would consider it, however, in deciding\n\nthe special issues.    (RR17:135).     When questioned by the defense,\n\nKinzie agreed that she would not consider the defendant’s failure to\n\ntestify. (RR17:157). To the extent that Kinzie was a vacillating juror,\n\nthe record supports the trial court’s decision. See King, 29 S.W.3d at\n\n568.\n\n                              Police Officers\n\n       One of Kinzie’s brothers is a police officer. (RR17:129, 154). As a\n\nresult, even though the law says that police officers are to be judged as\n\nany other witness, Kinzie would find them to be more credible.\n\n(RR17:130-31).    She later contradicted herself and agreed that she\n\nwould wait and listen to their testimony before judging their credibility.\n\n(RR17:155-56).\n\n       The totality of Kinzie’s voir dire testimony clearly shows her\n\nbeliefs about capital punishment and sitting in judgment of another\n\n\n                                     159\n\fperson would prevent or substantially impair her ability to carry out\n\nher obligations as a juror.     And, she vacillated on multiple issues.\n\nIndeed, Kinzie was the classic vacillating juror; she gave different\n\nanswers depending on who was questioning her.            Where the venire\n\nmember either vacillates or equivocates on his ability to follow the law,\n\nthe Court should defer to the trial court’s judgment on the challenge for\n\ncause.    Granados, 85 S.W.3d at 231.         The record supports the trial\n\ncourt’s decision to grant the State’s challenge. To conclude otherwise\n\nwould controvert this Court’s policy as stated earlier.         Jones, 982\n\nS.W.2d at 394.\n\n        Issue 28 should be overruled.\n\n                           Issue 29: Raul Flores\n\n        On his questionnaire, Flores wrote that he is not in favor of the\n\ndeath penalty and described it as “barbaric.” (Flores, Juror 244, Q p.2,\n\np.5).    On Question 4, he answered “yes” to a question asking whether\n\nhe has “any moral, religious or personal beliefs that would prevent\n\n[him] from returning a verdict which would result in the execution of\n\nanother human being.” (Flores, Juror 244, Q p.3). He wrote that he\n\nwas “very unsure that [he] could send a person to their death.” (Flores,\n\n\n                                        160\n\fJuror 244, Q p.3).       On Question 19, Flores answered “no,” that the\n\ndeath penalty is not applied fairly in Texas. (Flores, Juror 244, Q p.4).\n\nOn Question 22, Flores wrote that the death penalty is used too often\n\nand that “it’s used as a political tool to gain votes from people thirsty for\n\npunishment, rather than what benefits society.” (Flores, Juror 244, Q\n\np.4).    He answered “agree” to Question 36C, which asked whether the\n\ndeath penalty should be abolished. (Flores, Juror 244, Q p.7).\n\n        During questioning by the State, Flores’ testimony revealed\n\nconsiderable distrust in the prosecution. The following exchange took\n\nplace:\n\n        [Flores]: Everybody has their agenda. Everybody wants\n        something. It just seems that with the prosecutor, lately,\n        I’ve been hearing about wins and losses. And that’s all that\n        matters. This morning, I heard about a receipt was [sic]\n        withheld, evidence was withheld, and the guy went to\n        prison for 25 years.\n\n        [Prosecutor]: Yep.\n\n        [Flores]: That happened, because a prosecutor wanted to\n        win. I’m suppose to believe what you tell me - -\n\n        [Prosecutor]: Actually, you don’t have to.\n\n        [Flores]: Well, I’m not too succinct [sic] right now.\n\n\n                                      161\n\f     ...\n\n     [Flores]: So you just told me that, okay, we’re here because\n     this happened and this happened and this happened. And\n     I’m supposed to believe you?\n\n     [Prosecutor]: In one sense, yes. In another sense, you don’t\n     have to necessarily agree with it.\n\n     Does that make sense to you?\n\n     [Flores]: You’re telling me these things, and we’re going to\n     proceed onward, as if I believe you. And that’s - -\n\n     [Prosecutor]: That’s a problem for you?\n\n     [Flores]: (Venireperson nods.)\n\n     [Prosecutor]: That’s all right. I can tell.\n\n(RR18:21-23).    The prosecutor asked Flores whether his personal\n\nexperiences and “things that [he has] read about” meant that the State\n\nwas “already behind in this case.” (RR18:39). Flores responded that\n\n“That’s accurate.” (RR18:39).\n\n     Flores openly admitted that he is biased.     He testified, “I’m very\n\nbiased.” (RR18:33).    He testified that his “biases will factor into how\n\n[he] act[s].” (RR18:34).   At one point, Flores testified that he thought\n\nthat he could look at evidence objectively. (RR18:40).      But then he\n\n                                    162\n\freturned to his initial stance. The following exchange took place:\n\n     [Prosecutor]: . . . In other words, you could not be a part of\n     this process that would result in the execution because of\n     how you feel; is that right? “Yes” or “no”?\n\n     [Flores]: No, I couldn’t.\n\n     [Prosecutor]: Okay. All right.\n\n     [Flores]: I’d be fine disregarding the instructions, you know.\n\n     [Prosecutor]:     You   would    be   fine   disregarding   the\n     instructions?\n\n     [Flores]: If the alternative is sending someone to die.\n\n(RR18:40-41).\n\n     Later, when he was questioned by the defense, Flores equivocated\n\nregarding his ability to serve as a juror and answer the special issues\n\nbased on the law and evidence. (RR18:66-67).         Counsel tried to pin\n\nFlores down, but Flores testified that the best answer he was able to\n\ngive was “I don’t know.”\n\n     The totality of Flores’ voir dire testimony clearly shows that his\n\nbeliefs about capital punishment and his clear bias against the State\n\nwould prevent or substantially impair his ability to carry out his oath\n\nand follow instructions in accordance with the law.       Threadgill, 146\n                                   163\n\fS.W.3d at 667. Flores was equivocal about his ability to take the oath.\n\nEven if he did take the oath, however, by his testimony, he would “be\n\nfine disregarding [the court’s] instructions[.]”     (RR18:41). The record\n\nsupports the trial court’s decision.\n\n     Issue 29 should be overruled.\n\n                            Issue 30: Kellye Hogan\n\n     In her questionnaire, Hogan wrote that she is in favor of the death\n\npenalty in the appropriate case, but she is “hesitant to make a decision\n\nfor someone else’s fate.”     (Hogan, Juror 1110, Q p.2, 20). During voir\n\ndire, after hearing the prosecutor summarize the process involved,\n\nHogan testified that she did not feel like she could be a part of the\n\nprocess. (RR47:69). She testified, “I don’t feel like I can handle making\n\nthat type of decision, based on an individual.”        (RR47:69).   Hogan\n\nacknowledged that her testimony differed from the answers in her\n\nquestionnaire; she said that she has “had time to think about it[.]”\n\n(RR47:70).    Initially, Hogan agreed that the death penalty “would be\n\nplaying on [her] mind” as she answered the special issues. (RR47:74).\n\nBut then she testified that if she were a juror that she “would obviously\n\ntell the truth” and that her views on the death penalty would not affect\n\n\n                                       164\n\fher answers to the special issues. (RR47:75-76).      Where the venire\n\nmember either vacillates or equivocates on her ability to follow the law,\n\nthe Court should defer to the trial court’s judgment on the challenge for\n\ncause.   Granados, 85 S.W.3d at 231.     The record supports the trial\n\ncourt’s decision to grant the State’s challenge. To conclude otherwise\n\nwould controvert this Court’s policy as stated earlier.      Jones, 982\n\nS.W.2d at 394.\n\n                            Burden of Proof\n\n     Hogan also testified that she would hold the State to a higher\n\nburden of proof than beyond a reasonable doubt.        (RR47:99).    The\n\nprosecutor explained that although the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt\n\nstandard is the highest burden in the criminal justice system, it “does\n\nnot mean with 100 percent certainty or beyond all possible doubt.”\n\n(RR47:99). When asked if she would hold the State to its burden of\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt or whether she would hold it to a higher\n\nburden, Hogan testified that “it would have to be a higher burden than\n\nreasonable doubt - - beyond a reasonable doubt.”       (RR47:99).    The\n\nprosecutor explained that the law only requires the State to prove\n\nsomething beyond a reasonable doubt but Hogan maintained that she\n\n\n                                   165\n\fwould hold the State to a higher burden. (RR47:100-01). The following\n\nexchange took place:\n\n     [Prosecutor]: The law is, you would be instructed that I’m\n     only suppose to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, if I can\n     prove it at all. Even if you were convinced beyond a\n     reasonable doubt about something, about Special Issue\n     Number Two, Special Issue Number Three, you would still\n     hold me to that higher burden, because of your thoughts on\n     capital murder; is that correct?\n\n     [Hogan]: That’s correct.\n\n     [Prosecutor]:     You would hold me to beyond all possible\n     doubt?\n\n     [Hogan]: Yes.\n\n(RR47:101). When she was questioned by the defense, Hogan appeared\n\nto change her answer. (RR47:112-14). She agreed that she would not\n\nhold the State to an impossible burden, but would hold the State to its\n\nburden of beyond a reasonable doubt. (RR47:114).      In an attempt to\n\nclear up the confusion, the trial court inquired of Hogan regarding the\n\nburden of proof:\n\n     [Trial Court]: . . . All right. I’m confused now, Ms. Hogan.\n     And I want you to tell me. Because, when Mr. Birmingham\n     was talking to you . . . you told him that you would hold him\n     to a higher burden of proof. Mr. Sanchez has been over this\n\n                                   166\n\f     with you.\n\n     You understand, the law is beyond a reasonable doubt?\n     That’s the burden of proof that the State has to prove.\n     Beyond a reasonable doubt can mean anything to you. We\n     don’t have a legal definition of it. It means whatever it\n     means to you, each juror. But that is the burden of proof.\n     It’s not beyond all doubt. It’s not beyond a shadow of a\n     doubt. It’s not beyond - - it’s not 100 percent. It’s not to a\n     certainty. It’s beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n     Now, would you hold the State to that burden?\n\n     Or would you hold them to a higher burden?\n\n     Just be real truthful and honest with us.\n\n     [Hogan]: Okay. Well, that’s what I thought I answered,\n     was it would be a higher - - it would be a higher burden.\n\n     [Trial Court]: A higher burden than beyond a reasonable\n     doubt?\n\n     [Hogan]: Yes.\n\n(RR47:115).   A review of Hogan’s testimony shows that she has a bias\n\nagainst the law regarding the State’s burden of proof.   Her bias would\n\nprevent or substantially impair her ability to carry out her oath and\n\ninstructions in accordance with the law. Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667.\n\nAt a minimum, Hogan was a vacillating juror. See generally Ladd, 3\n\n                                   167\n\fS.W.3d at 559. The record supports the trial court’s decision.\n\n     Issue 30 should be overruled.\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n     The trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the State’s\n\nchallenges for cause regarding Kingery, Morris, Davila, Hawkins,\n\nKinzie, Flores, and Hogan. Even assuming their excusal was erroneous,\n\nit was harmless. The erroneous excusal of a venireperson warrants\n\nreversal only if the record shows that the error deprived the defendant\n\nof a lawfully constituted jury. Jones, 982 S.W.2d at 394. Appellant\n\nmakes no such showing.       Moreover, no evidence indicates that the\n\njurors who served on Appellant’s jury were in any way biased,\n\ninterested, or otherwise disqualified from serving. As a result, reversal\n\nis unwarranted.\n\n     Issues 24 through 30 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S   RESPONSE TO ISSUE    31:   THE SUPREME COURT’S DECISION IN\nHALL V.

Appellant’s contention lack merit.\n\n                             Pertinent Facts\n\n     On June 3, 2014, Appellant filed a motion to quash the jury panel\n\nbased on the United States Supreme Court opinion in Hall. (CR:23-24).\n\nDefense counsel argued that under Hall, it is unconstitutional to\n\ninstruct the potential jurors that an IQ of “70 or below” as “it’s actually\n\na moving scale now, depending on the evidence from an expert.”\n\n(RR47:7).    Counsel argued that “by application and by statutory\n\nstatement through the Brisenio [sic] case, we feel that there’s an\n\nunconstitutionality there.”      (RR47:7).     The trial court overruled\n\nAppellant’s objection to the State being permitted to instruct the\n\npotential jurors that the first prong of the test for intellectual disability\n\nrequires an IQ of 70 or below. (RR47:11-12).\n\n     On June 13, 2014, the trial court conducted a second hearing on\n\nAppellant’s motion. At that time, Appellant argued that “Briseno no\n\nlonger applies” after Hall. (RR53:15). The defense maintained its June\n\n3rd argument that the jury had been improperly questioned on the\n\nmatter during voir dire.       (RR53:16-17).      The trial court denied\n\nAppellant’s motion to quash the panel. (RR56:4).\n\n\n                                     169\n\f                            Applicable Law\n\n                                  Atkins\n\n     In Atkins v.

A fundamental premise of\n\nAtkins is that the clinical definition of intellectual disability takes into\n\naccount “that IQ scores represent a range, not a fixed number[.]” Hall,\n\n134 S.

Florida\n\n      In Hall, the United States Supreme Court held that Florida’s\n\ninterpretation of its intellectual disability statute was unconstitutional.\n\n134 S. Ct. at 2000.     Freddie Hall filed a motion claiming that he was\n\nintellectually disabled and could not be executed. Id. at 1991-92. He\n\npresented in IQ score of 71.25 Id. at 1992. Florida argued that Hall was\n\nnot allowed to present any additional evidence of his intellectual\n\ndisability because he had failed as a threshold matter to present\n\nevidence of an IQ score of 70 or below.          Id.     The Florida court’s\n\ninterpretation of the strict 70 cutoff did not permit consideration of the\n\nSEM. Because Hall failed to meet the strict cutoff, he was not allowed\n\nto present evidence of adaptive deficits. See id.\n\n\n25Hall presented multiple IQ scores, but some were excluded, leaving only scores\nbetween 71 and 80. Id.\n                                      172\n\f     The United States Supreme Court noted that, on its face, there\n\nwas nothing in the Florida statute to preclude consideration of the\n\nstandard error of measurement. Hall, 134 S.Ct. at 1994. The problem\n\nwas that the Florida Supreme Court had interpreted the provisions of\n\nthe intellectual disability statute too narrowly:\n\n     It has held that a person whose test score is above 70,\n     including a score within the margin for measurement error,\n     does not have an intellectual disability and is barred from\n     presenting other evidence that would show his faculties are\n     limited.\n\nId. at 1994 (citing Cherry v.

This interpretation contradicts established medical\n\npractice because it uses an IQ score as “final and conclusive evidence of\n\na defendant’s intellectual capacity” even though an IQ score is “on its\n\nown terms, imprecise” and because experts in the field would still\n\nconsider other evidence.

In\n\nMoore, this Court reiterated that, in the absence of action by the\n\nLegislature, Texas would “continue to follow the AAMR’s 1992\n\ndefinition of intellectual disability . . . adopted in Briseno for Atkins\n\nclaims presented in Texas death-penalty claims.” Id. at 486 (citing In\n\nre Allen, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 52 (Tex.

Citing Hall, this\n\nCourt stated that “the legal test we established in Briseno remains\n\nadequately      ‘informed   by   the    medical   community’s     diagnostic\n\nframework.’” Id. at 487 (citing Hall, 134 S.Ct. at 2000).\n\n                                 Analysis\n\n     Appellant’s      contention       that   Briseno    was       rendered\n\nunconstitutional after Hall lacks merit. Hall stands for the proposition\n\nthat states cannot implement bright line IQ cutoff scores when\n\nconsidering a capital defendant’s claim of intellectual disability.      134\n\nS. Ct. at 2001. Briseno does not call for the use of a bright-line IQ\n\ncutoff score.    Appellant cites no Texas cases implementing a bright-\n\n\n                                       174\n\fline IQ cutoff score. Indeed, in Moore, this Court stated:\n\n     Regarding Briseno’s first prong, general intellectual\n     functioning is defined by the IQ and obtained by assessment\n     with a standardized, individually administered intelligence\n     test. There is a measurement error of approximately five\n     points in assessing IQ, which may vary from instrument to\n     instrument. Therefore, when determining whether an\n     applicant has met Briseno’s first prong, we consider the fact\n     that any IQ score could actually represent a score that is\n     five points higher or five points lower than the score than he\n     actually obtained.\n\nMoore, 470 S.W. 3d at 487 (internal quotations and citations omitted);\n\nsee also Ex parte Hearn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1370729\"><a href=\"/opinion/1370729/ex-parte-hearn/\"><span class=\"volume\">310</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 428 (Tex.

Notably, the Hall Court did not identify Texas as a\n\nstate that, like Florida, employs a bright-line IQ cutoff score. Because\n\nthe definition of intellectual disability announced in Briseno does not\n\npreclude consideration of the SEM, it is not unconstitutional under\n\n                                   175\n\fHall.\n\n        In his brief, Appellant invites this Court to reconsider Briseno in\n\nlight of Hall. He cites Judge Price’s concurring opinion in Cathey and\n\nJudge Alcala’s dissent26 in Ex parte Lizcano, in support of his\n\ncontention that Briseno is un-scientific and unconstitutional.            See\n\nCathey, 451 S.W.3d at 28 (Price, J., concurring); Ex parte Lizcano, No.\n\nWR-68,348-03, 2015 Tex. Crim. App. Unpub. LEXIS 331, at *2 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. Apr. 15, 2015) (Alcala, J., dissenting) (not designated for\n\npublication). Neither opinion advances Appellant’s argument.           In his\n\nbrief opinion in Cathey, Judge Price criticized Briseno, however, his\n\ndisagreement was “with the Court’s decidedly non-diagnostic approach\n\nto evaluating the adaptive deficits prong[,]” not the subaverage-IQ\n\nprong. Cathey, 451 S.W.3d at 28.       In Lizcano, Judge Alcala criticized\n\nBriseno, but, like Judge Price, her criticism concerned the factors used\n\nto determine the adaptive functioning prong, not the subaverage-IQ\n\nprong. Lizcano, 2015 Tex. Crim. App. Unpub. LEXIS at *5-6.                 As\n\nargued above, Hall concerns the subaverage-IQ prong, not the adaptive\n\nfunctioning prong.\n26 In fact, Appellant refers to “Judge Newell’s dissenting opinion” in Lizcano.\nAlthough Judge Newell did dissent, it was Judge Alcala who filed the dissenting\nopinion.\n                                      176\n\f     On appeal, Appellant also complains that Briseno requires a\n\ndefendant to prove that his deficits in adaptive functioning are the\n\nresult of an intellectual disability and not a personality disorder.\n\n(Appellant’s Brief pp.90-98). This argument is procedurally barred as\n\nAppellant failed to raise it in the trial court.   See Tex. R. App. P.\n\n33.1(a).\n\n     Regardless, Appellant’s complaint lacks merit. Briseno does not\n\nrequire a defendant to prove that his adaptive deficits are not the\n\nresult of a personality disorder.    The complained-of language from\n\nBriseno provides as follows:\n\n     The adaptive behavior criteria are exceedingly subjective,\n     and undoubtedly experts will be found to offer opinions on\n     both sides of the issue in most cases. There are, however,\n     some other evidentiary factors which factfinders in the\n     criminal trial context might also focus upon in weighing\n     evidence as indicative of mental retardation or of a\n     personality disorder.\n\nBriseno, 135 S.W.3d at 8 (emphasis added).           The above-quoted\n\nlanguage does not impose an additional evidentiary requirement upon\n\nthe defense.    This language simply explains that the proposed\n\n“evidentiary factors” may help to distinguish between adaptive deficits\n\nrelated to intellectual disability and adaptive deficits related to\n\n\n                                    177\n\fsomething other than intellectual disability. See Moore, 470 S.W.3d at\n\n488 (stating that “An applicant must . . . demonstrate by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that his adaptive behavior deficits are\n\nrelated to significantly sub-average general intellectual functioning\n\nrather than some other cause.”).\n\n         In any event, use of the Briseno evidentiary factors - - which\n\nwould then be used to weigh evidence “as indicative of mental\n\nretardation or of a personality disorder” - - is not mandatory.

See Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2679204\"><a href=\"/opinion/2679204/hall-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

At the time\n\nHall was decided, ten jurors had been seated on Appellant’s jury.28\n\n      On June 3, 2014, Appellant filed a Motion to Quash the Jury\n\nPanel based on Hall.       (CR:23-24).       The visiting judge conducted a\n\nhearing on Appellant’s motion but deferred a ruling until the motion\n\nwas presented to the trial court.            (RR47:5-12).      Appellant also\n\n“object[ed] to the State . . . telling jurors that the burden on the Defense\n\nis to prove an IQ of 70 or below, or below 70.” (RR47:5).            Appellant\n\nargued that “may be unconstitutional or is unconstitutional” under\n\nHall. (RR47:5-6). This objection was overruled. (RR47:11-12).\n\n      On June 13, 2014, the trial court conducted a second hearing on\n28 Dunn-Jelen (#208); Daquiera (#256); Blomberg (#259); Kvalheim (#316); Clark\n(#353); Davenport (#504); Agnes (#588); Kiefer (#685); Wells (#802); and, McElyea\n(#857).\n                                       179\n\fAppellant’s motion. At that time, Appellant argued that “Briseno no\n\nlonger applies” after Hall. (RR53:15). The defense maintained its June\n\n3rd argument that the jury had been improperly questioned about the\n\nBriseno factors during voir dire. (RR53:16-17).     Seven days later, the\n\ntrial court convened a third hearing, during which it denied Appellant’s\n\nmotion and stated:\n\n     The Court is denying that motion. And offering the Defense\n     the opportunity as well as the State to bring the panel in\n     either collectively or one at a time to revisit the issue of 70\n     benchmark for mental retardation. The State - - made\n     reference by the State. Bearing in mind that the Court will\n     note for the record that in its questioning, the State did\n     include other factors that the jury may take into\n     consideration when making a determination of mental\n     retardation. However, since the majority of the questions\n     asked to the majority of the jurors indicated 70, I think it is\n     appropriate to revisit with the jurors. The Defense will\n     have the option of whether it wishes to proceed in that\n     manner. Or the Court is also of the opinion should the issue\n     surface during the trial, that the matter could be cured by a\n     jury instruction.\n\n(RR56:4-5).\n\n     After the competency trial, but before the beginning of the\n\npunishment trial, the trial court conducted a fourth hearing in\n\nconnection with Appellant’s motion to quash. (RR59:9). The trial court\n\n                                   180\n\fstated that, in light of Hall, it was going to individually question each of\n\nthe jurors on the panel. (RR59:9). The judge described the procedure to\n\nbe followed:\n\n       Defendant having been found competent to stand trial,\n       there’s several issues we need to address, one being\n       reviewing the . . . mental retardation issue with the panel.\n       The Court is proposing to do that individually, by calling in\n       the jurors in the order they were selected.\n\n       In the event any indicate they are not able to follow the law,\n       then we do have alternate jurors that we can question. The\n       Court is proposing to do that questioning and, in the event\n       that the jurors raise issues or questions, then I’ll allow the\n       attorneys to address or answer those questions or question\n       jurors as they may be needed.\n\n       In that absence, however, if the jurors indicate they are able\n       to follow the law, then that will conclude the Court’s\n       questioning, with respect to each and every juror, and that\n       will be the only issue that the Court will go into.\n\n(RR59:9-10). Appellant objected to the proposed procedure. (RR59:13-\n\n18).\n\n       Each juror was then brought into the courtroom individually,\n\ninformed that during jury selection the United States Supreme Court\n\nissued an opinion regarding intellectual disability and now, the trial\n\ncourt was meeting with each of the jurors to clarify the definition of\n\n                                     181\n\fintellectual disability.    The judge reminded each juror of the three-\n\nprong definition of intellectual disability and then advised that with\n\nregard to IQ scores, the score is not fixed, but represents a range or\n\napproximation of the IQ. (RR59:21-61). Each juror was asked whether\n\nhe or she could follow the law and whether he or she had any questions.\n\nEach of the jurors testified that they could follow the law. None had\n\nany questions.

As argued above, Hall stands for the proposition that\n\nstates may not prevent a defendant from litigating an intellectual\n\ndisability claim by implementing a mandatory and rigid IQ test score\n\ncutoff, without considering the IQ test’s SEM. Hall, 134 S.Ct. at 2001.\n\nUnlike Florida, Texas does not utilize a cut-off IQ score as a threshold\n\nfor litigating an intellectual disability claim.        Because Texas has no\n\napplicable statute, intellectual disability claims in death penalty cases\n\nare governed by Briseno. Briseno allows for consideration of the SEM in\n\nconnection with an IQ test. Briseno, 135 S.W.3d at 7 n.24. As a result,\n\neven after Hall, Briseno remains valid law. The jurors in this case were\n\nquestioned in accordance with Briseno. Appellant points to no place in\n\nthe transcript where any juror was questioned improperly.29\n\n\n29 During the second hearing on Appellant’s motion to quash, defense counsel\nargued that the jurors were instructed “that the IQ was 70 or below, and sometimes\nthey were told below 70[.]” (RR53:5). Counsel did not identify the jurors she claims\nwere improperly questioned.\n                                        184\n\f     Before the jury was sworn, the trial court conducted a brief\n\nhearing with each individual juror. Each juror was informed of the\n\nSupreme Court’s recent decision in Hall, reminded of the three-prong\n\ntest for intellectual disability, and informed that the significantly-\n\nsubaverage-IQ score of 70 is not a fixed number, but represents a range.\n\nEach juror was asked whether he or she could follow the law.           The\n\njurors were asked if they had any questions.         Although none had\n\nquestions, if a juror had asked one, the trial court planned to “allow the\n\nattorneys to address or answer those questions or question jurors as\n\nthey may be needed.” (RR59:9-10).\n\n     From the beginning, the jurors were questioned in accordance\n\nwith valid law. Nevertheless, the trial court took the added precaution\n\nof informing each juror individually that an IQ score is not a fixed score.\n\nEach of the jurors said that they could follow the law. Accordingly the\n\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling Appellant’s motion\n\nto quash. See Mendoza, 552 S.W.2d at 447. At a minimum, the decision\n\nfalls within the zone of reasonable disagreement. Weatherred v.

Again, Hall did not change the law\n\nin Texas. Like the State, during individual voir dire, Appellant had\n\nforty-five minutes to question each prospective juror and at that time he\n\ncould have asked them about the SEM. Notably, Appellant offers no\n\nexplanation as to why he was unable to ask the questions he proposed\n\nduring his bill of exception during his regular voir dire.\n\n     It was well within the trial court’s discretion to deny Appellant’s\n\nmotion to re-question the jurors. See Bodde, 568 S.W.2d at 350 (stating\n\nthat a trial court may impose reasonable restrictions on voir dire).\n\nAppellant’s proposed questions – all of which he could have asked\n\nduring his portion of voir dire – would have simply and unnecessarily\n\nprolonged voir dire. In any event, any alleged harm was cured when\n\nthe trial court conducted its own questioning, informed each juror that\n\nan IQ score is not a fixed number, and ensured that each juror could\n\nfollow the law.\n\n     Issue 33 should be overruled.\n\n\n                                     186\n\f                  Issue 34: Objection to State’s Voir Dire\n\n       The trial court did not err in denying Appellant’s objection to the\n\nState being allowed to say “70 or below” in explaining the definition of\n\nintellectual disability.   The only basis for Appellant’s objection to the\n\nState’s voir dire is his claim that it is not allowed under Hall.      As\n\nargued above, Hall did not change the law in Texas. Hall rejects bright-\n\nline 70 IQ cutoff scores, which Texas does not apply. Appellant points\n\nto no evidence that the State informed any juror during voir dire that\n\nan IQ score is fixed or that the SEM is not to be considered.\n\n       Issues 34 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE NOS. 35-36:      APPELLANT WAS NOT DEPRIVED\nOF A LAWFULLY CONSTITUTED JURY.\n\n\n       In Issues 35 and 36, Appellant contends that the trial court’s\n\nrulings “in reference to each juror complained about previously”\n\ndeprived him of a lawfully constituted jury resulting in violations of his\n\nrights under the state and federal constitutions and under article 35.16\n\nof the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.       (Appellant’s Brief pp. 105-\n\n07).\n\n\n\n                                    187\n\f     Appellant’s contentions lack merit as he has failed to show that he\n\nwas deprived of a lawfully constituted jury. He has failed to show the\n\ntrial court’s rulings on any of the challenges resulted in the seating of a\n\njuror who was biased or prejudiced. If an appellant does not present\n\nrecord evidence demonstrating that the trial court’s error deprived him\n\nof a jury comprised of legally qualified jurors, he has suffered no harm\n\nand the reviewing court should presume the jurors are qualified.

He contends that he was denied due\n\nprocess as the result of a conflict of interest that arose when his former\n\nsecond-chair counsel was hired as an Assistant District Attorney while\n\nthe case was in the pretrial stages. Appellant’s contentions lack merit.\n\n                            Pertinent Facts\n\n     Appellant was originally tried in September 1987. (CR:208). At\n\n                                      188\n\fthe time, he was represented by Wayne Huff and Doug Parks.\n\n(CR:208). When his case was remanded for a new trial on punishment,\n\nthe trial court appointed new counsel. In January 2011, Russell Wilson\n\nwas appointed second-chair trial counsel.             (CR:196; RR3:6, 14).         On\n\nOctober 6, 2011, Wilson filed a motion to withdraw from Appellant’s\n\ncase. (CR:196). In his motion, Wilson wrote that “[i]n June of 2011 [he]\n\naccepted employment with the Dallas County District Attorney’s\n\nOffice.” (CR:196).      “After accepting employment, [Wilson] no longer\n\nperformed work on Mr. Thomas’s behalf.” (CR:196).                   The trial court\n\ngranted Wilson’s motion to withdraw. (CR:197).\n\n      On September 7, 2011, Appellant filed a motion to disqualify the\n\nDallas County District Attorney’s Office.            (CR4:9-12).      The basis for\n\nAppellant’s motion was that Wilson, one of the attorneys who\n\nrepresented him prior to trial, was now employed by the office\n\nresponsible for his prosecution.30 (CR4:9-12). The trial court conducted\n\na hearing on Appellant’s motion.          At the hearing, Wilson testified that\n\nhe was appointed to Appellant’s case as “the second chair.” (RR3:6).\n\nRegarding his work on the case, Wilson testified that he had at least\n\n30Wilson could not the recall specific date he began at the District Attorney’s Office,\nbut he believed it was either July 1, 2011 or July 5, 2011.\n                                         189\n\fone conversation with Appellant, some conversations with lead defense\n\ncounsel, and he had received a packet of discovery from the State.\n\n(RR3:8-10).      According to Wilson, he had “not functioned as\n\n[Appellant’s] attorney . . . since [he] knew that [he] was going to be\n\ntaking a position at the district attorney’s office.” (RR3:7). He did not\n\nbelieve that he had any information about the case or witnesses that\n\nlead counsel did not also have. (RR3:17-18).\n\n     Wilson testified that prior to accepting employment at the District\n\nAttorney’s Office, he discussed with then-elected District Attorney\n\nCraig Watkins “certain understandings regarding the law and the\n\ndiscretion of the district attorney has [sic] as it relates to whether or not\n\nto seek a recusal. (RR3:21-22). Wilson and Watkins later had another\n\nconversation during which Wilson was instructed that he was not\n\nallowed to discuss Appellant’s case with “anybody.” (RR3:20). The lead\n\nprosecutor,   Brandon Birmingham,          was not    allowed to     discuss\n\nAppellant’s case with Wilson either. (RR3:20).\n\n     Wilson testified that he does not supervise Birmingham or anyone\n\nelse in the felony trial bureau division. (RR3:22). He agreed, however,\n\nthat if Appellant were sentenced to death, lawyers in one of the\n\n\n                                     190\n\fdivisions that he does supervise would be responsible for reviewing\n\nAppellant’s case. (RR3:12-13).\n\n     Appellant’s motion was denied. (RR4:4).\n\n                            Applicable Law\n\n     It is well-settled law that a district attorney’s office, not a trial\n\ncourt, determines at its discretion when a conflict of interest exists that\n\nrequires recusal.

The\n\nauthority of a district attorney cannot be abridged or taken away, and a\n\ncourt may not remove a district attorney from an individual case absent\n\none of three statutorily defined circumstances: (1) incompetency, (2)\n\nofficial misconduct, or (3) intoxication. Id. at 4-5; Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code\n\nAnn. §§ 87.013, 87.018(a) (West 2008). Moreover, a trial by jury must\n\nbe held before removal.     Eidson, 793 S.W.2d at 5.      If a trial court\n\nremoves a district attorney and his office from a case by court order, it\n\n\n                                    191\n\fdoes so “without authority or jurisdiction.”       See id. at 5 (concluding\n\nerror occurred where the trial judge’s order disqualified the district\n\nattorney because prior defense counsel became an assistant prosecutor\n\nand the trial court sought to avoid the appearance of impropriety).\n\n      In Eidson, defense counsel Ross Adair represented the defendant\n\nduring the investigation stage of a case and at an examining trial.\n\nEidson, 793 S.W.2d at 3. Adair later joined the district attorney’s office\n\nand conducted research for the State’s response to the motion to recuse\n\nthe district attorney in his former client’s case. Id.

See Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(i). Appellant\n\nasserts that the trial court erred and provides a few facts in connection\n\nwith his complaint, but other than the citation to Eidson, he fails to\n\noffer any specific argument or discussion of the authority in support of\n\nhis contention. This Court is not required to make Appellant’s case for\n\nhim. Garcia, 887 S.W.2d at 882.\n\n     In any event, Appellant’s argument fails.        Current Texas law\n\nprovides that if an assistant district attorney has previously\n\nrepresented a defendant in a particular proceeding, then that particular\n\nattorney is disqualified from assisting in the prosecution of the case, but\n\nthe elected prosecutor and his other assistants are not. Scarborough v.\n\nState, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1677277\"><a href=\"/opinion/1677277/scarborough-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 424 (Tex. App.—Waco 2001, pet. ref’d). Therefore,\n\nalthough Wilson could not participate in the instant prosecution,\n\nnothing prevented the district attorney or any of his assistants from\n\nprosecuting Appellant.\n\n     The State notes that in his motion and at the hearing, Appellant\n\ndid not raise any statutory grounds for District Attorney Craig Watkins’\n\n\n                                    193\n\fdisqualification, and no statutory grounds existed. Appellant argued at\n\ntrial and contends on appeal that a trial court may disqualify a district\n\nattorney where a conflict of interest rises to the level of a due process\n\nviolation, but he failed to assert or show how the alleged conflict\n\nviolated due process. He now asks this Court to conclude that this case\n\nconstitutes an exception to Eidson and current Texas law because (1) it\n\nis a death case, (2) former counsel worked on the case, (3) appellate\n\nattorneys in the District Attorney’s office involved in prosecuting the\n\ncase fall under Wilson’s supervision, (4) the district attorney\n\ndetermined to seek death before hiring Wilson, and (5) “the appearance\n\nof impropriety in the due process of the case.” (Appellant’s Brief p. 108).\n\n      In State ex rel. Hill v. Pirtle, this Court held that “[a] trial court\n\nmay not disqualify a district attorney or his staff on the basis of a\n\nconflict of interest that does not rise to the level of a due-process\n\nviolation.”   Landers v.

He\n\n                                    195\n\fcontends that the prosecutor’s remark regarding the “murder weapon”\n\nviolated his right to due process and due course of law and prejudiced\n\nthe jury impaneled to determine his competency.              Appellant’s\n\ncontentions lack merit.\n\n                           Pertinent Facts\n\n     Prior to voir dire in connection with Appellant’s competency trial,\n\nthe defense filed a motion in limine “with respect to informing the jury\n\nin any manner the offense for which the Defendant is accused[.]”\n\n(CR:68). The trial court granted Appellant’s motion and stated:\n\n     . . . I did grant the Motion in Limine filed by Defense. Both\n     sides instruct their witnesses not to go into the offense.\n\n(CR:70; RR57:8).\n\n     During the competency trial, while cross-examining Appellant’s\n\nexpert, the prosecutor referred to the lack of a “murder weapon.”\n\n(RR58:29). The following exchange took place:\n\n     [Prosecutor]:   He has enough understanding of these\n     proceedings to tell you that he was framed, right?\n\n     [McGarrahan]: I’m not sure I understand the question.\n\n     [Prosecutor]: You mentioned that he told you that the jury\n     in this trial that was upcoming wasn’t fixing to see nothing.\n     And he used the words because he was “convicted without a\n                                  196\n\f     weapon.” That was something that was important to him.\n\n     He kept coming back to the fact there was no weapon; is\n     that right?\n\n     [McGarrahan]: The fact that there was no weapon; and\n     there must be, by law, a weapon. Yes.\n\n     [Prosecutor]: All right. Now, it is a fact - - it is not fiction,\n     but it is a fact that there was no murder weapon - - I’m\n     sorry.\n\n(RR58:29).   At that point, defense counsel objected and asked for the\n\njury to disregard the prosecutor’s last statement. (RR58:30). Outside\n\nthe presence of the jury, the defense requested a mistrial and argued\n\nthat an instruction to disregard would not “remove this harm from this\n\njury’s mind[.]” (RR58:31-33). The prosecutor stated that his use of the\n\nword “murder” was unintentional. (RR58:34). He pointed out that in\n\nthe testimony prior to that time, the jury had already heard several\n\nterms tending to indicate a serious underlying felony:            “weapon,”\n\n“exoneree,” and “Conviction Integrity Unit.”       (RR58:34).    The State\n\nargued that an instruction to disregard would cure any alleged error.\n\n(RR58:34).\n\n     The trial court denied Appellant’s motion for mistrial and gave the\n\n\n                                    197\n\fjury the following instruction:\n\n     . . .

You are\n     hereby instructed to disregard any reference to that offense\n     and not consider it for any purpose, whatsoever.\n\n(RR58:36-37, 40).\n\n                            Applicable Law\n\n                                  Mistrial\n\n     An appellate court reviews the trial court’s denial of a motion for\n\nmistrial under an abuse-of-discretion standard.

He complains that the\n\nprosecutor’s question regarding the reversal of Appellant’s 1987 trial\n\nwas inadmissible under Rule 403.            Appellant’s contention is not\n\nproperly before the Court.\n\n                             Pertinent Facts\n\n     During    the   competency    trial,    the   prosecutor   questioned\n\nAppellant’s expert about the fact that Appellant was hoping to get a\n\n“harsher sentence” so that he would have “more appeals.” (RR58:23).\n\nThe following exchange occurred:\n\n     [State]: So he has more appeals. It is true that Kenneth\n     Thomas - - appeals have been very fruitful for Kenneth\n     Thomas, haven’t they?\n\n     [McGarrahan]: They have.\n\n     [State]: Okay. That first trial that happened in ’87 in\n     February, that case was reversed on appeal, correct?\n\n(RR58:23-24). Defense counsel objected “to relevancy.” (RR58:24). The\n\nobjection was overruled. (RR58:24). The prosecutor asked his question\n\n                                   202\n\fagain, after which Appellant objected again “to relevancy.” (RR58:24).\n\nThe objection was again overruled. (RR58:24).\n\n                             Applicable Law\n\n     Grounds of error urged on appeal must comport with the\n\nobjections made at trial or error is not preserved. Guevara v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2188747\"><a href=\"/opinion/2188747/guevara-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 583 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003).\n\n                                Analysis\n\n     Appellant’s objection on appeal does not comport with the\n\nobjection he made at trial.       At trial, Appellant objected to the\n\nprosecutor’s question on the basis of relevancy. (RR58:24). On appeal,\n\nAppellant argues that he is entitled to a reversal on the basis of a\n\nviolation of Rule 403. (Appellant’s Brief pp. 113-14).   Thus, Appellant\n\nfailed to preserve error regarding the complained-of question.          See\n\nGuevara, 97 S.W.3d at 583.\n\n     The fact that Appellant’s first trial was reversed on appeal was\n\nhighly relevant. See Tex. R. Evid. 401. Indeed, as the prosecutor’s\n\nsubsequent    questioning    showed,     Appellant   articulated   to   Dr.\n\nMcGarrahan that his prior sentence was “vacated” and his case\n\n“remanded.”    (RR58:24-25).    That Appellant’s prior sentence was\n\n\n                                   203\n\fvacated and that he was capable of articulating this information was\n\nprobative of his knowledge and understanding of the legal process. This\n\nevidence was relevant to the competency determination:               whether\n\nAppellant had a “rational as well as factual understanding of the\n\nproceedings against [him].” Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 46B.003(a)\n\n(West 2006).\n\n     On appeal, Appellant contends that the complained-of evidence\n\n“allowed the jury to confuse the issue of competency with the\n\nunderlying offense of murder.”      (Appellant’s Brief p.114).       He fails,\n\nhowever, to explain this confusion and he fails to specify how he was\n\nprejudiced. As such, this argument is insufficiently briefed and nothing\n\nis presented for this Court’s review. See Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(i).\n\n     Regardless, the same information came in elsewhere without\n\nobjection. (RR58:61). The complained-of question occurred during the\n\nState’s cross-examination of Dr. McGarrahan.         (RR58:24).        Later,\n\nduring the direct examination of defense witness Cynthia Short,\n\ndefense counsel asked a question to which Short responded, “Kenneth\n\nhad a belief that Judge White, in particular, had played a specific role\n\nin getting the case reversed.” (RR58:61). Defense counsel did not object\n\n\n                                    204\n\fto this statement. (RR58:61).      This Court has held that the erroneous\n\nadmission of evidence will not result in reversal when the same\n\nevidence was received elsewhere without objection.     See Coble v. State,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2274174\"><a href=\"/opinion/2274174/coble-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 282 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010).\n\n     Issue 39 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S   RESPONSE    TO   ISSUE    NOS.   40-41:   THE   EVIDENCE   WAS\nSUFFICIENT TO PROVE APPELLANT’S COMPETENCY TO STAND TRIAL.\n\n\n     In two issues, Appellant contends that the evidence is legally and\n\nfactually insufficient to support the jury’s verdict that he was competent\n\nto stand trial for capital murder. Appellant’s contentions lack merit\n\nand should be overruled.\n\n                            Pertinent Facts\n\n                            Appellant’s Case\n\n     Dr. Antoinette McGarrahan, a forensic and neuropsychologist,\n\nwas contacted by the defense in 2012 to conduct a neuropsychological\n\nevaluation as well as a competency-to-stand-trial evaluation of\n\nAppellant. (RR57:163-64, 167). Since then, she has spent “a little over\n\ntwelve hours” evaluating Appellant. (RR57:167).       In connection with\n\nAppellant’s recent competency evaluation, Dr. McGarrahan reviewed:\n\nAppellant’s prior mental health evaluations; transcripts of prior\n                                     205\n\fproceedings; affidavits from Appellant’s family; medical records; and,\n\nschool records. (RR57:170).\n\n       According     to     Dr.     McGarrahan,       the     results   of    her\n\nneuropsychological evaluation “are almost identical to the results [of his\n\nneuropsychological        evaluation    conducted]    about    28   years    ago.”\n\n(RR57:173).      She testified that it would be difficult “to be able to fake\n\nfrom one period to 28 years later on the same tests[.]” (RR57:173). She\n\nalso   administered       tests   to    determine    whether    Appellant     was\n\nmalingering and found that “he was putting forth good effort[.]”\n\n(RR57:173).      Indeed, Appellant tried to present himself in a positive\n\nlight, without intellectual disability, “because he believes that that\n\nbelittles him and removes some of his credibility[.]” (RR57:174).\n\n       Dr.     McGarrahan testified that Appellant was “not presently\n\ncompetent to stand trial.” (RR57:171-72). Her opinion was based on:\n\nneuropsychological testing, which showed that Appellant has a full\n\nscale IQ of 71.           (RR57:172).      Additionally, “he has significant\n\nimpairment in his ability to problem solve, plan, organize, [and] think\n\nrationally.”     (RR57:172).      Appellant perseverates; he “has difficulty\n\ngetting past certain beliefs that he has, that are not based in reality[.]”\n\n\n                                         206\n\f(RR57:172). Appellant is “not able to rationally assist his attorneys, as\n\nhe proceeds to trial.” (RR57:172).\n\n     For twenty-eight years, Appellant has maintained the belief,\n\ndespite being informed to the contrary, that the he cannot be convicted\n\n“if the State does not have a weapon.” (RR57:175). He has been told by\n\ncounsel and others that the weapon is not necessary for conviction, but\n\nhis belief remains strong. (RR57:175). Dr. McGarrahan testified that\n\nthe reason Appellant maintains his belief is rooted in his mental illness.\n\n(RR57:175). His belief is more than just a simple misunderstanding of\n\nthe legal system. (RR57:175-76).\n\n     Another belief that Appellant has maintained over the years is\n\nthat a State’s witness has been involved in “pulling the strings to make\n\nsure that he gets the worst situation possible.”       (RR57:177).    “He\n\nbelieves that this individual dressed in a jail uniform and escorted him\n\nover to court, on one occasion.” (RR57:177). Appellant also believes\n\nthat it would be to his benefit to “get the worst punishment possible.”\n\n(RR57:179).    Given Appellant’s irrational beliefs, he is unable to\n\nrationally consult with his attorneys regarding a strategy for his\n\ndefense. (RR57:179).\n\n\n                                     207\n\f     Dr. McGarrahan testified that Appellant has a factual, but not\n\nrational understanding of the proceedings against him.      (RR57:181).\n\nAnd, distortions in his memory and false beliefs affect his ability to\n\ndisclose information to counsel. (RR57:182). He does, however, have a\n\ngood understanding of the adversarial nature of the proceedings and\n\ncan exhibit appropriate courtroom behavior. (RR57:184). If he were to\n\ntestify, he could respond to questions and verbalize his responses, but\n\n“he would have significant difficulty testifying in a rational, logical\n\nmanner.” (RR57:184).    Appellant could be helped with medication and\n\ncompetency restoration training. (RR57:186).\n\n     According to Dr. McGarrahan, Appellant has a delusional disorder\n\nbut conceded that he is not schizophrenic and is not responding to\n\noutside voices or voices in his head. (RR57:185; RR58:6). Appellant is\n\nintellectually disabled, evidenced by his low IQ and deficits in his\n\nadaptive behavior, many of which began prior to the age of 18.\n\n(RR57:185).\n\n      Dr. McGarrahan conceded that in 1979, Appellant was involved\n\nin a trial and testified in his own defense. (RR58:11). At that time, he\n\nresponded to questions on direct and cross-examination in front of a\n\n\n                                  208\n\fjury.    (RR58:11).   To Dr. McGarrahan’s knowledge, no competency\n\nissues were raised at the time of that trial. (RR58:13). The first time\n\ncompetency was raised was in October of 1986, during jury selection.\n\n(RR58:13). At that time, Drs. Crowder, Koons, Lovett, and Nottingham\n\ntestified or wrote a report. (RR58:13). Drs. Koons and Nottingham\n\nfound Appellant to be competent. (RR58:15). Drs. Crowder and Lovett\n\nfound him to be incompetent. (RR58:46). In 1996, in connection with\n\nanother proceeding, Appellant was evaluated by Drs. Pittman and\n\nRogers. (RR58:15-16).        Dr. Pittman found him to be competent.\n\n(RR58:16). Dr. McGarrahan testified that Dr. Rogers’ opinion “wasn’t\n\nvery clear.”    (RR58:16).     In 2006, there was a hearing regarding\n\nAppellant’s case and no issues of competency were raised at that time.\n\n(RR58:16-17).\n\n        Regarding the evidence against him in this case, Appellant told\n\nDr. McGarrahan that he “was fucked over 27 years ago, because they\n\nonly have he said/she said.”     (RR58:18).   He said it was “hearsay.”\n\n(RR58:19). Appellant told Dr. McGarrahan that the fingerprints found\n\nat the scene were being reviewed by the Innocence Project. (RR58:20-\n\n21). He told her that when the fingerprints are reviewed, they will not\n\n\n                                    209\n\fmatch him.     (RR58:21). This “will stop everything and the Judge will\n\nset him free immediately.” (RR58:27). He identified the then-elected\n\nDistrict Attorney, Craig Watkins, and said that Watkins would be\n\nforced to drop the charges.        (RR58:27).   Appellant also told Dr.\n\nMcGarrahan that DNA testing “rendered him innocent.” (RR58:22).\n\n     Appellant wants a “harsher sentence” so that he will have “more\n\nappeals.” (RR58:23). He told her that his prior sentence was “vacated”\n\nand his case “remanded.” (RR58:24-25). He pointed out to her two\n\ncases from the Supreme Court relevant to his case and was “somewhat”\n\nable to describe the difference between them. (RR58:25-26).\n\n     Dr.     McGarrahan testified that      Appellant   is not   on any\n\npsychoactive medications. (RR58:41).\n\n     Cynthia Short, an attorney who performs client advocacy, was\n\nappointed by the trial court in 2011 to assist in Appellant’s case.\n\n(RR58:54).     Since then, she has spent sixty hours interviewing\n\nAppellant.    (RR58:55).   Appellant resembles prior clients who were\n\nfound incompetent.    (RR58:58).     He maintains a “fixed-false belief”\n\nabout his case and that belief informs his decisions. (RR58:59). He also\n\ndid not understand that the trial judge did not have a role in the\n\n\n                                    210\n\freversal of his case. (RR58:61).\n\n     Short did not believe that Appellant could make rational choices\n\nregarding his legal strategies. (RR58:63). For example, he did not want\n\nto be examined by the State’s expert despite being told that failure to do\n\nso would affect his lawyers’ ability to present evidence gathered on his\n\nbehalf. (RR58:63-65).\n\n     Short described Appellant as follows:\n\n     In many ways, Kenneth is very engaging. He can be very\n     animated. He is able to engage in a conversation. He’s\n     very, very spiritual. He’s very faithful. And we have had\n     many long, animated, good conversations about faith.\n\n     But when we switch to talk about things that are related to\n     the legal process, to criminal justice, then there is a\n     different way in which he understands or attends. He\n     becomes more rigid and flexible [sic], in terms of his\n     understanding of the system and how to make decisions.\n\n(RR58:65-66).   She believes that Appellant would not be able to testify\n\nin his own defense. (RR58:68). She testified that Appellant has “poor\n\nauditory memory” and poor reasoning skills. (RR58:70).\n\n     Short testified that Appellant sustained a brain injury in 1976.\n\n(RR58:71).\n\n     On cross-examination, Short conceded that Appellant testified in\n\n                                   211\n\fhis own defense after the Linwood incident in 1979, years after his\n\nbrain injury. (RR58:71-72). After his arrest for the instant offense,\n\nAppellant spoke with a detective and gave an alibi.31 (RR58:74-75). He\n\nalso gave a TV reporter his alibi. (RR58:76).           Short conceded that\n\nAppellant, if he testified in this case, could tell the jury his version of\n\nthe evidence (that he was not present at the scene of the crime, that the\n\nDNA exonerates him, and that there is no murder weapon). (RR58:86-\n\n88).\n\n                              The State’s Case\n\n       Dr. Kristi Compton, a clinical and forensic psychologist, was\n\nappointed by the trial court to evaluate Appellant’s competency to stand\n\ntrial. (RR58:92-93). Dr. Compton evaluated Appellant on July 3, 2014\n\nat the Dallas County Jail. (RR58:94-95).           Over the course of three\n\nhours, she interviewed and tested Appellant. (RR58:94; SX1-2).            She\n\nadministered the Test of Memory Malingering (“TOMM”), an effort test.\n\n(RR58:99). Appellant was required to look at a series of 50 pictures,\n\nthen identify what he saw.        (RR58:99-100).     A person with normal\n\nintellect would correctly identify 45 of the 50 pictures. (RR58:99-100).\n\n31According to Short, Appellant maintains that he did not meet with detectives.\n(RR58:73-76),\n                                      212\n\fAn individual with intellectual disability will generally identify 30\n\ncorrectly.   (RR58:101).    A score of 25 or below is indicative of overt\n\nmalingering. (RR58:101).       Appellant was administered two trials; he\n\ncorrectly identified 24 out of 50 on the first and 26 out of 50 on the\n\nsecond. (RR58:102). His scores reflected that “he was not putting forth\n\nthe full effort during the evaluation[.]” (RR58:102).\n\n        Dr. Compton also administered the Kaufman Brief Intelligence\n\nTest.     (RR58:97, 103).    Appellant obtained a full-scale IQ of 40.\n\n(RR58:104). A person taking this test gets 40 points just for showing\n\nup.     (RR58:104).   Someone with a 40 IQ “would not be able to\n\ncommunicate.” (RR58:105). “[I]t’s very, very unlikely [a person with a\n\n40 IQ] would be able to communicate in full sentences or understand\n\nmuch beyond that of a three- to four-year-old child.”         (RR58:105).\n\nAppellant’s score was inconsistent with his previous scores, which\n\n“indicate a range between high 60s to low 70s.” (RR58:105).\n\n        Dr. Compton administered the CAST-MR, a test to evaluate\n\ncompetency-related abilities in an individual with low intellect.\n\n(RR58:109). In the Basic Legal Concepts section of this test, the mean\n\nnumber of correct responses for individuals who are incompetent is 13.\n\n\n                                     213\n\f(RR58:110). Appellant answered no questions correctly. (RR58:110).\n\nOn the Skills to Assist Defense Section, the mean number of correct\n\nresponses for individuals with intellectual disability is 8, with an SEM\n\nof 3. (RR58:111). Appellant scored a 5, which is “somewhere within the\n\nrange” of those with intellectual disability. (RR58:111).           When asked\n\nfor spontaneous recall of the roles of the parties (unlike the structured\n\nquestion-and-answer),       Appellant     answered     all   of   the   questions\n\nsufficiently. (RR58:111).\n\n      Appellant correctly described the roles of the parties: the defense\n\nattorneys; prosecutor; and, judge.32 (RR58:106). He understands that\n\nhe has been convicted, that the upcoming trial concerns punishment,\n\nand that there are two possible sentences. (RR58:107-08). Appellant’s\n\nresponses were inconsistent with a 40-point IQ. (RR58:107). According\n\nto Dr. Compton, Appellant “responded to [her] rationally and logically\n\nand processed what [she] was asking, and responded accordingly.”\n\n(RR58:107). And, “there’s no identifiable nexus between mental illness\n\nand [Appellant’s] ability to consistently engage with counsel.”\n\n(RR58:109).       Dr. Compton ranked Appellant’s abilities as follows:\n32 Appellant indicated that he knew a judge is supposed to ensure a fair trial, but\ntold Dr. Compton that they do not. (RR58:106). There was no evidence of a nexus\nbetween this belief and Appellant’s mental state. (RR58:107).\n                                        214\n\fability to disclose facts and events to counsel-below average; ability to\n\nengage in a reasoned choice of legal strategies-below average; ability to\n\ntestify and cross-examine witnesses-below average; ability to assist\n\ncounsel with a defense-below average. (RR58:128-29).\n\n     Throughout the evaluation, Appellant was cooperative with Dr.\n\nCompton.      (RR58:113).   He “related spontaneously” and made eye\n\ncontact. His hygiene was good. (RR58:113).\n\n     Dr. Compton testified that Appellant “functions in the borderline\n\nto mental/mild mental retardation.” (RR58:114).       She did not know\n\nwhere in the range “because [she did] not do adaptive deficits.”\n\n(RR58:114). She did not identify a clinical disorder such as depression,\n\nmania, bipolar disorder, or intense anxiety. (RR58:114). She did not\n\nobserve that he was overtly psychotic or responding to hallucinations.\n\n(RR58:114).    He does, however, have subclinical paranoid delusions\n\nabout being framed and about the lack of a weapon.           (RR58:115).\n\nSomeone with a clinical delusion cannot remove himself from his\n\ndelusion. (RR58:126). Someone with a subclinical delusion is capable of\n\nrecognizing other possibilities. (RR58:126).     Appellant’s subclinical\n\ndelusions are not sufficient to impair his competency status.\n\n\n                                   215\n\f(RR58:116).\n\n      In Dr. Compton’s opinion, Appellant was competent to stand trial.\n\n(RR58:98). He has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyers\n\nwith a reasonable degree of rational understanding and has a rational,\n\nas well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\n\n(RR58:98).\n\n                                Applicable Law\n\n                                  Competency\n\n      “A defendant is presumed competent to stand trial and shall be\n\nfound competent to stand trial unless proved incompetent[.]” Tex. Code\n\nCrim. Proc. Ann. art. 46B.003(b) (West 2006).             A defendant is not\n\ncompetent to stand trial if he lacks:\n\n  (1) Sufficient present ability to consult with the person’s lawyer\n      with a reasonable degree of rational understanding; or\n\n  (2) A rational as well as factual understanding of the\n      proceedings against the person.\n\nId. art. 46B.003(a).

Id. art. 46B.003(b).\n\n                            Legal Sufficiency\n\n     A claim regarding a jury’s refusal to find a defendant incompetent\n\nto stand trial – a determination which he has the burden to prove – is\n\nsimilar to an affirmative defense.

Crim. App. 1990). The appellate court must consider all of\n\nthe relevant evidence and may not usurp the function of the jury by\n\nsubstituting its judgment in place of the jury's assessment of the weight\n\nand credibility of the witnesses’ testimony. Matlock, 392 S.W.3d at 671.\n\nThe defendant’s claim is sustained only if, after setting out the relevant\n\nevidence and explaining precisely how the contrary evidence greatly\n\noutweighs the evidence supporting the verdict, the court clearly states\n\nwhy the verdict is so much against the great weight of the evidence as\n\nto be manifestly unjust, conscience-shocking, or clearly biased. Id.\n\n                                   Analysis\n\n         Appellant has failed to properly brief the issues. He recites the\n\nevidence and the standard of review, however, he fails to offer any\n\nargument or authority in support of his claims.         See Tex. R. App. P.\n\n38.1(i).\n\n         Regardless, the evidence is both legally and factually sufficient to\n\nsupport the jury’s determination that Appellant was competent to stand\n\ntrial.\n\n\n                                      218\n\f                         Issue 40: Legal Sufficiency\n\n     A review of the record reveals more than a scintilla of evidence to\n\nsupport the jury’s finding. The following evidence supports the jury’s\n\nfinding of competency:\n\n      Appellant can be engaging and animated and can\n       participate in long conversations about faith. (RR58:65-\n       66).\n\n      He understands that he has been convicted, that the\n       upcoming trial concerns punishment, and that there are\n       two possible sentences. (RR57:181; RR58:107-08).\n\n      Appellant can articulate that his prior sentence was\n       “vacated” and his case “remanded” and can cite relevant\n       Supreme Court cases and “somewhat” describe the\n       difference between them. (RR58:25-26).\n\n      Appellant can relate his mental state, alleged offense,\n       and events related to this stage of his case. (RR58:125).\n\n      Appellant can correctly describe the roles of the parties:\n       the defense attorneys; prosecutor; and, judge. (RR57:187;\n       RR58:106).\n\n      Appellant can exhibit appropriate courtroom behavior.\n       (RR57:184).\n\n      If called to testify, Appellant could respond verbally to\n       questioning. (RR57:184). He could tell the jury his\n       version of the evidence, including his claim that he was\n       not present at the scene of the crime, that there is no\n       murder weapon, and that the DNA shows he is innocent.\n       (RR58:86-88).\n\n                                     219\n\f      According to Dr. Compton, “there’s no identifiable nexus\n       between mental illness and [Appellant’s] ability to\n       consistently engage with counsel.” (RR58:109).\n\n      Dr. Compton testified that Appellant “functions in the\n       borderline   to    mental/mild     mental      retardation.”\n       (RR58:114).     She did not know where in the range,\n       “because [she did] not do adaptive deficits.” (RR58:114).\n\n      Dr. Compton identified no clinical disorder such as\n       depression, mania, bipolar disorder, or intense anxiety.\n       (RR58:114). She did not observe that he was overtly\n       psychotic or responding to hallucinations. (RR58:114).\n\n      Appellant is not schizophrenic and does not respond to\n       outside voices or voices in his head. (RR58:6).\n\n      Appellant is not on any psychoactive medications.\n       (RR58:41).\n\n     In short, the jury had substantial evidence from which it could\n\nhave concluded that Appellant had sufficient present ability to consult\n\nwith his lawyers with a reasonable degree of rational understanding\n\nand that he had a rational as well as factual understanding of the\n\nproceedings against him. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art.\n\n46B.003(a).   Appellant did not conclusively prove that he was\n\nincompetent. The jury was entitled to believe Dr. Compton’s testimony\n\nthat Appellant was competent to stand trial. (RR58:98).\n\n\n                                   220\n\f     Issue 40 should be overruled.\n\n                     Issue 41: Factual Sufficiency\n\n     The evidence is factually sufficient to support the jury’s\n\ndetermination that Appellant was competent to stand trial.         The\n\nfollowing evidence, when considered in a neutral light, proves that the\n\njury’s finding that Appellant was competent to stand trial was not\n\nagainst the great weight and preponderance of the evidence:\n\n      Dr. McGarrahan testified that Appellant was not\n       competent to stand trial. (RR57:171-72).\n\n      Dr. Compton testified that Appellant was competent to\n       stand trial. (RR58:98). He had sufficient present ability\n       to consult with his lawyers with a reasonable degree of\n       rational understanding and had a rational, as well as\n       factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\n       (RR58:98).\n\n      Dr. McGarrahan testified that Appellant had a factual\n       (but not rational) understanding of the proceedings\n       against him. (RR57:181). He understood that his prior\n       sentence was “vacated” and his case “remanded.”\n       (RR58:24-25). In the upcoming trial, he wants a “harsher\n       sentence” so that he will have “more appeals.” (RR58:23).\n\n      Dr. Compton testified that Appellant understands that\n       he has been convicted, that the upcoming trial concerns\n       punishment, and that there are two possible sentences.\n       (RR58:107-08).\n\n      Appellant understands the adversarial nature of the\n\n                                     221\n\f  proceedings. (RR57:184). He understands the roles of the\n  parties: the defense attorneys; prosecutor; and, judge.\n  (RR58:106).\n\n Regarding the evidence against him, Appellant told Dr.\n  McGarrahan that the State “only [has] he said/she said.”\n  (RR58:18). He told her that the fingerprints at the scene\n  will not match him and the DNA testing “render[s] him\n  innocent.” (RR58:20-22).\n\n Dr. McGarrahan testified that Appellant is not able to\n  rationally assist his attorneys. (RR57:172). He persists\n  in his belief he cannot be convicted if the State does not\n  have the murder weapon. (RR57:172, 175).\n\n Short testified that that Appellant’s “fixed-false belief”\n  informs his decisions regarding the case. (RR58:59).\n\n Short did not believe that Appellant could make rational\n  choices regarding his legal strategies. (RR58:63). For\n  example, he did not want to be examined by the State’s\n  expert even though it would affect his lawyers’ ability to\n  present evidence gathered on his behalf. (RR58:63-65).).\n\n Dr. McGarrahan testified that if Appellant were to\n  testify, he could respond to questions and verbalize his\n  responses, but would have difficulty doing so in a\n  rational, logical manner. (RR57:184).\n\n Short testified that Appellant would not be able to testify\n  in his own defense but later conceded that if he did, he\n  could tell the jury his version of the evidence (that he was\n  not present at the scene of the crime, that the DNA\n  exonerates him, and that there is no murder weapon).\n  (RR58:68, 86-88).\n\n Dr. Compton testified that Appellant “responded to [her]\n\n                              222\n\f  rationally and logically and processed what [she] was\n  asking, and responded accordingly.” (RR58:107).\n\n According to Dr. Compton, there is “there’s no\n  identifiable nexus between mental illness and\n  [Appellant’s] ability to consistently engage with counsel.”\n  (RR58:109). “[E]ven a mentally ill defendant who resists\n  cooperating with his counsel may nevertheless be found\n  competent if the manifestations of his particular mental\n  illness are not shown to be the engine of his obstinacy.”\n  Turner v.

App.\n  2013).\n\n Appellant can exhibit appropriate courtroom behavior.\n  (RR57:184).\n\n When tested by Dr. McGarrahan, Appellant put forth\n  good effort and tried to present himself in a positive light.\n  (RR57:174). Dr. McGarrahan’s testing showed a full scale\n  IQ of 71. (RR57:172).\n\n When tested by Dr. Compton, Appellant did not put forth\n  good effort. (RR58:102). Her IQ testing showed a full\n  scale IQ of 40, which is inconsistent with his prior scores.\n  Additionally, given the fact that someone with a 40-point\n  IQ would not be able to communicate, Appellant’s 40-\n  point IQ score was inconsistent with the fact that he was\n  able to communicate with her. (RR58:104-05). On the\n  CAST-MR, Appellant answered no questions correctly in\n  the Basic Legal Concepts section. (RR58:110). On the\n  Skills to Assist Defense Section, he scored within the\n  range of those with intellectual disability. (RR58:111).\n\n Dr. McGarrahan testified that Appellant is intellectually\n  disabled. (RR57:185).\n\n Dr. Compton testified that Appellant “functions in the\n\n                              223\n\f        borderline   to    mental/mild     mental      retardation.”\n        (RR58:114).     She did not know where in the range,\n        “because [she did] not do adaptive deficits.” (RR58:114).\n\n      Dr. McGarrahan testified that Appellant suffers from a\n       delusional disorder, but is not schizophrenic and does not\n       respond to outside voices or voices in his head.\n       (RR57:185; RR58:6).\n\n      Dr. Compton did not identify a clinical disorder such as\n       depression, mania, bipolar disorder, or intense anxiety.\n       (RR58:114). She did not observe that he was overtly\n       psychotic or responding to hallucinations. (RR58:114).\n       He has subclinical paranoid delusions but they are not\n       sufficient to impair his competency status. (RR58:116).\n\n      Appellant is not on any psychoactive medications.\n       (RR58:41).\n\n     The   jury    was   faced   with    conflicting   opinions   from   two\n\npsychologists.    On the one hand was Dr. McGarrahan, the defense\n\nexpert involved in the case for at least two years, who testified to her\n\nopinion that Appellant was incompetent. (RR57:166-67, 171-72). On\n\nthe other hand was Dr. Compton, the trial court’s neutral expert\n\nappointed only days before the competency trial, who testified to her\n\nopinion that Appellant was competent. (RR58:93-95, 98).\n\n     The jury was entitled to credit Dr. Compton’s testimony that\n\nAppellant was competent to stand trial. Dr. Compton was a neutral\n\n\n                                   224\n\fwitness who offered specific testimony regarding her testing and\n\nevaluation of Appellant and her opinion regarding his competency. Dr.\n\nCompton testified that Appellant’s belief in his innocence was “not\n\nsufficient to impair rational communication” with counsel. (RR58:108-\n\n09).   She testified that Appellant understood the charges against him;\n\nthat he was already convicted; that the upcoming trial concerned\n\npunishment only; and the potential punishments. (RR58:107-08, 136).\n\nSee Morris v.

The fact that some\n\nevidence was presented that could support a finding of incompetency\n\ndoes not render the evidence insufficient. See Butcher, 454 S.W.3d at\n\n20.\n\n       On appeal, Appellant suggests that the reason he performed\n\npoorly on Dr. Compton’s tests was because he did not want to be found\n\n\n                                  225\n\fdisabled and because he thought the evaluation was meant to belittle\n\nand shame him. (Appellant’s Brief p. 118). Appellant’s argument lacks\n\nmerit. If, as Appellant suggests, he did not want to be found\n\nintellectually disabled, it would stand to reason that his scores would be\n\nhigher, reflecting increased effort. Instead, on Dr. Compton’s IQ test,\n\nAppellant’s score was so low that it was not only inconsistent with his\n\nprior IQ testing, but also inconsistent with the level that he was able to\n\ncommunicate with Dr. Compton. (RR58:104-05). On one trial of Dr.\n\nCompton’s malingering test, Appellant’s score was so low that it was\n\nindicative of overt malingering. (RR58:101-02). In any event, Appellant\n\nfails to explain how his lack of participation proves that he was\n\nincompetent to stand trial.\n\n         Appellant suggests that Dr. Compton’s opinion was not reliable\n\nbecause her appointment and evaluation took place only days before\n\ntrial; therefore, she “did not have the time to fully research [Appellant’s]\n\nchildhood, his brain injury, or his prison history.” (Appellant’s Brief\n\np.119). Appellant does not specify, however, how further research into\n\nthe identified areas would have shed light on his competency to stand\n\ntrial.\n\n\n                                    226\n\f       Given all of the testimony and evidence presented, the jury could\n\nhave weighed the conflicting evidence and reasonably found that\n\nAppellant was sufficiently capable of consulting with his attorneys and\n\nwith a reasonable degree of rational understanding and that he had a\n\nrational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against\n\nhim.    The jury's determination that Appellant was competent to stand\n\ntrial was not so against the great weight and preponderance of the\n\nevidence as to be manifestly unjust.\n\n        Issues 40 and 41 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S   RESPONSE TO ISSUE NO.        42:   THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY\nOVERRULED APPELLANT’S OBJECTION TO DR. PRICE’S TESTIMONY THAT\nAPPELLANT      EXHIBITS    TRAITS      CONSISTENT    WITH     ANTI-SOCIAL\nPERSONALITY DISORDER.\n\n\n        Appellant contends that, during the punishment phase of trial,\n\nthe trial court erred in overruling his objection to Dr. Price’s proffered\n\ntestimony that Appellant exhibits traits consistent with anti-social\n\npersonality disorder. In support of his contention, Appellant points to\n\nthe fact that Dr. Price did not diagnose Appellant with this disorder.\n\nAppellant’s contentions lack merit and should be overruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                    227\n\f                            Pertinent Facts\n\n       During a hearing outside the presence of the jury in the\n\npunishment phase of trial, Dr. Price testified that he planned to testify\n\nbefore the jury that Appellant exhibits traits consistent with anti-social\n\npersonality disorder. (RR69:8).    Dr. Price testified, however, that he\n\nwould not diagnose Appellant with anti-social personality disorder\n\nbecause he is not aware of any evidence of a conduct disorder prior to\n\nthe age of 15. (RR69:8). At the conclusion of the hearing, Appellant\n\nobjected that Dr. Price’s testimony would be inadmissible under Rule\n\n403. (RR69:11). Defense counsel objected as follows:\n\n     Your Honor, I do have - - I will object to him testifying in\n     front of the jury about him having the traits of someone\n     with anti-social personality disorder, since he can’t make\n     that diagnosis. I think, because he’s an expert, he gives\n     that inference to the jury. I think it’s dangerous testimony\n     put in front of them, when he can’t even make the diagnosis\n     himself.\n\n     So I would object to him testifying that he has those traits,\n     without being able to make the diagnosis. Even if the Court\n     thinks it’s relevant somehow, I just think that the\n     prejudicial effect outweighs the probative value, in the way\n     he’s going to present it.\n\n\n\n\n                                   228\n\f(RR69:11).   The trial court overruled Appellant’s objection. (RR69:12-\n\n13).\n\n       Before the jury, Dr. Price testified that anti-social personality\n\ndisorder is not a mental disorder, but a long-term personality disorder.\n\n(RR69:66-67).   An individual with this disorder is “kind of against\n\nsociety. It’s an individual who breaks the rules, breaks the law, [and]\n\ndoesn’t accept responsibility for it.” (RR69:67). One requirement for a\n\ndiagnosis of anti-social personality disorder is evidence of a conduct\n\ndisorder prior to the age of 15. (RR69:67-68).    A child with a conduct\n\ndisorder “gets in trouble all the time, skips school, gets in trouble with\n\nthe law, sets fires, is aggressive towards others, et cetera.” (RR69:68).\n\nBased on his review of the case and his interaction with Appellant, Dr.\n\nPrice testified that Appellant “does have traits and features consistent\n\nwith this anti-social personality.” (RR69:68).    Appellant renewed his\n\nprior objection and it was overruled. (RR69:68). Dr. Price then briefly\n\nexplained the basis for his opinion. (RR69:69-72). Importantly, Dr.\n\nPrice testified that he lacked evidence regarding one of the traits\n\nnecessary for a diagnosis of anti-social personality disorder. (RR69:71).\n\n\n\n\n                                   229\n\fDr. Price lacked evidence that the traits began prior to 15 years of age.\n\n(RR69:71-72).\n\n       During cross-examination, defense counsel asked Dr. Price about\n\nhis opinion that Appellant exhibits traits consistent with anti-social\n\npersonality disorder. (RR69:87, 90). He pointed out on at least two\n\nseparate occasions that Dr. Price could not diagnose Appellant with the\n\ndisorder. (RR69:87, 90).\n\n                           Standard of Review\n\n     An appellate court reviews a trial court’s ruling on the\n\nadmissibility of evidence under an abuse of discretion standard of\n\nreview.   See Weatherred, 15 S.W.3d at 542. The trial court’s ruling\n\nshould be upheld if it is within the zone of reasonable disagreement.

To the extent Appellant is suggesting that a psychologist is\n\nunable to testify that, based on his review of documents, an individual\n\nis symptomatic of a specific condition, he points to no authority in\n\n                                   232\n\fsupport of his claims. He points to no authority suggesting that such\n\ntestimony is prohibited in that profession.\n\n     In any event, any complaint Appellant had regarding Dr. Price’s\n\nqualifications was waived at the time of trial.   During the sub rosa\n\nhearing prior to Dr. Price’s testimony before the jury, the following\n\nexchange occurred:\n\n     [State]: Judge, I believe, as we have done with Dr.\n     McGarrahan, I believe Dr. Hom and Dr. Crowder, I don’t\n     anticipate objections from Defense that Dr. Price is an\n     expert who is qualified to give certain opinions. I believe\n     that’s the agreement that we have from Mr. Sanchez.\n\n     [Sanchez]: That’s correct, Your Honor.\n\n     [Trial Court]: Very well.\n\n     [State]: So this will be just me - - I will tender him as an\n     expert at this point.\n\n     [Trial Court]: Very well.\n\n     [State]: And then we’ll ask what his opinions are, and we’ll\n     go from there.\n\n(RR68:241-42). The parties agreed that Dr. Price was, in fact, an expert\n\nand the only issue to be addressed was the basis for his opinions. See\n\nTex. R. Evid. 705(b) (stating that an adverse party is entitled to\n\n                                   233\n\fquestion an expert outside the presence of the jury regarding the facts\n\nor data underlying the expert’s opinion).    Appellant did not challenge\n\nDr. Price’s qualifications at the time of trial and he cannot do so for the\n\nfirst time on appeal. Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a).\n\n       Appellant argues that Dr. Price’s testimony was “misleading and\n\ndesigned to give the jury the impression that Appellant had a diagnosed\n\nanti-social personality disorder[.]” (Appellant’s Brief pp.120-21). This\n\nis incorrect. In fact, Dr. Price was upfront about the limitations of his\n\ntestimony. He testified that Appellant “does have traits and features\n\nconsistent with” anti-social personality disorder, but he lacked evidence\n\nof one of the features required to render a diagnosis: evidence that the\n\nsymptoms began before 15 years of age.       (RR69:68, 71-72). On cross-\n\nexamination, he agreed with defense counsel on two separate occasions\n\nthat he could not diagnose Appellant with anti-social personality\n\ndisorder. (RR69:87, 90). The jury was not misled in any way.\n\n                                Rule 403\n\n        At trial, Appellant objected to Dr. Price’s testimony under Rule\n\n403.   Defense counsel stated “that the prejudicial effect outweighs the\n\nprobative value, in the way he’s going to present it.” (RR69:11).   In his\n\n\n                                    234\n\fbrief on appeal, Appellant states that “any probative value was\n\noutweighed by the prejudicial effect.”     (Appellant’s Brief p.121).     As\n\nabove, he offers no argument or analysis on this issue; therefore,\n\nnothing is presented for this Court’s review. See Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(i)\n\n(requiring that a brief contain a clear and concise argument for the\n\ncontentions made, with appropriate citations to authorities and to the\n\nrecord); see, e.g., Walder v.

First, Dr.\n\nPrice’s testimony was relevant to rebut Appellant’s claim that he is\n\nintellectually disabled. His testimony was presented during the State’s\n\ncase-in-rebuttal to offer an alternate explanation for Dr. McGarrahan’s\n\ntestimony regarding Appellant’s symptoms. As such, his testimony was\n\nhighly probative to rebut the evidence that the defense presented.\n\n       Dr.    Price’s   testimony   was   also   relevant   to   the   jury’s\n\ndetermination of Appellant’s future dangerousness.

While Dr. Price testified\n\nthat Appellant exhibits traits consistent with antisocial personality\n\ndisorder, he was clear that he could not diagnose Appellant with the\n\ndisorder. (RR69: 68, 71-72, 90).\n\n       Third, Dr. Price’s testimony regarding antisocial personality\n\ndisorder, which was presented during the State’s case-in-rebuttal, was\n\nextremely brief. The State’s questioning on this subject consumed less\n\nthan seven pages of transcript. (RR69:16, 66-72).\n\n       Finally, the State needed Dr. Price’s testimony to rebut Dr.\n\nMcGarrahan’s    testimony    regarding   Appellant’s     alleged      adaptive\n\n\n\n\n                                   236\n\fdeficits.

Error\n\nin the admission of evidence is non-constitutional error and must be\n\ndisregarded unless the error affects a defendant’s substantial rights.\n\nSee Tex. R. Evid. 103; Tex. R.

Dr. Price testified that someone with antisocial\n\npersonality disorder “breaks the rules, breaks the law, doesn’t accept\n\nresponsibility for it.” (RR69:67). That Appellant was one who breaks\n\nrules and laws was already well known to the jury.       By the time Dr.\n\n\n                                    237\n\fPrice testified, the jury already knew that Appellant broke into the\n\nFinch home, stabbed Mildred and Fred to death, and then stole\n\nnumerous items from Fred’s wardrobe.        The jury already knew that\n\nAppellant had stabbed Linwood in the head with a screwdriver. The\n\njury already knew about Appellant’s misconduct in prison.       Dr. Price’s\n\ntestimony had no negative impact on Appellant. Any alleged error did\n\nnot affect Appellant’s substantial rights. See Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b).\n\n     Issues 42 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S   RESPONSE TO ISSUE    43:   DR. PRICE DID NOT TESTIFY BEFORE\nTHE JURY REGARDING APPELLANT’S REMORSE.\n\n\n       Appellant contends that the trial court erred in allowing Dr.\n\nPrice to testify regarding his lack of remorse. Appellant’s contentions\n\nlack merit.\n\n                            Pertinent Facts\n\n       During a sub rosa hearing, Dr. Price was asked for the basis of\n\nhis opinion that Appellant exhibits traits of anti-social personality\n\ndisorder. (RR69:7). He responded as follows:\n\n     Criminal history, his history; especially, prior to 2010, and\n     as far back as 1979, which indicates a repeated pattern of\n     violation of the law; a lack of remorse for those incidents;\n     deceitfulness by repeated lying through the record, both in\n\n                                     238\n\f     response to the offenses and in talking to individuals in\n     prison and others that have evaluated him; at least, a\n     history or irritability and aggressiveness.\n\n(RR69:8). At the conclusion of the hearing, Appellant objected to this\n\ntestimony and complained that it would “violate the Defendant’s Fifth\n\nAmendment right[.]”      (RR69:13).        The objection was overruled.\n\n(RR69:13).\n\n                           Applicable Law\n\n     A reference to a defendant’s lack of remorse is tantamount to a\n\ncomment on his failure to testify.

Importantly, Appellant does not specify where in Dr. Price’s\n\ntestimony before the jury that he refers to Appellant’s lack of remorse.\n\n                                     239\n\fThe State is unable to locate any exchange before the jury wherein Dr.\n\nPrice refers to Appellant’s remorse. Additionally, beyond the statement\n\nthat the unspecified error “violated Appellant’s right to remain silent\n\nand is of constitutional error dimension [and] denied Appellant a fair\n\npunishment hearing,” Appellant offers no argument or analysis.        He\n\ndoes not explain how Dr. Price’s testimony violated his right to remain\n\nsilent. This Court is not required to make Appellant’s case for him.\n\nGarcia, 887 S.W.2d at 882.\n\n       Issue 43 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S   RESPONSE TO ISSUE    44:    THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR IN\nADMITTING A SILHOUETTE OF A KNIFE AS A DEMONSTRATIVE AID.\n\n\n       Appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nobjection to State’s Exhibit #206, a PowerPoint presentation, which\n\ndepicts silhouettes of a single edged blade, because it was speculative.\n\nAppellant points to the fact that the purported murder weapon was\n\nnever introduced into evidence. Appellant’s contentions lack merit.\n\n                             Pertinent Facts\n\n       State’s Exhibit #206 is a PowerPoint presentation that the State\n\nand the medical examiner, Dr. Edward McDonough, compiled to assist\n\n\n                                     240\n\fthe doctor in his testimony regarding the autopsy on Mildred. It was\n\nadmitted over Appellant’s objection for record purposes only. (RR61:49).\n\nAppellant’s objection related to two slides of the exhibit, slides 2 and 5.\n\nSlide 2, entitled, “Stab Wound – Single Edge Blade Characteristics,”\n\ncontains a computer generated image of a single edged knife next to\n\nState’s Exhibit #63, a photograph of one of Mildred’s stab wounds.\n\n(SX206). Slide 5, entitled, “Stab Wound Depth Analysis,” depicts three\n\nsilhouettes that correspond to wounds of various depths. (SX206).\n\n        In a hearing outside the presence of the jury, Appellant objected\n\nto State’s Exhibit #206.33 (RR69:11). He stated the following:\n\n      One thing further, Your Honor. I think the State, as part of\n      their presentation with the medical examiner, will have a\n      PowerPoint which shows a silhouette of a knife next to the\n      pictures. I would object to that as speculative. Especially\n      since there is no knife that’s ever been introduced into\n      evidence.\n\n      For example, this (indicating).      I think it would be\n      misleading to the jury that that’s the way the knife looked,\n      when there’s no evidence in any way that there’s - - a knife\n      like that was ever used.\n\n\n33On appeal, Appellant refers to State’s Exhibit #205. This exhibit is a penitentiary\npack. (SX205). The State believes Appellant is actually referring to State’s Exhibit\n#206, which includes photographs from Mildred’s autopsy along with a silhouette of\na single edge blade. (SX206).\n                                        241\n\f(RR61:11). The State responded that it was offering the exhibit purely\n\nas a demonstrative aid. (RR61:11). “The purpose of this picture is to\n\nshow there’s a sharp edge and dull edge and how a knife like that might\n\nbe - - is consistent with causing a wound like we see in State’s Exhibit\n\nNumber 63[.]” (RR61:11). The photograph will “show the jury why it is\n\nthat this medical examiner will give the opinion that this is consistent\n\nwith a single-edge knife.”     (RR61:12).   The trial court overruled\n\nAppellant’s objection.    (RR61:12).    The exhibit was subsequently\n\nadmitted and utilized by him to explain his autopsy findings.\n\n       In particular, Dr. McDonough testified that Mildred “had\n\nextensive sharp-force trauma over almost all the surfaces of her body.”\n\n(RR61:54).    He explained that as part of an autopsy, the medical\n\nexaminer examines sharp-force wounds in an effort to determine “what\n\nthe weapon might be, possibly the length of the weapon, the width of\n\nthe blade[.]” (RR61:56-57). The examiner looks at the features of the\n\nwound, including the edges, where “[t]here might be a sharp edge and\n\nblunt edge.” (RR61:56).    The features of the wound may suggest the\n\ntype of knife used. (RR61:56, 60-61).

As an initial matter, the silhouette of the knife was properly\n\nidentified. Torres, 116 S.W.3d at 213. Dr. McDonough agreed that the\n\nslide entitled “Stab Wound – Single Edge Blade Characteristics”\n\ncontained a diagram of a knife. (RR61:57).       As to the slide entitled\n\n“Stab Wound Depth Analysis,” he agreed that it explained “different\n\ndepths wounds [sic]” that a single knife may create. (RR61:60).\n\n        The silhouette of the knife was relevant as it helped the medical\n\nexaminer to explain the nature and cause of the injuries that resulted\n\nin Mildred’s death.    The silhouette assisted the jury in understanding\n\nDr. McDonough’s testimony regarding Mildred’s wounds.         Contrary to\n\nthe statements in Appellant’s brief, the silhouette was not speculative.\n\nThe silhouette on Slide 2 depicted a single-edged knife, the same type of\n\nknife   that   Dr.   McDonough believed caused Mildred’s wounds.\n\n(RR61:57-58). The silhouette on Slide 5 showed that a single knife may\n\ncause wounds of different depths. (RR61:60).\n\n\n                                    244\n\f       Importantly, the State did not present the silhouette of the knife\n\nas an image of the weapon that was actually used in the instant offense.\n\nIndeed, the State clarified with Dr. McDonough the fact that he had\n\nnever “seen a knife [and had] never been presented a knife to examine”\n\nin connection with Mildred’s autopsy. (RR61:57). On cross-examination,\n\nDr. McDonough agreed that although he had testified to what the knife\n\nmay look like, he could not testify to a scientific certainty what the knife\n\nlooked like or how long it was. (RR61:90-91). See Simmons, 622 S.W.2d\n\nat 113-14 (finding no abuse of discretion in overruling Simmons’\n\nobjection to the State’s display to the jury of a “similar-type [of] knife”\n\nas that used during the commission of the offense).\n\n     On appeal, Appellant argues that the silhouette of the knife was\n\nalso inadmissible under Rule 403. (Appellant’s Brief pp.122-23). He did\n\nnot object on this basis at trial; he only objected on the basis of\n\nspeculation. (RR61:11). As such, Appellant failed to preserve his Rule\n\n403 objection for this Court’s review. See Guevara, 97 S.W.3d at 583.\n\n       Regardless, the probative value of the silhouette was not\n\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. See Tex. R.\n\nEvid. 403. As stated, the silhouette was probative of the nature of the\n\n\n                                    245\n\fweapon used to inflict Mildred’s fatal injuries. The silhouette was used\n\nto demonstrate the type of blade that may have inflicted Mildred’s\n\nwounds and to demonstrate how a single blade could create different\n\nwounds of varying depth.      The potential for the silhouette to impress\n\nthe jury in an irrational way was low given Dr. McDonough’s\n\nacknowledgement that he was never presented with a particular knife\n\nto examine or compare with Mildred’s wounds and that he could not\n\ntestify to a scientific certainty what the murder weapon actually looked\n\nlike.   At a minimum, the trial court’s decision falls within the zone of\n\nreasonable disagreement. See Weatherred, 15 S.W.3d at 542.\n\n        Even if this Court finds that the trial court erred in allowing the\n\nState to use the silhouette as a demonstrative aid, any alleged error is\n\nharmless as it did not have a substantial and injurious effect or\n\ninfluence on the jury.    The complained-of exhibit was offered during\n\ntestimony by the medical examiner during the punishment phase of\n\ntrial. The fact that Appellant stabbed Mildred to death was previously\n\ndetermined by another jury. Dr. McDonough simply described for the\n\nnew jury Mildred’s cause of death and the nature and extent of her\n\ninjuries.   The complained-of silhouette was used during his testimony\n\n\n                                    246\n\fsimply to help the jury understand the type of weapon that caused her\n\nwounds. There was no attempt to mislead the jury to believe that the\n\nsilhouette was an exact replica of the actual murder weapon. And there\n\nwas no dispute that a sharp, blade-like object was used or the lethal\n\nnature of the wounds it inflicted.      Accordingly, the silhouette of the\n\nknife did not affect Appellant’s substantial rights. See Tex. R. App. P.\n\n44.2(b).\n\n       Issue 44 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE 45: THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY ADMITTED\nTHE AUTOPSY PHOTOGRAPHS. ALTERNATIVELY, ANY ERROR IS HARMLESS.\n\n\n       Appellant contends that the trial court should have excluded all\n\nof the autopsy photographs offered by the State under evidence rule\n\n403. Appellant’s contention appears to be that the probative value of\n\nthe photographs was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n\nAppellant’s contentions lack merit.\n\n                           Pertinent Facts\n\n       In a sub rosa hearing, Appellant objected under Rule 403 to\n\nautopsy photographs of Mildred and Fred “being shown to the jury.”\n\n(RR61:8-9).   The color photographs were the exact photographs\n\nadmitted in the guilt phase of Appellant’s prior 1986 trial. The trial\n                                      247\n\fcourt had rejected a rule 403 objection to their admission back then,\n\nfinding that the probative value was not outweighed by the danger of\n\nany unfair prejudice. (RR61:9).       The State re-offered all twenty-four\n\npreviously admitted autopsy photographs - - fourteen from Mildred’s\n\nautopsy and ten from Fred’s autopsy.           (RR61:9-10).   The prosecutor\n\nstated:\n\n     They are grouped in a manner that is consistent with their\n     grouping of the injuries that show the injuries, the knife\n     wounds, the point of entry, why those points of entry can be\n     seen as being consistent with a single-edge knife. [The\n     medical examiner] will talk about the location of those\n     injuries and how - - especially with Mildred - - those might\n     relate to the fractured ribs that she sustained.\n\n          ...\n\n     There’s probably, I think, 25 [sic] pictures. But that’s\n     because there were a lot of stab wounds that were inflicted\n     upon these two folks.\n\n(RR61:10). Importantly, the 24 photographs offered were only “a small\n\n- - a portion of the total pictures that were taken.” (RR61:11).\n\n          Appellant’s   objection   was     overruled.   (RR61:11).     The\n\nphotographs were admitted during Dr. McDonough’s testimony.\n\n(RR61:48-49).\n\n\n                                      248\n\f                                 Analysis\n\n          The trial court did not err in admitting the 24 autopsy\n\nphotographs over Appellant’s 403 objection.     All 24 photographs were\n\nhighly probative of Mildred and Fred’s injuries; they show the external\n\ninjuries - - stab wounds, cuts, contusions - - that Mildred and Fred\n\nsuffered as a result of the instant offense. The photographs were used\n\nby Dr. McDonough to explain those injuries. (RR61:57, 61-65, 67-74,\n\n78-83).     This Court has held that a trial court does not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in admitting autopsy photographs over a Rule 403 objection\n\nwhere they help to explain the medical examiner’s testimony describing\n\nthe victim’s various wounds for which appellant is responsible.     See\n\nEscamilla, 143 S.W.3d at 826. Given the nature and extent of Mildred\n\nand Fred’s injuries – the sheer volume of stab wounds – the\n\nphotographs were especially important to help the jury understand the\n\nbrutal nature of the offense.\n\n          Furthermore, the 24 complained-of photographs are not unfairly\n\nprejudicial under Rule 403. The photographs are not repetitious; each\n\ndepicts a different area of injury:\n\n\n\n\n                                      249\n\f State’s Exhibit #76, the autopsy identification\n  photograph, is a close up of Mildred’s face.\n  (RR61:63-64; SX76).\n\n State’s Exhibit #79 is a close-up of a large cut to\n  Mildred’s scalp.

The\n\nphotographs are gruesome, but they depict nothing more than the\n\ninjuries that Appellant inflicted on Mildred and Fred.        See Ladd, 3\n\nS.W.3d at 568 (holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin admitting photographs of the victim’s body, including autopsy photos,\n\nbecause the photographs depicted the manner of death and were no\n\nmore gruesome than the crime). Notably, Dr. McDonough’s testimony\n\nregarding the photographs consisted of only twenty pages in an\n\notherwise extremely lengthy record. (RR61:57, 61-65, 67-74, 78-83).\n\n      The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted the\n\n24 autopsy photographs.

Even\n\nwithout the photographs, the jury heard evidence that Mildred was\n\nstabbed 90 times. The jury heard evidence of Appellant’s history of\n\nviolence both in and out of prison. Accordingly, taking the entire record\n\ninto consideration, it is clear that any alleged error in admitting the\n\ncomplained-of photographs clearly did not affect Appellant’s substantial\n\nrights and should be disregarded.

He claims\n\nBelt’s testimony was not admissible as victim impact testimony.\n\nFurthermore, he claims under Rule 403 that any probative value it had\n\nwas outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Appellant preserved\n\nhis complaints at trial, but the court acted within its discretion in\n\noverruling them.\n\n\n\n\n                                     254\n\f                            Pertinent Facts\n\n       During it’s case-in-rebuttal, the State called Mildred and Fred’s\n\nson-in-law, James Belt, to testify. (RR68:212). Appellant objected that\n\nBelt was not Mildred and Fred’s child. (RR68:218). He objected to the\n\nfact that Belt would testify as to the effect of the offense on his wife,\n\nMildred and Fred’s daughter, Molly, as well as Mildred and Fred’s\n\ngrandchildren, Melanie and James III.         (RR68:212-13, 216).     He\n\nobjected that the defense would not be able to cross-examine Molly.\n\n(RR68:212-13, 216).     Appellant also objected to the testimony under\n\nRule 403. (RR68:214).\n\n       Before the jury, Belt testified that he is married to Mildred and\n\nFred’s only child, Molly.   (RR68:220-21).    Belt and Molly have two\n\nchildren, Melanie and James III.     (RR68:226).   Fred and Belt, both\n\nlawyers, shared an office close to Rose Lane. (RR68:229). Belt testified\n\nthat Fred was more than just a father-in-law; “he was everything to\n\n[Belt].” (RR68:235). Belt had a great deal of respect and admiration for\n\nMildred. (RR68:235).\n\n       Belt testified that even though decades have passed since the\n\noffense, “It comes back. [He] can’t shake it . . . It’s got [him] messed\n\n\n                                   255\n\fup.”   (RR68:236).    After the offense, Molly had to take a leave of\n\nabsence from work for a year. (RR68:237).       “Initially, she had anxiety\n\nattacks. She couldn’t really do anything. But, as time passes, she’s\n\ngotten a lot better . . . But she’s not whole.” (RR68:237).    The offense\n\naffected Melanie as well. Melanie “has never been able to stay in a\n\nhouse by herself.” (RR68:237). Melanie could not be left alone when\n\nshe was a child or after she left home to go off to college.

See Estrada, 313 S.W.3d 315-16 (quoting Salazar, 90\n\nS.W.3d at 336).    Considerations in determining whether testimony\n\n\n                                   257\n\fshould be excluded under rule 403 include the nature of the testimony,\n\nthe relationship between the witness and the victim, the amount of\n\ntestimony to be introduced, and the availability of other testimony\n\nrelating to victim impact and character. See Mosley, 983 S.W.2d at 262.\n\n                               Analysis\n\n       It is the State’s position that Appellant has failed to properly\n\nbrief his complaint regarding the testimony of James Belt. Importantly,\n\nhe does not provide citations to the portion(s) of the record of Belt’s\n\ntestimony that he claims is inadmissible. See Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(i).\n\nThe State notes that Belt offered more than simply victim-impact\n\ntestimony. Belt was also a fact witness; he was the person who found\n\nMildred’s and Fred’s dead bodies. (RR68:228-29).\n\n       In any event, the trial court did not err in allowing Belt to\n\nprovide victim-impact testimony.     Belt’s testimony was relevant and\n\nprobative evidence that humanized Mildred and Fred.         Mosley, 983\n\nS.W.2d at 262. Belt provided a brief description for the jury of who this\n\nmarried couple was and the impact of the murders on their family.\n\nThere was nothing in Belt’s testimony that encouraged a comparison\n\nbetween Mildred and Fred and Appellant. As such, the trial court acted\n\n\n                                   258\n\fwithin its discretion in allowing Belt’s testimony during the State’s\n\ncase-in-rebuttal.\n\n       That Belt was Mildred and Fred’s son-in-law did not render\n\nBelt’s testimony inadmissible. See Mosley, 983 S.W.2d at 262 (stating,\n\n“[W]e do not believe that an absolute rule limiting testimony to family\n\nmembers within a certain degree of relationship is viable.”).    Although\n\nBelt was not Mildred and Fred’s son by birth, he was their son-in-law\n\nand the father of their grandchildren. It is clear from Belt’s testimony\n\nthat he enjoyed an extremely close relationship with Mildred and Fred,\n\nboth personally and (as to Fred) professionally.\n\n       In his brief, Appellant argues that Belt’s testimony was\n\nimproper, extraneous victim testimony because it pertained to a victim\n\nnot named in the indictment. (Appellant’s Brief pp.127-28). Mildred is\n\nthe only complainant listed in the instant indictment, not Fred.\n\n(CR:206).   Appellant did not object on this basis at trial, therefore this\n\nclaim is not preserved for review. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1. Regardless,\n\nAppellant is incorrect.   Belt’s testimony regarding the impact of the\n\noffense, that he “can’t shake it” and that it “[had him] messed up”\n\npertains to Mildred’s murder. Mildred and Fred were killed during the\n\n\n                                    259\n\fsame transaction. Because his testimony pertains to the victim named\n\nin the indictment, it was not improper.\n\n       Appellant complained at trial and in his brief on appeal that\n\nbecause Belt was allowed to testify as to the effect of the offense on\n\nMolly, he was denied the right to cross-examine her. At trial, the State\n\nasked only two questions of Belt regarding the effect of the offense on\n\nMolly. (RR68:236-37).     And, Appellant made no attempt to cross-\n\nexamine him. (RR68:239).\n\n       Even if this Court finds that the trial court erred in admitting\n\nBelt’s victim-impact testimony (which the State does not concede), any\n\nalleged error is harmless. See Tex. R. Evid. 103; Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b).\n\nBelt’s testimony about the impact of the offense on him and his family\n\nwas brief. And, he was the only witness to give this type of testimony.\n\nIndeed, the State was judicious and presented only one witness – Belt –\n\nto testify regarding the impact of the brutal murder of a highly\n\nrespected couple in the Dallas community.        Belt’s testimony did not\n\naffect Appellant’s substantial rights. See Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b).\n\n       Issue 46 should be overruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                    260\n\fSTATE’S   RESPONSE     TO    ISSUE   NOS.   47-48:   APPELLANT    IS   NOT\nINTELLECTUALLY DISABLED.\n\n\n       In Issue 47, Appellant contends that the jury’s response to the\n\nintellectual disability special issue is against the great weight and\n\npreponderance of the evidence. In Issue 48, Appellant contends that the\n\nevidence was sufficient to show that Appellant is intellectually disabled.\n\nAppellant’s contentions lack merit.\n\n                            Standard of Review\n\n       This Court has characterized the issue of intellectual disability\n\nas an affirmative defense. Neal v.

App. 2008). When a defendant asserts this affirmative defense at\n\ntrial, he bears the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence\n\nthat he is intellectually disabled. Id. In reviewing the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence to support the jury’s finding that Appellant was not\n\nintellectually disabled, the appellate court considers whether the\n\nfinding is so against the great weight and preponderance of the\n\nevidence as to be manifestly unjust. Id. The jury’s decision is entitled\n\nto great deference as it is in the best position to assess the witnesses’\n\ncredibility and resolve any conflicts in the evidence. Id.\n\n\n\n                                      261\n\f                      Alternate Standard of Review\n\n       In two issues, Appellant contends that the evidence presented at\n\ntrial established that he was intellectually disabled. The State\n\nunderstands Issue 47 to be that the jury’s response to the intellectual\n\ndisability special issue is against the great weight and preponderance of\n\nthe evidence and Issue 48 to be that the evidence was sufficient to show\n\nthat Appellant is intellectually disabled.       It is unclear whether\n\nAppellant is suggesting that there are two standards of review in\n\nconnection with the jury’s response to the intellectual disability issue.\n\nAs stated above, the standard of review in connection with the jury’s\n\nfinding on the intellectual disability special issue is whether the finding\n\nis so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to\n\nbe manifestly unjust.    Neal, 256 S.W.3d at 273.      Appellant cites no\n\nauthority to the contrary.\n\n                             Applicable Law\n\n     A defendant is intellectually disabled and, thus, exempt from the\n\ndeath penalty if he has (1) significant sub-average general intellectual\n\nfunctioning, usually evidenced by an intelligence quotient (IQ) score\n\nbelow 70, that is accompanied by, (2) related limitations in adaptive\n\n\n                                    262\n\ffunctioning, (3) before the age of 18.

The record supports the jury’s decision to\n\nanswer the first special issue “no.”\n\n                                 Appellant’s IQ\n\n     General intellectual functioning refers to an IQ which is obtained\n\nby   assessment      with   a    standardized,    individually   administered\n\nintelligence test.   See Moore, 470 S.W.3d at 487 (citing Hearn, 310\n\nS.W.3d at 428 n.7). Sub-average general intellectual functioning refers\n\nto an individual’s “measured intelligence on standardized psychometric\n\ninstruments of two or more standard deviations below the age-group\n\nmean for the tests used.” Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. §591.003(20)\n\n(West Supp. 2015).      “[T]he MR or Intellectual Disability category is\n\napproximately two standard deviations below the average, about an IQ\n\nscore of 70.” Cathey, 451 S.W.3d at 14.\n\n\n\n\n                                       264\n\f         Appellant presented evidence of two IQ scores:                   77 and 71.\n\n(RR65:118; RR66:23). Dr. Hom administered the Wechsler Adult\n\nIntelligence Test (WAIS-II) in 1987. (RR65:110, 115). On this test,\n\nAppellant’s full-scale IQ was 77. (RR65:118).\n\n         In 2012, Dr. McGarrahan administered the WAIS-IV and\n\nAppellant scored a 71.34 (RR66:16, 23, 29; SX248). Appellant’s “full-\n\nscale IQ was 71, which is in the - - what we used to call ‘mildly mentally\n\nretarded’ range to borderline functioning[.]” (RR66:23). Given that the\n\nstandard error of measurement is “essentially plus or minus five\n\npoints,” Appellant’s score falls in the range of 66-76. (RR66:29-30). Dr.\n\nMcGarrahan testified that Appellant’s IQ score was two standard\n\ndeviations below the norm. (RR66:9-10).\n\n         The State’s expert, Dr. Price, testified that Appellant’s 71 IQ score\n\nplaces him in “the borderline” range of mildly intellectually disabled.\n\n(RR69:78).        He testified, “you take into consideration the confidence\n\ninterval of the IQ score obtained and it includes, in this case, a score\n\nthat should be considered significantly sub-average.” (RR69:79). Dr.\n\n\n\n\n34   At the time of trial, the WAIS-IV was the current edition of this test. (RR69:24).\n                                            265\n\fPrice testified that Appellant meets the first prong of the intellectual\n\ndisability analysis. (RR69:79).\n\n     Taking into consideration the SEM associated with Appellant’s\n\n2012 71-IQ-score, the State agrees with Appellant that the evidence\n\nsubstantiates a finding that he meets the first prong of the intellectual\n\ndisability analysis.\n\n                             Adaptive Behavior\n\n       Even though Appellant’s 2012 IQ score meets the first prong of\n\nthe AAMR definition for intellectual disability, his IQ score alone does\n\nnot justify his classification as intellectually disabled.    See Ex parte\n\nTennard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2427846\"><a href=\"/opinion/2427846/ex-parte-tennard/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 60-61 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997) (IQ scores should\n\nnot be used as a “unitary measure of mental retardation”). The score\n\nmust be accompanied by deficits in adaptive behavior. Briseno, 135\n\nS.W.3d at 7. Adaptive behavior is defined as “the effectiveness with or\n\ndegree to which a person meets the standards of personal independence\n\nand social responsibility expected of the person’s age and cultural\n\ngroup.” Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 591.003(1) (West Supp. 2015).\n\n“Impairments     in    adaptive   behavior   are   defined   as   significant\n\nlimitations in an individual's effectiveness in meeting the standards of\n\n\n                                     266\n\fmaturation,    learning,   personal       independence,   and/or   social\n\nresponsibility that are expected for his or her age level and cultural\n\ngroup, as determined by clinical assessment and, usually, standardized\n\nscales.” Briseno, 135 S.W.3d at 7 n.25.\n\n                            Expert Opinion\n\n       Dr. McGarrahan testified that Appellant’s adaptive deficits\n\n“include his academic functioning, his ability to socialize and be in the\n\ncommunity and live independently and take care of himself.”\n\n(RR66:24).    According to Dr. McGarrahan, Appellant could not make\n\nchange; had problems in school; did not learn how to drive; had\n\ndifficulty using a telephone and a telephone book; was a loner; had no\n\nfriends; had trouble getting along with people; and, experienced a head\n\ninjury at the age of 15. (RR66:25-26).\n\n       Dr. Price testified that he did not see significant limitations in\n\nAppellant’s adaptive behaviors. (RR69:38).       According to Dr. Price,\n\nthere was evidence that Appellant “had many different jobs in the time\n\nafter he was 17, in the free world.” (RR69:39). In addition, Appellant\n\nwas not incapable of graduating from high school. (RR69:39). Indeed,\n\nDr. Price did not believe that Appellant’s poor performance in school\n\n\n                                   267\n\fwas related to his intellectual functioning. (RR69:40). That Appellant\n\nwas picked on as a child and was a loner was not evidence of significant\n\nlimitations in adaptive behavior.     (RR69:41).   Some of the evidence\n\nshowed that he would not stand up for himself but other evidence\n\nshowed that he would. (RR69:41-42). Furthermore, Appellant was not\n\na complete loner; he had girlfriends and was close to some family\n\nmembers. (RR69:42). Importantly, when Appellant was younger, he\n\nwas not treated by everyone as if he was intellectually disabled.\n\n(RR69:44).\n\n       Dr. Price testified that Appellant has the ability to “formulate a\n\nplan to behave in a certain way, to get the effect or to achieve the\n\nconsequence that he was after.” (RR69:44-45). He also has the ability\n\nto lie in order to avoid criminal responsibility. (RR69:46). Dr. Price\n\ntestified that it appeared that the lying started with the Linwood\n\nincident. (RR69:46). Appellant “comes up with excuses, self-defense\n\nargument, denies that he committed this offense in the way in which\n\nthe evidence was presented to the jury, telling the investigator one\n\nthing and also telling her at the same time to not put that in the\n\nrecord.”   (RR69:46).   Appellant’s testimony in connection with the\n\n\n                                    268\n\fLinwood offense was significant to Dr. Price and “was very inconsistent\n\nwith a person with mental retardation[.]”        (RR69:58).   Dr. Price\n\ntestified:\n\n      Well, it speaks to the area of communication as adaptive\n      behavior, as well as the social problem-solving area. He\n      testified. He was cross examined. He responded to the\n      questions in a responsive fashion, on point. He understood\n      the questions. He had an answer that was in his own self-\n      interest, whether or not it was accurate or not.\n\n      It also showed a denial of responsibility for the act and a\n      memorization of the conduct. But he was able to, if you will,\n      hold his own on the witness stand under cross examination.\n      Something that can be difficult to do.\n\n(RR69:48).\n\n        Dr. Price also reviewed 24 of Appellant’s 90-day mental status\n\nexaminations from 2002 to 2010. (RR69:51).       “[W]ith very, very few\n\nexceptions, his mental status examines [sic] for those eight years . . .\n\nwere entirely normal.” (RR69:52). There was no evidence of psychosis,\n\nhearing voices, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia.     (RR69:52).    No\n\nmental health medications were administered. (RR69:52). There were\n\nno complaints of unusual behaviors. (RR69:53).\n\n\n\n\n                                   269\n\f                            Other Evidence\n\n       The record reflects that, from a young age, Appellant was an\n\nindividual fully capable of caring for himself and carrying out everyday\n\nactivities whether at home, on the streets, or while incarcerated.\n\nAppellant, also known by his nickname, “Clean,” liked clothes and liked\n\nto dress well. (RR62:19-20, 46, 54, 100, 111; RR66:79). Although he did\n\nnot have a driver’s license, he got around by driving Lonnie’s car,\n\nwalking, or having friends pick him up. (RR62:62-63, 117, 131).\n\n       Contrary to Dr. McGarrahan’s testimony that Appellant was a\n\nloner, didn’t have any friends, and did not know how to get along with\n\nothers, multiple witnesses testified that Appellant had relationships\n\nwith family, friends, and even had a girlfriend. (RR62:65, 131; RR66:25,\n\n131, 71, 96-97). Indeed, from a young age, Appellant maintained close\n\nrelationships with multiple family members, including his brother\n\nLonnie and sister Shirley as well as his cousins Bobby Charles and\n\nThomas, Anthony, and Cynthia Penagraph. (RR62:53, 100; RR65:49-\n\n50, 61; RR66:71). Thomas testified that he and Appellant were “just\n\nlike two peas in a pot (sic).” (RR62:65). They were “[r]eally close.”\n\n(RR62:65). Anthony testified that he and Appellant went everywhere\n\n\n                                  270\n\ftogether. (RR65:51). More recently, Appellant reconnected with his\n\nhalf-brother Rodney Turner. (RR66:96). The men became pen pals,\n\nencouraging each other through their letters. (RR66:97). Appellant’s\n\nletters included citations to Scripture. (RR66:106).\n\n       Growing up, Appellant’s cousins Anthony and Cynthia believed\n\nthat Appellant was slow but Lonnie, Thomas, and Delores Easter did\n\nnot. (RR62:26, 53, 100; RR65:49; RR66:130). Indeed, Lonnie thought\n\nAppellant was intelligent; Appellant could read and hold a conversation\n\nwith him and even helped him with his homework. (RR62:100-01, 118).\n\nEaster described Appellant as “very bright.” (RR62:26).\n\n       There is no evidence that Appellant was ever placed in special\n\neducation classes through DISD.          (RR68:207).   Appellant’s school\n\nrecords reflect that although he performed poorly in middle school, he\n\nimproved by his sophomore year of high school when he started\n\nattending Metro North. (RR68:203-04).        Notably, Appellant’s move to\n\nMetro North did not occur until after his head injury at Fair Park.\n\n(RR68:210). Dr. Price testified that based on the records, Appellant’s\n\nscores on the Iowa and California tests, and his performance at Metro\n\nNorth, Appellant was “not incapable” of graduating.       (RR69:40). See\n\n\n                                   271\n\fCathey, 451 S.W.3d at 64 (noting that “[t]he best source of retrospective\n\ninformation concerning adaptive behavior during the developmental\n\nperiod is usually school records.”).\n\n       Appellant presented evidence of the head injury at Fair Park.35\n\nThe evidence reflects, however, that he testified at the trial in\n\nconnection with the Linwood offense three years after the injury.\n\n(RR69:48). Dr. Price testified that Appellant’s testimony at that trial\n\nwas “very inconsistent with a person with mental retardation[.]”\n\n(RR69:48). Similarly, when he was interviewed by Cindy Kuykendall\n\nafter the instant offense, Appellant responded to questions, answered\n\nquestions   in   his   own   interest,       and   “provided   alibis,   excuses,\n\nrationalizations, [and] denials.” (RR69:49).\n\n       Appellant grew up in an area where fighting was common.\n\n(RR62:55-56, 110). While it is true that Appellant would get picked on,\n\ntwo of his cousins testified that if Appellant had to defend himself, he\n\nwould. (RR62:55, 107; RR65:47-48, 56; RR66:84). He even defended\n\nLonnie on more than one occasion. (RR62:108). Dr. Price testified that\n\nwhether one is picked on is not, by itself, evidence of intellectual\n\n35The State introduced a copy of Appellant’s medical records from Parkland\nHospital. The records contain no mention of the head injury. (RR69:57; SX249).\n                                       272\n\fdisability. (RR69:41).   Instead, it is the response to being picked on\n\nthat should be considered. (RR69:41).\n\n       Although Appellant had “very few jobs over his life[,]” there was\n\nevidence of some work experience. (RR66:18). Appellant worked as a\n\njanitor with his mother at Fair Park. (RR62:114). He worked on trucks\n\nwith Rice’s brother, Anthony. (RR66:126, 136). He worked at the Adel\n\nHunt Furniture Company. (RR66:56). In 1984, however, while he was\n\nout of prison on parole, he did not maintain stable employment.\n\n(RR63:192-93).\n\n       Appellant has a history of lying and manipulative behavior.\n\nWhen interviewed by police in connection with the Linwood incident, he\n\ntold the detective that he intended to kill Linwood when he stabbed\n\nhim, but then he told her not to include that detail in the report.\n\n(RR66:46-48). When he testified at trial, he claimed that he did not\n\nintend to kill Linwood; he just wanted to “scratch” Linwood to get him\n\nto leave him alone. (RR66:46-47).\n\n       In 1983, while in prison, Appellant was aggressive and tried to\n\nextort his then-cellmate Ferguson.        (RR63:137-39).   He manipulated\n\nanother inmate, Turner, into doing his laundry and doing “sexual stuff\n\n\n                                    273\n\ffor him[.]” (RR63:167-68).    A 2010 inventory of Appellant’s cell turned\n\nup two razor blades secreted in a book. (RR65:21-22; SX230). He also\n\nhad a diagram showing how to alter a radio to create a communication\n\ndevice. (RR65:17; SX232).\n\n        In prison, Appellant manages his time and health. He spends\n\nhis time reading.    One detention officer testified that Appellant is\n\nalways reading or sleeping. (RR67:41). He reads “novels off the law\n\nlibrary cart.” (RR67:45).    An inventory of his cell revealed eight books,\n\na dictionary, and a Bible. (RR65:12, 13, 14, 28-29; SX231, 236-42). He\n\nalso had a capital defense periodical that contained markings on\n\npassages concerning confidentiality and strategy. (RR65:24-28; SX233).\n\nWhen he has recreation time at the gym, Appellant walks or plays\n\nbasketball.   (RR67:42).    In the event that Appellant needs to see a\n\ndoctor, he is able to take the steps necessary to do so. (RR69:45).\n\n       In 2006, Appellant took an “Adaptive Behavior Screening Test.”\n\n(RR71:1212-13; SX251). He reported the following: prior to his arrest,\n\nhe lived with his family (common law wife); he supported himself with a\n\njob; he had bills and he paid them; he got to where he needed to go by\n\ndriving himself; he cooked what he ate; when he needed to go to the\n\n\n                                    274\n\fdoctor, his family made an appointment; he looked at an analog clock\n\nand correctly stated the time within 5 minutes; he washed his clothes\n\nhimself; and he reported that, to bake cornbread or a cake or biscuits,\n\nthe oven should be set to 300°-400°.     (RR71:1212-13; SX251).       He\n\nanswered one question incorrectly: “If cigarettes cost $4.35 and you\n\ngave the clerk a $5.00 bill, how much change should you get back?”\n\n(RR71:1213; SX251). Appellant answered “Any other [number]” instead\n\nof “$0.65.” (RR71:1213; SX251).\n\n       The commission of the instant offense demonstrates considerable\n\nforethought and planning. Through trial-and-error, Appellant figured\n\nout how to get inside the Finch home. Once inside, he overpowered not\n\njust one person, but two. After he brutally stabbed and killed Mildred\n\nand Fred, he selected and organized the property that he wanted to\n\ntake and then figured out how to transport it from the Finch home to\n\nhis own. Once at home, he concocted a story to explain the blood on his\n\nclothing and the source of all of the bags and boxes of clothing and\n\nassorted property. Later, he disposed of his bloody clothes and the knife\n\nhe used to kill Mildred and Fred. During an interview with the media\n\nafter the offense, Appellant told a reporter that he got the blood on his\n\n\n                                   275\n\fshoes from a dog that he had hit with a stick. (RR66:50). And, he gave\n\nan alibi for the day after the murders. (RR66:52-53).\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       A significant impairment in adaptive behavior may be thought of\n\nas the extent to which an individual requires assistance to carry\n\nout age-appropriate activities. See Cathey, 451 S.W.3d at 23. Given all\n\nof the foregoing, it is clear that before and after he turned 18, Appellant\n\nwas fully capable of carrying out age-appropriate activities. The jury\n\ncould have reasonably determined that any deficits Appellant had in\n\nadaptive behavior were not within the range of intellectual disability.\n\n                             Onset before 18\n\n     Appellant failed to prove an IQ below 70 and deficiencies in\n\nadaptive behavior prior to the age of 18. First of all, both of Appellant’s\n\nIQ tests were taken after his 18th birthday. When Appellant was tested\n\nby Dr. Hom in 1987, he was 26. (DX7). When he was tested by Dr.\n\nMcGarrahan in 2012, he was 51. (SX248). The only evidence of an IQ\n\ntest taken during the developmental period was the California Test of\n\nMental Maturity taken when Appellant was in second grade.\n\n(RR68:200). On this test, Appellant scored an 82 total IQ. (RR68:198).\n\n\n                                    276\n\f     Next, the evidence of adaptive deficits was conflicting. Some\n\nfamily members thought Appellant was slow, but others thought he\n\nfunctioned well and was bright. Although Appellant performed poorly\n\nduring some school years, his performance was better in others. There\n\nwas evidence that he worked with his mother. There was evidence that\n\nhe was bullied in the neighborhood, but there was also evidence that he\n\nstood up for himself. Appellant failed to prove that he is intellectually\n\ndisabled, much less that the onset occurred during the developmental\n\nperiod. See Cathey, 451 S.W.3d at 28 (stating that “If applicant has\n\nfailed to prove that he is intellectually disabled, he clearly did not prove\n\nthat he was intellectually disabled before the age of approximately\n\neighteen.”).\n\n                                Conclusion\n\n       Given the foregoing, it is clear that the jury’s answer to the\n\nintellectual disability special issue was not so against the great weight\n\nand preponderance of the evidence so as to be manifestly unjust. Neal,\n\n256 S.W.3d at 273.\n\n       Issues 47 and 48 should be overruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                    277\n\fSTATE’S   RESPONSE TO ISSUE NO.           49:   THE EVIDENCE IS LEGALLY\nSUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THE JURY’S FINDING THAT APPELLANT IS A\nFUTURE DANGER.\n\n\n       In Issue 49, Appellant contends that the evidence is legally\n\ninsufficient to support the jury’s finding that there is a probability that\n\nhe will commit criminal acts of violence in the future.        Appellant’s\n\ncontention lacks merit.\n\n                            Applicable Law\n\n     The State has the burden of proving the future dangerousness\n\nissue beyond a reasonable doubt. Tex.

A jury may\n\nconsider a variety of factors when determining whether a defendant will\n\npose a continuing threat to society: the circumstances of the offense,\n\nthe defendant’s state of mind, whether he was working alone or with\n\nother parties, the calculated nature of his acts, the forethought and\n\ndeliberation exhibited by the crime’s execution, the existence of a prior\n\ncriminal record, the defendant’s age and personal circumstances at the\n\ntime of the offense, whether the defendant was acting under duress or\n\nthe domination of another at the time of the offense, psychiatric\n\nevidence, and character evidence.

In reviewing the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence, the appellate court views all of the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the jury’s finding and determines whether, based on that\n\nevidence and reasonable inferences therefrom, a rational jury could\n\nhave found beyond a reasonable doubt that the answer to the future-\n\ndangerousness issue was “yes.” Id. at 730.\n\n                                Analysis\n\n       The State’s evidence unquestionably demonstrates Appellant’s\n\npropensity for violence. Indeed, the facts of the offense, standing alone,\n\nare sufficient to support a finding of future dangerousness. Appellant\n\nbroke into a home and brutally stabbed two people to death.           “[A]\n\nstabbing death is particularly brutal.” King v.

The State presented the following additional evidence of\n\nAppellant’s history of violence which proves that he is a future danger:\n\n   In 1979, Appellant stabbed Linwood in the head with a\n    screwdriver causing permanent brain damage. (RR63:72,\n    84). Appellant told the detective that he was trying to kill\n    Linwood.\n\n   On the same day as the Linwood incident, Appellant got\n    into a fight with his brother Billy, during which he cut Billy\n    and Billy’s friend. (RR63:111-12).\n\n   Later that night, upset when an ex-girlfriend would not let\n    him inside her house, Appellant broke her window.\n    (RR63:102-03).\n\n   In January 1983, Appellant “started coming on” to his\n    cellmate, Ferguson. (RR63:136, 138-39).\n\n   In June 1983, Appellant was seen “raping another inmate.”\n    (RR63:151).\n\n\n                                   280\n\f   On the day after the rape, Appellant tried to force another\n    inmate, McCarroll, to “suck his dick.” (RR63:154). When\n    the inmate refused, Appellant broke the inmate’s nose and\n    gave him two black eyes. (RR63:154).\n\n   In August 1983, Appellant manipulated another inmate,\n    Turner, into washing his clothes and “do[ing] sexual stuff\n    for him[.]” (RR63:168). Appellant also made Turner have\n    sex with other inmates. (RR63:169).\n\n   While in jail, Appellant was moved multiple times for a\n    variety of reasons. He had to be placed in administrative\n    custody; he assaulted other inmates; he caused trouble in\n    the tank; he fought; he made sexual threats; and he could\n    not get along with others. (RR63:182; SX228).\n\n   While in prison, Appellant flooded his cell twice; used\n    indecent or vulgar language; threw his tray out of his cell;\n    threatened an officer twice; refused to obey an order\n    multiple times; got into a fistfight with another inmate;\n    threw two glasses of water at an officer, striking him on the\n    face and chest; and was found in possession of contraband\n    multiple times. (RR65:37-40; SX245).\n\n   In 1984, while on parole, Appellant failed to report and even\n    tried to stab his mother. (RR63:188-89).\n\n       Appellant argues that his good behavior while incarcerated on\n\ndeath row proves that he is not a future danger.     While good behavior\n\nin prison is a factor to consider, it does not preclude a finding of future\n\ndangerousness. Devoe, 354 S.W.3d at 468 (finding evidence sufficient to\n\n\n\n\n                                    281\n\fsupport jury’s finding of future dangerousness despite Devoe’s “pristine”\n\nbehavioral record while incarcerated).\n\n     Viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, the evidence is\n\nmore than sufficient to support the jury’s finding beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt that Appellant would constitute a continuing threat to society.\n\nThe evidence is sufficient to support the jury’s answer to the future\n\ndangerousness special issue.\n\n         Issue 49 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S   RESPONSE TO ISSUE     50:    THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR IN\nDENYING APPELLANT’S REQUESTED JURY INSTRUCTION.\n\n\n         Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his\n\nrequest to amend the jury instruction defining “significantly sub-\n\naverage general intellectual functioning.” Appellant’s contention lacks\n\nmerit.\n\n                             Pertinent Facts\n\n         The trial court’s charge to the jury defines “significantly sub-\n\naverage general intellectual functioning” as follows:\n\n     . . . refers to measured intelligence on standardized\n     psychometric instruments of approximately two or more\n     standard deviations below the group mean for the tests\n     used. Significantly subaverage intellectual functioning is\n\n                                      282\n\f     evidenced by an IQ score of approximately 70 or below. An\n     IQ score is not considered to be a fixed number. Instead a\n     score represents a range or an approximation of a person’s\n     IQ.\n\n(CR3:17).     Appellant requested that the following two sentences be\n\nadded to that definition:\n\n             IQ tests has [sic] a standard error of measurement\n              which is a reflection of the inherent imprecision of\n              the test itself.\n             An IQ score of 70 is considered to represent a band\n              or zone of a score of 65 to 75.\n\n(RR69:120). He argued that his additions would “fully develop and give\n\nan accurate definition of [the] terminology[.]” (RR69:120).   In support\n\nof his argument, Appellant called Dr. McGarrahan who testified that\n\nthe proposed instruction was important as it informs the jury that there\n\nis inherent error in the tests and that the “IQ itself is not a hard and\n\nfast number.” (RR69:122). The State then questioned Dr. McGarrahan\n\nas follows:\n\n     [State]: . . . Dr. McGarrahan, is the standard error of\n     measurement five points, plus or minus, for every IQ test?\n\n     [Dr. McGarrahan]: It is not. And that might not be exactly\n     accurate. The last part, to say a band zone or a score 65 to\n     75, it’s really not. It’s statistically based on each IQ score\n\n\n                                   283\n\f     and each IQ test. So we say approximately, plus or minus,\n     five points. But it’s not exact.\n\n     [State]: So some tests may have a standard error of\n     measurement of two-point something or three-point\n     something. It depends on the test that’s given, correct?\n\n     [Dr. McGarrahan]: It does. And it depends on - - like, we\n     have our verbal IQ or verbal comprehension versus our\n     performance reasoning, and those are different. Their\n     standard errors of measurement are different for each of\n     those.\n\n(RR69:123). The State opposed Appellant’s proffered additions as they\n\nwould constitute a comment on the weight of the evidence. (RR69:125).\n\nThe trial court denied Appellant’s request. (RR69:125).\n\n                           Applicable Law\n\n       The trial court has a duty to provide the jury with a written\n\ncharge, distinctly setting forth the law applicable to the case without\n\nexpressing any opinion as to the weight of the evidence, summing up\n\nthe testimony, discussing the facts, or using any argument that is\n\ncalculated to arouse the sympathy or excite the passions of the jury.\n\nSee Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 36.14 (West 2006).\n\n\n\n\n                                  284\n\f                                 Analysis\n\n       The trial court did not err in refusing Appellant’s request to\n\ninclude his two proffered sentences in the punishment charge.\n\nContrary to the statements in Appellant’s brief, the first sentence,\n\nwhich references the “standard error of measurement which is a\n\nreflection of the inherent imprecision of the test itself[,]” does not define\n\nsub-average general intellectual functioning.     Instead, it is a comment\n\non the weight of the evidence; it recites that IQ tests are inherently\n\nimprecise. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 36.14 (stating that the\n\ncourt’s charge shall not express any opinion as to the weight of the\n\nevidence). The trial court did not err in denying Appellant’s request to\n\ninclude this sentence in the charge.\n\n       The second sentence, which references the “band or zone of a\n\nscore of 65 to 75” is inaccurate.      Dr. McGarrahan testified that that\n\nsentence “might not be exactly accurate.” (RR69:123). She stated, “to\n\nsay a band zone or a score 65 to 75, it’s really not. It’s statistically\n\nbased on each IQ score and each IQ test. So we say approximately, plus\n\nor minus, five points.    But it’s not exact.”     (RR69:123).    Given Dr.\n\n\n\n\n                                     285\n\fMcGarrahan’s testimony, the trial did not err in denying Appellant’s\n\nrequest to include this sentence in the charge.\n\n          The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying\n\nAppellant’s requested instructions.       At a minimum, the ruling falls\n\nwithin the zone of reasonable disagreement. See Weatherred, 15 S.W.3d\n\nat 542.\n\n     Even if this Court finds that the trial court erred in denying\n\nAppellant’s requested instructions, which the State does not concede,\n\nAppellant has failed to show some harm. If there is error in the court’s\n\ncharge and that error was the subject of a timely objection in the trial\n\ncourt, reversal is required if the error is calculated to injure the rights\n\nof the defendant, which means only that there must be some harm as a\n\nresult of the error. See Almanza v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2373973\"><a href=\"/opinion/2373973/almanza-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">686</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 171 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1985) (op. on reh’g). Whether the defendant suffered actual\n\nharm is evaluated in light of the entire jury charge, the state of the\n\nevidence, counsel’s arguments, and any other relevant information in\n\nthe record. See id.\n\n\n     With regard to the first sentence, as previously argued, it was a\n\ncomment on weight of the evidence. Regardless, that IQ scores are not\n\n                                    286\n\ffixed numbers was already before the jury. Dr. McGarrahan testified\n\nregarding the standard error of measurement, as did Dr. Price.\n\n(RR66:29-30; RR69:33-34). Indeed, the fact that IQ scores do not\n\nrepresent fixed numbers was undisputed.       As to the second sentence,\n\nAppellant cannot show harm since Dr. McGarrahan herself testified\n\nthat it may not be an accurate statement. (RR69:123).\n\n     Issue 50 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S   RESPONSE TO ISSUE    51:    THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR IN\nDENYING APPELLANT’S REQUEST THAT THE JURY BE ALLOWED TO ENTER\nA NON-UNANIMOUS VERDICT REGARDING THE INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY\nSPECIAL ISSUE.\n\n\n     Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his\n\nrequest that the jury not be required to unanimously find the\n\nintellectual disability special issue in his favor. Appellant’s contention\n\nlacks merit.\n\n                            Pertinent Facts\n\n       During the charge conference,          Appellant requested the\n\nfollowing:\n\n     . . . where the Court is submitting and that the jury, to find\n     mental retardation, must agree unanimously, we are\n     requesting a civil burden be placed here. In the state of\n\n\n                                     287\n\f      Texas, a civil burden is a jury verdict of ten members of the\n      jury, as opposed to the twelve.\n\n      In other words, none is not unanimously to be found, and we\n      would ask that the Court adopt or adapt one of the - - like,\n      on page three, where it says in the middle of the page “you\n      may not answer either issue” we would request “. . . this\n      Special Issue yes, unless ten or more Members of the Jury\n      agree”. That that be applied, instead of a unanimously [sic]\n      burden.\n\n(RR69:125-26). Appellant’s request was denied. (RR69:126).\n\n           The jury was instructed regarding the intellectual disability\n\nspecial issue as follows:\n\n      You may not answer Special Issue No. 1 “yes” or “no” unless\n      the jury agrees unanimously. Members of the jury need not\n      agree on what particular evidence supports a “yes” answer\n      to Special Issue No. 1.\n\n(CR3:19).\n\n                                  Analysis\n\n           On appeal, Appellant has failed to properly brief this issue. He\n\nlists three cases and a statute, but he includes no argument showing\n\nthat he was entitled to the complained-of instruction. Tex. R. App. P.\n\n38.1(i).\n\n\n\n\n                                      288\n\f        Regardless, Appellant’s argument lacks merit. Unlike the future\n\ndanger and mitigation special issues, the Texas Legislature has not\n\nestablished a statutory scheme for the presentation and determination\n\nof an issue of intellectual disability in a capital murder trial.    See\n\nHunter v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2356707\"><a href=\"/opinion/2356707/hunter-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">243</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">664</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 672 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007).          In\n\nHunter, this Court overruled Hunter’s complaint that he was entitled to\n\na pre-trial determination of intellectual disability.   Id.   This Court\n\nstated that, “In the absence of legislation or a constitutional\n\nrequirement directing when the determination of mental retardation is\n\nto be made or by whom, the trial court committed no error in denying\n\n[Hunter] a pretrial determination of mental retardation by a judge or\n\njury separate from that determining guilt.” Id.

In response, the State argued that an accomplice instruction\n\nwould be appropriate for a guilt-or-innocence charge, but not a\n\npunishment charge.     (RR69:127).         The State pointed out that the\n                                     291\n\fexisting charge already instructed the jury to determine the credibility\n\nof each witness, which would necessarily include Lonnie.

Contrary\n\nto the statements in Appellant’s brief, a parties instruction was not\n\nincluded in the original guilt/innocence charge. The jury was instructed\n\nthat Lonnie Thomas was an accomplice, however, there was no\n\ninstruction regarding Appellant’s criminal responsibility as a party.\n\nBecause there was no parties instruction in the guilt/innocence charge,\n\nAppellant was not entitled to one in the instant punishment charge.\n\n         Issue 53 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S   RESPONSE TO ISSUE     54:    THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR IN\nDENYING APPELLANT’S REQUEST FOR A SECOND COMPETENCY HEARING.\n\n\n         Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his\n\nrequest for a second competency hearing. Appellant’s contention lacks\n\nmerit.\n\n                             Pertinent Facts\n\n         On July 9, 2014, the jury found Appellant competent to stand\n\ntrial. (RR59:7).\n\n         Trial on the merits began on July 10, 2014. (RR60). At the\n\nconclusion of testimony on July 15, defense counsel requested the\n\nopportunity for he and Appellant to put some things on the record, ex\n                                      295\n\fparte.    (RR63:204-05).     During that ex parte hearing, Appellant\n\nappeared to offer to “accept signing any document, endorsing any\n\npaperwork needed,” so that he could go home, having already served 27\n\nyears for this offense.      (RR63:209-10).   The trial court informed\n\nAppellant that even if counsel filed a Motion for Time Served, he “would\n\nhave to deny it.    Because the State has the . . . right to make the\n\nelection how they wish to proceed in this type of case. And if they wish\n\nto proceed and pursue the death penalty, then the Court cannot, on its\n\nown, prevent them from doing so.” (RR63:211).\n\n         The following morning, before Appellant was brought into the\n\ncourtroom, he completely undressed himself then smeared feces on his\n\nface and upper chest.      (RR64:4; DX4-5).   In a hearing in chambers,\n\ndefense counsel stated:\n\n     . . . We were in court getting ready to proceed in trial when\n     the bailiffs alerted us that Mr. Thomas was back in his cell\n     and undressed and covered in feces.\n\n     They allowed me to go back to the holding cell to speak to\n     him. I asked him if he would get dressed and clean himself\n     up, and he said he was fine the way he was. I asked him\n     was he refusing to come into court, and he said, no; that he\n     was ready to come into the courtroom, but that’s the way he\n     was going to enter.\n\n\n                                    296\n\f(RR64:3).   Counsel took photographs of Appellant with his phone and\n\nshowed them to the trial court “to support our position again that there\n\nhas been a material change in his competency, and we would ask the\n\nCourt to consider that at this time when deciding whether to make an\n\ninquiry.” (RR64:5-6; DX4-5).   Counsel advised of her intent to file an\n\nAmended Motion for Competency Evaluation and Hearing. (RR64:5).\n\nThe trial court stated that the defense could file their motion and he\n\nwould take it under advisement. (RR64:6). The judge stated, however,\n\nthat he believed that Appellant was “just playing games and trying to\n\ndelay this proceeding.” (RR64:6).\n\n       Appellant agreed to take a shower and clean himself and then\n\nreturn to court. (RR64:10-11). He requested to see his “psych doctor at\n\nthe jail.” (RR64:11).   Testimony resumed that afternoon. (RR65:8).\n\nAppellant elected to remain in the holdover during testimony.\n\n(RR65:8).\n\n       On July 23, 2014, defense counsel filed “Under Seal Defendant’s\n\nSecond Notice of Incompetence to Stand Trial.”      (CR-S:24).   In the\n\nmotion, counsel alleged that “[s]ubsequent to the jury determination on\n\nJuly 9, 2014 that the Defendant was competent to stand trial there has\n\n\n                                    297\n\fbeen a marked and material decline in the Defendant’s competency[.]”\n\n(CR-S:24).   Counsel requested that the trial court again inquire into\n\nAppellant’s competency to stand trial.        In support of the motion,\n\ncounsel attached an affidavit wherein she averred that Appellant’s\n\ncondition had worsened; he has persistent delusions; he did not\n\nunderstand that his innocence is not at issue in the trial proceedings; on\n\nJuly 16, 2014, Appellant “had a breakdown, removing all his clothes in\n\nthe holdover and smearing excrement on his face and chest.” (CR-S:24).\n\n       After closing arguments but before the verdict, defense counsel\n\n“ask[ed] the court consider our Motion and make its ruling.” (RR70:81).\n\nThe motion was denied. (RR70:81). Counsel re-urged the motion after\n\nthe verdict, but prior to sentencing. (RR70:84). The motion was denied.\n\n(RR70:84).\n\n                            Applicable Law\n\n       A defendant is presumed competent to stand trial. Tex. Code\n\nCrim. Proc. Ann. art. 46B.003(b). A defendant is incompetent to stand\n\ntrial if he lacks: (1) sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer\n\nwith a reasonable degree of rational understanding; or (2) a rational as\n\nwell as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.

Should a formal competency\n\ntrial result in a finding of competency, the trial court is not obliged to\n\nrevisit the issue later absent a material change of circumstances\n\nsuggesting that the defendant's mental status has deteriorated.

App. 2013).\n\n                                Analysis\n\n        The trial court did not err in denying Appellant’s request for a\n\nsecond competency determination because Appellant failed to prove a\n\nmaterial change of circumstances since the previous determination of\n\ncompetency. Appellant’s competence was determined by a jury on July\n\n9th.   A week later, on July 16th, when trial on the merits was well\n\nunderway, Appellant undressed and smeared feces on his face and\n\nchest. In a hearing in chambers, the judge stated:\n\n       For the record, the Court engaged in a conversation with\n       the Defendant after the end of testimony yesterday and,\n       based on that conversation, the Court is going to proceed\n       with the trial.\n\n       The Court is of the opinion that the Defendant is just\n       playing games and trying to delay this proceeding.\n\n(RR64:6).    This exchange was the informal inquiry into Appellant’s\n\ncompetency. It is clear from the judge’s comment, however, that he did\n\n                                   299\n\fnot believe that evidence existed to support a finding of incompetency.\n\nA trial court's first-hand factual assessment of a defendant's\n\ncompetency is entitled to great deference on appeal. Ross v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1986278\"><a href=\"/opinion/1986278/ross-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 627 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004).\n\n       In any event, the trial court invited the defense to file a motion,\n\nwhich the judge would take under advisement. (RR64:4).           Defense\n\ncounsel did not file the instant motion until seven days later, on July\n\n23rd, when the parties delivered their closing arguments.      (CR-S:24).\n\nAlthough the motion alleges that Appellant has suffered “a marked and\n\nmaterial decline in Defendant’s competency[,]”         no evidence was\n\npresented to prove that there had been a material change in\n\ncircumstances in connection with Appellant’s mental status.        In the\n\naffidavit attached to the motion, counsel described that Appellant\n\nsuffers from delusions.    But, this evidence was presented and rejected\n\nat the July 7th competency trial. (RR57:177-80, 182, 185). Counsel also\n\nalleged that Appellant “persists in demanding that we put on a defense\n\nto his guilt.” (CR-S:24). Evidence on this subject was also presented at\n\nthe competency trial.     Dr. McGarrahan testified at length regarding\n\nAppellant’s belief that he cannot be convicted if the State fails to\n\n\n                                    300\n\fintroduce the murder weapon.       (RR57:175-77).     She testified that\n\nAppellant believes that State’s witnesses are working behind the scenes\n\nto ensure his conviction. (RR57:177).     She testified that Appellant’s\n\n“perceptions and his beliefs are not based in reality.” (RR57:179). “He\n\nbelieves that if only his attorneys . . . could file the right motion, he\n\ncould walk out the door.” (RR57:181). The competency jury heard this\n\ninformation and rejected it. (RR59:7).\n\n       The affidavit also described the July 16th feces incident.\n\nHowever, beyond the mere fact of the incident itself, no evidence was\n\npresented to suggest that in the days between the jury’s determination\n\nof competency, the feces incident and informal inquiry, and the filing of\n\nthe motion, that Appellant had suffered a material change of\n\ncircumstances suggesting that his mental status has deteriorated.\n\nBeyond the mere fact of the incident itself, no evidence was presented to\n\nsuggest that Appellant lacked sufficient present ability to consult with\n\nhis lawyers with a reasonable degree of rational understanding or that\n\nhe lacked a rational as well as a factual understanding of the\n\nproceedings. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 46B.003(a). Indeed,\n\nthe affidavit merely recites that after the incident, Appellant “seemed\n\n\n                                   301\n\fdazed [and] largely non-responsive to [counsel’s] questions and\n\nexplanations.” (CR-S:24).    The next day, Appellant “was cheerful and\n\nhad returned to his delusive state.” (CR-S:24). There is no mention of\n\nany additional information suggesting a deterioration in Appellant’s\n\nmental status.\n\n       While it is true that Appellant’s decision to smear feces on his\n\nface and upper chest was shocking and repellant, it was not necessarily\n\nan act demonstrating incompetency.       Johnson v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n18 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2013, no pet.) (stating that “[b]izarre,\n\nobscene, or disruptive comments by a defendant during court\n\nproceedings do not necessarily constitute evidence supporting a finding\n\nof incompetency”). Instead, it was an act intended to cause disruption.\n\nFrom the very beginning of the trial proceedings, Appellant engaged in\n\nbehavior calculated to disrupt those proceedings.    At the beginning of\n\nvoir dire, Appellant sought to voluntarily absent himself. (RR12:10-11).\n\nHe told counsel that if he was brought into the courtroom that he would\n\nfight the guards.   (RR11:6).   On July 12th, Appellant told one of his\n\nlawyers that “The three of us need to work together to stop the trial[.]”\n\n(CR-S:24). Three days later (the day before the feces incident), during\n\n\n                                   302\n\ftestimony by State’s witness Turner, Appellant stood up and tried to\n\nwalk out of the courtroom into the holdover. (RR63:163). At the end of\n\nthat day, during the ex parte hearing described above, Appellant told\n\nthe judge that he had “asked Mr. Carlos [sic] to stop the jury several\n\ntimes.” (RR63:210).      The following morning, Appellant smeared feces\n\non himself.\n\n        The feces incident was not the act of a man suffering a material\n\ndeterioration in his mental status; it was the well-devised strategy of a\n\nman trying to derail his capital murder trial. It is worth noting the\n\nbailiff’s description of the incident:\n\n      When we did roll call, [Appellant] was in his cell and he was\n      dressed out at that time. When we had went to get him for\n      court, he was totally nude and he had feces wiped across his\n      entire face and also his chest. His clothes were folded up\n      and put to the side. There was no feces on the walls or floor\n      or anywhere inside the cell. It was just on hisself [sic].\n\n(RR64:9).     Indeed, the photographs reflect that Appellant smeared the\n\nfeces on his face very carefully, deliberately avoiding his eyes, nose, and\n\nmouth. (RR72:15, 17; DX4-5). Afterward, he took the time to wash his\n\nhands as there appears to be no feces on his hands. (RR72:15, 17; DX4-\n\n5).   That Appellant was able to talk to his attorney and agree to clean\n\n\n                                         303\n\fhimself and return to court shows that he was able to communicate\n\nwith counsel. Given the foregoing, it is clear that the trial court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in denying Appellant’s motion for a third inquiry\n\ninto his competency.     At a minimum, it falls within the zone of\n\nreasonable disagreement.\n\n       Issue 54 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S   RESPONSE TO ISSUE NO.      55:   APPELLANT’S CLAIM THAT THE\nEVIDENCE IS INSUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT HIS CONVICTION FOR CAPITAL\nMURDER PRESENTS NOTHING FOR THIS COURT’S REVIEW.\n\n\n     Appellant contends that the evidence is insufficient to support his\n\nconviction for capital murder.

See\n\nEx parte Thomas, No. AP-76,405, 2010 Tex. Crim. App. Unpub. LEXIS\n\n452, at *6 (Tex. Crim. App. Aug. 25, 2010) (not designated for\n\npublication). Because he was retried as to punishment only, Appellant’s\n\nappeal is limited to issues pertaining to that punishment retrial. See\n\nSanders, 832 S.W.2d at 723-24.               Appellant’s current complaint\n\nregarding the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction for\n\ncapital murder, however, relates to the guilt/innocence phase of trial.\n\nAppellant has failed to present an issue appropriate for this Court’s\n\nreview.\n\n     Issue 55 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S   RESPONSE TO ISSUE NOS.      56-67:   THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY\nDENIED APPELLANT’S CHALLENGES TO THE DEATH PENALTY STATUTE.\n\n\n     In    Issues   56   through       67,     Appellant   challenges   the\n\nconstitutionality of the Texas death penalty statute. He acknowledges\n\nthat these issues have been previously submitted to this Court and\n\noverruled, citing Saldano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1685878\"><a href=\"/opinion/1685878/saldano-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, but invites the Court to\n\nreview its prior stance on these issues. He claims that he asserts these\n                                     305\n\fissues not to cause unnecessary litigation but to preserve the issues for\n\nfederal court review. (Appellant’s Brief p.151).\n\n      In Issue 56, Appellant contends the statute under which he was\n\nsentenced to death violates the Eighth Amendment by allowing the jury\n\ntoo much discretion in determining who should live and who should die\n\nand results in the arbitrary and capricious imposition of the death\n\npenalty. (Appellant’s Brief p.152).\n\n      In Issue 57, Appellant contends that the Texas death penalty\n\nstatute violates the due process mandates of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment because it implicitly puts the burden of proving the\n\nmitigation special issue on him rather than placing the burden on the\n\nState to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that no circumstances\n\nwarrant a life sentence rather than a death sentence. (Appellant’s Brief\n\np.152).\n\n      In Issue 58, Appellant contends the trial court erred in denying\n\nhis motion to hold that Article 37.0711, §§ 2(e) and (f) violates Article I,\n\n§§ 10 and 13 of the Texas Constitution.37 (Appellant’s Brief p.153).\n\n\n\n37 The State presumes that Appellant’s citation to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art.\n37.071 is actually a citation to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.0711, §§ 3(e) and\n(f) (West Supp. 2015).\n                                        306\n\f     In Issue 59, Appellant contends that the Texas death penalty\n\nscheme violates the due process protections of the U.S. Constitution\n\nbecause it does not require the State to prove the absence of sufficient\n\nmitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt, contrary to\n\nApprendi v. New Jersey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000), and its progeny.\n\n(Appellant’s Brief p.154).\n\n     In Issue 60, Appellant contends that the Texas death penalty\n\nscheme violates his rights against cruel and unusual punishment and to\n\ndue process of law under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments by\n\nrequiring at least ten “no” votes for the jury to return a negative answer\n\nto a punishment special issue. (Appellant’s Brief p.154).\n\n     In Issue 61, Appellant contends that the Texas death penalty\n\nscheme violates his rights against cruel and unusual punishment, to an\n\nimpartial jury, and to due process of law under the Sixth, Eighth, and\n\nFourteenth Amendments because vague, undefined terms in the\n\npunishment jury instructions effectively determine the difference\n\nbetween a life or death sentence. (Appellant’s Brief p.155).\n\n     In Issue 62, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in\n\noverruling   his   motion    to   hold     Art.   37.071,   §§   2(e)   and   (f)\n\n\n                                     307\n\funconstitutional because it fails to require the jury to give meaningful\n\nconsideration to mitigating evidence. 38 (Appellant’s Brief p.156).\n\n      In Issue 63, Appellant contends that the mitigation special issue is\n\nunconstitutional because it fails to place the burden of proof on the\n\nState to prove that aggravating evidence exists.               (Appellant’s Brief\n\np.156).\n\n      In Issue 64, Appellant claims that the mitigation special issue is\n\nunconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the\n\nU.S. Constitution because it permits an open-ended discretion which\n\nwas condemned by Furman v. Georgia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108605\"><a href=\"/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1972).\n\n(Appellant’s Brief p.157).\n\n      In Issue 65, Appellant contends that Texas’ statutory capital\n\nsentencing scheme is unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth\n\nAmendments        because      it   lacks     meaningful      appellate     review.\n\n(Appellant’s Brief pp.157-58).\n\n      In Issue 66, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in\n\noverruling his pre-trial motions which raised various constitutional\n\n\n\n38 The State presumes that Appellant’s citation to Tex.

(Appellant’s Brief pp.159-60).\n\n     Appellant invites the Court to revisit its prior decisions on these\n\nissues, which he agrees have all been previously overruled.           See\n\nAppellant’s Brief at 151, 158; Saldano, 232 S.W.3d at 107-09\n\n(overruling multiple challenges to death penalty statute); Escamilla,\n\n143 S.W.3d at 828-829 (overruling similar challenges).           Appellant\n\npresents no new arguments for the State to address. Accordingly, the\n\nState asks this Court to decline his invitation to revisit these legal\n\nclaims and to overrule issues 56 through 67.\n\n\n\n\n                                     309\n\f                               PRAYER\n\n     The State prays that this Honorable Court will affirm the\n\njudgment of the trial court.\n\n                                       Respectfully submitted,\n\n\nSusan Hawk                             Christine Womble\nCriminal District Attorney             Assistant District Attorney\nMessina Madson                         State Bar No. 24035991\nFirst Assistant                        Frank Crowley Courts Bldg\nCriminal District Attorney             133 N.
